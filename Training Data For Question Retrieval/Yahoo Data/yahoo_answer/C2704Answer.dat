TuHfZdYGaa	I think so.<br>  <br>  A friend of mine has a French Bulldog and him and Rocco get on so well.<br>  <br>  Im surprised by what an easy pup he is at 8 months old. He is good with all dogs he meets.<br>  <br>  I love pugs too. I think they will get on fine.|`|ks2z4po8aa	Dogs can get along perfectly well together no matter the breed as long as a person selects the dog based on their temperament and health, meeting personally with the breeder, preferably, so that you get to meet and interact with the puppy of your choice... If you were to click on a picture from a website, order a costly dog based on appearance solely, as if they were a sofa from a Pottery Barn catalogue (they can cost about as much), then you'd have no idea what kind of dog you were getting... Pugs shed a lot, as do French Bulldogs... The care is generally the same, though the Frenchies do need more ear-cleaning, facial fold wiping, and have inherent quriks and traits of their own... Some Frenchies can be downright mellow, whereas some can be very boisterous and playful, tending to be a bit too rough on other dogs... Again, this depends on the temperament, the pecking order in the litter, the provenance of the dogs, etc. A person that has dog-training experience would benefit greatly raising multiple dogs, learning to read their signals, etc. French Bulldogs can be great around children, but they're also very top-heavy and can be very boisterous, so as long as you're always around to ensure the safety and well-being of both your niece and the puppy, then everything should be perfectly alright.<br>  <br>  Best wishes in your endeavors.
ks2z4po8aa	As other have already told you, Frenchies can have their share of "issues"... A Frenchie from an ethical and reputable breeder should essentially be healthy and require basic, routine care... A poorly bred French Bulldog can be a "money pit" requiring special diets, ointments, corrective surgeries, or visits to specialists (orthopedic, chiropractors, dermatologists, etc.)... <br>  <br>  Frenchies are a bully breed and very top-heavy and prone to be resource guarders if not taught obedience from Day 1... A 2-year-old child is way too young to understand how to handle a dog properly since they themselves don't understand so many families find themselves surrendering their dogs over to rescue organizations because it becomes a priority to care for their toddler over the dog... <br>  <br>  Yes, crate training can work if your dog comes from an ethical breeder and hasn't had to travel by plane and soiled in its crate... My male was house-broken by the time he was 13 weeks old (2 weeks after he came to live with me)... The females were all perfectly house-broken by the time they were 16 weeks of age... I didn't use any crates but I have the advantage of working from home and walk all the dogs frequently... And while Frenchies certainly mature over time, they don't really grow out of their puppyhood until about 3 years of age... <br>  <br>  If you're looking for a similar dog this size and equally adorable, the Boston Terriers tend to be better with young children... Contact the Boston Terrier Club of America for referrals to great breeders...<br>  <br>  Best wishes in your endeavors,<br>  <br>  TM |`|NJ0VAzSqaa	i found crate training the easiest, mine was house broken in only a week.<br>  <br>  training frenchies requires loads of patience and repetitions and omg they drool and drool and drool|`|iBUDoaCkaa	Actually they are #7 easiest dogs to house break in the world out of 346 breeds of dogs!|`|AA11709234	Mine was housebroekn very fast.  For a male, he got the hang of it very fast.<br>  However, he NEVER left puppyhood!!!  He died at 13 and he was still acting like a puppy.<br>  <br>  He did have the Frenchie allergy problem, and had to get allergy shots for three years and live on Duck and Sweet Potato food, which was costly.  He was a pretty good sized money pit, but he was a great dog.|`|e7CMg3Oaaa	Let me tell you first a little about Frenchies since I own one and belong to several Frenchie Groups. <br>  <br>  Frenchies shed Alot<br>  Frenchies have breathing problems and cannot go out in the extreme heat or cold.<br>  Frenchies like all breeds have certain health problems and vet care can be very very expensive, can you afford to give this care?<br>  Frenchies sometimes will need to be carried up and down steps. <br>  Frenchies snore and fart.<br>  <br>  Do you think that your 2 & 6 year old will be nice to this type of dog? And will you keep it even though the dog will shed alot? and fart? and snor? Will you train your kids not to be rough with the dog? and likewise for the dog? <br>  <br>  They are beautiful, and playful and very friendly, look tough but are little clowns and sometimes they look like they are smiling. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.frenchbulldogrescue.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.frenchbulldogrescue.org/</a><br>  <br>  <br>  
2fdee6b1fd597a29209ecfad9dc8b598aa	No, I don't think you are wrong.  We currently have a thirteen year old cat that I have to give famotidine and tramadol in a water suspension to.  So, I know the difficulty of giving a cat a nasty medicine.  That the cat bit is not a sign of a behavioral issue; it's just a natural reaction to an adverse activity.  If your mom scruffed the cat with one hand and wore a glove on the hand that administers the medication, it might go easier.  But, your mom is in the wrong about euthanizing the cat.<br>  <br>  It's not really my place to say, but it seems to me that your mother is just taking out her anger and frustration on the cat, instead of confronting it and dealing with it in a more appropriate way.  If she does euthanize the animal, she may regret it a great deal once she DOES finally realize that it wasn't completely the cat that was upsetting her, but something else that she didn't want to deal with at the time.  Try to convince her to rehome the poor thing.  Your cat deserves that, at the very least.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|4zelCEY6aa	No it isn't out of line to think she's doing the wrong thing. The cat bit her because it felt threatened by the medicine. If she's never had any problems before I think that's a really silly reason to put a cat down. Try to convince your mum to let you give her to someone else. <br>  <br>  If she doesn't agree - find someone who's able to offer her a good home and tell your mum can finally se it her way and will take the cat to the vets to be put down, yourself. Take her to her new home and not to the vets.|`|jAzkja82aa	well,  i suggest you call a shelter ( without telling your mom ) and have them come and pick the cat up, explain to them that yout mom wants to euthenise the the cat for unfair reasons, so sorry about the cat.|`|9KOjKZoMaa	I think your mam has a problem and is taking it out on the cat. Any animal will react to having to take medicine; its a natural Instinct to defend what they fear could be harmful to them. I have two cats and whenever I have to administer any form of medication they are not happy and biting and scratching is perfectly normal. Animals are sensitive too and can sense when someone does not have their best interests at heart. I would talk to your Mam and tell her you will overrule her decision to destroy a normal healthy cat just because it doesn't suit her and if she resists; I would threaten to expose her to your version of animal protection. I hope you find a home for the cat; which I'm sure will be happy to go to and be received. As for your Mam; I don't think they is capable of having responsibility at the moment and should focus on getting better. Good luck.<br>  Also I agree with izo; with regards to fears over Toxiplasmosis.|`|RPp3WVOnaa	I think there is definitely something wrong with your mom. You need to sit down and have serious talk with her ( i.e. she just lost her dog and is grieving, she isnt handling the cat right and isnt interacting with it right by grabbing its tail and rubbing its fur the wrong way, wanting to get it euthanized rather than do the right thing by the cat, her depression, etc).  Show concern for her as well as the cat and keep yourself calm while talking with her.  I would also consider calling your moms doctor because of her depression and her behavior.  She's also using a guilt trip by saying "you dont care as much for me as you do the cat".  My own mom has used that kind of guilt trip.  She's suffering from depression, she's tries to grab the cat and hug her rather than be gentle with and just pet it, and she is pulling the cats tail and rubbing her fur the wrong way. That is all a little odd.  I dont think the cat has behavior problems.  The cat doesnt like the liquid sprayed down her throat. There is a way to handle a cat when you do this. I have had to give my cats liquid antibiotics with a dropper.  She can have someone assist her in this process too.  You can have someone hold her in their arms and firmly but not harshly hold her at the scruff of the neck.  Then the other person gently takes their hand around their mouth and opens it just a little and squirts just a little of the medicine, then a little more.  Squirting too much medicine all at once wont work.  The cat probably just does not like the way this is being done.  Your mom is being unreasonable to have the cat euthanized and not let you find a home for it. I would call the vet and see if there isnt a better way of handling the hairball issue.  You can buy hairball treats that are like cat snacks at Walmart for hairballs and you just give her a few on the floor.  You can also brush her gently when she is in the mood for being petted and help to rid some of the hair that the cat is ingesting when it licks itself.  There are other solutions to the hairball issue and I strongly think it doesnt warrant getting rid of the cat.  I would call your local humane society and explain the situation about your moms depression, her treatment of the cat, what she wants to do with the cat, and what you can do about it.  If nothing else, she can relinquish the animal at the humane society and they will care for it and try to adopt it out but because its older it may not get adopted and wind up euthanized.  Ive had great success getting strays adopted by my animal shelter as well as a stray cat with HIV who looked a mess and had a hard life but someone adopted him.  I would work to keep the cat in the home or find it a more suitable home.   It's a better solution than euthanizing a cat that doesnt seem to be a horrible cat at all but instead your mom (sorry) is the one who seems to be having the problem.  Her depression needs addressed.  She might be grieving over the dog and in her depression she is punishing the cat.  The cat bit her because she felt threatened.  The cat shouldnt be euthanized.  She will very possibly come to live to regret it and then have to deal with depression over what she did to the cat as well as losing the dog.  My mom said she had her dog put down when she was going through menopause because it drove her crazy following her around the house.  Menopause was a very hard time for my mom I guess but that is one of her biggest regrets and she realized she shouldnt have done it.  I always thought my dad had the dog euthanized because he isnt an animal lover but turned out to be my own mom.  Best Wishes!!|`|lyhnHhuWaa	No, I don't believe that it's reasonable or appropriate to euthanize a cat for the reason your mom has stated.  <br>  <br>  I recommend trying to find a home right away.... before the 10 day waiting period is up.  If you can let your mom know that you've already found a home then she may be more likely to come around to the idea of re-homing her.  Talk to vets in your area and ask if any of them can keep her and try to find an adoptive home for her.  It may help if you offer to pay for her boarding, food and medication until a home is found.  Or, you may be able to find a sanctuary that will be willing to take her.  The key here is to have something already lined up so that it's more difficult for your mom to resist.  She's probably afraid that there won't be a home for her when the 10 days is up and that she'll have to continue to administer the medication for some time until a home is found.  If this is her concern, offer to stop by and give the cat her medication until a home is found so she won't need to risk being bitten or scratched again.  <br>  <br>  If it does come down to no option but euthanasia or a shelter, as sad as it may sound, I recommend letting her go through with the euthanasia.  A cat that is ~11 years old does not stand a very good chance of being adopted and will most likely be euthanized in a shelter for lack of adoptability.  It wouldn't make much sense to subject her to the stress of shelter life, only to be euthanized anyway.|`|vR8wFJb2aa	I dont really see wht she wouldnt just find a new home4it. It is probably would be cheaper too. I really hope you convince her to let you find a home 4 the poor thing.|`|9PKyOE1Gaa	I think the only thing you can do is find a good home for the cat without telling your mom anything. Then find some way of taking the cat to this other new place without her knowing, even if its just a shelter/somewhere that looks after cats until they are rehomed. If she wonders where it's gone you could always try and convince her it's gone missing or something - could work.<br>  <br>  But I think it's a real shame to kill a cat for no good reason :( |`|yBuzaYoeaa	well i think you're mum is totally in the wrong, (sorry!!) it sounds like she has taken the cat biting her really personally and wants 'revenge' , i have a cat that is quite handy in the biting and scratching department, i also have a 3year old.. my three year old KNOWS to treat our cat with respect and wouldn't dream of pulling his tail (this may be self preservation on her part though!!) but there is no way i would consider putting my cat to sleep, let your mum calm down, point out that you have seen her pulling the cats tail and rubbing her fur up the wrong way, remind her that she is the person that told you right from wrong, and what she wants to do is just plain WRONG, take the cat and TELL your mum you will find her a home with a cat lover.. (i am thinking you are in the USA or i would have her!!) your mum will end up thanking you,once she has a bit of distance, cos i will bet that if she follows through with her threat she is going to have a heavy guilty conscience, also latex gloves and washing your hands after cleaning the litter tray prevents any cross infection if you are worried about Toxiplasmosis ..<br>  <br>  good luck and i hope you make your mum see sense and find her compassion!!  ;-) x
Pi8KfmOxaa	have you tried rolling cheese round it ,thats what i do|`|XXqESkQoaa	try concealing them in cheese that is what I done with my friends dog and she took them fine then, i hope this helps, also they do have pill givers you can buy from the vets you could try one of them, <br>  <br>  speak to your vet as well he can advise better than anyone here can|`|Xyj4nmFnaa	If he wont take them in food try crushing them up and mixing them with some gravy.|`|kdmhuVTEaa	Hide them in pieces of cheese or something smelly and give them to him separately.|`|NAGiNKFWaa	Can you dip the pills in water first.  Maybe peanut butter, cheese whiz, mashed potatoes, bread, my vet has a dog bone that you hide the pill in the middle, like a treat, I am not sure what it is called.  Can you get the meds in liquid form, that is easier.  It is tough trying to outsmart a dog when it comes to pills, and when they get wise to you, you have to switch methods.  gravy sometimes helps.
9X5j5etnaa	You can keep your Guinea Pigs outside in the summer, but especially not in the winter. The cold weather isnt very good for them.<br>  <br>  If keeping your hutch out doors, keep the hutch out of bright sunlight and away from draughts. When Guinea Pigs get too hot, they are prone to heat stroke. When it’s too cold for your Guinea pig it could easily catch a cold. Have a sloping roof to avoid water logging and rot. Use extra weather proofing if needed. <br>  <br>  Guinea Pigs need a separate nest box to sleep and hide in. They love to run and play, therefore a run is recommended. This gives your pet more freedom and a safe place to play in and receive exercise. <br>  <br>  Put a few layers of newspaper on the bottom of the hutch or cage to soak up urine, and place some wood shavings 1"-2" deep and a layer of hay on top of that. Avoid fine saw dust as this can irritate your pet’s eyes. <br>  <br>  Guinea Pigs hate the cold. If you keep your Guinea Pig out doors, it is worth considering bringing them indoors over the winter months, or moving their hutch into a garage or shed (as long as there are no care fumes). If this is not an option, you can add a snuggle safe heat pad to the guinea pigs sleeping area for extra warmth and protection from the cold.|`|3fi5WS01aa	no what you trying to do kill it. you could put it outside if you want to kill it but keep it in your shed its for the best .x|`|AtSDPHPiaa	Well, even if your guinea pig appears to like it,keeping them out during winter is much too cold for them.

wDA6iefDaa	This will not hurt your sons bird in any way unless the water is too hot.  The bird obviously enjoys showering this way, and many birds do.  It will not dry out his skin, in fact, it can help his skin.  Birds have dander, some of them a lot of it.  Bathing, showering or being misted helps a lot in reducing the amount of dander on the bird, which means he will have to clear his nasal passages less, there will be less dust in the room where the bird is kept, and his feathers will be cleaner.  Showering also encourages preening, so the feathers will look better and have a healthier look.  Showering with your son is a good thing.  It also improves the bond between the bird and your son, and makes for a happy birdy.  Many birds really enjoy showering or bathing with their owner.  Don't worry, it's safe  Please read my profile.|`|ZGFXBie9aa	No, this is very, very good for the bird.  He isn't washing the bird with soap, he's just letting the bird breath the humid air, and take a bath of it's own if it wants to, which is something neccesary for the bird to be healthy.<br>  I'm guessing it's a tropical bird, and this is very similar to their natural enviroment.  Lots of rain, lots of humidity, lots of heat.|`|4XUC1iKMaa	hi,<br>  please do not make the bird take a shower every day this will dull out the birds feathers and eventually make them ware away. instead spray him with a spray bottle once a weak and that should keep him or her clean. birds really love the spray bottle.|`|E7JaYjKUaa	What type of bird?  If it is a native of the tropics, every day is not only fine, but necessary.|`|d83MeCNFaa	Showing every day is fine, I do the same with all my birds but I don't make them so lengthy. <br>  <br>  Over long showering on a daily basis & using hot water can dry the birds skin out & cause some itching. Not giving regular enough showers can also do the same thing.<br>  <br>  So showering daily is perfectly fine as long as it is for reasonable lengths, most people do this for 5 to 15 mins per day. <br>  <br>  Showering is particularly good for this time of year with moulting & pin feathers.|`|Vyw0t1Mlaa	This is just fine. They like the mist that bounces off of us and onto them. And showers are great for their skin and feathers. So, let your son do it, however, make sure he follows these rules:<br>  <br>  CLOSE THE TOILET LID!!! <br>  <br>  Don't let him get soap on the bird. No perfumed body washes, some scents can give them respiratory infections. <br>  <br>  You don't have to dry them, they will shake and fluff and preen themselves dry. Towel drying, blow dryers, and other sources of forced heat will actually dry the bird too fast and cause skin and feather problems. <br>  <br>  Also, after the shower, make sure they stay out of rooms that are cold so they don't get sick. <br>  <br>  Get your son a shower perch for X Mas =P.|`|G9W8zPPCaa	NO your son is right...the bird would enjoy his daily shower and it IS good for him. Don't make him stop!!! Just make sure the temp of water is warm and the weather isn't too cold. |`|xT7Yt9kRaa	i bring all my pets int the shower with me and i have a dog, cat, parrot, gerbil, hamster, giraffe.....|`|zlQoBfcxaa	As long as the water isn't too hot, and the bird enjoys it, there is no problem with the bird taking a bath everyday.|`|Ue5NoJOgaa	Birds love that kind of stuff, just don't do it before bed, they need to dry off fully before bed to avoid disease.|`|FjwWitmQaa	bird love getting wet it won't dry out its skin just as long as the water is not to hot.Don't just take it away from him|`|63QnQRGfaa	just take the bird away when he has a shower this may be harsh but it works my son had the same problem|`|lVGjH80Haa	ok no problem |`|1LxK1Grcaa	Dry the bird's skin out?<br>  <br>  The bird is fine......if the bird wants out and away from the water it can fly and sit on the railing and wait|`|9x8tOaIyaa	As long as the bird has freedom in the shower and is not held under the water, especially too warm, then it should be ok.

5f477cf9f429c86fcdfa05dc5d148aa0aa	my cats can open cabinet doors|`|DtkLsetkaa	They can open the cabinet doors and turn on the faucet (i discovered this at 4am the other morning, thankfully I don't pay for water at my place :) ).  My doors are all pretty heavy in my house so I doubt they would be able to actually get it open if they figured out the knob, but I haven't even seen them try.|`|f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	Fortunately, no.

I think he's soooo cute! I love how his eyes complement his fur :)|`|Rw7gi86Naa	He's a domestic shorthair.<br>  <br>  Most cats we own are mixed breed domestic cats, not purebreds. If your cat has some similar features as a purebred cat which you've seen, it doesn't necessarily mean your cat is that breed. For instance, a shorthair cat that was born in America is not necessarily an American Shorthair cat. Just as not every black cat is a Bombay, and not every gray cat is a Chartreux. Also terms like calico, tortoise shell, tabby, and tuxedo are words used to describe the color and pattern; they are not breeds. <br>  <br>  A domestic shorthaired cat (DSH) is a cat fancy term used to describe a shorthaired cat that does not have a pedigree or belong to a recognized cat breed. The domestic shorthair should not be confused with the American Shorthair, which is a Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) recognized breed.<br>  Domestic shorthaired cats are characterized by a wide range of coloring and typically 'revert to type' after a few generations, which means they express their coats as a tabby. This can be any color or combination of colors. They also exhibit a wide range of physical characteristics and, as a result, domestic shorthaired cats in different countries tend to look different in body shape and size, as they are working from differing gene pools. DSH cats in Asia tend to have a build similar to a purebred Siamese cat or Tonkinese cat, while European and American varieties have a thicker, heavier build.|`|ojETaOHdaa	AWWW!!

If she was a stray she likely lived off of people scraps instead of dog food.  It's NOT ok for her to eat catfood. It has different nutrients and ingredients made for ingestion of cats, not dogs.  It could lead to kidney stones, bladder infections, and other internal problems.<br>  <br>  Keep feeding your dog wet dog food as her meal.  Add cooked rice, green beans, canned pumpkin, fish oil and either raw or cooked red meat (hamburger).

Dogs and cats need a balance of protein, fiber, etc. and that is why cat food is made especially for cats and dog food for dogs. It's just like giving dogs "human" food but they need to eat food made specifically for dogs. Try giving your dog wet dog food and slowly mix in dry food. If your dog only prefers dry cat food, just mix it with dog food and slowly phase out the cat food.|`|OkJp8W4naa	You have to be a little suspicious that he would probably rather eat the cat's food even if he didn't prefer the taste. After all, the opportunity to put one over the feline at the food bowl won't be easily missed!<br>  <br>  Even though it's not recommended, it is safe for dogs to eat cat food in the short term. The basic ingredients are similar, with the big difference being in the level of protein; cat food being much higher than dog food.<br>  <br>  The only problem you will face is if the cat tries to get one back and dines on the dog's dinner.

Cat food doesn't have all the nutrients that dogs need, and the cat food will be harder for your dog to digest. Cat food has a lot of meat and calories in it because cats are carnivores.

I would just keep trying brands and see if you can find one that she will eat.  Mix the canned in with the dry and then it will last longer.  Also put the cat food up where the cat can get it and the dog can't.  The dog will then learn she has to eat her food and not the cats.  She has to learn to eat her own food.  She's had it great eats hers and then finishes the cat food. Hee heee. But no I would definitely put the cat food up higher.  I have to do that with my dogs or they would do nothing but eat cat food and i would never have any for my cats.  So my cats eat in a different spot than the dogs.  What I have done is to put a large baby gate across a door into the bathroom and that's where the cats go eat as the dogs can't get in there but the cats can clear it with one leap.  Good Luck!|`|yPhCujOvaa	Maybe try to moisten the dry dog food with a little water?  You could also switch to a softer food brand like Bil-Jac.

Or any other time for that matter. Unless you have been giving her a lot of milk, or certain canned foods, there is likely something wrong.

Also tell visitors to ignore her, even don't make eye contact, because their greeting of her, though it is natural, actually encourages her to bite.

You will of course have heard the saying "a dog is for life".  Any 'good' rescue centre will be looking at the dog's long term future not just the short term and have to decide if a home being offered is likely to be secure in the long term. <br>  <br>  You have not given any details of your personal circumstances but from what you do say, combined with what you do not, i would guess that you are (1) a single person, (2) not working and (3) living in a privately rented flat.   Now if that is correct, any one or more of those 3 circumstances could change quite quickly.  You could bring a partner into the home who does not like dogs, you could get a full time job which would mean you being away from home 8 or more hours a day, a person living in a private rental has little security of tenure beyond the duration of their current 6 or 12 month rental agreement.<br>  <br>  All of these being the sort of things an experienced re-homer would take into consideration.<br>  <br>  Living in a flat which has a garden does not seem to me to be any different from a house with a garden to a dog though and personally i do not really see why you could not adopt.|`|NAGiNKFWaa	Well since the pound won't let you have a dog, try looking in the paper or on the internet for free dogs in your area.

They will refuse you ownership of a dog because you don't "tick all their boxes" yet will release a dog to a totally inadequate and inappropriate owner with no or little follow up as to the dogs welfare.<br>  <br>  Let me give you two personal examples. I have been around dogs all of my life, certainly have the finances, suitable accommodation and experience to handle several dogs. I have a particular passion for German Shepherds, so when a few years ago I was looking for a second Shepherd, I was turned down by a national GSD rescue centre because their policy was 'you cannot have two b!tches in the same household!!'<br>  <br>  Needless to say I went on to get another female GSD, and believe me these two dogs are absolute magic together. With the help of a retired police dog handler/instructor my two dogs are the talk of my small neighbourhood. Boisterous, playful and noisy they can be, but at the same time, they are trustworthy and reliable.<br>  <br>  Now secondly, and this is the ridiculous one; close to me is a "re-homing" centre for the UK's primary dog care charity. I volunteered to help at this centre and after a brief "interview" I was shown the door because I "feed dogs raw meat, and train them to be vicious"??<br>  <br>  It seems to me that most animal shelters would prefer to keep dogs, (that are both highly intelligent and very social animals), individually penned and isolated, to lie in their own p!ss and sh!t rather than give them the opportunity of life in a less than ideal home, but with a caring and responsible owner.|`|771aacf2f768bc76138476f792d8ae83aa	Moost towns have a kennels that take in strays for the local council. <br>  Try the phone book for "Dog Kennels" and ask them if they have abandonded dogs that need rehoming as you are looking for one.<br>  <br>  What type of dog are you looking for ?

I live in a flat and when I was looking to get a dog I spent a lot of time researching rehoming centres and breed rescue groups and many were reticent of homing a dog to people living in a flat.  I decided a Greyhound was the dog for me and I contacted the local Retired Greyhound Trust and laid out my circumstances - I live in a flat and although I work 9-5 I was either getting a dog walker or having my mum and dad doggy sit for me when I was at work.  The people from the Trust came to my home to meet with me and they were fantastic, I have had my lovable couch potato for years now and she has never been at any disadvantage because I don't live in a house.  Since getting her I discovered there are a number of Grey's living in flats in my area so if this is a dog you would consider then perhaps there is a centre near you which rehomes retired racers, I can also vouch for their love of sleep and the deceptively small area they seem to occupy despite them being a large dog.  I hope you find somewhere responsive to the fact that you have the time and love to give a needy dog a home and hope you find your perfect pal soon.  Good luck.|`|Rhtzhfg3aa	We had this problem once.    My cousin wanted to adopt and found a beautiful dalmation at the shelter.

I am assuming you are in the UK (excuse me if I am incorrect) but I know here in the USA that there are rescues who will not adopt out to renters - period.  It is because so often times renters move and it is difficult to find places that allow pets, especially dogs.<br>  <br>  That said, there are also many shelters that allow renters to adopt.  Please try around.  If you can perhaps check Craigslist.org and maybe there are foster families in your area that are fostering for another organization that allows renters to adopt and they can bring the dog to you.  Continue trying other rescues, it will be worth alal of your efforts once you have a new best friend.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!

Last year someone else asked this same question, and didn't get any replies from people who'd tried Sole Guard, so I will definetely watch to see how your question goes.<br>  Last year for the first time ever I took a show horse, and left her barefoot. This particular mare doesn't have awful feet, but she doesn't have super ones either. i left her barefoot initially due to problems getting a farrier to come to my yard (I live in a remote rural area) and I knew I could do trims inbetween farrier visits, but I couldn't manage shoes without his frequent help.<br>  I watched Pete Ramey's series of DVDs called "Under the Horse" on barefoot trimming so I would better be able to do the trim myself. I also asked my farrier (who came to trim about every 3 months) if he would not trim her sole or frog. I didn't ask the farrier to do a barefoot trim since I knew he didn't do them, and I didn't want to offend him. I just waited until he had left after his trim (he's a good farrier, by the way) and then I'd put a mustang roll on myself.<br>  I also bought hoof boots. I bought Easyboot Epics, the cost was about $60 each and they were not hard to decide on size, just measure the bottom of your horse's hooves after a trim, and get the widest and longest spots.<br>  Anyhow, to make a long story short, we went all year without shoes and did very well. I used the boots anytime we rode down the gravel roads or in a rocky area. If I was riding in a soft field we went barefoot. I showed barefoot, of course, but since the rings are soft it was easy. Getting from barn to ring was the tough part (lots of gravel in parking lots around arenas) but we did fine. My mare was never sore footed, and I managed to earn points in four events (I think I was one of the only people showing with a horse not wearing shoes)<br>  I would be tempted to try Sole Guard if I could hear lots of recommendations, it would be handier than putting boots on and off. On the downside, it sounds like Sole Guard only lasts a few weeks, and it's fairly pricey. You would pay for the hoof boots quickly for the price of Sole Guard.<br>  So you might want to consider trying hoof boots. I personally would take the metal shoes off as soon as possible, you can use boots and pads if necessary during the healing process. Obviously that will depend on the severity of your mare's injury and your farrier and vet's recommendation. I know I was scared to invest money in hoof boots when I had no clue what to shop for, but after a bit of trail and error they worked out really well. I would really recommend buying good quality boots, avoid the ones that use velcro closures or that ride on your horse's fetlock, Easyboots are good because they fasten with ski type closures and they sit only on the hoof. And figuring size was not hard, there are instructions on the box. Trace around your horse's hooves before going to the store if necessary!<br>  Good luck.|`|5i8lDbXfaa	I am in the same boat you are in.  Some horses can go barefoot and within days or weeks they will walk fine and wont't have tender hoof problems.<br>  Others though, like my horse, have very sensitive hooves, he has been barefoot for almost 2 years but won't walk over hard gravel or really rocky trails.  My vet gave me durasole, she swears by it.  Like any product it takes some time.  The directions on the website say for the first week apply it 6 times a day but my vet said it would work (just not as fast) if applied 3 times a week.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.durasole.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.durasole.com/</a>

The other ones just sit there and look at me as to say mom I dont like it in here put me back in my cage.|`|A2IDiIpIaa	Hello Rose,<br>  Hamster balls for any rodents are extremely traumatizing and cruel. They are only moving to try and get out of the ball and most likely are scared. It can cause back problems and easily break and injure your friend.<br>  They are trying to run and run and run to get out but it is still there, wouldn't that be mental torture for you?<br>  <br>  Hope I helped|`|CvLwS9p5aa	it should be fine. just check that hthe air holes aren't so big that they could catch thier toe in the hole. i had a mouse a few years ago who caught her foot on a hole in her wheel. it hurt so she gnawed at it thinking it would make it better but she made it worse so she had to be put to sleep.|`|723qR6p8aa	Hiya.x<br>  Nope its not cruel at all, They actually love the hamster balls. Normally hamsters/mice whatever dont like the wheel then they wont like the ball either.

Get a small one so it's not too much effort for them to push it, otherwise they cannot move and it would just be a small confined space.|`|09Ht3JyCaa	not really. think animal testing. i think mice go though alot worse!!|`|knFrwCxcaa	its fine they love it, it really does give them a lot of good exercise|`|Rfj2ULibaa	My hamsters love their ball... when I set it down in the cage they crawl into by themselves... I hardly think they'd do that if they were scared of it or hated it.  When they are tired of running in their ball they stop and start cleaning themselves, that's my cue to put them back in their cage.<br>  <br>  I have also let my hammies play in the tub - they don't seem to like it as much as the ball, but it's always good to mix things up for our little pocket pets.  Putting your mouse in the tub to play is a good option if you don't like the ball idea.  Just be sure to put the plug in so they don't climb down the drain.|`|XUEaEbTjaa	Hamster balls are not cruel- especially if you do not have a space in your home to allow them to run free safely.<br>  <br>  The balls allow the mouse the freedom to explore. Even if that exploration comes from simply running around rather than "fully"exploring something like they could do without the ball. At least with the ball they are getting out of the cage for some much needed exercise. Of course the best thing will always be to have a safe area for the mouse to play without being in a ball, but not everyone has a way to do this.  In this case, a ball is a great option. <br>  <br>  Many animals seem to enjoy the run about balls. The only point in which I feel it is far too cruel to put an animal in a ball is if it is a rat, guinea pig or other large animal. Rats have poor eyesight and the balls stress them out and larger animals shouldn't be confined in a small ball when it's easy enough to prevent them from getting into too much trouble on their own.<br>  <br>  It isn't "mental torture" I assure you. This is a big debate online with half at one end of the debate and half at the other.  There's more evidence pointing to the benefits of the ball than there are to the contrary.  I'm sure you will find your mice very much enjoy their out of cage time in the ball.  Some animals will even stand on their hind legs when they know it's time to come out of the cage to signal that they are excited and wish to come out.  <br>  <br>  Just make sure to get the proper size ball to prevent any possible problems.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|JGq9rKBOaa	I wouldn't. Animals in hamster balls aren't exploring - they're just moving. If you've ever seen a mouse actually explore a new area, you'd notice all sorts of behaviors that just aren't possible inside a ball. Being in the ball doesn't allow for them to climb or smell or chew or do what mice do naturally.<br>  <br>  If you want to give your mice something mentally stimulating and fun to do, that also provides some exercise, you've got a bunch of options. It's very easy to create a play area for mice. When I had lots of rodents, I bought a cheap plastic kiddie pool, filled it with "stuff" (cardboard boxes, tubes, egg cartons - recycle!) and let them explore it. Sometimes I'd hide seeds or fruit for them to find. They loved it.<br>  <br>  Some other people do a similar thing in their bathtub, if you don't want to buy a separate container for a play area. Fill the tub with toys and let the mice explore! Easy clean-up, too.<br>  <br>  You could use pretty much anything to make a mouse playground - plastic bins, large boxes - and fill it with toys and treats. Mice like exploring new areas a lot more than they'd like running purposelessly in a ball.

I am appalled that your vet has not gotten back to you by now with blood results. That is just not right and leaves you hanging about what to do.<br>  <br>  As you already have read here, most veterinarians don't know figs about feline nutrition. They are trained for one day ( if they are lucky) by Hills pet food staff, most of the time. DUH.. They want vets to sell their products which are nutritionally unsound and cats are smart in that they generally don't like them and won't eat them with gusto. BAD idea.<br>  <br>  The reason I am prefacing my rather long answer ( sorry about this- but I am passionate about the subject)<br>  is that I have a cat that was drinking a lot of water, and his urine was "slightly" dilute. Cats' urine should be concentrated. A blood test confirmed that he did not have "sugar" diabetes, but a water deprivation test confirmed that he has  diabetes Insipidus which causes his kidneys not to be able to process fluids correctly. He is now on a  specific hormone replacement to improve kidney function( desmorpressin) and while he still drinks more water than normal, his blood and urine tests are now perfect, with excellent electrolytes. This is a fairly rare condition in cats, but should also be considered.<br>  <br>  You may not like this, but Senior foods from Iams and Whiskas ( I won't repeat other nutritionally savy folks answers) are really not great. This being said, you don't want to switch any cat quickly to a new diet, since it can upset their digestive tracts. If it were my cat I would be on the horn with my vet's office and insist that the vet come to the phone, or that a technician give me results, so I would know how to proceed.<br>  <br>  As far as "Kidney condition" diets are concerned, take a look at this site, written by a veterinarian who is a true nutrtion expert about kidney diets. Once you get your diagnosis confirmed, you should slowly switch with her suggestions. If your vet balks about it, find a holistic vet in your area who can take far better care of your cat. I have one who is fantastic and has helped my cat a great deal with her treatment.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.littlebigcat.com/index.php?action=library&act=show&item=003" rel="nofollow">http://www.littlebigcat.com/index.php?ac...</a><br>  <br>  Another excellent resource link is:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.catinfo.org/#Common_Feline_Health_Problems_and_Their_Ties_to_Diet_" rel="nofollow">http://www.catinfo.org/#Common_Feline_He...</a><br>  <br>  Hope these help and that your kitty does well.

There are simply so many better options out there than to hand the poor cat a low amount of poor quality protein - which often results in a poor appetite and muscle wasting since the body is now robbing its own muscle mass to feed itself a decent quality and amount of protein.<br>  . There are new thoughts on this and the thinking is it is not the amount of protein but the quality of protein that matters.<br>  The Merck veterinary manual [www.merckvetmanual.com] says that cats need "4 g of protein of high biologic value per kg body wt/day".

If a cat isn't a good eater and consumes, say, 20 calories per pound per day, then 7/20 = 35% of calories can safely be from protein. It must be high quality protein, which means meat, fish, milk, and eggs, and not grain or soy. <br>  <br>  I am under the assumption that you have been feeding mostly dry foods. Many use a vegetable based protein instead of animal and that is part of the problem.. Your cat needs protein as it is a carnivore and cutting down on it will lead to other health issues and may cause faster degeneration.<br>  You want to cut down on phosphorous (no fish allowed now) <br>  <br>  The best way to do this is with a raw diet which you can make yourself or buy. (Making yourself is better) link provided at the bottom<br>  If you are unwilling to do that then something like the non fish flavors of Wellness or Merrick with NO grains are good alternatives. Wysong is also a good canned choice. This list gives a breakdown. Remember you want low phosphorous <br>  <a href="http://www.geocities.com/jmpeerson/CanFoodOld.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/jmpeerson/CanFo...</a><br>  <br>   You should be giving sub-Q fluids as needed.<br>  <br>  <br>  You also will want to look into phosphorous binders. Something like aluminum hydroxide<br>  Ask your vet or look into calcitrol<br>  <br>  <br>  You may want to talk to the vet about having injectable Pepcid AC on hand or you can buy it in pill form (ac not plain pepcid) and give 1/4 tab for stomach upset which happens a lot in crf cats due to acid in the stomach.<br>  I hope this stuff helps, here are many links for you<br>  Making cat food<br>  <a href="http://www.catinfo.org/makingcatfood.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.catinfo.org/makingcatfood.htm</a><br>  other links.

The vet put him on Hill's K/D.  I didn't like the low protein in that food so I did some research and decided to go with better protein instead of less.  Foods like Iams, Royal Canin, Whiskas, etc use lots of by-products for protein.  By-products are beaks, feathers, anything the poultry processor can't sell for human consumption.  I worked at a poultry processor and I can you tell you first hand that just from the smell of those gut trucks I would not feed that to my cats.  Anyway, the cheaper foods also have alot of grain fillers which are very hard to digest and don't even contribute towards your cat's nutritional needs.  You'll need to completely cut dry food out of your cat's diet.  Dry food dehydrates cats and is the culprit in most cases of feline diabetes and kidney failure.  I feed my cats Wellness wet.  Innova and Merrick are also excellent foods.  Stay away from fish based foods which can be harder on the system. Since I put him the good food I have seen a real improvement in my cat's health.  Make sure to sneak in all the moisture into her diet you can. Give her unseasoned chicken broth for treats and figure out creative ways to get that  moisture into the diet.  Eventually you may have to do sub-q fluids but for now try the food and see how she does.|`|b3b3292f0a82969ceed4f00b38611bccaa	That's great that you caught it so early. You have a very good chance of giving your cat many many more healthy years if you support its system with proper feeding. <br>  <br>  The following websites will help you in your search for education on how to care for your cat with CRF including proper food choices. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.holisticat.com/crf.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.holisticat.com/crf.html</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.felinecrf.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.felinecrf.com/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.felinecrf.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.felinecrf.org/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.felineinstincts.com/articles/Felineinstinctsrenalfailureinformation.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.felineinstincts.com/articles/...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.felinefuture.com/nutrition/kidney_formula.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.felinefuture.com/nutrition/ki...</a>|`|2Rupx457aa	My cat is 9 and has just in the last 2wks been diagnosed (xrays taken) with kidney filure and he also has a shadow on his heart, we first noticed he was drinking alot and his coat was very dry. He is on tablets from the vets but has great difficulty breathing (about twice as fast as a normal cat) he is home now and comfortable.We got advised to put him on Hills K/D but he refused to eat it. We know there is no cure and it is a matter of time, but it will be a heartbreaking day when it does arrive. We now feed him on his normal (Felix) food but no dry food. I hope your vet gets back to you soon when we had blood tests taken they got back to us the same day.Thanks to all that ans your question it was interesting info. =^..^=|`|65e71fbb06f5d33192d9789c626a3e49aa	I would not hesitate to get a second opinion from a different vet.  Diabetes, as another poster mentioned, would be another possibility (although diabetes mellitus, which is fairly common in cats, would be much more likely than diabetes insipidus).<br>  <br>  If it is CRF, I just had to put my opinion in here.  A cat in CRF cannot tolerate high amounts of protein, however, cats are also obligate carnivores and need high amounts of protein.  The folks at Hill's have actually figured that out.  The k/d formula has 28.8% protein which is a fine amount for a cat, and only slightly reduced from most cat foods.  In addition, the sodium and phosphorous content is reduced, and omega-3 fatty acids, fiber, calories, antioxidants, and B vitamins are all added/increased.<br>  <br>  If you refuse the Hill's diet, there are others out there, such as the Iams line.  I know that will get much criticism here, but these companies invest huge amounts of money and time into studying these diseases and their nutritional treatment.  These prescription foods are considered 'medicine' because they are made for a particular problem, be it IBD, CRF, weight management, urinary problems, etc. Your vet doesn't get any 'kick-backs' or any extras from selling Hill's or Iams or whatever they choose.  Trust me.  We sell these high-priced foods because we have seen good results with dietary management alone.  <br>  <br>  As another note, by-products DO NOT include feathers, beaks, feet, horns, hooves, or any other inedible substance.  By-products are such organs as lungs, reproductive organs, digestive organs, kidneys, etc.  Perfectly delicious fare for a dog or cat, and delicacies in many other countries beside the US.  <br>  <br>  Yes, I am an RVT--I do not work for Hill's or Iams and I have to pay just the same high price as the rest of y'all for my cat's Royal Canin rabbit/potato formula for his IBD and skin allergies.  I very much sympathize with anyone who has to pay for these foods.  But I have also seen them work, many times over.  <br>  <br>  Regardless, I wish you the very best of luck with your kitty.|`|fc5e4f4741642787d64f7d84cccb7b94aa	She can't break down protein.  The person who wrote K-D food is correct.<br>  Now if you can't pick that up right away it's not the end of the world.  This is obviously the early stages of the problem.  Go to the feed store or where you buy your cat food and look for the lowest protein cat food around. Cat food as a lot of protein in it.  Who cares what brand right now.<br>  This may not be permanent since it could be an infection showing up as early stage kidney failure.  If this stays confirmed as kidney failure you have to stay firm on feeding her the right foods.  At first she may protest and turn her nose up to it.  Remember she will not starve herself to death over a food change.  Wait at least 5 days before changing to a different one.  You can keep the food she likes mixed in at first and slowly remove it over that time frame so she doesn't get to weak.<br>  Keep water available at all times and this all could work out fine.<br>  Good luck and I hope that vet gets back to you today to relieve your mind.  Ask the people in the office if the results are even back.  He might not be returning your call since he hasn't seen them yet.  Honestly by now he should have them but sometimes things happen.<br>  Kath

N8PZF6vxaa	The first thing that comes to mind after reading your post is DM, Degenerative Myelopathy. German Shepherd Dogs as a breed are prone to this debilitating spinal and nerve disorder. <br>  <br>  Wobbling, knuckling over of the hind feet, loss of balance, dragging of one or both of the hind legs...they are all symptoms of DM. This neurological disorder is a progressive disease of the spinal cord in older dogs. <br>  <br>  I urge you to speak with your GSD's veterinarian. I have lost a GSD to DM. If I can answer any questions, feel free to e-mail me. <br>  <br>  Here is one reference that may be useful to you.

Dogs don't "turn dysplastic". They either have good hips, or they don't. You don't get an "excellent" OFA when the dog is 2...then when the hips are completely shot at 10 years old, call it dysplasia.<br>  <br>  11-14 is a normal lifespan for a GSD. Be thankful for the time you had with her. I'd set a date....and make plans. Sorry for your loss.

Female lionesses engage in a lot of headrubbing towards male lions and then begin their sexual displays.  Lionesses will lift their hindleg with their front paw or roll onto their back and bite at their hindlegs.  Similarly, females will “present” by lowering their forebody and arching their back and hindlegs.  The females do the presentation, and the males choose the estrous female they want.  However, the choice pretty much means whichever presenting estrous female they run into first.<br>   <br>  Lion mating is notoriously quick, repetitive, and unsuccessful.  The male usually initiates copulation with a mating snarl which is intended to excite the female.  If the female does not respond, the male lion may lick her neck, back, or shoulders until she complies.  The enticed female will then crouch down, and the male lion will quickly mount her.  The male lion during copulation will usually bite the neck of the female and let out a loud roar during and immediately after ejaculation.  The male will then move away from the female as the female rolls on her back and stretches her legs.  The mating activity generally lasts for about four days.  Copulation lasts about 30-70 seconds and is repeated once every 25 minutes during the four day period.<br>   <br>  Lions, however, are very unsuccessful at conception.  Intromission and ejaculation occurred 90% of the time, but the mating was still unsuccessful.  This mating inefficiency may be a result of the ability of lions to induce ovulation and therefore not specifically be ovulating during the mating or that the inefficiency might be a female adaptation to reduce competition amongst males within a pride.  Mating inefficiency is especially high in new male coalition mating.  Although females experienced heightened sexual activity, it took 6-9 estrous cycles for females to adapt to the new sperm and conceive.|`|b2b963e4a2388dcdf7632336d54b6f71aa	as long as he can subject to the pubs not being open

Now i had a CAE he did try and suck my fish I bought him back to the store.|`|Jkt3UkTBaa	Goldfish are huge waste producers, some goldfish need more filtration then some Oscars!!<br>  <br>  In my oppinion, Plecos suck at any type of cleaning, but that's your choice.<br>  <br>  It is not overstocked and it will get messy, both types of fish are extremely messy and they tank will get messy in less than 2 weeks so weekly water changes will suffice, a very thorough filter is required.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!|`|7erjLpuWaa	I have a 37 gallon myself and think it is a great size tank.  Bristle nose plecs or cats only get about 4 inches and they are not the nuisance that most plecs become.  Anyway, if your water never drops below 70 or so, they should be okay.  The only thing that would worry me is that tropical fish are sensitive to temperature fluctuations, so if the temp in your house fluctuates say 4 or 5 degrees within a day (and most houses do) your bristle nose cats will be more susceptible to disease.  Have you thought of weather loaches?  They are so ugly that they're cute,and they are common goldfish tank mates because they are a cold weather fish.  Many aquarists devote their tank to loaches because they are so interesting to watch.<br>  Also, I would go with a goldfish that is smaller in size, such as the Black Moor.  THey only get about 4 inches, so you could keep a few of them.  Most other goldfish will get LARGE (a foot or so), so you could really only keep one, if that.  There are alot of great aquarium sites out there, badmanstropicalfish.com being one of them.  The people on those forums really know what they are talking about--I've gotten some much needed advice from them!  Good luck with your tank!|`|aFslyRbMaa	<a href="http://www.petco.com/assets/livefish/freshwaterchart.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.petco.com/assets/livefish/fre...</a>|`|86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	I don't know quite where you did your research, but Plecos and Goldfish are not compatible. Plecos are very messy tropical fish. Goldfish are very messy coldwater fish. An underfed Pleco can get a taste for Goldfish slime coat - causing the Goldfish to become susceptible to all sorts of infections and parasites. They should not be kept together.<br>  <br>  A 37g will be fully stocked with 2 Goldfish (presuming fancy, commons/comets/shubunkins would need much larger) so I would leave it at that. They should never be kept with any suckermouth fish.<br>  <br>  Not trying to be rude, I just type..well..factually. I'd be interested to know where you read Plecos work with Goldfish - was it a book or a website? If it was a website, got a link?<br>  <br>  Edit: 70F isn't QUITE sub-tropical really, and they would thrive a lot better at a warmer temp. Despite this I still would never keep a suckermouth with Goldfish. You just need to go away for a weekend and one Pleco just needs to skim a sleepy Goldfish during the night to get that slime coat taste, then it's all over.<br>  <br>  Also, unless you're buying mature Plecos, any Pleco under 2" is exceptionally fragile and wouldn't cope with a fluctuation in water quality.|`|499ce2344d684feb00ec06bcf55edd71aa	As was said, I would be interested in knowing where you got your information. For starters, there are few varieties of goldfish that stay small enough to keep 2 in a 37 gallon. For that size tank, you could not keep both even if they were compatible.<br>  <br>  The pleco, on the low end will tolerate 70F, goldfish on the other hand at the top end will tolerate 68F. So, at any temp one or the other of these fish will be stressed. They can be kept together like this, but neither fish will live to its full potential.
65e71fbb06f5d33192d9789c626a3e49aa	There is controversy about the safety of garlic.  I know that garlic is added to just about every treat and is in many recipes for homemade treats.  However, garlic is related to onion, and onions do cause hemolytic anemia.  There is a compound in onions that causes damage to the red blood cells, which are then removed from the circulation, causing anemia.  This same compound is found in garlic, although in a much lower amount.<br>  I would rather play it safe, and avoid garlic altogether.  I recommend Frontline Plus or Revolution for flea treatment/prevention, and there are many other good products on the market.  If you have financial constraints, BioSpot is similar to the Frontline Plus and a good choice as well.|`|7WUvPI8maa	I would just take your dog to the vet and get a flea medicine.

It costs more, but in the end it will be worth it and your pet will be a lot happier and love you more for it!  :)|`|4nJ75Qd3aa	you can spray animals with a garlic/water spritz too.  either way it might stink.  avon skin so soft smells better & keeps bugs off.|`|jwIdq5qkaa	I haven't ever heard about giving garlic pills to animals because of fleas. Garlic and onions both will break down there red blood cells, make them anemic and if they get to much make them bleed to death. I would ask a vet about this first. If you don't want to ask a vet about the garlic just get a nice fleas shampoo and wash the annimal in it.

d00bc047d5b2cbd7a719a3772346f4e6aa	When puppy begins to bite, grab him, GENTLY BUT FIRMLY, by the scruff of the neck (the back), shake GENTLY and say "no bite" in a voice that sounds like a growl.  When the puppy relaxes as you hold him, this is a sign of submission and you can then let him go and say "play nice".  <br>  <br>  This is the way momma disciplined your puppy when he was still with her and the litter.  So it's a language he'll understand.  Remember tho, you have to address it EACH AND EVERY TIME he bites and NEVER let a bite incident go unaddressed.  Otherwise you may confuse your puppy as to what you expect of him.<br>  <br>  Also remember that this does take time, patience and persistence.  We combined this method with the "yelping" methond to address our Border Collie pups nipping (this breed is notorious for nipping as it's part of their herding instinct) and it worked very well for us.|`|dc3c05e029bb4f41031c7265562f3310aa	Pop him on the nose with rolled up newspaper.. lightly ..

Or, you could just grab a toy and maybe try to distract him, but the only thing that'll do is get his attention off biting you, so I wouldn't really encourage doing that. Just remember that your puppy is teething.  They eventually get over this phase, but for now, biting is an addiction!

Also, just play ball or something with her in the yard so she gets some running in.|`|AA10250843	Enough that keeps her from getting fat - seriously, your vet will tell you if she needs more. To be aroebic, you should walk over 15 minutes. Keep her moving, too, not letting her stop too long to sniff at things, for it to have real exercise benefits. Also, this teachs her you are her leader & you control the walk, which will help in other ways. Good luck!|`|57e3fc4129626d64e1cc54ecb001f046aa	Since she is only 4 Ibs she's doesn't have to have a walk every single day-only if she really wants to or has alot of excess energy..playing with her might be enough..My little 5 Ibs Yorkie girl i had for 15 yrs was fine without walks-she would rather run around the house. But your dog being young, she might require more exercise than that..It depends on how she acts in the house..is she destructive or running around in circles?? That would mean she's bord and needs to use up her excess energy. If she acts fine and calm inside, don't worry about it. As far as walking, you just need to let her know you are the boss-these little dogs will become tyrants if not shown that early on..keep moving when you walk...don't drag her, but urge her and gently tug. Or pick her up and move her a few feet further-then keep walking..it will work eventually..|`|AA10656496	This is going to depend on the puppy. Now is the time to start teaching leash manners. Most people laugh when I say something like that but it means they don't check everything out and they walk ahead of you on a leash without pulling. It could be a bit much for her since she is so small and you don't want to over develop the muscles. Most people walk a pet once a day and amounts vary by size of pet. And play with them, which playtime is still exercise. But with playtime she is learning what is appropriate play and not. Don't push too soon. She will soon be walking the block with you before you know it. I have a 7 month old german sheph. He started with 1/2 a block at 8 weeks old. But now he walks about 1/2 a mile a day. But I am also doing agility training. He also plays with my kids and my husband in the evenings. But this would be too much for your little dog. Just watch for when they start to tire.|`|df08ff1d0e2d054dd5d050673bdbd724aa	If she is only 4 lbs then she will not need much exercise.  Just runing and getting toys or what not.

If you are going to have her groomed on a regular basis, be sure she has a Bordatella vaccine every 6 months.  If she really needs to be groomed before all shots are done, call a mobile groomer.

AA11706151	You're doing a fine job, by giving the puppy a good alternative to being very uncomfortable or soiling herself.  You can move her crate to another room with no problem.  It's best when you have company to put her somewhere quieter.  Just don't pay attention to her if she howls or fusses - that will teach her that's what gets her noticed.  She'll settle down if the behavior isn't rewarded.<br>  <br>  You might want to read some great books on training. (Try not to pick books randomly - there are a lot of bad books out there also!)

Take the puppy out or to the littler box before you go and when you get back, she will be fine in the crate for the remainder of time.

G0KKfXMUaa	Okay, I'm going to give it to you straight.<br>  <br>  Right now, with all of the poor financial situations, it is hard to find someone to buy your horse, unless you are in the show world. And when I mean show world, I mean owning Grand Prix worthy horses.<br>  <br>  You'll be lucky to sell a calm, perfect ride kind of horse. And your horse is a jerk to ride, and does not care what happens to you. No one is going to buy a horse like that for a price you'd probably want.<br>  <br>  I would suggest you take him through some training. Teach him how to be a better ride.

He won't get more than $500 if you're lucky.  It's a lot more likely that you'll have to give him away if you end up getting rid of him.

One - because he's such a jerk, but people can work around that. In my opinion, your problem comes with his age. Most people looking for a horse around 12 or 13 want something calm, something that doesn't need any training. I'd be more willing to spend money on a young, spirited horse like that because you have years to fix the problem, and he's still young and learning. Because he's older, you're going to run into the problem of people not wanting a horse like that. <br>  <br>  Also, it depends on where you live. My price might be so much higher than others because I live in NJ and everything's pretty overpriced here.|`|L4uwRphSaa	well you can't sell a lame or jerk horse, i mean you can, but you would just make the horse mad, and the new owner, i would get work on him, then sell, the better trained he more you can sell for!  and if you do sell him while he's a jerk he will be like 600 to 800 dollars or probably less....but if you make him good again you could sell him at 1000-2500!|`|1XngLDxyaa	Sadly being he needs work, is not papered and not "young" (under 10).

If he has potential, with the right amount of work he could be a star. Some people look for this when buying. I bought my horse now for ￡800. He's a warmblood x, and very handsome, but he used to bronk and rear, and he had been broken badly and couldn't even canter. I saw his potential and now 4 years later he has won me loads in the 95 and 1m classes and he's ace at dressage and hunter classes! He's probably worth ￡4000+ now. I'm just trying to say maybe if you put a bit of work into him he could be worth a lot more.|`|BI1GbIZUaa	Since he's not registered and is a pain to ride you probably won't get more then $500 for him. There are a lot of nice horses out there that people are selling for cheap because they can't afford the upkeep costs in this economy. If you want to get some money for him consider taking him to a professional trainer to break his bad habits. Or see if there's a teen who would like to free lease him that is a more advanced rider then your dad. I think if you break him of running home when you're riding that you could get at least $1000.

Be sure to get one that was hand-raised as they are easier to tame and tend to be cuddlier than ones not hand-raised.<br>  <br>  Another bird that would work well IF you're an experienced owner would be a hand-raised cockatoo.

Read on.........<br>  <br>  ABOUT DOG FLU:<br>  <br>  Canine flu was first discovered last year after an unusual illness began to appear at greyhound racetracks in Florida. <br>  <br>  Cornell virologists, working with researchers at the CDC and the University of Florida, determined the sick greyhounds had a type of influenza ordinarily found only in horses. <br>  <br>  This finding is the first scientific report of an equine influenza virus jumping the species barrier, and researchers are unsure how it occurred. <br>  <br>  Virtually 100 percent of exposed dogs become infected, the researchers said. The virus is spread from dog to dog via coughing, contaminated objects, and even people. <br>  <br>  Nearly 80 percent of dogs exposed to the virus contract only a mild form of the disease, which mimics kennel cough—a type of canine bronchitis that is rarely serious. <br>  <br>  PREVENTATIVE STEPS:<br>  <br>  The bordetella vaccine, which protects dogs against kennel cough, does not work against the flu, Crawford said. Development of a vaccine for canine flu is currently underway. <br>  <br>  In the meantime, Nina Morano of the CDC said owners should take common sense precautions to protect their pooches from the virus: <br>  <br>  ? If your dog exhibits any signs of respiratory illness, immediately see your veterinarian. Tell the doctor if your dog recently boarded at a kennel. <br>  <br>  ? Use a boarding kennel you are familiar with. <br>  <br>  ? Stay on the lookout for announcements of disease outbreaks in your area.|`|983da09dc3ea0ef9d60b736fb7da884eaa	if it is canine flu then get her to a vet really quick.ours had that last year and she really ill....in the local area over 10 dogs died of this type of flu.........she was really rough for about five days after the meds.|`|AA10371609	It depends on what kind of flu your doggie got.  If they have parvo, you should keep them as hydrated as possible.

They are not for everyone though because they require time as well as attention. They can live up to 15 years so it's not a pet for anyone who falls in love with them then tires of them quickly. They require a special diet and daily social time. Without these basic necessities their life is very depressing and unhealthy and they die of lonliness as a result of lack of attention. Here's my extensive answer to others who asked about owning a sugar glider. It also contains more links with more of my answers in glider care. If you do decide to adopt one you can have these as a guideline to help give a sugar glider the best of care.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AvaRN1ZP7K2jdN6YEPRSkG_sy6IX?qid=20061127232022AAnrh1H">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|AA12058653	I have 5! My youngest and newest addition (8 week old White faced Blonde) Aiden is sooo sweet, he likes to sleep in my bra all day and likes to be rubbed under his chin! So cute. My other kids aren't nearly as tame, but just as sweet. They are more complicated to take care of than most animals because of the attention, space and dietary needs, but if you do your research and can provide all of that, they are so worth it!<br>  <br>  Are you looking for information, or offering one up for adoption? Either way, I'd recommend going to <a href="http://www.sugarglider.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.sugarglider.net</a> - it has been a lifesaver for me, lots of helpful people with sugar glider experience.|`|b0cc4dc9fb76a8ba638773bdc9a7518caa	they are cute but i think i would drop dead if one jumped on me.|`|ec1e3ed429f6a6c0b514f901daa49436aa	absolutely.

My housemate had one and it was creepy!|`|520be210c6e7c82d066f82fe37d7d96daa	Oh my, I've had at least 12 of those before and they're such amazing little creatures.  I have since given them up for adoption, but I would get another if I could!<br>  The only thing is, they're hard to take care of (correctly at least.) Most people know nothign about how to properly take care of a sugar glider, that's why I had rescued three of mine from situations such as that.<br>  <br>  'Family Guy' said it very well, I may add.  There is so much research a person must do to ensure the happiness of their sugar glider!|`|9fcc6e46bb2c44fdf25a65e524e72132aa	Yes, we owned two for many years.  They are a lot of work and you should never own just one glider. They can get lonely and self mutilate. It takes a lot of research and a lot of time to ensure they have a proper diet.  Fruits and Veggies and dried food aren't enough.  They need an array of supplements, variety of fruits, you need to avoid certain veggies like corn, boiled chicken, meal worms, calcuim powder, it's a big job.  Most people don't realize this.  They are colony animals and only happy if they are part of the family.  They aren't little box trainable and will deficate everywhere and anywhere.  They need lots of handling and do bark late into the night.  Owning them is rewarding, but only if you have a lot of time to dedicate to them, after all it's almost like being a zoo dietician.|`|d2d3458a5ea5737c72afb8a4306fdd68aa	heck yeah
a8701c5e9072ffc65dd87e71dad2b0a6aa	I have used a fly "cat" swatter on my cats.  I have taught them the words down and no.   When I say either word without results all I have to do is to get the swatter and they obey very quickly.|`|13843d6e1b2473434a973b47f7dbedd4aa	My cat unexpedtedly bit me one time, he was not being mean but being playful, anyways, without even thinking my reflexes took over and I smacked him pretty good. I felt so horrible after, but like I said my reflexes took over before I had time to think because it hurt very bad. Needles to say, he never ever bit me again. Instead, when he wanted to get my attention, he would very very lightly bite me on the arm, it was so sweet. Now I am certainly not saying you should smack your cat around, however, a pat on the butt and a stern voice goes along way, they will learn. Another thing, it sounds like your cats might be young, they will settle down as they mature|`|8eb5272cc2b0697b2616784ffdaba4cdaa	i agree with ajkoolkat....a fly "cat" swatter.  we have an orange one that we just shake at them when they are naughty.  none of my cats have ever been swatted with it, but they run from it anyway|`|e04a0ce143781184eba565373e53d90eaa	A tin can filled w/coins will scare them.  Double sided tape works great to train them to stay off counters, dressers, etc., they hate the feeling of it on their paws.  They also may be looking for ways to expand some excess energy so make sure to take time each day to play with them. Cats love heights so make sure they have a cat tree or accessibilty to high spots.|`|ea207ed5b6ef75b8f1362932a6abf174aa	There are other methods.  One thing I have read is that cats do not like the smell of citrus, so you could put orange peels around something, though that is not very sanitary.  You may putting aluminum foil on the floor or surface of the area you dont want the cats, as apparently they do not like the noise of the aluminum foil.  <br>  <br>  There are sprays that you can use, you spray whatever area you want to keep the cats away from, but frankly I have had no luck with that, but then again, it might work in a Christmas tree situation, but they are pepper based, and when you spray them, its rough on your nose and throat for a few minutes if you arent careful.  <br>  <br>  I know that someone makes a device that works like a motion detector, and when the cat activates it, it emits an ultra-sonic sound that is suppossed to make them very uncomfortable, but I am not able to find one for sale, except on the internet.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and if you find something that works for sure, please let me know!!!|`|37b78e8d24b1f7341e5590dbbdf74b12aa	I get a lot of mileage out of a loud NO! and standing up and just looking menacing.<br>  <br>  I don't know what they think might happen, but when I quickly stand up with my best I-hate-cats look, the guilty party stops what it's doing, freezes for a second, looks at me in terror, and _flees_. I almost feel a bit guilty about it. Whatever the NO! of the month is usually stops after only a fairly small amount of that.<br>  <br>  NB: I do not actually hate cats.<br>  <br>  'Feliway' spray (www.feliway.com) pretty much cured the scratching in the wrong places here, too. Might be worth a try if they seem even a bit stressed.<br>  <br>  Not that I don't sympathise with your ornament problems, but I had a good laugh at "two decapitated wise men, one decapitated Joseph, two...etc" -- thanks.|`|1ea6c1a21162a87aaa7c5a97828d9787aa	Our Christmas cards this year said..."Oh Christmas tree OH Christmas tree, your ornaments are history.'  <br>  <br>  Anyway, we have 4 cats and my husband has no patience for them wrecking things.  We use a loud, firm voice (saying NO!!!) and a mild 'wop' on the cat's bum.  No, we're not animal abusers.  I couldn't put into words how much I love our cats.  They're like kids though, a little smack on the bum goes a long way and make sure you discipline consistantly.|`|7bdd2a89f15c3c6872dd015f01e64a58aa	I have heard cats don't like pepper - maybe put some around you breakables?  I think you can get spary that they dont like too - i believe you spray the object and it prevents them going near it.  You could try training them??? My cat hates his fur being combed but we tried to give him a treat afterwards so he associates it with something good,we also make sure he has his treats in a particular place and he knows where to go at treat time.  I am not sure if you could adapt this - maybe putting them down evey time they climb up even if you need to do this lots of times to strat with - when the cat gives up give them a treat and make a fuss of them.<br>  <br>  I really don't have any other ideas - Good luck :)|`|9f38db29a31bdd91f3bba66fada40705aa	Our cats decided to try and climb the christmas tree, they got a spank on their bum and a loud no, they didn't try it again...|`|d2cfc6c4982ebf7645b850b8766e57aeaa	Since my 18 year old cat was a kitten, I've always yelled "NO!" and immediately clap my hands loudly once.

3d5b0daf71aeea109b4c7e30ef86a3dcaa	Exercise your dog a lot and dont give him an option of what he wants to eat. If you exercise your dog then put down a bowl of dog food he should eat it. Period.|`|AA12049777	Are you giving him/her any "people food?" If so, this may be why he/she is a picky eater. I have 2 Siberian Huskies - one is a garbage mouth and will eat anything, the other one is a picky eater and will pick at her dog food if she is given any kind of "people food." I only feed my dogs their regular dog food along with their doggie treats - they do not get any "people food." Hope this helps.

While chocolate is NOT good for dogs, it mostly causes diarrhea, but it can cause long term problems with the liver. Watch her for unusual behavior just to be safe.<br>  <br>  From: Talk To The Vet<br>  "It takes, on average, a fairly large amount of theobromine 100-150 mg/kg to cause a toxic reaction.

Spazio di movimento mi sembra di capire che ne avra` a sufficienza. Certo che non puoi pretendere di portarlo a passeggio, anche perche` un gatto ti odierebbe. Il gatto ama la casa e se tu ti assenti sovente, non va molto bene. Ma il cane, anche se lo puoi portare con te, sei sempre legata a tante restrizioni civiche.<br>  Personalmente preferisco uno o due gatti. Invidio la tua possibilita` di spazio e ti consiglio tanto di sfruttarlo per la tua amenita` psicofisica: la presenza di un animale caro e` salute per l' anima e un ricordo nel modo di vivere.<br>  Se hai voglia puoi visitare i ricordi della mia gatta sul mio sito accessibile da yahoo! 360.|`|491rrgIqaa	Io direi gatto: per evitare che scappi su qualche terrazzo vicino puoi mettere una rete...il gatto dà meno da fare, non ha bisogno di essere portato fuori come il cane e quando vai in vacanza puoi chiedere ad un vicino di dargli da mangiare...tra l'altro andare in vacanza con l cane è un po' un casino...devi sempre cercare gli alberghi o la case che lo accettano, e andare in spiaggia è un bordello!|`|1142dace7f894aae5b75c124a4f16a9caa	fughe a parte che se sterilizzato eviti almeno in parte il gatto è molto più indicato per gli spazi che tu dici|`|926da2c60c106802218f5c515f930a40aa	visto la discrizione del tuo appartamento, prenderei un cane di media taglia, il gatto avrebbe troppo spazio per far giratine pericolose|`|SSJaCe08aa	ciao, scusa se scrivo male, ma ho la mia gattina che mi dorme in braccio e devo usare solo una mano. prima di tutto io valuterei con chi ho più feeling e poi penserei alla casa. entrambi hanno bisogno di molte cure e solo chi li ama veramente è in grado di renderli felici, per es io adoro i cani, ma non riuscirei ad occuparmi da sola di uno di loro, perchè bisogna spesso portarli fuori e farli correre tanto e a me non piace. al contrario, se c'è da pulire lettiere, ciotole, spazzolare, non mi tiro mai in dietro, alla mia micia cerco di non far mancare nulla. posso dire che essendo una persona introversa, lunatica e un po' schizzinosa, mi trovo meglio con i gatti. <br>  la casa si adatta, se il balcone è un problema per il gatto, si comprano delle reti che impediscono di scavalcare, se non c'è il giardino per far uscire il cane, si va spesso al parco. tutto si può se c'è la volontà, e questa viene con l'amore, perciò solo tu sai se potrai avere cura di un animale.|`|dd16306e36781ec48139295dcb4244d5aa	Forse non son la persona più adatta per dirti di scegliere..io ce li ho tutti e due..un labrador e una gattina meticcia...e stanno bene entrambi...ovviamente il cane è molto più impegnativo del gatto...<br>  però il gatto con un balcone comunicante con altri balconi e/o tetti può facilmente scappare via...tieni presente però che una vv abituato torna sempre indietro...<br>  Lo so non ti sono stata molto d'aiuto...ma perchè scegliere?...se ti prendessi un cane non grandissimo ( i canili ne sono purtroppo pieni ) e un gattino...si farebbero anche compagnia quando tu non ci sei...lo so possono diventare una spesa...ma ti assicuro che sono una gran compagnia e soddisfazione|`|ABbWHZtVaa	Qualsiasi animale, non comprarlo, ma adotta animali abbandonati.|`|VHt03SAWaa	un cane sicuramente.il gatto cm hai detto tu può scappare!la grandezza?o media o piccola, troppo grande no senò soffre!!!|`|tJdQuqQbaa	non riesco ad immaginare un cane da terrazzo ..Avrai il tempo di portarlo a "sporcare " almeno due/tre volte al giorno?

Forse all'inizio il tuo gatto potrà avere dei problemini intestinali (diarrea e rigurgiti) o dei problemini alle orecchie come una leggera forma di prurito, ma solo per i primissimi giorni, fidati! ah dimenticavo! Se potete cercate di trasferirvi di sabato, così poi avrete la domenica per stare a casa con il gattino e fargli passare un buon primo giorno!|`|a07786928cbf04adf65db5f28b26859aaa	Io mi sono trasferita dalla parte nord degli stati uniti a quella sud...i miei gattini sono venuti con me abbiamo fatto il viaggio in macchina e per 2 notti ci siamo fermati in hotel...loro erano contenti giocavano saltavano sui mobili dell'albergo e ora che siamo nella casa nuova sono feliccissimi si sono abituati in pochissimi giorni.. Non credo che il tuo gattino avrà problemi...poi si sa i gatti sono curiosi, quindi per i primi tempi andrà in giro ad esplorare la casa nuova...certo un pò di stress iniziale è anche possibile, ma niente di grave!!!!!!

68026fb6fc69f89bca94a31b6a5f2cfdaa	Ciao Dark,<br>  ho visto che già ti hanno risposto in modo esauriente sia Oranda, sia Pestonjee.<br>  Il trattamento termico , secondo me, lo puoi fare ma non arrivando ai 30° xchè sono troppi sicuramente ( i 30° li reggono i betta e forse pochi altri pesci tropicali). Potresti alzare di qualche grado la temperatura ma senza arrivare al massimo consentito dalla specie. La temperatura la dovrai alzare di 1 grado ogni ora.<br>  Il trattamento termico serve a far riprodurre più velocemente i parassiti in modo tale da farne " vagare" il più possibile in vasca.A questo punto ( quando si muovono liberi nell'acquario) iinterviene il medicinale uccidendoli.<br>  I medicinali che stai usando li trovo ottimi, li ho usati anch'io con ottimi risultati.<br>  Tutta la prassi del " fine trattamento" te l'ha già detta Oranda xcio' è inutile che te la riscriva anch'io ( sarebbe una ripetizione senza senso).<br>  Volevo precisare, x l'ennesima volta, che L'ichtyo è un PROTOZOO CILIATO  e non un batterio e nemmeno un fungo. Ho rifatto questa precisazione xchè se non si sa da cosa è data una malattia, poi non la si sa nemmeno curare.<br>  Faccio un esempio " terra terra" : poniamo che un cane oppure un gatto siano infestati dalle zecche e che suggerissero di curarlo usando o un antibiotico oppure un medicinale x le infezioni da funghi. Voi pensate che le zecche morirebbero con queste cure? Io penso proprio di no.<br>   Chi risponde, e ne ho visti anche in questa occasione, non sapendo di cosa si stà parlando, sarebbe il caso che : 1 s'informi prima di rispondere oppure 2: che non risponda affatto.<br>  Rispondere tanto x i 2 punti a volte potrebbe essere adirittura deleterio.<br>  Ciao ed in bocca al lupo :-)<br>  <br>  P.S. Ho dimenticato una cosa: se decidi di fare il trattamento termico ( insieme a quello con i medicinali ovviamente) , quando avrai teminato i giorni di cura prescritti dal medicinale, prima di fare il cambio di acqua, devi riportare la temperatura a quella che hai attualmente , usando la stessa procedura di quando l'hai alzata( 1 grado ogni ora ) . Poi aspetti che si stabilizzi bene, dopodichè fai il cambio . E' ovvio che la nuova acqua dovrà avere la stessa temperatura dell'acquario.<br>  Ciao :-)|`|a278d86396d37023a3f15072b5d1f5cfaa	si  é  vero,   ma  devi  mettere  la  medicina.<br>  ragazzi  i  pesci  tetra neon  per  accoppiarsi  la temperatura  deve  essere  di  30  gradi  e  anche  quanto  i  pesci  si  ammalano.<br>  <br>  ciao|`|Y1EAC33iaa	Ma guarda che quell'acqua è troppo calda sei sicuro che non ti hanno preso in giro?I pesci rossi vivono meglio nell'acqua fredda.<br>  Baci.|`|a07786928cbf04adf65db5f28b26859aaa	30 gradi mi sembra proprio esagerato...però per i puntini bianchi ti consiglio di comprare delle gocce che vendono nei negozi dove vendono i pesci e gli acquari, queste gocce si aggiungono all'acqua e servono a curare questi puntini bianchi (funghi), L'acqua deve essere non troppo calda, ma stai attento che non sia neanche troppo fredda.|`|cAE9hUyMaa	ma li vuoi lessare ? hanno bisogno di acqua freddissima . i miei stanno fuori anche d' inverno sotto il ghiaccio . anzi è il caldo che li rende vulnerabili alle infezioni|`|fb2da5e55f260625c18d328a1e4a04b6aa	NN LO FARE XKè è PERICOLOSO!!!!!!

Riguardo alla temperatura dell'acqua... spesso come coadiuvante a una cura antibatterica viene consigliato di alzare la temperatura del termostato di un paio di gradi, ma quindi io la porterei da 22-24 a 26-28 MASSIMO MASSIMO MASSIMO! I 30 gradi sono assolutamente eccessivi per un pesce rosso, ti sconsiglio caldamente di alzare la temperatura così tanto. Una volta terminata la cura reinserisci nel filtro i carboni attivi o le zeoliti (che spero tu abbia tolto per il momento per non interferire con la cura). Dopo 24h il principio attivo si sarà esaurito. A questo punto procederei, se i sintomi sono scomparsi, ad un cambio di 1/3 dell'acqua. In caso contrario dovrai ripetere tutto da capo. Ciao e buona fortuna!|`|JlxkCMi2aa	ciao nn credo proprio che faccia bene al tuo pesce xkè sono pesci d acqua fredda!!! e nn calda!!! <br>  un sito internet dice:<br>  la più comune malattia dei pesci d acqua dolce è l'ittioftiriasi (causata da un protozoo intradermico) che si manifesta con piccole macchie bianche sul corpo e sulle pinne. la cura per mezzo d molti farmaci utilizzabili è del tutto semplice ed efficace. <br>  se vuoi altre informazioni vai sul sito internet spero d esserti stata da aiuto ciao|`|ORVvt8XKaa	ma chi ti ha detto sta cosa? i pesci rossi nell'acqua calda muoiono...solo acqua fredda per qualsiasi motivo|`|Tg2Iz8x3aa	L'ichtyo è un Protozoo ciliato, ovvero un piccolo animaletto che si attacca alla pelle del pesce,  l'innalzamento della temperatura è sicuramente una scelta giusta che in casi di lieve infezione basta alla completa guarigione, tutta via l'innalzamento della temperatura (20 giorni è troppo, massimo 4 o 5 giorni) serve solo a staccare i protozoi dalla pelle del pesce, è consigliato un trattamento con un anti protozoico che uccida tutti i protozoi nocivi presenti in acquario, sia quelli addosso ai pesci sia quelli che si sono insediati nel fondo e nel filtro.|`|bSNbwlubaa	I punti bianchi sono dei batteri fungicidi che si appicicano sul corpo dei nostri amici a causa dell'acqua inquinata.<br>  Ricordati sempre che i pesci rossi sono pesci di fiume o laghetto, quindi a temperature meno miti, da 16 a max 20-21 gradi C°. Oltre questo, morirebbero quindi... OCCHIO ALLE CAZZATE!<br>  Soluzione 1: Ricambi d'acqua più frequenti, 2-3 per settimana, e cibo meno e più spesso per non sporcare l'acqua.<br>  Soluzione 2: 1 cucchiaio (da brodo) di sale da cucina ogni 10 litri d'acqua. Questo agisce come batteriostatico.<br>  Da ripetere 1volta al mese.<br>  Prenditene cura! E mi raccomando.. non ci pescare!<br>  Ciao! ??|`|eIii1F5baa	sono troppi 30 ° x il pesce rosso tradizionale , e' un carassio  molto resistente e adattabile ma non esageriamo .<br>  la malattia che ha preso e' un batterio che si sviluppa con i grossi sbalzi di temperatura o impurita' nell'acqua , durante la cura , togli il filtro e tieni ben ossigenata l'acqua , dopo la cura togli le impurita' e medicinale con i carboni attivi e aiuta il  filtro con batteri buoni , tipo Cycle o similari dopo il cambio parziale dell'acqua .   ciao

iFFVj7vGaa	per quanto ne so le femmine non segnano il territorio e la loro strilizzazione serve per evitare cucciolate e prevenire tumori.<br>  Se ti fa la pipì in casa è un segnale di malessere, in genere. Il veterinario ha controllato che i reni e la vescica siano a posto?<br>  I gatti fanno la pipì fuori dalla lettiera quando non stanno bene o quando c'è una fonte di stress, che può essere un cambiamento di routine, un nuovo arrivo in casa, cambio di mobili, spostamento della lettiera, ecc... Una mia gatta faceva pipì negli angoli di casa per gelosia.

Se, nonostante questo, la gatta risulta sana ma continua a orinare in giro potrebbe trattarsi di un problema comportamentale. Infatti, nonostante di solito le gatte non segnino il territorio, in alcuni casi può dipendere dal carattere dell'animale. Questo atteggiamento è comune per esempio nelle gatte che hanno un carattere "dominante".

ADwAC7Yfaa	è falso!! non è assolutamente vero. I gatti quando vivono in casa e non hanno possibilità di accoppiamento quando vanno in calore smettono di mangiare e comunque il loro miagolare li porta  sempre allo stress e a perdita di peso (per non parlare poi delle fughe) quindi consigliano sempre, se non si ha intenzione di farli accoppiare, di sterilizzarli o castrarli nel caso sia maschietto, per evitargli questo affaticamento. Parlane col veterinario lui ti dirà anche i tempi e il periodo migliore per un eventuale sterilizzazione|`|1kKvXQNdaa	La mia gatta è stata più di 3 volte in calore e non le è successo niente.|`|ca2b4c42a82ce3c8a75c48dec11b097daa	Se non si ha intenzione di fare accoppiare la propria gatta, una sterilizzazione effettuata PRIMA del suo primo calore (e quindi intorno ai 5/6 mesi) scongiura completamente il rischio di tumori alla mammella o all'utero (la sterilizzazione comporta l'asportazione delle ovaie).<br>  <br>  Se non si ha intenzione di far fare i cuccioli alla gatta è comunque meglio sterilizzarla al più presto.<br>  Di sicuro la conseguenza di una mancata sterilizzazione entro il terzo calore, come dici tu, non è quella drastica che riferisci.<br>  <br>  Se vive in casa e non intendi farle fare dei cuccioli, la sterilizzazione è quanto di più appropriato si possa scegliere per il suo benessere.<br>  <br>  Ciao!|`|dcf2da85faec33b05c522932d2162f0daa	mamma mia!

Che sia opportuno non farli riprodurre tutto l' anno è un' altro discorso.<br>  In generale per cui suppongo nel tuo caso, tu possiedi 2 agapornis di fischeri caratterizzati dall' anello perioftalmico bianco che cerchia l' occhio, becco rosso nelle colorazione ancestrale che è verde con la testa che ha una colorazione che degrada dall' arancio all' ocra. I suoi cugini più prossimi sono i liliana e i personata che cambiano solo nelle colorazioni ma, sono caratterizzati dall' anello di cui accennavo prima.<br>  In natura personata e fischeri hanno leggerissime differenze di habitat, in generale i personata hanno colonizzato luoghi più in altitudine ma laddove le due razze sono entrate in contatto non è stato raro che abbiano dato vita ad accoppiamenti. Evidente che ciò accade anche in cattività senza naturali controindicazioni.<br>  I roseicolle sono invece un' altra specie di agapornis i cui cugini  più diretti taranta e pullaria raramente entrano nei comuni canali commerciali. Hanno la colorazione ancestrale color verde oliva con gola rossa che degrada al rosa. Da qui la denominazione roseicolle, il becco è color carne e non è presente l' anello attorno all' occhio.<br>  Le mutazione di colore più comune è quella lutina, laddove il verde diventa giallo molto vivo.<br>  Per il tuo problema le ragioni possono essere:<br>  1) Assenza del nido<br>  2) Giovane età, raggiungono la maturità sessuale intorno ai 10 mesi, pur formando la coppia intorno ai 3 cominciando già a scimmiottare gli adulti.<br>  3) Appartenenti a 2 specie diverse di inseparabile..esempio...roseicolle con personata, fischer, lilianae o viceversa<br>  4) Al 99% si tratta di 2 femmine. Spesso si comportano come una vera coppia, simulando tutti i comportamenti ma, ovviamente non dando vita a nulla.<br>  5) problemi di uno dei 2 ma, lo escluderei.<br>  <br>  Il dimorfismo sessuale è assente (percepibile solo da occhi esperti nei roseicolle) per cui capita spesso che gli individui dello stesso sesso vengano confusi come una coppia.<br>  La cattiva notizia consiste nel fatto che seppur tu riuscissi a trovare 2 soggetti di sesso opposto, applicassi dei nidi idonei, non avresti garanzie che si formino coppie eterosessuali.<br>  Dammi ulteriori dettagli se vorrai e potrai.|`|SHq3SBz2aa	perché non sempre riesce, o magari uno dei due è sterile.|`|c3fec78baae6d21d2f2e67fbd20d011aaa	Il perchè non lo so.<br>  Però con i due pennuti,che ben conosco,puoi sempre<br>  preparare una gustosa pietanza,magari con delle uova...<br>  Oppure ci balli la PARANZA!|`|e4df87b9485dd6bb5fd03400ee020203aa	Controlla che non siano dello stesso sesso!|`|loXWxXJeaa	Sn furbi e usano le giuste precauzioni per non diventare mamma e papà!|`|oELMAPSWaa	PROBABILMENTE UNO DEI DUE E' STERILE... mASCUSA, COME FAI A CAPIRE CHE SI ACCOPPIANO???

Bastit, dea dell'amore e della fertilità, la cui statua si trovava presso un cimitero di gatti, veniva rappresentata con il corpo da donna e la testa da gatto.<br>  <br>  Anche in Thailandia e in Sud America il gatto era ritenuto sacro: vi sono tracce della sua venerazione già nell'arte precolombiana. Non così era nel medioevo, dove il gatto era spesso bruciato perché, per via della sua vita notturna, si pensava fosse imparentato col diavolo o comunque braccio destro delle streghe. In tutto il mondo si trovano segni della presenza, nell'antichità, dei gatti: infatti sono stati raffigurati su monete, francobolli, sculture e pitture e venivano dipinti anche su antichi vasi di terracotta.<br>  <br>  <br>  prima di dire cazzate DOCUMENTATI . <br>  <br>  cmq x i mici le fusa cm i miagolii sn dei linguaggi,ed e' raro che i gatti facciano le fusa xche' vogliono mangiare (almeno..i miei mici quando fanno le fusa e' xche' vogliono ben altro) Vogliono coccole,giocare ECC .un altra cosa,i micioni con le loro fusa riescono a far rilassare le persone diciamo che sn cm un antistress :-)|`|03d4f681a656a41fe03bef469968fdaaaa	è un modo per fare sentire che piace cio che gli si sta facendo ...e poi fannoi le fusa anche per ottenere cibo ecc|`|74c07b9c1989c4fbe4bd45811ee233c6aa	perchè i bambini fanno oh?|`|AA10375073	fanno le fusa quando sono particolarmete rilassati o felici.|`|EmjPFrkuaa	per dire che gli piace essere coccolati|`|GzOPwLBaaa	E' un suono che può esprimere soddisfazione o per tranquillizzare chi li sta vicino, i gatti lo possono fare anche quando stanno soffrendo o morendo. p.s. non solo il gatto fa le fusa, le fanno anche   gli altri felini e i Gufi, però il gatto é l' unico che le produce sia espirando che inspirando.|`|PvCggzVRaa	le fusa non lo però so ke quando "scucciolano", cioè premono con le zampine sulla tua pancia ad esempio è perchè si ricordano di quando prendevano il latte dalla mamma... ke dolci!!! cmq non è vero che fanno le fusa perche hanno fame, in quel caso t si strusciano addosso con la coda alzata o miagolano... almeno il mio fa così...|`|cXRzO28Raa	Perchè sanno che con i loro sguardi e le fusa possono ottenere dai padroni qualsiasi cosa vogliono|`|e817f1f0afec002f8b2b7969c1c05f00aa	perchè sono felici!!|`|oP8rW2IAaa	Quando il micio è neonato, inizia istintivamente a far le fusa e a "impastare il pane" con le zampette sulle mammelle della madre.<br>  Questo provoca una stimolazione nervosa che arriva dritta al cervello di mamma gatta e stimola la produzione e la fuoriuscita del latte. <br>  E' un momento in cui i gatti sono in completo relax, sia mamma che figli, infatti anche la madre molto spesso involontariamente inizia a fare le fusa quando allatta.<br>  Quando il gatto cresce rimane sempre nel suo istinto questo comportamento primordiale che esplicherà ogni qual volta la situazione risulti essere rilassante e calma.

Però considera che sono animali e che vanno curati, quindi vaccinati e possibilmente sterilizzati, non tanto per i gattini quanto per una malattia che chiamano aids felino (in verità è una forma di leucemia felina non curabile che si trasmette nei gatti che si accoppiano e che si azzuffano quando vanno in calore) che è davvero pericolosa (/ma non per l'uomo!) . A differenza dei cani, i gatti non fanno odore, ma comunque sono animali, quindi bisogna pulire almeno una volta al giorno la loro cassettina (se hai un terrazzino puoi far montare quelle porticine apposta per i gatti e mettere la cassettina fuori), e hanno il difetto che tendono a farsi le unghie ovunque, quindi addio fodere dei divani, divani in pelle ecc.. E considera che avere un qualsiasi animale in casa è un responsabilità: se andate in vacanza, o lo portate con voi o vi preoccupate che qualcuno si prenda cura di lui e vada a dargli da mangiare e fargli qualche carezza (anche loro soffrono la solitudine). Il fatto che un gatto sia indipendente non autorizza nessuno ad abbandonarlo!!! Se quindi metti in preventivo qualche mobile graffiatino e una cassettina da pulire e le vacanze programmate in modo da non lasciarlo solo, avere un gatto diventerà meravilgioso.

Personalmente ti consiglio però di andare in un canile o gattile e adottare un gatto, se lo prendi piccolo avrai il tuo bel da fare per educarlo e insegnarli le cose che deve e non deve fare ma avrai molte soddisfazioni, se lo prendi adulto puoi farti consigliare in base al carattere del gatto, ce ne sono di più attivi e di più calmi, in questo modo non spenderai nulla e renderai felice un gatto sfortunato.

Beh, vivo con una gattina, quindi ovviamente vedo più vantaggi che svantaggi!<br>  Per chiarire un punto che hanno evidenziato le risposte di altri: se hai esigenze particolari e cerchi un gatto con caratteristiche specifiche, meglio rivolgersi ad un allevatore serio di quella razza, perché non puoi sapere come sarà un gatto preso nel gattile ( grandezza, indole, salute ) e piuttosto che poi si trovi male, meglio lasciar perdere. Ad esempio, se stai fuori casa molte ore al giorno, alcune razze di gatti non sono adatte a te perché hanno molto bisogno di compagnia.<br>  I gatti presi in un allevamento serio sono sani, completamente svezzati ( così non dovresti avere problemi di educazione ) e puoi chiedere all' allevatore le abitudini del micio ( cosa mangia,...). Insomma, se sei alle prime armi con un gatto e non vuoi complicarti la vita...<br>  Io sconsiglio assolutamente i negozi di animali, perché spesso vendono gatti malati e non ancora svezzati pur di guadagnare, piuttosto è veramente meglio il gattile dove potrai trovare micini abbandonati ad un triste destino.<br>  Ti consiglio come prima cosa di comprarti un buon manuale in libreria ( io uso: Gatto-manuale completo. Steve Duno, € 23,50 ) che ti aiuti a decidere i pro e i contro e di cercare informazioni sulle razze e le caratteristiche su internet e poi potrai decidere meglio. <br>  Io vivo in un piccolo appartamento, ma non ho mai avuto problemi con la micia ( è una siamesina che mi ha regalato a sorpresa il mio ragazzo ed è stata presa da un privato ), certo che se vivi ancora con i tuoi, dovresti aspettare, un gatto fa parte della famiglia e dev' essere voluto da tutti<br>  <br>  Ti mando alcuni link interessanti:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.anfitalia.it/index2.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.anfitalia.it/index2.php</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.inseparabile.com/gatti/nuova_pa2.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.inseparabile.com/gatti/nuova_...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://gattonet.bbrnet.it/" rel="nofollow">http://gattonet.bbrnet.it/</a>|`|a07786928cbf04adf65db5f28b26859aaa	I gatti sono bellissimi, ma devi esere sicura di volerne uno...è vero che graffiano i mobili o le porte...ma sta a te educarlo...io ai miei gattini ho comprato un tiragraffi (uno specie di cono rivestito di un materiale morbido tipo moquette) molto grande e lui graffia solo quello non graffia mai altre cose, il segreto con gli animali è di educarli nel modo giusto...e ovviamente devi tenere tutto pulito...ai gatti non piace una lettiera sporca e se non la pulisci bene non la vogliono usare e ti sporcano la casa...devi essere tu responsabile e prenderti cura del gattino nel modo giusto, comunque non comprarlo adottalo..ci sono tanti gattini bellissimi che muoiono perchè non hanno una casa.....non esistono delle razze che sporcano più o meno.|`|b2Y4StA2aa	i gatti di razza (o incroci) sono solitamente più tranquilli ed "educati" dei trovatelli di strada. <br>  Il gatto è un animale pulitissimo e non sporca assolutamente, casomai potresti prendere un gatto a pelo corto così non hai il problema di ritrovarti palline di pelo per casa. <br>  Riguardo il graffiare, è molto soggettivo: ci sono gatti che graffiano solo sul loro cartone ed altri che ti graffiano di tutto!!|`|b6781531240773a8ec4cd25d803f149eaa	un consiglio, invece di comprarlo e spendere soldi adotta un randagino, sul giornale troverai tanti annunci oppure chiedi ai veterinari della tua zona se conoscono qualche gatta che ha fatto la cucciolata (anche se a quanto ne so i piccoli nascono verso maggio) io ne ho presi 2 cosi, uno è un incrocio con un gatto d'angora ed è bellissimo... ti danno tanto amore... la casa va benissimo, meglio ancora se hai un piccolo balcone cosi potrai mettere li la sua lettiera per i bisogni... tutte le razze sporcano all' incirca allo stesso modo, magari se prendi un gatto a pelo corto non avrai problemi di peli in giro per casa... per salvare le porte o divani basta dargli un tronchetto o un pezzo di zerbino o qualcosa x farsi le unghie, inoltre esistono spay repellenti (che a noi sembrano profumo ma x loro puzzano) da spuzzare x fargli capire le zone "off limits". cerca di argli capire che deve farsi le unghie sul tronchetto, magari appoggialo sopra con le zampine, imparano in fretta! pensa che i miei gatti (stanno all'aperto) sanno che non devono entrare in casa e qnche quando lascio porte e finestre aperte con del cibo in bella vista sul tavolo stanno educatamente sull'uscio ad aspettare che qualcuno arrivi a dargli da mangiare... quando ho preso il secondo gatto mia madre era arrabbiatissima non lo voleva neppure guardare, ora i miei lo adorano... vedrai che dopo poco inizieranno anche loro a viziarlo!|`|m9iXzNpRaa	avere un gatto ti porta comunque a prenderti delle responsabilità....ma xkè non lo adotti invece di comprarlo???

You can be sure to take her for daily walks, keep an eye on her diet to be sure she's still eating (maybe some extra treats too), and just be sure to give her lots of extra love and attention.  If they were left alone together during the day you may want to consider taking her to doggie day care off and on for the next few weeks so she has companionship during the day.|`|71biSakcaa	just pet her and let her know that everything is going to be OK. give her love and be extra gentle with her for the next couple weeks, and let her get by if she did something wrong, in the next couple weeks because i am sure that it will be out of sadness. and dont leave her in dark rooms because i am sure that she is used to being with her daughter and does not know how to handle the sadness.<br>   R.I.P little puppy and good luck!<br>  and i am sorry for your familys loss.|`|AA11305474	When my Siberian Husky died, his companion dog Kyrie was heart broken.  Despite what everyone said, I left his bedding, his dishes, his leash, his dishes and his toys exactly where they had always been.  At first, she would shy away from his belongings and even hop over his favorite placed to lay.  But, in time, with a lot of extra love and attention, she started playing with his toys, eating from his dishes and even sleeping on his bed.  I think his smells somehow comforted her through her grief.  Maybe just by leaving her daughter's belongings about the house, she will be comforted as well.  I am so sorry for your loss.|`|e5ccecc848044dff1fda1c4fffdf9b4aaa	I would get her a puppy.|`|AA12255195	I had two dogs and my dogs son died and i didn't know what to do either.

Then 24hours after you bring the puppy home have the dog on a leash and bring the cat out that way if either of them show aggression you can have some control over what happens. give them a week before they are okay with each other. just keep doing that until they seem alright with each other.

RJk9Gqz9aa	Ho lavorato come volontaria alla Lipu... e lì di soggetti "ribelli" ce ne sono a bizzeffe, quindi non proeccuparti perchè il suo comportamento è dovuto solo alla innata paura dell'uomo di queste bestioline (che essenzialmente ti vedono come un predatore) e dall'improvviso cambio di situazione. Cerca di non stressarlo troppo e di prenderlo il meno possibile, se non quando deve mangiare... e se è possibile mettilo in una scatola di cartone con una rete messa a qualche centimetro dal fondo che lo separi dagli escrementi (mi raccomando, preferibilmente non zincata perchè potresti esporlo ad una intossicazione da zinco...se la trovi solo zincata lavala con acqua e aceto strofinando bene). Per la pappa va benissimo il macinato per ora... se magari descrivi un pò meglio l'uccellino posso dirti qual'è l'alimentazione migliore da dargli e ogni quante ore, comunque adesso basati sull'imbeccata ogni 2/3 ore. Come ti hanno già detto dovrai forzarlo ad aprire il becco e infilare il macinato... ovviamente con la dovuta delicatezza (ci vorrà una pazienza di Giobbe, dato che sputerà regolarmente tutto quello che riesci a fargli prendere) e fai attenzione a non storcere il becco quando lo forzi, perchè ora è talmente molle che rischi di farglielo crescere storto con conseguenti problemi gravi nell'alimentazione da adulto. Per farglielo aprire prova a fare una leggera pressione sui lati del becco infilando la punta del dito o uno stecchino senza la punta appena lo spalanca un minimo, se è una rondine o un rondone puoi anche tirare un pò la pelle sotto il becco per farglielo aprire.<br>  <br>  Conta che gli uccellini sono delicatissimi in questa fase di vita, e se pure morirà non fartene colpe perchè in natura la selezione naturale è una realtà di sempre, d'altra parte le nidiate sono così numerose proprio perchè è "stabilito" che debbano esserci delle perdite. Comunque, se ne hai la possibilità, ti consiglio di cercare la sede LIPU più vicina a casa tua e portarglielo... perchè oltre a prendersi cura di lui 24 ore su 24 sapranno anche reinserirlo perfettamente in natura, cosa MOLTO problematica quando vengono allevati a mano =)<br>  <br>  Come ti ho già detto... se magari fai una descrizione del piccolo posso provare a capire cos'è... solitamente in questo periodo si trovano soprattutto tordi, merli e passeracei, e ciascuno ha le sue esigenze ^-^<br>  ______________________________________...<br>  <br>  Per come l'hai descritto potrebbe sembrare un verdone o un verzellino... vedi se somiglia a questo <a href="http://img80.imageshack.us/img80/5004/pullowz2.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img80.imageshack.us/img80/5004/pu...</a><br>  (le sopracciglia "irsute" che dici tu potrebbero essere semplicemente il piumino che hanno i pullini giovani prima di mettere completamente le piumette)<br>  <br>  in questo caso dovresti dargli da mangiare ogni 1 o 2 ore...la carne macinata in questo caso va bene giusto come cibo di emergenza, mentre il pasto migliore sarebbe il PASTONE PER GRANIVORI che puoi trovare nei negozi per animali ben forniti e nelle uccellerie (consigliata soprattutto ENERGETTE marca RAVASI, industria di mangimi speciali)<br>  Per la quantità devi dargli quella necessaria a riempire il gozzo (vedrai come "gonfiarsi" la base del collo, all'altezza del petto)<br>  Se è un verdoneo un verzellino va benissimo questo, in caso contrario fammi sapere =)|`|c9743f2abee4a111df6ec58bd9cd934daa	dagli delle goccioline di latte.. oppure portalo dal veterinario che hai più vicino..almeno lui potra' sicuramente essere più preparato di noi..|`|e4df87b9485dd6bb5fd03400ee020203aa	E' difficilissimo,il consiglio principe è il veterinario.<br>  Se non puoi prova con begattini o vermi di prato,ma se è piccolo come dici imboccalo|`|w32OBRFAaa	Portalo da un veterinario,lui sicuramante ti sapra aiutare.|`|135b2fc99056a235bbac0ed9b8e511f0aa	Allora è capitato anche a me e prima di tutto ti dico di non affezionarti troppo perchè a meno che non sia una gazza o un corvo è difficilissimo che sopravviva. Poi per alimentarlo bisogna essere in due: uno che apre delicatamente il becco  e l'altro che lo imbocca e lo tiene in mano. La carne io l'avevo mischiata con l'acqua un pò come negli omegeneizzati per chè è più facile per loro che di solito mangiano cibo rigurgitato dalla madre e quindi quasi già predigerito. Poi come c'è scritto nel sito della Lipu lascialo riposare in una scatola coi buchi perchè lì si trancquillizza.

She has made dough on me at times to the point she's broken my skin and given me a rash.

I asked the vet and she asked my how long had the cat nursed from the mom, had it been the full 6 to 8 weeks they required. I told her I didn't know, she said at that point that if he did not finish his weaning process that is what he was doing. She also said that he might not ever quit. That depends on the cat itself. It really won't hurt you, it is just very very annoying.

Or like blood? Is he fixed? Could the blood be coming from his testicles? <br>  <br>  Urinating blood is alarming and could have multiple causes, all of which need immediate attention. Without a urinalysis, you can't know if it's a bladder infection or not. With blood in the urine there are three likely sources -- from the bladder, from the kidneys and from a clotting disorder leading to generalized bleeding tendencies. <br>  <br>  Bleeding from the bladder usually occurs because of cystitis (bladder infection), bladder stones or bladder cancer. Bleeding from the kidneys can also be due to kidney infection, kidney stones or cancer affecting the kidney. In addition, traumatic injuries may lead to bleeding from the kidneys.<br>  <br>  My hope is that it's an infection ... or dyes or beets.<br>  It is a good idea to be going to the vet.

46181f764bb037eb34818a9404702b95aa	Your additional details were helpful.  Sometimes though, dogs' body language communication happens (and escalates) so quickly that we humans don't even notice it's happening (hence the people who say their dog bit "with no warning").  It could very well be that your boy noticed the other dog "eyeballing" him on the approach and took offense.  Postures are very important in dog communication and they notice it way more than we do... the other dog may have been making direct eye contact (challenge), walking with ears and tail errect and raised a bit in the front end.  These can all be interpreted as "I'm bigger and badder than you."  Unless they actually make contact and FIGHT this is usually just posturing only (think teenage boys).  The fact that he was humping already suggests that he has alot of confidence and may see himself with "alpha male" potential-- humping is not always a breeding behavior, it can also be a dominance display-- that's why you sometimes see a dog try to hump another of the same sex, not because they are confused or stupid.  Removal of sex hormones (neutering) can help dominance because it lessens sex drive and one of the rewards of being dominant is that you get to breed-- pretty big reward.<br>  <br>  Historically, the American Bulldog was bred for protection and guarding work, and their breed standard calls for a brave dog with heart and grit, so this is a breed that is going to be a bit quicker to take offense to the challenge of another dog.  Trainer Ceasar Millan on TV calls these decendants of the Roman Mastiff types (which include the mastiffs, bull terriers, boxers and even little Boston Terriers!) "gladiators", and this is a good way to think of them-- they are the "tough guys" of the dog world.  Please understand that I am a professional dog trainer of 25 years and have been working to stop a local ban on "pit-type" breeds-- and our uninformed locals include your breed among them-- so I am trying to let you know what I know based on breed type behavior, not offend you for owning this kind of dog.  I have always observed that well-socialized guard breeds usually have among the friendliest of personalities.  My best friend breeds Boxers, and I have often observed that they are quicker to take offense from challenging body postures, even from the dogs in thier own pack, than my retrievers and border collies are.  Just a different mindset!  If you are employed as a police officer or bodyguard, you're going to be a bit more paranoid about who's around you than if you're a shepherd in a remote location!<br>  <br>  I would continue to walk him as normal and make sure that you stay VERY calm and confident with him, as though it was a one-time fluke (it probably was).  If you tense up and are worried that he will be grouchy again, he will definitely sense that energy from you.  He doesn't know why you feel tense and paranoid, but he knows instinctively that those feelings mean trouble for his pack (you) and he will be keyed up to defend you and will be more likely to react aggressively again.  If he's a food hound or likes toys, take a pocketful of awesome treats (like cooked chicken) or his favoritest toy ever along.  If you see another dog approaching (far away- don't give him the chance to notice it or take offense)  start to distract him with the toy or give him treats as you approach and pass the other dog so that it is a positive and stress-free meeting.  You can set this up to practice if you have a friend with a low-key friendly dog that your dog already likes.<br>  <br>  He shouldn't be hurting almost 2 weeks after his surgery, but check to make sure his incision isn't inflamed or weeping, just to be sure he's not reacting grumpily due to discomfort.|`|6758dc0c55e667fcb0b68abe61c113e3aa	usually they defend a perimeter inwhich they were raised . maybe just didn't like the vibes given off by the other dog .|`|85b7c84c42449cdabb8ba670b64b803caa	i don't really know but maybe it's bacouse he smelled something not right in the other dog?:)|`|AA12283813	maybe your dog thought the other dog was trying to take over his territory or maybe to protect you? it could be  a number of things.|`|K3cz2zDCaa	Too many people get freaked out by barking/chasing to realize most actual attacks are silent and that most of the time dogs are working it our for themselves.  That being said however, MOST dogs are more "aggressive" on leash, even extremely well socialized dogs, for a couple of reasons.  Their 'flight' option is taken away, leaving only fight, as well most dogs tend to pull on the leash to see the other dog which inadvertently puts them into an aggressive stance, which could lead the other dog to believe they are more aggressive with their intentions than they are - provoking a response.  Think of how you would feel if someone came up to you yelling all the way - you wouldn't be in a very good mood would you?<br>  Another factor that goes into leash aggression is protection - they can be trying to protect you as well.<br>  The really really big problem with leash disagreements is that you can't let them work out themselves as more often than not the leashes tangle panicking the dogs and making it worse.<br>  <br>  Disagreements between dogs is loud and can be scary but most of the time (in off leash settings) it is settled with 10-15sec - actual fights will be silent as if barking/growling hasn't worked up to this point in avoiding a fight there is no need for it during a fight.<br>  <br>  I'm not condoning that you allow your dog to bully other dogs (nor am I saying thats what he's doing) but learning to watch other dogs and your own can lead you to learning to recognize and remove your dog from potentially aggressive situations.  In fact in this situation it sounds as though he is feeling vulnerable from the surgery (the sweetest dogs in the world can be agressive when injured or frightened)<br>  <br>  <br>  On a side note: A stat for all the people bad mouthing Pitbulls (which aren't American Bulldogs - merely related) - the dog breed that was reported in the most bites last year : GOLDEN RETRIEVER|`|ac617d38dbc581bd99c3181cf7b2d70eaa	Maybe because he tried to protect you because he...

What was the situation? Did you see it happen? A lot of times big dogs are insitgated by little dogs, the little dog is barking and growling, and egging the big dog on, but it is not seen as a threat. But when the big dog gets sick of the little dog and strikes back the big dog is 'attacking'. Is this what happened? <br>  <br>  If Your dog was the insitagtor I would take him back to obedience training so he learns that this is Unacceptable, and it will also help resocialize him with other dogs. I work at a vet clinic, and I have never seen a dog become aggressive toward other dogs soon after being neutered. And I would also keep him on a leash at all times when he is around other dogs that he does not know well. This is only because he is so big and powerful, and if he ever did bite another dog, Or human, for ANY reason he could do serious damage. I hope you find out what triggered your dog, and I hope it gets resolved. Good Luck.<br>  <br>  <br>  He may have just Not liked this particular dog.

iLxrVdWBaa	La specie-gatto è cresciuta e si è evoluta soprattutto in zone asciutte o desertiche (come l'antico Egitto): questo sarebbe il motivo per cui, secondo alcuni esperti, il nostro amico domestico non ama particolarmente l'acqua a differenza di altri felini, come la tigre.<br>  <br>  Ciò nonostante i gatti sanno stare a galla e, se vi sono costretti, possono anche rivelarsi ottimi nuotatori. Esistono inoltre alcune specie che rivelano una spiccata predisposizione per il contatto con l'acqua: come il norvegese (che secondo la tradizione era il gatto che teneva compagnia ai Vichinghi e cacciava i topi dalla stiva delle loro navi) o il Turkish van (un animale domestico a pelo lungo amante dell'acqua e proveniente dalla zona del lago di Van, nella Turchia orientale).|`|539092666d4e4398d6b300451aab4d88aa	credenza popolare...in realtà i gatti non hanno paura dell'acqua,anzi,la maggior parte di loro in casi di necessità è anche capacissima di nuotare.se si abituano da piccoli gli si può tranquillamente fare il bagno,io ne ho 4 e una volta al mese li lavo senza problemi,certo,non che siano contentissimi,però...nemmeno un cagnolino se non abituato se lo lascia fare volentieri. (eccetto alcuni cani realmente amanti dell'acqua,tipo labrador,terranova o simili) stesso dicasi per i corsi d'acqua...difficile che un gatto si tuffi in un lago per una nuotata,ma credo che nemmeno un barboncino o un chihuahua lo facciano volentieri...|`|c0b72988ce1bedd7c3eec04a9be1e6bdaa	perché nn sanno nuotare|`|BoJaWso5aa	Perché non ne hanno bisogno.

Hanno capacità di recupero sbalorditive, non c'è di che preoccuparsi. <br>  Non dovrebbe succedere, ma non ascoltare chi ti consiglierà di togliere soltanto l'utero e lasciare le ovaie perchè è un consiglio del tutto insensato. O togli tutto o non togli niente. <br>  Te lo dico perchè a me è capitato di trovare una gatta randagia che ho adottato e scoprire che qualcuno le aveva soltanto tolto l'utero. Le ovaie, disperse nell'addome, non erano più asportabili ed è andata incontro a una serie infinita di problemi.

Dopo l'intervento, se non riesci ad evitare che si lecchi e morda i punti o se non la puoi tenere sempre sotto controllo, puoi comprarle il collare "elisabettiano" (un collare a forma di cono inventato proprio per queste necessità).<br>  ritengo anch'io che sia meglio togliere sia utero che ovaie. Ho avuto una gatta a cui avevamo fatto togliere solo l'utero ed era una sofferenza vederla: ogni poco pensava di essere incinta ed era disperata perchè invece non aveva gattini da accudire.

This will irratate the membranes in his nose, which are very sensitive. You will have to renew this periodically, as wind and rain will remove it.|`|4ca1e9ef3fdf5eff8a28678ed072ab9daa	Put his poop in the holes it usually works you may have to do it alot or you can try a ballon but make sure if he pops the ballon that he doesn't swallow any of the broken pieces.|`|3d5b0daf71aeea109b4c7e30ef86a3dcaa	Get your dog his own sandbox to dig in.

You probably need to take a two pronged approach.  <br>  <br>  1st make sure your excercising your dog daily.<br>  <br>  2nd correct him only when you catch him digging.<br>  <br>  Your problem is probably that he's not getting enough exercise and or social contact.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|ztBKTBqFaa	Try putting Red or cyanne pepper where he is digging, it worked on my dogs .

3d5b0daf71aeea109b4c7e30ef86a3dcaa	It sounds to me like you want a cheap dog, and thats understandable, but it won't happen if you want a healthy dog. <br>  Breeders invest a lot of money to make the breed better so you will have a healthy dog. Read up on it and you will understand. <br>  So I would check the shelter, pound, petfinder.com and craigslist.org. Save a dogs life. It feels good! You can also check out adoption events in your area.|`|f9fb186e1c82bf7349b1e14dcbb1bcc4aa	You get what you pay for, you want cheap price you get crappy dog..<br>  Check the shelters and adopt a dog, BUT only if you can afford to feed and care for one properly.|`|NryJkB4Aaa	check the shelters, rescue groups and humane societies. try www.petfinder.com<br>  <br>  dont breed or buy while shelter pets die..|`|f1f350b5e12afceca116b6c2a67c3d68aa	I have 2 malteses that we rescued, they are now 5 years old. We got ours from petfinder.com. But as previously states no dog is cheap unless they aren't healthy. However, you will get a much cheaper dog from a rescue instead of a breader, but there is no garuntee that this dog will be a puppy. All dogs need homes, not just the puppies. Keep in mind that a dog is a huge commitment and malteses can live up to 18 years. Also, make sure that you have enough time and money to care for a maltese. They can be high matience and need to constantly be around people.
AyNt45joaa	vai in un centro di recupero animali è tipo un canile e prendi un gatto smarrito o abbandonato lo farai felice|`|jYsjvN2Caa	vai in un gattile, ne salvi uno e non spendi nulla ...|`|qOwsX45laa	Informati su dove si trova il " Gattile " della  tua città , Il gattile è una struttura contro il randagismo che recupera i gattini abbandonati o randagi , li vaccina , li sterilizza e li svermina . Poi li cede a titolo gratuito a chi si prende cura di loro . Io abito a Trento , il nostro gattile si chiama " Centro Felix " una decina di anni fa avevo preso una gattina rossa , dopo qualche mese , siccome in famiglia lavoriamo e i figli andavano a scuola tutto il giorno , ne abbiamo adottata un altra nera , in modo che si tenessero compagnia. Ora stanno benone ed è un piacere guardarle mentre si curano il pelo a vicenda  ! Ma ricordate che un animale non è mai un giocattolo da regalare ad un bambino ma una creatura di Dio da accogliere in casa con amore e rispetto , altrimenti è meglio lasciarlo dov 'è .|`|SSJaCe08aa	Beh, se amano tanto gli animali come dicono non toglieranno un micino alla sua mamma prima di 12 settimane di vita, oltre che proibito per legge è anche crudele, insomma ragionate!<br>  Se volete un micio che sia sano, affettuoso ed equilibrato, aspettate le 12 settimane, altrimenti potrebbe anche dare dei problemi tipo sporcare in giro per la casa e poi non dite che non siete stati avvisati.<br>  Comunque, al gattile o dai veterinari è pieno di gattini piccoli, desiderosi di una casa e sono gratis. <br>  Un' altra cosa molto importante, un gattin non è un giocattolo, appena arriva deve stare tranquillo e successivamente dev' essere presentato ai bambini di casa, insegnando loro a rispettarlo e trattarlo in modo delicato|`|a07786928cbf04adf65db5f28b26859aaa	Alla protezione animeli!!!!!

FVAp6HDKaa	I have heard that Great Danes are one of the best apartment dogs a person could get, as they really love being inside with you as a part of your "family", and don't do particulary well outside.  Before you get your heart set on any dog, however, you should really check with the leasing office at your apartment building or complex and see what their pet policy is.  Some apartments have weight restrictions, some charge an addtional monthly fee on top of your rent, and some apartments do not allow dogs at all.  I also have a particular love for rescue or shelter dogs, as there are so many loving dogs out there that need a forever home...   GOOD LUCK!!!|`|5RgXtxNzaa	AN OLDER LAB AT LEAST A FEW YEARS OLD, THEY FIT ANYWHERE.

As opposed to a chocolate or vanilla lab which need the space more than the Golden.

If you can't do that, no large breed dog is really going to work out for you.<br>  <br>  I liked the suggestion of getting an older dog that has lower exercise needs - that may be a feasible option.|`|GMhTfgGxaa	A good dog is a basset hound.

5718acfaae5c8b810d26ed311a3e9829aa	I make all my dogs food and before I got her, the mother was also made her food. Its called Biologically Appropriate Raw Food (BARF) there are lots of websites and books and even companies that make it for you and deliver it to your house. She has a beautiful coat, perfect weight (hard to do with labs), white teeth, no large smelly poop, and no anal gland issues. Vet initially was leery of it also but after reading his recommended food compared to what I was feeding her it pretty much was the same ingredients but mine was fresher and more diverse and after seeing her year after year he agrees with me. There is lots of information but I keep it short - Good Luck|`|qMVWYIyUaa	It's not the best idea. What type of food do you feed him? Do you add the broth because he won't eat his food by himself? I recommend Canidae and a lot of picky dogs will eat it.<br>  <br>  Your dog would probably live longer if you just gave him his regular food and dog treats. He's also more likely to get fat and have health problems if you give him chicken broth and boiled meat EVERY DAY.<br>  <br>  And it's true that it's not good to cook for dogs. Unless you know exactly the nutrients they need, you shouldn't be making the food for them yourself.<br>  <br>  I've heard the The Good Food Cookbook for Dogs is a good book, but I've never tried it myself.|`|c2a0eeec8c26b3b52a2439e6bcc8ae85aa	Since the dog food scare I have been doing this myself.

(3 we had before i was born) and we've fed them all normal human food.<br>  we broil chicken for them, use the broth, and give them chicken. they used to love cereal, they eat all human food, but its mixed in with dog food, which they eat in addition. It has never effected them..i had two shih tzus and they lived to 17. and then i had a great dane (average life is 8) he lived until he was 14. so i've never had a problem...<br>  <br>  hope that helps|`|RaqQX4zEaa	I would switch to fish oil instead of olive oil and make sure that the broth doesn't have any additives, other than that a little probably won't hurt.  The only bad thing is that they get spoiled and can become picky later on.|`|tj8LRw9Kaa	In light of all the dog food recalls, I did some research myself.  One web-site provided a recipe of  cooked ground turkey or beef, carrots, dry oatmeal & rice.  I also had previously added Missing Link (a vitamin supplement) to his dry food & I'm continuing to add this to the "new" recipe.  My little guy seems to like his new diet so far. Also one diet suggested to add garlic (for its flea ridding properties) also adds to the taste.

5eSSAT69aa	My Uncle Earl would do it for a six pack of beer and a couple of old Playboys.|`|LIUsQtLqaa	Has your dog passed away, or are you wanting to do this to a living animal?<br>  <br>  It's done to game animals, post mortem of course, all the time. <br>  A taxidermist should be able to do it for anywhere from 100-300 dollars, even less if it is a small shop. I'd check with taxidermists in your area.|`|eyZhiXYpaa	Sorry but I think this is pretty sick.<br>  <br>  Let the dog RIP (I assume it's already dead otherwise what type of a monter would you be).<br>  <br>  I'm not sure that your stocking a full deck.|`|Z9zzNYNCaa	TAXIDERMISTS do that.<br>  CALL around.|`|NWTfFEuVaa	Hopefully your dog would be dead before any of this happened. A taxidermist person would do it, those are people who stuff animals and all that.  I don't know how much it would cost because I personally have never had it done or know anyone who has had it done.|`|sUXyRlVjaa	Say What!?|`|PeoOb4aHaa	I agree with Slutina.  Your best bet is to hire an "at home taxidermist."
jOdzofOAaa	Yes, that'll be fine, especially if you are getting two, as they'l always be in company then. Rescue centres normaly visit your home to do a check of the home in general before allowing the dog to be handed over. I have a lab, and he's slept outside most nights, when we've had handymen in the house etc, he's 13 now, fit as a fiddle(though that may be more to do with all the walkies he gets taken on:) ). Have to admit though we're a bit soft and let him stay in, in his basket if its chilly, especially now he's getting old, bless :) Though by the sound of it your kennel is going to be super-luxurious with lamp heater. Pens need to have seperate areas for sleeping(this needs to be deep enough for the dogs to retreat back if they get scared and for general comfort.), and an oudoor exercise area. They need a solid wood floor, with a non-slip finish.It should be sealed so draught free and they will need warm bedding, and perhaps extra in the cooler months. The roof will need waterproofing too an your best looking for the dryest piece of land to put it on(or even better concrete) with all the flood we've been having recently, plus it will last much longer then. The tiles may need powerwashing every half year to spruce it up, and we have a window in ours so we can leave it open in the summer months. <br>  <br>  The only real requirements is that you check the area is safe, eg. fencing secure, no sharp machinery they could stumble on in the area. I'm sure the dogs will have a lovely time, especially with all the daytime exercise and enrichment. If you think about it, its a much better arrangement than all the people who leave their poor dogs all day in the house with nothing to do, take them on one walk, if they're lucky and then either ignore or feed them tip bits n what not the rest of the evening. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps :)|`|KuUx34hCaa	if you have this room can you fence off a 1/2 acre for them AND you want to make sure the dog would be fine with your horse & live stock what ever you do but it should be just fine I normally don't like kennels as most people for get their dogs other then feed them how ever with your situation & knowing how farms are it would me fine|`|GaLw1qMwaa	I dont think its fair to them to be outside 24/7. Dogs need love and attention just as much as children. They will wonder why you wont allow them to be part of your pack. <br>  <br>  Just put the kennels inside your home. Designate them an area.<br>  Use baby gates and give one on one training until the dogs understand you mean what you say.<br>  <br>  I can talk to my dog in full sentences and  she knows exactly what i mean. Not to mention they know when you have a  bad day and like their bellies scratched!<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: Every situation has an exception: You seem to be outdoor more than you are indoors so now I understand what you are saying. Sounds like the dogs will have a good life, good for you.|`|ad09a262eea23aed99f3309da57c67c5aa	Many dogs do well outside in a kennel as long as they are given good attention on a daily basis.  I see many kenneled dogs who IMHO are on the virge of being neglected.  They are in their kennel 24/7 with no or little human interaction.  Others I have seen belong to caring owners and have a lot of dog human interaction.  Sounds like the dog would get a lot of interaction in your household.  Whether you can get a rescue dog depends on your rescue centre and their requirements.  It won't hurt to ask.|`|qTfju2ggaa	I personally dont disagree with kennelling dogs. You are obviously really passionate about dogs as you are willing to provide to provide safe, secure housing and have lots of love to offer.<br>  Have you considered re homing greyhounds or ex-working lurchers. Many of these dogs have been raised in kennels and would not have to go through re-adjusting to life indoors. I have an ex-racing grey and a rescue lurcher, they are lovely creatures, great with kids, need minimum exercises and contrary to popular belief they are totally cat friendly.<br>  Have a chat to your local shelters and see how they would feel about you re homing a dog into kennels, I'm certain many will be fine.<br>  Good luck!|`|TSc8OE4vaa	Kenneling dogs is fine, as long as they have shelter and are taken out regularly.  I don't know if a rescue would let you adopt dogs but a shelter definitely would.|`|iVQULHqYaa	You obviously love dogs and can provide excellent accommodation for them. My fears would be that if you adopt two older dogs that do not know each other is that they might fight. I would also worry about the children.<br>  <br>  Rescue homes are desperate for their dogs to be re homed. Unfortunately they have not enough time to observe and assess them regardless of how much that they care.<br>  <br>  You care about dogs and I know that you  have thought this through. Any rescue society will welcome you with open arms, however they care more about their dogs then the problems that you may encounter. They want people like you.<br>  <br>  If you can get two dogs which have come from the same family it would be fantastic. If not, I think that at the outset and because of the children, you should adopt just one. Get the first dog settled and then after a few weeks get another.<br>  <br>  Go for it, I am sure that you can give rescue dogs a fantastic life.|`|c2c3a447ca6a35c94ffed12e17bf8913aa	Why not get in touch with some rescue centers and see what they think or if they have ideas of what type of problem dogs they have that would be suited to this enviroment.<br>  Seems like you would get much better feedback.|`|49ec8e0944023c0f5c20e37484f16366aa	Many rescues stipulate the dog is to be kept as an indoor dog, not left outdoors, even in a kennel run as you describe.<br>  <br>  add:  I do understand your question.  Many rescue centers have policies that they're unwilling to bend, having a dog kenneled outdoors may be one of them.  It depends on the specific rescue.|`|9kTejB0uaa	If the accommodation you are describing is truly as you describe, I'd not see a problem, provided the two you get are adults and not fine coated and maybe used to living out (actually can I move in?) already.  I think you need to talk to the Rescue people, and see how they feel about this.  I'd say most would be only too happy to let you have them, but you never know.  Some Centres are more apparently picky than others (reasonably so really because they are entitled to be concerned that they place their dogs with the right people).<br>  <br>  Personally I prefer to have my dogs in with me, but it sounds as if you are prepared to go the extra mile to be with them during the day etc.?|`|JM4Uiunqaa	Not to be rude or anything, but why do you want a dog? I have nothing against keeping dogs outside, but it sounds like you have your hands full taking care of 3 kids, several horses and 10 acres, in addition to the dogs you already have. Will the dog be working in any way? Why not wait a couple years until the kids can actually help you out with the dog/horses/property? Even if the dog isn't going to leave your yard very often, you still need to socialize and train it properly, and training is not a one-off deal. Puppy class when the dog is 12-20 weeks are not enough for its entire life and the same applies to socialization. Besides that, most rescues will not release dogs to homes where they will be kept outside, no matter how well you plan to take care of them. They don't necessarily have anything against outside dogs, but are concerned that the dog will become a case of "out of sight, out of mind." Many times that's how the dog got to the rescue in the first place, so you can understand their reluctance to release dogs into a similar arrangement, even if you plan to take excellent care of the dog.<br>  <br>  EDIT: I reminded you of the necessity of socialization because you gave no indication of planning to take them anywhere off your property. In fact, you gave the usual yard/property description of someone who plans to keep the dog only on their land, so you can hardly be mad if someone makes that assumption. Again, I did not mean to be rude in asking why you wanted a dog, I simply wanted you to think about why you really want one or two before getting them. Once more, it sounded for all the world like they would never leave your yard, so I did not think the question out of line. I am sorry you felt the need to be so defensive. <br>  <br>  The fact remains, that the vast majority of rescues and shelters will not put dogs in homes where they will be outside dogs.

But as they get older they do like veg. more than locusts or mealworms. When I'm putting salad in her tank she just dashes over to where I'm putting it. Also, eating insects is a natural life cycle for bearded dragons.
46181f764bb037eb34818a9404702b95aa	I agree on the vet visit.  She may be vomiting due to eating grass if she's outside, and sometimes they eat grass because their stomach is upset.  You'll want to rule out any illnesses causing her symptoms.  If you think there's a chance she's been bred the vet can do an exam and ultrasound to confirm.  Do you know when she was last in heat?  Have you had a lot of sneaky neighbor dogs "comin' courting"?  If she is pregnant, you'll want to be able to pinpoint a potential due date, so this info will help your vet.  If your vet confirms she's not pregnant, I'd make an appointment to spay her right away.  Puppies are a huge responsibility and expense, and many end up dying in shelters.  Huskies are an intellegent and independent breed and people don't understand them, so they have lots higher numbers of abandoned dogs.  She'll also be healthier-- spaying cuts the risk of mammary tumors and other female health issues.  If the operation seems out of your budget, check with your vet and local shelters for low-cost or free spay/neuter programs.  One shelter 2 counties away from me does a female Husky sized dog for $40!  It's even worth the gas money to drive that far for the surgery savings (she'd be $140 at my vet!)!  No income or residency restrictions!  And that's all they do, so they are REALLY good at it-- quick recovery times.  Local to me there's also a traveling hospital bus that does spay/ neuter at low cost for all and a shelter that offers vouchers for low cost surgery based on income.|`|4c2b4b3698607bc95dd331438404d7e8aa	You take her to the vet to see what's wrong, then you get her spayed, pronto! That's by far the best way to take care of her. How can you have no idea whether your own dog is pregnant? What kind of owner are you?|`|AA11962729	take her to the vet! i've never heard of a dog vomiting because of pregnancy|`|6m3qVS6jaa	How long have you had the dog? The first thing you should have done when you got her was take her to the vet. That way you would have known how she was from the beginning. She has to get spayed...(fixed, so that she cannot get pregnant). But she also needs shots. The fact that you have never taken her to the vet scares me. This could be any number of puppy ailments that could have been prevented with shots. A dog is a huge responsibility and takes a lot of work. They need to have immunizations and check-ups just like a human baby. Please get her to a vet as soon as possible. This is not something to play around with. If she is throwing up, she is sick. And if she is sick, she needs a doctor. <br>  Please be responsible for your baby!|`|X5Ll5G8Jaa	... she might be sick if she's vomiting... you should take her to the vet if that keeps up much longer.|`|f8a3e1916a1358a55f2e47b7e870da88aa	first be responsible, if you don't know the answer to your question you need to have your dog spayed.  you can schedule an appointment with your vet as soon as you talk to them about her vomiting and not feeling well or as you said lazy.  it is never normal for a husky to be lazy.  they are very active dogs.  and with the vomiting added, your dog needs to go see the vet.  after your vet says she's healthy please please please have her spayed.  it's in her best interest.|`|eoLWCic9aa	take her to the vets very quickly if still unwell to be on save side

Since all of my kitties have gone to the bridge, can I weigh in with a canine stash secret?  Shelby has her own blankie on my bed, & when she doesn't eat all of a treat, she "buries" it in or under her blankie, or under one of the pillows. I'll be typing something & hear her going to town, digging at my bath robe, her blankie, whatever, & I'll stop & say "HEY!  Easy!"  She'll look up at me with some little remnant in her mouth as if to say, "WHAT?!" Then keep on going.  Sometimes she takes so long that I end up helping her by moving my bathrobe for her (which is actually HER bathrobe ever since she claimed it one night when she was sick.)  I wash her blankie at least once a week & every time I pick it up 3 or 4 former treats fall out of it.  I had one kitty (Chelsea) who used to stash little toys in my shoes.|`|gjrbp1Aoaa	lol cute<br>  <br>  Mine don't seem to hide things, they prefer to spread messes.

Weirdos. <br>  All morning they've been extra busy knocking things over, I haven't even bothered to total up all the damage yet. They're all napping now, apparently worn out from the destruction. I kind of wish they'd have some sense of organization but then I think that might creep me out. It would help if Indy kept track of his toys.  He loves to play fetch and he gets very whiny if you don't have one of his favorite toys to throw for him.|`|LzXZQBHbaa	LOL...that is too cute! My one cat likes to take wet wash clothes from the shower and bring them to me. Once he dragged a 5lb bag of potatoes to me in bed, in the middle of the night. He's done that with bread too. We don't keep that stuff where he can get to them anymore...lol. He doesn't stash his stuff anywhere, he just brings it to me...lol!|`|eKOgRHa6aa	Aw! Actually Marshall doesn't have a stash neither did my other cat milo. Although I've seen my sisters cat pick up a tied up plastic bag and run away with it, it was the strangest thing I've ever seen lol|`|kZrZCPRMaa	My cat doesn't do that she <br>  just has a messy area of toys that i clean up all the time(:|`|wrhG6b1laa	my cat likes to collect our socks. we keep finding  a huge pile of them under the furniture. it drives us crazy.|`|kIpDDVc9aa	Aww! That must be SO cute! :)|`|35f126768433fb7bc9a5037cf6657dbcaa	t'pring keeps her stash behind the armorer, all the pony tailers she steals from my lovely and talented wife. she jumps up on the vanity and takes them right out of her hand and runs into the living room and goes behind the armorer where "mommy" can't get her.|`|SOxdyWQOaa	awwww Jazz stash of cloths and towels is under the bed at least I know where all my towels went|`|AQsiugSpaa	Hi Pretty Kitty!<br>  Great question!!  LOL.<br>  <br>  Of course my cats won't share their secrets with me, otherwise their "stash" would not be private. However, this being said, I did a little detective work in order to answer your question honestly <grin> and found a huge number of those crinkle ball cat toys on the bottom shelf of their cat tree. I think that they leave them there so they know where to find them a lot more easily than under the fridge.<br>  <br>  However, it is possible that my cleaning lady gathers them from all over the house and puts them there so they can find them:) <G><br>  <br>  My cats do stash little rolled up balls of paper in the master bathroom, however. They carry them in their mouths around the house.. and now I know where they are.  <br>  <br>  Please don't tell them that I am onto their secret.. ok?<br>  <br>  Troublesniffer<br>  Owned by cats for over 40 years<br>  Member Cat Writer's Association|`|DtkLsetkaa	Mine don't have a stash, at least not on purpose.  Due to hard wood floors and the tile in the kitchen, toys tend to "slide" under the couch, fridge, oven, bookcase, and desks.  That's where i find all of them.  They aren't doing it on purpose lol..........  Unless I haven't found the stash yet.  Oh god.  I am cleaning my house tonight.|`|bc1af16c01f9baa9730a6de2c0ca235caa	always seems to be right next to the litter box...Allie's so crazy lol|`|5f6fbccb8643408cbd62a8431b3e5c44aa	my pets just hide their favorite bits of food in their bed.|`|Ka3fbxszaa	One of my boys LOVES to steal the dog's food! He'll take several pieces at a time, bat 'em around for awhile and eventually make his way down to the extra bedroom in the basement. He slides them under the closed door and later waits for me to open it. He's got quite a pile going!!|`|Rw7gi86Naa	Haha. Under the bed. Also there are probably about a hundred water bottle caps stuck behind the fridge and washing machine.|`|UNFxjNHkaa	mine really dont hide their toys... they organize... Well, Luigi organizes.  He organizes all of the animals toys..<br>  <br>  He puts ziggy's toys next to her water bowl and he puts Jazzy's toys next to her food dish and he keeps his toys in a nice straight line next to his water bowl..<br>  <br>  so adorable!|`|tnTxHVO5aa	I told you yesterday were Pablo's "stash" is :/<br>  <br>  Whitey has a stash of socks under our bed.<br>  Stormie steals McKenzie's blocks and hides them in her closet.|`|AA10859773	My girls don't do this.

zPQCipoBaa	Chi l'ha detto che il gatto non si affeziona al padrone?! <br>  Questo è uno stupidissimo luogo comune messo in giro da chi non ha mai avuto gatti. <br>  Avere un gatto non significa dargli un po' di croccantini e via andare, avere un gatto significa accarezzarlo e coccolarlo e dargli amore e calore. <br>  Ti assicuro che chi ama il suo gatto ne è riamato con altrettanta passione. <br>  Il mio gatto (che mi protegge dall'alto dell'avatar) mi "chiama" letteralmente da una stanza all'altra perchè vada a fargli le coccole e se non sono abbastanza sollecita tira fuori una voce dell'altro mondo come se stesse per tirare le cuoia così io accorro allarmatissima e lui mi accoglie serafico buttandosi a pancia all'aria. <br>  I miei gatti fanno le fusa solo a GUARARLI! <br>  Ci ho fatto perfino una poesia. <br>  Quanto all'amare la casa, sfatiamo un mito. <br>  I gatti (e tutti gli animali in genere) non amano la casa, semplicemente odiano i cambiamenti. <br>  Perfino la mia tartaruga odia che le cambi ambiente e quando, per qualche motivo, devo tenerla isolata cerca ostinatamente di tornare dov'era prima. <br>  Essere abitudinari è istintivo nei nosrti animali. <br>  In natura conoscere a menadito l'ambiente in cui si vive spesso fa la differenza fra vivere e morire. <br>  Perchè per i gatti dovrebbe essere diverso? <br>  <br>  Ma tu, Vale, non preoccuparti. <br>  Tu prenderai un micino che vedrà per sempre in te la sua mamma e sarai tu la sua casa. <br>  Ti amerà da morire e ti darà infinite soddisfazioni. <br>  Ma NON prenderlo di poche settimane! <br>  Deve restare con la sua mamma per tre mesi prima di poterne essere separato (credo che il limite siano 85 giorni), altrimenti sarà un soggetto inquieto e pauroso e allora, sì, che sarebbe un problema portarlo in giro. <br>  <br>  Vuoi un animale tranquillo, sereno, equilibrato? <br>  Non portarlo via dalla sua mamma prima del tempo.|`|H3YXX7NXaa	il gatto ha bisogno di un posto dove vive sempre...per lui è molto stressante e forse anche qualcosina di più spostarlo da una parte all'altra....una volta che si affeziona a un posto non penso che abbia voglia di cambiarlo....per te che viaggi molto te lo sconsiglio....però puoi provare con qualche altro animale...|`|rdCRU31Baa	io credo che puoi farcela..in fondo a loro basta l'amore...la stabilità non è cosa da poco, ma se sarai capace di non fargli mancare nulla...io ti consiglio di prenderlo....<br>  <br>  scusa se mi impiccio...ma quale meraviglioso lavoro ti permette di viaggiare tanto?????????|`|v1YckIUQaa	Anke io e il mio compagno avevamo lo stesso problema!(Noi + ke altro c spost in Europa)Ora ke da 5 mesi siamo in Inghilterra abbiamo preso 2 gatti e l'intenzione è d farli venire con noi in ogni spostamento futuro x questo hanno già il passaporto e sono già vaccinati e saranno presto sterilizzati.Noi li adoriamo e nn gli facciamo,nè gli faremo mancare nulla.C danno tanta gioia ke c rifiutiamo d separarcene x lungo tempo!!Prendine uno!|`|AG3mdqVpaa	Il gatto non si affezziona al padrone ma all'ambiente in cui vive...Se gli cambi luogo spesso, secondo me, ne risentirá parecchio...evita! Ciao!|`|D0Km6o7Laa	Ciao!! Credo che tu lo possa prendere senza problemi. E' vero che i gatti sono abbastanza "territoriali" e si legano di più alla casa che al padrone ma con le dovute cure e maniere sono sicura che tu ce la possa fare!! A patto però che non cambi casa tutti i giorni  :)   perchè cmq hanno un tempo di ambientazione abbastanza lungo (che però probabilmente varia anche dal carattere del gatto). Ad esempio quando ho traslocato un paio di anni fa la mia gatta ha "strisciato" per casa per una settimana e del giardino non ne voleva proprio sapere... dopo un paio di settimane era la reginetta del quartiere e adesso credo che sia leader indiscusso perchè fa a botte continuamente con tutti i gatti dei vicini... :)  Scherzi a parte secondo me non ci sono problemi. Facci sapere. Baci!|`|VbykdLXsaa	Io credo che i gatti sono animali sedentari, che amano il loro territorio. Credo che sarebbe davvero stressante per loro stare dietro al tuo stile di vita. Poi hai pensato ai lunghi viaggi aerei? I gatti dovrebbero stare in una gabbietta piccola, senza poter uscire. Forse non te li farebbero portare nemmeno come bagaglio a mano e sarebbero costretti a stare in una stiva. Poi ci sono alcuni padroni di casa che non vogliono animali. Sarebbe davvero troppo problematico.|`|Yx73zECpaa	Se vai in altri contineneti potresti avere grossi problemi a trasferirlo con te a seconda delle leggi dei paesi dove devi andare.|`|ZhNAo5f6aa	dovrai fare in modo che si attacchi molto a te!! ma non ci vorrà molto!! se lo prendi piccolo, si abituerà benissimo, dovrai essere paziente perchè il gatto sente molto il cambiamento dell'ambiente, devi stargli molto vicino ed essere paziente, il suo nervosismo nei e dopo i viaggi sarà normale e tu dovrai coccolarlo molto!!<br>  avrai capito che avrà bisogno di molte attenzioni e spero che tu sarai capace di occuparti di questo coinquilino!!! <br>  in bocca al lupo!|`|m9scHnPHaa	secondo me è possibile che un gatto si abitui a viaggiare. importante è prendersi cura di lui e rispettarlo. poi non è che questi cambiamenti ci sono ogni giorno.  ogni tanto il mio gatto viaggia con me ed.....è bravissimo!|`|p1cslWD5aa	Bhe avere un animale domestico è sicuramente una responsabilità...però se ti ritieni in grado di farcela PERCHè NO?! In fondo nei tuoi viaggi avrai bisogno di un compagno. Quando andrai nel negozio di animali fatti consigliare la razza che può soffrire meno durante gli spostamenti, quella che li sopporta meglio. E poi se ci pensi tutte le star di hollywood hanno un animale e se lo portano ovunque nei loro viaggi... :-)<br>  Buona fortuna!!!!!|`|wDjYYdJFaa	1 ki dice ke 6 na vera ragazza?? dalle foto nn se po d xkè sono ingannevoli....x il gatto invece te diko fattelo se popo nn c'hai niente da fa...anke se a me piace + er cane|`|7bc852bb0c421dcf6cac5b7517f5d0e4aa	Certo che puoi, devi però scegliere una razza tranquilla sin dalla prima infanzia. Dovresti quindi subito scartare tipetti come l'Europeo o il Siamese. Da scartare anche, secondo me, gatti a pelo lungo che richiedono una toelettatura molto attenta e costante. C'è poi da tener presente se tu lavori in casa o fuori.  Comunque se oltre a spostamenti frequenti, passi fuori casa le classiche 8 ore lavorative più quelle per lo svago, ti puoi orientare sui British o sui Certosini. Mentre se il tuo lavoro si svolge in casa, l'ottimale è un Devon Rex o uno Sfinx.<br>  Augurissimi per i viaggi, il lavoro e il futuro compagno-micio!!!!|`|43c74cf27f89a4cc03b7cf5cde313349aa	I gatti quando li' ami amano il padrone e non la casa l'importante e' che non te ne' disfi mai e lo tieni per tutta la sua vita con te.
bdd5826a6800474ffdac98e299408f6aaa	Vou satisfazer sua curiosidade sobre os gatos cairem sempre sobre as patinhas:  <br>  Tudo tem  início dentro do ouvido interno do gato , onde um sinal é transmitido ao cérebro informando a posi??o exata da cabe?a em relac?o ao solo...e isso é t?o rapido, que em fra??es de segundos, ele eleva a cabe?a  e gira,  depois a  coluna gira e a parte traseira do corpo seguem o movimento, de modo que num instante todo o corpo do gato se posiciona corretamente para cair em pé!E a cauda funciona como um contrapeso nesse movimento todo!Mas é claro que nem sempre eles conseguem cair em seguran?a, porque mesmo caindo na patinhas podem sofrer fraturas...<br>  <br>  Um abra?o da Minerva|`|aBl4bLJ0aa	joca, eu acho que é porque, o gato é muito ágil,e consegue na hora da queda se virar a tempo de ficar em pé! boa defesa, n?o é?bjusssss|`|Oklz3XDPaa	acho que os caes tb.|`|WF7y8kbvaa	é uma forma de se defenderem.|`|aHc5VjMcaa	Isso que vocês faziam n?o é muito legal... mas eles sempre caem no ch?o de pé porque eles tem um senso de equilíbrio, que ajuda a se virar. O rabo é muito importante desta 'virada'. Tanto que se tu segurar as 4 patas mais o rabo e soltar, ele n?o vai conseguir se virar. Mas isso também depende da altura que ele cair.|`|mYQMfJkYaa	Porque eles s?o muito ágeis e sempre se conseguem dobrar e virar a tempo de aterrarem com as patas no ch?o. Isso se deve ao facto das vertebras deles estarem mais afastadas que as nossas e ainda pelo facto de as omoplatas n?o estarem ligadas a coluna vertebral por tend?es, que limitariam o seu movimento...<br>  <br>  Beijo.|`|28a2fe2ead60a7d393298c2c5bc9238eaa	O gato é um animal muito ágil. no caso de queda, SE HOUVER ESPA?O E TEMPO PARA ESSA MANOBRA, ele, com a ajuda do rabo, torce o corpo para que ele se vire e caia de pé. é uma maneira de evitar fraturas, já que os gatos andam sobre os dedos, e n?o sobre os pés como os humanos, e o impacto fica minimizado a alguns ossos.<br>  Se cair de de grande altura, certamente cairá em pé, mas se cair com a boca aberta (seja para respirar ou miar por socorro), seus órg?os internos se arrebentam e, devido a hemorragia, ele morre, e de uma morte horrível... :(<br>  Agora, se alturas menores, tipo, dois andares de prédio, de cima de um roupeiro, ele sempre conseguirá se equilibrar novamente, sem danos a saúde. Se vc tem gatos e mora em apto, por favor, coloca telas nas janelas, gato é muito distraído, e pode correr atras de uma mosca e despencar. Se for mais de 2 andares... ele corre risco de vida...|`|b94b3d66b0685b69ffcdc638097c214eaa	Se uma pessoa cair,ela tambem vai tentar cair de pé,pode acontecer de se esborrachar a cara no ch?o.Sendo que os gatos caem de pé,porque tem mais agilidade para se virar.|`|byUof04laa	gatos s?o animais que tem  reflexo rápido,por isso s?o rápidos assim.gato é tudo de bom!!!!|`|cd7d5ebada310ac519ed5fecfcc347adaa	pq ele é um felino esperto.|`|idUOWa17aa	puro reflexo!, ou seja se o animal estiver atento ele cai certinho sem se machucar.<br>  <br>  obs: nao tenta fazer essa experiencia em casa.|`|j0SS94Y7aa	Maudade o que você fazia heim...kkkkk, eles tem um reflexo muito bom daí ajustam o corpo e caem em pé, se você tivesse tentado jogar eles de uma altura pequena n?o cairiam de pé mas de costas ou amarrasem as patas daí com certeza cairiam de costas <br>  <br>  *Eu gosto muito de animais, n?o fa?a o que eu falei, eu apenas quis explicar esse mito|`|r90HqO7Oaa	n?oooooooooooo, vc n?o viu madagascar?|`|zhJIuJTRaa	que cruel....<br>  tática

5PWzxw4Xaa	Dog Trainer 30 plus years -<br>  Yes love, I believe that you are taking the right steps to reinforce making a healthy "pack" with two dogs that are not identical in personality.  I have done this as well through the years & they just seem to accept one anothers differences as they accept the ground will be under them when they step off the porch...a very natural "not have to think about it" way.  You seem very wise when it comes to dogs so with that said...<br>  I wish you FUN!!  Both types of dogs will give you a variety of temperament...but watch how they learn to "teach" each other what they feel strongly about because of their instinct.  It is amazing to watch and an honor to be a part of.  It's like they file off the rough edges of one another without confrontation...just by example.  It is remarkable what they do without being taught to do it.  I am amazed every day by their ability teach whether it's one another or the humans around them.|`|aCqSF87Raa	It depends on where you're getting them from, i guess. I hope you plan on buying from a responsible breeder and not a pet store or BYB? <br>  <br>  Dogs bought from a responsible breeder will be more likely to get along as those dogs are only bred from Ch titled animals with excellent personalities and temperaments. I don't know if a reputable breeder would like the thought of "two puppies at once" especially if they are two different breeds, though...<br>  <br>  It WOULD be possible to go one at a time if, in the end, that's what you have to do. Get the Malamute first and socialize that dog properly. When it reaches a year old or so, go around to Chow breeders and look for a pup that would mesh with the Malamute. A pup would be easy enough to socialize with a well trained adult and a breeder would help match the pup to the adult without much trouble.<br>  <br>  Remember that even though certain things are common traits amongst breeds, they are NOT a given in each individual dog. I've seen super friendly Chows (sure, not a LOT... but they are out there) and i've seen super aggressive Chows. Plus, proper training and socialization can change certain traits - like the guarding trait in the Chow, which can be combated with proper training.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|oRzqWhsDaa	We have raised chows and with their dominance issues I wonder about mixing them with other dogs.  Chows are very much a guard dogs and not very friendly with people they don't know.  But this is your choice I would  personally go with a lab to go with the other dog or a retriever that would be a great personality mix this is just a opinion good luck|`|sUXyRlVjaa	Not a good idea!  Please re-consider.  Both are great breeds in the right hands but both have a tendency towards dog aggression, especially same sex aggression.|`|Z9zzNYNCaa	Really really REALLY *BAD* IDEA!!!!|`|HgMFrllLaa	You will be sorry.|`|G3Yn5nGFaa	It is probably a good idea but if they are puppy's and not potty trained<br>  that would probably be a bad idea

1d3b27dd26b77a993a4a2a635dde80cbaa	Eu n?o gosto de peixe como animal de estimar?o, mas n?o me importo com as pessoas que gostam!!<br>  <br>  TT|`|bdd5826a6800474ffdac98e299408f6aaa	Oie, eu também acho, algumas pessoas ainda tem aquários grandes e bem cuidados, mas muitos mantem vários peixes confinados em um vidro minúsculo, tenho muita pena de ver como eles ficam sem liberdade, as vezes um peixe fica perseguindo o outro e eles n?o tem nem como fugir, ou se esconder...que vidinha mais triste...<br>  <br>  <br>  beijinhoooo|`|5ee2ced374f4d7784c8a9c7e4aaa680faa	melhor do que gato que enche de pelo em tudo que é lufgar, ate na comida na cozinah ta doido|`|63fe74b904a76c75b3a0a873a801cf5aaa	Fa?o das suas palavras, minhas!!! Odeio peixes, s?o feios e fedidos!|`|UXL7hJ7Laa	PABLO, se gato enche de pêlo, você enche de cabelo! E sinceramente, muito mais limpo é o pelinho sedoso dos meus filhinhos. Mas ent?o, o legal de ter um peixe é cuidar dele, do aquário, se dedicar a isso por prazer e poder admirar sua beleza e seus movimentos graciosos.|`|df7d9c3f175c575e152792cee2ef9a12aa	A aquariofilia além de combater o stress, propicia o estudo da vida aquática com a reprodu??o de peixes, plantas e outros organismos aquáticos.|`|1d8a208767adf7306e54164a1768ea7aaa	Interessante sua pergunta...<br>  <br>  Realmente depende de gosto.  Eu adoro animais de estima??o.  Todos.  Sempre gostei muito de cachorro, mas minha esposa n?o gosta, porque faz barulho, faz sujeira, dá trabalho... Ent?o ela sugeriu um aquário, e eu pensei a mesma coisa que você: “Que gra?a tem um aquário??” Depois pensei: " é melhor do que nada..." rs...<br>  <br>  Olha, posso te dar dezenas de raz?es para ter um... Primeiro que um aquário bem cuidado é um enfeite lindíssimo para sua sala.  Também é muito relaxante, você chega estressado do trabalho, toma um banho, senta em frente ao aquário e fica olhando, dá uma paz, uma tranqüilidade que você n?o imagina... Você coloca um peda?o da natureza na sua casa, tenta reproduzir todo o meio ambiente em que as espécies que vc cria vivem... E quando vc come?a a ver o resultado, como ver os peixes crescendo, com cores fortes, tendo filhotes aos montes, é uma satisfa??o enorme... E outra, você acaba aprendendo muita, mas muita coisa de química, biologia, respeito à natureza, etc.  é lógico que eu n?o estou falando sobre aqueles aquários lotados de peixe, com plantas de plástico, pedrinhas coloridas e com aqueles mergulhadores soltando bolhinhas... Isso realmente é tosco, mas aquários bem montados, com troncos, plantas naturais, realmente remontando o ambiente natural dos peixes, é lindo de se ver... E n?o dá tanto trabalho assim como parece, garanto que dá menos trabalho que um cachorro... Você pode viajar que o aquário fica lá, n?o precisa levar ao veterinário nem dar vacina (você é o veterinário), n?o faz barulho, n?o faz sujeira, n?o precisa de quintal... Enfim, quem entra nesse hobby vicia e dificilmente sai.<br>  <br>  PS.: Ainda pretendo ter meu cachorro quando tiver um espa?o legal para criá-lo como deve ser, mas meus aquários me satisfazem demais.<br>  <br>  Abra?os.|`|40d7dd844b9e77282b954dac74415fafaa	Eu n?o tenho pq n?o gosto de ter bichinhos trancados em gaiola, aquário etc..<br>  Mais n?o vejo problema nenhum em alguem gostar, eu por exemplo tenho um cachorro, tem gente que n?o acha gra?a de ter um cachorro!<br>  Cada um tem o seu gosto!!!<br>  <br>  bjs?|`|GFvMhF9Zaa	quando vc observa o aquario vc consegue eliminar o stress alem de  ser bonito. acalma vc, faz com que vc tipo seje um peixe, ah e vc pode por o disiners(naum sei se eh assim que escreve)que vc quiser<br>  eh legal....|`|KgmR4A0Faa	Se eu quiser GRA?A eu assisto o Panico na TV,A Pra?a é Nossa,Zorra Total etc...Aquário é para quem gosta de admirar algo belo,sacou?|`|RKnoT2bTaa	concordo com a raquel  e o luis ;) ter um aquario e algo mesmo belo e k acalma mt vc !! :)|`|c7OvG6Graa	é legal e muito melhor do que ter um gato ou um hamister.|`|j5I2GeEraa	Algumas pessoas gostam, mas eu prefiro que eles vivam em bastante espa?o.

Os peixes chamam a aten??o pelo colorido e harmonia que trazem ao ambiente., n?o d?o trabalho e s?o uma ótima op??o para aqueles sem tempo e q moram em apartamentos onde n?o se permite ter animais. Por essas raz?es, a aquariofilia é t?o avan?ada em grandes cidades. O interessante de se criar peixes em aquários n?o se resume aos animais em si, mas tb pela possibilidade de reproduzir dentro da sua casa um peda?o do ambiente natural q as espécies vivem, criando um mini-habitat, com plantas naturais, pedras, peda?os de troncos, ilumina??o e várias espécies convivendo como aconteceria no ambiente natural. Além disso, a diversidade de espécies é a maior entre os vertebrados - tem peixe para todo gosto! Dê uma olhada em alguns aquários montados por especialistas (há vários sites na intenet) ou vá a uma boa loja do ramo para ver como é possível retratar o fundo de um lago, rio ou recife de coral na sua casa. Vc vai passar horas admirando e relaxando....|`|sVPtdg2naa	ter um ser vivo em casa é muito divertido,vc poder dar carinho,cuidados além de embelezar o amibiente.é muito curioso observar os hábitos dos peixes,eles nao s?o tao sem gra?as como parecem.|`|ujgnE0Djaa	pra mim nenhuma gra?a tambem pra mim uma loira gata de olho azulz alta 16 anos.<br>  tenho que me preocupar com outras coisas

eFAlYsSyaa	Ainda bem que vc deixo claro, em todo caso existe exce??o , gatos é normal as mulheres preferirem antes gatos do que drag?es , eu tbm escolhei um gato , mas homem cachorro quero distancia .|`|0P8sC6iXaa	é.. eu prefiro cachorros...auhsdiousadhiae<br>  <br>  acho que grande parte das mulheres preferem gatos porque s?o mais calmos, mimosos, quietos... e combinam com sua personalidade...<br>  já os homens devem se identificar melhor com os cachorros, que s?o mais ativos, agitados, n?o têm frescuras (e os que têm, geralmente s?o preferência das mulheres), etc...|`|7daf78f81fc155816defe0c177261a95aa	Pois é...no meu caso eu prefiro os dois!!!!|`|CuNDA500aa	pq somos mais nos gatinho|`|aQ1H3iVBaa	Eu prefiro cachorros logicoo..gato ecaa|`|mBrGd7A8aa	Existem muitas exe?oes!!Eu e muitas amigas minhas,nao gostamos de gatos e eu amo cachorros.|`|rGFLJUPNaa	N?o sei se isso se aplica só aos homens. Mas, em geral, acredito que aqueles que preferem cachorros a gatos têm uma maior necessidade de controle e autoridade, o que é bem mais comum entre os homens. Cachorros s?o mais facilmente controlados, obedientes e submissos. D?o a idéia de que há realmente um "dono" ou "proprietário". Sempre achei que a preferência por c?es está ligada à inseguran?a, afinal nada melhor para um ser inseguro do que ter um animal q vc castiga e depois o chama e ele vem abanando o rabo. Gatos s?o mais orgulhosos e independentes e poucos homens (generalizando, é óbvio) admiram isso, especialmente os mais machistas. Por fim, acho n?o deveria haver tal divis?o, o legal é admirar e compreender cada espécie animal nas suas particularidades.|`|zhJIuJTRaa	claro, em todo caso existe exce??es, acho que simplesmente vc só conheceu garotas que gostam de gatos.|`|8QGUcjvvaa	Conhe?o um monte de homem que gosta de gatos.<br>  Diga-me com quem andas que te direi quem és.|`|kPPf4Zbwaa	E super facil entender pq isso acontece veja bem...<br>  <br>  A mulher gosta do gato pq ele é que nem o homem, n?o da aten??o qdo se esta falando, sai de casa a hora que quer e nunca tem horas para voltar, qdo se esta em casa so quer comer e dormir, entre outras coisas...<br>  <br>  Já o homem gosta mais de cachorro, pq ele se sente mais poderoso, o homem da casa, pois quer agir como o mandam, quer que ele tome conta da casa cuide da seguran?a dos seus filhos, qdo vc briga com ele, ele fica de cabe?a baixa e escuta tudo oq vc esta falando...<br>  <br>  Hehe... brincadeira... naum sei n?o acho que é relativo, tem homens q gostam de gatos como mulheres q gostam de cachorros...|`|xOPBx3hyaa	Afinidade..pura afinidade..rs|`|17b7902984af27151c155bb1c0a0c792aa	Os homens preferem gatas!|`|6a6a0f8e155cc9ccce6580c5d216586caa	Eu já me acostumei com gatos e cachorros.

2c844fcf526bc2b90f16b7c425e11aa7aa	Her behaviour would scare me too and I have large Rottweilers.  She shouldn't be showing teeth. Dogs whose brains are wired correctly will give a warning growl before a nip and it doesn't sound like this is what is happening.   <br>  <br>  I wouldn't be pushing her around because you might cop a bite. She is certainly challenging you trying to stare you down. When you lock eyes with her she should submit and drop her gaze.<br>  <br>  I think right now a qualified behaviourist would be your best option.  One with a good reputation who is used to working with large breeds.  I would do this ASAP because the more often she gets away with this behaviour the more she will repeat it. Get onto it straight away.<br>  <br>  She sounds like a real handful and I hope it all works out for you and for her.  Akita's are truly beautiful dogs.|`|jwIdq5qkaa	To me it sounds like the people who had her before may have beat her. They are usually very calm and affectionate dogs, so I'm assuming something must have upset her. Also make sure that she looks as to you and your husband as pack leader, if she doesn't she will take over. There is some reading down below you may be interested in.|`|Z9zzNYNCaa	You are *NOT* "dominant"!!<br>  You are completely ignorant of dog training & discipline *&* soft as marshmallows!<br>  If you don't grow a spine FAST,you'll get severely bitten & end up killing the untrained,ill-mannered ,spoiled rotten beast!!!|`|s4OtfZ7Gaa	you need to speak with a professional trainer or behavior specialist who can come and evaluate her before this gets worse|`|AA11662490	I agree will the guy above you are not dominate. If you do not or can not get a hold on this dog you need to find someone who can or get professional help. Find a home for it. This is a severely aggressive breed of dog and you have a temperament in this puppy that is very dangerous to others. You don't want a law suit cause your dog attacked a child or something. you need to act, while it is young|`|zmQT3HF4aa	I would take her to a vet and get her fully checked out there could be a health problem and ask for information on obedience classes. female dogs can be like this if there due on season aswel. If you show fear the dog will pick up on this and challenge you so dnt show fear around her if you dnt feel safe get a muzzle or keep her outside for longer in the garden until you get her checked out, with you saying she had a bad experience before you got her this could another reason why she is acting like this. You say your health isnt so good at the moment she could be trying to protect you as dogs  pick up on things alot quicker than humans and could be trying to challenge you with you not being well. I would definately get her checked out though just to make sure is fit and healthy.
B6zl0AJDaa	I have yet to find a website that tells one HOW to measure a saddle.<br>  <br>  ENGLISH: You need to measure from your knee to your hip and that will give you your seat size. To measure the seat size on a saddle you start from the button to the side of the pommel, then take the measuring tape and go to the center of the cantle (back of the saddle.).<br>  <br>  As for your horse's size, depends a lot on the breed, most TBs, QHs, Arabs take a wide to extra wide tree.  You can use a wire coat hanger and place it across the highest part of your horse's withers and make a mold.  Take that with you to the saddle shop.|`|9IZ0CmxPaa	You know I just went into my local saddle shop (to buy odds and ends... but I'm also looking for a new english saddle) and I asked them how I should do it and what measurements I would need. They pulled out a fitting guide like you were talking about and said that that works, but if I didn't want to spend 30 dollars on that I should just take a metal coat hanger, untwist it so it's straight, and measure make a contour where the top of my saddle would go on the horse's back. Then, I would bring it back in, and you just hold it up against the saddle to see whether the saddle would fit the back or not. You could always go into a saddle shop to see if they have one if you wanted to be exact, or you could try the coat hanger method. That's probably what I'll do.<br>  <br>  Edit: I should've read Rosi first!

NBfBKI1Uaa	Let me explained what happened. When you first setup your tank and added gravel, the cloudiness was due to suspended sand and dust particles from the gravel. That should have cleared or settled in about 24 hours.<br>  <br>  When you added the damsels, more than likely you have an algae bloom and that probably went away as the bacteria colony developed enough to handle the ammonia. <br>  <br>  Red like bacteria is now cyano bacteria in the tank.Do a water change and keep the pristine water water quality in your tank to avoid algae. If possible use RO water. <br>  <br>  <br>  -rds|`|8owlj2xHaa	You are having a very positive experience, everything is going well, and the way it should. The live rock you added keeps you from going thru a bad cycle process if it is cured really well. Sounds like yours was. <br>  The different colored algae is not bad. The bad stuff does not grow on glass, usually. The algae you are describing is Coraline algae it is a good calcium based algae and is a very good sign that things are good. <br>  Algae does burn up on its own in very good water quality. What happens is that the Algae starves to death.|`|QC6oBb2iaa	The purple, red, and green stuff growing in your tank is probably coralline algae.  That's a positive sign.  Have you been measuring for ammonia?  Nitrites?  Nitrates?  You should be checking those levels.|`|4930be4dc4ebb348ee60d181d64e86c0aa	Did you rinse your gravel in tap water before putting it in your tank? <br>  <br>  Have you had your water tested for Ammonia, Nitrite, Nitrate, pH, and salinity?<br>  <br>  Red Slime algae is normally caused either by not having an appropriate size filter or not having a skimmer for your tank.. <br>  <br>  As far as the lid, all kinds of algae grow in tanks,<br>  <br>   I'd recommend reading up on proper saltwater maintenance and most books will cover which is good algae and which is bad. <br>  <br>  As far as whats all going on in your tank, its difficult to tell without more pertinent info: How big is your tank? How long has it been set up? Where in your house is it set up (near a window where it gets direct sunlight?)?  Get your water tested at your local fish store, and they can point you in the right direction|`|QV6swGUMaa	your tank was cycling ? if it is a new tank yes.you should clean your tank once a week with a gravel siphon.you should have cleaned the gravel before putting it in? what are the levels in your tank ph no2 no3 amonia gh ,kh .sounds like you just jump in without doing any reasearch at all.check your levels straight away buy a test kit if ya dont have one the api master test kit is a good one ya can get them on ebay.you need to get a maget for cleaning the glas in your tank to .do this then use the sihon to suck up anything that comes off the glass.good luck.i would say it is some sort of fungus  or algea on the tank is it near a heater or direct sunlight ? if so this could be the cause i would say it is that you have not cleaned yoyr tank.|`|qeOlkRM0aa	You have algae. Most likely slime algae of various colors. Not good. try to siphon it out of the tank.<br>  First, gravel doesn't clean itself, unless it is live sand that is full of micro fauna and bristle worms etc. I suspect that's not your case. The detritus probably just settled and sank to the bottom. <br>  Did you get "a" live rock, or some live rock? if so, how much?<br>  What kind of filtration do you have? Lighting?<br>  It seems that you have successfully cycled your tank. Very good.

Les shampooing Friskies vont de 250 à 500mL et co?te entre 3 et presque 4€ maxi (le shampooing basique Friskies 500ml offre spéciale : 3,51€). J'apelle pas ca "hors de prix", ce sont à peu près les prix des shampooings pour humain. Bien s?r; si tu vas chez le véto, ca va être beacoup plus cher (ca peut monter jusqu'à10€ et mon chien s'en est parfaitement passé jusqu'à présent)<br>  <br>  Quant au savon de Marseille, tu peux éventuellement laver ton chien avec, mais alors du savon de Marseille EXTRA PUR à l'huile d'olive vierge, sans AUCUN additif de type parfum ou autre. Regarde bien les composants! Jamais de shampooing pour humain, même pour bébé. Certains chiens le supportent bien, mais d'autres pas du tout, donc ne prend pas de risques.<br>  <br>  Un chien se lave GRAND MAXIMUM une fois par mois (à moins d'avoir un chien de concours, mais ce n'est pas ton cas). Je lave le mien 2-3 fois par an.

73193e3b067ba4736d1fab4da3289625aa	No don't feed them or you will never get rid of them. Put something you can see through (perspex) and that the sun can get through over your balcony and extending a little way out so that it will be hard for them to land on your balcony and be annoying and then you can put your clothes out there to dry. Or ask at the council...they usually have poison that you can mix with food so that there aren't so many. Perhaps the person you rent the apartment from will help with covering the balcony. Pigeons are dirty, disease carriers so don't feel bad for them. You either have to keep them out or get rid of them.|`|cWuumdy7aa	Commonly found in large flocks, pigeons are usually grey in color and can be identified by their pinkish-red feet and a pair of black bars visible on their wings. Their natural diets consist mainly of seeds and grains, but they will eat almost any scraps provided by humans (bread, french fries, crusts, garbage, etc).<br>  Health Risks and Property Damage<br>  Like most birds, pigeons can carry fleas, ticks, or mites. It has been argued that they also carry diseases which can be transmitted to humans through direct contact with either the birds or their feces but these reports seem to be largely unsubstantiated. Their droppings however can damage the paint on your car or the finish on a building, and their highly-flammable nesting materials can clog up drains and vents.<br>  Pigeon Control Methods<br>  Nature follows the law of least resistance. Unless your problem with pigeons stems from overpopulation, making your building or home harder to nest on or in than most of the other buildings or homes in your area should cause them to stick to easier targets. This section delves into each available method of doing this. <br>  If you're considering poisons, traps, or other lethal measures to kill the pigeons, you should first check with you local authorities to see what control methods are legal and how to implement them safely. <br>  Pigeon-Proofing<br>  The first step in getting and keeping pigeons out of any particular area is to make it as inhospitable as possible. Pigeons prefer to nest in high, out-of-the-way places like awnings, rafters, ledges, and attics. Search your property for any places that would make a good safe haven and seal them off using screens, fillers and plates. Flat, open areas can be protected by employing a tactile repellentPigeon Deterrents<br>  There are many methods of deterring pigeons; the one you pick should be based on your unique requirements. Following is a brief explanation of each:<br>  Tactile Repellents<br>  A tactile repellent is any device or substance that can deter a pigeon from landing on or touching a surface. Examples of these include: <br>  Anti-Roosting Spike Strips – These spike strips can be attached to places a bird might perch to make it less attractive as a landing strip. They can be found online and at many hardware stores. <br>  Chemicals - Chemicals can also be used, the most common types are either sticky and uncomfortable for birds to perch on, or can produce pain on contact with their feet. These are specialized products and can be purchased in most places that specialize in pest control. <br>  Do-It-Yourself - A surface or perch can easily be made unusable with a little ingenuity. High, tight loops of chicken wire, modifications that turn a level surface into a sloped one, automatic sprinkler systems, and electrified wiring/fence kits are all good examples. Browse your local home improvement store for anything that looks like it would fit the bill. <br>  Scarecrows<br>  Scarecrows have been used for ages to keep birds away from crops. Scarecrow types that deter pigeons include owls, snakes, cats, and people. The key to using one of these successfully is to make it appear as lifelike as possible. Move it from one location to another every few days. A scarecrow that moves either randomly or responsively is usually more effective then one that does not. Windsocks that are made to look like animals can work well so long as there is enough wind to keep them ‘alive'.<br>  Ultrasonic Repellents<br>  Ultrasonic repellents are commercially available for every possible pest you can imagine, and for every pest we've researched they have been found to be complete failures at repelling any of them. Pigeons are no exception. Don't waste your money on one of these. <br>  <br>  Relocation<br>  Trapping and relocating a pigeon is a complete waste of time. Even if you release the bird hundreds of miles away, it will still be able to find its way back home in no time flat (It might even beat you back!).<br>  Professionals<br>  If you're sick and tired of fighting an army of pigeons by yourself, calling a professional pest control expert is a good choice - especially if you are considering lethal measures. Professionals will know all of the local laws and be able to pigeon-proof your property legally, humanely and effectively. Make sure you ask for references and speak to others who have successfully used a professional to eliminate their pigeon problem.|`|DvjbTNXvaa	hi!<br>  try scaring them when you see them.do other people in your apartment have the same problem?if they do, then try asking them what they have done.but please don't kill them.just because they carry diseases, doesn't mean u have to kill.would you do that to a person carrying diseases?they might e coming because of something they like there.try to find out what that is and get rid of it.<br>  =D|`|eVubSKcEaa	They might be coming there if there are foodgrains or sumthing..<br>  do they hav a nest there? then tilt the nest a little a few days..<br>  try to scare the birds everytime.. so when they know that they are not welcome they will go away..<br>  But plz dont stone, shoot or kill them..|`|UOmJbxkOaa	Well you could probably feed them on the basement ground or put a bird feeder down there and that should help!|`|WQJayvm3aa	why do you want to get rid of them, they also have a right to live.

AA11193920	Little Trolls get her deleted, so she just changes names. She may seem mean, but she is just telling the truth. A mixed breed is a mutt/mongrel, look up their definitions in the dictionary. They SHOULD NOT be bred! It is just as plain ans simple as that. People who think that producing these designer POS puppies is great should delete their own accounts. I hope she keeps answering questions and setting people straight! She tells people the things that most of us just want to say, but can't bring ourselves to type the words!<br>  <br>  Mixes can be good pets, however, they don't make good breeders. If you own a mutt, get it fixed, that is the point that she and others are trying to make!<br>  <br>  And by the way, that is definately not her. She doesn't ever say that mixes should live, just that they should breed!|`|M5xsfUtwaa	I know it could be her. She is sooooo mean. She hasn't even et our dogs yet.

She also seems to hate the people who think their mixed breed dog is better than a pound puppy because they paid $800 for their 'labradoodle' or whatever other stupid name they've given for a mixed breed dog. <br>  <br>  She doesn't always have the greatest attitude- but I'd rather have more people like her around and less "Should I breed my 3 pound teacup chihuahua with my brother's 30lb cocker spaniel and make cockchi's?" "My dog's is dying, but I can't afford a vet" people<br>  <br>  Actually I don't think that's her- her writing style is usually more CAPITALS and !!!

E3jWUqoJaa	It is very sad to hear that your parents are treating this dog this way and I am hoping that what you consider "freezing cold" is not really freezing.<br>  <br>  First of all, make sure that your dog has something warm and thick to lay on to keep him off of the cold ground.  This will help ease his discomfort and is soothing as well.<br>  <br>  A good additive to help relieve his pain and discomfort is something easily purchased for people and not nearly as expensive if purchased this way.  I purchased gluicosimine with MSN for my golden and it helped her tremendously.  I purchased it from Costco and gave her one pill daily.  You can also purchase something from your vet but it is usually signifigantly more expensive and not as effective.  This I was told by my vet.<br>  <br>  This probably won't be of comfort to know, but goldens are prone to hip displasia and at his age there is not much else that you can do but try to make him comfortable.  <br>  <br>  The life span on most goldens is 8 - 10 years so he has outlived his life expectancy and as long as he is comfortable enjoy him as much as you can and keep him warm, happy and as comfortable as possible.  Don't let him suffer.  <br>  <br>  My golden lived to after her 14th birthday with out any undue pain.  Part of acheiving this was making sure that she maintained the correct weight.  At one point she was overweight and had we not taken the excess weight off of her she would never have lived to 14+.  Our girl died in her sleep with no pain after giving us a lifetime of love.<br>  <br>  If you are concerned about his living situation please talk to your parents about it.  They may be open to your taking him home in the evenings and returning him home in the mornings.  Unfortunately I don't know your situation so I can not recommend anything else but love and comfort for your life long friend.|`|AA10759544	i know how hard it is to lose a pet, especially one you've grown up with. but the best thing for that case is to put him down. we had to put my dogs down because of arthritis. he also would not sleep in his kennel. but if putting him down is not an option, i would suggest maybe an electric blanket on low. a battery operated one if they make such ones. or a big quilt. if you parents have a garage, even that is better than outside. good luck, i feel for your situation.<br>  <3|`|yGTyGZmCaa	Straw makes for a nice comfy bedding, it won't freeze like a blanket will. A hot water bottle will simply freeze in a few hours.<br>  <br>  As for the arthritis, EVA (Elk Velvet Antler) works wonders as does MSM and Fresh Factors is another great supplement.<br>  <br>  But my best advice, convince your parents into letting this Golden go to a more caring home.<br>  <br>  As a 5 Golden owner I hate to see any Golden in need.|`|S9MT4Tdaaa	The best thing you can do is to get the dog appropriate bedding. It can make a huge difference. A cold hard kennel is not good enough as you already know. <br>  <br>  There are pet heat pads that you can buy and softer bedding (not too soft that he struggles to get out of it).  <br>  <br>  Also is he on any medication to help with the arthritis. There are many drugs and or supplements (including a change of diet) that your vet can recommend. I know you said you can't take him, but if you manage a visit to the vet you could make a big difference for him.

Vc vai ter um certo sossego, até a próxima gatinha da rua entrar no cio...   rsrsrsrs    E ele come?a a fazer xixi em tudo, de novo... Ele está exausto, deve ter ficado sem comer, está faminto, e vai ficar um anjo, até a próxima. Tenho uma amiga q ? queria castrar o persa lindo preto, q ela tem, foi levando, limpando, até q ela resolveu manter o bichinho preso, ele pirou, xixou o armário de roupas dela todo e ainda avan?ou nela... Aí ela correu e castrou, mas ele já tinha criado o hábito, e ela até hoje pena, pq mesmo castrado, qdo ele fica agitado, faz xixi em tudo... Vc ainda acha q seu gato mudou?

O certo é mandar castrar porque assim ele ficará mais calmo, mas nunca esque?a que é preciso fechar os acessos para a rua que tenha na casa, porque mesmo castrado ele pode sair a rua porque já conhece os caminhos de ida e volta, e isso n?o é bom porque na rua ele corre sérios perigos e pode nunca mais voltar.
Z9zzNYNCaa	You'll have to buy the complete set of memory-cards.

SFBHazwiaa	OK the dam (mother of your pup) was sold to the owner with the KC reg document endorsed with 'progeny not eligible for registration' this means that the dam was NOT sold for breeding purposes, and means that ANY puppies bred from her will NOT be able to be KC reg, regardless whether the sire is KC reg or not. The only person that can lift the endorsement is the breeder of the dam. <br>  The dams breeder might have had a very good reason for placing an endorsement on her, perhaps she wasn't good enough quality to be bred from? or maybe she carries or is an affected with a genetic problem? or maybe the owner has to have all health tests done BEFORE the dam was bred from? Are the sire and dam actually health checked for ailments for their breed? <br>  i hope this helps a little.<br>  <br>  EDIT: so what was the reason given for breeding an endorsed b!tch? and rearing/selling non-KC reg pups?|`|ba8dd4c6a9b532bef579aff3e8706fe7aa	It means that the mother of the puppies was sold with a non-breeding registration.  It means that the person who bred her reneged on their agreement not to breed their b*tch.<br>  <br>  In other words, they're dishonest and unethical.<br>  <br>  EDIT: It means the breeder of your puppy.  When they bought the mother, they agreed not to breed her.  I'm not sure about the procedures in the UK, but they probably had to sign a non-breeding agreement for registration.  If the breeder of the dam was willing to lift the non-breeding restriction, they could have, but obviously they didn't.  The breeder of your puppy simply went ahead and bred their b*tch despite giving their word that they wouldn't.  That is dishonest and unethical.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Just curious what sort of excuse this "breeder" had.|`|aCqSF87Raa	That basically says that you got a pup from a questionable breeder. <br>  <br>  Reputable breeders do not breed dogs that are not registered with the AKC, or dogs that have not proven themselves in the show ring. So your pup can not be registered with the AKC which to me means possible questionable background.<br>  <br>  Did you even ask about genetic testing? Brucellosis testing? Did you get a good health guarantee (covers full three years minimum?) Where the breeding dogs the correct ages? Breeder not constantly breeding?|`|TuHfZdYGaa	It means exactly what *Basset* said.<br>  <br>  The Dam (as a pup) was sold to your breeder on the condition that she was NOT to be bred from and your breeder  has broken the contract, therefore unable to KC reg your puppy (or they will be caught out).<br>  <br>  The breeder and the details of the Dam need to be reported, Sorry.<br>  <br>  (And I emphasise, they need to be reported, give the details of the Dam to the KC and they will follow it up).|`|xEyyFrPhaa	it means the dam should not have been bred from and should have been spayed.|`|ORe8qdtTaa	Basset has explained it pretty much perfectly.<br>  <br>  I would be asking why the breeder of the dam didnt lift the endorsements and why they went ahead with it.  <br>  <br>  It could be that the dams breeder did not think the sire was a good one - it is quite rare for owners to own both sire and dam that are a perfect compliment to each other.<br>  <br>  Did you check that both sire and dam had all the health checks done for the breed, hip scores elbows eyes etc and see proof that these had been done?<br>  <br>  If not I would contact the breeder of the ***** and tell them what has gone on!<br>  <br>  EDIT  I take it its a no on the health checks then!

EJpiaCMQaa	If you have a male cockatiel, it's possible it may learn to speak.  Most males have the bright orange cheekpatches in yellow heads.  It will be more difficult to teach it how to speak considering its age, but not impossible.  Keep repeating the same words over and over to him.  Make sure there are no distractions.  Also, you can play tapes or have your cockatiel near the computer and listen to other cockatiels talking.  That might encourage him to start talking.|`|QB0CnrmJaa	Yes, you can teach your cockateil to speak, unless it is under poor condition.<br>  <br>  For starters, try "hello" by repeating it to the bird.

ak9DrBSwaa	A good small animal vet is a good idea, but if that's not a realistic option here is plan b.<br>  <br>  Can you get a good look at the injured leg. Make sure that there is no bone protruding through the skin. If there is, this is a "compound fracture" you need a vet.<br>  <br>  Gently touch the leg, and the other non-injured one. You may get bit, so be prepared for that. Don't fight with your pet for the exam, it's often better to do nothing, than to cause an injury by forcing the exam.<br>  <br>  If the leg is at a weird angle (not just being held up by the pet), then the bone ends are not meeting correctly or its dislocated. These should go to a vet also.<br>  <br>  If all the bones appear to be lined up correctly, then at worse you might have a "simple or closed fracture" - could also just be a sprain. These can often be treated successfully at home, but a vet is always your best option.<br>  <br>  If treating at home because a vet is not an option - Don't even attempt to splint it, you'll just tick off your pet and do more harm than good. Instead, baby-proof the cage. Remove anything the pet can climb on or run on for a few days. Extra bedding is not a bad idea. Do leave places to hide, even though this can be climbed on.<br>  <br>  Keep a close eye on your pet, make sure he is eating and drinking. While it's tempting to feed your pet extra treats at this time, its not the best idea - the best food is what he needs now. Healthy stuff, rather than junk food if at all possible. (I'll tempt a sick hamster to eat ANYTHING in a critical situation, but its not the best for healing if he'll eat his regular food now.)

46181f764bb037eb34818a9404702b95aa	Actually dogs' eyesight isn't that keen.  They lack some of the color vision that we do, although they do see better than us in low light.  Sight isn't their primary sense, like it is for humans... they really sense their world through their noses.  For puppies, it depends on age.  At about 3 weeks when their eyes first open, vision is poor.  When raising litters, I've offten thought they appear to be "squinting" to try to focus!  This is because their eyes aren't fully developed at birth, thus the "sealed shut" eyelids on newborn pups, giving eyes time to mature.  As they get older they will develop the same sight abilites that adults have.  By the time puppies go to their new homes at 8 weeks they should have normal sight.  If you have a puppy that is having what appears to be vision problems, see your vet.  She may have juvenile cataracts or one of the many breed specific genetic eye problems that are prevalent now (like Collie Eye Anomaly, detached retinas, etc).|`|f9fb186e1c82bf7349b1e14dcbb1bcc4aa	Not quite so keen and strengthen as they age.
AA12344360	Try an elizabethan collar to keep her from chewing on the wound.  You may also need to take her to a vet as she may have a slight infection there.  Clean the wound well and look carefully to see if there are signs of puss forming.  Also, squeeze the leg slightly behind the wound.  If she shows signs of distress then you may have a developing infection.  <br>  <br>  Also, are you certain that it was a bug bite?  Here in SC we have a problem in the spring with young snakes and dogs.  The infant snakes bite the dogs, but don't transmit enough venom to make the animal sick or kill it.  Unfortunately though, the wounds are slow to heal because of small amounts of venom in the muscle tissue.  A warm poultice of green tea can help draw that out and speed up healing.|`|JIZdPbgKaa	put some bacitracin on it.......it is wonderful and hopefully she won't like the taste of it.|`|B1NfrNU0aa	yep,green tea poulstice or i like to use chewing tobacco since its easier to come by in these parts than green tea. just chew it up a bit so it's moist then put it on the wound and wrap the leg and chew with some leather or a tobacco leaf if you got one fresh.|`|X3mTlGx3aa	yeah or neosporin after washing it with peroxide.
uBFhKXgHaa	Well first, I'd like to say great job switching to a higher quality cat food. Science Diet is expensive /crap/. Wellness is a great food to be feeding.<br>  <br>  It sounds like you probably didn't transition him slowly enough. Did you make the switch gradually?<br>  <br>  Remember that foods should be switched gradually (mixing the new slowly in with the old over the period of about week or so), especially when switching to a higher quality one, so as not to upset tummies. For example:<br>  Days 1 & 2: 75% old food, 25% new food<br>  Days 3 & 4: 50% old food, 50% new food<br>  Days 5 & 6: 25% old food, 75% new food<br>  Day 7: 0% old food, 100% new food<br>  <br>  <br>  What about canned food? Canned food is all your kitty really needs, actually. Dry food is not healthy for cats at all. Contrary to popular belief, wet/canned food is healthiest.<br>  <br>  The reason is, in the wild, cats normally get most of their water content directly from their prey items and drink very little. Domestic cats are no different, and because of the fact that they are designed to take in water with their meal, they have a very low thirst drive. Cats often just don't drink enough. This leads to urinary tract infections and crystals. The bit about dry food being better for teeth is a myth and has not been proven in the least (cats barely even chew their dry food and, really, does a pretzel clean /your/ teeth? Cats should have their teeth brushed with cat toothbrushes and cat toothpaste at least a few times a week as well as see the vet for dental cleanings when necessary /regardless/ of what they are being fed). Canned/wet food is better because it more closely mimics the cat's natural diet. More on why canned food is best:<br>  <a href="http://www.catinfo.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.catinfo.org/</a>  (Excellent cat nutrition information by a vet)<br>  <a href="http://www.littlebigcat.com/index.php?action=library&act=show&item=whycatsneedcannedfood" rel="nofollow">http://www.littlebigcat.com/index.php?ac...</a> (Why Cats Need Canned Food)<br>  <a href="http://www.blakkatz.com/dryfood.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.blakkatz.com/dryfood.html</a> (The Truth About Dry Cat Food)<br>  <a href="http://cats.about.com/cs/catfood/a/canned_food.htm" rel="nofollow">http://cats.about.com/cs/catfood/a/canne...</a> (Canned Cat Food: Can Your Cat Afford to Live Without it?)<br>  <a href="http://www.felinefuture.com/nutrition/bpo_ch4.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.felinefuture.com/nutrition/bp...</a> (The Dry Food Crisis)<br>  <a href="http://maxshouse.com/feline_nutrition.htm" rel="nofollow">http://maxshouse.com/feline_nutrition.ht...</a> (Max's House: Feline Nutrition)<br>  <a href="http://www.littlebigcat.com/index.php?action=library&act=show&item=doesdryfoodcleantheteeth" rel="nofollow">http://www.littlebigcat.com/index.php?ac...</a> (Does Dry Food Clean the Teeth?)<br>  <br>  Another option to get cats to drink more would be a cat fountain.

Have you consulted your vet?<br>  <br>  did you change it gradually?  Or immediately?<br>  <br>  Anytime you change a cats food it should be done gradually - otherwise they can develop diarrhea or may be allergic to the new food<br>  <br>  Stay with wellness - its a very healthy food for your kitty|`|K0uTjeWiaa	Get some acidoupholous from a health food store and sprinkle about 1/8th a teaspoon in the food each day|`|ITnQEUQTaa	The foods you have mentioned all contain species inappropriate ingredients for your pet carnivore - grains, fruits and vegetables have no place in a cat's diet.  <br>  <br>  My cats and dogs eat the same thing from weaning to the grave - a raw meaty bones or prey model diet.  This means raw meat, edible bones and organs.  Bones for the cats mean things like chicken necks or wings - for the dogs it could be half a chicken or a pork hock.  Not only do these foods contain essential nutrients, they clean the teeth and gums too.  About 90% of pet animals develop periodontal disease which can lead to abscesses, organ failure and autoimmune disorders.  This condition is a direct result of inappropriate diet i.e. commercial processed foods.  ALL my animals have white shiny teeth and my 16.5 year old cat has every tooth in her mouth.  All the commercially fed cats I know are missing many of not all of their teeth by this age.<br>  <br>  Aim to feed, over the course of a week or two, about 2/3 meat (chunks are better than ground for tooth cleaning) and the rest a combination of meaty bones or organs.  Liver is very important and should make up about 5% of the total diet.  Heart is also a great source of taurine, an amino acid that cats cannot produce themselves.  Cats will go blind or develop ireversible heart disease with this vital ingredient that raw meat and muslce has in abundance. BTW heart is counted as muscle meat rather than an organ for raw feeding purposes.<br>  <br>  The links below are mostly about dogs but much of the information is the same.  The feeding guide is designed for both dogs and cats|`|AA11455733	I always start mixing the new food in with the one I want to discontinue start with 1/4 new food for a few days and increase 1/4 at a time over two weeks or so.

I had my Kittens on IAMS and their stoolw as very runny/smelly then I switch to Athurity from PetsMart and they do VERY GOOD with that. and I just switch them to The good life because they are a almost 9 months and I got a sample and they loved it but 3 wks ;laters its still runny. I think maybe you should try to change again to something like athurity . If the food dont change it he could have irritable bowel syndrome my cat had that and he always had runny stool. maybe you should talk to your vet about that.<br>  <br>  <br>  good luck hope this helps!|`|TiAK1629aa	You really should have your cat tested for parasites.  He may have contracted something that's just showing up now.  Some of the parasites they can have are able to pass to humans.  That's the first step in ruling out the causes of diarrhea.  If it turns out to be just non-specific diarrhea, which it often does, there is a product available through veterinarians only called Proviable.  It's a capsule and paste that you give them for about 10 days.  It puts the good bacteria back into their systems that aid in health digestion.  Sort of like yogurt does for humans.  It's not very expensive, and the results are almost immediate.  We've raised 4 kittens over the last 2 years, and 3 of them had issues with diarrhea.  2 were due to all of the antibiotics they had to be on from very young, and 1 was non-specific diarrhea.  Proviable worked in all cases and it was a permanent solution to the problem.|`|73193e3b067ba4736d1fab4da3289625aa	If you are giving your kitten milk to drink stop and give him only water. A lot of cats are allergic to milk and it gives them diarrhea. It is milk meant for cows after all. So it might not be his food after all.

You're doing a wonderful thing!<br>  <br>  I'd put him back on the old food for now.  That should settle him down a bit.<br>  <br>  Then start gradually changing the food.  But perhaps not to the Wellness.  Although it's true that sudden changes can cause digestive upsets, my experience has been that when switching from garbage to good food, regardless of pace you see improvement pretty much immediately.  So it sounds like the Wellness may not agree with him, even though it is a better food.<br>  <br>  Are you feeding mainly dry food?  If that's the case, I'd suggest either Evo or Nature's Variety Instincts.  Or Wellness Core.  I'm not a fan of their other dry foods; only Core is grainless.  Evo and Instincts are also grainless.  If you want a decent food that isn't quite as expensive, try Natural Balance duck & green pea.  <br>  <br>  But you might have even better results if you switch him completely onto canned food.<br>  <br>  I'm just guessing, but your kitty sounds a lot like my Poppy, who has major problems with grains.  I switched her to grainless canned food and she did a 180.|`|cj31x3UMaa	Giardia is REALLY hard to test for. It has a distinct odor, but if the sample is not fresh & you do not have the right piece of poop - you can still get a negative result. <br>  <br>  I speak from experience... I now have an expensive filter installed at my house & my cats only drink bottled or filtered water - me too, I had to be treated as well! Our water quality here is the pits.<br>  <br>  The other thing to be checking on a fecal is for undigested food - food allergies.<br>  <br>  You just did a major switch in brands. I personally am not to thrilled w/ Science Diet, but compare the labels of the 2 foods... not ingredients, but % of things like fiber & fat. If you have gone from higher fiber, lower fat to a lower fiber, higher fat ratio - something as simple as that can cause a problem.<br>  <br>  As an example... years ago when I was feeding Nutro-Max I found that the regular formula had just enough higher fat% to give most of my cats a loose stool, but if I free fed the "lite" formula the nutrition was excellent & the extra fiber took care of the problems w/ the loose stool.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	Sometimes food can be too rich.  And if its dry, it has to be a gradual change over.<br>  <br>  I would first take the kitten to the vet to be checked out.  Then try Natural Balance or Max Cat.  And its best to have a mix of canned and dry food.|`|oDVx7nSxaa	Give it a chance.  But I will say that while Wellness is an excellent food, not all foods agree with all cats.  There are many other fine foods on the market, and one of them may be better tolerated.  I've fostered a number of cats with irritable bowel, and for reasons not known, they tend to do better on Innova's EVO, or California Natural.  Might be worth a try for you.  You can also get benebac in the pet store, and that can really do wonders to firm up poop as it replaces all the good bacteria that's supposed to be found in their gut.  Just be sure to check the expiration date on it before you buy it.<br>  <br>  Continually testing poop isn't the answer.   Has the vet tested, though, for both coccidia and giardia?  Those aren't found in the normal fecal test for worms, and can cause very loose poops.
fc5e4f4741642787d64f7d84cccb7b94aa	If she's survived to seven with these problems she should be able to continue to eat the same food.  <br>  My yorkie lost all his teeth and like your dog not at once, so after the soreness of the last few being pulled he went back to eating regular dry dog food mixed with moist.  The jaw bone is strong enough to handle the food.  She obviously can since she must have only had a few teeth left to fall out and ate almost toothless for a long time.<br>  For now since she might be sore try moist and meaty.  This is soft (some people think its terrible food but right now food is food for her).<br>  If she will not eat of course talk to the vet but you can make a mush of food you know she likes and put it in a syringe (the needle has to be removed). You can cut the tip of the syringe to make the opening a little bigger to allow the food to pass through.  After you filled it, put it in her mouth to the side and release some of the food.  This will stick to the side of her checks and she can lick it and swallow.  If that's still not enough for now, force feed her with this syringe by putting it further in her mouth and pushing the plunger.  This will force food down her throat.  She can't live this way though and is only a temporary thing to try.  If this works try putting that same mush tomorrow in a bowl to see if she will eat it on her own.  If yes you can work your way back up to regular dog food in a week or so.<br>  I would make sure she's getting vitamins from the vet to supplement what she's not getting right now to try to keep her healthy.<br>  Good luck with her and I hope it's just a case of soreness that will pass.<br>  If it's just soreness she should feel better between 24-72 hours.<br>  I also suggest taking her tempature to make sure she is not ill which would cause her not to eat and just push her food around.  Normal is 100-101.  Some dogs can run a little higher normally.<br>  Kath|`|sUXyRlVjaa	What does your vet suggest?<br>  <br>  I'd try feeding a variety of stage one baby foods including meats and vegetables to supplement any moistened kibble she manages to get down.<br>  <br>  Kudos to you for managing to keep this dog alive for this long but if she's really having so much trouble eating it might be best for her to consider having her put to sleep.

RA3p25Qoaa	You have a lot of things right with your set up but there are a few things that should be changed.  Salt and fresh water, fresh foods and keeping them in groups is a great start. <br>  <br>  Wood chips are not one of the safe substrates that can be used with hermit crabs. They should not be exposed to any every green woods in their tank.  Sand and coconut fiber are two of the most popular substrates and the safest. You can use play sand just be sure to buy a high quality and sift though it prior to use. All sand should be baked first around 420f for 20 minutes or so. I use those tinfoil turkey pans to cook my sand. <br>  Coconut fiber needs to be made in boiled salt water<br>  <br>  Metal and hermit crabs never go together. They shouldn't have a wire cage to climb in. The cage will not allow for the proper humidity. I know you spray the tank but you need a humidity gage to measure the humidity at all times. If it drops below 70% they can't breath. <br>  Glass or plexi glass lid are better for many reasons. <br>  1- they help keep in the humidity<br>  2- they make it hard to escape and hard for pests to get in<br>  3- hermit crabs are sensitive to scented products anything in the air. Glass lids won't stop it all together but it helps make a better barrier than wire. <br>  <br>  Now on to why they are hiding<br>  If you've only had them 3 days chances are they're nervous and distressing. Hermit crabs like to have a place to hide and feel safe. Mine LOVE ceramic flower pots ( non painted of course) <br>  <br>  if the temperature in the tank is also 25c ( get a thermometer in there so you can check) they should be fine but if it's 20 or lower they may be a little cold. <br>  <br>  I suspect they're just getting used to the place and a little scared. <br>  <br>  Sometimes limbs are damaged in shipping from the wild. Rumour has it they're also sometimes cut because of the small nails that help them climb. These nails can scratch people.. Not to sure if there is truth to that. I've seen some hermit crabs with cut limbs here as well. <br>  <br>  When they moult they don't change or remove their shells. It's only their exoskeleton that is shed. They won't moult until they feel safe and content in their habitat.|`|IFGSOd16aa	I own 2 hermit crabs also and it seems like you like them alot! <br>  <br>  Well he could be molting.<br>  Its a pretty weird thing and i would leave him alone a little bit. <br>  <br>  Both have mine have already molted, but they molt a few times a year.|`|r0u26SYGaa	they molt with their shell on...when hermit crabs dig them selves up, that doesn't necessarily mean they are molting...they could be just sitting under there.....try to give them at least 12 hours of heat a day...and make sure you spray them with a mister...<br>  hermit crabs' tip of the lags go really dull when they really need to molt.. it could be cause of fighting...but when they fight they loose whole legs not parts!
QpElKY8Kaa	Did your vet say she was underweight?<br>  <br>  Danes undergo a lot of stress with the rapid growth they go through the first couple of years.  A slower, steady pace is better for them.<br>  <br>  Some Danes are more lanky than others.  As long as their weight and height are proportional, they're okay.  An overweight pup (at a year, it's still a pup) is putting more stress on growing bones.<br>  <br>  My Dane is a rescue.  I got him at three and a half.  That was 10 years ago and he's still going strong.  They (I had 2, the 11 year old passed last March) were on Purina Hi-Pro.  I've fed it to all my Danes since it was 1st introduced back in the sixties.<br>  <br>  <<+>> My first personal Dane came from the best kennel in this region, Kalmar.  They were one of the top kennels in the US.  Mr. Lundeen was president of the GDCA  several times.   If those who think Purina is low quality, what would they say about Jim Dandy??  Mr. Lundeen fed Jim Dandy to all his Danes...<br>  Oh, yeah, how many of those top name brands were on the recall list for contamination (melamine) a couple of years ago?  All of them.|`|BPMCKbyRaa	Hmm, lots of opinions here so far.  <br>  <br>  I agree Purina is garbage.  You need to get her on a high quality food asap.  www.dogfoodanalysis can help you pick a good one in your price range.   But remember, better foods usually mean you feed less, so even though the bag is more expensive, it lasts longer.  And smaller piles to clean up later in the yard.  So it's not really much more expensive when you figure it all out.<br>  <br>  Good foods to choose from are<br>  Eagle Pack Natural<br>  Chicken Soup<br>  Canidea<br>  California Natural<br>  Innova<br>  <br>  As far as the chicken vs chicken meal, don't be fooled.  Your best foods will list the "meal" before the chicken.  Chicken meal is chicken that's already been ground and dehydrated before the kibble cooking process.  Ingredients are listed by volume % in the recipe BEFORE baking.  <br>  <br>  If chicken is #1 on the list, by the time the kibble is baked, it could really be down to #3 or 4.  If Chicken MEAL is #1 on the list, it's going to stay there because all the moisture was already taken out. <br>  <br>  88 lbs sounds kind of low, but how tall is she?  how big were her parents?  She may just be a small dane.  She should be lean, but not emaciated looking.

Purina dog chows main ingredient is Corn, not Meat.  Any good dog foods main three ingredients are NAMED meat products NOT by-products or Meal, but actual meat like Lamb, Chicken, Bison, Salmon, Duck, Turkey, Venison, Trout etc.  Named meat, simply listing Poultry could be any fowl not necessarily chicken.<br>  <br>  These are the cons of Purina Dog Chow: Inadequate meat content, byproducts, low quality grain and meat products, fat of unidentifiable origin, artificial color, sugar.<br>  <br>  I feed Taste of The Wild, it's a 100% Grain free food with NO by-products and good quality meat.  It's also a lot cheaper than most higher quality foods but cannot be purchased in a Supermarket, Wal-Mart, Petsmart or Petco.<br>  <br>  Go to www.dogfoodanalysis.com and research foods in the 4-6 star category, you'll want more than grain filled foods, dogs don't digest grains they poop them out, your dog is not getting enough nutrition in her diet to gain the weight she needs.|`|GaLw1qMwaa	I rescued a dane a week ago and the folks fed her DOG CHOW. I think it is an ok food but by no means the best.<br>  She is 101 lbs 9 months but still a little lean. You dont want that breed to carry any more weight then they need because it can cause pre-mature hip problems and heart problems.<br>  <br>  Make sure you feed your dane TWICE A DAY. That helps alot with a common problem called bloat (which can be fatal) <br>  And make sure his food bowl is elevated , not on the ground.|`|Cfk1kr8Daa	The best suggestion I would have is to speak to her breeder, if they are reputable, or the Dane club members.  Purebred dogs especially can be sensitive to certain things, as their immune systems, and therefore any allergies, are formed when they are in the womb according to what their mothers were being fed at the time.<br>  <br>    That having been said, if you don't know, I would also say Nutro - but NEVER MAX, which was sold off as a separate entity to a large human food conglomerate a few years ago, and is much lower quality.<br>  <br>    The Nutro Natural Choice can be a very good food, especially the lamb and rice, which is gentle on the GI tract and good for the skin. But that is a general answer for any dog, and you have a dog that is like no other.  That won't necessarily apply to you.<br>  <br>    I also know several very good vets who feed their dogs Purina Dog Chow, and this when they could have heir pick of anything produced - it just happens to be what their dogs do their best on.<br>  <br>    The proof ultimately is what your dog digests the best, and develops safely on.  Danes are prone to bloat, so you don't wnt to feed her anything that ever produces diarrhea or gas - and I would *always* keep a package of Gas-X on hand no matter what.<br>  <br>    You also want to be very aware of the growth rate of your dog, and not give her more nutrients than her body really needs.  With bones that big, you want them to grow as slowly as possible.  An adult, large breed food is probably best.<br>  <br>    If she has been doing well on what she is eating now, I would leave things be - first, do no harm.  There are too many people around who think dog food is better when it contains raw deer meat and bleuberries, but the fact of the matter is, sometimes MUCH less is more...and in your case, that is what I suspect.  <br>  <br>  Just be careful, and don't do anything unless you actually have a reason.|`|KuUx34hCaa	The best food on the market to date for the money is Natural Choice  large breed adult as it has NO Chemicals Fillers or By-Products in it  & have used it for over 20yrs. with great results & it has EVER in it a dog needs|`|IdSqunZuaa	Generally, eight months to one year: females should be given 5 to 8 cups, while males should have 6 to 10 cups.

QpElKY8Kaa	They stay pretty close to home.  Less than quarter mile in any direction from their territory (nest tree) is about as far as they go, depending on available forage.  <br>  For males, outside their territory exposes them to attack from other males defending their territory.  <br>  For females, with young, it increases the length of time away from the nest.  This is dangerous for the babies as male squirrels finding undefended young will kill them.|`|y9yFES59aa	he travel about 15 miles every day from his home and he also dig every where and runs
86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	Angelfish are excellent parents and will guard any eggs aggressively, leave the eggs be. If you have a bonded pair and you lose this batch (parents will eat unfertilised eggs) then they will soon spawn again. It has also been reported that sometimes two females sometimes "spawn" and lay unfertlised eggs also!|`|d8f443bc582285db859040a0c5e47adcaa	moving them is very difficult unless they have laid on a rock or a leaf.i have moved eggs and had mixed success.if you move them you need them in a container with mild water movement and some anti-fungal treatment in the water.the eggs hatch dependant on temperature in 4/5 days.you don't need to feed until they have absorbed their egg-sac.first foods need to be small such as infusora -newly hatch brineshrimp or the like.if you leave them in the tank the parents will look after the eggs fanning them and removing infertile eggs and fungused ones.they will keep other fish at bay until hatched.this is when problems occur,other fish see them as treats as sometimes the parents do,and once free swimming the parents cannot look after them.if you want to breed them you need to set them up in a separate tank.one word of caution!!!two females will go thorough the same ritual as a male and female and one female will lay eggs.obviously these will not be fertile.unless you have the experience it is very difficult to sex angels.both sexes put down breeding tubes when laying eggs,the females is slightly thicker than the males and a mm longer.sorry i cannot tell you a better way.i,ve been breeding them for 30 yrs and still have problems<br>    hope this is of help<br>        regards|`|dE5fs9yzaa	You really can't move the eggs now...it will stress the parents and the eggs probably wouldn't survive. What you need to do is just let the parents do their job and hope some survive. Have a nother tank set up so when eggs do hatch and you can see the fry, be ready to transfer them to the new tank. This might work. If it doesn't set the tank up for the next spawn..if you have a pair of angels, they will spawn again and it would be better if done in their own tank. Be carefull..angels are aggressive when spawning. I had a male jump completely out of the tank at me! (He survived and so did the brood!)  Good luck! ;-)|`|xmoNQ2rPaa	The angelfish parents will guard the eggs. I suggest you do not remove them. When my angelfish layed eggs, they became very aggressive toward any other fish who came near them. I wouldn`t worry about the eggs being eaten. Wait until the fry hatch and then think about moving them.|`|QV6swGUMaa	i would leave them there and put a few more plants in your tank near that side where they have spawned so the fry have loads of places to hide spawning mops are good to.|`|1Qh9i9cWaa	Angels will guard and "nurture" their eggs, but they would be better in a non-community tank, those fish will eat the fry in a heartbeat! <br>  <br>  Once hatched the parents would normally guard the fry for a week or two, moving them to pre prepared sites around the tank. As one pit gets dirty they move on to the next. I would recommend removing the parents as soon as practical, once they have all hatched would be fine, there shouldn't be anything they need protecting from in the fry tank. <br>  <br>  A couple of words of warning tho, angels will very commonly eat their early broods and it is not unknown for a female without a suitable mate will lay her eggs whether they will be fertilised of not. So be prepared for this spawning to possibly be an infertile batch. <br>  <br>  (Usually they are allowed to form breeding pairs from a smallish school of fish, especially since it is almost impossible to distinguish males from females with angels.)<br>  <br>  The parents should fan the eggs with water to keep the eggs oxygenated and should pick out any infertile and non-viable eggs as they become noticeable to stop the onset of a fungal colony which would destroy the spawned eggs.<br>  <br>  Some commercial breeders will remove the parents or eggs after spawning and supply moving water with an airstone or similar and manually pick out any infertile eggs. <br>  <br>  The use of a fungicide also helps with this, something like "methylene blue" does the trick. You could use your spare tank for this purpose if you are really keen to try to raise these ones.<br>  <br>  The eggs should hatch in 4 days or so I think, (working from memory here, so don't quote me on that one!).<br>  Hope that helps... If you've got eggs you're probably halfway there!|`|iW5cmYQPaa	Angelfish fry are easy to hatch, but take a lot of work to successfully raise. <br>  They can not be raised in a floating hatchery or breeder net. <br>  IMO, the best way to raise Angel fry is to move both the parents and the eggs to a breeder tank of at least 20-gallons with a bare bottom and sponge filter. (Angel fry are very tiny, and are likely to get stuck in both gravel and regular filtration units.)<br>  Angelfish are very good parents, and will play a key role in the care of their eggs and fry. Both parents will keep the water circulating around the eggs by fanning them with their fins, and remove any unfertilized or “bad” eggs as they appear to keep them from contaminating the others. <br>  To remove the eggs, simply find a container large enough for the plant, rock, pipe, or whatever the eggs are on to fit in, and transfer them into the container under the water. Place the eggs into the breeder tank, and then quickly add the parents. To ensure that there is no shock, it is best to add plants, and filter media from your existing aquarium to the new tank, and be sure that the water is the same temperature in both tanks. <br>  IF you have a M/F pair, the eggs will remain transparent and hatch to “wigglers” in about 3 days. Unfertilized eggs will turn white. <br>  Once the eggs have hatched, the fry will stay together in a clump, and any strays will be caught by the parents and returned to the group. This is important to know, because it may look like the parents are eating the fry, when in fact they are just keeping them where they aught to be. Fry should not be fed while they are in this clump, as they are nourished by the remainder of their egg yolk sacks and any food offered to them will only pollute the water. <br>  Once the Angel fry are free swimming, (about 5 days after they hatch,) they will need to be fed newly hatched brine shrimp and/or fry food about 4 times per day. Because Angel fry require super clean water, their tank will also need to be cleaned before every feeding. This can be done using a turkey baster to clean along the bottom of the tank. (You’ll need to put the water taken out into a clean container and check very carefully for babies that have been accidentally suctioned, or you’ll end up dumping some.) Replace water with dechlorinated water of the same temperature. <br>  As the fry grow, they will need to be moved into several tanks, or a much larger tank to allow them room to grow. A good rule of thumb once they begin to actually resemble Angelfish is ? gallon per fry up to dime-sized body, and 1 gallon per fry up to nickel-sized body. <br>  If this all goes well, you could end up with anywhere from 1 to a couple hundred baby Angels. You will need to care for them diligently for several months. Once their bodies are dime to nickel size, you can sell them to your local fish store. You will not become rich in this transaction.<br>  Good luck.<br>  <br>  EDIT: <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/how-to-breed-angel-fish" rel="nofollow">http://www.squidoo.com/how-to-breed-ange...</a>
SoFjvqvIaa	She is obviously a young dog.  Young dogs lose their puppy teeth before they get their adult sized ones, this shouldn't cause you alarm.  <br>  <br>  Also, as long as you are feeding her according to the directions on the can, she should be fine.<br>  <br>  You might try getting her some chew toys or small raw hides for her to clean her teeth with (and this can help with the teething process).<br>  <br>  There are also some websites that rate dog food--I've seen them once or twice.

She may not like every brand, but through trial and error, you should find something. Even if you have to ween her, by mixing more hard with the soft daily - a dog won't let itself starve, she'll eat it eventually (or so I've read)... I know that the Dic* Van Patten has a sausage type food that could help in the transition... The soft food fed to her consistently will wreck her teeth, she needs the hard kibble to help clean them. Good luck!|`|s76aC4G8aa	If you feed nothing but canned food she will get a lot of tartar on her teeth they will rot out quicker and she'll require more frequent dental cleanings.  She needs hard kibble to keep her teeth strong, healthy and clean, she won't get that with only eating wet food.  I find it funny how you were feeding Cesars and thought that Science Diet was crap!! Science Diet is one step ABOVE Cesars too funny.<br>  <br>  She should be fine but you really need to give more kibble and less wet, you should simply mix in about two spoonfuls of wet to 1/2 a cup of dry food.  Put it down for 20 minutes if she doesn't eat it pick it up, then try again at her next meal.  Sooner or later she'll eat it when she sees she's not getting anything else.  You've sort of spoiled her with nothing but wet food, but she's not getting enough nutrition in her diet by only eating wet food, you MUST mix kibble in or you'll have all sorts of problems with her as she ages.<br>  <br>  Go to this website and research food, you'll want to feed anything in the 4-6 star category, anything below that is garbage food.

Due to the territorial habits of possums, If you put them anywhere far enough from their nest, It is extremely likely that they will die due to the fighting that moving them will cause. (aka, other possums will rip them apart.) so if you do live in Australia, appeal to your local council to set up a local reserve so the possums can nest there.  If you live in another country you can try this too.  Your other option is to buy a remote controlled citronella collar for you dog, or put up with the barking and possums.  I hope this helps and good luck.

0a747ad2e34888b7d06436104b173b4daa	I'm not sure what color is the most uncommon but I'll list a few. I've heard that the...<br>  sable merle<br>  and lethal silver<br>  shelties are rare. I think the lethal silvers look very similar to blue merles. It's more common in collies. Also mostly white or mostly black shelties I think are pretty rare... Personally, I like the blue merles and the bi-blues but I read that the bi-blue are supposed to be more likely to become deaf or blind when they're older. The website below also says there is a maltese coloring that is rare.|`|46181f764bb037eb34818a9404702b95aa	I would agree, sable merles are pretty rare.  You also don't see double merles and color headed whites (in Shelties, they are more common in Collies) very often.  Many double merles have genetic problems due to doubling up on the "dilution gene" (which causes the merle).  If you're interested in color inheritance, Sheltie Talk magazine has a full booklet showing how each and every Sheltie color possibility comes about-- really interesting!  I have a preference for bi-blacks, probably because after showing Shelties for about 15 years I switched to Border Collies!  I've got a thing for black and white dogs!|`|CeT8ZhWiaa	sable|`|RmFsjUvGaa	I don't see many "blue-merles", but I will chose that color for my favorite. I go for the dapple look.

This is due to the fact that many times sable merles are difficult to distinguish and accidentally breeding a sable merle to a blue merle could result in puppies with defects. I love sable merles and white factored dogs and have three blue merles.
46181f764bb037eb34818a9404702b95aa	Cats are pretty sneaky about a heat cycle, especially if they are also shy cats anyway.  Dogs have a much more obvious discharge... it's easy to miss a cat's cycle... that's how so many people end up with OOPS! litters.  A friend of mine never noticed her cat in heat but wondered why every so often the cat peed in her laundry and hung out at the windows and doors.  I told her she was probably in heat, and her vet confirmed it.  They can come in as often as once a month, depending on the cat, and they can become pregnant again while still nursing a litter.  Cats are REALLY prolific!  I would get her spayed ASAP so you don't have the responsibility of placing kittens.  Most shelters are absolutely overrun with cats and many now refuse to take them.  I rescue street cats and after I've placed cats with everyone I know (and many live with me!), I've run out of places too, and it kills me to see them sick and on the streets.  Unwanted kittens are so easy to prevent, and your kitty will be much happier and calmer!

Hno3mlV5aa	Dolly                        <br>  <br>  Ovelha da ra?a Finn Dorset  <br>  <br>  Os clones n?o chamaram muita aten??o durante anos, pois a clonagem se restringia principalmente a plantas e protozoários. Porém em 1996, um anúncio marcou a história da genética. O escocês Ian Wilmut, do Instituto Roslin, de Edimburgo, com a colabora??o da empresa de biotecnologia PPL Therapeutics conseguiram a proeza de mostrar que era possível a partir de uma célula somática diferenciada clonar um mamífero, tratava-se de uma ovelha da ra?a Finn Dorset chamada de Dolly.<br>  <br>  O maior feito dos cientistas, foi fazer com que uma célula adulta se tornasse totipotente (células-tronco) de novo. As células-tronco (ou totipotentes) possuem a capacidade de se diferenciarem em diferentes tipos de células, em um processo antes considerado irreversível.<br>  <br>  Como foi realizado o processo de clonagem da ovelha Dolly?<br>  <br>  Eles isolaram uma célula mamária congelada de uma ovelha da ra?a Finn Dorset de seis anos de idade e a colocaram numa cultura com baixa concentra??o de nutrientes. Com isso a célula entrou em um estado de latência parando de crescer. Em paralelo, foi retirado o óvulo n?o fertilizado de uma outra ovelha, da ra?a Scottish Blackface, de cor escura. Desse óvulo n?o fertilizado foi retirado o núcleo, transformando-o em um óvulo n?o fertilizado e sem núcleo. Através de um processo de eletrofus?o ocorreu a uni?o do núcleo da ovelha da ra?a Finn Dorset com o óvulo sem núcleo da ovelha da ra?a Scottish Blackface, dando início à divis?o celular: uma célula em duas, duas em quatro, quatro em oito e assim por diante.<br>  <br>  <br>  A esquerda ovelha da ra?a Finn Dorset e a direita ovelha da ra?a Scottish Blackface<br>   <br>  <br>  Na fase de oito a 16 células, as células se diferenciam formando uma massa de células internas originando o embri?o propriamente dito. Após seis dias, esse embri?o, agora com cerca de 100 células, é chamado de blastocisto. O blastocisto foi colocado no útero de uma outra ovelha da ra?a Scottish Blackface que funcionou como "barriga de aluguel". Após a gesta??o, esta ovelha que é escura deu à luz um filhote branquinho da ra?a Finn Dorset chamada Dolly.<br>  Apesar do sucesso da clonagem, a técnica apresentou alguns erros:<br>  <br>  A ovelha Dolly n?o era t?o idêntica ao doador do núcleo, apesar de herdar da ovelha branca o DNA contido nos cromossomos do núcleo da célula mamária, ela também herdou da ovelha escura o DNA contido nas mitoc?ndrias, organelas que ficam no citoplasma das células.<br>  <br>  Com o passar do tempo foi percebido que Dolly apresentava as extremidades dos cromossomos (tel?meros) diminuída gerando envelhecimento celular precoce. Devido ao envelhecimento, Dolly sofria de artrite no quadril e joelho da pata traseira esquerda. Sugere-se que isto ocorra pelo fato de que ela tenha sido criada a partir de uma célula adulta de seis anos (idade da ovelha doadora do núcleo), e n?o de um embri?o.<br>  <br>  Dolly foi sacrificada aos 6 anos de idade, depois de uma vida marcada por envelhecimento precoce e doen?as. Em seus últimos dias, Dolly estava com uma doen?a degenerativa e incurável nos pulm?es. Os problemas de saúde de Dolly levantam dúvidas sobre a possibilidade da prática de copiar a vida.<br>  <br>  Espero ter te ajudado!|`|zhJIuJTRaa	O que é clonagem? <br>  <br>  A palavra clone (do grego klon, significa “broto”) é utilizada para designar um conjunto de indivíduos que deram origem a outros por reprodu??o assexuada. <br>  <br>  A Clonagem é o processo natural ou artificial em que s?o produzidas cópias fiéis de outro indivíduo (homem, animais, etc.), ou seja, a clonagem é o processo que formará um clone. <br>  <br>  O termo clone foi criado em 1903, pelo botanico norte-americano Herbert J. Webber, segundo ele, o clone é basicamente um descendente de um conjunto de células, moléculas ou organismos geneticamente igual à de uma célula matriz. <br>  <br>  O processo de clonagem natural ocorre em alguns seres, como as bactérias e outros organismos unicelulares que realizam sua reprodu??o pelo método da biparti??o, além disso, o tatu também produz um clone através da poliembrionia. <br>  No caso dos humanos, os clones naturais s?o os gêmeos univitelinos, ou seja, s?o seres que compartilham do mesmo material genético (DNA), sendo originado da divis?o do óvulo fecundado. <br>  <br>  No processo de clonagem artificial existem várias técnicas de clonagem, uma delas permite clonar um animal a partir de óvulos n?o fecundados, sendo este processo conhecido desde o século XIX, estes processos eram praticados pelos horticultores que obtinham clones de orquídeas, que através de tecidos meristemáticos de uma planta matriz, originava dezenas de novas plantas geneticamente idênticas. <br>  <br>  Clonagem de Macacos <br>  <br>  A clonagem de macacos foi feita nos Estados Unidos utilizando as mesmas técnicas da ovelha Dolly. <br>  A grande diferen?a deste tipo de clonagem foi pelo fato de utilizarem células de um embri?o e n?o de animais adultos como o caso da ovelha Dolly. <br>  <br>  Quais as vantagens da clonagem? <br>  <br>  As principais vantagens da clonagem s?o: <br>  - A preserva??o de animais em extin??o; <br>  - Desenvolvimento de animais imunes a algumas doen?as que s?o contagiosas; <br>  - Clonagem de células humanas para tratamento de doen?as, como: pancreas para diabéticos e de células do sangue para os leucêmicos. <br>  <br>  taí  só um resuminho

(no wheat)  Innova is a very good brand.<br>  <br>  You should also have your vet check him out.|`|S9MT4Tdaaa	Probably best to take your dog to the vet whilst the pads are sore and inflamed. It really seems to be bothering your dog. It could be a contact or food allergy that needs some antibiotic treatment (& possible an e-collar so your dog doesn't make it worse by licking and biting them). And maybe a food trial as well. <br>  <br>  Best to go back to the vet.|`|3fe3523ea262b21c9696999dcfd348c4aa	It sounds like allergies to me.  I had two chows that did the same thing and I had to give them benedryl.  That is very common.  My best friend is a vet tech and she is always talking about allergies making them chew their feet.  I would just call your vet and ask them what they suggest.|`|Y8R0JAAKaa	Is this a puppy?  If so, he is probably teething and chewing on his feet as so many puppies do.  As long as his pads aren't bleeding I wouldn't be that concerned.  If this is a full grown dog, maybe he walked through something that is causing irritation on his pads..making them itch..which is causing him to chew on them to relieve the itching.  If he's full grown and still chewing you should take him to the vet to make sure he didn't walk through a harmful chemical.

He'll go back for them when he wants them.|`|S9MT4Tdaaa	Its a way for your dog to protect them. He does like them thats why he's hiding them. Dogs can be strange sometimes, hehe.|`|XvLqKTIIaa	YOU BETTER WATCH OUT!! THIS IS A TRUE STORY....

S9MT4Tdaaa	That can be common for overweight cavaliers. Often they snore as well when they're overweight. This extra weight she is carrying is something you want to combat. Cavaliers can be prone to heart conditions and therefore you don't want to put extra strain on them.<br>  <br>  I would recommend adjusting her diet and exercise regime. You might want to consider changing to a restricted calorie premium diet and getting a weight loss program together with your vet.|`|SIKCfUtjaa	jenny craig time then.. when she loses weight it may subside. it may have something to do with her soft palet aswell get her checked by a vet.. most importantly get her fit.|`|7XzqOPZfaa	they always bark and do that type of thing my friend has a CKCS but never grunts shes probably over weight get her checked out
R7xqlZHlaa	Going outside only to use the bathroom, but keep an eye on her so she doesn't get in the dirt. It is only for a week to 10 days at most before they come out.|`|Bw18seFqaa	she can go outside to potty, there's just as many germs on your floors as there are outside..  actually its probably cleaner outside because sunlight kills alot of bacteria!  You should have gotton some post-op instructions from your vet that included how to clean the stitches and what to look for incase of infection.|`|70878cc978ee2e4a79b3b53284340f9caa	You can take her out on a leash to go to the bathroom,and in a few days,for short walks,but I wouldn't just let her out by herself.|`|OdMk802Faa	only to go to the toilet. when my two dogs got spayed we left them in the shed- as they were outside but indoors. The vet should of told you what and what nots. But the main thing is dont let them get dirt or anything else into the stitches or near them due to causing of infections.<br>  hope this helps :)|`|S9MT4Tdaaa	Best to keep her inside unless she needs to go to the toilet. You don't want the area getting dirty or wet.|`|TSgXRO82aa	You didn't say how recently you got her spayed; however, she was most likely rather drowsy from the operation. Once she can walk around comfortably, even if she isn't back to her previous energetic self, you can start taking her for short walks. Make sure they don't tire her out excessively.|`|325e0b3730b94dddaa1a8b6b394531b9aa	She is fine to go outside and short walks ... dogs heal very quickly after 2 days the subcutaneous skin will be closed over she will be fine ... obviously you dont want her rolling in the dirt but she is safe to go out side<br>  Just make sure you check it often to make sure its not red or swollen and that no stiches have been pulled out.<br>  <br>  She'll be fine :)|`|RxMJtU0Aaa	yes, she can go outside. I would try to keep her in as much as possible though. Try not to let her jump up on stuff for 2 days, lift her if she wants to get on stuff. Thank you for fixing your dog|`|e448f0bef286d7af1c4b3208910b6a9baa	She can go out to use the bathroom, but I would keep her in otherwise.|`|gUUua8Rqaa	Re: Stitches<br>  <br>  There is no problem with letting your dog go outside. What we tell the people who come to pick up their dog after being spayed is the dog can lick the stitches, just keep an eye to make sure that she doesn't pull the stitches out and do not bathe the dog for at least 10 days or until the stitches come out. If your dog likes water or you have a ditch or pond where the dog has access to, do not let her near it. If the stitches get wet, it can lead to infection, but licking is ok. If your dog needs a bath before the stitches come out, the pet store usually sells wipes that are used when an owner cannot bathe a pet for some reason or to refresh the pet in between bathings.

M3jRtq2Aaa	Unfortunately you won't get very far with this.  Dogs are considered property in this nation, and do not have individual rights as far as medical care goes.  You could turn in a vet a dozen times, and as long as he is licensed, he would never get in trouble. Dogs are just not humans and have no legal rights.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry.  But this is true.|`|47f74349e402e8397f09c68edb23e07faa	To the Veterinary Board in your state. Look up the info for your state.|`|S9MT4Tdaaa	Depends on which part of the world you are in. There should be a Veterinary Board that you can make a formal complaint to.
nvPHccPbaa	Of course socialization is very important to all dogs, regardless of breed. But yes, some breeds need to be socialized more than others.<br>  <br>  Usually, breeds that are more protective-minded and single-family oriented need more socialization... or at least socialization is more important. <br>  <br>  For example, livestock guardian breeds have been bred for centuries to be mistrustful of strangers, since their job is to guard and protect their flock. When you want such a dog as a family pet, you need to work extra hard to overcome this natural suspicion.<br>  <br>  In some breeds, historically, getting along with people or being comfortable in unusual situations wasn't at all desired. These dogs still hold these instinctual feelings and therefore it's especially important that these breeds get excellent socialization if they are to live in a family, modern-day environment.<br>  <br>  Yes, I'd guess socialization would be more important for Rotties than Bichons. Partly because Rotties are bigger and an out-of-control Rottie can cause a lot more damage than an out-of-control Bichon. I've never known any Rotties personally, but as a breed whose original job was protecting his master, I'd think that he would have a certain amount of natural suspicion. If a person wants their Rottie to be a discerning protective dog, I think socializing such breeds at an early age gives them better judgement in their protection jobs.|`|S9MT4Tdaaa	My opinion is that ALL BREEDS need to be socialized both as puppies and as adults. <br>  <br>  Some people believe that smaller dogs don't need as much social interaction or training but this is just because you have more control over them (example you can pick them up if they get aggressive etc...). Personally i see many smaller dogs with aggression issues as they haven't been adequately trained etc. These dogs can still do some damage to other dogs as well as people if not socialized.<br>  <br>  Of course it is very important to have the ability to restrain and control the larger dogs such as a Rottweiler as they are so strong and could do more damage than a small fluffy dog but i'd recommend all dogs to be socialized and trained!|`|jKoFo0bhaa	No, all puppies should be given the same amount of attention and love.|`|viMIbjrSaa	i really dont see the need for extra/less socialization depending on breed of dog. since i was a child, ive owned dogs as small as pekingnese, up to the size of a 155 lb rottweiler. and honestly, the pekingnese was much more vicious than the rottie. i believe that what matters more is *how* the dog is trained/socialized than how much. <br>  <br>  treat them well, but dont forget that you are the boss. <br>  <br>  simple.|`|679ea46a9c9a6cff9de136eb1bc4263faa	They dont need more socialization, however they need good socialization. This goes for all dogs no matter the breed. Any dog can be trained to be mean, it dont matter the breed. Some dogs just get bad reps because most people choose to make those breeds aggressive;  youre going to take an aggressive rott or pitbull more serious than you would an aggressive pomeranian or bichon. Dont let the stereotypes fool you.|`|Rpj9qArgaa	Yes, Saints need to be socialize ASAP. They grow very large very quickly. It is much harder to train them if they are larger. Jumping on people can be a problem. They also will get quite nippy if not trained early. Most pups are only 10-25 lbs when they are at the very playful stage. A Saint can weigh 90 + Pounds as early as 6 mos of age. It is much harder to control them then. Basic commands are a must as soon as the pup is in your home.|`|TPW7923Caa	All dogs should be socialised from the time they are four weeks old until they draw their last breath.  They should be exposed to as many types, sizes and ages of people, as well as to places, noises and so on as is possible.<br>  <br>  That being said, the more "primative" (original) breeds probably need it a bit more as they are less likely to want to be friends with everyone they meet.|`|wp7eiFfeaa	no but you can make your dog to socialize if your dog is big it might tend to fight with a smaller dog and vice verca|`|zKU8kBXFaa	Well I think dogs like german shepherds, or pitbulls should be socialized more because unno they are mean and if they are not socialize properly they will bite lol.

I think it's the belief that small dogs are naturally "nicer" than big dogs and don't require the same amount of work, socialization, and training that leads to many misbehaving small dogs. <br>  <br>  Good question, though! :)

V019n7vQaa	Australian Shepherds aka Aussies are excellent family dogs. They are generally active and intelligent dogs that could get into things and into trouble and/or develop behavior problems if they do not get enough mental and physical stimulation and exercise, much like any other dogs. The temperament and activity level can vary among  individuals and the line they come from.<br>  If you think you are capable of caring and owning an Aussie or any dog for that matter and if you decide on getting an older dog, make sure it is ok with children of the same age as yours. Equally your children should learn how to treat  their pets well and kindly. <br>  Like many other breeds it is possible for them to get some eye and hip conditions/defects either genetically or environmentally occuring. One way to help avoid getting a dog with any genetic health condition is to get one whose parents have been health cleared and checked for any of the conditions that the breed can get.  Australian Shepherds are generally a healthy breed and compared to many other popular breeds they don't have as many health related issues.<br>  You may find more detailed answers and can learn more about the breed at the Australian Shepherd Club of America's (ASCA) website at asca.org. and the Australian Shepherd Health & Genetics Institute, Inc. at  ashgi.org<br>  <br>  This is coming from an Aussie enthusiast who has been involved and following the breed for over a decade, not from a layman or someone who thinks they know when they really don't.|`|EKcLpIgyaa	I agree with the other posts for the most part. They shed, they can be quit yappy. I have one and he is the opposite of the standard he's lazy, gentle and safe with kids. I do have 2 Dobermans and they are great with children and though they do need exercise but they are gentle irregardless of what uneducated people say. Mine go to nursing homes.

Sure she can go run for 6 acres across your land, but that is not really safe for her.<br>  Aussies do not always do great with children, especially if the dog is not exercised enough.  If the dog does not have a job to do, she will start to herd the children, and that will be a problem.<br>  <br>  I have two Aussies and I adore them, they work very well for me.  But I also compete with them in agility and they are not "family dogs" at all.  They are my companions and wonderful dogs, but they are not all that content with laying around all day lazing around.<br>  <br>  Some breed issues include the fact that they need a ton of mental and physical stimulation every day, they can have sight and hearing disorders, and they can be hard to control because they have such strong prey drive.<br>  <br>  A better family dog for all that land may be a Pointer or Retriever, possible a German Shorthaired Pointer or Flat-Coated Retriever.|`|ea073a7e51b6c89785bcfc0713212cf2aa	Aussies are pushy and dominating, they tend to shove and nip animals and small children.  I think your kids are a little too young for this breed right now.  When they're about 10, you can think about an Aussie- right now, I really think it'd be a dangerous idea.

SZ1J3Upoaa	My boyfriend and I started with our little mini dachshund sleeping with us too. We just get up and take her outside when she starts to move around. I don't think there is a problem as long as he is in a crate when you are not there. Just be warned, there will be no snuggling for the two of your for a while!|`|GbP7359Zaa	Well it depends. Do you move around alot in your sleep? Does your puppy?|`|NBeQyTlMaa	My dogs sleep with me. The truth is, when I have to go away on trips and stuff, I don't sleep good because they aren't with me!! When you want him off your bed for various reasons on occasion, just make him get off. <br>  <br>  If you don't mind it, it's not a bad thing! Really it's just personal preference.<br>  <br>  Sometimes, I do have to admit it is a pain... only when I sleep at my boyfriends house becuase his dogs sleep with him too. So that puts me, him, a chihuahua, a chihuahua dachshund mix, a schnauzer chihuahua mix, and a full blown mutt all in a king size bed. Usually the mutt (as she is a medium sized dog) gets frustrated and goes to sleep in the living room, but the other three stick with us all night long. <br>  <br>  I still don't mind it most of the time though...|`|yPhCujOvaa	It's important that the dog has boundaries and understands that he is in your bed because you invited him, not because it is his bed.  Dogs can start to get defensive and defend the bed as their own if you do not make this clear.  If this happens, you need to address it immediately and not allow the dog in the bed at all any more.<br>  <br>  Also, try to never react to a whine.  If your dog is whining in the middle of the night, hold out for a while before you take it out.  If you crate train your dog, you can teach it to hold it through the night.  Mine whined the first night we got her, but now only whines when we sleep in on the weekends.|`|QVP8zSuWaa	It's not the best thing, sometimes the dog begins to be dominate over the bed, and that is a problem. You should be able to put the dog in his bed at any time without growling and he should know that its your bed not his.|`|43eUq8hOaa	If you both are happy w/it,then it is good.It is only a bad thing if it interferes w/your rest.|`|P2yRAWiJaa	He's a dachshund. It's not like he's going to get to big for your bed. As long as he realizes you are allowing him to sleep there and doesn't get aggressive about it, you're fine.<br>  <br>  I've got 2 Labs (73 lbs and 99 lbs) that like to sleep with me if my husband is gone (he leaves for work early and sometimes I go back to bed for awhile).  Other than that, they know they sleep on their dog beds in their room.|`|yEUo24Znaa	All 4 of my dogs sleep with me. Just get him a ramp if you are afraid he will jump or fall off.   They are great snuggle buddies and serious bedwarmers!  If you like it, then it's fine. If you don't like it, then it is not fine and you should stop right away, and put a sweater on your dachshund when it is that cold out.  They can wear it in the house, too.|`|Z9zzNYNCaa	Do you want a spoiled rotten ill-mannered undisciplined dog?<br>  You have to live w/it,nobody else.<br>  *I* wouldn't put up w/that.|`|s6YmD7vaaa	The bed issue is between you & your man - but be warned... once the puppy becomes used to sleeping with you, your "intimacy" as a couple will be greatly affected.  My husband & I like to fall asleep cuddling, so here's what we do...  We usually lay in bed & watch some TV before going to sleep & we let our pup snuggle with us then.  But when it's "lights out" we tell her it's bedtime & she knows she has to get into her own bed (on the floor next to ours.)  Her bed is heated on cold winter nights & she settles right down when we cover her with her "blankey" (Yes, she's spoiled rotten:-)  In the morning she rejoins us in bed for a quick cuddle - & to let us know she's ready for a trip outside.  Works for us!<br>  <br>  Also gotta say that if it's really cold where you are, you should get your pup some sweaters & coats to protect it from the elements.  I'm NOT a fan of dressing up dogs - but if you have a puppy, short haired breed or a dog (like mine) who really feels the cold, some winter clothing is essential.  And right now it's on sale at most places!<br>  <br>  P.S.  Unless you want to make that middle of the night potty break a routine for the rest of your dog's life, I'd start fazing that out in a month or 2 (when he's fully house trained.)

This may be a reason it looks big on you, it shouldn't be skin tight, but also should not be hanging off you. As for hunt seat you need breeches, a hunt shirt or bib and a jacket...as long as the jacket fits you, it should not make you look "fat". You can try to find a used jacket (they can b really expensive new) all of mine are gently used, but still look really good...and best of all I got them for a great price. I would just tell people at your barn or 4-H club..how you need a hunt jacket, ans someone will probably have one they've out grown or you could try your local tack shop, or www.tacktrader.com. (and for english I personally like wearing the "Hunt Bib" because it is eay to put on, and in summer you are not as hot..if you had a jacket and shirt on.)

I barrel race and that's where we go for my shirts and my jeans. nice, western shirt= about $15 give or take a couple and a pair of jeans is about $10 plus or minus. The only really expensive things are a pair of good, western boots. For those I would recommend biting the bullet and spending some money. I'd suggest either Nokona, Tony Llama, or Justin. those will cost you anywhere from 1 to 4 hundred dollars but they will be well worth the money! those three brands stay together very, very well. if you have larger calf muscles go to the men's section. try on different sizes I wear an 8 1/2-9 in women's shoes and a 7 in men's to give you an idea.<br>  <br>  I'm not as well versed in the English apparel as I am western, but I do know a fix for prices. I'll start by saying that you'll have to spend a little to save a little but I've done the math and it's worth it. I'll first ask if you know how to sew. Yes, I said sew. if not, do you have anyone who gives lessons in your area? Does a friend of family member know how? if the answer to one of those questions is yes, then good. If you don't know how, learn to. It really isn't as hard as people make it out to be. Once you've learned to sew go to Wall Mart or Hobby Lobby or any craft store. They will probably sell fabric. I would recommend Wall Mart, Hobby Lobby, and Hancock in that order. Wall Mart being the cheapest with a fairly large selection of fabric and Hancock being a fabric store, but very pricey. Go to the sewing department and find a pattern for some pants similar to the ones worn in your hunt seat riding. It doesn't need to be exactly the same, because chances are you've been taught how to modify a pattern. Get that pattern! Then you get to hunt for the material used to make said pants. With a little luck, you will have a pair of English riding pants you made for around....30-40 bucks. I don't know it that's cheap or not, but it's a solution. For the shirt and jacket ( that's what I've seen jumpers ride in) Good Will is your friend. Look in there for something even similar and, using your sewing once again, cut and stitch up the shirt and jacket, trust me, it works, my mom did it for four years while I was in a private school with a strict uniform. We made some of mine out of old Good Will shirts. I'm sorry, but I have no idea where to get english boots.<br>  <br>  Now, the last problem. Clothes that don't make you look fat. I know this problem very well for I am fat! lol! one thing I can tell you is dark colors. Darker colors make you look thinner, much, much thinner. The shirts you get from the Wall Mart men's department are also going to be loose and probably baggy. Don't take them up. Loose clothing creates the illusion that you are thinner and the clothes are smaller (sort of, I can't really describe this very well, but it does work! same if it's tucked in) if you don't want solid colors buy vertical stripes. they not only make you look thinner but taller. those three things right there are the three "rules" that I follow when I look at shirts. Now, for the pants/jeans get ones that make you fight to get in them. they will force you to suck in if they are blue jeans, I do this as well. for regular pants try to find the ones that are a stiff enough material (if buying or, if sewing reinforce the waist with a still jean-like material so it will have the same effect) I say to make sure you have to fight to get in them because they will stretch. If they are almost too small, they will be perfect when they stretch. If they fit me fine and I don't have to fight them to get into them they tend to fall off when they stretch out!<br>  <br>  As for something cute, your "Wall Mart special" shirts won't be too cute at first, but while you are in that hobby store looking for patterns and material look for a bedazzler or something similar and some crystals. When you get the thing home you can stick the crystals onto the collar,cuffs, pockets, etc. of the western shirts. It may seem a bit much just for some clothes, and the bedazzler is about $20 with the crystals being who-knows-how-much ( run from Swarovski! you'll pay about $15 for five crystals!) but I promise in the long run it will save you a *TON* of money in the long run!!
Ue5NoJOgaa	The best thing about them is that, if you find the right vet you can get their "scent glands" (I don't know if that is what they really are) removed and they are much more pleasant to own.  It is basically the exact same procedure they do with ferrets to keep them from spraying.

Try changing the material you use in his cage to something different (if you are using wood shavings try using fine peat or soil). Make sure you provide lots of toys and tubes for him to play with and chew on to keep him entertained (it may be boredom that's make him do something over and over hence giving him the sore). <br>  <br>  If it doesn't get any better in the next week or so (or gets worst in the next few days).

ks2z4po8aa	Unlike some of the more vocal dogs (i.e. Poodles or German Schnauzers, Beagles, etc.) - the French Bulldog isn't generally considered a barker... They will bark, naturally, but not a lot unless there is noise, chaos, traffic or they happen to be in a heightened state of alarm... <br>  <br>  On the temperament issue, that really all depends on the particular dog... Frenchies are companion dogs... They tend to gravitate towards people and they love to be in your company just about 24/7... Some get along perfectly well with other dogs, and some just don't... Whether it's due to their pecking order in their litter, or whether they've suffered a trauma or been bitten by another dog, or whether another dog poses a threat, one really can't generalize and say that one dog is going to get along with other dogs... I have four Frenchies, they get along perfectly well and are well-socialized with other dogs... But I've also studied dog training so my dogs know that I rule the pack and that other dogs don't pose any threat to them... Some Frenchies can be rather a nuissance with some of the bigger dogs... Some Frenchies happen to live with Chihuahuas and manage to be perfectly well behaved around smaller dogs... What you really need to understand is that there are no absolutes or steadfast rules that apply... It just depends on the dog and their particular temperament and how well you happen to be as a guardian. <br>  <br>  Best wishes in your endeavors.|`|0vokc0u5aa	We just got a French Bulldog puppy a few weeks ago, and I have yet to hear one loud bark.

For the most part, I haven't found Frenchies to be too vocal, though some can definitely be talkers.  I personally have never met an aggressive French Bulldog, and if you're going through a rescue, I doubt they would adopt out an aggressive dog.<br>  <br>  It couldn't hurt to check the dog out!  Please do a lot of research before committing to any breed!|`|KxjUim7yaa	I didn't know there were homeless ones. I like them a lot.
OxFsslN8aa	The worst thing you can do is force the situation.  Separate the dogs with a baby gate which allows them to see and smell one another without having to be near each other.  Allow the dogs to decide if they want to meet.  If the other dog is very balanced and calm, there is a good chance that your dog will slowly come to check it out on her own.  Look up counter-conditioning and read what methods you can use to help your dog be less afraid.|`|XDNS53mhaa	Hi there,<br>  <br>  Well you're dog does not like other dogs because sometimes they can't control there body language and soo that's how they some times never like dog's.<br>  <br>  Have A Nice Day!|`|6SeWCfUfaa	Well ... the dog is under socialized.  And would benefit GREATLY from further obedience classes.  Obedience builds confidence in shy dogs.  There is no two ways around that.  Yea, it takes time and yea, you'll have to spend A LOT more time getting that dog out and socializing her in safe environments.  Every single positive interaction she has with other people and dogs will help her "desensitize" to what is very stressful to her right now.<br>  <br>  You're probably going to get a lot of advice on here on how to introduce these two dogs and I would suggest you don't follow it.  Because every positive interaction will help a little bit and any negative interactions will hurt her progress a lot or even make her worse.  You really need to start her socialization under the supervision of a pro, someone that can read dogs well and with dogs that are known to be nonreactive.  <br>  <br>  The puppy class you went to, I'd love to smack that trainer for not helping you find situations where your puppy wouldn't be hiding under the chair and for not making it clear to you that the puppy needs a TON more work in this area.  And it does.  This isn't something you should just ignore.  The pup is feeling extreme stress every time a new dog comes around.  Sure she may not go out much, but what if you have to board her or have her stay at the vets because she's sick?  She'll be surrounded by other dogs and under a lot more stress than she should be in situations where you'd want her to be feeling low stress.<br>  <br>  So get out there and find a really good behaviorist/trainer and get working on her obedience and socialization under their supervision.  That is the best thing you could ever do for this dog.|`|kvHqnR5Haa	I have had bad luck with introducing dogs while on leashes.  It just makes them want to get to the other one more.  I have had better luck letting them sniff each other out and get used to each other.  My dog was scared to death of other dogs for the first week or so after I adopted him.  He did get used to it.  <br>  <br>  I also have a friend that has a dog that doesn't like other dogs.  For three years he wouldn't go near another dog because he was scared.  A few months ago they started taking him to a doggy day care for a few hours twice a week and he warmed up and loves it there now.  I don't know if it is because they are trained to handle situations like that, but it sure helped!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|yPhCujOvaa	If you can, try to get your sister's dog to either greet with it's side, or offer it's butt for sniffing to show your dog that your sister's dog offers no threat.  I would use the leash, only to be able to break something up without getting hurt yourself.  If your dog is growling and showing teeth, it is okay.  This is a warning signal.  She is saying "this is my space, I don't know you, back off."  If you leave her, the other dog will probably respect that warning and back off.  In my opinion, showing warning signs is a good thing.  Would you prefer she just bite?<br>  <br>  I just wonder how you react in these situations?  When you socialize your dog, do you coddle her when she cowers in the corner, do you talk to her, pet her?  If so, this is like saying "It is okay to be nervous and anxious around other dogs."

ks2z4po8aa	As you can see, the cost of French Bulldogs vary, however, no one gave you an accurate answer since they presently happen to be a popular and over-bred breed that are attracting all the latecomers...<br>  <br>  I paid $2700 back in 1992 for a pet French Bulldog that came with a mandatory spay contract and limited registration... ALL ETHICAL AND REPUTABLE BREEDERS sell their puppies with mandatory spay / neuter contracts... <br>  <br>  The best breeders today (most of whom presently happen to be in Kansas City, attenting the National French Bulldog shows) charge upwards of $3,000.00 for females with spay contracts... Some males can be negotiated for $2500 to $3000... We're talking about the BEST breeders in the country... Those that show in conformation, health-screen, genetically test their dogs, and genuinely strive to produce sound, exemplary, well-tempered dogs according to standards... <br>  <br>  Sadly, most of the puppies available these days are produced by backyard breeders and puppy-mills... They can have websites promising AKC-registration and copy+paste the assorted texts of reputable breeders to deceive the unsuspecting public... Would any person know how to discern a backyard breeder from a responsible breeder if they're looking at websites? Not very likely...<br>  <br>  For any person wanting a French Bulldog, their best bet is to visit the national club: <a href="http://www.frenchbulldogclub.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.frenchbulldogclub.org</a> scrolling through the breeders in their state, then extending their search... You then cross-check those breeders at <a href="http://www.frenchieinfo.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.frenchieinfo.com</a> to ensure that the paired dogs have attained their championships... Most importantly, you ask the breeders whether their dogs have been OFA or PENN/HIP certified (for spines, patellas, hips and hearts), as well as BAER-tested and CERF-certified for hearing and vision.<br>  <br>  People that pay disreputable breeders a thousand to two-thousand for a puppy usually wind up with huge veterinary bills in the first four years... It's not unheard of for people to pay $6000 to $10,000 in vet bills between years 1 through 4 of a dog's life... Allergies are rampant, Osteo problems are costly, debilitating and severe... A dog from a reputable hobby breeder may seem expensive, but is generally vigorous and healthy...<br>  <br>  I have 4 French Bulldogs, by the way... They're all HEALTHY! Not a single one of them has any allergies... Their X-rays are nothing scary ... Not a single one of them has required corrective surgery of any kind... They survive just fine in year-round warm weather in South Florida... Good breeding makes a difference... <br>  <br>  Just something to ponder if you're seriously contemplating a French Bulldog... You can certainly get a French Bulldog for $1,000 to $2,000, but it'll probably cost you 5 to 10 times that amount in vet bills for buying from backyard breeders that don't genetically test their dogs and don't strive to produce healthy dogs... <br>  <br>  Best wishes in your endeavors,<br>  <br>  TM <br>  <br>  |`|Mnaxsehxaa	Pure breeds are 1,800 and up.

This is pretty average for the breed.<br>  <br>  They are small dogs, so food, toys, etc won't be that expensive, but vet care may be.  Because of the way their heads are surgery (because of the anesthesia) is more risky and some vets won't do it.  They also tend to have breathing problems which could lead to more vet care that a dog with a longer snout.  It is important to get a vet that is comfortable with the breed.|`|AA11860101	Up to at least $2,000 from a responsible breeder, unless you go to <a href="http://www.frenchbulldogrescue.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.frenchbulldogrescue.org/</a> which is another fine option.<br>  <br>  You may also be able to find them on <a href="http://www.petfinder.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.petfinder.org</a><br>  <br>  Pretty much every dog is expensive, especially depending on it's health; another reason to avoid backyard breeders like the plague.|`|gFdeLDyIaa	They are very expensive.

AA11117811	It's hard when a pet dies, especially when you get another that is similar to you first. I know. My first cat ever was a pure black male cat I named Midnight. He died of Feline Leukimia, but I'm not going to go into certain details of possible prevention. Then my grandma brought home three litter mates. I was given the black one. She looked exactly like Midnight! What I said to myself is that his spirit must have come back as her so I wouldn't be lonely. I think that happens a lot, and could have happened to you. Nobody will ever replace your cat, but now that you have to take care of another, it will help ease the pain. Here is a poem I give to all who have lost a pet, because it helped me so much: <br>  <br>  RAINBOW BRIDGE<br>  Just this side of heaven is a place called Rainbow Bridge. <br>  <br>  When an animal dies that has been especially close to someone here, that pet goes to Rainbow Bridge. <br>  There are meadows and hills for all of our special friends so they can run and play together. <br>  There is plenty of food, water and sunshine, and our friends are warm and comfortable. <br>  <br>  All the animals who had been ill and old are restored to health and vigor; those who were hurt or maimed are made whole and strong again, just as we remember them in our dreams of days and times gone by. <br>  The animals are happy and content, except for one small thing; they each miss someone very special to them, who had to be left behind. <br>  <br>  They all run and play together, but the day comes when one suddenly stops and looks into the distance. His bright eyes are intent; His eager body quivers. Suddenly he begins to run from the group, flying over the green grass, his legs carrying him faster and faster. <br>  <br>  You have been spotted, and when you and your special friend finally meet, you cling together in joyous reunion, never to be parted again. The happy kisses rain upon your face; your hands again caress the beloved head, and you look once more into the trusting eyes of your pet, so long gone from your life but never absent from your heart. <br>  <br>  Then you cross Rainbow Bridge together.... <br>  <br>  I hope this helps :)|`|UM1QeLq3aa	Aww. You poor dear. Losing a pet is so hard. I had a lot of cats for a while and they gradually died off. I swore I'd never get a pet again, but I found myself really yearning for a cat. I made sure I got cats who were totally different than the previous cats. I jokingly told people I went out and got me some fresh cats. Try to look at your new cat and think of how different the new one is from the previous cat. Try to appreciate those differences and think of her  as a fresh start. And allow yourself to grieve. Its natural.|`|Pe3MDm05aa	ahhh , bless your heart.  It was just too soon for you to "move on".<br>  <br>  I went through the exact thing, balled hysterically for days on end....but then someone pointed out to me something:<br>  <br>  <br>  she said, "just think of this, [my cat] was there with me through all my years of growing up, bad and good.  She comforted me when I was sad, and played with me when we were in good moods.  She purred me to sleep, and woke me up with her sweet licks or nuzzling lol.  She was my best friend....but it was her time to move on, and she lasted a LONG time for a cat.<br>  My friend pointed out that she realized I would finally be ok without her, I was safe and mature and she could let go and rest.<br>  <br>  She's in a better place now, and I still have her picture on my mantel.<br>  <br>  Eventually the depression and sadness will turn to fond memories and smiles.<br>  <br>  Hang in there, I know it's hard.<br>  <br>  :)|`|tvzZsfZDaa	I'm very sorry for your loss.  My cat died last month at 19.5.  I'm still very sad and I cry unexpectedly too.  <br>  <br>  It was very nice of you to take on another cat.  Understand it has a different personality.  It's okay for the cat to be different and have other lovable qualities as well :)<br>  <br>  I hope it helps.|`|LsKb9Rpzaa	You are still mourning understandably.  It will take a while, but you will stop comparing at some point and no longer feel a need to cry.  This sort of thing takes time.  Just know that the cat will love you unconditionally no matter what.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry for your loss.|`|rDm82x5Baa	vgfdc|`|i8M3Ixb6aa	A very similar thing happened to me a while ago. I lost a cat that I had had since I was born suddenly. It actually took me a long time to get over and I still get sad when I think of her. I guess for some of us it can be our first experience of death of something we love. So my only advice is that time will help. You will still always feel a little sad if you think of this cat but it will get better. Try not to compare your new cat with your old. Of course you will not feel the same bond but animals are like humans, we love each differently.|`|hqSWUc8uaa	I know what you mean.. 2 years ago I had to put my cat Sassy down cuz she got sick and I've gotten a kitten since (about 6 months after) and I love her dearly but sometimes I still miss my Sassy-girl... and it's been 2 years! I didn't have her as a kitten but I did have her for 7 years and she was my sweetest tempered kitty (I had 2 others besides her, whom I still have)<br>  <br>  It's definitely better than it was especially since getting the new cat but I do still think about her... they just become such a part of the family, and it's hard not to get attached to those cute little furballs/furbabies :)<br>  <br>  Chin up... it WILL get better, I promise! Give it more time...<br>  <br>  Sorry about your loss *hugs*

ks2z4po8aa	Besides contacting the breeders of the FBDCA, here's a great link on what to look for in a puppy in terms of conformation, coat color, ears, nares, nose colors, tails, etc: <a href="http://www.ncfbc.com/EDUCATION/breeders_tell.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ncfbc.com/EDUCATION/breeders_...</a> There are also links describing disc disorders, spinal issues, and brachysephalic syndrome on the top portion.<br>  <br>  There are only TWO hobby breeders listed in the State of Illinois: <br>  Merri Ann Gonzalez, Chato Kennel <br>  Park Forest, 708-805-9333, chato@wildblue.net <br>  <a href="http://www.frenchbulldog.com/chato" rel="nofollow">http://www.frenchbulldog.com/chato</a> <br>  <br>  Jill Neidig, Bella Ridge French Bulldogs <br>  Mt.

They're not necessarily puppy mills in the derogatory sense, but they dedicate their lives to breeding and showing dogs as opposed to being retired or having other day-time professions... Lots of large-sized kennels will breed many litters per year and may own and show two to five different breeds of dogs... <br>  <br>  There's no place to check rankings in the classic sense, however, many of the breeders will be attending the national FB dog show in Kansas City this month... At the end of that week, there'll be the listing of the national champion, the best in show, the best "bred by" and so on, so forth... The breeders should be cross-referenced on the Orthopedic Foundation of America (www.offa.org) or PENN-HIP to ensure that their mature (breeding) dogs are X-rayed for spines, hips, patellas and hearts... You should ask them whether their dogs are CERF-certified for eyes... And BAER-tested for hearing (besides pied dogs, some Frenchies can be deaf or hard-of-hearing)...<br>  <br>  And, remember, if you're determined to get a puppy from a local breeder, it may take several months to a couple of years before they breed a litter or have pet puppies available... You should write a polite letter of inquiry, fill in their application forms, and ask to be placed on their waiting list... The more details you provide, the likelier you'll be considered an ideal placement for a well-bred puppy. <br>  <br>  Best wishes in your endeavors.<br>  <br>  TM  <br>  <br>   |`|U69ofDvaaa	<a href="http://www.frenchbulldogclub.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.frenchbulldogclub.org/</a><br>  <a href="http://akc.org" rel="nofollow">http://akc.org</a><br>  <a href="http://breeders.net" rel="nofollow">http://breeders.net</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.geocities.com/Petsburgh/Fair/1901/chart.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/Petsburgh/Fair/...</a><br>   <a href="http://petfinder.com" rel="nofollow">http://petfinder.com</a><br>   <a href="http://petharbor.com" rel="nofollow">http://petharbor.com</a>|`|AA11709234	Start here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.frenchbulldogclub.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.frenchbulldogclub.org/</a><br>  <br>  They will have a breeder referral.

They WILL have a contact for the parent club of the breed and you can go through them to locate breeders in your area.  Just because a breeder is a member of the parent club does NOT mean they are good breeders.  You will have to educate yourself as to how to discern what entails a good or bad breeder.   A good way to do that is to locate a mentor in the breed - someone very knowledgeable in the breed that can let you know the various health, temperament and structural issues in the breed.  Some general red flags to know a breeder is crappy include: they have an advertisement on the AKC site, they sell puppies on the internet, they have 'testimonials' to sell puppies, they have frequent litters out of unfinished, unhealth and temperament evaluated dogs and have a lot of dogs and b*tches so they have a frequent litter, take credit cards, have onsight dogs that they breed to instead of finding the best possible mate for their b*tch (the best usually isn't that convenient!).<br>  <br>  Good luck...

In Miami-Dade County, for example, it is a crime to tether a dog on a chain or a rope and leave them outdoors in gardens, tethered to signs, parking meters, trees...

Vedono il giallo e il viola ed altri contorni in B e N, <br>   non riescono a cogliere le sfumature. Per esempio un cane non riesce a vedere una pallina blu in un prato verde, se però la pallina è rossa ci riesce. Vedono più che altro i contrasti fra alcuni colori.|`|yo0nyi8Uaa	non tutti quelli che vediamo noi.ma in bianco e nero non vedono!!|`|G8FcFDJqaa	no|`|JOLqB0eyaa	HO LETTO CHE :Il meccanismo di percezione dei colori è identico nell'uomo e<br>  nel cane. Quando uno stimolo luminoso giunge alla retina attraverso la pupilla, delle cellule<br>  sensibili dette fotorecettori (i coni, che servono alla percezione dei colori, e i bastoncelli, impiegati<br>  per la visione crepuscolare), lo trasformano in impulso nervoso che viene trasmesso al cervello,<br>  dove avviene l'elaborazione che permette il riconoscimento dei colori. I dati ottenuti provano che -<br>  come gli umani daltonici - i cani non distinguono il blu-verde (circa 480 nm) dalla luce bianca.<br>  Un secondo esperimento ha provato che i cani sono sensibili anche alle sfumature che vanno dal<br>  violetto all'indaco, al blu, mentre confondono i colori rosso, arancione, giallo e giallo-verde, pur<br>  distinguendoli dal bianco. Dunque una pallina arancione lanciata nell'erba è facilmente visibile per<br>  l'uomo ma non per il cane, che vede tutto giallo.<br>  Per lo stesso motivo se una persona, in un prato, vuole essere facilmente individuata a distanza da<br>  "Fido", deve indossare un abito blu o viola, perché al cane risulta molto evidente il contrasto di<br>  questo colore contro il "giallo" circostante. Questione di fiuto Per capire davvero quali stimoli<br>  riceve il cane dal mondo che lo circonda, bisogna tenere sempre presente che al centro<br>  dell'esperienza che gli animali hanno della realtà c'è l'odorato.<br>  Nei miei cagnetti nn ho ancora capito bene quanto distinguono il colore,però ci vedono molto bene e riconoscono gli oggetti con il loro nome ..................|`|OIryTdeXaa	che io sappia i cani vedono bianco e nero... e i cani aggressivi vedono anche la fisionomia della posizione delle vene (ma non so se è vero!!) sono certa che non vedono i colori me lo ha confermato + di un veterinario. cao|`|QMcVVBcVaa	i cani vedono come le persone daltoniche e con circa 100 decimi in piu|`|TcbWdv89aa	Secondo me sì anche se per i cani è più importante l'odore, comunque le persone le riconoscono molto bene, penso con il cuore! I cani non sono come gli umani per fortuna ed hanno altri gradi di valori!|`|YtFdWyKEaa	vedono i colori.. ma non riescono a distinguerli, solo se contrastanti.. e poi non percepiscono le sfumature|`|ZURlpUTbaa	vedono bianco e nero|`|bJahKqH3aa	oh ma quante idiozie si leggono NON DARE ASCOLTO.<br>  la gente parla per sentito dire invece che farsi una piccola cultura, basterebbe leggere un pò d + e non fidarsi del primo che parla.. comunque per risponderti<br>  Cani e gatti non vedono come noi. La percezione dei colori non è assente come si credeva: questi animali hanno scarsa percezione dei verdi e dei rossi, mentre i colori a cui sono più sensibili sono giallo e viola. Il gatto, inoltre, vede i colori molto più attenuati, sfocati. Per quanto riguarda l’acutezza visiva, gli uomini sono più dotati.<br>  La capacità di distinguere dettagli separati e di metterli a fuoco è, rispetto a quella umana, ridotta del 50% nei cani e dell’80% nei gatti. Punto forte a loro vantaggio è la capacità di percepire il movimento: riescono a individuare un oggetto che si muove anche a 900 metri di distanza. Inoltre, grazie a una speciale retina, il “Tapetum lucidum” che funziona come un catarifrangente, riescono a vedere anche in condizioni di scarsa luminosità. <br>  <br>  per avere una descrizione + dettagliata e spiegata con termni tecnici da OCULISTI quindi studi scientifici che dimostrano la teoria ti consiglio questo sito!|`|chxcxeZEaa	Da 17 ricerche importanti sulla vista dei cani, 9 arrivano alla conclusione che vedono solo in bianco e nero e 8 che hanno qualche piccola percezione del colore.<br>  Con o senza colore la quantità totale d'informazione che mettono insieme gli occhi, perché sia elaborata dal cervello, è incredibile.<br>  Però se il cervello del cane ha una gran quantità di materiale da elaborare possiamo immaginare la difficoltà di classificare i messaggi che arrivano dagli occhi che si muovono in due direzioni contemporaneamente|`|i1mQ7tEoaa	Certo che li vedono!!!|`|nWCNxca6aa	No, solo bianco e nero....

Trim her claws.|`|6cbce34f6d81808399f7101c75d8526baa	If it were me and being your dragon is the age you say, I would go back to washed play sand. Calisand causes problems so I would not use that or any sort of bark or aspen is not recommended. All of mine are well over a year old and a couple are above 2 and I have had no problems. If you are concerned sift the play sand good before you put him on it. I do this when I change my sand. I have read all about what they say in that sand is bad but using it correctly as I have also read causes no problems. You can always fashion a feeding platform on which to put their salad. I simply took some dowel rods and screwed them to the bottom of a piece of luan plywood. Wash that reptile carpet that you have and hot glue it to the platform and you have a cheap feeding and basking platform. I put one of these in all 5 of my tanks for my dragons. I put their worms in their salads and then they are not eating directly on the sand. You can build the platform to fit your tank as well. If you are using crickets and are concerned, simple take him out to another container and let him eat the crickets and then put him back.|`|wEc3XzExaa	I have used calcium sand for years never had a problem. Do NOT use cat litter it can cause gut impactation and your beardie can die. Calcium sand is expensive but wont vcause problems. I just use a sifter to clean the sand and ever so often remove sand and clean tank. Replace sand every 6-8 months|`|37mkCq7jaa	I have 2 beardies (girls) and they were born on sand and still live on sand.  I change it fully about once every 6-8weeks but you could leave it longer it you wish.  There is a lot of confussion on what is the best substrate for your beardie and impaction is the most feared of all reptile owners.  However, i know many people with reptiles and also am regularly in contact with breeders of beardies and other reptiles and sand has always been used.  Dont waste your money on calcium sand.  It is expensive and can be dangerous when ingested, although it says it is safe on the pack dont be fooled.  I use childrens play sand.  Sieve through every day and things will stay safe and fresh. <br>  Hope this helps!|`|30pY0wNgaa	aspen, pine, but NOT cedar, it cause respirtory infections. Use newspapers if that doesnt work.

ks2z4po8aa	Years ago I too made the progression from Bostons to French Bulldogs... My beloved Iggy Pop was an amazing Boston Terrier, practically self-trained, in all honesty, as he was a delightful dog that went everywhere!!!! I'd even sneak him on Amtrak trains when commuting between DC and New York, and the ticket-collectors were always amazed at how well-behaved he was in the gorgeous see-through cat case I toted him in... Alas, he passed away, and after mourning his loss I too weighed my options... <br>  <br>  I purchased a French Bulldog in 1992... This was long before the world wide web ever existed... Long before the flood of imports... And long before froggies were ever bred irresponsibly by backyard breeders and puppy-millers... No store had ever heard of a French Bulldog because they could only be obtained from hobby breeders... So, I was very lucky... Our beloved froggie was incredibly healthy... She traveled the world in a Sherpa bag, living abroad in South America for a couple of years, and commuting between New York and South Florida... She walked to work every day... She was a dear, darling friend... And she lived to be 14!!!! never spending more than 2 nights in the hospital (the first, when she was spayed; and the second time when she accidentally ingested some chocolates)...<br>  <br>  Do your homework... There are A LOT of unscrupulous and misleading breeders... Use the web search engines to visit websites, but don't believe everything you read... Champion European bloodlines is a key phrase to disguise Eastern European imports that have virtually no champions since the mid 1990s as they all come from puppy mills or backyard breeders that do no actual health-screening... Cross-reference breeders that are on the AKC, along with the national FBDCA, then check the Orthopedic Foundation of America, CERF (eye database), and ensure that they do BAER (hearing) testing if searching for a pied dog... You can have fun with pedigrees visiting www.frenchieinfo.com and you'll find a wealth of information at www.frenchbulldogz.org <br>  <br>  French Bulldogs are great when they're well bred and healthy... They can also be a major cause of concern and dig deep into your pockets if you buy an unhealthy dog... I have 4 froggies and they only visit the vet a couple of times of the year for annual vaccinations and routine check-ups... They're blessed with good genes... <br>  <br>  Learn everything you possibly can, and ask lots and lots of questions.<br>  <br>  Sorry for your loss of Gizmo, by the way... I find it easier to just remember what a great dog Iggy Pop was, but I avoid comparisons to my adorable Gunther because there's no use in comparing our pets. <br>  <br>  Good luck in your endeavors.<br>  <br>  TM|`|x2OqccF3aa	Here is about French Bulldogs, and their temperament, life expectancy, description, height, weight, photos, etc.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/frenchbulldog.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/frenchbulldo...</a><br>  <br>  Here is the Boston:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/bostonterrier.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/bostonterrie...</a><br>  <br>  Hope this helped=) Sorry for the loss=( Good luck!|`|W5vBsyuBaa	i'd get a French Bulldog is I were you. sorry, i don't know enough about them to compare intelligence or health, but French Bulldogs are very cute and you wouldn't want to end up comparing a new Boston Bulldog with Gizmo.|`|Bg9Sfx0Yaa	We have an 12 yr old cock-er spaniel, and our daughter wants a british bull dog but our dog is still healthy.|`|Cfk1kr8Daa	I would certainly respect your decision not to get another Boston, but dogs tend to have different personalities, and often looks don't matter.<br>  <br>    Take a look at these guys, and see if there is anyone you might learn to love...there are loads to choose from, all deserving.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://members.petfinder.com/~RI76/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://members.petfinder.com/~RI76/index...</a><br>  <br>   THere is also a dog that someone is trying to rehome, who wrte on Yahoo this morning - BJ...needs a new home, and a new name, looks like a great bully dog for you?<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ak54Drq1svpDfzNzNiza3QTty6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20080712035358AATwGoY&show=7#profile-info-Pg7WEBmnaa">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>

Xa9esMTEaa	Wow did he steal that from somebody's overly tacky e-book? Anyway, it might be a nail bed infection which would require anti-biotics which means you're going to have to go see a vet about it. I had a dog with a nasty nailbed infection that wouldn't go away completely, I finally told my vet to remove the entire nail and when he did we found a inch and a half long thorn sitting in there. It was sick and smelled aweful but it healed up nicely after that although his new toenail looked a bit abused when it grew back in!|`|MKuDawP7aa	Dogs cannot be tamed without proper knowledge. They have many peculiar ways of showing their discomfort. A healthy dog is liked by one and all. To have a healthy dog one has to patiently handle all its basic necessities. To know the basic necessities, one has to improve their knowledge about dogs.<br>  <br>  Dogs to be tamed should be taken care of properly. Its nails are also an important part of its body. Trimming of dog’s nails is essential. White nails can be easily trimmed. A dog with black nails cannot be trimmed easily. If one is unable to trim, they have to go to veterinary doctor or to groomers who will do the work efficiently. Nail cutting should be done on a regular basis, or else dogs may refrain from letting one cut their nails.<br>  <br>  Dogs have long nails. Some dogs do not like their nails trimmed. The nails of a dog should not touch the ground. The noise of nails scratching the floor is a sign for the dogs to undergo nail trimming. There are certain differences in certain dogs. Dogs walking on hard surfaces have a habit of maintaining their nails. Longhaired dog nails should be trimmed very carefully with trimmers. In the same manner hairs at the bottom of the foot should be removed, as it is necessary for them to have a grip on the floor. Soft nail clips can be put to dog’s paws so that it does not hurt human beings skin. Dogs are very sensitive and so to avoid them from getting infected these nails are put on.<br>  <br>  Dogs are very sensitive and so they get irritated and inflamed very quickly. Utmost care has to be taken to keep it healthy. Healthy can be maintained only with regular attention. Every part of the body has to be taken care of from the puppy stage. A periodical checkup with a veterinary doctor will help one to maintain the fitness of a dog.|`|zKyy1gE2aa	The best thing to do when your animal is in pain for more than 24 hours is to take them to the vet and have them diagnose and treat your animal. That's what they are there for. If you've already tried to help your dog and it didn't work, you should take the dog into the vet. Could be a number of things wrong, ingrown nail, infection in the foot etc.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|GaL66jbQaa	Don't use alcohol  that will make it more irritated. he might have allergies and need a change in diet.  try diets that are corn free and don't have gluten.

Ue5NoJOgaa	Sugar gliders are just like any other small mammal in that they are relatively tough, if they break a bone they will probably live, and if they get sick they will probably get better (with proper care), vet costs depend on your current vet you are seeing (I would see someone who specializes in exotic animals).  I had sugar gliders a while back and the biggest issue with their health is that they are needy little things, they don't like their schedules to change, or their owners to go away for any extended period of time (mine would flip after like 18 hours), they can even stop eating and die during owners vacations (rare but it can happen), so the best advice I can give you is to treat em like little kids....that is sort of how they want to be treated.|`|AA10356572	<br>  <a href="http://www.gomestic.com/Pets/Unusual-Pets-Sugar-Gliders.77597" rel="nofollow">http://www.gomestic.com/Pets/Unusual-Pet...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  this link is good - but sickness is unpredicable..<br>  <br>  as far as Vets go - every city is different - you need to call the vet and ask if they are experienced with Gliders or not.

It very well could be something that is not your fault.  You should try and work on getting him/her to like you.  A few ways to do that is for you to feed him/her everyday instead of whoever is feeding. You could even hand feed.  Give the dog lots of treats, take the dog for a walk ect. Do something with the dog that will help you two become closer friends.  I know its frustrating to have a dog hate you for no reason but if you work at it you will become friends.
oDVx7nSxaa	The quicker you can get them to the vet, the better, as they may need to be wormed and flea treated.  Make your vet appointment for the day after you bring them home, then that will be all behind you and they can settle in afterwards!  <br>  <br>  If you've got any pet-owning friends or coworkers, ask them who they use and why they use them.  While price is always a factor, the cheapest vet in town generally not your best choice, and the most expensive one isn't always the best either.  Don't be afraid to stop in and ask questions.  The reception area should be clean of course.  Be sure to ask if their vets are required to take continuing education courses - that's really important that they keep up to date on the latest research and recommendations.  (It's amazing the number of vets out there who still insist on annual vaccinations, even though the AVMA now recommends 3 year boosters).   Ask what their vaccination protocols are, and eliminate any vets who insist on giving our indoor cats any of the "non core" vaccines like FeLV, FIV, FIP, and others.  They are not necessary for indoor cats, and really expose them to vaccine risks they do not need (all for the sake of making money).  <br>  <br>  While you have them at the vet for their very first visit, make their spay/neuter appointments.  The boys can be done at 2 pounds/8 weeks, the girls at 2 1/2 pounds/10 weeks.  This way you never, ever have to worry about such issues as spraying, unwanted pregnancies, and any of the female health issues (like pyometria and mammary cancer).    <br>  <br>  Enjoy your babies!

KEYgd73saa	Fungus Clear is a fine product, but there are other, better choices.  Malachite green and formalin are some of the most effective treatments for fungus (Saprolegnia is a fungus), which means medications with malachite green and formalin, like Quick Cure and Rid Ich, are some of the best choices, and my recommendations.

9rYqq25Raa	Ciao! <br>  Beh inanzi tutto le tarta hanno bisogno di molto spazio per nuotare.. quindi devi procurarle un'acquaterrario bello grande!.. con una zona emersa facilmente accessibile dalle tue piccole in cui ci devono poter stare tutte e due alla volta... devi fare in modo che tutti i giorni prenda direttamente il sole ( nella zona emersa ) ma sempre con un pò di ombra.. il sole le aiuta ad assimilare le vitamine, produrre la vitamina D3 e rafforzare il carapace ( il ramollimento di quest'ultimo comporterebbe la morte della tue tartarughe ).. quindi il sole è di vitale importanza per le tartarughe, se non hai la possibilità di metterla al sole devi per forza procurarti una lampada per rettili UVB al 5%, ( ti può costare dai 13 ai 25 euro )queste lampade hanno le stesse funzioni del sole!... Un'altra cosa che ti devi procurare è la lampada spot specie in inverno che serve a riscaldare la zona emersa delle tarte! quella ti viene a costare intorno ai 10 euro dipende dalla capacità di watt! ( il meglio per le tartarughe sarebbe come minimo 40 watt ) <br>  <br>  <br>  Penso che la tua tarta sia una Trachemys scripta scripta ( tartarughe delle orecchie gialle ) sono quelle più comuni e sono splendide nuotatrici... la regola è che l'acqua deve essere alta tanto da permettere alla tartaruga di immergersi completamente,,, quindi l'acqua deve essere il doppio della lunghezza del carapace della tua tarta. L'acqua deve essere tiepida ovvero dai 23 ai 27 C°...e in inverno siccome è piccola ti consiglio di tenere sempre l'acqua tiepida in modo tale di non farla andare in letargo, e quindi ti devi procurare un termoriscaldatore che serve a tenere la temperatura dell'acqua tiepida infatti molte tartarughe piccole non riescono a superare questo periodo e muoiono!...quello ti può costare dai 15 euro in sù... devi tenere conto che per il benessere della tua tarta i watt del termoriscaldatore devono essere uguali ai litri della vasca... quindi per ogni litro è un watt!...mi spiego meglio.. se la tua vasca è di 10 litri il termoriscaldatore deve avere 10 watt...<br>  <br>  <br>  [*] Per il cibo:<br>  <br>  devi sapere ke le tarte da piccole sono particolarmente carnivore poi in età adulta preferiranno le verdure... la cosa più importante dell'alimentazione di una tartaruga è la variazione... cioè devi fornirle alimenti diversi ricchi di calcio e vitamine.. come: *la lattuga ( che sia romana però perche ha piu vitamine di quelle normali) *la rucola, *il radicchio, *carote, *il fiore del tarassaco (dente di leone), il trifoglio... poi mangiano i pesci di acqua dolce , visto che in natura si alimentano particolarmente di questi (guppi, alborelle, acquadelle, trota ecc..) siccome sono pikkole puoi darle i pesci morti oppure vivi ma piccoli, ogni tanto puoi darle le lumache senza guscio, lombrichi... possono mangiare anche della frutta (mele, albiccoche )ma sempre ben lavata per eliminare ogni residuo di antiparassitari, o carne bianca come il pollo e il tacchino (massimo 2 volte al mese) ma deve essere bollito per eliminare il rischio della salmonella..! oppure puoi darle del gamberi freschi ma solo una volta al mese perche sono pesanti... insomma devi cercare di alimentare con quello ke le tarte possono trovare in natura... i gamberetti essicati te li sconsiglio perche sono carenti di vitamine.. le tartarughe piccole hanno bisogno di molte vitamine per una crescita salutare e uno sviluppo sano del carapace!...<br>  le devi alimentare due volte al giorno ... piano piano dovrai diminuire qst quantità quando saranno adulte fino ad arrivare a 3 o 4 volte alla settimana... (perche il loro metabolismo man mano che crescono diventa più lento) e ti consiglio di lasciare a disposizione alcuni ossi di seppia , visto che sono ricchi di calcio, importante per il metabolismo delle tartarughe e per la crescita del carapace.<br>  <br>  [*] Non Darle: carne rossa, cibo in scattola per cani, gatti ( troppi grassi )... pomodori e banane ( rallentano il loro metabolismo )...prezzemolo (troppo pesante)... pane, pasta, formaggio!!<br>  <br>  Siccome si devono abituare alla loro nuova casa è normale che cerchino sempre di uscire... e non preoccuparti se oggi non mangiano.. si devono ancora abituare!!... quindi stai tranquilla! =D<br>  <br>  ahhh dimenticavo... le tartarughe, specie in estate sporcano molto, se non vuoi cambiarle l'acqua tutti i giorni è meglio che tu compri un filtro preferibilmente esterno (puliscono meglio e non occupano spazio nella tartarughiera ma sono più costosi) intorno ai 40 euro! Cmq se vuoi quello interno il prezzo gira dai 12 ai 25 euro ma quello te lo sconsiglio perche sicuramente te ne occuperà di spazio nella tua tartarughiera!<br>  ... tieni conto che le tartarughe si stressano molto con i cambi!<br>  L'acqua deve essere sempre pulita per evitare malattie infettive quali la congiuntivite e l'infezione agli occhi..!<br>  <br>  [*] Errori piu' comuni, che possono portare le tartarughe alla morte<br>  <br>  1.

La posizione migliore per la vaschetta dovrebbe essere un luogo luminoso, ma non irradiato dal sole direttamente

Your usually cool cat suddenly crouches, half opens his mouth, draws back his lips, and bares his teeth in a terrifying expression. And then he expels his breath in a loud hiss. It's enough to deter anyone – or anything.<br>  <br>  But that's the whole point. And what could be more intimidating than sounding like one of the world's most fearsome animals – the snake. The sound your cat makes – as well as its grimace – resembles that of a snake right before it strikes. And the message is clear: This is a warning, and any further threatening behavior toward me is at your peril.<br>  <br>  When your cat hisses, it is a defensive act; in fact, it's an evolutionary strategy of deception based on mimicry, and occurs when one species of animal looks like or behaves like another one. Mimicry is fairly common in the animal kingdom.|`|3UQu2K4Aaa	It's a noise to warn you off, so they don't have to result in scratching you.

yPhCujOvaa	To reduce your dog's anxiety, you need to not reward your dog for being overly excited to see you.  So, when you come home, if your dog is wagging his tail so hard, his butt is wiggling too, ignore him until he is calm, give him a sit command and greet/pet him at that point to reward him for being calm.  Your teaching your dog to respect you but also that your not just going to shower him with praise and affection as soon as you come home and that you only reward a calm dog, so there is really no reason to be anxious when you are away.<br>  <br>  The other tip I have is that generally separation anxiety manifests in the first 30 minutes while you are away.  So, you should try to find something to occupy your dog's time for around 30 minutes.  My suggestion would be a kong toy.  I put a little peanut butter in there, then two crushed up milkbones and then some more peanut butter and leave it in the crate.  My dog loves it and will lick it to get to the treats.  Note that the kong toy is a special toy that is only given in the crate.  Any time my dog takes it out, I put it back in the crate.<br>  <br>  You should get a crate, not only for this, but to help house training.  Do not give your dog unsupervised time in the house.  Basically, if you are watching him, you can let him go anywhere.  If you can't watch him, put him in the crate with the kong.<br>  <br>  To help get my dog to like her crate more, I would show her a treat, then throw it into the crate and shut the door.  She would have a fit trying to get in.  At which point, I would make her do some obedience commands and her reward is to go into the crate and eat her treat.  As soon as she started toward the crate, I would say "crate."  Now, I can just say "crate" and she will go there.|`|xz4K7fuMaa	Crate training is always a good idea. Its a safe place for your puppy to be when you can't watch him.  As long as you don't leave the puppy in the crate for 2 long.  Never go running to the puppy when he cries for you.  He will then cry more knowing that you will come if he is crying.|`|MONmVNBZaa	You should do what you've been doing. Going out for short periods and returning. However, upon returning don't make a big fuss about it. Just come back and ignore the pup for a while and when he returns to a calm state then give him some attention.|`|49e200670f254de232e11a361988f371aa	for example, if you go to work, u probably have a routine. change your routine everry day a little bit.<br>  if that wnt work out then try to give him something that smells like u. <br>  i hope i helped.|`|GaL66jbQaa	Definately crate puppies are not trustworthy and if you leave him he WILL destroy things at this point in the game. but you were on the right track leaving and coming back. also have at least one durable food dispensing toy with him in the crate there are tons of toys on the market that you can fill with regular dry food and put just a couple of extra yummy treats in there too. when I first get a puppy I measure out their food for the day and put about half of it in toys so they don't get bored or excessively hungry while I'm gone a quarter of it I use as training rewards and the rest goes in a bowl at night. Other treats like liver or cheese or other highly motivating items should be no more than 5% of puppy's diet.  I like the tricky treats ball, the buster cube, busy buddy, Kong Stuff a ball. There's tons of options you just need to experiment .|`|Vzzc6mATaa	A cage/ Crate is Very useful for a number of reason's its not unknown for a pup to completely wreck a room when left alone pups have been killed when they bit electric cable eg such as from a lamp or TV it means it can not poo and wee all over the place if you get a cage get a big one even if it a small bread leave food and water and a old short that you been wearing so it will have your sent.he will soon understand that the cage is his safe place|`|yleKaqzaaa	My dog use to be this way. What I did was everytime I left don't make a big deal about you going. My dog loves bones, he will immediatly start chewing on it until it's finished so everytime I left I gave him a new bone, the bones that take a few hours to demolish. So when I was gone he was doing something he aboslutely loved.|`|zKyy1gE2aa	A stuffed animal that's a little bigger than him will help. Also, I have heard that putting a clock in the room that ticks helps puppies a lot, it soothes them, like the sound of their mothers heart beating.|`|Qiw9AFkaaa	crates are a definite yes...<br>  leave and comeback is a good way too...<br>  music to soothe when your gone is also good...<br>  toys to entertain him...<br>  don't always soothe him when he cries or he will continue to do this attention seeking behavior.  good luck|`|OCMSTxYfaa	Can't you just go and get him a friend? 2 dogs are better than 1
rrLHU6ehaa	You got it.  Plecos, like most catfish, are nocturnal, so you won't see him move much during the day.  It would actually prefer a hiding place of some kind, but if one isn't available will lay in the open.  <br>  You'd probably see him more active if you dimmed the lights, or get moon lights, and place some well-rinsed, canned, sliced green beans in the tank.  Something needs to be given to supplement his diet, and these are readily taken by most fish.|`|499ce2344d684feb00ec06bcf55edd71aa	That is a mistake most people make. Pleco's will not really clean the sides of your tank. They do however need to be fed algae chips. You should feed them at night because they are nocturnal. Sounds like he has just found a spot he likes to sleep in the daytime.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind that this fish will get quite large. The small variety gets to 6 inches long, where the most of the pleco's grow to 2ft long. These fish need lots of space to grow.|`|1D8tMCYIaa	Well, plecos are mainly algae eaters, but your tank might not have enough to sustain your fish. <br>  <br>  Buy some algae wafers and put a whole one in near your pleco and no matter what time of day, it's going to jump on it. Also, par-boiling zucchini or cucumbers will make your pleco and all your other fish very happy.|`|vVAwFgcJaa	What junie said is right. Pleco don't do much. Actually, they make mush more poop than anything else.
yY6Aj1xpaa	The answer is yes, of course.  You haven't cleaned too many stalls have you?|`|hWXCoyqOaa	yer most of the time but the wee smells worse lol

I'm surprised your male dogs are both OK with eachother...<br>  but us girls are just B*tches anyways...lol.<br>  <br>  but yea. its most likley dominance<br>  <br>  I hope that they will settle it out. there will always be some fighting but I hope it doesnt get too bad for you. If you cant fix it (then I hate to say it) you might consider adopting out one of them (are they all spayed/nuetered?)|`|rJ8TGFFnaa	first of all, that was a bad idea...im supised you didnt have problems before cuz sure males and females can get along but once a girl goes in heat then the males will start to fight...same with te females if they smell a boy then they too will fight...but you can always get a trianer....and nex time you want to get an aditional pet you should take ur dogs to meet the pet first to c if they will get along cuz just because you like the dog doesnt mean ur pets will!|`|667cPcfLaa	I am against dog fighting because I Have a pitbull and I think you just need to use them as pets,nothing else,  because I have learn that if you have  dog fighing then you are huring the dog and  you can seriously get charged . Dog fighting needs to be banned. No yet you are hurting the dog you are hurting yourself because you  chose to fight your dog .

You can get a dog trainer to help you but if theres no hope you may have to get arid of one.|`|ks2z4po8aa	Sorry to disagree with all the above, but I have 4 female and 2 male French Bulldogs and they ALL get along perfectly well... Only two or our females have been spayed (so far), but raising healthy, and well-adjusted, and socialized dogs does require proper training... None of my dogs are crated, there are no gates in my home, and the dogs all eat from their respective bowls, gnaw on their chew bones, and sleep in tandem on the bed... The puppies were all initially selected on the basis of their health, conformation, and TEMPERAMENT, then introduced to the rest of the pack  under supervision and following established guidelines... A person needs to be "in control" and possess a certain level of comfort in order to be able to raise multiple dogs... Hire a dog trainer and read books on the subject, understanding that dogs are instinctual animals that require discipline (as in basic obedience), exercise, food and water, and that you need to take charge and be the person that they all respect in that household... Once things escalate to the point of fighting, it's extremely difficult to get the dogs to co-habitate, so you probably will have to re-home one or two of the dogs if the female bulldog isn't subdued and taught to get along with all the other dogs in the household.|`|EHQqq5nTaa	you should never have gotten the female spaniel. it is okay when two MALE dogs are together, but two FEMALE dogs are together, all hell breaks loose. i dont know why this appears to be so, but it is with every female dogs.

AA11215640	I would try putting a mirror in the cage.  The bird doesn't feel alone, and would use it to play with as well.  This had worked my my cockatiel a few years back, and he stopped ripping the feathers off!|`|EJpiaCMQaa	I wouldn't recommend getting another cockatiel because the one you already have may start plucking on the new one.  Some things you can do to help are to rotate the toys in the cage every so often,  bathing the bird on a regular basis, and making sure the bird is eating a well-balanced diet (fruits, veggies, cuttlebone for calcium).  Make sure she's also getting enough out of cage time.  If none of that works, then I'd take the cockatiel to the vet.  Sometimes they put collars on the birds to prevent feather picking.  The vet can also rule out any illness or treat an illness if the bird has one.|`|vwC7klVVaa	It is never fair to keep a cockatiel on there own get her a friend . You need to make sure the cage is as big as you can afford . Do you let her out to fly as they need to be let out every day.|`|UhV82EaXaa	a mirror does help, but maybe spend more time with the bird outside the cage, or maybe bring another bird in, but feather plucking is a sure sign of boredom. u can buy a spray called bitter beak, its a bitter tasting liquid that deters them from chewing or plucking there feathers, and also keeps them in tip top condition! hope this helps!!|`|Xyj4nmFnaa	unfortunately feather plucking can become a hard habit to break you need to give her lots of attention and lots of free flying time maybe move the cage to give her a different view.|`|wEc3XzExaa	A mirror helps, and if you do get another one make sure it's female|`|dE8edvGIaa	I've had cockatiels for a few years now. I noticed that the most amount of cockatiels you can have in one cage is two. I once had three, but as it was two girls and a boy, one girl killed the other. <br>  Anyway, my female bird started picking feathers and she pooped a lot too. She started laying stress eggs as well. So, to keep her happy, we got her a male partner. Now they're both happy and my female is pregnant. <br>  So i'd say get another bir, your house will be more lively with their chitter chatter. <br>  Also, don't put a mirror, it annoyed my bird, you could try if you wish to.<br>  hope i helped. x

She will catch on that it is not acceptable.|`|lqt3wTQvaa	lol she's just trying to play with you...plus you probably move your feet during sleep..which interest her...try putting ur hand under the covers and moving it around, i bet she'll chase it and pounce|`|YWT5aHAlaa	It's not weird it's cute.|`|4qT0TfMZaa	She's a puppy, and that's how puppies beg for attention.  Give her a love first thing, then go about getting ready for your day.  She'll get over it as she grows older, and I guarantee you'll miss her playfulness.|`|B1OUPWxXaa	that's kind of strange. Maybe you should lift your feet up and say no everytime she does that, but she's just a puppy and she might grow out of it. Another thing you should do is on a weekend, let her play with your feet until she gets bored.I hope that helps!
MstjbpVJaa	Your birds should be coming into breeding condition shortly,one thing to help them do this is too feed them soaked sprouting seed ,soak some of their seed in warm water overnight,drian ,rinse place somewhere warm till it sprouts (2-3 days) then rinse and feed it to them A.S.A.P.You are feeding them correctly but this will give them that extra boost.<br>  <br>  You have been told incorrectly about putting saw dust in the nest box ,what you need is Peat slightly damp(2-3.inches.).Let them take their own material into the nest box,put some Willow ,Apple ,or pear tree twigs in their cage ,they will strip off the bark and take this into their nest.<br>  As you have seen they are already doing this.<br>  <br>  Lovebirds like to be in a quiet spot with little disturbance,they will go to breed when they are ready no one can force them into it.<br>  <br>  It will take from 2-3 days after mating when the first eggs are laid, and up to 6 could be laid.Do not disturb them at their first nesting till at least 10 days after you find your first egg.they are very nervous nester's and you could loose them(the eggs)if she leaves them<br>   ,<br>  They may not be fertile the first time round,but this often happens with the first clutch.<br>  <br>  Haveing bred various species and mutations I found this to be the way.<br>  Good luck.|`|7G0IyCltaa	How do you know you have a male and a female?  Masked lovebirds belong to the white eye-ring group, and they are not sexually dimorphic, nor does the female put nesting material in her feathers like peach-faced females.<br>  <br>  Since they have never laid any eggs, my guess is that you have two males.  Males will go in the nest box, so that's not a characteristic only of females.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  Just so you understand a little better... because you didn't say that you had your lovebirds sexed, two regulars who were trying to help you had to guess if you really knew the sex of your birds.  Far more often than not, when someone is having a breeding problem, it is a case of the pair not being a true pair.  So, please don't forget for the next time, when someone reads your entire question, thinks about and then executes an answer, that their answer can only be as good as the question.|`|pYF9KnNeaa	You say you have one each male and female.  But you didn't say how you know for sure.  Unless you have had DNA tests done, or unless one of them has laid an egg in the past, you do not know for sure.  You cannot go by how they interact with each other.  A same sex couple of birds who have been cage mates for a while can appear to be, and are, just as bonded as if they were opposite sex.  It's not unusual even, to see same sex couples engaging in what appears to be sexual displays.  Assuming you do for sure have one of each, it's not unusual for the male to not go into the nest box.  He has no need to if there are no eggs or chicks for him to help out with.  Again assuming there is one of each, there is no way to make any kind of prediction about mating and/or the laying of eggs.  They will have their own schedule or they may never have a clutch.  No one, not even an Avian vet can make that kind of prediction for you.  One thing I suggest is to get rid of the sawdust.  That can be dangerous, for several reasons.  Just provide regular nesting material and let them make what ever kind of nest they want.  It's great that you realize the possible problem of splay leg but I don't think a rubber mat is the best solution.  Make sure the adults have not done any munching on it.  I'd get rid of that because of the possible toxicity and replace it with just a few layers of an old sheet.  You want a safe material but it must be one that can't snag little toes and toenails.  Find an old sheet, wash it without using any kind of fabric softener at all and put a pad of it on the bottom of your nest box.  One old sheet will make a bunch so it won't be hard to remove it for washing and replace with fresh, should they soil it.  I hope this helps.  Goodl luck.
f0egZ7Sdaa	Just the simple fact that you've come to this point of even asking the question tells me that you do feel guilty, and that she would be better off in a different home, with a family that can spend more time with her.<br>  <br>  I wonder tho'... how much time does your b/f stay with her? You say that she's in a crate for 6 hours. At best, she should only be in her crate from when your b/f leaves for work until the time that you get home (4 hours max?).<br>  <br>  Also, when your b/f comes home at 11:pm, he could spend time with her then too.<br>  <br>  If you two truly want to keep this puppy, then you BOTH need to make a commitment to training her properly. Since you guys work split schedules, it shouldn't be too difficult.<br>  <br>  I would recommend that you get in to some training classes with her, and teach your b/f that you are learning in those classes so that you are both training her the same.|`|ba8dd4c6a9b532bef579aff3e8706fe7aa	First of all, see if the breeder will take her back.  Good breeders REQUIRE that you return the pup if you can't keep it for any reason.  Don't be embarrased, really, a GOOD breeder would rather have you return the pup to them.<br>  <br>  If the breeder will not take the pup back, try your local GSH rescue.  Because your dog is still pretty young, they should have no trouble placing her.  Giving them a donation would be a nice gesture of appreciation for their help, as rescues have high expenses (vets, boarding if they have too many dogs) and are run completely by volunteers.|`|b887929b2ebc558a3765f2523821bd14aa	What is a GSH?<br>  <br>  anyway,, if you bought the dog from a reputable breeder,, CALL THE BREEDER,, they will take the dog back and find a suitable home...|`|NgVJkXNTaa	Try taking her to a daycare in the day so she has some friends<br>  But take a day off and train her and see what happens<br>  or you could get a family or friedn to come and take her for walks in the day <br>  <br>  <br>  Hope i Helped!! |`|wuBIF9aPaa	have you tried a dog walker? or puppy day care? |`|020573c2b8f6f31da5d9ac91c3b09ee6aa	you're thinking of your dog. you do need to find her a more appropriate home.<br>  did you get her from a breeder? maybe you can return her to them. or a GSD rescue group.<br>  you could also post an ad at your vets office.<br>  <br>  **** i'm getting TONS of warning e mails re: craigslist and petfinder. it seems there are people that "adopt" dogs just to sell to pit fighting groups to use as bait dogs*|`|S9B8Fr4daa	If it going to better the dogs life, then no, it shouldn't be something you should regret later. Maybe later on dog the road, your life will calm down and be more suitable for a dog.  But if your life is truely how you say it is, then thats no fair life for a puppy, and she's most likely doing the biting becuase she hasn't been properly socialized..And if you are going to do craigslist..be careful, as you dont know where your pup will be going, do some type of screening of potential takers, and notify them you'll be doing routine checkups to make sure pup is being well cared for.|`|ruSQOyjyaa	<br>      Do you really not have time for her, or is it just to hard for you?<br>  Puppies take a lot of time and patients. They are just like kids, you need to play ,teach them and love them. It's not fair to the pup if she isn't getting all the attention she needs. Just because you want to keep her doesn't mean you should, especially when you know someone else will take her fast.|`|xovipp19aa	You will. Once shes potty trained she will be free to do as shel pleases around the house, and it wont phase her.

In my opinion you should keep her |`|oChOlCqYaa	I have adopted both a puppy and an adult dog. Let me tell you, puppyhood is tough! I know a lot of people go through a "what was I thinking?!" stage when they have a puppy. They make you crazy. I always joke that God made puppies cute so you don't kill them. <br>  <br>  Six hours is really not so bad to spend in a crate. If you can, try to get up a little earlier and take her for a jog or long walk before work. Give her more exercise in general. A tired puppy is a good puppy. <br>  <br>  All puppies play bite. It is important to react the right way so they learn bite inhibition. What I did with my dog (a rottie mix) is that I would let him take my hand in his mouth in play, but if he bit too hard I'd say ouch or make a yelping sound, and then either get up or turn away and ignore him until he settled down. <br>  <br>  Once she is fully potty trained and through the chewing stage (maybe a year or so) you may be able to phase out the crate. That way she could have more freedom while you're gone. In the meantime, give her things like a kong stuffed with frozen moist dog food, cream cheese, peanut butter, and dog treats to keep her occupied for some of the time that she's in the crate. <br>  <br>  It does get easier. You will see. I think if you give her away you will regret it. |`|qW9vE4CDaa	Hi,Coming from a person that loves animals more than life itself i say keep your puppy.There are already tons of people in this world that have given up on animals...Please don't be one of them.With the potty training issue wait until a weekend or when you have a good amount of time on your hands to tackle these issues.You should take care of potty training and biting right away because when they are younger they can be taught easier and it will stick with them throughout their lives.If she tends to have accidents once in awhile well hey that can happen(and most likely will),Wait until she has to go to the bathroom and if she goes on the floor catch her in the act and well use a stronger,angry voice when telling her no.If you over react when you catch an animal doing something bad it will be scared to do it the next time for fear that you are watching and will yell at them again, When she comes to you and tells you/whines that she has to go to the bathroom, let her outside and give much praise even a treat or two that way she'll understand she did something good plus,she'll like the treats which will result in going to the bathroom outside instead of on your floor.About the biting whenever she bites you whether it's playfully or not it needs to be stopped right away because in the future when she is bigger she will bite harder and if she hurts you and she sees this she will not understand because she has always been allowed to bite from the start.Also if she bites another person someday and causes harm even if it's "just playing" there could some serious issues.So when she bites 1) Hold her mouth shut (lightly don't hurt her),look straight into her eyes in a stern way,and in a stern voice tell her no biting.Eventually she'll get the idea.Or 2) You could pop her in the nose and tell her no biting.That has worked with my 8 year old German shepherd whenever she begs I popped her in the nose and now she's not even in the same room when i am eating.I hope my advice has helped you.When you adopted your puppy you took on responsibility for it and just because it has a few issues shouldn't mean that you should give it up.And once she is potty trained you will be able to let her out of the cage while you are gone which in turn will make much more happier, because honestly who would like being locked in a cage with not much space for more than 6 hours?It seems that you Truly love her,So don't give up I'm sure if it was a human baby you wouldn't give it up just because it had a few problems.Animals to me, are just like humans she can learn,So teach her.That will make life for you and your BF a lot easier.<br>  I hope everything works out and that you don't make a horrible mistake by giving away something that can,will,and probably already does love you so much for taking time,money,and energy to give it a chance at a great life.Let her know that she's loved<br>     Sincerely,Michaela|`|s76aC4G8aa	Welcome to the puppy stage, IT SUCKS.  The puppy stage is hard, really really really hard and tiring.  It's truly like having a baby.  I don't think ANYONE is really ready for a puppy.  So look.  You didn't say how old the puppy is.  It only lasts for the first 7-8 months and they do get easier believe me.<br>  <br>  Don't put her in a crate all night long, since she's in it during the day then let her have a little freedom at night.  If your boyfriend doesn't work till 2 then he should have her out of the crate during the day so she's only in it from 2-5.  when you come home let her outside to potty and go for a short walk, bring her home, feed her play with her and then off to bed around 9 pm.  It will get easier, when they are housebroken and not as much work all you have to do is just make sure she get's out for exercise each night.<br>  <br>  My dog is so easy to care for now she's fully grown, I also work 8 hours a day, but I take her to day care two days a week (that helps a lot) look into that option, a couple of days a week where you don't have to worry about her will be good for her and your piece of mind.  On the other days she stays in the house all day, I come home I change clothes take her to the dog park for at least 2 hours, I socialize with people and have a great time, other nights I do agility class for an hour after work.<br>  <br>  It's tiring, there are days I don't want to go to the dog park for 2 hours but I do it because it's a promise I made the day I chose to adopt her I made a lifetime committment to care for this dog for the rest of her life, not until I grew bored or things got too hard, NO FOR THE REST OF HER LIFE.  I changed my schedule to accommodate my dogs wants and needs, I joined agility because I thought it would be something she'd enjoy, and she does and she's good at it.  I smoke, I have bad feet and have trouble walking a lot but I still run around that agility course and suffer because I'm doing it for my dog.<br>  <br>  When you buy a dog you must sacrifice a part of your life.  If you are not willing to do that, then the best thing for the dog would be to rehome her.<br>  <br>  Good luck, no force on earth could make me part with my Graycie Lou, she's my reason for getting up in the morning and the love of my life.|`|wWDAWmBdaa	It takes a big person to admit they have made a mistake. Here's hoping others will learn from it.<br>  <br>  It maybe possible for you to keep her without the long crate hours. You work 9-5, but your B/F wors 2-11. How come the dog can;t be out with him until you go to work? If he gets up just before you leave for work then crates the dog right before he leaves then unless he has a long distance to travel the dog should be crated no more than about 4 hours. If he gives the dog a real good run shortly before he leaves the dog will no doubt sleep most if not all of that time anyway. When you get home let the dog out and take it for a short walk. Have dinner then take it for a good walk in the evening. Night time he can let the dog out to pee when he gets home if you are already in bed. <br>  <br>  I would try this before you let go of the dog.<br>  <br>  If it's not working out, then you need to check the contract you have with the breeder. A good breeder will always insist the dog is returned to them no matter what the age should you no longer be able to keep it. If the breeder does not have this stipulation call him anyway. He still may take the dog back.<br>  <br>  If the breeder says no is there a family meber or friend that can give her a good home.<br>  <br>   If not try a breed shelter or a no kill shelter as a last resort. They are much more experienced at finding the right home for the dog than you are. Of course a nice donation to offset their costs would be a very nice move on your part.<br>  <br>  Do not put the dog on Craigslist or any other newspaper ad. People will say the things you want to hear to get the dog, but you won't know they are genuine. At least a shelter or rescue is beter qualified at knowing the right people for each dog. Of course sometimes mistakes are made there too, but much less likely with an open ad in a newspaper etc.<br>  <br>  This can be worked out, but it will take more effort on your part and your boyfriends part. It seems as if you genuinly feel for the dog so surely it's worth a try?|`|6e74de3b701ebf0a5c69ac299e2b1136aa	This is the problem most poeple that have not done the research before getting a dog find out. I am not bashing you just giving the hard truth of the matter. A dog is a life long comettment. Much like deciding to have a child. If you can not take care of the dog DO NOT put it on craigslist. You have no idea what kind os people will respond to the add. Call a GSH rescue and keep the dog until they can find a good foster home or place the dog in a good home. This would be the best thing you could do for your dog. If you decide you want to keep the dog then you need to make a committment to that dog.<br>  <br>  I work 9 - 5 and My husband works 12 hour day smost of the time (general contractor) We have 2 Akitas, 2 cats and fish. When I come home I spend the first hour playing with the dogs and giving them the attention that they need. On weekends we are up at 8 in the morning and take the dogs to the beach. This is our responsiblity to having the dogs. I also find time to cook for them. Yes I do cook for my dogs. <br>  <br>  If is your chose but I feel a rescue would be much safer then craigslist. And I also would not try and sell the dog. If you really care for it then a resuce would be the best thing you could do.<br>  <br>  Several thing you could do<br>  <br>  1.

Our lab was housebroken in less than two weeks.  Our shepard (RIP) took two months.  Our chihuahua crossbreeds took several months and one still has the occasional accident in the house<br>  <br>  You need to be consistent.  It is not cruel to keep her crated during the day when she cannot be supervised.  When you let her out of the crate take her outside on leash immediately.  Walk her to the same spot every time and when she goes praise her, and have some play time with her either outside on leash or in a fenced yard or inside off leash.  Put her back in her crate when playtime is over.  While you are home you should take her out every couple of hours  It is important to try and establish a schedule; feed her at the same time every day and she should eliminate at the same time every day.  If your boyfriend lives with you and he's home between 9 and 2, is he able and willing to take her out to the bathroom and give her 15-20 minutes of play time say at 11:30 or 12:00?  Do you have a reliable neighbor maybe a senior citizen of high school student that is home in the early afternoon (around 2:30) who would take her out for you as a favor, for a few bucks a week, or in trade for something else like help with yard work or something along those lines?  Once she is older, she should be able to hold it for the whole time you're gone and again overnight (without being crated) as long as you take her out regularly in between and feed her on schedule.<br>  <br>  A trick that I've seen or "It's Me or the Dog": put ice cubes in her water bowl instead of water that way she can't drink it all right away and fill her bladder up too quickly.  She can lap up the water as the ice melts.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't worry to much about the play biting, most puppies do it and out grow it.  When she does it, let her know that it is not okay with a stern "ouch" and "no biting".  If she was doing this with litter mates or mother dog they would correct her with a yelp and/or a nip back.<br>  |`|bnnkRe4baa	Your doing the right thing by looking for help. Finding her a good home is best if you don't have time for her. If you rally want a pet that doesn't need much looking after get a cat. Your local animal shelter will have older cats (not a kitten) and they will probably be fixed and de-clawed. You will feel better because you wont have to spend alot of time with a cat and they are lovable. But before you get a new animal Think about it. Give yourself time to do some research. |`|mL3Jhj5Waa	There is nothing long with crating her for 8-10 hrs per.  Just make sure you play with her when you get home.  Also, start obedience training.  Mental work and stimulus can be just as tiring as physical exercise.  Trust me- crating is not bad, not even for a high energy dog.  The important thing is play ball or something active with her for 15-20 min as soon as you get home.  A couple of hours later work on obedience for 15 mins then play again.  I work 9 hr days and have 3 dogs in the house.  One of them is a Schutzhund Dobe I trained since 9wks.  They will be fine.  You just have to dedicate a total of about 1 hr per day with her and make sure she has a yard she can play in when you are home.  
AA12398420	Who else lives there? Someone or something has caused this cat some trauma. Maybe someone broke into the house. Check under the loveseat to see what the cat is looking at.|`|hIaBgCrgaa	Maybe she saw a ghost or something, ive heard cats can see spirits. That is why the Egyptians thought they were special. Or it could have been because they keep the mice away. DOH!|`|msQqxMIbaa	LOL...that's funny.  You are a scaredy cat because you are afraid of your cat!|`|25660b99958e6df83f2c651134b3891faa	no, but i will bet it is still under the loveseat.<br>  <br>  if you live in a rural area, you should have a shotgun in the house.<br>  <br>  makes a mess, wont be much left of the love seat, but it will take care of the problem.<br>  <br>  i doubt it is a person, cats dont usually care about burglars.<br>  <br>  could also be the kitten scared it. i had  mice in my attic once, so i left the door open so the cats could deal with it. <br>  one cat came flying downstairs and never went near the attic again. i always assumed another cat jumped him from behind and he thought a 10Lb. mouse got him.|`|6be65543422b4937c27d1761a2ed50a0aa	You will probably find that a possum or raccoon got into your house and frightened your cat........maybe even attacked it.  Could even be a snake, since you live in a rural area..........<br>  <br>  Have your boyfriend put on a heavy coat and gloves to remove your cat from the room, before looking under the loveseat.  By now, whatever it is has probably moved, but......he'll need his arms protected if there's an animal under there.....and to keep the cat from scratching him while being removed.  Also, be sure that your boyfriend has a pole or something else that he can "shoo" the animal out with.<br>  <br>  Hope it all works out, so you AND YOUR CAT can relax!!<br>  Good luck.|`|v6t4Ylddaa	don't use rat pioson or a glue trap it problly just got scared take it off the dresser and  put it in a cat carrier and take it to the vet to get checked um i sugest keeping the cat in a carrier and foreget when i said dont put  glue traps and poison do put it down just keep your cat in a carrier it will be safer in the carrier and keep food and water in the carrier put the carrier on your dresser so it will feel safe o and i also sugest spraying inside and out bug spray and every thing to keep rodents away hope i helped|`|LWGmJifOaa	I don't think that you have anything to worry about. My cat has done things like that all of the time. Once, i came home and my cat went running down the stairs with her tail and fur puffed up. It could have been th other cat, or it could have been something else.|`|QOHkv2y3aa	Okay that's kind of creepy. Not sure what could be scaring your cat!<br>  <br>  My cat gets huge dilated pupils when he's crazy and playful, so that's normal. But the rest sounds weird. I'd let your boyfriend check under the love seat for you. :)|`|OkpbDYrUaa	You got freaked out by ur own cat and left the house because of a CAT?ur own cat|`|cqBk9jAHaa	Sounds like your cat is "seeing" something. Do you believe in spirits?<br>  |`|w7YzK9Wfaa	He is probably playing. Did you give him catnip?|`|tzZtYcy2aa	It could be something outside the house that the cat heard.  Cats have keen hearing and can hear things we can't.  Last week one evening my cat stopped in the middle of his bath and stared bug-eyed in the direction of the front door.  After about a minute, I tried to distract him, but he did not flinch. He sat in the awkward mid-bath position not moving even a whisker, and I became concerned about what he might be *staring* at.  So, I figured I better investigate.  <br>  <br>  I went to the door and opened it and there was a person standing there, outside.  It was a friend of mine, just standing there in the dark on the steps outside.  She had just gotten to the door and had not had a chance to ring the bell before I opened the door, so apparently my cat heard her long before she arrived at the door.  <br>  <br>  Likely your cat heard something and is freaked out a little over it.  But it does not necessarily mean it is something inside the house.  Nor does it mean it is a person, probably an animal.<br>  <br>  
GaL66jbQaa	They might be going through the adolescent stage and testing to see if the rules are still the same go back to square one with crate training|`|NAGiNKFWaa	Well I would rule out something medical first, like bladder, kidney, urinary, infection, or incontinence.  Puppies are not fully potty trained until 1-year-old, so it may be that you let your guard down too early.  Rule out something medical and then start potty training back at the beginning.  I use a crate* to potty train with, but only for potty training and then I break it down and store it.  I put blankets and a small food and water dish in the crate.  Dogs don't potty where they eat and sleep.  When they are first little, I only expect them to hold their potty for 4 hours, and then 6 hours, then 8 hours and so on.  So when they are first little, I set a timer or alarm clock to wake myself up at night to take them *out.  I only allow my puppy in the bedroom* or the living room, only one room at a time.  They have to graduate to more space.  If I allow them to have full run of the house, it will overwhelm them.  I take them out the same door each time.  I tie a dinner bell to the door handle.  Do not use a jingle bell as they could get their toe caught in it.  So when they are little, I ring the bell for them, and then open the door to go *outside to potty.  When they get bigger, I take their paw and whack the bell and open the door to go potty.  Eventually getting to the place where the puppy will ring the bell and let me know when they need to go potty.  Dogs want to please you, so it is your job to let them know what behaviors please you and what doesn't.  So when my puppy goes potty, I give her a treat*, and clap, and make a fuss and praise her.  So she learns that going potty outside makes me happy.  If she has an accident, make a disgust sound like “tsst” and take her out right away.  I never yell* or spank* my puppies.  Take them out when they first wake up, after they eat or drink, before nap, finish romping, when their activities change, or when they are sniffing around. Some puppies go pee right away, but may not go poop until 10 minutes later, so wait for the poop..  I have a little play time here, because sometimes I think they are done, and they are not.  Puppies train at their own pace.  While I may have a puppy that hasn't had an accident in several weeks, I don't let my guard down.  I don't expect my puppies to be "fully potty trained" until one-year-old.  If they have a setback, shake it off, and start over.  I only have my puppies in the crate when I am not watching them.  When I am sleeping, cooking, ironing, doing chores, basically when I am not watching her.  All other times, she is out of the crate practicing being a "big girl."  This is the time I train her how to behave in the house.  So we are practicing "no barking", 'no biting", "no jumping", and "don't eat the furniture."  I also have to practice "playing inside" so she doesn't knock over things.  You must keep the puppy in sight when they are little because they don’t know the difference between newspaper and carpet, and you don’t want them sneaking off and getting into trouble.   Some puppies can sleep through the night around 3-months-old, but their bladder is grown around 6-months-old. <br>    <br>  REVISIONS:  <br>  *I use a CRATE to train with.  It is the method I prefer, compared to other methods I have tried.  I noticed that if they are in the crate, while I am doing chores, they are o.k., because the crate allows them to see me and be re-assured.  The crate can also be a comfort when stored in the basement for dogs who live in areas where thunderstorms and tornados are an issue. .  However, use the method that works best for you.....a laundry basket, a cardboard box, a woof-woof house, x-pen, child gates, whatever works for you. <br>  *OUTSIDE, pee pad, litter box, whichever method you are using.   When the puppy is first little, keep the pee pad, litter box near the food and water dish, so the puppy can eat and drink, and then go potty.  You can move it away as they get older.  The pee pad has a scent that smells and initiates potty.  Sometimes a pee pad makes a sound that scares some puppies, so you might want to use a litter box if that happens.  The pee pad allows a puppy to walk around, but a litter box keeps the puppy in one place. <br>  *BEDROOMS, I use the bedroom and living room for training, because it works for me.  Choose rooms that work for you, but watch for rooms that are damp, or drafty.  While my puppies sleep in the bedroom during training, once they are trained, I let them sleep where they want to.  They don't have to sleep in the bedroom forever. <br>  *TREATS.  While I use treats for training, you don't have to.  I like Charlee Bears for training (a little cracker for a little mouth,) I use them for training, but once they are trained, I cut back on them.  <br>  *SOME PUPPIES will go potty in the same spot each time.  Some puppies have to be told to go potty.  A command like "go out" for pee, or "go finish" for poop, might work for you, keep saying “go finish” until the puppy poops.  This is a good thing to train if you travel with your dogs.  By using commands, the puppy won't get confused when you are visiting someone, on vacation with you, or when you get to a new home.  The command will tell them what you want them to do in an unfamiliar place.  You might also want to use a leash method, so the puppy doesn’t sneak off, or for strange places. <br>  *YELLING.  It is not a good idea to "yell" or "spank" your puppy and then take them outside when they have an accident.  They may get confused and think that going outside is punishment.  While you want to correct them, if you are extreme, they may not want to go outside again.  Shake it off, and resume your schedule.  You have to keep it real.  Puppies train at their own pace, but a puppy can only hold their potty for a few hours.  A guide would be 1 hour for each month of age, plus 1 hour, so a three-month-old puppy should only be expected to hold their potty for 4 hours at most.     <br>  SOURCE:  These tips, tricks, and ideas were contributed from many brilliant minds.

tRFKA3e3aa	Purtroppo non c'è soluzione, ma comunque sterilizzarla è una cosa che la aiuterà, nel senso che o la fa accoppiare e trova anche una sistemazione per i micetti, o la sterilizza per evitarle di soffrire, perchè per lei è una sofferenza, e dato che va in calore molto spesso durante l'arco di un anno, è meglio sterilizzarla, comunque non ti preoccupare perchè non sentirà dolore o perlomeno solo al risveglio dall'ananestesia, naturalmente ne sentirà un pò e sarà un pò debole. La mia gatta è sterilizzata e ti assicuro che l'unico fastidio che aveva era quella specie di imbuto che le mettono al collo per evitare che si lecchi i punti, ma per il resto stava benissimo!!! Sicuramente se vive in appartamento dopo la sterilizzazione ingrasserà un pò, ma manterrà l'affetto materno comunque!!! La mia gatta ha un pupazzetto che da sempre lo mette nella ciotola dell'acqua e dei croccantini... insomma si comporta come una mamma!!!! ciao ciao e non ti preoccupare non è pericoloso x la micia, anzi le eviterà questa sofferenza!!! ciao|`|1ba08b79ce23e5d8f392411b5c0df75eaa	Non esistono rimedi alternativi.|`|GQxhbQBoaa	Vedrai che dopo una settimana di pianti della gatta cambierà idea!|`|LShRo6KGaa	Ci sono degli inibitori del calore ma io li sconsiglierei vivamente visto che possono portare serie complicazioni alla gatta. Anche il calore non le fa assolutamente bene. La sterilizzazione eviterebbe di far correre il rischio di tumori mammari o all'utero. Cisti ovariche o quant'altro!|`|Wni2A1nPaa	L'unica alternativa è la reclusione, e la sopportazione dei miagolii strazianti.... Oltretutto molte gatte vanno perennemente in calore, non ad intervalli regolari, e questo credo porti dei gravi scompensi alla micia. Inoltre, se appena ne troverà l'occasione, tenderà a filarsela per andare a "soddisfare" gli istinti, col rischio di ritrovarsi con 5/6 nuovi randagini per le strade!<br>  Dì al tuo amico che non volerla operare è pura crudeltà, non ha niente a che fare con l'amore per gli animali!|`|a07786928cbf04adf65db5f28b26859aaa	La cosa migliore  che il tuo amico può fare e' di fare sterilizzare la gattina. Se non la sterilizza potrebbe sviluppare il cancro alle ovaie o all'utero. Anche  i medicinali per calmarla sono cancerogeni. Se il tuo amico vuole bene la gattina deve sterilizzarla.

L'unica alternativa è una sterilizzazione diversa dall'isterectomia e, per darti un'immagine esaustiva, è molto simile all'intervento per legare le tube alle donne. Lo stesso problema si pone con il maschio, che per acclamare la sua virilità spruzza urina per casa. <br>  Legare le tube o effettuare una vasectomia al maschio risolve solo il problema della riproduzione, ma non elimina l'istinto. Esistono anticoncezionali per animali, ma non ti consiglio di usarli.<br>  Fai presente al tuo compagno che gli animali non hanno memoria sessuale come gli uomini. Per loro l'accoppiamento è un atto dovuto per garantire la prosecuzione della specie e, una volta sterilizzati, perdono questo istinto, ma non modificano inalcun modo il loro carattere: semplicemente non sviluppano più gli ormoni determinanti lo stato di calore o la produzione di testosterone.<br>  <br>  Il discorso più importante è un altro, però: per la gatta il soddifacimento sessuale perviene al momento dell'eiaculazione del maschio. Lasciare la gatta ai suoi calori senza garantirle costante soddifazione, significa permettere lo sviluppo di tumori che possono gravemente compromettere lo stato di salute dell'animale. La sterilizzazione è anche e soprattutto un modo per salvaguardare la salute del gatto e cosentire così una vita più lunga ed uno stato di salute migliore.<br>  <br>  Se poi ritenete che siano atti contro natura e non vi sentite di attuare alcun rimedio medico, ricordatevi la sofferenza che patirà la gatta a non essere soddisfatta durante i calori. Anche quella è crudeltà.|`|GVXbWuOaaa	ciau!!! dì al tua amico ke nn ha molte alternative... <br>  1) o la sterilizzi<br>  2) o la droghi (in questo caso è crudeltà verso gli animali...)<br>  anke io ho un gatto, castrato, ma aglssimo... all'inizio ero contraria, xò ha cominciato a distruggere i mobili e... bé, forza e coraggio: la micia nn se ne accorgerà neanke... sarà come prima...|`|UlZ5E5gPaa	Ci sono delle medicine che impediscono loro di andare in calore,ma a lungo andare provocano gravissimi danni alla salute,sono solo da usare come rimedi temporanei...o la fai accoppiare o la fai sterilizzare...e aggiungerei che a queste cose bisogna pensarci prima,è logico che prima o poi si arrivi a questa decisione!!!Una gatta non sterilizzata che non si accoppia regolarmente può sviluppare tumori all'apparato riproduttivo,oltretutto...|`|kIzcFEisaa	la sterilizzazione è la cosa migliore.. le gocce per calmarla sono nocive, a lungo andare faranno ammalare il gatto!!!|`|RfGLrtw4aa	non ci sono alternative..|`|rfdaRKfTaa	Per quanto ne sappia esistono delle gocce calmanti per le gatte in calore ma alcuni doc dicono che faccia male alle gatte a lungo andare e pertanto preferiscono la sterilizzazione... meglio operare un gatto/a quando ancora non ha manifestato istinti sessuali altrimenti poi si rattrista... consultate comunque un doc...|`|xXKypMWnaa	io sapevo ke esistevano delle pillole che nn le fanno andare in calore per un determinato periodo di tempo ma nn ne sono certa... digli di portarla dal veterinario e di sentire(io cmq la mia nn la ho sterilizzata ha 2 anni e nn mi è ancora rimasta incita perchè quando va in calore la rinchiudo)|`|z3wikzwxaa	anche io ero contrario ma il mio veterinario ha detto che era meglio farlo senò può venirle un tumore.

9GFlD3T8aa	When you have a puppy, there is no time for yourself.  Especially when your working ALL day!!!  They should be let out more often then what you are doing. They are puppies, they don't know how to  hold their baldder YET...  And besides, you really should be giving im more attention, WAY more attention as a puppy... I think the first 1-2 weeks, people should be home with the pup and giving them constant love and training.  Its what they need..  Do you have any local daycares in your area???  Try that 2-3 times a week if you can't take the time off of work.  They really need way more attention than this. Lack of attention can also result in behavioral problems when they are out of the crate or even in it. Chewing things, going to the bathroom everywhere things like that...|`|9XrGIirVaa	Unless you have the time to spend with and take care of your pet, you shouldn't have one....How would you like it?  Give the dog to someone who can care for him and get yourself a goldfish.|`|FrwxgBHtaa	You do need to provide the pup with more attention and training. If you are not able to spend more time with the pup, a local dog walker can be hired to come sit with pup or take pup for walks and are cheaper, better than daycare. There are things you can do. First, you have inadvertantly taught pup that the crate is punishment. He associates being in there and you leaving. Make it a treat to be in there by leaving the door open so he can go in anytime he wants. Place toys/treats in there when you catch him doing something good like sit or stay. Make sure pup has toys. Kong toys are rubber toys that you fill with treats and pup has to work to get them out. Get some chew toys from Petco/petsmart called "Bully sticks" these will occupy pup for hours. Potty training takes a long time and is needed for him to stop going in the crate. There are many ways to teach pup this. Start by taking pup outside BEFORE he has to go and WAIT until he does go, catch him in the act and praise him say "GOOD BOY!" or give pup a treat. If he goes inside, do not yell at pup, or punish pup. Pups attention span is about 2 seconds and will not understand. He will think you are punishing him for going potty, pup needs to understand potty outside first. I also would pick up poop when it was inside, take it and put it in the backyard and take the pup out, make him smell it and say"GOOD BOY" like he had actually went outside. Be patient, my pup was 6 months old before he got it. There are also puppy diapers and potty pads you can buy at pet stores. Get on line and search for pup training books. Get on dogster.com forums and ask questions, there are alot of great posts here by experienced pup owners. On TV, watch programs called "the Dog whisperer' on national geographic channel and on animal planet, "Good dog U" and "Barking mad". Be patient.|`|RKQbTKgeaa	A Frenchie needs company and craves attention.

The crate you have for the pup may be too big, giving him enough room to do his business on one end and sleep at the other. You should not leave water down all day or at night when you are sleeping. Get him on a routine of feeding, watering and bathroom the same time every day and night. Feed him 3 times a day, but leave the food and water down for 20-30 minutes and then pick it up. He will learn to eat and drink quickly so you can get him outside immediately after. Don't leave food or water down all day because you will never get him on a normal bathroom schedule. I have a 6.5 month old bulldog and I went through the same thing as you. He will change with age. All pups are annoying at times.|`|ks2z4po8aa	A French Bulldog is NOT the ideal pet for you... Or, rather, you're not the ideal French Bulldog owner... Placed in the non-working category, the sole purpose of the Frenchie is to be a "companion dog", making them the preferred pet of active retirees, entrepreneurs that can take their dog to the office / store / studio, or people that work from home... And now that your dog has actually soiled in his crate, you have set him up to fail at house-breaking in a crate and it'll be extremely difficult to potty-train him effectively and break him of this habit, because it could potentially get worse and lead to copraphagia (ingesting feces) if you don't devise a proper schedule and walk your dog more frequently... The best advice is to read some proper training manuals, or, better yet, hire a dog trainer that works with you and your dog, as well as hiring a dog walker that comes at least 2 times per day since you work such long hours... As for your sleep schedule, 9:30 PM to 6 AM is a VERY long time for a young pup to withold iteself... Set your alarm clock for some time between 2 and 3 AM and run your dog outdoors for a bit of relief. The puppy will eventually be able to withold itself through the night for 6 to 8 hours, but it'll take several more weeks of building his withholding stamina. Good luck.
xbmxVmxzaa	Le zampette sono MOLTO diverse................<br>  quella di mare ha una specie di pinne<br>  quella di terra ha delle zampette con delle belle unghie:|`|3FPmiVRIaa	beh te ne accorgi subito prendendola in braccio, se è di terra ti sporchi!|`|PgLKTUjKaa	dalle zampe....qll d terra sn + grosse e anno le zampe + robuste e cn le unghie cm qll dei cani, gatti ecc....qll marine invece hanno zampe simili a pinne...znke se qll d'appartamento ce le hanno le unghie<br>  <br>  <br>  una spiegazione + approfondita:<br>  La tartaruga verde, la tartaruga caretta, la tartaruga dal dorso verde-oliva e la tartaruga embricata sono veramente abitatrici delle acque salse e, come le Dermochelidi, vengono a riva solo per deporre le uova. E' interessante, tuttavia, notare che la tartaruga verde può venire a riposare sulle rive delle isole disabitate e solitarie, come fanno le tartarughe di acqua dolce sulle sponde dei fiumi. Questi animali hanno una vera corazza, nella quale le placche cornee e quelle ossee sottostanti corrispondono a quelle delle altre tartarughe. Tutti hanno linea idrodinamica (per quanto possa averla una tartaruga!) e nuotano con le potenti palette anteriori. Hanno testa troppo grossa per poterla ritirare sotto il carapace, ma le vertebre del collo dimostrano che questi rettili appartengono al tipo delle tartarughe che ripiegano il collo nel piano verticale.<br>  <br>  <br>  Tartaruga verde<br>  immagine intera <br>  La testa di un esemplare adulto di tartaruga verde<br>  immagine intera <br>  <br>  <br>  La tartaruga verde (Chelonia mydas) è la più nota delle tartarughe marine, e per centinaia di anni è stata considerata un cibo prelibato.Al giorno d'oggi vive specialmente nelle acque tropicali, e le popolazioni del Pacifico e dell'Atlantico sono considerate come razze distinte. Per quanto depongano parecchie uova e di conseguenza si abbia un numero considerevole di neonati, le popolazioni sono in continua e rapida diminuzione, persino nelle lontane isole Galapagos. La femmina, dirigendosi verso terra per trovare un posto ove collocare le uova oltre il limite della marea, lascia dietro a sé una traccia come quella di un piccolo trattore a cingoli. Perciò, camminando lungo la spiaggia, è facile individuare la posizione dei nidi. Le uova deposte su brevi spiagge chiuse tra pareti di lava o sulle spiagge di piccole isole poco lontane dalla costa, sviluppandosi, contribuiscono alla conservazione delle popolazioni. Ogni femmina depone più di 200 uova e non c'è da meravigliarsi se sono considerate un ottimo cibo.<br>  In verità i Nordamericani e gli Europei non sono di questa opinione perché, pur non essendoci nulla da eccepire quanto a sapore, l'albume o "bianco" non si rapprende con la cottura, ma resta chiaro e gelatinoso, e noi non siamo abituati a mangiare uova con l'albume in apparenza ancora crudo e il tuorlo rappreso. La quantità di uova raccolte sulle isole al largo delle coste tropicali raggiunge cifre astronomiche. Nelle relazioni concernenti l'industria delle uova di tartaruga nelle isolette di Talang-Talang, al largo dell'isola di Borneo verso nord-ovest, si trova la descrizione di tutto il processo della deposizione delle uova e dell'accoppiamento. Edward Banks così ne riferisce sul Sarawak Museum Journal del 1937: "Fatta eccezione per una o due visite annuali delle tartarughe embricate, ricercatissime per le squame della corazza, la sola specie che frequenta le isole è la tartaruga verde o commestibile ed è uno spettacolo avvincente, in una notte di luna durante l'alta marea, vedere una ventina di questi mostri del peso di centottanta chili emergere dal mare, neri e lucenti come enormi sanguisughe o lumache, trascinandosi lentamente sulla spiaggia prima di deporre le uova nella sabbia, oltre il limite dell'alta marea".<br>  <br>  Sia a causa degli arti modificati per la vita marina, sia per l'enorme peso, la femmina della tartaruga verde incontra grandi difficoltà a muoversi sulla spiaggia. Puntellando nella sabbia le pinne anteriori e posteriori, si spinge e avanza per pochi passi, poi si arresta ed emette quello che si potrebbe forse qualificare un tremendo sospiro. La penosa respirazione è dovuta a due fattori: primo, il grande sforzo richiesto per trascinare le sue centinaia di libbre contro l'attrito della sabbia; secondo, il semplice sforzo indispensabile per sollevare il suo pesante corpo affinché i polmoni possano dilatarsi per l'inspirazione dell'aria. Difatti, la fatica necessaria per la normale respirazione è tale che le tartarughe verdi tenute in cattività fuori dall'acqua muoiono soffocate se non stanno rovesciate sul dorso.<br>  <br>  Quando l'animale ha sorpassato il limite dell'alta marea, scava una fossetta poco profonda buttando via la sabbia con gli arti anteriori e posteriori. Poi comincia a lavorare seriamente per lo scavo del nido. Adoperando alternativamente gli arti posteriori a guisa di badile, scava una buca a forma di bottiglia, profonda circa 45 centimetri. Terminata la deposizione delle 100 e più uova, il nido è facilmente riempito gettandovi un pò di sabbia con gli arti posteriori. Ed ora l'animale ricomincia il suo faticoso viaggio di ritorno attraverso la spiaggia, ma, prima di muoversi, con le pinne butta sabbia in tutte le direzioni per cancellare alla superficie ogni traccia del nido. All'alba la femmina è di nuovo sana e salva in mare. Di solito, parecchi maschi stanno in attesa nuotando al largo, ed uno di essi si accoppia con la femmina che ha appena lasciato la spiaggia.<br>  <br>  La raccolta delle uova di tartaruga è ora monopolio del Governo del Sarawak (nell'isola di Borneo) ed è severamente regolata in modo da assicurare la schiusa di molte di esse, per incrementare la popolazione delle tartarughe. I nativi che raccolgono le uova hanno un rispetto quasi superstizioso per le tartarughe. Infatti, la possibilità che una delle femmine venga uccisa è considerata con lo stesso orrore che potrebbe suscitare l'idea di uccidere l'oca dalle uova d'oro. Ciò nondimeno, il numero di uova raccolte a Talang-Talang raggiunge un livello astronomico. In questa località la deposizione delle uova avviene durante tutto l'anno, ma con un ciclo stagionale ben definito. Il numero minimo di uova raccolte in un mese del 1933, in una delle isole, fu di 8401. Questo accadde nel mese di gennaio, poi, di mese in mese con aumento costante, si arrivò in agosto al totale altissimo di 147.259, per ridiscendere in dicembre a una produzione di sole 25.831. Nel periodo 1927-1936 in questa isola si toccò la massima punta mensile di produzione, nel luglio 1934, con 423.048. Nel 1934 il totale delle uova raccolte fu di 1.790.370.<br>  <br>  <br>  Tartaruga caretta<br>  immagine intera <br>  Tracce sulla sabbia di una Caretta caretta <br>  <br>  <br>  La tartaruga caretta (Caretta caretta) si distingue dalle tartarughe verdi per la testa più grossa e per altre particolarità dello scheletro e delle placche esterne della corazza. Per la sua forma idrodinamica, per gli arti a forma di remo e la maniera di nuotare, somiglia assai alle altre tartarughe marine. A differenza delle Dermochelidi sembra che, sia la tartaruga caretta che la tartaruga verde, vengano a riva per riscaldarsi al sole e non soltanto per deporre le uova. Le tartarughe caretta sono carnivore e forse per questo sono considerate un cibo meno gradevole delle tartarughe verdi che si nutrono di alghe. Come per queste ultime, anche per le tartarughe caretta vi sono differenze sensibili tra i due gruppi del Pacifico e dell'Atlantico. Se nelle gigantesche tartarughe verdi il peso di oltre 226 chili può considerarsi un fenomeno del tempo passato, anche nelle tartarughe caretta la corporatura si è di molto ridotta e il peso di 135 chili è già diventato una rarità.<br>  La tartaruga caretta si estende più verso nord e sud, al di fuori dei tropici, sia come area di distribuzione generale, sia come zone attuali di nidificazione, giacché in altri tempi nidificava verso nord fino alla Virginia. E' comune nel Mediterraneo, e la si cattura spesso lungo le coste italiane. Sembra che l'abituale stagione nuziale sulle spiagge della Florida e della Georgia cada all'incirca nella "prima luna piena di giugno", ma i primi nidi si possono trovare in aprile e gli ultimi in agosto. I nidi sono posti oltre il livello dell'alta marea, perché l'acqua salsa danneggerebbe quelli messi troppo in basso. La tartaruga scava la sabbia adoperando soltanto gli arti posteriori, foggiati a badile, fino a raggiungere una profondità da quarantacinque a sessanta centimetri. Poi si mette con la coda e la cloaca sulla buca ed espelle le uova ad una media di dodici o più al minuto. Il numero di uova in ogni singola covata oscilla da un minimo di 60 a un massimo di 150 e più. La durata dell'incubazione varia secondo la posizione del nido e l'andamento stagionale, e richiede da 30 a 65 giorni. I nascituri rimangono per breve tempo nel guscio e poi escono in massa dal nido per avviarsi verso il basso, nella direzione dove l'orizzonte è più aperto. Cosa ne sia dei molti neonati che raggiungono il mare non sappiamo con certezza, ma possiamo arguire che i predoni ne divorano una buona parte. La cattura di tartarughe neonate o di piccola taglia è molto rara.<br>  La carne della Caretta non gode buona reputazione. Si dice che quella degli adulti sia coriacea e fibrosa; tuttavia, quando è macinata, può sostituire alla meno peggio la carne di bue tritata. Questa idea preconcetta non si estende sino alle uova, che sono consumate in tutte le Indie Occidentali ed in passato si vendevano nelle strade di Savannah e di Charleston, dove erano specialmente apprezzate per la pasticceria. Se vogliamo che questo cospicuo visitatore delle coste dell'Atlantico e del Golfo sopravviva, è urgente mettere in atto efficaci misure protettive e farle poi osservare.<br>  <br>  Il terzo tipo di tartaruga marina della famiglia Chelonidae, la tartaruga bastarda, a prima vista sembra in tutto simile alla tartaruga caretta.

ks2z4po8aa	First of all, no dog should ever be purchased from a website... It's not like ordering a sofa from Crate & Barrel... It's a living creature that will hopefully have a long and healthy life in your household.<br>  <br>  To find an AKC-registrable dog, you should probably check the breeders listed on the "(dog breed) Club of America" since they're "supposed" to adhere to ethical standards, but, most importantly, you also want to check that they properly health screen their dogs, at the very least checking "hips, spines, patellas, etc." on the OFA (Orthopedic Foundation of America) website at www.off.org, as well as getting the eyes tested (CERF-certification), as well as screening for Von Willedebrand's Disease, Bruscellosis, and countless other congenital defects and inherited diseases... <br>  <br>  Following your own searches on all these sites, you can then contact breeders and find out whether they have puppies for you to view, or have impending litters planned... Take your time... Learn as much as you possibly can about the breed in terms of conformation, temperament, and even gazes... The more you learn about the breed, the better chance you'll have of selecting a healthy dog.|`|ba8dd4c6a9b532bef579aff3e8706fe7aa	No such thing<br>  <br>  The best thing to try is to go to website of the parent club for the breed (usually something like "(breed) club of america") and see if they have a referral list.<br>  <br>  EDIT - I WOULDN'T recommend the AKC site either, lots of BYBs and puppymills advertise there.<br>  I went through the AKC classifieds for Basset Hounds, and did not find ONE breeder (out of 16) that I would consider buying a pup from.|`|p7swtBYzaa	No, a reputable, caring breeder who breeds occasionally and for the good of the breed - using a proven dog with a researched bloodline is going to have homes waiting before the pups are born.<br>  No good breeder would advertise and sell to anyone and everyone, often shipping the dogs, which is a horrible, unsafe thing to do to a pup.<br>  Those gorgeous websites are fronts for puppy mills and back yard breeders - ignore them.<br>  <br>  Your best bet for a good pup is to go to some local AKC sanctioned matches and talk to the people who show the breed you are interested in.<br>  Even great dogs have pups that are not showable - maybe the look is slightly off standard or the pup just doesn't like to be shown or handled by strangers yet.   Get a pup from someone like that if you must have a puppy.<br>  If you are more open to an adult dog of the breed you like, try an online search for that breed rescue - there are dogs in foster care in rescues through no fault of their own looking for good homes.<br>  You would get a dog whose looks and temperament you know - the rescue has assessed the dog and vetted and spayed/neutered it already - a terrific deal for you and the dog.<br>  <br>  Good luck - but don't buy by remote from some puppy miller with a fancy website.|`|23a9a397ca0d0ff6f0dae262ba570eecaa	No responsible or reputable breeder would sell their pups online without meeting the new owners or having the new owners meet the pup first.|`|AA11244754	Petfinder.com|`|treMs6hOaa	There are many good breeders on-line, and also puppy mills.

eyhBQ2tQaa	Before getting a companion for your dog you need to establish the fact that you're the pack leader and make some rules, boundaries, make sure she knows her limits, etc. <br>  Has she been through Obedience Class? <br>  What ever breed you go for you must make sure it has a lower level of energy than your current dog. This way there will be less of chance of competition for dominance, etc if you're not a consistent Pack leader. <br>  Proper exercise will most likely curb most of her bad behavior, etc and consistent corrections are always needed. <br>  When you introduce your dog to the new pack member do it on neutral territory and take them both for a long walk together. Walking is bonding time, they're following their leader together creating unity. <br>  Anyways, good luck.|`|lIytpzAGaa	Although she is almost a year old she is not the owner of the house.

The home is HER home. That is how she sees it, and she will be protective of her space.

The head is chiseled with an abrupt stop. The muzzle is wide, deep and broad with a square jaw. The upper lip hangs down, covering the lower jaw completely. The teeth are strong and should meet in a scissors bite. The nose is always black on black dogs, but may be brown on other dogs. The eyes are round, set on so they look straightforward. The eye rims are slightly oval. The body is compact, with a short back. The topline should slope gently downwards from front to back. The front legs are straight, with good bone. Dewclaws on front and rear legs should be removed. The coat comes in buff, black, and other solid colors, black-and-tan (like a Rottweiler or Doberman Pinscher), parti-color (white with black, white with buff or red, white with black and tan points) Some requirements for correct markings are specified in the standard. The tail is docked to 2/5 it's original length and is carried on a line with its back; it is constantly in motion.  Field lines generally have shorter coats which are better suited to work in brush. They also have better hunting instincts. Both types make good pets. <br>  Temperament<br>   Bold and keen to work, the American Cocker Spaniel is equally suited to life as a gundog or as a household pet. Cheerful, sweet, and sensitive. The Cocker Spaniel is respectful of its master's authority without much challenge. Merry and endearing. A happy tail-wagger. Gentle and trusting, with average intelligence. They are lively, playful and devoted, but should be socialized well when they are young to avoid a tendency for shyness. Usually good with children. Cockers love everyone and need people to be happy. They can be difficult to housebreak and some like to bark. However they are mostly easy to train and get along well with other animals. Note: This is a very popular breed; the above is the typical temperament of the American Cocker Spaniel, like any breed there are always exceptions. Due to this breeds popularity one must be careful to choose a Cocker from a reputable breeder; as some have reported in to the Dog Breed Info Center? reports of Cockers that have not had great temperaments and were not good with children. Cockers with this type of temperament are not typical of the breed. Before adopting an American Cocker, be sure to give it a puppy temperament test and if possible ask to meet the parents. Beware of poorly bred puppy-mill Cockers as they may have bizarre temperamental changes and behavioral problems. This would include shy-sharpness, which is a combination of fear and dominance that can cause viciousness. Also Submissive urinating; aggressive guarding of objects, people and places, hyper-sexuality and roaming.  <br>  Height, Weight<br>   Height: Dogs 15 ? inches (38cm.) Bitches 14 ? inches (36.8cm.)<br>  Weight: 15-30 pounds (7-14 kg.) <br>  Health Problems<br>   Some major concern in American Cocker Spaniels are cataracts, glaucoma and patellar luxation. Some minor concerns are hip dysplasia, ectropion, entropion, PRA, allergies, seborrhea, lip fold pyoderma, otitis externa, liver disease, urolithiasis, prolapse of nictitans gland, CHF, phosphofructokinase deficiency, and cardiomyopathy. Occasionally seen are gastric torsion and elbow dysplasia. Also IMHA (Immune Mediated Hemolytic Anemia) One owner stated, "Our cocker never had a sick day in her life until she suddenly became lethargic and urinated blood. Six days later, and $3000 in vet bills, she died. I know you can't list every illness due to space limitations, but the internal medicine specialist that treated our dog said that IMHA is relatively common in cockers, and almost always fatal.  It's a fast-acting, silent killer. <br>  Living Conditions<br>   Cockers will do okay in an apartment if they are adequately exercised, and are fairly active indoors. A small yard is sufficient. <br>  Exercise<br>   American Cockers have plenty of stamina and need regular exercise. They should be taken on daily, long walks. When walking, avoid brushy thickets that can tangle the coat. <br>  Life Expectancy<br>   About 12-15 years. <br>  Litter Size<br>   1 - 7 puppies - Average of 5 <br>  Grooming<br>   The eyes need regular cleaning. Some owners prefer to leave the coat long, brushing daily and shampooing frequently with quarterly scissoring and clipping. Others prefer to clip the coat to medium length to be more functional. Either way, the dog will need regular trimming. When brushing, be careful not to pull out the silky hair. This breed is an average shedder. <br>  Origin<br>   The popular Cocker Spaniel, sometimes called the American Cocker Spaniel, was originally developed from careful breeding of the English Cocker Spaniels brought to the United States. The American Cocker Spaniel is smaller than the English Cocker Spaniel and has a different conformation. The name "Cocker" comes from the woodcock, a game bird these spaniels flushed particularly well. Today, the Cocker Spaniel serves primarily as a companion and glamorous show dog. It can also be used for hunting, tracking, retrieving, watchdogging|`|jmdvoMMlaa	If you are going to kennel the dog, you would want the larger one, the German Sheppard, which is also a great watch dog.  I would recommend a golden retriever if you want a dog that will be inside/outside.  They are also very loyal, love to play and are great with people.  They also can be good guard dogs.  If you want a house dog, but one that loves to go outside, not live outside, the cocker spaniel is the one.  I have 2 right now and they are great companions, more like my 2 kids!|`|ks2z4po8aa	Wow! They're entirely on opposite sides of the spectrum, and two entirely different dogs, but you really, really need to do your homework... The GSD is a working dog and has spatial and exercise needs... The French Bulldog is a companion dog that requires a climate-controlled environment, learning to deal with the specific grooming needs, and can NEVER be left outdoors unsupervised for long stretches of time... They don't fare well in any extreme climate, neither the cold or the heat... While they're certainly playful, they're not known for their loyalty... They're gregarious, friendly, and generally easy for strangers to approach... Will they guard your house? They'll definitely bark if you're home, but if a robber breaks in they'll usually grab toys and encourage the thief to play with them... And, no, Frenchies don't go for long walks... Long walks are for OTHER dogs, especially Jack Russell Terriers... Dashshunds... Whippets... etc. <br>  <br>  Best wishes in your endeavors,<br>  <br>  TM|`|VYeA3Dj4aa	I would say a german shepard...but, you will have to invest in some good training for it.

Here's a couple suppliers of ballistic nylon stuffed toys: <a href="http://www.k9ballistics.com/shop/cart.php?m=product_list&c=6" rel="nofollow">http://www.k9ballistics.com/shop/cart.ph...</a> <a href="http://www.dogtoys.com/bamboocombat.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogtoys.com/bamboocombat.html</a>|`|DpNk8ZpLaa	Is there any reason why you aren't giving this dog real bones to chew on?<br>  <br>  Remember to always choose size-appropriate bones for your dog, and to never give him cooked bones.  Raw only.<br>  <br>  In the summer, I give them to my dog frozen -- a meatsicle! -- and it keeps him cool, as well as taking a longer time to destroy.|`|AA11679636	Our dog chews everything. We always give him rubber toys and rope toys. Stuff with the fake plasticy/rubbery rope usually lasts him a while. Hope this helps. |`|AA11735193	Besides the plethora of raw bones, I've always just got rope( good, thick nylon rope) from the hardware store. Get about six or seven feet and tie the ends together. It's good for their teeth too.|`|32c09712280daecc1aee4e79836615aeaa	Nylabones are very hard and practically indestructible.|`|npROcnkCaa	You should try a thick canvas toy,  they have stuffing in them, but the exterior is really tough!!
Bw18seFqaa	Mixed breed dogs are not technically "hybrids".  A Hybrid animal is the result of breeding 2 different species.  Such as when you breed a horse and a donkey, you get a mule.  A mule is often infertile.<br>  <br>  ALL dogs are the SAME specie!  There are different variations among the specie from selective breeding.. but they are still the same (poor example, but its like how we have people of different races with different skin color, hair color, etc.. but we are all still people and all still capable of producing children, providing there are no infertility problems).  <br>  <br>  If a dog is infertile, its not because its a mix.  Even purebreds can be infertile.  Infertility happens for other reasons... disease, injury, or even some other genetic condition that has nothing to do with the dog being pure or mix.<br>  <br>  Most purebreds are the result of selectivly breeding certain other breeds together and breeding for specific traits.  Yes, essentually, they all started as mixes.  So, if you do believe that theory, how is it we get purebreds that are capable of reproduction if mixes are infertile?<br>  <br>  <br>  Any breed of dog can mate and produce pups with any other breed of dog..  it doesnt matter if the dog is a mixed breed or pure.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	Mutt's are not hybrids.  You get a hybrid when you cross two different species.  All dogs are actually the same species.  They're just different varieties of that species. <br>  <br>  Most hybrids are sterile, but there are many that are not.  Mother natures plays by her rules, not by the rules set down by biologists.|`|70878cc978ee2e4a79b3b53284340f9caa	No,it not true.Why do you think there are so many mutts? Do you think that every one of them came from two purebreds? Mutts are very fertile.|`|qgeI6Chxaa	I wish that were true, but it isn't. All dogs are the same species, they just come in lots of shapes and sizes.|`|81675c7bcc2aa81478472216e01229f7aa	Someone told you wrong.  Mutts are very fertile unless they are spayed or neutered.|`|bUtl3fDkaa	Dog are all the same species, therefore can inter-breed and have fertile offspring.<br>  <br>  It's only hybrids, meaning 2 different species (such as donkey + horse = mule) that are sterile.<br>  .|`|DpNk8ZpLaa	Wouldn't that be fantastic, if mutts were born sterile?<br>  <br>  People could enjoy the mutt-ly types they love, without worry of making dozens and dozens more!|`|WQQBI3WHaa	Pure Bred + Pure Bred = Pure Bred <br>  Mutt + Mutt = More unwanted Mutts.|`|6ohrp7MEaa	Mutts are fertile.

SfqYmLOjaa	Let me tell you kong toys are AMAZING!! I would suggest a medium though the smalls are really small but the medium will be a perfect size up until adult hood and you could still use it than too. Ya you  can pretty much fit any type of dog treats in there but my favorite thing to use is peanut butter or wet dog food its cheap and it lasts a lot longer. The kong toys have a whole in the middle that is smaller on the top and larger on the bottom and dogs spend hours being occupied on them! But with dog treats they can get them out pretty easy, but peanut butter and wet dog food lasts a long time and you can freeze it too so it dosn't make such a mess! But you dont really have to worry about your puppy chocking on them they'll be to occupied with whats inside D |`|HFn2G8HXaa	I bought the kong that was the hardest to chew up for my Siberian when she was a pup. She was a strong chewer and everything else I had gotten her was coming apart in a couple days (or less). I also got another toy that was rated 9 on the canine scale that she has not chewed up yet. I got it at the pet supply store, its from TUFFIES PET TOYS (mydogtoy.com)|`|DpNk8ZpLaa	It's fine.<br>  <br>  My GSD puppy loved a bit of peanut butter inside his Kong.  Took him hours to work it out with his tongue.  Small quantities only!  :)|`|FkYVZvYIaa	you should be fine the kong products are great i have 1 for my staffy as she has broken every toy but this 1|`|08c6c096da95f5ff1b797a03b7509912aa	The best thing to do is give your puppy, puppy products. |`|t9Fxx75uaa	I'd take the dog to Petsmart or your local pet store and talk to the people there.  I have no idea what size your dog is so I can't recommend anything with a clear conscience.  My dog is only 12 lbs but is a very very strong chewer and he has the medium red Kong. He had the puppy blue and white kong when he was about 4-7 lbs and chewed the top knob off it.   I don't order toys on the internet for my dog cause you don't get the "feel" of it and can't tell how sturdy it is etc.|`|CyWFEUjTaa	Yes it is fine. The only difference is that the puppy kongs are made of softer rubber that is more soothing for teething puppies. If you are talking about the large kong treats, it usually says on the box which kong toys they will fit. Otherwise you will have to compare the size of the hole in the kong toy to the size of the treats to see if they fit.|`|bUtl3fDkaa	Yep, it will be fine. All of the Kongs are made to be tough. The puppy ones are just a little bit softer rubber, but puppies can handle the adult ones just fine too. (And likewise, my adult dog still has her puppy kongs because I find no reason to pay to replace them when they're still in perfectly good condition.)<br>  .|`|AA10202158	I bought my spaniel mix a kong toy and he would rather have an old plastic peanut butter jar, smeared with peanut butter inside than the kong toy.    It was a waste of money, for me anyway.|`|JaFbuUUWaa	They are one of the only toys we have found that our little lady doesn't immediatly chew right through, they are great toys, a little pricey, but worth the extra imo. : )|`|koKvQrkXaa	Those toys are suppose to be indestructible so it should be ok
oooWpy6Qaa	No it's not possible. They would need your signature, you would have needed to register the litter and each of the puppies. They are lying, and have gotten a fake registration. Likely using papers from another dog. You should report them. Who cares about the money they are making, they are doing something very wrong.<br>  |`|7qFYd0y8aa	Perhaps you should report it to the adba|`|3zv2bbolaa	ADBA is an open registry and only requires a three generation pedigree from just about any legitimate and some not so legitimate registries is all that is required for registration.<br>  <br>  If the sire or the dam of the dog being registered is registered with the ADBA they at least  require the owners' of those dogs to sign the registration application.|`|MFZr5yhAaa	It's quite easy to register any dog to a lot of differant registries. Like the new designer dogs, that are just mixes, they can be registered.<br>  <br>  With the adba, you can register a dog, but they'd have to already be registered with other registries (like ukc). Or if the dam and sire were adba registered, they'd just have to get your signature.<br>  <br>  You can register with the for a limited registration, but the dog must be altered.<br>  <br>  It's very easy to "hang" papers. Which is the fake papers. They could have easily said that she came out of "so and so's dam and sire" to get her registered.<br>  <br>  Sad they are doing all this.<br>  |`|V7AAba8Laa	No animal can be registered without a pedigree and/or transfer of ownership.  <br>  <br>  They have either falsified paperwork or are passing her off as the offspring of another pedigreed animal that may have died or was sold without paperwork.<br>  <br>  If you are certain that this is the dog you sold, you can contact the breed registry and notify them of this happening.  At the very least, the BYB will be kicked out of the registry.<br>  <br>  Animal registries exist for a reason, and if someone is caught falsifying documents, they are forbidden from registering animals in the future.  Such action discredits other reputable breeders and the registry organizations themselves.  Report them ASAP.<br>  <br>  In the future, if you are selling animals, it is worthwhile to screen potential buyers better, sell the animal only after it has been spayed or neutered, or microchip. |`|Viyd8Furaa	no its not possible....and yes you can get fake papers, this is why when you sold the dog you should have made a contract saying the dog must be spayed and can not be used for breeding...nothing you can do now to help the dog, except report the people to ADBA.. but that doesnt mean they cant still breed her.poor dog.|`|DpNk8ZpLaa	I am not sure why anyone would even care about a registration into the ABDA.  It's a way to get around the legitimate registry of the AKC, CKC or other national registry.<br>  <br>  To me, a puppy with only a ABDA is worth no more than any other unregistered pup.<br>  <br>  That being said; yes, they fabricated a pedigree and registered the dog.  Unless you can prove to the registry it was your dog and you sold it to them without papers, I am not sure there is anything the ABDA can or will do about it.  They already got their money, what do they care? :/
ks2z4po8aa	The previous respondent is correct... Backyard breeders really are clueless when it comes to the intricacies of breeding, never properly health-screening or having X-rays examined, which is why their puppies don't conform to the standard... And there's no size chart, per se... There's a standard... Dogs are supposed to have a certain "appearance" and their weight is supposed to fall within a range, from the lighter and cobbier Frenchies that are 17 - 21 pounds, to the larger-sized Frenchies that top out at 28 pounds, or even exceed that weight... Frenchies generally mature between a year-and-a-half to two years, more noticeable in the males as opposed to the females who tend to mature within their first year... <br>  <br>  Best wishes to you and your puppy.|`|nlMfJtxcaa	Dogs that don't come from good breeders rarely fit their breed standard. Small dogs like Frenchies will reach their height at around 6 months and fill out in weight and bulk from there. If your dog doesn't look correct around now, she probably won't ever look like a Frenchie from a good breeder. Your best bet is to get her spayed and not worry about her looks, just enjoy her as a pet.
Ue5NoJOgaa	Get em young and handle them often or they are skittish, beyond that I really loved mine when i had them, also they don't get quite as large and hard to care for as a lot of the other large lizards so that is nice|`|ZRGkOB7oaa	yes!! They are really cool little critters if you get them but they do have large housing requirements which includes both terrestrial and aquatics parts of the tank. I believe i heard they grow to about 2 feet which is substantially larger than most pet reptiles but are still smaller than their larger iguana counterparts. I especially love the males because they have really cool dorsal fins:) Reminds me of something out of a dinosaur movie lol|`|WnwrWmEAaa	they sound kwl what are they? :D

Hounds are breed  to work and have a high level of endurance.  Terriers (jack russells, pit bulls, etc) have a high energy drive and therefore must have an owner willing to spend an hour at minimum per day exercising the body and challenging the mind. If not you'll end up with a dog that rips up your sofa, walls, etc.  I would also suggest an english bulldog - but you should really be an experienced dog owner to take on the breed- they are very expensive to maintain and can have some serious medical conditions.<br>  <br>  You could also check out the shelter.  The shelter where I live has a system where they put the dogs through different tests to determine what their energy levels and personalities are.  |`|ks2z4po8aa	While dogs have inherent traits that they're known for, each dog is different in temperament just as people are different and obedience-training and proper exercise go a long way in assuring you a happy and well-balanced dog... Be especially careful in selecting a puppy and studying its gaze... Dogs should have deep brown eyes... If the whites of the eyes show or protude, the dog can have behevioral problems... Make sure the dog doesn't have "wall eye", or isn't cross-eyed (other signs of dementia)... And decide what kind of dog it is you want and then contact hobby breeders through the national breed clubs... Tell the breeder the exact kind of temperament that you want so that they can assist you with selecting your perfect puppy...

E11fB7iAaa	Take BOTH kitties to your veterinarian.  They both need to be examined and treated for whatever they may have.  Most kitties at this age are putting reasonably firm stool into the cat boxes.<br>  <br>  Remember to have them spay/neutered at 5 months, and make them INDOOR cats only!  They will live long and healthy lives.  I have one kitty that we raised from 4 months, we got him in 1988.

Chicken is the best option, none of the prepared cat foods and try and get some special kitten milk from your vets (never use cows milk as most cats are lactose intolerant and get diarrhoea from it) keep plenty of fresh water down as well.  If this doesn't work and it persists or they seem unwell take them to the vet, only danger is that they are dehydrated. I have bottle fed and weaned kittens before, try not to worry the chicken trick does work but only feed them this and persist with it (odds are that's all a vet will tell you) Good luck ;-)|`|c1e9549af86c487364c948ec19681882aa	5 weeks is a bit too young to be away from mommy cat. Ideally, kittens should be kept with the mother till they are 8 weeks old. Diarrhea is not normal for kittens if it lasts more than a day or two. It can dehydrate them very quickly, and cause many problems, even death. You would be wise to seek the help of a good veterinarian, who can help you find out what is wrong with your kitten. <br>  <br>  Aside from that, I have linked a few pages below on how to care for a young kitten. These pages are for abandoned kittens, and I know yours is not abandoned, but like I said, if they are really only 5 weeks old then that is too young to be away from mommy cat and they will need a bit of special care.<br>  <br>  Good luck, I hope this helps =^.^=|`|Ue5NoJOgaa	If you just adopted them, odds are their diet changed (food type, amount of food, timing of feedings) any of that could cause that.

Where did you adopt them from?  Have they been to the vet?  If they have already been checked out it is probably something simple.

If they have not been to the vet yet it is time for their first trip.|`|XoGXxv1Baa	What diet do you feed it and how often
TpOVmqpHaa	Both breeds are have breathing problems.  Both are almost always born by cesarian because the way they've been bred has rendered them largely incapable of whelping naturally.  The majority of breeding is done by artificial means for the same reason.  They have major breathing problems and are very intolerant of heat.  In short, they are breeds who could not survive in the wild.  That may not be a concern for some people, but I have problems with it.<br>  If you do go forward with these breeds, please talk to the breeders about these issues in depth and choose very wisely, to increase your chances of getting a healthier than average pup.|`|4TX26viFaa	VERY hard breathing problems in hot humid weather, these dogs are not going to be able to run around in the sun.  There are mouth/jaw/tooth problems too in the English ones as the jaws are distorted.<br>  <br>  Skin problems (the rolls of skin make them prone to that).  And check for hip dysplasia in the heavier breed.|`|iIBQ1Ye0aa	they have a big personality and can be stubborn so early training is best,the do have breathing issue but if properly cared for will have a long life,the skin issues are something else to consider but with good soap when you bathe them i use oatmeal kind and i also condition my dog after i shampoo her and keep all her wrinkles clean and dry.i brush my dogs teeth about 3 times a week,i have a english bulldog and she snores and is the funnest of my pack,the are loyal and get attached to their owners and like i said have big personality's and are very much worth the issues,which i haft to say with a responsible owner and good vet care they are that big of a problem,i don't take my dog to the vet anymore than the rest and she is in perfect condition.I love the bull dog breeds and they make good family pets as well,get the dog from a good breeder and that will cut down on health issues.|`|hKVOw1Sjaa	As you must be aware they are different and characterized by the flat nose breed of dogs so you  have to be prepared for possible breathing problems in some lines.Their temperament is different in fact as the  frenchis is more active whereas the english bulldog is a little more bulky and slow.l would go to the AKC site if you are in the States and it will give you a whole history of the breed and its traits|`|5lvNo1Shaa	they have alot of health problems so make sure you get it from a reputable breeder and not a pet store/backyard breeder.

Your best bet is to definitely get referrals from the national breeder directory of the French Bulldog Club of America (<a href="http://www.frenchbulldogclub.org)" rel="nofollow">http://www.frenchbulldogclub.org)</a> since most are hobby breeders that show in conformation and strive to produce sound, well-conformed and exemplary dogs according to the standards...<br>  <br>  Things to avoid are Backyard Breeders... MOST of the thousands of French Bulldogs around today happen to be bred by Backyard Breeders, in fact... They have websites... They have registered or unregistered kennel names... They say that "the puppies are lovingly raised by our family"... They say AKC registerable even... But they don't show in conformation, their dogs are not champion-sired (you'll have to go 2 or 3 generations back to see any champions even)... And most importantly, their dogs are not properly health-screened... They breed randomly, pairing any 2 dogs, without any regard to the health of future generations and it's done purely for profit and churning out puppies... <br>  <br>  Ethical hobby breeders not only show their dogs, they do proper health-screening... You can cross-reference their dogs on public search engines such as The Orthopedic Foundation of America (www.offa.org) or PENN/HIP (for spines, patellas, hips, hearts)... Their dogs are also BAER and CERF-certified for hearing and vision... <br>  <br>  The national French Bulldog show just took place in Kansas City... Most of the hobby breeders congregated and exhibited their dogs this past month... Your best bet to find a healthy Frenchie is to contact the local FBDCA members in your state for referrals since they'll know reputable breeders around the country... You should also join your local MeetUp group at <a href="http://frenchbulldog.meetup.com" rel="nofollow">http://frenchbulldog.meetup.com</a> - Talking with other members and seeing their dogs, you'll be able to get referrals and hear about which breeders to avoid...<br>  <br>  Lastly, reputable breeders do not "advertise" on any sites such as Next-Day-Pets, or Pets-4-You, or Kijiji or Hoobly... Reputable breeders, in fact, are not allowed to advertise as it is against their code of ethics... They do have websites, but they'll also display their show wins and ribbons... Reputable breeders will ONLY sell puppies with mandatory spay / neuter contracts unless you intend to actually show a dog in conformation and campaign for the dog's championship... Reputable breeders are protective of their blood-lines and genuinely care about whom they place their pet puppies with... They will require you to fill out a lengthy application... They will ask you lots of questions about your household, your lifestyle and how you intend to care and train the puppy... Reputable breeders will not sell a dog without doing a complete background check or have a trusted person complete a home inspection on their behalf... <br>  <br>  Reputable breeders do not accept credit cards, PayPal or take deposits on puppies... They won't take a dime from any buyer until they've actually screened a person thoroughly and intend to place a puppy in their care... <br>  <br>  And that's how you find a reputable breeder... They'll even provide you with a lifetime guarantee of guidance, counsel, and will insist on taking the dog back if you ever find yourself unable to care for the dog.<br>  <br>  Best wishes in your endeavors.<br>  <br>  TM |`|w2szGbrTaa	You need to do lots of research, normally if you have a bit of common sense you can differentiate a back yard breeder or puppy mil from a reputable breeder. Use your head and do some research. |`|JUyDrPNcaa	Though I have to agree with a great deal of what TM says - I do believe that there are Very Good hobby breeders who do not show their own dogs, but do breed champions and sell very good conformation quality pups.  I once purchased a dog from a breeder who had not only been the president of her breed club but also was a vet and DID demand a deposit as well as advertise her puppies/ kennel - so I would disagree that it is against a code of ethics to do so.  You aren't sworn in to a standard when you decide to become a breeder, and I guess thats the real issue - but whether you show or not, whether you judge or not, nothing is completely standardized or the breeds would never advance.  That being said, caution is definitely needed and I would say that one of the best ways to find a reputable breeder is to rely on just that - reputation.  Go to a show and see for yourself who is in your area.  Ask for references - people you can call an speak with personally.  Find ones in your area that have the breed and have GREAT (not just good) experiences with their breeders.  It can be much more simple than it's made to seem.|`|ZD9GWbh6aa	Definitely a member of the french bulldog club because the breeder referral from AKC doesn't mean anything.  They could still be a backyard breeder who just registers their dogs w/AKC.  By finding a member of the breed club, they'll most likely show their dogs, which is a step in the right direction.  They should want to interview you, and you should do the same for them.|`|DTOeC2Praa	Try the web for a French bulldog owners club or kennel club site and look for a link.<br>  Be sure to visit were you buy your puppy from if the place doesn't feel right it probably isn't.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|rt3Hyocfaa	There is a breeder directory on the French Bulldog Club of America website of breeders in good standing with the FDBCA.  |`|ouhgE5INaa	I wish I had a a french bulldog.
ks2z4po8aa	Perhaps obeying the leash laws would help? You're responsible for anything that happens if your dog is unleashed... If the dog bites someone, you're responsible... If your dog runs into the street and causes an accident, you're responsible... If the dog digs a hole in someone's garden, you're responsible... Learn to walk your dog properly on a leash and you won't have to worry about her coming back or getting lost.|`|3giaPYe8aa	The safest thing would be to keep her on a leash.  You say she runs off and you have no idea where she has been.  I hope she is spayed before she comes back pregnant one day.  Also,  I would hate to see her get hit by a car or have someone either steal her or poison her.  Just keep the leash on if she can't be trusted before you either end up with an unwanted litter or a dead dog.|`|Ai8NrXB8aa	You need to buy a leash. Not a rope. A leash. Hook it to her collar. Walk. If she slips out of her collar, buy a harness. Good luck. <br>  <br>  <br>  -MDL?|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	She needs to be on a leash at all times when outside of the house or a fenced yard.  <br>  <br>  If you have one available, an obedience class would be excellent for you to learn how to teach her.  But even with that, she needs to stay on a leash.|`|p7swtBYzaa	You absolutely, definitely, need to walk your dog ON LEASH - don't let her run free.   Not only is that against the law in most areas, it will inevitably result in your dog getting hurt - run over, attacked by another animal, whatever.<br>  <br>  Leash walk your dog!!!<br>  <br>  |`|YoZZDqq9aa	How can your dog run off if he's on a leash?
TpOVmqpHaa	1.  ditch the thought of a staffie.  They're great dogs but should never be a 'first dog' for anyone.<br>  <br>  2.  Yorkies are nice, but finding a healthy well bred one can sometimes be a challenge.  <br>  <br>  3.  French Bulldog.  Sorry, I don't recommend any dog that has such breathing problems and can't have pups naturally.<br>  <br>  4.  Chihuahua.  Also great little dogs but many of them can be nasty nervous lil' buggers, so again very important to find a well-bred, stable temperamented one.<br>  <br>  Go with the yorkie or chi, but do your homework on each and find reputable breeders who guarantee their dogs.|`|14K1Vt3Paa	If you are choosing a dog to become a member of your family there are many considerations which should influence your choice. For instance , your living arrangements, space, time to devote to exercise, children, financial abilities, training, allergies etc. <br>  Each breed has inherent abilities which can enhance or be problematic in pet ownership. <br>  Don't just look at the pictures. From your four choices I don't see a commonality of canine traits. Be responsible, your pet may and expects to be with you for many years.|`|ZyJ0AGIQaa	Yorkie would be #1, French Bulldog #2, Chi #4 and Staffie #5<br>  <br>  Take into consideration their size, their temperament, how much they will eat, their upkeep costs and whether or not you have the discipline to train a "bully" dog correctly.|`|nbIa2Ivyaa	<a href="http://dogtime.com/find-dog" rel="nofollow">http://dogtime.com/find-dog</a><br>  <br>  There are stats there and you can compare the temperament and physical needs of each breed.|`|ks2z4po8aa	The above responses are all perfectly accurate, but also do the necessary research beforehand... Study dog-training manuals... Bone-up on potty-training methods beforehand... Devise a training schedule beforehand... Find actual puppy-training classes beforehand... Know the actual annual costs (for shots, food, etc. + set aside emergency funds for congenital defects or illnesses requiring costly surgeries or courses of treatment) Look around your home and really assess the space issues, the puppy-proofing, the hazardous items you may have around that are perfectly safe to you but could be lethal to a curious teething puppy... Don't only think of yourself living with a dog, but realize that it's a lifelong commitment where the dog is concerned... Do you have people that will care for it if you have to travel? And not all people you know may even like dogs... Dogs are great - really, really they are, they are, but they are living beings that have very specific needs... Whatever dog you do decide to get, let's hope that it's a mutually satisfying arrangement.<br>  <br>  Best wishes,<br>  <br>  TM|`|y7NxQcIIaa	staffordshire bull terrier or any other dog need to be walked everyday and training. The bigger the dog, the bigger its bite. Make sure you can socialize your dog. If you know you can handle the dog on walks and make sure he doesn't jump on other people or dogs. Then it is a suitable dog for you. <br>  Then you need to look at your lifestyle and the temperament of the dog, if you are a quiet person that doesn't like to go anywhere...you don't want to get a dog that is hyper and want to run around the track all day. That won't be a compatible match.<br>  Oh yeah if the idea of picking up a huge warm pile of poop with a plastic bag doesn't sound appealing to you, get a small dog. Big dog takes big dumps and you are supposed to pick them up when you walk your dog. That's what a responsible owner dog.

O0AfxH9Eaa	I loathe it, it's from New Zealand I think. Even the smell makes me hurl. Your cat is after the yeast in it. I have yeasty cat treats for my boys and they love them. NB you mustn't feed it to your cat, the salt is very bad for him.|`|3arJsZ91aa	I love marmite - great on toast, or in a cheese and lettuce sandwich!  One day my cat decided to be cheeky and steal some toast from my plate.  She took one lick of the marmite and dropped it.  I am glad as I don't want to share it with her!|`|X4hz3a9haa	cause its a meaty salty flavour, Its either loved ot hated, with my cats, one would love it, where the other would not, she likes things like Paracetamols, ( never had one by the way  just smelt one and liked it) and Tobacco, Perfume, Soap.   Anything that a cat should like, Cream, Ham, Chicken, etc she turns her nose up at. They are such contrary animals.|`|rMP9BCyGaa	Both my cats like Marmite especially, it seems, when I have a cheese spread & Marmite sarnie lol....they are very good at helping themselves to a bite or two!<br>  <br>  As for the origins of Marmite - The Marmite Food Extract Company was formed in Burton upon Trent, Staffordshire, England, in 1902, with Marmite as its main product, and Burton as the site of the first factory. The by-product yeast needed for the paste came from the biggest brewer at the time, Bass Brewery. By 1907, the product had become successful enough to warrant construction of a second factory at Camberwell Green in London.  (info from Wikipedia)|`|WqGxGJkbaa	It is made of yeast extract which is quite salty and that is what cats love.  We have it on toast here and you either love it or hate it (I love it and so does one of my cats).  A very small amount on your finger now and again will not hurt your cat but, as I have said, it does contain a lot of salt so don't give it too much.|`|9VV8qic0aa	Ha.. we all love it here.. me, hubby and our 6 cats... think it's the salty flavour they like.

It won't hurt her, but don't give her too much everyday, just make sure she drinks alot of water.  B vitamins are great for stress, so you will have a very calm and happy cat.  This stuff is really healthy and it's big in Austrailia, well the Vegamite is and most Austrailian I've met are super nice I think it's the vegamite on toast they all get growing up, they use it like we use jelly/jam.|`|9PKyOE1Gaa	lol, yeah we have marmite in the uk. horrible stuff (i think anyway!) lol. dont know where its from originally or anything...but my friends cat likes eating marmite too. dont know if it does them any harm, i guess you'll have to find that out, or find out whats in it and see about any of that. dont wanna harm kitty!<br>  <br>  dont know why he loves it....its one of those things people either love or hate. im guessing your cat loves it :D|`|SrAbRJohaa	Well they say over hear in the UK you either love it or you hate it.<br>  I personally love it, my cats like it too cause its salty. dont let them have too much though just a taste as its yeast extract and probably not that great for them, but a lick now and then wont hurt.|`|uC0meKH5aa	lol, we love marmite here :D<br>  <br>  cat probably loves it because it has a very savoury flavour or something, I wouldn't worry about it though, i don't think it will do it any harm!|`|iMpyIpRwaa	Marmite - yuk!

T5ZAYYpNaa	Resolve has always worked best for me.  first ready the area with warm water (we have a scrub brush that we use), spray the area down really REALLY well, let it sit for about 5-10 minutes, then use warm water with the brush (continuesly rinsing) until its not sudsy anymore.  then you and rub dry with a towel (cotton, not paper).|`|Os6VjLH0aa	You might also try dampening the area with water and then sprinkling baking soda liberally on it, let it dry then vacuum it up.

LAXxaxAZaa	First you train your horse to bow with one knee bent. Train him how to do it on a whip cue by tapping his knee with the whip, holding his leg bent at the knee, and holding the treat between his legs. He'll go down to get the treat, and you position the leg you're holding where you want it. Keep doing this until he does it with just the whip cue.<br>  <br>  Then you have to teach him how to bow the same way from the other side. So you should now have a horse that will bow on one knee when you tap that knee with the whip, and bow on the other knee when you tap that knee with the whip.<br>  <br>  Then you tap both knees with the whip. If your horse knows the other cues well enough, he should go down on both knees. If he doesn't, you need to go back and teach him the other cues better.<br>  <br>  Once you have him on both knees, bend his head towards his stomach. You might need someone to push gently on his hip, too. Voila.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Now... That's how you want to do it. But there is a MUCH easier way that will work if your horse rolls a lot.<br>  <br>  All you have to do it hose your horse off, put him on a lunge line, and take him to some dirt. Wait for him to roll, walk over, and give him a treat. Once he understands what you want him to do, you can teach him a command.|`|9ycJ261daa	There is a lot of info out there in our reach but it may not be what your looking for everyone has their own way of training their horse and it may not be the best for you.

That's not something you can just leave alone or the infection will spread and eventually kill the dog.|`|qapJU3tMaa	And your question is?

9ea79964f4ddad1359a8089c6729bb4caa	The first answer is a good one.....rule out any medical issues first. <br>  Then, for a brush, I really like the Zoom Groom for short haired dogs. <a href="http://www.strictlypetsupplies.com/_035585511139-Kong-Company-Zoom-Groom-Soft" rel="nofollow">http://www.strictlypetsupplies.com/_0355...</a><br>  It has soft rubber bristles that get loose hair without irritating the skin. <br>  Also, what I do to keep my dogs smelling nice is once a week I brush them really well, then I wipe them down with a mixture of water, apple cider vinegar and a little dog shampoo. It elimates excess oil on the coat without drying the skin and the vinegar helps keep any odor away. Works like a charm.|`|e0eb82b689e1db392eb51c89982ed115aa	Get her thyroid checked. She is exuding too much fat... I would be sure there isnt an underlying medical issue she might have. I would then suggest after that is done you talk with your vet about the oily coat wash. Most things on the market will end up drying out her skin as well with such a thin coat.
pLcNxKh5aa	When cats or dogs play it is to build skills that they need when they become adults. For example your kitten most likely will play to gather skills for hunting and fighting. Like dogs, cats also play to keep fit. So don't frown upon playing. Like it! It is a good thing that your cat is keeping himself stimulated and happy.

You don't need to show them any affection. The python will just coil up in a dark corner of its cage silently and never bark, yelp. chirp or claw at the cage asking for attention. Unlike mammals and birds, you need not feed it every day. In fact, as it grows up feeding intervals can range from weeks to a month. (Leave water with the snake though.)<br>  <br>  Make sure the snake allows you to pet it or pick it up at the pet shop. Feeding and cleaning snake poop is extremely difficult with a hostile snake. A cage full of poop will send your mother a message that you cannot take care of the python.

However, simply inquiring about the product at the store that you typically purchase it from would probably get you an answer.  Next time you're in the pet shop, just ask one of the associates if they know why its not being stocked anymore.  Perhaps they could order you some if its just something that they stopped carrying.

IMPvzBk1aa	You don't need to combine the Preparation H with anything.  The sores of scratches. once the scabs are removed and the area cleansed and dried well is all that is needed to inhibit infection.  The preparation H is used to reduce the pain, itching, and swelling that bothers the horse.  It promotes healing and soothes the area....just use it by itself.  another ointment that I prefer for scratches is called EMT.  It also soothes, but is antimicrobial and is a collagen gel.  Collagen is the protein that forms the foundation for all connective tissue, including skin.  It is the best ointment I have ever used to promote rapid healing.<br>  But do not mix it with Preparation H......once you combine these medicines, the properties change.  Use one or the other.<br>  <br>  EDIT...scratches is a bacterial infection.  The bacteria live in the skin in a dormant state, and will activate and multiply in response to certain external conditions, and there is not always mud involved.  In fact, many stabled horses who are never near mud will develop  scratches.  When sores form, they harbor large populations of the anaerobic bacteria.  These bacteria thrive in the absence of oxygen.  Once the scabs are removed, and the areas beneath cleaned, any remaining bacteria will die just from the exposure to air.  The only reason to use any ointment is if it is needed to soothe painful tissue, which may be encourgaging the horse to chew on or scratch the irritated tissue and cause further damage.<br>  Preparation H stops the pain and itching without inhibiting healing the way steroids do..  EMT also does that, and promotes rapid healing.  Leaving the areas exposed, with no ointment, is just fine as well.  In some cases the bacteria invade deeper skin layers, and no topical treatment will reach the infection.  In these cases, systemic antibiotics can be injected to resolve the infection.  <br>  If your horse has severe symptoms of skin swelling and irritation, antibiotics should be given.|`|px27V5N9aa	I've used a mix of <br>  <br>  Preparation H<br>  Tea Tree Oil<br>  Bacitracin<br>  Tea bag (saturated)<br>  <br>  I'd put the Prep H and Tea Tree oil on the Tea bag and wrap the wound.<br>  If no wrapping was needed then just the Prep/oil/Bacitracin mixed together and applied.|`|B6zl0AJDaa	Never heard of Preparation H being used in a homemade wound ointment, however, back in the 1960's we used bacon grease for all cuts and scratches.  Then learned if you added iodine to it, it worked for removing warts on a horse's nose.<br>  <br>  Also learned that Motor Oil would cure sarcoptic mange, summer itch, Spanish Itch, etc.|`|YtBzRAxMaa	I have used Prep H on scratches with good results.<br>   I use diaper rash ointment with better results.<br>   The trick is to keep the area dry and clean - but moisturized to prevent itch. Vaseline works fine in mild cases and if applied before the scratches form, it can prevent it.<br>   Scratches are from standing in muck, usually found only on white pasterns.<br>   I would not put hemorrhoid cream on my horses' cut - spend some $ and get a tube of "Derma Gel" from your vet. This stuff is the best!|`|AA11211495	We used to make an ointment that used a packet of Azium, mixed with either zinc oxide or Desitin.  I imagine the Preparation H could be substituted for the zinc oxide or the Desitin as a means of getting the medicine to stick to the wound.  You would choose based on weather you wanted to dry the wound (zinc oxide) or keep it moist & supple (Desitin).|`|N2jvxYPcaa	I hate to be a wet blanket, but because I'm a nurse I'm very skeptical about homemade ointments in general. Many are not proven, and worse than that, many can be harmful. Once you've been taught the actual process that a wound goes through when healing, and what sort of things aid or stop that process, you begin to understand why some treatments work, and why some don't. For example, people used to apply butter to burns with the hopes that the butter would be soothing and help with pain control, plus keep the wound moist. We now know that applying butter to a wound only introduces fat and bacteria directly onto an open wound, plus the oily component tends to hold in the heat and can actually make the burn worse, not better! That wasn't the pioneer's fault, they didn't have other options and they were doing the best they could. But now wound care has been well studied, and drug manufactorers are glad to sell you many products that do work, and are safe.<br>  So I don't have any great homemade suggestions. I do know that scratches can be tough to treat, and sometimes takes a variety of things before clearing up. <br>  As an aside - it makes no sense to me why one ointment would help scratches and regular wounds. Wouldn't the ideal treatment for scratches be quite different than the ideal treatment for a simple abrasion? An abrasion only needs to be kept clean and allowed to refill and heal, scratches requires alot more, sometimes even steroid type ointment to relieve inflamation and irritation, and an antibiotic componenent to fight off the infection.

Klb8kTtDaa	I had a cat that would do that. He started when he was very young, and it continued until he passed away at age 17. The vet told me it was because of two things. The main problem was that he was eating too quickly, so we had to dole out his food slowly (giving him a tablespoon, then an hour later giving him more, etc).  The second problem was that he was having a difficult time eating the hard food and wasn't able to chew it well enough.  He also would eat the hard dog's food, which was bigger chunks.<br>  It wasn't hard to get him to stop throwing up, but it still happened on occasion.|`|3O6CTb3saa	Hi your kitty throwing up after eating can be several things but the one that sticks in my mind is that the food she is eating is not agreeing with her.  Have you tried changing the food going to Science Diet?  Does she have any other symptoms whatsoever?  Does she drink a lot of water?  Does she urinate a lot?  Sometimes cats can have diabetes and they will vomit.  But I would try the food change first.  Good Luck!|`|QjjStYhKaa	the only time my cat is sick it when he eats grass<br>  i dont no wether your cat goes out  but if he does  he may be eating grass<br>  as cats do this to make themselves sick usually because they feel unwell<br>  i suggest you take your cat to the vet to get him checked out|`|V4AEm8Jgaa	make sure she drinks lots of water and also give her some pepto bismo, wierd but it is vet recomended<br>  good luck; )|`|Qr7cTlFaaa	SHE MAY HAVE A SENSITIVE STOMACH AND NEEDS TO BE PUT ON SENSITIVE STOMACH TYPE OF  FOOD|`|tGmwqtr5aa	She probably eats too fast.|`|DtkLsetkaa	Try feeding her on a raised platform.  Some cats have a condition where their esophagus doesn't close when the food hits the stomach and the acid builds up and will cause irritation, causing the cat to vomit.  This happens when the cats bends its head down to eat.  Give it a shot, it doesn't hurt and could solve the problem.  Definitely take her into the vet tho.  It could be the kind of food (dry/wet?) or many other reasons, but this is worth a shot and causes no harm either way.  Good luck!!!|`|5f477cf9f429c86fcdfa05dc5d148aa0aa	my cat had an obstruction when he was doing that.

ZNe6B9TQaa	For the flying change, step heavily into our outside stirrup and put your inner thigh on (inner for whatever direction you are changing TO not from).  If that doesn't work, you can also try slipping what would be the new outside leg back, as though you were asking for the canter from a walk or a trot.  However, if she is actually trained to do flying changes then she should get it with just a little bit of your inside inner thigh pressure. Make sure you don't pull back or yank on the reins, or even gentally tug on them in any way--it could cause imbalance and/or her to become confused about what you're asking.  <br>  <br>  To encourage her to go on the bit, start with minimal contact on a longish rein.  Open your hands (so that the you make more of a V with the reins between your horses mouth and your hands) a bit wider than usual and use a combination of upper-arm half halts on the outside rein, while continuing to follow your horse's motion, and inside leg (applying pressure with your calf).  Do not DO NOT clench your arm.  Take up more contact by moving to a medium level of contact (contact, but still a little loop in the rein) once your horse has begun to push her back up and go on the bit.  <br>  <br>  All this being said, it's important that you do this with the instruction of a trainer because you could be making any number of mistakes while attempting these that could make your pony not respond in the way you desire.  Without watching you in person and being able to give you real time critique and feedback on your riding, I can't guarantee that you'll achieve either of these.<br>  <br>  Just remember that subtlety is key for both of these. And be sure to ask your trainer to work with you on these two elements in your next lessons.|`|qoL7LTIUaa	whatever you do stay center in the saddle. shifting your wait is a common mistake and will cause your horse to be off balance making it physically impossible to swap out cuz he is not balanced. once you and your horse are totally straight and he is looking straight and  you are riding on a diagonal line hold your reins tight and kind of raise his head an give out a big kick  on your new outside leg. if it doesn't work start carrying a crop and right AFTER you kick him crop him with your new inside hand. <br>      if this doesn't work or you are getting frustrated go back to the basics and work with simple lead changes that consist of breaking and then picking up the opposite lead. as long as after he breaks he picks up your new lead then you are fine. this is also to be done on a diagonal. this will not only renew the concept for him and help him understand what you are asking it will also help you out.<br>  never let him get fast through your lead changes and this is another reason why it is important to hold your reins tight along with keeping him balance.<br>  <br>  remember not to lean and if he starts getting fast go back to simple leads unless it is after you crop him then its understandable but you still shouldn't allow him to always speed up<br>  good luck and ik that ponies sometimes have an attitude. be consistant and maybe have someone else try it on him|`|K4bJgTF4aa	for the bit....chew with your inside fingers and keep contact with your outside rein.  keep contact with your legs.  <br>  for the flying lead changes....canter then when you want to change do a simple lead change with either a walk or a trot transition where the change should be.  then once your pony is doing good with that...start the canter and when you want to change push with your outside leg to your inside rein then shift your body weight to the opposite direction.  i know it sounds highly confusing, but it is easier on the horse.  good luck.

Clean it GOOD (a mild bleach solution that is well washed away after is a good idea if you can) and that should eliminate the smell.  Next time you find a random turd, put it in her litterbox, don't correct her, just show her you putting it in the box.  Move the litter box closer to where she has been pooing, then slowly (VERY slowly) move it back to the place you want.  It is going to take some patience, but it will work.  Do NOT give your poor pet away because of this, she can learn.  <br>  <br>  Also, make sure your litter box is clean.  Is she an only cat?  It could be a territory thing.

It could also mean that he could use a good petting, but either way, it means he loves you ;)|`|661b6942f6dddce43fe2dcb16a5f0068aa	He's looking for attention from you.|`|F8zjiOJ4aa	heres if it rubs ur leg lol Partly to make friendly physical contact with you, but there is more to it than that. The cat usually starts by pressing against you with the top of its head or the side of its face, then rubs all along its flank and finally may slightly twine its tail around you. After this, it looks up and then repeats the process, sometimes several times. If you reach down and stroke the animal, it increases its rubbing, often pushing the side of its mouth against your hand, or nudging upward with the top of its head. Then eventually it wanders off, its greeting ritual complete, sits down, and washes its flank fur. <br>  <br>  All of these elements have special meanings. Essentially what the cat is doing is implementing a scent exchange between you and it. There are special scent glands on the temples and at the gape of the mouth. Another is situated at the root of the tail. Without you realizing it, your cat has marked you with its scent from these glands. The feline fragrances are too delicate for our crude noses, but it is important that friendly members of the cat's family should be sharing scents in this way. This makes the cat feel more at home with its human companions. And it is important, too, for the cat to read our scent signals. This is achieved by the flank-rubbing element of the greeting followed by the cat sitting down and "tasting" us with its tongue-through the simple process of licking the fur it has just rubbed so carefully against us.|`|3O6CTb3saa	Hi the kitty is saying it wants affection and to be petted.

If the kitten is born that way and you are right there you immediately want to turn him upside down for few seconds to rid of the fluid in his lungs try to wipe out his little mouth and nose as good as you can.  If he is not breathing and you feel comfortable breathing into his nose and mouth breathe very gently over mouth and nose.  The most important thing to remember is that their lungs tend to get fluid backed up in there and there is a chance of them not making it.   This depends on how long they are taking to be born.   Usually kittens pop out pretty fast. They do have a chance of pneumonia.  If it is born at home and alive it is best to take it to a vet so they can see if it's going to be okay or not.  Sometimes animals that are born breech don't make it and some do.  Kittens tend to have a better chance than baby calves.  If this kitten is in the process of being born and you are to far away from a vet you can put on some rubber gloves and pull on the little feet and help them to come out.  Cats sometimes have them either direction head first or otherwise.|`|oDVx7nSxaa	Take them to the vet - immediatly.

wLgGD63raa	The publisher of Breaking Dawn is Little, Brown Young Readers and the publishing date is August 2, 2008. I have looked and looked and looked, but I have not found -anything- that says who did the cover art, but according to an interview she did with Entertainment Weekly, Stephanie Meyer did help to design the cover. So, it was most likely done on a computer, and no one actually took a picture of anything. <br>  <br>  Also, if you don't know the meaning behind the cover, here is the explanation for that as well:<br>  <br>  "Breaking Dawn's cover is a metaphor for Bella's progression throughout the entire saga. She began as the weakest (at least physically, when compared to vampires and werewolves) player on the board: the pawn. She ended as the strongest: the queen. In the end, it's Bella that brings about the win for the Cullens."<br>  <br>  As far as the game idea goes, you could do a trivia game or something like a "Who Said This '-enter quote here-'" quote game, and give out small pieces of candy for correct answers. Then of course, you'd give everyone else a piece of candy for their effort and to make them feel as though they were not left out. You could have everyone each make up their own short story about vampires, make it a contest, choose a winner, and give a small prize. You could do anything, really. I'm sure there are plenty of websites out there that have nice ideas for fun games and things to do for a book like this one.<br>  <br>  I hope I helped. Good luck. =)<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: I actually went to Walmart tonight and decided to look at the inside cover of Breaking Dawn out of curiosity to see if it named who did the cover art. I got lucky, and the information was there! The cover's design was done by Gail Doobinin, and the photo was taken by Roger Hagadone. <br>  <br>  I hope this helped a bit more. =)|`|8oHlIrLOaa	I dont know who the publisher is, but I was thinking a cute game idea would be to take a chess board, and  print off a bunch of questions about the book and put them on the chess board and like play regular chess but to jump someone or something they have to answer one of the question that they are on! Good luck. I love Breaking Dawn(:
KEYgd73saa	The Rosy Barbs aren't your problem-- they're actually quite docile.  The Dwarf Gouramis, however, are going to be a bit of an issue.  They are closely related to Bettas, and both species will exhibit considerable territorial behavior when housed together, generally leading to the Betta getting beaten up due to their ridiculously long fins, which are impediments.  Instead of a Betta, consider getting 2-3 more Rosy Barbs, and maybe a few male Guppies or a couple male Platies.  Avoid females, as they are often pregnant upon purchase, and will quickly overpopulate a tank with fry.|`|7guIba8paa	the betta will b torn 2 shreds add 2more barbs 2 control the bullying <br>  edit: nice 1 i got a thumbs down, u could of said, ur tank is far 2small|`|szzoxJRBaa	no. bettas can typically mesh with other fish, but dwarf gouramis and bettas are in the same family and they will actually fight. and if the barbs are full grown they will actually pick on the betta.  i found this out through personal experience.  its a bad idea. ;-)<br>  <br>  you could add more gouramis, angelfish, barbs, larger tetra, or mild mannered cichlids. also, loaches, cat fish, or plecos.<br>  <br>  Provide your rosy barb with some tank mates. Like most other barbs, it is a schooling species and is best kept in a group of five or more of its own species. They swim in the middle level of the tank.

FVWvN07xaa	I have a dachshund and she does the same thing.. all theee time.<br>  Its for attention cause as soon as you give them it it stops, i suggest you take him to obedience classes just to ask the trainer for advice on how to stop him whining.<br>  <br>  good luckkk|`|Fpi8im9taa	Dachshunds usually whine for your attention -- I seriously doubt he whines "because he knows it pisses us off". Dogs aren't capable of doing an action for the sole purpose of making their owners mad; they just do the action and suffer the consequences (good or bad).<br>  <br>  The best thing, and this sounds very contradictory, is ignore him when he whines. If you give him attention (pet him, pick him up, or even just look at him), he'll associate whining with getting the attention that he wants. Whining works, after all.<br>  <br>  Check to see if your dog is suffering from separation anxiety. If possible, monitor your dog when you go out to see what he does. Does he bark, whine, or in the case of my dachshund, howl (like a wolf! How strange is that!)? In that situation, you should make your coming and going unemotional. Don't give him any attention when you leave (so he won't start thinking, "No, he's starting to leave now! I want this attention now!") and ESPECIALLY don't give him any attention when you come home. Wait to praise him when he's calmed down a bit, so he'll start associating his calmness with getting the attention that he wants.<br>  <br>  In fact, that's the best thing you can do for your dog: Wait until he's calm to give him attention. You'll have to be EXTREMELY (and I really can't stress this enough) patient with your dachshund, because they are extremely stubborn animals. They'll want to do it their way as often as possible. It'll take a long time (took a long time with us) to get your dog's separation anxiety to lessen, but just be patient! Nothing's a quick fix when it comes to a dachshund.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Oh, I see you're the physical type. Just ignore what I said, then, since you really want a quick fix.<br>  <br>  What I do (non-physically) is everytime my dachshund starts whining, get a shoe or something and slap it against some metal chair or against a pile of plastic bags. This startles him to the point that he won't whine anymore.<br>  <br>  But whatever, your dog is your own. Treat him how you wish.|`|AA10500537	get a spray bottle and when he whines spray it a bit and it will quit|`|RehgySLCaa	Don't acknowledge him when he whines.

You'll learn that breeding a dog before it's two and health tested is a very bad choice to make.

Go to:<br>  www.thepetcenter.com/gen/kenc.html<br>  Kennel Cough in dogs will stimulate a coarse, dry, hacking cough about three to seven days after the dog is initially infected.  It sounds as if the dog needs to "clear it's throat" and the cough will be triggered by any extra activity. Many dogs that acquire Kennel Cough will cough every few minutes, all day long.  Their general state of health and alertness will be unaffected, they usually have no rise in temperature, and do not lose their appetite.  The signs of Canine Cough usually will last from 7 to 21 days and can be very annoying for the dog and the dog's owners.  Life threatening cases of Kennel Cough are extremely rare and a vast majority of dogs that acquire the infection will recover on their own with no medication.  Cough suppressants and occasionally antibiotics are the usual treatment selections. as for distemper, go to: www.marvistavet.com/html/body_canine_dis...<br>  The typical distemper suspect is a rescue or pet store dog or puppy, usually with questionable vaccination history or an as yet incomplete vaccination series. The dog or puppy has been housed with other rescue dogs.  Symptoms begin with:<br>  <br>  Gooey eye and nose discharge<br>    <br>  Fever (which often comes and goes unnoticed)<br>    <br>  Poor Appetite<br>    <br>  Coughing and the development of pneumonia <br>  The virus is attacking interfaces of the body with the environment (the “mucous membranes”) and starts with the respiratory tract, hence the pneumonia, but it does not stop there. The virus moves on to produce:<br>  <br>  Vomiting and Diarrhea<br>    <br>  Callusing of the nose and foot pads (hence one of the old names for distemper – “hard pad disease”) <br>  After completing what is called the “mucosal phase” of infection where environmental interfaces are attacked (as described by the above GI and respiratory disease), the virus proceeds to the central nervous system for its “neurologic phase” leading to:<br>  <br>  Seizures (classically starting with snapping or tremoring of the jaws which progress to convulsions of the whole body. This distemper classic sign is called a “chewing gum fit.”)  Seizures are not the only distemper sign by any means. Tremors, imbalance,  and limb weakness all may occur.  Signs may progress to death or may become non-progressive and permanent. Recovery is also possible. <br>  This means that the dog appears to recover only to break with neurologic disease 1-3 weeks later. Younger puppies or individuals with weak immunity oft|`|NAGiNKFWaa	Well kennel cough is air borne, and can clearly take a week or more to recover from.  It is odd that the older dog got it, assuming that it had been up on its shots, and kennel cough.  I didn't think it was fatal, but I am not a vet, and you are right, there could be other issues there like distemper to deal with.  It would be a kind gesture for you to pay their vet bills, but that is only if you thought it was the right thing to do.

He was a very social animal, both with other dogs, and people.  Sadly he passed away from a blood disorder at 6 years of age.  We still miss him.|`|e1z8pHfmaa	I have never met a Pyrenees that was terribly aggressive.  Seems to me that they have the confidence that many large breeds have... and they will look at smaller, louder, or more aggressive dogs with that, " Are you kidding me.... you think that scares me??" ... kind of look and attitude.<br>  <br>  They  can be a little standoffish and LOUD with strangers.... but that is primarily because they are very protective by nature.<br>  <br>  My understanding of the breed (from a friend who owns them) was that they were originally bred to be protection dogs for flocks of sheep.  They would be raised with lambs and when old enough they would be turned out with the flock and would protect the sheep to the death if need be.<br>  <br>  Don't know if they would form that strong of a bond after they are already adult dogs but my friend's Pyrenees are both very watchful over his kids.  I have bever seen them attempt to bite.... but I have seen their reaction when a stranger approaches... they put themselves between their "flock" and the stranger until the stranger's intention is clear.<br>  <br>  They are GREAT dogs as far as I have seen... they eat plenty and they are very very hairy... they are kind of the definition of an "outdoor" dog...large and heavy shedders because that heavy coat was bred to protect them without much shelter... but they are phenomenal dogs.|`|stCyrS4Eaa	You can always start the application and meet with that dog a few times. Bring family members to meet her too to see how she is with a variety of people. Take her for a walk at the shelter. Ask them to bring some other dogs out while you walk to see how she acts with them.<br>  <br>  Read up on the breed. Be prepared for good brisk walks every day. Enrolling in a class would be good to train her and get to know her better too. I had had wonderful luck with shelter dogs. They seem to know that you have saved them, or that they have saved you!|`|veDvtYhJaa	I have 2 pyrs and an Aussie cross.<br>  Pyrs are not aggressive, so long as the owner learns how to be a good, strong alpha pack leader.  Anatolians tend to be aggressive.  They are guardians who's primary method is to attack the predator or intruder.  Pyrs, on the other hand, are more gentle guardians.  They guard by intimidation.  They do pre-emptive barking to scare predators and intruders and tell them "stay away" so they don't have to fight he intruder.  <br>  <br>  You have to teach your dog  which dogs you accept and which people you accept by how you introduce them to your dogs, and how you treat these people and dogs.  My dogs were socialized to humans, so they accept all humans that are not interested in threatening or harming me.  I never trained them to accept other dog, and so am now doing so as the dogs are 5 and 6 going on 6 and 7 and we have renters with three dogs (2 pyrs & a rat)<br>  <br>  You not only have never had a pyr; you still need to do more reading on them.  PLEASE join our Yahoo pyr group so you can ask all the questions you need to. <br>  <br>  A pyr would be a perfect companion for you.  They ARE beautiful.  but they DO shed.  They are wonderful, intelligent companions, but they are not for everybody.  While they are primarily livestock guardians, if you do not have livestock, they guard the members of the family (pack) including cats, pet rabits, etc. etc.<br>  <br>  I think you'd be happy with a pyr.  But you need a group where you can ask a lot more questions and get answers ONLY from those who have pyrs and know what they are talking about.  -!-|`|AA11616741	Pyrs are not aggressive unless another dog would be aggressive to them. When I take my pyr for walks and another dog comes up to check her out, she's fine. If the other dog comes up growling, she growls back because she is protecting you. They will let anyone and anything come in your house and near you as long as they aren't a threat to you. If someone or something tries to threaten you, the pyr will  be there!|`|UoVfRyAUaa	I have owned two pyrs, one male and one female.  Neither have been aggressive.  If you have other dogs, they tend to do better with a male-female mix rather than having both be of the same sex.  Research the breed.  They tend to shed, bark and drool but have few health problems.  Note that they also tend to be nocturnal.  If any of these characteristics are a problem for you, rethink your decision.  I love my pyrs!!!!!!|`|cO5m6Eqnaa	I've not known that many but never known one to be aggressive. They can be lively and they are strong. The cold won't bother him. Brushing and coat-shedding will be time-consuming. As he's an adult, I'd check what the shelter staff have found him to be like with other dogs just as a safeguard.|`|LURQBU86aa	Every pyr that I've ever come into contact with was an absolute sweetheart. I worked at a dog boarding kennel and we have several that would come in and they all were in doggie daycare playing with the other dogs.|`|LywVUxsTaa	They are generally very gentle.  They were bred to guard sheep.  They have been known to guard children too!
