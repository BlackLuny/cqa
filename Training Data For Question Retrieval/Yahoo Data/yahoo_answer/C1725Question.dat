In the newspaper article, they said he had intent to split the weed up into 5 gram bags and to sell them off to 25 of the local youth. Isn't that more of an opinion then a fact? They also said the passenger in the car was being charged also, but he isn't. He didn't get into any trouble. Isn't there some laws against posting opinions, and false information in a newspaper?

As the row continues about the disabled CBeebies presenter one of CE's most prolific users decides that children should only be "exposed" to disability at an appropriate age.

20090223115612AAGyf2z	News & Events;Current Events	If your kid had a problem at school would you go to the press and expose your kidâ€²s class to public scrutiny?	We see these stories in the media all of the time .      A child has a problem at school and the parents go the Daily Mail.    They give their side of the story and allow the school to be publicly named and their child photographed.      Schools and teachers are not allowed to comment. If the school has taken a different line to the parents is it usually for a damned good reason.       But my question is .....Would YOU go to the press with a story about your child and allow your child to be plastered all over the media?

20090223113520AAHgdJT	News & Events;Current Events	Should the government be allowed to.....?	I have read many questions on Yahoo Answers pertaining to same sex marriage, and the government bind.       So here is my questions: Should the government be allowed to choose who marries who?          Churches have given their opinion and so has the government. But if you look at history, people have been in same sex relationships far before the democratic governing system was established. So what makes the United State so "special" that they can dictate who loves who. Honestly! I have no problem with the "gay" community, in fact I highly support that, mostly because I have several friends who are and a few cousins who are. I think that it should be up to the individual who they want to spend their life with as a partner!!!!!!!
20090223120849AAkg8ZE	News & Events;Current Events	How do you feel about that woman in California who had octuplets?	I think she's a lazy hypocrite. She said she can afford them, but shes on welfare, living at her parents', her husband is in Iraq, AND already has six kids! Don't you go to fertility treatments if you can't have kids? Or having a difficult time having kids? And even then, you usually have one or two, not 14...it annoys me, because I know people who have many children and they work their *** off, and shes sitting around with fourteen kids and not doing anything! And again, its okay for people to go on welfare, but not cause you got 14 kids, cause if your on welfare, you stop having kids until you can pay for the ones you have, not have MORE.    Sorry, I needed to vent, that truly made me mad.

Does anyone who lives in Thanet know very much about the Northdown Hill area of Broadstairs, more accurately St Peters?      What is it like around there, is it peaceful and neighbourly or are the anti social behaviour issues and crime in the surrounding roads?      I read on upmystreet that the northern area of St Peters is considered a 'lower class' area whereas literally down the road in Broadstairs is considered a 'middle class area'.   Why the difference?      Thanks

20090223124316AAWRSpg	News & Events;Media & Journalism	The Guardian Weekly vs The Economist?	I'm Korean and I used to subscribe to The Guardian Weekly and The Economist.   But now the subscription of both weekly newspapers has expired.   Frankly, I haven't had enough time to read both of them in a week, because I have to concentrate on work in my office.   So, I'd like to choose just one of them.   Correct me if i'm wrong, but I think The Guardian Weekly has rather a left-wing point of vew and reveals the unfairness and problems around the world, while The Economist has a more conservative standpoint on the global politics and economy.   I myself prefer to The Guardian Weekly, though I have to read it past a week, because there's no branch office of that weekly paper in Korea and it's only available from England by airmail.   On the other hand, we can easily buy The economist from some newsstands in the Underground stations or big bookshops.   And it doesn't take long to get each week's edition from the nearest branch office.   How would you rate the two British weekly papers?   I mean, the contents and the quality of the two.   What would you choose between them, if you were me?

Today, Mr Limbaugh said something brilliant about wit and brevity, unfortunately I was driving and did not get a chance to jot it down.       On the East Coast it would have been heard between 2:10 and 2:40 in the afternoon.      It's pretty important for me, at this moment, to access the quote; I believe it will be extremely useful for me in a giant assignment I am working on involving Dostoevsky and Machado de Assis.         BTW: no need to bash Rush, what it was about/who he is doesn't matter, regarding my question. As a fan I will totally admit to the irony involved in what he said (while at the same time agreeing with him, based on the context).

Even they are just expecting the Pals to just die.      Why?      And please don't try and claim the Arab nations are supporting the Pals. The whole world can clearly see they are not. The pals are the redheaded stepchild of the Arab world. They just want them gone so they can move on.

Israeli forces used white phosphorus and other weapons supplied by the United States, killing hundreds of civilians and destroying homes, the group said.      The use of white phosphorus is restricted under international law. In the early days of the Gaza conflict, the Israel Defense Forces denied using the ordnance. But later, Israeli officials said only that any shells fired in Gaza were "in accordance with international law."      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^    http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/meast/02/2...
