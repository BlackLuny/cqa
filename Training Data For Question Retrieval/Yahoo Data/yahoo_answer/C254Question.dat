Her talent is actually being able to mix up some synthesized beats, and I suppose having her "original looks". Her voice is just average but not that great cos I've definitely heard better. Plus what's with the wigs??? Do you think she's really that good- talent-wise? Really? And people are talking about how Christina copied Lady Gaga or vice versa... anyone can have straight blonde hair and dark eyeliner- that doesn't mean they're "copying" anyone else... O_o

AND HE'S NOT EVEN SAYING SOMETHING DIFFERENT! the same phrase for 10 mins.    rock-they rule. they get the audience involved and let them sing some lyrics. rockers headbang. Rappers do the f ing grind! mosh pits. the singer does cool stuff with the stand.the guitarist has a solo. the only thing close to that in rap is when the singer says a different word.and they dont sing about sex and discreminate against women. ROCK IS CLEARLY BETTER!!!!!!!!!    Any one wanna say something in raps defense?

20090205155607AAZEzgN	Entertainment & Music;Movies	The name of two movies?	I'm trying to find two movies but cannot remember their titles. The first I saw back in the 1980s, when I was a kid. It is a film about people who are attacked by animals. Something happens to the animals and they start attacking--Rats, dogs, wild cats, all sorts of animals. I recall very little from the film. I think at the end there is a raft with one or a few survivors.      The other movie I remember seeing in the 90s on TNT. It is a 3 part movie that deals with the supernatural. One part is about three friends who teased a guy into a fatal accident. His mom is a witch and places a curse on them. She says "listen carefully, you. Seven times around go the three of you. One by land, two by air..." The second part is about a man who picks up a girl hitchhiking by a bridge. He picks her up and takes her home. Apparently the girl was a ghost. The third part is about a scary growling kind of noise that comes out of a hole. This takes place out in the country. A group of men get together and one man volunteers to go in looking for his son ( I believe) and he comes out and is crazy--because of what he saw. Can anyone help? Thank you.

She dumped me because she was bored and thought the relationship was dead, but she still has feelings for me...Anyways, she wants to still be friends with me, but i have yet to give her an answer. I've decided to not answer her calls and texts back. She recently posted lyrics on her facebook that are from a band we like called opeth, which read:         The rain was waving goodbye, and when the night came   the forest folded its branches around me.   Something passed by, and I went into a dream.   She laughing and weeping at once: "take me away".      I don't know how or why, I'll never know WHEN."      What do they mean?

20090205160141AAJWtbH	Entertainment & Music;Movies	1970s movie centering around car crash in California?	I think this was a made for tv movie.  It started off showing the car crash, or at least a part of it, within the first few minutes.  Then it goes back in time to "develop" all the characters involved.  By the end, I believe the storyline is a couple broke up, and one of them is on the highway driving away.  Then at the last second, s/he decides to take the off ramp, cuts across 5 lanes of traffic, causing the climax to the movie.  I want to say the title is something like "Crash on Interstate 97".  I remember it as a typical 70s made-for-tv fluff movie...

I asked this question few days ago....      ''I know this guy through my family from years ago, we were friends until two years ago, we were both in relationships, soon after that I had a car accident and my world fell around me I weighed 180 lb at the time, I gradually started to gain lost of weight (medication/depression, I mean 70lb (35kg)      anyway he got in touch with me again and we have been talking again, and he wants to meet, he says he loves me, and I'm this huge girl with a scar on her face, I wasn't even slim to start with, I want to meet him, But I don't think rejection will help (since I'm recovering from depression caused by the accident) I told him what happened, told him I gained weight, he said he doesn't care, he saw (My face) on the cam as well, But then again the weight is not on my face, Please tell me what to do? He wants to meet, I do too, But, I hate myself for being so fat (288lb) and it's stopping me living.''      Now I met him, he said he loves me, and help me, we even talked about sex, I asked him if he would wait, he said he'd wait as long as I want      He was perfect, and much better looking than I expected, My question is, what if he's doing all this out of pity? should I break up with him and say I need to concentrate on getting my life back together?      I'm a Capricorn

In case no one noticed, the alternate ending to the new Hulk is the lead up to Captain America, which will be amazing. The ending to Iron Man was also a hint towards the Ultimate Alliance movie, I personally want to see The Flash, Ryan Reynolds would be great. What do you want to see?

20070527005154AANOXlq	Entertainment & Music;Comics & Animation	BATMAN'S DEAD: Anyone Counting On Tim Drake?	Batman comics have been crashing down hill since the No Mans Land story arc.  This isn't to say they have  all been miserably devoid of creativity, intrigue and ingenuity.  It just seems Batman (comics) are caught in a struggle.  Anybody else feel that DC is struggling with the substance batman comics?      Personally I think Bruce needs to retire and Tim needs to take on the cape and cowl.  Sorry I can't see Dick as Batman.  Tim is driven, a volunteer in the Bat Family, with detective skills and a tactical prowess that is on parr with Bruce.  Bruce is getting older and he has these successors in the wings, for what purpose?  In the near future I'd like to see Tim evolve into Batman, as Bruce forced into retirement.  Batman will truly die if Bruce takes a swim in a Lazarus pit.  I think this is a weak scenario, Bruce restored in a Lazarus pit.  So I say, lets get the cape and cowl on Tim.      Is DC butchering Batman and should Bruce be replaced?

20070402220306AACN50c	Entertainment & Music;Celebrities	Do you think Beyonce Knowles will become an icon?	Beyonce stated on Larry King Live that her focus now is to become an icon or legend like Diana Ross (the original diva) and Tina Turner (the crowd pleaser and engergizer bunny).  She also stated in another interview that she wants to be a major superstar like Michael Jackson (king of music videos/top selling album of all time).  These are some big shoes to fill.      She is doing her thing right now, but in my opinion, she will never be in the same league as these people.  She is just an it girl and very popular because of her good looks and image.  She is not a ground breaking or original artist.        Todays popular artist are just copying the styles of artist from the 50's, 60's, 70's & 80's.  No originality.  It's just not the same.

20070416023841AAYKT1e	Entertainment & Music;Other - Entertainment	Quelle était l'émission radio de Pierre Desgraupes vers 1981, il interviewait un mysterieux aventurier?	Je me rappelle d'une émission de radio quotidienne un été (en 1981 ou 1980?) sur France Inter ou Europe n°1, vers 14h. Pierre Desgraupes (je crois) interviewait un personnage incroyable et mystèrieux (vieux et anonyme) qui prétendait avoir été présent dans l'ombre de tous les grands évennements depuis 50 ans: le vol de la joconde, le trésor des nazis, l'affaire truc et l'affaire machin... J'imagine que cette personne était un mythomane, car ses énormes révélations étaient trop grosses pour être vraies. J'aimerais échanger avec quelqu'un qui en garde un souvenir plus précis pour recouper date, nom de l'émission, etc... et, pourquoi pas, trouver quelqu'un qui l'aurait enregistré. Je suis prêt à demander l'émission à l'INA si j'arrive à avoir + de détails.

20070420230539AAxk4SF	Entertainment & Music;Celebrities	Who is uglier Renee Zellweger, Victoria Beckham or Myleene Klass?	Renee Zellweger tops the list for "can't even bear to look at" - those beady eyes, chipmunk face and scrunched up "just drank a litre of lemon juice look". If the devil had a child, that's what it would look like. And Victoria Beckham, euw - oink oink, where's Kermit the frog? I actually think Miss Piggy is better looking than her at least Miss Piggy doesn't look as if she just walked out of a science lab! Myleene Klass - annoying - not as bad as the last two, but definately odd looking.

20070429230649AAghbqP	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Are you truly sick of movies like "Freedom Writers"?	After just finally seeing the movie Freedom Writers I have to ask who is truly sick of movies of this type.  I read a couple of questions that were old on Yahoo pertaining to this movie and the answers bothered me.  When you turn on the TV and all you see is war, famine and people complaining about the direction in thier lives isn't it truly refreshing to see someone doing something about it?  Sure its another ghetto teacher story plotline we're all familiar with.  But its still a TRUE ghetto/teacher story where the end result is inspiring.  I say A+ to the Freedom Writers for thier accomplishements, not just as students, but as people.

In other news, according to LiveScience.com (livescience.com - Thu Feb 5, 4:27 am ET) a certain sad fat cat, caught lying about her age, was picked up for passing around a bong-thingy in the Steelers locker room. After her arrest and release, and having no proof of the Steelers being the fathers of her 14 children, she became so distraught that she beat and pulled out the hair of her sister at her wedding. Authorities claim the body of the cat was found face down in an upside down pineapple cake, with 89 candles in it. A half chewed, 3 foot, Hillshire Farms summer sausage was thought to be the murder weapon.      Full story:    http://news.yahoo.com/s/livescience/2009...

Hello :)  I was just wondering if anyone know what the song was on the advert for The Independent newspaper.  It's classical, and the part that is on the advert is all piano music.   I think it's the only advert that's running on TV (In England) for The Independent at the moment... I've seen it about 3 times today.  I know this is really vague, but if anyone knows I'd really appreciate it.  Thank you :)

20090205095213AApKkVP	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	R&P Friends, Contacts & random strangers- Can you lend me your knowledge?	I'm trying to find some Trip-Hop bands/groups/artists that have slipped through the cracks. If you're not fan of Trip-Hop, would you at least donate a star to the Help a Brotha Out Foundation? I'll edit in links to some Trip-Hop, after the question gets "approved", in case you're not sure if you even know what Trip-Hop is.       I'm pretty liberal in my own definition, so feel free to suggest anything you think might fit. Chill-Out, Drum-n-Bass, etc.      Anyways, here's some artists you can scratch off your list, as I already have them:   Portishead   Massive Attack   Tricky   Morcheeba   Lamb   Baby Namboos   U.N.K.L.E.   Archive   De-Phazz   Pepe Deluxe      So, R&P, what ya got for me? Links are always appreciated!

The title of the website would therefore rather aptly be "inter-breeding.com".      Should I pursue this idea?

20090205105218AANIJCd	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Poll: Name a T.V theme song that is annoying or irrelevant *every answer gets thumbs up!?	Sometimes I hear a theme song to a T.V show and I wonder "What are they thinking, that's so dumb?" I am sure everyone can think of a show song or two that bugs the heck out of them. Some songs have nothing to do with the show and some are just plain stupid. List your songs and say why you hate them if you wish. Here is my contribution.      Malcom in the Middle song.    The tune is alright but the words don't make any sense. "yes, no, maybe, I don't know, your not the boss of me now" what the hell are they talking about?      Corner Gas song when the credits roll   "I don't know, yes you do, you just won't admit it"   Again what are they talking about and what does it have to do with a gas station lol.      I can't wait for your songs, I will give a thumbs up for every answer and a best answer for the most annoying song.

20090204215221AAmRKLm	Entertainment & Music;Comics & Animation	Iron-Man's Various Suits?	I can't seem to find any good answers on google. I know in the old tv series of Iron-Man he used a lot of suits. I am sure in future movies he will too. I know of Warmachine armor being his first, he then made ironman and gave WM to Rhodey. I was wondering if anyone can list the suits, the names, and the design/color scheme?      Known suits;   Iron-Man Yellow and Red   War Machine   Hulk Armor   Space Armor      That's all I know. Then I know a variety of villains stole his suits, like titanium man. But was that the suits original design and he stole it, or did he just copy the tech?

I broke up with my boyfriend not so long ago and like 2 days after we officially broke up, he was at the dance having a makeout grope-fest with another girl. He's sent me numerous notes saying he was "looking for solace" and all this other bull$hit. He's begging for me to take him back. I'm wondering if it's normal for guys to find comfort in other girls right after they break up with the girl they "love" so much. What's up with that???

Just in case you didnt know...they work with the animals in labs and ensure that they are being fed right and that they get good enrichment.

If there wernt any around then animals in labs would be in bad consitions and they would be even worsde off than they are now. But that is just my opinion.    What do you think of them?

20080321235206AA1Vyci	Entertainment & Music;Television;Reality Television	A Gyselle vai ganhar 1 milh?o por causa da ajuda de sites e blogs do Brasil e Europa. Vc concorda com isso???	... Ela participou de um reality show na Fran?a q em Português chama-se Ilha da Tenta??o onde ela tinha que seduzir homens casados e fazê-los se separar das esposas. Na primeira semana ela conseguiu fzer o cara se separar, iludiu o cara, disse mil e uma coisa, e depois da separa??o ela disse q era uma brincadeira. Ela venceu o programa e isso s fez ter muitos f?s já que ela é muito bonita. Acontece que vasculhando o yahoo da fran?a, vi vários sites falando dela no BBB inclusive o pessoal da Fran?a, Itália e Suí?a acompanham as noptícias e têm até links para votar nela. Assim fica muito fácil, pois a Globo deveria colocar os brother igualmente no anonimato. é a mesma coisa de colocar a Ivete Sangalo mais 13 participantes an?nimos, quem venceria? Foi assim que ela entrou no programa, tanto é que no vídeo de inscri??o dela no site ela cita vários sites  e blogs do Brasil e exterior. Isso explica pq ela ganha desde o 1o pared?o e vem se mantendo msm sendo t?o fria, anti-social e mal educad

But does this include Walt? Walt just kind of disappeared. Did everyone forget that he's saved and living somewhere off in the world? Wouldn't he have to be with them as well to get back to the island. I mean, Baby Aaron is included in the group to get back, how come Walt isn't? Is it because he's not officially apart of the Oceanic 6?     Ben isn't apart of the Oceanic 6, so he's not needed to get back either. It makes sense to me if Walt was needed with the group to get back to the island. How can a character that still living just be forgotten like that?

We've been talking about it in History class and we got to see a trailer for it and talk about the book and stuff (but we're probably not gonna be able to see the movie).

But I really wanna see this one, and I want to know if it's gory or not. I already know that there are parts in the movie where people get shot, but what I'm talking about is like "Friday the 13th" or "Saw" gore: people getting attacked with machetes, or getting their heads chopped off, or tortured etc., etc.

Why is Zac Efron's coming out and Tia and Tamara's didn't?   I have some ideas about this, but I'm gonna keep 'em to myself... I'll just say that I don't think it's fair, at all. I just wanna know what other people think about it.

He sat down next to a   blonde at the bar and stared up at the TV.       The 10:00 PM news was coming on. The news crew was covering a story of a   man on a ledge of a large building preparing to jump.       The blonde looked at Bob and said, "Do you think he'll jump?"       Bob says, "You know, I bet he'll jump."       The blonde replied, "Well, I bet he won't."       Bob placed a $20 bill on the bar and said, "You're on!"       Just as the blonde placed her money on the bar, the guy on the ledge did   a swan dive off the building, falling to his death.       The blonde was very upset, but willingly handed her $20 to Bob, saying,   "Fair's fair. Here's your money."       Bob replied, "I can't take your money, I saw this earlier on the 5 PM   news and so I knew he would jump."       The blonde replied, "I did too; but I didn't think he'd do it again."       Bob took the money...               tell me some funny jokes...easy 10 points

Okaay, so for the past 3 or 4 Thursdays and weekends I have been asking my boyfriend 2 days ahead of time if he can hang out. When I do ask him, he always says I dontknow or maybe. Then on Thursday, he says he cant come over because he always goes to his friend's house or something instead. Dont say he is cheating because I know he isnt. Hes just being stubborn, and I think he is still interested in me because at lunch break at school he pays attention to me and stuff. I don't feel like im getting enough attention because now its led to only at school we talk and hang out.

20090205152220AAUgN4j	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Americans Please Be @ Service Will You?	Ok, I hail from Ireland and recently I went to Armenia for Holiday. I met this American lass who is of Armenian descent. Anyways, for the whole 3 weeks I was there she would be there a month and a half, she introduced me to her family and we enjoyed each others company in the hotel and in the ins and outs of the Yerevan limits.      We shared life changing conversations and she the believer of serendipity and fate told me she would want to see me again. This is when we eventually shagged mind have you. But, the catch was that she did not want to exchange numbers and what have you because she wanted our 2nd encounter to be left up to fate.       She told me where in the States she lives, but told me she moved and told me 2 states, so I would know where to go and find her. The states are California and New Jersey. I checked up on them and California seems huge, so it would be inconceivable for us to cross paths there no? New Jersey seems the tiniest of places, so not much people live there, so maybe we can find each other. What should I do and is there anyway I could get her information and what state has more Armenian Americans?

20090203041806AAD8qWE	Entertainment & Music;Horoscopes	Can i get this ARIES back ?	Okay so me and my boyfriend ( now ex) were dating for 5 months, almost 6 months. He was acting weird for almost a week and last night he told me he though it was best if we broke up. He said he still loved me but that I deserved better...and that he doesnt wanna be with me anymore. Our relationship was soo good, we had amazing times together and i really believe we loved each other. Yeah we did have our hard times but we were able to fight for the love we felt. And its like all of a usdden he is done trying. I want to know if it is possible for me to make him realize that it was a mistake and that he should be with me ? Can i get him back ? and if so...how ?   I really care about him, im in love with him and i would do absolutely everything to get him back. For some reason i believe he still wants to be with me....but im not sure. He wants to keep my stuff ( pictures, etc) at his house still. Any tips or comments would be appreciated. thanks alot !!       By the way he is an aries and I am an aquarius (female)   I was born Feb. 12th and he was born April 2nd.    He is 20 and im 18.      Friday night I went over to his house cuz he wanted me to come over so w could talk about the breakup in person. We cried and talked and blah blah. Then he said this " I dont even know what im doing" ( meaning breaking up with me), "im just stupid". I told him that if he did the right thing for himself he shouldnt have to worry, and im willing to go through the pain if its whats best for him. He said " but its not the best for me i think".   So now im confused, but i left his house, and he called me on my way home, and we havent talked since...So i dont know what to make of all this.   Then 2 days later, we talk on the phone for hours, same again with last night. Although we went all saturday without talking.    I want to make him see that breaking up was a mistake...i have a feeling he regrets it but wont admit it.   How can i get this aries back ?

And I liked to take a minute   Just sit right there   I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel Air      In west Philadelphia born and raised   On the playground was where I spent most of my days   Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool   And all shootin some b-ball outside of the school   When a couple of guys   Who were up to no good   Startin making trouble in my neighborhood   I got in one little fight and my mom got scared   She said 'You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel Air'      I begged and pleaded with her day after day   But she packed my suite case and send me on my way   She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket.   I put my walkman on and said, 'I might as well kick it'.      First class, yo this is bad   Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass.   Is this what the people of Bel-Air Living like?   Hmmmmm this might be alright.      But wait I hear there're prissy, wine all that   Is Bel-Air the type of place they send this cool cat?   I don't think sow   I'll see when I get there   I hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel-Air      Well, the plane landed and when I came out   There was a dude who looked like a cop standing there with my name out   I ain't trying to get arrested   I just got here   I sprang with the quickness like lightening, disappeared      I whistled for a cab and when it came near   The license plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror   If anything I can say this cab is rare   But I thought 'Now forget it' - 'Yo homes to Bel Air'      I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8   And I yelled to the cabbie 'Yo homes smell ya later'   I looked at my kingdom   I was finally there   To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel Air

20090205161058AAsb0lc	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Do you ever think it would be easier to just go on welfare?	Times are tough right now and I'm feeling really defeated. I am a social worker that helps everyone attain the services they need and it seems like they have a better life than I do. Someone will come in with nothing and I help sign them up for food stamps, low income housing, free healthcare, free childcare and cash aid. All they have to do is stay poor and at home with their families. This is starting to look very attractive to me. My husband and I both work full time jobs and have only one child. Yet we struggle every month to afford food,gas, bills and a $600 per month childcare bill. It would be easier if we just quit our jobs and filed for all these benefits and stayed home. What do you think about that? Do you ever feel this way?

20090205155829AAbYZSt	Entertainment & Music;Movies	I'm looking for an old movie montage.?	I wish I had more details.  These used to be on Video  Cassetts before the feature film.  The one I remember specifically was a montage about beautiful women in movies.  In the back round the song Take my Breath Away played and at the end of the montage the tag line was, "tonight take home the woman of your dreams"  It was put out by the studio I am sure because it had all kinds of different movies and actresses featured.  I really loved it I thought it was sooooo romantic and I want to find it but I have been looking with google and on You tube and I can't find it anywhere.  I can't remember what movie this preview was before or what studio produced the film so any help I could get would be great.  Thanks so much.

Occasionally, if I add a new band, they'll comment my page with something like "hey, what's up." I don't mean generic comments like "thanks for the add" though. Also.. they're not all that obscure or underground. I'm talking Warped Tour line-up bands.   So is it too good to be true - did they take the time to go to my page and click add comment and type that up? Or is it possible for them to send out mass comments that aren't actually personal?      This seems really trivial, but I'd like to know what your experience is with this. (: Thanks.
