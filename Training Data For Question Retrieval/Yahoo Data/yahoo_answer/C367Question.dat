20090205115150AAlxaYz	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	Which multimeter is better for testing dryer parts and appliances?	I need a multimeter to test dryer parts.  I can't afford a fluke. This is for household use.  However, for the most "bang for the buck" - my needs would be testing household appliances, automotive stuff (that my boyfriend could take advantage of) and/or laptop/computer stuff if I can use it or need it for anything like that just because I've started dabbling and enjoy it.        The Equus 3320 got good reviews on Amazon - but someone said it doesn't test "high range AC current (amps) the description says it measures AC current but doesn't say that the max AC amps it can test is 200mA or .2 amps, not really practical for ANY AC current measurments. You can measure the current of say a 20 watt AC light bulb with this meter. The PC you are using to read this draws about 3.5-4 AMPS or about 3500-4000 milli amps, this meter maxes out at 200 ma.  I bought it for AC amps but can't use it for that. I'll keep it as a back up meter but I have to buy a better meter for AC amps.  "      Will I miss that feature if I'm testing household appliances?  Seems like I would, but not sure.  (Right now I just need to test for continuity and resistance...from what I read...)      This Greenlee multimeter M40    http://www.arizonatools.com/tools/electr...    is on ebay for $20 - $25 or so.  The Greenlee company looks solid.  The multimeter looks durable. (Important in our house.)  I can find no good or bad reviews about the product.  In which case, I'll give it the benefit of the doubt. And I'd prefer to buy something from an Illinois company.       The Equus has autoranging, and the Greenlee doesn't. Which is better? Does autoranging limit you, or is it strictly and advantage to manual dialing?       And no, I can't afford to pay more for a better product.        But I'd like to get a halfway decent multimeter to use around the house and I'd like the most versatile and durable. Household appliances are the priority.       Which you would buy out of the two or is there a comparable one? (I'd prefer to buy from the US.)       Thanks!
