Gabriella Cilmi has claimed that Katy Perry did not deserve to win her Brit Award for best international female.      Perry was presented with the gong at the Earls Court ceremony on Wednesday night, triumphing over Cilmi, Beyoncé, Pink and Santogold.      Aussie singer Cilmi has now expressed shock at the star's victory, suggesting that Beyoncé was the most deserving nominee.

I have been using Wikipedia for most of my information on her, but I have to use multiple sites for this project. So i'm going on to different sites and they are giving me totally different information. For example - on Wikipedia it says that Bessie Smith's first husband was Jack Gee and she left him and later on married someone else, but it doesn't say who it was. And then other websites I am going to, say that Jack Gee was her second husband and she stayed with him, till she died. Usually I trust Wikipedia to have the correct facts, but I don't know now. If any one has anything that can help me on this, please do. Thank you so much. :)

20090222150407AAVesJV	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Whats your fav blonde joke??????( I am a blonde so nothing against anyone lol)?	Two blonde girls were working for the city public works department.      One would dig a hole and the other would follow behind her and fill the hole in.      They worked up one side of the street, then down the other, then moved on to the next street, working furiously all day without rest, one girl digging a hole, the other girl filling it in again.      An onlooker was amazed at their hard work, but couldn’t understand what they were doing.      So he asked the hole digger, ‘I’m impressed by the effort you two are putting into your work, but I don’t get it… why do you dig a hole, only to have your partner follow behind and fill it up again?’      The hole digger wiped her brow and sighed, ‘Well, I suppose it probably looks odd because we’re normally a three-person team.      But today the girl who plants the trees called in sick.’         is mine...... but I just love reading them

20090222153123AAgslxv	Entertainment & Music;Other - Entertainment	Have you ever had anything happen to you that was funny while you were in the hospital as a patient?	Once I had a rare strain of pneumonia and so the hospital put me on a vacant floor in the last room. I was already scared and during the night they sent me a nurse that I called "Egor". Poor thing if rated on looks from 1-10 on a scale he would be a 0.  It didn't help that he was partially paralyzed on one side of his body. It made things difficult for him to do, esp.using a hypodermic needle. :( Imagine the scene;        One dark night at a rural hospital...a defenseless little witness girl laid sleeping...when Egor came dragging himself into her chambers to change the sheets...or did he really come in to get a CUP? (creepy music sounds) dun ta dun. dun ta dun. To make things worse they wanted to go into my lungs and use a scope, etc...to determine what kind of pneumonia I had...as I was about to be released out of the hospital. I simply told them "no thanks". He waited a little too late. I wasn't going to buy him a new RV.      So tell us about your experience. :)

Say examples of flirting (if you must) or something original, like this, that I found out:   If a guy's pupils are larger than normal while he's talking to you, that means that he thinks you're attractive because whenever a person looks at something they like, an unconcious reaction takes over that widens their pupils.      So yeah. Something like that please? Thanks!

This afternoon's choices involve one of the Gothenburg 3 (my favorite of the Gothenburg 3), as well as a lesser known melodic death metal band that I'm typically ranting and raving about. Which do you prefer?       The choices are In Flames's 'Jester Script Transfigured' off of In Flames's (IMO) best album, 'Whoracle'. The second option, the underdog if you will, is Mors Principium Est's epic 'Cleansing Rain'. They are an often overlooked (or maybe still relatively unknown) melodeath band. They are very melodic in nature.      In Flames    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvuCwaoZp...       Mors Principium Est    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMSNgKMBq...

20090222160314AA53xPL	Entertainment & Music;Music;Singing	Too terrified to get a singing coach?	I love singing, I want to get better at it so I was thinking of a singing coach.  However, I don't think I'd be able to do it.  When I'm about to sing, I check all the doors, lock them, make sure no one is home, my phones are off.... In the car I check the trunk, backseat... making sure no one can hear me.   In middle school (quite a while ago) my teacher told me I didn't have a good voice.  I believe it because I had a cold, however that has stuck with me and I can't bring myself to sing.  It drives me nuts, I want to sing so bad in front of someone but I can't.  It just won't come out.  How do people begin to sing in front of people.  I definitely can't in front of my family, at least half of them because my dad is a little too critical, not in a nice honest way either.  Any baby steps I can begin to take?  I hate being so paranoid, it makes me feel like a freak.  (this is the extent of the paranoia btw)

20090222113712AAY3FeK	Entertainment & Music;Television;Comedy	How do you like my sort of comedy story?	Here it is.      My name is Jim Pasterson. I'm just going to give you the story of a random time in 8th grade, with my crush, Allison Liner.      It all started when 8th grade started. I was new and had already made friends. Dorks. Not to be so mean to them though. I always gazed at her beauty. Allison's beauty. When I looked at her it seemed as if we were the only one in the room. Of course then one of her friends would come and talk to her, blocking my view. All I saw was some hair and butt cheeks, since girls these days wore tight pants, Aeropostale, Hollister, American Eagle, etc. Plus Uggs. I still remember the first time she ever spoke to me. It was in math class and my pencil dropped. Then she said "Oh you dropped your pencil." And even the second. I was walking to class then she bumped into me and said,"Sorry." But the third time was the most intense. She came over to me and said, "Hey, do you have the math homework." I responded,"Y-y-yes I-I do." Then she copied it. After that she thanked me and gave me swift slide down my arm. I almost fainted. I pulled my inhalor out and and took some pumps. Well It's the middle of 8th grade. We have our 3rd semester class and she was in my art class, and in my table. I was so happy, that's why I even wrote this story. We talked a whole lot in the days that we had art. I was actually happy to go to school then. We actually became friends, and for the first time, girls didn't think I was some wierdo who still played Pokemon. after the art class, I've been actually stalking her a bit. Then her group of friends would notice and turned from butt cheeks to boobs and said," What do you want?" and from there, my face turned bright red, as a color of a rose. The rose I wanted to give to Allison. But luckily, Allison would turn around and say,"Actually, I know him. I think he's just getting to class and somehow always behind us. Bye Jimmy!" Then her group walked away. I turned around and sprinted to the bathroom and doused my face in water. My face went from rose red to the regular red and peach. One day I followed her to her group of friends. I had the guts to listen what they were talking about. Then Allison's friend who stopped me while I was stalking her and Allison before said, "Ok, seriously will you like stop stalking us. It's really creeping me out. Get lost and go back to your friends. Ugh, if you have any loser." This time, Allison did not bother to help. The other people in the group started to yell and me and to go away. That night at home, I was weeping in bed. I was letting my dreams of her and me going out be carried away by the wind, and never to be seen again. And then of course I straightened myself and had that dream again, saying that I will have a friend who is a girl, not all guys. So the next day at lunch, I was waiting in the lunch line and she came up behind. She asked,"Hey Jimmy, do you have some money I could borrow. I want some lunch." I gave her the money and she talked to me. We had a special conversation that lasted about 30 seconds. We were mostly talking about every day stuff. Then She looked to her left while I was talking and saw her friends. She waved hi to them and said,"Peace Jimmy!" and gave me a slight hug that lasted half a second. Then she ran off the line and to her friends. I looked around to see if anyone was impressed. Instead they were talking to their friends and giving other girls hugs. Hugs that last nearly 5 seconds. Well it's the end of the day and I'm just so happy that I finally got a hug from another girl besides my mommy.

( Move along elsewhere, if you're not into astrology. )      How do you do what it is that you do best?    which is "seeing thro anothers soul and knowing."

There was a guy in a bar one night that got drunk, I mean really, really, really drunk. When the bar closed, he got up to go home.       As he stumbled out the door, he saw a nun walking on the sidewalk.       So he stumbled over to the nun and punched her in the face. Well, the nun was totally surprised, but before she could do or say anything, he punched her again. This time she fell down and he stumbled over to her and kicked her in the butt. Then he picked her up and threw her into a wall.       By this time the nun was pretty weak and couldn't move very much. So then he leaned over her, put his face right next to hers and said;       "Not very f..kin' strong tonight, are you Batman?"

Is it just immaturity, or what? It kind of pisses me off.

Lyrics:      [Robin Thicke talking]   We are at war with the universe, the sky is falling   And the only thing that can save us now   Is sensitivity and compassion      [Singing]   Daa da da, da da da daa da da   Daa da da, da da da daa da da      [Talking]   But I know one thing's for sure   I'm gonna get my kicks before it all burns down      [Lil Wayne]   Yeah   Some say tragedy's hard to get over   But sometimes that tragedy means it's over   Soldier, from the academy league of rollers   I deny being down though they seem to hold us   My, shoulders are strong I prove 'em wrong   I ain't doing nothing but moving on   Let the truth be known   But they talked that freedom at us   And didn't even leave a ladder, damn      [Robin Thicke]   I work at the corner store   We all got problems, problems   No one's gonna fly down low   No one's gonna save us now    How you feel you're not alone   We're all just jealous, jealous   We don't reach the sky no more   We just can't overcome, no      [Chorus: Robin Thicke]   You tie my hands what am I gonna be?   What have I done so bad?   What is my destiny?   You tie my hands what I am I suppose to see?   What have I done so bad?   What am I gonna be?      [Lil Wayne]   I, knock on the door, hope isn't home   Fate's not around the lucks all gone   Don't ask me what's wrong ask me what's right   And I'ma tell you what's life, and did you know?   I lost everything, but I ain't the only the one   First came the hurricane, then the morning sun   Excuse me if I'm on one   And don't trip if I light one, I walk a tight one   They try tell me keep my eyes open   My whole city underwater, some people still floatin'   And they wonder why black people still voting   'Cause your president still choking   Take away the football team, the basketball team   And all we got is me to represent New Orleans, ----   No governor, no help from the mayor   Just a steady beating heart and a wish and a prayer      [Robin Thicke]   These friends they come and go   But I got family, family   These kids so fast they grow   They learn so quickly now   That there's nowhere to go   That there's no future, future   Don't make this here so low   And we can't overcome, no      [Chorus]      [Lil Wayne]   And if you come from under that water then there's fresh air   Just breathe baby God's got a blessing to spare   Yes I know the process is so much stress   But it's the progress that feels the best   'Cause I came from the projects straight to success and you're next   So try they can't steal your pride it's inside   Then find it and keep on grinding   'Cause in every dark cloud there's a silver lining   I know...      [Lil Wayne talking outro]   Yeah, yeah, yeah   See right now we just riding on love   A shot in the dark   We ain't tryin to do nothing but hit the heart   We need love   That's all y'all, that's all      [Chorus x2]      Yeah, Born right here in the USA   But, due to tragedy looked on by the whole world as a refugee   So accept my emotion   Do not take it as an offensive gesture   It's just the epitome of my soul   And I must be me   We got spirit y'all, we got spirit   We got soul y'all, we got soul   They don't want us to see, but we already know

I am 13, in middle school, and I have been working so hard to get a lead in the yearly school musical. I have never been cast as a lead and  I was finally the best auditioner at the spring musical auditions this year. I fit the part better than anyone else who had auditioned and I sang the lead's part really well. Trust me, I was definitely the best... I'm not crazy. But I ended up being cast in the chorus instead, and I was shocked. I later asked the director why she didn't cast me as a better part and she said that she had to look at people's height too, and I was too tall. I don't even think that I am that tall, I am just a couple inches taller than the prince who was cast... and I'm not fat. Does anyone else think that this is not right? I am just so upset... is there like a law that in school activities you can't discriminate? Thanks

So what are your opinions?

20090222121351AAIV8Z2	Entertainment & Music;Celebrities	Sexism in the Chris Brown and Rihanna case- 10 points to best answer?	I keep hearing bullspit in this situation about how Chris Brown is a man and that he should never hit a women, and that he doesn't deserve to have a career after this and that he shouldn't be forgiven.      Am I the only one who thinks this is ridiculously sexist?      Hypothetical situation: What would happen if evidence came out saying that Rihanna started the fight and that Chris Brown reacted to her violence? Would we say that a woman should never hit a man and that she deserves to lose her career and that she should not be forgiven? Or would we be quick to find an excuse for why she hit him? If so, why is it wrong for people to try to find an excuse for Chris Brown's actions?      I want an intelligent and educated response and this can apply to abuse cases in general, not just the Rihanna and Chris Brown case.      It says there are 3 days to answer the question, I'll pick the best answer in about 3 hours.

20090222133908AALZVxd	Entertainment & Music;Music;Other - Music	Am I able to get these two songs as sheet music...?	I play Flute, Piccolo, and Oboe and I just love when bands like Metallica have those concert/orchestra instruments as background music or whatever in their songs.  Along with that....if you do like Metallica, and know what songs I'm talking about....would anybody have any idea where I could (if I can) get sheet music for No Leaf Clover for Oboe.  I love that song, and the oboe part in it.        Also, Seal's Kiss From a Rose....that's one of my all time favorite songs, and I would just absolutely LOVE if I had sheet music for it.  I've tried music stores in books, and looking anywhere and everywhere online, but I can't find it.          Thank you for your help.  :)      P.S.  Flute or Oboe would be fine, but preferably for Oboe...but if you can't find it for Oboe, Flute would work just fine, I can just play it down an octave.  :)

I was watching Harry Potter and The Philosipher's Stone, and when they are  trying to find out about Nicholas Flammel, they've voiced it over so that instead of saying Philosipher's stone, they say Sorcerer's stone. Their mouths still look like they're saying Philosipher's, but they don't. I put the 'Information' on for 'Sky', and it said the film was called Philosipher's stone. It's weird because I saw this today, but two days ago when the film was on, it said philosipher.

On the table there is 3 sets of cards.   Around the table there are 3 chairs.   On the wall there are 2 hooks.   On the floor there is a corpse with no marks on it whatsoever.      How did this person die?      Also, like all riddles you must explain why you came to your conclusion and i will ignore simple answers like   "Suffocated" "Heart Attack" etc.         After 4 pages of replies no-one has got this riddle so clues have been given.      Clue 1 - Where is the room? Think about where it could be. It is not inside a house.      Clue 2 - What were they playing cards for?      Clue 3 - They are in a form of transport.

Examples of bands i like are The King Blues, Of Montreal, Vampire Weekend(oxford comma), brad sucks, And ones who dont just use music by instruments as background sound(like a lot of the stuff topping the charts).       Some other songs i like are: the fear, handlebars, heaven for the weather, outta time, fixing a hole, smiley faces, time to pretend, down in mexico, common people, and others.

20090222135538AAzSL3U	Entertainment & Music;Celebrities	Is it Fair to give attention to Jade Goody?	Hi! I feel sorry with all my heart that she has to go through such a terrible terminal illness knowing that she will no longer be alive. But dont you think that every pesron with terminal illness deserves to get the same treatment. Why is she different from others, We have so many excellent and kind people in this world who cannot afford to pay for their treatment but Jade gets everything she wants. My uncle and my grandparents died from cancer, my granddad died in front of me when i was 13, it was terriblt, i will never forget it. My granddad served his country in World War but when he was diagnosed with cancer noone wanted to know, he had very little help. Is it fair or unfair. I think if one person gets all attention then there should be some sort of way of making other special too, others who might have to go through those illnesses on their own. Thank you for opinion!

20090222135205AADBXJ2	Entertainment & Music;Music;Other - Music	Music for sax at a wedding?	I'm getting married in May and having a small, outdoor wedding. My fiance used to play sax so I thought it might be nice if we could have a sax player for our ceremony. Since it's so small, and we're on a budget, we aren't going to have a whole jazz band, just a sax player. I haven't really seen any weddings done like this before though. Does anyone have any good song suggestions that would sound nice with a sax? We *might* be able to use a cd player so he can have some music to accompany him, but I wouldn't know how to go about that and I'd prefer for it to be just sax, as long as it sounds nice. If it wouldn't really work we might go with a violin instead, but I really like the idea of a sax!

The guy is singing about how he's moved on and how he's got a new wife and all that stuff. Theres an interlude where he has singers in the backround singing and it goes something like this .." Thats what it would be" or "Thats what it to be"and then he sings "I need your love baby!". It sounds like the bee gees or something. It's an all male group. I always catch the song playing inside  a CVS drugstore or an elevator or something. It's a song they play in department stores and stuff. If anyone can help me I would greatly appreciate it. If this helps. i hear the instruments of a piano and drums. Its a great love song but those are the only lyrics I can think of..  backround singers say"Thats what it to be!"  and main singer  singer sings..."I need your love baby!" If i had to guess I would probably say the group is Caucasian.

What international laws are in   place to stop or prevent those abuses?   2. Do you think the violence depicted in the film is necessary to accurately portray the   situation in Sierra Leone in 1999?   3. After the RUF burns Solomon’s village, they chop off the hands of the villagers. What   is the significance of this action? What does it symbolize?   4. The film began and ended in Antwerp, Belgium. How did events in Belgium relate to   events in Sierra Leone?   5. Why did Danny Archer become involved in the conflict diamond trade?   6. In the beginning of the film, all Danny seems to care about is himself. At the end of the   film, however, he is willing to die to protect Solomon. What prompted Danny’s change   of heart?   7. When Danny talks to Benjamin, the school teacher, Benjamin says that he wants to   believe all people are basically good, but his experience tells him otherwise. Danny   replies that people are just people. What do you think he means by this statement?   8. At the end of the film, Solomon comes face to face with Captain Poison, the RUF   commander responsible for forcing Solomon into slavery and turning his son, Dia, into   a child soldier. Captain Poison says that Solomon might think he’s the devil, but it is   only because he lives in hell. In what ways is Captain Poison a product of his   environment and in what ways is he a product of his choices?   9. For each character in the film, diamonds represent a different idea or symbol. Captain   Poison, for example, sees the pink diamond as his ticket to a better life. What do   diamonds represent to each of the characters?   10.

How does each   character respond to the conflict around him or her?   12. Maddy, the journalists and other foreign players, such as aid workers, struggle with   reporting what they see, doing their duty, and actually helping individuals in need.   They often fall prey to an “us” vs. “them” attitude. How does the film deal with the idea   of “the other”?   13. Though the film focuses on the devastation of war, it also deals with reconciliation,   rehabilitation, and hope. What are some specific scenes that deal with these topics?   How can the country begin to reconcile and recover from the effects of war?

In order to get a face painting it costed two stamps (you had to buy stamps *it raised money for the school). "i need two stamps," i told him. "well," he said, "i dont have two stamps, but i'll make you a deal"   "what kind of deal?"   "you can't know til i write it on this notepad"   "...okay then," i said   he wrote "you may yell at me next time i yell at you during math"   and signed his name   "now," he said "i'll take one of those dogs, but i want you to add some flair to it"   "i'm listening..."   "i want you to draw a dog on this cheek..."

Does it also mean merchandise and other stuff related to the movie, or does it just strictly mean screenings?         How many people here think it should have gone past "Titanic"?
20090222150300AAObyxd	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Is it true that if "Gone With the Wind" were to be made in this day and age, it would surpass "Titanic"?	That's box office sales and other stuff.  That's what was being said years ago after "Titanic"-mania swept across the world.  Does anyone think so?   I think i saw GWTW once when i was a kid.  I don't remember it, but it's supposed to be one of the greatest movies ever made.  Of course, I saw "Titanic", and really, it was more about a love story ON the Titanic, more than about the ship itself.  It's still a good movie, but not as good as "Lord of the Rings - Return of the King".  I think THAT movie should be #1. "The Dark Knight" is a good movie, but i don't think it should be #2 behind "Titanic".
20090222145608AAxNWHL	Entertainment & Music;Movies	So is Lord of the Rings the best trilogy in movie history, beating the Star Wars trilogy?

Star Wars prequels only garnished a few oscars here and there, for special effects, i believe.  So is LOTR the better movie franchise?        Also forgot to say that Return of the King made $1 billion worldwide, which no Star Wars movie ever did.

It's a commercial where a guy and I figure his g/f is sitting at a table eating and the song playing is a slow song with the words "Faith has brought us here" We should be together babe" something like that. Anyways I think the commercial is actually about cereal or something, does anyone know who and what the song is. Thanks
20090222145721AA56iDe	Entertainment & Music;Other - Entertainment	Is anyone else having problems finding a career that suits you?	I use to watch tv and tell myself that i want to be an actress or a singer. So I started believing it. I took acting classes in school and joined the choir. Now im not sure and i don't know what other things interest me anymore. Everything I do I base it on the performing arts. I took career quizzes to see what i'd be good in, but because im so into the arts I based all my answers on that.      Its very frustrating, because if i were to become a performer or curator or whatever, i'll never know if I made the right decision. It will be to late and i'll be stuck doing something I don't want to do for the rest of my life.   sorry......i had to vent!      but does anyone else feel like that? like picking a career is crushing you? because if its the wrong decision, then your screwed? My mom thinks I should do medical because its solid, and i will always have a job. That may be true, but I don't like blood, and I get distracted easily, and besides that, medical is ssssooooo boring!

20090222151453AA109bI	Entertainment & Music;Movies	I can't remember the name of this movie.?	Sadly, I remember very little about it. I don't remmeber any actors names, but I remember either David Grey's "This Year's Love" or Damien Rice's "The Blower's Daughter" was playing at the end of the movie. Closer was the only movie that came up for either of those songs.      The storyline was this college girl kind of tricked this boy into falling in love with her and exploited it in a presentation by showing her audience how very little one can do to make someone fall in love with them. I think she purposely invited him to the event either that or he found out incidentally. It was kind of like an art exhibit. The rest is blurry but I remember at the end, the same boy is older and with a little girl? and he passes a memorial with placks all over this big brick wall to people who had died doing something heroic and her name was on there.         I don't know. I know my description is so vague. I'm just hoping someone will know what I'm talking about. :/ It's been bugging me for years ha.
