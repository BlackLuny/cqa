20090219123912AAidMnW	Pets;Dogs	Do Breeders take advantage of "non-breeders"?	My grandma owns a pure bred (female) and this breeder asked to breed my grandmothers dog with her stud. Now I know it cost a lot of money to breed but my grandmother got NOTHING out of the deal except one of the puppies (which she is now being asked to breed again with the same breeder). Is this breeder taking advantage of my grandmother or is this how it works? (Other circumstances contribute to my concern i.e. my grandmother travels TO the stud, incurs some cost, etc...) Any info would help. We are not out to make money on breeding her dog we are just wondering if the breeder is morally legit.

20090219124451AA6iPsW	Pets;Dogs	Should i be worried about this behavior?	My Son is due to arrive  any day now and we are setting everything up in the baby room and other places in the house. We have two dogs a black lab and a Maltese and everything has been ok until now. The Maltese is going crazy and wants all the babies things. She will go into the baby room and bark and scratch at the cabinets.She has jumped into the bassinet set up in our room several times. Its like everything that has to do with the baby she wants for herself. The lab has become super protective of my wife and all of the babies things and has snapped at our Maltese every time she tries to go near my wife.They have never had issues with each other before.  We love these dogs and don't want to get rid of them but we are worried about the babies safety. Is there anything i could do to calm them both down? and why are they acting this we all of the sudden?

Should I take her to get an X-ray? She had her puppies late afternoon, while i wasn't home.

20090219125954AA5xOto	Pets;Dogs	Help keeping my dog in the fence?	I have a dog who is almost a year old; part lab, part border collie.  He is quite the leaper.  We have a 5' fence, and he has begun getting over the fence.  We have seen him do this, he jumps up, grabs the top, and climbs over.  He got his legs caught once,  and may have been hurt if my husband hadn't been right there.  All the other people in our neighborhood let there dogs run loose, and he wants out!  There is no leash law in our county.  Please don't tell me to let him go.  This is an agricultural area.  We have at least 3 neighbors who have chickens running around.  If he follows his Lab instincts and goes after them, the neighbors have every right to shoot them.  In the 2 years that I have lived here, I have had several neighbors mentioning their dog has disappeared.  Well duh!  Home boy has every right to shoot your dog, bury him on his property, and be done with it.  You'll never know what happened.       How can we keep him in?  We are thinking about running a single string of barb wire along the top, but that worries me too.  I'm afraid he may get stuck in the eye.  Does anyone have any ideas other than barb wire?  Or is my husband right about the barb wire being the answer?     Thanks.

My dogâ€™s kibble (Beneful Healthy Radiance) consist of six different types of flavors and I noticed that she eats everything but picks out the calcium and vegetable flavors. I even tried mixing the ones that she picks out with a bit of juice and meat from the canned dog food.-But she just ends up picking them out and licking them clean instead of eating them!  At first I thought it was cute because she would pick out the greens (Rice/Carbs) and eat them first so I assumed they were her favorite color (haha) but now I feel like she is wasting the rest of her food. Any advice? What are other good types of dog food? (This is a Chihuahua btw)

20090219130936AAmoUza	Pets;Dogs	What to do with a dog that hates cats and attacks dogs?	I adopted a Boxer/Dalmatian mix from the local shelter. He is very smart, sweet and loves to cuddle with us. Well, he got REALLY sick 2 days after we got him with either a severe case of kennel cough or distemper. He was out for 2 weeks, only eating through IV's and staying in the vet the entire time. The few days we had him before he seemed to not care about our cats or our dogs (Chow/Golden Retriever mix, Chihuahua and a Shih-Tzu). After $500+ in vet bills he is now completely healthy and a hyper and happy dog. Well, he attacks our cats what looks like to me to kill. He holds them down with his front paws and tries to eat them! He starts fights with our Chow mix and our Chow and Chevy now have scars and sores all over from this. I am now having to stay with my parents because my mother had a heart attack and they need my help. I took Chevy to live with us there and he attacked their 115 lb Great Pyrenees for NO reason. He was just lying there and Chevy attacked him and would not let go of his head! Besides the fact he wants to eat their cats as well. My question is, can this behavior be corrected? I really love him, he's so smart and sweet to humans and the small dogs but I'm afraid I won't be able to keep him if he keeps this up! What can I do? Anything?!? It's been too long for the shelter to take him back and that's a LOT of money to just give him back or find him a new home.

20090219135509AATplVu	Pets;Dogs	Why do puppies have to stay overnight when spayed?	I have called around to different vets because I don't like the "policy" of keeping my dog overnight in a crate for 11 hours unattended. They leave at 7p and don't return until 6a. They told me it is so they can examine the dog the next morning and deal with any issues. My argument is that if any issues arise in the middle of the night I will be there immediately. I have my own crate so she will be quiet and will also be able to go outside if she needs to pee.      Is there any real good reason to keep them or should I just take her to the SPCA where they will return her to me at 3pm?

20090220081946AAE6J09	Pets;Dogs	How is this fair...??? Its not fair!?	We had an insurance lady come to the house...we were having the house re-sided and the front door was not in use--she had to use the back door and that is where out rottweiler hangs out in the back yard.   Now she saw the dog when she came in, outside on his chain and there was more than enough room for her to walk by on the trail and the dog could not reach her even if he tried--he wrapped himself around the huge Pine tree about 20 times.    So when she was leaving it was dark and we followed her out the back door. She walked off the path as the dog noticed her and barked and she stuck her hand out in passing to say hi to the dog. Well he bite her hand but did not even draw blood, he left some red marks though. She left that night and called to get out vets number the next day to find out about his shots and we told her they were updated. Anwyays, the news made its way to our insurance comany and they have taken our home insurance away and will not re-cover us until the dog is gone.      Sorry its long guys. Bare with me here. My question is: this lady stuck her hand out knowing he was there and that he was a rottie and that it was dark and he did not know her. How is that our fault...he is a guard dog. He has been a part of this family for 7 years almost now and he has always protected us. He loves people...and is hyper with some minor issues within the family in the past but how can we control what *she does and how is it fair that she can have our home insurance severed? If she had not of stuck her hand out to pet him he would have not bite her...she walked off the path to say hi without asking us first. We followed her out there to make sure she made it around the front of the house because of the dog (just to be safe) Its not like we could hold her hand..    Is there anything we can do besides getting rid of the dog? Like can we fight back against her because it was her lack of  discretion that got her bit?       Does anyone have any legal advise as to what we can do now. I would love to call her and start screaming but I dont think thats a good idea.    Mature answers only please and anyone with experience, please any input would be great.

20090203061314AAOz0No	Pets;Fish	My ghost shrimp are dying off?	I purchased 5 ghost shrimp about 8 months ago and recently they have all been dying off. I recently put a few water plant bulbs in the water. I have a 5gal tank with heater, filter, and a bubble stone. Temp is around 80 degrees and ammonia levels are at 0. Tankmates are an otocinclus and a betta, which seem to be doing just fine. I recently purchased 2 baby ghost shrimp and an apple snail but I'm afraid to put them in the big tank because I don't want them to die. Could the plant bulbs have something to do with this?

20090220064959AARAc1m	Pets;Dogs	The dogs at Debby's Pet Land?	Debby's Pet Land is a chain of pet stores that we have here in MA, and im not sure where else they are. I think these stores are cruel and almost all of the dogs are visibly ill. There have been many accounts of people buying the dogs, but they end up dieing only a little while later due to the poor care they received at Debby's pet land. i filed a complaint with the MSPCA because i want to make sure that the conditions the dogs are living in are "reasonable" (which i do not think they are) I dont think the dogs are ever taken to the vet, even if they are sick, which is a case of animal cruelty to have the dog go untreated. I also fear that the store gets there dogs from puppy mills. i asked the store in north attleboro where they get there puppys from, and they said breeders. but i know they wouldnt admit getting them from puppy mills.      so, i pretty much am just looking to see what everyone thinks of this place. if you dont know about it then you can just google it and see what i mean.   im also wondering if there is any email address i can contact the headquarters or the owner through. i would love to ask them some questions...      thanks so much!

20090220082218AALKSrN	Pets;Dogs	Is this dog aggressive?	There's a German Shepard that almost always attacks my 1 year old Samoyed at the dog park. The owner thinks it's "normal" dominance behavior. I don't think so. This is what happens: the shepard attacks her, often on the face, my dog cowers and lies down on her back and the shepard keeps attacking. My dog starts crying and the shepard keeps attacking her. At this point I break it up. The shepard's owner makes no attempt to restrain his dog and thinks I shouldn't break them up because they need to "sort things out". I tell the guy that once a dog is submissive and crying the other dog is supposed to stop. He says that his dog would stop if I didn't break it up. Who do you think is right?

20090220085207AAGwMX3	Pets;Rodents	My rat has diarrhea, what does it mean?	She had trouble breathing, walking, eating, she was dehidrated, and so we took her to the vet. The vet gave us some medicine in which we must give her three times a day and gave her a needle with some water in it so she would be hidrated again.    She's been looking a lot better latley. She's eating/drinking by herself again, sleeping, and breathing better, but not entirley. Anyways, just about five minutes ago she was climbing her cage and I notced she had diarrhea all over her butt, and a small dribble of pee. She's never had bathroom problems before...and rats can't get wet tail like hamsters can..can they? Also, she's sitting on the very edge of her hammock, and bending over as if she's about to do a nose dive off the hammock. She was doing it yesterday and kept falling off, and then getting back on. Now she's doing it again. Is she trying to kill herself or something?   I can't take her back to the vet because the last time we took her she said that's all we could do for her for now. Also, I'm only 14 and my mom is at work, and my grandparents aren't an option at the moment either. :(      What do I do? Is she dying? Is she trying to die? Does the diarrhea just mean that her stomach is upset, or what?   Please help!   Thanks.

I got 2 yellow belly sliders about a year ago and one of them was much smaller and would not grow as much as the other. He always layed on the land area seeming sick. Then one day when i was about to feed em i notice the smaller/sick turtle was missing. I looked at the bottom of the tank and there was bits of its shell, skin and bone. Most of it was gone though, the bigger turtle had eaten the smaller!      A year has passed and i really want to get another Yellow Belly Slider, but im scared that the one i have now (the one that ate the smaller/sick turtle) will attempt to eat this one too!       Is it possible that it was just really hungry or something so it ate the other? Or is it just aggressive? How can i prevent it from harming the turtles im getting?      He is about 3 inches big. Thanks!
20090220095942AAGVBaH	Pets;Horses	Showing multiple horses?	This year I'm possiably showing 4 different horses, two in hand, and two under saddle (possiably both the inhand horses under saddle eventually but one is super green that needs more miles before I start showing him under saddle and the other is my personal horse who I haven't ridden with other horses in over a year so I'm a bit hesitant entering her under saddle right away.)      Not sure if all four horses would be at the same show (it depends on who we can rent a trailer from at this point).      Anyways my question's are First will I need separate numbers? I've shown before but never more than one horse so I'm curious on how that would work. and if I do need separate numbers how do I change my number quickly if I'm on two different horses with classes back to back? I already have someone who can hold the other horse ready at the gate so actually getting the horse won't be the problem it would just be changing my number quickly.       :

There was a layer of skin attached to the hair, but no blood.   I've never had this happen before, anyone else ever had this happen?   He has no other spots like this and is shedding right now, could that have caused it?

20090220093104AAA5aTB	Pets;Dogs	If you fed a lower quality "natural" dog food & supplemented it with fresh meat...?	....would that compare to feeding a 6star rated dog food?      I went to Dog Food Analysis website and entered in different dog foods.  I was very surprised at my findings.  Did anyone else realize that Eukanuba for instance (a higher priced dog food)  is comparable or gets the same 1 star rating as a bargain dog food such as Come & Get it?       I feed an all natural dog, by product/corn/wheat free food that recieves a 3 star rating. Mainly because of insufficient meat content.   I supplement this with meaty bones and innerds such as a bit of heart and liver from various animals but beef and pork namely.  They do get occasional venison or wild bird product as well. Is this just as benificial to my dogs as feeding a 6star rated dog food?  Why or why not?       To all you RAW feeders out there, if you comment, be aware that feeding a strictly raw diet is undesirable for me.  I have researched it and researched it but do not feel confident going completely raw...but I do add it in addition to a dry dog food as I understand  the benifites.  But I am not confident that I could "make" a dog food that is 100 balanced.      To anyone else, who feeds crap and is happy with it, please do not comment.  I would appreciate answers from folks who have experience in the area of dog food.  I by no means will feed totally crap dog food.        I live in an area where getting the 6star dog food is impossible.  No one has heard of it or is unable to get it.  I was looking at Innova, Orijen, and Wellness Core, namely.        Thanks in advance for your opinions...

Its very very small as a puppy, and the one i seen was Grey all over and had like a whitey face.   His face looked a little like this.    http://www.pets4homes.co.uk/pets4homes/h...    But it was all Grey and only a little white on his face? Does anyone know or can make a suggestion about what it could be? I LOVE THEM!

If I ask her if she wants to go outside, she will get excited ( if she needs to), and run to the door. Or if it's just time, ie: first thing in the morning, when I get home from work, etc. She is partially paper trained (pee not poo).What I really want is to train her to alert ME in some way (scratching on the door, ringing bells, barking by the door) to the fact that she needs to go out. She also will only urinate and defecate separately (different trips outside) and if I don't catch her she will poo in the house. How can I get her to do both in one trip outside?

Girlfriend has a flemish giant, so it can reach anything 3 feet off the ground... I have computer wires, cell phone chargers, laptop power supply, industrial server rack power strips, and more that all have cords... I've done all I can by mounting some of the power strips to the bottom of my desks and taping the wires... Just to keep her from chewing through them.      Some spots in the house just can't be changed or modified.. Is there anything I can stick on the wires so she won't chew on them? Even like bleach? If it means she'll only chew on something once and never again...      I just lost an optical mouse that you can't find ANYWHERE b/c she thought the cord was her chew toy. Discontinued because they came out with a new model. I had 4 of these mice that are all of different colors. I'm sure you don't understand, but I liked the look of all 4 of our PCs/laptops having these matching(different colored) mice.      We've tried that... "white vinegar" trick, if anything she chews on the stuff more. I also stay strapped with a squirt bottle. That only scares her from 1 chewing spot to another.       She has hanging chewing block, a edible log, tons of food/water, and a rubber dog toy (kong I think they're called). There can't be a reason for this destructiveness.      If you have more than one idea post it, also looking for something I can MAYBE stick on the carpet b/c she likes to try and rip it up.         (also she isn't of age to be fixed yet [in spite of her size]... so I know her behavior is going to be harder to tame)         Thanks again yall.
20090220094135AAV0DpU	Pets;Dogs	Should I stop my older pup from playing rough with younger pup?	I have a 13 week old German Shepherd puppy and an 8 week old German Shepherd puppy.      They are both good, smart dogs, but old older pup likes to play rough.  I know he is only playing because his tail is wagging and he doesn't growl, but the little dog just gets bullied.  He pulls her by the ears and bites her back.  He knocks her down and pushes her around.  I feel bag disciplining the older dog, because I know he is only playing, but I don't know what else to do.

In the last few months, my stepsister moved in and brought her cat who's now been here for about 4/5 months and is finally settling in.      Before the new cat came, we had 2 cats of our own here. They always got on fine and never showed aggression or anything towards us or each other, infact they got on pretty well. as we expected when my stepsisters cat was brought here there's been alot of hissing and theyve not been getting on so well, which we expected from both sides. however in the  month or so things have improved gradually and the new cat doesnt seem to hiss anymore and she seems to have settled in. however one of our own cats is always following her and seems to be winding her up, sometimes trying to fight her. and in the last couple days has even been going for our other cat! theyve never ever had problems towards each other so i really dont know why this aggressions suddenly come out , towards the new cat i can see why, but our other cat has been here just as long as she has so im not sure what to think on why shes now trying to fight her too .      any opinions or advice is much appreciated, ty

20090203070356AA87Yxe	Pets;Dogs	My bassett swallows his rawhides - What to give him - Help!?	We just adopted a 2-3 year old basset hound and recently had a scare where he swallowed his favorite rawhide toy. They say this is not digestible so we called the emergency vet and they gave us a way to have him puke it up just in case it wouldn't digest, then we would have had a bigger problem on our hands. Since then we have taken away all his chew toys. I found in the closet some thicker rawhides that were braided from Christmas and gave that to him, he did well with the first one until he chewed it so much then it fell apart so I took it away and gave him a new one (so he would not swallow) and he chewed half of that one and swallowed it in 5 min.These are thick rawhides about 2 inches wide! Last night I gave him a dental bone to chew on and that was gone in less than 5 min. My question is what is a good rawhide to give him and is it normal for bassets to chew through things like they are rottweilers!! I don't think that a toy for a medium sized dog like that should be gone in 5 min. We can't keep up because he eats everything so quick and then we have nothing to give him and he gets bored. Thanks for your help!

20090220111729AA9f6mT	Pets;Dogs	How do I make my dog bark?	My dog, Jim, really has a problem with barking. When I first got him, all he did was bark until it became an issue with neighbors and I had to yell at him until he stopped. Now it's a few months later, and he only barks if a stranger is at the door and rings the bell.. Problem is, I want him to be able to bark when I tell him to as well, but he will not bark under any normal circumstances. Food doesn't get him, standing in a room with a closed door and asking him to come only results in whining, and IF I manage to convince him that there is a stranger outside, he will bark, and quickly ignore my praise and as soon as possible investigate the assumed stranger. If I am ringing the doorbell or knocking on the door, he refuses to bark.. He even has been known to accidently push closet doors shut after he's gone inside a walk in closet and be silent for 5 plus hours while we worry sick calling him and searching everywhere for him. He's very smart, and very loving, and he learns everything else I've taught him faster then other dogs I've had, but he absolutely cannot seem to grasp that I actually want him to speak... Unless there is a stranger at the door, in which case he joins me to bark at the postman while I sign for my package.. Any help would be appreciated, I'm about to give up since I'm starting to feel like I'm just confusing and frustrating him. I have managed to teach him growl, but he clearly doesn't like it as he doesnt wag his tail and almost seems like he's worried I'll be upset with him for growling at me, so we tend to avoid that one as it obviously upsets him. He was a rescue dog, but aparently he's lived in a kennel his whole life until I got him a year ago.

About 1.5 years ago she started barking when at the top of the stairs, especially when I walk away from the bottom of the stairs and go out of sight. I cannot get her to stop. It is driving me and many other people crazy.  She is a great dog; if only I break her of this habit! Can anyone offer help? Thank you.
20090220114054AA9mg9p	Pets;Birds	Parakeet breeding questions?	Ok so I have 4 parakeets two females (which one is is in the breeding stage she has the brown crust appearance on her nostrils) and two males. One male is only 5 weeks o i know he isn't able to breed at this point but the other male is. Here is the problem. I have noticed the female with the brown on her beak continuously going in and out of the nesting box and she usually stays in there. The male acts like he wants to go with her and be around her but the other female refuses to allow him to. Now why is this female going in this box for the past three days and why is the other female acting mean toward the male parakeet and refusing to allow him to be around the other female?
20090220121013AAfMnfN	Pets;Rodents	Questions about rats?	We may be getting a rat tomorrow.  Someone needs to find a home for theirs and asked us to take it.  We'll get the cage and whatever supplies they have on hand.  I've never had a rat before so I have a few questions.      What kind of foods do they eat?  I mean, I know I can go out and buy rat food but what brands are good? What other foods can they eat?  I've heard of people feeding them dog food.  Is that a responsible thing to do? I use aspen bedding for my other pets.  Is that ok for a rat?        This is just one rat.  Don't they need at least 1 friend?  If I did get another rat, does it matter what size or breed?  Would they fight if I put one with this one?      Are they any good websites that I can look at?        Thanks!

20090203083212AAsaHR7	Pets;Dogs	Potty training issues with my 10 week old Shih Tzu puppy?	"Whoa Whoa" did very well the first week.  When I took him  outside he would go to the bathroom right away, get his praise and treat and back inside.  The the first weekend with nice weather hit and the kids were taking him outside to play.  Now when I take him out to potty he wants to play.  If I ignore his pleas for attention he just lays in the grass.  Then when we go inside, he finds a nice spot to potty in the house.  How can I get him to know that it is time to potty not play?

20090203085658AAspTyc	Pets;Cats	Special Safety Advice for Cats, Automatic Garage Doors?	My very special kitty just had a very traumatic accident with our automatic garage door.  My 9 year old siamese cat must have been sitting or sleeping on top of the opened garage door and became trapped when the door was closing.  He was pinned for atleast 45 minutes between the garage door and the wall.  The compression of his back in the door caused a spinal cord injury and he is in the animal hospital.  He can't walk but they have some hope since he does have feelings in his legs and tail...   We are devastated that this happened and want to get the word out to other pet owners the real dangers!!  Is there any sensors you can install at the top of your Garage door to keep it from closing on something?
20090203091258AAp1TcN	Pets;Cats	My cats have had a cold for about a month now. I don't know what else to do but wait it out!?	I have a resident cat, Harley, she is 4 and has never been sick. A little over a month ago we got Peanut, she is about 5 months old. Peanut had a cold when we brought her home from the humane society, and unfortunately gave it to Harley. After a few weeks Harley stopped eating so I was given the okay to give her antibiotics that I had around just in case. Both of them are still sick. They aren't sneezing as much but have occasional coughing fits. Harley has very watery eyes and they both squint their right eyes. I have been told over and over that as long as they are eating and drinking they will be fine. But it's just been so long that I am starting to lose patience with the situation. I feel really bad and would just love to have 2 healthy cats in the house!!   Any suggestions?! Or calming words of wisdom!
20090203091402AASFPKW	Pets;Fish	Do I need to vacuum my gravel if I have an under gravel filter?	My question is this.  My 29 gallon tank has been up and running for about 2-2.5 months.  I thought the tank had cycled (nitrites and ammonia had peeked and then returned to 0 ppm), but this week it has gotten really cloudy and smelly.  Also, the ammonia has gone up again.  When doing water changes, do I need to vacuum the gravel if I have a UGF?  Or, will I only remove the nitrifying bacteria?  Thanks in advance

20090203091803AAPXU8t	Pets;Dogs	How do I get my dog to stop chewing?	My 9 month old mastiff is chewing on everything when we leave. He is very good while we are home, but when we leave he tares stuff up. He has toys and bones, he has torn up remotes, notebooks, and just about anything else he can find. We try to put everything up and away from him so he can't get to it but somehow he either finds something new or gets ahold of what we put up. This is only when we leave, we cannot leave him outside and he doesn't fit into any kennels. Any ideas on what I can do to keep my things?

20090410154235AA1zdH3	Pets;Dogs	How do I get rid of blackheads and pimples for my chinese crested?	My little chinese crested girl is about 7 month old and has bad blackheads and pimples. She is a pink color with black spots! I have to say though, nobody ever told me what to feed her right or how to take care properly of there skin! So now I sit here with my poor girl and don`t know what the heck to do! I don`t want to pick at them since first of all I do not want to hurt her and then because there are so many of them! I feed her Old Yeller and I have to say she loves it! I read a few questions that were asked about these problems and I dont know if there is a dog food kind out there that will fit there diet perfect or if it is better to cook for them! So please somebody help me and my chinese girl! She is so pretty and such a lover! So please only answer if you got something that could help my dogs and safe the "ewwww blackheads on dogs?!?" and the "get a dog that has fur!" answeres! Anybody that does not know that breed and never wants to get to know them, is missing out big time! Yes they are a little bit more high to maintain but they are have so much to give! I have 3 more dogs beside her, a mini schnauzer, a chihuahua and a german shepherd, which is police dog! Don`t get me wrong but my chinese crested brought something very special with her (besides blackheads ;-)!   So thank you all in advance for your help!
20090219190606AAZUAh6	Pets;Birds	Is my parrot masturbating?	I just moved my conure's wood pot toy closer to his perch, and he has been rubbing his butt against it and making a soft "errrhhhh.....errrrhhhhh" sound when he does it. Is he, um, jacking off? I am not sure he is a male, he has not been sexed. Should I take his toy away from him, or let him do his thing?
