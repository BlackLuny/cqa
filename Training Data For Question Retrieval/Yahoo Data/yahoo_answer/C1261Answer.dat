It takes a long time and a lot of snow, but that is basically how it works.

Did you experience any pain or discomfort during the MRI scan.  Any metallic foreign bodies could be a real problem during an MRI scan.  ( The metal object could move due to the magnetic field or could heat up due to the RF field ).  I am wondering if the darkening of your eyes was due to an increase in blood pressure (or the like) due to anxiety that most people experience when being placed into an MRI bore.  MRI's are noisy and quite claustrophobic.  How long did it take for the darkening to go away ?

You have a super-cooled solution when you cool a liquid solution below it's freezing point without it freezing.  <br>  They super-cooled the beer, then, by tapping the beer on the counter, they add energy to, and destabilize the solution, causing it to instantly freeze.<br>  <br>  You can also super-heat a solution.  This happens often when you heat pure water in a microwave.  This superheated water will explode into a furious boil if you add sugar or coffee powder to it.

AA10557409	Fission is the process of disintegration of heavy nuclide to lighter one to achieve stability. During the process, the energy is released as thermal and kinetic energy. <br>  <br>  Let say A ~> B + 3n + energy<br>  where A=the unstable atom (called parent nuclide)<br>  B=the stable atom (called daughter nuclide)<br>  n= neutron produced as by product (3n is only average)<br>  <br>  The neutrons can induced disintegration of another atom<br>  n + C ~> C unstable<br>  C unstable ~> D + 3n + energy<br>  <br>  So, u see, this rection is a chain reaction. <br>  <br>  Another example is nuclear reactor. But in a nuclear reactor, the process is being control by manipulating the control rod made of carbon(or boron) to absorb the neutrons released during disintegration. Thus, we can slow down the reaction.<br>  <br>  But in atomic bomb, the reaction is intentionally uncontrolled so that the disintegration rate would increase, thus increasing the energy released. The energy released is what we see as a gigantic explosion.(Becoz its energy is expanding so rapidly)<br>  <br>  Do u remember the Chernobyl catastrophy. During that accident, the fission reaction was uncontrolled because the operator carelessly forgot to brought down the control rod. So the reactor became hot and finally exploded. The reaction is similar to atomic bomb but on a smaller scale.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Fusion reaction is the process of combining the lighter element to form heavier element. (opposite to fussion)<br>  But similar to fussion, it also release a lot of energy during the process. The light element that i mentioned is hidrogen.<br>  <br>  H + H ~> He + energy<br>  <br>  This technology required a lot of energy to combine the atoms. Usually we use laser to provide energy to make the atoms collide each other. But in the case of hydrogen bomb, we use small atomic bomb to give sufficient energy for the atoms to combine.<br>  <br>  Until todays, no hydrogen bomb was used by any nations. But the Soviet and US have unofficially used it during test. Hydrogen bomb provide greater power that the atomic bomb. Hydrogen bomb need a very advanced technology to acquire it.<br>  <br>  Another example of fusion reaction is the sun. The sunlight is actually the energy released during fusion reaction. <br>  <br>  The hydrogen bomb is described as cleaner that the atomic bomb. Becoz atomic bomb will produce radioactive waste. And becoz of this characteristic, many countries opt to use it in the future. note that there is no nuclear reactor that used fusion reaction since it need a very high energy that even can easily vaporized metal.|`|4f234d5b9bdc58fdad5bc1df7ffadcd7aa	The difference between nuclear fission & fusion is nuclear fission is a process in nuclear physics and nuclear chemistry in which the nucleus of an atom splits into two or more smaller nuclei as fission products, and usually some by-product particles, Hence, fission is a form of elemental transmutation, while, <br>  fusion is the process by which multiple nuclei join together to form a heavier nucleus. It is accompanied by the release or absorption of energy depending on the masses of the nuclei involved. <br>  <br>  In nuclear fission the energy comes from the bombardment of the element e.g uranium by slow neutron, several neutrons are produced as by products. When the size of the element exceeds critical mass, there is a rapid production of neutrons accompanied by a release of tremendous amount of energy in a nuclear explosion.<br>  In nuclear fusion the energy comes from the fusion of two light atomic nuclei which fuse(combine) together to form a heavier nucleus and release energy. The energy of the sun is through nuclear fussion due to the presence of  hydrogen isotope in the sun and the conditions of extremely high temperatures and pressure.  More information on nuclear fusion is contained in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusion_power" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusion_powe...</a>

Sorry, the answer isn't fun, but the whole north south hemisphere thing is a myth.<br>  <br>  "The way that the water in your toilet swirls is determined by the way that your toilet is built, not which hemisphere you live in. The toilet shoots the water into the bowl at an angle, which determines which way the water swirls. "<br>  <br>  In the case of a drain or bathtub, the force usually described as responsible for the direction the water swirls is a force known as the Coriolis force, which is a force that appears due to the earth's spin. However, this force is not strong enough to affect which direction the water swirls. This is instead due to small things such as how the water falls (if it is a little off center from where the drain is) and the path the water has taken previously. Miniscule things can influence the waters path, and it doesn't really have to do with what hemisphere you're in. Sorry again, it's not as exciting as it seems it should be. Here's another link that explains it maybe better than I can:<br>  <a href="http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a1_161.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a1_...</a><br>  <br>  And another:<br>  <a href="http://www.physlink.com/Education/AskExperts/ae273.cfm?CFID=14975112&CFTOKEN=98861553" rel="nofollow">http://www.physlink.com/Education/AskExp...</a><br>  <br>  The consensus is that hurricanes and such are large enough to be affected by the "Coriolis Force", but things as small as a bathtub or sink are not.<br>  <br>  And also, the Earth will not turn into a black hole. It doesn't work that way, and the shape of a galaxy has nothing to do with which direction water swirls in a toilet bowl, or a drain of any sort. Hemispheres also have nothing to do with a magnetic field. The magnetic field goes from the S. pole to the N. pole, so at the equator, the magnetic field would still be going (in the general direction) of the north pole... the spinning of water has nothing to do with the earth's magnetic field.|`|9d3ce70fe723c76264a9f283d685bce2aa	Usually in toilets the direction is caused by the inlets that let water into the toilet. So it would just go whichever way those point.<br>  <br>  However, hurricanes do spin either way depending on northern/southern hemisphere and I don't know what would happen.|`|AA11348724	There is no direct "spot". The magnetic field moves in two direction at the same time. To explain this phenomina is to cut a strip of paper 8 x 1/2 x .003. Keep in mind that the ribbon of paper is three dimensional. Lay flat on the table and mark one end with 'N" & the other with 'S". Lift the ribbon and form a circle. As the ring forms you must pass the Tropic of Cancer, the Equator and then the Tropic of Capacorn. At the point that the equator was passed the north looses its identity and is now South. In Science there can be no contridiction. Lay flat on the table the ribbon with the marks on the underside and mark the end that has the 'N" with an 'S". Now form the circle again this time with a 90 degree twist. Look at your marks. The North is North and the South is South. Study the Helix and note that the twist begins at Cancer goes through the null and rotates out of the twist at Capicorn. The magnetic field is a helix. It drags all the dust and gases with it and makes weather. One can say that weather is a function of magnetics and not of thermodynamics. A magnet is compossed of 3 parts which is known as the Trinity. The N&S are all equal. The power of & is energy without mass which is known as antimatter. This can be proven by breaking a bar magnet and atempting to rejoin the two parts. It can not be done. Your three dimensional ribbon of paper as viewed at the edge has a negative & positive whether or not it is 8 inches long or .003 inches thick. Matter can not exist without antimatter. Same thing with the atom. Electron, Nuetron, Protron. The ribbon allong its length is also N&S so it is imposible to have a direct line of separation between the two forces. The point of transition from North to South is refered to as Polarization. The term domain of the north and the domain of the south tells us that we are entering into an unbalance. That is why Solar systems are Flat as well as Galixies. Planets form within the null as frequency are read in the sine. There is no mystery here as long as you understand the trinity. Was it a coincidence that the atomic weopns station was named TRINITY as we know the project to be.<br>  The null changes and the most frequent appearance is found in the Bermuda Triangle and it has a corresponding location on the other side of the Globe. This is what will become a BLACK HOLE as the Earth grows to become a gas giant and a star, a solar system, a galaxy within the universe. Very simple stuff.|`|Ey4z7tDkaa	one would assume that it wouldn't exactly swirl but just drain out without swirling|`|rCP1jjc1aa	It just goes straight down into the hole, according to my friend, who went to the equator and tried that.<br>  <br>  Perhaps in a toilet Taiyed is right, but what about something like a bathtub or sink?

AA11007366	It's not fair to give you the whole answer as I suspect this is a homework or exam question (and as a former teacher I won't do it for you) but I will give you the info you need.<br>  Nitrogen is group 5, that means it essentially prefers covalent compounds, but has the possibility, with lone pairs of electrons to form polarities and hence polarised or a 1+ ion in compounds. Any polarised compound is soluble in water to some degree, any ionic compound is very soluble (big clue there!)<br>  With the reaction, you've got NH3 & HCl - I think that's an obvious one there!<br>  Just to point out NH2Cl is chloramine, not to be confused with ammonium chloride, a totally different chemical. Cloramine is not very stable and not soluble in large amounts (look at it's electronic distribution).<br>  If you do pass chlorine gas into Ammonia it will catch light and decompose the ammonia to HCL and N2; if the quantities of NH3 are in excess, you get NCl3 - very explosive (and a cool, if dangerous, chem lab trick!) For any reaction, the chlorine must be "wet", i.e. be HCl.<br>  As for the properties part, the question wants you to compare the compound against it's constituent atomic molecules. Sure they're all gasses, but how reactive and soluble is Nitrogen? <br>  I know that doesn't answer the question, but you should have all you need to figure out the answer fairly well from that.|`|1d7a1b7ab25d6e3edafff6c897a00d32aa	if the boiling points are far enough apart distillation can be used.|`|hzwdoBnfaa	Dude are you trying to cheat or something?????

ea2afd19b6b31f482b78ed7b16609e88aa	Having just had a series of renal lectures it is not to my knowledge that kidneys exclusively regulate blood pressure. That said they can regulate how much blood enters them as the kidney are encased in what is essentially a tough skin and a surge of blood would blow your glomeruli to pieces.

When the kidneys (specifically the juxtaglomerular appartatus) senses decreased blood pressure (BP) it releases renin. Renin makes angiotensin II, a compound which does numerous things<br>  -Increases sympathetic (adrenaline like) nervous system activity, which rapidly increases BP<br>  -Increases the resorption of Na+ and Cl-<br>  -Increases the resorption of H2O<br>  -Causes vasocontriction<br>  -Causes the release of antidiuretic hormone, which further enhances H2O resorption.<br>  <br>  The opposite happens when BP goes up.
CfgXxNwgaa	Our sky is colored because our atmosphere makes blue light when sunlight passes through it. This phenomenon is called "scattering." It is similar to when sunbeams reveal themselves in the presence of dust, most spectacularly in cathedrals. The atmosphere causes the sky to be colored. <br>  <br>  If there were no atmosphere, the sky would appear black, like the lunar sky in Apollo pictures taken from the moon. But even a black sky has some lightness... Even at night, the sky always has a faint color, called "skyglow" by astronomers. Atmospheres also cause skyglow from faint airglow in the upper atmosphere (a permanent, low-grade aurora), and starlight scattered in the atmosphere. Even if there were no atmosphere, faint skyglow is caused by sunlight reflected off interplanetary dust (zodiacal light), and background light from faint, unresolved stars and nebulosity.|`|7a75bf23b8bfec60292f27390a499a27aa	blue spectrum of light bounces back to you!

AA11612227	In pre-calculus, you're being prepared for calculus.  You learn more advanced algebra.  You do problems that combine algebra and geometry.  Yes, you will see things from algebra and trigonometry.  You will do a LOT of graphing transformed (translated and stretched) trig. functions, even though you did it in trig.  It's like a big review, plus you learn new things.  You will learn about (or review) vectors.  Then you will learn about parametric equations and polar coordinates.  Then you'll learn more about imaginary and complex numbers.  After that, you'll learn about sequences and series (both finite and infinite).  At the same time, you'll learn about limits.  Then you'll learn about the continuity.  Consequently, you'll learn about derivatives.  You'll learn to find derivative using the definition of the derivative.  Then you'll learn the shortcuts like that Power Rule.  If you're lucky, you'll even learn the chain rule, making life easier in calculus.<br>  <br>  This is all the stuff that I remember learning in pre-calculus.  I may be missing something.

Just a good appreciation of algebra, polynomials and the coordinate system are useful. Trigonometric identies are very useful for some more advanced integrals.

In this reaction a hydrogen atom is removed from the alkane, then replaced by a halogen atom by reaction with a diatomic halogen molecule.

Provided there is enough chlorine present, the reaction will continue until all of the hydrogen atoms have been substituted (it is a chain reaction). <br>  <br>  And for the second question: <br>  1)Look for the longest chain, example if there are three carbon atoms, then part of the name is propane (the third alkane)<br>  2)look for side groups, example if CH3, which has one carbon atom, so it is called methyl.<br>  3) Look at the position of this group, count along the chain, example, if it is on the second carbon, the name is therefore 2-methylpropane.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry I still haven't learn anything about cis and trans isomers, so i can't help you with the third question, but hope the other two answers help!
83DGStWdaa	Despite their common names, crane flies do not prey on mosquitoes as adults, nor do they bite humans. Some larval crane flies may on occasion feed on mosquito larvae.[1] Adult crane flies feed on nectar or they do not feed at all; most crane fly species live only to mate and die once they become adults. Their larvae, called "leatherjackets" or "leatherjacket slugs" because of the way they move, consume roots (such as those of turf grass in backyard lawns) and other vegetation, in some cases causing damage to plants. Therefore the crane fly is occasionally considered a mild turf pest in some areas.|`|7mej4lO0aa	Nope, crane flies don't eat adult mosquitoes.

Gw0m0Rivaa	gay si nasce e sopratutto si è, questo non dipende ne dall'ambiente in cui si cresce ne dalla famiglia in cui si vive, essere gay è un fenomeno che avviene dalla nascita, avviene sempre e comunque indipendentemente da tutto, chi è gay rimane gay e chi è etero rimane etero indipendentemente dalle esperienze sessuali che ha, studi dimostrano che essere gay avviene nel dieci per cento della popolazione umana adulta, statisticamente quindi la probabilità che due gemelli a prescindere dalla società che li accoglie siano gay, resta comunque la stessa, dieci per cento di probabilità di esserlo entrambi, la statistica insegna, avere due figli maschi o due figlie femmine è sempre del cinquanta per cento, perchè il fatto che tu abbia già un figlio maschio non modifica tale statistica che è e rimane del cinquanta per cento, la stessa cosa dicasi con il lancio della moneta per fare testa e croce, certo che se uscirà mille volte di seguito testa allora vorrà dire che la moneta era truccata ma questo è un discorso che esula dal nostro ragionamento. La sessualità gay non è la sola ad essere presente nel genere umano, esiste il transgendersmo, il bisessualismo, l'asessualismo, il pansessualismo, quindi le probabilità che entrambi non siano etero aumentano. Non dimentichiamo che nelle società più evolute, nel sesso contano più i gusti personali che il sesso biologico del partner che ci piace, portando a una condizione di pansessualismo generale per cui essere etero, essere bisessuale ed essere gay non è più una questione di sopravvivenza o di adattamento ma piuttosto un discorso di ricerca della felicità, ognuno preferisce condividere esperienze e fare l'amore con chi vuole, con chi lo rende felice e lo fa star bene, gay e etero sono categorie che esistono ma non sono mai separate così nettamente, le categorie sono per i barattoli non per le persone.|`|S8eShjz6aa	Senza entrare nell'annosa questione del "omosessuali si nasce o si diventa?", secondo il giudizio dei molti ke ritengono ke lo si diventa, è molto probabile ke uno dei/delle due gemelli/e (se il sesso è lo stesso) diventi omosessuale.

2519dc75ed067a952c6bcebfa4265e1faa	Pour moi,  il s'agit de l'image du passage de l'Homme en tant qu'animal à l'Homme en tant qu'individu tout en se servant d'une analogie d'ordre sexuelle, le fruit défendu étant le plaisir tant convoité d'une folle nuit d'amour.<br>  <br>  Ce passage d'animal à Homme s'effectue par la découverte du plaisir. En effet, d'après la Bible les animaux ne ressentent rien seul l'Homme peut ressentir.<br>  Le premier plaisir évoqué est le sexe. L'Homme découvre qu'une relation sexuelle pouvait-être autre chose qu'une nécessité de reproduction mais aussi un jeu fort plaisant.<br>  Quand l'Homme s'est rendu compte que le plaisir existait, sa vie a pris tout le sens que fut la recherche du bonheur (ou du plaisir).<br>  <br>  Hélas en même temps que le plaisir, na?t son opposé: la douleur autre extrême du ressenti.<br>  Avant d'avoir consommé le fruit défendu (avant d'avoir couché ensemble), Adam et Eve, tels des animaux, ne ressentaient rien, ni le plaisir, ni la douleur: un accouchement se faisait donc sans douleur, celle-ci étant inconnu et n'étant pas ressentie par les animaux qu'ils étaient.<br>  <br>  Après la découverte du plaisir, l'accouchement se fait désormais dans la douleur, car celle-ci est désormais connue donc ressentie<br>  <br>  Avec le plaisir, est venue la recherche du plaisir, donc l'envie et son opposée, la peur.<br>  La relation sexuelle est pour Adam et Eve la chose la plus plaisante qui soit, c'est donc la chose la plus enviée. Par extension, on peut considérée que la seule vue des parties génitales de chacun puisse leur donner une irresistible envie de copuler,... .. avec les douloureux résultats qui s'en suivent: l'accouchement.<br>  On peut aussi, supposer, que pendant qu'ils copulent, Adam et Eve ne peuvent vaquer à leurs occupations nécessaires: travailler (pour manger par exemple). Et que plus ils s'amuseront, plus ils ressentiront la douleur par la suite (comme la cigale et la fourmi).<br>  <br>  Il devient donc alors nécessaire de littérallement cacher ces parties du corps tant convoitées afin de pouvoir sois-même  aboutir à ses obligations sans que quelqu'un d'autre ne vienne nous déranger, irristiblement (sexuellement) attiré par ces parties du corps découvertes.<br>  En soit, la pudeur, est donc la peur d'être trop convoité à la recherche du plaisir, celui-ci trop souvent exercé, ne nous donnant ainsi plus le temps de remplir à nos obligations pour notre propre survie.<br>  <br>  Ceci est donc le résumé de ce que je pense de la genèse.<br>  <br>  Note, L'Homme (avec un grand H) désige l'espèce donc l'homme et la femme dans leur ensemble.|`|4hDIIaKfaa	pour justifier que la curiosité des femmes méritait une punition" Tu enfanteras dans la douleur!"

Nun gibt es mathematische Problemstellungen in denen man ∞ als Zahl interpretieren und damit rechnen will (z.B. auf dem Gebiet der Funktionalanalysis). Man erweitert also den gegebenen Zahlenraum, z.B. auf die sog. "erweitertet reelle Achse" <br>  <br>  "R quer" = R u {-∞, ∞}<br>  <br>  oder mit der Hilfe des Projekttionsraums der Riemanschen Zahlenkugel. (<a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zahlenkugel)" rel="nofollow">http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zahlenkugel...</a><br>  <br>  In beiden F?llen definiert man <br>  <br>  x * ∞ = ∞  für alle x aus R bzw. alle x aus C<br>  <br>  Würde man dein Problem mit einer dieser beiden Mengen beschreiben k?nnen (was nicht der Fall sein muss, so aber natürlich nicht aus deiner Beschreibung hervorgeht). H?tte man nach dem ersten Schritt bereits den Wert ∞ erhalten.<br>  <br>  Nun wirds schwierig. Interpretiert man Ewigkeit ebenfalls mit der Zahl unendlich ist man leicht versucht folgendes zu schreiben:<br>  <br>  (∞ * ∞ ) / ∞ = ∞ /∞ = nicht definiert<br>  <br>  Allerdings gilt stets: erweitern (eines Bruches) ?ndert den Wert der Zahl nicht. Demnach müssten wir immer noch ∞ haben.<br>  <br>  Dies w?re eine L?sung unter der (ziemlich einschr?nkenden) Annahme dass dein "Unendlich" sich mit der Zahl ∞ aus einem dieser beiden R?ume identifizieren l?sst. Grunds?tzlich ist beim rechnen mit unendlichkeit gro?e Vorsicht geboten.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Ok, ich bin mit der zweiten Aussage nicht wirklich glücklich. Die Aussage über die Erweiterung ist nicht auf den Wert ∞ unendlich übetragbar, denn sonst würde <br>  1 = 1 * ∞ / 1* ∞ = ∞ / ∞ <br>  implizieren dass 1/∞ das inverse zu ∞ was eben grade nicht zwingend der Fall ist.

sRvHkvJ2aa	A radius is half the diameter of a circle.<br>  A diameter is the longest possible line you can draw within a circle.<br>  Pi is a number, close to 3.1415, that people have found have interesting properties with regards to circles and angles. It's ubiquitous in trigonometry.<br>  A constant is any coefficient in an equation that does not vary. For instance, in the line y = 2x, 2 is a constant. If I were to tell you that y = Ax and A is a constant, y and x may change, but A will not.<br>  <br>  By the way, if you're wondering about the formula for the area of a circle, it's pi r^2. Pi is a constant - that is, it's a fixed number that doesn't change. r is a variable, that represents the radius of a circle - this will change from case to case.|`|skGZk140aa	Regard a circle (d = diameter)<br>  The circumference is d * PI, <br>  thus Circumference / d = PI<br>  That's true for all circles, thus PI is a constant|`|Q7ovix19aa	I MADE A SERIOUS MISTAKE IN THE AREA DIFFERNTIAL.  LOOK AT THIS VERSION.<br>  <br>  It's defined as the ratio of the circumference of a circle to it's diameter.  I think it's derived by measuring how many arcs the length of the radius fit around the circumference of a semicircle.  The angle one arc produces is called a radian.  There are 2pi radians in a full circle, and of course 1pi in the semicircle.<br>  <br>  Often radians are used instead of degrees, particularly in calculus because the equations regarding linear measurements (radius, diameter circumference, and area) can relate directly from angles measured in radians.<br>  <br>  Then the circumference (C) of the circle would be 2π times the arc equal to the radius, 2π X r = π2r.  Since 2r = diameter (D), C = πD   (π is the Greek letter "pi" and I used capital letters here only because I used "d" later and I didn't want to confuse you more than I already have/will).<br>  <br>  The next part deals with calculus.  If you don't want to fry your brain some at this point, just skip it.  You should have some idea by now.<br>  <br>  The area of a circle is found by integrating the differential r(dθ):  Area = integral of r(dθ) from 0 to 2π radians [r is the radius, d means "the differential of" and a differential is an infinitesimally small change, θ (Theta) was the most popular Greek letter used to represent an angle, π (pi) is the Greek letter that represents what you ask about.<br>  <br>  You integrate it by increasing the tiny angle, dθ, from 0 to 2π the integral will be (2π r^2)/2 = π r^2.  The division by the new higher order is done with integration  (differentiation lowers the order and we then multiply its result by the original higher order).|`|Y5J8FXg3aa	Hi, <br>  <br>  Pi or π is a mathematical constant whose value is the ratio of any circle's circumference to its diameter in Euclidean space; this is the same value as the ratio of a circle's area to the square of its radius. It is approximately equal to 3.14159 in the usual decimal notation. It is also an irrational number, which means that its value cannot be expressed exactly as a fraction m/n, where m and n are integers.<br>  <br>  A constant in mathematics is an amount that does not change, over time or otherwise: it is a fixed value.<br>  <br>  Radius is half the length of a diameter (a straight line connecting any 2 points on a circle)|`|oKFAt7Lsaa	If you look at any circle of any size you will find that the circumference divided by its diameter ALWAYS gives the same answer a number aproximately 22/7 which we call pi.<br>  <br>  This number can be used to find the area of the cirlcle by using a formula (pi)r^2= Area<br>  The voulme of a cylinder or a sphere , a cone or there surface areas also use formula that contain this special number pi or 22/7.

4a82252f380573f92eb2ac8bdbd8b46baa	Da un punto di vista lstrettamente logico si può quindi considerare vera anche la frase contraria, ovvero che per quanto ne sabbiamo oggi è anche possibile che qualcuno abbia creato la materia. Infatti che sia possibile che nessuno l'abbia creata non esclude la possibilità contraria e sempre per quanto ne sappiamo oggi. Ma tutto sta ad intendersi sul significato di materia e in un ambito ancora logico dobbiamo necessariamente ammettere che nulla può venire dal nulla. Quanto alla vita essa è un tipo particolare di rapporto che certi tipi di entità complesse hanno con il mondo, di certe parti col tutto, con l'ambiente che le circonda. Forse questa possibilità è già presente come potenzialità nelle particelle subatomiche quando danno luogo a determinate configurazioni sufficientemente lontane dallo stato di equilibrio, ma che godono di una stabilità di tipo dinamico ciclico e interattivo. Forse c'è voluto un intervento divino perché la sinfonia potesse suonare gli accordi giusti e in tal caso Dio è proprio questa vita già presente da sempre nell'universo che attua se stessa attraverso la materia. Forse le due ipotesi possono inaspettatamente incontrarsi in una mente che sappia aprire se stessa.|`|9a6iNXlvaa	Mi piace Margherita Hack, decisamente è intelligente in misura inversamente proporzionale alla sua bellezza.<br>  <br>  Un giorno ad una mia ex dissi "hai il viso di Margherita Hack, sai l'astrofisica..." da allora di me non ne volle più sapere!|`|JczXssmRaa	Secondo me sì...è una proprietà che insorge da particolari combinazioni della materia, cioè le molecole organiche...mi riferisco a proteine, zuccheri, acidi nucleici,etc che sono i "mattoni" per costruire la vita...|`|UxAftzllaa	certo che è possibile, di cosa ti stupisci?<br>  .... l'aria è materia, le nostre cellule, il nostro cervello ...noi siamo materia... questa è una cosa certa. <br>  E' sempre esistita in forme diverse poi si modifica ...da qui il detto NULLA SI CREA ovvero esiste da sempre (vedi un pò il bing bang...è un'esplosione di materia già esistente)<br>  E NULLA SI DISTRUGGE... può solo trasformarsi no? é effettivamente difficile pensare a qualcosa che non abbia un inizio e una fine, concordo con te; ma forse questo può attribuirsi al semplice fatto che il nostro cervello invece un inizio e una fine ce l'abbia!!!!;-D<br>  ...vedi un pò i legami chimici  e cose di quel genere... tutto si riconduce alla materia<br>  CERTO  spero proprio di non essere solo un agglomerato di cellule.... è abbastanza triste...<br>  spero davvero ci sia dell'altro al di la di questo sinceramente.<br>  Eppoi come può la sola materia inerme generare VITA??<br>  <br>  siiiiiii... c'è qualcosa di piùùù

Il faudra donc 60000 ans pour que l'autre bout de la barre bouge.<br>  <br>  Vu la masse, donc l'inertie d'une barre de cette taille, il appuyer très fort pour déplacer un bout de 2cm.

Eh oui, le mouvement de la barre se traduit au niveau moléculaire par le déplacement des atomes sous l'effet des forces fondamentales: gravité, éléctromagnétisme et forces nucéaires, qui elle mêmes ne se transmettent qu'à la vitesse de la lumière.

e6f5d94c97e40bd8daccc0d779635b8aaa	la différence entre la fa?on de faire l’amour de l’homme et celle de la femme est le suivant: la femme, pendant l’acte amoureux, n’a pas de direction précise, elle ne suit pas quelque chose de précis mais vit avec une grande intensité toutes les sensations et les perceptions érotiques. C’est pour cela qu’il est difficile que l’homme comprenne son comportement, lui ayant un but précis: l’orgasme. La femme a plus de besoin d’un état érotique les premières deux phases de la fusion amoureuse ; si elle essaye d’accélérer la courbe de son orgasme afin de contenter l’homme, elle risque de perdre le contact avec ses sensations personnelles. Au regard de cette situation, tant l’homme que la femme doivent conna?tre leur rythme personnel et en même temps tenir compte des désirs et des états de l’autre. Et ainsi, tout le jeu amoureux peut être décrit comme une danse extatique où les protagonistes sont les deux amoureux. <br>   <br>  Une autre différence importante est celle du rythme, qui fait que l’orgasme féminin nécessite une période plus longue pour être atteint. L’orgasme féminin a un caractère implosif, alors que l’orgasme masculin a un caractère explosif. Du fait des différences de temps nécessaires aux deux amoureux pour arriver à l’orgasme, appara?t comme une évidence, la nécessité que l’homme devienne capable de contr?ler et de stopper l’éjaculation. <br>   <br>  En conclusion, on peut dire que l’orgasme féminin et celui masculin se distinguent l’un de l’autre par la fréquence et par le niveau d’implication : les femmes parviennent plus difficilement à l’orgasme, mais une fois atteint, elle le vivent dans tout leur être, prolongeant l’état aux niveaux émotionnel et mental, tandis que les hommes arrivent assez vite à l’état d’orgasme, mais dans les premières phases, ils le vivent très intensément seulement au niveau physique, corporel. Donc, pour atteindre l’orgasme simultané prolongé, la femme devra rester en phase avec l’excitation sexuelle pour arriver au plus souvent à l’orgasme, pendant que l’homme devra s’ouvrir de plus en plus au niveau énergétique pour étendre l’énergie résultante del’orgasme dans tout son corps et tout son être.|`|Ch9odtocaa	c'est quand tu allume la mèche de ton tampax pour te faire sauter......et cela est mortellement bon....|`|W41Zd6Iyaa	Implosif!!???je ne connaissais pas!! peut etre explosif non?<br>  BISES!|`|c0Bj2hLmaa	c'est un orgasme solitaire , personnel  qui se déclenche , quand on est en manque de l'autre par sa pensée  et la force amoureuse qui nous unis a l'autre , on en meurt pas , mais cela peut aller jusqu'à l'évanouissement  c'est très rare  et c'est une fusion amoureuse de deux être ou un amour très fort pour quelqu'un qui nous dépasse|`|2br29Q4Zaa	orgasme intérieure plus intense, ?a ravive|`|6N0BjQg6aa	ca peut une bonne pipe une bonne ligne tu te chies dessus la merde et ca pue dedans|`|YKLCE7YZaa	si tu à était opère de la prostate tu à une jouissance implosive.HI..HI......<br>  ou tu préfère celle ci:<br>  <br>   c'est de passer de l'orgasme génital, à celui de cérébrale.|`|fcefa7e0c7d821691d7755147b404337aa	c'est un truc qui te pete dans la gueule , et aprés t'en a partout ...Mais c'est trop bon|`|jk3Qk3k0aa	LA TéLéVISION QUAND ELLE REND SON DERNIER SOUPIR|`|snQFviZ2aa	Je suis d'accord avec l'explication de Carnelle sur la signification de l'orgasme implosif comparé à celui dit explosif pour celui des hommes .<br>  Mais comme toute autre sensation forte, celui-ci serait scientifiquement capable de provoquer un arrêt de coeur..<br>  Mais heureusement que ces cas sont très rares...<br>  Good luck|`|seWZxCFSaa	Bonjour !<br>  Regardes ce que je trouve:|`|htQAIPMfaa	C'est le paroxysme voluptueux, on en meurt pas, on peut plus s'en passer.....

If it means the concentration of total ions, that would mean calculating it for the 3 Na+ ions and the one PO4^3- ion that would be generated in dissolving it, but I've never heard of anyone calculating that.<br>  <br>  First, find the number of moles Na3PO4 you will need:<br>  <br>  (0.3 L)(0.500 mol/L) = 0.15 mol Na3PO4<br>  <br>  Next, use the molar mass of Na3PO4 (calculate it from the molar masses listed on the periodic table)<br>  <br>  Na  (22.99 g/mol)(3) = 68.97<br>  P   30.97 g/mol <br>  O  (16.00 g/mol)(4) = 64.00 g/mol<br>  Molar mass = 163.94 g/mol<br>  <br>  Now we'll convert the 0.15 mols Na3PO4 to grams using the molar mass:<br>  <br>  (0.15 mol)(163.94g/mol) = 24.591 g Na3PO4

Easy enough for you to solve.|`|OPHSGKynaa	Well from the first equation, x-2y = 0, we can move the 2y to the other side. This changes the sign giving x=2y.<br>  <br>  So we can plug x = 2y into the third equation, x+y+z = 6. That is, 2y+y+z=6. This is then 3y+z = 6. We can then make this z = 6-3y.<br>  <br>  Plugging this into the 2nd equation, 3y+2z=0, we get 3y+2(6-3y) = 0. Simplifying we have 12-3y = 0. So y = 4. From the equations x = 2y and z = 6-3y, we have x = 2x4 = 8 and z = 6-3x4 = -6.<br>  <br>  So x=8, y=4, and z=-6. Hope it helps. GL

What I would do is find out what the pressure and elevation at which it was sampled and calibrated and write down the pressure and elevation at which you are using it. With this information you should be able to correct your answers. We did it in Chemical Engineering labs in College. Essentially the pressure would change from day to day +- 10 mmHg but we were trying to be exact so we would factor the pressure change and correct the measurements using the average pressure. In your case you would correct the measurement using the calibrated pressure.

V2mDAZkKaa	La meiosi è la divisione cellulare tipica delle cellule germinali negli individui a riproduzione sessuata, e presenta due particolarissimi fenomeni nel trattamento delle informazioni: il dimezzamento del genoma, e la generazione di nuove sequenze cromosomiche rispetto a quelle originarie.<br>  Il dimezzamento del numero dei cromosomi nella cellula sessuale matura  (gamete) permette di mantenere costante tale numero nella specie, in quanto in seguito a unione dei gameti dei due sessi, entrambi con numero aploide di cromosomi, si ricostituisce il doppio corredo cromosomico (diploide) tipico delle cellule somatiche, che possiedono una versione paterna e una materna di ciascun cromosoma. La riduzione del materiale genetico avviene in due fasi: nella prima divisione cellulare (meiosi I) il precursore dei gameti replica il DNA, ma durante la divisione cellulare i cromatidi non si separano, per cui ciascuna cellula riceve 23 cromosomi dicromatidici, ossia un solo cromosoma per ciascuna coppia di omologhi. Segue una seconda divisione cellulare (meiosi II) non preceduta da replicazione del DNA, durante la quale i due cromatidi dei 23 cromosomi di ciascuna cellula si separano, ottenendosi alla fine due cellule figlie (da ciascuna delle cellule prodotte dalla meiosi I) con 23 cromosomi monocromatidici, patrimonio che corrisponde al 50% di quello delle cellule somatiche. <br>  <br>  cmq se nn ti è chiaro fai un giro su wikipedia,anche li è spiegato bn <br>  <br>  <a href="http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meiosi" rel="nofollow">http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meiosi</a>|`|SzIDyCo7aa	La meiosi è un processo mediante il quale una cellula eucariotica con corredo cromosomico diploide dà origine a quattro cellule con corredo cromosomico aploide. Potrebbe sembrare molto simile alla mitosi ma, al contrario di questa, tramite il crossing-over, è prodotta la ricombinazione genetica. La diversità genetica viene mantenuta dalla riproduzione sessuata, che comprende cicli cellulari con ricombinazione dell'informazione genetica proveniente da cellule di due organismi differenti (padre e madre). Ogni genitore fornisce un corredo cromosomico detto aploide (cellula uovo nella femmina e spermatozoo nel maschio); la fusione che dà origine ad una singola cellula detta zigote, viene chiamata fecondazione. Lo zigote è dunque necessariamente caratterizzato da un corredo cromosomico diploide; senza meiosi le cellule, solo con la mitosi, avrebbero corredi cromosomici sempre crescenti. Il cariotipo cromosomico è l'insieme del numero, della forma e delle dimensioni dei cromosomi.|`|mMOOOCdLaa	<a href="http://www.studenti.it/medicina/genetica/meiosi.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.studenti.it/medicina/genetica...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.dia.unisa.it/~ads/BIOINFORMATICA/BiologiaMolecolare/pag/meiosi.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.dia.unisa.it/~ads/BIOINFORMAT...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.nonsolofitness.it/argomenti/biologia.asp?biologia=29" rel="nofollow">http://www.nonsolofitness.it/argomenti/b...</a><br>  <a href="http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meiosi" rel="nofollow">http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meiosi</a><br>  <a href="http://ecostudenti.net/appunti/mitosi-e-meiosi/7842/" rel="nofollow">http://ecostudenti.net/appunti/mitosi-e-...</a><br>  Spero che ti siano di aiuto.<br>  Ciao.|`|SFDWUVkqaa	ecco la risposta|`|91eMqQwsaa	ciao!<br>  <br>  tu chiedi il significato e non come si svolge giusto?<br>  il significato della meiosi è di ottenere cellule aploidi (spermatozoi e oociti) che dopo la fecondazione andranno a costituire lo zigote diploide che darà origine ad un nuovo individuo.

If there is enough sugar in the surrounding solution, the potato cells will plasmolyse. <br>  <br>  From Wikipedia:  "Plasmolysis is the process in plant cells where the plasma membrane pulls away from the cell wall due to the loss of water through osmosis".   <br>  <br>  Just guessing, because I don't have your results in front of me, but:<br>  - Your third solution (100 ml water & 5 tsp sugar) would probably be hypertonic enough to cause plasmolysis;<br>  - Your second solution (100 ml water & 2 tsp of sugar) might not cause plasmolysis, though the potato cells would probably lose some water.  <br>  - Your first solution might not be hypertonic to the potato cells.  It might be isotonic or even hypotonic.  If it is isotonic, nothing would happen to your potato cells.  If it is hypotonic, your potato cells would swell with water from the solution (i.e., the osmosis would go in the other direction).<br>  <br>  In your experiment, the cell membrane or plasma membrane around each potato cell is the semi-permeable membrane across which osmosis can occur.<br>  <br>  OSMOSIS is the passive net movement of WATER (never solutes) from a region of LOW concentration OF SOLUTES to a region of HIGH concentration OF SOLUTES through a SEMI-PERMEABLE MEMBRANE along a concentration gradient. (The solute in your experiment was the sugar). <br>  <br>  You could also say that OSMOSIS is the passive net movement of WATER from a region of HIGH “concentration OF WATER” to a region of “LOW concentration WATER” through a semipermeable membrane along a concentration gradient, but the "concentration of water" is an awkward concept.<br>  <br>  If you need any further explantion, read my answer to "What happens to plant cell when plasmaysed?" which is a resolved question asked by "Jess S'.

FRFytb0Naa	The second moment of area, also known as the area moment of inertia or second moment of inertia is a property of a shape that can be used to predict the resistance of beams to bending and deflection. The deflection of a beam under load depends not only on the load, but also on the geometry of the beam's cross-section. This is why beams with higher area moments of inertia, such as I-beams, are so often seen in building construction as opposed to other beams with the same area. It is analogous to the polar moment of inertia, which characterizes an object's ability to resist torsion.

One example is the west side of South America.  Also occurs at divergent boundaries (ie, the mid ocean ridge).

This is because the ocean is closing and the floor is subducting under the lighter continental crusts of the Americas and Asia. Think of Chile. Japan, Alaska, Costa Rica, Indonesia etc.  There are no volcanos on inactive margins like the east coast of the americas or west coast of Europe for example.   <br>  <br>  Some can also be found around the Mediterranean Sea which used to be much bigger and is now nearly closed. <br>  <br>  As a side I just want to remind some people that when you ask where in the world this doesn't mean where in America.  There is a great big world out there.

4CMENEKnaa	Assuming a woman were naked, it is possible a thermal imaging camera might be able to tell if a woman were pregnant or not.  However, there are a few qualifications.  First, recent research has shown thermal imaging cameras can be used to study sexual response in women:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.physorg.com/news91439130.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.physorg.com/news91439130.html</a><br>  <br>  So given that this is possible, if there were some sort of physiological response in womens' genitals due to pregnancy, it might be possible to see it using an infrared camera (thermal imager).  However, to my knowledge there haven't been any studies showing whether it is, or isn't, possible.  Therefore, it stands in the category of "might be possible."|`|0d1962ce76e34fe5748f85b8939585edaa	Definitely not. A thermal imaging camera will pick up on heat, but since any foetus would have the same temperature as the surrounding tissue (mother's body) then nothing would show.<br>  <br>  These cameras can see heat through walls if the heat from the source is allowed sufficient time to travel through the wall.|`|DO1ebm95aa	Not directly.  Thermal imaging cameras don't "see through" things, even though you see this in the movies sometimes.  The only exception is that they can sometimes see through certain types of smoke and some other rare materials (such as sheer fabric) that are transparent to longer wavelengths but opaque to visible light.  The only things that see into the human body are ultrasound, x ray, and MRI devices, which all require your knowledge and cooperation to use.<br>  <br>  What a thermal imaging camera would show is your body surface temperature--typically your extremities would be darker and your central areas would be lighter in color because they are warmer.  I say that it might be able to indirectly detect pregnancy because at some point in time pregnancy affects your body temperature.  One might be able to infer that there are metabolic changes in your body by observing changes in your body surface temperature and temperature distribution.<br>  <br>  In other words, if you're wondering whether someone might find out, the biggest give-away is a growing belly and a changing appetite, which becomes more obvious quite a few months into the pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Additional info:  Once heat travels through something by conduction, it is no longer directional (like heat radiation off of the surface of a body).  So given enough time for human in an enclosed room to heat up the walls, the walls will all glow relatively evenly, possibly indicating that something warm resides there, but you will not see an "image" of a human through a wall or through anything (through a woman's tummy) no matter how long you wait.  The only exception to this is that if you were to press your body against a very thin wall, your heat would conduct to the opposite side in the shape of a human outline, just like ink soaking through a page. <br>  <br>   I have actually done this with my hand and a piece of paper with a thermal imaging camera.  The paper is completely opaque to the camera.  With a hand held close to the paper, it starts to glow as it warms up.  Only when you press your hand up directly against the paper does an image of your hand appear because the heat is basically drawing its image by conduction through the thin paper.  This would not work nearly as well with an insulated wall.  You might detect a warm spot on the opposite side.

zFsTSrOcaa	The closest thing to a standard equation for calculating the distance to an object involves the redshift-distance relationship.  Because space is expanding, objects appear to be moving apart, and the speed of separation is proportional to the distance between the objects.  See link for a calculator (enter the redshift, get the distance).  Since this calculation does not account for any motion of the objects themselves through space, it is most useful for large distances (millions to billions of light-years) where the expansion rate is much greater than any relative motion between the objects.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, we have to use the methods you've mentioned (parallax, standard candles).

For example 6-Al2O3, there are 12 Aluminum (6*2) and 18 Oxygen (6*3). this is basically seen when you balance chemical equations.|`|CKE9oLlZaa	are you studying chemistry because you want to? Chlorine is a diatomic molecule and can't exist (easily) naturally as a single atom because it pairs with itself. (hydrogen (H2), nitrogen (N2), oxygen (O2), and the halogens: fluorine (F2), chlorine (Cl2), bromine (Br2), iodine (I2), and, perhaps, astatine (At2).other diatomics are possible, such as gaseous metals. The large number is telling you how many moles of the element, molecule or compound there are in an equation. The small number is there to show how many atoms there are. (it only applies to the atoms that it appears immediately after, where as the large number in front applies to every atom in the element, molecule or compound.) <br>  You will do a lot better to look in wikipedia or a text book and famiarise yourself with any given term that you come across. I promise you, faithfully, that although time consuming at first, you will spend less and less time doing so as you go along. Get to know your periodic table by doing lots of equations.|`|3WsSOptuaa	1) In nature, elements are rarely found as they are presented on the periodic table.  As is typical with several other gases, Cl as the element is usually found Cl2, or chlorine gas, in nature.  Other examples are H2, hydrogen gas, and N2, nitrogen gas.<br>  <br>  2)The small numbers after the element mean that they are joined together.  H2O implies that there are 2 hydrogen atoms and 1 oxygen atom that are joined, in this case by a bond.  But, a big number in the beginning tells you that you have x number of the following elements/molecules.  Like 3 H20 means you have 3 water molecules [even though if you multiply this out you have 6 H atoms and 3 O atoms].|`|811e85ac0ec3c30f0a5df20da0063fe8aa	Chlorine as an element is so unstable that it will bond with itself to form a Chlorine molecule.

In this way you know there are 6 chlorine molecules or 12 chlorine atoms.  Then when you move to the product side of the reaction equation you can count up atoms and molecules to be sure you have the right number.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!!!<br>  <br>  (by the way, Hydrogen is also H(small 2) even without the Oxygen in water.|`|CpbrMYykaa	Ok, well the big number before the formula/symbol is a coefficient and the small number is subscript.

The 7 means that there are  7 molecules/moles of O2 and the 2 means there are 2 atoms of O in the compound. <br>  <br>  Now to answer your question about Cl2. Cl2 is diatomic which means that Chlorine will never exist as Cl, it's always Cl2. Bromine, Iodine, Nitrogen, Chlorine, Hydrogen, Oxygen and Fluorine are elements that will never exist as a simgle atom.

It doesn't exist as Cl, if it is in solution it immediately grabs an electron and becomes Cl-. <br>  <br>  The little numbers after an element refer to how many atoms of those elements are present in that particular compound.  <br>  <br>  The big numbers in an equation (always before a molecule) refer to the number of moles (or molecules) of that compound that are involved in a reaction.|`|ckzVDpNpaa	Cl2 is that way because it is a diatomic molecule, meaning that it naturally occurs as two chlorine molecules bound together. Oxygen is the same as well as some others. <br>  The small number is a subscript which refers to the number of individual elements in a compound e.g. CO2 (1 carbon, 2 oxygen)<br>  The big number before a compound is a coefficient and say how many of the ENTIRE compound there is e.g. 3CO2 (three carbon dioxide molecules) <br>  Hope this helps!|`|k5AkVHKpaa	Cl as an element does not have the 2 subscript, however, because it occurs naturally almost always in pairs (it's diatomic molecule), it is usually written as Cl2. The big numbers before molecules are called coefficients. They represent how many molecules there are in a specific solution (or more specifically how many moles of that molecule there are in the reaction/solution--I'm guessing you don't know what a mole is, and you probably don't need to at this point in your learning, but it is a unit of measurement--you can probably just ignore this part, but I thought I'd add it). The coefficient will vary between problems, but the small numbers (subscripts) will are specific to how a molecule forms, and are representative of how many atoms of that element are found in that molecule. So basically: the small numbers tell how many atoms in a molecule, the big numbers say how many molecules in the reaction.|`|l8TkInj2aa	Cl2 is a molecule 2Cl is two molecules(actually atoms)<br>  Cl2 has covalent bonds with two Cl atoms bonded to each other.<br>  2Cl is not bonded, each Cl is independent, but Cl does not exist by itself, so when it is being produced in a reaction it reacts with another Cl atom and makes Cl2

pOaS9P38aa	The same question was asked by a user called greenflame239 (I think U knw him/her)...and I got the best answer.<br>  <br>  The answer goes like this........<br>  <br>  For most of the life, the typical low-mass stars shine steadily. At its core, the nuclear reactions are burning hydrogen and helium. The star takes about 10 billion years to uses up hydrogen in its core.<br>  <br>  When the star's hydrogen runs out, gravity causes its core to shrink and get hotter. The cooler outer layers expand and glow red. The Star becomes a Red Giant and burns helium in its core. When helium runs out, gravity once again causes the core to collapse.<br>  <br>  Heat from the collapsing core is transferred to the red giant's outer layers, causing a final reaction that blasts off the star's outer layers. A shell of material drifts outward into space, leaving a glowing core. Light from the core often illuminates the cast-off material, which is a planetary nebula<br>  <br>  After a few thousand years, only the core of the original star remains. It glows for a long time as a white dwarf weakly. When it loses the last of its heat, it fades and becomes a black dwarf and disappears.|`|4Qgmvpdhaa	The CNO cycle is the dominant source of energy in stars heavier than about 1.5 times the mass of the sun. The proton-proton chain is more important in stars the mass of the sun or less. This difference stems from temperature dependency differences between the two reactions; pp-chain reactions start occurring at temperatures around ~ 4×106 K, making it the dominant force in smaller stars. <br>  <br>  The CNO chain starts occurring at ~ 13×106 K, but its energy output rises much faster with increasing temperatures. At ~ 17×106 K, the CNO cycle starts becoming the dominant source of energy. The sun has a temperature of around ~ 15.7×106 K and only 1.7% of 4He nuclei being produced in the Sun are born in the CNO cycle.|`|bMKj15Wqaa	The research required for this answer shows low-mass stars have different stellar evolutionary paths than high-mass stars, including the resulting remnants or objects such as brown/white dwarfs and black holes. I've gone through many sites and listed a few of the good ones below. Some of the infomation is old, but stellar evolution has been researched for a long time.
ef757850cc59f43c0381f68fd6b30bc3aa	The best way to play with trig identities is to convert everything to sine and cosine.  You can can convert any given trig function to sine and cosine.<br>  <br>  Try it.<br>  <br>  Guido|`|f896fb2755e9ba1bf76a0ecfb72d8128aa	I always convert everything to sines and cosines.<br>  <br>  sec = 1/cos<br>  csc = 1/sin<br>  <br>  ... and, of course,<br>  tan = sin/cos<br>  cot = cos/sin<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!|`|3f2zjD7Naa	first of all the csc is the recipricol of sin<br>  so is sec for cos and cot for tan<br>  solving for identity requires you to know which quadrant are you in so you know how much possible answers are there<br>  secondaly know the ratio rules and that if r ^2 = y^2 +x^2 <br>  that r cant be negative .<br>  i hoped that helped you|`|AA11578508	I had alot of trouble with this subject. I found that the best way to solve for this was simply to substitute all terms with those of the identities we learned. I don't think there's any solid way to find an answer to these problems with any consistency.|`|DmzNwPJEaa	here is a general rule for establishing identities....<br>  dont focus on changing everything to sines or cosines, buut rather convert to the side you are not using....<br>  for example:<br>  sin * cos * tan = csc * sec   (please note, this is not true)<br>  <br>  if you are going to operate on the left side, try to convert these things to csc or sec, this is true for many of the simpler identities.  Also, you must remember the pythagorean identities.  They are used much more, especially with squared values.<br>  so basically, dont always focus on converting to sin or cos, unless you have a lot of tangents to the first power, regular tangents are usually best expressed as sin/cos for the sake of cancelling out terms when multiplying.<br>  <br>  hopefully this gives you some insight on establishing identities in the future.|`|s1Mqdn8Maa	Basically sec is 1/cos(x) and csc is 1/sin(x).  It's just another way of writing the same terms.
a437a81a81df77e02521124f95502e21aa	Sure.  In fact, G?del proved that in any formal system of axiomatized mathematics, there will always be at *least* one statement which is true (in the sense that it does not violate any of the axiomatized rules) but which is unprovable (in the sense that it cannot be derived from the axioms of the system).  This is called 'G?dels Incompleteness Theorem'.<br>  <br>  HTH ?<br>  <br>  Doug'
WVPYem5Vaa	Sound is a vibration that propagates along a medium as a mechanical wave. If a physical object vibrates at a certain frequency, the vibrations are imparted to the surrounding medium through energy dispersal, and when these vibrations reach our eardrums, they can be interpreted as sound, as long as the vibrations are of sufficient frequency and energy to fall within the human ability to hear them (e.g. humans cannot hear sounds below 20 Hz).

Fn5gpDOKaa	No, We call -273 degrees as absolute zero 'cause at this temperature all the motions of a subatomic particle(except vibrational one) ceases, and therefore it becomes somewhat inert. <br>  But on the other hand, if we keep on heating, the energy level of the subatomic particle will keep on increasing, and it will become more and more reactive and unstable, and its internal energy will keep on increasing. And in short there's no end to it.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped....|`|zR7ZqoxIaa	as far as i concern, there is no highest possible temperature. you can go as far as you can. it's because when gas are heated, it will change to plasma. so, as human keep finding new state of matter, there is still no highest possible temperature.|`|4ELJgnWbaa	no

(4)<br>  From (3) and (4) ==> OABC is a parallelogram|`|JDK33laKaa	The diagonals cut the quadrilateral into four triangles. If the diagonals bisect each other, each pair of triangles which are opposite each other are congruent because two sides and an included angle are the same (the so called side-angle-side test for congruent triangles). Thus, opposite sides of the quadrilateral are equal. Therefore, quadrilateral is a parallelogram.
nS7koC7Oaa	Well reinforcing steel rods act like a filler in a composite material of concrete matrix, composite materials have been physically assembled to form one single bulk without physical blending to foam a homogeneous material. The resulting material would still have components identifiable as the constituent of the different materials (i.e. steel and concrete),,|`|iTS8qJfoaa	Concrete has remarkable performance in compression, but is poor in tension.  Conversely, steel performs great in tension but poorly in compression.  The reinforcing rods embedded in concrete lend some of their tensile strength to the overall structure.

vEqUqlliaa	In mathematics, a prime number (or a prime) is a natural number which has exactly two distinct natural number divisors: 1 and itself.<br>  <br>  One method for determining whether a number is prime is to divide by all primes less than or equal to the square root of that number. If any of the divisions come out as an integer, then the original number is not a prime. Otherwise, it is a prime. One need not actually calculate the square root; once one sees that the quotient is less than the divisor, one can stop. More precisely, the last prime factor possibility for some number N would be Prime(m) where Prime(m + 1) squared exceeds N. This is known as trial division; it is the simplest primality test and it quickly becomes impractical for testing large integers because the number of possible factors grows too rapidly as the number-to-be-tested increases.<br>  <br>  but following points will speed up prime number calculations, so remember them:<br>  <br>  - If a number is even, unless it is 2 it is always composite<br>  <br>  -If a number's digits add up to a number which is divisible by 3, it is divisible by 3 and therefore composite.<br>  (246 -> 2+4+6=12 12/3=4 therefore it is composite)<br>  <br>  Rather large numbers-  for example sake I'll use the number 2,321<br>  <br>  1) Find the square root of the number (The Square root of 144 is 12 because 12*12=144) <br>  <br>  - The Square root of 2,321 is 48.176...<br>  <br>  2) remember that if the square root results in an integer it is automatically composite<br>  <br>  3) if your number ends in a 0,2,4,5,6,8 it is NOT PRIME<br>  - 2,321 ends in a 1, so we keep going<br>  <br>  4) add up the digits of your number, if the sum is divisible by 3, your number is composite<br>  -2+3+2+1= 8,  3 does not go into 8 evenly- onto the next<br>  step<br>  <br>  5) Divide the number by all the prime numbers less than the square root (you can skip 2, 3, and 5)<br>  -since the square root of 2,321 is 48.176..., we need to<br>  try dividing 2,321 by primes less than 48<br>  (7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37,41,43,47) since 2,321 is<br>  divisible by 11, it is NOT prime and therefore composite.<br>  <br>  6) If a number is not divisible by any of the prime numbers less than the square, it is PRIME, if it is, it's COMPOSITE<br>  <br>  -mohit|`|ffe04ac4fefbb1ae0a7bd8d06171e322aa	A prime numbe cannot be divided into by any number but itself.

I hate waste and I wish there was a way to utilize it. Other than that, cars will probably be able to run on solar panels in the future. They already run on hydrogen and electric fuel cell batteries. Large vehicles will probably continue to run on petroleum based fuels until we exhaust that resource, however.<br>  <br>  I'm not really a scientist or anything like that (obviously) but I hope scientists are looking into a way to make energy out of garbage and feces. It would be very smart in my opinion.|`|Ovj9hjMPaa	Souls of the damned... and kangaroo leavings.
AA11029265	You're basically doing a calorimetry experiment.  The single biggest problem is that you don't appear to have calibrated the calorimeter w/ a known standard fuel to determine the heat capacity of the apparatus.  You're simple measuring the change in temperature of the water, but are not accounting for the heat capacity of the copper beaker, which is also absorbing heat, nor of any heat lost to the atmosphere.<br>  <br>  Also, an open flame burner is not a good way to transfer all the energy from the fuel to the water.  You may have incomplete combustion, and heat will be lost to the atmosphere.  Typically, calorimetry is best done in a bomb calorimeter, where fuel and oxygen are mixed in a sealed steel container when is then submerged in water, the fuel / O2 mix ignited, and the total change in temp of the system is then recorded.<br>  <br>  However, if you are stuck using your existing apparatus, calibrate it with a fuel whose energy content you know.  After you burn a known mass of fuel, calculate the temperature rise of the water.  If your beaker is pure copper, weigh that as well and calculate how much heat it will absorb (look up Cu specific heat).  Add all that together and then figure out how much heat was absorbed by the cu / water, and how much was lost to the outside environment.  Once you know those figures, you will be better able to estimate the energy content of your unknown samples.

Even if two snowflakes are the same shape, it is basically impossible that they'll be exactly the same size, same thickness, etc...<br>  <br>  A snowflake begins to form when water vapor condenses around a speck of dust high in the clouds—up to six miles (ten kilometers) up—and then crystallizes.<br>  <br>  How the water vapor keeps on condensing and where the snowflake falls "is what determines the way the snowflake, or snow crystal, looks when it lands on your coat sleeve,It is extremely sensitive to microenvironments.<br>  <br>  Between 27oF and 32oF (-2.8oC and 0oC), for example, crystals take the form of six-sided plates. Below that, needles form. A few degrees colder yields hollow columns; chillier yet, fernlike stars.<br>  <br>  If temperatures drop further, plates and columns form again.<br>  <br>  These crystals—usually six-sided because of the way hydrogen atoms bond with oxygen to create water—may eventually sprout branches, which continue to grow as additional water molecules cluster on the crystals' surfaces. <br>  <br>  Humidity also plays a role. Drier air encourages growth across flat surfaces, for example, while higher humidity encourages growth at the tips, edges, and corners. More water vapor also leads to faster-growing and more intricate crystals.<br>  <br>  To further complicate matters, as a crystal falls, frost could freeze to it or another passing flake could break off some of the crystal's branches. Even the the approach of a water drop can influence how a branch grows.<br>  <br>  By the time it reaches Earth, it may not have any resemblance to the very simple crystal that it started out as six miles up.|`|2lQ8DJAcaa	since snowflake growth is a result of the environment, even the smallest temperature and humidity difference will affect the shape of the snowflake. If the changes occur on a length-scale smaller than the snow crystal itself, then the snow crystal will be irregular (as many of the snowflakes in nature are). Radially symmetric snow crystals form because every part of the snowflake was subjected to the same conditions at the same time, so seeing similar snowflakes is more common when they are very small.<br>  |`|AVjUNU5waa	cuz the clouds and sky isnt always exactly the same it snows differently every time|`|nCGPqi9Gaa	Because snow flakes form from water droplets into frozen crystals as they are falling from the sky. The way the crystal forms depends on things like temperature, wind, how big they were to start out with, minerals in that drop, ph, humidity, etc and how they all change and relate during the decent. So it would be Extremely difficult to reproduce the Exact same circumstances for two snow flakes.|`|RqpSMJGuaa	No two LARGE snowflakes will be alike<br>  HOWEVER<br>  Some smaller crystals that not have fully formed may be alike <br>  <br>  Quoting: <br>  <br>  "It is probably safe to say that the possible number of snow crystal shapes exceeds the estimated number of atoms in the known universe," Nelson said. <br>  <br>  Still, while "no two snowflakes are alike" might hold true for larger snowflakes, Nelson figures it might ring false for smaller crystals that sometimes fall before they have a chance to fully develop."<br>  |`|SaKf9NU9aa	Just because of the randomness of nature.  Falling water freezes and turns to snow in whatever way it does.  It's like throwing a glass of paint on a canvass.  Now use the same cup, same amount, same conditions and do it again, and it will be different.  Chaos theory.|`|h3WtnrRTaa	snowflakes are water crystals on dust in the atmosphere. Since each dust piece is different, each crystal forms different.|`|imgKqm9Laa	The molecules of water can be arranged in an infinite number of different ways. Temperature, air pressure, wind speed, earth's rotation, energetic particles streaming by, etc. etc..... all play small parts in the formation of the ice crystals. Since the number of ways this can happen is virtually unmeasurable, it never happens the same way twice!!<br>  <br>  Also, super small parameters can ultimately have huge effects on the way a system organizes. Like they say that a flapping of a butterfly's wings today can ultimately effect wind patterns around the world and possibly lead to a hurricane a hundred years from now. Although possibly impossible to trace it back, a certain butterfly in the exact right place at the right time can have control of the path a hurricane takes!<br>  <br>  You can learn more about these phenomena by reading the book A New Kind of Science, or looking up cellular automata in wikipedia...<br>  |`|61229a5edd65b7a3460d98d36aeb272aaa	I think that is something that cannot be proved or disproved. There is probably no number that can define the number of snowflakes that have fallen but I would take a guess that there is some snowflake that came down somewhere in Colorado that is congruent to some flake that fell in upstate New York 2 years later but how could anyone prove it? So because nobody could prove it the people who make up this BS make statements like no 2 are ever alike. These smartypants people say things like if a tree falls in the woods and no one is there does it make a sound. Who cares?|`|q4lAOD6Zaa	There is a widely held belief that no two snowflakes are alike. Strictly speaking, it is extremely unlikely for any two macroscopic objects in the universe to contain an identical molecular structure; but there are, nonetheless, no known scientific laws that prevent it. In a more pragmatic sense, it's more likely—albeit not much more—that two snowflakes are virtually identical if their environments were similar enough, either because they grew very near one another, or simply by chance. The American Meteorological Society has reported that matching snow crystals were discovered in Wisconsin in 1988 by Nancy Knight of the National Center for Atmospheric Research.[citation needed] The crystals were not flakes in the usual sense but rather hollow hexagonal prisms.<br>  <br>  <br>  |`|029887909f8eb9ab8e7c4fdc02241d18aa	my theory would be because the water doesn't freeze the same. it may have similarities to others, but probably has some kind of difference just enough to make it different.|`|BtnntAN3aa	the snowflakes are formed as they are coming down from the clouds because its so cold, soo everyone is formed differently |`|h0Svq8Ggaa	because the water freezes diffrently|`|BBbFW1vlaa	maybe they are like us, It is not common to find identical twins, triplets and so on|`|HYo20GtAaa	well snowflake cant be same<br>  water freezes on low temperatures<br>  or temperatures below 0, and steam is going<br>  higher and higher, and then they starting to freez<br>  it depends on time when they freez<br>  and its not possible to freez in same time<br>  so they have diffrent shapes|`|6fda135f13e3408ad1600d9574ec3091aa	there are snowflakes that are the same. snow has been falling for a looooooooooooooooooooong time and there are snowflakes that are the same.

k5Ece8BTaa	Nothing is going to happen in December 21, 2012. It will be just like any other day. Here is why.<br>  <br>  The theory of the world ending in 2012 isn't true, it's just a silly hoax. The world isn't going to end on December 21, 2012, just the Mayan Calendar ends. One of several Mayan calendars is the Long Count calendar, which is reset to day 0 every 1,872,000 days or 7057.5 years. The next reset date, by some calculations, is December 21, 2012. This is not a prediction of the end of the world. The Mayan Calendar has to end sometime. Besides, nobody can't predict when the end of the world is. You shouldn't always believe what you hear from other people. The scientific evidence about 2012 doesn't go together. Those who spread rumors about 2012 should be punished. You know what is sad, people may commit suicide over this thinking its the end of the world. Or maybe some people would get unwise with their money and spend it all like crazy and be in thousands of dollars in debt, just because they thought the world would end. Then they have to pay it off later and deal with the stress of those bills. That's why those who spread rumors about 2012 should be punished. You know what else is false about this 2012 garbage? <br>  <br>  ? Planet X (Nibiru) isn't going to hit the Earth it doesn't exist.<br>  ? Poles are switching everyday, this isn't going to happen all in just 1 day. This process takes thousands of years. Throughout geological history there has been may pole switches and life has still survived.<br>  ? Also people are saying these poles will switch in one day due to a black hole. That's NOT true. The nearest black hole to our galaxy is 1600 light years away.<br>  ? Sun will be lined up with a sunspot, but it doesn't mean it will wipe out all life on Earth. One time ago, Earth was lined up with a sunspot and people were on it and everybody didn't just die.<br>  ? There is not going to be catasphoic earthquakes. <br>  ? In the Bible there is nothing that says the world will end in 2012. They say they got their proof from Revelation 13 and you see the number 666 and that number is just a number in God's book that represents human imperfection. So, 3 of those 6's mean humans are extremely imperfect.<br>  ? Just because certain cultures predict it like the Chinese, Japanese and all of them doesn't mean their predictions are correct. As I said, nobody can predict such a thing.<br>  ? No comment will hit Earth.<br>  <br>  Each time the end the world is predicted. They are always wrong. Here are all the predictions of when the world would end and each time they where wrong. Every year there is a prediction like this. I'm sure that if 2012 doesn't happen, they will think of something else. Through out history the end has been predicted but has never happened so, whats the point of worrying?<br>  <br>  Don't live your life in fear. Just live your life be sucessful in your life by getting good grades, staying in school, going to college, getting promoted at your job, and achieving lots of goals. Don't worry about something this silly. It isn't going to happen! Every few years these silly predictions about the world ending happen. It has happened throughout Human history. Anyways, as from what I just said, you can't predict the future. What if tommarow were the end?

Bp7Yfsqyaa	The Orion program is NASA's replacement for the Space Shuttle, developed under the Vision for Space Exploration outlined by former President Bush.  It's intended to provide crew rotation to the International Space Station, trips to the Moon, and eventually, a vehicle to go to Mars.  It's been dubbed, "Apollo on steroids"<br>  <br>  The "transition" part comes as a result of several things.  The Columbia Accident Investigation Board (CAIB) advised retiring the Space Shuttle as soon as was feasible, and a retirement date of 2010 was selected several years ago.  However, Congress failed to give NASA the monies that would be necessary to simultaneously support the Space Shuttle, the International Space Station, and the Constellation Program (which consists of Ares, the launch vehicles, Orion, the crew vehicle, and Altair, the lunar lander), which, effectively made Orion, "Apollo on welfare".  <br>  <br>  As a result, there will now be a five-year gap between the retirement of the space shuttle in 2010 and the launch of Orion in 2015, and it's too late to shorten that gap.|`|pOaS9P38aa	Orion is a spacecraft design currently under development by the United States space agency NASA. Each Orion spacecraft will carry a crew of four to six astronauts, and will be launched by the Ares I, a launch vehicle also currently under development. Both Orion and Ares I are elements of NASA's Project Constellation, which plans to send human explorers back to the Moon by 2020, and then onward to Mars and other destinations in the Solar System. On August 31, 2006, NASA awarded Lockheed Martin (LM) the contract to design, develop, and build Orion.<br>  <br>  Orion will launch from Launch Complex 39 at Kennedy Space Center, the same launch complex that currently launches the Space Shuttle. While shuttle operations continue from launch pad 39A, 39B is being readied for Ares launches. NASA will use Orion spacecraft for its human spaceflight missions after the last Shuttle orbiter is retired in 2010. The first Orion flight is scheduled for September 2014 with future flights to the International Space Station. If commercial orbital transportation services are unavailable, Orion will handle logistic flights to the Station. After that, Orion is to become a key component of human missions to the Moon and Mars.|`|ftwGaZ4Uaa	Orion is the future capsule which should replace the Shuttle and allow long range exploration missions to Moon and Mars. <br>  <br>  Project Orion was also a study about nuclear spacecraft propulsion in the late 1950s.

The 'Orion program' would refer to basically everything NASA's doing with designing, building, testing and (eventually) using this new space vehicle. Keep in mind that this usage of 'Orion' is distinct from a number of other of uses, including:<br>  - The constellation Orion.<br>  - A hypothetical nuclear pulse drive for spaceships, which has never actually been put into use and would be forbidden by standing nuclear test treaties.<br>  - A fictional star system in the Master of Orion TBS game series.<br>  - A fictional cat in the first Men In Black movie.<br>  Due to the existence of these numerous other uses, and in particular the use referring to a nuclear pulse drive, I for one prefer to call the new vehicle the 'CEV' rather than 'Orion' or 'the Orion vehicle'.

The parents are both genetically normal, and they do not carry a trait for Down's.  Instead, the defect occurs in the ovary (usually of older mothers)  The genetic defect occurs in Meiosis II of egg formation.  The mother has a totally normal genotype for your punnett square, and so does the father.  But when the egg undergoes MII, the 21st chromosome gets pulled into the wrong side.  Then, the egg has TWO of chromosome 21 instead of just ONE, like it is supposed to have ONE of each chromosome.  Then, the dad fertilizes it and he gives his chromosome 21, and then all of a sudden you have a zygote with THREE copies of chromosome 21 instead of two.|`|csYnTVeGaa	Go to these websites and do your own homework<br>  <br>  www.ndss.org/ <br>  <br>  www.nads.org/
gCn6bXAFaa	Everyone above has made excellent points, so I’ll provide another perspective:<br>  <br>  I’m doing research on pollination biology now and I’ve got to say these concerns may be slightly overblown.  <br>  <br>  1.Pollen and nectar are some of the highest quality foods plants produce, nearly pure protein and nearly pure sugar respectively.  Compare that to the plant parts most herbivores consume. Even without the honey bee there are many other species of bees as well as beetles, flies, true bugs, and butterflies that can fill the gap.<br>  <br>  2. Most food crops have reasonable fruit set without the extra help that a few bee hives in the area produce.  So with out bees the price could increase for lots of orchard and cucurbit crops but few (almonds) would disappear from your table altogether. <br>  <br>  3.There are no known plants that depend solely on honey bees for pollination so no plants would go extinct (probably) <br>  <br>  BTW I’ve seen no evidence Einstein actually said that.  The furthest that quote can be traced back in barley 20 years.|`|92f97d29e3d55f3219cc25dfabd347c7aa	Your diet would contain a lot of bread and not as much fruit.<br>  <br>  A lot of plants (wind pollinators are the major exception) rely on bees and other critters for pollination.|`|42e0409e90362644aff2fc3bc0613c70aa	It is not the honey that is important it is the bees themselves.  When the bees are hunting for the nectar to make honey they travel to a lot of different flowers and different plants.  The pollen gets stuck to the hairs on their legs and when they move to another plant some of the pollen falls of and impregnates that flower.  Basically the bees are helping to pollinate all of our flowering plants.  If we lost them the only natural pollinator left would be the wind which is very random.  A lot of plants would not produce seeds or fruits anymore.  We would lose some of our food, and also lose a lot of important nutrients.  We would require a lot of vitamins and supplements to make up for it.<br>  <br>  We would need to come up with an artificial way to help pollinate the plants so that we would not lose them.<br>  <br>  Watch the end of "The Bee Movie", it does show what would happen without bees.  Although, the resolution occurs way to fast and would not happen that way.<br>  <br>  Science is baffled by what is happening to the bees and there is a rush to figure it out so we might stop it from occurring.  There are some ideas of what the cause is, but nothing has been proven yet.|`|So7lXdBKaa	bees pollinate plants and trees without them plants and trees wont grow  crops would fail no fruit no veg  no carbon dioxide or oxygen being naturally produced this would up set the worlds eco system as well as the atmosphere  ,  the green house effect would spiral out of control<br>  <br>  <br>  bees are dying because of the rapid changes of climate and chemicals being sprayed on trees and plants, also there is a virus attacking them|`|t44168wJaa	its not the honey we depend on that is just a nice little byproduct treat, we rely on honeybees to pollinate the plants, fruits and vegetables, that we need to eat and survive if there are no bees it will be a trickle down effect no food for the animals- animals die no food for us we die
4RJKl1aKaa	Parabolic primary mirrors seem to be priced roughly proportional to (aperture in inches)^3, at least at larger, non-mass-produced sizes.  In pounds sterling the figure you get generally isn't that far from the actual price if we are talking about good quality mirrors, but obviously you need a constant of proportionality for other currencies.<br>  <br>  In general there isn't a good formula for calculating price vs aperture, though, since there are so many variables.  Even for parabolic mirrors, faster focal ratios tend to be more expensive since there is more glass to grind out.  Larger scopes frequently have faster focal ratios to keep the size of the scope remotely manageable.  A 26" f/8 primary has a 17' focal length.  A f/4 mirror of the same aperture is half that.|`|AA10811674	Well like the first poster wrote, it depends on the type of telescope. A quality refractor is the most expensive while a Dobsonian mounted reflecting telescope is much much less expensive. There are several factors including the mount, and the cost of making the lens vs. mirror. But in general the most popular amateur telescopes seem to be in the following categories:<br>  <br>  A,. 3 to 4 inch refractors<br>  <br>  B. 8 to 10 inch Dobsonians<br>  <br>  C. 8 to 10 inch Schmidt Cassegrains<br>  <br>  It depends largely on what one will use the telescope for, the budget and need for portability.|`|110fda6e94f73c2bbaae8136ca9a20ddaa	Mirrors are cheaper to make than a lens-- in a refractor.

fLHs5dd1aa	Well, this is an interesting one... the short answer is "no, by Newton's first law". An object at rest will remain at rest until an outside force acts upon it. If your astronaut had, say, a wrench, and threw it- then he could move, by Newton's third law, but the center of mass of the astronaut-wrench system would not move.<br>  <br>  The long answer is a bit more nuanced, and gets into the meaning of motion. If placed in a position with no reference point to determine if you are in fact moving, the notion of motion ceases to exist, as by relativity constant motion and no motion at all are the same. There's also the question of if mass has meaning in a universe with no other masses in it, which makes forces even more difficult to think about. This is something I talk about with my advisor when we're drinking- if mass is a consequence of everything in the universe acting upon you, or whether it's an actual intrinsic quantity.|`|695354591fcd4c8acf43d958f3d5442daa	There is no dead point in space. The body would be attracted by the more dominant gravitational field and begin to move in the direction of the mass causing that field.|`|Nf60Q6UFaa	Uniform motion in a straight line is considered a "relative motion" it has to be compared to something else.  If your hypothetical astronaut is the only thing in the hypothetical universe, then motion is impossible to define, except non-relative motion, like say, rotation.  Also in order for him/her to move, an external force would need to be applied.  If there is a "jet-pack" then the astronaut could move using it, it would expel a burst of gas in one direction, sending the astronaut moving in the other, but now you have more than one object, the astronaut and the quantity of gas which "pushed against" each other, and going in opposite directions, this would be considered an "outside" force.|`|73d140d83d29234efdfa2c38e0168b47aa	To get out of gravity it would be over 300 light years in space.

lIEUegRiaa	If a small chunk was to break off from an asteroid or comet travelling at high speed, then the chunks or debris would have extremely similar orbits and velocities as the main body. You would expect divergent forces to gradually act on the different bodies, but they would still travel in a similar path. <br>  It is entirely reasonable to suggest that recent fireballs may have been related to the flyby body, but it is by no means certain. There was also a collision of two man-made satellites just a few weeks ago, so it is also entirely plausible (despite this being officially denied, which never meant anything anyway) that the fireballs were debris from that collision. <br>  <br>  Mind you, there is already so much debris in near-Earth space, perhaps the fireballs weren't related to the flyby or the collision, and just coincidentally noticed.<br>  <br>  There is also a lot of general natural debris in space, in all kinds of orbits, and objects small enough to only be fireballs (rather than explosive impacts) are not large enough to be catalogued by any of the missions currently searching for comets or asteroids.<br>  <br>  Ultimately, we'll probably never know.|`|AA10811674	Could be.

cOMKOGtyaa	Typically the average ratio between the legs and torso is "1.618", which is the golden ratio in mathmatics (fibonacci sequence). This is counting from the waist down vs. the waist up (including head).  Many of the ratios in measurement between two parts in the human body equals this number. For example, our the top of our head to our chin vs. the width of our head is usually close to 1.61, or is said to be the ideal ratio for beauty.<br>  <br>  Many other golden ratio examples: Nosetip - chin / Lips - Chin , Length of Lips / Width of Nose, Distance between Eyes / Hairline - pupil, etc. If you properly measure yourself and add up the ratios, you'll probably land somewhere between 1.3 and 1.8.<br>  <br>  As for how many heads make up the average length, its typically 7 and a half.

z7BiMSWmaa	1. Cold weather:-<br>  In the United States, most colds occur during the fall and winter. Beginning in late August or early September, the incidence of colds increases slowly for a few weeks and remains high until March or April, when it declines. The seasonal variation may relate to the opening of schools and to cold weather, which prompt people to spend more time indoors and increase the chances that viruses will spread from person to person. <br>  Seasonal changes in relative humidity also may affect the prevalence of colds. The most common cold-causing viruses survive better when humidity is low—the colder months of the year.

DvlwN9kdaa	The Magnetic North Pole is not near the Geographic North Pole.<br>  <br>  I did not know it would spin.  I had thought that in a magnetic field with so little horizontal component that it would be moved only by compass fluid movement.|`|35PAXOv2aa	Earth's magnetic poles are located near, but not quite exactly at, our planet's geographic poles (the "spin axis" on a globe). Compasses work as direction-finding devices because Earth has a magnetic field. The needle of a compass, itself a small bar magnet, points in the direction of the magnetic pole. When you are far from either pole, a compass is very useful for navigation, for the direction it points is pretty close to true North (or South if you are in the Southern Hemisphere). However, if you were near either pole, the magnetic pole and the geographic pole could lie in very different directions (they could even be on opposite sides of you!), so a compass would not be very useful at all.<br>  <br>  If you take a standard compass to the magnetic pole, then the needle, which swings in a horizontal plane is trying to align itself with a vertical field. The result is that the alignment of the needle is meaningless. In practical terms, the needle will probably swing wildly in response to any slight movements of the compass. If you want to know when you have found the magnetic pole, a compass is the worng instrument, what you need is a dip needle.<br>  <br>  A magnetic field that has two poles, like the field around a bar magnet, is called a "dipole field". Earth's magnetic field is pretty much (though not exactly) a dipole field. Earth's dipole is tilted slightly in comparison to its spin axis. The difference between the dipole's orientation and the spin axis is about 11 degrees. If you imagine a giant bar magnet inside Earth, tilted at an 11° angle away from the spin axis, you'll have a sense of what this is like. That's why the magnetic poles and the geographic poles are not in the same place. If you were standing at one of the magnetic poles, the magnetic field lines would be straight up and down. If you were holding a compass and turned it sideways, its needle would be oriented vertically!|`|pOaS9P38aa	So now we know what causes the magnetism that attracts the compass. And we know that the compass nearly always points to magnetic north. So what are those two exceptions? If you were to take a compass and stand just over either the north or the south magnetic pole, you would see the compass spin freely. From the south pole, every direction is north and from the north pole, there is no north. But there is still a way you could know where you were!|`|695354591fcd4c8acf43d958f3d5442daa	The compass needle will not spin when you are over the magnetic north pole, it will drift randomly and not take up a steady position.

cOMKOGtyaa	When weak molecular bonds split, free radicals are formed. Free radicals react quickly with other compounds, trying to capture the electron to gain stability. When the "attacked" molecule loses its electron, it becomes a free radical itself, beginning a chain reaction. <br>  <br>  Basically free radicals disrupt our cells production and cause aging as our body doesn't have enough cells to replace skin tissue and such. By eating foods with antioxidants, such as dark fruit and vegetables, the vitamins (such as vitamin E and D) in  molecules donate their own electrons so our cells don't have to. This is said to slow aging.|`|NNiN0tK0aa	They are responsible for the damage to the lungs seen in the disease emphesyma.

KJHw0oI3aa	Question 24:<br>  A solution has a lower vapor pressure than pure solvent, because the dissolved particles interfere with the evaporation, so that less vapor is produced.<br>  <br>  Question 25:<br>  Again, the reason is the same as for question 24.  A liquid boils when its vapor pressure equals the atmospheric pressure.  It takes more heat (and a higher temperature) to generate enough vapor pressure to equal the atmospheric pressure when a solute is added.  At the other end, to freeze, molecules of a solvent must arrange themselves into a regular crystal lattice.  When particles of solute are present, they get in the way of regular crystal lattice, and it takes lower temperature to finally freeze a solution.<br>  <br>  Question 26:<br>  The more particles are dissolved per unit volume, the higher the boiling point of the solution.  Therefore, the higher concentration of the solution, the higher its boiling point.  In other words, a concentrated sodium fluoride solution would have a higher boiling point than a dilute solution.<br>  <br>  Question 27:<br>  One mole of KI dissociates into two moles of ions:  <br>  KI --> (K+) + (I-)<br>  One mole of MgF2 dissociates into three moles of ions:  <br>  MgF2 --> (Mg2+) + 2 (F-)<br>  <br>  The solution with more particles (ions) will have a higher boiling point, lower vapor pressure, and lower freezing point.<br>  <br>  a. higher boiling point:  MgF2<br>  b. higher vapor pressure:  KI<br>  c. higher freezing point:  KI

As for C, centrifugal force would only partially offset gravity at some places in most stars of reasonable size and mass and rate of spin.  (If centrifugal force is equal to gravity, then the particles are effectively in orbit around the star and not really part of the star).  So B is the only semi-reasonable answer although saying heat causes the pressure and leaving it at that leaves something to be desired.<br>  <br>  And some stars collapse and become so dense that only their quantum degeneracy pressure holds them out.

Your next line is y=x+1. Do the same as the last equation and get the two points that are (0,1)(1,2). The last equation is y=1/3x. For this equation you have to plug in x and y values that will be accurate. If x is 3 y must be 1. If x is 6 y must be 2.

If you increased to 70mph in 10 seconds, your acceleration would be 1mph squared, because your speed increased 1mph each second. then once you kept driving at 70mph constantly, your acceleration would be 0.<br>  <br>  So pretty much when you drop the cart, it's constantly getting faster at 9.8m/s squared, because it is being pulled down by the gravity of the earth.<br>  <br>  Velocity is speed. They're the same. It's usually measured in meters per second.|`|Cg9QYJORaa	The body is constantly accelerating, so therefore the speed is gradually increasing at a constant rate. As the speed goes higher and higher, the amount of time it takes to cover a certain amount of distance gets shorter. As a result, the graph takes on a curved shape, as the body gets faster. Although the acceleration is constant, the speed changes. It increases. It covers distance faster so the slope of the line gets steeper.<br>  Also, speed is the same thing as velocity, except velocity can be positive or negative, in opposite directions, and speed only accounts for movement and not the direction traveled.|`|ce1KbZBDaa	Ok, the graph was a curve because as the distance increases, the time is steadily decreasing at a changing rate due to the constant acceleration. That explains why it is a curve.<br>   Also, the velocity vs time graph was a straight line because as the acceleration increases, the velocity increase, as does the time.<br>   V vs T graphs are Velocity versus. Time graphs. The time taken normally goes along the x axis, whislt velocity goes along the y axis.<br>   Finally, the difference between velocity and speed is that velocity is speed, but in a certain direction, whereas speed can be in any direction.|`|qtxhN4ixaa	its a nice one the ramp that was allowed it to glide down the rail is not at constant acceleration  so it must be curve<br>  and about velocity and speed are the same<br>  but velocity is vector quantity (need direction)<br>  and speed is scalar quantity (don't need direction)|`|RkphwRepaa	At constant acceleration, the velocity increases. since velocity increases the distance covered in unit time keeps increasing. Hence the graph is a curve

It may end tomorrow, 2012, 2011, 2029, or whenever. Is it possible, sure....anything is possible. Just look at the asteroid that flew by us a couple days ago, 2009DD45. If that got tugged by the moon or earth, who knows what would have happened? And keep this in mind, there are thousands if not millions of space chunks flying in, about, and out of our solar system.<br>  And they say that every 24,000 years or so, our magnetic poles do switch, and we are about due. What impact that will have? Again....no one knows.|`|Gnfc4wRlaa	It is virtually impossible to end something like this 2012 doomsday hoax when the false information is still being so widely disseminated on the internet and the Hysteria Channel.  Many scientists have given actual information to disprove these false claims, but they just keep going.  I don't expect it to end until 2012 is past.  Of course the doomsday proponents will just come up with a new date and start it all over again.<br>  <br>  None of the claims by the doomsday prophets are based on science, just wild speculation.<br>  The Mayans didn’t predict doomsday.  It is just the end of the current cycle of their Long Count calendar.<br>  Nostradamus didn’t predict it.  He never mentioned 2012 and all the Nostradamus "quotes" being thrown around aren't what he actually wrote. They are what some people have decided that he meant. Even Nostradamus scholars don't agree on how the various centuries and quatrains should be interpreted.<br>  The Bible never mentions 2012 or references it in any way.  It talks about the end times, but there is no mention of when.<br>  <br>  There is no actual scientific theory or evidence that anything unusual is going to happen in 2012. It is a collection of myths and disproven theories being promulgated by doomsday predictors, who predict a new one every few years. <br>  This timing is based on the end of the current cycle of the Mayan long count calendar. Their calendar was done in ages or cycles and their years ended at the winter solstice.  The current cycle ends December 21, 2012.  The Mayans didn’t predict the end of the world, only the end of that cycle.<br>  <br>  Nibiru (Planet X) doesn't exist. Zecharia Sitchin is not a scientist, but is an author of books promoting the ancient astronaut theory for human origins. He attributes the creation of the ancient Sumerian culture to the Annunaki (or Nephilim) from a hypothetical planet named Nibiru in the solar system. The Doomsayers predicted that it was to hit Earth in 2003. Undaunted when it didn't show up, they just moved it out to 2012 to coincide with the end of the current cycle of the Mayan calendar. <br>  <br>  Alignment of Solar System with galactic plane – There is no galactic alignment occurring in 2012.  It takes 36 years to precess through galactic equator, and we will be 6 degrees off in 2012.  Even if we did have an alignment, it would have no effect on us.  The vast distances involved outweigh the effects of gravity.<br>  <br>  Planetary alignment – it is impossible for all the planets to form a straight line out from the Sun (or viewed superimposed on each other in the sky) because each planetary orbit is tilted slightly with respect to the Earth's orbit.  John Gribbin in the late 1970's book  The Jupiter Effect  predicted the end of the world would occur in 1983 due a once in a millennium planetary alignment.   The 1983 event was ALL the other planets lined up as seen in our view of the sky -- not in a straight line as most people would misinterpret with the term alignment.  In 1999, The Survival Center had claimed the destruction of the Earth to occur in May 2000 due to the "planetary alignment."<br>  <br>  Asteroid Apophis - the collision alert was for 2029, and was canceled after additional observations showed it would not hit us.<br>  <br>  Geomagnetic reversal - These reversals of the magnetic field have occurred in the past, as shown by magnetic striping, but we can’t predict when they will occur again.  However, the time between reversals is not constant, varying from less than 100,000 years, to tens of millions of years. <br>  <br>  Although fast by geological standards, reversals are by no means quick on the human time scale. They take roughly 5,000 years, with estimates ranging from 1,000 years to 8,000 years.<br>  <br>  Homo Erectus and their ancestors survived previous reversals. There is no evidence of any extinctions resulting from these reversals. Although the inspection of past reversals does not indicate biological extinctions, present society with its reliance on electricity and electromagnetic effects (e.g. radio, satellite communications) may be vulnerable to technological disruptions in the event of a full field reversal. <br>  <br>  Photon belt - We are not heading for a photon belt in the Pleiades. The earth isn't heading toward the Pleiades but away from them. In the 1850s it was conjectured that the earth orbited the Pleiades, but this has long since been discredited. No photon belt or other such region of increased energy has been discovered. Photons in any case are merely particles of electromagnetic energy, which we commonly experience as light. Upon exposure to excess photons the most common transformation of your being is sunburn. <br>  <br>  Solar flares – These do increase and decrease in an eleven year cycle. They haven't caused any serious problems in the past. The direct effects of solar flares are mainly related to communications and radio transmissions. We had a major series of solar flares in 2005.|`|WVPYem5Vaa	People think of lots of things that could cause the world to end. Galactic alignment is BS, for the simple reason that nobody explains what this means, i.e. which three or more bodies align and why that is a serious matter. Pole shift is a possibility, evidence has been found in old rocks that the magnetic poles have shifted before. However, the exact time cannot be predicted: we are supposedly overdue, meaning that there is either no pattern, or the evidence provided is incomplete, and from that, no precise time can be derived. Asteroid impact is a very small chance, because all asteroids are being monitored; only one ever made it to a high spot on the Torino Scale, and that was 4 out of 10 (asteroid Apophis, which has since been relegated to a factor of 0). Also, for far-away asteroids, there is little chance, because to reach Earth in 4 years, such a body would need a very high speed and could theoretically rip itself apart. Nostradamus' prophecies can be interpreted in so many different ways, and pretty much all of them have been interpreted to fit an event after that event happened (no offence to the man, but if a prophecy is ambiguous, it is not a prophecy). And the Mayan calendar doesn't end that year: the 13th cycle ends, but the 14th one begins as soon as the 13th one ends. That is what people are forgetting.|`|79529314dfb5ac7be366558924c3393baa	>And why doesn't some scientist or NASA official just come out and disprove these all and end this fiasco!?<br>  <br>  They already have, to the extent that they can.

1c25f0773926f8cde3f71d5867bbbc1eaa	For certain kinds of physical reality, we have a choice of using time as a parameter.  Anytime it's possible to partition a set into subsets such that each subset can be derived from another in an ordered fashion, then we can arbitrarily parametrize this succession with a variable we call time.  Not all physical reality can be arranged in this fashion, but it's certainly a very common form.  Check Green's Functions and the associated generator operator. Time is related to causality, but is not necessarily implied by it.<br>  <br>  It has been shown by some physicists that it's possible to "do physics" (at least some parts of it) without using time as a parameter.  As I said, it's a choice to use time as a parameter.  For this reason, some argue that "therefore time is illusionary".  Well, no, there is a distinction between physical reality that will permit or not permit use time as a parameter, so the concept of time is real in this regard.  It implies the existence of a certain order in a particular physical reality.  We just cannot take it for granted, nor would it be wise to say, "oh well, since time is an illusion, we don't need to wonder if it makes any difference!"|`|WVPYem5Vaa	That is one of the questions that still baffles physicists. As of yet, it is not known whether time is a real quantity or just a convenient illusion. As far as humans are aware, time passes, and a lot of things depend on time, but there is no completely conclusive proof that time is part of the fabric of the universe (even though the concept of space-time explains a lot of things).<br>  <br>  If time is not real, it would mean that all things everywhere are happening at once, that everything exists and is destroyed and created and non-existent at the same, well, time.|`|XkjWcAKkaa	It exists but is intangible.

Atm74ULtaa	Over the course of any 24-hour period, all of the inhabitants of Earth will look out into the same part of space at midnight. In other words, during the course of any 24-hour period, as midnight sweeps around the world, from time zone to time zone, the inhabitants of each time zone will be looking out into the same region of space and therefore they will be seeing (more-or-less) the same stars. However, there is an important note that I should make in regards to what I have just stated and I will mention that important note towards the end of this answer.<br>  <br>  What you wrote in your question about "a whole bunch of stars during [the] daytime, which we can't see due to the brightness [of the Sun]" is absolutely true. However, the stars that we can not see on any particular day because they just so happen to be in the direction of the Sun can be seen, at night, if you wait six months. This is because six months later, the Earth will have moved halfway around the Sun in its orbit and so at that time of year, when midnight arrives, you will be looking in that particular direction in space and so you will see all those stars that you couldn't see six months earlier because those stars were blocked from view by the glare of the Sun.<br>  <br>  By the way, when you get to this point, six months after where we started, you can no longer see the stars that you originally saw at midnight because now they are blocked from view by the glare of the Sun. The link below will show you a diagram of what I mean and since a picture is worth a thousand words, I'm sure what I have written here will become crystal clear upon viewing the diagram.<br>  <br>  The diagram that I've directed you to (see link) shows the zodiac constellations. These constellations show very well what is meant by the term "seasonal constellations", which are groups of constellations that are best seen in a particular season. For example, Sagittarius and Scorpius, are two constellations that are well-placed in the night sky for viewing during the months of July and August and so observers in the northern hemisphere would call these "summer constellations". Similarly, Taurus or Gemini, are two constellations that are well-placed in the night sky for viewing during the months of January and February and so observers in the northern hemisphere would call these "winter constellations".<br>  <br>  Now it is time for that important note that I mentioned earlier. In the first paragraph I wrote, "the inhabitants of each time zone will be looking out into the same region of space and therefore they will be seeing (more-or-less) the same stars". Notice that I included "more-or-less" in brackets. The reason I did that is because, for example, an observer in Northern Canada and an observer in Southern Argentina could be experiencing midnight at the exact same time and therefore could both be looking out into the same part of space, however, not all of the stars seen by each observer will be seen by the other observer. Many of the stars that each observer can see will also be seen by the other observer, however, the stars above the head and to the north of the Canadian observer will not be seen by the observer in Southern Argentina because these stars would be below the northern horizon for that observer. Similarly, the stars above the head and to the south of the Argentinian observer will not be seen by the observer in Northern Canada because these stars would be below the southern horizon for that observer. The stars that would be in common for both of these observers would be the stars that are situated directly above the equatorial region. However, the Northern Canadian observer would have to look in his/her southern sky to see these stars, whereas the Argentinian observer would have to look in his/her northern sky to see these stars. I've included a link that will hopefully help you to fully understand what I have just written.<br>  <br>  I hope that you like this answer. If so, please vote for it as the "Best Answer". As you may have noticed, most of my answers include a detailed explanation, so that the person who asked the question can learn from it. This takes more time to write, but is certainly worth it from an educational point of view.<br>  <br>  Finally, if "oklatonola" shows up here to answer this question, I advise you not to take her answer seriously because just yesterday I learned that even though she claims to have a degree in geography and to have been an amateur astronomer for the past 40 years, she really doesn't know her minutes of arc from her minutes of time, nor does she seem to know her longitude from her latitude. She is also very mean, presumably because she is bitter about something. Perhaps she is bitter because her best answer percentage is only 17%.|`|aBqFMMWnaa	There are stars that can only be seen from the northern hemisphere, and stars that can only be seen from the southern hemisphere.  Also, there are stars that can be seen from certain areas both sides of the equator.  All the stars seen from anywhere on the Earth are in our own Galaxy, the Milky Way.  Considering that there are untold billions of other galaxies, each containing billions of stars, then yes, there are who knows how many stars we cannot see.  The apparent movement of stars in our sky is due more to the movement of the Earth than to the movement of the stars themselves.
SvmZlLdaaa	In general, they do just leave the corpse where it is. Remember that chimpanzees have a large territory about which they must move in order to find enough food - they seldom spend more than a few days in one place. When they move on from the area in which the death occurred, the body will simply be left behind - since the others have moved on, it does not matter if scavengers are then attracted to it. Whilst they do show signs of mourning, like many social animals including wolves, lions, elephants and various primates, they do not have rituals for the dead, like burial. Sometimes a chimp mother whose baby has died will carry the corpse around with her for a while, but this is either because she has not realized it is dead or because her maternal instincts are still so strong that she feels compelled to continue caring for it. Occasionally, chimps will also indulge in cannibalism.|`|NQK5K9Pbaa	You are almost right,they do along with elephants mourn the dead. For instance,if a mother loses her baby she will still carry it around for a while i know of one chimp who carried her baby along after a 2 months after that baby died.They will mourn the dead but i some cases they do not know that the one is dead..they would lie beside it and try to give it food. They also still try to pick the lice and fleas off of the dead.Its really sad to watch.
oVz6sPsIaa	Good question, and one that I don't have an answer for.  If the device is truly only an manometer I would ignore the ft-lb dial and go with the psi.  You are absolutely correct that ft-lb measures torque and unless the device is something more than just a manometer I agree it doesn't make sense.|`|92f97d29e3d55f3219cc25dfabd347c7aa	Ft lbs can measure work as well as torque.  Still, I don't see why a pressure gauge should have that on it....  Atm, bars, mmHg, maybe.  But not units of work.
lMN59lv2aa	Both are involved in converting energy into a form that is chemically useful to the cell: ATP.<br>  <br>  They differ in the source of that energy. Briefly, the chloroplast gets this energy from light, whereas the mitochondria get it primarily from food in the form of glucose.
lMN59lv2aa	Internal membranes allow better regulation of cellular processes.<br>  <br>  For example, by enclosing the genetic material inside the nuclear membrane, another level of regulation of genetic expression is added, since transcribed mRNAs must be transported to the cytoplasm for translation.<br>  <br>  Also, internal membranes allow compartmentalization within the cell, so that chemical gradients can be maintained across these membranes. Such gradients can then be used as a useful source of chemical energy. For example, in mitochondria, H+ naturally wants to diffuse from the intermembrane space, where it is more concentrated, to the matrix, where the concentration is lower. By forcing this diffusion to take place through specific channels, the energy of H+ ions moving across the membrane can be used to do useful work in the cell. This is in part how ATP is created in mitochondria, using a H+ gradient to drive the "molecular motor" of ATP synthase.<br>  <br>  Internal membranes can also be used to transport proteins or other substances by enclosing them within a membrane. This is important, for example, in immune cells which produce lysozymes. If these lysozymes were simply produced in the cytoplasm, they could very easily kill the cell. By enclosing them within a membrane (such enclosures are called vesicles) and transporting them outside of the cell, their destructive action can be targeted at specific cells, such as an invading bacterium.<br>  <br>  These are just a few of the many advantages of internal membranes. Just as human industry works more smoothly when it is compartmentalized and specialized, such a "division of labor" within individual cells is also more productive.|`|AA11103371	In many many ways!<br>  <br>  The most obvious are that internal membranes allow for a nucleus and internal organelles that prokaryotic organisms lack.  <br>  <br>  Because of the internal membranes cells have functioning mitochondria and lysosomes and endosomes and vesicles.  Also the endoplasimic reticulum is composed of internal membrane.

cc198e7f4ab424c24743237d7bdb642aaa	If you add some details, maybe I can edit in some thoughts????<br>  Is it old and tired, and needs a makeover, are you trying to invent a better machine? Help us out a little.<br>  <br>  **ADDED - The single biggest problem with backhoes and similar digging equipment is stability.  Most newer machines are more powerful than they are heavy.  They will pick more than their own weight, therefore they are able to drag themselves around, tip over, damage themselves etc...  Therefore building them out of lighter materials is OUT..  If you want to move more weight, you need more counterweight.  The steel they are built out of now isn't strong enough to handle the power the machines have.  A bad operator can twist up a new machine before he makes it to his first lunch break.   Some innovations you may be able to expand upon include:<br>  -Quick Attach buckets that allow implement change quickly without mechanics<br>  -Electric over hydraulic controls, eliminating operator fatigue, and improving smooth operation <br>  -Tracks that telescope in and out to allow you to fit into tight spaces (small machines only<br>  -Dozer blades that allow limited blade work (again small units)<br>  -Telescoping sticks to provide greater reach<br>  Since this sounds like a hydraulics question, if you're being asked to improve performance, you're being given a tall order since manufacturers like Cat have employed engineers for decades, and have made few improvements in the actual hydraulics.  Good luck|`|T8DThYKHaa	They have already done it. <br>  The arm of the backhoe can lengthen, giving deeper digging depth<br>  If you can angle the bucket or tilt the machine so that the backhoe bucket is level with the bottom of the trench, this is helpful<br>  A variety of backhoe called a "spider" can do this and it can "walk" up or down slopes too. See the youtube video below <br>  This one is self driving, the smaller one at the next link is towable|`|88SGoW1Iaa	If it ran off of natural gas or used vegetable it would be better environmentally. If it was constructed of lightweight materials like carbon fiber and titanium and aluminum to compensate the extra weight of electric in-hub and hydraulic motors and corresponding batteries it would be more efficient in terms of power and pollution. If it ran off of hyrogen water fuel cells it would be better and a lot more expensive. You really should do yuor own homework though.

cB3t7pcBaa	You are looking for a value of x such that sin(x) equals -1/2. to solve this problem, mathematicians have invented something called the arcsin, or sin^-1, or inverse sine -- which undoes the sin function. if you take the arcsin of both sides:<br>  <br>  arcsin(sin(x)) = arcsin(-1/2)<br>  x = arcsin(-1/2) = -pi/6 radians, or -30 degrees<br>  <br>  if you think about it, the arcsin function does the opposite of the sin function. so when you take the sin of -pi/6, you get -1/2 (you should know this by looking at a unit circle). and when you take the arcsin of -1/2, you get -pi/6<br>  <br>  hope this helps<br>  <br>  edit: the two answers above mine are wrong, because neither falls in the interval -pi/2 to pi/2!|`|uJHSlM5Jaa	Whoever wrote your question has mixed up x and theta. They are both referring to the unknown angle - ie they have given it two names! But don't let that put you off. All you need to do is to find the angle x (or theta!) for which sin(x) is -1/2. <br>  The question tells you that x lies between -pi/2 and pi/2 so you know that the angle is measured in radians, not in degrees. If you think of a graph of sin(x) plotted against the angle x, there are several values of x for which sin(x) is -1/2. However only one of these lies between -pi/2 and pi/2 and that is -pi/6 (this is the same as -30 degrees but we are using radians, not degrees).<br>  Hope that helps.|`|jRJBs4hxaa	-pi/2 =-90 = 270 degrees<br>  pi/2=90 degrees<br>  sin(x) = -1/2 has two solutions<br>  210 degrees 7π/6 radians<br>  330 degrees 11π/6 radians<br>  330 does not fall on this interval<br>  So, x = 7π/6 radians or 210 degrees|`|26c965d89f3df6ce34c69c0f9e9d230aaa	A picture tells a thousand words: graph y = sin(x).|`|AA11286219	x=180-30=150 =pi-pi/6=5pi/6<br>  <br>  Hint:<br>   sin30=1/2

Gnfc4wRlaa	Satellites make possible  the instant communications we have worldwide, telephones, television, and broad band internet.  <br>  <br>  Space Stations<br>  Skylab<br>  America's first experimental space station. Designed for long duration mission, Skylab program objectives were twofold: To prove that humans could live and work in space for extended periods, and to expand our knowledge of solar astronomy well beyond Earth-based observations. Successful in all respects despite early mechanical difficulties, three three-man crews occupied the Skylab workshop for a total of 171 days, 13 hours. It was the site of nearly 300 scientific and technical experiments: medical experiments on humans' adaptability to zero gravity, solar observations, and detailed Earth resources experiments. <br>  <br>  Skylab logged about 2,000 hours of scientific and medical experiments, including eight solar experiments. The Sun's coronal holes were discovered thanks to these efforts.<br>  <br>  International Space Station<br>  Scientists have a number of plans to study biology on the ISS. One goal is to improve understanding of the effect of long-term space exposure on the human body. Subjects such as muscle atrophy, bone loss, and fluid shifts are studied with the intention to use this data so space colonisation and lengthy space travel can become feasible (at present levels of bone loss and muscular atrophy, there would be a significant risk of fractures and movement problems if astronauts landed on an extraterrestrial planet following a lengthy space cruise). The effect of near-weightlessness on evolution, development and growth, and the internal processes of plants and animals are also studied. In response to recent data, NASA has indicated a desire to investigate microgravity's effects on the growth of three-dimensional human body-like tissues and that unusual protein crystals can be formed in space.<br>  Prominent physics problems are also studied on the station. Researchers hope to gain a better understanding of the physics of fluids in microgravity, and they would like to be able to accurately model fluids in the future. Also, because fluids can be combined nearly completely in space regardless of their relative weights, there is some interest in investigating the combination of fluids that would not mix well on Earth. By examining reactions that are slowed down by low gravity and temperatures, scientists also hope to gain new insight concerning states of matter (specifically in regards to superconductivity).<br>  Researchers also hope to examine combustion in low gravity environments. Any findings involving the efficiency of the burning or the creation of by-products could improve the process of energy production, which would be of economic and environmental interest. Scientists plan to use the ISS to examine aerosols, ozone, water vapour, and oxides in Earth's atmosphere, as well as cosmic rays, cosmic dust, antimatter, and dark matter in the Universe.<br>  The long-term goals of these areas of research are to develop the technology necessary for human-based space and planetary exploration and colonisation, how to improve life in general on earth, and to study the universe at large. Scientists hope to develop better life support systems, safety precautions, environmental monitoring in space, new ways to treat diseases, more efficient methods of producing materials, more accurate scientific measurements than would be possible to achieve on Earth, and achieve a more complete understanding of the Universe.|`|jYy6dDAZaa	They are feeble attempt to learn colonizing space.<br>  Skylab was at least twice the size of the international space station and we let it crash rather than spend $100K  to keep it in orbit.|`|nuhi9H6paa	Skylab fell from orbit on 11 July 1979. Currently in orbit, the ISS is the result of the United States, Canada, Russia, Japan, Brazil, and eleven countries from the European Space Agency working together. When completed, it will be the biggest space station ever built. It will be about 356 feet across and 290 feet long! Orbiting high above the Earth, it can be reached by both the Space Shuttle and other spacecraft, so that astronauts and supplies can be delivered. The ISS has science laboratories, which allow the astronauts to do experiments about medicines, building materials, and building better clocks. The ISS is also always watching the Earth for weather patterns and changes in the environment.<br>  <br>  Satellites are an advantage for many reasons, the most important being that they can view a large portion of the Earth at once. Satellites let us explore beyond earth’s boundaries. Satellites can take images of large sections of the Earth, thus monitoring our environment, weather, seasonal changes, atmosphere, etc. easily, without having to resort to aerial imaging, which would require much larger amounts of time and effort. <br>  <br>  Satellites also have been used for a number of military purposes, including infrared sensors that track missile launches; electronic sensors that eavesdrop on classified conversations Our satellites also make worldwide communication much simpler and cost-effective. Today, satellites give us instant information right when the action is happening.<br>  <br>  Research satellites measure fundamental properties of outer space, e.g., magnetic fields, the flux of cosmic rays and micrometeorites, and properties of celestial objects that are difficult or impossible to observe from the earth. <br>  <br>  Communications satellites provide a worldwide linkup of radio, telephone, and television.<br>   <br>  Weather satellites, or meteorological satellites, provide continuous, up-to-date information about large-scale atmospheric conditions such as cloud cover and temperature profiles. <br>  <br>  Navigation satellites were developed primarily to satisfy the need for a navigation system that nuclear submarines could use to update their inertial navigation system and optical and other sensors that aid military surveillance.<br>  <br>  Such reconnaissance satellites have subsequently proved to have civilian benefits, such as commercially available satellite photographs showing surface features and structures in great detail, and fire sensing in remote forested areas.

Since it's zero-order with respect to reactant B, and second-order with respect to reactant A, the slow reaction mustn't include B and must include A with coefficient = 2. The answer is A or B. But addition of reactions in option B doesn't produce total equation (there must be D as product), the  correct answer is A.

EJSdI25Naa	A tremendous advantage of satellite imagery is that the "photograph" can be taken in different bands of light, such as u.v. or infra-red. Our eyes do not see these wavelengths, but the camera does and each can relay some vital information such as forest growth and soil erosion<br>  very much more clearly than the unaided eye can determine.<br>  <br>  With your problem, You would use the satellite data to establish the extent of glaciation at the period of fifty years ago, then look at the data over periods of  10 year increments and point out how much the area of glaciation has decreased with each period and attempt to establish a rate of shrinkage.<br>  <br>  I state 10 year periods because to do that annually could be overcooking the goose. But I would not just limit myslf to he actual extent of the glacier but also to the spreading area of influence around it and below it. Likewise for the ice caps.<br>  <br>  This is what you would do. Exactly how would be subject to strategies, but it is those strategies that you, as the climatologist, need to establish to complete the task at hand. For instance, if you trace something that is happening at an alarmingly high rate, you might find it desirable to trace that out in annual increments for the last five years. You need to search the ice for various visual data, too, such as cracking/faulting and how that is developing over time. Is there a constancy with the decrease or does it have starts and spurts? Is there any way  you can correlate that with sunspot activity? Might you be able to trace winter effects as compared to summer? Is it freezing over again at winter? Are there any traces of moraine present, the flow of which is traceable? Ponding of meltwater? Moraine dumps in front of the glacier face. Glacial flower colouring the runoff water. The extent of glacial lakes. What volume of ice is disappearing over ten years. Are there traces of glacial creep, ie. the glacier is advancing faster than the melting occurs. You trace the increments of annual replenishment at source to account for such. Is the glacier "melting" or is the load of freshly compacted snow at the source greater than what is being lost and is this  pushing the glacier downhill at a faster rate? In such a case, the glacier would not exactly be melting but growing,which would be a point to debunk a great deal of the warming earth theory which I do not accept. And I don't accept it because I have not had it sufficiently well explained that it could be happening.<br>  <br>  That is your job. To sufficiently explain your results, whatever they are, as factual with back-up proofs as best you can illustrate.<br>  <br>  You have a fascinating project. Thank you  for sharing it with us.|`|rcPnnfmmaa	The area of ice lost is not equal to the volume of ice lost; for example I know for a fact that the ice cap at the north pole has lost more ice to thinning than it's lost to a decrease in visible surface area. <br>  <br>  You will need to add data on the depth of the ice over the past 50 years into your estimates.<br>  <br>  You're being asked to find the volume of a large number of irregular objects. You can do this two ways; approximate their shapes by hand or build a computer program.<br>  <br>  For example, a glacier that empties into the ocean is approximately a long thin rectangular solid. If you know where it ended in 1959 and you know where it ended in 2009 it's a very simple formula. Do this for every glacier. You'll want a lot of assistants...<br>  <br>  You can also hire a computer programmer to solve this problem; instead of grad students you'll use a large computer to work out a much more exact change in volume. Be sure to check it's results against a few you did by hand.|`|77cb033374598e8c10938763c9fe03f7aa	It is collected on a ccd then transmitted as digital data and reconstructed on the surface.<br>    Subtract the digital data at regular time intervals and the remaining will be your answer.|`|fxL0DCYmaa	count how many 50 years ago<br>  count how many now<br>  <br>  subtract

The domain of tan(x) is all the set of all numbers where tan(x) is defined.  It is helpful to think of tan(x) in its more basic form.  Recall that tan(x) = sin(x)/cos(x).  Now, this function is defined almost everywhere.  Notice, however, that if x = pi/2, 3pi/2, 5pi/2, 7pi/2, etc. or -pi/2, -3pi/2, -5pi/2, -7pi/2, etc., we have that tan(x) = 1/0, so tan(x) is undefined at these points.  Algebraically, we write this as:<br>  <br>  domain of tan(x) = all real numbers except x= kpi/2 where k is any integer except zero.<br>  <br>  The range is, just as you said, negative infinity to infinity.  This is a little bit harder to prove, but just think about what happens as you get close to x = kpi/2: sin(x) gets really close to 1 (or -1, depending on which direction you approach from), and cos(x) keeps getting smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and closer to zero.  So, the fraction sin(x)/cos(x) blows up,  and continues to get closer to infinity (or negative infinity, depending again on which direction you approach from).  Graphing the function on a graphing calculator will display this in a very visually convincing manner.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|uYufbBpTaa	domain is x cannot equal pi/2 + kpi and range is all real numbers with the period of pi.

0DwHIBUbaa	As nothing other than light can travel at that speed, we need to rephrase your Q. Let's assume you're at 99% - more or less there, but a feasible speed. If you measure the speed of any beam of light from your spaceship you will get the answer c m/s. If somebody outside measures the same beam as you whizz past, they too will get c m/s.<br>  <br>  Weird? Yes? But verified by scientific experiment to be correct.

9Xur3g9Paa	Lots of misinformation on this subject, including other answers to this post.  First, if you smoked two weeks ago and not since, AND you did not smoke for 2 weeks prior to your 3 day binge, THC products will probably not be detectable.  Almost all drug screens, except in criminal investigations, is through urine testing and detects THC or THC metabolites.  THC (the active parent compound) will be out of your blood in a couple of days, but THC metabolites such as Carboxy THC can be detected for up to 2 months in urine and longer in hair, depending on how often you smoke, etc.  The person who said THC is not detected after 28 days is correct, but clearly does not understand toxicology testing.  Most labs (hospital or outsourced employee compliance testing) only test for metabolites of THC (such as THC-COOH), not the parent drug (again, unless you are dealing with a forensics lab and this is a criminal investigation).   THC metabolites are are detectable for more than 28 days in chronic users but if you have not smoked in two weeks and not for at least a couple of weeks before your 3-day, you should be okay.

However, from all my knowledge, the chances are admittedly fairly low.<br>  <br>  if you're concerned and need to take a drug test for work, the best thing to put your mind at ease is to take a home-drug-test, available in any CVS/Walgreens, etc, just to make sure before the "official" test.<br>  <br>  EDIT: i'm also an RN, and i know for a fact that exercising, metabolism, etc play a big role in whether THC stays in your system.  I have a close friend who was a very chronic user (smoked maybe 3-4 days a week for the past 3 years) who quit smoking, drank a TON of diuretics (coffee, cranberry juice, etc), and passed his drug test after not smoking for only 14 days.  again, everyone's body works differently; that's not guaranteed to work for everyone; but there is absolutely NO EVIDENCE that THC remains in your body for at least 28 days no matter what. that's just false information.|`|qiLKlSmHaa	It can remain in your system for up to a month...I don't think anyone can give you a guaranteed answer here...of course the more water you drink and the higher you can get your metabolism to run, the quicker it will clear out.  It may also depend on how much you smoked as well.

i1jV0xIGaa	The 3 stars in orion's belt point south to Sirius.  Below Sirius just above the horizon is Canopus.  It would twinkle with color because it is low in the sky - Sirius is quite a bit higher and is usually a fairly steady blue white. If the belt pointed to it, it was Sirius, but at that latitude, near the horizon - it was probably Canopus.     This is how things would look about 8 pm Belize time|`|WVPYem5Vaa	Yes, it is Sirius. It is one of the closest stars to our Sun (a little over 8 light years away) and very luminous. Because of this, scintillation has a profound effect on the light it emits, making it appear to have many different colours.
lMN59lv2aa	The easiest answer is that many bitter-tasting chemicals also happen to be poisons... so it is definitely a survival advantage to be able to detect these flavors.<br>  <br>  As an added benefit, not all bitterness is necessarily unpleasant to human taste, nor are all bitter compounds poisonous. Coffee and chocolate, for example, both stimulate bitter taste buds, but in combination with the scent and with other flavors, the total result is something that most people find quite pleasing.<br>  <br>  On that note, I'm off for a coffee refill...
FD8I4zthaa	They have a BIG digestive system to cope! Also contains many micro-organisms to help them digest the grass. This also provides extra nutrition.<br>  <br>  An advantage of being an omnivore, like us, is that we don't need to spend all day eating and digesting.|`|CuMYdQV6aa	A cow has a large proportion of its body taken up with complex digestive organs; compare its belly with that of a cheetah.This is necessary to extract all the nutritional value from grass. It also has a vast population of bacteria (the 'gut flora') to assist in the process.<br>  <br>  However it has been demonstrated that if the cow eats a wider variety of wild herbaceous plants  such as plantain and clover (in America they call them forbs), the cow - and its milk - is healthier.|`|FLgDn3OTaa	Grass isn't classed as a superfood because few animals contain the enzymes necessary to break down cellulose (the cell wall). Ruminants- including cows- are an exception. Grass is of little nutritional value on its own, but cows can regurgitate it to extract all the necessary vitamins (known as chewing the cud). In addition, cows have perfectly adapted incisor teeth to allow them to tear large bunches of grass from the stems.|`|ezT7xruoaa	Haha, I wondered as well. The answer is that because cows have 4 stomacks they can break down grass better than us and digest parts of it that are indigestable to humans. Thats also why they become super fat off just grass, and us humans would die of starvation if we lived on just grass. We simply can't digest it like them.|`|os5IKFBJaa	They just "moove" it round their stomachs.

lMN59lv2aa	The answer is (C), that some parts of it are highly conserved over many generations. This would indicate that there is some kind of selective pressure against mutation in these segments of DNA, strongly implying that they have some function.<br>  <br>  However, no biologist or geneticist I know of would EVER refer to highly conserved sequences as "junk DNA." Junk DNA would by definition be stretches of DNA which first of all do not code any known proteins or RNAs, and secondly would not show conservation in the sequence over the course of several generations.<br>  <br>  Only a creationist would label conserved DNA with no currently known function "junk" DNA. It makes a convenient strawman argument to use against evolution.<br>  <br>  Within the human genome, or indeed the genomes of MOST organisms, the vast majority of DNA not only has no known function, but is NOT conserved. Conversely to conserved segments, this would indicate that there is NO selective pressure against mutations, and therefore no necessary biological function for such DNA.
GgClh7dbaa	a. proteins<br>  <br>  Specifically, enzymes, which are protein molecules. The enzymes that are specific to DNA synthesis happen to be called helicase, ligase and polymerases.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://users.rcn.com/jkimball.ma.ultranet/BiologyPages/D/DNAReplication.html" rel="nofollow">http://users.rcn.com/jkimball.ma.ultrane...</a> discusses several of the protein enzymes which you don't need to worry about, but just in case you're intereseted:<br>  <br>  The Enzymes:<br>  <br>  [1] A portion of the double helix is unwound by a helicase.<br>      <br>  [2] A molecule of a DNA polymerase binds to one strand of the DNA and begins moving along it in the 3' to 5' direction, using it as a template for assembling a leading strand of nucleotides and reforming a double helix. In eukaryotes, this molecule is called DNA polymerase delta (δ).<br>  <br>  [3] Because DNA synthesis can only occur 5' to 3', a molecule of a second type of DNA polymerase (epsilon, ε, in eukaryotes) binds to the other template strand as the double helix opens. T<br>  <br>  [4] Another enzyme, DNA ligase I then stitches these together into the lagging strand.|`|775c9e1c658bda31482c631c3d9e4614aa	a

YHNK9UrQaa	The term “acid fast” refers to a staining technique.<br>  <br>  Bacteria cause infections.<br>  Antibiotics kill bacteria (usually), but some bacteria are easily killed by some antibiotics, killed less well by other antibiotics, and not killed at all by still other antibiotics.<br>  You could try to find the most effective antibiotic by trial and error (i.e., if the first antibiotic you try doesn’t work, maybe the second, fifth or twentieth antibiotic you try will work), but that takes time, and before you find an effective antibiotic, the patient might die.<br>  It is much better to determine exactly which species or strain of bacteria you are dealing before you try to choose a specific antibiotic to kill it, so you take a sample of the infection and send it off to a lab for identification.<br>  In the lab, technicians will grow the bacteria out on Petrie dishes and will subject it to a number of standard tests to try to identify it.  There are many standard tests.<br>  Different species of bacteria are different in many ways.  One difference is in the composition of their cell walls (e.g., the cell walls of tuberculosis bacteria contain mycolic acid) and that difference causes them to react differently to stains.  <br>  Just as some fabrics, like cotton, might absorb a particular dye more easily than some other fabrics, like nylon;  and, just as some fabrics might be easier to bleach than some other fabrics, the cell walls of some species of bacteria are more or less resistant to staining and bleaching than the cell walls of other species of bacteria.  The way an unknown strain of bacteria responds to a staining technique can help to identify it.<br>  “The most common staining technique used to identify acid-fast bacteria is the Ziehl-Neelsen stain, in which the acid fast bacilli are stained bright red ..." with carbol fuchsin stain, then bleached with hydrochloric acid and ethanol, then counter stained with methylene blue.  “... bacteria with an acid-fast cell wall resist decolorization with an acid-alcohol mixture during the acid-fast staining procedure, retain the initial dye carbol fuchsin and appear red. Common acid-fast bacteria of medical importance include Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium leprae, Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex, and Nocardia species”. <br>  So, by doing an “acid fast” test on an unknown strain of bacteria (and getting a positive result), you would know that the infection was probably caused by tuberculosis, or a Nocardia species.  (Other tests would narrow it down more precisely).<br>  You could then look up which antibiotics are known to be most effective against tuberculosis.
