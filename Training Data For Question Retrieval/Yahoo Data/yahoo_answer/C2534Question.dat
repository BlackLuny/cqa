My teenage daughter will soon need to drive this car and we live off a very busy highway, she CAN'T be w/o blinkers, it will cause a wreck or get her a ticket. FYI - if you put the car in R and step on the gas to back up, put it in N and THEN step on the brake it won't blow the fuse, only if you're in R when you step on the brake will it blow the fuse.  I've even taken the steering column apart and cleaned the connections...what now?

20090205155028AApWmPQ	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	What is the difference between a regular thermostat and an economy one?	I am driving a 1994 Chevy C-1500 Silverado with a 5.7 liter/350 V-8. It is pre-Vortec. The temp gauge likes to go from running temp(195) and go up to about 240, then the Check Gauges light comes on. I have got the cooling problem figured out, I know my radiator has a hole in it, but the temp gauge shouldn't be acting like that. I have a feeling that the temp sensor is bad. I am replacing the radiator, thermostat, water pump, and the freeze plugs, but I don't know the differences between a regular thermostat and economy. I can guess but I don't want to take too many chances.

If I get a 2008 I can still get a pretty descent car and save about $5K - 7K now, but those only come in 6 cylinder. The 2009, however, comes in 4 cylinder which would save me $$ on gas. What do yout guys recommend? Does anyone have a 4 cylinder 2009 Highlander? If so, how much do you spend for gas per week? Thanks in advance!!

As soon as he pulls into the school parking lot a cop flipped his lights on. He wrote him a ticket for "loud exhaust". I have been all over, in some places where the cops are really strict and I did not get pulled over for it. So why all of a sudden would he get pulled over now. There is abosolutly nothing wrong with it. I have dual exhaust on it thers nothing wrong with the mufflers at all. How much would the ticket be?

20090205160424AAhuNkl	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Dodge	2006 Dodge Magnum water outlet leakage?	The screws around the black piece that was quoted as the housing for the engine coolant outlet is leaking engine coolant.  I was told that if it was just the gasket, I'm okay but that if it's that black piece, I will need to replace the whole water outlet.  Doesn't the gaskets have to be leaking in order for the black piece outside of it to be leaking.  Will I be  wasting my time by just replacing the gasket to see if that will work. Also, I was told that the whole piece is made together from the manufacturer and that just the gasket (can't be replaced)  I'm lead to believe that all of the gaskets that I've seen for sale online, that I can possibly just replace the gaskets.

I know that in a dry nitrous system, when the nitrous is injected before the MAF, it turns to gas form. In a wet system (when the nitrous is mixed with fuel) it is injected into the intake manifold. When it is injected, does it separate from the fuel and turn to a gas form, or does it stay in liquid form because it was mixed with the fuel?
