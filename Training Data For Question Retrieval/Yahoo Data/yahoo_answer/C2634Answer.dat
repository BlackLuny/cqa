c48nm70gaa	You have several choices if you go to: autopartswarehouse.com. EBC Yellow, Performance Friction and Hawk. Locally, you'll find Bendix CQ.3 ceramic and AC-Delco ceramic.     To complete a great brake job the selection of brake rotors is important. Stay away from low dollar off-shore parts from China or Taiwan. For the money, you can't beat the "close grained" cast iron dimpled and grooved rotors from EBC. They're cast in Great Britain. Any American or Canadian cast rotors are a close second choice. AC-Delco and Wagner are fair choices. Make sure you complete the job by greasing the *hardened slider pins with synthetic brake grease. If any of the slider pins show wear, replace with OEM hardend pins. You can actually see the difference between regular non-hardened auto-parts store pins by their bright silver color. Those parts are off-shore also. Hardened pins are usually dark and dull in color.    Wish you could actually see with your own eyes the complete lack of rust on the pad contact faces of EBC rotors that are in use.|`|0qGwCA1Baa	i like Ceramic  Ultra Quiet|`|EFQmk31Uaa	Semi-Metallic have best grip.  Ceramic pads are good for not leaving brake dust but they loose grip power cause they are not a metal and more slippery than metallic ones.|`|M7G3MZb5aa	I find that buying the cheapest pads/rotors possible, and replacing them twice as often is cheaper than buying pads/rotors thta are rediculously expensive even thoguh they perform 15% mroe efficiently.    Also, another poster suggested, the semimetallic pad (shich are the cheapest) offer the highest coefiecient of friction.    --------------------------------------...  About performance brakes.......    The pads really arnt the performance part.  Brakes effectively convert the vehicles kinetic energy into heat, the amoutn of heat created by the brake system is CONSTANT and DIRECTLY PROPORTIONAL to how much the car decelerates regardless of what kidn fo brake pads/ rotors you have.    Brakes need to be able to disperes the heat, before the parts get soo hot that somethign fails, the brakes may fail because the coeficient of friction drops due to heat, or the hydraulic fluid in the lines begins to boil from the caliper getting too hot.    MOST of the heat is dispersed through the brake rotor which has internal airducks that offer more cooling surface area, and also allow centrifugal force to circulate air though them as the rotor is spinning.  Drilling holes into them for added ventalation, and surface area will further increase cooling ability.    If you wnat performance brakes you need to buy better rotors, not better pads, very little heat is dispersed through the pads.  In addition to better rotors, you can buy hydraulic fluid that doesnt boil untill higher temps, however you will only need better fluid if you frequently decelerate form high speeds, over and over and over such as when racing on a track, in normal driving the brakes wont get THAT hot|`|d3c7f596f46351dd77c859a02f206bf4aa	i like raybestos brute stop pads,good price work great|`|WPYjdsA4aa	www.autozone.com   ceramic

FgRUdQOBaa	yep    the same laws of physics apply all over the world.    Older jointed type rail has less tendency to buckle as each rail joint hs a small amount of movement in it, thus absorbing much of the expansion. It still happens if the track is not installed and maintained properly.|`|d1ee48df00eb4b8567acf7a43aeb1c1aaa	If you lay them wrong, yes, they will.  You must lay the rail at the right temperature - so on the hottest day it does not sun-kink, yet on the coldest night it does not stretch to the breaking point.     The problem is worse with temperature extremes (hot vs. cold) - if your temperatures are moderate all the time, it's less of a problem.      It also helps if the ties are very heavy. Concrete ties are very good at controlling the problem, and I believe concrete ties are used extensively in India.|`|AV2q8U2Zaa	indian engineers are not stupid like aussie engineer.....even i felt so pity on aussie engineer when connex trains were delayed and services via jolimont was cancelled....poor aussies..huh

E7TkNO00aa	Ok so you were speeding and then it turned to tailgaiting and that's why you were pulled over. If there is traffic school that you can attend where you live, go for it. It seems that you have a good driving record if it's your first ticket ever.|`|31Ttgqlbaa	Did the driver ahead of you get stopped too? Because if you were speeding, the car you were following must have been speeding too. You can contest the ticket if you don't think the ticket is fair. If you plea not guilty and the officer doesn't show up for court when you argue your case, the case is usually dismissed.     Around here if you go to traffic school, you get your fined refunded and don't lose points on your driving record.

Like for instance the corvette requires that you use 5w-30 Mobil 1 Synthetic. For your engine it calls for a conventional 5w-30. If you have high miles on the vehicle you might want to introduce a high mileage oil to the engine. Id start that at 90,000 miles. You do not want to introduce something that different to an engine if its past 100,000 miles. Its not always a bad thing if you do, but sometimes it causes problems. However, for an 06 you shouldnt have reached 100,000 miles yet. Or you are close to it. The only difference about synthetic is that it has more additives and that makes it so you dont necessarily have to change the oil until every 5,000 miles. I hope that this helps you.|`|6CyScIKBaa	5w-30 and if its not new do not use synthe. oil but if high milage use high milage oil people think synth. is the best oil but it is not unless its always been used|`|SY9hPeROaa	5w30|`|txoXobsAaa	5w-30|`|z9SqERFpaa	mobil  1   5-w30 the motor will last for ever my best friend uses it in his chevy|`|EFQmk31Uaa	If your over 30k miles use 5w-30 fully synthetic is good.|`|0HYxVe56aa	any place that has oil should have a booklet that says what type by the oils.

7mZbwBKCaa	I worked at a car body repair shop in Kansas for three years, and i learned the most effective, and inexpensive way to fix dents on the body of a car.  The best thing you can do to get it out, is use a plunger from an ordinary bathroom.  But it is best that the plunger is loosened-up beforehand, if you lube it in olive or vegetable oil and then start to get the dent out the rubber end of the plunger will be more flexible and easier to use.  All you do is go out to the dent and start using the rubber end to suck the dent out.|`|6nOjANBUaa	West Yorkshire has a dent? Where?

Global warming, deforestation, desertification and other environmental maladies all are reduced with less use of fossil fuels. Presently, alternative fuels and transportation modes are more expensive because they do not enjoy the efficiencies of mass production. Also the infrastructure to support other fuels or transportation modes is not commonly available.<br>  <br>  At the beginning of the 1900s, when the automobile was in its infancy, powerplants came in gasoline, diesel, steam and electrical versions. Eventually, gasoline predominated. We are in another transitional phase with many choices. As before, this will evolve into a transportation system with reasonable, and well supported choices that will be embraced by the population as a substantial improvement for all.

Dont waste your money on the fake ones that are blue or purple bulbs. They will be dimmer than the regular ones because they only allow that color to be released instead of the whole light spectrum.|`|3cFKfFifaa	It is illegal to have HIDs in cars that did not come with them from the factory. In Alaska, it appears it is illegal to have window tint on the front windows, and the rear windows must allow at least 37% of light in. Something to keep in mind while modifying your car.    That being said, tinting the windows makes every car look better.
9Kt7p7Vfaa	Everyone that says this car was made to be fast is incorrect. It is designed as a well handling car. The insurance shouldn't be terribly expensive either. Mine actually went down when I put my 944 on the road and my driving record isn't very clean. It features a galvanized steel body, stainless exhaust, just about everything under the car is aluminum so rusting isn't much of an issue either, but its till isn't a great winter car. Parts can be quite expensive for the 944, especially brake,electrical and exhaust parts. You'll want to know when the timing and balance shaft belts were changed last, if they go, you'll wreck the engine. The moonroof seal tends to leak and is about $100 to replace and it seems the hatch leaking is a common problem too. You'll want an 85.5 or newer, 85 and older versions were basically built from spare audi/volkswagen/porsche parts. The dash tends to crack from the sun and the driver's seat wears out from getting in and out. It wouldn't be a bad car if you find one with newer brakes and belts and good oil pressure ( between 2 and 3 bar at idle and 4 and 5 bar while driving).|`|6Ce5wlK6aa	any  sports car not good for your first car. i have seen many young people drive fast cars a get hurt or killed|`|UE100SUUaa	Not really.    If you like the styling, by all means, go for it.    They aren't very fast, if you're looking for something sporty. 944s are only I4's. The automatic version is only a 3 speed to boot, so acceleration isn't the best.    You could get a 3.0L I4, but still...not the fastest.    Beyond that you are looking at getting a car from the late 80s. You'll likely be staring at a stock cassette player in the dash. The interiors weren't much to look at then and haven't aged well either.    The maint. costs are still very expensive, as are all Porsches you need to run back and forth to the $125/hr dealer.    If you want one through all that though, I'm not talking you out of it, just be prepared for what you'll be getting.|`|7N1bktyPaa	You should also consider that such a car may be expensive to insure. Check your insurance rates before buying one, for example here - carquotes.sinfree.net|`|1GsQzWPCaa	To Be honest,It will take a little time to find the answer for the question of yours.have a look at the resource here http://www.CarInsuranceTip.info/free-car...  for your reference .|`|AuQxzgrjaa	I think a 944 would make a decent first car. It is however a sports car that was made to go fast and is therefore more expensive than the average commuter car, I personally think that it would be a waste of money to buy a sports car and not use it for its intended purpose. That doesn't mean that you have to speed on public roads though, autocross would be perfect for someone in your possition. It is relatively cheap and lets you practice car handling skills. I am 20 and have a porsche 968 which is pretty much the same care as the 944 s2, but with different body panels and variocam. For 944s I would recomend an 85.5 and up model. They added a few safety features and the car was just overall improved. You should probably stay away from the turbos though, I have heard that they have pretty bad turbo lag, which could get dangerous for a new driver. Since it is a porsche almost everything will be expensive for it. I was able to get around expensive parts and labor by getting a job at a porsche race shop.    some good sites for parts if you end up getting it.  http://www.paragon-products.com/  www.9xauto.com  http://www.pelicanparts.com/|`|69b28c895ecbe3f5e0fc99326c84d73faa	Get ready to cough up some money. Not onlt will the parts for the repairs break you, but the insurance rates for a new driver with a speedster like a porsche 944 is going to be off the chart. Not to mention if you get the guts to put your foot into it and the law is around. then the insurance is really going to get jacked up, but good luck.|`|AA11828439	No, high insurance, expensive to repair and maintain and far too fast for a 16 year old.|`|ZAPWDFKxaa	No, a 944 is not a very good choice for a first car.  They are expensive to fix and need to be worked on by someone who knows this car. It is different than most of the cars out there.  Not only that, but for an older car the insurance is rather expensive.  Other than that, they are great on gas, Porsche engineering is second to none and there are a lot of aftermarket modifications you can make to them.|`|79a480de57b67ba4c4f448d879f145d4aa	Hmm... this sounds a lot like me!  I'm 17 and bought a 924 which I'm sure you know is like a 944. One thing you may want is to know is how to work on these car. I've basically torn my 924 all apart with the help of my father who, for some reason, knows how to work on basically any vehicle.   Anyways, If you live up north, I wouldn't buy it unless you decided on driving another vehicle in winter. You would just send the tires spinning in the snow and ice, and the car would likely start to rust pretty quickly with all the salt on the roads.   Parts for 944s and 924s aren't terribly expensive. In addition, insurance can be a bit steep, but I got a quote for my 924 that was about $100 a month. When I was considering a 944 I checked the insurance on them and it was actually less than that.   If you want to ask me any questions if or when you buy a 944, just ask me!|`|sptrtwxlaa	geez spoiled much??  yea Its a good car.

Also do some research if I'm not mistaken the S40 has a bad habit of backfiring on deceleration.

That is a "one lunger" and while they are a nice bike, they are a thumper.  Not something that you will WANT to take on long trips-note I said WANT TO not CAN'T.    Personal experience is that they work too hard at highway speeds above 60 (the engines), and make for some not so pleasant vibrations starting about hour 3 into the trip.|`|kT7GCNnCaa	Sit on it for five minutes if you are getting tired its not sized or adjusted right.

Personally, the problem I have with my bike is the handlebars being too low and causing cramp[ing in my shoulders on long trips.  I love the high seat height and the weight of the bike otherwise.  The only way to know how it fits you is to sit on it and ride it.  You can't really tell how a bike will fit by numbers on a stat sheet.|`|fl60KL8oaa	I am 5'9" 180 pounds and have riden my Savage (same bike, different name) for over four years / 20,000 miles.    RIding an  S40 will not affect your rider skills.    Riding an S40 will not affect your rider safety *except* to the extent you are uncomfortable and paying attention to your positioning on the bike rather than your positioning on the road.    The S40 is, in my opinion, an excelent all round motorcycle.  It is a killer city bike; light, agile, quick.  It keeps up with traffic on the Los Angeles Freeways - which runs up to 85 mph at times.   On the twisties (Angeles Forest and Ortega Highways) I was not passed by anyone.  I took it to OKC in '07, over 500 miles each of the first two days out.  Ran speed of traffic just fine, did not get numb from the vibration (Suzuki did too good on the counterbalancer), did not get blown about by winds (which may be just my not noticing as I may unconsciously compensate as the wind tries to move me.)  This year I want to take it to visit my daughter in Arkansas, about 3600 miles round trip.    If you want a "big heavy road bike" the S40 is not for you.  If you want to exceed 85 mph on the interstate, the S40 is not for you.  If you cannot ignore "Girl's Bike" "Beginner's Bike" "When are you going to get a real bike?" the S40 is not for you.    As for your excessive length, it is not at all difficult to move the controls foreward or the seat up and back.  My first attempt at mounting my springer saddle fit my wife perfectly -- and she has a 36" inseam.  Wonton Destruction, an old time Biker about your size, rode an S40 mostly stock and like it just fine.|`|kjVby4fsaa	Overall Length 2180 mm (85.8 in.)   Overall Width 720 mm (28.3 in.)

5f3c0f66e74aa2ed0f31d39bf33396bbaa	When you write any data disc using whatever software, the file system naming convention comes in 3 forms:    1) ISO+Joliet (106 character file names)  2) ISO+Joliet + UDF (106 character file names)  3) ISO Level 2 (212 character file names)    Most disc writing software defaults to ISO+Joiet (Level 1).  So if you are using something like Nero or Roxio, your discs should work fine in your Astra.  If you have changed the settings, look for a "Restore Defaults" button.    Additonally, your Astra stereo will only play .mp3 formatted data discs.  It won't recognize .wma, .acc, .mp4, or .m4a. (Windows and Apple formats) This might be why your disc aren't playing.

AA10080206	All 2001 Sables came with keyless entry.  You can buy a replacement remote online (check Ebay, they are really cheap there), and the instructions on how to program it are in the owner's manual.    If you don't have the owner's manual, you can actually download one from Ford or Mercury's website.  Check the link for current owners.    If you are talking about the keypad on the door (if you car is so equipped), the code for that can be found either on a card that should be with the owner's manual (which I'm assuming you don't have) and on the side of the fuse box inside the car (at the top of the brake pedal).  You will need to be a contortionist, or use mirrors and a lot of light to get the code.  The other option is to head to your dealer and ask nicely if they will pull the code for you (some will do this without charge, especially if you get your car serviced there, so maybe try an oil change at the dealer and then ask).    You are looking for a 5 digit code number.    I have included the link for Edmunds that lists all the standard equipment on the 2001 Sable.|`|plccXIVSaa	check the owners manual ,did the person who had it be for you state if it had it or not ?|`|c22cd3bc80b769e97ac9ae2bc60d368eaa	I very likely had a remote,  You should be able to buy one for about $25.  A nice dealership will not charge you to program it.  If you have the keyless entry "buttons" by the door, it too had a remote.  Take it to a Ford/Mercury dealer & they can find the code (likely hidden in the trunk).

Good Luck!|`|HNmO2ZwXaa	www.volvo.com|`|uhBxsmNtaa	The evaporative system checks for leaks in the fuel tank and lines and if it detects a small leak, it sets this code. The cause can be from a leaking gas cap, canister shut-off valve, fuel tank, fuel lines, or a charcoal canister. Take it to a shop that uses a smoke machine to detect small leaks in these types of systems.    Good Luck!

rPw8d3dBaa	OMG! I jus had the same dilemma between a Charger and a Mustang. I took Charger for a test drive to my dad's house. On the 10 min drive there, I seen 11 jus goin there and more coming back. I did not want a car that alot of ppl already had. I was like oh no! Both cars are heavy on gas but charger has less miles to the gallon. ALOT of ppl here have Chargers (Georgia). Who needs 4 doors? A family man or grocery shopping grandma!  The Mustang has 2 doors and that makes it fierce. Charger is big and bulky to me and the turns are wide. Needless to say I chose the Mustang, 06 baby!! When i took t for the test drive i was very satisfied. This muscle car has pure horsepower. You are young, u need a car that is real sporty and gets u alot of attention. Mustangs have a long credible, reputation. Go for a drive and see how many Chargers are on the road. I really hopes this helps you. Good luck!!|`|addaf7237cf3d32190cfc96546e98709aa	Charger is better in snow, but still bad with RWD.

v8TWvtQgaa	That one guy must not understand the question.. It's not cause one brand is diff like he said.     You are talking about the threads or the reach of the plug. He is talking about the outside overall lenght.     Now the reach of the plug depends on the year of the heads thats on your engine.  You didn't say the year..     but here is a gen break down for all gen I small block chevy engines.     1955-1967  used 14mm threads, .375" reach, washer gasket seat, 13/16" hex       68-95 used 14mm threads, .460" reach, tapered seat, 5/8" hex     96-02 vortec used 14mm threads, .708" reach, tapered seat, 5/8" hex     And just for the heck of it I throw in aftermarket heads like Brodix, Edelbrock, ARF alum heads     They use a 14mm thread, .750" reach, washer gasket seat, 5/8" hex      If you install a plug with a reach thats too short the firing tip of the plug will not stick out of the hole far enough and will be harder to light the air/fuel mixture.     Install a plug with too long of a reach and it could hit the piston or valves and cause major damage.     In your case sounds like wrong plugs installed|`|AA11745513	as long as it doesnt hit the cylinders when its running it should be fine|`|dae3073db78fe6f7ad0b8c6d0f05a940aa	It wont bother your truck really and the reason behind this is all in the manufacturers of the spark plugs they make their products just a little bit different then the next guy and you noticed it. unless you bought shorty plugs for headers no worries about them being shorter glad you car is running better|`|FjgLglhoaa	don't install them they might hit the pistons take back and get the right ones
c48nm70gaa	Take the Bosch plugs back and get the OEM AC-Delco parts. Small block Chevrolet's do not have 3/4 threaded reach in the cylinder heads. You'll hammer the pistons. Go directly to the New AC-Delco Website and feed in your application for the proper spark plugs. You didn't say which year yours was.|`|bb934e69e05c392a2b53f8c500208562aa	not necessarily. If you bought the spark plugs conforming to your car make and model it shouldn't be a problem. if you bought it without conforming to your car needs the threading could be unmatched to the car's threading thus can cause it to strip the threading in the engine for your spark plug. usually the piston would hit the plug if there is not a good enough gap.|`|d9426d337e1d8a5019525d7f0bc82fc6aa	Check the length from it's seat, where it stops on the head,to it's ground electrode. Some plugs have threads that look goofie.|`|c11fee07c98ac2e271f2ab5acd400781aa	Doesn't matter, since you will be changing those plugs sooner than later, anyway.    Bosch plugs do not seem to like anything but Euro cars for whatever reason.    Get ready for some practice!  (Cue Allen Iverson, "We talkin' about practice???")|`|AA11264416	why not take them back and get the right ones? but im not sure if it would effect the detonation int he cylinder but there's a chance the pistons would hit the spark plugs|`|Own0dhr0aa	DO NOT STICK THOSE PLUGS IN!!!!!!!!!!!    if there to long when the piston comes to the top it could hit the new plug and seriously damage the piston(and the plug)    its to easy to return the plugs and get the correct ones     and replacing pistons are not easy|`|lXIKeJQ8aa	Yes it will hurt in more ways than one!!     The length of the threads is called "reach". and this is how deep the plug goes into the head, now if the reach is too long you can cause immediate problems such as a piston strike which will damage the piston. If you are lucky enough to dodge that bullet, there is another problem waiting for you when you change the plugs again. The threads that are exposed inside of the head will become filled with carbon making them difficult to remove, and even if you are able to get them out the threads will probably be ruined.     Better on yourself or whoever works on the car next, would to be to get the correct plugs to start with.  By the way when you have the right ones, replace them one at a time so that you do not ruin the firing order.|`|XsZsk55Jaa	The position of the spark plug tip in the combustion chamber also affects combustion efficiency and how the gases enter and leave the cylinder.   I'd also question whether the plugs have the same heat range.  It's never a good idea to change plug characteristics without a good reason and knowing that the new plugs will solve the problem.  In the long run you'll probably be better off putting in a set of plugs that meet the OEM specifications..
Dvf3cPshaa	to pull the codes turn key on push off and warmer at the same time on your heater control.  should flash codes.  Idle could be high due to something actually holding the throttle open.  vacuum leaks will push ffalse air into the engine which the computer will adjust for with more fuel.  Most likely is a frozen stepper motor which controls idle speed.|`|Gn0nR2S1aa	Is it cold where you are? Sounds like a common sign of a carburetor choke running high to help warm the engine. If it's not cold, then it might just be the choke sticking.

VhhEz92Oaa	JTexas nailed the answer perfectly.    Every liquid has a vapor pressure and when the pressure gets low enough, the liquid turns to vapor.  Anything moving through the water that creates a low enough pressure will cavitate, or generate air out of the water.    Here's a picture of an anti-ventilation plate just above the prop:    http://www.purviancecs.com/images/mercru...    Here's a shot of a propeller cavitating:    http://www.solarnavigator.net/images/pro...    A little know fact:  The U.S. Navy uses a special 30MM projectile in their LAMPS helicopter's cannon.  Each fin stabilized bullet has a specially designed supercavitator on the nose to create a cloud of water vapor (gas) for the bullet to travel in, instead of water.  Almost no drag compared to a normal bullet and they can shoot submarines or mines that are very deep, though that depth is classified.  It's over 300 feet.    Google RAMICS for more reading.    Edit:  LMAO JTexas!  Skinny water...  hahaha!  I was wondering if someone would mention that.  I just yanked a photo off the net, and that prop does need a little TLC.|`|d9426d337e1d8a5019525d7f0bc82fc6aa	It's really called an ' anti-cavitation plate. It's just above the prop to help avoid cavitation.|`|Gignvz5Haa	It's the flat plate on an outboard or I/O that is just above the prop.  It's purpose is to allow the prop to ride near the surface without sucking air and slipping.|`|U24VtSlZaa	some call 'em "anticavitation plates" but what they really are, is "antiventilation plates".    When the prop spins, water pressure on the back side of the blades (actually the leading side) is reduced.  If it's reduced enough, water vaporizes and bubbles form.  That's cavitation.      It can happen if water is prevented from flowing over the blades, by vegetation or something caught on the lower unit, or damage on the prop or lower unit.      When the bubbles collapse they form a shock wave that can actually damage the prop.  A prop that's been cavitating will have spotty discoloration on the blades, looks kind of like burn marks.    If your prop is cavitating, it feels just like a spun hub -- the engine revs but the boat don't speed up, kind of like trying to go uphill with a slipping clutch.    Antiventilation plates can't do anything about cavitation, but they can prevent the prop from drawing surface air into the blades, which is the usual cause of ventilation.      Another cause is when exhaust gasses bleed onto the blades of a prop with through-hub exhaust.  Some props are designed with a "diffuser ring" welded to the aft end of the hub;  if it's missing or something gets caught in it, the result is ventilation.  Props without diffuser rings are flared at the trailing end of the hub.    Ventilation feels the same as cavitation.

1e85b081f9cb68b21b9d1357e658f9ccaa	Surface preparation is key to any respray. Having a large enough compressor to drive a paint gun and layers of sanded primer over bare metal. Expect to spend more than it would cost to have it done professionally tools thinners sand paper paint and spray guns. Then you can never get a clean enough environment to keep dirt out of the paint. Not to mention color sanding and polishing to get gloss.  Just putting paint on top of a shiny surface will peel off first car wash. Jet Black Flat Black or Shiny Black gets dusty so fast. Please wear respirator to keep dust out of your lungs.

You buy a plastic tube from Home Depot, then you go to a car in the junk yard, stick the long plastic tube into the gas tank, while kneeling on the ground (keep low, so the siphoned gas will flow better)... give a good hard SUCK on the end of the tube (that's not in the tank of course).. don't suck too long otherwise the gas will go down your throat.  When you see the gas start coming out of the tube, quickly put the tube into an empty can;  all the gas will come out of the junk car.    WARNING:  If you try this with other people cars, you could get beat up or down, whatever is your preference.
5295ce0578e5f91d2c73b820d4289eceaa	There is no way to add a digital tuner in line with an existing tuner. Actually most stereos made in the last 15-20 years are all digital and for steering wheel/dash controls to work they have to be digital to begin with. If steering wheel/dash control is the only issue then there are interfaces available to adapt factory steering wheel/dash controls to work on most major brand aftermarket units that have remote capability. They are not for the do it yourself type person as they can be tricky to install and program at times but they work well. I have installed several of them.  If you are referring to HD radio (HD=High Definition, not to be confused with Digital) then HD tuners can be added to almost any existing stereo.

If you don't have Excel, use this link http://www.box.net/shared/nkkw1dhk4g    See my site for more info http://spkrbox1.spaces.live.com    _________________________    WOW! Parrot has no clue. "Sparky will PROVE IT TO you otherwise"    NEVER set the gain by ear. This is the worst way possible.    There was a experiment where 15 pro audio shops were given the task to set a specific setup by ear. Only 2 had it set within tolerances of actual measurement. The other 13 had the system clipping while 3 had the system severely clipping. Do you feel comfortable with that?    The signal voltage out between stereo brands and can vary between 0.5 volts and 8 volts or more so I have no clue where Parrot's getting 300 millivolts (0.3 volts)WTF?    I loved this, " ....the amp will run at full power any way your volume is what will distort if you try to over drive of the head unit ( as ALL AMP's DO ) thus causing the amp to distort producing DC current which will damage your speakers"    First off, the amp does NOT run at full power all the time, this is easily measured by the AC voltage going out to the sub(s) at various volume levels using a steady tone.    Second, distortion is any variance of the waveform output that's different than the input waveform. Clipping falls under this catagory and is a TYPE of distortion. Noting not ALL forms of distortion are bad such as THD (Total Harmonic Distortion) nor is there ANY proof distortion can cause damage (see links at the very bottom).    Third, DC is NOT a possibiltiy (unless the amp has a SERIOUS problem). Pulsating DC is possible, but the frequency upon when the pulsated DC hits the sub is shorter than the actual signal frequency - proof - this is what clipping looks like - http://i81.photobucket.com/albums/j230/s...    Notice the flat lines at the top and bottom are shorter than the pulse width of the signal state change = NOT DC!!!!!!!!    "HOW THE HELL THIS WILL HELP YOU TUNE I DON'T KNOW"    Simple, follow the directions! It is after all based on Ohm's Law which I don't expect Parrot to know anything about.    _____________________________    Here are some more unknown truths:      I can drive speakers with a 100% clipped square wave signal all day long with no problems as long as the thermal and mechanical limits of the speaker are not exceeded.     I can feed a speaker 100% distortion all day long with no damage as long as the thermal and mechanical limits of the speaker are not exceeded.     I can exceed the thermal and/or mechanical limits of a speaker and watch it fail in short order.    These are electrical and physical truths and anything else is a myth.  __________________    Oh and Parrot:    Great suggestion  Here's a good link to a tutorial on setting the gain the right way.   http://www.blazerforum.com/m_66322/mpage...

Complex job for the inexperienced.|`|9525d359baf8efc557de889ce49b8f24aa	Take the car to one of the many auto parts stores, such as Pep Boys, or any parts store.  they might install a new set of blades for you, right there in the parking lot.  Our local auto parts stores will do that.  You have probably broken the blade, not the motor.  Also, maybe the part of the wiper arm that goes onto the drive mechanism might have come off or loosened up, so have them check it. Last resort is go to the dealer and pay thru the nose!    It is a good idea, when scraping the windshield, to free up the blades, if they are frozen to the glass, or into the snow on the windshield.  That way they won't break when you forget to free them and turn on the wipers!|`|bb934e69e05c392a2b53f8c500208562aa	if you live near Pep Boys or any auto store all you do is pay for the wiper blades and usually they should be free for the auto store to install it for you. since it only takes about a few minutes to put it on.

9525d359baf8efc557de889ce49b8f24aa	Well, any car with that many miles on it, will surely have more wrong with it, than what youi have stated!   Personally, i wouldn't touch it with a long pole, let alone pay a lot of money for it!    To open the hood, assuming the latch/cable, linkage is broken or non-operative, will take a lot of work, taking out the grille, or some panels, to reach up inside to unhook the hood catch.  And you will have to take off the inner upholstery panel to access the outside door handle mechanism for repairs.  Neither are fun jobs, and if you have never done that, you are in for a lot of headaches!  I'd pass on that offer!  Too many things to go bad, at the high mileage!  It might cost a hundredbucks-might get away cheaper,-depends on the time it takes!  And at big bucks per hour, it won't be cheap!|`|tBq6ZDZvaa	the truck is 10 years old and has 228,000 miles!! it should be a no brainer that they are asking way too much for that thing even if it was clean it still has 228,000 miles and is 10 years old not worth it get something with fewer miles.|`|6109a985cc82f33cc8cd871057b2fac7aa	that sucks|`|d9426d337e1d8a5019525d7f0bc82fc6aa	Offer'em $1800 as is, or the full price if they'll fix it.

e53807be9e34b50fae02ba7c73274c6baa	A good rule of thumb is to buy a car that costs about half of your annual income.     For example, if you make $20K a year, you should not buy a car that costs over $10K and you can finance it for between 48 and 72 months.     Tips - Unless you are going to pay cash, make sure you find financing on your own at a local bank or credit union.  A dealer is looking out for their best interest and you need to look out for yours.|`|3MTYGEbWaa	The formula used by loan companies is that if your monthly debts, including a new car payment, is less than 36% of your monthly gross income (before taxes), then you are OK. You can use a car loan calculator to figure out what your car payments will be. Here's one:    http://www.atuoloancalculatoronline.com    .|`|myTWyKS6aa	How much money do you earn in a month? How much do you have in savings?|`|xsZfN0JHaa	It is nerve wrecking the first time, but you will survive! The thing to do is go to a financial services place-Bank, or credit Union and check on the interest rate and loan availability. If you have a good credit rating - no problem. Then check with the Dealerships in town for a reasonable price vehicle for you. Many are willing to give you discounts because the the slow vehicle sales and economy.  Remember too! If your car now is in good condition it is worth value in trade-in. and it helps to have some cash towards the down payment. Say a $1000.00 or two.
N6zo8Zo3aa	I agree with Muatang except you can put a charger on it without taking it anywhere just put a charger on it right there.after the battery is fully charged . Have a load test done on the battery. that will tell you if the battery is any good|`|skfHV92caa	Cold winter snaps can kill a battery quick.  The 20min you allowed the battery to charge from your vehicle was a decent charge; however, your battery may need to have a slow charge put on it so it can receive a deep charge to bring the battery back up to capacity.  Charging your battery by allowing to car to run does not give it a deep charge after being completely dead.  If you don't have a charger, I would take the battery out and have it charged by one of the parts stores so you can get a full charge.  Hope this helps.|`|6xyeYjkkaa	You need to pull the battery and take it somewhere where it can be fully recharged. Running it for 20 to 30 minutes will not fully charge it and it will just die again. The repeated partial charges will soon kill the battery. Get it fully charged.|`|ZbZtJ105aa	Jump it again and drive it around it helps a lot more than just letting it sit.

You will get it to work with jump starts but a better idea is to hook up your battery overnight to a 12-volt slow charger (not too expensive at Canadian Tire or other Auto parts stores). It's a handy thing to have around for car batteries, specially in winter.  If you try that, or jump start and drive it around 30min (not parked with motor running), the charge should hold if your battery is any good.   If your next start is good then you can keep the battery for at least another year, but will work better if you start it & drive it regularly every day.  If your next start is still weak then change the battery.    A decent battery should hold the charge even more than one week with no starts.
skfHV92caa	You may want to check the rear whell bearings.  That is really the only thing left if you replaced brakes and rotors and rotated tires.  Wheel bearing noise appears while you are driving and often sounds worse when making turns.  You may even feel some vibration coming from the rear.  I would jack the car up and move the wheel up and down  and side to side to see if you have excessive movement.  If you do it is probably a wheel bearing.

skfHV92caa	Sounds like you have a low battery charge.  Try jumping off the vehicle to see if it starts.  If it does you may need a battery or your alternator was not charging properly.  More than likely you probably need a battery.  If your car starts after jumping off I would have the battery tested and have the charging system checked just to be safe.

cf646b324b58c7a33ef1f333d5811134aa	From my experience, i have about 4 different scenarios i can put forward.    The first is most relative - My brothers Kia mentor. I guess you could say it's a similar car in terms of how long you could expect it to last. He had to replace the timing belt, get a new clutch, had a few issues with the gearbox and it was just overall a pretty crappy car.  Went to a friend's mechanic - said it wasn't worth fixing.  Went to a family mechanic - said "lets give it a go".  Everything fixed.  Brother said it's running so much smoother.  It's still a pretty crappy car, but it gets him from A to B. Hasn't run into a problem since and can pretty much expect another few good years out of it.    Scenario 2 - Family member gave a car to another family member.  Transmission fluid was leaking bad.  It had just problem after problem.  I guess you could class it as beyond a crappy car.  She fixed one problem, another problem would arise.  This occurred a few times.  But now... $4000 later. She has a functioning car. However, you really can't tell how long it's going to last.    Scenario 3 - My dad had a Toyota. He had a leakage above the alternator.  Constantly weeping above it.  This problem could not be fixed, no matter how good a mechanic.  Thousands was spent on this car.  Eventually sold it as a pretty crappy car.    Scenario 4 - My car.  Just bought it. Looked back through all the records and the previous owner has spent in excess of $6000 on this car.  It is a Honda so the parts would be more expensive then your Hyundai.  Anyway, he's handed it over to me.  He hadn't had any problems in about 1 year.  My whole family agrees that this is the most solid car we've had in our family.  It is just immaculate and runs beautifully.    Conclusion - I, personally, think you should go ahead and fix this car. A/C belt is not a big issue.  Timing belt is a common maintenance thing.  Clutch - has to be replaced eventually.  Bearings and brake cables are strange issues, but if fixed correctly you won't have any more problems with them.|`|5kVyZyGGaa	It just depends on how much you use the car, as in how many miles you put on it per year. if you put say about 5 thousand miles every year the car should be fine, u may have little problems but it is better than getting a new car because there is always a break in period and if you buy a used car you never know how the person treated it before you, while you know what you have done to your car and you should pretty much know what will go wrong.|`|d26cf5d0bc2ff44ed0bd39e786f279e6aa	As others have said, it pays to try and do these repairs yourself.

tlue10gAaa	Whatever title you receive you have to present to Tennessee to obtain a Tennessee title. Generally, if you have a title that says "rebuilt" you will get a title that says "rebuilt." It's called branding and each state honors the other states brand.    Keep in mind the vehicle has been severely damaged and repaired. That is why you are getting it "at an awesome price" because it didn't come that way from the factory. It is worth less than a vehicle that wasn't damaged.|`|XsZsk55Jaa	Getting the title doesn't guarantee that the car can be registered.  It will have to pass a safety inspection.

Most modern vehicles have a "squeaker" that hits the brake rotor when they are at minimum. this is to tell you your brakes are worn out. you want to get the brake pads replaced before the entire pad material is gone or the rotors will be ruined and a much more expensive repair. go to a reputable repair shop immediately.|`|efa550f6673c521a6c47e67cc5153a8eaa	depends on whether they are squealing while you are driving along or squealing on apply, if they are quiet all the time until you step on the pedal and they squeal when you come to a stop then they are probably just dirty and need to be cleaned and deglazed, if they are squealing all the time and the noise goes away when you apply the brakes, this is the wear indicators on the brake pads hitting the rotors and you need to replace the pads as soon as possible, most of the time the rotors can be resurfaced unless they are worn too thin already. hard to say how long you can drive like this since every-body's driving style varies, but when they start to grind you have ruined the rotors, get it fixed asap. also when replacing pads you should always resurface the rotors as well so that you have both surfaces ready to wear together rather than the rotor worn th the old pad because that can cause brake noise, also rotors are metal discs and get very hot and tend to warp, this can cause a pulsation, bottom line is replace the pads, make sure whoever does it cleans and lubes all the slides and hardware, applies stop squeak to the pads and resurfaces the rotors.|`|0qGwCA1Baa	if you got a grinding when stopping Ur doing damage to the rotors,but if its just squealing its time and you might have 1 week but when you stop and its not a squeal and its more the a grinding metal on metal that's when its doing damage,is it just doing it when you stop or always while driving,if you had the cheap pads installed it could just be excessive brake dust|`|ksFD7EoSaa	When the squeaking began, it was a warning to you to go and have them checked.

lM9NvSwnaa	Well, I have a 2001 250 ninja and have ridden it for 600 miles stopping only for gas and lunch.  If the bike is maintained-it is a vehicle like every other mechanical thing made out there-properly the bike will last indefinately and will take you where ever you want to go.  I personally have been no sorer riding my 250 ninja for a day than riding my 1500 Drifter cruiser all day.  Both are very comfortable to ride, but then again comfort is kinda a personal thing.  what is for me, may not be for you.|`|YupMCYHlaa	Years ago, when I first got into motorcycles, they used to say that there was no practical reason for a bike to be bigger than 250cc.  This was a day before most roads were freeways.  If you never went faster than 50 or 55, you didn't need anything bigger than 250cc.  In those days, people used to cross continents on 250s.  In fact in those days a 'touring bike' was any bike you could bungee a sleeping bag to. 8^)    And these were horrible Britbikes that leaked oil, that you had to adjust the valves every 2000 mi. or so, and they needed rings and valves at 8000 mi.  In those days you spent equal time working on a bike as riding it.    A 250 Ninja is not the most comfortable bike for a long trip at high speed.  It will do, though.  When you're young, comfort is not as big a consideration.  But I did 300 mi. in a day with my BSA C15 all the time.  God, I loved that bike!  (When it ran.  Which was about half the time.)  If you can do 100 mi., 300 mi. is just more of the same. 8^)|`|sgjjwXwwaa	Sure you can.

That's going to be a 5 hour minimum ride and that length of time on a bike will leave you a bit saddle sore. The last long trip i took was about 350 miles.

Most small dealerships use a flooring company to finance the cars.  The flooring company takes the cars back, auctions them to other dealers and thats that.  Sometimes the cars are bought by wholesalers who then try to resell them, or auction them off.  But they rarely ever wind up in some sort of public disposal sale, if that is what you are looking for.|`|a3838c0cd2f7f63124657ac7f4657dfbaa	The new vehicles will go to another dealer.

hlve6Engaa	if your going to reuse the old pistons at least get new rings for it and replace all the main bearings. i'm not sure how to check for cracks though without taking it somewhere. this is your chance to put some better parts in your motor like higher comp. pistons, better rods... if your going to beat a mild 350 you'll need to do it right. honestly since you have it apart I would take it to a machine shop and have it done right (magnafluxed, bored and honed, and fix the bearing if it needs it) you'll need a very solid 305 to beat a 350.    you would still need to do a lot to get 250hp out of a 305. they aren't as sensitive to mods like a 350 is. plus you need a good intake, carb, headers and high flow exhaust. the heads would need to be replaced or rebuilt with bigger valves like 1.94 intake. you'll also need a better cam, nothing sick just something better than stock. its going to take some money. its an expensive hobby|`|EFQmk31Uaa	If you dont see any cracks thats a good start.  Also make sure there are no ridges in the piston walls or pistons at all.  You will need to remove the ridge at the top of piston bore, nothing in these areas should catch your finger nail if you rub it along the metal.      Magnafluxing the block and heads are a good idea for a reliable rebuilt runner.      If you want to smoke his 350, install high compression pistons and a name brand cam with mid level RPM range.  Make sure to match the intake and carb to the performance you want, like a 600cfm is plenty and port match all the passages.|`|ZDV5Bvazaa	i was at my husbands side during many motor installations and rebuilding also. if you have bottom end exposed you can price around for pistons ,but if they look good with naked eye then your fine. BUT always replace rockers, arms, oil pump, heads are important to get done though. this is a great website,hiperformer.com it tells you everything . good luck !!and be careful.|`|d9d7dbffacb9c5256ef7afd69e6023b6aa	It is expensive and less fun to pay for the work, but is is usually fastest and best to have a good machine shop go over your parts to check them for serviceability.    1. If you have the equipment for doing fluorescent dye penetrant inspections, then you don't have to do the magnetic dye penetrant method. Most people don't. The reason for doing these tests is because cracks start out too small to detect with the naked eye.    2. Magnetic dye penetrant inspection for cracks. Precision measurement for wear or warping.    3. The worst a crack can get is to cause a catastrophic failure.    4. Measure them for excessive wear. They can get kind of egg shaped.    5. The bearing journals need to be all in a line. If a journal is lumpy from galling, then it may have not enough clearance in one area for the bearing. The block can be checked or re-machined to fix any damaged journals.|`|tO7Rpjmqaa	Spend the extra money and do it right the first time.

Dont forget an alignment after it is replaced.|`|9525d359baf8efc557de889ce49b8f24aa	I'd say, your best bet would be to have a dealer shop, or a reputable other shop do that job for you!  there are too many ways to get hurt, if you don't have the right tools for the job!  It might look easy, but getting the parts off and back on, without having a bunch of trouble, will probably not be easy!    I'd think it will be a dealer item.   And, you can not replace that item with a hammer, screw-driver, and several box wrenches!    you will need a hydraulic floor jack, a safety stand or two, maybe a spring compressor, a bunch of big and small wrenches, and a lot of patience!  Also a tool to remove the tie rod end.  I have used a BFH, but its tricky to use it!  Some mechanics call it a "salad fork"!|`|iNVYvoAqaa	HI.

Car tanks are air tight since they use fuel pump.     Bike tank only uses gravity and there is a vent from which pressure generated by evaporation due to heating up of tank in sun is released.    Keeping the lid open which only reduce your petrol quantity.    So here is a tip.    If you are finicy about mileage of your bike or car. Fill petrol either very early in the morning (before 7am) or late at night( after 10pm). That way you actually get more petrol in your tank.

The sub will only be a  4ohm load.     If you connect two subs in parallel you will have a 2 ohm load BUT the  power handling of both subs will be summed.|`|PleHYu5Jaa	just hook it up!  All you will get is 4 ohm response out of the amp. if you had 2 4ohm subs and they were wired in series than they would pull 2 ohms off the amp. or a dual 4 ohm voice coil sub with the coils wired in series. if you run a 4 ohm sub on the amp it wont hurt anything but you get the full power output of the amp.

wMh38OzVaa	no it don't make your car lighter.Mythbusters proved nitrogen does nothing for your car to make it lighter.|`|TdrgZwnoaa	Nitrogen does not affect your cars tires or handling in any way. And All Season tires aren't. They are only 3-Season tires.|`|5kVyZyGGaa	Nitrogen is lighter which give you better gas mileage but it shouldn't effect how the tires perform because the thread is the same.|`|84150d8c6cd9fc2e974272b0e0ddc3c3aa	Either you haven't been taught to drive well in winter, or you don't have the appropriate tread.  Winter tires will always have better winter traction than all-season tires.  Summer (touring) tires without the M&S designation are dangerous to use in winter.  Some all-season tires are better in snow than others, and, if your tread is not a minimum of 4/32" you don't have enough tread on even a good all-season to grip snow and ice enough for safety.    Edit  Initially you never said you had all-season tires on that vehicle.  Now I need to know how much tread is left.  If it is under 4/32", the tires are poor in the wet, bad on ice, and useless in snow, despite being legal.  Note also that all-season tires are also not all created equal.  Before I bought my present tires, I did a lot of research on traction, and even in the same brand, some all-seasons are better than others.  So, it still goes back to the tires, assuming the alignment and suspension are okay as well.|`|hbanGS3Qaa	no   excuse me i ment to say NO  its not helium   its nitrogen  and the manufacturer uses it because it does not expand and contract as much as the air molicules do   when it comes to xtream heat or cold.  not because its lighter.  the other cars react differently because of wright and power and power distribution factors and also weather or not its front wheel drive, rear wheel drive, all wheel drive, and many other factors like tire size.  definatly not because of Nitrogen  and any ways most of the air you breath is nitrogen and only about 20% oxygen at sea level less oxygen at higher altitutes|`|BUPiXrxVaa	All filling tires with nitrogen does, is keep the tire from leaking through the sidewall as fast as compressed air does. Which is not even noticeable in most tires and it removes moisture from the air in the tire. Unless you have a compressor that is pumping water with the air, there is not enough moisture in compressed air to make a difference on anything.IE Wheel balance.    Now if you just want a conversation piece, nitrogen will give you something to talk about and nitrogen filled tires usually have those cool looking little fluorescent green valve caps on them. Other than that it pretty much does nothing different.|`|O8zOZzO6aa	Yes. The nitrogen is making your tires lighter. Consult your vehicle manual or service center. You probably need to change the gas for snowy road conditions.|`|Oq8G5Cvlaa	Its a waste of money!|`|jFwuiRKxaa	If you put to much in the car will float away

(1995 and earlier had a separate fluid reservoir in back, just above the taillight, accessed by raising the liftgate.)    However, they did have 2 separate pumps to control the fluid spray for front or rear. So, you likely have a bad washer fluid pump, a broken hose somewhere between the pump and the back nozzle, or a clogged nozzle.     The pumps are located on the bottom of the washer fluid reservoir (along with the level switch). The pump for the rear is mounted slightly higher, so you still have some fluid for cleaning the front since the windshield is more important.

Assuming you did you will have to turn the steering wheel stop to stop.  Doing this starts fluid into the system.  You will have to add more fluid after several cycles and once all the air is out of the system top off you fluid to the "warm" or "hot" mark on the stick.  Recheck in a day or two in case a bit more air was removed.|`|AA10420446	If your power steering goes out you can still turn your wheel. Its hard but still turns. sounds like something else happened.

Its smooth power,  The only downside is coming from a 85 ( if thats what ur riding) when u get into a bad situation there is more power to hurt you,  Accidently hitting the throttle is not a good thing, but Yea the kx250f is a awesome bike!
71133c5b27fbdaa8629cfbb5dafa77afaa	1) no anti freeze is engine coolant has nothing to do with steering. you probably had something else low possibly the power steering fluid.    2) you need to change the filter and fluid asap. DO NOT do a transmission flush those are well known to cause damage due to not changing the filter and back flushing the system and getting stuff into passages and plugging them up and not allowing fluid through.|`|i2V17yi4aa	1.anti freeze does not go into power steering!lol     2. you need to change it. good transmission will look like red wine on a napkin.    yes it does mean much.    yes you can do both!|`|51d9e39c71aaaed7424c9ac49e9069c5aa	1.

The original tire size circumference as compared to the new *planned tire size in Tire Revolutions Per Mile makes the difference. For that information go to: tirerack.com and open up any brand tire. Click on the word spec. (specification.) You will see a chart at the far right that has revolutions per mile. Compare your originals to something that travels no less than 10 revolutions pre mile (that would be a larger circumference tire. It'll only slow down your speedometer 1-2 miles per hour.|`|ujT5teZgaa	It's really a gamble. You'd have to go to some forums and ask... www.streetfire.net is a great place with awesome people.

The speed sensor or the gear for the speedometer will need to be replaced. It will need to on a dino to see how far it will be off. So the right part can be used in the transmission.|`|efa550f6673c521a6c47e67cc5153a8eaa	depends on tire profile, if you go with a larger rim, go with a lower profile tire accordingly, measure the total diameter of the rim and tire assembly that is on the truck now and try to stay as close as you can to that, the further you deviate from that the further your speedometer will be off, once you've put on the wheels and tires you want calculate your speedometer error so you know your speed. won't hurt anything to have the speedometer read a few miles off as long as you know about it. make sure all 4 tires are the same diameter if you have abs|`|a87d4641b9042b2de200a53fc1c2586aaa	i searched ur car on google images...i am sure dat 24 inch rims will fit on ur car....i am sure good luck...i think 26 will also fit....!!!!|`|vMxyoFUdaa	Ok, who knows if they'll fit. (you can make them fit, but who knows if it'll be a right fit).    second of all, yes there are different ratios between your gear sizes (Transmission and Rear Differential) and the fact that 22 inch rims are a bigger size (ratio) than what the speedometer is calibrated to.    Just for a side note, will screw up your alingment, the driveability. Your brakes will wear out prematurely and suspension components will wear at a faster rate.     Your pick...|`|OdilX6aeaa	I recommend buying a ScanGuageII. It is VERY easy to install, you can adjust your car's speedometer with it.  It also gives you a LOT of information about your car as your driving, for example MPG, engine RPM, miles to empty, a bunch of really neat things.  Check them out! (they also can read the code that trips your Check Engine Light if it were to ever come on, so you know whats wrong with your truck before you turn it to a mechanic!!)|`|HpwyYmoIaa	anything that big will mess up your speedometer, you can get it recalibrated but I dont know how to i just know people do it|`|JUrcvLklaa	Yes it will mess with your speedometer, that ranger stock should have I would venture to guess 16 inch wheels...   You can go a half inch larger diameter (thats 1/2 inch total, not on each side) and your computer will auto correct...  Any bigger then that, and you will have to take it in to get tuned...    I would not suggest 20 or 22 inch wheels on a ranger...  they look pretty dang big even on a full sized f150...  Im my opinion, Do not go bigger then 17 or 18 inch max...      Not to mention, you will kill your gas mileage if you go too big.. The engine will have to use more gas per each revolution of the tire = less mpg..
7b0820512f00a09eb336e976c90fa861aa	it sounds like the battery is takong a dump. have it replaced and recheck the charging system.|`|c48nm70gaa	Normal alternator voltage is between 13.5 -14.0 volts. If it's not within that range it's not charging properly. You could let run through a tank full of gas @13 volts and not charge the battery. On the other end of the scale voltages over 14 volts actually boils the acid/distilled water out of the battery and usually winds up warping the cell plates.|`|w5BjzqH1aa	I will start this off. The alternator should be putting out 14.5 volt to charge the battery. 13 volt is a fully charged battery. At idle the car need to run 30 minutes.|`|a3838c0cd2f7f63124657ac7f4657dfbaa	13 volts is on the low side although you don't mention at what RPM.

You can take it to a good parts store and they will check it for you. 13 volts is sufficient to charge the battery.
KMeqvCCOaa	did you change the combination valve to the same one that was in the donor car?  You need to make sure that the correct amount of  fluid pressure is being diverted to the front and rear cylinders.      That being said, there most likely is air in the system still.  The mechanic working on the vehicle didn't get all of it out.  If you have antilock brakes, there may be air inside the Brake Pressure Modulator Valve.|`|5kVyZyGGaa	it sounds like he didn't bleed the brakes it has to be that or that the pad dont contract on the rotor so you might have to adjust that.|`|oiW7wZkuaa	Just a thought here .....you replaced your 1989 system with a system from a 1994 car .....so you're using parts that are not new and are 14 or almost 15 years old. Maybe the master cylinder from that '94 donor car is bad ....a bum master cylinder can have bad internal seals which will cause a soft pedal and prevent maximum braking.    If this were my Mustang I would've spent the bucks on a new master cylinder and, while I'm at it, replace the 14 year old rubber brake lines with new ones.     Bleeding the brakes ....did your mechanic bench bleed the master cylinder before reinstalling it on your car? Air trapped in the MC is tough to remove using the brake system bleeding method. System bleeding means .....you start at the farthest point from the MC (the right rear) and bleed that circuit ...followed by the left rear, the right front and the left front. Using a pressure bleeder can make this an easy task.....|`|d26cf5d0bc2ff44ed0bd39e786f279e6aa	Bleed the brakes again, you've got air in the lines somewhere.  You may want to check if there's any sensors you may have overlooked.|`|w5BjzqH1aa	The brake paddle will be on the soft side. The stopping should be a lot better.

(10 or so) push it as far as it will easily go (dont force it) and release slowly. repeat until pedal becomes firmer. then have the brakes bled again. if you have the proper tools, you can do it yourself. its really easy. just pump up the pedal and hold it down, then have someone loosen up the brake bleeder valve on the caliper until fluid comes out. do this 2 or 3 more times. then top off the master cylinder. repeat for each caliper. hope this helps :-)|`|M7G3MZb5aa	sometimes when you bleed the brakes, you can accidently let the fluid get too low in the resevoir and suck and air pocket into the lines (again)    So you bleed them, all the air comes out and you see clean fluid, and you THINK your done, but in reality you have to bleed the more to pass the air pocket AALLLLLLL the way through the lines.    bleed the crap out of the system, you may have to move a lot fo fluid through the lines before the air pocket finally spits itself out.    ****i also hat the haters of yahoo answers who thumbs down every answer....i see thumbs down coming.....|`|0qGwCA1Baa	sounds like air in system.why would i get 2 thumbs down when i know for a fact that there still air in the brake system some haters on yahoo lol|`|E7RhMRKhaa	Bleed the brakes again.

36ba3084f158ff6094a5acf141b61ec9aa	When you are on the interstate you want to be able to merge and accelerate with ease. While a 250cc bike will run 75mph it will not give you that merging power you need. You want to lead the way, not get pushed up the on ramp. I would not recommend anything smaller than a 500cc for your first bike. You can get a 2005 Kawasaki Ninja 500cc for around $3000 in great shape. as for insurance you have to get a separate policy, car insurance is usually a six month deal but most companies want the motorcycle to be covered for 12 months. It's a gimmick to make sure you don't just cover it during the riding season. Also if you pay cash for the bike so you can have on liability coverage that will help keep the cost of insurance down.|`|556cc214a7493962346e6f458688b23baa	In some states you are restricted to no more that 250cc till you are 18.  A 250cc Yamaha V Star will do 75 mph and its pretty easy to find used, low mileage models.    As a man under 27, you're going to find that insurance is high for you.  You may have to have your parents insure the bike in order to make it affordable (especially if you ride a sport bike). Progressive probably  has the best rates for you.  Shop around.|`|NFUJAOtTaa	Kawasaki KLR650|`|cYJWOV5Qaa	Hey man, I just got my license 6 months ago and bought an older bike that needed some work and it was 1200.

AA10401102	ECM stands for Electronic Control Module.It is a mini computer that excepts signals from various sensors in the vehicle and sends signals to various switches to make your car run.|`|vMxyoFUdaa	Quick fact: Electronic Control Module (ECM)    Depending on what type of vehicle you drive will vary how many of these control modules your vehicle has. For example your engine has its own control module to monitor various engine operations such as engine coolant temperature, fuel pressures, air flow rates. It also control many engine functions such as your ignition timing, and fuel injection rate (just to name a few basic, some engines have way more engine components.) Another example of what a control module can do is think of your radio (something has to control its functions) or your remote key (something has to recognize your key and tell the car to unlock all doors, blip the horn, turn the lights on and etc.)

I essence you are paying extra for a de-contented automobile that might get to 60 MPH 0.03 seconds faster that the standard model. A FOOL and his money are soon parted.|`|5kVyZyGGaa	it depends on what you use the car for. if you are just using it as say a daily drive then no, hell no because its alot more expensive but what it does matter is if you track the car that's when it makes the world of difference. the lighter the faster the time they will get on a course which will win races|`|M8dmeAv6aa	They must be if someone will buy them.|`|UE100SUUaa	Lighter is faster.  Lighter handles better.  Lighter accelerates faster.    But with these models, the interiors have been stripped bare. I haven't researched the Superleggera, but the other two don't have AC, carpet, 'normal' seats (they're racing seats; not the coziest for long distances) or other things that make a daily driver comfortable.    If you want a 'cool' sports car you can drive on the road, go for the normal trim. If you have daily driver down and want an edge on the track, go for the racing models.
PrqCDZ7raa	Yes, watch out for the streetcars. They're on rails, so they don't get out of your way, YOU have to get out of THEIR way.
AA10792232	Chevy trucks are sweet.  You'll probably get a billion different answers on this one.|`|AA12084524	I think ford|`|AA12374243	Dodge has the meanest looking trucks out there.  I think they're the best looking.  Good luck with your gas mileage though.  They guzzle.  Although I did hear that the new Dodge engines are able to conserve gas by automatically switching from 8 to 4 cylinders when not needed.|`|AA11134857	Ford Trucks- I've had three. A 1976 F350, a 2002 Ranger, and now a 2004 F250 superduty.
AA12340453	Yes don't keep driving it you will cause more damage.|`|AA11867612	just park wher you don't have to backup. you will still do damage to the trany thou.|`|AA10052473	drive the transmission already is gone, only take the road asistance on you cell phone to have tow service|`|AA10148319	Nah, drive it like you stole it...it'll run better.|`|7ab50145fb63da54185167e7ffe6e32eaa	the whole transmission need rebulit anyways so you cannot make it any worse
5246474edf8633a64f000e90cc6941e6aa	You need to get an oxygen sensor and get your catlytic converter checked out.|`|42b5a504b6aa2132fc2a3b47bca20be4aa	get to a mechanic and have them read the code to find out what the check engine light means. it sounds like your oxygen sensors are shot. they can be expensive to buy and install. Again, get to a mechanic and hace them connect a code reader to your vehicle to determine the exact issue.|`|6937f2a24cb806097f40cee31af265beaa	You travel to an Isuzu dealer and ask them what is wrong.  It sounds to me like a lean condition, probably bad intake gaskets on a 3.2. That can cause all of your above problems...  but before you fix that, have a dealer do a proper diagnosis on the vehicle...   Then you will know what is causing your problems.  Good Luck

AA11966034	No they are too tall|`|76f9a5568c25d14e1947e68605dcb0dfaa	whats ur current rim size, tire size, and space for the tire and rim?
AA12359560	Easy to do, but before you replace yours, keep in mind that that motor almost never goes out.  Usually, all you have to do is to unplug the wiring harness and  wire brush the contacts on both the male and female ends.  If it still does not work when you plug it back in, wiggle the plug a little and it will probably start working.  I have had to do this on over 100 Chevy trucks in the last 10 years. If you need the part, most wrecking yards sell it for around $15.|`|AA11792537	I did one on a 95 chevy caprice ... same mech ... do you need advice ... speific question?

Alignments just make sure that the tread is even with the surface..for example toe in or toe out can durastically wear your tires,, or even a worn out ball joint will do this as well|`|AA11209104	nothing unless you have wrecked it or something like that|`|7c453c69a2fd3933d0656c03f5488174aa	You will potentially experience tire wear much faster than normal, and even get bald spots  or streaks in your tire. it will also reduce your gas mileage. A severe enough mis-alignment can also cause undue stress on your suspension system.|`|ebfa7f264501dc2f3229554f9b049da1aa	You would just end up with a tacky Monte Carlo. If the alignment is fine before the wire wheels will not change that. If the wheels are not true, you will need to have them adjusted at a shop that specializes in that or you will have wobbles.
AA11185990	A crank/camshaft sensor is located behind the harmonic balancer which the tells the computer first where number 1 cylinder is.  Then provides info. to the computer to the firing order of the vehicle. There are blades in behind the harmonic balancer that pass through the camshaft/crank sensor, acting like a hall effect in which the computer can see the voltage spikes of the passing blades.|`|AA10823131	Many newer cars have them. the camshaft position sensor is an essential input for the ECM to determine ignition timing.   The camshaft sensor, is a single hall effect magnetic device, which is activated by a single vane driven by the camshaft. This sensor provides CID information for the ignition coil and fuel synchronization. The sensor is in the location normally used for the distributor.|`|6937f2a24cb806097f40cee31af265beaa	What is a device that reads crankshaft revolutions and relays information to ECM. Can reek havoc on engine management if not reading properly....    Any thing else Alex?
