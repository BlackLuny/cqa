This is my essay question or watchu call it.   ----------------------------------      In an essay of at least two well-developed paragraphs of eight to twelve sentences each, compare and contrast the major groups of people that typically support the Republican and Democratic parties.

I'm doing this experiment in school for my junior cert so it's important I get it perfect.      This is the investigation I got:      "Investigate the relationship between the size of the electric current passing through a length of wire and its heating effects"      equipment I used: 70ml water, variable resister, ammeter, heating coil/heating element(it looked just like a spring), wires, thermometer      I did the experiment only 3 times because I was short on time and measured the temperature of the water before I turned on the power and after the 3 minutes      The difference of temperature is what I graphed.      I left the experiment run for 3 minutes at a time and changed the resistance each time but at the end when I did the graph my teacher said said something must have gone wrong because the graph should have been a certain shape and it wasn't it and hence my question.      Could anyone tell me anything about this experiment?   Also here are some other less Technical parts of the experiment that I also need some help with.      1 - Identify the problem in your own words   2 - safety precautions   3 - ways to improve this experiment   4 - list of tasks to be carried out during the investigation ( don't really understand this)
20090307140325AAkxdey	Education & Reference;Words & Wordplay	Does this sound MODEST or general sounding???? (OPEN LINK!) Thanks "?"?	I want to post it online - Titled - My Semi Professional Life -   If it weren’t for the cut off mark of one page, and my pocket full of white lies, my work resume would be littered with typical full time entry level occupations. At various times I've managed over 50 personnel along with billing and scheduling as a secretary for a local security company; Cooked & Cleaned House for the elderly, been a waitress, a Subway sandwich artist, a Rite Aid cashier attendant, A Tulare County pre-foreclosure agent, Assisted a private investor in putting together a Huge Workshop Seminar for Real Estate, Worked as an independent negotiator for a Real Estate Brokerage getting commissions off of houses that I brought to him, working retail at the mall as a sales clerk (my sales topped the managers), then finally jumped on the bandwagon with Daniel when real estate was through the roof. I never in my life, believed I would work in this field of employment. I was never taught a thing about real estate by anyone, until I proved that I could help benefit someone financially as an intern or partner. After all, I was just another young girl. One who wasn’t outspoken or sought to be in the spotlight. I read up on plenty of books related to the subject, and felt confident enough to make my first negotiated contract. I remember how nervous I was, made the deal, and the rest is history. I realized around the year of 2006 how Lazy local Realtors were. I realized that there were a lot of potential deals to be made because if the Realtors weren’t making deals with out of state people (trying to get listings) who was? Apparently no one. My first independent job was working with Daniel, buying crappy pieces of land, from the out of state owners, and reselling to local California folks, at higher prices. Back then people were lending their money everywhere so that’s where we got our start up money. It was a good way to get into the business because we were putting extremely low amounts of money up, and getting a fair share back. Of course those days are over, however Daniel and I have still continued to find more and more areas of interest that other people just don’t seem to follow up on. As a team, we work out very well, because we both excel in different areas that the other person may not be good at. Its nice to have started from scratch together. That way, in time, we can go back and look at all the business & financial struggles we’ve come across together as a young couple.

Effects Cell Phones Have on Society         As the role of technology in our lives steadily increases, one has to wonder the effect that it will have on today's students. Although, we could not imagine life without cell phones, it is important to realize that owning one can have negative effects on our lives. Cell phone use with students can cause detrimental affects on Etiquette, can lead to addiction, tends to portray a superficial communication and social gap and can cause serious accidents while driving. The use of cell phones can be very disruptive to others around us and can be perceived as improper behavior in many situations.   "You're at a four-way intersection, trying to make a left, when your best friend calls you. Obviously, it must be important since she’s texting you. Looking down at your phone's screen you laugh while reading the message and take your foot off the brake. Your car drifts into the opposing lane, just as oncoming traffic is speeding by. A distaster waiting to happen? You bet. That is just one example of the many accidents that can occur while texting or talking on a cell phone. Studies have shown that driving while talking on a cell phone is as bad as drinking and driving. Why? When you’re talking on cell phones and even texting while driving, this requires the driver to take their attention off of the road, even if it is only for a matter of seconds.      & do you have any other ideas      btw I'm not NEARLY done I have A LOT more

20090227091901AAvLpqD	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	Are college students whiny or are professors unfair?	This article (  http://www.springerlink.com/content/v747...  and also found in the LA Times at  http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/18/educat...  ) by a group of researchers mainly at UC Irvine, have decided that college students expect good grades basically just for showing up to class and doing the reading (the authors suggest that this is worthy of the default grade of "C").  Students argue that if they "give their best effort" they deserve to get a high grade, while professors say that kids who give a good "effort" but still do lousy deserve to fail.      1) What do you think?  Are today's college students whinier, expecting more from their professors while giving less?        This led me to think about a post I saw once on RateMyProfessors.com in which a student wrote that professors need to understand that they are in some ways employees of the student.  I've heard University administrators talk about students like customers (e.g., keep them happy so they'll be return customers), in which case professors are indeed in the job of customer service.      2) Are students consumers?  What are they consumers of?  Who is the boss of who at a University?      Finally, pretending for the sake of argument that it IS true that students expect to get good grades for almost no work nowadays, why would that be?  One hypothesis that's been offered is that it's because this generation is the one that's grown up getting trophies just for "showing up" instead of going home empty-handed.  At a karate studio I once visited, the instructors were told never to tell a student they had done something wrong; instead to praise their effort and gently correct them.  This studio was wildly successful, financially, and many karate studios since have moved away from the older, harsher ways of teaching karate students discipline and towards the kinder way of giving them more rewards, even letting students pass belt tests that don't deserve to (to keep the student happy and retain their tuition money).      3) Do you think this might have any truth to it?  As nice as it sounds, does rewarding people incessantly and making everyone a "winner" lead to students feeling that even the smallest effort deserves a reward?      I'm dying to hear your thoughts.

Out of many, one of my interesting yet saddest was the day my bird flew away. My pet bird's name was Sunny. She was my most beloved bird. Until one day, when I was at school, me and my friends saw a dead crow. My friend told me "Did you know that there's a myth that when you see a dead crow, bad luck will come to you?" I just laughed and did not believe her.      When I came home from school that day, my whole family was acting strange around me. It was then I found out that my bird Sunny was missing from her cage. I was so sad that I cried in my room for the rest of that day. From this experience, I now believe my friend's myth.

20090307173008AAhb4Ex	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	Need advice on what graduate degree to obtain?	I can not decide on what degree to go after. When I am looking for a degree to obtain I am looking for what jobs that degree will open up for me. Here are some facts; I will be obtaining my BSBA (bachelors of Science in Business Administration) with a minor in human recourses from DeVry University in two weeks. I want to immediately go and attain a graduate degree because I know that I will not be motivated to go back to school later on in my life and a DeVry degree is worthless. The school that I want to attend is CSU (California State University) Sacramento because I don’t want to spend 5 times more money on a private school. Here is a link of all the graduate degrees that they offer.        http://aaweb.csus.edu/catalog/current/Fi...       My strengths are that I am a:   ? Outstanding leader   ? Strong problem solver   ? Effective public speaker   ? Good mathematical skills   ? Excellent understanding of concepts   ? Superb reasoning skills      My weaknesses are that I:   ? Have problems writing constantly   ? Do not have the most extensive vocabulary   ? Hate remembering useless information that will not benefit me   ? Do not like to be doing the same thing over and over again   ? Like to use my brain      What I think are good carrier characteristics are:   ? A salary of around 75k to 100k    ? To rarely work more than 40 hours a week   ? A job that should be around for 40 years   ? The job to be is somewhat of demand   ? That maybe requires a license      What I think are bad carrier characteristics are:   ? A job that will not get affected much by outsourcing or of shoring   ? The ability to get the job without a degree in that field   ? The lack of critical thinking involved that the employee is more like a tool than a person   ? An inconsistent salary (like contractors)      I know that I am not going to find a perfect job that fits me to the T but I would like to at least like to get one that comes close. I have thought about getting a MBA (Masters of Business Administration) but I am not sure I want to do it because I am kind of scared of the business world, the MBA is not necessary to become a manager, and it is kind of getting devalued. Please correct me if I am wrong. So what degree do you think I should apply for?
