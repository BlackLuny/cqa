I also have some in my side part and as a result am switching the side I part on to cover them. My hair isn't very long so cutting it wouldn't help matters too much. This is about what my hair looks like but a tad longer    http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b340/w...     http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b340/w...

Here is a photo of me with them.    http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b340/w...    I really want my hair long and healthy and don't want to go any shorter with my length but want to camouflage the damaged parts. I don't know why I have so much damage, I hardly use heat and my hair hasn't been long enough to wear ponytails for some time, I do however, wear headbands a lot so maybe I had better stop that.   Anyway, any style/cut tips would be appreciated. Also, please no fat comments, I am working on that.   Thanks.

20090307102935AAr0jgM	Beauty & Style;Other - Beauty & Style	How can I get soft and beautiful hair, like Japanese hair?	I think my hair is fuzzy. I have long, straight, brown hair. I use shampoo. And an hair conditioner to have it soft and easy to brush my hair. But when I dry my hair after a shower it gets from those little wisps, which is really annoying me...Some friends of mine has such beautiful hair and also soft hair. I use the same as what they use, cause I think that my hair would be like that then. But it doesn't work.. does it have to do with my long hair? I have been thinking of cutting my hair but on the other side, I love long hair and it would be wasteful to cut that long hair. And if I'm going to cut my hair I'll cut it in layers, but I've read on internet that it would arise if you cut it in layers =[ Cause I want my hair in model. People say my hair is very beautiful but I don't think the same as they do... I wish my hair is like those Japanese hair. I know it's kinda stupid to talk about this but I thought it'd be better if I asked it online xD It'd be nice if you gave me some advice! thank you very much in advance!

20090307133520AA9cmVR	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Tattoos	I'd like to get a tattoo- but I don't know where to put it!?	I'd like to be an elementary school teacher, but this won't be for another five years. My nose is pierced- a small stud- but I think I need to be EXTREMELY careful about where I put the tattoo because having my nose pierced will probably affect me getting a job.      The tattoo I want is small- about the size of half your index finger, about an inch and a half long and half an inch tall. One of my elementary school teachers had a tattoo about that size on the inside of her ankle, which is where I'd like mine, but would it need to be covered with a bandaid? And I was even thinking about getting it on the inside of my wrist, but I know that would definitely need to be covered up.      I'd rather not put it on my stomach, hip, or thighs. Where is a good, safe place to put it so that it won't further affect me getting the job I want?

20090307135448AArqXib	Beauty & Style;Makeup	Can anyone give me some make-up advice?	I'm 24 and never wear make up - only eyeliner and shadow occasionally. My skin is generally good but I'm going to an awards ceremony next week and I would like to even my skin tone out a bit as I have rosy cheeks.   I'm looking for a foundation (or something similar?) that is sheer and not heavy that will make my skin tone look a bit softer. I don't want to look like I am caked in make up.       Also I want to wear eye make up but would like to put something onmy eyelids first to make them matt so that the eye makeup stays on longer and you can see it better - what should I use for that?      Does anyone know anything good to use or any good brands to look up? I have absolutely no idea about make up so any advice would be great. Thanks!

20090307150534AADRo3i	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Other - Skin & Body	Would getting a second eyebrow piercing make the first more likely to reject?	I have my eyebrow pierced and I want to get another one right beside it. I know rejection is when your body decides it would be easier to push it out than deal with it, and I was wondering, if I got the second one, would it make it more likely for the first to reject?      I guess the only way to phrase it is to ask, would my body sort of realize it has an eyebrow ring by sticking another one in? That sounds sort of weird, but it's the only way I can think of putting it. If you don't get what I mean I'll try and clarify...      I don't want your opinions on whether or not I should get it because you think it's gross. I don't care if you think it's nasty or trashy. Keep it to yourself.       Spam will be reported.

20090307134927AA5uTUB	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	How do you get a good fashion without going shopping?	I'm really desperate. I never read any fashion magazines or anything like that. I think I have good taste in fashion, it's just that my mom says that we need to save up since the ecomony's going down. Well, all my other claassmates by new clothes all the time, and they shop like as if nothing's wrong. I only have three pairs of jeans, one pair of sneakers (which is my only pair of shoes for the winter, autumn, and and spring) three hoodies, a couple of shirts. I sometimes, layer my shirts like how "tomboys" wear them, like shirtsleeves over long sleeves. All the other girls wear uggs, ed hardy, abrocrombe, and stuff like that. I feel out of placed and I basicly wear the same clothings every week that it's kinda embarassing. I have some friends who don't care what I wear, so I'm kinda okay. Just that, the popular girls keep giggling behind my backs on how I only have one pair of shoes that I wear everyday, and how I'm "poor" which I'm not. What should I do? I can't ask my mom to go out shopping, because I know where she's coming from. I can't get a job because I'm not old enough. I have piano lessons and violin lessons, and sometimes my mom is too lazy to go the to bank so she takes my money that I got from my grandma. So, I'm basicly pennyless. How can I get money and go shopping for a new wardrobe?

20090307151957AAsoZiA	Beauty & Style;Hair	Really thinking about dying my hair blonde?	I'm 13 and I have brown hair with blonde highlights. I have been putting blonde highlights in my hair for a really long time now and I'm getting a little bored of it. I like the way the blonde looks, so should I dye my hair totally blonde? One of my friends has naturally dirty blonde hair and she died it dark brown and a lot of the guys in my class started calling her sh** head. Which I personally think is completely idiotic because almost everyone in my class has brown hair and the most of the people calling her that have brown hair. If I dye my hair blonde do you think they are going to call me something ridiculous like piss head or something because the girl who got her hair dyed brown is my friend? I really want to change my hair and I hate having to worry about what these losers are going to say. Also, has anyone ever had a bad experience dying their hair blonde? Did it not come out well or something? is there something I should know? I know everyone talks about the noticable roots, but my mom gets highlights a lot and she does them herself so I can just touch it up with that :) What do you think? Any answers would be awesome.

20090307151822AAcb2gc	Beauty & Style;Other - Beauty & Style	Girls...........if you liked a guy....would you try to "avoid" him and why?????????????????	BTW I'm in 10th grade and there's another girl in the same grade as me....so yeah.       She's kind of outgoing when she's with her friends, but really shy when she's by herself.      Yesterday in school I was in the hallway and she was coming towards me by herself, there was no one else in the hall and it was almost for sure we would cross paths...but she looked hesitant at first and then took a right into another hallway...         So thats what I'm asking, if you liked a guy...would you "avoid" him if you were shy?      Plus, how can I get her if she's so shy. I'm not sure if she likes me though, so I don't want to be too cocky I guess, but it's hard to talk to her cause I'm not friends with any of her friends, and I usually never see her.      But I have talked to her before.

I'm trying to grow my hair, but to be honest it hasn't AT ALL. I think its because it keeps breaking.
