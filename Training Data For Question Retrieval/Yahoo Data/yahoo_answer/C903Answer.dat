49740c9daeea677fc86801fb2b3f41deaa	Fraud is a 3 years in NV.<br>  <br>  The other 2 are harder for me understand, they should have been handled immediately.   However if you can call them product liability you have 4 years.   Usually those are handled trough the RE board, I have never known an individual to get involved.|`|AA11173563	RESPA violations are a max of three years only every where. You need to explain the fraud. If you did a stated income or a no documentation loan or something like that which was allowed at that time there is no fraud.|`|laVGEEeraa	I was trying to answer another question of yours, but you deleted it. So I won't spend any time on this one...
qQaTpnxTaa	Nobody here can answer that for you! Only you can make that decision.You should go to a university adviser and get advice from them and also take aptitude test to see where you might have other interest. Good Luck!
kifwyOgKaa	rtfm is correct.  And to answer your second question, the only way to prevent someone from stealing your PIN is to not tell anyone your PIN, and any piece of paper you may receive with your PIN should be properly disposed of; ie shredded.<br>  <br>  ***Bank personnel do not know their customer's PINs because we don't want to know anyone's PINs.  This keeps us from being held liable if a customer's PIN is breached.<br>  <br>  ****PINs are computer generated.  No bank personnel ever sees the PINs.|`|zuGKIWfNaa	The bank doesn't know your PIN. You're the only one who does. They can't give it to you -- they can only make up a new one for you.|`|XZG35fxSaa	The best way to keep your PIN from getting stolen is to use a number that you're sure to remember, and don't write it down anywhere.|`|FLAtdWrmaa	1)  Think about this, please!  What would happen if you lost your card, or someone stole it, and they rocked up to your bank and insisted the bank officers give them your PIN, claiming to be you -- and the bank, without fuss, gave the thief your PIN!  Don't you work as hard as the rest of us for what money you have in your account(s)?  Think!<br>  <br>  Very few people at your bank have high enough security clearance to access their account-holders' PIN numbers, and the employees who do are usually not "out in front" (at desks or teller stations).  They *can't* just find your old PIN and read it out to you.  There are very good reasons for this!!!  So work at remembering your PIN for whenever you need it.<br>  <br>  2)  Never write your PIN down for yourself.  Don't pick anything obvious as your PIN  (ie, don't use your own last name as your PIN, or your street name or house address, etc.).  And ask an officer at your bank to advise you about this, they worry a great deal about PIN and card theft, and they may have suggestions that are specific to your/their own bank that don't apply to other banks.
OacSIfSiaa	Well there is no reason why not except for the following:<br>  Is it a properly written business plan to include all the information needed such as market research, cash flow, license requirements, permitting requirements?  Does it provide a flow chart of the break even point? what about copyrights?<br>  <br>  Business plans take time and must be complete and accurate.  And there is no guarantee that someone might want to see it first then decide not to buy it but take your idea and go their own way with it.<br>  <br>  If you want to protect your idea especially if it involves a product or device, send a copy to yourself certified mail/return receipt.  DO NOT OPEN when you get it.  This way, if at some time you see another person has used your idea, you can show proof that it was your original idea when you produce a dated document in court for the judge to open and read,  this proves you had the idea long before.<br>  <br>  As a member of an inventors network and one who has written many business plans, I have seen people get ripped off by not being cautious.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps answer your question|`|7o3DMzXQaa	yes|`|4JapQjRnaa	You can sell your plan to someone who is looking for your plan, exactly. It would be like selling a pre written term paper with a topic that hasn't been asked for yet, see what I am mean?<br>  <br>  You might want to try and advertise it free online to see your response. Your plan though needs to cover five (5) years of growth in succession. You probably know there is more to a business plan then just a good idea, it has to be spelled out with graphs, charts and potential in the real world.  <br>  <br>  Prove it's worth, test your idea, I know you don't want to do the business, but to show it has value, prove it.
qjZMTUcsaa	okay there actually may be numerous answers to your question but I would seriously steer clear of single stocks or anything silly like that. It sounds like you already have your emergency fund set up and in place. What I would do is if you are already investing in your 401k or similar retirement plan at work up to the matching point I would consider investing in a Roth IRA. it is after tax investing but it will grow tax free. I would look for a good mid-cap growth mutual fund Roth IRA. There is a limit to how much you can contribute. Once you have reached that limit if you have any outstanding debt I would pay that off. If not I would consider buying into several different types of Mutual Funds with a good long term track record. The rate of return long term on Mutual Funds for any given ten year period has been about 12%|`|AA11357056	If you're willing to invest now and wait maybe 10 or 15 years, some stocks could be a good investment. Personally, I wouldn't touch GM... my feeling is that they're going to be forced into some type of bankruptcy, and the stock is going to be worthless.<br>  <br>  I'd take a serious look at companies that make things that people need, but maybe are postponing buying in the short run. Auto companies are a logical choice, but for the reason I mentioned above, I'd pass on those.<br>  <br>  Home improvement materials, maybe... plumbing, building materials, stuff like that. It could very well be that when things do get better, they still won't be good enough for a lot of people to buy a new home or bigger home, and they might go back to fixing up the one they have.|`|4Jy8Hioiaa	I would not invest in single stocks. There are too many companies on the brink. Even if the government takes the companies into "government protection" they can wipe out the stock. I would invest long term. Take the 15k and split it up into quarters.<br>   <br>  1/4 in growth stock mutual funds<br>  1/4 in growth and income funds<br>  1/4 in international funds<br>  1/4 in aggressive funds.<br>  <br>  The market is risky and on sale right now. You would be getting in at the lower end of a trough and can ride the wave up. Individual stocks are too risky right now. Only use mutual funds that have a 5 to 10 year track record of doing well. I would suggest a good financial planner. Talk to family and friens to see if they can refer you so someone. <br>  Good Luck.
Ch9TedMcaa	Stocks are at their lowest prices right now. I would have kept my allocation the same, especially if you have a while before retirement.<br>  <br>  Now if you're closer to retirement, this was as good move.

Construction materials vary greatly from supplier to supplier.  There isn't any way to answer this without telephoning several contractors in your area, and telephoning several building suppliers in your area.|`|yIDvd8nFaa	Yah, its tough to answer this question without knowing more details.  Are you building it under an existing house?  That would be a lot harder to do and much more costly, i would guess.  They would probably have to pick your house up and move it out of the way in order to dig the hole and pour the concrete.
QoVL5cDHaa	Depends on when you were away, and if you worked whilst abroad. The UK tax year goes from 6th April to 5th April. If you worked from 6th April until you went, you may be able to claim at least some of your tax back. But if you worked when abroad, you will have to fill in a Tax Return and declare foreign income. You get credit for any tax you paid abroad.<br>  The same applies when you come back. You will get your full tax allowance, even if earnings for only part of tax year. Contact tax office to see if you can be put on cumulative code number. Again, if you have foreign earnings, you will need to complete Tax Return (will be issued on 6th April) and declare foreign earnings on a foreign income page.|`|49d798aae69c40cbf0926ebc21291224aa	How were you paying tax if you weren't in the country?

f80e40c6be11ef18f0153889d9336d4daa	You are not going to get any bank to reduce the actual principal of a loan(or credit card).  Banks will sometimes have programs where they will defer payments or reduce your interest rate.  However, they usually won't do anything if you are current.  The best thing to do is call your bank up and ask them if there is anything they can do for your situation.|`|tdQTZPI7aa	No bank is reducing the principle.  That is the amount you borrowed that is the amount you repay.  The most you can get is lower interest for a longer term.|`|kifwyOgKaa	Are you talking about a credit card or a loan?<br>  <br>  ***ADD***You can't reduce the principal on a mortgage.  You borrowed the money to pay for your house, the bank isn't going to reduce what you owe them.|`|bfe4ad38e28ddda61b321173866c1f9aaa	You can't most banks are hurting worse then the people since they gave out too much credit and they are having to raise interest rates to recoup their losses.
MmTe8W8uaa	Following most recent bank closings (IndyMac, Washington Mutual, etc.), the branches reopened under another name the next business day (which was three calendar days later, because the banks closed on a Friday and reopened on a Monday) and the money was immediately available.<br>  <br>  If a bank is not being reopened, they send checks in the mail, fairly quickly compared to some parts of the government (such as the IRS).|`|UDxL7lPqaa	The FDIC normally has the accounts at failed banks taken over by other banks so there is no delay in access.  Witness the WAMU/JPMorgan Chase example.|`|QUjJELtVaa	src50 is right, occasionally there are some initial restrictions like you can't get money from an ATM or that bank branches are closed for several days.

3mAgM405aa	Here's a short list of jobs in the U.S., Canada and Europe which you can create to generate income:<br>  <br>  1. Learn calligraphy so that you can provide handwritten invitations and thank you notes to prospective wedding parties, birthday celebrations, etc. Seek out clients through wedding planners at nearby churches and temples. A starter calligraphy kit usually runs around $20 and anyone can easily pick up this skill. The going rate is usually $1 per hand addressed item.<br>  <br>  2. Seek from your neighbors a gardner position which involves planting, weed removal, plant/tree trimming, light brush clearance. You will be using the neighbor's equipment and tools. Again, do not represent yourself as a lawn mower since there are any number of safety issues involved. A door-to-door solicitation of surrounding neighbors is required and you can charge between $6 to $9 per hour.<br>  <br>  3. Offer policing/removal or clearance of trash services to surrounding neighbors which involve trash pickup within nearby residential area. Limit the extent of pickup to small areas and be aware that there are no hazardous terrain or elements involved in this process. Again, a door-to-door solicitation of neighbors is in order. You can charge between $6.75 to $7.50 per hour.<br>  <br>  4. Acquire a set of window cleaning tools [a bucket, liquid window cleaner, sponge, squeegee, handle with an extension and a small step ladder] and solicit local businesses for your window cleaning services. However, be careful to limit the height of the window cleaning to no higher than one story. Charge $1 per window panel.<br>  <br>  5. Visit your nearest beauty salon and ask to be trained as a shampoo person who is also willing to sweep up fallen hair on the ground and do set ups [arranging dye kits, curler holders, etc.] for a set hourly fee.<br>  <br>  6. Become a sign flipper by contacting your nearest realtor. A flipper is someone who stands at a major intersection and flips a "For Lease/Rental" sign in order to attract visitors to an open house or to a particular real estate listing. The hourly pay is at least the minimum wage.<br>  <br>  7. Why not become a paid feeder servicing the disabled at nearby nursing, convalescent, assisted living/care centers and hospitals. It involves feeding food to patients who are unable to feed themselves. The starting rate is $8.00 per hour. The only downside is that one has to take precautions to wash one's hands after each feeding. A posting of your services [by a business card or flyer] on a reviewable bulletin board would be enough to generate customers. The paid feeder position is one of the fastest growing occupation at this time.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|WdW1ga14aa	Why don't you check with your school and see if they can help you out.  I know that when I was in school, they had a work program where I got paid and I also got credits.

There is no such thing as left over money|`|AA11173563	the only way any additional funds are given is on a FHA 203K loan for improvements by contractors and that money is disbursed to the contractors not the home owners|`|UDxL7lPqaa	"Someone" is wrong.

tCiVuFK9aa	Banks aren't really interested in foreclosing, they have too many unpaid mortgages on their books already.  I don't know who you talked to but do you have a Countrywide branch near you.  If you do, go in and talk to the manager and see what's available. If not, call back and ask to speak directly to a loan management manager. If that doesn't help, I would suggest that you pay as much as you can every month and when you can try to catch up. If you are paying something, they are less likely to foreclose. Also, did you file for unemployment?  They are giving extensions on that and in most states a $50 a week raise.  If you didn't, go do that right now and if you did and it has run out, go apply for the extension.<br>  Red|`|tmh42R6Caa	Are you both on the mortgage?  They should care that you lost your job (unless you're not on the loan).  If so, they generally have some kind of program where they can modify the loan for a short time until you get back on your feet.  I would call again and hope to get someone more knowledgeable.  Even if they do foreclose, it takes many many months.  My sister didn't pay her mortgage for 13 months and eventually moved out.  They never started the foreclosure process.|`|NtFWoBHsaa	They are possibly the WORST lying and scheming mtg company out there.  BTW, they merged with Bank of America.

SNVauR3laa	Basically, people have been spending more money than they have for too long. Now they have to pay back, and they don't have the money to do it. Because of this, banks are losing money. Banks, in trying to get their money back, are taking people's houses, but since most people are in the same situation, no one is buying the houses from the banks. Since people are trying to pay back the money they owe, they are not buying as much. This caused many business to start losing money. Because they are losing money, they are firing people. Since people are getting fired, they have no money to spend. It is an endless cycle. <br>  <br>  What it means to you is up to your parents. This cycle happens every so often, so then next one may affect you when you are grown up. The lesson to be learned is not to borrow more than you can pay back, and always save for a rainy day.|`|ZUpPXwUZaa	Well the Unites states is 1.2 trillion dollars in debt from bad bank and state management. And also from the Iraq war because the U.S. has borrowed so much money from china to pay for it. <br>  <br>  the global recession is because the banks are international and so is oil, every country tied to the U.S. has a failing economy, that includes Europe, Russia etc. all forms of democracy because the U.S. system is failing. it's called the "domino effect" one falls and the rest fall after it.<br>  <br>  there isn't really a simplified explanation for all of this. <br>  <br>  there is a new stimulus bill for 789 billion dollars that's suposed to stimulate the economy. however, it's new money that's being pumped out and new money isn't worth much unless it circulates.<br>  <br>  90 billion of that stimulus plan is going towards education. pell grants will be increased to maximum of 500 dollars and i think tuition will increase about 2,500 dollars. <br>  <br>  but other than that you shouldn't really have to worry about it because there isn't anything you can do except sit back and wait for the people that are supposed to be in charge of this country and on top of their game to sort this whole thing out.<br>  <br>  I just think inflation will rise our national debt will increase. China is going to get sick of the U.S. importing their products.<br>  <br>  I also think it can be helped by simply letting bad banks and businesses fail, so that they can learn their lesson. The U.S> should look for some other alternative to finding oil, like in south and central america, help those people out and the U.S. helps itself.

XdZtVjZRaa	Now is a GREAT time to get in to Real Estate!  Regardless of what your local market is doing, there are so many wonderful educational opportunities for you and when you are slow is a great time to take advantage of them!  <br>  <br>  I make sure that I have a meeting at least 1x per week with business people in related fields and take questions with me to my meetings with them.  For example, I call the local Wells Fargo office, ask for a loan officer who is doing the FHA financing, and have breakfast with him.  Every question I can find to ask regarding FHA I will ask - people usually like to talk about themselves and their expertise, and listening will give you fantastic education (for the price of coffee).  Ask at the end for some business cards, hand them at least 5 of your own and ask for a referral to new buyers, and then also ask them to email the information they have regarding that topic to you.  You will establish a great network, and now, as you get into the business, is the time to really go out and do so.<br>  <br>  You may also consider very strongly joining several clubs or groups.  I personally volunteer in a couple of groups, teach periodic classes for the Red Cross (I just think it is fun), and belong to a BNI chapter (great source for business).  I also blog on several real estate specific sites, and try to get to know Realtors from other states and communities.<br>  <br>  Please feel free to email me your contact information - I would love to know you so I can be confident in sending you referrals.<br>  <br>  PS - in actual answer to your original question - your business is going to be as phenomenal as you want it to be.

But, that's because of all the foreclosures and short sales on the market. And, people keep hearing that prices are still dropping. So, they're waiting in the wings to pounce when prices stabilize and start to go up again. And, that's when you'll have plenty of business.<br>  <br>  Right now, you have two options for getting into real estate niches: specialize in foreclosures and short sales, or specialize in property management.<br>  <br>  Most real estate agents are clueless when it comes to short sales and how to deal with banks on foreclosures. I know this, because I was looking at distressed properties for about 6 months last year and just about every selling agent didn't know you-know-what from Shinola. So, if you can study up on how to handle distressed properties, both as a selling and buying agent, you wil have plenty of work.<br>  <br>  As far as property management, consider that many individuals are buying up distressed properties on the cheap for income property. And, they may need someone to manage their rental(s) for them. Well, you can't be a property manager without a real estate license. So, you could open up a real estate office that specializes in distressed properties that your buyers pick up as a rental, and then they retain you as the manager of their rental property.<br>  <br>  You should also look into what it takes to become a mortgage broker as well. A friend of mine works at a business that does mortgages and real estate. And, it's a great way to pick up an extra couple thousand dollars in commission by doing a buyer's mortgage, too. Especially with all the refinancing that's going to be happening soon.

First, do your keyword research and find keywords that have lower demand and low competition. Then use the same keywords on all three and link from each site. Then use article marketing or forum posting to get more links to hubpages and squidoo.  I'd also use Digg and Delicious to promote. Twitter can be used to update on any new posts and to follow people with similar interests by searching for those who have those similar keywords on their Twitter profile. <br>  <br>  This page talks more about using social bookmarking <a href="http://www.simple-internet-strategies.com/buzz-marketing.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.simple-internet-strategies.co...</a> .<br>  <br>  Healthy Mom|`|SR7fw8Diaa	Contact us and we will explain you with details.|`|XsEejja7aa	yeah, i dont know what that means...<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  LOL!!!!!!!

BlVudiyfaa	Your benefits availability depends on the State's schedule. Call the toll free number on the back of your card, it has info as to when benefits are available. These are called recurring benefits.<br>  <br>  If these are newly applied for, the State will transmit to JP Morgan and they'll be available the next day. This only happens once a day, so don't call the toll free number every hour to check (people do this).<br>  <br>  You can also go to the website on the back of your card and set up access to your account. While this won't tell you when the State will transmit to JPM, it will provide other helpful info to manage your account and benefits
Y7l9w11Maa	I'm not sure about the experience of the above answerer, but that's not entirely accurate.  If a person sells a property in which tenants reside, the buyer of the property MUST uphold the lease until the lease is up.  At that point, they can give you 30 days notice or choose to renew your lease under their terms.  <br>  <br>  The new landlords can NOT break the lease and ask you to move, they can NOT raise your rent before the 11 months is up and they can NOT do anything differently than your current lease dictates.  When buying a house that has tenants, you are buying the lease as well and can NOT change it.  This covers all the USA.<br>  <br>  They may however... if they want you out, try to use anything in the lease to evict you if you break it even one time.  For example, late on rent = eviction.  Did some damage to the property? = eviction.  If they want to move in the house, I would suggest to you that you pay your rent on time every month until the lease is out and be model tenants.  Just for your own protection.  Best of luck to you!|`|LT8OHBQMaa	YES!! this happened to me (in California)   when a new owner takes over a property it pretty much nullifies anything the previous owner has done.  In my case we were evicted immediately because the new owner said they wanted to renovate.  It could not be so in your case, it all depends on the new owner. <br>  I would suggest getting with the current owner and asking them to address this issue in any sales negotiations that way you can at least be aware of what situation you may end up in.<br>  Even if you stay, you will definitely have to renegotiate unless that is some form of stipulation the current owner has added into the negotiations and it has been agreed to by the new owner. However,  you will still have to sign a new contract even if it remains the same. A new and current contract is for your protection so they can not change their mind later because there is no valid contact with the new owners name on it.<br>  you can also contact your local housing authority for advice and maybe even help.<br>  Good luck and i hope this helps! :)

XdZtVjZRaa	I love first time homebuyers that ask first!<br>  <br>  You will need to interview a couple of lenders and find one that fits your personality and needs.  Make sure the lender you choose will continue to service your loan in the office after closing - some will give you an 800 number to call after closing, which can make getting good anwers to future questions difficult.<br>  <br>  *Pull together 2 years worth of tax information. If your 2008 taxes are not done, get them done and take both 2007 and 2008 taxes in with you.<br>  *you will probably need 3 months worth of bank/investment statements.  You will need to prove you have the money available for your down payment; you are only allowed a certain percentage of the purchase price as a "gift" - that is coming from a source other than yourself.<br>  *You will need your paycheck stubs for at least 3 paychecks - be on the safe side and take 2 months worth of paycheck stubs.<br>  *If your parents are willing to cosign on the loan, you will need their information as well and if they cannot go to the lender with you, a letter from them directly to the lender stating their intentions to start the process.<br>  <br>  <br>  debit card payments do NOT affect your credit score.  When you check with a lender (Do NOT under any circumstances apply online for a loan), have them pull your credit history and they may recommend that you open a store credit card, use it every month for a few months, and that will help build and fix any credit issues they find on your score.<br>  <br>  Most younger first time homebuyers just don't have a credit history.  Your landlord can give you a letter for the bank to show you make your rent payments on time, and you can also use your cell phone bill to show you make payments on time, and even a utility bill in your name can prove your own credit worthiness. <br>  <br>  I have an entire packet for first time homebuyers I can email you in PDF format if you would like.  Just contact me to set that up.  This is NOT a solicitation for business as I do not live in Michigan!|`|425ca8dc150991adaf3ef229478796cdaa	Samian, don't move to Michigan.

There are better places to buy a cheap house, most of them are in the middle of nowhere, but you'll still have a better chance of getting a job (and you'll also have a better quality of life too!) than in Detroit!<br>  <br>   Or you can get an apartment someplace nice and save up for a few years before buying a house<br>  <br>   Don't get me wrong, I like cities, but Detroit is just bad news all over|`|tmh42R6Caa	A loan officer could tell you exactly what they need, but here are the basics:<br>  *Generally, they'll want 20% down.  However, you could probably go as low as 5%.<br>  *You'll need a strong credit score.  Probably over 650, maybe even 700<br>  *You'll need to have 2-3 months of mortgage in your account (reserves)<br>  *You'll need to show proof of income<br>  <br>  If you're still in school, you'll need to show an offer letter with a salary included.  If you don't have a job yet, you'll need to get one first.  Good luck!
brWg4ZNDaa	It would vary depending on what year the apprentice is as well as his knowledge.<br>  <br>  I would imagine you could charge anywhere from $15-50 an hour without too much problem assuming you have sufficient knowledge.<br>  <br>  Many homeowners don't want a first year apprentice fixing their plumbing without supervision.  So you'd likely find it hard to get work or get paid on the low end of the spectrum.<br>  <br>  If you're fully licensed with lots of experience, I don't see why you couldn't make close to $50 an hour.|`|jQbAaH19aa	Nothing if you ain't qualified yet!!!

b22faa3abff5e7a246b2702086fea238aa	The only way to get an accurate handle on your return of investment is through asking EVERY propsect or new customer "where" or "how" they heard about you. Usually this will give you a pretty good idea about how well any advertising is doing for your business. This is the best way to measure your return- compare the dollars paid out to the dollars made from the advertising. I would beware of the sales people that may visit you from the television stations. They will dazzle you with how much exposure your business will have and how studies show usuing there company is a good idea. BEWARE- they NEVER gaurantee business! You have to test market and do your homework by asking other business owners you know in your community. Watch the TV station and call anyone of the businesses you see and talk to them about how well the advertising is working. Television is the most expensive way to advertise. It really can ad up fast. There are 2 types of advertising- creative advertising (like TV or radio that "create" a need or want) and then there is "Directional" advertising (where people go to get directed to find a business). If you are a new business, I would recogmend as much inexpensive advertising as your budget would allow through target marketing with local print adverting, direct mailing, small ads in newspapers, Etc.  This will help you to "brand" your business and create an interest. HOWEVER, make sure you are represented in your local Yellow Pages as well. Think about it- if you see a commercial on TV, you may remember the name of the company...sorta....and a few weeks later you need to buy that product...the first thing you will do is goto the yellow pages or an online directory and start loking for that business you kinda remember. This is where you can really leverage other peoples creative advertising. Your competition may make the mistake of not advertising in the Yellow Pages and you could "steal" these customers if they see your ad first and you carry the same product. Its kinda like the path o least resistance, they call you first. The best ad to get would be a display or picture ad because 70% of the consumers look at these ads first. If your budget does't allow- ask about an in column box ad.<br>  <br>  I hope this info helps and best wishes!

yD0n1O5kaa	I have two answers.<br>  Take what you need and leave what you don't.<br>  If you are looking for something online that will bring you multiple streams of income then here are my suggestions.<br>  www.clickbank.com<br>  Create your own product: ebook; ecourse; a novel; something of value.<br>  And sell it on clickbank and have others sell it for you for 51% of the profits, and you get the other 49%.<br>  Sign up with multiple accounts on clickbank to sell your own product - this will boost up your clickbank and others will want to sell for you.<br>  Second solution:<br>  Create your ebook and sell it on Amazon Kindle (If you are a US resident, but if you aren't sell it on mobipocket.com).<br>  When you create a few ebooks these become your multiple streams of income.<br>  I trust this may have helped.  I trust all is well.

cs4n4Fgzaa	I've known a few virtual assistants, and it takes more than great secretarial skills. You're running a business, so you have to have the full scope of knowledge for being an entrepreneur - manage your books and taxes, write contracts with your clients, market and advertise your services, negotiate with your clients, and so on. You'll need excellent time management skills, and a good mind for figuring out how long it will take you to complete a task or assignment so that you can meet your commitments. A lot of first time virtual assistants either undercharge and can't make ends meet, or grossly overcharge and wonder why they can't get any business.  The International Association of Administrative Professionals has support networks and resources specifically for virtual assistants, where you can get more information.

Once you have determined the industry salary, arrive at a figure based on your qualification and experience. This figure may or may not be above industry standard. Use this figure as the starting point of your negotiation. Always ask for a higher salary than what you are willing to accept. You must however be clear about the bottomline figure that you are willing to accept taking into consideration stuff such as allowances, paid vacation, health insurance etc. <br>  Remember, when negotiating for a salary do not be forced to make an on the spot decision. Take some time to critically analyse what the company has to offer and use this information to arrive at a decision.

T0vXLjPRaa	Your question assumes that ethnic diversity trumps everything in a group dynamic.  This is not the case.  An organization can, and must foster a culture of it's own that is re-enforced by all the members of that organization in order for it to thrive. So while cultural differences may have an impact on how the individuals preceive certain things that occur, the organization as a whole has the responsibility to itself to ensure certain standards are met always.  Bottom line diversity itself does not add to these challenges, because they exist no matter how "diverse" a group is.

This makes them more attractive to many companies because they hire them part time and pay them more, since they don't have to pay them the very expensive medical and retirement benefits that they have to pay younger workers. They are also more loyal workers with vast experience that do not need much training to do their jobs. If they get hired in their fields they simply make rings around others with little experience. Unless the jobs are extremely physical, the older workers have most of the advantages needed to hold a job, and employers, being greedy by nature, are well aware of this. Most older workers do not need to worry about their bills, because most of them already have incomes that they just want to supplement.

Or many can be tricked into credit counseling which has a horrible side affect of you are planning on buying or refinancing a home in the near future.  Most lenders will look at CCC  consumer credit counseling as a negative.  This means they will need to see 1 year of post program credit habits before lending you money.  They dont advertise this and should.  I have had clients become enraged by thinking they were doing the right thing in enrolling in a CCC program, end up being turned down for a loan.  They would have been approved and not required a year wait time had they came to me first and just removed the erroneously reported issues, and worked out a plan with their unsecured creditors.  There is also a thing lenders can try that is a rapid rescore that sometimes helps. It is better to clean up a report, and get approved for a lower rate loan. cleaning up a report just to get funded but be locked in at a bad credit interest rate just doesnt make sense.  Any good lender will advise you the same thing.

52526b559c45eb57204a29b41ddd8553aa	How ironic you would use the words pro's and con's when asking about a refinance.  It seems that most self proclaimed mortgage pro's these days are just clever pitchmen trying to con people.  Your question deserves a good answer as this is a serious situation where your financial future can be either blessed or cursed.  If you are bettering your current interest rate by 1.5 percent or better, a rate and term refinance makes good sense.  If you are needing cash and / or consolidating debt and lowering your rate by 1 percent or more, a refinance makes sense.  What you are doing by restarting a new loan term is going back to minimal principal for the first few years again.  If your current loan is only a few years old that won't make much impact anyway.<br>  If you are about to go from fixed to adjustable or currently on an adjustable rate then again you might want to refinance.  If your current loan is a decent fixed rate and you have some equity growth you might consider leaving it alone and opting for an equity secured line of credit.  You can use it like a checking account and use it when needed up to the amount approved.  Once paid down you can still use the available amount remaining over and over again without refinance fees.  The interest rate isnt as low but the fees are a fraction of the costs of a typical refinance loan.  The question most fail to ask themselves before refinancing is will this loan solve our needs and is the cost worth the end benefit.  When you take out any loan you are in affect just renting money from a funding source.  Make sure the source you use, and the type of loan you commit to, will fit well with your financial planning.|`|AA11927301	depends on the situation.<br>  <br>  I am a Branch Manager for Apex Mortgage.

52526b559c45eb57204a29b41ddd8553aa	You have good intent but might not be taking advantage of several advantages available currently.  Saving say $1,000.00 / month will get you $12,000 Closer to whatever down payment you want in 1 year.  But, 1 year from now at standard appreciation a 145,000 starter home will cost a couple thousand more for the same typical down payment, than what you have saved.  Interest rates will be higher also.  Why be farther behind and have a less favorable interest rate.  If you have sizable debt your best down payment would be to pay it off instead.  Then get a 80/20  or a 100% loan with no PMI.  You cant beat the rates and prices that exist today.  If you really feel the risk is worth it to have a down payment then force yourself to agree to bank a set amount every payday and find a way to live within those means.  Learning such will only make paying a mortgage easier down the road and show good saving and spending habits.|`|AA10617300	You have to look at how much down payment you want to have, How much the home you want to buy is, Your ability to budget extra money into savings etc.<br>  <br>  You can get 100% loans w/seller covering closing costs so you dont really need any money down.

52526b559c45eb57204a29b41ddd8553aa	People dress for success and equate success with flashy expensive vehicles.  It doesn't really prove ability or guarantee great service as it has been over manipulated by marketers.  It is true however that truly successful people have traits that will not allow them to look unprofessional.  What some sellers fail to think of is that they might pay more than the next agent might charge that drives a decent but less costly vehicle.  I never drive clients in my car and haven't for almost 20 years.  It is never an issue with them either, when I drive up for an appointment I drive my Jag XJS Convertible that looks very expensive yet cost less than a used Japanese sedan.  People tend to base many decisions on first impressions and image can be everything.  It can also backfire if the person doesn't exude the class and dignity their vehicles impression makes.  I sold my first listing nearly 30 years ago wearing cut offs, sandals, and a Bullwinkle t shirt.  The buyers felt refreshed to find a down to earth agent so really it comes to being yourself and just driving something decent yet a bit above the norm.  I prefer Jaguars as I love the way they drive and they are easy to repair.

52526b559c45eb57204a29b41ddd8553aa	Please contact your lender and work out a affordable solution.  Banks will do many creative things to prevent filing a foreclosure.  You must be pro-active with them however, you dont want to lose the home and they dont want to take it.  Once they file the lis pendins, notice of default, their options and yours change.  From there it gets worse until the trustees sale, filing bankruptcy to delay or stop the sale most often only benefits an attorney and gives you a extra few weeks before the sale occurs anyway.  I have worked with pre-foreclosures for over 20 years and can honestly tell you that the vast majority of attorneys that recommend filing bankruptcy to save the house should be disbarred for fraud.  Only in the rarest of circumstances does one benefit from a bankruptcy while in foreclosure.  You have a better chance of finding the winning lottery ticket at a landfill.|`|9ac4efe2c281bd465dbf8d33952bdfb8aa	Until the lender has the stay lifted which most savy lenders do quite quickly.|`|3e012a9d70d1bfbffcc40c91a1ebb265aa	Yes a chapter 7 or a chapter 13 can temporarily stop the foreclosure.  I do not know for how long though.  Eventually you'll have to get current with your mortgage.  Be sure you will be able to get current within several of months before doing the bankruptcy.  If it's inevitable that you'll loose the house I would not do a bankruptcy.  Instead sell the house.  If you owe more than you'll get from the house ask the mortgage company to allow you to sign an unsecured loan for the difference.

52526b559c45eb57204a29b41ddd8553aa	No, for one thing its too long of a process and requires more intellect then what it would take to remove misreported info from a credit report.  An interesting statistic from the Nationaql Mortgage Bankers Association is that 30% of credit reports contain inaccuracies.  I would submit a different view, it is more likely that all reports contain around 30% inaccurate information.  As to how would an agent embellish a report theres 2 ways that come to mind.  Cut and paste a better score and use a photocopy.  Or set up a bogus account and record timely payments.  The problem is that would require a long long time to have a sizable raising of ones score.  Miss a payment on anything and your score can plunge overnight.  Making timely payments on one or two new accounts can only raise a score slowly and by a small amount.|`|AA11119593	No they cannot.

52526b559c45eb57204a29b41ddd8553aa	They advertise option arm loans with a 1 month teaser rate and other loans similar.  The caveat is that once a typical loan is built the adders to rate such as cash out, loan to value, credit score, property type, occupancy type, and fixed term before adjustable are all going to change the real rate.  Think of it this way, if a lender could offer a loan below market rate that benefited the borrower only, how could they afford the millions spent weekly advertising it.  Why they can advertise the rate is because a situation does exist somewhere in their disclaimer that could get the loan they speak of.  Quicken loans and several others such as DiTech sometimes keep the loan to make up some of the interest themselves as well.  When you do close your loan with these type of lenders it is often an attorney that will come sign you and they arent there to represent you and can only sign you.  You should use a bank, direct lender, or mortgage broker and have an explanation provided for each document, and all your questions answered before signing.|`|AA10567299	They are only quoting Principal and Interest and they cannot know what the taxes and insurance will be.

It's called negative amortization.  Simply put, you are paying less than the interest that's being charged every month.  So, your mortgage balance goes UP, every month.<br>  <br>  Needless to say, a loan that goes up every month is riskier than a loan that is getting paid down every month.  Therefore, you will be paying a significantly higher interest rate on these loans, even though your payment is artificially low.<br>  <br>  In most cases, within 5 years, you will owe upwards of 110-115% of what you borrowed originally.<br>  <br>  So YES, you WILL pay more in interest.  These loans are not appropriate for 99.99% of the population, and Quicken is doing no one but themselves a favor by selling this product so heavily.

Over 10 years you repay 50,000 or 600 per month, at the end of 10 years you need to repay or refinance the remaining 75,000 (which you have been paying interest on too)

The review looks for verification of appraisers licensing, comps used are sometimes looked at if the appraisal has to adjust from several to establish your value.  It is the lenders way of making sure that the collateral is worth their risk. The photos taken show condition, the appraiser might sometimes call out issues that might affect the property.   I always prepare the buyer and seller or owner in a refinance for the appraisal.  I have never had an appraisal compromise a loan but i also know how it could if the property wasnt ready for one.  The good thing 99% of the time is that if the lender is in appraisal review the loan docs are just hours away and your almost done.  If you are in that 1% of those that have the appraisal stop your loan dont panic.  Most issues are easily cleared, if not the dead deal is really a good thing in the long run.

In the contract, spell out that you cosigned the loan ONLY so that she could get the loan, but that she intends to and is obligated to pay every payment, and pay them in full and on time.  It should also say that the car is hers, and that as long as she makes the payments, you have no claim to it.  Put in the specifics of the loan-- bank, loan number, payment schedule, terms, etc.  Then have it notarized, and both of you sign it.  Sadly, this will only help if she does fail and you end up going to court to try to get your money back from her, but if that does happen, having it all in writing is your best defense against her saying that you were supposed to make half the payments, or whatever.

If the broker doesnt immediately satisfy your concerns turn the office in to the state real estate board.  The agent is not acting in a duty required by law and you should not be locked into further business with her.  When you become the seller whatever doesnt get resolved now will be your duty and expense to repair later.  Foundation issues can be very costly.  I would rescind my offer and get a new agent if it was my deal.|`|45d22008940ea0abe6a50e0eba612610aa	Do you have any common sense whatsoever?!?! Do you not know that a leaking pipe is a defect?!?!

Next thing to do is get a realtor that actually makes money at his/her profession!! There are many part time realtors that don't hold their weight and are starving for a check!!

That Realtor is a complete donkey!!!|`|cad56fe7012d3f93d1b2133fe73da52daa	he's trying to protect his commission and keep the deal from falling apart.  don't let anything happen until you are completely satisfied, even if that means walking away from the deal.<br>  <br>  and if you bail because the seller won't fix the problems, you get your earnest money back.
52526b559c45eb57204a29b41ddd8553aa	Why would you not go with a reputable company that can create their fee from proceeds you likely will never see using a discount firm.  No agents with good marketing, negotiating, and networking skills are going to work for such a low paying brokerage.  You would be better off selling by owner than what you will get for 1%.  Also in the fine print that is their fee, you still have to pay the buyers agents fee so your actually at 4% plus their admin fee but you get the inexperienced agent on your side.  In the end your now close to 5%, what are you saving ?  for 6% you get a top level established company working for you.  For the alleged 1% you get a self serve marketing campaign instead of a professional agent.  You get more market time, and an unskilled negotiator.  You can lose 7% or more thinking your saving 5%.  Call Coldwell Banker, Prudential, Century 21, or gagging here, Re/Max.  Your home sale is to valuable to risk in the hands of a costs less, because they're worth less, agency.|`|4f6d0273d9e0c37cf35b7599d453cbfdaa	I've never neard of it.|`|fd112d71b7fe5ca8236e95a4810cd376aa	yes<br>  <br>  if your in doubt, phone your local licensing board...|`|prv0iuNDaa	I've heard of the company here in Beautiful B.C.

6829d7ed4c47b6173b04d02e3efa14a9aa	I'm an interior designer and small business owner.  You don't say where you are located.  Obviously, the town you live in determines the market.  You'll certainly be able to charge more in California than you would in Alabama.  Generally a sofa is around $500 to recover. A chair is around $325 in the market I live in.  I don't think 600 is outrageous for a sofa, depending on the amount of work that might need to be re-done like re-tie springs, tufting, etc.  You have to take into account the amount of fabric (about 20 yds) needed to recover a sofa.  If the sofa is an antique and high quality, people will pay more to restore it.  I think you're best bet is to shop the market you live in. Call around and get pricing from your competitors, that's a good place to start.
Gdrt18TPaa	Not very. Clowns are not in a very high demand, and the work can be very seasonal. On top of this, people's expectations are that clowns are a cheap form of children's entertainment, so they do not ever want to pay very much. <br>  <br>  If you have a special talent, and want desperately to be a clown, think about joining a cirque group like Cirque de Soleil. They pay very well and you usually get to travel a lot.|`|c0cc132e96e606ab147daec2116822d0aa	As strictly a clown, unless you are very good, the money is not.

Cet article offre 10 conseils pratiques pour bien lancer un nouveau produit...<br>  <br>  En voici une synthèse :<br>  <br>  Conseil N° 1 : Ne vous laissez pas abuser par un volume de ventes important la 1er année...<br>  <br>  L'expérience montre que certains produits ne survivent pas à la fin des campagnes marketing qui les soutiennent. Il est donc important de créer un plan marketing avec des effets long terme.<br>  <br>  Conseil N° 2 : Ne vous fiez pas trop aux intentions d'achat des études de marché.<br>  <br>  Ce conseil qui vaut dans les deux sens: il faut savoir écouter les études de marchés, et parfois au contraire faire confiance à son instinct (Exemple: Sony avec son Walkman).<br>  <br>  Conseil N° 3 : Une publicité ou une communication inadaptée peut nuire à votre produit.<br>  <br>  C'est la première publicité qui va positionner votre produit aux yeux de vos clients. Il est donc essentiel de soigner cette 1er fois (on ne fait qu'une seule fois une Première Bonne Impression). Les études d'Ipsos montrent qu'une mauvaise campagne de pub peut réduire jusqu'à 30% les volumes de ventes !<br>  <br>  Conseil N° 4 : Soignez votre packaging.<br>  <br>  Les linéaires sont chargés de produits, c'est une lutte de tous les jours pour rester présent en grande distribution. Il faut donc se différencier un maximum de ses concurrents... et aussi des propres produits (couleur, forme, taille, emballage...). N'oubliez pas que les consommateurs ne peuvent acheter que ce qu'ils peuvent voir !<br>  <br>  Conseil N° 5 : Réfléchissez bien au nom de votre produit.<br>  <br>  Trop souvent les noms des produits sont trop longs, trop compliqués ou ne veulent rien dire. S'il est bon il sera mémorisé et reconnu en linéaire, sinon il sera vite oublié...<br>  <br>  Conseil N° 6 : Il faut se différencier mais intelligemment !<br>  <br>  Le but n'est pas de faire complètement différent de ses concurrents, mais se différencier sur un bénéfice MAJEUR per?u par vos clients. Ce sont ces bénéfices majeurs qui permettront de déclencher l'acte d'achat et de vraiment vous différencier. Mais avant tout vous devez conna?tre ce qu'attendent vos clients, quels sont leurs besoins.<br>  <br>  Conseil N° 7 : Dotez votre produit d'un avantage concurrentiel à long terme.<br>  <br>  Si vous ne donnez pas à votre produit un avantage UNIQUE vous contriburez à défricherer un nouveau marché et non pas à installer votre produit comme la référence.<br>  Sinon vous vous serez à la merci d'un nouvel entrant qui sortira un clone de votre produit mais avec un budget marketing beaucoup plus important (ex: les yaourts BIO).<br>  <br>  Si vous créez un produit supplémentaire dans votre gamme, faites extrêment attention à le positionner en mettant en avant un bénéfice SUPPLEMENTAIRE. Si vous faites que redire différemment un bénéfice existant vous risquez de canibaliser vos ventes.<br>  <br>  Conseil N°8 : Définissez votre prix avec soin.<br>  <br>  Pour définir votre prix prenez en compte la valeur per?ue par le client, et pas seulement prix de revient ou le prix des concurrents. En effet en enrichissant votre produit de services complémentaires peu onéreux vous pouvez "fausser" le reférentiel prix de votre client.<br>  Néanmoins sachez qu'il est TOUJOURS plus facile de baisser les prix que les augmenter... Donc visez haut !<br>  <br>  Conseil N°9 : Il faut cibler ses clients et comprendre leurs motivations.<br>  <br>  Plut?t que de dépenser de l'argent avec une publicité générique il est préférable de détecter les motivations de vos clients et leur processus d'achat (prescripteur, couleurs, prix....) et de cibler vos efforts marketing.<br>  <br>  Conseil N° 10 : Anticipez l'évolution de votre produit produit sur les années suivantes.<br>  <br>  Il n'est pas nécessaire de faire un business plan sur 3 ans... Ce qui est important c'est de penser à des scénarios "boucliers": ajout d'une innovation en cas de sortie d'un produit concurrent, évolution du produit en version "light"...<br>  --------------------------<br>  <br>  Comment faire un Plan Marketing (Partie 1)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Voici les 3 questions essentielles avant de lancer un nouveau produit et faire son plan marketing.<br>  <br>  1- Satisfaire une demande !<br>  <br>  C'est la première question à se poser : à quel problème client répond mon produit ? Quel(s) besoin(s) je vais satisfaire ? Y a t'il une demande ou un marché suffisant ? Quels sont les barrières à l'entrée ? ...<br>  <br>  2- Quelle stratégie ?<br>  <br>  Pour définir sa stratégie il faut :<br>  - Choisir une cible précise.<br>  - Choisir quoi proposer à cette cible: développer un nouveau produit/concept ? faire émerger un nouveau bénéfice ? faire une nouvelle offre ? ...<br>  Pour cela il faut se baser sur les forces actuelles de l'entreprise plut?t que de devoir développer de nouvelles compétences.<br>  <br>  3- La "Value proposition"<br>  <br>  Il faut ensuite rédiger sa "value proposition" (ou "unique selling proposition" ou son positionnement produit): le que va faire le produit ? à qui s'adresse t'il ? à quel niveau prix ? ....<br>  <br>  La value proposition résume:<br>  1- Quels sont les bénéfices clientque le produit satisfait.<br>  2- A quel cible le produit s'adresse.<br>  3- A quel niveau de prix.<br>  <br>  Cette value proposition doit être communiquée partout et à tous: communiqué de presse, packaging, cartes de visites, fiches produits...<br>  <br>  Il faut bien entendu s'assurer que tous dans l'entreprise ont bien compris ce positionnement.|`|7b0b9cc33247bf6d9a0fbadba8bfb86aaa	Il faut des  années d'études pour savoir faire ?a !<br>  Commence par déterminer clairement ta cible, selon ton produits, le circuit de distribution, le prix ...(en travaillant rigouresement dessus)<br>  C'est tout un métier !|`|RtfVaS57aa	Bonjour, sache d'abord qu'aucune méthode ne garantit le SUCCES, on peut juste mettre un maximum de chances de son c?té. <br>  <br>  <br>  néanmoins, pour tout lancement de produit, les étapes sont les suivantes: <br>  _ étude(s) de marché afin de vérifier que le produit répond bien à un besoin. Etudes quantitatives (pour quantifier le marché: nombre potentiel d'acheteur, prix psychologique acceptable, estimation de la part de marché accessible, chiffre d'affaires et bénéfices prévisionnels...) et qualitatives (pour qualifier les consommateurs que tu cibles: données socio-démographiques, psychographiques, styles de vie, appartenance à telle ou telle communuaté...). Les études de marché t'aident à mieux déimiter les contours de ta cible et à mieux cernet leurs attentes, sachant que mieux une entreprise conna?t ses clients (actuels et potentiels) et mieux elle est à même de les satisfaire. <br>  <br>  _ ensuite, le mix marketing (qu'on appelle aussi les 4P: price, product, place promotion, ou en bon fran?ais: prix, produit, distribution, et communication). T dois élaborer le mix de ton produit pour bien le lancer sur le marché: <br>  + produit de base (que tu enrichiras par la suite de produits dérivés et complémentaires qui rappelleront toujours ton produit de base)<br>  + prix élevé (c'est indispensable en phase de lancement car tu as besoin de rentabiliser les efforts pour industrialiser et lancer le produit), c'est ce qu'on appelle une politique tarifaire d'écrémage<br>  + distribution sélective: au départ, tu ne distribueras ton produit que dans un nombre restreint de points de vente, et pour cause tu n'auras certainement pas les moyens de t'offrir mieux<br>  + publicité ciblée qui a pour objectif impératif de créer une notoriété, de favoriser l'essai du produit (des opérations du type dégustations gratuites ou distribution d'échantillons marchent bien en général)<br>  <br>  A ce niveau-là, tes ventes seront faibles: on produit ne démarre jamais en trombe, sauf si tu disposes des moyens d'une multinationale...auquel cas tu n'as besoin d'aucun conseil...<br>  <br>  Ta clientèle sera composée d'"early adopters", des pionnniers, que tu dois impérativement identifier et cibler dans ta communication. ces pionniers créeront le buzz, la rumeur qui fera ensuite décoller les ventes. <br>  <br>  Tes bénéfices seront négatifs, c'est-à-àdire que ce seront des pertes; car il faut bien comprendre qu'il faut du temps avant d'atteindre le point mort (la date à la quelle l'éqiulibre financier est atteint). <br>  <br>  Et le co?t unitaire de ton produit sera élevé, il devrait diminuer progressivement (notamment grace à l'effet d'apprentissaget aux économies d'échelle) si tes ventes décollent un jour...<br>  <br>  Enfin, sache que la méthodologie que je viens de te fournir est adaptable (et pour cause, le marketing n'est pas une science figée) et qu'il y aura toujours des gens pour te dire que j'ai omis quelque chose)<br>  <br>  Sache que cette méthodologie est tout ce qu'il y a de plus classique et que si tu veux surprendre tes futurs clients (surtout s'il s'agit d'adolescents), tu devras redoubler de créativité et t'orienter vers ce qu'on les techniques alternatives de lancement de produit: marketing tribal et marketing de bouche-à-oreille, utilisation des tabous dans la communication, blogs et podcasts, communautés virtuelles (MySpace, Habbo Hotel...)...<br>  <br>  Voilà, j'espère t'avoir éclairé, en dernier conseil retiens bien que l'esprit marketing (satisfaire le client avec ce qui marche) est bien plus important que l'application à la lettre de la meilleure des méthodologies. <br>  <br>  good luck!

I think Experian and Equifax are the most common ones.  The financial institution which advised you of your CCJ should be able to tell you which credit reference agencies they use, and may even be able to give you a form to complete to request the details.  Usually there is a charge of ￡2 and you would need to supply your current and past addresses as CCJ data sticks on your file for several years.

Homeowners attempt to install improvements that either don't affect the price or bring the price down, for example: navajo wallpaper or 50's diner tile throughout the home.  Upgrades such as nicer light fixtures, wood floors, granite countertops, stainless steel appliances can add value to your home.<br>  <br>  But remember, the value is in the eyes of (1) the market and (2) the buyer.  If the buyer doesn't see your upgrades as adding value, you may receive offers (when you sell your home) that are below what you feel it is worth.  <br>  <br>  If you are selling, consult a REALTOR.  If you are looking to upgrade, home improvement stores are educated on the current trends- talk to them.

Now people with poor credit can get the same choices as those with the good or mediocre credit. Today you can use bad credit personal loans for many purposes like car purchase, vacation or even debt consolidation.<br>  <br>  But if you have some assets to offer as collateral, your chances brighten. The primary reason why people with poor credit history do not get loans is because the lenders are scared that the borrowers will default again. But if you can offer collateral, your lender is secure in the knowledge that his money is in safe hands. You have to try and meet the repayment schedule, failing which you lose the asset.<br>  <br>  If you do not have collateral, go for an unsecured personal loan, which is rare for people with bad credit. It is necessary that your credit record should be clean for an unsecured personal loan. However, some lenders can accept your case due to inevitable reasons.|`|9SfCFSMbaa	The company I'm most familiar with that helps people with bad credit obtain loans is:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mortgageous.com/noriskcredit" rel="nofollow">http://www.mortgageous.com/noriskcredit</a><br>  <br>  There are 2 types of financing that might match your needs:  a cash advance for the full $1,200 or a line of credit you can draw on as needed.

It is 4 bedroom 2.5 bath and were asking $275,000  We have a number of good showings but why no offers ?   <br>  <br>  From a question like that many of us can look at your market, and then provide an answer that should assist you.

Once Licensed most larger Real Estate Brokerages have their agent development courses that they teach.  I used to teach Coldwell Banker Universitys Fast Start class to new agents.  ProSchools has a great online course.  I attended The Rockwell School of Real Estate.  The trainer also wrote the course manuals that many schools use.  Most community colleges have a real estate course if you feel a classroom envoronment would be more beneficial.  Personally I feel a live classroom setting is best as the instructors are able to put the info into real working world examples.

52526b559c45eb57204a29b41ddd8553aa	Your question has several elements so first I will give you the general rule of thumb.  Points add to the closing costs, discounts subtract from the funded amount of the loan.  Points are deductable and discounts are not btw.  In the end they both add as a discount means less loan so more cash needed if doing a purchase.  In refinance situations a discount is often covered by raising the loan amount to cover itself.  So a 100K loan costing 1 point will be funded at 100K and closing costs will have the 1,000 dollars added to the rest of the fees.  A 100K loan bought down by a discount point will fund at 99K and be amortized at 100K.  Many lenders will just make the loan 101K and the cost is built in.  A lender will not directly allow discount points for rate buydown to also be financed so the loan is often made higher with the cost hidden as a limited cash out request.|`|AA10074148	Normally if a document or a saying as you have put it is 1 point origination fee that has to be paid by the borrower.<br>  <br>  You should have your mortgage broker prepare a Good Faith Estimate (GFE) for you this document will reflect all cost that you are required to pay in connection with this loan.

This has happened to me and I had a right 'to do' with Paypal.  It is a new thing they are doing in conjunction with ebay.  Apparently, it is meant to be with 'high risk' items such as mobiles etc or high risk transactions, ie, the seller is new with little or no feedback.  It's right, they insist you send the item and you are not allowed access to the money until the buyer has left you postitive feedback, (if they dont leave you positive feedback you can 'apply' for your money after 21 days!)  I was furious but there's nothing you can do!  I emailed my buyers telling them that I couldnt get my hands on the money until they left me postiive feedback and to be honest, they were all really good and left me feedback on the day they rec'd the items.  It then takes Paypal up to 24 hours to recognise that you have the positive feedback, they then release the money for you to withdraw.

Even if your boss likes you that doesn't mean that there is job security because the world is unpredictable. A company could go under for any reasons. So its up to you to fight for your opportunities. So yes search for better jobs and leave your job when you get hired for the new one.<br>  <br>  By the way, don't get caught up in a situation where the boss agrees to pay you more and doesn't come through. Make sure that you see it in your paycheck first and if it doesn't show up then you should just leave.|`|2o7WsWHFaa	I was recently in a very similar situation.  I think there are two solid options that you can pursue.<br>  <br>  First, its absolutely fine to look for other jobs.  Unless your employer asked you to commit to a certain number of years, its assumed that you are a "free agent" and have the mobility to pursue any job that is appealing to you. <br>  <br>  Another option to try is to find a way to become engaged in more interesting projects in your current job situation.  Does your employer know that you feel underutilized and unappreciated?  If you did not talk about this in your annual review, schedule some time with your direct supervisor to talk about your job satisfaction.  Recently I did exactly that, and I discovered that my supervisor was unaware of my need to be more involved and engaged in our company's activities.  I suggested that he help me find a "mentor" within our division, and I began working with that person on more interesting projects.  I have a much higher level of satisfaction and I feel more appreciated!<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|12VQ4ETcaa	Of course it's okay.  Nobody else is going to grow your career for you.<br>  <br>  Now, it is important to be discreet.  If you start missing a lot of work to go to interviews, your employer might get frustrated and fire you.  Don't leave your resume in the photocopier or anything.<br>  <br>  It's good strategy to ask your employer to match the pay if you have another job lined up. Then you should call the prospective employer and tell them you got a counteroffer, and see what they do.|`|MuXcs6FTaa	You can always look. Having your current employer mach a new offer would probably not benefit you long term. Most of the time they will resent you for doing something like that. Try to have a honest conversation with your boss. If that does not work, then look around for a good job somewhere else where you are appreciated.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|XKwGJ8g5aa	Even if your employer kept you around at the higher pay, some bosses would view you as disloyal, and could potentially just be keeping you around until they find an adequate replacement who will work for what you used to make.<br>  Be very careful. Very.<br>  Also, sounds like you need a more challenging and rewarding working environment anyway.<br>  Best of Luck.

b8429713a5e80a8aa62b65d4174e5bd0aa	io ti consiglio la barclay card<br>  costa davvero poco, utilizza il circuito visa e quindi è accetata<br>  ovunque<br>  puoi vedere il sito|`|11XfsN1caa	Ciao!, penso che la Visa va bene. Ma se vuoi una carta dove nessuno storge il naso se la esibisci perche' e' garanzia di serieta', in qualsialsi parte del mondo .. E' la American Express, ma devi avere un certo tipo di budget, dipende cosa devi fare. Sicuramente un consulente bancario ti puo' aiutare. Ciao! Musashi|`|TXjI7HM0aa	non confondere il bancomat con la carta di credito!! le carte del circuito visa sono tutte buone  e abbastanza accessibili dai 25 ai 30 euro all'anno... american express... sarebbe la migliore.. secondo me ma costa qualcosa in piu'... senti la tua banca cosa ti consiglia... ciao|`|f22b3033edaff8e5a2fac6289399b9fbaa	Innanzitutto c'è da sfatare un mito. Di carte di credito ce ne sono 500.000 mila tipi ma quello che conta è il circuito a cui la carta si appoggia. tutto il resto non ha nessun valore pratico. <br>  I circuiti sono:<br>  1) Visa e Mastercard i più diffusi (con alcune piccole differenze che poi ti dico)<br>  2) american Express<br>  3) diners<br>  4) una giapponese che non mi ricordco mai come si chiama ma che qua in italia non è molto diffusa.<br>  Diner e american express sono quelle che io chiamo le carte dei vip ma che allo stato pratico sono molto meno diffuse, vengono accettate in molti meno esercizi e costano di più. Se poi tu vuoi tutti i mesi a casa la rivista della diners loro te la mandano. solo che la carta la paghi 200 euro all'anno invece che 20.<br>  Il circuito visa storicamente è un momentino più diffuso negli stati angosassoni mentre invece mastercard è un pochino più diffusa in europa continentale. Questa differenza qualche anno fa era più accentuata, oggi non so quanto sia ancora valida. <br>  <br>  Una buona carta di credito innazitutto ha i numeri in rilievo. diffida delle electron perchè non in tutti i paesi sono accettate. <br>  I prelievi all'atm comunque costano il 4% secco su tutte le carte. <br>  Se poi prelevi in valuta estera c'è anche la commissione di cambio ma questa non dipende dalla carta ma dalla banca che la emette. <br>  Un po' di anni fa, con tutte le carte di credito c'era anche una commissione fissa per il rifornimento carburante. Questo perchè i benzinai italiani non accettavano di pagare loro le commissioni come invece fanno e facevano tutti i commercianti di questo mondo. Oggi molte carte hanno comunque tolto anche questa commissione. <br>  Per il resto scegli tu quale carta fare. Io per esempio ne ho due, una visa e una mastercard. mi trovo bene con entrambe. <br>  Mia moglie ne ha una visa ma con quella invece lei si trova benissimo, io invece un po' meno visto che la usa troppo per i miei gusti. Scherzo ovviamente.|`|Q4Ze0Bojaa	La migliore di tutte per queste situazioni e' senza dubbio la Visa. Il prezzo che trattiene meno speso quando prelievi al bancomat all'estero ha a che fare con la banca dalla quale prelievi. Io uso MPS.<br>  AmEx la accettano pochi negozi, e la Mastercard non ha la miglior qualita'/prezzo . Altre carte internazionali non ne conosco per ora...

1Fg7Tybvaa	I know that I don't have to tell you this, now but if something<br>  looks to good to be true, then it's not.<br>  <br>  The first question one has to ask himself is why is this<br>  person going to give me 10% of his money just to cash<br>  his check? They say they need the money, they don't have<br>  a checking account bla bla bla. They look for people<br>  like yourself that have the desire to help and make a<br>  little extra cash on the side.<br>  <br>  They are hoping that you will send them the money<br>  because "they need it so desperately"  as soon as<br>  the check arrives, you were smarter than the average<br>  person that got scammed, you tried to have the check<br>  validated, checked to see if the bank existed and assumed<br>  that you were safe in cashing it, unfortunately a month <br>  later the check bounced like a rubber ball and the<br>  scammer received received 90% face value of the<br>  check.<br>  <br>  What you could have done is once that you have validated<br>  that the bank was real, contact the bank and ask them<br>  to validate the availability of the funds before cashing it.<br>  You would have known right then that the check was <br>  either phony or did not have any funds available.<br>  <br>  Even if the the man is caught it is highly unlikely that<br>  you will ever see your money again.<br>  <br>  Here is a useful link so you can look at and be aware of<br>  the hundreds (maybe thousands) of scams today|`|e9c3e42d64ceb58add3e61412e049096aa	usually they ask you to wire the money, and most people do it BEFORE the counterfeit is discovered - so the bank takes the wired money out of their account, and doesn't credit the counterfeit one.  Which makes them, out the 90% part.|`|0c5Xupi5aa	He was hoping that you were going to give him the 90% of that check, where as you would have been charged the full 100% of the amount because it was counterfeit you would end up losing 190% whereas the scammer made up with 90% of it.<br>  <br>  If you didnt send him the money then good for you, you didnt lose anything except time and possibly charges for a counterfeit check.|`|5574a09cda70e1c7bbb5303d4899415aaa	The scam is that the bank has to clear the check in 3 days, but they can come back and demand the money when they figure out it's counterfeit/forged/etc. several weeks later.|`|5b2FmtN7aa	It happened to me too, once when I was trying to sell one of my cars.  The guy interested in the car sent me the Money Orders for $800 each.  He sent the amount for the car and a bit more for the delivery of the car overseas.  So I went to the bank to deposit the money.  The bank teller told me to wait and took the MO's to the bank manager.  He then called me to his office and told me the MO's were counterfeit.  I continued my emails with this person and he said he now needed the money back because he and his sister were involved in an accident and needed to pay for hospital care.  He gave me the information to send the Money Gram and all.  Of course the Money Orders never got deposited.  I sent the Money orders and emails to an office that does investigations on this when it comes to USPS money orders.  <br>  I was lucky the bank noticed the Money order were fake.  BUt not every one runs the same luck.  <br>  As for how they make money?  They urge you to get the money back to them fast, because they want to beat the time it takes the bank to find out the check is bad and the funds are sitting in your account.  So they rip you off your own money.<br>  As for the possibilities of getting this guy.....they are close to none.  Africa, specifically Nigeria is full of this scammers.

Right now the way things are your money is at no more risk at Citibank as with any other banks. Your best bet is to put only the amount which is insured by the FDIC (100K) in each bank. This way if they go belly up you are covered.|`|H3UrfDrsaa	If your account is less than the amount insured by the FDIC, it should be safe.  The new limits for depositors is now $250,000 and that amount applies to all depositors of an insured bank.
OacSIfSiaa	The answer is simply too short of a credit history.  It takes years to build a record.<br>  So far you have done great by keeping your total debt utilization under the recommended 30% level.  This is the ratio of how much credit you have minus how much you owe.  Keep it that way and your score will rise.<br>  <br>  Just remember that one lousy late payment can do a lot of harm and late payments remain on your credit report for 2 years (Running of Reporting Period - Section 605 [15 U.S.C. § 1681c]<br>  Also do not apply for too many cards or ask for increases as this also can affect your score.<br>  <br>  AS to what some have said, well first of all, FICO does NOT consider your income to debt ratio (that is used to figure ones net worth) also the number of names does not affect ones score.  Many times a simple misspelling occurs (now too many strange names may look bad) it is still not a factor in determining ones credit score.<br>  <br>  Too learn the truth about FICO scores go directly to FICO to understand how scores work.  Here is a link to their website<br>  <a href="http://www.myfico.com/Default.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.myfico.com/Default.aspx</a><br>  <br>  Hope this helps to answer your question.|`|Ti0q1Btiaa	Score is not based solely on payment history.<br>  <br>  Your two cards have given you a total of $15,000.00 in available credit, less any current balance.<br>  <br>  Based on your income, that may be more credit than you can presently handle, if you maxed them both, and you could do that.<br>  <br>  This is the result of one having too many cards, even though they do not use the max and make payments on time.<br>  <br>  The ratio of income to available credit is one criteria.|`|kwPSng5zaa	Your score is no only determined by your timely payment. I am sure that over time it will go up but sometimes even things as simple as having too many different addresses can suppress your score. If your name is in many different variations such as John Brown, John T Brown, John T.S. Brown, this can hurt your credit too. when you get a mortgage and you start paying on time you could see a big jump also. Credit reporting is sometimes weird, I personally do not believe that even the credit reporting agencies fully understand how it works.|`|6SIjchQUaa	The average credit score is 675 so yours isn't bad.  As a college student your income is probably not very high so your credit score reflects the fact that you hae $6,900 in available credit and if you were to use it all you may not be able to repay.|`|0yqQg9CXaa	The way to get top 800+ scores is to use your 2 credit cards regularly and either pay in full each month or make sure you never exceed 30% of your available credit at any time during the month.<br>  Also, time of credit history is important.<br>  Never close your oldest account.<br>  A new credit card will reduce your score for the first 6 months.<br>  So never open a new account before purchasing a home or a car.<br>  /

If so, then he needs to do his outstanding returns and get the bill reduced.<br>  Secondly, if they are not estimates, he should contact HMRC to agree a repayment schedule. He will need to show them income and expenditure statements and make an offer to pay by installments. They will not reject a reasonable offer, but he must speak to them, as ignoring the issue will just land him in more trouble. Eventually, they will take the debt to the County Court and if he defaults on any judgement the court makes, then he can he sent to prison. The prison sentance would be for contempt of court, not for unpaid tax. But he will still owe the tax.<br>  I dont think anyone would advise him to go bankrupt for such a small amount of money.|`|AA12180617	YES it is a prisonable offence and going bankrupt does NOT remove the liability for the tax.<br>  <br>  the tax man can make them bankrupt AND place a custodial sentence on him as well!!<br>  <br>  speak to the tax man do not ignore it - try and get a reassessment and a payment schedule set up.<br>  <br>  Ignoring a problem  makes it worse!!|`|HP1pToMOaa	Yes it's fraud. the Inland Revenue are very tough.

oFiGyMWraa	You appear to have 1 tenancy agreement that several tenants have signed. Almost certainly you will be "jointly and severally" liable. This means that the landlord could sue any 1 of you for the whole outstanding amount. If the others have disappeared the landlord will clearly go after the one who is still there!<br>  <br>  In practice landlords are unlikely to take you to court, because the costs would probably be more than what they would get back. Even if they did take you to court they can't sue for the entire rent until next October. They have a duty to get another tenant and can only sue for the time the house is empty.<br>  <br>  Its more likely that they would just evict you if you stopped paying. Similarly, if you just left they would keep your deposit but that would likely be the last of it.<br>  <br>  Please be aware, if you have signed a tenancy agreement you cannot just find a replacement and move them in. They are not a tenant, they have no rights to be there (from the landlord's point of view) and you could continue to be liable for anything they do.|`|rb53GPZLaa	You are all jointly liable and the landlord can go after you for the full rent until the tenancy expires if it's for a fixed term. It might be worth appealing to the landlord-you never know they may consider reducing the rent or accepting late payment, rather than you not paying at all.  Eviction proceedings can start within 14 days I believe but consider how this will look when you are looking for a new house. It's worthwhile asking your landlord to consider extra security measures but  failing that ensure you have adequate insurance.|`|8vwfvBpHaa	You and your roommates are jointly liable for fulfilling your rental contract by paying rent each month. If one roommate does not pay, the other roommates are still liable for the entire rent. You would have to pay the entire amount then sue the non-paying roommate for the unpaid rent and breach of contract. <br>  <br>  Your landlord has several options if you do not pay the entire rent. This means that you and your roommates defaulted on your lease contract. Depending on the law in your state, your landlord may be able to evict you while you are still in possession of the house. If you voluntarily surrender possession of the house, then the landlord can either terminate your lease, sue you for unpaid rent and breach of contract (which may include future rent that you owe), or repossess the house and re-let it to another tenant. <br>  <br>  You may have a defense if the landlord sues you because you described that the house was unsafe: <br>  1) Argue "constructive eviction": A tenant must show that there was permanent interference (or re-occurring) or substantial interference to your use of the property, you must give the landlord notice of this interference, you must give the landlord time to fix the problem, AND you must then vacate the premises. <br>  <br>  2) Argue"Implied warranty of habitability": In the rental of any residential unit, an implied warranty exists in the lease, that the landlord will deliver over and maintain, throughout the period of the tenancy, premises that are safe, clean and fit for human habitation. To prove this, a tenant must show that the property is uninhabitable to a reasonable person (based on the housing code), must notify landlord and allowed the landlord time to correct, the problem must have existed when rent was withheld, and you do NOT have to vacate premises in this instance.

You can Feature your ad there.<br>  <br>  And <a href="http://www.craigslist.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.craigslist.com</a> (UK, USA).<br>  <br>  2. Post your links to your pages to social bookmarking sites that accept it.<br>  <br>  3. Have a signature link in various forums that points back to your site. Never spam.<br>  Create a blog / mini site of your own to talk about your site using <a href="http://www.blogger.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.blogger.com</a><br>  <br>  Keep at it more than 4 times (or more) online a week to see good results.

XxUsLqXRaa	No.....or at least, highly unlikely.  In fact, if you take out a bank loan to pay the deposit, you will drop your credit rating to a point where you may not qualify for a home loan anyway.  Besides, this is not at all a good financial decision on your part.  Think about it----you're wanting to take out a loan so that you can qualify to take out yet another separate loan.  The smartest thing you can do would be to wait until you have more money saved up.  And you probably don't have the choice anyway since I cant see any bank giving you a loan if you already have another brand new bank loan in existence.  I know you think 3 or 4 years is a long time to wait to save up for a 20% deposit, but this is the biggest purchase you will likely ever make and rushing into it will hurt you in the future.  IF you did find a bank that would loan you the 10%, and then you also successfully found a bank that would loan you the remaining balance, you'd be paying the interest on TWO loans!  Have you taken that into consideration when figuring out if you can afford the repayments or not?  And what would happen if you and your girlfriend split up and you didn't have her additional income?  Also, have you taken into consideration what closing costs are?  If 10% is all you have saved up, expect to use about 1/3 of that on closing costs. I know you may be all excited about buying a home and you dont want to wait 3-4 years to do it, but your idea is just simply not smart AT ALL.  Forget about it for right now, but set a goal....keep saving up your money until you have at LEAST a 10% deposit, plus about another 4-5 thousand for closing costs.  Ideally, (here in the US) you would want a 20% deposit so you arent forced to buy private mortgage insurance, and so that you can get the lowest interest rate possible.  To get a personal loan for the deposit, you'd be paying a much higher interest rate because it would have to be an unsecured loan (and your credit would have to be great).  Then, your home loan interest would be higher because #1) your credit score dropped when you took out the personal loan, and #2) you didnt have the 20% deposit.  If you figured it all out (the interest you'd be paying over the lifespan of both loans plus the additional money for the private mortgage insurance) it's all going to cost you tens of thousands of dollars more.  Trust me.....in 3 or 4 more years, when you can walk into a bank with the 10-20% deposit available, plus an additional few thousand in your hands for closing costs, you'll get the best rate possible PLUS you'll be treated with respect.  I'm afraid if you walked into a bank right now, they'd laugh you right back out.|`|y4SUDnpaaa	Mortgage lenders will not allow you to use borrowed money for a down payment. If you try to get around that and not disclose that the money is borrowed you will be committing fraud. The chances you would get by with it are slim. The loan will be on your credit report and any new loans are questioned to ensure you are not borrowing money for a down payment. The reasoning for not allowing down payments to be from borrowed funds is that it makes the mortgage loan much riskier. People are more likely to 'walk away' from a home that they have not invested any of there own money in. That's why the more down payment you make the better the interest rate, most people are not likely to give up the money they have invested by losing the home through foreclosure.|`|32e46f5365de97f08e8132dd292b1761aa	You're not normally allowed to use a loan as a deposit, of course it depends if you tell your mortgage company about it or not.  But it would probably show up on their credit checks anyway.  If you think about it, if you are paying off a loan as well as a mortgage that is going to be much more of a financial burden than if you waited and saved up for the deposit.<br>  <br>  You have to think about, not just that you can afford it at the moment, but what would happen if you or your girlfriend lost your job?

Pendant la première période du secondaire (le trias), la Pangée dérive vers le nord et commence à se fracturer. Au jurassique (il y a environ 200 millions d’années), elle se trouve séparée en deux grands continents : la Laurasie au nord (qui regroupe l’Asie, l’Europe et l’Amérique du Nord), et le Gondwana au sud (qui englobe l’Amérique du Sud et l’Afrique). Entre les deux s’étend une vaste mer, appelée Téthys.<br>  <br>  Puis, lentement, le Gondwana se morcelle à son tour. L’Antarctique et l’Australie forment un bloc qui se sépare des autres, tandis que l’Inde entame une longue dérive vers le nord. L’océan Indien s’ouvre peu à peu. En même temps, l’Amérique du Nord dérive vers l’ouest et s’éloigne du Gondwana. Ce mouvement donne naissance à l’océan Atlantique. Il provoque aussi le soulèvement de deux importantes cha?nes de montagnes en Amérique du Nord : les montagnes Rocheuses et la Sierra Nevada.<br>  <br>  Dans l’hémisphère Sud, l’Amérique du Sud et l’Afrique commencent à s’éloigner l’une de l’autre. Enfin, au crétacé (il y a environ 140 millions d’années), l’Afrique commence à remonter vers le nord (en direction du bloc formé par l’Europe et l’Asie)

Il venditore ne è perfettamente a conoscenza, e bisogna insistere presso l’agente (se è lui ad occuparsi della vendita ) perché comunichi subito questa informazione. Nei casi più dubbi ci si deve recare all’ufficio tecnico erariale (Ute) con una copia integrale del rogito in possesso del venditore. Qui sono, di regola, riportati i dati che permetteranno di ottenere allo sportello la nuova rendita. Va ricordato che con la legge 662/1996, tutte le rendite catastali sono state aumentate del 5 %.<br>  <br>  Il percorso è quindi semplice: rendita x 105 = valore catastale (base sulla quale si applicano le varie aliquote d’imposta )<br>  <br>  Naturalmente può accedere (anche se di raro ) che il “valore catastale” sia superiore a quello di mercato. Come comportarsi? Se si dichiara il prezzo effettivamente pagato, si rischia l’accertamento. E in questo caso il fisco è libero di determinare il valore che giudica più appropriato, anche addirittura superiore al “valore catastale”, e applicare su questa nuova base tutte le imposte e le relative sanzioni. Oppure può riconoscere la congruità del valore dichiarato, senza ulteriori problemi. Ma nessuno può sapere in anticipo con esattezza quale sarà la stima dell’Ufficio del registro.<br>  <br>  Un esempio:<br>  Se viene venduto un immobile di categoria A2 (civile) classe 3, a Milano, zona censuaria 2 (semicentro), vani 4 (bagno, cucina, corridoio e tre stanze, circa 80-90 m2 ), la rendita catastale è di 1.160.000: il valore minimo da dichiarare è allora di 122 milioni. Su questo importo si calcolano tutte le imposte, in base alle varie aliquote.<br>  <br>  Spero di esserti stata di aiuto. :)|`|YSezziCbaa	La rendita catastale è il valore degli immobili determinato a fini fiscali.<br>  Viene determinata moltiplicando le tariffe di estimo per la consistenza degli immobili, intesa come vani o metri quadrati.<br>  Le tariffe d'estimo vengono determinate dagli Uffici del Territorio tenendo conto della tipologia e della zona dell'immobile.<br>  Nella compravendite il valore catastale che rappresenta la base imponibile viene determinato moltiplicando la rendita catastale rivalutata del 5% per diversi coefficienti che dipendono dal tipo di immobile (es. case 110, 60 per gli uffici..)<br>  Per il calcolo delle imposte sul reddito, nel quadro B relativo ai redditi dei fabbricati, la rendita va rivalutata del 5%.<br>  Ai fini della determinazione dell'ICI la rendita catastale va rivalutata del 5% e moltiplicata per un coefficiente diverso a seconda della categoria catastale.

However, what you can do, is file the paperwork now, so that in 6 weeks, you'll receive your first unemployment check, and not have to wait longer if you wait out the 5 weeks then file. They'll already have you in the system.|`|096f3deabc4b7c1a2578ff7cd1e3b1f9aa	I know I was able to collect unemployment while on severance.  I live in California though.

For example you can get a job in these feilds:<br>  Corrections officer<br>  Physical therapist<br>  Police officer<br>  Personal trainer<br>  Construction worker<br>  Armed Guardsmen<br>  I know this is not what you were looking for but I have never heard of anyone turning power lifting or body building into a professional career. <br>  You could also try and join a team within your school like wrestling and combine that with your skills in powerlifting. Wrestling requires alot of physical strength,agility, and low body weight and is a very challenging sport. Or just ask the school couch they may have ideas in how to direct you in this. Hope you find your answer.<br>   I did a google search and found under career buider.com a list of searches for  "Personal Trainer".

4vLt3SqFaa	The issue is your vulnerability to outside influences based upon financial hardship.  In some cases it could be argued that failure to file might endanger your security clearance status more than filing.  <br>  <br>  In truth it depends totally upon the circumstances. If you had, through no fault fo your own, had to file - such as huge medical bills - then no issue.  If it was because of bad choices (lifestyle, credit cards, divorce, or bad choice of mortgage etc.) then expect to be turned down because of poor judgment, not due to poor credit.|`|ssYRhvdfaa	Most likely........one of the reasons for security breach is financial issues.......money when you need it is a powerful persuader.......<br>  <br>  report all spammers.|`|rl0Zq1gvaa	It largely depends upon the job and the situation, and most background investigations take this into account.  While you probably won't be granted a clearance for some top-level jobs with the NSA, I doubt you would have trouble getting a clearance for some of the manual labor positions required to work in some areas of a Navy submarine.  My guess is you're looking at a position somewhere in between, so it would just depend on how they feel about the circumstances.<br>  <br>  In short, I would say that if the background investigation involves what's called a "life-style polygraph," then you probably wouldn't be able to pass the financial requirements.  Otherwise, I would say your chances are probably 50/50.|`|Wscsgyd5aa	If your married to a foreigner you will have problems getting Clearance.

When you move out of one on one sales, say to the management of other salesmen or the developement of marketing programs math becomes important.  Math is really a way of describing and presenting reality.  The soul of math is in story (practical or actual) problem solving.  Have you ever wathed the TV show "Numbers"?  That show does a good job of showing how powerful the use of math can be.

Recently however, it has not been so easy, for instance when the product is sold in a foreign currency in the world market. In a country like south africa which is very in gold reserves there was a time when the Rand strengthened against the US$, GBP and Euro-- the result was catastrophic as gold mines had to be temporarily closed due to the fact that gold is traded in US$ and the costs to run the mine (including salaries and wages) exceeded the selling price of the product. Therefore it really depends on which industry it affects. And bear in mind the unemployment rate effect of such currency fluctuations.|`|3ea8e5b873ac3f5934108aa0d97191c9aa	How about all Americans stop going over there.

Germany is one of the few economies in the world that exports more than it imports (I believe Japan does this as well), and as the euro increases in value, it will be more expensive for purchasing countries to afford German goods. And since Germany is one of the powerhouses of the EU, this could make it more difficult for the EU has a whole. However, the rising value of the EU really helps the poorer parts of Europe by increasing their purchasing power on the international market and increasing the draw for international skilled workers to earn a comparatively better wage.  Overall, my opinion is that the increased euro value makes it much more difficult for the modernized, richer countries in the EU to fund EU programs in the poorer parts...it remains to be seen how this will pan out, though.

The minute you give them your credit card and personal information you have now opened your computer to unwanted cookies on your hard drive, annoying pop-up windows and if you are on a PC you open your computer to viruses that can wipe you out.<br>  <br>  A lot of work to collect the "reward payments" that payout is not worth the effort over time. You will need to sign up for many types of offers, most of which require you to use a credit card. You start a week trial service with varies types of businesses or services, such as, an Internet service provider, book club, credit monitoring service, etc. to get your reward. If you don't cancel the trial, you end up being charged for the service and each service has different rules about how and when you can cancel. Very cumbersome!<br>  <br>  Since you will need to sign up for at least a dozen offers before you get to $100 in rewards, it's very easy to forget what you have signed up for, or the problems you will have canceling in time to to be charged the full amount. The Cash Create recruiters you see here over exaggerate how much money you can earn because once you've done the high-dollar trials ($8-10 each) once, you are left with small rewards of a dollar or two. The survey business is not an efficient way to make money and you are more than likely to loose in the end.|`|8b72b9348ff6a5df74500243413b09feaa	Telecommuting jobs can be done from home.<br>  Hope these job websites beneficial to you.<br>  <a href="http://www.usejob.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.usejob.com</a><br>  <a href="http://hotjobs.yahoo.com">http://hotjobs.yahoo.com</a><br>  <a href="http://careers.msn.com" rel="nofollow">http://careers.msn.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.craigslist.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.craigslist.org</a>|`|12e15ba933e02817747ea6230c7199aeaa	Rachel:<br>  <br>  congrats on your new baby!

I know of an Internet marketing business opportunity that you should find out more about. It's a business that has a system that allows you to build it, develop it, then when it's up and running it allows you to exit and with the extra time you'll have, you'll be able to build, develop and run another. . .it's never ending, IF you're up to it. It's not difficult, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to do. It’s as simple as this: Shop on-line (do your regular shopping – toothpaste, toilet paper, deodorant, etc) and get paid for it, then get others to do the same thing and get paid for that, too.  It can be developed as a referral business or you can directly market the products. There is a huge variety of products to market, which gives you the advantage of choosing just a few products or even just one product that you're interested in and really get behind it. The affiliated corporation takes care of inventory, shipping, billing/payment procedures, bookkeeping, business reports, etc. Ultimately, you're getting paid for redirecting your shopping and referring others to do the same. It's fun, it's easy, and it is incredibly profitable. There's a saying: We making friends, making money, making a difference. If you'd like more information, contact me at hoozdaboss@aol.com

Per cui prima devi avere una licenza, occhi se hai tabacchi, o altro le licenze sono differenti) poi scegli un bar che abbia un contratto ancora nei primi 6 anni cosi' puoi subentrare nel cotratto esistente. I vantagggi e' che se sei bravo e hai poco personale guadagni molto. Lo svnataggio e' che chiudi tardi, apri presto e non hai wee-keend.|`|RuLAf11Maa	acquisti con il bar la nomea che ha buona o cattiva<br>  tanti sacrifici che una società non ti aiuta ad affrontare.<br>  vuoi diventare padrone si ma di un attività che puio svolgere da solo.<br>  le società durano poco perchè c'è sempre chi fa di più|`|og8rQPwJaa	hai il vantaggio che sei tu il "padrone", quindi decidi tu in molte cose.<br>  Ma ti assicuro che ha molti svantaggi, se tutti quelli che si apprestano ad aprire un bar ne fossero a conoscenza, il 90% rinuncerebbe. Oltre alle difficoltà, non è come un lavoratore dipendente che finisce le sue ore e poi fa quel che vuole. Ti condiziona tutta la vita, e anche ai tuoi cari. Non è una cosa da prendere alla leggera.

yDH9iY5Vaa	Depends on how poor your credit is. I would try Patelco Credit Union online. Apply for the Visa Gold at 8.9% which is in fact a loan disguised as a credit card.<br>  Try for the 5k limit and, if approved, give them a call and ask them to raise the limit to suit your needs.|`|BGn6LUH8aa	Did u watch the news last night?the laws are in the midst of changing, if you are going to do this, do it now before the laws are all set in concrete, go to that website suggested below wwwhelpgetfunded.com, it looks pretty ace!|`|36b03f065d58891f68c4cbf4e9a79094aa	car deals like people with bad credit,they like to help get u back u on ur feet
