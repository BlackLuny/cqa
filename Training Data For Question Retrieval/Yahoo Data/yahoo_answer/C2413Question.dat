There is only one other person on earth with you.  She is a girl under eighteen.   Would you consider it illegal to hook up with her s-xually?  And would you?

20090205133647AAozguY	Arts & Humanities;Performing Arts	Violin Sanitizing...help please!!!!!!!!!?	Hi everybody,    I dont know if you may think this is a weird question but, I have a problem.... my music teacher is nice, but it is a guy who sweats a LOT, and every time he grabs my violin to tune it up (because, sadly, I still dont know how to do it myself), he gives it back to me with the chin rest totally  wet from sweat....Im sorry but I cant help it to go thinking eeeeeeeeeeeew!....and since I dont wanna offend him I try to chitchat to give it time to dry out... then I start playing...    But, doing that,  Im not only wasting valuable time chitchating but also the rest of the class Im upset, I cant focus on what Im playing or work on my bow technique... Im just disgusted at the fact that my chin is all over his sweat, Im actually counting the minutes for the class to end..... ;( .... after that happen, I go to wash my face with soap, but I cant wash the violin...     I dont even feel happy at practice time, when, since Im alone, I use a napkin between the chinrest and my face.... still annoying though... and I cant do that infront of my teacher, I know its not his fault he sweats that much... but if I was a teacher and had that problem... I would use a napkin while tuning the violin, so my student wouldnt have to put up with my sweat on her face for sixty minutes.....or keep thinking about it at all times she grabs her violin...    Is there anyway, to sanitize it without using alcohol?...without damaging it?... Im going to travel abroad for four months.... I dont wanna stop practicing just because I feel disgusted about the chinrest.... I know that this may sound too picky from me... but I cant help it, if you could only see how bad this guy sweats, and how sticky the chinrest feels......... eeew... it is giving me the goosebumps right about now....... please help!!!

20090205140219AAWiOAq	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	PLEASE tell me what you think!  it's very short, i promise!?	i've asked this twice and only gotten a few answers.  could you give me your opinion of this?  i'll try and answer your questions, but i'm still working on the character      I think of myself as living in a box. I'm in the middle, as curled up as I can be. I surround my box with thick walls of steel and iron. As impenetrable as I can make it. Insults usually just bounce off, and rarely do they make a chip in my walls. Only the worst seep through.   When I'm alone in bed at night I'm most vulnerable. That's when the memories overflow. They seep through and then destroy my walls. When it all comes crashing down all I'm left with is the reality of what has been said to me.   It is on those rare nights that I cry myself to sleep. How do they not know? Could they possibly not care about the damage they have done? When nothing but my soft scared self is left, do they still claim me to be the monster they knew in the light of day?   I most sincerely hope not. I'm alone at night, my walls are down, and every word you said to me brings a thousand tears.

No the truth is I'm a model, a high fashion model, and all day long I pose for magazines and catalogs. I have long shiny hair and I wear makeup - lots of makeup- and everywhere I go people ask me for my autograph. Then I get a starring role in a movie. Yes, and all day long I'll be taking pictures for National Geographic . Yes ! Yes ! All day I'll be taking pictures of lions and tigers. But then suddenly the elephants stampede our Heep. " Oh, help, help the elephants are stampeding!" So we hop into our dugout canoes- yeah, yeah- and paddle down the Amazon through the crocodiles and the mean-eating piranhas, but suddenly the boat flips over and the crocodiles and piranhas come closer and closer.      Actually I'm NOT a movie star at all! It is my long lost cousin who looks a lot like me in the dim jungle light. I, on the other hand , am a doctor , the best plastic surgeon north or south of the equator. Maybe I'll be a motorcycle rider, or an... astronaut, blasting off to explore other universes, colonize other worlds, off to, off to.. THE KITCHEN.

20090205135350AAU94Xu	Arts & Humanities;Performing Arts	DiMarzio Tone Zone or Bare Knuckle Pickups VHII Humbucker?	I bought an old Fender Squier Showmaster guitar  (same as pictured here:  http://www.guitarampkeyboard.com/en/1043...  ) and thought it'd be a fun project to modify it and make it worthy of use on stage or even the studio.      I've been looking at these 2 humbuckers for the bridge as I really want that 80s hair metal sound. The bare knuckles pick up:  http://www.bareknucklepickups.co.uk/shop...  has had rave reviews plus it has a gold cover which I think looks great, however many legends use the Tone Zone; Dweezil Zappa, Paul Gilbert, Rob Balducci, Vinnie Moore, so there's some endorsement for them.      I'm pretty much looking for something that really screams distorted, but the cleans are still clean. I don't mind too much about keeping the natural sound of the guitar cause to be honest I doubt there's a lot there anyway.      I'm currently running through a Boss GE7 in to a Cornford Hellcat head and an Orange PPC212 speaker cab. Through my effects loop is a cheap Behringer OD400 that leads in to a Seymour Duncan Lava Box for distortion. The guitar in question is a H/S/S set up and I will be adding 10 gauge RotoSound strings      I am open to other pickup suggestions since the chances of me finding someone who's tried both these pick ups is unlikely.      Cheers for the help guys   Matt

20090205140813AAJU0Nb	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Is this written in the first person?	I'm writing a story in the first person and just want to know if this is all in the first person.       Here's the piece, it won't make sense because i've taken it from the middle of the chapter. I might post the rest later:       As we walk out of the lunch hall Chris and Luke, burst out laughing and walk ahead as I link arms with Rose-May. “So,” I say as we stroll behind them, “are you going to open it?”    “Yeah, course I will.” Smirking she adds, “I’ll just wait until we get home, you know just in case there is some bomb inside or something.” We both dissolve into laughter as the bell goes signalling the end of lunch and run up to catch Luke and Chris as they go into our English class.       What do you think? Does anyone know any tips on how to stay writing in the first person instead of going onto the second person or something by accident?

20090205150853AALKGuL	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Is my story good so far?	I woke up with a sudden jolt. I got upright, and got out of bed. I opened my door to get a glass of water.    "AAHHH!" I sat up, and I knew, I wasnt dreaming anymore. Suddenly, someone grabbed my door handle. I was petrified. What if its the guy in my dreams? I thought, No its not, its not. My head was under the covers, my eyes peering, before the door opened.   "You okay, son." Thank god, it was just my dad.   "Yeah, bad dream. It looked like that guy who got arrested, for that murder five years ago." I am very mature for a 13 year old, sometimes i get in trouple, everyone does.   "Okay, try and go back to bed." My dad said when he went back to his bedroom, leaving my door wide open, for anyone to come in. I hated it when he left it open. I didnt go back to bed(even if it was three i the morning), I was to scared, i didnt want that guy in my dream again. I turned my T.V. on and my DVD player, and put in "Jumper". It was my favorite movie. I went downstairs to grab my drink, and was on the look out for anyone in my house. When i walked over to the mirror, i got frighted. I only saw my reflection, i got scared because it didnt look like me. My dirty blond hair was a mess, all in knots and what not. My freckles were there all along my cheeks, and my nose. My blue eyes, had bags under them. And my shark tooth necklace was around my hand, my shirt was on backwards, and my pants were fine. I grabbed my drink and went back up the flight of staires, and sat down at my desk, in my room. I pulled out a piece of paper, and a pencil, and started to drawing my dream.            Im only a begginer, so i dont know that much.

20090205143308AAOYU0Z	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	What do you think of my story so far?	The story is called Different. I really like writing and I really need some opnions can you help? Heres the story below:   Chapter 1: AUSTRALIA!!!       I walked though the subway toward the stairs. I always had to ride the subway to get to school. I ran up the stairs to get away from the stench of the subway. Or should I say metro since its in Paris. Paris was very love`ly except for the metro. I walked down the street toward the school breathing in the fresh air. I loved Paris. The air smelt of fresh bread baking and the sky was clear. My school was close to the Eiffel tower, so after school I always went to the tower and looked over Paris. I hadn't been here long, but I still loved it. My dad's bussiness traveled around the world and my mother and I went with it. I love my dad, but I hate moving so much. I was so disracted in my thoughts and memories that I tripped on a crack in the sidewalk. I didn't feel the cool concrete like Paris has. No I felt the burning hot concrete of a place I remembered, but didn't know quite well. I stood up quickly away from the burning hot ground. This was not Paris anymore. I looked around. Where was I? I turned around looking in all directions for some sign of where I was. I picked up my books that I had dropped when I fell and walked on. I finally came to a street sign. Below the address of the street was the name Australia. AUSTRALIA! How could I be in Australia! I had lived here for only a week, but I still knew it. I was very confused and my head hurt from the fall. I sat down in some shade to cool down and think. I crossed my arms on my knees and put my head down. What was I going to do. My cell phone didn't work here and I didn't have any money. I sat there thinking in dismay. I didn't hear foot steps untill I was tapped on the head by the person. I looked up to see a familiar face staring down at me.      "James?" I asked in shock. The boy looked at me for a sec and then smiled.    "I thought that was you Eva," James replied and held out his hand to help me up off the ground.     "Hey guys!" James yelled across the street, "look who I found!" I giggled. The rest of James's friends ran over. I knew all of them from the week I stayed there. There was Jenny, Andrew, and Luke. Jenny had long straight hair with blonde strike like mine and hazel eye like me as well. Jenny and I looked alot alike. Except for our names. Andrew was a little bit nerdy. He had messy brown hair, and wore glasses and he had green eyes. Luke was a little different from the group. He had black hair and blue eyes. He never talked, but the group liked him. James had blonde hair and brown eyes. The group was mixed up and different from other kids, but I liked them. They had even picked out a name for there group. They called themselfs the Jets. I don't know why they called themselfs this, but they just did. I liked it though.    "What are you doing here!" Jenny exclaimed embrassing me in a hug.     "I don't know," I replied confused. They all look at me with worried eyes.    "So I guess you coming to school with us?" Andrew asked.     "Yea," I said, "I guess so." We walked toward Red Rock Jr. high. The school the Jets went to. I had gone here for a little while until we moved. I loved Australia, but man was it hot here. I took off the jacket and tied it around my waist. Jenny and I talked for a while caughting up on what we both had done latly. We Told each other about school, our family, boys, and other stuff.  What i didn't notice was that the Jets had made a border around me. Jenny on my left, James on my right, Luke in front and Andrew behind. I could see the school ahead of us now. The school was painted with the same color of the Red Rock. We walked down the street with many and gaps between it.      "Hello Jets," came a creepy voice from a dark passage ways we were passing. All the Jets took guard and stood in front of me. I had no idea what was going on and why they were guarding me.     "What do you want Jay?" James hissed putting his arms out for more protection in front of me.    "You know what I want fool," Jay cackled, "hand over the girl now!" The Jets took Fighting stances. What did this guy want from me. The boy stepped out of the dark passage way. He didn't look like a boy though. He was half boy half mutant dog it looked like. His human half looked normal, but with shreaded clothing around it and bruses. The other half was a dog that looked mutated. The skin was blueish green and the fur was not in the best shape. I gasped stepping back a bit at the sight.     "Your not getting Eva," Jenny exclaimed stepping toward me.      "Who says you'll stop me," Jay said as he leaped at the Jets. Jenny grabbed my arm and her and I ran as James held Jay off. I stared back at the fight. James was throwing orange balls at Jay. What were the oranges balls and where did they come from. It didn't hold Jay off for long. He takled James knocking him out. Jay looked at me with fire burning eyes.     "Run faster,"

"There are a lot of murders and kidnappings in a little town in the middle of nowhere, and a well respected cop comes down to try and find the killer, but then the local police find that the well respected cop is the killer, and they arrest him. But, there are still more disappearances, and it turns out that the cop they arrested was blackmailed into killing the people, because he was about to find the actual killer, so the killer kidnapped his family to make the cop do whatever he wanted, and then the hunt begins to find the killer before anything worse happens."      This story was originally a monster story, and that the police were hunting down a monster, but they just thought they were hunting a person. Tell me what version you think is better, or if you think they are both crap... be honest. And I'm having trouble coming up with a name for the town, so if you could give me some ideas that would be great.

20090205133518AA0FabW	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	What is the cost of there being no right or wrong?	recently, i've been having discussions with my partner, and usually they end up in arguments. this is mainly because she takes the stance that no one can be right or wrong. my mindset is that right and wrong exist (there's a right way to see an argument and a wrong way to see an argument) and that it allows for a prevailing idea in which each can expound upon. her argument is similar but that the right and wrong do not exist.      i understand the benefit of there being no right or wrong in a relationship, but i feel to say so would be giving up something be it power, creativity, or whatever. so, my question to you is, what is the cost of there being no right or wrong?

A Poison Tree      I was angry with my friend:   I told my wrath, my wrath did end.   I was angry with my foe:   I told it not, my wrath did grow.      And I water'd it in fears,   Night & morning with my tears;   And I sunned it with smiles,   And with soft deceitful wiles.      And it grew both day and night,   Till it bore an apple bright;   And my foe beheld it shine,   And he knew that it was mine,      And into my garden stole   When the night had veil'd the pole:   In the morning glad I see   My foe outstretch'd beneath the tree.      -- William Blake

20090205131550AAsMHwx	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	I have very few regrets. Do you purge your regret through words?	We hide behind stranded trees    forced to grow in the sand    we throw them gently at first    the dog with one eye and no tail    catches them and spits blood    we know    it should not be this way    but he wants to play    sometimes he does not see them coming    and they crash his face    they rip    his ears we throw bigger rocks    of sand    with little boy hands    we know we should stop    he is dying.       We cry when we are alone    and walking home    and dinner is quiet    the sauce like blood on the noodles    our hearts like rocks    in the sand.

Others walk away   He always stays    Understands    My loneliness    My Faults    My problems    He understands    My happiness, my *********   He is honest enough    To bring me back    Into myself      He gives me confidence   When I fell worthless   Brings an unique hope    To my life    That motivates me    Pushes me to move forward       Forever I know that   I have his faithful concern   He will take interest in me    Listen to silly tears   Silently comfort me    Sympathize with the    Minuscule problems I have       Instead of always giving advice,   Solutions, cures,   He shares my pain   He can be silent    With me in a moment    Of despair or confusion   He will stay with me    In my hour of grief    And bereavement   He can tolerate not    Knowing, not curing,   Not healing    But just listen to me    When I am powerless   It is true he may not be perfect,   But he is always    The perfect friend for me.            BE HONEST!   this is to my best friend :)   i wrote it for him but yea is it okay???

I do because Mack didn't really think that God could help him. If you haven't heard of it, here are the lyrics.    I found God on the corner of First and Amistad  where the west was all but one.  All alone,  smoking his last cigarette,  I said "where you been?"  He said, "ask anything."    Where were you  when everything was falling apart?  All my days,  spent by the telephone.  that never rang.  All i needed was a call  that never came.  The corner of First and Amistad...    Lost and insecure,  You found me, you found me  Lying on the floor,  surrounded, surrounded.  Why'd you have to wait?  Where were you? Where were you?  just a little late...  You found me, you found me    In the end,  everyone ends up alone.  Losing her,  the only one who's ever known  who i am, who im not, who i wanna be.  The way to know  how long she will be next to me...  (This could be talking about Missy)      Lost and insecure,  You found me, you found me.  Lying on the floor,  surround me, surround me.  why'd you have to wait?  Where were you? Where were you?  Just a little late,  You found me, you found me.    Early morning,  city breaks.  I've been calling  for years and years and years and years.  You never left me no messages;  you never send me no letters;  you got some kind of nerve  taking all of our love.    Lost and insecure,  You found me, you found me  Lying on the floor,  Where were you? Where were you?    Lost and insecure,  You found me, you found me.  lying on the floor,  surround me, surround me.  Why'd you have to wait?  Were were you? Where were you?  Just a little late,  you found me, you found me.    Why'd you have to wait,  To find me?  To find me?

My mouth gone dry my thirst unwise    Has left me craving, tears my eyes   Yearning thirst for; “A tiny sip?”    With my tongue, lick my lower lip   Appetite I cannot disguise      Thirst for fluid all shyness flies   As my eyes now beseech the skies   A warm tear from my eye does slip   Warm and salty      This mockery I analyze    This indiscretion, pending sighs    My thirst for thighs, I freely strip   And drink the juices now that drip   From imposition and disguise   Warm and salty

20090205145640AAnURtW	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	A Poem...to feast your eyes upon...maybe?	Hey...I just had an operation on my mouth to take out my wisdom teeth...they had to take out jaw bone aswell so be kind to my writing!      Also I am usually in Rock and Pop but decided to take a break from there....some trolls are annoying over there!      Hopefully some of my peeps from over there see this :)      I stood over the balcony that overlooked the city,   I didn't look down cause I wasn't man enough to jump   Although I know I should but I don't have the guts,   I was thinking to myself that maybe I've had enough.      Your eyes burn bright through the hollow sky,   You were the one who always made me stand tall.   You grave has been dug and now it's a wishing well,   Cause I'm just sitting wishing for you to return.      A love is a paragraph from my favorite book,   But it's a shame cause I lost that book long ago.   So I'll keep scribbling down all my thoughts on my walls,   Cause when I'm high I can read them all.      Your heart was a machine that never stopped loving,   But the Cancer ate away everything that you were.   Skin is nothing but a suit for the weak,   I wish I was a snake so I could shed it.      Mother forgive me cause I keep sinning,   But I guess it's ok cause I am a sinner.   So when I stand up again I just hope you know,   It's because I'm trying to let you know      that I'm doing it for you            thanks.
20090205144826AAwO4Ef	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Wrote a poem at midnight.?	The break of dawn   When shadows come   Begin to weep   My silent sleep   Comes to a halt      They find a scent   And follow it   Until they reach   What I concealed   It lies there   Always unhealed      Against its will,    They bring it forth.   I know that now,   I must look at it again.   Remind myself of who I am.   Always the same despair,   Never a dream, only a nightmare.
20090205142746AAEM7Zl	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Do you like my poem /song  It is called my child .?	My Child..      Hellacious earth   Garden of Eden   Traps pitfalls   A wonderful surprise   Take time to grow   Breath easy   Don't you rush    You might miss the show      My Child open your eyes   think hard and fast   the good times they'll flow   heed the voices in your head   they might tell you    the same things I"ve said      Your runnin now   With vision clear   Risin above    This precarious world      Know right from wrong   Take it easy   Action reaction   Recoil before the blow      My child my child my child      words by Kathwha..
20090205140444AADvXjP	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Are there any poems about doves by famous authors?	I need them for an english assignment to go with Pablo Picasso's art of a dove. The poem doesn't need to be about Picasso, it just has to do with doves and peace, preferably well-known   Thanks!

20090205142535AAZopCu	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	A poem about Vegas. Takers?	Say, what right is there to refuse?  To hitch up even one lever.  Ignore the girlish obscenity  And circle my toe tentatively in  Pornographic waters.    Why, its inconvenient obedience!  The passive-aggressive, American  Genuine contention.  Between moral living and flickering  Market promise.    Oh, The ill-judged drama!  Rear me up, cater to my belittled  Human Frivolity.  Let me have you among the wisps  Of responsibility Ive left behind.    Scratch dollar signs in my eyes.  And for a weekend, for a queasy moment  Just let me                                                forget.     Deep fry my conscience, Vegas.  Allow me my Hamlet death!
