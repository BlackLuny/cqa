M2elwNrMaa	Apparently there's more evidence that Jesus lived than anyone else of that era, guess who told me that, some Christian fanatic when I was at primary school. I accept both the possibilities that God either does or doesn't exist, but if he does exist I still think most religions are messed up. I'd like to think he exists but there ain't any proof, so I'm stuck in a hole of un-decidedness.|`|cgb4WOnVaa	What amazes me is the number of people who believe in ghosts and aliens (and impossible government conspiracy theories) but do NOT believe in any kind of "higher power".

I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16 tells us that the Bible was "breathed out" by God.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1: 11-12 tells us that the gospel was a revelation from Jesus Christ himself, which was recorded by Jesus disciples and Paul.<br>  <br>  God himself chose the disciples and the people whom He knew were going to spread His word and write the Bible.<br>  <br>  The Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 4000 years. Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors. The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvation—Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist? Is He God? Why did He suffer on the Cross?<br>  2) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?<br>  <br>  Pasting a small part from the website.<br>  Visit the website to strengthen your faith in Jesus or to know more about Him.<br>  <br>  Jesus is God.<br>  <br>  1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus<br>  specifically.)<br>  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8<br>  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became<br>  flesh (John 1:1-14)<br>  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm<br>  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh<br>  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to<br>  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.<br>  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)<br>  8.

Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)<br>  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)<br>  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;<br>  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship<br>  is used in each place.)<br>  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John 8:58.<br>  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see<br>  Exodus 3:14.<br>  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).<br>  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).<br>  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).<br>  26.

When I was young (about 10 or 12) my childhood friends and I would go and search for them in the woods near  my house. Once,  when we were in a thicket of wild plums and the sun was setting. Suddenly, we heard whispers in languages we couldn't identify and saw monstrous creatures flitting in and out of the bushes, suddenly the whispers started speaking English, some telling us to leave, others telling us to come with them and play in the stream nearby. We continued on our way (being the idiot preteens we were) and the bushes kept moving in and out of our way, shaking and moving. The whispers gradually grew louder until they suddenly stopped. We looked around and there was evidence of a fire that had been recently smothered and was still smoking slightly.

Tragically, that's what happens with many people.<br>  <br>  The most important truth I can tell you is that God loves you and wants to forgive all your sins so you can be with Him forever in heaven. He loves you so much that He has done everything that is necessary to make your forgiveness possible. He did this by sending His only Son into the world to take away your sins by His death on the cross.<br>  <br>  Let me use an example to illustrate this. Suppose you owed the bank a very large sum of money—so large that you knew you could never repay it. But then suppose that one day a very wealthy friend came along and said, "I went to the bank and paid your debt, and now you don't owe them anything." What would you do? You'd have two choices: You could disbelieve him and go on worrying about the debt—or you could accept what he did and believe it.<br>  <br>  This is what Jesus Christ did for you! He paid the debt you owe God because of your sins—and now all you have to do is repent of your sins and believe it. Open your heart to Christ today, and thank Him for paying the debt you owed God for your sins. The Bible says, "In him we have ... the forgiveness of sins" (Ephesians 1:7). This is God's promise to you.|`|QYu8KrXTaa	Hi, Muslim, Christian whatever we are all sinners when we stand before the Holy God, I say wow is that all you have done wrong, I am Christian and your scriptures tell of Jesus miracles and reality. Real followers of Jesus(not the nominal Christian religion) believe He was sinless and allowed Himself to be crucified for all sin. We believe we must repent(be sorry and turn from sin as you are doing) and ask Him to forgive us. When we are true about this He redeems us from Satan and transfers His perfection to us. Now when God looks at us He doesn't see any of our sin as Jesus paid the death penalty for it. He only sees Jesus Christ perfection. Because Jesus is perfect we know we are accepted. Then we should worship Him, love Him, learn about Him and tell others what He has done for us. This is not being religious or changing religions it is being accepted and becoming a child of the Heavenly Father in His family. Not even the devil can get us now but he can give us a hard time. If you are seeking God at least read the New Testament to see the record of those who knew Him or lived at His time. That is more important than reading what I say. I learned this 40 years ago and accepted Him. God loves you and has done all this so you can become His child and then live with Him in heaven forever. nev r email available|`|YZv8Ub3Haa	Come on, you were seven.<br>  <br>  Give some money to charity and call it even.|`|tx4bRDrXaa	Of course.<a href="http://www.jw.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.jw.org/</a>

As a Gay guy yourself you recognize your impossibility to find out. Unfortunately it is the same for most of us. And it is possibly better like this, just imagine the hell it could for most of us if any homophobic guys could just find a pattern to immediately recognize any Gay guy. I chill at the thought. So the best you can do is to try and find out.<br>  I would try a gentle approach like for instance"Do you accept a compliment from another guy?" And then you can compliment him on his eyes or his sensual lips or whatever comes to your mind that may help you get a reaction. A normal straight guy would never react positively to such action. <br>  <br>  Success!|`|tZF64L7yaa	Theoretically you can't, but I will tell some methods below. First, you would have to tell the person that you think they are awesome and that you are interested in dating them and see what they say. You could also have a female friend ask the guy if he's gay or bi, or would consider it, or she could say that there is a hot guy that thinks he looks amazing and see how he responds. Even a close-minded redneck guy isn't going to get very aggressive if a cute girl asks him if he's gay or bi, because he won't see her as a threat. And if he is gay, then he also is fairly likely to chat with her comfortably, because a lot of gay guys have female friends, so that really is an option that might be safer for you if you are afraid to ask him directly. It can be scary, trying to find out someone's orientation, especially if you live in a town where people aren't very open to that. It's not being wimpy having someone ask for you, it's protecting yourself, and you will be surprised that often close friends are willing to help you out in that area. <br>  Now there are a couple of other things I have read that are probably controversial. PHYSICAL TRAITS. Studies showed that gay men's hair whorls were counterclockwise, and that testosterone increases ring finger length, revealing some women as being lesbian.  <br>  You might want to research the physical traits that scientists have associated with homosexuality. They have done quite a bit of research. Google keywords like homosexuality and finger length, homosexuality and hair whorls, homosexuality and physical traits, handedness, etc. There are many news articles. <br>   "Artsier" guys, and feminine women will also often part their hair on their right. Business people often part their hair on their left. Through my life, I noticed that gay men always dress better, always seem more intellgent, seem to have better jobs and more money (I'm serious!), and seem to be very well spoken. They are always very articulate and will often have very good handwriting, and though I've met gays with bad handwriting, men with very beautiful, large, curvy handwriting are often gay in my experience.  I've never ever met a straight man with perfect handwriting.  <br>  Go get a graphology book, (barnes and noble)... you can tell so much about someone from their handwriting. They will say in the book that you can't tell gender from handwriting...but I always can. It's NOT going to tell you if he's gay, but what the book will be useful for is descerning from his handwriting whether he is open minded, whether he is hiding something...whether he likes to be close or far from others...how sociable he is...if he is is a down to earth person, if he is imaginative or very sexual...if he is more likely to commit a crime, or if he is unstable or moodly...it will definitely provide some clues to his personality, and you may be able to figure out what kind of general response you would get from the individual. <br>  Other clues I've noticed is... I can completely tell from a photo if someone is gay. I was watching queer eye, and they had 4 straight dudes and a gay one, and the queer eye guys couldn't tell the difference, (they were trying to guess) but I could tell from a photo of the head! <br>  My theory is that maybe that it is viewable in the face. It's extremely subtle. The area I look at is nose, mouth and chin area, and the proportions of these. That is where I can see it. Start looking at gays, and tell me that you don't see something similar in their faces. They are often extremely beautiful, but there is something I can see. What we call gaydar may be the ability to observe extremely subtle hormonal differences?  Occasionally, I will see a straight man that has this face type, but it is rare, and I can only think of two ever, and these are those type of guys are often mistaken as being gay by others. lol. These facial cues occur regardless of ethnicity. It's hard to describe, I know it when I see it. It has to do with the facial proportions in the lip and chin area from the nose to the chin, perhaps in comparison with the nose and the rest of the face.  Only, I can't describe it, but start looking and you will train your eyes, and see what I'm talking about.|`|58eHufb3aa	I have a gay dar::::<br>  .If they look like their hiding something<br>  .If u talk about children & a wife, they dont really say much unless their a christian then they'd be overly excited<br>  .You talk about girls to them and they act differently then talking about guys(not sexual)<br>  .They look at your lips, and notings wrong wit ur lips|`|Npi7ZSyHaa	Ask him.

QrBReRQbaa	Good Vibration,<br>  <br>  The Church in the form of celibate men in collars teach to this day <br>  "Family Planning."  There are still couples out there that buy into this I mean practice this means of birth control.........I mean family planning.<br>  Your assumption that it puts fiscal burdens is right on and is means for control over especially women----barefoot and pregnant or a woman with many children is a distracted woman---one who will not question.|`|i6Mi8uWIaa	Nope. <br>  <br>  Of course, this is mostly because I'm a convert and the only Catholic in my family other than my husband. <br>  <br>  My father was raised Methodist by a mother was raised Anglican. My mother was raised Church of Christ by her parents, also both Church of Christ. <br>  <br>  That being said, the Catholic Church has never actually forced a large number of children on any couple. The actual teachings by the Church on this subject is that sex should be saved for marriage, and that whenever a couple comes together in the marital act, they should ALWAYS be open to the possibility of a new life, contraception being unnatural and against God's will.<br>  <br>  That being said, up until about fifty years ago, the condom was the only realistic form of contraception, and even it failed spectacularly. Not to mention, it was fairly uncomfortable, so who would WANT to use it? The condom, and other barrier methods, also remove a strong sense of intimacy. <br>  <br>  The fact that you live in a small town tips me off to another reason for multiple kids. I'm guessing it's a rural, farming community, yes? Lots of kids=more hands on the farm.<br>  <br>  Also, natural family planning was nothing more than the dangerously inaccurate rhythm method, back then. You know that old joke. What do you call users of the rythm method? Parents! <br>  <br>  This is because the rythm method is based on the myth that every woman has a 28 day cycle with ovulation on day 14. Today, we know much better that this is NOT the case. True NFP, which uses fertility awareness, is more complex than the rythm method and is based on a woman reading her OWN signs and knowing what is, not what the textbook says it should be. But I digress.<br>  <br>  And there's always the reason that you have probably overlooked just trying to find a way to keep your anti-Catholic beliefs. Most likely, they WANTED the children. The Bible tells us, after all, that children are a blessing, and it really is true. And are you REALLY going to criticize a couple that wants children for having them?|`|tqQIcLb5aa	You were there and witnessed this? People knew how there bodies worked. No-one has 12 kids on accident. It was their choice if they did and it's none of your business. You've no say in how many kids I have and if you've say in how many kids my grandparents had. It's a bit of a stupid question if you think about it because a lot of the people your aiming it at would never have been born but for the encouragement of the Church.|`|FGcwxZz0aa	God's first commandment to mankind was to go fourth and multiply. Why is that statement not clear to  you? Most people when they get older have only one regret and that is that they should have had more children.

If you are going to ask a question like that, you should start with the question, Is a Boeing 767 capable of causing a skyscraper to collapse (refuting the "demolition theory"?  Based on an engineering perspective, yes, based on an material failure analysis by the American Society of Civil Engineers by Ayhan Irfanoglu and Christoph Hoffmann.  Based on a U of Berkely study by professor Astaneh-Asl, the skyscrapers construction "was so strange, and so many violations of practice and code were introduced" and simulation proved it could have collapsed due to the conditions.  So yes, planes could have taken it down.  But (and this is a big but), doesn't hide the fact that I can't find any legitimate evidence by the government (outside academic studies).  So don't make any theories without knowledge.  But then again, America has pulled off wars without evidence since anyone can remember.  Gulf of Tonkin?  LOL w/e.  Operation Northwoods?

I often use the phrase "spiritual but not religious" on social networking sites as I do believe in a God, although I don't necessarily accept your definition, or the definition of other people. I don't go to church, nor recognise any holy book(s) or groups as authoritative about non-physical aspects of life. But I do affirm a spiritual (non-physical) dimension to humans and life in general. This comes from many years of life experience rather than "finding God" or adopting a religion that takes my fancy. For many years I was an atheist and skeptic, and I consider myself too free-thinking to be constrained by only one set of religious/spiritual values chosen by one group of people.|`|cZ3h1dffaa	Generally to be spiritual signifies a belief in something beyond the mundane.  Things to do with the meanings and purpose of life, the world and our relation to these.<br>  <br>  For me it is simply an awareness of the connection we all have as living things.  The unity of life and the Universe itself.  It has nothing to do with spirits (Holy or otherwise), ghosts or the afterlife, although for some it will.<br>  <br>  I am a philosophical Taoist.

I'm constantly told, or described at school as being very "religious"; I can't stand being called "religious, because I don't "participate" in Christianity to please others or for my own gain. I do what I do because Jesus Christ, the King of this world, Saved ME and LOVES me!!! Jesus did that for EVERYONE!!! I LOVE to Glorify Him!! :) I have a relationship with my God; That's how I define Christianity: a relationship. Christianity is something more than "being religious". It's more than a set of rules done for self-gain. So, when referring to "religious acts", Christianity is not associated with it. Christianity is having a close, intimate relationship with the God of the Universe. So, don't cling to Christianity, or combine it with a something else, just so it suits you.

Christianity IS a religion, and there are many paths on the Christian path, just as there are many paths for the Pagan.  It is an umbrella term, but still basically normally implies that the person goes or belongs to some sect of Christianity.  If you consider yourself spiritual, but not religious, it usually means you follow a path of spirituality, not means the Holy Spirit of Christianity necessarily (although it can) but instead a non-corporeal, soul way geared toward understanding better the divine with yourself and others and the world at large.  You may do this through following Native American traditions, or Buddhist traditions or even Celtic Shamanistic traditions, etc.  I am not religious.  I do not follow a set religious creed.

wzM5WB8Xaa	I had the roommate from hell in university, so here goes my "wonderful" experience. <br>  <br>  1. If you have different cleaning styles, you will constantly be fighting about who needs to clean what.<br>  <br>  2. If one of you can't afford to spend as much as the other, it's really hard to split the cost on groceries, phone bills, cable, etc.<br>  <br>  3. Parties are NOT as fun when you are cleaning up after your roommates and her friends the next day.<br>  <br>  4. Sharing a bathroom when you both get up at the same time every morning sucks.<br>  <br>  5. It's hard to plan, say, an evening in with your boyfriend, especially if you know that your roommate is going to be there.<br>  <br>  6. If you get in a fight, you are stuck seeing each other every day.<br>  <br>  7. If s/he can't afford to pay bills or rent at any time, you will be stuck with the whole thing for the month.<br>  <br>  8. When you move out, if s/he doesn't help you clean up, you will need to clean the whole apartment to get your damage deposit back. Also, if s/he damages anything, you won't get your damage deposit back.<br>  <br>  9. You get stuck in your bedroom a lot if you need to study/write a paper because s/he might be watching tv, etc.<br>  <br>  Just so you know, I have had good roommates. Make sure that if you are going to move in with someone, you talk about everything from bills to chores to noise with them before you make a decision.|`|qDl5Gegbaa	You have to know if you can trust them: your food, personal things, friends they will be having over, respect to your things and sharing things.<br>  Will they invite disrespectful people over?<br>  Could be loud when you are studying?<br>  Use your things without asking?<br>  I had a roommate once who seemed like the nicest guy, turns out he has a massive drinking problem and pee'd himself when he would passout...and I mean thee nicest guy, you honestly never know!<br>  Stealing things from you?|`|ZtK5XZEYaa	because you should values your "me time". Having your own space is essential to your well being... just how much "me time" you need will depend if you can handle having a roommate or not. I know that i don't want one because i like my privacy. <br>  <br>  besides, if you value your friendship, you might want to reassess that friendship and think about yalls compatibility...and how much the friendship means to you. Yall could get sick of each other and then the friendship is over...of course, it may become bonded stronger because yall spend so much time together. <br>  <br>  Your just going to ask yourself, "is this what i am willing to sacrifice?" and that will give you a damn good conclusion.|`|Vqqc54oNaa	You'd be better off having a roommate as an acquaintance rather than a good buddy.

But, no matter what your intentions are, shaytan will always whisper more and more desires for you and the opposite sex. Even when you may think he/she are just talking to you as a friend, they may be thinking something else.<br>  <br>  for example, there was a story of a beautiful girl who had very protective brothers. The 2 brothers needed to go out for a little while to run some errands, so they asked the nearest imam to watch over their sister until they were gone. He was a VERY VERY religious imam who had good intentions at first, but later those intentions turned wrong thanks to shaytan's third party assistance. The first day he just came by her door to see if she was alright. A few days later, shaytan probably whispered something alone the lines of " she hasnt seen anyone in a long time. maybe you should go talk to her". the imam started getting to know that beautiful girl, UNTIL he went far enough to rape her until she got pregnant. the imam was afraid of what the two brothers would say, so he killed that pregnant girl and buried her.|`|8FbJjRpwaa	Well me I just feel weird as I have been raised to avoid that 'scenario' not that I have anything against them, just not in habit.

When under trial, let no one say: “I am being tried by God.” For with evil things God cannot be tried nor does he himself try anyone. But each one is tried by being drawn out and enticed by his own desire. Then the desire, when it has become fertile, gives birth to sin; in turn, sin, when it has been accomplished, brings forth death. <br>  ---------------------<br>  <br>  Stupid people keep saying that Jehovah God created Satan evil. He did not.<br>  --------------------<br>  Origin<br>  <br>  The Scriptures indicate that the creature known as Satan did not always have that name. Rather, this descriptive name was given to him because of his taking a course of opposition and resistance to God. The name he had before this is not given. God is the only Creator, and ‘his activity is perfect,’ with no injustice or unrighteousness. (Deuteronomy 32:4) Therefore, the one becoming Satan was, when created, a perfect, righteous creature of God. He is a spirit person, for he appeared in heaven in the presence of God. (Job chaps 1, 2; Revelation 12:9) Jesus Christ said of him: “That one was a manslayer when he began, and he did not stand fast in the truth, because truth is not in him.” (John 8:44; 1Jo 3:8) Jesus here shows that Satan was once in the truth, but forsook it. Beginning with his first overt act in turning Adam and Eve away from God, he was a manslayer, for he thereby brought about the death of Adam and Eve, which, in turn, brought sin and death to their offspring. (Romans 5:12) Throughout the Scriptures the qualities and actions attributed to him could be attributed only to a person, not to an abstract principle of evil. It is clear that the Jews, and Jesus and his disciples, knew that Satan existed as a person.<br>  <br>  So, from a righteous, perfect start, this spirit person deviated into sin and degradation. The process bringing this about is described by James when he writes: “Each one is tried by being drawn out and enticed by his own desire. Then the desire, when it has become fertile, gives birth to sin; in turn, sin, when it has been accomplished, brings forth death.” (James 1:14, 15) In the course that Satan took, there seems to be, in some respects, a parallel with that of the king of Tyre as described in Ezekiel 28:11-19.—See PERFECTION (The first sinner and the king of Tyre).<br>  <br>  The Scriptural account, therefore, makes it plain that it was Satan who spoke through the medium of a serpent, seducing Eve into disobedience to God’s command. In turn, Eve induced Adam to take the same rebellious course. (Genesis 3:1-7; 2 Corinthians 11:3) As a consequence of Satan’s use of the serpent, the Bible gives Satan the title “Serpent,” which came to signify “deceiver”; he also became “the Tempter” (Matthew 4:3) and a liar, “the father of the lie.” (John 8:44; Revelation 12:9)<br>  ----------------------<br>  <br>  Did God you make stupid people, STUPID? No. You have your own free will, your own choices to make just like Satan did. HE CHOSE to do evil... God did not make us as robots.<br>  <br>  Accurate knowledge leads to everlasting life.

Just love everyone.|`|AA10249608	That was not magic,it was the power of God.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	If you are going to make a Christian point let the Christians speak for themselves, okay. <br>  <br>  Catholic theology defines MAGIC as the art of performing actions beyond the power of man with the aid of powers other than the Divine, and condemns it and any attempt at it as a grievous sin against the virtue of religion, because all magical performances, if undertaken seriously, are based on the expectation of interference by demons or lost souls. Even if undertaken out of curiosity the performance of a magical ceremony is sinful as it either proves a lack of faith or is a vain superstition. The Catholic Church admits in principle the possibility of interference in the course of nature by spirits other than God, whether good or evil, but never without God's permission.<br>  <br>  SO your question is meaningless.|`|caea98f7ed2871cd6caf9a1f351fc5ddaa	God split the river not moses,its called a miracle ,the other kind of magic is not done by God but the devil,i know what you're thinking ,but if the other kind was good why would God warn against it and even impose the death penalty on the israelites if they strayed and practiced it,the answer simply is that the nations around the israelites were not worshippin g the true God but the devil.ask jws about this the next time they're round|`|AA10988107	Mose proves the difference in the power of God and the power of Satan and the power of witchcraft with media angels or demons, as does the bible all the way through.

"Magic" is the power of Satan, which must be summoned. Moses didn't part the Red Sea - God did! That was God's power, which is far greater than Satan's, and it is not something that is "summoned". God does it Himself of His own Free Will. God's ability to create suns, moons, stars, planets and you and I is NOT "magic"!|`|CjRfJbncaa	Jehovah [God] now said to Moses: “Why do you keep crying out to me? Speak to the sons of Israel that they should break camp.  As for you, lift up your rod and stretch your hand out over the sea and split it apart, that the sons of Israel may go through the midst of the sea on dry land." --Exodus 14:15,16<br>  <br>  When a business owner tells an employee to make purchases for the company he owns, the purchases are actually made by & belong to the owner, not the employee...<br>  <br>  Similarly, when God told Moses to lift his rod & stretch his hand out over the sea, the action that took place was not Moses' doing, but Jehovah God's.  Even IF Moses was given the power by God, in order to be able to do so, it would still be by God's power that he did it, not his own, & most certainly not Satans'.<br>  <br>  Satan is *not* the source of energy, Jehovah God *is*.<br>  <a href="http://watchtower.org/e/20021015/article_01.htm" rel="nofollow">http://watchtower.org/e/20021015/article...</a><br>  <br>  When a person employs help from Satan or his demon followers to be able to do something, this then is *magic*. <a href="http://watchtower.org/e/20020122a/article_01.htm" rel="nofollow">http://watchtower.org/e/20020122a/articl...</a> <br>  <br>  Moses did *No Such Thing*.  <br>  In fact, he had actually 'cried out to' Jehovah God for aid, not Satan.|`|wuPTBIIuaa	first of all i agree with presumption or at least im  thinking the same thing. <br>  <br>  sorcery and witchcrafts are fundamentally a sin! because it is rebellion against god and is asociated with fornication and whoredoms. magic undermines the family and righteousness and destroys entire nations.  thats what the bible says. <br>  <br>  however specifically when Moses did those plagues and miracles of nature, let me explain!<br>  <br>  IT was NOT Moses that had the power to do them! while the knowledge to do them was given to men, probably from fallen angels, the power and intelligence to overcome them, was God ! <br>  <br>  if no one practiced the secret combinations there would be no need for God to undo them, this is righteousness. <br>  <br>  this is also the dillema !

I don't think that people try to be nasty and most have no idea that they are perceived that way.  Maybe she has serious issues that she's dealing with at home.  Perhaps she's mourning a loved one.  She could be upset about a child's drug addiction or maybe she has financial or marital issues.  This doesn't mean that she's not responsible for her behavior.  It simply means that there's probably much under the surface that people don't know about.<br>  <br>  As far as people of any particular religion not being nasty, that's impossible.  If she's religious, she believes in a particular deity and theology.  She probably has religious ideals but like most people, she will never completely live up to those ideals.<br>  <br>  I'm a very religious person yet there is no doubt in my mind that there are times that people could accurately describe me as nasty.

I like women and men and sometimes am more attracted to one or the other.  Have you been with a girl at all?  Or recently?  If not maybe you are feeling this way because you haven't yet acted on it and you really want to.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't obsess over this and I certainly wouldn't let other peoples opinions bother me, in case that worries you, if it doesn't thats great.  Unfortunately I am guessing you'll get some answers from the christian right, or some closed minded jerks about you being evil or sick or some such crap.  Ignore them they have no clue.  They bug me too, I'm basically a political conservative, but I'm also fairly liberal on social things.  I encourage you to consider my outlook on life, which is live and let live, be good to other people.  I get a laugh out of the "christians", who judge and condemn us to hell.  That's such a christian attitude, right?     LOL ......     Such hypocrites.  I'm of that type of faith, but I know my god isn't like that so I don't sweat those people, I hope you don't either.  <br>  <br>  Sorry about my soapbox there, but I had to vent a little, cause I see those type of folks regularly answering questions here with their rude, mean words.  <br>  <br>  Also the best explanation of human sexuality I've ever seen is this.  Our sexuality is like a 1-10 scale.  On one end is totally gay, on the other end is totally straight.  Very few people are totally at one end or the other, most of us fall somewhere in between.  During our lives we might move back and forth on the scale depending on circumstances and our desires.  When I saw that explanation I was like wow, that really makes a lot of sense.  So who knows where you are right now, and who knows if/when you'll move on the scale?<br>  <br>  In any case girl, I wish you the best and hope you find good people of whatever sex to be with.  kisses...|`|q04FEh5Aaa	Nature  or God which ever you prefer made women more naturally caring and loving than the male. Think prehistoric times, often male hunters could be gone for weeks leaving pregnant  females alone or with young children. God made women to exist alone and care for one another. Caress, hug, cuddle, to keep warm and love (in a caring way) with one another. Therefore it is natural for females to be bi and eventually to be a need for each others affection.<br>  My opinion but I have read lots about The Science of Man, ie. anthropology. The species would have never made it to now without this natural ability.|`|538992972827b8e8c44a4613d644527daa	Hey , <br>  i am the same way. i say im bi but i find myself looking more so at the ladies than anything. so i like to say that i am a bisexual lesbian.. :) but im just picking when i say that i am.so its just kind of like a guy really hasn't gotten you to look at them lately..so your not looking at them either.. :) that's my answer..i really hope this helps you.. :)|`|GGjjtHmHaa	well, i think that you might be gay. that's what it sounds like, but i really think that's for you to decide. only you know what's really in your heart.|`|ze4Gt1araa	I believe your lesbian and it isn't a crime I went through this stage too so don't worry just be happy with who you like best and don't worry about the rest :)|`|7uNASlURaa	I am the same way.

Meaning, you are drawn to a specific person regardless of their equipment and most of the times it happens to be women.  I've had a number of lesbian and gay friends since college, including my almost sister in law and two different female roommates, and I'd say if you're not sure then don't focus so much on figuring it out.

And they know it. They just don't want to go there, they're in deep denial.<br>  <br>  As you note, the response to questions about physics, regarding the collapse of the WT buildings, are either references to Popular Mechanics (whose theories even the government has now said are wrong), or personal abuse.<br>  <br>  It seems that they feel that talking tin foil hats, or kool aid, somehow strengthens their arguement.<br>  <br>  <br>  So many questions with no answers, just a simple one, that could easily be resolved:<br>  "Why no clear video of what hit the Pentagon?"<br>  The answer can only be that the government don't want us to see one, <br>  for they must certainly exist, or have existed.|`|b0c58cc0b655a543b52a5ab7c8f62835aa	Obviously it was a big fvck up of the defence of America and America ended paying the price by seeing great loss of life happen as nothing could be done.|`|iuoB7pf0aa	9/11 WAS without a doubt an inside job.

Some dialogue facilitator overhears it and counters, "That's just a stereotype! Women are just as attracted to the opposite sex as men are!"

I wouldn't recommend taking ANY advice from the message above about Stalin, Marx, T.A.T.U songs, or food - that may give them the idea that you're strange or considering them to be idiots.

When you meet them it would show a great amount of respect to start singing the T.A.T.U song "all the things she said." It may be about lesbians, but the song raised Russia's revenue and saved the whole country from bankruptancy.<br>  <br>  Also through out the dinner make sure to make Russian puns such as "quit Stalin" "There is a Marx on the table" They will appreciate the gesture.<br>  <br>  Since they are Russian, you are likley to be served black pudding, bear liver and some sort of weird vegetables. Try not to grimace too much, just grin and bare it. Hopefully they should have some sort of dog u can secretly feed your dinner to. If not say something like "look over there" then throw your dinner out the window. Russians often tell each other to look at things, so this will not be at all suspicous. <br>  <br>  Also remember to bring a gift. Russians really like mini umbrella's or turkish delights, since these are the only things not avaliable in their country. A T.A.T.U album would also be acceptable.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!!! :OOOOO

6mVpfmR6aa	First learn not to type in caps.  I used to do that and got fired from my job.  <br>  <br>  Second judging from your answers, you probably should have defined Chav.  <br>  <br>  Here is what I found:  <br>  <br>  The stereotypical image of a chav is a white aggressive teen or young adult, of working class background, who wears branded sports and casual clothing, who often fights and engages in petty criminality, and is often assumed to be unemployed or in a low paid job<br>  <br>  You might develop your vocabulary and curtail using slang if you want to stop people from calling you a Chav.  But probably, you will still face some of this criticism no matter what you do.  When you lose some of the slang, people will find other things to criticize about you.  <br>  <br>  You can not control that.  <br>  <br>  So, Don't Worry So Much About What Other People Think.|`|Y8rB9iuHaa	Perhaps it is because there is no point or value in anything you say?|`|3qLIRorjaa	It's probably because you're always shouting.|`|OR8hrr0aaa	Well use proper english, don't abbreviate and find where your caps lock button is and turn it off!|`|Tjr9aObNaa	Because people stereo type other people.

They are only like cattle -- Nay, they are even farther astray from the Path"  Surat: "Al-Furqan", Ayah: 44..<br>  <br>  Allah is just sufficient for us|`|Eeo6HPvuaa	Wow schools these days.|`|4oQyDdvdaa	wow|`|c1Mq2ejmaa	i go to gateway high|`|zgL6vMCiaa	salam...<br>  very interesting...jazaki LLAH khayran for sharing sis.<br>  <br>  there's so many tension between students ..its like they know that they cant be in the same place so everything that one person do, everyone will take it personally and explain it as what he's culture,, society  government explain it...<br>   i think ppl are free to wear/do what they like to...im with the idea that everyone could wear anything he/she like for presenting there cultural and there identity ..but if it will offend my religion than no....<br>  i think school should let them wear anything they want...but if it will offend islam(i know its racism) than they shouldn't let them at all.<br>  as for the t-shirt..i love being white/black..so ? let her/him love what she/he wants as long as there is no insult....<br>  everyone can say he's opinion as long as no one is insulted...as for the personal insult that ppl think of ..that's not even serious...they should get over it and move on with the idea that ppl can say there opinions.<br>  so scarfs are beautiful i even love them for there nice look..so ppl can dress what they want..hello! we used to think that ppl can say there opinions ..isn't that what american keep talking about? so how about letting others translating there identity in there own way...<br>  <br>  salam....nice subject|`|4aveC2aaaa	thats a new one<br>  <br>  *rolls eyes*<br>  <br>  can they get more pathetic?<br>  <br>  its like telling a hindu they cant wear that dot on their heads :P <br>  (no offense to hindus)|`|kkO87h0Xaa	"When a black female student wore a T-shirt reading "I (heart) being black" to school the day after the elections in November, several white students started a texting campaign to wear "I (heart) being white" shirts the next day."<br>  <br>  "Of the enrollment at the high school, Ms. Zanella said 1,079 students are white, 284 are black, 105 are Asian, 13 are Hispanic and 28 are multi-racial."<br>  <br>  --So stupid.

4mZd0Abnaa	You are possibly doing what you can at this point. You can't really determine someone's sexuality for them, unless they already know some what of what their sexuality is. <br>  <br>  Just tell her to go about her life and don't worry too much about her sexuality yet. When she's sure of her sexuality and want your input again, she should get it. At this point, you can tell her what you think she "might" be, but not definitely. You can only do so much for her, she has to come to realization of her own sexuality on her own terms.|`|ssV4NDUVaa	You did that right thing to be neutral.

I have not much that I can suggest but to tell her that some people don't find there love until really late in life.  <br>  <br>  But when it comes to being nonsexual, it could be that she just hasn't found the right combination of body types to actually attract her. I don't think that she really needs to worry about it, I have such a strange combination of body features that actually make me attracted to a person, that I am not really attracted to many people.<br>  <br>  I hope that this helped you, if I kind of hit the question, but you need more just email me!|`|7aK81hsbaa	just be gentle with her, lizzy and don't say a word to her sister. you're  doing the best you can and that's all you can do. hugs|`|P2kL3apWaa	You handled the situation well.

She texts me all the time, but doesn't like talking on the phone. She messages me on Facebook at least once or twice a week.

14zk9dldaa	There are several books you can access at the library. Or if you don't have the time, check out the discriptions on books online, which may give you some ideas.<br>  <br>  I took a public speaking class in college. I was taught the first thing you should do is what they call an "ice breaker". You need to say or do something to GET THEIR ATTENTION! <br>  <br>  That ice breaker can make or break the whole speech. Kind of like a first impression. They will assess if they like you and if your topic is interesting enough to keep listening. <br>  <br>  Example? I was doing a speech on bulimia. So, I got up there in front of the class, was completly quiet until I knew they were all waiting on me to say something. I looked em dead in the eyes, picked up the trash can and acted like I was puking! I got an A! The class hung on my every word and congatuated me after class! I got their attention! (I was really scared though LOL).<br>  <br>  Make eye contact with some friendly faces. Make sure your voice carries. (This can be a problem if you don't).<br>  You dont want people in the back wispering "I can't hear her". Excuse me speech lady can you speak up?<br>  This will break your whole timing. So speak up!<br>  <br>  Gear your speech toward your audience. Explain things that they may be unaware of or not understand. Don't assume they know what you are talking about.<br>  <br>  You might want to draw up a questionaire to pass out (keep it short), rating you on your speech. Asking questions like was this information helpful and so on.<br>  Good luck!|`|4z1gryIGaa	One thing I used to do look for a familiar face, or object. and then speak as naturally as if you were talking to your best friend. The butterflies in your stomach will begin to fade as you get more confidence in yourself. Trust me the audience is not as aware as you think when you mess up a word/phrase/action. So don't beat yourself up. You'll do great, and practice makes perfect.

And that makes me very, very happy.|`|DZCFD0p2aa	The tremble because the loud firecrackers scare them, or maybe they are afraid of fire (hell)!!!|`|d742c2cef54941ca559ae7ca690b1fd8aa	Well various views are expressed over this<br>  <br>  I respect Jesus as well as Lord Vishnu very much but wud like to share views as expressed by various people here<br>  <br>  1) Jesus is in touch with true God and Lord Vishnu in fact does not exist at all. Believing this many Hindus are diverted towards Christianity. Usually Hindu diverted Christians are troubled by financial crisis and they get some financial safety bcos of which they change their religion. Some might also miraculously get experiences where they get freed from diseases,inability to talk etc. . I believe bcos Jesus had Reiki powers when he was alive so now as a demi-god after 2000 years his capacities might have extended miraculously as compared to that Jesus who existed 2000 years before. Jesus is given the power to forgive just like Goddess Ganga is given the power to forgive sins of anyone who comes to her. Only Great Sins can not be washed by Ganga which includes 1) betraying a friend 2) betraying nation or perhaps something else i dont exactly remember the 2nd one. But Jesus can forgive absolutely anyone. Other heavenly powers might it be Hindu demi gods , or Muslim peers or any other power are supposed to respect this dominance by Jesus. I dont doubt this.Still some Christians feel tremble at Diwali. Why? The view in 2nd point will explain that. Although it is a view expressed by normal Hindu and it is not applicable for Christians at higher level who were not diverted from Hinduism. But all Hindus diverted ...no shud say translated yes translated into Christianity (just as words are translated) feel tremble...may be minor or major...its bcos of the 2nd point expressed below<br>  <br>  2) As per other view - Your own mother gives you simple food and aunty living in neighbourhood gives you sweets. So you abandon your own mother and start living with the neighbourhood aunty . After 5 hours or 1 or 2 days you feel the fear and you also feel sorry bcos the only reason you left your mother is one.....and that is Good Food or fear from hunger just as some Hindus afraid of obstacles surrender Christianity. It is possible that the real mother might enter the house of the neighbourhood aunt at any moment and might whip his own child just bcos he was so weak that could not stand hunger and gave up his religion...His religion was to eat whatever his or her mother offers him or her and die or perish if not given by his own mother but never make her feel sorry by surrendering neighbouring aunt and eating her food thereby giving pain to her own mother.<br>  <br>  Nevertheless Lord Vishnu loves JESUS equally and he is not going to act like a mother entering the neighbouring aunt's house and getting her child back but still if someday if any of his most & dearmost devotee diverses this can happen but history about Lord Vishnu indicates that he demands respect and even Goddess Laxmi has no complete hold on Him. So looking to his nature we can believe that he might not bother. So is He not as great as a mother....no..... He has a mother's heart but he loves Jesus equally just as he loves Hindus and he sees no attack on his property if Hindus get diverted to Christianity.Again we feel he should bother so History makes it clear that he bothers bcos if he was not bothered about Hindus...or Good and Religious Hindus then by the great attacks by Muslims on India the Hinduism might had vanished just like Egyptian or Maya culture.But Hinduism still exists.<br>  <br>  Whatever this feeling within Hindu diverted Chrisitians make them tremble bcos deep down they feel they have left their own mother's house into neighbourhood aunty's house just bcos she provided good food, good shelter etc. This is the deep down feeling that is responsible for such trembles within them.<br>  <br>  Again Jesus is very honourable deity and also Lord Vishnu....I just tried to share my view point over various people's belief.

FOzN3xwzaa	Tell her this:  <br>  <br>  Jesus loves you so very much!  :)  Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation. <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what! <br>  <br>  Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead.

Of course it's never too late, but the ball has always been in her court.  Just as you determine where you go when you die, the story doesn't change for her no matter how much you love her.  You could have possibly paid more attention to this matter before she was dying, but we wouldn't be human if we didn't skip over all the important stuff to enjoy life the way we want to and not the way God wants us to.

Regards to your aunt, we all have relatives who are lost spiritually...truly an unfortunate thing.|`|3QGv54ynaa	Well, when her time comes she may be scared or worried about what will happen or if it will hurt, ect. Just talk to her about the angels and heaven and explain to her that she will be okay and safe. That way she feels comfortable and not attacked. I think that when people pass on, God gives them a chance to decide what they believe and make their choice to come with him or not. Just pray for her that she has a clear mind and makes the best choice for herself. Don't ask her questions about her beliefs that may push her away or make her feel bad or confrontational about not being "right" with God.|`|AA10747877	Ask her if she is prepared to meet the Lord God. I have found that to be good to get people to at least think about it.

VpR6qvb5aa	I stayed in Negril for a week or so once. We spent lots of time on the beach- there was a free bus that picked us up and brought us to Margaritaville. We swam, snorkeled, and rode in glass bottom boats.<br>  The most fun we had was "renting" a local driver. For $100 american, he drove us around all day. We went for a boat trip on the Black River, swimming at YS falls, and a bunch of other stuff. We drank lots of Red Stripe, ate lots of jerk chicken, drank Blue Mtn coffee each morning, and live music at the Mariner. The beaches are topless, which you may enjoy.<br>  Some advice:<br>  - Bring lots of money<br>  - If you decide to smoke some "ganja" use it sparingly, as it is very strong. Also illegal, so be discreet.<br>  - If you explore on foot, stay out of the residential areas. I got threatened a couple of times (only ting you gonna find dere mon is me guns), and somebody else sicked their dogs on me- lots of them. However there is very little violence in the resort areas.<br>  - If anybody offers you "tea" or "mushrooms" or "mushroom tea", DO NOT accept it. It could very well ruin your trip.<br>  Have fun, I envy you.|`|ixHwF4apaa	have a nice trip|`|OXleDYVQaa	Hi, no offense to anyone from Jamaica, but happy to hear you aren't going to Kingston.

It's okay to be confused, but don't rush to label yourself, you shouldn't have to label yourself.  If you find yourself attracted to girls, you could explore that option to be sure.  Don't pressure yourself to figure out what sexual orientation you are.|`|dOGwA6Vjaa	You don't need a label to date a bi or lesbian woman.

Sturdier skeletons would be far better.|`|QYu8KrXTaa	Hi, no, so called vestigial organs have all been proves to be useful in some way even if it is once before birth and so there are not any.  God used a multitude of designs that work. He used similar designs on various creatures to fit them for their lifestyle. ornithorhynchus(platypus) is an example out of many. Car manufacturers do the same. They all use round wheels in all shapes and sizes because they work well. They all use some form of power supply but the variation in enormous. Different cylinders, fuels, direction, air/water cooled. Some extras are air con, turbo, etc. Wise manufacturers use a variety of good systems that work. This doesn't mean one car turned into another or eventually developed or lost air con. Without detail here it has been found all those bits have a purpose. There may be some they don't know about yet but that theory has been proved wrong along with recapitulation. nev r<br>  PS. Someone asked Why do we have a tail bone? It is a very important muscle anchorage. Damage it as I did and you'll know it is there. If the question is referring to before birth(recapitulation thoery) the embryo has exactly the same number ov vertabre as the adult. The mistake occured when Heackle(I think) saw the spine before the hips were formed and thought it was a tail. His embryo imabes showing all creatures to be the same in their very early stages were faked. Evolution has problems when examined by the truth. nev r|`|3EudCWEuaa	Those vestigial organs you mention in those particular creatures have now been found to serve a purpose for their normal life functions.

OQdPzl15aa	Wow, Jimmy Carter said that, huh?|`|QluBTwCvaa	Jimmy Carter gave that as an answer to the press because Jimmy Carter had read his Bible.  The LORD Jesus Christ spent much time convincing those who thought that they had no sin that they were indeed sinners. To technically avoid "fornication" and "adultery" by their technical laws added to the Truth of the Word of God, the Pharisees were in the habit of divorcing and remarrying wives until they had married and divorced  14 wives or more.  That is why Jesus also taught that to divorce for reason other than infidelity was sin.  The law of Moses only allowed for divorce for the protection of a woman from a man of hard heart who might otherwise starve her or leave her without shelter.  Jesus Christ taught that marriage was the only correct way of satisfying the physical desire for sex.  Those thinking that they were not sinners had a hard time calling themselves self righteous when faced with what Jesus Christ said was sin.Temptation is not sin. Giving into temptation and entertaining thoughts of lust is sin.  Jesus was trying to communicate that all are sinners in need of a righteousness beyond their own.  He was the last Adam (Romans 5) who was born without  a sin nature, having God as His Father, and therefore had a choice to sin or not.  He was not tempted to sin until He was a full grown man of 30 years and had the Spirit of God upon and in Him and His mind full of the Word of God with which He countered all the temptations of the devil.  He never sinned, but took our sin upon Himself to die in our stead.  He is our only escape from the commitment and penalty of sin.|`|PWankIUpaa	Actually Mr. Carter was quoting Jesus  and sex out side of Marriage is a sin . It is such a sin that God will take strong measures if a person continues to abuse His Law! <br>  <br>  The Holy and Inerrant Word of God the Holy Bible!|`|Rt4bJfVAaa	I have had a few bouts of that myself a time or two.

That IMO is the bigger picture.|`|y1KcxJ7Oaa	Your absolutely right.  If Jesus was really human then he should have been aroused by women on a regular basis.  33 years without sex would have been impossible without a little vasocongestion (blue balls).

There are a lot of trees and a lot of forests around here.  If you live in Iowa you'll know the fall weather and all weather in Iowa is unpredictable, but with that said when it's decent outside being outside in October is awesome!<br>  <br>  But I do love the spring as well, April (April 30th is my birthday), I love the green grass as well as the warming of the weather.|`|S4zNEAFJaa	I love October and November.

umEgRb7Vaa	He meant you should cleanse yourself inside and out.|`|ec3461a2ffbd06064e30c36f5e958792aa	its love thine enemies as you would want to be loved. means what ever they do to wrong you... forget about it and just send them love back. <br>  <br>  btw... my philosophy in life is:<br>  <br>  love everyone unconditionally<br>  like a person till the give you a reason not to<br>  but still love that person unconditionally!|`|KgCUpE5naa	I love my enemas, as well as my enemies, and pray for those who abuse me.<br>  <br>  That's what you're supposed to do, anyways.|`|uy1Nj6uJaa	Whatever flips your switch.|`|m9zviqlzaa	love thine enemies? he meant that whatever they do to you, try to love like you would love your own parents, or siblings. also ties into the Golden rule (Mathew 7:12) Do to others as you would have them do to you. if you would like to stop being enemies (I can't think of anyone who WANTS to be enemies), then you should love them. in turn, they will see should see that you aren't their enemy.<br>  many sunday school teachers use the acronym J.O.Y. Jesus, Others, You, to explain how you should treat everyone. your enemies fall into the Others category, so you are supposed to love them more then you love yourself. Love of oneself is called pride, and "pride comes before the fall".<br>  <br>  ps. I know the JOY thing is a little corny, but still relevant.|`|7mhRDbvsaa	he was drunk...so there was no meaning|`|u33x2hqzaa	Because you can't love when there is hurt and hatred in your heart.<br>  <br>  When you don't love your enemies you give them power to hurt or anger you.<br>  <br>  Enemies are usually scarred by disappointment in life and taking it out inappropriately.  Sometimes giving love in response to injury reminds them that they are part of the human family and brings out love in them. Then an enemy is gone and a friend is made.  Maybe that is charity in action, to remind them that they are still children of God, still loved and loveable?<br>  <br>  Only love heals but it takes great courage to love.
R5yG1nKiaa	You should discuss with her some time that you think she is a lesbian. I mean if she considers you her best friend, she should be comfortable with it. Tell her you would be more comfortable knowing if she was a lesbian. Tell her that you won't hate her for it, and that you totally accept gay/lesbian people, and the lives they lead. But also ask her that you feel she might have feelings for her... and that you are sorry but you just don't go that way. Just tell her, you enjoy just being friends.|`|AA10303320	If you are comfortable with the friendship fine. If you are hesitant simply ask her  outright. If yes simply tell her you are not that way and that you accept her for what she is but you are not AC/DC and she must accept it and no advances on her part.|`|qf769Z0zaa	Well you said she was from  england where it is legal to be gay. I honestly think she might like you but just get off the topic everytime she tries to talk to you about it. its like when you dont like a guy so you ignor him when he talks to you|`|JUYjyP0xaa	Invite her over and when she gets there be like sorry but i have to talk to you i can't get it off my mind. then be like I'm thinking of asking ______ out. (a boy) and go from there.|`|SRdFXgpTaa	i think she might be a lesbian<br>  she probably likes you<br>  you should just tell her that your her friend and that is it|`|cGqcxt07aa	i think you should just start talking about it and bring it up or u could talk to someone that u could trust|`|TpKpQ50jaa	make her read this entire question and then she will kill herself. I'm going to jump out the window..|`|6ZtoLkfPaa	i think maybe if you waited a while to see if she takes any notice to guys, like if she said that one was cute or something like that. then maybe if nothing changes then just sit down with her privately one day and just talk bout it...maybe say some people had suspicions and you promised them you would check them out or something. if she says that she is a lesbian then say that you wont tell anyone if she doesnt want you to or something, just be really supportive of her.|`|eo8ZdB4uaa	Honestly what is it with heterosexuals and assuming all homosexuals like them? Egotistical much? Also I have extreme disdain for the term "alternate lifestyle" because it makes it sound like something that can be chosen. As for letting her know you're okay with the possibility of her being a lesbian, there are many things you can do. One option is bringing it up non-chalantly like saying "I saw this commercial the other day for ellen/the l word and it made me wonder why people can be so homophobic, even though I'm not gay I'm okay with gay people blah blah...". Just don't randomly tell her "I'm okay with you being gay" because if she's not I bet she'll be pissed, if she is though she will tell you when she's ready.|`|CM1dfztQaa	When she's ready to tell you, she will. If she brings it up again, be honest with her about your feelings but let her know, at that time, that you aren't into girls. If she's bringing it up, it's because she's trying to talk about it. Just be a good friend, it sounds like she could use one.|`|pYn2L2DHaa	If you're straight and she's gay, and you're totally OK with that -- tell her that someone's being gay doesn't present a problem for you and you're totally OK with it.<br>  <br>  I have straight friends who have told me they're totally OK with my being gay, and very supportive of me and my relationship with my partner -- and I can tell you as a gay man that those are friends worth having!|`|wqchA8B7aa	Maybe, kind of sounds like it, but then again, maybe not. I wouldn't worry about it - she stills the same person either way. If she asks you out and you don't swing that way, just tell her. Otherwise, just let it lie.|`|AA11286455	The next time she says something that hints that she's a lesbian (and you're in a private place), just come out and ask her.  Wait for her reply.  <br>  <br>  Then tell her what you've told us and let her know that you won't violate her privacy or her trust by telling anyone else.|`|CHCPnvksaa	You need to be open and honest with her. Maybe bring up the fact that she was questioning her own sexuality a while back and ask if she came to any conclusions about it.Tell her that if she is a lesbian, it doesn't change the fact that you love her has a friend, and that you'll help support her when she's ready to come out, because I'm sure she's really confused. She won't be insulted by the fact that you're not a lesbian, she can't possibly expect you to be gay too. I have a lesbian friend, and we talk about our relationships like anyone else and she has nothing against me for liking men. I had a friend in high school who realized she was a lesbian, and she went to the school counselor for advice, and that really seemed to help her too. Maybe you could suggest that if she's not ready to open up to you.|`|tRFWQF2uaa	Not really any of your buisness<br>  but if you must <br>  just straight out ask her<br>  and by the way there is nothing to be 'supportive'of<br>  its opinons like that (although not intentionally meant to be harmful)<br>  that make it seem like homosexuality,bisexuality,pansexuality etc is different and needs to be accepted<br>  but theres nothing to accept<br>  its on the same level as being straight<br>  <br>  anyway its not my right or yours to put these assumptions on your friend<br>  shell come out when shes ready<br>  <br>  have a great day x|`|8jxoTBWIaa	Wow thats hard. I would just let her no softly that you are interested in guys. And ONLY guys. Or maybe you could just stop talking to her about guys so the subject wont get brought up as easily. <br>  <br>  Email me if want to talk more about it =]|`|le29yexraa	I think all you can do (unless you want to ask her directly, if you think she'd take it well) is sort of bring being open to alternative lifestyles into conversation if you get the chance.|`|2RWayH3Oaa	Why not start a conversation about it.  Ask her if she has been with a woman. You will be suprised of all the info that will follow.  Then you can tell her you are not into woman or whatever.|`|uF8RLL4laa	im not gonna read thet, but just let her be what she is...if u feel like experimenting theres nothing wrong with that either. at least that kinda fooling around wont get u preagnat|`|DZFoyOvyaa	just wait and til she is ready to say it and if she dose like you let her down gently|`|AXes50RBaa	tell her u like lesbian ppl but ur not 1|`|vvgmyX04aa	Actually you are expressing it well right now! When it comes up in conversation, just say you are into guys but you are totally cool with men and women who are bisexual or gay.<br>  <br>  I can see how if she is socially awkward and sensitive and likes you a lot that it would be scary for to come out. I wouldn't press it, just say how you feel and let her let you know whenever she feels comfortable.<br>  <br>  And yes, from your description it looks like she likes you. I'm sure you can imagine how easy it is to develop feelings for someone who is naturally affectionate and who you feel close to. But again just be the way you are now with her and it will be good.  :)<br>  <br>  <br>  p.s. Umm..just to give you a heads up.. A little over a year ago my friend had a heavy crush on me and we talked about it. I had a boyfriend and considered myself to be straight and I reassured her that it didn't bother me and she was a very dear friend no matter what.<br>  <br>  Short version, she's my wonderful girlfriend!  Just saying you never know :)|`|xc6iCPUQaa	You should just talk to her and tell her that you are very accepting and that no matter what she tells you you will be suportive and that if she ever wants to talk you are there for her. <br>  <br>  When she decideds to tell you about it just straight up tell her that you accept that she is that way but you are not that way and you are attraced to guys. <br>  <br>  BTW, I don't think she likes you as a girlfriend but I think that she was trying to hint to you that she might be bisexual. I also think that since she talked to you in the first place about questioning her sexual orientation that she will, eventaully when the time is right, tell you if she is bisexual or not.
GGX2s1S9aa	Wuh can be slang for "what".<br>  <br>  Wuh is just there to make it.......sound more "important". <br>  It's just added on. lmao.  Don't read too much into it.

The first website went on-line in 1991. On 30 April 1993, CERN announced that the World Wide Web would be free to anyone.

It did not exist! . <br>  <br>  At one time I was a Christian, I have studied the Christian Bible and have put much time and effort into researching it thoroughly in the original languages of Hebrew and Greek that it was written in with an OPEN MIND, it is full of mistranslations, misinterpretations, and contradictions, the NT is a man made book not divinely inspired and it is based on a false messiah it was put together by a bunch of men who wanted to start a new religion and keep it's followers in fear of burning in hell for all eternity.<br>   <br>  All of the messianic prophesies that are in the Torah/Tanach which would be what is called the OT in the Christian Bible have been manipulated and mistranslated to make them point to Jesus.<br>   <br>  You do not need to be a Christian to believe in God, although the Christians will tell you different, and you will not burn in hell for all eternity if you do not believe and/or accept the Jesus of the Christian Bible as your lord and savior, but again the Christians will also tell you different on that. God has said if you seek me with all your heart you shall find me, and I believe that with all my heart because I have found God, and I have never been more at peace, with no more fear of burning in hell for all eternity. <br>   <br>  Contrary to what you will be told by any Christian <br>  YOU CAN BE NON-CHRISTIAN AND STILL GET INTO HEAVEN.<br>   <br>  Christianity is the only religion that says if you don't accept their teaching and accept Jesus as your lord and savior your done for because Jesus is the only way, they are WRONG there are many paths to God not just one.<br>   <br>  Every other religion out there and every other person out there OTHER THAN a Christian following Christianity all believe that God will judge each and every person on what kind of life they led.

God does not lie. <br>   <br>  Well now don't you think that if Gods Messiah was supposed to suffer and die for the sins of mankind, and then have a second coming to finish what he didn't do the first time that God would have said something like this in his Holy Torah? <br>   <br>  The Messiah when he comes will be born from 2 human parents, he will be an ordinary person, and he will fulfill ALL the messianic prophesies in 1 life time, before he dies, and he will not be worshiped as God or the son of God.<br>   <br>  Isaiah 40:25) "To whom can you liken me that I should be his equal?" <br>   <br>  Isaiah 43:11) "I, only I, am God and there is no deliverer aside from me"<br>   <br>  Isaiah 45:5) "I am God and there is no other; other than me there is no God."<br>   <br>  Isaiah 45:21) There is no other god besides Me: there is no righteous god besides Me and no savior other than Me.<br>   <br>  Isaiah 45:22) Turn to Me and be saved all ends of the earth, for I am God and there is no other.<br>   <br>  God has never changed any of his laws. <br>  Gods Torah is forever.<br>   <br>  The are 23 many messianic prophecies, and in truth Jesus has not fulfilled any of them not even one, well maybe one he was Jewish after all, but they will be fulfilled when the Messiah comes, but he will not be Jesus, he will not be born of a virgin, he will have 2 human parents, he will fulfill all the messianic prophesies in one life time before he dies, and he will not have a second coming.<br>   <br>  Jesus is not God, the son of God or the messiah anymore than any of us are. <br>   <br>  Christians identify Jesus as being the Messiah and define him as God incarnated as a man, and believe that he died for the sins of humanity as a blood sacrifice. <br>   <br>  This means that one has to accept the idea that the death of Jesus can atone for another person's sins.<br>  The Christian idea of the Messiah also assumes that God would accept Jesus as a human sacrifice.<br>   <br>  God has condemmed human sacrafice.<br>   <br>  Jesus was a man and nothing more, his followers tacked the Christ on to Jesus, which for anyone with knowledge in ancient languages knows this is also wrong. The word Christ comes from the Greek word Cristos which means anoited, Jesus was never anoited in the proper manner the way all the Kings of Israel must be.<br>   <br>  The NT can not be believed, it is a man made book not divinely inspired which started a new man made religion called Christianity.<br>   <br>  God has provided a way for all mankind to be saved, and not by beliving in or worshiping a false god.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.noahide.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.noahide.org/</a><br>   <br>  <a href="http://www.noahide.com/7laws.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.noahide.com/7laws.htm</a><br>   <br>  <a href="http://www.simpletoremember.com/vitals/seven-laws-of-noah.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.simpletoremember.com/vitals/s...</a><br>  <br>  God will judge each and every person on what kind of life they led, and Jesus is not God.|`|LHcdLTOxaa	there's been accounts of the existence of Jesus, I don't see why you'd become more convinced there's indeed no God when there was already historical evidence that Jesus existed.

pbT0tJvqaa	Jesus was born in a small town. He never traveled over 200 miles away from the town he was born. He never attended an institute of higher learning, he never got married, never owned a home. He never visited a major city. When he was 30 he started preaching, three years later the religious leaders of his time turned against him and had him put to death. He never did anything that we would use to measure success by today's standards. <br>  Yet despite this, he is the most influential person in all of history. No king, no congress, no army or navy has had the influence over as many people as Jesus of Nazareth. It is by his name that millions pray, it is by his name that people curse. It is by his life that most of the world measures time. By his name have people set up governments. By his name millions of people feed the poor, clothe the naked, visit those in hospitals and prisons. It is for his name that buildings are constructed and people fellowship.

Any war would be done with after the firing of the first few shots.  Nuclear weapons prevents major nations from going to war with each other, especially over natural resources.  Over population doesn't contribute to war.  Neither do high prices of commodities and less wages.  Even in N. Korea develops nuclear capability, America has almost thirty thousand nuclear weapons, and both Japan and South Korea could have several hundred nuclear weapons in about six months (according to www.globalsecurity.org).  Terrorism won't contribute to a war between nations- or at least it isn't likely.  2012?  Come one.|`|rcPnnfmmaa	1. Curable, happens regularly.<br>  <br>  2.

An evil genius might not feed all of his slaves, but only an idiot feeds none of them.  You can predict the actions of an evil genius using logic.

Read the 45 Goals of Communists, here is part of it.<br>  <br>  10. Allow all Soviet satellites individual representation in the U.N.<br>   <br>  11. Promote the U.N. as the only hope for mankind. If its charter is rewritten, demand that it be set up as a one-world government with its own independent armed forces. (Some Communist leaders believe the world can be taken over as easily by the U.N. as by Moscow. Sometimes these two centers compete with each other as they are now doing in the Congo.)<br>   <br>  12. Resist any attempt to outlaw the Communist Party.<br>   <br>  13. Do away with all loyalty oaths.<br>   <br>  14. Continue giving Russia access to the U.S. Patent Office.<br>   <br>  15. Capture one or both of the political parties in the United States.<br>   <br>  16. Use technical decisions of the courts to weaken basic American institutions by claiming their activities violate civil rights.<br>   <br>  17. Get control of the schools. Use them as transmission belts for socialism and current Communist propaganda. Soften the curriculum. Get control of teachers' associations. Put the party line in textbooks.<br>   <br>  18. Gain control of all student newspapers.<br>   <br>  19. Use student riots to foment public protests against programs or organizations which are under Communist attack.<br>   <br>  20. Infiltrate the press. Get control of book-review assignments, editorial writing, policy-making positions.<br>   <br>  21. Gain control of key positions in radio, TV, and motion pictures.<br>   <br>  22. Continue discrediting American culture by degrading all forms of artistic expression. An American Communist cell was told to "eliminate all good sculpture from parks and buildings, substitute shapeless, awkward and meaningless forms."<br>   <br>  23. Control art critics and directors of art museums. "Our plan is to promote ugliness, repulsive, meaningless art."<br>   <br>  24. Eliminate all laws governing obscenity by calling them "censorship" and a violation of free speech and free press.<br>   <br>  25. Break down cultural standards of morality by promoting pornography and obscenity in books, magazines, motion pictures, radio, and TV.<br>   <br>  26. Present homosexuality, degeneracy and promiscuity as "normal, natural, healthy."<br>   <br>  27. Infiltrate the churches and replace revealed religion with "social" religion. Discredit the Bible and emphasize the need for intellectual maturity, which does not need a "religious crutch."<br>   <br>  28. Eliminate prayer or any phase of religious expression in the schools on the ground that it violates the principle of "separation of church and state."|`|a6f5efb2cbade02a525b433574402dc8aa	1.

It makes no mention of sexual fantasies.<br>  <br>  <br>  2) But Sexologists say it is essential for enhanced libido and to enrich sex especially between partners married since 10 years.

A right from wrong that transcends any personal opinion that you may have read.<br>  <br>  Look here John 17:14-16 (King James Version) how Christians are to be considered when compared against that which is worldly!<br>  <br>   14I have given them thy word; and the world hath hated them, because __they are not of the world__, even as I am not of the world. <br>  <br>   15I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest __keep them from the evil__. <br>  <br>   16__They are not of the world__, even as I am not of the world.<br>  <br>  <br>  BOTTOM LINE: Science has been consistently wrong for all of recorded history (Sun circles the Earth, Flat Earth, four elements, etc.) it keeps on improving, each new revelation ousting the last established teaching.

The bible says a lot. A lot of things that all those people wouldn't want to admit and hopefully they wouldn't want to actually put into practice. Did you know that in the bible says that if a woman is not a virgin when she gets married her husband can kill her? And that parents should kill disobedient children? There are lots of statements like that that would make any reasonable thinking person's stomach turn. If thats god's word then I'm a pineapple. In fact most of the people who claim to follow god's word have never actually read the bible themselves. Pieces are picked out and regurgitated onto them at church and bashed into their heads in their homes by parents who had the same thing done to them. THAT has nothing to do with what the topic is at hand. There are two terms that are being confused with each other here. "Sexologists" say that fantasies are an important tool to be used to help keep a couples sex life fresh and exciting. That's not the same as say having a fantasy about your next door neighbors daughter. What they mean is dressing up like a robber or space aliens or having a threesome. Do the world a favor. Don't rely on brainwashing to answer the questions you have about life and love and whatever else. THINK for yourself, DO for yourself. The answers are not hard to find, but there are is a lot of interference.<br>  And as for the guy who answered right before me, get a life, seriously. You think that christianity is so absolute and great and right, but you forget that it was the catholic church that killed people for saying that the earth wasn't the center of the universe.

oKoABzNtaa	Hope Valentine's Day Sends Very Honest Friends?
AA12006309	Dedication.  I didn't want the same things to happen to me over and over, so I set goals for myself and made promises to myself to make sure history didn't repeat.  It's working great so far!
ApBWR4oBaa	I don't know what that is but...<br>  Darayga-> probably "dare ga" (who)<br>  musta-> probably "mashita" (not a word in itself, but the ending of polite past form)|`|e60fXsLUaa	i think something that has to do with honesty??
FhWOpW4waa	Best way to find out would, as with most things, be their website:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/</a>|`|DaH0rOghaa	I dont know but its gonna be hard<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6tlw-oPDBM" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6tlw-oPD...</a>|`|9b6a51f72b4ce44cd195fb24fccdaf8caa	That sounds interesting. I think my son might have broke the record last winter for most sweat pants and sweatshirts worn at the same time *_*. He looked extremely funny and stiff when he went out in the snow . Then when he took everything off just as it was on him I walked in his room and it looked like a man laying there! ~_~!

Apparently this can only be done with main post offices and you must have the precise address. It would be held for a maximum of 30 days. <a href="http://www.lonelyplanet.com/thorntree/thread.jspa?threadID=1592155&tstart=0" rel="nofollow">http://www.lonelyplanet.com/thorntree/th...</a>|`|Y6odIQgJaa	You can have it send it to you c/o General Delivery @ the post office in your town.  <br>  <br>  Bring ID with you to pick it up!|`|QWdNgsSLaa	Maybe you can have it sent certified mail so that a paper is sent to your house and then you would have to go to the post office to sign for it.|`|4z1gryIGaa	I wouldn't think so. You may have to have a p.o.box(post office box). To have a package delivered there. Otherwise the post office will deliver it to your home address.
3gVPMjURaa	now you are not say hello to me....are you angry of me?(stop talking)|`|Ghjaezi5aa	You don't say hi to me anymore :S are we on bad terms?|`|FLLoVSlMaa	You don't say Hi to me anymore , Are we offended ?
e01b865c0771c47a4d22d3a9ad54d2efaa	well..I know for a fact black girls don't really like white girls. I have never been out with a black guy but I live in a black area and they are always rude so I could just imangine if you were seeing a white girl they would throw a fit and plus they are racist. To bad everybody can't be like you, just open to who the person is instead of color.|`|zFTDPfOpaa	because they feel like they are less of a woman if a black male chooses a white female over his own race. they feel jealous and insecure.|`|3r252UIRaa	I don't care if you actually fall in love with a White woman because you liked her. But if you actively seek out our girls, that does piss me off.|`|eoQoCcz5aa	A simple little word to your question and that word is Cretin . Say it sometime it rolls off the tongue in a wonderful way . Kindest regards , cheerio .|`|da4zS4AOaa	Because they think you are a sellout. If you prefer white women then fine..but it won't be fine around other people's views. Why aren't they complain of the musicians that they listen to....don't they hook up with like every race!|`|gfGtx1m6aa	haha white women My Favorites,But thats just my opinion.|`|e9gXZsKxaa	There Haters, son!|`|6yD5k9Azaa	they were jealous of the white girls|`|33d13c8fa116273403e0f7b580bfabe3aa	It's a jealous reflex. Like saying "what? we're not good enough for you?" They see it as a threat because traditionally they have had first dibs on men of color. It's the exact same way if a white man chooses to date a black woman. Teasing will occur because the white women are jealous that they no longer have the market cornered on that white male. Vice versa the black males will tease the black girl for dating a white male for the same reason. I'm sure any white girl you date will get teased by white males much in the same way that you are teased. It is something you will just have to rise above.|`|F3KkB4GWaa	Because they automatically assume that you like them BECAUSE they're white. Personally I could care less about a person's race if I like the person. Those people are just uncomfortable with the concept of interracial dating and can only express it by joking about it because they don't want to seem racist.|`|vMthRkrsaa	I like white women too!!!   and black ones, yellow ones, red ones, green ones, brown ones, pink ones, <br>  <br>  Just tell them to shut up. They are all pink inside.|`|JEpLjnGhaa	The human race is a tanned rainbow...<br>  <br>  And they are doing that because they are ignorant.<br>  People that judge by how many pigmants are in your skin arn't worth this 1 in 60 billion chance at life.|`|p6XPhIxnaa	its ok some people just hate when they feel threatened, like it used to get on my nerves when white guys go out with mexican girls Im just like ewww why? They grow up to be ugly!|`|h1Pxqz5vaa	No hun. It's deeper than "just liking women who happen to be white".|`|NQoyNWaUaa	Some people have to make fun of people to feel better about themselves.|`|19fZOxiIaa	jelousy
CDsLUCXUaa	nice|`|1EHmi2Y1aa	I am very disappointed in the Discovery Channel. They are taking human feelings as opposed to facts and scientific theory or experiments.  Now, don't forget they now add "pretty" pictures to scare it's viewers but again it's based on biased "subjects"! .<br>  <br>  Fake I say. Very fake! A big disappointment for a science channel|`|wPD3BGEHaa	Yes, I saw it a few years ago..scared the devil out of me..|`|0PVmzXc0aa	sorry I started seeing it but I couldnt continue it was way 2 scary|`|unrdcGkpaa	a haunting is soo addicted!

I hope you cheer up and live and I <br>  Hope they don't drug you up on a bunch of drugs.|`|mF0L5jMNaa	Just fake it for awhile.  Pretend you are acting out the life you want and soon it will be yours.  Change jobs (might be tough right now, but start getting ready for your new job).  At 17 and 18 your children are acting as though they don't need anyone, but in a few years when they are adults they will drift back into your life and will want your company.<br>  <br>  Join something, anything.  Just get out and be with people.  Weight watchers, sewing classes, a church group ... anything, even if it's not terribly interesting ... just get out of the house.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|rStrA0d8aa	Don't hurt yourself. You  have a reason to live on this earth. Do you believe in God. If so you are not alone. I been in your shoes before hang in there. Thank about your kids. THey may be getting older, but theylove the person who has brougth them. I ask yourself to get help and recieve God's blessings. I am praying for you.
Gf5nMPJXaa	Because if Muslims were always trying to convert you you'd complain about it too.  This is a forum to talk ABOUT religion and spirituality.  Since religion is doing its best to force superstition into law and bring everybody under the thumb of repressive dogma, where else should we discuss that?  Cats?|`|WX1b747Iaa	Out of sheer bloody-mindedness.|`|3qqvFEsHaa	I know that going into this, which is why I dont get upset if a Christian preaches to me here<br>  <br>  But in real life it is annoying<br>  I live in a conservative area, and have had people stop me and start talking to me about my "destination" and if I have accepted Christ.<br>  <br>  People have come to my door<br>  <br>  This is perfectly ok to tell someone about your religion, on a religion forum<br>  But not in real life, I usually dont have time|`|uxfacsgmaa	Because people ask us questions :). <br>  <br>  Also, the plural of 'atheist' is 'atheists'. Note the 's'.|`|yHfsHp6naa	Why aren't you in the mythology section?|`|M4WIWMgBaa	For the 8 millionth time: For laughs, to learn, and it's not a xtian board.|`|QC94lBXOaa	I come for the laughs and really, I can't thank the christians enough.|`|AA11135281	Answering for myself, I enjoy learning from my Christian neighbors, as well as my neopagan, Buddhist, Muslim, and Taoist neighbors.  I don't expect them to believe as I do; in fact, that's half the reason for coming here to R&S, to encounter views unlike my own.  I like to learn.  And I share views from my Humanist perspective to help them understand how their Humanist neighbors see things (or at least how this one does).|`|uFAoq4idaa	Let's discuss religion here openly and intelligently. Anyway Yahoo had provided us R & S with terms and conditions that we have to abide. So please everybody stay as courteous, kind and sweet as you are. I love you all.|`|ppRPMfRkaa	Amazingly the world, the universe, and even Yahoo Answers R&S doesn't revolve around Christians.<br>  <br>  I'm here to discuss ideas and thoughts which concern religion and spirituality.|`|2rJwgk40aa	*sighs* does no one use the search bar anymore?<br>  Im here because,while i dont enjoy having people try to force anyhting on me,I do enjoy discussing it.I enjoy leanring.Now,please stop asking this freakin question:)|`|hYzfzu9yaa	Because this isn't a place for Christians to convert people. Duh.|`|nqcnylFpaa	it amuses us (insert evil laugh here)|`|to8CkYp2aa	I don't mind the attempts on R&S. Being accosted at home or on my way to work is entirely different.|`|HFHNxQ0vaa	i am a Christian and very deep in my faith and it pisses me off when other's speak of how holy they are. No one's perfect worship yourself in your head because i don't want to hear it. i respect all religions including Aetheists and not trying to convert anyone because that's what Jesus would do!|`|355JLlcLaa	I used to be a Christian, so I know something about the Christ of faith, as well as having an interest in theories about the Jesus of history.<br>  <br>  I'm also interested in religions in general, mythology, folklore and related matters. And I've had that interest since I was a child.<br>  <br>  Taking an interest in these things also helps me to understand my fellow humans more. And it's also important to know about those powerful few who use their religious faith as a tool to persecute others (the infamous Proposition 8 in California springs to mind).|`|b0f24d67ec4d38818e50b7ee63133822aa	I wasn't aware this was a "conversion" site.  I had been led to believe this was where one could ask questions of people who had opinions on the subject and expect answers.<br>  <br>  If you only want Christians to answer your questions, why not try a Christians only website?|`|angPpFY7aa	Because this isn't the "<insert religious cult here> freaks only" section. Anyone can come on here and discuss religion and/or spirituality.|`|1jXBVGdcaa	A word in the wise: "Atheists" not "Atheist".<br>  <br>  You wouldn't say "Question for Christian?" would you?|`|VJN6Bvloaa	1. You are trying to convert us to the "lawd".<br>  2. Because we can.|`|AA12320776	I believe in God, but his question wasn't directed for me...let whomever believe in whatever they want ..remember Free Will!|`|gGd3v3M5aa	Because there are other religions than christianity. <br>  (Did you know that?)<br>  And I like discussing and talking about this stuff.|`|rcPnnfmmaa	We find you entertaining.

The song is completely tailor made for the recipient, it is HOT!!!!!! Everything was original and one of a kind. That was the theme. Personalized gifts are always better, they come from the heart. Anyone can go to the mall and pick up a sale item or a CD, make it count. Good Luck!!!!
bxeiEZW5aa	I saw that Letterman show, it was really sad to watch. Why is that boy going to retire from acting?|`|b0f0f231555e5da9d455a8890388f3cbaa	Sorry, not a Letterman fan.<br>  Nor a late night talk show fan at all.|`|a4LWildhaa	No, it's the reason I never have watched him. He's not funny and his writers aren't very good. He cannot improvise. Jay Leno was a terrific replacement for Carson. Leno is excellent  as he can improvise. He also is a good moderator if you've ever seen his tours of his own auto museum. Very interesting guy.|`|XEbrGfZuaa	My husband and I can't stand him now. He's not funny, and maybe<br>  he never was. He doesn't seem as smart as he'd like his audience<br>  to believe, judging from conversations with guests. And he looks<br>  and dresses so geeky. I've noticed the white socks too. Maybe he<br>  thinks it's part of his 'image'. Maybe he's supposed to be a geek for<br>  fan appeal? It's time he stepped down. He's passe, if anyone is.<br>     We prefer Leno also. I'm glad to hear, he will have another show,<br>  earlier in the evenings. So far, I haven't seen an ad for it's begining<br>  though. As for Conan, he is so strange looking, he has no appeal<br>  and we don't think he's funny at all. How did he ever get his break to<br>  get his own show, I've wondered. And he's got such a big name, for<br>  a little man. I won't be watching either show in the evenings. And I'll<br>  be curious, as to how fast the ratings go down.|`|ozwLZwXeaa	Letterman's show has gone down hill these last few years. I am not sure why but it isn't the fun, guest filled show it used to be. I hate his white socks too. Maybe he has foot problems and can only wear white socks. Ha,ha|`|2R3iJnFPaa	It's just a recurring joke:  Letterman is obsessed with hair because he never had good hair and now he's losing it.|`|Dmaahsc3aa	You got me . . . I just hate his white socks !!!|`|HvZt7K5Qaa	Having a breakdown? He's just not funny. Never was. If he wasn't a WASP he would have never had a TV show to start with, just like Craig Kilborn. I don't understand how his show has even 1 viewer.|`|g0gMQUCVaa	My mom used to love the David Letterman show.  He just doesn't do it for me though...<br>  <br>  I like Jay Leno.  I was really mad when I heard they were replacing him with that red headed, unfunny guy.  What's his name?|`|ZW0JHvdraa	Everything has it's season, and I think for him it's time to move on.  I think after a certain point you simply "burn out' & the spark is gone.|`|8e7a94a0af2d078a41f902e73bf91f17aa	I don't watch him routinely.  Recently, all I've seen him make fun of is the impeached Illinois governor's hair.  He's made fun of his own hair for decades.|`|AAgX0SDcaa	and David Letterman of all people, he was never a hair model, was he?|`|80lWqRFiaa	I never cared for his show, maybe he is losing it.|`|1yxPfC0Jaa	His publicist knows what the people are talking about...so Dave gets dragged into it, LOL!|`|y4SUDnpaaa	I rarely watch Dave Letterman so I'm lost as to what man's hair he repetitively commented on. Would someone fill me in?

eb4e977a0cb9ce50b08bf74f0f3a0c61aa	Here is truth - read and understand. <br>  1. Vampires, defined as a humanoid being that MUST consume blood or energy to survive do not exist. Cut and paste time, as it is too much work to type this out over and over and I "recycle" my own answers instead of retyping them so here goes. A brief discussion of the human digestive system and then the probable vampire population given an exponential growth rate should explain why vampires are not possible. <br>  <br>  2. The human body is not designed to process large amounts of blood for nutrition. There is not enough protein, carbohydrates, and fats present in blood to maintain a complex creature such as Homo Sapiens or any theorized offshoot mutations. When a human ingests food it is first broken up into a bolus by chewing, then churned up in the stomach with digestive juices to form a mass called chyme. It then passes through the pylorus into the duodenum, part of the small intestine where it mixes with bile salts and secretions from the pancreas and liver which continue breaking it down on a molecular basis, mostly affecting fats at this point. The broken down nutrients pass through the wall of the intestines and into the bloodstream where they are carried to each cell or stored for later use. Indigestible bulk continues through the intestines, turning a dark brown from the bile. Water is absorbed from this mass in the large intestine depending on the needs of the body - a well-hydrated person will usually have a softer stool than a dehydrated person will. Water also enters the bloodstream, and this is what helps to maintain blood pressure. The pressure tends to balance itself in a healthy person because the bloodstream goes through a formation in the kidney called the Loop of Henle, where the narrowing blood vessel forces excess water and cellular waste such as urea out through the cellular wall into the kidneys, where it is excreted through the ureters into the bladder, and then out of the body via the urethral passageway.<br>  <br>  3. IMPORTANT - A person physically unable to process his own food for nutrition therefore also could not process blood - it's the same process. Ingested blood does not transmit directly to the veins anyway - it would be chemically broken down by the digestive system.<br>  <br>  4. Theoretical ingestion of blood to supply these nutrients would therefore have to occur at least once a day, and would require the ingestion of the entire blood supply which could not happen as the stomach is far too small to hold that much liquid volume. Hold up your clenched fist - under normal conditions your stomach is about that size. Furthermore, such a mass would be difficult to pass thru the intestines as it has no fibrous bulk, would create an intestinal impaction, causing massive vomiting from the large concentration of iron present, and any "real" vampire would have to eventually expel the waste, which would come out as a black, tarry, smelly goo, just as stool does when blood is present from a upper GI bleed. <br>  <br>  5. These humans that affect the whole "vampiric lifestyle" are NOT vampires. They are simply humans playing their own little game, in their own little fantasy world, usually pandering to their own little sexual fetish, which may or may not actually be sexual. I too, play my own little game, in the SCA, but mine is a game where the deeds that I do are determined by the strength of my arm and sword - I am a warrior, with just as much skill and ability as any warrior of ancient times. The difference is that I am claiming to be something physically possible: a warrior, and I prove it everytime I strap on my armor and walk onto a SCA battlefield. The so-called "vampires" are claiming to be something physically impossible: a walking corpse, and all they prove is that black Victorian clothing, a pair of false fangs, and a little makeup make for a good Halloween costume - it does not make you a vampire.<br>  <br>  6. Even if a vampire feeds once a week, and his victim also becomes a vampire, that is exponential growth, with four iterations a month. First iteration: One makes one, total two. Second iteration: Two make two, total four. Third iteration: Four make four, total eight. Fourth iteration: Eight make eight, total sixteen. 16 vampires at the end of one month, 256 at the end of the second month, 4096 by the end of the third month, 65,536 by the end of the fourth month, 1,048,476 at the end of the fifth, and 33,572,832 vampires at the end of half a year! By way of comparison, there are currently approximately 33 million people who have HIV/AIDS in the U.S. alone, and the disease is a world-wide epidemic. I see people every day in the hospital with AIDS, but never has there been one documented case of a vampire attack. Do the math - vampires are a mathematical impossibility. As for the idea that vampires existed "a long time ago" consider the estimated global population 5,000 years ago - using the above mathematical rationale, a single vampire could have taken over and converted every human on the globe in less than two years. This falls therefore, under the logic of Occam's Razor - which states that when you have removed every impossible answer, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth. Since there is no "vampiric plague" swarming the earth, the logical deduction is that they don't exist.<br>  <br>  7. Point of clarification about "vampire" bats: vampire is simply the name we have given them because they do drink blood, same as a flea, mosquito, leech, or spider. Are these creatures vampires? No. They are living creatures, not legendary monsters. They can subsist on blood because of their smaller size and proportionately larger stomach volume. Drinking blood does not make you a vampire anymore than eating raw meat makes you a werewolf, although it might make you a mosquito.<br>  <br>  8.The humans who profess to be vampires are victims of an all-encompassing self induced delusion. They are as human as you or I, regardless of their claims, and if they ingest HIV tainted blood they can most certainly contract the disease, esp. if they have any cuts, sores, or lesions in and or around their mouth. It is a very dangerous delusion to be laboring under. Note that there is absolutely no scientific or medical proof that these people derive any benefit at all from the ingestion of blood, and even worse are the so-called "psychic" vampires, because their delusion is one that they cannot substantiate with any concrete evidence at all.<br>  <br>  9. There is no "vampire" gene. People are not "born" as vampires. When a woman goes to the hospital for prenatal care there are many tests done on mother and child, even while still in the womb, to check for many things, including genetic anomalies that result in deformities and birth defects. If such a gene existed, in today's world with today's technology it would have been found - we have already completely sequenced the human genome. It would also have to follow Mendel's law of dominant/recessive gene theory. Again, the odds on that many "vampires" all escaping the notice of the medical/scientific community are so low as to be almost nonexistent. The idea that there is a global "vampire community" engaging in controlled breeding to keep the "bloodline pure" is delusional in the extreme.<br>  <br>  10. There is no "vampire virus" - as I have already pointed out, HIV is a virus, and look at how fast it has spread - virtually everyone knows someone with the affliction. According to the "vampire websites" there are "thousands" of vampires running around. If that was so then at least one of them has ended up in a hospital for bloodwork when they became pregnant, had a bloodborne infection, was injured in a car wreck, etc, etc, ad nauseum. The anomaly would have been detected and medical science would have isolated it, studied it, applied for research grants on it, published papers on it, and turned it into the talk of the medical and scientific community, as well as making its "discoverers" celebrities and rich beyond their dreams. A virus cannot alter your DNA in such a radical fashion without killing you.|`|96AQZUGyaa	No, I don't read Twilight.|`|8P6MmLv0aa	No they are not.|`|TaR6eXpcaa	its a metaphor<br>  there are vampires that suck your energy, you know, people that do bad, talk about troubles, and they suck energy.<br>  <br>  sort of vampires<br>  :)|`|fhnyfRTxaa	yes bc were real

Qc6MqcpWaa	Aw, that's always sad. My sympathies. <br>  <br>  My dog died last March around her 16th birthday and my 17th birthday. I got her for my 1st birthday gift, and I grew up with her. She was not the family pet, she was my baby; where I went, she went. For about two years before she died, she was deaf and blind, and I carried her everywhere, but she wasn't in pain until a few days before she was put to sleep. The night before I went to put her asleep, I cried endlessly with her in my arms because I knew I'd never see her again. Of course I'll always be upset about it, but I realize that she's no longer in pain, and it's a part of life. We all reach that end at some point, and she lived a long, good life.<br>  <br>  I got her cremated, and she's in a nice pet urn next to my bed alongside a ton of pictures of her, her collar, my teddy bear from when I was born that she chewed to death as a puppy, and sympathy cards from friends. <br>  <br>  Sorry for your loss.|`|gGd3v3M5aa	Naturally I'm sad, very sad, as I loved them.<br>  My dog died a couple years ago, and I guess you just have to remember<br>  That death is inevitable, and that it's natural and nothing can really be done about it :\<br>  <br>  I suppose you can still smile in knowing that (assuming you were a fantastic friend to the pet) that it lead a good life and if was suffering, it is no longer. <br>  <br>  You will get past the intense grieving, and try to just keep in mind the love you had for your pet.<br>  <br>  Sorry for what happened.<br>  I hope your days get better :)|`|waz8ONEEaa	don't the majority of christians (or is it only a few) say that animals have no souls, and therefor have no place in heaven. theoretically, using that line of thought, even christians have no comfort for losing a pet, because it will not be in heaven for them.<br>  <br>  perhaps pets go to purgatory?<br>  <br>  i normally bury the poor animal with a tombstone somewhere.<br>  luckily, i've moved a number of times during my life, else i'd have a cemetery by now..|`|e93659642a9147aad2a89d7b0a52ebddaa	i feel so bad for you! my dog died about 2 months ago and i have had such a hard time also. i try to tell myself that i will see him again but its the uncertainty and the wondering that makes me miss him so much, i feel like a sibling or something has died. good luck! you are in my thoughts.|`|Nxolwd5Baa	truth is we dont know if there is an afterlife, seems unlikely just now but we are only scratching the surface of whats actually going on and what reality is, so take some comfort that your little dog may be in some better place. I feel for you as my pet dog was sent to live on a farm in ohio when i was little and i missed him so much even then....|`|f522078ffdf8786fcab6f8023c6befbdaa	Same thing I do when a human friend or family member dies.

My condolences.|`|8qctM0B4aa	i look at photos, and it reminds me how much fun we had|`|i210xqkgaa	it depends on what kind of pet. if it's a fish we simply flush it down the toilet. if it's something small like a turtle or gerbil or cat we dig a grave, put in in a shoebox, bury it at the end of the yard, and then put a tombstone or some other type of memorial. if it's a dog or a cat that dies in the veterinary hospital, we tell them to cremate it and keep the ashes in an urn. we care a lot about our pets. i treat them like family, although i'm sad about their death i don't just go out and buy a new one immediately. let some time pass so you can move on, and then get a new pet when your not sad. that way you know you want a pet for a new companion, not just as a replacement to your dead comrade.|`|ojHFFpcBaa	Knowing that you can have them and enjoy them for only a short time makes them that much more precious...ditto family, friends, people in general.|`|1TYZDRUqaa	You'll get through it.  Two years ago, IJR's four legged companion of 18 years passed on, and IJR still misses the little guy.  It's never easy, but you get over it.|`|aPuUuWlLaa	Remember them fondly and how they enriched my life. Focus on the fact I was fortunate to have them in my life while I did rather then never at all. Be glad I was able to give them a good home and life. Some Christians I know don't believe animals have souls and go to heaven. But really feeling sad and missing them is a natural thing to go through and means you care. If it helps you can have some sort of good bye ritual or create a memento like a collage for an album or scrapbook which is something I have done that sort of like a funeral or memorial service helps to honor what they meant to you and acheive some closure.|`|uxfacsgmaa	My dog was very ill and in a lot of pain by the time he was put down. I just looked at it like we were doing him a favour, putting him out of his misery. <br>  <br>  Your pet was taken from you, unfortunately, so you don't have that luxury - all I can suggest is that you focus on the happy memories and grieve in your own way. Losing a loved one is losing a loved one, whether it be two-legged or four-legged :). <br>  <br>  Sorry for your loss. Hope you can move forward.|`|XR2BCYOSaa	I believe in an afterlife, but not in god.<br>  and I cry and feel sad but try to think of the happy times.|`|7mhRDbvsaa	sacrifice it to god!??!|`|AA11135281	I'm very sorry to hear about your sad loss.  <br>  <br>  I am still mourning the loss of a beloved pet who died years ago.  For me it helped to keep a photo of him nearby (on my desk at work and on the table next to my favorite chair at home) so I would see it and think of him.  One thing I was determined not to do was to avoid talking about him.  Our family talked about him every day for a long time, and that kept his memory alive.  The trick is not to talk only about the loss, but to remember all the good times we enjoyed with him.  I also planted a garden in his memory, and I think of him each time I walk through the garden.|`|f10424ac1ac7b1791b4f665094823d61aa	Angela, I'm so sorry your pet tragically died today.   That is so sad for you.<br>  <br>  It leaves a big hole in our hearts when this happens.  We just have to think of the happy times we had with our pet and the love we shared, and also that the memories of our lives with them were enriched by their prescence.<br>  <br>  It can help a little to accept that life is a serious of changes and that impermanence is a feature of life.  And always to remember that they still live on in our memories and in our hearts.<br>  <br>  And who knows we could all be wrong and maybe one day you will be with your pet again.  <br>  <br>  I bend the rules to suit myself about the afterlife when it suits me,  no harm in doing that if it brings comfort.|`|RKhSRMlZaa	There's no indication in the Bible that pets will be in heaven, just so you know. <br>  <br>  For me, I will mourn my pet if it ever dies.  I will be devastated, just like anyone else.  But I know, of course, that I will never see him in the nonexistent afterlife.|`|jOwH96wKaa	Aw, sorry to hear that. D:<br>  <br>  I was sad when my hamster died. I REALLY wanted to give the lil guy a viking funeral, but my friends were all, "OMG isn't that illegal!??!" Sigh. So I just gave him a regular burial.<br>  <br>  But really, I HIGHLY suggest a viking funeral. =) Only because it would be cool...|`|3TjiJls7aa	well i look at like you gave your pet a wonderful life. Animals do not have a concept of life and death, they just make the most of every moment. I also feel like your pet would want you help another animal have a great life. <br>  It will be ok, good luck!|`|2rJwgk40aa	im sorry about your pet.*hugs*<br>  I usually cry,let all the hurt out.Then i remember all the fun i had with them and how much i loved them|`|QlQYGlifaa	Awwww :(  I'm sorry. I guess just remember all the joy and laughter s/he gave you.|`|casg30Ataa	bury them, and go buy a new one to make the tears go away lol
6gthdHpnaa	WHAT IS THE IT FACTOR?<br>  ARE PEOPLE BORN WITH IT?<br>  Popularity is subjective. There are a lot of reasons someone might be popular. There is no one "it" factor. Some popular people are considered to have good looks and that may be why they are popular, but some people are popular just for their character, intelligence, etc.<br>  WHAT MAKES YOU THINK "POPULAR!"<br>  The dictionary (dictionary.com) says that popular means "regarded with favor, approval, or affection by people in general." Therefore, it means that a lot of people like this person. I disagree with that definition, because a lot of people dislike popular people. I think popular people are the ones who get a lot of attention (positive and negative.) They tend to have lots of people hanging around them, that may or may not be true friends. <br>  WHAT MAJORITY OF POPULAR PEOPLE ARE MEAN?<br>  For lack of a better term, "meanness" is subjective, just like popularity. It's based on opinion (Person A thinks Person B is mean, but Person C does not) therefore percentages or majorities cannot be calculated because that would be using mathematics, which is based on facts.  <br>  WHAT IS POPULAR PEOPLE'S BIGGEST WEAKNESS?<br>  Not all popular people are the same, so they don't all have the same weakness. But I think a lot of popular people are seen as having a perfect life, when they don't. So they might feel that this is something that they have to hide, that they have to live up to people's expectations for them. They might feel as if they are always under a microscope: people are always looking at them, trying to find something bad about them, hating them, loving them, so they might try to be someone they are not. <br>  CAN THE "IT"  FACTOR BE OBTAINED?<br>  I don't think there is one it factor. There are plenty of reasons people are popular, some of them can be obtained, some of them can't. And people shouldn't try to be popular, because as I said before, popularity is subjective, and most popular people are not as happy as they might appear on the surface. <br>  CAN SOMEONE BECOME POPULAR? HOW?<br>  Sometimes people can become popular, sometimes they can't. It depends on who they are, what popularity is defined as, and what characteristics one must have to be considered popular. The word popular is thrown around a lot, but what does it mean, really? Why are "popular" people different than the average person? Who are they "popular" to? Themselves? Who decides who is popular? Is popularity really something to want to become? Maybe not.|`|EmOnt7FIaa	Here are some websites that may help;<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Be-a-Popular-Girl" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Be-a-Popular-Girl</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Be-Popular" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Be-Popular</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_2034472_be-popular.html?ref=fuel&utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=ssp&utm_campaign=yssp_art" rel="nofollow">http://www.ehow.com/how_2034472_be-popul...</a><br>  <br>  (and please, for the record, don't change yourself too much because your true colors will eventually show.)|`|6a0f5242e106e58c4ca1b110e61eb592aa	Being a good listener, being secure with one's self (yes, confidence), doing the right thing, no matter what, being kind to everyone and trying to always have a positive attitude....Having a great smile, helps too.|`|KnSv7wPjaa	Just be yourself, if you want to be popular, then justtt be your self! (p.s. their weekness is when they get a problem wrong in school.)|`|G4bwplVKaa	What/who is popular is all up to the individual. If you have confidence, then you will go far, but if you are arrogant then you've pushed it too far. Society unfortunately decides who is popular in high school. Its just a clique that most often grew up together and are viewed as "esthetically pleasing," and most of the time there is nothing beneath the beauty. But, once you are out of school and in the real world, all that matters is what you can bring to the table and how you interact with others. People grow up and mature and looks become so much less of an issue.|`|ENYkIOPDaa	You must have confidence,<br>  No one is born with it, it really depends on who you hangout with and your personality. Most popular people are the ones that are Beautiful and very very very outgoing. Many popular people are mean because they know that there are some people who envy them and they take it for granite. Everyone wants to be popular because no one wants to be a major nerd. I'm kinda popular, like i'm friends with almost everyone in different cliques. Main thing is if you want to be popular that means you must be like everyone else, you have to have whats in (in style and everything). The Best thing is just to be yourself|`|uBS8hHL8aa	First of all, there are good popular people, and bad popular people. The good ones are usually nice/weird or different and therefore are well known. They could be like a class captain. However, the bad ones are usually the trouble makers, the funny ones, with a big group. I have never been like that, and I am still not sure how to become one of them. Nor do I want to. But I am looking forward to seeing what other people say, it is interesting.|`|pIc6TiYIaa	I guess you could say i'm pretty popular, but the thing i observe in my other popular friends is that they are always confident no matter what. They are nice people and a large range of people get along with them. Its important not to be mean, because sooner or later everyone is going to avoid you. The biggest weakness is you dont know who all your true friends are, and you can barley trust anyone.|`|6YYJHdQ2aa	I hate to tell you this but in my school its a your born with it or your not. Thats just it. Im popular. And onnly certain types of people can become popular. I hate this but people judge by looks, so if a girl is "Chubby" and has alot of pimples she is not gonna be popular! Trust me i know!|`|mquRob1faa	i think most popular people are very confidant. <br>  Its not looks (although that helps) i know some unnatractive popular people. <br>  its not money, although again, it helps. im broke, and even though i wouldnt call myself popular, im not doing badly. i guess im friends with some of the popular people. i dont really know if i am or not.|`|mF0L5jMNaa	Confidence and you gain that by knowing what to say and how to act.  Etiquette, charm, cleanliness, and a smile will take you far!|`|UOIcXs7Haa	Usually the IT factor is obtained through spreading ones legs.|`|OMDxtS6Eaa	by being u..<br>  just be u and u can prove oters wrong..cos we are not the same..some have different quality|`|ZKLlTxd0aa	The "It" factor is everything from appearance, to friends, to personality, to experiences. A kid who is ugly is not going to be "It", as sad as that is. A kid who has no friends is definetly not going to be it, neither somebody who is shy, boring, insecure or unfunny. A kid who picks his nose or a girl who trips over her feet every day or embarasses herself will not be popular. And as shallow as it is, popularity is also what clothes you wear. Nobody who wears JC Penney will be very popular. You have to be up with style. Most are born with it. You may notice many popular people have the same zodiac sign. For example Leos. They are fashionable, outgoing, confident, and it is a common sign among popular people. Also Sagitarrius's can be popular. Anybody can be popular but it is hard work and more natural if you are born with it. When I think popular I think stylish clothes and those loud annoying kids who go to the movies in groups of 20's. I'm sorry, that's just what crosses my mind. Popular people can be as mean as they can be, just like anybody else. But the thing is, popular people never have one best friend, so they spread secrets and rumours about their friends, they will abuse their position and harass un-popular kids with the famous line, "at least I have friends", and they will shun out the world. Sometimes. They can be nice.  Do I wish I was popular...there are times when I would say yes, but mainly I think I'd want good friends rather then being popular. I might wonder if the popular people were to include me, would I make some good friends there? Not just for popularity's sake, but for friendship's sake. Because in a nut shell, popular kids are just a group of friends who are up-to date on who's dating who, fashion, etc. You'd think a popular person's biggest weakness would be losing their status. It is, but only if you are one of the mean popular kids I earlier discussed. Popular people are still humans, and they have human problems. Don't refer to them as extra-terrestrials that can't be penetrated or something...no, you might have the anorexic girl, or the cool guy with an alcoholic father, or other things. They have real-life issues like us. The "It" factor can be obtained. It is possible. But it's not going to happen overnight. You have to be patient. And you probably shouldn't be worried about it because high school is only 4 years of your life and what will popularity matter when you're in a workplace. But if you want it for the right reasons and are not going to let it be your top priority, it can be achieved. Be more outgoing, fun, less shy, forget your insecurities. Think about that cool guy with all the pimples. He's popular, why can't you be?<br>  <br>  Hope you get an A!|`|Ps9eOIchaa	Confidence,not caring what other people think of you,being outgoing and social,talking to anyone and everyone,different cliques,groups,races,not being racist or discriminating,open minded to different cultures,groups,thoughts and opinions,being opinionated and speaking your mind,nice,caring,trustworthy,respectful,... and optimistic<br>  <br>  To become popular you have to be able and know how to socialize and not worry about what other people think of you.<br>  <br>  The "it" factor,some people are just born with it,having a bubbly personality,not putting people down or gossipping 24/7<br>  <br>  Sometimes looks make someone popular.Being "hot" or "sexy" or "beautiful" play a factor,but a person shouldn't want to be popular because of looks.Or being a ****,but those aren't good reasons for being popular|`|nWf5HdGxaa	* IT factor- having people immediately  want to get to know you<br>  * yes, I guess<br>  * being friendly, outgoing, and nice but in most schools being rich, pretty, and being full of yourself with confidence <br>  * 90?<br>  * I am {but Im am the 1st choice for what makes a person popular! =) }<br>  * hmmmmm....... for mean people: secrets, or people they make fun of standing up to them in a big group <br>  * nope i dont think so<br>  * i guess so, by being nice and  being friends with everyone.

You're not worried about upsetting other people too much because you have your own plan.  If someone else upsets you however, you don't have a problem telling them.  And you should be skilled at doing just that in a witty way (the art of repartee, or turning an opponents attack into a verbal attack of your own right back at them).  <br>  <br>  It also helps to be funny, have decent looks and a sense of fashion (know what looks good on YOU), and have a little money - though not essential.  <br>  <br>  Overall, you have to know yourself, be ok with that and then have fun living your life.|`|bgngiygEaa	Normally people who are mean are not always the popular ones!

T52vXXBJaa	"I contend that we are both atheists. I just believe in one fewer god than you do.

Something like this (but not exactly)  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive...|`|D9lMg7A2aa	Neither...You are looking at religion like it was the SATs. It is a road, a path, a going to somewhere else and there are many places on the road, both between people and in regard to one person's life at its different stages. Which is why Christianity was first called 'The Way'.    Even in Catholicism, there is a huge continuum, from the 'baby faith' up to the 'faith of adults' spoken of by St Paul.    So the whole construction of your question is off.|`|NLinPsyhaa	All religions are misleading. Only faith in Christ is truth.|`|VcD1Q6cUaa	Other theistic religions strengthen my belief of a Supreme Being, the only One God.|`|AA10192697	I am Catholic and told my whole life that the Catholic Church is the church that Jesus started on earth through the 12 apostles before He ascended to Heaven.  This I truly believe.    With that said, I understand why there are many other Christian denominations but I think they aren't the True Church because they don't follow the Holy Sacraments that Jesus gave man, many deny the Trinity (which is denying God Himself), many deny Mary's perpetual virginity and that she is now in Heaven, many deny the existence of saints, etc.      The Bible has been translated incorrectly, scriptures added and omitted, etc.  I read and study from the NAB, though the Catholic Church approves of 4 others Bibles.  I don't read from Bibles that Lutherans, Protestants, etc use because they have omitted some books.    I can understand why people would disagree with me but this is my faith and through years of studying it's history this is my belief.|`|TrmLJB7Daa	As the oldest is a religion ,the probability to be the real one is more increased but not always.It is something to consider.|`|2AqU4SjYaa	They are "possibilities" for other people to follow . . . but not me.

I wouldn't insult atheism like that :P|`|11b70cab8a6a69fef89e99846ac0cc19aa	To be blunt, I don't really consider other religions as possibilities. You may see this as being narrow-minded, but I'm just telling you the truth instead of false diplomacy. I know a thing or two about most major religions, and their fundamentals, and they don't seem to me to be much of a possibility.    Then again, if their possibility was that questionable, they wouldn't have so much followers in the first place, which means it all goes down to perspective and what you accept as logical and reasonable.    To tell the truth, I'm more like having a tug between theism and deism. Agnosticism also seems a distant possibility.    However, when it comes to religion, only one sounds reasonable to me, and you know what that is.    Edit: O_O................ Islam.|`|XiCGpIx3aa	Since belief, regardless of what religion you choose, is based in a deep faith that it is right, isn't it a lack of faith to acknowledge another religion as a possibility?    At that point what good is it to have a belief?    Would a Muslim consider a Hindu misled?  Would an Atheist consider a Christian misled?  If you deeply believe in your faith, or lack of it, then yes you believe the other party is misled.  Otherwise you are just "going thru the motions."|`|AA11564680	Men will always wrangle for religion...  write for it, fight for it, and even die for it  any thing BUT - live for it

zCLo7wOnaa	I used to live in a haunted house in Arkansas.  We lived there for about 2 months.  The first month we actually slept there, the second month we went there in the day to get things and slept at my grandmother's house.      We heard whisperings of "murderer, murderer, murderer".  Periodically you would walk through an ice cold spot in the room.  At night we could hear a victrola playing and my mom and I could sing the song simultaneously.  I woke up one night to a man's face floating in my ceiling, and twice I saw a man holding a scythe and a little girl about age 9 with a braid.  What really convinced me though was returning at the end of our second month and finding a hand print about half the size of mine.  On the bookshelf in the hall was one of my porcelain dolls and right in front of it was a hand print in the dust.      I did some research a few years after we lived there and in the 1800s the farmer who lived there murdered his three daughters, his wife, and then himself.  The house never had anyone live there more than 6 months and now it's condemned.  If I didn't believe then, I sure do now.|`|G9VBTg47aa	Heard screaming late in the middle of the night, really loud too.

He was staying at his girlfriends house and he didn't trust the neighbours, and i needed to lend his car in the morning so i offered to stay there by myself..     In the middle of the night i woke up but still half asleep feeling like someone had got in the bed with me, all of a sudden i felt like i couldn't move and i felt a warmth like breath on my face..     Then it felt like the room had twisted around, so the bed seemed like it was now on the wall and the wall in front of the bed was like now the floor and the ceiling became like the wall in front..     The next thing i started to raise off the bed towards the ceiling even though the ceiling seemed to me like it was the wall in front of the bed, but i still could not move..     All of a sudden i fell back towards or onto the bed and was stuck to it like a magnet force, i was trying for ages to lift myself off the bed and then i remembered to pray to God in the name of Jesus Christ to get rid of this evil..     It went in a Flash as i'd mentioned the name Jesus, i felt a calm come over me that put me back to sleep..     I jumped up in the morning remembering everything, then i quickly got dressed and made a sharp exit, funny enough my friend said something similar happened to him a week or so later....|`|FKqR3dwBaa	I was in the hallway of my house when I saw a hand(right) float from one side of the hallway to the other.

It was really dark in my bedroom, but I could see a grim reaper like figure floating directly above me asif it was floating on an upside down bed. I couldn't see it's face. It didn't have one of those scythe things. I couldn't see and body parts. Just that damn cloak floating above my bed. It was the most hellish experience I have ever had and after it disappeared I was so scared I couldn't even breathe properly because I was afraid to make any noise. I swear on my whole family that's what I saw, but I had to convince myself it was a dream. It probably was, but it felt so terrifyingly real. I feel like tears are gonna come outta my eyes just thinking about it. I didn't sleep in that same room for about 6 months or so and then I moved back in to swap with my brother. Never happened again so I'm assuming it's not real and just a terrible dream. It was so surreal I wouldn't care if it happened again just to experience the thing.

But notwithstanding he being holy, he showeth unto the children of men that, according to the flesh he humbleth himself before the Father, and witnesseth unto the Father that he would be obedient unto him in keeping his commandments.<br>  <br>  So there you have it.  Christ was baptized, not because he was sinful, but to fulfill all righteousness, to show us the perfect example and to be obedient to the Father.|`|4xirnuOJaa	I suggest you find out for yourself. Nothing is better than investigating the TRUTH for yourself, free from other opinions.<br>  <br>  Here's the verses to get you started on your path.<br>  <br>  13Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him.<br>  14But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me?<br>  15And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness. Then he suffered him.<br>  <br>  Matthew 3:13-15<br>  <br>  America Bless God<br>  Love is the Key my Friends|`|dF5clN4daa	To fulfill all righteousness (according to Jesus Himself)<br>  <br>  John was not baptizing in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.... he was preaching the "baptism of repentance" to usher those into the kingdom of the coming Messiah (John was the forerunner).  Jesus was preparing to present Himself as the "King" promised by the prophets and that His kingdom (the Kindgom of heaven) is at hand.  All Jews were called to repentance through John's baptism... It would have been wrong if Jesus had not responded to "the one crying in the wilderness" who was preparing the way because that is what God required of man... and Jesus, although being God, was also, definitely, 100% man and was subject to God's call through John the Baptist.<br>  <br>  I can't be 100% sure about the spiritual significance but it probably has something to do with this:  All men are sinners (except Jesus) and condemned.  We all deserve God's wrath and God would have surely destroyed us had he not loved us.  But because of His love He search us out and delivered us from wrath the only way He could.  The law said "Death to Mankind" and God is bound by His Holy Law.  So God repented of His wrath towards us by placing His wrath on His own Son thereby satisfying the righteous requirements of the Law... a blood atonement is made.  So the very act of Jesus receiving the baptism of repentance by John could have been an allegory to God's repentance of wrath towards mankind.<br>  <br>  Add...<br>  <br>  It is considered by many that Jesus' baptism marked the beginning of His earthly ministry.  In this way, Jesus was entering the temple as the high priest ministering the duties of a priest for his people.  When entering the temple to minister before God for the people, a priest must wash himself... it is a ceremonial cleansing.|`|wMrWVOsZaa	Because Jesus identified with us ordinary sinners. He was baptized to reveal the Blessed Trinity, the Son being baptized, the Father's voice and the Holy Spirit descending.|`|t88527U1aa	Jesus was God in flesh and flesh in God self explanatory!|`|e21a15c26fe150cd05b8f03735e6ce4caa	Wow.

And since then I have seen things like 'enlightenment', 'the meaning of life' and 'truth' differently.<br>  <br>  There have been a couple of others that have been important.

It is in contrast to all the other earthly religions that say you have to have a close relationship with god.|`|eBKJRmEgaa	"how do they (you) think humans came to be?"<br>  <br>  We evolved, as did all other life on Earth. There is clear evidence for this.<br>  <br>  "Do atheists tend to turn to science (as in the Big Bang theory).."<br>  <br>  Science is simply the investigation of the natural world through observations of natural phenomena. Facts determined through science are at least the only thing we can all agree on!<br>  <br>  "..or just not question it at all?"<br>  <br>  That's what science is all about, questioning. Anything your science teacher tells you you can prove for yourself - you can find the evidence for it or repeat the experiment.<br>  <br>  "what made us?"<br>  <br>  Nothing made us, we evolved from simpler life forms.<br>  <br>  "If it was the Big Bang, what made that?"<br>  <br>  Time and space are dimensions of the universe. Since cause and effect only make sense within the context of time, we can only apply causality from the point of the Big Bang. It is nonsensical to talk of causes of the universe.|`|d529cebfe13576f3ddee3e55b4cd08ffaa	I'm sure there is a "perfectly good scientific explanation," but have we found it conclusively? Who knows.

I could explain HOW we are here based on various scientific theories (Big Bang, Evolution, etc) but to explain WHY we are here is something different.<br>  <br>  There are big questions like this to which atheists can only answer "I don't know." And there's absolutely nothing wrong with that.<br>  <br>  One of the big problems with people who subscribe to a religion is that they do so prematurely. They jump the gun. They hop on the God bandwagon and go along with the whole story before even considering the alternative. Look at you, you're 15! You've barely had any time to consider all of this, yet you consider yourself a monotheist. I would suggest you take your time and search for the answers yourself without the influence of religion.<br>  <br>  It's good that you like different perspectives on things in life.

Atheism predates empirical science, and isn't dependent upon it.<br>  <br>  As far as what "made" the Big Bang, we don't know. But I'm comfortable saying that.

It was originally postulated by a physicist who was also a Catholic priest.  As far as I know he wasn't excommunicated for it.<br>  <br>  As for what created the big bang, it's just as plausible to say that there is no beginning to time as it is to say that God has always been there and didn't need to be created.

There was actually no bang because oxygen doesn't exist in space.<br>  <br>  Astrophysicists are now studying the possibilities of Multi Universes and parallel realms.  You must remember, not everyone sees God, or the term God, as being a religious entity.  Many see God, or use the term God, to refer to Energy, or the force that exists within all living things.<br>  <br>  It is believed, or it is a theory, that we all came about from the explosion, from a single cell out of many, from the explosion.<br>  <br>  Scientists, some of them not all, wouldn't be a bit surprised if we weren't the creation of UFOs.  :)  After all, there is plenty of evidence of their presence, actual material evidence.

It's actually not controversial, the idea has been around for well over a century, and the understanding of molecular biology and genetics to begin to understand the many complex mechanisms has also been uncovered, and continues to be revealed.<br>  As for where the first life came from, it obviously was very simple and generated from nonliving matter, but there is not yet a convincing theory for how this could have occurred.<br>  The big bang was the beginning of the universe, and what came before that is unknown and very likely unknowable, to the extent that the term "before" even has a meaning when referring to the very beginning of the universe.|`|f522078ffdf8786fcab6f8023c6befbdaa	Me personally?<br>  <br>  Of all the physical theories out there on the origin of the universe, I tend to lead towards the concept of the inflaton.<br>  <br>  What this is is the idea that in a quantum field, you will occasionally see quantum wave superposition that creates such a large energy field (in accord with quantum indeterminancy) that it will inflate rapidly, producing a shift in the laws withing the bubbel.  A "baby universe" forms.<br>  <br>  Since the bubble may have a higher or lower zero-point energy field, it's possible for a low-energy field to give rise to a high-energy field, which prevents the otherwise inevitable entropic decay.<br>  <br>  In short -- I acknowledge the need for something eternal or infinite chain of causation or even circular causation.<br>  <br>  I just see no reason to believe it's intelligent or bears any of the other traits commonly ascribed to a deity.|`|qktzCVvMaa	When you don't know something for sure, it is NOT okay to jump to "God did it."<br>  <br>  However, there is significant evidence for evolution. Study it if you want to see for yourself. Abiogenesis (formation of living organisms from nonliving material) is being studied, and it looks like a promising explanation to me. Most atheists accept things like the Big Bang Theory because there is evidence to back them up. I don't know any atheist who would still not believe in Creation when presented with true, testable, repeatable evidence that there is a God. <br>  <br>  As for your final question, "who made that? And that? etc."<br>  The same could be asked of God. Just saying "he is eternal" does not suffice as a scientific answer.|`|wcOq60Hhaa	I would argue that, yes, atheists in general turn to science to answer scientific questions.<br>  <br>  In terms of (adult) atheists answering your question directly, I would say that atheists tend to think *differently* than you (theists) do on the question of "being-ness."<br>  <br>  One group thinks as you suggest:  they simply don't think about such things or they don't think such questions are important (to them).<br>  <br>  Another group (including me) think such questions miss the point.  To see what I mean -- think for just a moment about how you think God came to be.  Do you think the more important question ("deeper") is what made God?  Given that you are a theist, I would assume your answer is "no, asking what made God misses the point of the inquiry."    My answer to you is the same:  asking "what" made us misses the point of the inquiry.<br>  <br>  Another way for me to explain my position is to point out that you are simply assuming that a "what" or a "who" must be the point of the inquiry.  Both logic and science strongly suggest such an assumption is a mistake:  most of the time an "agent" is an exception, not the rule.

cfusEJPFaa	Catholics ARE Christians.<br>  <br>  Before Martin Luther and King Henry VIII, all Christians were Catholic.  Yes, there was the eastern orthodox, and Greek orthodox, but even today these are considered to be in communion with the Catholic Church.<br>  <br>  Martin Luther (correctly) spoke out against the abuses of the church at the time (selling indulgences, etc.).  The abuses he protested are no longer practiced.<br>  <br>  Henry VIII broke with Rome because the Pope would not grant him a divorce, so he formed his on Anglican Church.<br>  <br>  Other poorly catechized christians broke away, and protestantism devolved into a practice of inventing God in Man's own image.  Protestants have dispensed with the 1500 years of Christian tradition which preceeded them, and in doing so have lost the framework of referenced used in interpreting the Bible.  Many Protestants disregard the old testament, or pay it little attention, thus missing much of the understanding of the relationship between God and Man that Preceeded and set the stage for Jesus (not saying most Catholics are any better, but the Catholic Church places equal weight on the old and the new testaments.).<br>  <br>  Most people who say Catholics are not Christian are simply speaking from a position of ignorance and prejudice, trying to justify their own apostasy.|`|0yTM98Odaa	Catholics are a denomination of Christianity and like somebody has already said all Catholics are Christian but not all Christians are Catholics|`|1TYZDRUqaa	All Catholics are Christians, but not all Christians are Catholics.|`|G6ein0naaa	Catholics are Christians, but not all Christians are Catholic. Non-Catholic Christians are Protestants. The Catholic Church was the original Christian church. Martin Luther decided to break off of it and start a new branch of Christianity. That's how Protestantism was born. When he left the church, he removed 7 books from the Bible. This is the cause of major differences and arguments between the Catholic church and the Protestant church.<br>  <br>  Protestants believe in Sola Scriptura (faith based on scripture alone).<br>  Catholics believe in scripture and Apostolic tradition. They also regard other religious texts as valid.<br>  <br>  Protestants believe in Sola Fide (salvation based on faith alone).<br>  Catholics believe in salvation based on faith AND works. You'll find that the Catholic stance on this issue is more biblically supported.<br>  <br>  Protestants greatly misunderstand Catholics, as you can probably tell by the ridiculous answers they left here.|`|1ffb5797d2e26ccb8eb17dd3db6e22c0aa	OK,  let me apologize for all the people who merely answer "Catholics are Christians"  -- obviously that's not the POINT of your question. <br>  <br>  I am Catholic,  my wife is Baptist,  I went 9 years to a Baptist Private School because it was better then the local Catholic school, academically as well as disciplinarily.  This isn't usually the case, but in my town and Catholic school was pretty lax about schooling and keeping kids in line. <br>  <br>  ANYWAYS,  I only mention this to say,  I feel like I understand BOTH sides of the fence pretty well. <br>  ___________________________________<br>  <br>  The Short Answer is:  What to do about Early Christianity before the bible existed.  ALL the differences can BASICALLY be boiled down to this ONE central point of contention. <br>  Catholics believe that we can't break with what the early Christians believed as a TRUE religion, which reflects a real truth,  would have no reason to change their core doctrines. IF the religion is TRUE, and therefore represents an actual real truth,  Why would it have any reason to change? any change could only be to move away from that truth.  In doing so,  the Catholic church MUST reconcile the oral teachings, written teachings, AND the traditions of the very 1st Christians in order to stay consistent with the Apostles.<br>  Anotherwards,  IF we can prove that the christians who KNEW the apostles and directly learned from THEM, believed something,  then we should believe it TOO,  or else we break with tradition and aren't following the true faith. <br>  <br>  Non-Catholic christians, (referred to as "protestants" by Catholics) on the other hand,  stick ONLY to what is written in black and white in the bible. <br>  Not only THAT, but they believe that the Holy Spirit will guide them in PERSONALLY interpreting the bible for themselves,  no need for any help or central authority to tell them what the bible says.  IF you believe in God and Jesus in your heart and read the bible with an open heart, THEN the Holy Spirit will guide you to the CORRECT interpretation. <br>  <br>  The Protestants "personal interpretations" have led them to believe that MOST of what the Catholic church has preached and taught since the early ADs  is patently false.  They feel that the Catholic church has the wrong interpretation.<br>  <br>  Catholics have a problem with the Protestant view of the "holy spirit" guiding EVERYONE, because of the fact that there are roughly 30,000 different denominations of Christianity in the world today.  So, if this doctrine of Protestantism is to be believed,  then the Holy Spirit is apparently revealing 30,000 different versions of the "truth" to people. <br>  <br>  Catholics believe that each person SHOULD read and interpret the bible for themselves,  BUT do so within the confines and consistent with the interpretation of the Catholic church AND the beliefs of the early Christians from the first and 2nd centuries AD.  -- Within the general guide lines of THAT..you are free to have your own opinion on minor matters.   <br>  But everyone just interpreting their bible on their own, without any respect to consistency,  is dangerous and can lead to individuals SKEWING the interpretation to fit their own fallible nature. <br>  <br>  Most Protestants speak much more assuredly about their salvation then Catholics. Protestants talk about "being saved"  in a past tense.  Catholics merely take the humble approach of leaving the ENTIRE decision up to God, and never speak as if their salvation is assured.  To a Protestant this is a lack of faith in God.  To a Catholic, this is simple acknowledgment and respect for our place in life..we simply don't make the decision,  it is God who decides...therefore we can NEVER know definitively if we are saved or not.<br>  <br>  ALL the other differences stem from this 1 ideological difference.<br>  ____________________<br>  <br>  Now here are some other things to think about...<br>  <br>  1) Catholic church was the First Christian church to exist. It can trace its roots back to 32AD when Christ said to Peter, You are my rock and upon you I will build my church and the gates of hell will not prevail against it.  -- Peter was not the first Pope,  BUT his sucessors became the Popes, ergo the Catholic church is the only Christian organization which can lay claim to having an unbroken link back to Peter himself. <br>  <br>  2) The Catholic church can show documents proving that what it believes today, is the same as what was preached all the way back to the 1st century AD.  Recall that Jesus died around 32AD and many of the apostles lived 'til around 60-70AD.  Therefore, linking back to the 1st century, your beliefs means that what was practiced by early Christians was taught by the apostles. One example I'm aware of is Ignatius of Antioch, who lived during the life of Peter and Antioch was one of the MAIN heads of Chrsitian thinking back then.  He lived from 35AD (just after Christ's resurrection) and 110AD. Peter died around 67AD.  Ignatius writes amongst other things of 3 important parts of the Catholic faith.<br>  A)  He refers to the "Katholos" church, Greek for Catholic, so he does this in a way which makes it seem like it is in use already and everyone knows about it.<br>  B) He urges people to follow their BISHOPS<br>  C) He urges people to believe in the Eucharist and NOT those which deny it<br>  <br>  3) I am CONVINCED that Catholics and Protestants actually believe the exact same things about Salvation,  they just state them differently.  Protestants believe in "sole fide" or "faith alone"  - which says salvation is based on Faith and not works.  Faith is what saves ya.  However,  you can't have FAITH and not live it,  so a TRUE Christian will do "works" BECAUSE of faith.  <br>  Ironically,  Catholics say "AMEN!"  they believe the same thing, but merely state it differently.  They believe it is silly to differentiate faith THEN works,  and simplify things by saying Faith AND Works are BOTH components of salvations, anotherwards,  IF you do works BECAUSE you have faith.. then,  it is silly to make distinctions and ESSENTIALLY the 2 are necessary.  -- So you see, they ironically BOTH believe the same,  they just argue over the words.  "faith then works" or simply "faith and works"<br>  <br>  4) I find it ironic that the very bible which the Catholic church thought about,  debated about, and finally compiled into 1 book and gave to the world as holy scripture fit for the teaching of the faithful, is the VERY book which is used against it  on a daily basis to "prove" that what it teaches is unbiblical.  That the very Protestants which believe EVERYONE has the right to interpret the bible as led by the holy spirit,  then use their OWN interpretation to definitively say the Catholic church is completely wrong.  NOT that it is there opinion,  but that Catholics are completely unbiblical or "fallen away"  Especially since the core doctrines of the Catholic church have not changed since the 1st century AND the Protestants fell away from Catholicism in the 1600s.<br>  <br>  <br>  I don't mean any of this to condemn Protestants,  I merely see it as ironic and unfortunately that their continues to be this divide.<br>  <br>  The Catholic church does not believe that all non-catholics go to hell.  Their stance on this is that although the other Christian faiths are not in "full union" with the Catholic church, the fact that their doctrines make them in "partial union" means that the Catholic church can not definitively say that they do not result in salvation.<br>  <br>  Most of the time you get  a much less humble and honest reply from many of the ferverant Protestants I've ran into, they seem much more damming of Catholics then we are.|`|AA10034051	Catholic Christians belong to the church that Jesus Christ established in 33AD, The Catholic Church.

In fact right love does not need anything but only feelings of right. Where love is high, there selfishness is Low. Just only faith is not enough to be right. We need real Evidence. Right..?  So,   Spiritually,   What is God?  Whats makes God as god?    Well, just try to know, whats makes God as god, the Power, isnt it? So what the power can do? Ah? Well, it can give the ability to organise all things & it can give the ability to separate everything & most importantly, the Ability to control everything, isnt it? Isnt it good? Ah? So, from our hard study & research effort with the help from god, we realized that the ability to control everything, the Power of God is gradually increased in the full amount to use so; The Power of God is always the omnipotent & existed among everything. & The God now is always the same omnipotent for us, who is organised us & we are growing towards perfection. The perfection is the final stage, not the end. & The Power of God, the Ability is the reward for us to control everything in a proper manner, like the true God of goodness. & Everlasting Happiness is the final stage. & it cannot come alone without the final stage perfection of God. & if god always perfect in perfection then there have to be beginning with God for the organizing progress of all things. So, there is No end & also No beginning for all things, including this on going organizing progress. So, we cannot get anything from nothing. All are energy. E=MC2     If you dont still agree,   Note  this:  you can use any thing for Good or Bad so, whenever possible If you ask the god for the good reason to give you the ability perfection, because of your obedience, then the God will give you, if the god is Almighty.       If you are humble, Please, Pray to know the truth from true God by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit with great faith. Good or bad, Good with bad. God gave us the rights to do what is right for you & sometimes, things can be right in your point of view but wrong in Public point of view so Basically, we & god can do anything for right reason but just pray about it for the Good Answer and try to do the God's will first always.    Just think, why so much trouble & pain in this world? Then there is only one reason, without pain, no pleasure, without them, we cannot enjoy this life so always we need them. You use pain & pleasure instead of, they use you. You have to be certain to win in order to succeed in your Best job. If possible, keep the photo of your vision. The vision of your future should be clear & feel it strong enough in your visualizing mind & your desire for success should be greater than your fear of failure. & Love is the Ability. When we do repetitive actions somehow our State of mind has to be new as we did the first action. & we all make mistakes so it is hard to look for star in daylight. So just in faith, it is possible. Like that the faith in true God. Because of Lack of faith in true God, we do not have the great gift of understanding of things. All things are spiritually first, to govern by God with glory. Have a look at this world of wonders of yours & then you know the truth, when you listen to your real voice. & having a strong desire to do the best every day then stick with the best to do your best & most importantly, try to be grateful for what you have now to get out of fear & doing your best & making good people as a powerful influential person / leader, this is going to make your life winning.    The Law of mercy cannot rob the Law of justice so Justice demands the punishment of our sin but The Law of mercy requires the forgiveness to give to us & God is perfect in perfection so cannot violate his laws so The God provided the way to our salvation to overcome our sin so Jesus Christ sacrifice is much needed to return to live with God, so Jesus Christ is our savior.    Did you make the commitment to find joy in every moment by using your empowering meanings & conscious focus for the needs of your five senses?  Did you make this promise; I will never going to settle less than I can be?  Do you have the must realistic measurable rules, goals & best clear image of what you really want in all aspects of your life?  Do you live your life as a mission for your vision purpose?  Breaking down your vision into mini-goals & give must time for them regularly  Write it down the answers to be more real  Try to know all the basics to manage your life & Ask: Is it enjoyable? Rather than believing the progress is hard  Be aware of your believe which is holding you back to take actions   The Power is focus; choose wisely  http://in.youtube.com/watch?v=O061waey5g...

Until there is good positive evidence for something I don't think its unreasonable to hold off holding a positive belief in them. This is what I feel about god concepts. I mean we don't generally go about imagining all the things that we can dream up really are true and acting like they are without any evidence.|`|0bOSZIzJaa	No one devotes their heart to not believing.  Not believing in a personal god that answers prayers, decrees judgments and intelligently controls every atom and every event in the universe is just a rational manifestation of the way the world works.  The Christian god is defined in such an absurd way that it becomes self-defeating.  <br>  <br>  I would never say that an intelligent creator absolutely does not exist, but given my life experience and my world-view, there is nothing that leads me to believe there is.  If god were defined differently I would be more likely to say I believe in god.

I have read many translations of the bible, koran and torah aswell as other spiritual texts from other cultures and never found anything remotely convincing.<br>  <br>  Secondly, I have over the course of my life found a great deal of reasons NOT to believe.

Seeking to corner his friend with his own arguments, Newton placed a model of the solar system on his table and invited his friend to view it. Upon examining it, Newton’s friend exclaimed, “what a marvellous craftsmanship!” Who fashioned this exquisite model?” Newton replied casually, “This model has no maker, it materialised from nothing.” Disbelief writen large on his face, the friend asked, “What do you mean?” To this, Newton smiled and replied, “How can you my friend, insist that this model has to have a maker, while vehemently denying the existence of a divine Creator?”<br>  <br>  Moral: If a model of the solar system must have a creator then what about the gigantic solar system itself? Let us worship that Creator who has created you and me.<br>  <br>  Next...........<br>  <br>  Is there any proof that God exists?" was asked, by an atheist, of Imam Abu Hanifa and he replied, "Forget it! At the moment, I am busy thinking about this ship. People tell me there is a big ship, it contains <br>  different goods on board. There is no one to steer it, no one maintaining it. Yet, this ship keeps going back and forth; it even traverses big waves on the oceans; it stops at the locations that it is supposed to stop at; it continues in the direction that it is supposed to head. This ship has no captain and no one planning its trips." <br>  <br>  The atheist who posed the question interrupted and exclaimed, "What kind of strange and silly thought is this? How can any intelligent person think that some thing like this can occur?" <br>  <br>  Imam Abu Hanifa said, "I feel sorry about your state! You cannot imagine one ship running without some one looking after its affairs. Yet you think that for this whole world, which runs exactly and precisely, there is no one who looks after it, and no one owns it." <br>  <br>  Hearing the reply, the atheist was left speechless <br>  <br>  Next.........<br>  <br>  Once upon a time there was a king and he was a wise man too. In his kingdom used to live many other wise men. Now some of these would not agree to believe that God did exist, while others not only agreed but argued to the satisfaction of the King that there was 'God'. The King, being a wise man, arranged for a discussion.<br>  <br>  The date and time for discussion was fixed. The king held his court at the appointed time on the appointed date. The non-believers assembled in his presence but the believing wise man did not come at the appointed time<br>  <br>  The people waited and waited till they lost their patience and uttered the words: "He has no arguments to advance in support of his conviction, so he will not come. He has lost, we have won."<br>  <br>  At last, the wise man arrived and there was an uproar in the court of the king. The people cried: "Why are you late? You have lost".<br>  <br>  The king asked him to explain the cause of his delay. The believing wise man explained, saying: "I started from my home in time, but when I came by the side of the river which I had to cross before reaching here, I did not find a single boat, by which I could cross and reach the opposite bank".<br>  <br>  Upto this point the disbelieving men heard him patiently and did not say a single word. The believing man then continued:<br>  <br>  <br>  "I waited and waited till at last I saw some planks of wood coming out of the river".<br>  <br>  And the unbelieving men began to shout "O, It is a lie. It is unbelievable. It is unthinkable".<br>  <br>  Continued the believing wise man: "Plank by plank came out of the river and then I saw the planks were cut to proper size and shape and joined to each other with nails by themselves until they formed a boat. And then I took my seat in it and came over to the other bank. I am late because of the delay in the availability of the boat".<br>  <br>  Amid a roar of the non-believing men, the believing wise man tried to convince them of the cause of the delay; but the opponents would not believe him. Then he said:<br>  <br>  "You do not believe what I say. It appears the story of the boat forming by itself is something impossible for you to believe. Now in the name of justice, I ask you. Do you see the earth, the sun, the moon, the stars and the skies? Every thing is set according to a plan. But you say it came into existence without a Creator. In other words you deny the existence of God. How far is your statement reasonable and justified?<br>  <br>  This silenced them all and there was no answer to this. So the non-believers lost and the believer won.<br>  <br>  well, let's look at the most simple thing "Chicken and eggs".....chicken come out from egg, and egg come out from chicken, so which one exist first? even scientists do not have the answer for this. Of course there is a creator of the very 1st chicken or the very 1st egg no matter which one is the correct answer right? .

A very large number of "translations" of the "Aramaic Lord's Prayer" that stem from various mystic traditions and have little or no relation to the actual meaning of the Aramaic text are circulating on the Internet.

This was revolutionary stuff! Up until Jesus walked the earth, no Jew or prosylite called God "Father" - but Jesus did! Although God spoke of himself as a Father to Israel and believers as his children, that was never taken as a reason for addressing the Almighty as Father. That would be far too intimate! But Jesus did it!    The equally important point in verse 9 is that the name of God does not refer to a particular pronounciation of the Tetragrammaton (YHWH) but to the honour of God's holy reputation (i.e. 'name'). Proverbs 22:1 says "A good name is more desirable than great riches". The verses you quote from Ezekiel show how much more important it is for the nations to know that the Almighty is supreme and that he will not allow his name to be mocked. But the Tetragrammaton could not be pronounced by God's covenant people, nor would they try, out of reverence for the name of God.    Different translations offer shades of meaning that combine to teach us a lot. The words impact on me personally because "The name of the Lord is a strong tower. The righteous run into it and are protected." And, as "There is no other name given under heaven by which we must be saved" - the name of the Lord Jesus - I equate honouring God with honouring Jesus.|`|EAuMJrs4aa	i have just one addition for you    There once was a pirate (the story relates)  who liked to go dancing on roller skates.

yz6qXwUiaa	We believe that Jesus Christ is the firstborn son of God.  He is our redeemer, and our sacrificial Lamb.  Through his shed blood we imperfect people can be reconciled to our perfect God.  He has in essense "bought us" with the high price he paid.  He is our savior.  Far MORE than a prophet (as the Muslems believe) although he was also a prophet.<br>  <br>  We believe that Jesus was totally obedient and subservient to his Father Jehovah, and that by his perfect obedience, he proved what a horrid Liar Satan was when he claimed that ALL men would act selifshly and turn their backs on God if it benefitted them enough.<br>  <br>  Because Satan made this horrible accusation against all mankind, Jesus proved how much a liar Satan was, and he opened the way for imperfect but righteous mankind to have a chance at everlasting life.<br>  <br>  The Bible calls Jesus "the faithful and true witness".  That in this court case that Satan has been waging against mankind from the beginning, Jesus can stand up and tell the truth.  He can prove by his actions and integrity, just how false Satan's claims are.<br>  <br>  You see since the beginning, Satan has been trying to turn men against the Father, against Jehovah.  He has succeeded with the vast majority of mankind, but there have always been those who can testify to Jehovah's rightness as king.  Who can say "WE are better off with HIM ruling us than with anyone else, because he is our Father and because he truly loves us".  All those who choose someone else, or who want to hide who our Father is? they've chosen Satan's side of the issue.<br>  <br>  Jesus didn't do that.  The Bible tells us that he made his Father's name known to people, that he upheld Jehovah's standards, that he vindicated his Father's name, that he made him proud as a loyal and obedient son.  As a result Jehovah has rewarded Jesus by annointing him to be KING over Jehovah's kingdom.  We are taught to pray for this kingdom in the Lord's prayer and when we do pray for it and then act in harmony with that prayer by not getting involved in any lesser kingdom or throwing our loyalty in with them, WE have made it clear to all that THIS is the government we want to rule over us.<br>  <br>  The most amazing thing about that?  It works.  People who accept Jehovah and his son Jesus as their ruler, don't really need other governments over them.  All the things that earthly rulers make as "laws" trying to regulate how people act are covered in just two laws that Jesus told us about. "love Jehovah your God with your whole soul, mind and strengh" and "love your neighbor as yourself".  When a person does these two things, there is no need for laws about stealing or murder or any of the other things human kings have to make laws about.<br>  <br>  It is true as some have said that there are scriptures in the Bible which say that someone who teaches "another Jesus" should not be accepted as teaching the truth.<br>  <br>  However, I think it is interesting that those who claim WE are the ones doing that, haven't truly examined the scriptures and what they tell us about Jesus and who he is, who he claimed to be, and what he taught.<br>  <br>  Others of Jehovah's Witnesses have laid out for you many quoted scriptures about how Jesus told us "the Father is greater than I am" etc. so I suggest you look them up in your own Bible. Once you know what the Bible says about who Jesus is, and what his role is in God's outworking purpose, then you will TRULY know who it is that is teaching "another Jesus".  It isn't us.  It is those who have corrupted what the Bible truly teaches and told people it teaches something else.<br>  <br>  edit--regarding the scripture Martin quoted at 1 John 4:1-3, the scripture is not wrong, but Martin's application of it is.  Look at the scripture closely.  It says "anyone not confessing Jesus as having come in the flesh".  We very much believe that Jesus was of heaven, came in the flesh and died and was resurrected back to heaven.  Does the scripture at ANY point say "and he was God"? NO.  He can misapply it all he wants. The scripture does not say what he claims it says about us.|`|biPAZ2TVaa	JW's are not Christian. A Christian believes in Christ. For them Jesus is archangel Michael.

Yet, a comparison of Biblical statements lead to the reasonable and logical conclusion that Michael was Christ’s heavenly name.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, the doctrine that Jesus is not God almighty is a very clear and explicit teaching in the Bible. The Bible speaks of Jesus having a God over him at least 17 times even after he returned to heaven! (Mic.5:4; Ps.45:7; 89:26; Mat.27:46; Mk. 15:34; Jn.20:17; Rom.15:6; 1Cor.11:3; 15:24-28; 2Cor.1:3; Eph.1:17; Heb.1:9; 1Pt.1:3; Rev.1:6; 3:2,12).<br>  <br>  Could it ever be said that Almighty God has a God? Not without imaginative equivocation and contradiction.<br>  <br>  Scriptures repeatedly show that Jesus is less than God at every point of his existence.  At the highest position he will ever attain, Jesus still has a God over him and is "subject" to *GOD* the same way we are "subject" to him (Jn. 14:28; 1Cor.15:27,28).<br>  <br>  Every Trinitarian argument requires an ignorance from their hearers regarding Scriptural terms, context and Hebrew and Greek grammar and also must force a later meaning into Scripture (anachronism).<br>  <br>  <br>  Here is the evidence from Scripture which has led many Bible scholars throughout history to conclude that Jesus is Michael the Archangel:<br>  <br>  The term “archangel,"  occurs in the Bible only in the singular. This indicates that there is but one whom God has designated chief, or head, of the angelic host. <br>  <br>  1.) Only two names are associated with authority over angels: Michael (Rev.12:7) and Jesus Christ (Mat.16:27; 25:31; 2Thes.1:7). Michael led the angels to defeat Satan and hurl him to earth (Re 12:7). Christ leads that heavenly army of angels and conducts God's war. (Re 19:13,19).<br>  <br>  2.) At 1Thes. 4:16 the voice of the resurrected Lord Jesus Christ is described as that of an archangel. The Greek grammar demands that the voice is Christ’s, not that he is accompanied by the voice. In every biblical occurrence of this idiom it is always describing the voice of the subject (Lk. 4:33; Rev 5:2; 7:2; 10:3; 14:7,9,15,18; 19:17, Ac 7:60). If Christ were not the Archangel, describing his voice in this way would be like describing a man's voice as a mouse's; highly demeaning and disrespectful. Only the single archangel has the voice of the archangel. Hence, this prophecy gives strong reason for identifying Jesus as the archangel, Michael.<br>  <br>  3.) Only one voice can command the dead to rise in the coming resurrection. This authority has been given to the Christ by his Father (Jn.5:25,26). But it is the voice of the archangel that raises the dead during the resurrection. (1Thes. 4:16; cf Dan.12:2). Since only the voice of Christ can raise the dead at the time of the end, and this voice is the voice of an archangel, it is only reasonable to conclude that Christ must be the Archangel.<br>  <br>  The context places this event during "the presence of the Lord," when Jesus is ruling as king.–1Thes.4:15; Mat.24:3; Rev.11:15-18. This leads us to the other evidence.<br>  <br>  4.) In Daniel chapter 7, there is a prophecy about the march of world powers to the end-time. At the climax of that prophecy we read that "someone like a son of man" was "given rulership and dignity and kingdom"--Jesus Christ (Dan.7:13, 14). Then Daniel foretold that during "the time of the end"*Michael* will stand up" (Dan.10:13;11:40; 12:1). In the book of Daniel, ‘standing up’ frequently refers to a king taking up his royal power or acting as king (Dan.11:2-4,7,16,20,21). Michael’s “standing” indicates a ruling capacity and thus supports the conclusion that Michael is Jesus Christ, since only Jesus is Jehovah’s appointed King.<br>  <br>  Hence, in the climax of one prophecy, Jesus becomes a king in the end-time. In the other prophecy, Michael exercises kingly power in the end-time. Since both prophecies deal with the same time and the same event, it is reasonable to conclude that they are also dealing with the same person.<br>  <br>  5.) Michael’s “standing up” was to be associated with an unprecedented "time of distress" (Dan.12:1). The same tribulation is mentioned in Mt.24:21 in regard to Christ's "presence" in kingdom power. Then the book of Revelation (12:7,10,12) specifically mentions Michael as acting at the establishment of God’s Kingdom and links this event to extreme trouble for the earth. The correlation of the timing and actions of Michael and Jesus are difficult to ignore.<br>  <br>  6.) Michael is said to “stand up” (kingly power) as the defender of God's people during 'the time of distress' (Dan.12:1; Rev.12:6,7). Christ acts on account of the “chosen ones” during the great tribulation and his presence in Kingdom power (Mk.13:20-25; Mt 24:22,29-31). That is a singular event which precedes the time of the resurrection when both will be present (Dan.12:2).<br>  <br>  7.) Finally, Satan is abyssed by an "*angel*" for a thousand years. (Rev.20:1, 2, 10) However, when Christ was on earth, the demonsidentified him as the one who was to hurl them into the "abyss" (Mt 8:29). Since Jesus is the one prophesied to crush Satan’s head, and since he accomplishes all these other judgment acts (Gen.3:15; 1Jn 3:8), it is only logical to conclude that Jesus was the one leading heaven’s armies in the casting of Satan out of heaven earlier. Hence, the conquering Michael with “his angels” referred to in Revelation 12 must be Jesus, who was told by Jehovah to "go subduing in the midst of [his] enemies."--Ps. 110:1, 2; Acts 2:34, 35. <br>  <br>  Christ must wait at God's right hand till the time of the end. (Ps 110:1). Michael does not 'stand up in behalf of' Gods 'people' until the time of distress (the end, Mt 24:21). Christ begins to rule in the time of great tribulation. Both are present at the resurrection and it is Christ’s voice of an archangel that does the resurrection. Both Michael and Christ wait until the time of the end to do the same thing because they are the same person.<br>  <br>  No room for 8.) &  9.) <br>  <br>  All the above shows that Michael is repeatedly said to be at the *same place* as the Christ during the *same time period* doing the *same unique thing* as the Christ, but is never seen with the Christ! Kinda like Clark Kent and Superman. This argues that Jesus and Michael are the same, since they both command God's army, the heavenly host of angels.<br>  <br>  Because of this solid scriptural evidence that Michael is Christ, even many Trinitarians have agreed that Michael is one of the names of the Christ, including most early “Church Fathers,” and many modern scholars.<br>  <br>  Jehovah’s Witnesses’ doctrine is not affected in the slightest if Michael is not Christ. Therefore, it is no problem if our logical conclusions regarding Michael are proved wrong when those new scrolls are opened! (Jn.17:3; 1Jn.4:15; Rm.10:9) On the other hand, Trinitarians are aware of the difficulties caused if Christ is identified as Michael due to the extremely strong implications of his inferiority.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps,<br>  <br>  Ron Rhoades|`|wRBfUgI2aa	The Bible does not teach the trinity doictrine.  This teaching began with Nimrod worship.  He was a man who wanted to be worshiped and was noted as one who killed those who did properly worship Jehovah. (see Genesis 10 & 11)<br>  <br>  We believe Jesus is the only individual personally created by Jehovah.  For an unknown time, there was only Jehovah and Jesus--nothing else.  Also according to Colosians 1:15-18, Jehovah used Jesus to create everything else.  Does that sound like disregard for Jesus?<br>  <br>  Or how about Philippians 2:6-10 where it speaks of Jesus not even considering trying to be equal to God, Jehovah, but humbling himself to take human form for the purpose of bringing honor to Jehovah's name.  He did and for that was himself honored by being exhaulted to a position second only to Jehovah.  Second most powerful individual in the universe!  Not a bad gig.<br>  <br>  Jesus while on earth, showed us how to properly worship the God he himself worshiped, Jehovah his Father.  (1Peter 1:3; John 20:17)  More than just obeying a set of fixed laws, we are obligated to follow righteous principles that cover things never thought of by Bible writers.<br>   As the last woirds of Ecclesiastes says,  "The conclusion of the matter, everything having been heard, is: Fear the [true] God and keep his commandments. For this is the whole [obligation] of man. "<br>  <br>  "Fear" in sense of displeasing Him as a Father.<br>  <br>  WE model ourselves after what Jesus taught and did.  This is entirely different from what other popular religions do today.  Jesus made it clear the mixing of pure worship of his Father with pagan teachings was forbidden.  He made no secret of his displeasure with the Jewish clergy of his day fleecing of their flock rather than caring for them.<br>  <br>  What do we see today but the same thing coming from those who call themselves Christian?  Trinity, immortal soul doctrines, pagan celebrations with Bible names slapped on them--these are all things the Bible condemns.  So Jehovah's Witnesses condemn these practices as well.  We follow Jesus' example and do as he did while on earth.  We follow his commands for his faithful followers.<br>  <br>  As for the "Divine" part of Jesus, I am not sure what you mean by this.  JWs take it to mean Jesus as the first of all of Jehovah's Creations.  Now by his fine outstanding work, he has been elevated to the 2nd most powerful position in the universe--a god in his own right.  He is our leader in worshiping his Father, Jehovah.<br>  <br>  These are all the teachings found in the Bible. That is what and how we believe.  We do not accept any teaching not found in the Bible.|`|zBkaqIWcaa	"Jehovah's Witnesses don't believe in the "three distinct persons" in one being/essence/substance Trinity that many Christians believe in."<br>  * True, they do not believe in the Trinity.<br>  <br>  "Jesus is Divine"<br>  * They believe that Jesus is a god but not God.

(this is the only other reference to an archangel who else do people call Lord?)<br>  <br>  Micheal-means who is like God<br>  Archangel-means chief of all angels<br>  Who fits that description?<br>  It's Jesus<br>  <br>  Jesus not Equal to God<br>  <br>  The Bible says at John 14:28 Jesus announces that the Father is greater than I am. So Jesus and God are NOT one.<br>  <br>  Also Colossians 1:15 says that Jesus is the firstborn of all creation. How can God create himself? Jesus is also called God's only begotten son John 3:16. In a family, are the father and son one person? No they are different people and the father is the head of the house. The same is in heaven. God created the family unit. God is the father and head over Jesus. 1 Cor. 11:3. How can God be head over the Christ if they are one person?<br>  <br>  John 1:1 which reads: "In the beginning was the word, and the word was with God, and the word was God." This is often presented from the Gospel of John to prove that Jesus was God. There are however several problems with this claim:<br>  <br>  There is also another reason, considering the Greek of the above verse which disproves the assertion that Jesus is referred to as God in the verse. In the verse above, the first time the word God is used, the Greek is HOTHEOS, which means The God. The second time the word God is used,"....and the word was God," the word for God is TONTHEOS, which means A God. Europeans have evolved a system of capital and small letters non-existent in Greek. The God, HOTHEOS is translated as God with a capital G, whereas Tontheos, which means A or ANY God is translated with a small g, god. In this case however, we see the unlawful translators trying to prove Jesus being God by putting capital G for both whereas it doesn't belong in the case of the "word".<br>  <br>  Also John 5:30 Jesus said I'm here to do the will of the one whom sent me. How can Jesus be sent forth if he and God are one person?<br>  <br>  .(Mark 10:18) Jesus said to him: 'Why do you call me good? Nobody is good, except one, God.<br>  <br>  (Philippians 2:5-6) Christ Jesus, who, although he was existing in God's form, gave no consideration to a seizure, namely, that he should be equal to God<br>  <br>  John 12:49) I have not spoken out of my own impulse, but the Father himself who sent me has given me a commandment as to what to tell and what to speak<br>  <br>  (John 14:28) I am going my way to the Father, because the Father is greater than I am<br>  <br>  (John 20:17) (Jesus speaking) I am ascending to my Father and your Father and to my God and your God.<br>  On the night of his arrest our Lord prayed in the garden of Gethsemane. He prayed vehemently for the well being of his Apostles. He asks God that "they all may be ONE, as you Father, are in me, and I in you; that they also may be ONE in us, that the world may believe that you sent me. And the glory which you gave me I have given them, and that they may be ONE just as we are ONE." (John 17:21-22) Clearly Jesus was not asking his Father to make his apostles one in the same person. He was requesting that they be one in thought, purpose, and deed. Jesus Christ and Jehovah, his God and our God, are indeed one, but it is a oneness in their mission. This oneness of purpose can be compared to having a President and a Vice President. They are not the same literal persons, but they are one in representing the office of the presidency.<br>  <br>  John 14:26 Jesus says that his Father will send a helper the holy spirit. How can a helper be sent forth if they were one?<br>  <br>  John 5:43 Jesus said he came in his Father's name.<br>  <br>  So as one can see Jesus even said he is not equal to God and that his FATHER had sent him (in human form). Jesus is very important to us and he is one of the foundations of our teachings but as you can see even from your own Bible they are not equal.<br>  <br>  Even if people don't believe Jesus is the Archangel it clear in the Bible that Jesus and Jehovah aren't the same.|`|957f5fd635d1ebc7b016c62c2339fa54aa	JW's believe that Jesus is Jehovah God's son. It was prophesied that God would send the Messiah, or Christ to the world. 700 yrs. before Jesus was born the prophet Micah foretold that the promised One would be born in Bethlehem, a small town in the land of Judah (Micah 5:2). We also know that Jesus is not Jehovah God b/c the bible states in Colossians 1:15 "He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation." So if Jesus were GOD then how could be make he also be the first creation? To add to that thought God has no begining, as Jesus clearly does; Psalms 90:2 states "Before the mountians themselves were born, Or you proceeded to bring forth as with labor pains the earth and the productive land, Even from time indefinite to time indefinite you are God. So this is saying God has been around forever... hard to picture, but true. <br>  We also know that Jesus did live in heaven before he was sent down to earth b/c he talks about it in the book of John. John 6:38 states "becasue I have come down from heaven to do, not my will but the will of him who sent me."<br>  Well, God makes it very clear that we should worship him and only him; after all he is the creator. However, this does not mean that we do not acknowledge Jesus. In fact for Jehovah to even hear our prayers we must first scantify his name and then end prayer in Jesus' name. Jesus declared: "It is Jehovah your God you must worship, and it is to him alone you must render sacred service" (Matthew 4:10).<br>  The Bible says: "there is no salvation in anyone else, for there is not another name under heaven that has been given among men by which we must get saved" (Acts 4:12). That name being Jesus. Jesus is God's appointed King in the heavenly Kingdom that will rule the entire earth. And God requires that we obey Jesus and apply his teachings if we want everlasting life. That is why the Bible states: "He that exercises faith in the Son has everlasting life; he that disobeys the Son will not see life" (John 3:36).|`|P5rczL0Saa	I agree with Martin S.     The Bible tells us that anyone who brings a doctrine other than the belief that Jesus Christ is God in the flesh, is antichrist.   They are a cult. They bring false doctrine. They add to the Bible. They twist God's Holy Word. The Bible says "do not even greet them." (anyone who brings false doctrine) because then it is like you are agreeing with them. I don't even answer the door anymore. I will never take their "Watchtower."  That is the false doctrine that they bring.

I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16 tells us that the Bible was "breathed out" by God.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1: 11-12 tells us that the gospel was a revelation from Jesus Christ himself, which was recorded by Jesus disciples and Paul.<br>  <br>  God himself chose the disciples and the people whom He knew were going to spread His word and write the Bible.<br>  <br>  The Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 4000 years. Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors. The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvation—Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist?

They believe that there is one true God, the Creator and they believe there is a begotten Son, Jesus.  They believe that Jesus was probably with GOD all along, first as an angel, (not truly documented) but says that he was with him from the beginning.  Then as spiritual man, Jesus, and back to God's right side in heaven.  They believe that God, the Creator is giving Jesus the authority to rule over the new earth, after the much talked about Armageddon.  The Holy Spirit is not viewed as God or Jesus or as a person since it does not have a personal name and can be assumed to be the life force of the creator.<br>  A lot of people claim that Jehovah's Witness shut out Jesus, giving only the Creator recognition,   In the first part of Revelation it tells of the religions that pleased God.  One religion was almost perfect.  The one thing they missed was acknowledging the Father.  It still goes, today.

Your teacher should be able to tell you what your particular path in nature is and to put you in it. The teacher should know by your face where you belong and should be able to indicate it to you. You should never try to follow another's path, for that is their way, not yours. When your own path is found, you have nothing more to do than fold your arms and the tide will carry you to freedom. Therefore when you find your path, never swerve from it. Your way is the best for you, but that is no proof that it is the best for others as well.    The truly spiritual see Spirit as Spirit, not as matter. It is Spirit that makes nature move. Spirit is the reality in nature. Action is in nature, not in the Spirit. Spirit is always the same, changeless, eternal. Spirit and matter are in reality the same; but Spirit, as such, never becomes matter; and matter, as such, never becomes Spirit.    The Spirit never acts. Why should it? It merely is, and that is sufficient. It is pure existence absolute and has no need for action.    You-as Spirit-are not bound by law. Law belongs to nature. The mind is in nature and is bound by law. All nature is bound by law, the law of its own action, and this law can never be broken. If you could break a law of nature, all nature would come to an end in an instant. There would be no more nature. Those who attain freedom break the law of nature, and for them nature fades away and has no more power over them. All of us will one day break the law for all time, and that will end our trouble with nature.    Whenever you suppress a thought, it is simply pressed down out of sight, in a coil like a spring, only to spring out again at a moment's notice, with all the pent-up force resulting from the suppression, and do in a few moments what it would have done in a much longer period.    Every ounce of pleasure brings its pound of pain. It is the same energy that at one time manifests itself as pleasure, at another time as pain. As soon as one set of sensations stops, another begins. But in some cases, in more advanced persons, one may have two, yea, even a hundred different thoughts entering into active operation at the same time.    Mind is action of its own nature. Mind-activity means creation. The thought is followed by the word, and the word by the form. All of this creating will have to stop, both mental and physical, before the mind can reflect the Spirit.|`|gqhoCu3faa	For The most important facts of your question, please visit the web side http://www.mormon.org   &  THE GOOD SECRET EVIDENCE  There have to be a purpose for life otherwise we will miss the peaceful path of happiness to choose truly what is right & wrong.

So,   Spiritually,   What is God?  Whats makes God as god?    Well, just try to know, whats makes God as god, the Power, isnt it? So what the power can do? Ah? Well, it can give the ability to organise all things & it can give the ability to separate everything & most importantly, the Ability to control everything, isnt it? Isnt it good? Ah? So, from our hard study & research effort with the help from god, we realized that the ability to control everything, the Power of God is gradually increased in the full amount to use so; The Power of God is always the omnipotent & existed among everything. & The God now is always the same omnipotent for us, who is organised us & we are growing towards perfection. The perfection is the final stage, not the end. & The Power of God, the Ability is the reward for us to control everything in a proper manner, like the true God of goodness. & Everlasting Happiness is the final stage. & it cannot come alone without the final stage perfection of God. & if god always perfect in perfection then there have to be beginning with God for the organizing progress of all things. So, there is No end & also No beginning for all things, including this on going organizing progress. So, we cannot get anything from nothing. All are energy. E=MC2     If you dont still agree,   Note  this:  you can use any thing for Good or Bad so, whenever possible If you ask the god for the good reason to give you the ability perfection, because of your obedience, then the God will give you, if the god is Almighty.       If you are humble, Please, Pray to know the truth from true God by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit with great faith. Good or bad, Good with bad. God gave us the rights to do what is right for you & sometimes, things can be right in your point of view but wrong in Public point of view so Basically, we & god can do anything for right reason but just pray about it for the Good Answer and try to do the God's will first always.    Just think, why so much trouble & pain in this world? Then there is only one reason, without pain, no pleasure, without them, we cannot enjoy this life so always we need them. You use pain & pleasure instead of, they use you. You have to be certain to win in order to succeed in your Best job. If possible, keep the photo of your vision. The vision of your future should be clear & feel it strong enough in your visualizing mind & your desire for success should be greater than your fear of failure. & Love is the Ability. When we do repetitive actions somehow our State of mind has to be new as we did the first action. & we all make mistakes so it is hard to look for star in daylight. So just in faith, it is possible. Like that the faith in true God. Because of Lack of faith in true God, we do not have the great gift of understanding of things. All things are spiritually first, to govern by God with glory. Have a look at this world of wonders of yours & then you know the truth, when you listen to your real voice. & having a strong desire to do the best every day then stick with the best to do your best & most importantly, try to be grateful for what you have now to get out of fear & doing your best & making good people as a powerful influential person / leader, this is going to make your life winning.    The Law of mercy cannot rob the Law of justice so Justice demands the punishment of our sin but The Law of mercy requires the forgiveness to give to us & God is perfect in perfection so cannot violate his laws so The God provided the way to our salvation to overcome our sin so Jesus Christ sacrifice is much needed to return to live with God, so Jesus Christ is our savior.

So,   Spiritually,   What is God?  Whats makes God as god?    Well, just try to know, whats makes God as god, the Power, isnt it? So what the power can do? Ah? Well, it can give the ability to organise all things & it can give the ability to separate everything & most importantly, the Ability to control everything, isnt it? Isnt it good? Ah? So, from our hard study & research effort with the help from god, we realized that the ability to control everything, the Power of God is gradually increased in the full amount to use so; The Power of God is always the omnipotent & existed among everything. & The God now is always the same omnipotent for us, who is organised us & we are growing towards perfection. The perfection is the final stage, not the end. & The Power of God, the Ability is the reward for us to control everything in a proper manner, like the true God of goodness. & Everlasting Happiness is the final stage. & it cannot come alone without the final stage perfection of God. & if god always perfect in perfection then there have to be beginning with God for the organizing progress of all things. So, there is No end & also No beginning for all things, including this on going organizing progress. So, we cannot get anything from nothing. All are energy. E=MC2     If you dont still agree,   Note  this:  you can use any thing for Good or Bad so, whenever possible If you ask the god for the good reason to give you the ability perfection, because of your obedience, then the God will give you, if the god is Almighty.       If you are humble, Please, Pray to know the truth from true God by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit with great faith. Good or bad, Good with bad. God gave us the rights to do what is right for you & sometimes, things can be right in your point of view but wrong in Public point of view so Basically, we & god can do anything for right reason but just pray about it for the Good Answer and try to do the God's will first always.    Just think, why so much trouble & pain in this world? Then there is only one reason, without pain, no pleasure, without them, we cannot enjoy this life so always we need them. You use pain & pleasure instead of, they use you. You have to be certain to win in order to succeed in your Best job. If possible, keep the photo of your vision. The vision of your future should be clear & feel it strong enough in your visualizing mind & your desire for success should be greater than your fear of failure. & Love is the Ability. When we do repetitive actions somehow our State of mind has to be new as we did the first action. & we all make mistakes so it is hard to look for star in daylight. So just in faith, it is possible. Like that the faith in true God. Because of Lack of faith in true God, we do not have the great gift of understanding of things. All things are spiritually first, to govern by God with glory. Have a look at this world of wonders of yours & then you know the truth, when you listen to your real voice. & having a strong desire to do the best every day then stick with the best to do your best & most importantly, try to be grateful for what you have now to get out of fear & doing your best & making good people as a powerful influential person / leader, this is going to make your life winning.    The Law of mercy cannot rob the Law of justice so Justice demands the punishment of our sin but The Law of mercy requires the forgiveness to give to us & God is perfect in perfection so cannot violate his laws so The God provided the way to our salvation to overcome our sin so Jesus Christ sacrifice is much needed to return to live with God, so Jesus Christ is our savior.    Did you make the commitment to find joy in every moment by using your empowering meanings & conscious focus for the needs of your five senses?  Did you make this promise; I will never going to settle less than I can be?  Do you have the must realistic measurable rules, goals & best clear image of what you really want in all aspects of your life?  Do you live your life as a mission for your vision purpose?  Breaking down your vision into mini-goals & give must time for them regularly  Write it down the answers to be more real  Try to know all the basics to manage your life & Ask: Is it enjoyable?

[[the other thing is, m lil poor in spelling.a box on right side of my screen is really irritating me... so plz 4giv me as m helpless...]]      comming to the topic,  as u said, u spend time with him, talk to him, thank him and ask him for more....    and as u finished rambling, now u want to giv him something, and u are asking others...  [[these all are from ur words...ie.,u just belive in him and trust him.and you say that nothing happens by the whole world until God himself wills to do it]]    what i mean is, how can u belive that if u giv him something suggested by others, God will be happy with it??    remember that God is all by himself....  no change is gonna come in his respect either with your respect towards him nor with irrespecting him...    what i can suggest u is, ask him what he wants from u, from others. ask him to show you and others the right path and guide us so that he may accept us into heven.  and keep asking him to forgive our sins...    God is grait,true and merciful,   every thing is in his hands...    giv this a try...  if he like/wills, he will fulfill this prayer too as he did with other prayers of you...|`|PjwWWMu4aa	You could burn a lump of beef for him.

The entire time the Confederate States of America existed they were engaged in a war with the country I am sworn to defend.

The way you talk also causes troubles. You just judged the entire people living in South with your question.

The possibility of them reoffending with solid counselling and help is less likely than with the adults.  The people in prisons could introduce young offenders to new and more heinous crimes as well. They could also take advantage of them because of their age, size and less street smarts, and this could be a dangerous situation for the youth.|`|4PQOiSfZaa	No. And they aren't.

Ecclesiastes 7:12  "Wisdom is for a protection the same as money is for a protection.  But the advantage of knowledge is that wisdom itself preserves alive its owners."    See the three words in the wise man's scripture above:  wisdom, money and knowledge.  Knowledge is a familiarity with the facts, gleaned from observation, experience or study.  Wisdom is the ability to apply knowledge successfully in order to solve problems, avoid danger and attain set goals.    I am lost in the woods.  I have $17,000 in my purse.  What good is it doing me?  None.  I am still lost in the woods.      I need food, I need a measure of shelter and I need warmth.  I see trees, among them, a fruit tree.  I also see slender, pliable branches and wood chips on the ground.  This is knowledge.    Wisdom is the applying of this knowledge to attain the goal of getting food.  Climb up the tree, get the fruit.      Wisdom is the applying of this knowledge to solve the problem of getting warmth.  Use the slender, pliable branches on the ground and a shoe string from one of my shoes to make friction and light the wood chips.  Make a fire for warmth.    Wisdom is the applying of knowledge to climb up the tree when I hear the scurrying of animals around - it gives me a measure of security.    Ecclesiastes 7:12  Wisdom is for a protection the same as money is for a protection.  But the advantage of knowledge is that wisdom itself preserves alive its owners.    Proverbs 11:4  "Money will be of no benefit on the day of fury, but righteousness itself will deliver from death."    How so?  On the coming day of God's fury, money will provide no deliverance.  But the man having wisdom will have built a record of righteousness before God who will preserve him alive.

This is because a truly wise man understands that he, like all things, is akin to "straw dogs" as the Tao Te Ching put it.  Any "power" is fleeting, irrelevant and minuscule compared to the Universe in which he lives.    "Heaven and Earth are not benevolent.  They treat the myriad creatures as straw dogs..." Tao Te Ching, Chapter 5.    As for the man who desires money for power-his power is even less.  He may gain the power of a nation or even the world-but even that is pitiful compared to all the power in the universe.  In an instant, everything he holds power over can be demolished by a passing asteroid.    So the wise man seeks no power at all-and the foolish man seeks what he thinks is "power" with money.    So neither gains real power, and as such neither are powerful.|`|VdifDUGkaa	the wisdom to use your money to the greatest advantage....|`|c8tyG5z3aa	Sometimes you need one to get the other.|`|RtFO8cUbaa	Proverbs answers: Seek after wisdom, for wisdom is better than gold, even much fine gold.....|`|iaPtohhhaa	Proverbs 3:13-14: 'Happy is the man that find wisdom...for the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold.'

This misses a few points, such as the fact that we need to have faith to start reasoning in the first place (how do you know with certainty that the truths of mathematics are universally true?)  I think it is best to use faith in the sense of confidence (check out the Latin root), rather than blind faith in what is impervious to human knowledge.  this then opens up the possibility that you can combine the two.  Buddhists talk of Faith as a blind giant (can move mountains, but might head in the wrong direction!)  and Wisdom (reason, discrimination) as a disabled person with pgood eyesight.  Faith then carries wisdom on his shoulders: they go far, and get where they want to.

But as has been well demonstrated in the previous chapter, the Quran is a book of reason and rationality which roundly condemns coercion or threat in any form to change human ideas. Thus to interpret this verse to indicate that it promotes blind faith by requiring man to believe in the 'unseen' would stand counter to this Quranic emphasis. Quite to the contrary, to believe in the spurious without evidence and solid justification is what the Quran attributes to the non-believers. It further condemns them for attempting to change the views of the believers by sheer brutality. What then, does the phrase 'Belief in the Unseen' mean? This is the important question which needs to be fully addressed.    One must make an in-depth study of this phrase as a specific term coined by the Quran. The failure to grasp its true meaning may result in serious consequences as happened in the medieval ages during the scholastic debates between different Muslim schools of thought. Some rigid and uncompromising Muslim scholars disallow the use of rationality altogether in matters of faith. They state that the revealed truth by itself is all-sufficient and as such it should be accepted without any rational investigation. Others who oppose this view quote many Quranic verses requiring everyone to abide invariably by the dictates of reason at every stage of decision making and give priority to rationality over blind faith.    But what is faith? How can one have faith without satisfying one's sense of inquiry? Is it not a reality that the majority of common people belonging to all religions believe without actually comprehending the meaning of their belief? They just happen to believe and that is all there is to it.    This is the dilemma which necessarily requires one to address the issue of faith versus reason, and the need to determine the nature of their interrelationship becomes all the more important. As this question is sufficiently covered in the chapter entitled European Philosophy, we shall endeavour not to unnecessarily repeat what has already been covered therein. What is left therefore is to acquire a more elaborate understanding of the term 'unseen'.    To begin with, let us point out that the lack of knowledge about things does not necessarily mean that they do not exist. They may exist, but lie hidden behind the veil of the unknown. Later, either through the course of human investigation or through the agency of Divine revelation, they emerge from the realm of the unseen to that of the seen.    The term 'unseen' in its wider application is employed to cover everything which is not directly visible or audible. Likewise it also covers all that is not directly accessible through other human sensory faculties. In this respect we may also define the unseen as a domain which covers all forms of existence which lie beyond the direct access of the five senses. The things which belong to this category do not remain permanently inaccessible. They are inaccessible only with reference to a given period in time.     All hidden knowledge of perceivable things, whether it pertains to the past, the present or the future, lies within the scope of this category. In other words, we are required to believe in the existence of things which are not known at a given point in time, but do exist and may become known at another point in time. This belief cannot be dubbed as blind faith. The Quran does not require the believers to have faith in anything which is not supported by irrefutable arguments. Hence the unseen covers only such things as may become accessible through the instruments of reason, rationality and deductive logic. The point to be noted here is that the unseen as defined, though not directly perceivable by the senses, is yet verifiable. The rationale of this Quranic injunction is fully supported by human experience.    F THE MATERIAL FORMS of existence, there are many categories which defy direct examination. The knowledge of their existence and that of their physical properties can only be gained through logical deduction, or with the help of sophisticated electronic devices, which make them accessible to the senses, indirectly. What are neutrinos and anti-neutrinos? What is matter and antimatter? What are bosons and anti-bosons? The answer to these questions cannot be obtained through any direct means of examination, yet their unseen world has become a universally accepted reality. It should be remembered here that the mind is the ultimate entity of life, which receives and computes all messages transmitted to it by the senses through the computer of the human brain. Mind is not just another name for the brain. It transcends the brain and manipulates its operation.    The mind is the ultimate seat of consciousness. Deductivelogic is the most amazing faculty of mind. Even when there are no facts fed to it, it may continue to operate with hypothetical data. It can also operate by ruminating over the previously stored data. All decision making is done at the level of the mind, while the brain is merely a material hardware, a storehouse of memory. Moreover, the mind has the power to contemplate upon metaphysical and conceptual issues like infinity and eternity. It endeavours to resolve the enigma of a seemingly endless chain of cause and effect. Where did a certain thing begin and what lies beyond every beginning? Was there a first cause preceding all other causes? If so, was that first cause living and conscious, or was it dead and mindless? The only rational conclusion the mind can draw is that the first cause could not be unconscious and dead.    Again the question as to whether death can create life, and unconsciou|`|tqQIcLb5aa	"inference and deduction are part of our logical thinking, and it's rational to use them"    You have used logic to prove logic . . . ? and who says it's rational to use them? I agree with you that it is but reason, like faith, has no 'logical' premise except in that it is instinctive.    For as far back as we can trace reason in man we can trace religion also.    All great Theologians have argued that you need both reason and faith. Ethics does not arise from reason. If you build a society on reason alone you end up with Eugenics and Nazism.

To embrace one does not necessarily mean to forsake the other.|`|rFFYCmOGaa	I agree with most of that yes--I think you are on to something which is key towards understanding religious phraseology.    One way to test what a word really means is by seeing how it would function in different contexts. If a "gnac" (for the sake of this discussion) fits in a square and not a circle or a triangular slot, then chances are that it shares similar--if not the identical--properties with a square.     The word "faith" (Gk PISTIS) literally means "confidence" as opposed to "religion" or "belief." This can be tested by substituting "faith" for "confidence" in similar contexts.    Compare for example:    --I have faith that the stimulus package will solve the economic crisis.    --I have confidence that the stimulus package will solve the economic crisis.    --I have religion that the stimulus package will solve the economic crisis.  (what??)    --What is your religion?    --What is your confidence? (say what? people don't talk like that, do they?)    It is more logical therefore to say:    My religion is X    or     My belief is X    Rather than    My faith is X    This is why ALL religious debates should define their terminology before attempting to frame any arguments in support of their premises FIRST.    Otherwise such discussions will evoke a lot of "depends what you mean by (insert religious terminology)    Lastly, this wicked (I call it that because it is precisely how the Nazis sanitized their legal arguments in order to pass anti-Semitic laws during the 1930's) habit of switching the meaning from one word to another is not different from assigning good intents to not so good ones.    Like the knife wielding serial killer who says "I don't want to hurt you little girl, all I want to do is see what's inside your body."

Honestly, I think there's nothing wrong with the age difference...My sister is 23 and dating a guy that's 29, and they've been dating since she was 19. Personally, if someone told me they like me, I wouldn't ignore them for two days, but of course everyone's different and react in different ways to different situations. I'd just give it time, and he'll speak to you soon. Good luck! But of course, be careful since he's 19 and you're 16. Since you like him so much, you wouldn't want him arrested.|`|wb8WwWMNaa	Just give it time, he'll come to you if he wants you.  And yeah, maybe he's thinking about his options, only time will tell.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AbtCfY1caa	i think you can get him arrested since you are underage.  let it go, if there is still interest in 2 years then pursue.|`|ELSKfMpxaa	Most likely he sees you as jailbait. he's an adult you're not.

Most likely our parents, older siblings, and possibly a few influential teachers. I think we tend to remember the teachers who taught us more about personal development rather than any subject in school. Because they have touched us on such a personal level, they are more likely to stick out to us on a daily basis and we see the influence they had in our actions.|`|3gMytPXhaa	that depends upon our attitude and liking|`|hyPmgvntaa	dey always stay in touch to our heart coz  dey r de one's who hve helpd us in every respect of our studious life  wen we r in any fatal condition|`|9SgoJ4aDaa	BECAUSE WE ARE SO BUSY IN OUR DAILY WORK SO ONE OR TWO HONEST TEACHERS REMAIN ALIVE IN OUR HEART.

One who is skeptical about the existence of God but does not profess true atheism.  2. One who is doubtful or noncommittal about something.  adj.  1. Relating to or being an agnostic.  2.

The term agnostic was fittingly coined by the 19th-century British scientist Thomas H. Huxley, who believed that only material phenomena were objects of exact knowledge. He made up the word from the prefix a-, meaning "without, not," as in amoral, and the noun Gnostic. Gnostic is related to the Greek word gnsis, "knowledge," which was used by early Christian writers to mean "higher, esoteric knowledge of spiritual things"; hence, Gnostic referred to those with such knowledge. In coining the term agnostic, Huxley was considering|`|VcD1Q6cUaa	angry|`|FvoxgjbJaa	without|`|NxGqxsBvaa	Even though I am an agnostic, I've never really pondered meaning of the term.  But the a at the start of a word usually means none, lack of, missing, etc., as someone has already suggested.

12404275a6e62a47f2d36bd0fb0e6886aa	Yahoo! Answers first launched just over 3 years ago, and when a user was suspended, they lost *everything.* Mail access, pictures, etc ... all of it was gone.    People complained to Yahoo! about the unfairness of losing  10 years worth of mail, memories, work, etc.   when they had never done wrong in the past. Yahoo! had a change of heart.     It took about a year, but eventually, a suspension resulted in simply losing your Answers account. Everything else remains intact.    I know. I've been there.        ***They took your mail? You need to write to customer care and demand an explanation. They haven't been that petty in about  2 years.    As Gazoo stated, because one never knows what will happen, don't use an important account for playing around over here.  It's not worth the headaches.    ***My personal opinion is this: When Yahoo! decided to stop taking people's mail access, they admitted to themselves, and to us,  that their system of reporting and self-policing really is broken, and that they rarely (if ever) look into the reasons a question or answer was violated.|`|IqqaA2wIaa	no..  but who needs four accts??|`|nHizaTiDaa	No, I got to still keep the email account.

I wouldn't use an account that I cared about in any event.  It's pretty random, so there is no reason to take the chance.|`|77NzfiVkaa	Why does it matter where most accounts get suspended?

The writers of the episode said they were going tomake stuff up, but the real things the mormons believe was funny enough on it's own.  The same thing with the Scientology episode.|`|uxfacsgmaa	Yep! You can't make that stuff up. Well, Joseph Smith did - but you get what I'm saying. :)|`|ZX1nU9Vzaa	If you want to know how the Mormon religion started, read at the beginning of the Book of Mormon, the Testimony of the Prophet Joseph Smith, and in the Pearl of Great Price, read Joseph Smith History.

Its joseph first of all so if you cant even get his first name correct I wonder how correct the rest of your words are?|`|4rWPX8CTaa	Of course, but what they showed was only the tip of the iceberg of the tangled web of nonsense that Mormons have weaved.<br>  <br>  There once was a man named Joe;<br>  Many things he didn’t know.<br>  So he made up a story<br>  About angels and glory,<br>  And got folks to give him their dough.<br>  <br>  Mormons basically have to believe that a guy who lived in America in the early 1800's was a prophet of the Christian god and not a liar. That’s really the main tenet of the Mormon faith – believing this guy was not a liar; a supreme act of faith. His name was Joe Smith and he claimed he was visited by an angel who told him the location of golden plates buried in the ground with another biblical text written in an old language on them. He claimed he translated these golden plates and wrote the translation in the ‘Book of Mormon.’ He then claimed an angel took these golden plates to heaven when he finished translating them. During the translation, he claimed the golden plates were in his hat along with some magical rocks and he hid behind a curtain and talked aloud whilst holding his face in his hat and a guy who owned a printing press wrote down what he said. A lot of what Joe claimed was new biblical scripture was actually taken from the Old Testament. Here’s a link explaining the connection: <a href="http://www.utlm.org/onlineresources/bomnames.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.utlm.org/onlineresources/bomn...</a><br>  <br>  Now if you think this is weird; wait, it gets worse! What this Joe Smith claimed was written on these golden plates was that Native Americans are descendants of a lost tribe of Hebrews that somehow made it from the Middle East to the Americas over 2000 years ago. He claimed they founded civilizations and fought wars with each other and apparently Jesus even visited the Americas. DNA evidence alone proves that what this guy said about Native Americans being descendants of Hebrews is nonsense. There has NEVER been any evidence found of pre-Colombian Hebrew civilizations in America. Here’s a link to what the Smithsonian Institute has to say about the ‘Book of Mormon;’ <a href="http://www.lightplanet.com/response/Smithsonian-letter.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.lightplanet.com/response/Smit...</a> <br>  <br>  It's also a well established fact that before Mormonism came to be, Joe Smith used to trick people into thinking he could find buried treasure by holding a crystal up to his eye then putting his face in a stovepipe hat and receiving ‘spiritual information.’ That's the kind of thing Americans used to believe back then. They believed there was Spanish treasure buried all over the place and scammers like Joe Smith, who learned the trade from his parents, roamed around like carnies looking for gullible people, and in the USA, there was no shortage of gullible people...some would say, there is still no shortage today. This is how Joe made a living before he concocted the stories that he claimed were on the golden plates that no one else ever saw and convinced a publisher to write down his words.|`|jOwH96wKaa	LMAO, loved the whole looking into the hat thing.<br>  <br>  Part of me wishes it was all false, but it wouldn't surprise me at all if it were true.|`|FyLfEPv0aa	Was South Park an accurate documentary?<br>  <br>  Come on!|`|7mhRDbvsaa	yes..south park is always 100% accurate on religion|`|8jhACvtlaa	This question has been up all week!<br>  <br>  The only one I've seen (any only a small part of it at that) is the one where there are a bunch of people in Hell, and they're confused because they all thought they had the right religion.  It was pretty funny--the part that I saw.  But I don't think their depiction of Hell is accurate.|`|634jf1L4aa	The Southpark Episode was way off!  They got so many things wrong it was ridiculous.  Problem is I haven't watched that in a while so I can't point out too many things.  One thing I remember was Angel Moroni appeared to Joseph Smith and said he had to go find the plates.  It showed him digging around in the ground till he found them.  False!  Moroni actually told Joseph Smith specifically where the plates were located, he didn't just randomly find them.  There's a ton of things that were whack, which of course made it look stupid.  I am a member of the Mormon Church (The LDS Church) so you can take my word for it.|`|5MVQrmMfaa	lol...<br>  <br>  yeah, it won an emmy for best documentary....what a #*^&@!|`|iY6GQsRUaa	It is surprisingly accurate yes...|`|OLnmXeWDaa	You don't have to make stuff up to make Mormon history amusing.|`|lFzFtiCBaa	in a humorous way but for the most part, yes it was accurate.|`|gGd3v3M5aa	Haha, I would only believe half of what I saw Southpark portraying XD|`|xmy94psMaa	Rather shamefully so. I wish it weren't, but no. There are people that gullible on the planet.|`|3ba0ab7304ca31210254987d14dbe035aa	I never watch SouthPark.  I don't know how I happened to come upon this once on TV but I watched it.  It was dead on.|`|WyICbuPqaa	The South Park episode forgot to mention that Martin Harris did get to see the plates, and the angel Moroni, and that he heard the voice of God declare the translation to be correct, along with two other witnesses.  Known as the three witnesses, they testified to the truth of what they had seen their entire lives, and reafirmed their testimonies on their death beds.  Martin Harris lost his farm, lost his wife, and even lost his membership in the church, but never lost his testimony of what he had actually seen. <br>  I suppose that would have ruined the ending of the South Park episode ... ;-)
JTD3M8Ziaa	And the Christian god is no exception to this perversion...|`|SBL1t3ZSaa	Pagan people worshiped many gods and made Human sacrifices to them.<br>  <br>  The God of the Jewish Bible=Torah/Tanach condemned Human sacrifice of any kind, and God said over and over again that he is God, and there is no other.<br>  <br>  Tthis is the reason that Jesus could not have died to save anyone from their sins, even if they do believe in this teaching of Christianity.<br>  <br>  <br>  Numbers 23:19) "God is not a man that He should be deceitful, nor a son of man that He should relent.<br>  <br>  Isaiah 40:25) "To whom can you liken me that I should be his equal?" <br>  <br>  Isaiah 43:11) "I, only I, am God and there is no deliverer aside from me"<br>  <br>  Isaiah 45:5) "I am God and there is no other; other than me there is no God."<br>  <br>  Isaiah 45:21) There is no other god besides Me: there is no righteous god besides Me and no savior other than Me.<br>  <br>  Isaiah 45:22) Turn to Me and be saved all ends of the earth, for I am God and there is no other.<br>   this is one of the main reasons that Jesus could not have died to save anyone from their sins, even if they believe in this teaching of Christianity.<br>  <br>  Jesus was not the first god who was born of a virgin, performed miracles, was crucified and resurrected. Most Christians have not been educated about other religions, so they don't know that their God is a copycat version of those of other religions.<br>   <br>  Pagans have worshiped their own disciples for tens of thousands of years before Jesus was born. seeing the following Information about 3 pagan gods Horus, Saturn, and Mithra, it clearly shows That Jesus could have been a real guy, but all the acts he supposedly did, were done long ago, by pagan gods.<br>   <br>  1) All 3 Were all virgin born of a god and a mortal woman (isis was a mortal until osiris came in early traditions)<br>  2) All 3 Had 12 disciples<br>  3) All 3 Died to redeem mankind and were said to come again when man needed them<br>  4) All 3 had last suppers with their 12 disciples before they died of bread and wine.<br>  5) Horus walked on water to a group of fishermen to prove what faith in the "gods" can do<br>  6) Horus healed the sick, blind, and even raised a dead man named...lazarus (coincidence? I don't think so)<br>  7) Herod wanted to have Jesus killed, Herot wanted Hours killed, and Hers wanted Saturn and Mithra killed.<br>  <br>  "Nothing in Christianity is original. The pre-Christian God Mithras - called the Son of God and the Light of the World - was born on December 25, died, was buried in a rock tomb, and then resurrected in three days. By the way, December 25 is also the birthday or Osiris, Adonis, and Dionysus.

mMLci6LSaa	I used to be that way.  It was because I was a miserable person.  Now, when people act that way towards me, I am calm and patient with them because I know that they are unhappy.  I feel bad for them.  Vipassana meditation really helped me to control my emotions, and to be less miserable, no matter what the outside circumstances are.  <br>  <br>  Another trick I use, when I'm feeling especially unhappy, is to think of the bigger picture, outside of my small life.

9ozLBt5Qaa	Well some believe it to be a system too - the way they run things and need' people to 'revert' to it.    Something to know and think about: Islam has many parts. The allah god demands the killing of those who wish to come back to Islam - quite evil really.    1.Shia and 2.Sunni strains split within a generation after the death of Mohammed, over disputes about succession. Doctrinal differences are not great, but bitterness and persecution can be extreme. (eg under Saddam Hussein in Iraq)    3.Sufi Islam is more mystical and concerned with a personal relationship with the almighty.    4.Wahabi Islam arose in the 18th century in Saudi Arabia, and would probably have remained insignificant, and considered heretical by the mainstream, but for twentieth century oil wealth. Wahabiism adopts a much more hard-line interpretation of the Qur'an and Hadith, and indeed added requirements such as the covering of women and prohibition on them driving cars. The excesses of the Taliban in Afghanistan originated in Wahabiism, as does the al Quaeda terror campaign against the western world.|`|X548yCR6aa	No, a cult is following a charismatic leader while he is still alive.    A religion is continuing to do the same after the charismatic leader is dead|`|XN0cYCATaa	What is Islam?         Islam (1.2 billion adherents) is one of the major world religions that, along with Christianity (1.9 billion adherents) and Judaism (14 million adherents), teaches monotheism which is the doctrine that there is only one God in all existence.  Like Christianity and Judaism, Islam traces its roots back to the patriarch Abraham (Gen. 12).  The word "Islam" means "surrender" or "submission"1 and it comes from the root word "salem" which means "surrender."  A Muslim (or Moslem - which means one who surrenders to God) is an adherent of Islam, a religion with precise theological doctrines about God, judgment, heaven, hell, angels, prophets, salvation, etc.  The Arabic word for god is "allah" which has become a kind of name of God in Islam.  Islam teaches that Allah is the one and only deity in all existence (Qur'an 5:73; 112:1-4).  He is supreme, all knowing (40:20), ever-present, different from all of creation (3:191), and in complete control of all things.  According to Islam, Allah created the universe in six days (2:29; 25:61-62) and all that is in it continues to exist by his permission and will.  Allah is non-Trinitarian (5:73), absolute, and eternal.    http://www.carm.org/islam/whatisislam.ht...|`|vcx06TdQaa	if you don't follow islam, you're supposedly a heathen    so yes, I would say it is a cult|`|G6t2O9Kmaa	No.|`|2AqU4SjYaa	No . . . it is a major world religion . . . dating back over 1,000 years.

One could hardly see women wearing the burkha in cities like Tehran, Cairo or even Kabul in Afghanistan ( I recently saw newpapers articles that displayed pictures of Afgani women wearing miniskirts back in the 1960's ! ). But with oil money from saudi and other arab countries the strict version of islam called wahhabism has changed things in the muslim world and it is only getting worse to the extent that one can witness such changes in western countries.|`|a9255673c3ed5cb76b3cc823c2f5a42faa	I think it is like any other religion- a money making power seeking foundation that keeps women under heel and gets richer off the backs of the poor!

SECONDLY- I'd tell them to be careful on what they react to- some information is given with completely hidden agenda's and cannot be trusted- IN ALL RELIGIONS- GOD IS OPEN AND HONEST- there is no hidden secrets.  AND FINALLY- I'd like to say that - if you can't folow the rules of OUR country and abide alongside OUR CULTURES - THEN YOU DIDN@T OUGHT TO BE HERE- WHY ARE YOU HERE- is it to cowardly escape your own war torn country?

H6dPf9pzaa	That is actually a very interesting theory, but the only flaw would be explaining christianity's renown of Jerusalem, and noting the similarities of christianity, islam, and judaism. Other than that I have to note that jesus had to escape to egypt as a young boy or when he was in the womb (it has been awhile since I read the bible). <br>  Is it possible that mary, in delusion, considered herself a virgin and changed horus's name to jesus after christianity because she disliked egyptians or something...<br>  <br>  By the way, Jesus would most likely have been black and even possibly had "wool-like" hair.|`|806025c44dd8e27b6c1d544348b087c0aa	It doesn't matter whether Jesus was black or not. <br>  <br>  I do take issue with your conjecture that the Horus myth morphed into the person of Jesus, because there is no connection between the two which can be proven, nor has one ever been proven by reliable scholars citing original source material.  <br>  <br>  You fail from the get go -- because the Bible does not say when Jesus was born.  We don't claim he was born on 12-25, that was just the day set aside to celebrate his birth.  It could have coincided with the 4th of July for all the date actually matters.<br>  <br>  Anyone who confuses or connects "SUN" with "SON" is an idiot.  There is no such connection.<br>  <br>  Regarding the 3 kings/wisemen.  Again you fail due to your lack of scholarship.  Nowhere in scripture does it give the number of wise men visiting Jesus.  So how would that be a connection to 3 kings attending Horus (IF you can even show where that connection exists).<br>  <br>  Further, Horus might have been murdered but wasn't crucified, and neither was he resurrected by his own power, as was Jesus. Not to mention the fact that Horus did not really exist as a human, but Jesus did.<br>  <br>  These rumors have long been refuted, and adequately so -- to keep perpetuating them as you are doing here shows a distinct lack of research on your part.  When you have to jump from point A to point G without any connecting material that can be documented, the documentation just isn't there and hence the connection does not exist.<br>  <br>  Further, you apparently got all this from Zeitgeist, which is an editorial piece (and badly researched at that), not a documentary.<br>  _____________<br>  Edit: Horus did not have 12 helpers. He had 4 semi-gods helping him.<br>  <br>  There is no extant story which tells of Horus walking on water. <br>  <br>  No extant story of Horus being crucified between two criminals, either. <br>  <br>  It is a huge leap of inference to say that Lazarus (who had a family whom Jesus knew and was friend with) was copied from someone else, just because some of the letters of another's name might be the same.|`|29X6EEsKaa	Jesus, black not white, if he existed.

That's a lot of reading.<br>  <br>  "And I do agree that most historians believe that he was a Jew, but whether he was from Jerusalem (nationality) or just of the Jewish religion it’s believed he was born in a region of the world were people had color."<br>  <br>  ~~From a Christian standpoint, Jesus would have had to be Jewish in order to live a sinless life.  Yes, Jesus likely had a tan, but as to his actual nationality, does that matter?  Maybe he was just a lot paler than those around him, which is why it was written that way... to show the stark contrast between him and the rest of the population.  Remember, he only got half of his DNA from Mary, the other half was spiritually divined from God... and God can make his son any color he wants to.<br>  <br>  "To have been born on December 25th of virgins"<br>  <br>  ~~Well, most Christians that are educated on their faith will tell you that 12-25 is not Jesus' actual birthdate.  The change took place during the early centuries after Jesus' death.  In an attempt to popularize Christianity and phase out paganism, Christ's birthday was literally moved to another date that corresponded with the pagan holiday.  I don't think Jesus would mind us celebrating his birthday late.<br>  <br>  As for the rest of your question, well I have no answer.

NMi1AZbqaa	I am terrified of demons too.  But logically I know there's nothing to be afraid of..    I believe that demons can only enter you if you give them a pathway, as in like partaking in we-gee boards, hypnotism, mediums, etc. If you don't allow them to get at you they wont.    and to everyone else that keeps saying that only religious people get possessed that is sheeeeet. I've heard of many story's of atheists and agnostics being possessed.   I guess they'll never understand -__-    Anyhow, nothing to worry about bub.

And people that perform "exorcisms" are bigger frauds then Benny Hinn.|`|E9chZY74aa	Yes and No.  Did it happen?  Yes, God allowed Satan more influence on earth as He allowed Him to influence earth by walking on it.  But, after the resurrection, by studying Acts, one can see that demon possession ceased by the middle of Acts and we are never given the directive of how to drive out demons.  But, James 1 tells us how Satan influences us today and it is the same as was in the garden, to Job and the temptations of Jesus.  It is the lust of the eyes, the lust of the flesh and pride.  These are Satan's only  weapons today.  Your mind is the battleground and God has given you mental armor of the word to repel Satan's arrows.|`|8gveZWbHaa	No    All the evidence points towards "possession" being different forms of mental illness.

I think people have to open themselves up to demons [eg some mediums can be demon possessed] and to be in a pretty bad way to become demon possessed.    The thing that can happen is that people/preachers jump on the band wagon and blame behaviours on a demon, when really it is a bad choice they have made and they need to take responsibility for that bad choice[s]    More people probably need deliverance from lies than they do demons!|`|AA11521494	It is certainly very real.  However, the vast majority of cases are easily explained as something else - a mental fit, perhaps.  A demon will only "get in" if you give him or her a pathway to do so.  This can happen from misguided attempts at witchcraft or magick, or a deep interest, or invoking one.  It is very unwise to try and communicate with a demon unless you know exactly what you are doing.  If you're terrified of it and will have nothing to do with it, you will be very very safe from it ever happening.|`|vWbbNd6Baa	Only happens in the movies.|`|18a5d7e369330da3a47ede67c6e1e096aa	My college roommate (and also long time friend of mine) confided in me that he had what he called a demonic experience.

I want to state that my friend is a very level-headed, logical and perceptive person. Furthermore, I was the only person other than his parents who knew about this experience. He was not trying to prove anything about him or his faith and wasnt looking for sympathy either. He worked through it by remaining in faithful community with his family and the Lord.

When I hear the word "Belfast" what comes to mind is Harland and Wolff, the Orange Order, Shankill Road,the peace process and the fact that I never heard the words "Galvachy Road" (apologies if the spelling in wrong) on the news without it being preceded by the words "mainly Nationalist".     The Troubles for me means the Nationalists/Catholics and the Unionists/Protestants fighting as the Unionists wanted N.I. to remain part of the UK while the Nationalists wanted N.I. to be part of Eire. I have never researched beyond what I have heard on the news so please excuse my ignorance - no offence intended.|`|C0yagFFoaa	i  feel happy that the troubles are over. i never thought it would happen, but i feel so happy, and now northern ireland can have their own parliament in stormont. so i feel optimism.

There are places in the world where Christians are truly persecuted, such as Islamic and Communistic countries. There may be a few isolated incident in the US, where it happens, though I can't think of any examples off the top of my head. Harassment is somewhat more common, though far from the norm. I think what most people call persecution here is an attempt by a few to deligitimize Christianity and force it behind closed doors. That or just plain rudeness.|`|S0c2MR5Gaa	I believe persecution is happening in other countries where Christianity is banned and it's believers are being tortured and even killed for believing in it. that is not yet happening here in the US but that day is coming soon!

In fact right love does not need anything but only feelings of right. Where love is high, there selfishness is Low. Just only faith is not enough to be right. We need real Evidence. Right..?  So,   Spiritually,   What is God?  Whats makes God as god?    Well, just try to know, whats makes God as god, the Power, isnt it? So what the power can do? Ah? Well, it can give the ability to organise all things & it can give the ability to separate everything & most importantly, the Ability to control everything, isnt it? Isnt it good? Ah? So, from our hard study & research effort with the help from god, we realized that the ability to control everything, the Power of God is gradually increased in the full amount to use so; The Power of God is always the omnipotent & existed among everything. & The God now is always the same omnipotent for us, who is organised us & we are growing towards perfection. The perfection is the final stage, not the end. & The Power of God, the Ability is the reward for us to control everything in a proper manner, like the true God of goodness. & Everlasting Happiness is the final stage. & it cannot come alone without the final stage perfection of God. & if god always perfect in perfection then there have to be beginning with God for the organizing progress of all things. So, there is No end & also No beginning for all things, including this on going organizing progress. So, we cannot get anything from nothing. All are energy. E=MC2     If you dont still agree,   Note  this:  you can use any thing for Good or Bad so, whenever possible If you ask the god for the good reason to give you the ability perfection, because of your obedience, then the God will give you, if the god is Almighty.       If you are humble, Please, Pray to know the truth from true God by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit with great faith. Good or bad, Good with bad. God gave us the rights to do what is right for you & sometimes, things can be right in your point of view but wrong in Public point of view so Basically, we & god can do anything for right reason but just pray about it for the Good Answer and try to do the God's will first always.    Just think, why so much trouble & pain in this world? Then there is only one reason, without pain, no pleasure, without them, we cannot enjoy this life so always we need them. You use pain & pleasure instead of, they use you. You have to be certain to win in order to succeed in your Best job. If possible, keep the photo of your vision. The vision of your future should be clear & feel it strong enough in your visualizing mind & your desire for success should be greater than your fear of failure. & Love is the Ability. When we do repetitive actions somehow our State of mind has to be new as we did the first action. & we all make mistakes so it is hard to look for star in daylight. So just in faith, it is possible. Like that the faith in true God. Because of Lack of faith in true God, we do not have the great gift of understanding of things. All things are spiritually first, to govern by God with glory. Have a look at this world of wonders of yours & then you know the truth, when you listen to your real voice. & having a strong desire to do the best every day then stick with the best to do your best & most importantly, try to be grateful for what you have now to get out of fear & doing your best & making good people as a powerful influential person / leader, this is going to make your life winning.    The Law of mercy cannot rob the Law of justice so Justice demands the punishment of our sin but The Law of mercy requires the forgiveness to give to us & God is perfect in perfection so cannot violate his laws so The God provided the way to our salvation to overcome our sin so Jesus Christ sacrifice is much needed to return to live with God, so Jesus Christ is our savior.    Did you make the commitment to find joy in every moment by using your empowering meanings & conscious focus for the needs of your five senses?  Did you make this promise; I will never going to settle less than I can be?  Do you have the must realistic measurable rules, goals & best clear image of what you really want in all aspects of your life?  Do you live your life as a mission for your vision purpose?  Breaking down your vision into mini-goals & give must time for them regularly  Write it down the answers to be more real  Try to know all the basics to manage your life & Ask: Is it enjoyable? Rather than believing the progress is hard  Be aware of your believe which is holding you back to take actions   The Power is focus; choose wisely  http://in.youtube.com/watch?v=O061waey5g...

Which is it? Is skepticism or faith on the ascendancy in the world today? The answer is: Yes. The enemies are both right. Skepticism, fear, and anger toward traditional religion are growing in power and influence. But at the same time, robust, orthodox belief in the traditional faith is growing as well. The non-churchgoing population in the United States and Europe is steadily increasing. The number of Americans answering no religious preference to poll questions has skyrocketed, having doubled or even tripled in the last decade. A century ago most United States universities shifted from a formally Christian foundation to an overtly secular one. As a result, those with traditional beliefs have little foothold in any of the institutions of cultural power. But even as more and more people identify themselves as having no religious preference, certain churches with supposedly obsolete beliefs in a infallible Bible and miracles are growing in the United States and exploding in Africa, Latin America, and Asia. Even in much of Europe, there is some growth in church attendance. And despite the secularism of most universities and colleges, religious faith is growing in some corners of academia. It is estimated that ten to fifteen percent of all the teachers and professors of philosophy in the country are orthodox Christians, up from less than one percent just thirty years ago. Prominent academic Stanly Fish may have had an eye on that trend when he reported, "When Jacques Derrida died [in November 2004] I was called by a reporter who wanted to know what would succeed high theory and the triumvirate of race, gender, and class as the center of intellectual energy in the academy. I answered like a shot: Religion." In short, the world is polarizing over religion. It is getting both more religious and less religious at the same time. There was once a confident belief that secular Europe countries were the harbingers for the rest of the world. Religion, it was thought, would thin out from its more robust, super-naturalistic forms or die out altogether. But the theory that technological advancement brings inevitable secularization is now being scrapped or radically rethought. Even Europe may not face secular future, with Christianity growing modestly and Islam growing exponentially.|`|G30RhfZiaa	Christianity has reached an all time low in America.

At the moment, I am busy thinking about this ship. People tell me there is a big ship, it contains <br>  different goods on board. There is no one to steer it, no one maintaining it. Yet, this ship keeps going back and forth; it even traverses big waves on the oceans; it stops at the locations that it is supposed to stop at; it continues in the direction that it is supposed to head. This ship has no captain and no one planning its trips." <br>  <br>  The atheist who posed the question interrupted and exclaimed, "What kind of strange and silly thought is this? How can any intelligent person think that some thing like this can occur?" <br>  <br>  Imam Abu Hanifa said, "I feel sorry about your state! You cannot imagine one ship running without some one looking after its affairs. Yet you think that for this whole world, which runs exactly and precisely, there is no one who looks after it, and no one owns it." <br>  <br>  Hearing the reply, the atheist was left speechless <br>  <br>  next.....<br>  <br>  Isaac Newton, had invited a scientist-friend of his, a man who professed atheism to dine with him. Seeking to corner his friend with his own arguments, Newton placed a model of the solar system on his table and invited his friend to view it. Upon examining it, Newton’s friend exclaimed, “what a marvellous craftsmanship!” Who fashioned this exquisite model?” Newton replied casually, “This model has no maker, it materialised from nothing.” Disbelief writen large on his face, the friend asked, “What do you mean?” To this, Newton smiled and replied, “How can you my friend, insist that this model has to have a maker, while vehemently denying the existence of a divine Creator?”<br>  <br>  Moral: If a model of the solar system must have a creator then what about the gigantic solar system itself? Let us worship that Creator who has created you and me.<br>  <br>  next.........<br>  <br>  Once upon a time there was a king and he was a wise man too. In his kingdom used to live many other wise men. Now some of these would not agree to believe that God did exist, while others not only agreed but argued to the satisfaction of the King that there was 'God'. The King, being a wise man, arranged for a discussion.<br>  <br>  The date and time for discussion was fixed. The king held his court at the appointed time on the appointed date. The non-believers assembled in his presence but the believing wise man did not come at the appointed time<br>  <br>  The people waited and waited till they lost their patience and uttered the words: "He has no arguments to advance in support of his conviction, so he will not come. He has lost, we have won."<br>  <br>  At last, the wise man arrived and there was an uproar in the court of the king. The people cried: "Why are you late? You have lost".<br>  <br>  The king asked him to explain the cause of his delay. The believing wise man explained, saying: "I started from my home in time, but when I came by the side of the river which I had to cross before reaching here, I did not find a single boat, by which I could cross and reach the opposite bank".<br>  <br>  Upto this point the disbelieving men heard him patiently and did not say a single word. The believing man then continued:<br>  <br>  <br>  "I waited and waited till at last I saw some planks of wood coming out of the river".<br>  <br>  And the unbelieving men began to shout "O, It is a lie. It is unbelievable. It is unthinkable".<br>  <br>  Continued the believing wise man: "Plank by plank came out of the river and then I saw the planks were cut to proper size and shape and joined to each other with nails by themselves until they formed a boat. And then I took my seat in it and came over to the other bank. I am late because of the delay in the availability of the boat".<br>  <br>  Amid a roar of the non-believing men, the believing wise man tried to convince them of the cause of the delay; but the opponents would not believe him. Then he said:<br>  <br>  "You do not believe what I say. It appears the story of the boat forming by itself is something impossible for you to believe. Now in the name of justice, I ask you. Do you see the earth, the sun, the moon, the stars and the skies? Every thing is set according to a plan. But you say it came into existence without a Creator. In other words you deny the existence of God. How far is your statement reasonable and justified?<br>  <br>  This silenced them all and there was no answer to this. So the non-believers lost and the believer won.<br>  <br>  Well, let's see the most simple things "Chicken and eggs".....scientists do not have the answer which one exist 1st.....because chicken come out from egg, and egg come out from chicken.....Ok, no matter which is the answer, but who created the very 1st egg or the very 1st chicken? of course God, the creator.|`|hR7OsqtRaa	Who created Humans.?

That answer is very interesting to me.

That is when I became what is called "born again", born of the spirit in Christ.  I recognized that presence that had been with me all my life; it was Jesus.

AA10866651	Stereotyping people is when you make stupid generalizations about groups of people (i.e. All Asian people are short).

Aside from looking "Asian", the various Asian subcultures look nothing like each other.

It's not only happend millions of times, and we not only have "transitional fossils" to prove it, but human beings have observed speciation directly with living animals.  One such example is below, though dozens of others have been observed.<br>  So once again, you're either ignorant or willfully lying...which is it?<br>  <br>  Peace.|`|3EudCWEuaa	I guess it depends on how you define evolution.<br>  <br>  Evolution itself can be subdivided into several portions. Creationists do not call speciation "evolution." That is incorrect to assume. Everyone knows a species can change--that is observable. What hasn't been observed is the part where they claim eventually a species changes into another (a completely different species).<br>  <br>  Not only that, but they mostly reject the parts where it says that is how life began (which is abiogenesis-but also often used in the evolutionary theory as well.<br>  <br>  Simply because something can change or adapt, doesn't mean that is how life originated. Even if they did observe something change from one species to another, that doesn't mean that is how life originated.<br>  <br>  Unless they have a time machine, no one knows for sure.

But the recent fossil discovery of two new species point whales back to an altogether different group of hoofed creatures called artiodactyls. <br>  <br>  Discovered by University of Michigan paleontologist Philip Gingerich and a team of colleagues, artiodactyls have an even number of hoofed toes and include pigs, hippos, and ruminants such as cows.

But speciation, that is a species mutating far enough apart they are no longer able to mate, is happening every day. Speciation has technically happened with dogs already (or at least I wouldn't want to think of a great dane and a chihuahua breeding.) <br>  <br>  And there is such a ridiculous amount of evidence in fossils and DNA, I can't believe this debate is still happening.

Talk to your mom about it because you are of course going to need her permission and consent. Once you do that, you need to go to your local Family Court and fill out the paperwork. They will let you know what documents you need to bring. I'd assume you would need your birth certificate as well as your mom's just to prove that you aren't "making up a name" and you are taking your moms.  It does cost money, probably no more than $200, but I think with as much pain as you've been through, it will definitely be worth it.

Good luck|`|NleWQOqyaa	you can but you need parents permission and all this legal stuff...................it costs money too.|`|IcHmWDSCaa	Yea but you have to pay and your parents have to fill out a bunch of forms. It takes a while|`|hw5LuXTuaa	yes|`|IFXAlv7Uaa	Just wait til you're over 18, that'll cost your mom a lot of money mate...plus you are still your daddy's little girl :)|`|bmhnXEsVaa	Back in the early '90's I looked into changing my name & it cost $300.00. "Too expensive for me", I thought & decided against it. Two years later, I looked into it again, only to find the price had risen to $500.00! "Out of my price range", I reasoned while putting it off yet again. Two years later, I once again looked into it only to find it was now $700.00! I slapped down the $ & legally changed my name. Laws differ from state to state, so I suggest you contact your local court clerk who can best answer how much you might need to pay.<br>  BTW? While the first 2 years were rough with getting records officially changed (credit cards, social security card, license, Passport, bank accounts, medical records, etc), I have not regretted changing my name. I took on my Mom's maiden name & dropped my Dad's last name!<br>  I know at your age you don't have all these forms but your parents will have to deal with it. There are 2 documents you will receive that you must not lose! They are 1) the original signed court order that has the judge's signature & the oficially raised seal on it, & 2) Verification of Publication. It is required by law that your name change be officially published somewhere & you need proof that your name was oficially published, usually in some lawyers' newspaper or some obscure thing like that. Keep these documents in a safe place & make copies to give when dealing with paperwork.

TdROahUnaa	I have always beleived it was real!<br>  <br>  There are various different names for Atlantis all around the world, from Egyptions to the Mayan's they all had names for this place.<br>  <br>  Plato introduced Atlantis in Timaeus:<br>  <br>  For it is related in our records how once upon a time your State stayed the course of a mighty host, which, starting from a distant point in the Atlantic ocean, was insolently advancing to attack the whole of Europe, and Asia to boot. For the ocean there was at that time navigable; for in front of the mouth which you Greeks call, as you say, 'the pillars of Heracles,' there lay an island which was larger than Libya and Asia together; and it was possible for the travelers of that time to cross from it to the other islands, and from the islands to the whole of the continent over against them which encompasses that veritable ocean. For all that we have here, lying within the mouth of which we speak, is evidently a haven having a narrow entrance; but that yonder is a real ocean, and the land surrounding it may most rightly be called, in the fullest and truest sense, a continent. Now in this island of Atlantis there existed a confederation of kings, of great and marvelous power, which held sway over all the island, and over many other islands also and parts of the continent<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  THis is my favourite quote about it<br>  But at a later time there occurred portentous earthquakes and floods, and one grievous day and night befell them, when the whole body of your warriors was swallowed up by the earth, and the island of Atlantis in like manner was swallowed up by the sea and vanished; wherefore also the ocean at that spot has now become impassable and unsearchable, being blocked up by the shoal mud which the island created as it settled down<br>  <br>  <br>  I always figured it was swallowed up by a continental plate, seeing as the proposed location of atlantis conincides with the rift inbetween two plate boundries.|`|9XAqnmOQaa	Are you sure you woke up?|`|AA11311675	oh thats so cool !! :)|`|KnCcEfBpaa	Wow, that is interesting!

The scripture that you are speaking of at Gen 32:30 -Jacob was speaking of the angel that he grappled with, the angel that touched his thigh, causing him to have a limp. Jacob recognized this angel as being God because he seen that he wasn't human & that he was delivering a message from God. Yes, what's brought out in Exodus 33:20 is true. No man may look upon God's face and live. He is all powerful. It's not like the movies or a drawn out character that depicts God. God is the truth,  the creator of all things, the Alpha & the Omega. Even now when we pray to God, we pray through a median. That median being Jesus Christ.

OtLqGZK8aa	Some of us are white, some of us are Native American/Indigenous, some of us are black, or asian, or even all of the above mixed together. So the white ones or predominantly whites ones (like myself) are considered white Hispanics. White Hispanics account for about only 1/3 of all Hispanics.<br>  <br>  EDIT: I can't believe so many people on here are so ignorant, how can they not know that there are white Hispanics? lol And then for them to say "Are whites considered Latinos?" xD It just makes me laugh, but I also feel bad for them. <br>  <br>  There are whites Hispanics in every Latin American country, maybe not in the same numbers but there are some. Since we are speaking of Latinos, Brazilians are also Latinos and Brazil has the largest amount of Whites in Latin America and after that comes Argentina and then Mexico but if you change it to percentage, Uruguay is "whiter" than all other Latin American countries.<br>  <br>  Another thing I forgot to mention is that Brazil, a country whose people are all Latinos, is the country with the 3rd largest amount of whites in the world after the US and Russia. So... who says Latinos can't be white?<br>  <br>  <br>  <3 : Agreed :)|`|S6MqrWdjaa	latino means latin american in usa <br>  <br>  latin is an ancient language which italians are most related to.<br>  <br>  the overwhelming majority of latinos are of visible mixed race heritage. there are not many white latinos excluding argentina.<br>  <br>  edit whoa thumbs down for the truth. haha latinos can be black too who cares. google any latin american country and tell me there demographics have all mixed majority and the ones that claim white are still mixed they just claim it for status.<br>  <br>  edit the majority of mexico is what mixed race yeah thats what i thought who cares about a couple white neighborhoods that is a small piece to a big puzzle.<br>  <br>  edit the only country that speaks latin still is certain parts of italy. every other place is just biters.|`|ohUm00RYaa	Well mostly latinos are mixed with native american and white.

There are 23 hispanic countries, 22 latin american countries, and 21 spanish-speaking countries. The reason why you know very light-skinned spanish people is because they're probably from the Caribbean, and in the Caribbean there are 3 hispanic countries (Cuba, Dominican Republic, and Puerto Rico). I was born in Puerto Rico, and over there there are people who are very dark-skinned with naturally blonde hair, and people who are very light-skinned with blue eyes and naturally nappy hair. In the Caribbean it's very mixed in general, just like in the United States. There are Americans who are considered "white" and also Americans who are considered "black".|`|QepcG34Vaa	Yes, white stands for color of skin. Many latinos consider themselves white, mestizo, and less frequently black. Because most latin countries have a mixture of spain and indigenous people, and less frequently african american(some latin countries do some dont). Just like you (im guessing you're american) have a mixture of many diferent races.<br>  <br>  Aditional Info- Latinamericans are any people who were born in any latin country in america, wich includes part of North America (Mexico), (Puerto Rico, Cuba, Dominican Republic) (Even though those countries are in the carribean they are part of North America), Central and South America. Not all latinos speak spanish as th main language (Brazil). But Latino stands for any language derived from latin (portuguese, spanish) They also share that they colonized by Spain.|`|B0GujA9Aaa	This is a tricky question. In America, Latinos are considered not white. Because most Americans think that all Latinos are Mestizos. <br>  <br>  But in South America they divide Latinos up into different groups according to how much white (European) heritage they have.<br>  <br>  Here's the list: <br>  <br>  Penisulares- people who were born in Spain. <br>  <br>  Creoles- people who are of Spanish (European) decent who were born in South America.<br>  <br>  Castizos- a person with one Spanish parent and one Mestizo parent.<br>  <br>  Mestizo- a person who is half Spanish (European) and half Native American.<br>  <br>  Biracial- person with one African parent and one Spanish parent.<br>  <br>  Cholo- a person with one Mestizo parent and one Native American parent. <br>  <br>  Indian/Native American- person with both Native American parents. <br>  <br>  Zambo- a person with African and Native American heritage. <br>  <br>  African- person with parents who are of African decent.|`|cb88569354fa813399bd99b338324ae4aa	It depends. We come in all kinds of colors mainly bc of the influence spain (and france, in some latin-american countries-- like la batalla de puebla incident) had in latin-america. These individuals have inter-married the indigenous natives of latin-america  and as a result you have a huge pile of mixed people that later became to be known as a race, when in reality they're a mix of two races--- well a lot of us. Some stayed within their race. Also, slavery from africa brought over blacks that also inter-married or stayed within their peoples. So, when you think "latino" or hispanic, dont think of race, think of language, really.|`|pfke6Jieaa	according to US census they are considered hispanic/latino. but there are many who are considered white such as argentina and some cubans. and they can also be black like some dominicans and puerto ricans. hispanic is not a race its a culture.|`|AA10700334	I am Latino and have a very light complexion but I do not consider myself white.

That is if they have European decent too though. If you are a Latino look at your records and it will most likely say white. These people have no clue what their talking about.

For example, Puerto Ricans are a mixture of African, Spaniard, Taino Indian, even French, Italian...so I usually check off all the boxes. Just to make a point. :-)|`|bda465ikaa	The term "white" is a cultural term, and not a scientific one. So you have to rely on political definitions. The United States census department has a definition of "white": White. A person having origins in any of the original peoples of Europe, the Middle East, or North Africa. It includes people who indicate their race as "White" or report entries such as Irish, German, Italian, Lebanese, Near Easterner, Arab, or Polish.<br>  =========<br>  The overwhelming majority of Mexicans have ancestry from Europe and from the indigenous people of Mexico. Some of them are of almost pure European stock, and a sizeable percentage are overwhelmingly indigenous.<br>  ----------------<br>  The OMB defines Hispanic or Latino as “a person of Cuban, Mexican,<br>  Puerto Rican, South or Central American, or other Spanish culture<br>  or origin regardless of race.” <br>  =========<br>  So by the census department definition, Latinos can identify themselves as white or something else if they desire. The crucial thing about census department data is that you are self-identifying. You can call yourself anything you want, and there is no test that can overrule you.<br>  =====<br>  Someone watching television in Mexico would swear that the entire country is full of light skinned European looking people.<br>  --------<br>  Argntines are latino, but are overwhelmingly of European stock. There just aren't that many in the US.

eafd9a513da7d400ed1f4cfda63c62f5aa	This is a tough situation and a sensitive one as well. The fact that your manager and her have a close relationship is a great RED FLAG for you. All I can say is ignore it and just work hard. There is really nothing you can do at this point. She obviously feels a bit threatened by you, and doesnt want you to have a better relationship with the manager. Most woman dont like to see other woman excel or dont feel secure about their competence so feel threatened if anyone else comes along that is just as smart and hard working.  Its unfortunate, but true. I would just leave it alone, if you bring it up you'll be considered caddy, or even jealous.. then how would you fix that one. Just be professional, work with her and ignore any negative comments she makes..eventually people will catch on to her, and she'll be the one looking like a jealous co-worker!.|`|Gojbv3Nraa	Till yesterday, I thought for a brief time that I might just join them, if they're gonna do it. They even do it to my face sometimes as if to say, You can't stop me. :D  Women are mean, and they don't like optimistic people who want to do stuff right even if they aren't always right. They think such people are freaks, I guess. Oh well. <br>  <br>  Now I think...I will just watch my step and not be bitter with them or talk bad...and just keep working...and hope for (aim for, have goals set at) my best....<br>  <br>  You should too.<br>  <br>  It really already was in the toilet for you before you entered the scene if they were already friends and one did not want to include you. Too many women do not want to share resources and cannot perceive others as simply working to benefit the team, not just selves...coz most women only care about selves! and are afraid their resources (friend that is a boss, for example) will be depleted (used by someone else.)<br>  <br>  Be careful about talking with a boss coz I did that, and now that supervisor is like, more syrupy than ever and looking for the slightest mistake and everyone else is on the bandwagon wth her. Almost makes me want to transfer after all, coz yes, I want that store to work at specifically, and that job, but I also have to be able to take care of my family and can't do it if someone decides to try to get rid of me, LOL. (That LOL is not really a laugh so much as a sigh of discomfort....)|`|Ra8cdjbDaa	People are always like this no matter where you go!  I agree, it is better to work with men most of the time because most of them aren't catty gossips.  The last place I worked was full of these kind of people, both the men AND women.  The way I dealt with it was to go home, blow off steam in some way, but just live with it at work.  Don't get into situations where they can make up lies about you... don't engage in gossip about other workers, even if you have to do the unpopular and say, 'I don't want to talk about so and so."  <br>  <br>  This kind of person will eventually tire of you because you don't give them any material to work with.<br>  <br>  I just transferred to another place withing my unit and it is pretty much ALL women.  They began by the cold shoulder routine, (yawn) and over the last week or so have moved on to the game where they are trying to get me to say something about the other so they can run and pass on the comment. (double yawn)  I dunno... I guess I am at the point in my life that i couldn't care less about being "in" at work so I just stick to myself, do my job, the go home and enjoy my life. <br>  <br>  :)|`|Ag0jb7Neaa	sorry this is happening to you<br>  catty things like this can MOST definitely happen in an office, it's just the way it goes<br>  <br>  but not all women are like this<br>  seems you've had a bad experience...or should i say bad experienceS? but that shouldn't leave you to dislike working with all women<br>  <br>  there might be harassment policies and procedures at your workplace. in canada we typically have things in place to protect workers from this kind of stuff. hopefully where you live you can access the same kind of protection<br>  <br>  best of luck|`|Z7KRAzbeaa	The woman who is talking about you is not your friend, and neither is your boss.  I wouldn't trust either one of them.  I would not socialize to the point where I am confiding about my personal life.  Do your job really well, the best that you can.  Most people who talk behind other's backs are seen for what they are...they only make it so far up the corporate ladder and usually have few true friends, if any.  I think you should focus on doing your job, and if you cannot stand the situation then start to look for a transfer to another department.  Working for men has it's own stereotypical problems too.  The successful women I have seen are so busy doing their jobs, they don't have time for "catty" conversation and backstabbing...although I know it does happen.  Usually the people standing around talking are not the ones being promoted.<br>  <br>  Also, how do  you know you are being talked about if you are not there?  Are you going to say "so and so said blah?"  Then you are dragging other people into it and it may not be true at all.  Maybe this instigator who is saying people are talking about you is making it all up just to unnerve you or get you to confront the boss.  Best advice:  don't do anything about silly gossip.|`|ee84f878d59734da208adb9eb82587a9aa	Gossiping about others is often viewed negatively, so she's probably doing more harm to herself than she is to you by doing so.<br>  <br>  You could be confrontational and tell her "if you have a problem with me, discuss it with me, not Joe and Jenny" but on the other hand you can't control anyone's speech. Whoever has firing authority can though. Employees can be fired for any reason as long as it isn't illegal (such as firing because of age, gender, religion, etc.) It's feasible to enact an office wide rule that "anyone who gossips will be fired."|`|mQZDizMVaa	"We are both very close friends with our manager, but she has been friends with her longer, and they are, in my opinion closer friends."<br>  <br>  This is the key sentence-and it's almost in every workplace.<br>  <br>  Careful what you say to your manager. She could be sharing your info to your coworker, and vice versa. You may not see them talking to each other-but they could call each other on weekends/after work/holidays.<br>  <br>  How do you know your coworker's talking about you behind your back? Did someone tell you? <br>  <br>  I also worked with a devious, back-stabbing coworker. I 'survived' by ignoring her, doing my work, maintaining my professionalism and therefore the respect of other coworkers, and keeping my eye on the prize-freedom from her at 5:00.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|mF0L5jMNaa	Diffuse her efforts with humor;  "Now don't talk about me when I leave".

Now, I'm not saying you're imagining things. I'm just wondering if this is coming from a "feeling" you're getting. OR is it some other bitty that is telling you this stuff so she can be YOUR friend more? Oh boy, it goes round and round, doesn't it? <br>  <br>  I wouldn't try to involve the manger anymore, b/c she doesn't want to get into it. (so it seems). So, I'd stay away from the subject of the other person with the mgr. All together. stay away from it with her.<br>  <br>  Bringing it up only causes her grief AND makes you look like the one with the problem. And, or, it may bring her to a feeling of having to make a decision or a choice. You don't want to be the one to put her in that position.<br>  <br>  It's really hard when you spend so much time with a bunch of women what ?a third of your life? (unsure of the % we do at work). <br>  <br>  The good thing is, you understand the fact that this is all just a disfunctional family of sorts. SOME women don't have a clue and really get into the office polotics. They don't realize how unhealthy it is.<br>  <br>  If you don't already have one, get one. A support system outside of work! Friends and family.<br>  But try not to bog them down with this junk either. (I'm a little fragmented here, sorry). <br>  <br>  I guess what I'm trying to say is, do the best job you can. Focus on your work rather than the employees.  <br>  <br>  Make sure you have a lot of fun, entertainment, good times outside of work! This way you won't feel the need to gather your "good feelings" from the people you work with. That's all they are. People you work with.<br>  The more you keep it that way, the better off you are.|`|ZYzhBhgJaa	I know exactly what you mean, I hate working with women for the same reason. I am a woman. But women are petty & nitpicky. I volunteer at my kids school, strictly in the classroom, and avoid the PTA moms for that reason, and the one time I did interact with them, their pettyness just confirmed what I already knew. I know it's not the same as working, you really don't have as much room to walk away. Someone told me that the best revenge is living well. Don't reduce yourself to her level. If you are aware of her issues, then those around her are aware as well, and will most likely not value her opinion of you. For those that do 'side' with her (for lack of a better word), I have always loved silently proving people wrong. Let those around you see what makes you a strong minded & personable person through your own actions, and you will be more respected for letting them see that without reducing yourself to her cattyness. I don't think women will ever be able to restrain themselves, at least they haven't been successful so far, just wash that away at the end of the day, and know that the view of a few petty bitches does not in any way define you.

9umpVItqaa	God is love. Being created in his image gives us the ability to love. That is why we have remorse for people less fortunate. That is way we came together during the 9\11 catastrophe. You have to know that he exist. Otherwise we wouldn't have oxygen to breathe. Out of all the planets earth is the only one that provides oxygen. Earth is also just at the right distance from the sun, so that we don't burn or freeze to death. People have doubts because of the problems we have today. These problems are self inflicted. If everybody came together to serve God, we wouldn't have half these problems. People don't seem to believe that satan has the world under his influence. That why it's so hard for some to believe in God. That's what satan wants. For you not to believe. We need to use our common sense. In not believing in just what we see with our eyes, but believing in our hearts.  We need to ask God to guide us so that we are not influenced by satan, so that we will be able to see through the negative views of the world.|`|hR7OsqtRaa	Who created Humans.?

Every religion that started at our origins is certainly dead by now. Meaning that religions are temporary and any religion around today has a birthday, before which, no one ever heard of them. Your religious preference is determined completely by where you grew up, and that shouldn't be the case if there is one true God who exists everywhere. There is just as much proof for God as there is for any other imaginary thing I can think of, and that isn't enough proof. A lot of people believing it until they die isn't enough to persuade me.|`|jkoUoWOBaa	i believe in God 110%!!!<br>  recently i've been feeling down and it seems like he doesn't want to help me during my troubles and he doesn't care, but i know that he is here for me and he DOES care. i've been blessed in many ways.<br>  <br>  for eg. when i was little (7 or 8) i went out for a walk and all of a sudden i see this HUGE pile of something, atm i didn't know what it was but as i get close, i see it's a pile of money!! dimes, quarters, nickles, etc. i got home and got a bucket. ALL the money fit in the bucket perfectly!!!! me and my mom put it in the paper rolls and there was about $38.00. it seems impossible but it really happened!!! no exaggeration. <br>  <br>  and......that's my story :)|`|6Zi7cA5Paa	The following are the reasons why i beleive in God:<br>  <br>  Isaac Newton, had invited a scientist-friend of his, a man who professed atheism to dine with him. Seeking to corner his friend with his own arguments, Newton placed a model of the solar system on his table and invited his friend to view it. Upon examining it, Newton’s friend exclaimed, “what a marvellous craftsmanship!” Who fashioned this exquisite model?” Newton replied casually, “This model has no maker, it materialised from nothing.” Disbelief writen large on his face, the friend asked, “What do you mean?” To this, Newton smiled and replied, “How can you my friend, insist that this model has to have a maker, while vehemently denying the existence of a divine Creator?”<br>  <br>  Moral: If a model of the solar system must have a creator then what about the gigantic solar system itself? Let us worship that Creator who has created you and me.<br>  <br>  Next............<br>  <br>  "Is there any proof that God exists?" was asked, by an atheist, of Imam Abu Hanifa and he replied, "Forget it! At the moment, I am busy thinking about this ship. People tell me there is a big ship, it contains <br>  different goods on board. There is no one to steer it, no one maintaining it. Yet, this ship keeps going back and forth; it even traverses big waves on the oceans; it stops at the locations that it is supposed to stop at; it continues in the direction that it is supposed to head. This ship has no captain and no one planning its trips." <br>  <br>  The atheist who posed the question interrupted and exclaimed, "What kind of strange and silly thought is this? How can any intelligent person think that some thing like this can occur?" <br>  <br>  Imam Abu Hanifa said, "I feel sorry about your state! You cannot imagine one ship running without some one looking after its affairs. Yet you think that for this whole world, which runs exactly and precisely, there is no one who looks after it, and no one owns it." <br>  <br>  Hearing the reply, the atheist was left speechles<br>  <br>  Next.......<br>  <br>  Once upon a time there was a king and he was a wise man too. In his kingdom used to live many other wise men. Now some of these would not agree to believe that God did exist, while others not only agreed but argued to the satisfaction of the King that there was 'God'. The King, being a wise man, arranged for a discussion.<br>  <br>  The date and time for discussion was fixed. The king held his court at the appointed time on the appointed date. The non-believers assembled in his presence but the believing wise man did not come at the appointed time<br>  <br>  The people waited and waited till they lost their patience and uttered the words: "He has no arguments to advance in support of his conviction, so he will not come. He has lost, we have won."<br>  <br>  At last, the wise man arrived and there was an uproar in the court of the king. The people cried: "Why are you late? You have lost".<br>  <br>  The king asked him to explain the cause of his delay. The believing wise man explained, saying: "I started from my home in time, but when I came by the side of the river which I had to cross before reaching here, I did not find a single boat, by which I could cross and reach the opposite bank".<br>  <br>  Upto this point the disbelieving men heard him patiently and did not say a single word. The believing man then continued:<br>  <br>  <br>  "I waited and waited till at last I saw some planks of wood coming out of the river".<br>  <br>  And the unbelieving men began to shout "O, It is a lie. It is unbelievable. It is unthinkable".<br>  <br>  Continued the believing wise man: "Plank by plank came out of the river and then I saw the planks were cut to proper size and shape and joined to each other with nails by themselves until they formed a boat. And then I took my seat in it and came over to the other bank. I am late because of the delay in the availability of the boat".<br>  <br>  Amid a roar of the non-believing men, the believing wise man tried to convince them of the cause of the delay; but the opponents would not believe him. Then he said:<br>  <br>  "You do not believe what I say. It appears the story of the boat forming by itself is something impossible for you to believe. Now in the name of justice, I ask you. Do you see the earth, the sun, the moon, the stars and the skies? Every thing is set according to a plan. But you say it came into existence without a Creator. In other words you deny the existence of God. How far is your statement reasonable and justified?<br>  <br>  This silenced them all and there was no answer to this. So the non-believers lost and the believer won.<br>  <br>  And also another one " Chicken and egg","Chicken comes out from egg and egg come out from chicken right? even scientists are unable to prove which one exist 1st......of course the 1st creations either chicken or egg must have the creator.........i beleive in Allah the only One True God who has created everything.|`|ADLwSuiCaa	God exists. no one can persuade me otherwise due to the fact that the bible has traveled from many many years ago all the way up until now and I bet it'll still be here when we we are dead and gone if the earth still stands and even if the world burned up into flames I bet it would still be abible around that wouldnt get caught in the fire. but anyways the bible tells us all the rules we should follow. Of course we dont follow them all because we are human which to me sonds like an excuse to not follow all of them, but nevertheless we still remain imperfect. And when we embody those bibical rules whatever ones you really follow I believe that that is activating his spirit inside of yourself so, if he live in you he's always alive. If you have enough bibical knowledge to kick to someone else its not you talking its him. HA! God is tight.|`|rbXCALUhaa	I believe that God exists, but not in the way that He is presented. I don't believe in the devil and miracles by the prophets, nor do I believe that we were created directly by God.<br>  There are things we can not explain, things that are literally beyond our understand like: how was the universe created?<br>  The only thing that people could say in order to justify the fact that humanity DOESN'T know something is to create a supernatural being that ''created'' everything. Science can't explain everything, but an almighty being can, hence, God.<br>  What happens after death, you might ask..?<br>  Well frankly I don't know, but seriously no one does. Be a good person, cherish every moment of your life, help where you can because that is the meaning of life.

I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16 tells us that the Bible was "breathed out" by God.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1: 11-12 tells us that the gospel was a revelation from Jesus Christ himself, which was recorded by Jesus disciples and Paul.<br>  <br>  God himself chose the disciples and the people whom He knew were going to spread His word and write the Bible.<br>  <br>  The Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 4000 years. Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors. The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvation—Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  What is so special about Jesus?

The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6.

In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father that was seen in the OT (John 6:46).

No one ever saw Jesus<br>  <br>  Really? How do you come to that conclusion? Do you think that the Bible was written all at once and people just put in stories? You may be interested to know that the majority of the New Testament contains copies of letters that were written by people who had seen the Lord Jesus to other people whom they had known. <br>  <br>  Consider the introductions to these writings if you will.<br>  <br>  Luke 1:1  Inasmuch as many have taken in hand to set in order a narrative of those things which have been fulfilled among us,  2  just as those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word delivered them to us,  3  it seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first, to write to you an orderly account, most excellent Theophilus,  4  that you may know the certainty of those things in which you were instructed.<br>  <br>  Acts 1:1  The former account I made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach,  2  until the day in which He was taken up, after He through the Holy Spirit had given commandments to the apostles whom He had chosen,  3  to whom He also presented Himself alive after His suffering by many infallible proofs, being seen by them during forty days and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God.<br>  <br>  The person writing was a Doctor who traveled with the Apostle Paul. He was writing to someone he knew named Theophilus. When you read the other gospel accounts and you read the letters that the Apostle Paul wrote to different churches, you see that they all support one another. It isn't like one kooky religious person made something up under the influence of drugs and eveyone just believed it.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.godandscience.org/apologetics/bibleorg.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.godandscience.org/apologetics...</a><br>  <br>  Thousands of early Christian writings and lexionaries (first and second century) cite verses from the New Testament. In fact, it is nearly possible to put together the entire New Testament just from early Christian writings. For example, the Epistle of Clement to the Corinthians (dated 95 A.D.) cites verses from the Gospels, Acts, Romans, 1 Corinthians, Ephesians, Titus, Hebrews, and 1 Peter. The letters of Ignatius (dated 115 A.D.) were written to several churches in Asia Minor and cites verses from Matthew, John, Romans, 1 & 2 Corinthians, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, 1 & 2 Timothy and Titus. These letters indicate that the entire New Testament was written in the first century A.D. In addition, there is internal evidence for a first century date for the writing of the New Testament. The book of Acts ends abruptly with Paul in prison, awaiting trial (Acts 28:30-31 (1)). It is likely that Luke wrote Acts during this time, before Paul finally appeared before Nero. This would be about 62-63 A.D., meaning that Acts and Luke were written within thirty years of ministry and death of Jesus. Another internal evidence is that there is no mention of the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 A.D. Although Matthew, Mark and Luke record Jesus' prophecy that the temple and city would be destroyed within that generation (Matthew 24:1-2 (2),Mark 13:1-2 (3), Luke 21:5-9,20-24,32(4)), no New Testament book refers to this event as having happened. If they had been written after 70 A.D., it is likely that letters written after 70 A.D. would have mentioned the fulfillment of Jesus' prophecy. As stated by Nelson Glueck, former president of the Jewish Theological Seminary in the Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati, and renowned Jewish archaeologist, "In my opinion, every book of the New Testament was written between the forties and eighties of the first century A.D."|`|Z5KvRSRCaa	1.

He was a Roman historian and has been described as the greatest historian of Rome, noted for his integrity and moral uprightness. His most famous works are the Annals and the Histories. The Annals relate the historical narrative from Augustus’ death in A.D.14 to Nero’s death in A.D. 68. The Histories begin their narrative after Nero’s death and finish with Domitian’s death in A.D. 96. In his section describing Nero’s decision to blame the fire of Rome on the Christians, Tacitus affirms that the founder of Christianity, a man he calls Chrestus (a common misspelling of Christ, which was Jesus’ surname), was executed by Pilate, the procurator of Judea during the reign of the Roman emperor Tiberias. Tacitus was hostile to Christianity because in the same paragraph he describes Christus’ or Christ’s death, he describes Christianity as a pernicious superstition. <br>  <br>  There have also been interesting archaeological discoveries as well bearing on the gospels. For example, in 1961 the first archaeological evidence concerning Pilate was unearthed in the town of Caesarea; it was an inscription of a dedication bearing Pilate’s name and title. Even more recently, in 1990 the actual tomb of Caiaphas, the high priest who presided over Jesus’s trial, was discovered south of Jerusalem. <br>  <br>  Of course the New Testament documents are the most important historical sources for Jesus of Nazareth. No modern scholar thinks of the gospels as bald-faced lies, the result of a massive conspiracy. The interval of time between the events themselves and recording of them in the gospels is too short to have allowed the memory of what had or had not actually happened to be erased.|`|f1e8a20a0e5d8904fb72bbeeeca190d8aa	No, I couldn't disagree more.

She was a nut who I sort of befriended because she had children. She is schizophrenic and started talking in some British accent. She would have her curtains open and you could see her vacuum the same spot for over an hour. I felt sorry for her till she waited for her ex to bring the children back holding an axe so she could bash out, yet another window.The police didn't do much 'cept haul her in for a couple hours. But when she left her 4 yr. cerebral palsy child alone in a wheelchair by herself to go bar hopping, I took her, called CPS till they finally gathered up those poor kids and took them to a receiving home. Their with dad now. Bad neighbors suck...|`|9449e10cc4bd54a354c906e0564176ecaa	The guy across the street from us likes to park his car out in the street.

Yet, he has to park his car in the street during the day, right in front of our driveway.<br>  <br>  We're pretty indifferent to the other neighbors.  They don't bother us, and we don't bother them.

hUhxjEWaaa	（て/を）下さい (kudasai)　is the most general and polite expression. くれ(kure)　is more like an order than a request and is mostly used by men with people they know. 頂戴 (choudai)　is not really that polite but is mostly used by women and children, though men have been known to use it to. Other expressions like 頂けませんか(itadakemasen ka)、下さいませんか(kudasaimasen ka)、くれませんか (kuremasen ka)、貰えませんか (moraemasen ka) などなど　also exist and have about the same meaning as 下さい. くれない（か） (kurenai ka)　and くれる (kureru)　are much less polite but could be used by women, unlike くれ。 貰う (morau), means receive but can be used in something like 教えて貰うか(oshiete morau ka)　-can I receive the favor of you telling me,this is less polite too. Some verbs for things you give other people like 遣る (yaru)、上げる (ageru)、授ける (sazukeru)、与える (ataeru)など、exist but all except 上げる are used for people and things below you. Many others for people both below and above you exist but are more obscure. ほしい (hoshii)　can be used to describe what you want someone else to do, in something like 貸してほしい (kashite hoshii)-I want you to lend me sth. Of course all the things I've listed here can be used for nouns with を　and actions with　～て（下さいetc.). There are also countless other words and details that exist that I haven't listed, though these are some of the more common.|`|NKKiaC3Naa	ちょうだい - choudai (more feminine/childish)<br>  かしてくれ - kashitekure (more masculine)|`|mUK240ykaa	下さい (ください, kudasai) : 'please give me', ' please do something for me'<br>  <br>  ちょうだい (chōdai) (usually used by females) : 'please give me'

ZFllYTlpaa	Jude Thaddeus Becomes a Saint<br>  <br>  “Jude, who is also called Lebbaeus, preached. to the people of Edessa, and to all Mesopotamia, and fell asleep [died] at Berytus, and was buried there” (Hippolytus of Rome [born ? A.D. - died 236 A.D.], ON THE TWELVE APOSTLES WHERE EACH OF THEM PREACHED, AND WHERE HE MET HIS END”, # 10). <br>  <br>  “In Persia, the birthday of the Blessed Apostles Simon the Canaanite and Thaddeus, who is also called Jude.  Simon preached the Gospel in Egypt, Thaddeus in Mesopotamia.  Afterwards, entering Persia together, they converted to Christ a numberless multitude of the inhabitants, then underwent martyrdom” (ROMAN MARTYROLOGY, The Twenty-Eighth Day of October). <br>  <br>  The reason why pictures and statues of Saint Jude Thaddeus depict him holding a club is that according to an ancient oral tradition he was killed with a club for the Catholic Faith, thereby becoming a Holy Martyr of the Catholic Church. <br>  <br>  Saint Jude Thaddeus is also depicted holding a cloth on which the face of Christ is imprinted because both an ancient and oral tradition claim that Christ gave Saint Jude Thaddeus a cloth with His image on it and then later sent him to King Abgar of Edessa in Syria to cure him of his incurable disease when the King saw this image of the Holy Face of Christ and when Saint Jude Thaddeus laid his hands upon the head of King Abgar.  This resulted in the holy Apostle curing many other people in that city and then preaching the Gospel to them.
rGEZup0Zaa	Servant of Jesus Christ, if your answer to this question is as inerrant as you claim the Bible to be, then it's time to go back to the drawing board.<br>  <br>  Mary was Henry's daughter, not his wife. There was no mass exodus to America during Mary's reign, for religious or any other reason.<br>  <br>  To address your question directly, Mary's burning of Protestants only made them more opposed to her rule, and when the time came for Elizabeth to assume the throne, she had a huge base of popular support.|`|AA11058044	Because trying to enforce a change in people's wills through terrorism has never worked, in the entire history of humanity.<br>  <br>  Humans are amazingly stubborn beasts.  If you try to get them to do something out of fear, pretty much 100% of the time, they will do the exact opposite.  It strengthens their resolve, gives them a target to direct their opposition at.<br>  <br>  Yet, the powerless and fearful still keep trying to use it as a tactic.  Maybe they think it's the only tactic available to them, but I am constantly stunned that every terrorist group throughout the world is apparently incapable of reading a history book.|`|qCtbizzPaa	It gave the Protestants more to resent about Catholicism.

lHg9ZqwJaa	*hypothetically*<br>  <br>  If your version of heaven had to include him, it only stands to reason that your "god" would have to either include him or deceive you...|`|jdRKZe18aa	Just as Christ told the thieves who hung beside Him on the cross "Today you will be with me in Paradise".... ALL of mankind goes to Paradise or the spirit world upon leaving this life.  All spirits will wait there, learning, progressing and WAITING until the 2nd coming of Christ and eventually judgment day.  <br>  <br>  In the spirit world I believe that those who have not yet come to know Jesus CHrist and His gospel will be taught and have an opportunity to accept it there.  No one will be going to HELL at ALL until the final judgment .  And just because your friend is an atheist  now just clearly tells ME that this is because he doesn't know the Lord yet - which he will have a chance to do after this life.    I believe we will ALL Be judged on who we ARE, who we have BECOME and the purity of our HEARTS not necessarily JUST on what we thought we knew or believed in this life.....|`|lh8Tn02Naa	This is very confusing.  Let's say I'm an evangelical atheist of the Richard Dawkins variety.  I don't keep my beliefs private, I mouth off at every opportunity because I KNOW there isn't a God and people who believe there is one are MORONS, OK?<br>  <br>  (I am not a Dawkins fan, I'm just answering the question here).<br>  <br>  Then I die.  I know this is the end of me.  I shall go to sleep and never wake up again.<br>  <br>  But I do.  And oh bug-ger, I'm in heaven!  The place I spent so much of my life telling people didn't exist!  Am I going to be annoyed about that, or what?  But hang on, if I'm annoyed, that's not exactly blissful, is it?  So if it's not blissful, it can't be heaven after all.  That's a relief.  But I'm still not dead any more, and I suspect that if there's an afterlife there must also be a God.  So my whole life was wasted!  I devoted it to a mistake!<br>  <br>  Atheists, in short, aren't going to be too happy to discover there's a heaven, if there is.  But you have to be happy in heaven, that's the point, isn't it?|`|AA11297267	Well, as an atheist I also don't believe there's any such thing as heaven or hell, because there's no evidence to indicate there's any such thing.<br>  <br>  However, let me ask you this:  say an atheist (like myself) is a good person all his/her life; helps others, is fair and honest, doesn't lie, cheat, steal, or anything else; is kind, generous, loving, responsible -- a good person by *anybody's* measure (humans or your supposed god's).<br>  Then the atheist dies.<br>  Let's assume for one second (I know, wild speculation, but bear with me) that your christian god does exist -- so this atheist after dying winds up at the "judgement bar" in the afterlife.  God admits that he/she has been a terrific person, was kind to others, and lived a great life.  So god asks, "why didn't you believe in me?"  The atheist truthfully answers, "there was no evidence to show that you existed -- so I used the brain you gave me to arrive at the only possible logical conclusion."  Despite the honesty, a good life, and no harm ever done to anyone...does your god send this person to everlasting hell for all eternity, for being honest?  Is that the kind of "god" you want to worship?<br>  <br>  Most christians I know say their god would indeed send this person to hell, because the atheist didn't accept god and jesus -- even though there's no evidence to show they're real.  That is one of the reasons that, although we can't prove there are no gods of any kind, we find it easy to show that your christian god doesn't exist...any loving, all-knowing "god" wouldn't do something like that, 'cause he'd know there was no evidence for his existence, and he'd have to appreciate the atheist's honesty.  Your god apparently does no such thing.<br>  <br>  Peace.|`|3ba0ab7304ca31210254987d14dbe035aa	No.  A person is only granted entrance to heaven by repentance of their sins and faith in Jesus Christ as their savior.|`|7mhRDbvsaa	yes...cuz heaven is the home for the atheists|`|cIZS6Wr2aa	What does the bible say about that?  It says in order to be given the gift of eternal life or heaven, one must believe not only in God but in His Son Jesus, accept Him into their hearts with repentance as their Lord and Savior.  It says it is a choice everyone must make.  Atheists choose not to make that choice.

Amen.  <br>  <br>  For this reason God gave them over to degrading passions; for their women exchanged the natural function for that which is unnatural *,  <br>  and in the same way also the men abandoned the natural function of the woman and burned in their desire toward one another, men with men committing indecent acts and receiving in their own persons the due penalty of their error.  <br>  <br>  And just as they did not see fit to acknowledge * God any longer, God gave them over to a depraved mind, to do those things which are not proper,  <br>  being filled with all unrighteousness, wickedness, greed, evil; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, malice; they are gossips,  <br>  slanderers, haters of God, insolent, arrogant , boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents,  <br>  without understanding, untrustworthy, unloving, unmerciful ;  <br>  and although they know the ordinance of God, that those who practice such things are worthy of death, they not only do the same, but also give hearty approval to those who practice them.  <br>  <br>  And <br>  <br>  1Co 6:9-10<br>  Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God ? Do not be deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor homosexuals , <br>  nor thieves, nor the covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers, will inherit the kingdom of God. <br>  <br>  and <br>  <br>  Gal 5:19-21<br>  Now the deeds of the flesh are evident, which are: immorality, impurity, sensuality,  <br>  idolatry, sorcery, enmities , strife, jealousy , outbursts of anger, disputes, dissensions, factions,  <br>  envying, drunkenness, carousing, and things like these, of which I forewarn you, just as I have forewarned you, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.  <br>  <br>  And further<br>  <br>  Re 22:15 Outside are the dogs and the sorcerers and the immoral persons and the murderers and the idolaters, and everyone who loves and practices lying. <br>  <br>  And further<br>  <br>  Jer 7:16 "As for you, do not pray for this people , and do not lift up cry or prayer for them, and do not intercede with Me; for I do not hear you. <br>  <br>  Jer 11:14 "Therefore do not pray for this people , nor lift up a cry or prayer for them; for I will not listen when they call to Me because of their disaster . <br>  <br>  Jer 14:11 So the LORD said to me, "Do not pray for the welfare of this people . <br>  <br>  They have chosen their path.|`|bVHnNqzBaa	Many (not all!) people choose Christianity for the reward of salvation or to avoid the punishment of hell. That's known as Pascal's wager. I don't consider these folks Christian or religious at all. To me, a true Christian would accept Christ without regard to salvation, would not crow about being saved, would not condemn others, and would even take that John 3:16 oath of allegiance knowing that g-d might hypothetically punish them.|`|cpOtr6Thaa	This question requires an explanation to be understood correctly.  Before I explain, I do want to clarify that there is no group of people discriminated against. <br>  <br>  Christians believe that when God created the earth it was a paradise, like heaven is expected to be.  The first man and woman were created perfect and God spent one on one time with them daily.  There was a tree of life in the garden that would enable them to live forever as long as they ate from it.  <br>  <br>  They made a choice to trust an enemy of God who tricked them into disobeying the only rule God gave for them and Christians call this "sin".  They suffered what we call a first death.  This can be compared to what happens when a branch is cut off a tree, it dies over a period of time, not immediately.  So they didn't die, but began the process of dying.  This sin-nature was passed on to the rest of humanity as a result. <br>  <br>  Because God is holy and man was now sinful, they couldn't be in the direct presence of God.  The law of sin and death can be compared to the law of gravity.  For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.  So now God, the maker of all the laws had to act as judge.  There is a penalty for sin, just as there is a penalty for being a convicted a killer.  The penalty for sin (choosing other than God) is what we call a second death.  This is an eternal spiritual separation from God after our bodies die.  <br>  <br>  Because God is loving and just in equal measure, He provided a solution.  Because death is the punishment for sin, there had to be a death to pay that debt.  If you're a parent with three children and you were told that one was going to die and two would live and that you had to choose, what would you do?  Well, God, as our "parent" in this situation, chose to sacrifice Himself in place of us.  This is what He did through the death of Jesus.  Jesus was God Himself who came to earth to pay this debt for us.  <br>  <br>  Our problem with sin is justified and the only thing separating humans from life with their creator (on earth and in the afterlife) is just to accept this gift.|`|KAeGrDxxaa	Yes.

YaB5bpv7aa	NEVER  he was clean and pure|`|y1KcxJ7Oaa	Yes.  In High School, Jesus dated Mary Magdalen for awhile, but then she started dating Judas.  Judas and Magdalen got married and had a child named Lazarus.  <br>  <br>  Jesus and Magdalen hooked up again when Jesus was 30, so Judas was going to have Magdalen stoned for committing adultery but Jesus intervened.  Frustrated at being a cuckold, Judas turned Jesus in to be crucified and have Magdalen all to himself.  Unfortunately, Magdalen was bisexual and started a lesbian affair with Martha.  Magdalen fell madly in love with Martha, but Jewish law prohibited gay marriage.<br>  <br>  Jesus was resurrected as prophecied and officially performed the first gay wedding when Martha and Magdalen married each other.  The Pharisees went balistic. The bastard child Lazarus changed his name to Josephus and lived happily ever after with his two lesbian moms, Mommy Magdalen and Mommy Martha.

8oi3gCZoaa	I've been a professional writer for thirty years.<br>  <br>  I have included here only the sections I have changed.<br>  <br>  "I recently learned of.." is fine and it is better than ".. learned about.."<br>  <br>  "I have been offered full undergraduate and postgraduate tuition for the University of Jordan by The Ministry of Higher Education and the Dean of Foreign Languages, University of Jordan, respectively.  However, I believe that studying in the United Kingdom at Lancaster University would enable me to gain additional life skills and to develop my long-term potential, both academically and professionally. Traveling, meeting people, and exposure to other cultures would surely enhance my education and further enable me to build a productive career in my homeland."  <br>  <br>  "and the unemployment rates have increased dramatically."<br>  <br>  "Please send me an application and financial assistance information for the Geoffery Leech Scholarships. Thank you for your assistance."  That's the whole paragraph.  Of course you're looking forward to getting it, you don't have to say so.<br>  <br>  Is it "Geoffrey" or "Geoffery"?  You have it spelled both ways.  Be sure the spelling is correct every time you mention it.<br>  <br>  Are you sure that this is the kind of letter you need to send just to ask for an application etc?  Seems to me that this is the kind of information you would put on the application but you can always repeat it there if appropriate.<br>  <br>  Okay, the rest of what you wrote is good.

The good thing about homeschool is that you move at your own pace and have the comfort of home while doing school and have a lot less stress than if you go to public school. The bad thing is you have less time with your friends. It may seem like a very minor problem, but believe me, it is one of the most worst-case senerio's you can have when being homeschooled.<br>    Now for public schools. The good things are that you have LOTS of time with your friends, not to mention new friends, and you make WAY more memories. Basically, public schools make your life way more interesting than if you would be homeschooled. But, there are many downsides as well. Such as much stress, mean teachers, bullies, snobs, and pressure. Lots of pressure. <br>  <br>  I'm sorry, but I'm just not sure else how to help you! It all depends on what personality you have. But I think my reasons will help you a little, I hope.
gqhoCu3faa	For The most important facts of your question, please visit the web side http://www.mormon.org   &  THE GOOD SECRET EVIDENCE  There have to be a purpose for life otherwise we will miss the peaceful path of happiness to choose truly what is right & wrong. In fact right love does not need anything but only feelings of right. Where love is high, there selfishness is Low. Just only faith is not enough to be right. We need real Evidence. Right..?  So,   Spiritually,   What is God?  Whats makes God as god?    Well, just try to know, whats makes God as god, the Power, isnt it? So what the power can do? Ah? Well, it can give the ability to organise all things & it can give the ability to separate everything & most importantly, the Ability to control everything, isnt it? Isnt it good? Ah? So, from our hard study & research effort with the help from god, we realized that the ability to control everything, the Power of God is gradually increased in the full amount to use so; The Power of God is always the omnipotent & existed among everything. & The God now is always the same omnipotent for us, who is organised us & we are growing towards perfection. The perfection is the final stage, not the end. & The Power of God, the Ability is the reward for us to control everything in a proper manner, like the true God of goodness. & Everlasting Happiness is the final stage. & it cannot come alone without the final stage perfection of God. & if god always perfect in perfection then there have to be beginning with God for the organizing progress of all things. So, there is No end & also No beginning for all things, including this on going organizing progress. So, we cannot get anything from nothing. All are energy. E=MC2     If you dont still agree,   Note  this:  you can use any thing for Good or Bad so, whenever possible If you ask the god for the good reason to give you the ability perfection, because of your obedience, then the God will give you, if the god is Almighty.       If you are humble, Please, Pray to know the truth from true God by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit with great faith. Good or bad, Good with bad. God gave us the rights to do what is right for you & sometimes, things can be right in your point of view but wrong in Public point of view so Basically, we & god can do anything for right reason but just pray about it for the Good Answer and try to do the God's will first always.    Just think, why so much trouble & pain in this world? Then there is only one reason, without pain, no pleasure, without them, we cannot enjoy this life so always we need them. You use pain & pleasure instead of, they use you. You have to be certain to win in order to succeed in your Best job. If possible, keep the photo of your vision. The vision of your future should be clear & feel it strong enough in your visualizing mind & your desire for success should be greater than your fear of failure. & Love is the Ability. When we do repetitive actions somehow our State of mind has to be new as we did the first action. & we all make mistakes so it is hard to look for star in daylight. So just in faith, it is possible. Like that the faith in true God. Because of Lack of faith in true God, we do not have the great gift of understanding of things. All things are spiritually first, to govern by God with glory. Have a look at this world of wonders of yours & then you know the truth, when you listen to your real voice. & having a strong desire to do the best every day then stick with the best to do your best & most importantly, try to be grateful for what you have now to get out of fear & doing your best & making good people as a powerful influential person / leader, this is going to make your life winning.    The Law of mercy cannot rob the Law of justice so Justice demands the punishment of our sin but The Law of mercy requires the forgiveness to give to us & God is perfect in perfection so cannot violate his laws so The God provided the way to our salvation to overcome our sin so Jesus Christ sacrifice is much needed to return to live with God, so Jesus Christ is our savior.    Did you make the commitment to find joy in every moment by using your empowering meanings & conscious focus for the needs of your five senses?  Did you make this promise; I will never going to settle less than I can be?  Do you have the must realistic measurable rules, goals & best clear image of what you really want in all aspects of your life?  Do you live your life as a mission for your vision purpose?  Breaking down your vision into mini-goals & give must time for them regularly  Write it down the answers to be more real  Try to know all the basics to manage your life & Ask: Is it enjoyable? Rather than believing the progress is hard  Be aware of your believe which is holding you back to take actions   The Power is focus; choose wisely  http://in.youtube.com/watch?v=O061waey5g...

XiCGpIx3aa	I would ask him had he ever gone or visited.  He would most likely say no.  Then ask him, "how do you know what it would be like?"  Then encourage, or better yet, challenge him to come and experience it for himself.  Maybe for example, "Look you can criticize something you know nothing about or you can come visit and really see for yourself, if you are not scared of finding the truth."    Another way is to tell him, "I am going because it is something very important to me."  If he is your friend then he should respect that (he should have anyway) and maybe even been interested in finding out more from you.    But really, don't feel bad about negative about what you said or did.  In this day and time it is hard for Christians to always have a snappy comeback for every attack.  There are so many we endure everyday after all.  Take time to pray and ask God to give you some wisdom on how to talk to your friend.|`|IqqaA2wIaa	just ignore rude people...it has nothing to do with beliefs.....make your own decisions....do your own work....|`|ef4edd8f1c0d16fab298d474bf08b339aa	I would try to remember what my job is.

rMDHNPnEaa	It would be too confusing. Besides, how would one begin to measure fussy? or amazing?    What ever I find to be amazing might be boring to someone else. If I saw a child crying I might think he was fussy but someone else might say he was sweet but just tired.    All those words are adjitive and are subjective meaning they have different meanings to the person who experiences them. I can say the box is big. Big doesn't mean anything.    Objective is actually measuring the box. If it is 8 in X 10 in it might be big, but someone else who was expecting a box that was 16 in X 20 in  would say it was small.     You can't define an opinion or a feeling. It will depend on the person making the statement and how he or she feels about it.
AA11047076	There are quite a few- but generally it is in the details that only those who know the difference would notice:    The prayer books differ slightly- phraseology differs in a few places though they are 95% the same  Ashkenazi men wear tzitzit the whole day, many Sephradim don't  Ashkenazi will generally follow the rulings of the Rema in the Shulkhan Aruch, Sephardi the Mechaber (Rav Yosef Karo)- this results in both leniencies and stringencies as the Rema varies from the opinions of the Mechaber.  Sephardi food is better! (at elast in my opinion LOL)  On Pesach Sephardim eat rice and legumes (kitniot) Ashkenazi do not  Sephardi and Ashkanzi traditions in regards to reading the Haftorah vary and they are not always the same sections read    The majority of differences are cultural and customs rather than halachic though.  So a Sephardi wedding is likely to have different customs, dances etc than an Ashkenazi wedding.    Over all, the two are VERY similar, the differences slight in comparison to the number of things that do not change|`|XQhrHiUcaa	In addition to Allonyoa's    Sephardim are more strict about kosher meat  Sephardim are more strict about food cooked by non-Jews  Sephardim will light only one chanukiyah per house, Ashkenazim will light one per person  Sephardim will repeat an entire Torah portion when they want to add on the number of men called to read.  Ashkenazim will break te portion into multiple portions but not repeat the same reading  Many Sephardim have their Torah scrolls encased in wood  The Sephardim raise and show the Torah before its reading, Ashkenazim after he reading  Sephardim will recite Selichoth for a full month before Rosh Hashanah, Ashkenazim for only one week  Sephardim are more likely to wear Teflin at Minchah  Sephardim recite the priestly blessings at each morning servicce  The Chazan in Sephardic synagogues usually reads each word of the service out loud

Women love guy that are financially independent and that are confident. You just need to work on those two things. If an ugly rapper can get chicks what does that tell you money. Quoting Oprah "money make anything looks good." Go to college , you will find somebody. You are only 19 are you kidding me? Have you seeing COOLIO?      ss|`|2dfdfcdb4d65c895a40f81c0cb21ef17aa	I don't think anyone is "meant" be alone. I think people choose to be alone.    At any rate have you considered the possibility that maybe  you're just a late bloomer?  A lot of people don't find the right person until they're in their 30s, 40s or even their 50s. You're only 19...so you've got plenty of time on your side.    At any rate, there are plenty of men that are short and who aren't considered universally attractive (ok, ugly) but yet they still have incredibly good luck with women.     Here's a few famous examples....    The French philosopher Jean Paul Sartre was short and by all acounts ugly....yet he was a famous womanizer!  So was the emporor Napoleon. So was Albert Einstein...but yet he still had his share of 'groupies' on both sides of the Atlantic.  Dr. Steven Hawking is definitely not what any woman's dream man would look like, and you'd think with the kind of profound disabilities he had he'd definitely be undesirable as a lover or a husband ...but yet he's got women chasing him big time, too!      Woody Allen has had no problem getting women, neither has Danny DeVito, Jason Alexander or John Lovitz...and none of those men can even be remotely considered hunks!  Look at Donald Trump and Bill Gates. The former has been in a good long-term marriage, the latter has had more than his share of trophy wives and girlfriends. Neither of those two men have looks to write home about.    The current President of France, Nicholas Sarkozy, is short and definitely not attractive...but he still managed to snag himself a supermodel, Carla Bruni.    How did those men (and other ordinary everyday men)  manage to become so successful on several levels, despite their admitted lack of good looks and lack of height?  Well, despite having one or both shortcoming, they still got out there, worked hard and made something of themselves...and they developed their personalities and characters...and by doing that, they gained the self-confidence needed  to attract and keep a woman.    So there's your answer:  get out there and find out what it is you are good at. Succeed...and I guarantee you'll have to turn women away!      Good luck :)    p.s. there are three places where shorter men seem to have an advantage where women are concerned...the military, the church and the music business. I've known a number of guys who either enlisted, got into the ministry or they joined a band, became rap artists or even slam poets.... and usually with a year or two, they had girlfriends or even wives.  Just a thought.|`|W0qNkROpaa	No, I don't think anyone is "meant to be" anything.  It's not about looks, I know plenty of ugly people who are in relationships.  Showing your personality is the important thing, and to do that you have to work on your social skills.  It's very hard, obviously, but nobody will ever know what you're like on the inside if you don't show them.  The most important thing is to be happy with yourself.|`|I9LTTno2aa	yes I do|`|TxvWkK1Zaa	I don't believe that some people are meant to be alone. I think it's those girls that are missing out, not you. You just put yourself down too much, I thiink it's a confidence issue. You should take some acting classes, even if you're not into acting, so you can boost your confidence. Confidence is sexy and you'll improve your social skills along the way. Don't give up just yet, you're too young, and you've, like me, got the rest of your life ahead of you.    If it's any consolation, I'm short as well and I'd get to know you if you lived round my area.|`|zjXLbGnJaa	I decided not to answer your questions anymore since you deleted one where I wrote you a long long answer... But since you said something about God making some people beautiful and some ugly... You know its not His fault, you should thank Him for the mere fact of letting you breathe the fresh air surrounding us, let you enjoy a simple glass of water, the view of the world among lots of other things that are beautiful in life. You know why he made ugliness, starvation, sorrow etc.. So that we can appreciate the good things in life, imagine if everybody was perfect... then really there wouldn't be no point in life, no need to progress, it would be plain boring... You need to stop whining about everything and man up, so what if you are short? its not worse than a midget, or a guy without legs, imagine having no legs man... Now there I can't complain about that person whining, but somebody that is healthy, has all opportunities in life and is young... c'mon man you are smarter than that... And if you are so desperate to have a girl or a relationship why don't you try doing something else? Get a nice paying job, if you dont have social skills then let the money do the talking! There are girls out there that love money! I know that this isnt love but cmon man, its better than being lonely and heck who knows she might fall in love with you as time passes by.... and also about your attitude... with that attitude you are not gonna get anywhere, you have to be confident of yourself in order to be successful. Please in the meantime, don't blame God for things that have happened in your life or anything else, he gave us free will to do as we please and this beautiful earth to live on... Please think about your life, and don't highlight the bad things, highlight the good things, that is what i have noticed about you, that you are always whining and crying! stop it with that, life is not fair sometimes FOR EVERYBODY, not just you, we all have problems, people in another country are worrying about protecting their families, or even themselves, experiencing the terror of war, worrying about bigger things and you are here worrying about not hugging a girl? cmon man! Be happy, you deserve it. And please... don't delete this question or I will delete you from my contacts list for good.. I always help you out.|`|ENl3pqnGaa	you can't give up entirely. no on is meant to be alone and your giving up just means that you're denying the girl you're meant to be with from true happiness as well :(|`|qLaw1VELaa	know what u need 2 do u need to get extremely drunk then go to a club and try and pull girls ( judging by ur level of confidence u should try to pick the 1s that cant move or breath) alcohol= more confidence|`|dbCkTKDxaa	don't give up there is someone out there for evryone. think of a colse friend or someone you grown up with maybe there the one and you don"t know it and i do not mean a sister a mean a friend|`|1968df56bb4d12221cfe3e719b7c1488aa	Wow dude, you need to change your perception!!

But then, in my culture, it is simply unnatural for a woman to be alone, hence I got married. Now, while I do have a wonderful career, I cannot pursue my love of travelling anymore because of my family. If I could turn back time, I would have preferred to be alone till 60, or just have a partner in life, not  necessarily a husband. some people are simply happiest when they are alone at the end of the day, I think I'd love to have a family to love during the day but I'd rather be alone at the end of the day. "Me" moment....|`|4Td1aRWSaa	You have a low self-confidence because of your lack of experience and a lack of experience because of your low self-confidence. Your loneliness may have been painful at first, but you got used to it because people are very good at numbing themselves to whatever pains they're in. Realize that social skills are something you can train and get better at. If you feel you're at the bottom of society, all the more reason to start leveling up your skills.  Blaming your loneliness on an unfair world and your percieved ugliness, which I'm sure isn't as bad as you think it is, is just a way of rationalizing your situation to yourself, so as to allow you not to feel responsible for a poor life-situation. It's the human reflex, to shift the blame on others. Plenty of "ugly" people have good social skills and plenty of "beautiful" people have bad skills. Just do the best with what you've got!  It will be a hard and painful path, going from total wreck to a normal working social life, but it IS possible and no person is MEANT to be alone. You shouldn't accept the situation you're in if it isn't doing you any good.|`|0gqhRPdFaa	I feel for you, I really do, I'm 19, 20 in april, with rubbish social skills just like you, I had ADHD all through school so I struggled to even make friends, let alone get a partner.    In the past few months it picked up, cos I stopped trying to be something I'm not. I've never been good with girls in person, always been rubbish at starting conversation and when asked questions, i always gave one word answers and that's it. So i wasn't really one who can talk to people about p[roblems and the like.    My advice, stop trying to be somebody you're not. These 'negatives' you talk about aren't negatives, they're only negative because you call them so! They're what make you! that isn't a bad thing at all. I'm quiet, and geeky, all I know is computers and the like, I don't really know anything else, and I'm not good at anything else. My girlfriend appriciates that and actually likes me for it, What i saw as a negative in myself is something she likes me for.    Also, When I first kissed a girl those few months ago, I didn't like it, I'm not sure why I kissed her, it just happenned, and I regretted it, but forgot about it, I have a girlfriend now and she's really amazing. I question to myself why she likes me but to be honest, it doesn't matter, the fact is she does and that's that.    In answer to your question, do I think some people are meant to be alone, no I don't, you're not MEANT to be anything. Try not to think about it or when the time does come that you find somebody who's right for you you'll end up getting obsessive over them and spoil it which is NOT good. So yeah, just be you and try not to think about what others think so much.    Don't start accepting you're going to be alone, cos it may well not be true, just accept that right this second isn't your time, that doesn't mean it won't come ever.

So,  before getting ready for work this morning, I surprised him with a chocolate cake that had some red frosting roses on the top and two candles - one that was a 7 and one that was a 5.  I also gave him a couple of presents and a couple of funny cards - one from me and one from the cat!  And, I sent his picture to the TV news station we always watch (They show pictures and announce birthdays during the morning news every day.)  He was just thrilled!  He came from a large family, and has been married 5 times, but he says I am the only person in his life that ever even paid any attention to his birthdays!;    When someone has lived as long as he has, done as many things, been as many places, had as many adventures, etc, it really makes me feel wonderful to know I can give him something no one else ever has    In the hustle and bustle of everyday life, it is easy to forget that something as simple as a little birthday celebration can mean the world to someone!    Then, when I got to work, finished my morning reports, and glanced out the window, there was the most BEAUTIFUL sunrise I have seen in a long time!  It is about 2:00pm here now, and it is STILL a gorgeous day!  Sunshine, blue sky and reasonably wam temperature for this time of year in the Pacific Northwest!    My boyfriend called me at lunchtime - as he does every day - and thanked me again for the birthday cake, cards, and all - and he said he was cooking us a pork-roast for dinner in the rotisserie oven I had gotten him for Christmas.    The radio station I listen to at work has been playing exceptionally pretty music all day and I have been really enjoying it!

emAadm8haa	I'm going call you Rachel, you can go to the bathroom and sprinkle some water on yourself now.|`|QMbaeva9aa	If it really bothers you, go get yourself baptized. Also, your name has no bearing on whether you get into heaven or not.    I suggest having a nice, long talk with your parents. It could be that you're the youngest and they decided not to bother?|`|0yTM98Odaa	You're like me.  Pretty much all my family are Catholic and were baptized as babies.  I think only me and one of my cousins weren't!  My brother and sister were baptized when they were babies but my parents didn't bother to get me baptized.  I don't see why they didn't since most Catholics believe unbaptized babies can't go to Heaven.  I also don't have a Christian first name.    Anyway it's OK because if you want to get baptized you can at any age.  I believe water baptism is supposed to come after being born again anyway and don't believe babies need to be baptized at all.      I go to a protestant church atm and will most likely get baptized there during this year.  All you have to do at that church is ask and they arrange it for you.      If you believe in Jesus Christ and want to get water baptized just start attending a church and then when you feel comfortable with asking them about being baptized, ask them and they will arrange it.    It's not nice though knowing a lot of your family believe if you died tomorrow you wouldn't go to heaven just because you hadn't been baptized with water yet and also being the only one whenever we went to Catholic church not being allowed Holy Communion.|`|Gsd4VD13aa	Why do you need to be baptized? It doesn't mean anything anyway. And frankly, if you want to be then go talk to your religious leader. Take an initiative to control your OWN life. Its part of growing up.|`|9mLjDa5kaa	Water baptism can't prevent you from being sent to hell anyway.  Neither can your name.  Water baptism cannot be added to Jesus's perfect salvation.  Water baptism is simply a celebration that a person is ALREADY saved by Jesus, and if a saved believer never gets water baptised, that is okay.     Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation.     The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross and rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what!     Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)|`|mfSp38yzaa	Go get Baptized then. And you don't have to have a "Christian name" to get into Heaven. I'm sure your parents never looked at it that way, and if they had known that Baptism was important to you, would have made an effort to arrange it. Either way though, sounds like you're old enough now to take care of it yourself.

Looking at previous answers - Quorn does not guarantee that their product is gluten free (I've been in touch with them before about this).    Rice noodles bear no similarity to wheat based ones other than shape. They are transparent and pretty slimey, though fine in with other things. The very fine ones used in Singapore rice noodles are nicest, imho. Many gluten free pastas are gaaargh - awful. However, there are excellent gluten free pastas in amongst the dross.

But, the beliefs that these models are built on are not. The problem is that most scientists do not realize that it is the belief (religion) of evolution that is the basis for scientific models (the interpretations, or stories) used to attempt an explanation of the present. Evolutionists are not prepared to change their actual belief that all life can be explained by natural processes and that no God is involved (or even needed).

The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6.

Surely irrespective of whether dinosaurs are or are not mentioned in the bible, the timescale required rather rules out the recent creation idea?    BTW -  Why does the Apostle chap keep mentioning Carbon dating? It's not applied for anything other than organic remains, which something from 65 million years is definitely not. Instead, the dating is based on uranium half lives. At least if you're going to tilt and windmills, tilt at the right ones, eh!?|`|QMbaeva9aa	Who knows.

Palaeontology by James Scott states:"Even the earliest homo-sapiens lived after the disappearence of the dinosaurs.  The book A Vanished World says:"All 11 major kinds of dinosaurs ceased to exist at the same time.  The Bible does not provide specific answers when they were created,but it does say that the animal life was created around the fifth or sixth days or periods of time.    Geneses 1:21 says :"That God proceeded to create the great sea monsters.  We know that the dinosaurs inhabited swamps and marshy bogs. It seems likely they must have disappeared at the time of the flood.    Even so we see today see evidence of animals (example ) giant lizards and monitors.  It would have been possible for Noah to take such ones on the ark,because of their size.|`|QC94lBXOaa	Dinosaur fossils were placed on earth by the debull to try and trick xians into becoming atheists...oops! sorry...I meant:  Athiests.|`|WQvqLnnhaa	How old do you think the dinosaurs are?

It is man that has a short history [ 6-8,000 years] on the earth...since Adam and Eve were created.    This is deduced from the life spans of the Patriarchs of Genesis chapter ten. Then the geneology of Jesus in Matthew chapter one and Luke chapter three.|`|mxe86blRaa	The topic of dinosaurs in the Bible is part of a larger ongoing debate within the Christian community over the age of the earth, the proper interpretation of Genesis, and how to interpret the physical evidences we find all around us. Those who believe in an older age for the earth tend to agree that the Bible does not mention dinosaurs, because according to their paradigm, dinosaurs died out millions of years before the first man ever walked the earth. The men who wrote the Bible down couldnt have seen dinosaurs alive.    Those who believe in a younger age for the earth tend to agree that the Bible does mention dinosaurs though it never actually uses the word dinosaur. Instead, it uses the Hebrew word tanniyn (pronounced tan-neen; Strongs  08577). Tanniyn is translated a few different ways in our English Bibles; sometimes its sea monster, sometimes its serpent. It is most commonly translated dragon. The tanniyn appear to have been some sort of giant reptile. These creatures are mentioned nearly thirty times in the Old Testament and are found both on land and in the water.    In addition to mentioning these giant reptiles in general nearly thirty times throughout the Old Testament, the Bible describes a couple of creatures in such a way that some scholars believe the writers may have been describing dinosaurs. Behemoth is said to be the mightiest of all Gods creatures, a giant whose tail is likened to a cedar tree (Job 40:15ff). Some scholars have tried to identify Behemoth as either an elephant or a hippopotamus. Others point out that elephants and hippopotamuses have very thin tails, nothing comparable to a cedar tree. Dinosaurs like the Brachiosaurus and the Diplodocus on the hand other had huge tails which one could easily compare to a cedar tree.    Nearly every ancient civilization has some sort of art depicting giant reptilian creatures. Petroglyphs, artifacts and even little clay figurines found in North America resemble modern depictions of dinosaurs. Rock carvings in South America depict men riding Diplodocus-like creatures and, amazingly, bear the familiar images of Triceratops-, Pterodactyl- and Tyrannosaurus Rex-like creatures. Roman mosaics, Mayan pottery and Babylonian city walls all testify to mans trans-cultural, geographically-unbounded fascination with these creatures. Sober accounts like those of Marco Polos Il Milione mingle with fantastic tales of treasure-hoarding beasts. Modern day reports of sightings persist though they are usually treated with overwhelming skepticism.    In addition to the substantial amount of anthropic and historical evidences for the coexistence of dinosaur and man, there are other physical evidences, like the fossilized footprints of humans and dinosaurs found together at places in North America and West-Central Asia.    So, are there dinosaurs in the Bible? The matter is far from settled. It depends on how you interpret the available evidences and how you view the world around you. Here at GotQuestions.org we believe in a young earth interpretation and accept that dinosaurs and man coexisted. We believe that dinosaurs died out sometime after the Flood due to a combination of dramatic environmental shifts and the fact that they were relentlessly hunted to extinction by man.|`|09aab7aa566e0f4e2eeaf24a95d24132aa	It doesn't matter to me how old the earth is I believe by faith period.

FhXzlnDOaa	Yes.  Muhammad said in hadith that there were 3 acceptable reasons to kill a Muslim and one of those reasons was for apostasy.    Sahih Bukhari  Volume 9, Book 83, Number 17:   Narrated 'Abdullah:     Allah's Apostle said, "The blood of a Muslim who confesses that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and that I am His Apostle, cannot be shed except in three cases: In Qisas for murder, a married person who commits illegal sexual intercourse and the one who reverts from Islam (apostate) and leaves the Muslims."     This just happened last month:      http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/783362...    "Sheikh Hassan Yakub - the spokesman for Kismayo's Islamist administration - told the BBC's Somali Service that Mr Ahmed had admitted during his interrogation that he worked with those backed by Ethiopia.

There's more just google honor killings|`|UmdKqP5kaa	NOT AT ALL, THE QURAN TELLS THAT THERE IS NO COMPULSION OR FORCE IN RELIGION, THE RIGHT PATH IS NOW WELL DISTINGUISHED FROM THE WRONG, WHOEVER FOLLOWS THE RIGHT PATH IS THE WINNER, AND WHOEVER DOESN'T IS FREE, WE'RE ALL GOING TO RETURN TO GOD WHO'LL THEN JUDGE AMONG OUR BELIEFS ON THE DAY OF RESURRECTION.  Ok, we know we don't create each other and we don't come to this world from nowhere because when we die we must be going somewhere as well, hence there must be God, if there were many Gods, they would have fought over what to be created and what not to be, probably over who to die and who to live at the same time... so it's gotta be one God... if that God created us then there must be a reason... could we figure it out on our own? God made it easy and sent us messengers and prophets to show us the way and tell us why... so all the messengers and all the religions are from the same only God, so they've got to be complementary to each other, not opposing each other!!! then God must have said His final words in the last message, what is the last message? and how do we know it's the last one? I guess that would be the religion that believes in all messengers and all books equally... is there such religion? actually yes, Islam does :)  A True Muslim (man or woman) gets his reward for obeying Allah's orders (Allah means The God in Arabic) by going to heaven, where he/she are indulged forever in all the good things that were on earth and more, things no one ever dreamt of or heard about. The Holy Quran tells Muslims (men and women) there will be good food, good wine and sex in heaven for all, but not in the bestial way you may think of, but rather in a way that is satisfactory for everyone and better than what was on earth. Heaven is no heartbreak or injustice land.  True Muslims are no terrorists, and Islam never calls for that, Islam means peace, it bans violence unless you were fought so you fight back, it only doesn't require Muslims to be cowards, and true Muslims understand this very well and never attack civilians.   Islam is the only religion that accepts freedom of religion and asks men to treat women gently like queens.   It's all in the Holy Quran and the right teachings of prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).  If some people behave otherwise, then it's because people behaviour doesn't necessarily reflect the rulings of their religion always, for example, we can't (and don't) judge Christianity by Hitler or Madonna.  And that is another reason why there is heaven and hell after we die, heaven for the obedient and hell for the disobedient and/or oppressor, it's all going to be decided on the day of resurrection and judgement.  To be a Muslim, you must believe God is only one with no spouses or offspring, believe in his angels (servants not males or females), believe in all his religions, messangers and books equally, the day of judgement, heaven and hell and that everything is in God's hands and because of his will (good or bad).  Muslims believe God is the only divine who never dies, the creator who deserves to be worshiped, all prophets who came to earth are human messangers sent by him.  Muslims don't deny christianity, judaism, Jesus or Moses. They believe in them as the noble prophets and messangers of God, love and respect them so much.  We believe the birth of Jesus (messanger of God) was a miracle from God to us, being born by a mother only and with no father. God is the creator, he can do anything.  We believe Jesus (peace be upon him) is NOT dead till today; he wasnt even murdered or crucified as most people think. God (most glorified) made the man who betrayed Jesus be killed instead by switching their looks for a moment. Jesus was left up to live in heaven until the end of days when he will come back to earth again, with no new teachings or messages but just to make justice prevail instead of oppression, fight the imposter who will claim to be God and (most important) to perform his last prayer with the Muslims announcing he's too a follower of the last prophet (Muhammad) as all people should... then he really dies like other Prophets and be buried (peace be upon them all). So we're waiting for you Jesus, Messenger of God, to bring the world peace and pray with us. Thats what prophet Muhammad told us and this is what I believe in, Im a Muslim  so how do we know it's true? what is said in the last message and what should we do? read the following, and you'll figure out for yourself:|`|KT7cllsLaa	In theocracies  and in countries governments ran by muslims|`|vHcaWpV5aa	From my understanding yes! It's punishable by death to leave the faith!|`|36f0220780852a90c0df00d6599663deaa	Those who believe, then disbelieve, then again believe, then disbelieve and then increase in disbelief, Allah will never forgive them nor will He guide them to the right way. (4:138)   This verse proclaims that persons who renounce Islam have the opportunity to re-enter Islam if they so choose. This verse disproves the assertion that according to the Holy Quran an apostate should be put to death. Were death the automatic punishment for an apostate then there arises no question of having the opportunity to join Islam again. This verse mentions apostates who again accept Islam.   There is no mention in the Holy Quran or anywhere else of any punishment for an apostate which may be meted out to him by any other person. The consequences of his apostasy in this world and in the next life lie solely in the hands of God. Man is free to accept or reject whatever beliefs he chooses. God says in the Holy Quran:     There is no compulsion in religion. (2:257)   It is the truth from your Lord; wherefore let him who will believe and let him who will disbelieve. (18:30)   Islam recognizes the right of freedom of conscience and freedom of belief and that as far as one's religious belief is concerned one is answerable to God alone. No man has the right to punish another for his choice of belief. There is absolutely no compulsion whatsoever in Islam and no punishment of any kind permitted in the Holy Quran for apostasy.   Human rights are laid own in the Holy Quran which guarantee man the right of perfect freedom of faith and conscience. In such matters God is the Judge - not man. Our constant prayer is Guide us on the Right Path. (1:6) - Amen.|`|MarJXGpgaa	theres no actual law, but it is listed in the Koran that Islam is the right religion, so islam is actually preffered|`|18f23c8e100103ef2ddb3c61fe1e09e3aa	Maybe the Koran does not order the death of someone falling away from the faith.  I say ... MAYBE.  But no one can deny that for many Islamic governments and zealots, death is the answer to anyone who wants to leave the religion or to refuse to come to it.    IN FACT, I believe there is other "scripture" in the Koran that its readers use to justify murdering Christians as infidels.  So, I'm not sure about that passage quoted above.  Maybe they torture them for awhile to see if they will come back around.  If they cannot withstand the torture and re-commit to the faith then all is well.  Otherwise, well, you know.

tTUT6uxbaa	GOD knows what is in your heart, so he knows who truly believes and who truly worships, an who pays lip service.    We go through tests according to our faith you wont be given anything to deal with you cant handle. He isn't doing this for himself to find out anything, He already knows. Its for you to discover what faith in GOD can bring you.     It's like weight lifting. If we're alone we'll either lift the same weight forever and not get anywhere, or we'll try to lift to much, get hurt and discouraged then quit. Get yourself a good trainer though who sets out a course of progressively harder and more challenging test designed to build you and strengthen you, and you'll make progress.    Its like that with GOD.what you go through now may seem like a lot, and it is at the time make no mistake, but look back at what victories you have attained and you'll see what had appeared so large back then, is now something you could face, and maybe do face, easily now.    As for people who just seem to never have issues or "whisk through life better then me", they may have been tested in ways you don't know of, or they may just not be tested because GOD knows that at this time, they aren't ready.    Have confidence that GOD is training you for his plans, and you will be able to stand tall after the trials you face.    As for depression, GOD gave us doctors for a reason, so I'm glad you doing the right thing.You do know that recognizing the issue with that and having the courage to get treatment was a HUGE test don't you?

I often see how we blame God for our troubles, but we have to remember the "troublemaker" is not God. The "trouble maker" is Satan, and his plan is to destroy us. God's plan is to give us life and give it to us more abundantly.    "For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the LORD, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end" (KJV).  Joseph did not have this verse of Scripture to hold on to when he went through many severe testings of his faith.   Joseph knew his place, and he knew God's place. It was not his place to bring retribution upon his brothers. He released all judgment of them to God. He forgave them, and he even encouraged them and promised to nourish and take care of them the rest of their lives. Joseph understood the sovereignty of God. He knew as long as he was faithful to God and loved God with all of his heart, God would ultimately work everything for good in his life. Joseph knew this in his spirit, but we have an advantage overJoseph. This revelation that God works everything for the good for those who love Him and are called according to His purpose is clearly written by Paul to us in Romans 8:28. If we love God with all of our hearts and know we are walking in the calling of God, we can have the deep assurance that whatever trial we face in this life, God's ultimate plan is to work it for good in our lives.|`|RKQTD9Dhaa	I would probably try a different world view on for size.

You and your cousins have the same type of highs and lows in life, but they are able to address them more directly because they don't have all the religious baggage to deal with also.

Have faith even though it is hard, remember, Not everything is God's fault as the devil works through people also.|`|09aab7aa566e0f4e2eeaf24a95d24132aa	Read the story of Job and you will find that it was Satan who did the things to Job and not God.  He allowed those things because he knew Job was faithful.   Tell me about people having it easier than you believe me I know all about it.  We are choose according to His purposes and He who has begun a good work in us will bring it to completion.  Remember the children in the fiery furnace, baby you are going to come through this and not even have the smell of smoke on you.   Consider it a blessing and joy when we face adversity.|`|sUVpbKDDaa	It's a good question. I've thought about that, too.    I really do not have the "ultimate" answer, but speaking from my experience (spanning a number of years), I've stepped back a little to take a break. Things were damn too hard when I tried to stay on the track "as requested" by God, but as soon as I took a break (stopped praying, etc.), I felt better. Not a bit better, BUT A LOT BETTER.    That was not supposed to happened, but it happened. I would say, "Ah, that's the works by the Devil. He's been trying to push me off the track and would try to make me feel better when I got off so to lead me to believe that it was not worth praying to God".    But I want to say one thing, we are mortal. God is immortal, so He shouldn't be surprised to see if we "fall".    I have so much to say here, but I'm compelled, frankly, to discover the truth about the OTHER side of religion.

Their insecurities make them think that a guy will only like them for their bodies and being "girl on girl" is looked at by men as attractive. I know many girls who have said they are Bisexual and never have done anything with people. These people are lokking for attention, pity, etc. How do you figure out if your Bisexual? You experiment with both sexes. I know I am Bisexual because I feel the same when Im intimatly with a guy and a girl, I get butterflies with both, am able to love both and most importantly can see myself with both in the future.|`|uky2nsh8aa	i think it's just stupid.....|`|yzgS5KiQaa	It's disrespect.

CBKjEvp5aa	Well people hate people in their own family all the time, but I digress. To the question, I don't know about decreasing racism vastly, but someone who is of two or more different races is less likely to be racist against the race they are made up of. But in the same retrospect, someone who is Black and White can still be racist towards Indians, so it's a tricky question. I think acceptance, intelligence, and tolerance are the three things that can truly decrease racism.|`|hqvPk8WIaa	It doesn't reduce racism one bit. Look at Brazil for a good example. People have been mixing for so many generations, and there are many racially-ambiguous looking people there. But to this day, the Brazilians who look to have the most African ancestry live in the favelas and are discriminated against in jobs and housing. Black Brazilian boys are routinely shot in the streets by police and nothing happens. White Brazilians control their government and refuse to work toward removing deeply-entrenched institutional racism there. The have many labels for groups of people, depending on their racial make-up and the degree to which they are mixed-- they still categorize people rigidly and treat them accordingly. Mixed peoples are allowed exposure in the media and some social mobility, but the dark blacks are not.|`|66tTuuIFaa	Racial mixing simply is what it is. I don't think it hurts but I don't think it necessarily helps either. <br>  As a woman with biracial children, young biracial children I might add, people are still racist towards them. Some sneer at them, some call them mutts, others call them genetic abnormalities and tell me I should have aborted. Some white people have voiced their distaste in the idea that my children might date black people, some black people have voiced their distaste in the idea that my children might date white people. Others still have voiced their distaste that my children might even decide to date someone other than white or black people.<br>  People within my family and my husbands family, albeit very few people, have voiced their distaste in our mixture and although they grudgingly love our children they do not love the fact that they are mixed for they see it as a mockery to our individual races. They fill our children would be better off as either black children or white children. They believe are children will self-loathe and try to solely indentify with one race or another (as they supposedly should) because of that self-loathing. Their belief is it's impossible to be of multiple races and love each of those races.<br>  <br>  The point is, people will always find something to discriminate against. We could be a world full of racially mixed people and still some would say "Well my 1/4 Cherokee blood trumps your 1/16 Cherokee blood."|`|pfke6Jieaa	i doubt it trust me. there are a lot of ppl mixing in this society and racism didnt end right? if we as individuals dont take a step and start acting more mature and become more open minded then racism will never end. and i dont think racial mixing should be a solution to end racism because it will cause some ppl to forget who they are.<br>  <br>  there are many ppl who marry out for the wrong reasons also so dont forget about that bro. for those ppl who do that they should be ashamed of them selves. its worse to be racist against ur own ppl than it is against everyone who is different from u. but it doesnt make any of those two any better than the other.|`|fjsczTsMaa	Well, maybe it would prevent racism against the race/s of the people involved in the relationship, but that still wouldn't prevent them from being racist against other races.<br>  <br>  E.g. My fiance is Indian, I am white and he hates the Chinese. Most Indians do, from my experience.|`|30b80549ef581ba10302258d8ca2bfbaaa	hell no. <br>  <br>  i think thats a pathetic claim that i keep hearing from people. we as humans will always find something to hate about one another. who would hate someone in their family? have you not heard of people disowning family members/ just not talking to them for being involved with a person of another race? i know my cousin married a white chick and her family doesnt talk to us or her daughter at all. <br>  <br>  i think its great when people just love for love but i would hate to live in a world where everyone was mixed up and there werent any distinct groups. diversity is something almost sacred to me and if my race or anyone elses has to disappear for other people stop hating people then let the hate live on. enough of that **** has happened already. i get along with people who arent black and both my parents are black. if i can do it then theres no excuse for anyone else. <br>  <br>  i also find it very comical the way people believe that "races are going to disappear someday!!" what are people smoking? seriously? people have been ******* interracially for centuries and were all not some grotesque shade of grey yet. just because its becoming more socially accepted now than ever doesnt mean that it its a new thing. <br>  <br>  this is random but i once had a discussion about gay marriage with this right wing conservative woman in high school. im completely liberal. she asked if i wanted everyone to be gay years from now because thats what will happen if we let them marry. i almost died.|`|9ip0dCL5aa	Well its sure is decreasing the black population thats for sure.

For example, my mother doesn't like blacks, and I am half black.|`|AIuN5Lw9aa	Being exposed to other races and cultures on a regular basis highly decreases racism. Period.|`|jdKTs3aHaa	Some people do actually hate some other people in their family for different reasons. I think racial mixing gives racist people more things to complain about. Since people are having biracial children it kills their idea of a "master race" or they simply just don't like it b/c in their mind it's only a "black and white couple" thing. But this shouldn't discourage people from dating outside their race. Even if some how there were no interracial relationships there will still be racism.|`|VhBW7AjAaa	Only in certain ways. It gives individuals a much more broad understanding of others. Fear is much less likely to form, thereby steering that specific individual away from heading down a "path of hate".  <br>  <br>  However, some individuals use the "I'm mixed" bit in attempts to justify their prejudices and ignorance. I've seen happen plenty of times. The person may harshly criticize a specific ancestry, yet when they are called out on their ignorance by others, they will deny their own prejudice by saying something along the lines of "I'm not racist, I'm even part _______.", and instantly assume they will be forgiven. They believe that being mixed gives them greater right to nitpick at the ancestry in their veins and impose their hubris on people, when in reality it does not.<br>  <br>  The idea, which almost implies that persons of mixed ancestry are automatically less racist, can lead us to a sense of reverse prejudice (a "positive stereotype") and yet another double standard if we're not careful.|`|ohUm00RYaa	Nope I know cases where it makes it worse.<br>  <br>  Ie. a white woman has a black kid and her family rejects the kid so she just stops talking to them.<br>  <br>  Sometime people who claim not to be racist turn racist when a certain race eneters the family|`|FKxrJxbPaa	lmaooo you would be suprised<br>  <br>  <br>  Nations like Brazil and the Dominican Republic are made up of mostly Mixed-race people and they still have major racial issues.|`|A9EydXySaa	theres hope.<br>  <br>  but me and my guatemalan/el slavadorian boyfriend<br>  and me irish/german<br>  <br>  will have our mixed baby <3 daysi luarel de leon.<br>  <br>  haha :] maybe our baby will help stop racisam

No, we don't support it like a religion, but we do defend it from misinformation. That's two totally different things.    We don't want people to support Atheism as though it's a religion. Either you're an Atheist, or you're not.    -  Also, note that Religulous was only shown in 500 cinemas, in a country where only a minority are Atheists, and the majority abhor Atheism.

Religulous, therefore, grossed about $0.44 per non-believer and Fireproof grossed about $0.21 per Christian.    You should ask why Christians don't support their own message.    Of course, your question is also flawed in assuming that only atheists went to see Religulous and only Christians went to see Fireproof.

And atheists only generally respond to bigoted religions.  You don't see atheists challenging the claims of Wiccans and Buddhists so much, do you?    But see what would happen if a Wiccan tried to legislate their beliefs into government...or began branding non-Wiccans as 'corrupt' etc...    then their 'authority' would be questioned...then the mocking would begin.

Abraham's wife couldn't have kids so she asked Abraham to lay with his maid servant although God didn't want this to happen because He would soon allow Abraham's wife to have a child.  The child they had was named Ishmael (born of the maid servant) because of this God told Abraham that Ishmael's descendants would be a thorn in his side, but the promise was gonna come from Abraham's wife.  <br>  <br>  So later on God blessed Abraham's wife with a child named Isaac.  Ishmael's descendants and Isaac's descendants went separate directions and always had conflict with each other.  Isaac, later on through the lineage, led to Jesus and the Christian faith.  Ishmael, later on through the lineage, led to Muhammad and the Islamic faith.<br>  <br>  Still to this day Iran wants to wipe Israel off of the map.  They are fighting a religious war all the way back from Abraham's sons, Isaac and Ishmael.<br>  <br>  so technically Yes, they are the same God but somewhere the down the line the views were twisted by Islam thus writing the Quaran as there bible with totally twited views like violence towards Israel.  They are like opposites.  <br>  <br>  Think about it....God vs Satan....in human form|`|AA11374244	Muhammad named the Moon god "Thee God" so he couldn't be traced. Jehovah and Jesus are not part of Islams worship. Islam translates Jesus as Esau and also believes in killing the seed promised in Isaac in the Christian faith. They believe that Ishmael is the chosen of God. Real Christians trust God to avenge their enemies and Islam avenges and kills them as their duty to Allah.|`|qpjorXRnaa	hmmm, okay, God and Jehovah are the same person....the only difference between jews and Christians is that we as Christians believe the messiah has come...Jesus, while the jews believe that the messiah has not come yet, and we as Christians believe that his grace has done away with the law- try reading Romans chapter 5- while the jews believe that the law is still necessary... now allah is not the same God as Jehovah and our God, allah is the creator, but is unnaprochable, while God, Jehovah is always there for us, allah is prone to temper changes and angriness, while Jehovah God is firm and unmovable...hope I helped!|`|SbN2cXE5aa	No, one is the True God, the other is the invention of Muhammad. <br>  <br>  Louis Farrakhan's "Islamic Nation" is not recognized by most if not all the rest of the Muslim world.|`|FOzN3xwzaa	No. <br>  <br>  The truth is that Jesus is God.<br>  <br>  But Islam rejects this truth, therefore Islam clearly has a different and fake "god" that cannot save anyone.|`|NjYCvfYGaa	I don't believe they are the exact same person.<br>  Same origins yes, but not the same exact person.|`|wGftCjJUaa	watch this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYiHvFzZ1jc&feature=channel_page" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYiHvFzZ1...</a>|`|cdFqekzZaa	Same.

The Bible says that God is a Spirit.<br>  No they are not the same. One, Jehovah God, is the True Living God, the Creator of the Earth, and the stars and planets. THIS ALLAH god IS NOT THE ONE TRUE GOD.<br>  The Islamics, Muslims and the Muslims who follow Louis Farrakhan are being lied to. Even Malcolm X discovered that the Black Muslin organization in America was led by a false prophet. They murdered him with the encouragement or condoning of Louis Farrakhan. Farrakhan admitted on world wide TV on the Arsenio Hall Show that he has stated that Malcolm X "was worthy of death." The use of the Bible and the use of the popular painting of Jesus to justify the oppression and enslavement of Black people turned off many American Blacks and has made it easy to feed the half truths and lies fed to them by Louis Farrakhan and his predecessors. (The popular painting of "Jesus Christ" is only the uncle of the guy that painted the picture. )Farrakhan who denounced the slavery in America never, to my knowledge denounced the killing, oppression and enslavement of Black Christians in today's North African nations. <br>  A number of former Islamics/Muslims have gone on camera testifying that the KORAN AND ISLAM IS PLAIN WRONG.<br>  Jesus Christ was resurrected from the dead on the third day of His Crucifixion on the Cross.(Christians use a Cross as a sort of tool to mark who they are. Islamics use a Crescent moon because they worship the seventh century Arabian mood god.) Jesus was placed in a tomb and guarded by Roman troops. He came out of that tomb ALIVE. Mohamed or Muhammad is still dead.<br>  Google Frederick KC Price and/or Ever increasing Faith and/or Crenshaw Christian Center to get more info and confirmation. Just don't take my word for it or the words of others here. <br>  Christians are not perfect, just forgiven. By the way, many who call themselves "Christians" are not real Christians.  Many Islamics including the Elijah Mohamed never practiced what they preach. Malcolm X discovered this and left that organization and was killed for it.|`|prvdZlH4aa	no its not ask any muslim or christian|`|AxpHgbwvaa	A definitive yes. They all refer to the same god or God.

But if a person doesn't share the morals of the mainstream fear of breaking the law might prevent them from committing a crime.<br>  <br>  As for religion. It depends. Sometimes it stops people committing crimes just as human laws do.<br>  <br>  But sometimes people can interpret religious texts the "wrong way" and since religious people may believe holy law to be greater than human law this can lead to doing more "wrong" by definition of the mainstream.<br>  <br>  An example would be keeping slaves. Most people consider that to be morally wrong even though religious texts are for it.|`|P5MMxGxHaa	Usually they try to do so, although the result is not as expected sometimes. <br>  <br>  Because they are hungry till evening, they get angry and fight with people or use badwords... <br>  <br>  In my opinion, people should not fast, if they can not endure hunger and if they disturb other people when they are fasting. Fasting is more precious, when people can continuoue their daily life as it is before.|`|Rb84jDiEaa	yea i guess so, its all about their character.  Sometimes we get good ppl with a nice character who aren't religious and then vice versa.  In the end whether ur muslim or not, its all about ur intentions.|`|5vA7kkeyaa	I believe people do avoid doing wrong as long as it does not put them at a perceived disadvantage, if they perceive it does, all bets are off.|`|WyjRm10jaa	Punishment..|`|1ZVtTII8aa	I think for most people it's a bit of all of them, for me it is, anyway... :P|`|4sc7bMbkaa	i think law|`|OvYNWnQ0aa	I think that most people minus of course the exceptions, avoid wrong because society pushes them to do so and to teach their kids this. it then becomes a psychological programming that most follow because they know that path well and dont want to breach what they know. Why does Society do it is the other question?<br>  I say half is common sense (natural morals) and the other half is religion. Law doesnt count because its based on those 2|`|v93T1z2Aaa	Yes. because we are not being judged on the outcome of things, we are being judged on our choices. This means that at the core of everything will always be our intentions. Whatever we intended, is what we will have the reward for. Each person will be judged according to what Allah gave them to work with, how they used it and what they intended to do with it.<br>  <br>  As regards the actual "Judgment Day" - Allah tells us that everything we are doing is being recorded and not a single tiny thing escapes from this record. Even an atom's weight of good will be seen on the Day of Judgment and even a single atom's weight of evil will be seen too.<br>  <br>   On That Day (of judgment) mankind will proceed in scattered groups and they will be shown their deeds.<br>   So whoever does good equal to the weight of an atom, shall see it.<br>   And whoever does evil equal to the weight of an atom, shall see it. [Noble Quran 99:6-8] <br>  <br>  The one who will bring the evidences against us will be ourselves. Our ears, tongue, eyes and all of our bodies will begin to testify against us in front of Allah on the Day of Judgment. None will be oppressed on that Day, none will be falsely accused.<br>  <br>  Allah could have put everyone in their respective places from the very beginning, but the people would complain as to why they were thrown in Hell without being given a chance. This life is exactly that; a chance to prove to ourselves who we really are and what we would really do if we indeed had a free choice.<br>  <br>  Allah Knows everything that will happen, but we don't. That is why the test is fair.|`|PExIfZxxaa	Im not sure about others but as far as muslims are concern YES they avoid doing wrong because of islam.For muslim or muslimah nothing is more important then religion.And muslims wants to follow only Allah and for Him, We muslims can avoid anything..<br>  Salam|`|NlQhkgFCaa	I try to stay away from wrong for the pleasure of Allah and because I try and constantly maintain consciousness of my beloved Allah <br>  <br>  Others might have their own reasons|`|AA11097451	Sometimes i fear God and i really mean it ....... sometimes i do something bad and then i think like wow what if i died 2morrow? ill be in hell for sure ..... i like to think like that.|`|xtI9RmNZaa	I think yes.|`|g54tGcRvaa	When I think about hurting someone I don't think "Aw shucks, that would be breaking a rule," I think "I shouldn't, I wouldn't like it if someone did that to me."  I can have a code of conduct based on this principle, but that's different from a religion.|`|7Q33v5hOaa	I believe its to do with religion mostly for those who follow a religion for those who are not religious they avoid doing wrong cos of the law but also Everyone in general avoid doing wrong also cos of past experiences because of the consequences of those wrongs.|`|bZo5Z53Uaa	Hmm see with this question there is alot to take into account.<br>  <br>  If the people followed their religion carefully, the religion itself teaches about good morals etc, hence they strive their up most best not to transgress the laws, thus the law really does not have an impact, as religion is foremost.<br>  <br>  However there are those who fear the Law more rather than their Creator (which is a shame really)..<br>  <br>  So it can be all mixed in one.|`|H8WqMK1eaa	I saw this quote somewhere:<br>  <br>  "A good man usually does good, and an evil man usually does evil...but it takes religion to make a good man do evil."|`|z0y9x4aiaa	I think about religion but i don't know about everyone else|`|nvH62xo5aa	I think people do things because of what other people think.
ltwC6Bv1aa	I am certainly not a fan of religions, but I think it's in human nature to start wars, to be racist, and to do crimes. The only thing you might solve by omitting religion is ignorance. Religions start feed ignorant people and prevent them from seeing further than a dusty old book. If there were no religion, there would be less aids, less teenage-pregnancies, less silly questions about the bigbang and evolution and more scientific progress, and such.    And morals need not come from religion!!|`|7vk4xoKZaa	I would like to think that too .. it would be amazing. But I also think religion and laws help keep us in line. They help give us a set of morals. Where would we get them if there was no religion... all of the laws basically came from the bible. Killing, stealing etc. I think in our time right now it would be pretty chaotic. Great song though!|`|d6959f140445530c8d381f41dd69fcecaa	Religion is good on so many ways.  Then there are the fanatics that misinterpret the teachings and end up killing in the name of religion.    I know a person that was killed in a car accident because he was wearing his seat belt.  Do you think we should do away with all car seat belts?  No, of course not.  For every person that dies because of it, there are thousands that have been saved by the belt.|`|sVQ0IB0Gaa	I wouldn't want to live here.|`|LjsRfaskaa	Yes, it would be a much better place without religion.

But I'm looking forward to the Christian rapture, when thier sky fairy comes and sucks them all up. This will leave all the rest in peace from the hypocrocy and bible bashing.

Then there would be no brain washing|`|SlkAl1G2aa	Simply, no. Although religion may cause a myriad of disputes and even wars; it is an essential part of human nature.

No religion wouldn't mean no wars. It would simply mean there would be no religious wars.|`|o0BdXbwpaa	I don't think it's naive. John was trying to make sense of things and that's what he came up with. Religion is too objectified and removed from our ordinary experience. Heaven is seen as some other place and if you just 'believe' in some concept then you'll be transformed magically. Well, this kind of thinking has not helped anyone change. We need a more practical kind of spirituality, a way to look at our very real and current minds and conditions and change them to have a better life and world. Religion is just confusion for most people and a reason to feel superior to others. Confusion.|`|FYQe54Akaa	Okay; the world would not be a better place without religion. For almost ten years my life is all about Christ; it's got nothing to do with me.

What he refers is that the world would be more peaceful if we get rid of those things that divide us like our race, religion, possessions.     Unfortunately with religion, even in its best applicable form still segregates against a smaller group (homosexuals, condones slavery or prejudice, or simply divides according to who's closer to God), thus does not truly unite people with acceptance and compassion.

Most of us are "asleep".  We live in our individual dreams.  Our dreams are influenced by the "dream of the world" (or society's dream).      But because our waking dream is anchored to the material world, we think it really represents the Truth.  And our ego feeds this belief.  The ego feeds the belief in the dream, because to truly be "awake" means death to the ego.      As for the answer about those who think they are wiser than everyone....  Oh, I know I'm not wise.

Such is life. Allah subhana wa ta'ala (God ...Glorious and Exalted is He) knows best.     In the words of Hazra Inayat Khan:    "All things are good but all things are not good for every person, nor right at all times'.    'What is good for one may be very bad for another. For one it may be very good to be a nun or sit all day in a church or a mosque, but for another may need to go to the cafe and learn the meanings of the experiences gained there.'    'FOR everything there is a time, so there comes a time for the unfoldment of the soul - but the period of that development depends upon the speed of the progress man makes through life.'    and......    ' Enlightenment must come little by little-otherwise it would overwhelm.' ~ Idries Shah    'Happy are those who find fault with themselves instead of finding fault with others.' ~ Prophet Muhammad (salallahu 'alayhi wa salaam)    Finally:     ' If someone remarks: "What an excellent man you are!" and this pleases you more than his saying, "What a bad man you are!" know that you are still a bad man.' ~ Sufyan al Thawri      How can anyone be sure whole-heartedly that they are NOT "asleep" even if they think that they are 'awake' and that they question and seek answers regarding everything! Only Allah subhana wa ta'ala (God...Glorious and Exalted is He) knows who is truly awake. We are ordinary lowly humans, all of us, so we are all at least partially-asleep in the sense we are perhaps in part hypnotised by our prejudices, fears, and all other ego-traits. These negative ego-traits are dark veils that need to be removed by the grace of Allah subhana wa ta'ala.    Glory be to God most Great and Worthy of Praise  Subhana Allahi azim wa bihamdi.    ? Peace.
KR64fnHjaa	Of course religion affects all of us.

Obviously the main feature of the organization is animal rights, but that doesn't mean members don't care about people. Just like human rights groups still might care about animals.|`|N2PcehV4aa	They probably care about animals and humans equally. I had an interesting conversation with a PETA member about her vegetarianism. She stated she would not eat any animals because all animals and humans 'are equal'. So it would be morally wrong for a human to eat a cat? I asked. 'Yes, humans and cats are equal' she said. 'What about something much smaller like a mouse?' I asked further. She responded by saying 'It would be wrong to eat a mouse too as Humans and mice are also equal'. So to clarify, I asked 'you are saying humans, cats, and mice are all equal? If that is true, then your logic suggests it is morally wrong for a cat to eat a mouse'.    Personally I am against any undue avoidable suffering which some animals may endure, such as certain farming methods where chickens and pigs cannot even move because of the cages they are trapped inside. Nevertheless, I see no problem with eating meat or using animals for medical testing (I am against testing on animals for cosmetics) so long as any suffering is reduced as much as possible.|`|WAoNhHB1aa	I am all for the ethical treatment of animals, but PETA is CrAzY!!!!!    WHAT!?  They want it illegal to have pets?!  Well, too bad, because I'm not giving up my pets to nobody!!  No way, no how, no chance, if PETA has a problem, PETA can kiss my butt!!  And it would hurt  animals because more animals will be feral, and they will get hurt, and if PETA tries to take my pets away from me, THEY'LL get hurt.  Animals need a loving home to take care of them.  If somebody abuses their pets (go to hell animal abusers!), then the pets should get taken away, but if the people are like me and my family give their pets food, love, shelter, and water and all that, then there's no reason.    And animal shelters are good too (no-kill shelters, that is) because animals need somewhere to live if they haven't been adopted yet.  If something happened to me and I couldn't take care of my pets, and nobody else would or could take them, I'd rather have them in a cage where they'd be fed every day, given water, given a litter box, taken to the vet, cared for, and in my dog's case, walked, than have them wandering the streets all skinny and possibly get hurt.    PETA can go suck a d*** if they see otherwise.|`|Gm5u4vWUaa	The problem with PETA is that they don't think about the outcome of some of the causes they champion.  Some of their initiatives end up hurting animals in the long run.  Here's a few examples.    PEAT want's it illegal for anyone to own any animal as a pet.  First of all do you realize just how domesticated Many breeds of Dog or Cat have become?  Do you really think these animals would survive out in the wild?    PETA believes Animal Shelters are cruel and frequently boycotts many in the Los Angeles Area:   Much like owning pets, they feel that the way the dogs and cats are kept in cages is cruel and inhuman, and as depressing as that may be, it is a necessity.  If PETA had their way animal shelters would cease to exist and we'd have 3 times the amount of stray dogs and cats running loose.  BAD IDEA!  Also in 2006 PETA euthanized more animals than they rescued.    PETA is against the seal hunt:  Yes, there are a lot of people who are not affiliated with PETA who are against the seal hunt.  The problem is those who participate in it are doing so to help feed their families and pay their bills.  The Club used (Hakapik) to kill seals is considered by the WSPCA, Canadian Humane Society, and WWF to be the most effective and humane way to kill a seal.  They simply fall asleep and don't wake up.  If it were a group of millionaires doing it for sport every year I could agree, but this is someone's livelihood we are talking about.  Also with a decline in Polar Bear populations, Seal populations are on the rise and the 700,000 - 850,000 seals killed every year doesn't even come close to affecting the estimated 98 million world population.    There are a lot of other problems with PETA...to many to go into right now|`|Pdex43zgaa	They care about people that care about animals. They also care about the animals.

They're very drastic in their measures.  They advocate against people owning animals.  They don't care about the animals, small dogs  wouldn't survive a week without humans.  If I want to own a dog, I will own a dog.  They wanted Hamburg to re-name as Veggieburg.  I'm NOT lying.  And they do half the things they're against.  Oh, and sea kittens? Really?|`|yynC47EMaa	Here's my take on it. We people have many many groups looking out for us as it should be. We have the Red cross, the Salvation Army, the church and all kinds of soup kitchens, homeless groups and everything else looking out for us and for some reason, we can't find anything better to do in our spare time than fck with and kill defenseless animals and I'm not talking about killing them to eat but just because we felt like shooting something today or torturing something today.  So where as I see PETA's tactics as extreme, someone has to look out for animals right? If that's what they want to dedicate their lives to then I don't have a problem with them, they are just one group it's not like there are 50 PETA groups out there.

We educate the forengers easier than we do our own people, feed the poor in other countries when right here at home were getting more and more destitude. And we take it on the chin for the people who cant defend them selves, after that, we try to impart our ideals and sense of demoacy and humanity and were again, shat on. Its Bull really that so many hate us, if lets say Iraq sent us some lunch money, wouldnt they tout there beliefs when they were doing it? Of course they would. If Canada had to defend us from mexico, would they ever let us for get it? Not likely! I am American, and i Want to help others, but I get so sick of the international community bashing us. Nothings free and if in exchange for our aide, we ask that you try to be a better human, by respecting the people around you why is that seen as such a affront.

Occasionally we find a passage of scripture that speak very directly to a particular issue, but much of life is about understanding scripture as a whole, and thinking. 'Please will someone show me a verse' often looks like shorthand for 'I'm a lazy Christian who can't be bothered to learn the whole bible and do some serious thinking'.    The fact is, abortion is not much discussed, if at all, in the bible. Neither are a lot of important moral issues. You can take two views on this. One is essentially secular, the other is essentially theological. You can say (the secular view) 'there's nothing in the bible about it, so we make up our own minds', or you can say (the theological view) 'everything in the bible is about abortion, so we read the whole bible and work out what God would have us think about it'. What amazes me is how many Christians choose the secular option. The 'show me a verse' attitude is straight from the secular tradition.|`|AA11308757	if you are a christian, you should own a bible. if you own a bible, find them yourself.|`|NjPjpewlaa	All the verses that say Do Not Kill.

lDEGaK7Laa	By abortionist do you mean the doctor who performs the abortion?<br>  <br>  That's the only real meaning of the term.<br>  <br>  Pro-choice is not synonymous with "abortionist" or "pro-abortion."<br>  <br>  EDIT: Good! My answer, then, is for all the people who don't understand that important distinction.|`|06Z3fh4laa	Abortionists....well then.|`|eBKJRmEgaa	No, I'm not. <br>  I am pro-choice, but that doesn't mean I'm pro-abortion!|`|35ff9d3ad1eb64812f64b2031173d7e4aa	I'm pro-choice, and I wouldn't consider myself evil. Sure I'm not perfect, but is anybody perfect?<br>  <br>  In no way does having an abortion mean that you lack a conscious.<br>  In fact, I believe that your own conscious and thoughts should influence whether you have an abortion or not, not other people or your religion. <br>  <br>  It's is an extremely person choice, and that's why I'm pro-choice in the first place. It simply isn't, and never will be, my decision. Would I personally have an abortion? No. Would I prefer that you give up the child to a family who wants another? Yes, but again it's not my choice.<br>  <br>  I find it difficult to put myself in someone else's shoes, period. I imagine that for that young girl it must be very frightening, not only the procedure, but the response for her "religiously oriented" classmates. It happens all too often, unfortunately.|`|rTplTuEdaa	There have been many  young girl,s who have had abortion,s<br>    and then have trouble in there mind,s where they have to seek help<br>     some can't sleep they hear  there baby crying and thing,s like that<br>    so yes  I  do think people who are for abortion,s are evil,,no way  could  I  ever take the life of a precious baby.|`|7cBOKehWaa	They're only evil if they don't pass the fetus's on to me for my Babby-B-Qs|`|IYe1TTwYaa	I believe that the abortion industry has them brainwashed to the point that they do not honor their own bodies which actually degrades the woman. So no I do not other than those that actually perform the abortions on the women. The Abortionists know that they are killing a living baby and are without excuse.|`|QrBReRQbaa	Cakes the Heathen,<br>  <br>  The Christian Faith and others teach that this is the only life time in which we live.  For others --- we believe that life is everlasting both in Spirit form and human.  If a baby's purpose is for a brief encounter inutero then it will have learned her/his lesson or purpose.  If this soul on the other hand was meant to stay---then it will find another way in which to retransition in human form. <br>  <br>  It is okay for you to have your beliefs----I honor that. I do not like other's beliefs to be imposed upon me.  So if I am indeed evil in your mind---<br>  so be it.|`|pVdV4gwgaa	No.Im pro-choice and im not evil. I just believe it is the woman's choice wether she has one or not. I in no way condone abortion. That is the difference between being pro-choice and being an abortionist.

One is: Is it a baby?  The other is: Is it justified?<br>  <br>  Is it a baby?  Well, it's not the father.  It's not the mother.  Left alone, it will become a baby, even if the mother dies before giving birth.  The blood of the baby never mixes with the blood of the mother.  They are completely separated by the placenta.  That might be part of the mother.  That's debatable.  If you debate that, you have to be skewing your mind.<br>  <br>  Is it just?  Why shouldn't the mother keep the baby?  She is scared of the birthing process?  She doesn't have money to take care of it?  She doesn't want to feel for it when she has to give it up?  I mean, these are some pretty lame arguments when compared with the question is whether it's murder.  I mean, if I'm really angry with the way someone hurt me, and I want to kill them, is that feeling any less valid?  If I can't take care of my kids now and don't want to give them away, why shouldn't I drown them in the bathtub?  Clearly it's because it's unjustified... murder!<br>  <br>  I put myself in the woman's place, and I come to the conclusion that even if having kids is hard (as I have 3), it's not reason enough to kill them.<br>  <br>  Now whether they feel it when they commit the deed is irrelevant.  If the president doesn't feel it when he makes the choice to drop a nuke, does it really matter?  No, what matters is the fact that the nuke took 50k lives as a result... or it saved 200k lives, however you want to see it.<br>  <br>  From the Epistle of Barnabas:<br>  Thou shalt love thy neighbour more than <br>  thine own soul.(10) Thou shalt not slay the child by procuring abortion; <br>  nor, again, shalt thou destroy it after it is born.<br>  <br>  So give me your thumbs down.  Choose another as a best answer.  Ignoring it doesn't change the fact that it is evil.|`|19JkC34Xaa	No because people think they're so high and mighty, they don't think about what it's really like to be a young girl and have an incredibly difficult choice. It doesn't mean they're evil, the messed up, just like everyone else does. If you don't like abortions, don't get one and STFU.|`|Es2QJ44Uaa	No.  People are always looking to call people evil.  Abortion is a sad sad situation.  But I am pro-choice because I do believe sometimes it is well.....Not sure how to put it.  it is never the best choice, but it happens.

What is the country of origin for the size in question? The US is generally the only country I'm aware of that uses size "S," but you never know, and even that is too general. "Smaller than S" could mean smaller than S for teens, young boys or girls, or infants, all of which are different sizes. Give a specific age group, so they can better answer your question. The assumption that it would be "great business" is one that everyone would make, so you should eliminate it from the request, as it has no bearing on whether or not they can help you.    Try something like this instead:    "Our business has received many requests for [insert children's age group]'s t-shirts in sizes smaller than the standard American Small size. Does your company make shirts in such sizes? If not, can you refer us to one that does?"

People these days don't even know what it is for!!! Since many denominations tie it to the idea of believing the Christ died for our sins... but that would be impossible, since baptisms were going on before the crucifixion.

If you read the book of Acts you will note that all who are converted and become Christian are Baptized....|`|AA10034051	Please ignore such people as CJ. He is a fundy Christian who picks and chooses what he believes and does not believe in the bible and makes his own interpretation of the bible which is a sin.    Jesus Christ commanded that we are to be baptized    John 3:3,5 - Jesus says, "Truly, truly, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God." When Jesus said "water and the Spirit," He was referring to baptism (which requires the use of water, and the work of the Spirit).             BAPTISM:    is done FOR the forgiveness of sins (Acts 2:38)    is done to SAVE us (1Peter 3:21, Acts 2:40, Mark 16:16)    Is done to WASH AWAY OUR SINS (Acts 22:16)    is done to be REBORN to new life (John 3:5, Romans 6:3-6)    is done to CLOTHE ourselves with Christ (Gal 3:26-27)    is done so that GOD will RESURRECT us from death (Colossians 2:12, Romans 6:3-6)    is done as a REQUIRMENT to enter heaven (John 3:5, Mark 16:16)    is done to put us INTO CHRIST (Romans 6:3-6, Galatians 3:26-27, 1Corinthians 12:13)    Peter explained what happens at baptism when he said, "Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit" (Acts 2:38). But he did not restrict this teaching to adults. He added, "For the promise is to you and to your children and to all that are far off, every one whom the Lord our God calls to him" (2:39). We also read: "Rise and be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling on his name" (Acts 22:16). These commands are universal, not restricted to adults. Further, these commands make clear the necessary connection between baptism and salvation, a   connection explicitly stated in 1 Peter 3:21: "Baptism . . . now saves you, not as a removal of dirt from the body but as an appeal to God for a clear conscience, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ."|`|VFWRdAH3aa	the water in Baptism  represents the cleansing away of all sin and should be done as soon as possible.|`|WQvqLnnhaa	You shouldnt have to rush into it.

In particular Spirit Roaming my personal favorite. I especially like when she can repeat your answers word for word in other answers to simply mock your audacity and accusing nature.     Water Baptism for babies washes away original sin from their innocent little souls so that they can experience the Sanctifying Grace of the Almighty.

Do not let yourself fall prey to CJ and his "infallible" interpretation of the already somewhat flawed verses he cherrypicked from the KJV.     The Holy Sacrament of Baptism is not only the means by which one is forgiven of their original sin. It is also how one becomes a member of the Body of Christ.     This should answer your question perfectly:   Acts 22:16 `Now why do you delay? Get up and be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling on His name.'    CCC:  1272 Incorporated into Christ by Baptism, the person baptized is configured to Christ. Baptism seals the Christian with the indelible spiritual mark (character) of his belonging to Christ. No sin can erase this mark, even if sin prevents Baptism from bearing the fruits of salvation. Given once for all, Baptism cannot be repeated.  1257 The Lord himself affirms that Baptism is necessary for salvation. He also commands his disciples to proclaim the Gospel to all nations and to baptize them. Baptism is necessary for salvation for those to whom the Gospel has been proclaimed and who have had the possibility of asking for this sacrament. The Church does not know of any means other than Baptism that assures entry into eternal beatitude; this is why she takes care not to neglect the mission she has received from the Lord to see that all who can be baptized are "reborn of water and the Spirit." God has bound salvation to the sacrament of Baptism, but he himself is not bound by his sacraments.      1 Peter 3:21 Corresponding to that, baptism now saves you--not the removal of dirt from the flesh, but an appeal to God for a good conscience--through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,     Acts 2:38 Peter said to them, "Repent, and each of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins; and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.    Ga 3:27 For all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ.      If that's not good enough, the words of Jesus himself:   Mr 16:16 "He who has believed and has been baptized shall be saved; but he who has disbelieved shall be condemned.|`|NjPjpewlaa	In the New testament, first people got saved, then pretty much straight away they were water baptised.

Baptism washes away all sin, including original sin which separates us from God.  It also makes us adopted sons and daughters of God the Father, unites us with the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, and bestows gifts of teh Holy Spirit.    Some fundamentalist Christians have a very poor understanding of Baptism.  I woould invite you and others to read what the Catholic Church teaches about Baptism by going to http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s2c1a1.h...    Why wait?|`|AA10876206	It depends on the christian sect you belong to.  If you are Catholic, water baptism is merely just a sprinkling of water on you.  It should be done right away to wash away your Original Sin so if you were suddenly killed, you wouldn't immediately be sent to hell.  That's why catholics frequently baptize babies... to save them from going to hell if they should die.      In other sects, you can wait a little while.  If they practice full immersion baptism, you could wait for warmer weather.  Just make sure your minister doesn't walk into the water holding a wired mic like that Darwin Award one did.|`|yk7jmSnDaa	hi, fellow christian here as well and yes water baptism is still needed because it is basically a baptism of repentance. The symbolic meaning of it is when you get dipped into water you are dying with Christ and putting off your own self and when you rise you are a new creature in Christ. that is the whole meaning, but as far as when to do it, i would wait until you are ready. don't rush into anything, search yourself and ask God to search it to for when is the best time.      ----CJ---- i couldn't disagree with you more. the bible says that we should practice the new laws without forgetting the latter. Water baptisim is needed and so is the baptism with fire (Holy Ghost Acts 2).

John3:5     Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God .        Acts 2:36-38    36Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made the same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ.     37Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do?     38Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost|`|3WYcPsm4aa	Baptism is not symbolic... it is a drowning of the old Adam and a rebirth as a child of God.   The Holy Spirit enters in and allows the faith that is in your heart to grown and blossom.  It is through the water and the word that we are baptized and saved, whether it is through pouring or immersion.  Of course, if one does not believe anything actually happens and has no faith in the sacrament, then nothing will happen.    Remember, God choose you before you were born.  It is just that you are finally realizing it.  It is God's doing, not yours!|`|LihoWe84aa	you shouldn't rush to do it because god knows that you are started to believe and are now and always will be a member of his family. and YOU know that you are a new member of his family so you don't need to rush yourself to do the water baptism. Do it when you feel ready to and then you can make it official. take a little time to get to know god first. Good Luck!  Rebecca|`|AA11707311	Baptism is the outward show of the act of repentance and belief in Christ. It is not strictly necessary, but as a symbol of being born again, of the spirit and the blood (John 3:5), it marks a believer as a new man.  See Ezekiel 11:19.  It is not something to be trifled with, think about it, decide, and then do it.|`|zHle6Paqaa	Welcome new Christian.   Baptism   Matt 3:13    Then Jesus came from Galilee to John at the Jordan to be baptized by him.   14   John tried to prevent him, saying, "I need to be baptized by you, and yet you are coming to me?"   15   Jesus said to him in reply, "Allow it now, for thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness." Then he allowed him.   16   After Jesus was baptized, he came up from the water and behold, the heavens were opened (for him), and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove (and) coming upon him.   17   And a voice came from the heavens, saying, "This is my beloved Son, 13 with whom I am well pleased."     God finds Baptism Pleasing. Even Jesus was Baptized.    Jn 3:5; Mk 16:16 - baptism required for entering heaven   1Cor 15:21-22 - in Adam all die, in Christ all made alive   Mk 10:14 - let children come; to such belongs the kingdom   Lk 18:15 - people were bringing even infants to him...   Col 2:11-12 - baptism has replaced circumcision   Jos 24:15 - as for me and my house, we will serve Lord   Mt 8:5ff. - daughter healed because of centurion's faith   Mt 15:21ff. - daughter healed because of Canaanite woman's faith   Lk 7:1ff. - just say the word, and let my servant be healed   Acts 16:31 - believe in Lord Jesus you & house will be saved   Acts 16:15 - she was baptized, with all her household   Acts 16:33 - he and all his family were baptized at once   1Cor 1:16 - I baptized the household of Stephanas|`|FGcwxZz0aa	Contrary to what some would tell you who believe in the heresy of antinomianism, Baptism is a Sacrament of our Lord and is necessary for salvation. One can be Baptized by water which is the normative way, by desire if one does not have the opportunity like the thief on the cross and by blood for someone who is martyred for their belief. Here is what Jesus said:    John 3:5 Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.    St. Paul also illustrates the urgency of Baptism when he Baptized the whole family of the jailer including the children of all ages:    Acts 16:25-34-  About midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the other prisoners were listening to them.     26      Suddenly there was such a violent earthquake that the foundations of the prison were shaken. At once all the prison doors flew open, and everybody's chains came loose.     27      The jailer woke up, and when he saw the prison doors open, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself because he thought the prisoners had escaped.      28      But Paul shouted, "Don't harm yourself! We are all here!"      29      The jailer called for lights, rushed in and fell trembling before Paul and Silas.     30      He then brought them out and asked, "Sirs, what must I do to be saved?"      31      They replied, "Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved--you and your household."      32      Then they spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all the others in his house.      33      At that hour of the night the jailer took them and washed their wounds; then immediately he and all his family were baptized.    34 The jailer brought them into his house and set a meal before them; he was filled with joy because he had come to believe in God--he and his whole family.     God bless!    In Christ  Fr. Joseph|`|bI3areCsaa	I agree with SJC,Swat 59 and the Misses!|`|7vk4xoKZaa	Hey I am also a new christian. From just reading the book The Stranger by John R. Cross (which basically sums up all the important notes of the bible and explains everything - I recommend reading it!) Water Baptism was basically a form of public display to show everyone that you have given yourself to the lord. It is not absolutely necessary. The relationship you have with god is between you and him and that's the main thing that matters. Since Christ was baptized I would recommend doing it when you feel ready since it is part of the christian religion. I have been holding off until I feel I understand enough to feel really confident about doing it in front of people. But just remember that it is important what is between you and god.   Good luck!|`|k7FD3rt5aa	Water baptism is needed.    Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.  John 3:5.    It is part of salvation.

Water baptism is not required for salvation, water baptism cannot save a single person, water baptism doesn't wash away anything, and water baptism cannot be added to Jesus's perfect salvation.      Rather, water baptism is a celebration that a person is ALREADY saved by Jesus.  And if you never get water baptised, it's okay. I will say, it is fun to do  :)  But it is fine if you wait or never do it.     Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation.     The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross and rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what!     Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)

It will be like having Christmas every day with the same things to eat, drink and do while existing in the same place for eternity.

One thing we can say though is that we were made to be dynamic in nature and we would quickly get bored with little to do,so it is only logical that in Heaven we will not be simply passive but will have endless variety as Jesus hinted at.

I refuse to.|`|6YbxTlDCaa	sounds girly/gay|`|Ra8cdjbDaa	hahha... funny.<br>  <br>  1. to mess with you.<br>  2. because they most likely know about your whole thong obsession.<br>  3. The probably find you and your willingness to have fun with it more hot than the actually wearing of the thong!  Guys in thongs disgust me as a matter of fact.<br>  4. come on, that's comparative<br>  5. Not gay... but not butch either... I wouldn't want to go out with a guy who I knew was wearing a thong.|`|tvy2K59haa	QUESTIONS:<br>  Needless to say, I'm on day four of the challenge and have some embarrassing questions:<br>  <br>  1) Why do girls want to grab my butt all the time after hearing I'm wearing a thong? (not complaining)<br>  <br>  They're probably joking around.<br>  <br>  2) Why do girls feel compelled to give me a wedgie after hearing I'm wearing a thong? (complaining)<br>  <br>  They're just friendly teasing you.<br>  <br>  3) SInce doing this lots of girls have been flirting with me and showing me their thongs, do they actually find this hot?<br>  <br>  Eww, as a girl, so not hot.<br>  <br>  <br>  4) I squirmed around the whole first day trying to get rid of the permanent wedgie feeling. By the second day though I got used to them and it has since been rather confortable. The girl who bought them said I was "just a natural thonger" because I got used to them so quickly. This freaked me out. How long should it have taken to get used to them? <br>  <br>  One Second? She probably just meant cuz ur a guy.<br>  <br>  5) I actually think they're comfy and I love all the female interest (guys don't even say anything because of all the attention). I definately will go back to boxers as my primary underwear since thongs kinda make me feel like less of a man, but I was wondering if it would be acceptable to wear one every now and then after the challenge is over or would that be too gay? Way Gay. <br>  <br>  This seems fake...how would girls even know ur wearin a thong?|`|3nDzEIxiaa	Ha ha that is AWESOME!! I don't think there is anything wrong with a guy being a natural thonger and wearing them after the challenge is up to your preference, but you might catch a bit of negative attention from guys at school if they find out about it.|`|akvrwpywaa	Maybe they think you're gay because of it, so they figure "eh, what the hell?"|`|CrfJYgtqaa	Awww Youre cute =] <br>  Its totally okay to wear thongs.<br>  even AFTER ur challege. lol|`|6GWctkQzaa	You've been pressuring them to wear one so they want to make you a little mad. I guess it'd be okay... but idk.|`|dXmyqgtdaa	how do they know u're wearing one?|`|3LjMWownaa	rofl, kudos to you for actually accepting the challenge lol<br>  <br>  I guess if your secure with your masculinity there's no reason not to wear it every now and then, and whats to lose anyways?  You've been doing so for 4 days and it doesn't sound like its that bad :P<br>  <br>  However, I would not do it because .. well... I'm just not that outgoing lol<br>  <br>  gl to you sir, enjoy :D|`|VTGm3UNBaa	Lol! I'm glad you actually did it. <br>  <br>  1) because they think its funny<br>  2) because they think its funny<br>  3) They admire that you're willing to do this. It's not normal anyone to give up their personal comfort zone in order to "walk in another shoes"<br>  4) Beats me. I got used to them very quickly too. It depends on which ones you get though. I wouldent go for any other brand if you like the ones you have.<br>  5) Go for it. Be comfortable enough with your manhood to wear man-thongs. If a guy gives you sh1t about it, just tell him you like the female attention. If a girl gives you sh1t about it, just tell her "I'm comfortable with my sexuality. I am doing this because I admire females wearing thongs and would like to experience this myself. It allows me to know that the thing i'm admiring does not cause the girl any pain or discomfort. Don't you think their a little hot? :p" The kindness will throw her off completely and make her think your a saint. The sarcasm will show your not gay, but infact do enjoy the female attention. <br>  <br>  Happy thong wearing!

After one examines the 20th century, we come to recognize that secularism has as much or more blood on their hands as does religion.  If atheists would stop using this "religion kills" argument, I assure you the accusations you speak of would end.<br>    Personally, in the hands of anyone, no matter what their ideology, power can kill unmercifully.

GF1NPlBSaa	I am a Baha'i, and our religion does not center around Jesus.  Jesus is considered a Manifestation of God, one of a progressive line of Manifestations sent down to mankind with God's message for the era.  To that effect we recognize Jesus and Christianity as legitimate, and as part of our religious "heritage"; but the Baha'i Faith is centered around Baha'u'llah and the message Baha'u'llah brought to "update" the message espoused in Christianity (and other religions).|`|AA11503457	I believe the monies think Rev. moon usurped Jesus, but I'm not sure.|`|ki0tOVUYaa	no|`|UV6osJh8aa	The Baha'i and the Unification people take truths from different religions and recognize religious leaders from all religions.<br>  So, they believe in Jesus as one of the messengers or incarnations of God, but their faith does not center on him, but gives him a place alongside other messengers or incarnations. (Buddha for example.)<br>  <br>  Thus their faith does not center on Jesus of Nazareth.

Everybody makes small mistakes on a regular basis; the prayer Jesus taught is standard, and the feelings it expresses may be used daily or many times a week.  This simply acknowledges that we all are sinners and recognize that through Christ we receive forgiveness.     There is no particular feeling of guilt in these cases at all.  On occasion a person commits a more serious sin, hopefully rarely.  In those cases, one must confess the sin in prayer to God through Christ.  A serious effort must be made not to repeat sins.    If a Christian becomes a worker of lawlessness he is damned.|`|6jN3g0x8aa	Pretty much.

Guilt is really something that we feel all the time after we have been forgiven of our sins. After God forgives us we now have to forgive ourselves and that's where most people feel so bad and so disgusting then they begin to sin all over again with the feeling of unworthyness.     It's hard but guilt is something that we shouldn't have to feel but we do anyway and that's the reason why we aren't good enough, but he loves us anyway.|`|brsm58fAaa	It was very common for me.

Then there is no reason to feel guilty.    Php 3:8  Yea doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ,   Php 3:9  And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith:   Php 3:10  That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death;   Php 3:11  If by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead.   Php 3:12  Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect: but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus.   Php 3:13  Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before,   Php 3:14  I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.   Php 3:15  Let us therefore, as many as be perfect [mature], be thus minded: and if in any thing ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you.   Php 3:16  Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same thing.|`|WQvqLnnhaa	Once you are born again, your sins, all of them, past, present and future are forgiven....Now that doesnt give you a license to sin....    As far as guilt... yes, thats called a conscience. God gave that to you so that you know right from wrong.    Godly sorrow and repentance are ongoing.  2Cor 7:10 for godly sorrow works repentance which leads to salvation.

The closest is the tabari Hadiths, which paint a pretty ugly picture if you read them objectively.<br>  <br>  You might try <a href="http://prophetofdoom.net" rel="nofollow">http://prophetofdoom.net</a> and <a href="http://faithfreedom.org" rel="nofollow">http://faithfreedom.org</a> for expert opinions on Islam from non-muslims.

AA10192697	God didn't create everything about us,  He created mankind.  He created us with a free will.  He knew people would sin against Him and even deny His existence. But He has left mankind, since the beginning, to know their Creator; having conversations with some, like Adam and Eve, Moses, Noah, David, etc. He has given us signs of His existence through miracles.   With our free will, we can choose to believe what we believe.  When people deny God's existence, have they truly tried to find Him or have they lacked the strength to look for Him?  I'm not sure how they really think.    As a parent myself, I knew having a child would be rewarding and tiring. I would have good and bad moments with my child.  But that doesn't stop me from being a mother.  That doesn't make me love him any less.  God created mankind beginning with Adam and Eve. They knew Him personally yet disobedied Him.  It wasn't many generations later that descendents of the first people began to have doubts and some started to deny God.  It's all because God gave us that choice.|`|MU8Z9pIPaa	To make you think and post this answers, i heard many converted!    so there has to be a mixture to make life much interesting and who truly believes in God ..

8rbQBaIeaa	Father-Jn 17:3:   And this is eternal life, that they know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent. (American Standard)  In Jesus= prayer to the Father, he declared him to be the only true God<br>  Son-Jn 3:16-17: 16  For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. 17  For God sent the Son into the world, not to condemn the world, but that the world might be saved through him<br>  Holy Spirit-<br>  There is only one person who shed his blood - Jesus Christ!  So, the Holy Ghost is NOT a third God, but the Lord Jesus Christ!  It is HIS SPIRIT to which we are to listen and who intercedes for mankind, because He IS The Holy Spirit<br>  I had to look these up as I don't have them memorized or would even know the correct way to express myself. Here is my answers describing Father-Son-Holy Spirit|`|tqQIcLb5aa	Interesting. I've never really thought about it but here are my immediate thoughts. <br>  <br>  Jesus taught us to pray "Our Father".<br>  <br>  Jesus when asked "are you the Son of God?" says "I am"<br>  <br>  Jesus promises to send His "Spirit", to distinguish this Spirit we refer to It as the Holy Spirit.<br>  <br>  So I think our terms for describing the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit are ones God has guided us to coin, so to speak. But I suppose that doesn't answer your question "how earthly or human" are they? I think the answer is somehow closely related to the fact that we were made in the "image and likeness" of God. That is. In as much as we are capable of understanding God, we can understand Him through these human terms that we use. (If that makes any sense)|`|cp7regataa	That is deep stuff<br>  We cannot understand God because only Jesus has seen him.  Jesus sent the Holy Spirit to spiritually guide us.

They just like to think they know which is more likely.  It really comes down to people seeing what they want to see.  In my opinion atheism is just as much a religion as any other religion.  They think they know about God already and so do some other faiths.  So here is the question.  Got God?  If you know God he can help answer those assumptions you have always wondered about or ignored and pushed into a dark corner.  If you want to know Jesus preached the Kingdom of God at hand.  If you partake of his Holy Spirit you will never thirst again.  Come, taste and see the Lord is good.  <br>  <br>  By the way what we are seeing manifested as aliens now days may be the very entities that are from the heavenly realm.  Some likely the fallen sons of God (fallen angels offspring).  Some may not be.  As God is likely of a higher dimension I do suspect some of these come from a dimension just above ours but not to Gods dimension.  regardless I have read testimonies of Jesus name causing them to turn tail and flee.  <br>  <br>  if your interested in the dimensions consider looking into string theory or mbrane theory but however I consider salvation by Jesus and the Holy Spirit the most important as its evidence for you to know God.|`|XfZKDnDXaa	Not Dumb, but simply more logical.

Since we have no evidence of gods anywhere, it is rational to disbelieve in them. I assume you disbelieve in many gods because you have seen no evidence of say Zeus, Odin, Krishna, Gichi Manitou.

Because every time one of them crashes, they quickly go to the crash site, in helicopters, and clean up the area real good and then they tell the people it was a UFO what crashed there (in a sense, they're telling the truth because it was one of their UFO's that crashed). "We are being visited by aliens", they say. People believe the lie and stop asking questions about the crash. The UFO story is just another method the U.S. military uses to get people to stop asking questions about their "top secret" (not that secret any more) project. <br>  <br>  To Him who sits on the throne and to the Lamb be praise and honor and glory for ever and ever.

PPyMhRJAaa	You were not wrong at all. This person had no right to do this when you were trying to grieve and I think it's shocking. You should inform the vicar/reverend of the church/parish to let them know that this person is bothering people. As you say, if they choose to do this after the funeral, that is entirely up to them, but it should not interfere in any way with the funeral arrangements.|`|0NcRUSCoaa	No, you had every right to do this. He was preying on vulnerable people at a very distressing time. You did the right thing.|`|Tjr9aObNaa	Nope. I read the tarot and do not/have not charged friends for a reading because i don;'t think it is right that people have to 'pay' for this, and also it is when you do this that people can accuse you of taking advantage. But to go to a funeral? Abysmal...i know people who do it to take advantage. They prey on vulnerable people, and it is easy to do so (although not right in my opinion). Most clients are women, who want answers. They will usually be seeking information on one of 3 things...children/pregnancy, a man and the death of a loved one and this can be easy to pin point, ie no wedding ring...how a woman looks/dresses carries herself. Unfortunately they will continue to do it as long as people are requiring answers and they are making money.|`|DJLeObm4aa	Gosh you must live a very, very long way from me. Here if a 'medium' was hovering around a the door at a funeral univited they immediately would be removed, Afraid this type of thing just would not be allowed to happen here. Even although late I would speak with the vicar, or whoever runs the church or place the funeral was held as having someone univited such as you describe certainly is just not on.|`|wsQwfKn4aa	I don't think you were wrong. I believe that mediumship is possible, but a person who is sensitive enough to contact spirits wouldn't be the kind disrupting a funeral service uninvited!

(Matthew 22:36-40) Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law? 37?He said to him: You must love Jehovah your God with your whole heart and with your whole soul and with your whole mind. 38?This is the greatest and first commandment. 39?The second, like it, is this, You must love your neighbor as yourself. 40?On these two commandments the whole Law hangs, and the Prophets.    the WHOLE Old Testament law hangs on these two.|`|AA11124121	agree with above poster..

zZxX5PXBaa	Because it would be very unfair to eliminate the more intelligent primates (the apes) in favour of the more unintelligent (humans).    We humans are, after all, the ones who conduct wars, elect politicians, and occasionally wear underwear on our heads. Apes, by and large, avoid all that flag-waving nonsense and prefer to get on with eating, sleeping and having sex.

The sinner will always try to justify his sin.  They will argue about that, but God tell us that all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God.  Therefore we need something to bring us back to God therefore Jesus paid the price.|`|j1BTIYcCaa	If monkeys and apes evolved alongside us - what were they in the beginning? And what were we?

A scientist has faith his idea will work and then uses reason to find the empirical evidence to convince others that it's true. At that point, the cycle starts again but now the faith is placed in the reason rather than simply the idea.     Question: Do scientists think they are right about certain things and then later find out they were wrong? Yes, that means they had faith in a system that seemed to work but with more evidence it was shown to be flawed.|`|QMbaeva9aa	These are all tinted anti Christian.  I guess 1 fits with my definition.

Otherwise you can't survive.|`|E9chZY74aa	Sorry, I can not pick any.  Faith comes from seeing evidence.  I test a chair and then I can have faith in it.  The same with the Bible.

I do not know what wood the chair is or who made it or when or what fabric the seat is covered in, but because I have tried it, I know I can have faith in all of it.

One should have Faith and devotion and REALISE HIM BY THE SPIRITUAL WAY.That is only method.|`|UmdKqP5kaa	You seem troubled...  Ok, we know we don't create each other and we don't come to this world from nowhere because when we die we must be going somewhere as well, hence there must be God, if there were many Gods, they would have fought over what to be created and what not to be, probably over who to die and who to live at the same time... so it's gotta be one God... if that God created us then there must be a reason... could we figure it out on our own? God made it easy and sent us messengers and prophets to show us the way and tell us why... so all the messengers and all the religions are from the same only God, so they've got to be complementary to each other, not opposing each other!!! then God must have said His final words in the last message, what is the last message? and how do we know it's the last one? I guess that would be the religion that believes in all messengers and all books equally... is there such religion? actually yes, Islam does :)  A True Muslim (man or woman) gets his reward for obeying Allah's orders (Allah means The God in Arabic) by going to heaven, where he/she are indulged forever in all the good things that were on earth and more, things no one ever dreamt of or heard about. The Holy Quran tells Muslims (men and women) there will be good food, good wine and sex in heaven for all, but not in the bestial way you may think of, but rather in a way that is satisfactory for everyone and better than what was on earth. Heaven is no heartbreak or injustice land.  True Muslims are no terrorists, and Islam never calls for that, Islam means peace, it bans violence unless you were fought so you fight back, it only doesn't require Muslims to be cowards, and true Muslims understand this very well and never attack civilians.   Islam is the only religion that accepts freedom of religion and asks men to treat women gently like queens.   It's all in the Holy Quran and the right teachings of prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).  If some people behave otherwise, then it's because people behaviour doesn't necessarily reflect the rulings of their religion always, for example, we can't (and don't) judge Christianity by Hitler or Madonna.  And that is another reason why there is heaven and hell after we die, heaven for the obedient and hell for the disobedient and/or oppressor, it's all going to be decided on the day of resurrection and judgement.  To be a Muslim, you must believe God is only one with no spouses or offspring, believe in his angels (servants not males or females), believe in all his religions, messangers and books equally, the day of judgement, heaven and hell and that everything is in God's hands and because of his will (good or bad).  Muslims believe God is the only divine who never dies, the creator who deserves to be worshiped, all prophets who came to earth are human messangers sent by him.  Muslims don't deny christianity, judaism, Jesus or Moses. They believe in them as the noble prophets and messangers of God, love and respect them so much.  We believe the birth of Jesus (messanger of God) was a miracle from God to us, being born by a mother only and with no father. God is the creator, he can do anything.  We believe Jesus (peace be upon him) is NOT dead till today; he wasnt even murdered or crucified as most people think. God (most glorified) made the man who betrayed Jesus be killed instead by switching their looks for a moment. Jesus was left up to live in heaven until the end of days when he will come back to earth again, with no new teachings or messages but just to make justice prevail instead of oppression, fight the imposter who will claim to be God and (most important) to perform his last prayer with the Muslims announcing he's too a follower of the last prophet (Muhammad) as all people should... then he really dies like other Prophets and be buried (peace be upon them all). So we're waiting for you Jesus, Messenger of God, to bring the world peace and pray with us. Thats what prophet Muhammad told us and this is what I believe in, Im a Muslim  so how do we know it's true? what is said in the last message and what should we do? read the following, and you'll figure out for yourself:|`|YIatciCBaa	Let's wait til they actually go find it, why don't we?|`|af1fe9ebe396bd1dc330674aa3329c96aa	You're right!

Historians and geographical experts could tell us ROUGHLY where they passed (let's say within 50 mile radius).     "By Who? Please quote your sources!"    Now, it is well known that not only did the Israelites cross the red sea, but the Egyptian Army died whilst crossing it. Their charriots and their horseriders all drowned when the sea fell upon them.    "See above, sources required!"    So - what is the proof?    Well, if this story did happen, surely their relics (their charriots, their helmets, their armor etc) should still be embedded in the sea. All it needs is submarine archaelolgists to go there are start digging around.   Whatever they find will prove that this happened    What if they find nothing? Then by your logic it proves it never happened. And as the bible is the word of god, and as such is infallible, then if it is proved that this one instance is incorrect, then the whole book must also by association be incorrect. So by doing your experiment you run the risk of proving Christianity to be a myth and ipso facto proving god doesnt exist.     Fantastic, I love it, lets do it.|`|64d77l4qaa	Unfortunately, you are mistaken that is accepted the Israelites passed through the Red Sea.     There have been theories on where the Israelites could have traveled, but there is no evidence of a mass exodus from Egypt. It isn't recorded anywhere except the Old Testament, and there is no archaeological proof to support it.    One relatively recent theory that has been gaining a lot of momentum is that the Israelites are actually Canaanites, that they came out of essentially a civil war. There's a good deal of archaeological evidence to support this theory, as well as similarities between the Jewish and Canaanite beliefs.|`|iaPtohhhaa	Good try, but there is a problem in your argument. Your assumption of 50 mile radius.   Whether is found or not is always subject to debate. If people found a couple of wheels so what? People found and (still live) in Jerusalem (which is mentioned in the Bible). So what?    There is no such thing as ultimate proof that God exists.    In Psalm 91:1 says: 'The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handywork'.     But many don't see that way. You will only find and arrive conclusion on what you expect/wish/want to find.    God can only be accepted faith. If God is so great and almight that can even situates outside the bounds of the universe, how can science reach or probe for the presence of God?    What do man seek for the sign of God? If He is so great and is outside the bounds of space-time, you will have trouble to find, let alone what clue to look for.|`|ltwC6Bv1aa	It proves that Egyptians and Jews have been at odd with each other for long, long and err... long?

8b35140fd5eabcceff1f6c71562a2a02aa	I always found rolling the 'r's a nightmare, but I learned Spanish in just one year and passed the exam, so dont worry!!      Try pracisting whenever you can, speak to yourself in Spanish as often as you can and have conversations with your friends etc.   At least then you will know you have tried your best.    I notice from the GCSE that my son is taking that the oral part of the exam is 30% of the mark but at the end of the day if everything is correct and you are fluent and confident and know the language well you should be fine!    All the best to you in your study!|`|8W3JAEazaa	OK, well I don't do GCSE Spanish but I do GCSE French and German so I know how the language GCSEs work.  Pronunciation is quite important in the speaking assessment, but you're considered better if you can reply orally to questions you haven't prepared for .    Language GCSEs test you in reading, writing, listening and speaking. As you can see, speaking is only a small part of the whole GCSE and pronunciation is only a small part of the speaking.     A lot of people can't roll their r's (I can because I'm Scottish, which helps me in German especially because the rhotic accent is the same) but often in speaking you'll do fine if you speak with accurate grammar and fluency.     If you're capable of doing the other areas of the language GCSE, you'll do fine. You won't lose too many marks overall for your accent, as long as it isn't awful! If you listen to some Spanish radio or videos too, you'll gradually pick it up.|`|0r8KV5jiaa	Do your best! good luck!!!
AfbjU9Guaa	So that if they stood up they wouldn't bump their head on the headstone (ahhhh... headstone!)    Nahhh...honestly....6 feet deep was determined many, many years ago as a depth to which scavenger animals were unlikely to dig up a body. Caskets and vaults were not used way back then, so this was an important consideration.    Nowadays, the containers used prevent animals from smelling the deceased or digging to it, so graves are generally 4 feet deep or so, if it's a single burial. If it's to be a "stacker", with one person buried atop another, the first is usually buried 7 feet down. This depth may vary from one cemetery to another.|`|4qT0TfMZaa	It has been proven that a decomposing corpse buried in a shallower grave is more readily dug up and eaten by scavengers, and most people have an aversion to the thought of Mommy being rooted up and gobbled by animals.|`|Gsd4VD13aa	So that animals can't dig up the decomposing bodies and the smell of the body doesn't permeate the area.|`|c345a0234bc2cff30d382612a53c4eb9aa	So no coyotes will dig them up, or no flood waters will washe them away.

This number is not standard any more though, in some places bodies can't even be buried because of soil depths, conditions and water table depths, In many places bodies must be entombed above ground. In California, caskets must be covered by at least 18 inches of dirt and turf. The actual depth fluctuates deepening on the part of the world, an 6ft under just sounds good, no matter what depth the dead are at. but nowadays it sounds horrible but its so nothing can get to it e.g. animals digging you up, so you can decompose more quickly, so you can't smell the body|`|42dafba9ff7361d27a14115d9d33feedaa	In the old days they thought that six feet under was deep enough to prevent the smell of the rotting corpse getting out, prevent plague spreading and to stop the rot entering the water supply.

KS2OHXCRaa	There are 2 tense that you can use to convey what you want to say - le futur or le futur proche. [For the purpose of your sentence, to get something can be represented by "trouver" - to find (something)]      Le futur :  This is easy to construct. And this one actually do translate to mean "will" do something. All you do is take the verb in infinitive form, and add the following endings (example using "trouver"):    Je - ai --> Je trouverai  Tu - as --> Tu trouveras  Il/Elle - a --> Il/Elle trouvera  Nous - ons --> Nous trouverons  Vous - ez --> Vous trouverez  Ils/Elles - ont --> Ils/Elles trouveront    For your sentence, it'll be translate as "Nous trouverons quelque chose  manger". (We will find something to eat.)      Le futur proche:  One of the answerers above used le futur proche. Le futur proche is also easy to construct, and it's suitable for use when the upcoming event is to occur in the near future. More precisely, it translates as "going to (do something)".     What you do is to conjugate the verb aller (to go) and add the infinitive of the action that is about to occur.    E.g. "Nous allons trouver quelque chose  manger." --> We are going to find something to eat.     Je vais + trouver  Tu vas + trouver  Il/Elle va + trouver  Nous allons + trouver  Vous allez + trouver  Ils/Elles vont + trouver|`|1dfd90ec99e7ca43256c4d9f2f92f46caa	manger = to eat    nous = we|`|AfbjU9Guaa	Nous allons trouver quelque chose  manger.    Maintenant, allez faire un peu de travail et de rester loin de l'ordinateur|`|2z1h5mfOaa	Get is not a proper verb - do you mean "we will buy something to eat?" or "we will go out to eat?"  First example:  "Nous acheterons quelque chose a manger"  Second example:  "Nous sortirons pour manger" or "Nous trouverons quelque part a manger".    The verbs are:  acheter - sortir and trouver.  The future form of the verb (I don't know what the English name for it is) tends to use the verb as it is and add the ending for the person.  For "we" (nous) it's "-ons".  E.g. j'acheterai, tu acheteras. il achetera, nous acheterons, vous acheterez, ils acheteront.|`|jkZfjo4Zaa	we~nous    will~trouve    get~avoir    something~restaurer    to~    eat~mange|`|TclyXi8qaa	The answer from Matt is correct  Any French speakers; I'm about to post my own question i'm desperate for help on! xxx|`|3YUUEbIEaa	nous mangerons un morceau    nous mangerons un bout|`|K71ZlPWgaa	Nous manger... nous meaning we and manger being the infinitive use the infinitive to use it in the Future tense

People who make fun, call names or put that child/person down, are horrible people.... It is only by Gods grace, they have not been through what the mother has... People who act like that, again, by my way of thinking, have something to hide or cover up in their own lives... People claim *religion* is cruel ?

I believe God will take this child to places none of use will ever go, cause he defends the helpless. Was it right for the mother to have the child? It was her choice, and a good one to me.

Only the real property is not taxed because of the charity the different churches do thru out the world. Have you done anything charitable lately?

AA11047076	Simply because in Jduaism the Mashiach does NOT forgive sins, he does not bring atonement, he is not divine (so we will not pray to mashaich when he comes), he will not rise form the dead, he will not hang from a cross- and he will actually fulfill all the prophecies that jesus didn't manage to fulfill- like bringing world peace, gathering all the Jews in Israel, reinstating the Temple Service, the Jews becoming priests to the rest of the world, the resurrection fo the dead.

They looked forward with faith and hope to the coming of the messiah.    The operative word here is "just," and there's the rub.  Neither for the OT Hebrews nor the NT Christians is "faith alone" sufficient for eternal friendship with God.  For example, you have to obey some commandments in addition to having faith.  Jesus said, "If you love me, keep my commandments."    The Bible uses the phrase "faith alone" only one time, in James 2:24: "You see that a person is justified by what he does and NOT by faith alone."  You can't get any clearer than that.    Cheers,  Bruce|`|yNNdHDKvaa	As you know Jesus is God and God is Jesus.

Man just needed to hold to the promise of Christ coming like they held to God's promise to enter into the promised land God had prepared for their inheritance,but didn't or couldn't endure crossing a vast desert to get to it, for fear of peril,or finding it hard to  believe following  Christ and hearing his teachings, and following his example is all we had to do to please God, then that merely believing in Jesus and his teachings is all it would take to receive God's grace.|`|yk7jmSnDaa	blasphemy!|`|0O7nk7AKaa	the jewish texts foretold of a messiah, but by the time jesus came they were expecting something more along the lines of a political leader, not as much as a spiritual one as the texts clearly told of|`|NjPjpewlaa	People in the Old Testament didn't know Jesus' name yet.

There is no reference in the OT that shows us the God told the OT people about the death of the Messiah, only that He would come to His people.|`|i6d582PFaa	why would the people in the OT need to believe in Jesus when God intervened on a daily basis?|`|nHizaTiDaa	It always WAS about God saving his people.    It never really was then "saving themselves".    The first promise was in the Garden of Eden, to Eve- "I will put emnity between your seed and satan- satan will bruise his heel but HE(this meant the promised saviour) shall crush satan's head.    (the RCC brazenly puts Mary into this role- of crushing the serpents head. Talk about heresy!)      Please read the book of Hebrews if you are actually interested...."by faith Moses... by FAITH... Abraham.... and it was counted unto him as righteousness"    It was ALWAYS by faith in the promise.|`|Ur53Pf6zaa	Jews did believe in 'the future Jesus'.  They were, and still are awaiting the Messiah, Gods son.  Jews actually were the ones who paved the way for Yeshua (Jesus).  This was a huge, huge task and required discipline we tend not to have now.  However, they did not recognize Him when he came.  Many people devoted their lives to God and the preparation for the Messiah and still ... they didn't recognize Him.    Even those close to Christ (apostles) sometimes doubted because they were expecting a military or political leader.   So, we (Christians) owe a debt of gratitude to the Jews for being a witness to God and helping to pave the way for Yeshua.    Without them, we would have nothing.  The Jews are today our family, though we don't worship together (wish we did).  We are under the umbrella of the God of Israel and must treat each other with kindness.    Christs first arrival to this world played out a scene that is common today.  Many many Christians don't recognize the true God and His son Yeshua, because the real Him is hidden behind doctrine and traditions.  This leads us away from the truth (which is Yeshua),  therefore we don't know who They are.   Today, we believe in something of our own creation, making us worse than the Jews of the old Testament (my opinion).      Matthew 15:8  'These people honor me with their lips,         but their hearts are far from me.    They worship me in vain;         their teachings are but rules taught by men."|`|JKKpwmBFaa	The people of the old testament were under the laws passed down by the patriarchs.

So when Jesus appeared as the suffering servant in Isaiah he did not fit the expectations of the Jews.  God bless.|`|AA11743216	When He was prophecied and then born, most still  did not believe, when He preached , was crucified,  and rose again, they didnt believe,    thats the problem!!!!

FOzN3xwzaa	No. <br>  <br>  There are Christians in Pakistan.  Just because the majority so far reject it, doesn't mean anything. <br>  <br>  I was raised an atheist.|`|Gf5nMPJXaa	I don't know.  Apparently not enough of them realize this, as few and far between follow that realization to the logical conclusion.<br>  <br>  And to the poor befuddled fellow above, Pakistan's Christian minority (which is also mostly inherited from parents) is 1.1% of the population.  The US Islamic population is no more (and probably much less) than 2.5% and also is constituted mostly of Muslims born to Muslims.  An exception here would be the black Muslim movement, but they are an insignificant ratio of the whole population.<br>  <br>  Which means that at the furthest most improbably MINIMUM 97.5% of adherents in both places have stuck with what they were taught in the crib, an almost certain indeication of two things:<br>  <br>  1) There is nothing uniquely able to persuade in either faith.  It is not that Islam is easy to sell to Christians, nor is Christianity easy to sell to Muslims.  Which means of course that neither has more intrinsic merit to either faith or reason than the other for an unpersuaded audience.  Given two very different and equally unpersuasive, default-dominated faiths, we can either believe that one is completely right and the other utterly wrong (but somehow the right one is doggedly unable to sell itself as such), or we must believe both are equally wrong.<br>  <br>  2) Very very few believers in either faith and country take any trouble at all to study or review any other belief system seriously enough to consider converting (and most likely not much more trouble to understand their own), and yet both faiths not only expect but demand consistent and aggressive conversion efforts be directed at others.  Hypocrisy is not just a long word beginning with h apparently.|`|757ce30489e7f56556925d17f1f49f76aa	Not "they would be followers of each other's dogma" but "MIGHT". Remember people do convert our of choice.|`|NZ0mRaG3aa	Certainly our souls get very convinced of systems that are logicaly pleasing, or have emotional buy-in. That is not to say though that all such systems are equally true, or that all are untrue. Many of the claims conflict - e.g The Koran denies certain fundamentals of what Jesus did according to the New Testament. Hinduism has ideas of gods totally different from Christianity/Judaism and Islam. As I see it some people are very lucky that their cultures and families have opted or opened up to the true message from God to some degree, whereas others have fallen for plausible deceptions. So I am very lucky in that I had early cultural influence being shaped by the Lord, whereas a person in Karachi is very unlucky. The deception his soul labours under is hard for him to throw off as he thinks it's true. Actually there are ways of telling false religions are false, but that's another issue.|`|AA11225089	Not necessarily true. There are many secret believers in Muslim countries. I don't know if it works both ways, I haven't looked into it.|`|KmULmT7Baa	That's why I hate organized religion, it's not faith it's tradition.|`|5eSJpYbMaa	Yeah...that's generally how it works.|`|Wx1PqjgBaa	They try to avoid that obvious conclusion.|`|cW9vQ5nbaa	Yes|`|MF9YknDYaa	Yes but they just KNOW the other is wrong and they are right,they are so stupid.
lOgwTGYnaa	They want to appeal to their carnality in order to make them make a stand for Christ when in reality it excites them more in the world and does not lead them to God. <br>  <br>  I agree. "Thus saith the Lord" is the BEST approach. <br>  <br>  It does not matter if this is the age of video games and electronics, God will still come to youth regardless of those things! <br>  <br>  God is not speaking 100% throught this "Christian" music for the youth.

God 100% speaks through the new music, actually 100% more than the old music to me, so sure it may "entertain" a bit, but the true reason is to speak to the new generation and make God's message that much clearer.|`|mxAraZlsaa	I dont agree with this either I mean it might be better than going to keggers but I wouldnt call it true religion where you feel the spirit, its more of an adrenaline rush like you would experience at a tony robins expo.

For instance, mammals have a nerve in their neck that goes up and then down.

Giraffes have the same number of bones in their neck as you and I do (and I don't hardly have a neck at all!)  Fish have tails that go up and down but the tails of whales and porpoises go left and right because their muscles evolved from the leg muscles of mammals on land. There are a million little details like that.<br>  <br>  I could recommend a great book, The Ancestors Tale by Richard Dawkins.

I believe in the teachings of the Old Testament and the ways of the Jewish people, but now believe that it is not the only way, just one of many ways of reaching God. I now understand that the wonder of the Almighty - regardless of name is one shared by many. I also understand that even those who choose not to believe in God do follow a path that is uniquely theirs and right for them.  Lastly, I believe it is the fact that I feel secure in my religion, that I don't feel threatened to discover other religions/faiths.

SBL1t3ZSaa	Both are incorrect as this is another one of many mistranslations from Hebrew to English.<br>  <br>  Isaiah 9:6  (KJV). "For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace. Christians say this refers to Jesus and indicates that Jesus was the child that was born, at the same time, God. <br>  <br>  Mistranslation: The two letter word "is", is usually not stated in Hebrew.  Rather,"is" is understood.  For example, the words "hakelev" (the dog) and "gadol" (big), when joined into a sentence -- hakelev gadol -- means "the dog IS big," even though no Hebrew word in that sentence represents the word "is."  A more accurate translation of the name of that child, then, would be "A wonderful counselor is the mighty God, the everlasting father ..."  Like the name "Emanuel," this name describes God, not the person who carries the name. <br>  <br>  Context: Biblical names often describe God, and no one thinks to apply the description to the people with these names. The name Isaiah itself means "God is salvation," and not that the prophet himself is God in a human body.  Were we to use the same logic that Christians use on the names in Isaiah 7:14 and 9:6, we would say that the people named "Tuviya" (God is good) "Yedaya" (God knows), and "Ya-el" (HaShem is God) also are all God. <br>  <br>  The same applies to Jeremiah 23:5-6 (KJV) "Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will raise unto David a righteous Branch, and a King shall reign and prosper, and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth.  6 In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely: and this is his name whereby he shall be called, THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS."  The correct translation is "HaShem is our righteousness" and the name describes God, not the person with the name.|`|lJUyhMceaa	KJV Reads.....<br>  <br>  Isa 9:6  For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace. <br>  <br>  The KJV is the only version that translates "literally", word for word.<br>  Notice the word "the" left out in both versions you quoted.  "THE mighty God, THE everlasting Father, THE Prince of Peace" (capitalization mine).  He is not one everlasting Father, or one of the Prince of Peace, or even one of several mighty God's.  He is THE mighty God, THE prince of peace and THE everlasting Father.<br>  <br>  Notice also that He is not the Father of eternity, but He IS the everlasting Father.  There is a difference between the two statements.  The first (Father of eternity) does not say that God is eternal, but only that He is the Father of it.  The second (Everlasting Father) says that He is "everlasting", which would make Him God.|`|82ecf886687dfa603591f036171acb91aa	That also says Eternal Father. However, that verse should not be taken into isolation. Since the Bible has one author--God--that verse should be harmonize with other verses.<br>  <br>  Jesus is the eternal father of humans in the sense that he took the place of Adam who brought sin & death into the world.

As you pointed out, different translators have different opinions on how a passage should be rendered. However, the main idea of the passage overcomes the barriers of translation. And the Bible is written in such a way that you can look at more easily understood passages to help understand less clear passages.<br>  <br>  Whether it is everlasting Father, or Father of eternity which would seem to indicate the Creator, the passage is clear that the child will be God come in the flesh.|`|EM0kiImHaa	I've always read the Everlasting Father version.

Lexicographer Gesenius defines it as meaning “hidden time, i.e. obscure and long, of which the beginning or end is uncertain or indefinite.” (A Hebrew and English Lexicon of the Old Testament, translated by E. Robinson, 1836, p. 746) Accordingly, expressions such as “time indefinite” (Ps 25:6), “indefinitely lasting” (Hab 3:6), “of old” (Ge 6:4), “a long time ago,” “of long ago” (Jos 24:2; Pr 22:28; 23:10), and “long-lasting” (Ec 12:5) appropriately convey the thought of the original-language term.** <br>  <br>  The word ?oh·lam′ is at times associated with that which is everlasting. (1Ki 2:45, ftn) The prophet Isaiah wrote: “Jehovah, the Creator of the extremities of the earth, is a God to time indefinite.” (Isa 40:28) Jehovah is “from time indefinite to time indefinite.” (Ps 90:2) Since Jehovah is immortal and does not die, he will continue to be God for all eternity. (Hab 1:12; 1Ti 1:17) However, the Hebrew expression ?oh·lam′ does not in itself mean “forever.” It often refers to things that have an end, but the period of such things’ existence can be said to be ‘to time indefinite’ because the time of their end is not then specified. For example, the ‘indefinitely lasting’ Law covenant came to an end with Jesus’ death and the bringing in of a new covenant. (Ex 31:16, 17; Ro 10:4; Ga 5:18; Col 2:16, 17; Heb 9:15) And the ‘indefinitely lasting’ Aaronic priesthood similarly came to an end.—Ex 40:15; Heb 7:11-24; 10:1.** <br>  <br>  Another Hebrew term, ?adh, denotes unlimited future time, everlastingness, or eternity. (1Ch 28:9; Ps 19:9; Isa 9:6; 45:17; Hab 3:6) At times, as at Psalm 45:6, the words ?oh·lam′ and ?adh appear together and may be rendered “age-during, and for ever” (Yg), “age-abiding and beyond” (Ro), and “time indefinite, even forever” (NW). Concerning the earth, the psalmist declared: “It will not be made to totter to time indefinite, or forever.”—Ps 104:5.** <br>  <br>  The NWT of the Holy Scriptures is based on the oldest available manuscripts, & renders Isaiah 6:9 as:<br>  <br>  "For there has been a child born to us, there has been a son given to us; and the princely rule will come to be upon his shoulder. <br>  And his name will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, *Eternal Father*, Prince of Peace."<br>  <br>  The Son of God is to become the “Eternal Father” to this human family, for which he laid down his perfect human life in sacrifice. It is just as the apostle Paul writes: “For if by one man’s trespass many died, the undeserved kindness of God and his free gift with the undeserved kindness by the one man Jesus Christ abounded much more to many. So, then, as through one trespass the result to men of all sorts was condemnation, likewise also through one act of justification the result to men of all sorts is a declaring of them righteous for life.”—Romans 5:15, 18.***

Unfortunately, people are self-centered and jaded and don't care how they offend or hurt someone.

qS8pxDhKaa	Spain Spanish will give you a good basis for understanding Puerto Rican Spanish. However, you will still need to learn some of it from Puerto Ricans if you want to speak it perfectly.     Puerto Rican Spanish has some of its own idiosyncracies not found in the Spanish of Spain or even other parts of Latin America like china for "orange" instead of naranja and  guineo for "banana" instead of pltano.     Puerto Ricans often use guagua for "bus" like Cubans and Canary Islanders, but most Hispanics use "autobs."  They probably would not recognize "guagua" if they heard it. Guaguita de mantecao "Ice cream truck" is very Puerto Rican. I doubt if most other Hispanic peoples would immediately understand it.     Janguear "to hang out,"  jangueo "party / celebration" and "parking / palking / parqun) "Parking lot" are loan words from American English and  not used elsewhere in Latin America or Spain.     Hamburger Is "hamburguesa" in standard Spanish but Puerto Ricans have several other variations that they use among themselves instead like hamburito, jamburgel and jambelgel.    I took four years of standard Spanish in high school and college. Yet, when I tried to speak Spanish with some Mexican co-workers and restaurant friends of mine later on, I found that they spoke a different style of Spanish with some different words like saco for "coat" and chamarra for "jacket" instead of abrigo and chaqueta.     So, while I don't completely disagree with what the other posters said, I think it would still be a good idea to get together with some other Puerto Ricans and practice with them too as well has studying Spain Spanish (or Castilian Spanish). That way you will appreciate the Spanish of your family in Puerto Rico a little more.|`|AA11527276	There are enough similarities that your family will know for the most part what you are saying, but as you said, all Spanish dialects have differences. Have your family help you with your Spanish, they'll give you the "right word" when you say something in Castellan Spanish that differs from Puerto Rican.|`|9jux2TAjaa	WHAT??? All spanish are the same, I'm a colombian and I can understand perfectly what a Puerto Rican says, a Spanish, Peruvian, Argentinian... etc... is the same, so don't worry, the only difference is the accent and some slangs or words we use one way or another, but if you speak spanish and they want to listen and understand you... that's enough.    Ok, the big difference for me is that in Spain, they use VOSOTROS a lot, and in Latin-America and PR we don't, we use USTEDES.|`|Ti0q1Btiaa	If you learn Castillian, you'll have no problem being understood in any Spanish speaking country.    You may encounter some dialect that "you" don't understand.    I found this in Italian.  I couldn't understand my relatives in their home town.  Damn, I thought I had learned nothing, but one cousin translated for me who spoke several dialects.  Florence was no problem to understand and be understood.  Rome speaks Romanesque, really.  Naples, arrrgggghhh!    Believe me, TexMex is the worse.  Thought I had learned from employees, but their Spanish was horrible.|`|zzVnIoHbaa	Traditional 'Spanish' is known as Castillian is Spain, as several reigonal languages still exist. Imagine how in the UK we mainly speak English, but also Welsh and sometimes Cornish.|`|LNV6xT6Eaa	maybe..|`|80841aafba2cedde2f2f011d05e695d2aa	Well, Spanish from all countries may differ a little but not so much. The main differences are the vocabulary and the accent. As you are not a native speaker, your accent will be different anyway. SO dont worry, you can learn Spanish from any country and any Spanish speaker may be able to understand you (at most, they may think you speak a little weird, haha)

NZ0mRaG3aa	Avoid that Abyss, please !    Romans used quite a few different varieties of cross for execution. There was a simple variant with just one pole sometimes used, but I think it's somewhat unlikely that Jesus was crucified on a single pole since tradition thinks he was crucified on a cross. The Jehovah's Witnesses believe he died on a pole, probably to try and differentiate themselves from the mainline biblically-aligned churches and look superior! But it is a small matter anyway, the main thing being he died on a cross to provide reconciliation with God for us.    Catholics do have a lot of statues in their churches, and a lot of art. The protestant reformers saw many things wrong with the catholic church in the 16C, statues not being bad compared with other issues, but they did make an issue of it - they often knocked heads off statues and painted arty walls white, and protestant churches since are usually less elaborate and avoid statues. Often the statues represented saints and Mary, who often seemed to be worshipped more than God (in the 16C, that is; things have improved). Ultimately the reformers  were looking back to the 'You shall not make graven images' in the 10 commandments; the graven images were referring to objects of worship. I'm not too concerned about this issue myself, although I grew up in the protestant tradition.|`|RiZ6KMqmaa	the Romans crucified  Jesus on a cross so it became a symbol for Christians,the gospels tell of the men on the other crosses, it was the main method of execution by the Romans.  Statues are what the law of Moses calls graven images and they are forbidden|`|AA11124121	trinitarians? good luck on this question..poor souls..|`|AA11521494	They mention nothing at all on the subject.|`|tqQIcLb5aa	"And I say to thee: That thou art Peter; and upon this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. And I will give to thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven. And whatsoever thou shalt bind upon earth, it shall be bound also in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose upon earth, it shall be loosed also in heaven."     Peter has said it is o.k . By the way if we are taking the bible as true and literal in it's entirety, which I think it is, then as  your not catholic, presumably, you are directly calling Christ a liar in saying that the gates of hell prevailed against his church and so another was needed. If Christianity is true and the bible is true then somewhere in the world is the church that he referred to which has been their since he instigated it. The catholic church is the only church that has been around since the time of Christ. The Church he talks of is clearly the catholic church.|`|6pEevKn6aa	The Bible says not to make any graven images.....on the crosses you see today they all have Jesus still on the cross.....i believe this is Biblically uncorrect, since they removed Jesus from the cross and then He rose from the tomb. So as far as to carry a cross....i think that would go under the graven image category

If she's from Arkansas, that really doesn't surprise because a lot of people in that part of the country are so religious that it stops them from being able to reason or think with logic. They never travel, they don't seem to want to learn more about other cultures and other people, they live in small towns and anything that is different than what they are used to, is unacceptable. Of course not all of them like that, but after spending time in the deep south, my observations are that many are like that. I actually feel sorry for many of them - their opportunities are limited and the education system in those parts of the country are some of the worst in the country, so it's no wonder that some of them become the way they do. Some parts of the deep south are so religious, that the extremism is comparable to parts of the Middle East.<br>  <br>  There's ignorant people, and then there's really ignorant people who are so ignorant that no matter what you do, they will never think twice about what they say, they refuse to reason.

The best part about it is that God said things like, "do you think I don't care, about you and your problems? Do you think that I want you to go to hell?". God care's about you, and that's about all there is to it. I can't tell you, "everything will work out in the end!". Cause I don't know that! Except, if "the end" is the end of your life and you're saved. Don't think that because bad things are happening in your life, that God doesn't love you! He loves you more than you can imagine. I can't really answer your question very well, but just don't think that God isn't watching over you with compassion. It's not always that you "Did something bad" and you're being punished! God uses these type of things to make us stronger! =) well that my two cents worth! Hoped it helped!

NIV<br>  <br>  Paul identified who was the god of this world and warned his followers that it was Satan who blinded the world to the glorious gospel of Christ.<br>  <br>  2 Corinthians 4:3 But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost: 4 In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them. 5 For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves your servants for Jesus' sake. KJV<br>  <br>  Satan is deceiving the entire world and is fooling the world to worship a false Christ. The book of Revelation identifies Satan as the great deceiver of the entire world.<br>  <br>  Revelation 12:9 And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the Earth, and his angels were cast out with him. KJV<br>  <br>  Paul preached to the Ephesians that mankind's true battle is against Satan and his demons.<br>  <br>  Ephesians 6:11 Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. 12 For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. 13 Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand. KJV<br>  <br>  Peter stated that a Christian's enemy is the devil.<br>  <br>  1 Peter 5:8 Be self-controlled and alert. Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour. 9 Resist him, standing firm in the faith, because you know that your brothers throughout the world are undergoing the same kind of sufferings. NIV<br>  <br>  Satan is the god of this world until Christ returns. The reason Satan is the current ruler of this world goes back to the Garden of Eden. When Adam and Eve disobeyed God and ate of the Tree of Good and Evil, they allowed Satan to rule them instead of God. If Adam and Eve had resisted Satan and obeyed God, then Adam and Eve would have been under the Government of God. By yielding to the lies of the serpent, they started the process of the whole world being under Satan's sway.<br>  <br>  1 John 5:19 … the whole world is under the control of the evil one. NIV<br>  <br>  Christ had to come to the Earth and live out his life as a flesh and blood human being so mankind can someday be free from the control of the evil one. Christ is called the second Adam. The first Adam failed in resisting Satan. One of Christ's objectives while on this Earth was to successfully resist the temptation of Satan. By successfully resisting Satan and obeying God, Christ qualified to become the ruler of the world at his Second Coming.<br>  <br>  Matthew 4:1 Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil. 2 And when He had fasted forty days and forty nights, afterward He was hungry. 3 Now when the tempter came to Him, he said, "If You are the Son of God, command that these stones become bread." 4 But He answered and said, "It is written, "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God."' 5 Then the devil took Him up into the holy city, set Him on the pinnacle of the temple, 6 and said to Him, "If You are the Son of God, throw Yourself down. For it is written: "He shall give His angels charge over you,' and, "In their hands they shall bear you up, Lest you dash your foot against a stone."' 7 Jesus said to him, "It is written again, "You shall not tempt the LORD your God."' 8 Again, the devil took Him up on an exceedingly high mountain, and showed Him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory. 9 And he said to Him, "All these things I will give You if You will fall down and worship me." 10 Then Jesus said to him, "Away with you, Satan! For it is written, "You shall worship the LORD your God, and Him only you shall serve."' 11 Then the devil left Him, and behold, angels came and ministered to Him. NKJV<br>  <br>  Christ did not disagree with Satan concerning his ability to give Christ all of the Kingdoms of the World. He knew Satan was the ruler of this world and could turn them over to him if he so wished. Christ also knew that by obeying God instead of Satan, he would qualify to dethrone Satan at his return in power and glory. Overcoming Satan's temptations were necessary so mankind could achieve its true destiny.|`|YaB5bpv7aa	God is ruler over everything|`|usfVqbajaa	tears for fears|`|CC6dSdJmaa	The Weather!|`|118h96Q8aa	Revelation 21:6<br>  <br>  Check it out.|`|3ba0ab7304ca31210254987d14dbe035aa	A bit long of an answer, but Brian N got it; satan is the present ruler of this world.|`|I1w0HfQbaa	Sid Vicious is the supreme ruler of the WORLD!

It doesn't add up to me.    I believe in everyone having a soul, in a spiritual way.  When the body dies, the soul lives on, but doesn't need a "physical place", as we see it, to "be", but it would be very aware of all aspects of its nature in its after-life, and that means good and not so good deeds and behaviour.  It may want to make amends for the not so good aspects.|`|yHfsHp6naa	It probably is like that.

EyCgjjV4aa	I think there are a few reasons for this, one, like the other person said we as a species are dramatic and we seem to like the fantasy of the bad boy or girl. Also we have a morbid curiosity, when i turn on tmz and watch the crap thoose stars, and reporters do, its like watching someone lick there finger and stick it in a eletic socket. theres the glory hore thing too, the bad seem to have a warped form of respect induced by fear. Power and that power is sexually attrative to women im thinking as a result of the survival instinct. Since im not a man id assume that the bad girl thing tends to be as if your walking a pitt bull threw the getto, really pretty and everyone looks, but your pretty toy will also rip your arm off and eat it. I think that a lot of people will say its how you were raised, and to a extent i agree, however in a diffrent way than some. When you are raised as a law abiding good person, or even just a moral person, u see a "bad" boy, and think, wow thats difrent than im used to, and feel a pull to them. Curiosity killed the cat, because it smelled good and got u addicted. Like crack.|`|naJGDkFjaa	Because it's human nature to want to rebel. We all wish we could get away with doing "bad" things. Why else we would our society romanticize Bonnie and Clyde, Western movies--cowboys or the Italian Mafia. Why do we romanticize pirates and "gangstas" -- It's all pure fantasy. Everyone to some extent wishes they could live a "free" life. Don't you wish that you could stop working, stop going to school and  abandon everything that hinders you to live a "free" life. Well bad girls and bad boys extenuate that sort of "free" philosophy.     It's not in our nature to follow rules... this is bluntly obvious in little children and any other animal specie for the matter. We have to train ourselves to follow rules, we have to train ourselves to obey laws and live in a cocoon of relative civility. But lawlessness and "badness" has always and will always be attractive.|`|ZZ5Rm406aa	The society is male chauvinistic.|`|lQIKWXDuaa	For the same reason they like to see people suffer.

Lots of people like to act tough but are actually weeners when it comes to the crunch.    It's mainly the media and TV that do the glorifying, because they know it will get attention, whether good or bad.    Some people are attracted to people they regard as "dangerous" more than someone who is "safe and harmless", but anyone who respects someone who does not respect others is a fool.|`|qeu6vWCHaa	Life--for the vast majority of people-- is boring, mediocre, and predictable.

And girls... bratz comes to mind.... I just shudder when I think of one of those crazy dolls in my home.. teaching my daughter to be a spoiled paris hilton type.    society is screwed up... they worship celebrities (you cant hide the truth here... those people are only gazillionaires because of us, if we stopped worshipping them, they would be just like us and have to actually work hard)  We pay millions for entertainment yet we are frugle with what really matters ... nutrition, health and charity.    We let the media control us... they manipulate us into buying stupid products based on what they show us.... if you wear this lipstick or fragarance, your gorgeous you can get anyone and anything.. or if you drink this beer, you can have this gorgeous girl in the picture..etc.    People have to wake up and realize their life will be much better without all this worshipping of things that dont matter.. focus on your health.. both mental and physical.. invest your time and money into your family doing positive things with one another.. forget the hyped up overated glamour.... its just a bunch of spoiled idiots who dont deserve what they have.|`|TxvWkK1Zaa	Because of the media.

bda465ikaa	It's not a silly question, but the answer is not very clear. When William the Conqueror conquered the kingdom of England he owned the entire country by "right of conquest". However, he quickly gave away large portions of it to his trusted men. By the year 1760 the king was still the largest landholder in Britain, but he signed away all of his land to parliament. The lands and property became the "crown estate". Today, the crown estate is managed much like a large corporation. It generates a profit of about 200 million pounds which goes into the treasury. Various government organizations give to the monarchy roughly 40 million pounds a year. So some people think that the government is making a huge profit, while others think that they are paying taxes for the monarchs.<br>  ============<br>  Technically each new monarch signs an agreement with parliament agreeing to give the proceeds of the "crown estates" to parliament. If the United Kingdom votes to become a republic, then theoretically the last monarch could break the agreement. <br>  -----------------<br>  Buckingham Palace, Windsor Castle, Holyrood Palace, all belong to the "crown estate". Sandringham and Balmoral are considered private property of the monarch. Since Sandringham and Balmoral are very large and expensive palaces they are need to generate money. They are open to tourism and particularly Balmoral is a "working" estate.<br>  -----------------<br>  The "Prince of Wales" is entitled to the profit from the dukedome of Cornwall. He pays taxes on the money that he receives. The mansion that he lives in in London (Clarence House) is considered public property. The renovations cost millions of dollars. The Prince paid some of the expenses related to his personal taste, and the government paid other expenses.<br>  ------------------<br>  Kensington Palace is considered property of the "crown estate". Many of the lesser royals live in Kensington palace. It is also where Diana had an apartment where she raised her two sons after splitting with Charles. Parliament decided that the elaborate "grace and favor" apartment that Prince Michael lived in since 1978 should no longer be free. He will start paying rent next year for about 10,000 pounds per month. Prince Andrew lives in a mansion near Windsor Castle owned by the "crown estate". Right now he pays a minimal rent.<br>  ===========<br>  It is generally believed that the privelages extended to the royal family (especially the ones that are not closely related to the monarch) will continue to shrink. Prince Andrew is the royal of his generation that gets the most public criticism. Partly because he is a bit of a playboy. The princess royal has a more modest apartment in St, James Palace. Prince Edward has a very nice mansion as well. Princess Alexandra has a beautiful home, but she is very dignified, and is subject to much less public criticism. She managed to sign a 150 year lease on a property that a Russian billionaire would spend a fortune to own.<br>  ------------------------<br>  It is not clear what will happen with the next generation. Princess Eugenie and Beatrice are just getting to the age that they will want their own homes.|`|NYU37jfGaa	Yes, some of our taxes goes towards supporting the Queen, but it is a very small amount, about 66p each per year I believe.  Which is considerably less than most countries with elected presidents pay for their heads of state.

And I shudder to think how much the President of the USA costs to maintain.|`|Iqp3ZUAlaa	The Queen makes her money from the income the Duchy of Lancaster generates.

dkoGI9nfaa	Is it a misunderstanding or did you inadvertently over step the line?  Difficult for me to tell from the Information as you did not mention the exact event.  It appears however, after months, that there is little left to convince him of whatever the misunderstanding was just that.  You can make a final attempt, and I think it is worth it, to talk about it.  If he does not want to reconcile then you need to realise that it is time to move on.  If you don't chances are that you might become bitter and twisted and that is not good.<br>  <br>  I do agree though that the fact that you are bi need not be mentioned as you say you have never made any advances and never will.  Do you know for a fact that he is straight?  He might not be and for that reason does not want to reconcile.   Difficult to tell without enough information.  Good luck!|`|fcsTUFDLaa	i know how it is to have feelings for a friend :)<br>  <br>  well i just told him i was gay (first person that knows it)<br>  and he was all cool with it and our friendship did even get bigger.<br>  <br>  so if he is your friend you should just tell him :)<br>  <br>  or make him kinda ask to you what you are :P<br>  <br>  good luck !|`|aW5uShwtaa	I think you do like him.

It sounds like he's insecure if he made that big a deal of it.<br>  I don't really know if you're attracted to your friend or not. The fact that you are hurting because you lost him is a perfectly normal response that I think anyone would probably have if someone very close to them just suddenly started to ignore them.<br>  I think it would be a good idea to (very) slowly ease your way back into the friendship. Be friendly to him, but don't seem too interested. It'd also probably be good to keep the physical contact to a minimum at this point. If you keep that up, he should start to come back to you and then you can rekindle your friendship. <br>  I wish you the best luck! :)|`|bd89db95a8636a616e42896cf49b6a87aa	Maybe you did make some kind of advance and you just didn't realize it.

Lots of Americans are Christians, so when they're asked if they believe in Creation they say yes, because they think that's what's expected of them.  Most people never really think about it.  It makes no difference to them.  They are really only identifying with their group.  Just as if you ask Americans if George Washington is a hero they'll say yes, even if they're not quite sure what he did.<br>  <br>  In the Gospels in the New Testament, Jesus healed people only by casting out demons.  Ask people today who have an infection if they'd rather have demons cast out or they'd rather take antibiotics, and you'll see who the -real- Christians are.  8^)|`|AA11297267	Roughly, yes.<br>  Last poll I saw (Oct. 2008, just before the election) said:<br>  <br>  -- 34% believe god created the world literally in 6 days 6,000 years ago<br>  -- 33% accept the fact of evolution by natural selection<br>  -- 33% "don't know" if evolution is a fact or not<br>  <br>  Pretty sad, huh?

And He who sat on him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness He judges and makes war.  12  His eyes were like a flame of fire, and on His head were many crowns. He had a name written that no one knew except Himself.  13  He was clothed with a robe dipped in blood, and His name is called The Word of God.  <br>  <br>  14  And the armies in heaven, clothed in fine linen, white and clean, followed Him on white horses.  15  Now out of His mouth goes a sharp sword, that with it He should strike the nations. And He Himself will rule them with a rod of iron. He Himself treads the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God.  16  And He has on  His robe and on His thigh a name written: KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS.  <br>  <br>  17  Then I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the birds that fly in the midst of heaven, "Come and gather together for the supper of the great God,  18  that you may eat the flesh of kings, the flesh of captains, the flesh of mighty men, the flesh of horses and of those who sit on them, and the flesh of all people, free and slave, both small and great."  <br>  <br>  19  And I saw the beast, the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against Him who sat on the horse and against His army.  20  Then the beast was captured, and with him the false prophet who worked signs in his presence, by which he deceived those who received the mark of the beast and those who worshiped his image. These two were cast alive into the lake of fire burning with brimstone.  21  And the rest were killed with the sword which proceeded from the mouth of Him who sat on the horse. And all the birds were filled with their flesh.|`|1TYZDRUqaa	IJR is particularly fond of the Publisher's Information and COPYRIGHT page.

I mean jeez, your Pastor's just wrong...  Imagine, two thirds of the world don't believe in Jesus, are they ALL going to go to Hell for believing what they were taught by parents as children and firmly indoctrinated with that for the rest of their life?  Then think of those who are not even aware of Christianity, will they go to Hell as well because they never knew about Jesus at all? Is it their fault that they are isolated and ignorant about Jesus's existence? Do animals go to Hell as well?     1. Not all public schools teach evolution. And there is a lot of scientific evidence for evolution, unless you believe the numerous skeletons of Homo Erectus and Homo Habilis were just buried in the ground by God to tests your faith?     Coral Yoshi - So you really think that God would plant a bunch of bones in the earth to test your faith? Either you're in denial or God has some serious self-esteem issues.    Besides, we did not just magically 'evolve' from monkeys, we came from a primordial ooze which happened to have the right combination of proteins for life to start, and through natural selection, we evolved according to the environment through a natural process spanning millions of years, a long and natural process.     How would you know that it is the truth. Claiming it is the truth requires hard evidence, which you lack. Claiming that we were created by a Christian God implies that there are other gods as well.    2. The Bible is full of contradictions and errors and though contains a few good morals, is unsuitable for children to learn in public schools. Killing hundreds of Canonites just because it was their fate to make way for Abraham's followers doesn't sound very educational to me...Neither does letting husbands 'rule' over their wives and their bodies. There is a reason why there is a 'Separation of Church and State' in America.    3. What if your students are of different religions? That shows discrimination against the non-Christians and favouristism towards Christians, which is blatantly unfair. What happened to 'equal opportunities'? Before and after school prayers are outside the jurisdiction of the school, genius.

Just a few thoughts of mine, that's what I think.|`|k5P8XK62aa	Here are some universal truths for you:    1) All religions believe that unless you believe in them and in the particular sect of the priest in question then you are going to hell.    2) All religions thus believe that all other religions are wrong and that their practitioners are going to hell    3) Either, as it is impossible to belong to all religions at the same time, and thus be assured of not going to hell, then hell is pretty much inevitable so everyone is going to hell, or hell doesn't exist, so no-one is.        Going through your ideas in order...    1) Perhaps if you were to actually read the books on evolution rather than just complaining about them you might realize that humans didn't evolve from monkeys. Humans and monkeys share a common ancestor going back millions of years.  2) OK, as part of a comparative religion class NOT in a science class.  3) This does not encourage religious belief, trust me, I went to a church school and spent the compulsory prayer time staring out of the window, trying to control my pulse through the power of my mind, daydreaming etc. Also, wouldn't it be a shame if the compulsory prayers weren't for your specific sect of christianity, but were (for example) Catholic. What would you and your pastor make of that?|`|EAuMJrs4aa	*poe* sorry something stuck in my throat.    athiests dont believe in the soul you speak of and i cant see us have the bottoms of our feet removed can you?    evovled?    ?~Sam~? thats douglas adams right?|`|vjAGUCSlaa	I'm not at all concerned that I'm going to hell.

NgRiFZ7Baa	YES, there can be. Half-werewolves are actually even more common than full werewolves, but for a reason I'll get to later.<br>  <br>  If either or both parents are werewolves, the child will be a full werewolf - however, if the pregnant mother becomes a werewolf and gives birth BEFORE THE NEXT FULL MOON, then the child will be a half-werewolf, with half the transformation of a full werewolf.<br>  <br>  All werewolves, including half-werewolves, always pass on their trait to the next generation, but many are reluctant to have children - for that reason. But half-werewolves are difficult to track, and I'll tell you why:<br>  <br>  Werewolves, including half-werewolves, transform EVERY NIGHT - except for the new moon. As the moon gets fuller, the transformation becomes more wolfish. But there is a bright side - there is a medicine (which we lovingly coined "werewolf pills") that can help prevent the transformation on every night except the full moon. That's why werewolves only come out on the full moon. However, this means that they can be slightly tracked. Half-werewolves, however, can take the medicine every night, because they never become fully transformed. This makes them infinitely more difficult to track, and therefore baffles the people trying to get them. So the half-werewolves survive and, I don't want to say it, but "breed".<br>  <br>  The people who give scientific explanations make me sad. If it made sense, it wouldn't be magical, would it? There are half-werewolves out there, and if you'd like, I'll list the ways to find them and inform you on how to recognize them. (This goes for werewolves AND half-werewolves.)<br>  <br>  1. Approximately twelve hours after taking the werewolf pills, the stuff wears off and for a moment, the werewolf tries to break free before being subdued by the sun. This causes a short burst of anger in whoever has taken a pill twelve hours before. If a person is experiencing anger in short, random bursts at scheduled times that increases in ferocity as the full moon approaches, you've got yourself a werewolf. (Note: this is only if they actually take pills. Some just seal themselves in a room during their transformations, mostly if they can't afford the cost of pills that are being dealt under the table.)<br>  2. After the half-moon, werewolves start to become more wolflike, which has its effects on the person in the day as well. If someone seems to have more energy than normal at around noon to six in the afternoon on a regular basis after a half-moon is growing, then it's likely that they are a werewolf if they have the other signs, too.<br>  3. If a person seems to be looking more tired as the full moon approaches, that's another sign. Werewolves sleep less and less as the full moon approaches. They don't need that lost sleep, but it looks like they do.<br>  <br>  These three signs are the biggest tell-tale signs of them all. There are a few more, such as they are NEVER vegetarians, but those aren't as important. If you manage to find one and they confess it to you, then you must keep it a secret unless they specifically tell you it's okay to tell others. It's only common courtesy. Sorry if you didn't want this much in a response, but it's fun to get it out. ;)<br>  <br>  YES, they are very real. Yes, one of your friends could be. No, you are not in danger at all. That's a promise made by the hunters, but also most of the pack.|`|ZKLlTxd0aa	No, you can't be a half-werewolf. That would make sense. You are either werewolf or human, you can't be in between.

It is not part human part wolf but it is rare to get unless you live where a kind of wolf is than it might spread easy. Scientists have discovered the sperm coming out of wolves for no reason. They are not even masterbating. It is just falling out when it gets too dry than if your skin touches the hard sperm than you get hairy everywhere and you go nuts. It will make your ears bleed and you will have tears of blood. You will puke if you do not eat human skin every 5 minutes. The human skin is supposed to tame the illness down but there is no cure. If you shave the hair off it will just regrow because it only takes a week to grow 10 inches. It does only have one cure which gives you 92-93% chance risk of putting you at a heart attack or giving you a type of cancer. It would suck.|`|RoFTfke3aa	There are two types of werewolves. There is a m-shift werewolf and a p-shift werewolf. A M-shift werewolf does not physically turn into a wolf, only they think they are a werewolf deeply so at some points they go savage. Now, a P-shift werewolf includes alpha werewolves and beta werewolves. Alpha werewolves are the ones that can control themselves and change when ever they want. Then, beta werewolves are the ones that are uncontrollable. They have to change every full moon and they attack anything that breaths basically. The only way to become an alpha werewolf is to be born and beta werewolves come from being bitten by an alpha werewolf. If you are an alpha werewolf then you would start to notice it around 14 or 15 years of age, as this is when you are mature enough to change. The first few times you change will only be on a full moon and you will not notice it, but about 4 or 5 months later you will. Every night you will get Extreme pains as your body starts to change, and it's not like the movies how it happens fast. No, the change happens very slow at first, but over time it goes faster. Now, beta werewolves come from being bit by an alpha werewolf, saying you live. If you were a beta werewolf it would probably take you a while to notice. As you don't feel the change because you black out, and you always wake up normaly as there are no side effects. Like you don't get cravings for anything you don't feel hyper, nothing. As an alpha werewolf your wolf characteristics effect your human daily life.|`|eb4e977a0cb9ce50b08bf74f0f3a0c61aa	Werewolves do not exist. The body cannot withstand that kind of change - you would die from cardiac arrest induced by massive system trauma long before you could resemble a wolf. It would require massive loss and growth of bone structure, reshaping of the skeleton, a complete rearranging of all major organs located in the torso as well as the nervous and circulatory systems. The skin itself would have to thicken and all your hair follicles would have to repattern themselves to grow fur. Lastly, the brain would change, and when you lose brain tissue you lose the memories and functions associated with it, such as in a stroke. If a person could change into a wolf, and then back, they would return to human form with the mental capacity of a wolf, and be a drooling idiot at best and a homicidal maniac at worst.<br>  <br>  I love that old poem - haven't thought about that in years:<br>  "Even a man who is pure of heart, and says his prayers by night,<br>  may become a wolf when the wolfsbane blooms, and the moon is shining bright."|`|wX3P9Tlcaa	doesn't work like that . a person is human with animal instincts ,until  the full moon then he changes to the wolf ,then he must hunt and feed.either you are or not no half way about it. perhaps you black out and have no memories of your full moon hunts.|`|jLL7sDILaa	I don't think so.

yzgS5KiQaa	I'm bisexual, and I don't agree. I think there are some people that are totally straight, some that are totally gay, bisexual in the middle, an ranges of bicurious in between. Like there are plenty of gay guys who will kiss a girl an even enjoy it, but not do anything else, and straight women who can kiss women. Or women who like women from the waist up, or men like like men from the waist up.

Having a curious thought about the same/opposite gender does not make you bisexual. It's just normal. You have to have lasting thoughts and attractions to both genders to be bisexual. 1 brief thought or experimental experience does not a bisexual make.<br>  <br>  Though the line you said "I know people who are 100% straight and were never confused about their sexuality!" <br>  <br>   makes it seem like you think all bisexuals are confused, but we are not.<br>  -----<br>  I probably just misinterpreted it =D<br>  -------<br>  It's ok! I knew what you meant =D|`|DIj072Sqaa	The majority of people are straight however there are a significant amount of people who have some feelings for members of the same sex who also identify as straight so in this way there is a certain amount of choice. The stronger the feelings are the more likely it is that the person will be unhappy in a straight relationships. <br>  <br>  Two leading scientists Dr Alfred Kinsey, the first to propose that human sexuality is on a scale and Fritz Klein who expanded this notion concluded that many people are bisexual to some degree. However research has shown that about one in ten have some sort of same sex experience and about the same number think about it but don't have act on their feelings. <br>  <br>  When talking to people who are questioning their sexuality the very nature of these scales means that they would fall into a category of at least someone who is straight and has same sex fantasies - which means that they are bisexual to some extent. The sad side of this is that those who have stronger same sex feelings and deny them can often be the most homophobic people as they're hating that aspect of themselves.

While I realise that your pouring " a little " of your drink over him was intended as a joke, it was a risky one - not everyone would see the funny side.    But in answer to your unwitten rule question, in general i think women shouldn't abuse their positions as women.  You shouldn't assume, in general, that its ok to pour your drink over a man, but not expect the same in return.

These women want to have more rights and so on, which I totally agree with, however they want more than the males.    In other words, they want the male/female balance to be fair, yet are not fair themselves.     In my mind, what can be done to you, whether by a female or male, can be then done back to them.    To your question as well, I gather he accidentally spilt the drink. If so, then you sadly are the one to blame. The male should have simply apologised, and you should have left it at that.|`|812xWV0naa	Because its unwritten, for the sake for fairness, as long as its safe & fun  You are being unreasonable to him.|`|a9bc452f60356f9459d6653f3f409cfeaa	he is a douche.   why are men so stupid?    i agree with you , your right

9ko5WUFkaa	My parents did make me go to church as a kid - and I never believed it.  Most adult atheists know what they don't believe in - I've read the bible, I've done bible studies and I've done much personal reading.  All that has only given me more reason to question the bible and the contradictions and inaccuracy it contains.    On the other hand, why don't more atheist-bashing christians actaully understand what they are bashing instead of blindly following their faith and just thinking that we are wrong because the bible/a minister/their parents tell them we are?|`|e5VUwaRsaa	My parents preferred to take us to do fun things on Sundays when I was growing up.

I have found that most atheists are very dogmatic in their own beliefs, perhaps moreso than christians, jews, muslims, etc, but they don't need a place to worship nothing, they can do that anywhere at anytime.     Besides, who (with a sound mind) wants to go to a place every week to be constantly reminded that when they die, that's it.  Nothing else happens.  What a huge downer.

Affirmative action is only a drop in the bucket.   Inequality is still rampant in this country.  Anybody who has been followed around in a store because of the color of their skin or who has had their basic human rights put on a ballot because of their sexuality can tell you that.

6uGxPczpaa	I don't know them all but "a bed of roses" usually means to have it easy in life.  Most commonly, people say that someone's life is NOT "a bed of roses" if their life is hard.    "A fish out of water"  means someone out of his or her natural element.  For example...The supermodel was a fish out of water at the Mensa think-tank.    "A man of letters" means he is well educated and usually has several degrees or professional qualifications after his last name.  For example:  Dr. Bob Loblaw, Ph.D., B.Sc., CFP    "A jack of all trades" means someone with a variety of skills in many different fields.  For example, a professional golfer who is also a part-time plumber and electrician and whose hobbies include playing flute in an orchestra and being a world-class chef.  There is a saying that goes "the jack of all trades is the master of none", meaning that anyone who spreads themselves out over so many fields will never be the best at anything.    Hope this helps!|`|qky7gWosaa	A Bed of Roses - A state of great comfort or luxury.    A Bed of Thorns - A life full of discomfort and pain.

F0uLexezaa	what a tirade for such a small error.|`|nDQOwAA3aa	did his director know the "get the **** the term off of my set"|`|Oh3yVRQzaa	You obviously don't know the whole story.     Yes of course it was unprofessional - everyone has their moments. What I would rather know, is how he handled the situation after he cooled down. Obviously he didn't shut the movie down or we would have heard about it - they obviously kissed and made up.     This guy was a director of photography - not a sandwich server on set - he should know his job - and walking on set while filming on two occasions and interferring is very unprofessional of him as well.     If I had spent 14 hours on set - in who knows what kind of heavy gear (judging my christian bale's terminator clothing) and in what conditions - and was a method actor and someone took me out of a very important scene I would be angry too if someone screwed it up. Every second wasted is money flying out the window for this production team. Maybe CB just had the guts to say what the weak director and producer should have said.     - for the record, Christian Bale did not beat up his mom and sister - he was ccused of verbally assaulting them (for which he was cleared) - his mom and sister were also accused of verbally assaulting Christian Bale's wife as well as asking for $100,000. You might want to get your story straight before you start spreading lies about people.

EzrdyxAiaa	the amount of weight that one puts on -- alcohol will put on the weight!!!|`|eS9nPWqBaa	High - relaxed, sexually aroused possibly (depends on the weed), not scared that you're going to fall or be sick in the morning.    Drunk: Fear of being sick and embarrassing yourself, could be sexually arousing - not for me though.  Other than that weed is better.    Wait how old are you? lol|`|8KxurcApaa	Different for everyone.    For me weed makes me extremely relaxed & calm.  I have trouble breathing, my sex drive is completely non-existent, & I retain my fears & inhibitions.  The negatives greatly out weigh the positives for me so I don't recommend smoking.  The odor is generally not a problem for CASUAL smokers but the drug stays in your system longer which could be a problem for drug screening.  Few people who have tried weed complain about it and most negatives events that stem from weed are not popularized which is why it seems so cool and safe.    Alcohol energizes & excites me, my inhibitions are looser allowing me to act on impulses.  You do lose co-ordination (which can help or hurt your dancing and/or driving) & if you drink more than you can handle you will get sick.  I do recommend drinking SOCIALLY if you have a rigid personality, it will help you learn to have fun.  Most people who have tried it don't dislike alcohol, they dislike haughty individuals who don't care to keep their arrogance in check while intoxicated.     I will say weed appears more addictive than alcohol.  The Pot Heads defend it vehemently but both are a form a drug & can get you in trouble if you do not know your limits.  That said, if you try them it should be for YOUR own reasons ... not because of outside pressure.  YOU will be the one to live with whatever positives or negatives that come about because of them.|`|QWEq5ms0aa	okay dude, i just started smoking weed.  it is fu**ing amazingggg!!!!!  i would smoke over drink anyday  just dont get into cigs, they r gross.  but anyway,  a drunk feels like dizy and u cant rlly control your actions and u dont remember shi* the nxt day.  weed u feel like your flying and u dont have a care in the world, and u can, for the most part, control your actions and have a great time. u just chill and smoke and eat and talk. its wonderful! i shuda started earlier

P544Sbmqaa	I am slightly older, but still under 30 and remember being where you are.  My first thought is that if you have to say IT instead of having sex, you probably arent ready.  I know to you that may seem stupid, but if its still something you feel embarrased or ashamed of or guilty about, then its not the right time.  <br>  <br>  As far as waiting until you are married, thats a personal decision.  I would however, encourage you to wait until you are with someone you really care about it.  I had a lot of partners before marriage, and I dont regret nor think I was wrong for having sex before marriage, but I do regret loosing my virginity for the wrong reasons.  There could be other reasons to than love, but the first time I had sex it was with someone who was older and I did it to prove I wasnt little girl.  I was 15.  There is no way I could have supported a child had I gotten preg and have no idea what I wouldve done if I had gotten an std.  I didnt even like or want to be with the guy, but I just had to prove that I wasnt a lil girl and I was old enough to hang out with these people that were like 19-20ish.<br>  <br>  Make your first time something you do for you.  Whether you really feel like you want to have sex, wether its because you care about the person, make sure your reasons are for you, and that they are good reasons.  Having sex because everyone else is is NOT a good reason.|`|6gthdHpnaa	You don't even have a good reason to have sex, and you're probably not prepared to deal with the consequences, so wait. Who cares what everyone else is doing.|`|htT4N1ycaa	Hey, well I think you should do it when you're ready. You shouldn't do it just because everyone is doing it or because you just want to get it over with. That is a big step and when you do it with someone you truly love and loves you back is an amazing feeling. But if you lose it to the wrong person is something you're going to regret for the rest of your life because you'll never get it back. hope this helps.|`|TYQOafA8aa	My best advice is for you to wait till you get married, if you give away such a precious treasure as your virginity is you may regret it forever.|`|UOIcXs7Haa	Wait until you are old and mature enough and until you are with someone you can trust.<br>  If you are having doubts then now is not the time.<br>  <br>  Edit: Wait till your older.|`|PC6wDtK8aa	DONT DO IT<br>  its not worth it

QrBReRQbaa	Darxtar,<br>  <br>  When One holds true to their beliefs and remains open to other's opinions then they are not brainwashed.  You are brainwashed if you hold on to the fact that your truth is someone Else's. When someone is blasphemous or offensive to you, you are threatening them.  So remain true to yourself but remain open and respectful.|`|GB1f4sEEaa	Main Entry: brain·wash·ing  <br>  Pronunciation: \?brān-?wo?-shi?, -?w?-\ <br>  Function: noun <br>  Etymology: translation of Chinese (Beijing) xǐnǎo <br>  Date: 1950 <br>  1 : a forcible indoctrination to induce someone to give up basic political, social, or religious beliefs and attitudes and to accept contrasting regimented ideas <br>  <br>  Under the Merriam-Webster Dictionary definition, children who are indoctrinated into any religion fall under the definition of brain washing.  Since we are not born with any religious belief the child is forced to give up their non belief in religion.  <br>  <br>  You do not know that you are brain washed because of the brain washing.|`|mxAraZlsaa	Thats actually a good question and i've thought about it considering i'm mormon and everyone blabs out this is the case for us. First of all its not easy to put one definition of whats being brain washed. If you repeatedly tell yourself to stop on red lights and it becomes automatic are you brainwashed while driving? Are we brainwashed because we run when hearing a barking dog behind us but fail to look back and confirm this? Are you brainwashed because you shower daily and brush your teeth everyday and probably have a very similar routine when you get ready?  We pretty much program ourselves as humans to what best fits our comfort levels. Your probably brainwashed to get mad if someone spits on you but you could always be happy. Then you can take this to the extreme of sleep deprivation and water-dropping to the point where the individual loses all senses of reality and goes into a psychosis break. We are all brainwashed to some degree because thats how we are designed. Now in my opinion if I brainwashed myself to study 8 hours a day believing that it would get me through law or medical school with flying colors would that be a good thing? heck yea man. get my point?|`|xfYUxKmvaa	I accept the truth about things. It is not brainwashing, it is learning.|`|huXBAulFaa	if you accept something, its because ur accepting something.|`|MPX0f5jzaa	Accepting something of your own free will?

Cnf0aivQaa	hiccups arent something you can really control, but you can try to get rid of them by holding your breath, eating two sugar cubes, or holding your breath while drinking ten sips of water. those are the best home remedies that i know of, which dont look too bad in proper society. just excuse yourself if you hiccup loudly|`|vs5rK3iRaa	Unlike most other bodily functions, one really has no control over hiccups.

These are evil spirits pretending to be one's deceased loved one. They know things about your loved one, but they are not them!  The Bible tell us not to have anything to do with "mediums."

So, pray for both of them.  <br>  <br>  My brother was a drug addict for 35 years.  I tried talking to him, criticizing him, talking about him to others and then, one night I was feeling hopeless.  God told me to stop what I was doing and to just love my brother.  He told me to keep coming to Him about this problem and to trust Him.  I did.  My brother got into some serious trouble and started asking me, of all people, about God and Jesus.  He spent time in jail and in rehab.  My brother's  life changed because God took over and not me. <br>  <br>  When we worry about things that we have no control over, it is like a hamster running on a wheel.  When we give the problem to God.  He does wonders with it.  Remember to give Him time and to trust that what ever happens is God working on the situation.  However, God will not take away a person's free will but, He will allow them to suffer enough to want to change.  God bless.|`|KmULmT7Baa	Wow that story had it all, God, alcohol, chaos.

It is a historical fact.  Catholicism may differ from another Christians interpretation but it is still the root of Christianity.  The Bible was put together originally by Catholic Scholars. Martin Luther was the first to question the Catholic Churches teachings and thus they all popped out of the wood work.  Mainly because of the intolerance of the Church but as history and this forum illustrates, you all become intolerant of others beliefs or paths.

TVJsOEKNaa	"The Chosen People":<br>  ----------------------------<br>  Judaism maintains that there are MANY paths to God. We don't proselytize because we believe that you do not have to be Jewish to be a righteous person.<br>  <br>  The "chosen people" refers to the fact that we *chose* to accept the 613 commandments.<br>  <br>  Have you ever purchased a cell phone from a store?<br>  <br>  Usually, you have to sign a contract, which outlines certain specific terms and laws that you have to abide by. When you sign this contract you are legally *choosing* to adhere to its' terms. If you break the contract however: You are likely to get harsher penalties as a result.<br>  <br>  The same is true for Jewish people: By choosing to adhere to the 613 commandments, we are bound in an eternal contract with God. This means that if we break contract we are subject to harsher penalties as a result. This is also true for someone who converts to Judaism.<br>  <br>  Alixia: YOUR Bible says to believe that.  Simply put, Jesus has nothing to do with Judaism.|`|315e05cc268b43fe093093a9e96280b8aa	You have your history out of order.  They "were" the chosen people.  They were chosen for a specific reason, which has been fulfilled.  Now God chooses everybody from every race.  Thanks for asking.|`|38vza5Gxaa	answer: Because people misunderstand what the term "chosen" means in this context. Yes, Jews are the Chosen of G-d - they chose G-d.  <br>  <br>  G-d asked them to obey his 613 commandments and He would bless them. He would bless others but wouldn't require as much from others but His covenant with the Jews would be eternal but it would be a difficult life.<br>  <br>  The Jewish people accepted.<br>  <br>  They were chosen to bring monotheism to the world. The Egyptian version of monotheism had been reversed and Zoroastrianism was very regionally defined.<br>  <br>  Those who say they "were" chosen ae calling G-d a liar. He said His covenant is eternal.|`|Ny7PHJiAaa	One really does not know. I am a christian and I had 5 different preachers from 5 different churches all tell me that.'you are a chosen child of god'. Is it true, I don't really know that either, all I know is that I do have just about all the spiritual gifts and I do have visions all the time and I receive messages that has been proven to be true.<br>  but it is also something that only happens when god allows this to happen and I never know when something is going to come to me or where it will happen at.<br>  So one really does not know the reason to that iI don't think.|`|bgA9wLD0aa	because the new testament is irrelevant to judaism.<br>  <br>  christians got that 'only thru me' stuff from the bhagavad gita.  it's not part of jewish theology.  therefore, jews don't need jesus to reach their god.<br>  <br>  even the hindus who originally wrote that don't take it literally.|`|b8e3dd68b7fdbbbac6132e0c73015651aa	it's interesting.  Jews never call themselve's 'chosen'.  this seems to be a label that has stuck with Christians.<br>  <br>  but it stems from those who were chosen by god to believe in him|`|wZVBWX0qaa	The Old Testament names the Jews God's chosen people. According to the Bible, the Jews were led by prophets who were guided directly by God. They believed in prophecies of a Messiah who would come and save them. This Jewish foundation is an important part of modern Judaism, Christianity, and other religions. <br>  <br>  The New Testament is where Christian and Jewish theology splits on Messiah concept. Some Jews and others believed that Jesus was the promised Messiah/Son of God and became the early Christians. Many Jews did not, and Judaism does not recognize the New Testament as truth. Their foundation continues to be the Torah/Old Testament, and they continue to believe that they are God's chosen people awaiting a Messiah who has not yet appeared.|`|Ldxf1tW1aa	Read the covenant that was made with Abraham and you will understand.|`|hceNM6Uxaa	Jews chose to follow their covenant with G-d.  Other people have other covenants.  We don't believe that people have to follow ours.  We don't see the 'choosing' as making us special.<br>  <br>  Christianity believes there is only one way to G-d.  Jews believe there are many.  Christians include the New Testament in their scriptures,  Jews don't.  Jewish scriptures (the Tanakh, the original Hebrew version of the "Old Testament") says nothing about Jesus.  It talks, in 23 prophecies, about a messiah.  Jesus was not our messiah because he didn't fulfil those prophecies.<br>  <br>  Trying to understand one religion through the beliefs of a totally different one is never going to work very well.|`|8I9uduIiaa	We are 'chosen' just to keep more laws. Judaism says that ALL humans are EQUALLY G-d's children. And all faiths are 'chosen' for different things.<br>  <br>  G-d spoke to over a million Jews at Mt Sinai. He told us - I say us as we believe all Jewish souls were present - that we are NEVER to worship anyone but him. We are NEVER to worship ANY HUMAN.<br>  <br>  Jesus - to us - was a mortal man. Nothing more. Nothing less.<br>  <br>  And he did not fulfill the description of OUR maschiach in OUR scriptures.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://ajewwithaview.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://ajewwithaview.blogspot.com</a>|`|cZ3h1dffaa	Because of all the people of the Earth He chose to go with them.<br>  <br>  As it says in Exodus 33:15 Then Moses said to him, "If your Presence does not go with us, do not send us up from here. 16 How will anyone know that you are pleased with me and with your people unless you go with us? What else will distinguish me and your people from all the other people on the face of the earth?" <br>  <br>   17 And the LORD said to Moses, "I will do the very thing you have asked, because I am pleased with you and I know you by name." <br>  <br>  This is why they are His people.  His chosen.<br>  <br>  As for not believing in Jesus, well, the Bible is not the Torah.  The Bible says much that is not in the Torah.  What Christians believe and Jews believe is not the same.  Their God is not the same, despite what Christians say.  The Jewish G-d is one.  He has no son.  Different religions.  Different Gods.  IMO.<br>  .
yhFJzscmaa	Most definitely. But don't stop there. Study and pray about why God calls you to a higher call, that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit and what that really means for you. Find out why he is disrespecting you by using you as a means to his pleasure. What you describe is not love, but the opposite of love, which is lust. The point is, you really, down deep want love, right? Your relationship isn't love and not likely to lead to it.

I was ALWAYS looking, then for some reason I took a bad turn.  During that time, I went to a new church, and I met my husband.  It wasn't expected at all, and he didn't seem my type.

The saying makes perfect sense. <br>  <br>  It is a saying about being unable to reconcile opposites or contradictions. It is also a saying about having to make a choice between two alternatives (and not being able to have both).<br>  <br>  It cannot be both raining and not raining at the same time. You cannot have a reputation as a good person if you lie, cheat and steal. You cannot do well in school if all you do is play and goof off (though you could grow up to be president). You cannot have a big savings account if all you do is spend every cent you have (and usually don't have, by using credit). You cannot be married and single at the same time.

Those who do need to trust God through Jesus Christ. <br>  <br>  Read this and I hope that you understand it:<br>   31 "The one who comes from above is above all; the one who is from the earth belongs to the earth, and speaks as one from the earth. The one who comes from heaven is above all. 32 He testifies to what he has seen and heard, but no one accepts his testimony. 33 The man who has accepted it has certified that God is truthful. 34 For the one whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for God gives the Spirit without limit. 35 The Father loves the Son and has placed everything in his hands. 36 Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but whoever rejects the Son will not see life, for God's wrath remains on him."<br>  <br>  Jesus said those words. He said that whoever trusts in God through him is granted eternal life. He said that he is the truth, and his words are true. So you can understand that Jesus is the way to have peace with God. If you trust him always you are walking on the path to righteousness. God thinks a lot of that, and those who do that are those He claims as His own.|`|msNXomjTaa	Russian Orthodox?  Cool!  You could probably explain the concept of the Trinity better than most here!<br>  <br>  Anyway, what stops you from going to church now?  Could you walk or bus to one?

However, I would try to find a community that you can become comfortable in. I believe that communal worship is a good thing.<br>  <br>  The bible is a collection of books.  It was a French man who decided to divide the books up into chapters and verses.  He messed up in quite a few spots, but we use his idea to this day.  the first number is the chapter, the second the verse.  Often, the book name is abbreviated.  This, Lk 5:1-9 would mean the Gospel according to Luke, chapter 5, verses 1 to 9.<br>  |`|fbdad2836b12a55aac5a35bcb551f09caa	I've found that most churches today have a website and a church locator. So you may be able to find their official website and use that to find a congregation. <br>  <br>  As far as the 6:2 that is part of the scripture reference location system.<br>  <br>  For instance, Romans 6:2....you would look for the book of Romans.  Most Bibles have a table of contents at the beginning, and they are often broken down into pages by Old and New Testaments. So, look for the applicable book in the Table of Contents. <br>  <br>  The first number is always the chapter, and the 2nd number after the colon ":" is the verse. <br>  <br>  |`|z2XCCrxqaa	I gave the 2nd answer a thumbs up before finishing his entire answer.

It's set up that way, because each title is a book and each set of numbers is a chapter and a sub section. If you want to be more in touch with your religion, find a small group that will help you get to a church in your area.|`|xDd7Snfdaa	I think the thing to focus on is your own personal relationship with God. Church is always a good thing, but it is really prayer and being in the Bible that will help you grow in your faith. have you tried talking to your parents and letting them know how you feel? They may not realize how much your faith means to you.<br>  <br>  The Bible is separated into Books, Chapters and Verses. if someone said Luke 4:3 It would be the book of Luke Chapter 4 verse 3. It is just a way of finding specific parts quickly and easily as many books of the Bible are quite long.|`|QusenkISaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  You may be interested in this short audio clip.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sermonaudio.com/sermoninfo.asp?SID=917081616356" rel="nofollow">http://www.sermonaudio.com/sermoninfo.as...</a><br>  <br>  If you want to know Christianity, read the Bible... pray as you read that God would help you understand what you're reading, and guide your thinking.

Church is important too; but choose a church based on their doctrines, and how well their teachings match up to what the Bible teaches.

The departing life of such a living thing possesses neither identity nor personality; it does not individually survive death.

w8uUWK03aa	That's a VERY long question.  Well, it's not so much a question as an admission.  You have described a relationship which is not common and naturally you are wondering about it.<br>  <br>  Of course your partner is playing a power game with you, because of his size, age and demeanor and emotional complexities.  He is using you, a smaller white guy as a means of venting his racial and sexual  frustrations.  He would have to be bisexual at the very least, denying it is just a defence mechanism.<br>  <br>  I doesn't sound to me as if you are totally happy with the relationship and certain elements are overpowering you.  However, you may have masochistic tendencies which will keep you going back for more. I don't think this will ever develop in to a loving two-way relationship and it's only a millimetre away from becoming a physically abusive situation.<br>  <br>  He's already abusing you emotionally, the moment he raises his hand in anger, is when it could develop to rape, in which case you need to get free, unless that's what you really like?  You must appreciate that you are as much a part of this as he is and in the end you have to decide if this is what you want on a long term basis.

If any body knows that I am wrong, tell me the truth.|`|nWB0NC9Iaa	The "base flag" of Saudi Arabia, the shahada or Islamic profession of faith ("There is no god but God and Muhammad is the Prophet of God") on solid green was an old flag, connected to the Wahhabi reformist movement of the late 18th century, with whose religious drive the Al Saud family first rose to power. The sword was added in 1902, when Abdul Aziz ibn Abdul Rahman Al Saud ("Ibn Saud" to the British) established himself as Sultan of the Nejd.<br>  <br>  In 1925, Abdulaziz established himself as King of the Nejd and Hejaz, with unknown flag alterations. (The King of Hejaz, Hussein, had used the Arab Revolt Flag).<br>  <br>  When the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was established in 1932, the earlier Nejdi flag continued, though variants are shown with two swords, with a white stripe toward the hoist, etc.<br>  Ed Haynes, 14 March 1996<br>  <br>  In The International Flag Book, Christian Fogd Pedersen gives the date 1946 for the adoption of the national flag (with the older pattern of sword).<br>  Christopher Southworth, 14 April 2003<br>  <br>  The national flag of Saudi Arabia has maintained its basic characteristics -- the Shahada (or Testimony) written in white Arabic script over a white sword against a green background -- for many decades(1)<br>  <br>  There seem to have been three major design variations over the years. The earliest flag had a very simplified version of the inscription on a rather square field with a very white heading at the hoist.(2)<br>  <br>  The next stage may have been introduced at the time of the unification of the country, under the name Kingdom of the Hijaz and of Nejd and its Dependencies' in February 1927. The inscription in this case was in the complicated thuluth script and filled nearly the entire field of the flag.(3)<br>  <br>  In 1973, a Royal decree established a precise design(4) in which the inscription was condensed to one-eighth the flag's area and the weapon was changed from a curved saber to a straight Arab sword. Recently (1984) a further modification has been introduced in the national flag: the hilt in the previous design has been replaced by a simpler form. Unfortunately, it has not been possible to obtain a Royal decree or other legal instrument establishing this design as the exclusive one for the national flag.(4)<br>  <br>  (1) Its exact age is not clear. E.H. Baxter, National Flags (London: Warne, 1934) stated that "This flag is said to have been designed about 100 years ago by the Grandfather of the present King." That it was in use in 1911 is evident from the contemporary photograph reproduced between pp. 190 and 191 in Robert Lacey's The Kingdom (London: Hutchinson, 1981). The interesting article by Oleg Tarnovsky, "The Flag History of Saudi Arabia" (Flagmaster, No. 41) is, unfortunately, misleading in its documentation and presents factual claims with a degree of certainty not justified by available evidence.<br>  <br>  (2) The heading -- a piece of material attached to the flag which forms a sleeve through which the pole passes does not figure in the symbolic meaning of the flag as it varies in width and is sometimes completely absent, e.g. in table flags and in a flag whose heading has grommets or a rope. It would seem, therefore, that the white stripe in the Saudi flag should not be considered as an inherent part of the flag, but as an accessory to it (like fringe, pole, finial, cravate, etc.)<br>  <br>  (3) Illustrations of this flag can be found on plate 14 of the Flaggenbuch of the high command of the German Naval War Ministry (Berlin: Reichsdruckerei, 1939; on p. 344 of "Flags of the World" by Gilbert Grosvenor and William J. Showalter, the The National Geographic Magazine, LXVI:3 (September 1934) ; and in various flag charts produced by the United Nations.|`|jiMAtaCraa	"The sword symbolizes the importance of the inscription by underlining it."<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Saudi_Arabia" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Sau...</a>|`|5wrOgQ5Baa	Why is there an Ottoman sign on the Pakistan flag?<br>  <br>  Confused?<br>  <br>  www.confused.com|`|AA10273995	sword : sowrd is to defend the country. <br>  <br>  bedouin used sowrd to defend his honor and his trib.|`|NlQhkgFCaa	Description here <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Saudi_Arabia" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Sau...</a>|`|dUBPvt6Faa	I guess the chubby arabs put it on their flag because it reminds them of the time they had ballz|`|4ViYw6Hxaa	hypocrisy|`|H8WqMK1eaa	The sword was added in 1902, when Abdul Aziz ibn Abdul Rahman Al Saud ("Ibn Saud" to the British) established himself as Sultan of the Nejd.|`|uO0knmZOaa	The intention might possibly be to indicate the authority's commitment to the SECURITY of its citizens.

You sometimes don't know what you've got til it's gone. Sometimes you do know what you have and it is taken from you (i.e. loved ones that you appreciate every day that pass away) If I have learned one thing in life it is that no theory is always right. It so depends on the situation. The best thing to do in life is to do what you feel in your heart, what is true to yourself. You could do something nice for someone and it could end up ruining their life, you never know what the outcome will be. You can try to predict all you want but you never know what will happen in the future. The only thing you can do is learn from your mistakes and keep on moving forward.<br>  <br>  I think a lot of people know what they are missing but are too afraid to go out and get it.

6ELSwKKvaa	D:<br>  <br>  True homosexuality is not a choice. The waters get muddied by bisexuals when they do studies. Because bisexuals do have a choice, many will consider them homosexual when they have a same sex partner even though their true identity is bisexual.<br>  <br>   I believe that homosexuals are mostly born that way and are not affected much by their environment. I believe this because of many of my own life experiences. I have had people tell me that a person who has an abusive home life, alcoholism, divorce,rape and other environmental factors will more likely be gay. If that were the truth, then I would be gay and my daughter wouldn't be. (I am straight and she is lesbian) I was abused by my dad, raped,my parents divorced, I became an alcoholic, and had a very rough life to start with. I also had a best friend who was a lesbian and she never swayed me to try it or even like it. (So obviously being gay isn't catchy)<br>  <br>   My daughter on the other hand was raised by both her parents who are still married. My husband and I have a very tame relationship and do not even argue often. I raised my daughter with Christian values and sent her to a Lutheran school when she was younger and I talk to her about God all the time. She has never been raped. She has never been abused. She does not use alcohol, tobacco, or drugs. (she doesn't even like prescriptions) There is no environmental reason she should be gay.<br>  <br>    On the argument of it being something that happens in the fetal stages of life, I have some evidence that something did happen with my daughter. My first sign was that while I was pregnant I kept feeling like I was having  a boy. I even had a test that showed she was female without doubt but I continued to call her- him! This continued for about 2 weeks after I gave birth. ( About the same time it takes for hormones to subside after pregnancy) Also, the time that the fingers develop in fetal stages is also the time that scientists know that the area of the brain that connects to sexuality is formed. Many homosexuals have variants in their finger lengths that is different than heterosexuals. My daughter has really short thumbs that we lovingly refer to as shrumbs. This points to a hormonal flux during the time her sexual center of of the brain was formed.<br>  <br>   She expressed an interest in marrying a female teacher at age 5. This wasn't about sex but it showed that she was naturally attracted more to females. Then at age 10, some letters were discovered where she was talking to another girl about having feelings for people of the same gender as her. (so obviously it wasn't about rebellion) Then at age 15, she finally accepted that she is a lesbian.<br>  <br>   None of these factors alone would say she was definitely born gay but when they are added together, it points to it being something that we are born with. It is like if you have the number one... it can never equal two until you add another 1 to it.

From places you go, what you drink, and what you eat, to how many times you scraped your knees or what medicines you have taken. Epigenetics are what turn parts of your DNA on and off, because obviously, not all parts of your DNA are active all the time, in every cell (for instance, parts of your DNA for growing toenails, are not active in your liver). <br>  <br>  DNA in twins is the same through out their life, but their epigenetics change. New born twins will have the same epigenetics, by five, there are many differences, and by 13 you would never know that they were twins.|`|5DhtndSIaa	E- All of the above.  Some of us are more willing to go with the behaviors exhibited by those around us while harboring secret desires, while others act according to their own feelings and minimize others attitudes and opinions.

The "Nature v/s Nurture" arguments are endless and useless.

Then there would not be any fear. Read books, read novels, do some interested & creative work. Do exercises, specially Yoga.|`|3K06CeQuaa	Realistically, it depends on what the fear is. Understand the root of your fear. Study the history of how it started and why. Then with prayer and faith, confront it. Confront it in a way that wouldn't harm you and make you become more fearful. Some confrontations can be just you and your fear, others may require a third or fourth party (depending on what the fear is). But fear is very real and has to be taken from a practical stand point.

5JqCObDSaa	It almost adds up to 50/50, but it probably depends on where you meet these people. I don't find the percentage of those that hate or don't like me that high, but I am referring mostly to all the places I have worked and church because that is where I spend most of my time. So, based on my experience, I would say it would be a little higher on the people who will like you and stay loyal and also on the ones that will eventually like you. I have met alot of caring people and maybe that is because I work in the medical profession. Some times when it comes to different cultures though it takes a little warming up and getting to know you, but I was raised to love everybody and I don't have a problem with about 90% of the people I meet, but like you said some are just not going to like you no matter what, it might be the way they were brought up or they were hurt to many times and just don't trust anyone. I am praying that the percentage of people who like each other will increase because there is no reason why people shouldn't be able to like each other and get along. You don't have to be lovey dovey, but the key is to respect and care for the individual no matter what. Jesus even tells us to love our enemies:<br>  Luke 6:27-36 <br>  <br>  [27] "But I tell you who hear me: Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, [28] bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you. [29] If someone strikes you on one cheek, turn to him the other also. If someone takes your cloak, do not stop him from taking your tunic. [30] Give to everyone who asks you, and if anyone takes what belongs to you, do not demand it back. [31] Do to others as you would have them do to you. <br>  <br>  [32] "If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? Even 'sinners' love those who love them. [33] And if you do good to those who are good to you, what credit is that to you? Even 'sinners' do that. [34] And if you lend to those from whom you expect repayment, what credit is that to you? Even 'sinners' lend to 'sinners,' expecting to be repaid in full. [35] But love your enemies, do good to them, and lend to them without expecting to get anything back. Then your reward will be great, and you will be sons of the Most High, because he is kind to the ungrateful and wicked. [36] Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful. <br>  <br>  I just wanted to share the scripture to show why the percentage of people you love should be so much greater even though statistics don't show it, maybe we can make a difference one by one.<br>  Thanks, Sis : )|`|1ec32bd76f3584208ce83bf42928a21faa	I wound not agree.  We should not meet anyone with a preconceived idea of how he/she would react to us.  We should keep an open mind and if we act with the love of Jesus towards them we can expect a positive response all the time.

I don't hate any human being and I can not conceive of anyone hating a person that they don't even know, I just can't imagine how that would work.

And I don't believe that I'm unique, I think I' m a typical Christian.

Nevertheless, the countries are considered by US standards to be located in the huge Asian continent, therefore the term Asian is not at all faulty when applied to your race but still problematic because Asians as a category falls into many races and cultures.

hvIrXa9Gaa	Dutch is very similar to English, and not really popular, I would try that if I were you. You could also try Romanian, it's sort of like Spanish which isn't that hard, but Romanian might be a little harder. Three more for you, Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish, they're all very similar (you can understand one if you speak another) and also similar to English, but generally they are a little harder than Dutch. German is also similar to English, but the grammar is complicated, so i wouldn't necessarily suggest it. <br>  <br>  I, personally, would suggest Dutch to you, I've always wanted to learn it myself.<br>  <br>  Hope that helped!|`|ohUm00RYaa	Please be more specific.  I have learned or have functioning knowledge of english, chenouwah, french, italian, spanish, and mandarin.<br>  <br>  I tried russian but the alpahbet pissed me off and I gave up.<br>  <br>  Firstly where do you live, secondly where do you want to work and in what sector, fourthly what do want to use the language for, 5th do you need to only speak the language or do you also want written competency.  I find that some langugaes are easy to speak (mandarin) but near impossible to write in.<br>  <br>  I'll check back later, btu answer those questions.<br>  <br>  Firstly ignore those people who tell you to learn a language like dutch, it is near useless, I know second generation dutch people and they don't speak it, plus netheerlands is a very small country.  Not to undermind it but there are better languages<br>  <br>  If you want to learn a language for speaking in north america only spanish and french are of any use, you will not encounter enough speakers of other langauges unless you live in a specific immigrant area.  See I live in toronto which is 50% foreign born but it is highly unusual you see, so that why your city is important, in Toronto you can learn any language.<br>  also know that you will unlikely learn a language just for fun.  <br>  <br>  There are many reason to do it but fun is not one usually, learning a new language is hard work, its like being a baby all over again and frustrating being unable to say the most basic things but it can be rewarding too.<br>  <br>  Italian is the easiest langauge of romance as it has the least letters, easiest pronounciation, and simpliest structure.  I think french is the sexiest for girls, i want to meet sexy girls so i learn french.  However I must admit that mandarin is by far the easiest language to SPEAK, its structures are nearly the same as English, no conjugations, real similar to english in speaking form.  To make past tense in mandarin you just add a word infront of the verb you want to say and its always the same.<br>  <br>  The only reason I picked french over mandarin was because leanring mandarin in a university is a bad idea because you will be competing with kids who speak it at home and pretend that they do not.<br>  Mandarin is also fun to speak because of the tones of all languages, it makes it a bit more fun. Eventually though tones just come natural and you will pronounce a word in a tone without thinking about it.<br>  <br>  Learn in a small class of no more than 5 people otherwise its a waste of time|`|63c55fb09156c93c3b5c3ce5bbcde27eaa	I thin you should learn Chinese.<br>  It has a big market.<br>  I hope your help.|`|I5pUxwPbaa	try hindi, it's not overly complex to learn|`|pC1H7kO4aa	DUTCH!<br>  :]|`|daa555b9d5938b25739bf2f6d4476a18aa	mandarin, we do so much business with them|`|HY5YTjpDaa	what about danish?

While the KJV translators strove for word-for-word accuracy, and overall it is one of the better translations, it does contain at least a few translation errors.<br>  <br>  For example, the KJV in a few places speaks of "unicorns", while most scholars agree that a more accurate translation would be "wild ox".<br>  <br>  Also in Acts 12:4, the KJV uses the word "Easter".  Everywhere else this word appears in the Bible, however, this version correctly uses the word "Passover".  "Easter" is an incorrect translation.<br>  <br>  One good thing about the KJV, however, is that it has been around long enough that we know where these weaknesses are and they have been explained by many.<br>  <br>  Some, however, find the language of the KJV difficult because it was translated in 1611 and many words in the English language have changed in meaning since then and the style of speech is different.<br>  <br>  Other translations that are very accurate are the English Standard Version, ASV (1901), RSV, and NASB.<br>  <br>  The most accurate is an interlinear Bible, however, these may be hard to read because many just translate words without trying to put them in any normal sentence structure.|`|6RCHJQfQaa	In the English language, none.  The problem with a close to literal translation is that people would want to read it.  There is a translation out there called "Young's Literal Translation".  It is more literal than most but still has modern english compromises with the wording and dogmatic words such as Church, Gospel, Apostle and Gentile.  You won't find "Young's Literal Translation" on most books shelves.  It is not a popular book.  You can find it on line.  <br>  <br>  I am semi-fluent in Greek and if anyone wishes to see what a nearly literal translation would look like I have translated 3 books of the New Testament (Galatians, Ephesians and Jude).  I would be willing to email these translations to you if you are interested.|`|5NSfFGqxaa	God is unchangeable. God's word is unchangeable too. In Matthew 24:35, the Lord Jesus said, "Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away." <br>  <br>  Why then are we so ready to accept changes to God's word in the form of different Bible versions? The Authorized King James text has faithfully served the body of Christ for almost 400 years. During this time, and during its translation, Satan has viciously and relentlessly attacked it. I now hear Christians attacking it too! I've heard preachers and people say things like, "it's too hard to read" We must remember that the Bible is a spiritual book and is understandable to those who are led by God's Spirit. It is not impossible for the KJV to be understood by someone truly led by God's Spirit. The NIV and such translations have been changed to the words that we use today and making it more understandable to a lot of people. The Bible is not supposed to read like a fairy tale--Peter said, "for we have not followed cunningly devised fables" [II Peter 1:16]. The words of the Authorized King James are not laborious to me, they are beautiful and full of God's power and seeing the NIV or other such translations take that part away from the Bible.<br>  <br>  The new versions have come up with some changes to the scriptures. The Lord God gives us stern warnings about changing His Word-- <br>  <br>  Revelation 22:18-19, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book: And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book. <br>  Proverbs 30:5-6, Every word of God is pure: he is a shield unto them that put their trust in him. Add thou not unto his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar. <br>  <br>  So stay true to the closet thing we have to the Original text and read the Authorized King James Version and if you can't understand it pray for understanding!|`|2P5WRadhaa	1611 King james version.

I was raised United Methodist and my mother frequently took me to church as a child, although my father only attended church twice a year (on Easter and Christmas) and otherwise showed no outward signs of faith in God. <br>  As a child, I was heavily influenced by my brother's nature books and shows that I saw on TV that introduced me to evolution. By the time I was 14, I decided that I was an atheist. I had a lot of questions about creation that weren't getting answered, and at the time I was going through a very dark period in my life, where I believed that God had abandoned me. I even wrote a school paper on my atheism. To my surprise, my dad told me I didn't know what I was talking about, which was surprising for someone who rarely attended church. I remained an atheist for the next 20 years, and I was quite outspoken about it. I had a "Darwin" fish on my car; I used to go online and tell Christians how stupid they were for believing what they did. I was a typical liberal - pro-choice, democrat, evolutionist, atheist - I was quite the little "feminazi". <br>  It wasn't until later I had a live-in boyfriend who was a cradle Catholic. I "tolerated" his faith in God for a while, then I got to know his family. One day, we were attending the baptism of his niece, and I was sitting in the pews before the service began, and I was watching all these people around me kneeling and praying spontaneously without anyone instructing them to. They obviously had or knew something that I didn't. I decided to take a chance, and I kneeled down and prayed, "OK, God, if you're really there, tell me how to get the Holy Spirit. I don't understand how everyone else can have it and I don't. Please tell me how to get the Holy Spirit." Then I finished and sat back in the pew. When the priest began his homily, it was about "How to get the Holy Spirit"!! I was totally floored! Even as an atheist, I didn't believe in those kinds of coincidences. I knew then that God was trying to get my attention in a way I could understand. <br>  So I kneeled down once again, and prayed for God to forgive me for all those years of unbelief and the way I treated Him, and to come into my heart and make me a new person. And He did! From that day on, He began working in my life to change me from the inside out. I have done a complete 180 from what I used to be. Today I am a social conservative, pro-life, young-earth creationist Christian. Eventually, I left the Catholic Church and joined the Seventh-Day Adventist Church after viewing some prophecy seminars that they offered.<br>  However, it wasn't like that all at once. I had once visited a pro-life website when I was pro-choice, and I saw all these pictures of poor aborted babies. I finally came to a realization - "how could anybody do such a horrible thing to their baby?" And I was ashamed of having supported that butchery all those years. <br>  Even after having become a Christian, I still had one problem - I still believed in evolution. I just thought there was too much evidence to deny. So one day I asked my pastor about it, and he handed me a CD-Rom that contained a series of seminars on Creation Science, about 15 hours worth of information. I watched them on my computer, and I was totally blown away by the information! I had never been taught any of this in public school, and I later became angry that they had brainwashed me like that all those years. I reviewed the information several times. It made so much more sense than evolution, and it also made the Bible come alive. I found that there are thousands of scientific facts that deny evolution and support a young Earth, a worldwide Flood and intelligent design. So I dropped evolution like the proverbial "hot potato" and became a young-earth creationist. I even plan to speak at schools, churches and any other venues on the subject, as soon as I can put together a PowerPoint presentation. I think it's very important that people learn this. Their salvation may depend on it. I pray that if you are an atheist/evolutionist, that you will take my words to heart and read some creationist materials, like "The Evolution Cruncher" by Vance Ferrell, which is an excellent source of facts made readily-available and whose sources are cited. It contains thousands of scientific facts that destroy the theory of evolution.|`|LUGCxeuNaa	An atheist who became a Christian probably did so because he or she let their feelings get in their way.<br>  <br>  <br>  ROFL CJ was never an atheist.

Verse 34 states that women should not speak something for which they are under submission.  The submission here implies that a wife to be submissive to her husband and wound apply to the instance when a wife tries to speak publicly about the affairs of her family to the church when she should allow her husband as the head of the family to do so.  Verse 35 confirms this interpretation when the wife is exhorted to speak to her husband about the matter.  God bless you.|`|QUg9W2NGaa	In the town of Corinth the church was growing up at a fast pace but in a unorganized fashion. What Paul wrote to the Church of Corinth was an attempt to get some order during worship time. He advised them that it was ok to prophesy, and ok to speak in tongues but always in a good organized way. Women assisting to the Church were not familiar with the Charismatic aspect of the service and this aroused many questions for them. In advising to be quite at Church and ask questions later, Paul once again was procuring to bring little more silence and order to the celebration and it was not his intention to discriminate. His idea was that Jesus founded his church by training men and not women.|`|wB3AbJyLaa	Many of the beliefs of our grandparents and great-grandparents now seem silly and even embarrassing to us. That process is not going to stop now. Our grandchildren will find many of our views quite outmoded as well. Wouldn't it be tragic if we threw the Bible away over a belief that will soon look pretty weak or wrong? To stay away from Christianity because part of the Bible's teaching is offensive to you assumes that if there is a God he wouldn't have any views that upset you. Does that belief make sense? I have more bit of advice to people struggling with some of the Bible's teaching. We should make sure we distinguish between the major themes and message of the Bible and its less primary teachings. The Bible talks about the person and work of Christ and also about how widows should be regarded in the church. The first of these subjects is much more foundational. Without it the secondary teachings don't make sense. We should therefore consider the Bible's teachings in their proper order. Let's take the hot issue today as a good example. If you say, "I can't accept what the Bible says about gender roles," you must keep in mind that Christians themselves differ over what some texts mean, as they do about many, many other things. However, they all confess in the words of the Apostle's Creed that Jesus rose form the dead on the third day. Don't worry about gender roles until you figure out what you think about the central teachings of the faith. You may appeal, "But I can't accept the Bible if what it says about gender is outmoded." I would respond to that with this question: Are you saying that because you don't like what the Bible says about sex that Jesus couldn't have raised from the dead? I'm sure you wouldn't insist on such a non sequitur. If Jesus is the Son of God, then we have to take his teaching seriously, including his confidence in the authority of the whole Bible. If he is not who he says he is, why should we care what the Bible says about anything else? Think of it like this. If you dive into the shallow end of the Bible pool, where there are many controversies over interpretation, you may get scraped up. But if you dive into the center of the Biblical pool, where there is consensus, about the deity of Christ, his death and resurrection, you will be safe. It is therefore important to consider the Bible's core claims about who Jesus is and whether he rose from the dead before you reject it for its less central and more controversial teachings.|`|i2RxJAYeaa	He finally got laid.

But in the end my Lord has warned me that this would be the case and has prepared me for it.  Nothing that I have been taught about Jesus and the gospel has died away.

Both by Michner and have read both several times to get the full benefit. <br>  <br>  The Source: A parallel frame story set in modern-day Israel supports the historical timeline. Archaeologists digging at the tell at Makor uncover artifacts from each layer, which then serve as the basis for a chapter exploring the lives of the people involved with that artifact. The novel begins with a Stone Age family whose daughter begins to realize that there is a supernatural force, then leads us to the beginnings of monotheism, the Davidic kingdom, Hellenistic times, Roman times, etc. It follows the story of the Family of Ur from the age of cavemen to modern times, with its descendants now living in the Galilee. Some consider The Source Michener's most popular book.<br>  <br>  The Covenant: The novel is set in South Africa, home to five distinct populations: Bantu (native Black tribes), Coloured (the result of generations of miscegenation between white Afrikaner and Bushmen populations), English, Afrikaner, and Indian, Chinese, and other foreign workers. The novel traces the history, interaction, and conflicts between these populations, from prehistoric times up to the 1970s.<br>  <br>  For pure escape and feeling your life isnt so bad after all I am currently hooked on Janet Evanovich and her "Stephanie Plum the bounty hunter", she always make me laugh, very destressing for me.|`|a4LWildhaa	Mutiny on the Bounty and the sequel, Pitcairn Island.

It was lovely to watch but I was really surprised at how much noise the dancers actually make.  When you see a production on TV you hear the music and the ballet dancers waft around silently and effortlessly and look absolutely beautiful.  In the flesh though, there's loads of clunking as they land on the boards and as a novice I found it very distracting.  It still looked wonderful and I'm glad I experienced it - but all the crashing and banging is a bit off-putting.  I think I'll stick to TV in future.|`|SfGyzMSFaa	I have attended ballet productions several times; both professional and student recitals.

There were several ballet artists that were in the production.<br>  It was the first time, I was able to observe dancers of their caliber, up<br>  close and personal. And I discovered, that they are more appealing<br>  on stage, under bright lights, where they dance so effortlessly, and<br>  with such grace. We would all take breaks during rehearsals and<br>  the dancers sat all in a row, discussing whatever, and we couldn't help<br>  but notice, they all reeked of perspiration. Both male and female. <br>  That really was a disappointment, that they were in such disregard<br>  for others around them in the cast and chorus line. I left the production<br>  at it's conclusion, and came away with the knowlege, that everything<br>  is not always as it appears to be. And after that, I had no further de-<br>  sire to be on stage, as I had in highschool.

h2RIc4OUaa	A'salam wr wb,<br>  I hope you're doing well my sister.<br>  As you know, there;s no adoption in Islam. Instead, we sponsor--sponsorship. Meaning, we take care of the children emotionally and financially-- raise them just like our own. We make sure, however, they know we;re not their real parent, which is the fact. So, anyone who's not a (type of; as in, father of the husband) father (even if he's thought of as a dad), then all the rules of non-Mahram applies. There are about 17 types of Mahram, but it's not the right time or space to mention them now. Again, adoption is not one of them; a "dad" (in sponsorship) is not a father; not a Mahram; he could still marry her if they both accept (unlike a Mahram; even if they want to, they can't).<br>  I hope this helped. <br>  May Allah be with you and surround u with good people. Take care and be well.<br>  XaTTab|`|dtRkn4Jlaa	Assalamoalikum,<br>  <br>  Yes it is necessary to properly cover yourself in front of anyone man who is not your father or brother or mahram. By cover i mean hijab or niqab. As for in front of step father, yes, you should cover yourself up properly too, as he is a non mahram for you. Anyone you can get married to is someone you have to be covered in front of. You cannot adopt anyone in islam, you can become the guardian, and if it is a girl they are guardian to, they need to follow the rules just the same as if the adopted girl was not someone they were guardian off. I hope this helps and i haven't confused you.

However they see no hope in atheism. They may have serious problems, and a philosophy to just make the most of themselves and that this life is all there is might be a touch unfeeling and arrogant; athiests can come across as smug and that can put off people with tough difficulties. Maybe they have seen some compassion from christians earlier in their lives, but not much from atheists or worldly unbelieving people. God's grace according to the Bible also comes more readily to the humble than the proud, and criminals probably often know they are messed up, and so may be less arrogant than the average person.|`|vGWD8Zncaa	I believe there's something to the notion that suspects and convicts tend to list themselves as Christian so much more often because they feel it will "look better" to juries (pre-conviction) and parole boards.<br>  <br>  It's not that I'm taking up for Christians as being any more moral than atheists - but it's likely the extreme disparity in the numbers can partially be explained by what I'm saying.  It just has the "ring of truth" that a suspect / convict would try to garner sympathy by either claiming to already be a Christian or to have "found God" and now, having repented, deserve to be let out.|`|fmgPKOaraa	because they outnumber atheists something like 10,000 to 1. it's not like they are over represented...as Christianity is the most claimed religion this country<br>  <br>  and then there are the thousands who repent and become Christians while in prison, which swell the numbers...<br>  <br>  and the fact that there is no breakdown for catholics, mormons, etc...all are counted as "Christian"...<br>  <br>  use your head...it's not rocket science...|`|533z6lWpaa	This question is very complex. The main thing to remember is that simply because someone claims to be a religion does not mean that they are actually so. Ask a bunch of people who don't attend church or read the Bible what religion they are and most of them will probably say Christian. Why? Many of their parents raised them that way. A Christian does what Christ did. Of course, you also have to remember that EVERYONE makes mistakes. We have to have compassion for all people! That's what this world is missing. Compassion and love!|`|tqQIcLb5aa	Because people say they're religious right before they deny having committed the Godless act they committed.

Of the manner wherein he introduces them: “Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord, 1Co_7:25. I have no express and universal law delivered by the Lord himself concerning celibacy; but I give my judgment, as one who hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful,” namely, in the apostleship. He acted faithfully, and therefore his direction was to be regarded as a rule of Christ: for he gave judgment as one who was a faithful apostle of Christ. Though Christ had before delivered no universal law about that matter, he now gives direction by an inspired apostle, one who had obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful. Note, Faithfulness in the ministry is owing to the grace and mercy of Christ. It is what Paul was ready to acknowledge upon all occasions: I laboured more abundantly than they all; yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me, 1Co_15:10. And it is a great mercy which those obtain from God who prove faithful in the ministry of his word, either ordinary or extraordinary.<br>  II. The determination he gives, which, considering the present distress, was that a state of celibacy was preferable: It is good for a man so to be, that is, to be single. I suppose, says the apostle, or it is my opinion. It is worded with modesty, but delivered, notwithstanding, with apostolic authority. It is not the mere opinion of a private man, but the very determination of the Spirit of God in an apostle, though it be thus spoken. And it was thus delivered to give it the more weight. Those that were prejudiced against the apostle might have rejected this advice had it been given with a mere authoritative air. Note, Ministers do not lose their authority by prudent condescensions. They must become all things to all men, that they may do them the more good. This is good, says he, for the present distress. Christians, at the first planting of their religion, were grievously persecuted. Their enemies were very bitter against them, and treated them very cruelly. They were continually liable to be tossed and hurried by persecution. This being the then state of things, he did not think it so advisable for Christians that were single to change conditions. The married state would bring more care and cumber along with it (1Co_15:33, 1Co_15:34), and would therefore make persecution more terrible, and render them less able to bear it. Note, Christians, in regulating their conduct, should not barely consider what is lawful in itself, but what may be expedient for them.<br>  III. Notwithstanding he thus determines, he is very careful to satisfy them that he does not condemn marriage in the gross, nor declare it unlawful. And therefore, though he says, “If thou art loosed from a wife (in a single state, whether bachelor or widower, virgin or widow) do not seek a wife, do not hastily change conditions;” yet he adds, “If thou art bound to a wife, do not seek to be loosed. It is thy duty to continue in the married relation, and do the duties of it.” And though such, if they were called to suffer persecution, would find peculiar difficulties in it; yet, to avoid these difficulties, they must not cast off nor break through the bonds of duty. Duty must be done, and God trusted with events. But to neglect duty is the way to put ourselves out of the divine protection. He adds therefore, I thou marry thou hast not sinned; or if a virgin marry she hath not sinned: but such shall have trouble in the flesh. Marrying is not in itself a sin, but marrying at that time was likely to bring inconvenience upon them, and add to the calamities of the times; and therefore he thought it advisable and expedient that such as could contain should refrain from it; but adds that he would not lay celibacy on them as a yoke, nor, by seeming to urge it too far, draw them into any snare; and therefore says, But I spare you. Note, How opposite in this are the papist casuists to the apostle Paul! They forbid many to marry, and entangle them with vows of celibacy, whether they can bear the yoke or no.<br>  IV. He takes this occasion to give general rules to all Christians to carry themselves with a holy indifferency towards the world, and every thing in it. 1. As to relations: Those that had wives must be as though they had none; that is, they must not set their hearts too much on the comforts of the relation; they must be as though they had none. They know not how soon they shall have none. This advice must be carried into every other relation. Those that have children should be as though they had none.

But Paul is true to the heart and teaching of Jesus, who told all Christians in all ages to be ready and anticipate His return. We are to be ready, and to regard the time as short, not only because Jesus can return at any time, but also because it cultivates a more obedient, on-fire walk with Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  For what it is worth ...  The Greek word for short is "sustello", which means contracted and rolled up, as sails used to be by the mariners, when the ship draws nigh to the harbor.|`|sDNTMAkmaa	Yes, the KJV translation does say that, and you are correct to interpret it that way.<br>  I know that I will get thumbs down for this, but Joseph Smith made corrections to the Bible's translation up until he was martyred. You may not believe in my church, but when I read the Bible, it doesn't quite make sense to me. But when I read the Bible with Joseph Smith's translations, it makes better sense.<br>  <br>  Joseph Smith's correction:<br>  29 But I speak unto you who are called unto the ministry. For this I say, brethren, the time that remaineth is but short, that ye shall be sent forth unto the ministry. Even they who have wives, shall be as though they had none; for ye are called and chosen to do the Lord’s work.|`|Y5pi0E1naa	I think Selah hit it on the head.  this verse isn't speaking about whether or not the familial relationship will still have a place in heaven.  Paul was under the impression that Jesus' return would be only a matter of months, a few years at the most, so he wanted the followers in Corinth to focus on spreading the Gospel rather than spending their time focused on their Earthly future.|`|y1KcxJ7Oaa	This verse means that heterosexuals and homosexuals should be friends.

On some<br>  things he can reply authoritatively; on others he<br>  renders a personal judgment. Verses 25–40 deal with<br>  special questions to those involved in missionary or<br>  other priesthood service requiring absence from home<br>  for prolonged periods.<br>  <br>  ‘It is clear from the Inspired Version corrections and<br>  additions that ministerial service of a missionary<br>  nature was involved, and the main questions seemed<br>  to be: Should engaged persons who are called on<br>  missions marry first, or go out on the Lord’s errand<br>  while single? And if they should serve while single,<br>  should certain ones who were already married, receive<br>  divorces prior to such service?<br>  <br>  A host of personal<br>  circumstances and situations are always involved.<br>  Ordinarily, and Paul specified this as his opinion,<br>  marriage should be deferred.” (McConkie, DNTC,<br>  2:346–47.)|`|vGWD8Zncaa	You're not twisting it any more than any others who cling to the "common" interpretation are twisting it!<br>  <br>  Whilst I wouldn't use the term "garbage", the fact is Paul sincerely believed he was living in the end times.  Well, at least that's how he wrote, even if he privately believed something else.  If you read Paul's writings, they all suggest that his generation was the final generation on Earth before the rapture.<br>  <br>  Those verses are all Paul preaching that since the world is soon to end, all people should forego all Earthly pursuits and prepare themselves for the coming of Jesus.  The problem with this notion is that if human life goes on, Paul's suggestions become a poor way to live.<br>  <br>  Sadly, many generations of Christians have latched onto these writings to become very misogynistic and sexually repressive.
zPfgFXU5aa	I don't think the Bible could absolutely prove itself but it could give evidence of a supernatural hand behind it by containing hundreds of prophecies that you could check up on to see if they came true. <br>  <br>  Unlike people like Jeanne Dixon, Nostradamus, Edgar Cayce, and others, the Bible's standard for prophecy is 100% accuracy all the time, every time.<br>  <br>  Fulfilled prophecy is strong evidence (but not absolute proof) that God is the Inspiration behind the Bible because mere men could not lucky Guess their way to so many correct predictions - many of which Were about events a thousand years or more after the predictions were written down.<br>  <br>  Another evidence of divine inspiration is found in the fact that many of the principles of modern science were recorded as facts of nature in the Bible long before scientist confirmed them experimentally. Other ancient cultures had completely Wrong views such as the Earth being flat and the Earth being Carried on the back of an Elephant in one ancient belief And on the back of a giant turtle in another, whereas In the Old Testament we are told the earth is round and Job 26:7 correctly explains that the earth is suspended in space - both those ideas would have been ridiculed and mocked In ancient times, even in The time of Christopher Columbus most people still thought the Earth was flat and they must have puzzled over the Bible insisting It was round, but Columbus proved the doubters wrong and that the Bible was in fact Correct - the Earth is round and it is suspended in Space. A lucky guess? Possible, but mathematically improbable. Evidence for the Bible? More likely than not, but not absolute proof.<br>  <br>  Another evidence is the fact that the Bible books make reference to people and places that actually existed (despite doubts raised from time to time by various scholars) and that are remarkably accurate and contain many minor details that only someone who was there at that particular time in history would have known. This strongly suggests (but does not prove) that the Bible writers knew the people and places involved and took great care to be accurate in their descriptions. Archaeology has confirmed many of those minor details, including Kings, people, places and even whole Empires that the skeptics said never existed. Archaeology has not so far found any historical discrepancies that contradict the Bible.<br>  <br>  Again that is not absolute proof of the Bible, but once more it is strong evidence of it's authenticity.<br>  <br>  So on the balance of probabilities there is more evidence for the Bible than there is against it.|`|pXWyGLfoaa	This is not an anwer.

But, the beliefs that these models are built on are not. The problem is that most scientists do not realize that it is the belief (religion) of evolution that is the basis for scientific models (the interpretations, or stories) used to attempt an explanation of the present. Evolutionists are not prepared to change their actual belief that all life can be explained by natural processes and that no God is involved (or even needed). Evolution is a religion to which they are committed.

These examples include an illegal plot to infiltrate the government, brainwashing techniques, mind control camps, attacks on critics, and DEATHS caused by Scientology doctrine and members: <br>  <br>  ● Operation Snow White – Under this official program, Scientology operatives committed infiltration, wiretapping, & theft of documents in government offices. This program constituted the single largest infiltration of the United States government in history. Among the 11 prominent Scientologists convicted of this conspiracy was Mary Sue Hubbard, the wife of Scientology’s “prophet”. <br>  <a href="http://lisatrust.freewinds.cx/scientology/snow-white/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://lisatrust.freewinds.cx/scientolog...</a> <br>  <a href="http://en.allexperts.com/e/o/op/operation_snow_white.htm" rel="nofollow">http://en.allexperts.com/e/o/op/operatio...</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.lermanet.com/reference/77Granjurypart1.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.lermanet.com/reference/77Gran...</a> <br>  <br>  ● Operation Freakout - Their campaign of sabotage & intimidation against Paulette Cooper, the writer who published her research & findings on several cults, including Scientology.

In addition, Scientology's lawyers hired private investigators to dig up any "dirt" on IRS agents which was then used to blackmail or publicly smear all "vulnerable" agents. <br>  <a href="http://legalminds.lp.findlaw.com/list/fedtax-l/msg00445.html" rel="nofollow">http://legalminds.lp.findlaw.com/list/fe...</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.lermanet.com/scientologynews/nytimes/nyt-irs-030997.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.lermanet.com/scientologynews/...</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.factnet.org/headlines/give-away.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.factnet.org/headlines/give-aw...</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Cowen/essays/irs.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Cowen/essays/...</a> <br>  <br>  ● Fair Game - the Scientology policy detailing how the organization may confront & handle critics & perceived enemies.

9449e10cc4bd54a354c906e0564176ecaa	Today's technology has certainly made it easier for us to "check up" on each other.  On top of that, many people don't realize how easy it actually is.  Lots of people will create Myspace pages, Facebook pages, blogs, etc. not realizing that those things can and often do come up when someone types their name into Google.  Anyone from a new friend to a potential employer can do a quick search on a person's name and read whatever the person has written about themselves on these types of web sites.  The Internet can be a pretty small place sometimes.  <br>  <br>  Also, I like to watch videos on Youtube, especially video blogs that people make (where they get on camera and talk about various things).  Some of those people act very obnoxious in the videos they post on Youtube (a very popular site).  I often wonder if they have ever considered the possibility that they could go to a job interview someday where the interviewer recognizes them from their Youtube videos.<br>  <br>  Edit: Okay, after I posted, I realized that I hadn't answered your question entirely.  Is it more acceptable now?  Well, if you're going to post information about yourself on the Internet, I don't think it's reasonable to get upset when people read it.  If someone is trying to hack into profiles that you have set to "private," or if someone is trying to peek in through your windows or follow you around, then that's certainly grounds for disapproval and possibly police intervention.|`|z9lpzBlbaa	Ya it's really weird<br>  I haven't asked a girl out on a date over my home phone since Nam|`|4INE794zaa	Not today's day and age, but Facebook and Myspace certainly have.

The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6.

AA11058044	It was one of Jesus' Mom's favourite stories.<br>  <br>  Every time little Jesus would bring his friends over, Mary would have to go on and on about the manger, and the wise guys, and the angels, and embarass poor little Jesus, telling everyone how Jesus was soooo special.<br>  <br>  They're just lucky they didn't have photo albums back then.  Poor Thomas would still be sitting in Mary's living room, too polite to flee Mary's slide show presentation.<br>  <br>  So everyone who ever visited the house, or was on a committee or PTA with or even just met Mary at the well was fully aware of the whole story and all the details.  So even if Mary wasn't around any more, lots of people knew the story.  Any discrepancies are due to the fact that people remembered different details of Mary's story differently.<br>  <br>  Dang, this actually sounds pretty plausible, doesn't it?|`|6173ede5e3ea0a8b44522ccd89de7fe0aa	2Pe 1:21 "For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake [as they were] moved by the Holy Ghost."<br>  <br>  The Holy Spirit told them.|`|X9rXRNUxaa	Simply because they all met and knew Jesus and His earthly family !<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  .|`|yHfsHp6naa	Because they stole it all from pagan myths.|`|wB3AbJyLaa	Some scholars say the gospels were written so far after the events that legend developed and distorted what was finally written down, turning Jesus from merely a wise teacher into the mythological Son of God. Is that a reasonable hypothesis, or is there good evidence that the gospels were recorded earlier than that, before legend could totally corrupt what was ultimately recorded? There are two separate issues here, and it is important to keep the separate. I do think there's good evidence for suggesting early dates for the writing of the gospels. But even if there wasn't, your argument crumbles. Why? The standard scholarly dating, even in very liberal circles, is Mark in the 70s, Matthew in the 80s, John in the 90s. But listen: That's still within the lifetimes of various eyewitnesses of the life of Jesus, including hostile eyewitnesses who would have served as a corrective if flase teachings about Jesus were going around. Consequently, these late dates for the gospels really aren't all that late. In fact, we can make a comparison that's very instructive. The two earliest biographies of Alexander the Great were written by Arrian and Plutarch more than four hundred after Alexander's death in 323 B.C., yet historians consider them to be generally trustworthy. Yes, legendary material about Alexander did develop over time, but it was only in the centuries after these two writers. In other words, the first five hundred years kept Alexander's story pretty much intact; legendary material began to emerge over the next five hundred years. So whether the gospels were written sixty years or thirty years after the life of Jesus, the amount of time is negligible by comparison. It's almost irrelevant. Let's get back to the dating of the the gospel. I indicated that I believed they were written sooner than the dates mentioned. And we can support that by looking at the book of Acts, which was written by Luke. Acts ends up apparently unfinished, Paul is a central figure of the book, and he's under house arrest in Rome. With that the book abruptly halts. What happens to Paul? We don't find out from Acts, probably because the book was written before Paul was put to death. That means Acts cannot be dated any later than A.D. 62. Having established that, we can the move backward from there. Since Acts is the second of a two-part work, we know the first part, the gospels of Luke, must have been written earlier than that. And since Luke incorporates parts of the gospels of Mark, that means Mark is even earlier. If you allow maybe a year for each of those, you end up with Mark no later than about A.D. 60, maybe even the late 50s. If Jesus was put to death in A.D. 33, we're talking about a maximum gap of thirty years or so. Historically speaking, especially compared with Alexander the Great, that's like a news flash!|`|4bc5b87ed73962c0f8d5a68384af5d86aa	Wfestrock has the correct answer,,,the Gospel of James was written around 39-40 A.D. and the others were written no more than 69-70 A.D. according to the acclaimed historian William Albright...the earliest being 7-8 years after Jesus' ascension and certainly within a time frame for any witnesses to come forth and expose it as false if it were. The other Gospels as well were written within the lifespans of any who could deny them which is shown by the growth of the early church....it could not have survived and flourished to the point where people would willingly risk their lives if it were false. The Jewish Pharisees and Scribes who hated Jesus could have exposed them as lies...they didn't. and couldn't. Jesus showed himself to many people over the course of 40 days before His ascension (Acts 1:3)...it was not a one-time fluke. There are other passages which refer to the fact that what was written in the Gospel of Luke...including Jesus birth... was carefully examined and testified to by Luke who was a physician and a historian of the highest order according to scholars. These are not merely oral accounts which could have changed over a period of years, decades or centuries as many claim but were eye-witness testimony from people who lived at the time. Even in a court of law, a person is given the benefit of the doubt if they are a credible witness. <br>  <br>  Acts 2:22<br>  Acts 2:32<br>  Acts 3:15<br>  Acts 4:19<br>  Acts 4:33<br>  Acts 10:38<br>  Gal 1:20<br>  <br>  All show that these events were witnessesd.<br>  <br>  1 John 1That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked at and our hands have touched—this we proclaim concerning the Word of life. 2The life appeared; we have seen it and testify to it, and we proclaim to you the eternal life, which was with the Father and has appeared to us. 3We proclaim to you what we have seen and heard, so that you also may have fellowship with us.

I would guess Luke interviewed Mary or one or more of her sons. Luke probably came from Asia Minor, since in Acts he joins Paul there. John according to reliable tradition went to Ephesus, and according to tradition went with Mary, who Jesus entrusted John to look after according to one of the gospels. As we see from Paul's journeys people often travelled around the coast (and Luke accompanied Paul at times) so it would not be such a hard thing for him to seek out Mary. And Jesus' brother James was one of the leaders of the Jerusalem church for many years. His other brothers were also involved in the early church.<br>  <br>  Matthew concentrates on the male side of things, so I would guess he interviewed one or more of the sons, and found out about what happened from them; he was focussing on Joseph's role. Joseph probably died sometime during the ministry of Jesus.<br>  <br>  It may well be that Luke wanted to fill in for the female side of things, that Matthew had neglected. One sees from the start of Luke that he was aware of other accounts; not necessarily all of course, but he may have noticed that Mary's side of the story hadn't been put across. Luke is also concerned to tie the account into historical details at times. He was Greeks-speaking and as a doctor probably quite cultured, so would have read Latin and/or Greek histories if he was lucky enough.<br>  <br>  There were also many believers who knew what happened, and would frequently discuss such things - so pharisees in the sanhedrim, people in Herod's court, people from Bethlehem and Nazareth who knew bits and pieces would add their knowledge in. You have to decide for yourself how accurate the accounts are.

Evangelists in those days didn't run about passing out bibles or setting up "tent revivals" and preaching from the bible to an audience who had already heard and/or read what the bible contains.  Early preachers learned the teachings of Jesus from the word of mouth and spread them from memory.  Later evangelists probably learned from the bible - perhaps from listening to a reader, since it wasn't possible for every evangelist to have his own - and then spreading that message abroad - again, orally.

I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16 tells us that the Bible was "breathed out" by God.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1: 11-12 tells us that the gospel was a revelation from Jesus Christ himself, which was recorded by Jesus disciples and Paul.<br>  <br>  God himself chose the disciples and the people whom He knew were going to spread His word and write the Bible.<br>  <br>  The Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 4000 years. Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors. The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvation—Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?<br>  <br>  Pasting a small part from the website.<br>  Visit the website to strengthen your faith in Jesus or to know more about Him.<br>  <br>  Jesus is God.<br>  <br>  1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus<br>  specifically.)<br>  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8<br>  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became<br>  flesh (John 1:1-14)<br>  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm<br>  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh<br>  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to<br>  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.<br>  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)<br>  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)<br>  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)<br>  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)<br>  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)<br>  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)<br>  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)<br>  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)<br>  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)<br>  16. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6) and "God" also be called the Mighty God in Isaiah 10:21<br>  17. Jesus is able to raise Himself from the dead (John 2:19-21)<br>  18. Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)<br>  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)<br>  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;<br>  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship<br>  is used in each place.)<br>  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John 8:58.<br>  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see<br>  Exodus 3:14.<br>  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).<br>  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).<br>  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).<br>  26. Jesus is the One who will judge you on judgement day (John 5:22-23). Only God can be the judge.<br>  27. Jesus forgives sins (Luke 5:20) (Luke 24:47,Acts 10:43) .Only God can forgive sins.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a>|`|ki0tOVUYaa	I don't know: the Bible was so very dear to me at one time and I don't know if I would have developed the intelligence I have today had I not began thinking critically and analyzing ideas like I did at that time.

So yada yada, he jumps and starts grinding the rail and comes up to the piece of metal and his foot go caught and it like, completely destroyed his leg.

I was so shocked (and barely 20 years old at the time) that it scared me half to death. I jumped in my car and raced toward home and the fool followed me, so I drove straight to the police department. Needless to say, he drove right by and got back on the highway.........That shook me up pretty bad, but when I think about if something like that were to happen today (it's been over 30 years), I would probably hit the jerk with my purse or something....I dunno...creeps!|`|9hGKMt8jaa	One time when I was meditating, I was listening to a cd with native american drum music, I felt a very negative presence enter my space.

In this experience, my husband and I were lying in bed, and I looked over at my sleeping husband to see a demon jumping up and down on his chest. I tried to reach above my head to grab my Bible and hit it, but I was paralyzed.  I tried to say the Lord's prayer, but couldn't speak.  Finally I thought the name of Jesus, and eventually got to where I could call the name of Jesus, and then the demon went away.<br>  <br>  In the morning, I was sure it was just a nightmare combined with sleep paralysis.  But then a few days later, my husband woke me up around 5am saying he needed to go to the ER.  he had been awake most of the night with chest pains that were getting worse.  We went to the ER, and they did a complete workup but found nothing.  He saw all types of specialists, but they never found anything.  He had chest pains like that for a little over a year before they stopped coming.<br>  <br>  I eventually told him about the "dream."  he told me never to dream that again (yeah, like I have a choice!).<br>  <br>  Just weird.|`|UIEC5lOzaa	My older brother ate his twin.|`|aKXD4weqaa	I was flippin channels the other day, and I stopped on this show like ER stories or whatever and this girl swallowed a fork and they made the new doctor on his first day try and get it out of her throat and UUUGH!!!

vDr5aROwaa	I am a Christian. To me a cult is a religious group that controls your life. I don't let anyone control my life but Jesus Christ. I don't care what a church might want me to do, if I don't feel that it is Christ that wants me to do it, I won't do it. He gives us common sense. All these religious groups that are following a leader and going and killing themselves because this is what this leader is telling them to do, I think they are crazy. God is not going to tell you to do something like that and if he did, and you went to do, trust me, he would stop you before you did it.|`|a1Iv39BLaa	In all ways, sweetie. True spirituality is found within, not without.|`|FarsCSY1aa	All religions are cults, some are just really big ones.|`|AA10696542	Yes. Look what they do.|`|cfusEJPFaa	The classic signs of a cult are below.  All religions have one or two of these, but that does not make them a cult.  The ones advocating a change in the member's social life are the ones to be the most wary of.<br>  <br>  Note: Islam has all of these.<br>  <br>  The following is a description of what cult is:   <br>  <br>  1. A cult is a religious group with extreme beliefs and practices - beliefs that are often contrary to science and logic but they are believed as "obvious" truth by the cult members.  <br>  <br>  2. The members of cults often isolate themselves from friends, family and society and use deceptive and unethical recruiting techniques <br>  <br>  3. Use manipulative methods to control the minds of followers<br>   <br>  4. Venerate a human leader or leaders <br>  <br>  5. Recruiting work is performed by all of the members <br>  <br>  6. People are not allowed to criticize the leader, the doctrine, or the organization, or read information that is critical of the cult. <br>  <br>  7. Members are trained to reject and disbelieve criticism of the cult as lies from Satan. <br>  <br>  8. Members spy on one another and report improper activities or comments to leaders. <br>  <br>  9. Members are taught to suppress anything which might reflect negatively to outsiders about the cult. <br>  <br>  10. The doctrine is absolutist and the ideology is internalized as "the Truth."<br>   <br>  11. Members are told to avoid contact with ex-members or critics, even their relatives. <br>  <br>  12. Members are instilled with a deep fear about ever leaving the organization, and anyone who does depart is of the devil and sometimes severely punished. <br>  <br>  13. Members are emotional controlled and warned of being caught and punished. <br>  <br>  14. Disciplinary action is administered by group leaders, which may involve excommunication for such things as questioning organization policy or doctrine.<br>   <br>  15. People are encouraged to sacrifice education, career and family interests to server the interests of the cult. <br>  <br>  16. Advocate socializing only with other members in the organization and avoiding outsiders. <br>  <br>  17. The belief in apocalypse and Dooms Day.|`|jCOSuUxEaa	When they were formed, they were a cult.|`|tuOe65Pcaa	It depends on perspective.|`|4XAxt6gsaa	in all ways|`|2a4d789e79905682ca1062ac58e33a6aaa	I think all religion are cults.

If you believe in God, and you're wrong, and there isnt anything after this life, what do you lose?  On the other hand, if you dont believe in God, and you're wrong, you've lost out on a lot.  <br>  <br>  I dont know what "moderately" religious means, because you either are or youre not... being religious doesnt mean you have to be pushy and preachy all the time.<br>  <br>  As far as church goes, try some different ones.

Religion is steadfastly against abortion, so byproducts of it are a sin as well.<br>  <br>  You can also extract stem cells from umbilical cords when children are born, and use them to treat that child when they become adults. So why fight that?<br>  <br>  In Catholicism, the reason the church is against birth control is that life and death is exclusively the purview God. Birth control, Invitro-fertilization, and cloning are all issues that the church believes encroach upon God's exclusive ability to deal with the life and death of human beings.<br>  <br>  Personally, it seems like a slippery slope. If man isn't allowed to interfere in matters of life and death, then modern medicine is a sin. Where does one draw the line?<br>  <br>  In any case, that is the religious argument against stem cells.|`|y1KcxJ7Oaa	God cloned Eve from the DNA in Adam's rib then commanded that they have sex and have many children. So I think that God is cool with cloning and stem cell research.  How do you think God got the virgin mary pregnant?  Artificial insemination, baby!  Science and God are intertwined.  <br>  <br>  God's kingdom is not of this earth, and we know that anything not of this earth is extraterrestrial, so God's an alien and the New Jerusalem is his space station.  Wow this is all too loony.  I think I'll stay in my ignorant bliss and believe like a true blind follower that science does not exist and God is the creator of everything. So to answer you question: No Christians can't accept stem cell research or cloning cause its an abomination.  Amen.|`|ZH58ckgjaa	Since it sacrifices an unborn embryo, I can see why Christians are against it.<br>  <br>  Actually, adult stems cells taken from bone marrow have also been successful in growing cardiac and smooth muscle tissue.

This does include many Christian groups, but not all Christians. Most stem cells come from Aborted Fetus. Now if you are pro-life then you believe this to be Murder.

When scientist do this playing God they have the power to create human life that is scientifically done thru cells to help people live longer or clone.

AA11232725	I hope that more Americans will realize that God has blessed this nation and any nation that starts to think that all that they have comes from their own goodness needs to rethink that idea and see what God their Creator might have to say about it.<br>  <br>  Jeremiah 18:7  The instant I speak concerning a nation and concerning a kingdom, to pluck up, to pull down, and to destroy it,  8  if that nation against whom I have spoken turns from its evil, I will relent of the disaster that I thought to bring upon it.  9  And the instant I speak concerning a nation and concerning a kingdom, to build and to plant it,  10  if it does evil in My sight so that it does not obey My voice, then I will relent concerning the good with which I said I would benefit it.<br>  <br>  Should the rest of the world be concerned? Yes, they should. They should hope that America will return to it's position as a light in this world that acknowledges the living God of Heaven and sets an example for other peoples to follow.|`|4INE794zaa	No. More and more Americans will become Canadians.|`|RermzbWgaa	No, I do not think so.  Much of Christianity in America today is obsessed with financial prosperity.  Many churches are nothing more than positive thinking centers with their yelling, jumping, crazed gurus.  No economy....no positives to ride....no followers.<br>  <br>  I am not sure one can really say that the majority of Christianity in America today is Christian, or that it will hold up much at all to real troubles.  (That is not to say that real Christianity does not exist however....it certainly does).  Troubles will likely bring declining church numbers rather than the opposite.<br>  <br>  I would say this....the more America turns AWAY from Christianity and those roots....the more the world should be concerned.

Zz1HI5VHaa	I think that racism is a very touchy subject. As a white person it is easy for us to look at the flip side of the coin. The reason the cartton was and is considered racist is because they used a monkey, which is a term that people have historically used in a racist fashion to insult the black community. The second insult was to imply that the dead monkey had been shot.. that eludes to shooting the presidet, THE FIRST BLACK PRESIDENT, while joking about offing any president is politically incorrect it is made worse by his ethnic background.<br>  <br>  I think you know the answer to your next question. While it is true that someday in the future caucasion people will probably be the minority that is not the current situation. And very rarely does a white person not get a job do to the color of their skin. <br>  <br>  Racisim is alive and well no matter where you live in our country. I happen to live in a very diverse community, (I live just outside Washington DC) and have the opportunity to see these things around me. While I am white and have not had to live with such prejudice I am able to put myself in other ethnic shoes so to speak. <br>  <br>  Yes sometimes I feel that we can take political correctness to far and I have worked with some black people who were a little over sensative at times. Think about it this way.. why are some people so sensative about the issue. they didn't just wake up one day and say I am going to be a pain in your butt. Society has shown them that while some (maybe even the majority) of the massess are able to look past the color of someones skin to make an assessment of their character, the rest of the massess attack on a regular basis...<br>  <br>  Bottom line the cartoon was wrong on many levels. i wouldn't have liked it if the monkey represented G. W. Bush and I never voted for him and personally think that he wasn't very good at his job. While it may be unconstitutional to restrict people from making jokes the constitution does not say I have to like their jokes nor do I have to look at them or listen to them.. it crossed a line. The paper apologized lets move on.|`|t3Zuec0taa	Some people just want more publicity, regardless of how they get it...right, Al Sharpton?

I cannot accept that premise.  If there really is no God, humans basic selfish nature would eventually devolve into anarchy.  You may not know it but the civility we experience today is a blessing from God.  The "civilized" Greeks of old use to cast their infants to the rocks of they weren't deemed suitable and men routinely took young boys for lovers.  It was from the Christian influence that we enjoy true civility today.  Like a tree gradually withers when separated from the root, since God has been taken out of our consciousness, we are gradually moving back toward the pagan morality.  People don't understand how much of our culture is due to the Judeo-Christian influence.  People always want to focus on the negative aspect of it instead.  I say, if there is no truth in it, why would it make society work better?  If there is no God, and we were finally completely divorced from the effects of God consciousness, we would all just eat, drink, and be merry.  To seek as much pleasure as possible would be the goal of men before that great dark, endless night.|`|0yTM98Odaa	Where people concentrated on this life not the next and concentrate on looking after ppl, and one where there are no scare tactics involved.

I've been wearing the hijab for about one year and  6 months. I may not have enough experience but I will tell you my thoughts.So far, people don't really judge me by how I look but by looking at my personality first. I've never ever got such a respect in my whole life. I feel more confident and focused at my work. Trust me you get to make lot of friends because people will come up to you and ask you why you wear it. And that's how easily you can become a friend with someone who's very interested enough to know and understand. And forget the ones who will judge you, they're not the ones who is going to decide if your going to paradise or not.  And yes I did get some bad looks but I had to endure it and believe in myself that whatever I'm doing it's only for Allah.It's between you and your lord. Stand up for Islam and show how wonderful this religion is and show all the people how a true muslim is supposed to act.<br>  The culture will accept it for sure. It won't really matter if your culture  except you or not but you should remember that you are trying to please Allah(swt) only.  Just go for it and wear the hijab and one day you'll realize and say to yourself that you did the right thing. Inshallah Allah will help you to endure these obstacles if problems comes in the way.|`|Czl7BGV7aa	I wear hijab in America. I can tell you that at first it was hard. I'm a revert, born and raised here, so I knew that people were reacting differently once I started covering. Alhamdulilah, it doesn't bother me anymore. I stopped looking to see if they were looking. :) Also, in the cities (I used to live in the Chicago area), people don't think anything of it. They are used to it. You get more of the "looks" when you are out in the "boondocks" (like where I am now!)<br>  InshAllah, it is possible that the attitude will change. And we hijabis can work to help that. Be friendly, give a kind smile. Show them that Muslims are nice, too! :)|`|1ICX0JlAaa	Asalaamu alaikum,<br>  I am a revert of almost 6 years alhumdlillah and i wear full hijab *hijab with niqab* and at first it was a total culture shock for some people including my family but after awhile no one noticed. I ride the bus here where i live *until my hubby fixes my car insha'allah* and I get more stares from muslims than i do from non muslims lol. i think they dont understand why i cover as much as i do but i even have had non muslims start conversations with me, say hello and be nice! so yes i think it is very possible to wear hijab in america and the west, but we should be proud of our hijabs and wear it ONLY FOR THE SAKE OF ALLAH because only Allah will reward us for our obedience.|`|4SWKTNUIaa	I live in NYC, and many Muslim women wear hijabs.

It was agreed, not unanimously, by men in a council. The word of God is inspired and no one should make it say anything that it doesn't say through God's inspiration.<br>  <br>  There is a verse in the KJV which is not in other versions stating the idea of the trinity. This was inserted by an Italian scholar, I believe, "Of low esteem". Or words to that effect. This is the actual verse:<br>  <br>  1 John 5<br>  7 For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one. <br>  <br>  This is thought to be totally erroneous and is not in modern versions.<br>  <br>  Egyptian pharoahs worshipped some triune god so it probably is an amalgum of ideas.|`|LjsRfaskaa	It's the same law of physics.

Some interpret references to Shekhinah, Wisdom or the Angel of the Lord as meaning the Holy Spirit.

Says who? Says you?<br>  <br>  The Old Testament says an eye for an eye. The New Testament the exact opposite.

Show some respect.|`|AypSdbwzaa	When God said, "Let us make man man in our image, after our likeness," (Genesis 1:27) it is indeed an indication of more than one entity.  But, if you look in the epistles, you notice in the salutations that all but one mention giving greetings from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.  (III John gives no salutation at all.)  No mention is made of the Holy Ghost.<br>  <br>  Additionally, God spoke thru the Ark of the Covenant and the Ark had two cherubims on it (Exodus 25:18).  There are old and new testaments of the bible, one part to learn about the Father and one part to learn about the Son.  Christ himself said, "I and my Father are one."  (John 10:30)  No mention of the Holy Ghost there either.<br>  <br>  I don't believe in a trinity - the word is not in the bible.|`|rWP4suXuaa	The whole bible is a continued revelation for Genesis to revelations, The old testament may have some hints to it..but the new testament fully reveal it. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The most difficult thing about the Christian concept of the Trinity is that there is no way to adequately explain it. The Trinity is a concept that is impossible for any human being to fully understand, let alone explain. God is infinitely greater than we are, therefore we should not expect to be able to fully understand Him. The Bible teaches that the Father is God, that Jesus is God, and that the Holy Spirit is God. The Bible also teaches that there is only one God. Though we can understand some facts about the relationship of the different persons of the Trinity to one another, ultimately, it is incomprehensible to the human mind. However, this does not mean it is not true or not based on the teachings of the Bible.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind when studying this subject that the word "Trinity" is not used in Scripture. This is a term that is used to attempt to describe the triune God, the fact that there are three coexistent, co-eternal persons that make up God. Understand that this is NOT in any way suggesting three Gods. The Trinity is one God made up of three persons. There is nothing wrong with using the term "Trinity" even though the word is not found in the Bible. It is shorter to say the word "Trinity" than to say "three coexistent, co-eternal persons making up one God." If this presents a problem to you, consider this: the word grandfather is not used in the Bible either. Yet, we know there were grandfathers in the Bible. Abraham was the grandfather of Jacob. What should be of real importance is that the concept that is represented by the word "Trinity" does exist in Scripture. With the introduction out of the way, Bible verses will be given in discussion of the Trinity.<br>  <br>  1) There is one God: Deuteronomy 6:4; 1 Corinthians 8:4; Galatians 3:20; 1 Timothy 2:5.<br>  <br>  2) The Trinity consists of three Persons: Genesis 1:1; 1:26; 3:22; 11:7; Isaiah 6:8; 48:16; 61:1; Matthew 3:16-17; Matt 28:19; 2 Corinthians 13:14. In the passages in the Old Testament, a knowledge of Hebrew is helpful. In Genesis 1:1, the plural noun "Elohim" is used. In Genesis 1:26; 3:22; 11:7 and Isaiah 6:8, the plural pronoun for "us" is used. That "Elohim" and "us" refer to more than two is without question. In English, we only have two forms, singular and plural. In Hebrew, you have three forms: singular, dual, and plural. Dual is for two ONLY. In Hebrew, the dual form is used for things that come in pairs like eyes, ears, and hands. The word "Elohim" and the pronoun "us" are plural forms—definitely more than two—and must be referring to three or more, in this case Father, Son, Holy Spirit.<br>  <br>  In Isaiah 48:16 and 61:1, the Son is speaking while making reference to the Father and the Holy Spirit. Compare Isaiah 61:1 to Luke 4:14-19 to see that it is the Son speaking. Matthew 3:16-17 describes the event of Jesus' baptism. Seen in this is God the Holy Spirit descending on God the Son while God the Father proclaims His pleasure in the Son. Matthew 28:19 and 2 Corinthians 13:14 are examples of three distinct persons in the Trinity.<br>  <br>  3) The members of the Trinity are distinguished one from another in various passages: In the Old Testament, "LORD" is distinguished from "Lord" (Genesis 19:24; Hosea 1:4). The LORD has a Son (Psalm 2:7, 12; Proverbs 30:2-4). Spirit is distinguished from the “LORD” (Numbers 27:18) and from "God" (Psalm 51:10-12). God the Son is distinguished from God the Father (Psalm 45:6-7; Hebrews 1:8-9). In the New Testament John 14:16-17, Jesus speaks to the Father about sending a Helper, the Holy Spirit. This shows that Jesus did not consider Himself to be the Father or the Holy Spirit. Consider also all of the other times in the Gospels where Jesus speaks to the Father. Was He speaking to Himself? No. He spoke to another person in the Trinity—the Father.<br>  <br>  4) Each member of the Trinity is God: The Father is God: John 6:27; Romans 1:7; 1 Peter 1:2. The Son is God: John 1:1, 14; Romans 9:5; Colossians 2:9; Hebrews 1:8; 1 John 5:20. The Holy Spirit is God: Acts 5:3-4; 1 Corinthians 3:16. (The One who indwells is the Holy Spirit - Romans 8:9; John 14:16-17; Acts 2:1-4).<br>  <br>  5) The subordination within the Trinity: Scripture shows that the Holy Spirit is subordinate to the Father and the Son, and the Son is subordinate to the Father. This is an internal relationship and does not deny the deity of any person of the Trinity. This is simply an area which our finite minds cannot understand concerning the infinite God. Concerning the Son see: Luke 22:42; John 5:36; John 20:21; 1 John 4:14. Concerning the Holy Spirit see: John 14:16; 14:26; 15:26; 16:7 and especially John 16:13-14.<br>  <br>  6) The tasks of the individual members of the Trinity: The Father is the ultimate source or cause of the universe (1 Corinthians 8:6; Revelation 4:11); divine revelation (Revelation 1:1); salvation|`|DDYIrSKOaa	Genesis 1:1<br>  <br>  Let US make man in OUR image....|`|VncSMLMpaa	Yes, absolutely right.

The apostate church also will arise - those that will make a choice to pick and choose which portionsof God's word they would follow, and twist scripture to fit their fleshly desire.<br>  <br>  2 Thessalonians 2<br>  3Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition; <br>  <br>  1 Timothy 4<br>  1The Spirit clearly says that in later times some will abandon the faith and follow deceiving spirits and things taught by demons. 2Such teachings come through hypocritical liars, whose consciences have been seared as with a hot iron. 3They forbid people to marry and order them to abstain from certain foods, which God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and who know the truth. 4For everything God created is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving, 5because it is consecrated by the word of God and prayer. <br>  <br>  <br>  For those who think this is exclusively the Catholic Church, think again.  It is NOT limited to a particular denomination, there are many other denominations who have strayed from God's word.  <br>  <br>  The APOSTATE CHURCH will be those, individuals, who turn from Christ Jesus for salvation - such as it is with even New Age and many paths to God.  There will be those saved in all denominations, and those not saved in all denominations.  Those who stick to Christ Jesus and his word will be saved, those who turn and abandon the fiath, will not be saved.  BTW - I know many Catholics who love the Lord Jesus with all of their hearts - I am certain are saved.  So, they are not exclusive, but they are not excluded - the CHURCH is made up of those that follow Christ Jesus, Jesus is the head.   It is not limited by denominational labels, it is limited by the true heartof each.<br>  <br>  <br>  Regarding OT killings, if you understood scripture, you would understand why these things happened.

If there was too much of somethings,too much form then God would not have space to create anything. You see you move into an apartment and if it already had things in it you could not have room to move in your stuff.God in his infinite wisdom being infinite was nothing that was something more real than the somethings & images & forms that inhabit our minds.God was the Mother of the universe,the womb of nothing,that made possible the somethings we so cherish. God Being nothing cannot be displaced as things can.Nothing does not age,or crubble or rust or die.The wisdom of Nothing exceeds all expectation for it is the womb of what is carried.<br>  This is why the Spiritual Force is not a thing or a place or an ego centric Being. God pervades all things and inhabits all things but is not possessive of any things and is why we are granted free choice and will.To conclude to say God is nothing is not derogatory for when i speak of nothing i say it is something,basically something we cannot describe for the God form is absent of form ,so how can we describe the invisible God as something? We don't understand God because we cannot understand the Holy Spirit and because we are made in the image of God we too are nothing that is something and we can't for the life of us,understand how we can be nothing because mentally we are prisioners of form and unless we embrace faith ,hope & love we shall forever remain in body and its misery and endless death.God is Love,like the womb that creates love which is our hope ,our faith in the doing and the Love which we create.|`|V63jOkvsaa	oh I keep creating different worlds and then destroy them when I get bored...sometimes I take a couple year vacation in between to watch my shows, and I always do it freehand, sometimes my friend helps too. sometimes we have competitions, it's great fun....oh by the way I don't appreciate being called a he.|`|3xlDwlkhaa	God is not a 'He' or a 'She'.<br>  There is also no 'outside' of God nor any extent to God because God does not exist as we know existence.

You just need to be yourself and also be open with conversation when she talks to you.  Be honest and gentle with her, and maybe treat her to a meal now and then.   Candies and flowers are a plus to give her the message that you like her!  Good luck.|`|hu6Wj5IQaa	Steps<br>  1. Before knowing how to act in front of that special girl, you need to make sure that: <br>  o You have a good reputation.<br>  o You have good hygiene.<br>  o And that you truly like this girl.<br>  2. Always be yourself. Don't be someone you're not, girls always appreciate it when you're honest with them about who you are.<br>  3. Don't try to impress the girl around your friends. You're going to end up looking ridiculous if you think messing around with your friends is attractive to a girl.<br>  4. Treat her with respect. Don't talk trash about other people while you're with her. If you do, it will give her the impression that you are a jerk.<br>  5. Flirt with her. Give her a little push here and there and make her notice that you're always there.<br>  6. To get an idea of how you should act in front of the girl you like, it sometimes depends on how close you are to her. There are differant positions, such as: <br>  o Boyfriend- Act natural, be yourself. You've got the girl, she likes you for who you are.<br>  o Best Friend- Knowing how to act if you are in this position will be difficult. Because she likes you only as friend and nothing more there isn't too much you can do to get her. But one things guys try in this situation (if they are going to ask her out) is to wait till shes free and then ask her to go out with you. Never forget to tell her how much you like(d)her. Remember, she may say no just because she honestly likes you as a friend. So if it happens, don't take it so hard, just try to stay friends and ask again when the time is right.<br>  o Acquaintance- Well, don't let her know that you like her right away. Take your time(unless you're really desperate or out of time.)get to know her and become friends. Then make your move.<br>  o Complete Stranger- Fortunately and unfortunately, this is the easiest and hardest position to start off with. Find something you're good at and do it at a talent show or some place to get your reputation up. Introduce yourself at the right time and start off with easy conversations. When you become friends, become close, but NEVER a best friend. She will think of you as something of a brother than a guy. Go slow, bide your time and have fun with her and maker her feel comfortable.<br>  7. Remember that if she ever gets the wrong idea or feels that you are doing too much. Then back off, play it cool, and later(only if it is serious)apologize.<br>  8. Take a look at her occasionally, if she is looking at you don't forget to smile and look if she smiles back. That's a good sign<br>  9. Be Her Friend and then once friend take it flirtng and if she flirts back keep flirting for a few weeks then tell her you like her.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Tips<br>  ? Don't over do it on the flirting part. Flirt too much and she'll end up thinking your annoying. Flirt too little and she'll end up thinking you just want to remain friends.<br>  ? Compliment her. Tell her something that is original and true. Never overdo compliments however. Girls will grow tired of it and if it is continued for long enough, she will know for sure that you like her.<br>  ? Try not to be with her every second of the day. Have a life, be cool, Be with your friends, but never make it seem like you are ignoring her.<br>  ? Remember, BE KIND TO ALL. This will not only help your reputation, but allow you to make new friends that might know things about her.<br>  ? Learn at least a little girl body language. It helps to know when she is hurting so that you can comfort her or when shes angry so that you can run away.<br>  ? Make her as comfortable as possible when shes with you. Be nice and open.<br>  ? Smiling is always thumbs up.<br>  ? It's a very good thing to be funny. That's a common favorite quality among people. You can joke lightly, or go ahead and be a riot. Just be sure you're not taking anything to far. Don't tell gross or offensive jokes (i.e. bathroom jokes, gossipy stuff).<br>  Warnings<br>  ? Never ever ever pick your nose whether or not you think anyone is looking.<br>  ? Be wary of over use of sarcasm. Many girls take jokes the wrong way.<br>  ? Do not ever ask your friend to ask her out for you (if you are at that point) most girls take this as a lack of courage or that you are not serious.<br>  ? NEVER for the love of God follow her around. This will give her an impression that you are a stalker and a weirdo.<br>  ? Most people say that when you want a girl make her jealous. A lot of times girls see this as sign that she has no chance. Saying how "hot" another girl is to her will only hurt her feelings, whether she wants to go out with you or not.<br>  ? Avoid being picked on as much as possible! It doesn't mix well when you're dating and getting bullied at the same time. Become respected and/or popular. AND BE NICE!! No one likes a jerk (unless they are one). If you are being picked on, resolve your bullying issues with someone, and then move onto this wben you are 100% sure that the coast is clear.<br>  ? Make sure your sense of humor is not perverted. this is a big "No No". Girls do not like guys that are gross like|`|gWlcDZJ6aa	Kidnap her, tie her up to a chair, and threaten to do bad things unless she likes you STAT.<br>  <br>  You can't "make" anyone do anything.

To answer my queries I frequently go back to, "What did stone age man do?" For example, should women stay at home to raise their kids or go out to work? Stone age women stayed around the cave and were very successful at it while men went out to hunt. of course times have changed but is it possible our basic make up hasn't? men dont' hunt anymore but go out to earn the bread. Women still like to form groups outside the cave and talk and help each other. <br>  To answer your question, I think we are supposed to pair off in order to give our children the best life, so maybe we are looking at 20 years or so. Of course stone age man only lived until about 30 years of age so monogamy was maybe easier.<br>  I believe we need to do what works best in the society we live in at the time we live in it, and that would involve stable partnerships for life.<br>  I am in no way advocating staying in an unhappy relationship, even for "the sake of the kids" I'm only stating the ideal scenario.

Something you don't seem to have...|`|bVHnNqzBaa	DRINK: Do you ever search for answers to your question before asking?<br>  <br>  Atheists such as myself realize that every situation is unique and requires a response suitable for that particular situation. We are not blindly rigid in our beliefs or actions.<br>  <br>  Morals come from socio-culturing, parents, peers, and life experience.<br>  <br>  Many Christians claim that only those who believe can live a moral life and those who do not believe in god have no moral compass. That implies that one lives a moral life, not because it is the right thing to do, but because god expects us to be moral. Again, the fallacy with this reasoning is that mitzvahs and morals should be followed because god or a holy book dictates rules to us and not for personal philosophical or spiritual reasons.<br>  <br>  Whose morals are based upon a stronger footing?<br>  <br>  ATHEISTS - who have an intrinsic sense of positive and negative behaviors and actions, understanding that each situation is unique and calls for flexible rules and reasoning. Atheists possess an internal compass – call it a golden compass -- to help guide them toward positive and negative outcomes. Atheists possess great courage by taking a stand on something they comprehend, not some set of rules blindly followed.<br>  <br>  BELIEVERS - who would have no sense of morality in absence of god or bible. Believers whose only sense of morality comes from an external source yet possess no internal compass to guide them through life. Believers who have to constantly ask, "What would Jesus do" because they are completely devoid of internal sense making or judgment. Believers only have a book to point to for their beliefs.<br>  <br>  From responses I've seen in R&S, some Christians are jealous of us, believing we atheists are getting away with something. That we get to live a life without morals and then don't have to suffer the consequences. Not sure by what irrational logic they arrive at that conclusion. As an atheist I am moral, kind, and selfless because it is the right way to live. I have no expectation of any reward for proper living. Wouldn't a true Christian be good in absence of salvation, or are they only good to be saved?|`|wM7pprr1aa	You ask, without someone to tell us or show us what is right and what is wrong, how could we possibly know? It turns out that "right and wrong", "good and bad", are concepts that are very simple to explain. In fact, they are nothing more than applied common sense. Let's look at why this is the case.<br>  <br>  Out of necessity, humans have developed as social beings. In order for us to survive and prosper, humans are forced to work together as a group, a community, a society. This has always been the case. (It makes no difference whether you believe in the 6-day creation story in Genesis, or if you are an ardent supporter of evolution. These statements are true in either case.)<br>  <br>  Imagine back to early humans living in caves or tents. Even in the simplest, most primitive culture, no human could ever survive on his or her own. Someone has to take care of the young, someone has to provide shelter, make clothes, get the food, provide protection from predators, etc. This is next to impossible for an individual to do. It becomes significantly easier if humans come together and share these tasks. When humans come together in a spirit of cooperation, we call that a community, or in a larger group, a society.<br>  <br>  When people do things that further the advancement of the society, or things that add to the general well-being of the group, those things are considered "good".<br>  <br>  But if someone goes rogue and starts to do things that harm other members of the group, this is considered "bad". Such a person will quickly find himself banished from the group (or worse). No one wants a person around who is adversely affecting other members of the group, either by harming them physically, or by stealing from them, or through other negative actions, because this impacts the ability of the entire group to survive.<br>  <br>  So to recap… "Good" things are those which help (or at least don't hurt) others in the society, and "Bad" things are those which hinder or hurt others in the society. Simple common sense. No god required.

Please note that our country is ruled according to something other than that which Allaah revealed? <br>  <br>  They replied: <br>  <br>  ? It is not permissible for a Muslim to nominate himself in the hope that he can become part of a system which rules according to something other than that which Allaah has revealed and operates according to something other than the sharee’ah of Islaam. <br>  <br>  It is not permissible for a Muslim to vote for him or for anyone else who will work in that government, unless the one who nominates himself or those who vote for him hope that by getting involved in that they will be able to change the system to one that operates according to the sharee’ah of Islaam, and they are using this as a means to overcome the system of government, provided that the one who nominates himself will not accept any position after being elected except one that does not go against Islamic sharee’ah. <br>  <br>  Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz, Shaykh ‘Abd al-Razzaaq ‘Afeefi, Shaykh ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Ghadyaan, Shaykh ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Qa’ood. <br>  <br>  [Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah (23/406, 407)]<br>  ______________________________________...|`|q9C46Wuqaa	No, not haram.<br>  You have the right to participate in an election.<br>  It would suck to not be able to vote and some selfish arrogant president gets elected.|`|qPSkkPqwaa	<a href="http://askimam.org/fatwa/fatwa.php?askid=8d2e69e86a552cf77ee9856944cc639e" rel="nofollow">http://askimam.org/fatwa/fatwa.php?askid...</a><br>  <br>  Answer by a Mufti|`|n49i9t6paa	your friends are dumasses|`|nsbWaiW0aa	i don't think so. one of my aunt and uncles think that it is cause you're voting for a nonmuslim, but i think that voting also can help islam. the president of you're country might be able to help our religion in some way and you should just to take the chance that it'll help you. plus, if many people don't vote, that might hurt you and you should at least TRY to make you're vote count for something.|`|dUBPvt6Faa	Foolish people|`|QsCPOHAraa	It's not haram to vote, you just have to vote for Allah!|`|9NniKJcEaa	Uh NO!!!

If they are, they most certainly do not practice their faith! God's love is so much more strong than any human being. You need him way more than you need man. Therefore you should NOT leave the Catholic Church. To sum that paragraph up: God's love is stronger, nobody should leave the RCC just because some act like creeps. Please note that I WAS in your position and man! I KNOW how it feels. I attend a Protestant study group but hey, I have gone through a bad experience with Catholics before. I am steady and strong so I will be kept with Christ's one true Church. The Protestant reformation has changed lives, but they follow false doctrine. They do not believe works is necessary 4 salvation. "Faith without works is dead"-Book of James. Are you going 2 follow Luther and his followers who changed the Bible just cuz they THOUGHT they were right??? NO! Follow Christ and his faithful servants, who have NOT changed the Bible a bit. please note that ALL protestants believe faith alone is the key. Also check this verse out: "many will call my name, Lord Lord Lord on the last day, but only those who did the will of my father will see the kingdom of God" . Now also know that protestants don't think they have to confess their sins to priests. "and he gave them power to forgive sins TO a priest THROUGH Jesus" NOTTT!!! Through a priest which most protestants think(WRONG) Please do NOT leave the largest Christian denomination just cuz you think e1 who is in it is bad. WHICH is WRONG! Is the Pope bad? was Peter,Paul, Saint Joseph, Saint Catherine,Saint Francis, Saint Christopher,Saint Bernadette or any Holy Saint who were ALL catholics bad? NOOOOOOO!!!!! Please note that the KKK are protestant Christians! How many murders, and bad things have they done 2 catholics and blacks? If u convert 2 a false denomination you will be in a body with those kinda people?(not your church, just the body of Protestantism) Last but not least: purgatory. Protestants deny purgatory. "Whoever dies in God's grace and are still imperfectly purifies will experience cleansing fire" Is Hell cleansing? NO. Is heaven fire? NO! hmmm purgatory! BINGO BROTHER WE GOT IT! "nothing unclean cannot enter heaven" If protestants believe that they don't have 2 repent sins and only faith saves you then what? Oh yeah HELL! it's in the Bible brother =D God Bless and seek faith in God! I hope you see that Truth is the way. Follow Christ NOT Luther who had no authority from God 2 break away from the RCC and remove 7 books of the Holy Bible.|`|idRvGHOEaa	It is better to follow your heart. If the Holy Spirit leads you to the Catholic Church, go there. If the Holy Spirit leads you to the a Protestant denomination, that is where you should go. Just know that there are bad people everywhere that practice every religion. It's about your walk with Christ, not about who is following Christianity in the same fashion as you. Every person is responsible for themselves.|`|py57svUyaa	What is Christian Protestant? As in Protestant as oppose to Christian Catholic?  Catholics are Christians just like Protestants are.

The Catholic Faith is the tradition of Christ handed down through the Popes to our present Pope. It might be worthy to note that the Anglicans (a breed of Luther) killed Catholics for centuries under British rule. The Irish Protestants went to war with Catholics. Luther spawned liberalism and modernism also. People don't dictate what the religion is. Catholics can be bad through free will it doesn't mean the religion is wrong. It's about time you start to look at things with faith and reason and not with feeling just because people make you feel warm and fuzzy inside and tell you everything you want to hear.  If you turn from God's Catholic religion, what else is there, Satan's?|`|0JE41mXsaa	There are men of good will in every race, religion and creed.  Labelling Roman Catholic teaching as wrong before some of its billions of adherents were Mafia - seems very wrong - and I am not a Roman Catholic.<br>  <br>  When you are looking at the question of Christian religion you need to go to where Jesus Christ is the High Priest, the Way the Truth, the Life.  Where the teachings are those of the Apostles without change that contradicts 'earlier' teaching.  So start there - with the beginning.<br>  <br>  Of the ancient religions you have Orthodox Christianity and Roman Catholicism.  <br>  <br>  Because I am an Orthodox Priest - I would recommend that you examine Orthodox Christianity for its truth - if you find truth there - then you will find Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  As a place to start first pray then go and visit: www.orthodoxinfo.com<br>  <br>  God Bless!|`|632FPWz2aa	christians are good, because they don't have a pope, (popes are not real) and catholics believe mary magdalene was closer to god than jesus, so that's just plain stupid.

The Rosary shall be a powerful armor against Hell, it will destroy vice, decrease sin, and defeat heresies.<br>  4. It will cause virtue and good works to flourish; it will obtain for souls the abundant mercy of God; it will withdraw the hearts of men from the love of the world and its vanities and will lift them to the desire of eternal things.

Whoever shall recite the Rosary devoutly, applying himself to the consideration of its sacred mysteries, shall never be conquered by misfortune. God will not chastise him in His justice, he shall not perish by an unprovided death; if he be just, he shall remain in the grace of God and become worthy of eternal life.<br>  7. Whoever shall have a true devotion for the Rosary shall not die without the Sacraments of the Church.<br>  8. Those who are faithful to recite the Rosary shall have during their life and at their death the light of God and the plenitude of His graces; at the moment of death, they shall participate in the merits of the saints in Paradise.<br>  9. I shall deliver from Purgatory those who have been devoted to the Rosary.<br>  10. The faithful children of the Rosary shall merit a high degree of glory in Heaven.<br>  11. You shall obtain all you ask of me by the recitation of the Rosary.<br>  12. All those who propagate the Holy Rosary shall be aided by me in their necessities.<br>  13. I have obtained from my Divine Son that all the advocates of the Rosary shall have for intercessors the entire Celestial Court during their life and at the hour of death.<br>  14. All who recite the Rosary are my sons, and brothers of my only Son, Jesus Christ.<br>  15. Devotion to my Rosary is a great sign of predestination.<br>  <br>  God bless!<br>  Dave|`|vMf7pL9Aaa	It is interesting that you bring that up.  There is crime that is within all denominations to be honest.  It is interesting how problems within the Catholic Church hits headlines, though when it comes down to protestants, Judaism, Islam, they are rarely brought up within the news headline.  What is taught in high school is that the Catholics were evil because of the crusades, yet they fail to bring up the facts of why exactlythe crusades began.  They bring up how Catholics persecuted protestants but fail to bring up what was happening to Catholics, i.e., King Henry VIII would have entire Catholic Families tortured and slaughtered if they were caught with a Douay Rheims Bible.<br>  <br>  Persecution of Catholics by The Protestants in England (1535-1692):They suffered the extreme penalty for maintaining the unity of the Church and the Supremacy of the Apostolic See, the doctrines most impugned by the reformation in all lands, and at all times. They maintained their faith almost entirely by the most modern methods, and they were the first to so maintain it, i.e., by education of the clergy in the<br>  <br>  seminaries, and of Catholic youth in colleges, at the risk, and often at the cost of life.  The tyranny they had to withstand was, as a rule, not the sudden violence of a tyrant, but the continuous oppression of laws, sanctioned by the people in Parliament, passed on the specious plea of political and national necessity, and operating for centuries with an almost irresistible force which the law acquires when acting for generations in conservative and law-abiding counties.<br>  <br>  THE LAST WORDS AND THE DEATHS OF THE ENGLISH MARTYRS:Imprimatured 1878 "I am a Christian, and wear on my forehead the sign of the cross. By this sign I am confirmed against the devil and heretics—God’s enemies. I fear not your words nor your threats. I confess and adore on God. He created me to serve Him, and serve Him I cannot in any other but in the Catholic faith. This faith I profess. With the heart men believe unto justice, but with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. For this faith I now desire to die more than I ever desired to live. No death can be more precious than that which is undergone for this faith, which faith Christ taught, and a hundred thousand martyred have sealed with their blood." (MARK BARKWORTH OR LAMBERT, PRIEST, O. P. B. AND ENGLISH MARTYR)<br>  <br>  Ireland's Holocaust: As no Jew would ever refer to the "Jewish Oxygen Famine of 1939-1945," so nobody Irish ought ever, ever again refer to the "Irish Potato Famine."<br>  <br>  etc... this is not taught in school, this is something that makes me wonder why?<br>  <br>  The answer is quite easy, Lucifer and his Apostate hate and fear the Roman Catholic Church alone, they have admitted during some exorcisms (that took place in the Public) that they are the ones to have influenced the Protestant revolt and denominations.  Even Martin Luther knew he was wrong: A curious letter from Martin Luther to his mother has been preserved among the many and valuable manuscripts in the library belonging to the Dominican Convent of Santa Maria sopra Minerva at Rome. The poor lady, who did not venture to blame her son for his religious aberrations, and who shrank from the idea of being separated from him for all eternity, wrote and asked him whether she ought to change her religion and adopt his new persuasion. The proud Saxon could not make up his mind to involve in common shipwreck with himself one who loved him so dearly; so he replied: “No, remain a Catholic, for I will neither deceive nor betray my mother.” What better refutation of the arch heretic’s doctrine could there be than such a reply, which conscience wrung from his filial affection.

Bb6fQtl0aa	Below is an excerpt from the book "The Wahhabi Myth" by Haneef James Oliver. The term "Wahhabi" is a slanderous term, used to attack Muslims who believe in following the Noble Qur'an and the Sunnah of Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, with the same interpretation as the Companions of the Prophet, peace be upon him, and the scholars throughout Islamic history who also followed this way. For more information, see the book's website at <a href="http://www.theWahhabiMyth.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.theWahhabiMyth.com</a> , inshaa-Allaah the read will be quite beneficial and insightful. And anyone who has studied the biography of Shaykh Muhammad ibn Abdul-Wahhaab, will not find any evidence of "extremism."<br>  <br>  ----<br>  ABRIDGED EXCERPT from "The Wahabi Myth"<br>  <br>  What is a Salafi and What is Salafism?<br>  <br>  The reader will notice that the word "Wahhabi" is always indented with quotation marks here at <a href="http://www.theWahhabiMyth.com." rel="nofollow">http://www.theWahhabiMyth.com.</a> Those who are labeled with this word do not themselves use this term, as it is used as a means of belittlement. The reasons for the rejection of this term are clearly outlined throughout this book. The correct way of referring to them is by terming them "Salafis", as they are those who adhere to the way of the "Salaf" - the Prophet Muhammad (may Allah raise his rank and grant him peace) and his companions.<br>  <br>  Following the way of the Salaf is the way which has been legislated in the Quran and Sunnah, the very sources of Islam. The Prophet (may Allah raise his rank and grant him peace) said to his daughter Fatimah: "Indeed, I am for you a blessed Salaf." (1)<br>  <br>  When asked about which was the correct and acceptable way of understanding Islam, the Prophet (may Allah raise his rank and grant him peace) replied by saying: "That which I and my companions are upon." (2)<br>  <br>  Similarly, Allah says in the Quran that He is pleased with the companions "and also those who follow them exactly (in faith)." (3)<br>  <br>  As such, He said regarding the Prophet (may Allah raise his rank and grant him security) and his companions:<br>  <br>  "So if they believe as you (i.e. the Salaf) believe, they are indeed rightly guided." (4)<br>  <br>  All of the orthodox scholars of Islam followed the way of the Salaf in understanding religion. Early scholars such as Imam al-Awzaa'ee, who died 157 years after the Prophet's emigration to Medina, said: "Be patient upon the Sunnah, and stop where the people (i.e. where the Salaf) stopped, and say what they said, and refrain from what they refrained from, and follow the path of your righteous Salaf; for verily, sufficient for you is what was sufficient for them." (5)<br>  <br>  Today, one of the famous Sunni schools of jurisprudence is named after a scholar named Abu Haneefah. Millions of Muslims all over the world ascribe themselves to his school of jurisprudence; those who the media would term "mainstream" Muslims. Regarding adherence to the Salafi methodology, he said, "Adhere to the narrations and way of the Salaf, and beware of newly invented matters (in religion), for all of it is innovation." (6)<br>  <br>  The media claim that Salafis/"Wahhabis" believe that all those who do not follow their form of Islam are "heathens" (10) is a tall tale. Salafis believe that those Muslims who do not follow the understanding of the Salaf are not adhering to these and other clear texts. As such, they do not fall under the above-mentioned Quranic verse as being "rightly guided." Salafis distinguish between those who fall into religious innovation and those who fall into disbelief.<br>  <br>  When considering the proofs which are contained within the Quran and Sunnah and the statements of all the orthodox scholars of Islam from the earliest generations to the present time, it becomes obvious that it is a great blunder for the media to refer to Salafism as being a new movement called "Wahhabism" which came about only two centuries ago during the time of Muhammad Ibn Abdul-Wahhab in Saudi Arabia.<br>  <br>  "So after the truth, what else can there be, save error?" [Quran 10:32]<br>  --------<br>  <br>  MY ADDITIONAL NOTE:<br>  For anyone interested in learning more, I encourage you to actually read the treatises of Shaykh Muhammad ibn Abdul-Wahhaab. Many of them are relatively short and amazingly beneficial. One would be hard-pressed to find anything from his essays calling to extremism. Rather, much of his work is simply about educating the common Muslim in the basics of Islamic Monotheism.<br>  <br>  With regards to the accusations that "Wahhabism" was started by the British, then this is a famous false claim made by the Sufi sectarians who took offense to their shrines (devoted to the worship of dead saints) being demolished in accordance with the Sunnah. One who has studied the biography of the Shaykh and/or read his treatise would not find anything in support of "British" ideologies, rather we find nothing but pure Islam and Sunnah.<br>  <br>  Available below are links to the Shaykh's translated works (English Language):<br>  <br>  "The Four Rules (of Islamic Monotheism)"<br>  <a href="http://www.spubs.com/sps/downloads/pdf/TAW010001.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.spubs.com/sps/downloads/pdf/T...</a><br>  <br>  "The Three Basic Principles of Islaam"<br>  <a href="http://www.salafyink.com/aqeedah/UsooluthThalaathah.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.salafyink.com/aqeedah/Usoolut...</a><br>  <br>  "The Pillars, Conditions, and Requirements of Prayer"<br>  <a href="http://www.al-ibaanah.com/ebooks.php?EID=23" rel="nofollow">http://www.al-ibaanah.com/ebooks.php?EID...</a>|`|bZo5Z53Uaa	Wahhab is one of Allah's (swt) name :)<br>  <br>  Some people just like to refer to others whom follow Quran and Sunnah as Wahhabi's as Abdul WahhaB was trying to revive the Sunnah and explain about Tawheed, hence they claim the people who adhere to this ideology worship or follow him. Actually in fact we take the work he has done into consideration.|`|SCkhQc2Caa	The word Wahhabi is the attributive derived from al-Wahhaab (the Bestower), who is Allaah, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): <br>  <br>  “Our Lord! Let not our hearts deviate (from the truth) after You have guided us, and grant us mercy from You. Truly, You are the Bestower [al-Wahhaab]”<br>  <br>  [Aal ‘Imraan 3:8] <br>  <br>  As al-Zajjaaj said in Ishtiqaaq Asma’-Allaah, p. 126, al-Wahhaab “is the One Who gives a great deal. This form (fa’’aal) in Arabic is indicative of something that is done to a great extent. Allaah is al-Wahhaab (the Bestower) Who gives to His slaves one after another.” <br>  <br>  Undoubtedly the path of al-Wahhaab is the path of truth in which there is no crookedness or fabrication, and His party is the one that will prevail. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): <br>  <br>  “And whosoever takes Allaah, His Messenger, and those who have believed, as Protectors, then the party of Allaah will be the victorious”<br>  <br>  [al-Maa’idah 5:56] <br>  <br>  “They are the party of Allaah. Verily, it is the party of Allaah that will be the successful”<br>  <br>  [al-Mujaadilah 58:22] <br>  __________________________________<br>  <br>  <br>  Long ago they ( the enemies) accused al-Shaafa’i of being a Raafidi (Shi’ah) and he refuted them by saying:<br>  <br>  “If being a Raafidi means loving the family of Muhammad, then let the two races (of mankind and the jinn) bear witness that I am a Raafidi.” <br>  <br>  We refute the claims of those who accuse us of being Wahhabis by quoting the words of Shaykh Mullah ‘Imraan who was a Shi’i but Allaah guided him to the Sunnah. He said: <br>  <br>  “If the follower of Ahmad [the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)] is a Wahhaabi, then I affirm that I am a Wahhaabi .<br>  <br>  I reject the association of any other with Allaah, for I have no Lord except the Unique, the Bestower (al-Wahhaab) <br>  <br>  Those who were called by the Prophet accused him of being a sorcerer and a liar.” <br>  <br>  [Manhaaj al-Firqat al-Naajiyah by Shaykh Muhammad Jameel Zayno, p. 142-143. ]<br>  ______________________________________...|`|Cugx9IXraa	I'M WAHABI!!! <br>  <br>  so long as they hate shias i'm with them 100% :D|`|KqiiT1WSaa	They will call imaam Abu HAnifa (r) a wahabi they will call imaam MAlik (r) a wahabi they will call imaam Shafi (r) a wahabi they will call imaam ahmad ibn HAnabal (r) a wahabi.<br>  <br>  So ANYONE who follows the Quran and the sunnah is a wahabi according to shia,<br>  <br>  YET THEY ELEVATE THEIR Imaams to the point that they say that they are better than ALL the prophets (excluding Muhammed pbuh)<br>  <br>  They are disgusting liars.|`|4ViYw6Hxaa	Wahhabis are followers of Iblees.<br>  <br>  Here is Wahhabi belief<br>  <br>  Quran 15:30] So the angels prostrated themselves, all of them together:<br>  [Yusufali 15:31] Not so Iblis: he refused to be among those who prostrated themselves.<br>  [Yusufali 15:32] (Allah) said: "O Iblis! what is your reason for not being among those who prostrated themselves?"<br>  [Yusufali 15:33] (Iblis) said: "I am not one to prostrate myself to man, whom Thou didst create from sounding clay, from mud moulded into shape."<br>  [Yusufali 15:34] (Allah) said: "Then get thee out from here; for thou art rejected, accursed.<br>  [Yusufali 15:35] "And the curse shall be on thee till the day of Judgment."<br>  [Yusufali 15:36] (Iblis) said: "O my Lord! give me then respite till the Day the (dead) are raised."<br>  [Yusufali 15:37] (Allah) said: "Respite is granted thee<br>  [Yusufali 15:38] "Till the Day of the Time appointed."<br>  [Yusufali 15:39] (Iblis) said: "O my Lord! because Thou hast put me in the wrong, I will make (wrong) fair-seeming to them on the earth, and I will put them all in the wrong,-<br>  [Yusufali 15:40] "Except Thy servants among them, sincere and purified (by Thy Grace)."<br>  <br>  1- Wahhabis are Monotheist like Iblees.<br>  2- Wahhabis believe in Day of Judgment like Iblees.<br>  3- Wahhabis believe in prophets like Iblees (when Iblees said<br>  Quran 15:40] "Except Thy servants among them, sincere and purified (by Thy Grace)."<br>  4- Wahhabis blame their sins on Allah just like Iblees when Iblees said (Quran 15:39] (Iblis) said: "O my Lord! because Thou hast put me in the wrong, I will make (wrong) fair-seeming to them on the earth, and I will put them all in the wrong,-<br>  5- Wahhabis have big beard like Iblees.<br>  6- Wahhabis have lots of wives like Iblees<br>  7- Wahhabis have lots of rotten children like Iblees.|`|e3PWZYsAaa	Salam,<br>  <br>  yes, the wahabis religion was created by the british givernemtent as they send out spys........<br>  <br>  "The Memories Of Mr. Hempher The British Spy"<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sunna.info/antiwahabies/wahhabies/htm/spy2.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.sunna.info/antiwahabies/wahha...</a><br>  <br>  "Thus we continuously became more and more powerful.

nI2xSDhLaa	It's different for everybody.....she will find out on her own someday.....|`|2g5W67Ueaa	my first kiss was at school. There was something sneaky about it because it's against the rules at school. My boyfriend.... when i was 12.... took me behind the bus and kissed me. oh boy you should have seen my face after that. smiling ear to ear :P<br>  <br>  But since she is 15 i would not go behind a bus and kiss that is a bit juvenile. So i would just hangout one night and kiss under the stars... at a football game or in a park. where ever is comfortable :)<br>  <br>  i hope i helped <3.<br>  good luck to her!|`|NZIl5nCZaa	Well, I was fourteen when I had my first kiss with my boyfriend, who I'm still with. People find it weird that we didn't kiss until AFTER our one year (yes... one year) anniversary, but I'm really glad that we took things slow (and we are still together... this happened July of last year) It really does depend on the person though.<br>  <br>  Tell your friend to wait for the right guy. Don't just kiss the first person who is willing to share a kiss with her because she might regret it. She needs to wait for the person that SHE wants to get, because that will make the experience so much better. <br>  <br>  Hope that helps. Good luck! :)

All have fantasies at one time or another that may or may not involve our partners. But that doesn't make us cheat. Even if a couple isn't fantasizing at all, they can still live as roomates. The bible only says thinking is wrong, because thinking often leads to doing, and throughout the bible's history, the old testament is full of stories of ppl of every varying social class, who claim to be religious, having no self control. So in the new testament, it's clear, because if the thought never occured to u, how are u gonna do it? I believe that u can think, just don't act. But if u are one who practices no self control, then u best pray ur hardest never to think of anything against the commandments.<br>  <br>  coveting a neighbors possessions only leads to stealing if u react negatively to ur thoughts. coveting ur neighbors wife, only leads to adultery/cheating, if u act on ur impulse. urges are natural, but that is y humans are animals, but shouldn't act like them. God gave us the power of reason, and the ability to control our actions, and when we feel we can't, we pray, and get out of tempting situations.|`|355JLlcLaa	It says you have to cut off your hands and feet and pluck out your eyes.

This man seems to see perhaps a different truth than I do, as I am a berean, and rightly divide the word of truth. It is right division that makes all Biblical doctrinal difficulties, and denominational differences disappear.<br>  I noticed that everything this man said came from scriptures directed to Israel. Indeed, he spoke only of the 12 apostles, where error was concerned. <br>  Remember, Paul was persecuted for giving such a starkly different gospel than that which was delivered by the Lord Jesus and the 12.<br>  That is because the Gospel of the Grace of God IS a different gospel than the Gospel of the Kingdom, which is for Israel, and is also called the Gospel of the Circumcision.

"a memorial proclaimed with the blast of horns") see the Book of Leviticus 23:24 [1] that refers to the command to perform the ritual of the blowing of the shofar on the Jewish holiday of Rosh Hashanah.<br>  <br>  In the days of the Jewish Temple, the shofar was accompanied by the blowing of two silver trumpets (which were also blown on other occasions): Book of Numbers 10:1-2; 10:10: "And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying 'Make thee two trumpets of silver (??????? ?????????? ??????); of beaten work shalt thou make them; and they shall be unto thee for the calling of the congregation...Also in the day of your gladness, and in your appointed seasons, and in your new moons, ye shall blow with the trumpets over your burnt-offerings, and over the sacrifices of your peace-offerings; and they shall be to you for a memorial before your God: I am the Lord your God.'

So what's your point?<br>  <br>  A lot of whites are mixed as well.  Since many white men married native American women especially in the west and midwest. So what's your point?<br>  <br>  Why do blacks and hispanics try to deny their heritage??<br>  <br>  I saw a very interesting program on the role of Africans in Mexico.  Over 90% of Mexicans along with other hispanic groups have some African heritage.   Yet every chance they get they try to stress their single drops of "European Spanish" roots.  What gives?  Why do minorities continue to deny their racial heritage?<br>  <br>  **By the way people get it confused.  There are only 4 races: African (Black), Caucasian (White), Asian (Mongoloid Asian such as Japanese, Chinese Viet etc. and Yes! Native Americans are actually Asian).  The Native people of America are descendants of the people that walked across the Bering Strait over 35,000 years ago. <br>  <br>  Hispanics and Arabs are a mutt mix of the combinations mentioned.|`|EmOnt7FIaa	Yes you would.<br>  <br>  Even if you are 1/16 of another race you should be considered mixed race. It is important to embrace all of your family members/ancestors because if ONE ancestor was missing off your family tree, you wouldn't be here.|`|1O1ZyEhpaa	Technically, yes. But you can call yourself what you feel comfortable with calling yourself|`|JOdlqhQwaa	No, you are pure Human, honey.|`|PXMqXwflaa	Yep. You're like most of us. Very few of us are of one ethnic group. The vast majority of Americans, whether they consider themselves white, brown, red, black, yellow, whatever, are drawn from a hodgepodge of different racial and ethnic groups. <br>  <br>  A 'black' person might think of themselves an African American. He might think of himself as having 'African' blood lines, but also consider himself an American. However, many African countries had their gene pools influenced by different European colonial powers, by Arabs and by others. <br>  <br>  The same with 'white' people. My heritage embraces the Irish, Scotts, Brits, Germans, Slovaks and Italians. But I never really think of myself as being part of any of those groups. I'm simply an American; a mutt drawn from many different gene pools. <br>  <br>  The important thing is not to let anyone label you, especially if you see that label as a detriment. Be who and what you want, and ignore the rest. It simply doesn't matter.|`|pfke6Jieaa	look, if ur father and mother are different races, no matter what is in their blood, u r mixed. u should already know that.|`|p0D4dxEqaa	Yes definitely,|`|DgsHQ47yaa	You have add mixture but you are black.|`|XkidpdPWaa	Yeah, but you'd have a hard time explaining how you're mixed race.|`|B0GujA9Aaa	I think it's safe to say that you are mixed. <br>  <br>  Welcome to the club.|`|CCa9kRHHaa	You're a mutt...no offense, I'm just kidding|`|y3gi2t78aa	Nope, just black.
S8pIwxpwaa	I pronounce it "roar shock". However the pronunciation of the "ack" sound varies by geographic region. You'll see east coasters using some variation of "shack", midwesterners & westerners using "shock".|`|n7qcfWxkaa	It's German, so you should pronounce it with a German accent. It sounds kind of like "roar-shock" but not quite. You don't fully pronounce the last R in roar and the end of Shock has a guttural sound. But roar-shock is good enough.|`|vd2ExGEraa	1st one

What has a persons colour got to do with anything.The word Racist means to a judge another by the colour of their skin.Our skin colour is dependant on the climate of the country or continent to which we belong,the reason people have darker skin is because they come from a hot climate.So I'll ask you a question; What has the climate into which a person is born have to do with whether they are likeable or not.Surely, to any educated person at least,we base our opinions of others on who they are as members of the human race,not on the colour of their skin!|`|h1Pxqz5vaa	I love all people.

lBw50ySpaa	You could give them to your school.  My middle school son is such an avid reader, he says he has read everything in his school library.<br>  The county library is a good idea too.  I know you said you want to help youths, but many youths can't afford books.  Our local library sells some of its book donations for as little as 50 cents for a paperback.  All monies go to the library, and a kid who loves to read gets a good book cheap.<br>  I really think that these ideas are better than a youth group, because most youth organizations are focusing on active activities that assist social and physical development.|`|g2BJ61HVaa	I don't know if you in Philadelphia have library's but in canada we have something called library's and you can donate books there ! <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Please best answer this !

This is almost certainly a cultural peculiarity (there are many such in religion).  By that I mean:  this is a legend (and a bracelet) that is only put in use by a very specific ethnic group.  It is not a common legend or a common piece of "jewelry" for Roman Catholics in general.<br>  <br>  Jim, <a href="http://www.bible-reviews.com/selector_rc.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bible-reviews.com/selector_rc...</a>|`|AA11796124	That sounds like superstition, and superstition is not in sync with Catholic Doctrine:<br>  <br>  The Catechism of the Catholic Church teaches:<br>  <br>  2111 Superstition is the deviation of religious feeling and of the practices this feeling imposes. It can even affect the worship we offer the true God, e.g., when one attributes an importance in some way magical to certain practices otherwise lawful or necessary. To attribute the efficacy of prayers or of sacramental signs to their mere external performance, apart from the interior dispositions that they demand, is to fall into superstition.<br>  <br>  2138 Superstition is a departure from the worship that we give to the true God. It is manifested in idolatry, as well as in various forms of divination and magic. <br>  <br>  2110 The first commandment forbids honoring gods other than the one Lord who has revealed himself to his people. It proscribes superstition and irreligion. Superstition in some sense represents a perverse excess of religion; irreligion is the vice contrary by defect to the virtue of religion.|`|zefFTf8Aaa	no.

If you mean that ghosts are some traces of people who have moved on to another spiritual plain or dwell here for a while, then yes it's possible. Are the traces active? It's possible that they are. There always seems to be some unresolved issues at stake that the "ghosts" must resolve for their own peace, or for the good of someone they left behind.<br>  <br>  I am not sure about weird or stupid "hauntings" being ghosts.

I am not sure if it is just something that you have to be open to or if it is some strange genetic thing. That last genetic part I put in because numerous family members have had odd experiences. <br>  <br>  Now I am a fairly straight laced individual and have tried to explain away some of these things, but there is only so much one can explain.

Every single verse that speaks about in the Bible has a good case behind it for mistranslation and cultural differences between then and now.<br>  <br>  While you are a minor you will have your parents to deal with on this issue.

Don't listen to them.

You shouldn't have to change yourself for your religion.|`|AA10556726	At 13 you have awhile before you need to worry about it, just relax, have fun, make friends and enjoy being young.

God calls it an "abomination."  That means it's something really bad. If you are tempted by sin, you must TURN AWAY from it, or REPENT of it. You will be forgiven. (if you truly repent)  Then, accept Jesus into your heart. He will give you a new heart. One that desires to do His will, and not your own. <br>  We are all tempted by some kind of sin. To some, it's alcholism, to some it's adultry, and to some, it's homosexuality. It's wrong because God says it's wrong. <br>  There have been many many people who have been SAVED from the sin of homosexuality. That's the good news!

This may be confusing be homosexuality is often accepted in society, yet at other times it is attacked. So I can't really help much, but I can say that you shouldn't label yourself lesbian just yet.

Like they say innocent until proven guily, you can be striaght until proven homosexual.|`|FOzN3xwzaa	Homosexuality is a sin.  And like all sins, it is forgiven completely when you believe in Jesus alone for salvation, without adding any of your own works. <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4).

757ce30489e7f56556925d17f1f49f76aa	Because this is how the media gets people to slowly build a hatred for Muslims. If a Christian person kills and rapes someone, it says "Man killed and raped blahblah". A Muslim does it, it says "Muslim man kills and rapes blahblah". <br>  <br>  It's all propaganda really. If you're smart you won't fall for it.<br>  <br>  Edit: And to a lot of the answers, the crime isn't related to Islam. e.g. HONOUR KILLINGS are NOT ALLOWED in Islam. It is a ridiculous cultural thing. This proves that people fall into the trap and believe everything they hear instead of making an effort to learn on their own. It's sad really.|`|6RCHJQfQaa	Not a lot of Christians (for example) have killed for the Christian cause, except for a few wackos like the groups bombing the aborting clinics but they can not be real believers of Christ and do such things.  The problem is that more Muslims are connected to terrorism than Muslims are.|`|uxfacsgmaa	Why do so many Muslims (not all, of course, otherwise the rest of us would be screwed) commit murder in the name of their religion?<br>  <br>  Oh, and there have been plenty of murders in the name of the Christian god.|`|29X6EEsKaa	Scandal. That's what media lives off.|`|qtyheThlaa	A muslim commiting "a murder" isn't what we find relevant.  A muslim killing themselves and others for the "will of Allah" and other crazyness  is what we find relevant.<br>  <br>  If Christians or Jews were stoning people who got out of line or to promote their cause, trust me, people would talk about it.|`|0LlWIJoxaa	causes Muslims do it in the name of their religion and many Muslim Murderers are devout Muslims. Other religions have murderers but they tend to be on average less then devout followers.|`|hqroE4ARaa	Circular reasoning. It's bad for them because they aren't the same as us. But if you read the bible, especially the Old Testament, thousands of people died at the hand of the christian God, but is that talked about?|`|6PBgEf5eaa	Because non muslims were not involved in 9/11 the greatest tragedy in the history of America.|`|5JQFCQCkaa	War on Musl...Terror.<br>  Really, it's mutton, dressed as lamb.|`|uDYshODsaa	because they are killing in the name of their religion|`|LHcdLTOxaa	Holy war that's why.|`|96AQZUGyaa	I think it is because most of the time when you read of a Muslim committing a murder it is because the religion was a motivation for the crime. If you don't state the murderer's religion when their religion was the reason they killed... it would be bad reporting.<br>  <br>  For example, those "honour" killings... those were done because of the people involved were Muslim.<br>  <br>  PS: You can't be racist against a religion.|`|4INE794zaa	Did the Muslim commit the murder due to a religious belief? If yes, then damn right it should be mentioned. But if a person, who happens to be Muslim, commits a murder, not religiously motivated, then there is no reason to mention the religion. Same goes for all beliefs. <br>  When that man killed all those children in Pennsylvania, was there not a mention of his religion?

It was at 16 that the parents would allow men to begin "sparking" her (coming to visit).

Any "transwoman" who claims to have full functionality of their male plumbing  with a female body has only had plastic surgery and is almost always a prostitute, escort, or a porn star who caters to tranny-chasers. Real-life transwomen are a far cry from what porn depicts.  The hormone therapy they take eventually makes them unable to sexually function as men, and they don't want any male parts to be used when having sex.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you are genuinely interested in dating a transwoman, keep in mind what I just told you.

You must be Born again John 3, Nickodemus went and asked Jesus in the night, and Jesus told him ( a prominent man of the law) ye must be born again. ( This is paraphrasing) Nickodemus asked Him how can I enter into my mothers womb? Jesus said ye must be born of Spirit, Which is the Holy Spirit of God, and sealed. <br>    If you have never asked Jesus into your heart and to save you you do not have the Holy Spirit of Almighty God!

Maybe if there was a disclaimer on the first page of the bible it would solve a lot of misunderstandings.  Something like "This is a work of fiction, duh!" would be very helpful.<br>  <br>  Nobody, at least not me, is trying to convince Christians to "turn their backs on God."  I couldn't care less if they worshiped a spirit in the sky or Kermit the frog.  Just don't pass it off as fact.  When people try to do that, such as your quoting scripture, they assume *a priori* that what is written there is "true."  The problem is people of religious bent can't handle the truth.

Here you have a man who did not understand the word of God, so God sent Philip to teach the man what the passage meant. Everyone can understand the bible if they pray and ask God to teach it to them. But without the Holy Spirit present. No one will be able to understand the word of God. Accept through assumptions and of ones opinion. It's like school. A kid who does not know a math problems must be taught a few times until he knows it. Once he get it, he will know it until it is time to move further along in the classroom to where he will need the teacher again. So yes, we all can understand the bible if we have the teacher there to guide us and to show us.
e50e6ca9411acd39c8aec91e4abe2b89aa	The key is to understand what a social structure is. Then you can figure out or research and find the information needed. <br>  <br>  The notion of social structure as relationships between different entities or groups or as enduring and relatively stable patterns of relationship emphasises the idea that society is grouped into structurally related groups or sets of roles, with different functions, meanings or purposes. One example of social structure is the idea of "social stratification", which refers to the idea that society is separated into different strata, according to social distinctions such as a race, class, disability and gender. Social treatment of persons within various social structures can be understood as related to their.[This is not a complete sentence].<br>  <br>  The notion of structure as embedded institutions or norms that shape the actions of social agents is important, as structural determination may occur as the actions of people and organisations are guided partially by the underlying structures in the social system. This approach has been important in the academic literature with the rise of various forms of structuralism, and is important in the contemporary organizational context as organisation structure may determine an organisation's flexibility, capacity to change and many other factors, and is therefore an important issue to management.<br>  <br>  Social structure may be seen to underly important social systems including the economic system, legal system, political system, cultural system, and others. Family, religion, law, economy and class are all social structures. The social system is the parent system of those various systems that are embedded in the social system.|`|67AxHZG4aa	please help me! :)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AlouMNW6EN_OwV.Tqsvh7lsbEBV.;_ylv=3?qid=20090220153309AAGVvc2">http://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|teeQmWsBaa	Friends and family, just like you.
pWA3gybAaa	Father O'Leary in Boston, he is the best|`|v6nISGeUaa	Each Catholic Diocese should have an exorcist connected to that Diocese. The name of that priest usually isnt well-known,  because exorcisms take a great toll on the priest.     Call a local Catholic church and tell them your problem. At first the priest might simply bless your house or say Mass at your house, regardless if you are a Catholic or not. That will work, but if you are not a follower of Jesus Christ, his blessings will only last for a while. To fight evil, you must be a believer.  There is this scripture in the New Testament:    Matthew 12:43-45  When an unclean spirit goes out of a person it roams through arid regions searching for rest but finds none. Then it says, 'I will return to my home from which I came.' But upon returning, it finds it empty, swept clean, and put in order. Then it goes and brings back with itself seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they move in and dwell there; and the last condition of that person is worse than the first. Thus it will be with this evil generation."     This means that the evil can be expelled, but if the person (or people that live in a house) do not repent and believe in the Gospel, the evil spirit will come back and be stronger than before.    Until you can get the help of a priest, turn your TV to EWTN. This is a Catholic TV channel and they say prays though-out the day. You could also try to fight the evil by reading your Bible out loud, but then you must believe.    This spirit wont go away on its own. You need the help of Jesus, not Feng-Shui or a Shaman. Only those, fighting in the name of Jesus, can rid the evil.    God Bless  .|`|Eo7KcX3Waa	Who is Feng Shui ? Of course it is not working...  You don't need no priest to do the job, all you need is a person who is saved and filled with the Holy Spirit, they will come and do the job, but if you are not saved , the demons will come back and bring more friends...  So when you are not saved , this blessing of the house will be short lived, the demons know who is of God and who is not...and if you don't come at them in the Name of Jesus, they will laugh at you...|`|yDJiiqcsaa	This entire question is probably in jest but you do bring up several points.  Each diocese designates a particular priest for exorcisms. The priest's identity is not freely admitted (kept something of a secret). You don't just go ask Fr. XYZ  to perform an exorcism - you have to convince someone at the diocese that one needs to be done (by explaining the situation and then they investigate/confirm the need). Also, house/places aren't believed by the Catholic Church to be "possessed" - only people can be possessed.   A simple house "blessing" can be performed by any priest.  It is a rite frequently done when a family moves into a new home.

Ever since the MySpace advertisement, this comes up every few hours in this forum. Basically, the whole 2012 thing is bogus. People are out to make money on it.    The following is part (toward the bottom) of the wikipedia article on the Mayan Calendar: "The Mesoamerican Long Count calendar forms the basis for a New Age belief, first forecast by Jos Argelles, that a cataclysm will take place on or about December 21, 2012, a forecast that mainstream Mayanist scholars consider a misinterpretation, yet is commonly referenced in pop-culture media as the 2012 problem.    "For the ancient Maya, it was a huge celebration to make it to the end of a whole cycle," says Sandra Noble, executive director of the Foundation for the Advancement of Mesoamerican Studies, Inc. in Crystal River, Florida. To render December 21, 2012, as a doomsday or moment of cosmic shifting, she says, is "a complete fabrication and a chance for a lot of people to cash in."

In the Open Bible, kjv, it states is as the period between two eternities.  The views on when the end of time will be vary based on what the person presenting the viewpoint believes.  I settled this question in my mind by reading about current events and comparing possible outcomes to prophecy.  I believe if the present course continues, yes we may very well find ourselves facing eternity sooner rather than later.    But now is not the time to panic.  It is time to settle with God.

And one is a whole website dedicated to the vast and various ideas as to how and when the world will end.    With so many different ideas and dates, I don't see how 12-12-2012 is any more significant a date than the others.     I hold to what I always have. That the world will end billions of years from now by being vaporized by an expanding sun. We'll all be dead and gone long before that happens.

AA10093245	Your story gave me shivers. That's an awesome sign.  My story isn't as deeply moving at all, but there was one time we were at a local swap meet, pushing our baby boy around in a stroller, and an elderly chinese man came up to us and said "this boy has great potential. He will be very smart and do great things. but you need to stroke him here to bring about his potential" and he showed us how to gently massage that little bone right behind our baby's ears. While this old man was there, we felt this unexplainable "presence" almost like a healing aura, or energy source, we can't describe it. Then the old man just disappeared into the crowd. He had such a peaceful expression, like he carried the wisdom of the ages. Our little man is now 6 years old, and I still massage behind his ears and tell him how smart he is.

mfSp38yzaa	I am assuming that these people still attend church on Sunday?    We have Bible studies at people homes, and most religious education takes place at our school rather than our church. This is not to separate them from the church, but a matter of space. There are so many things going on in the church on any given day that everything cannot possibly happen on site...so it only makes sense that a Bible study can feasibly take place at a home to make room for other events that MUST be at church.|`|yQNit56Qaa	Well, consider: what is bible study for?  Is it for the purpose of converting non-believers, or is it for the edification of those who already believe and want to learn more about their God?    The same is true of "Sunday school".  These things are *for* believers.  In my experience, not many non-believers are interested in bible study!  GENERALLY speaking, it seems to me that bible study and Sunday school are for those who have already committed themselves to following a Christian lifestyle and want to find out more about it.  Remember:  the apostles met in private homes.  If your purpose is to evangelize, it seems to me that there are more effective ways of doing so.    However, to resolve your problem:  you could simply have a running church announcement that one particular bible study group was seeking "newbies" as members.  This particular bible study group could be designed *specifically* for that purpose (milk, to use Paul's analogy, instead of meat).  The rest of the Christians - rightly - should be trying their Christian teeth out on the meat.

As far as the "Easter" egg hunt, that actually is a traditional Pagan game played by the people during the Ostara festivals and I see no reason that it couldn't be played at your festival.  If you don't know the story behind it, you should look it up as it is a pretty cool little story.    There are probably a ton of craft games that the kids could do as well, like making properly themed hand puppets from paper bags (lunch bag size, of course), or other things like that.  You could put on a themed puppet show for the little ones as well.    Just a side note, for those that do not know, "Isis" is the Greek translation from the original Egyptian "Aset" (daughter/child of Set).|`|OiLqzwnyaa	my coven is about 70 active members and many of them bring there children, what we do for the children after the actual children's ritual is break  eggs over there heads.    we prepare them by poking a small hole in the bottom and the top and blow the yolk and whites out, then we stuff them with herbs and glitter. the children and some adults run around breaking them over each others heads. they love it. the thought is that it is good luck for the season, representing fertility for the spring and summer.|`|24H5tznkaa	I would certainly include the egg hunt because it is Pagan in origin...even though now it is more associated with Easter.     *The Easter egg was a symbol of fertility and rebirth used by the ancient Egyptians, Persians, Romans, Greeks, and Gauls. Ancient Babylonians viewed the egg as a sacred symbol. They believed in the ancient fable in which an egg of wondrous size fell into the Euphrates River from heaven. From this egg, Queen Astarte (the queen of the heaves) was hatched.    The egg signified new life and was decorated with bright colors which symbolized the sunlight of spring. The eggs were then exchanged among friends at the spring equinox. Christians later adopted the tradition and the egg came to be a religious symbol representing the tomb in which Jesus Christ came to new life through the Resurrection.*    http://www.associatedcontent.com/article...

This is clearly not an informed or educated position from which to base an argument.      Jesus and all His disciples are Jewish.  The 120 in the upper room are Jewish.  God is not the God of the dead but the living.    Shouldn't you reconsider how you divide your categories as there are Jews who I call brothers and sisters in Messiah.  Being a Jewish foundation where all new members converts, on what basis would you consider this a Gentile religion?    Why not consider that the one thing that the Tanach is consistent in teaching, "God can and does talk to His people."   After Solomon's Temple was rebuilt and renamed Herod's Temple, the era of the prophet ended and so was the ability to hear God's voice.      I would not use the term grateful for people unable to hear/respond to God's voice because,    ***Eph 2:11Therefore, remember that formerly you who are Gentiles by birth and called "uncircumcised" by those who call themselves "the circumcision" (that done in the body by the hands of men) 12remember that at that time you were separate from Christ, excluded from citizenship in Israel and foreigners to the covenants of the promise, without hope and without God in the world. 13But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far away have been brought near through the blood of Christ.    14For he himself is our peace, who has made the two one and has destroyed the barrier, the dividing wall of hostility, 15by abolishing in his flesh the law with its commandments and regulations. His purpose was to create in himself one new man out of the two, thus making peace, 16and in this one body to reconcile both of them to God through the cross, by which he put to death their hostility. 17He came and preached peace to you who were far away and peace to those who were near. 18For through him we both have access to the Father by one Spirit.   http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?sea...

There is a variety of people who participated in his assassination, like Romans, for example. Besides, it's not right to talk about "the Jews" that killed Jesus. There were other Jews who did not kill him. The first Christians were all Jews, the apostles were Jews. This question, however, sounds to me like those many sympathies going to the Jews.

Some of the high priests were afraid of all of Jesus' miracles and his growing following, and that Rome would crack down on them hard and they would loose their influence and power.  Herod also was afraid of this.  Therefore, they bribed Judas who was always all about "money" (check out Bible) to tell the Temple guard where he was so they could arrest him.

For there is no authority except from God, and those which exist are established by God. 2 Therefore whoever resists authority has opposed the ordinance of God; and they who have opposed will receive condemnation upon themselves. 3 For rulers are not a cause of fear for good behavior, but for evil. Do you want to have no fear of authority? Do what is good and you will have praise from the same; 4 for it is a minister of God to you for good. But if you do what is evil, be afraid; for it does not bear the sword for nothing; for it is a minister of God, an avenger who brings wrath on the one who practices evil. 5 Therefore it is necessary to be in subjection, not only because of wrath, but also for conscience sake. 6 For because of this you also pay taxes, for rulers are servants of God, devoting themselves to this very thing. 7 Render to all what is due them: tax to whom tax is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honor to whom honor.|`|Ur53Pf6zaa	You are supposed to do everything God asks you to do.

They obeyed until the Serpent suggested that they would attain wisdom and knowledge if they ate it.  So they did.    The Serpent was truthful in what he said - they *DID* know more after they ate it... but he didn't tell them the whole truth.  He didn't tell them that it would completely erode their peaceful fellowship with God, their Creator.    So they were escorted out of the Garden, and judgment was meted out as promised before they ever sinned.  (If you eat this, you will die.  Well, they did eat it. Therefore, they died.

This doesn't apply (although it is widely assumed) to the Judeo-Christian God that Jesus came to tell us about.    Our God is relationship-oriented, not aloof and discrete.  He is expansive and calls us to love with Him.  He only makes real sense (logic) when He is thought of in relationship -- to us to His only begotten son, Jesus, to the Holy Spirit, to the world.

[18] Deaf, dumb, and blind, they will not return   (to the path).     [19] Or (another similitude) is that of a rain-laden   cloud from the sky: in it are zones of darkness, and   thunder and lightning: they press their fingers in   their ears to keep out the stunning thunderclap, the   while they are in terror of death. But Allah is ever   round the rejecters of Faith!

Ron Hubbard. The organization, by means of Hubbard’s self created psychotherapy technique called “Dianetics”, claims to be able to help rid members of any & all mental constraints including but not limited to emotional scarring (from this & "past" lives) due to "engrams" (past negative experiences stored in our unconscious mind), psychological disorders & chemical imbalances (the solution is to convince members that these things don't actually exist) & drug dependence (including legally prescribed psychopharmaceuticals which counteract the effects of psychological disorders Scientologists believe to be nonexistent). Their “treatment” of substance abuse includes little more than massive, often dangerous doses of vitamins and unhealthy extended sessions in a sauna. <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dianetics#Scientific_evaluation_and_criticisms" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dianetics#S...</a> <br>  Dianetics review: <a href="http://dir.salon.com/story/books/review/2005/06/28/dianetics/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://dir.salon.com/story/books/review/...</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,812852,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.time.com/time/magazine/articl...</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Narconon/detox.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Narconon/deto...</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.nypress.com/20/22/news&columns/feature.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.nypress.com/20/22/news&column...</a> <br>  <br>  Scientology is most certainly NOT a religion. In fact, one of the only reasons they enjoy "tax exempt status" on religious ground in the United States is because they bullied the IRS into a "deal" through extremely aggressive barratry (which is the offense of persistently instigating groundless lawsuits) against said government agency & its officials, & arranged to drop all 2,500 frivolous lawsuits only when an "agreement" was reached. In addition, Scientology's lawyers hired private investigators to dig up any "dirt" on IRS agents which was then used to blackmail or publicly smear all "vulnerable" agents. It was an all-out WAR that Scientology had waged against the IRS, & was even described as such by Scientology's "CEO", David Miscavige, in his 1993 speech to the International Association of Scientologists. <br>  <a href="http://legalminds.lp.findlaw.com/list/fedtax-l/msg00445.html" rel="nofollow">http://legalminds.lp.findlaw.com/list/fe...</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.lermanet.com/scientologynews/nytimes/nyt-irs-030997.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.lermanet.com/scientologynews/...</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.factnet.org/headlines/give-away.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.factnet.org/headlines/give-aw...</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Cowen/essays/irs.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Cowen/essays/...</a> <br>  <br>  The official Scientology organization is composed of a number of “levels”. One begins as a “preclear” & works their way up. One must purchase virtually every service crucial to advancement directly from the "church" & at staggering prices. "Auditing", for example, is purchased in 12? hour blocks, costing anywhere from $200-$750 for introductory sessions to between $8,000 & $9,000 for advanced sessions. Basically, Scientology claims to possess exclusive knowledge of the path to religious redemption & then charges obscene amounts of money for every tiny incremental step towards this end.

Scientologists believe the souls of these aliens (these souls are "Body Thetans") were captured, brainwashed & released; they then attached themselves to our ancestors (and according to Scientology’s belief in Thetan immortality, they also attached to us during “past lives”) & cause many of our mental & physical ills to this day.

It doesn’t recognize legitimate conditions like autism, epilepsy, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, or ANY neurological disorder / chemical imbalance at all, & the “church” has been known to withhold prescription pharmaceuticals from members (often with harmful & deadly results). The “Church” blames psychiatry for the Holocaust, as well as school shootings & even September 11th. It’s been suggested that Hubbard’s vehement opposition was born of the psychiatric community’s rejection of his “tech” as a valid treatment method, but it’s also possible that Hubbard chose psychiatry as a scapegoat. Organizations like Scientology are notorious for villainizing a specific out-group because their “stand against the enemy” fosters cohesion within said organization, & psychiatry was an effective rallying point considering many people already distrust & oppose the mental health profession. <br>  <a href="http://www.anti-scientologie.ch/usa-scientology.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.anti-scientologie.ch/usa-scie...</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.lacitybeat.com/article.php?id=3137&IssueNum=136" rel="nofollow">http://www.lacitybeat.com/article.php?id...</a> <br>  <a href="http://dir.salon.com/story/news/feature/2005/07/01/sci_psy/index_np.html?pn=1" rel="nofollow">http://dir.salon.com/story/news/feature/...</a> <br>  <a href="http://perkinstragedy.org" rel="nofollow">http://perkinstragedy.org</a> <br>  <br>  L.

It is an applied religious philosophy. By “applied” is meant that it is for use in life and  living. You actually use it in your day to day life to change and improve existing conditions. It is a practical religion.<br>  All religions if you study them have a basic philosophy, but they also have certain dogma, rituals and observances and a certain faith or belief is required. There is nothing wrong with this , but Scientology is not that kind of religion. It acknowledges the principle of God or the Supreme Being but does not try to define or describe this principle,  leaving it up to the individual.<br>  It is also not a messianic religion. This means there is no worship of prophets or messiahs or gods. It is not belief or faith based. In Scientology a truth is true for you according to your own observation and experience .<br>  The dictionary definition that applies:<br>  <br>  Religion: The spiritual or emotional attitude of one who recognises the existence of superhuman power or powers.<br>  <br>  The most basic principle of Scientology is that YOU are your own immortal soul, that this is not a thing you have but what YOU actually are.<br>  Scientology believes or considers that Man is basically good. This is different from many religions that promote that he his natively evil or bad unless “made” good.<br>  <br>  The whole purpose of Scientology knowledge application and procedure is to increase an individual’s understanding and awareness of himself as a spiritual being and to rehabilitate his native abilities and potential.<br>  When you do this there sphere and zones of his positive influence increases and moves outward into his life , his family and friends, his groups and Mankind of which he is part .<br>  <br>  How this result is achieved is the “technology” of Scientology, which was developed by L Ron Hubbard from discoveries he made after  extensive research into the field of the mind and the human spirit.<br>  Some of this knowledge was already existing in the sacred lore of ancient texts like the Veda or Vedic Hymns going back 10,000 years. New and additional discoveries were  made about the nature of the human spirit and fully recorded and codified .<br>  Scientology’s closest spiritual ties with any other religion are with Orthodox (Hinayana ) Buddhism with which it shares an historical lineage. But even here the relationship is based mainly on friendship and the recognition of the being as a spirit rather than any organizational ties.<br>  <br>  L.Ron Hubbard published 18 basic books from 1950 to 1955 to fully communicate the basic principles of Scientology, the path of his research and the technology that  he developed from this. <br>  He completed all his research before his death in 1986 and left all his materials and copyrights to the Church of Scientology’s Religious Technology Centre along with most of his personal estate when he died.<br>  <br>  The Church of Scientology is currently established iand operating internationally in over 160 countries world wide. However it is still a new religion, less than 55 years old.<br>  The true story of Scientology as a religion goes like this:<br>  1. A philosopher developes a philosophy about life and death.<br>  2. People find it interesting.<br>  3. People find it works.<br>  4. People pass it along to others.<br>  5. It grows.<br>  <br>  This is just an overview.<br>  L.Ron Hubbard explained fully the theology and technologies of Scientology in more than 500,000 pages of writings, including dozens of books and over 3,000 tape recorded public lectures.

They may not retain the information years later, but sometimes, one will come up with a question about something they had noticed, even while bouncing off the ceiling.

Children are antsy and need constant movement and excitement to pay attention (think: cartoons with their bright colors and crazy sound effects). Children are meant to play and be wild. Maybe consider sending them to children's church or some other alternative activity.  But intently causing a scene gets your attention and gives them something fun to do. So, I guess the answer is yes to both sides of the question.|`|R8yelFG7aa	It depends on the child, but in general a mind has to develop to the point that abstract thought can happen before paying attention to an instructional lecture can actually happen.      Children can understand stories that appeal to what they understand, but a preacher talking about religion, spirituality, God, scripture... these concepts aren't concrete- a child can't grasp them.  Causing a scene is not the intention.  The intent of a child is rarely to cause a problem.  They just do what feels good and fun.    Teaching children to love by being kind and patient and caring to them and others- showing them how to live as Christ teaches- that is the best way to share God with a child.|`|1UokhVRXaa	Try quizzing them.

nMzzwrtUaa	There are several reasons why people believe in god.  1) fear, the fear of death, the fear of when you die you are dead you don't exist on another existence. Fear if you don't believe you will go to hell for those who believe in hell.    2) Hope, for people to hope there is some divine source looking out for them. having a plan set for them. Some thing to ask for help when no one else can help. A clarity of getting to know a higher purpose a greater existing soul to rely and trust 100%.    3) Loneliness, People who are with out a friend or a family of there own turn to god, buddha, shiva, any other divine god you can think of. All of a different name all made for the same purposes.    4) Friendship and fellowship, Some people will believe in god because it locks them in to a set group of people who go to the same church to bring you a sense of harmony and belonging to a group.    5) forced, forced to believe in god by family friends and associates. Stating your an out cast if you don't.    6) Because you believe, This is a good one because people who die and are brought back to life threw medical procedures all claim they saw the same thing felt the same things to them that proves there is a god or little things with in your life time that may show a divine purpose.

That's all I can figure.|`|XN0cYCATaa	First of all, it is possible that God has reasons for allowing evil to exist that we simply cannot understand. In this the Christian can have confidence in God knowing that His ways are above our ways (Isaiah 55:8-9). As the Bible says, the just shall live by faith (Hab. 2:4).       Second, God may be letting evil run its course in order to prove that evil is evil and that suffering, which is the unfortunate product of evil, is further proof that anything contrary to Gods will is bad, harmful, painful, and leads to death.        God gave Adam dominion over the world (Gen. 1:28). When he rebelled against God, he set in motion an entire series of events and changed the very nature of man and creation. Both were affected by sin. Creation was no longer a paradise, but bore thorns and thistles (Gen. 3:17-18; Rom. 8:22). People became sinful (Rom. 5:12; Eph. 2:3), who were haters of God (Rom. 3:19-12), etc. The only conclusion to such a situation is death. Jesus said, "And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved: but for the elects sake those days shall be shortened" (Matt. 24:22).        Sin is rebellion against God and His created order. But God has not left us alone in this fallen world. He continued to enter this world, pointing us to Himself, to truth, to morality, purity, and love. He used the evil of the world (liars, perjurers, the envious, etc), to bring His Son to the cross so that we might have the opportunity of eternal life. In this, God has not stepped away from fallen creation, but has stepped into it by becoming Jesus. God works within the fallen world to affect change and He uses fallen people to accomplish His will. In this, He is proving His sovereignty over evil, suffering, and rebellious people, proving that sin and evil are utterly futile, and that He is worthy of honor and glory.       A third possible reason that God is letting evil occur is so that on the day of judgment, the condemned will have no right to say that their sentence is unjust. God is not stopping people from exercising their free will. Think about this: If someone said that God should stop evil and suffering, then should God then stop all evil and suffering? If God only stopped some of it, then we would still be asking the same question of why it exists. So, if we want God to stop evil and suffering, then He must stop all of it. We have no problem with this when it means stopping a catastrophe, or a murder, or a rape. But what about when someone thinks of something evil? Evil is evil whether it is acted out or not. Hatred and bigotry in someones heart is wrong. If it is wrong, and if God is to stop all evil, then He must stop that person from thinking his own thoughts. To do that, God must remove his freedom of thought. Furthermore, which person on the earth has not thought something evil? God would be required, then, to stop all people from exercising their free will. This is something God has chosen not to do. Therefore, we could say that one of the reasons that God permits evil and suffering is because of mans free will.       Fourth, it is quite possible that God uses the suffering to do good. In other words, He produces patience through tribulation (Rom. 5:3). Or He may desire to save someone through it. Take for example, the account of Joseph who was sold into slavery by His brothers. What they did was wrong and Joseph suffered greatly for it. But, later, God raised up Joseph in Egypt to make provisions for the people of that land during the coming drought of seven years. But not only was Egypt saved, but also so was his family and brothers who originally sold him into slavery. Joseph finally says to them, "You meant it for evil, but God meant it for good" (Gen. 50:15-21). Of course, the greatest example of God using evil for good is the death of Christ. Evil people brought him to the cross, but God used that cross as the means to save the world.       But then we must ask, if this is true, are we working against God by working against evil and suffering? No, we are not. God says he does not want us to sin and suffer. But it is simply true that God can use evil despite of its apparent despicable nature.        God is in the world using the world and its failures for His glory and the benefit of those who listen to Him.        But then, what about those who seem to innocently suffer with no benefit resulting? What about the woman who is raped, or the innocent by stander who is killed by a stray bullet. In both cases, the victims and families suffer nothing but pain and loss. What good can this possibly be?       I think that the answer is two-fold. One, ultimately, no one is innocent. All have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God (Rom. 3:23) and are by nature children of wrath (Eph. 2:3). There is none innocent. Though this is biblically accurate, it does not satisfy the question emotionally. Why do little babies suffer for things they have not done? I must acknowledge that I do not know. Ultimately, we must trust God who knows the beginning from the end and sees the grand picture. He will have the final word and He will be vindicated.          Conclusion         Suffering is the result of human sin. The world is not the way that God created it and because of that, all are vulnerable to the affects of sin in the world. Why does one person suffer and another does not? Why do catastrophes happen to some and no others? It is because sin is in the world. But there will come a day when the Lord will return and cleanse this world of all sin and all suffering.     "And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away" (Rev. 21:4).|`|5KdPRKIVaa	Because otherwise, what's the point?|`|AA11707311	It beats the hell out of believing that I am a descendant of an ape, or whatever.

And as far as your stoning example, please read John Chapter 8.|`|VNrchvUNaa	Our ancestors had no real means to figuring out the facts to why things were the way they were. They made up answers to satisfy their want for answers. This was a by-product of something else - it used to be a beneficial thing to keep the species going which is why natural selection didn't rid of it. Nowadays, science has progressed so much. No more sun gods - we know the truth about the sun and so on.  Eventually theism will have no place - it won't be needed.     Also, for several generations the next generation has been kept in check to be indoctrinated to believe since the moment of birth so they don't have the chance to question what's being told and consider the actual truth.|`|7b98782a50064c8ba7f5de48119d99abaa	To put it simply.... Most people are incapable of embracing the fact that we are all ultimately ignorant, and so make up various gods/idols that can be used to make up answers pertaining to the unknowable. As far as can be told, this has been the practise of man ever since we learned the virtues of hitting things with sticks. Case in point... If you're just a caveman bashing rocks together, how the hell are you supposed to know why the tree next to you just exploded after a bolt of light from the sky hit it - clearly some kind of supreme being is upset with you - that, or you just don't know why it happened. Most likely, the caveman decided that knowing that it was a god was better than not knowing what it was at all.|`|jMKDH07naa	why?   simple, relate with this statement...  what if you did a lot of good things for the others, and in the end there's no GOD? Will you lose something?Or will you gain something from all good things you've done to them?...  and what if you did nothing at all, and in the end there's GOD? Definitely, you'll lost everything in your life. and regrets will remain in you.|`|vqg6wpCLaa	They need to depend on someone, anyone.

Even if I told you the truth, you wouldnt believe me.|`|AA11622701	Anything can be abused.  I have not stopped believing in mathematics because someone used it to design the atomic bombs that took how many thousands of lives when dropped on Japan.  I have not stopped believing in love because some pervert in the name of "love" murdered and butchered dozens of women.  I can not think of a single thing - no matter how good - that can not and has not been perverted.    But that does not mean you throw out the good things because someone managed to find a way to pervert it.    Rather than complain about the abuse, why don't you join the thousands of us loving, peacingful, godly people who want to make a difference for good in the world, by showing His love and doing His will.  Together the Christian church feeds more people, runs more schools and orphanges, supplies more aid in disasters, operates more hospitals and medical clinics, offers more shelters and soup kitchens, etc. then any other organization on earth.  Name me a single group doing the same in the name of atheism.    Why not look at the good that the majority of religious people do in the world, instead of condemning them all for the twisted actions of a handful of idiots.|`|rV1uAtt3aa	I think the answer is to step back and look at humans objectively.    Much of what we do and how we behave is meant to intensify our feelings of community.  We survived early on by marrying our fortunes together.  Anything that intensified that bond was an advantage.    However, if groups grew too large they would be at a disadvantage because there would not be enough resources to feed all of the people.  Anything that limited group size was an advantage.    Welcome religion and its real advantage in both of these areas.  First, religion provides a real sense of community, and it provides a set of rules enforced by fear and intimidation that force people to commit to their group.  Second, it limits the size of a group.  For instance, Jews have strict rules of endogomy that prevent outsiders from easily entering into their community.    The phenomena you mention in your question are not endemic to religion, they are endemic to tribal human behavior.  Religion, which is only one aspect of human culture is often blamed for these phenomena,  but, in actuality, humans use religion as an excuse to perpetrate these acts.  Without religion, they would just have to find another excuse or be more honest with themselves.
bxYWJAYNaa	No you get judged on your actions, not random thoughts that pass through your head.  So don't worry about it!|`|X8LNbaKQaa	You are becoming conscious of one of the big negative effects of being persuaded that some magical mind reading but unknowable, all powerful being has on one's sanity.  How can you possibly sort what you believe and do not believe, what makes sense to you and what does not if you are afraid to even ponder?   Your question reminds me why so many of my very religious acquaintances seem always on the verge of a mental breakdown.  It also reminds me the path I started down that lead to a complete collapse of my faith.  No actual loving god could possibly want anyone to go through that or to strain to keep from thinking.  I came to two possibilities:    1. There is a god and it is an evil demon.    2. There is no god, it is entirely a human fiction.    I decided that the latter was both more likely and a lot easier to live with.  Things got a lot simpler and happier for me, after that.    --   Regards,    John Popelish|`|jW0VqZcOaa	I'm so glad I don't have malicious phantasms infecting my thinking...      Atheism.

LJlaHLQdaa	God has given man a complete rule of life in his law. Obeyed, man shall live by it, through the merits of Christ. Transgressed, it has power to condemn. The law sends men to Christ, and Christ points them back to the law.     The words of Christ are both explicit and comprehensive. "Whosoever"-- minister or layman, wise or ignorant--"shall break one of these least commandments"--willfully or presumptuously, as did Adam and Eve--is included in the condemnation. Breaking one of the commandments makes man a commandment-breaker. "Whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all." No excuse can avail for him who strictly obeys nine of the precepts of God's law, but ventures to break one because it is for his profit or convenience to do so. God demands implicit obedience to all his requirements.     He was man's example, man's representative, and he declares, "I have kept my Father's commandments." The beloved disciple urges that every follower of Christ "ought himself also so to walk even as he walked." All who are in Christ will follow the example of Christ. All who justify the sinner in his transgression of God's law belong to that class of whom our Saviour said, "Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of Heaven." They can have no part with Him who came to magnify the law and make it honorable. They are deceiving the people with their sophistry, saying to the sinner, "It shall be well with thee," when God has declared, "The soul that sinneth [transgresseth the law] it shall die."|`|X548yCR6aa	Nothing, and why do you have the same commandment twice?

The original, word is ynfq yr[n nearim ketannim, may mean young men, for fq katon signifies to be young, in opposition to old, and is so translated in various places in our Bible; and r[n naar signifies, not only a child, but ***********a young man*******, a servant, or even a soldier, or one fit to go out to battle; and is so translated in a multitude of places in our common English version. I shall mention but a few, because they are sufficiently decisive: Isaac was called r[n naar when twenty-eight years old, Gen. xxi. 5-12; and Joseph was so called when he was thirty-nine, Gen. xli. 12. Add to these 1 Kings xx. 14: "And Ahab said, By whom [shall the Assyrians be delivered into my hand?] And he said, Thus saith the Lord, by the YOUNG MEN, yr[nb benaarey, of the princes of the provinces." That these were soldiers, probably militia, or a selection from the militia, which served as a bodyguard to Ahab, the event sufficiently declares; and the persons that mocked Elisha were perfectly accountable for their conduct.     What they said was    Go up, thou bald head; go up, thou bald head.] jrq hl[ jrq hl[ aleh kereach, aleh kereach. Ascend, thou empty skull, to heaven, as it is pretended thy master did!     They made fun of the prophet (a representation of God on the earth) saying that he was bald, senseless, and had made up the story of his master (the prophet he succeeded) ascending. Making fun of the prophet was the same as making fun of God himself.    They were blaspheming God and making fun of his power. They were young men above the age of accountability and were judged for their blasphemy|`|Q1XUe0PDaa	It isn't hard to envision how a story like this develops.   1 or 2 kids made fun of some old grumpy guy and by coincidence one or both of them were victims of a bear attack not long after.

tQsxsuNPaa	Because M existed in the Latin language, but W didn't, so we had to invent a name for it at some point.     M also existed in Greek.  And the languages before Greek.    The W sound was made by the U in Latin, but the U evolved into a vowel only, and the W became its own letter/consonant, I believe through contact with German.|`|b1eacc63c481ff40082f035f83d011d1aa	and "O" is not Siamese twin "C"  nor is "B" called a "D with an attic"    English letters mainly come from Latin origins I think. They came up with letters that were a step up from Hieroglyphics, but they don't have any real meaning to the sound they represent.  Also, many lower case and capitals look like they are not related, but switched at birth (eg, a-A, e-E, g-G, q-Q, r-R)    Getting back to your question, some letters are newer than others. Maybe when they wanted to have a sound for the W, they were less creative with writing than noises.|`|tkqGwbtHaa	because the english language doesn't make any sense.    lol    W is just what the name says, its a double U so instead of putting UU they just make one letter for it, W. space saver, maybe?

He was oppressed by the Romans and Rabbis, who would save him? A few feeble followers? You speak like an *** who watched too many action movies...|`|AA11232725	First of all, Jesus didn't need any people to save Him.    Matthew 26:51  And suddenly, one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword, struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.      52  But Jesus said to him, "Put your sword in its place, for all who take the sword will perish by the sword.  53  Or do you think that I cannot now pray to My Father, and He will provide Me with more than twelve legions of angels?  54  How then could the Scriptures be fulfilled, that it must happen thus?"    Second of all, Jesus planned on laying down His life so that He could take it up again after He had provided atonement for the sins of all who would by faith trust in His work on the cross.    John 10:17  "Therefore My Father loves Me, because I lay down My life that I may take it again.  18  No one takes it from Me, but I lay it down of Myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This command I have received from My Father."    John 3:14  And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up,  15  that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life.      16  For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.  17  For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved.  18  "He who believes in Him is not condemned; but he who does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	First of all you deny the two pillars of Christianity, the Incarnation (Jesus is True God and True Man) and the Trinity.

XN0cYCATaa	A Fabrication done so by an elite group of Scientist who's agenda is to fabricate evidences about the Origins of life on Earth to be used to destroy any religious influence, so as to have their so-called Atheist Utopia.  Not going to happen.    Edit: Who Created the Creator ?    If everything needs a creator, then who or what created God?                   This question is logically problematic. If everything needs a creator, than no matter what exists, it must have been created.  Furthermore, to be created means that someone or something had to create it.  But then, who created the creator and so on?  Logically, this would mean there would be an infinite regression of creators and we would never be able to find the first, uncaused cause since, by definition (the questions says that "everything needs a creator") there wouldn't be any uncaused cause.  This would mean that the sequence of creations is eternal.  But, if it exists that there is an eternal regression of creators, then who created the infinite regression of creators?  Remember, the question presupposes that all things need a creator -- even the eternal sequence of creators -- which becomes logically absurd.  Furthermore, if there is an eternal regression of creators that are eternal, then the question is not answered.  In fact, it cannot be answered since it weakness is that "all things need a creator."  Of course, this only begs the question in that how did the process begin? Therefore, the question only raises the same problem it asks and it is a question that, by its own design, cannot be answered.  Therefore, it is invalid.       The question is better phrased as a statement: "Everything that has come into existence, was brought into existence by something else."  This is a more logical statement and is not wrought with the difficulties of the initial question.  In the revised statement "Everything that has come into existence," implies that the thing that "has come into existence" did not already exist. If it did not already exist but then came into existence, then something had to bring it into existence because something that does not exist cannot bring itself into existence (a logical absolute).  This pushes the regression of creators back to what we would call the theoretical "uncaused cause" since there cannot be an infinite regression of creators as discussed above and since in infinite number of creators would mean there was an infinite number of creations and created things including things that cannot be destroyed since they would constitute things that exist.  If that is so, then the universe would have had an infinite number of created things in it and it would be full.  But it is not full.  Therefore, there has not been an infinite regression of creations.        By definition, the Christian God never came into existence; that is, He is the uncaused cause (Psalm 90:2).  He was always in existence and He is the one who created space, time, and matter. This means that the Christian God is the uncaused cause and is the ultimate creator.  This eliminates the infinite regression problem.       But some may ask, "But who created God?"  But the answer is that by definition He is not created; He is eternal.  He is the One who brought time, space, and matter into existence. Since the concept of causality deals with space, time, and matter, and since God is one who brought space, time, and matter into existence, the concept of causality does not apply to God since it is something related to the reality of space, time, and matter.  Since God is before space, time, and matter, the issue of causality does not apply to Him.|`|0hSpsSByaa	There are basically three theories of creation for Christians.  The first is straight creationism:  the Genesis story of creation is exactly how it happened, over 7 days, and the scientists are wrong/incorrectly interpret evidence, etc.  The second is that God created the universe over a far longer time period than 7 days, that time for God was not limited by man's concept of  7 days, but that man did not evolve from earlier species but was His final creation.  The third group believe in evolution but believe that this was God's way of creating the world, that the Genesis story is early man's interpretation of God's creating the world, but the manner of creation is not as important as that God did it.|`|WUjlEuTtaa	The same as what it is for everyone else..SOME Christians just happen to disagree with it.|`|usfVqbajaa	evil - lution  delusion  a deceive from satan    and many more...|`|ZFEORLAfaa	well no one knows for sure  so its all theory's|`|6354f9b17eeb910a803f8ef20a4505afaa	Man thinking that he is smarter than God.  Micro is adaptation.  Macro has never been proved.  What does evolution have?  God says kind produces kind.  Kind doesn't produce something completely new without man manipulating genes as is the mouse with an ear on its back.  This happened during the time before the flood when the fallen angels were producing the Chimera and satyrs-half man/half beast.    God destroyed the first world for this reason because the fallen angels were polluting the bloodlines of men and beast.  Noah was the only perfect bloodline for the Savior to come down through.    Have a blessed day!|`|mAE7vbX6aa	Since you've already told us you are atheist, I won't go down the baited road and give you scriptures.  I'll try to give you my views on evolution.  First of all, anything which scientists refer to as "theory" is just that.  Unfortunately, most Christians won't do the same for "creationism."  I believe that adaptation occurs.  It occurs all around us, but I personally draw the line when it comes to human beings going so far as to change into a whole new species.  It has nothing to do with my personal distain for the whole business of evolution.  Honestly, my God can do anything he darned well pleases and if adaptation is in the mix, so be it.  Where were my ancestors when He laid the foundations of the world?  I don't believe they were in the trees.|`|vwZvxNevaa	Trust me man you aren't going to get nothing but hell from this question.

How can anyone think that we're just some mistake and a few chemicals in space just collided, and bang hes life.    Also, where did those chemicals come from?

They must of had a creator.|`|XTyAMS5yaa	I  honestly hope that Armor of God is joking....but if they're not....then I wouldn't really be too surprised that some people actually believe that.|`|5KdPRKIVaa	A theory.

But Darwin's theory of evolution means that all living things are descendant from a single-cell organism.  The fossil record shows that this is not true.  But atheists use Darwin's theory as proof that God does not exist. If all living things are here by chance, God didn't create us. If God didn't create, then God does not exist.  There has to be a first cause that has always existed; otherwise, nothing would exist. Self-creation is impossible; something cannot do anything before it exists. Something cannot come from absolute nothingness. Something that comes into being is an effect that has to have a cause. Only God would have the mind and power to create the universe and all living things.|`|QMbaeva9aa	No, you fail.    Religion = faith. Faith = unprovable.    Evolution is a theory.

Put on the Full armor of God usually gives answers that give me reason to pause... What happened here???    1. You cannot fabricate evidence and call yourself a scientist, to do so makes you a con-artist and nobody likes to be conned.    2. If this is a ruse it is one hell of a successful one. Pope Jean Paul II wrote an article to reconcile the differences between the bible and evolution. The man himself accepted this as a valid scientific theory.    3. We already have sub-science fields which are directly spawned from this theory of evolution. Forensic Science, Biology and even predating the theory animal husbandry. With so many subcategories producing usable results the theory MUST be in part real if not entirely.        Regardless... There are a great number of Christians who accept evolution, you are targeting mostly Americans with this line of questioning.
urIm4YaBaa	A lot of work has been done on the question in the field of comparative religion:  Rudolph Otto's "The Idea of the Holy," Emile Durkheim's "The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life," and virtually every work by Mircea Eliade... all deal with the question of why every culture has an instinct towards a belief in higher powers.    More contemporary explanations are that people needed a way to explain observed phenomena and that we have a tendency to assume an agent-based cause. As a result, we assume that personalized beings cause the things we observed. While this argument certainly makes sense, I have yet to see a shred of evidence demonstrating that it must be the case. After all, could not people adopt certain spiritual beliefs, and then later explain natural phenomenon through this preconceived spiritual framework?    Some argue that we have an instinct to believe based on evolution--for some reason, believing in a god is either good for an individual's survival or reproduction; or it was good for the group to have these beliefs and practices. Unfortunately, that would make Atheism very intellectually and intuitively unsatisfying; I, as an Atheist, should feel an instinct to make supernatural guesses about the world. I don't feel that drive, but I also don't think it proper to assume that this should qualify me for study by abnormal psychologists.    The end results are:  1 - We have a lot of educated guesses; and:  2 - There may not have been just one reason.|`|cByRtCC9aa	To truly be free, we must eradicate need.|`|AA12341690	As an atheist, and I'm not poking fun here, not everyone feels that need.   I used to, when I was doing a lot of spiritual exploring. However, in recent years I've come to terms with the idea that it's just us here on the planet and I've become okay with that. In fact, it's rather liberating to know that the only ones judging you are fellow humans, and we don't have to accept their opinions. I no longer worry whether or not I'm on the "right path". My choices have direct, rather than spiritual consequences.  Just live and do no harm.|`|xopIi2Vfaa	yes, people have thought about it. It's a fairly recent research field, so there is not too much definite about it, but there are people who study why there is religion and why people value religion so much.     One book which isn't bad to get some feel for thoughts in that direction is "religion explained" by Boyer. Though it never really explains anything it goes through various ideas and if you never thought about it can get you started thinking in this direction and researching more about the subject.  I haven't read Darwin's Cathedral, but it's probably a worthwhile read:   http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1...    If you google evolutionary value of religion there is an increasing number of books on the subject.    The pervasiveness of religion indicates that it has a value in the survival of humans, the diversity of religions in different cultures indicates that it doesn't matter what spiritual system you believe in.|`|O9WVH9yhaa	There are some cultures and religions which have no deity controlling anything in the now or the here and after.

Most all of us have been there and you will too.... Lets just say that if you are in a car wreck and you or your child is in a life or death situation, will you grab a book to figure out what to do, or will you call out to God for help and protection? Itis just in our nature deep down in our spirit and soul to yearn for something greater and bigger than our selves. Like it or not. We need God. Why do you think they call it faith. You have to have faith to believe. Faith by definition does not require proof. If you are looking for proof, then good luck to you when something terrible happens to you in your life, because believe me it will. Then who will you call out to? Science? Proof? or God?|`|3QyKVYBwaa	There is neither 100% certainty of a "God/s", or 100% uncertainty.

You answered the reasoning in your question, and that lingering feeling that something or someone is watching us is ingrained in all humans (we were once prey).
f5IcUlXTaa	Yes, and it is awesome!|`|2VNmxfgpaa	Yes!  I reached that point 25 years ago.  I've always believed in listening to God ever since. Good for you that you have figured this out too.  And you know you can trust it!    I've thought about this question too, over a long period of time.  I've come to see that all the great spiritual teachers, including Christ, listened to God.  Where else did the Bible and all holy books come from?   I'm not saying that listening to God isn't for ordinary people, because it's for everyone.  But don't be surprised if your voice inside mirrors wisdom that you later read somewhere else.  Things like "to thine own self be true".    I've also thought about the faculty of intuition and the inner sixth sense.  I have come to believe that everyone has this, and its main purpose from our loving God is to provide for our communication with God.  To pray and to listen. God gave us free will but also a way to know the Divine will.  If we follow the Divine will by our own choice, then we evolve as human beings to the point where we are consciously partaking in the highest good.  That really cannot happen without free will.  And it cannot happen if we do not listen to God.    Don't put any stock in that voice being an *entity*, for the only entities you must worry about are those living people trying to pull you against what you know in your heart.  If you ever wonder about it, ask, "Does this voice give calm, rational truths that could stand the test of time?"  Of course, if you receive those insights than surely you have nothing to fear except not listening.    I am really happy for you.  Blessings :-)|`|PYD9JyIzaa	our ideas and god's ideas r very different ask the lord to reveal it to u - your answer may come from another person a dream or something u read or see - u ask how can u be sure it is of god - if it does not match up with scripture then it is not from god - pray and search his word - peace be with u|`|WbaN6osZaa	We all have a voice within us.  It's our unconscious gut feelings based upon life experience and genes.    When we start ascribing those feelings to 'supernatural entities'...we enter a whole new world of delusional.    You see, a rational person knows that feelings of (say) love and hate are largely controllable, and our unconscious mind, our 'little voice' is simply a part of our mind that we choose to listen to or not based upon many reasons.    When you throw away that knowledge and begin to truly believe the little voice to be 'Gods'  'Demons' or whatever, you are effectively entering into some kind of mental illness.

Maybe open up the Bible, so Romans, or Psalms, and read His word.     I've done this several times: Pray, ask God what you need to hear or see for your passion to be restored. Then maybe open the Bible - God may have a certain verse picked out just for you, and if you have faith, I know He will guide you right to it.

It sounds great for youth. It's so inspirational. Also, try these verses out:  Luke 12:31 "Seek the kingdom of God above all else, and he will give you everything you need."  Gal. 5:6 "What is important is faith expressing itself in love."  That last verse I feel is a summary of the Bible in one sentence.  It  helps to think less of ourselves and reach out to help others more, to take the focus off of ourselves. Volunteering outside the church to help the poor is good and maybe the youth group needs some of this too. Had a pastor who said that if we just kept taking the message in and didn't go out and express it, we would just get stale and lose interest. Has the youth group done any outreach in the community? Car wash to help the food bank? Helping to serve the poor at the soup kitchen one Saturday?

f5IcUlXTaa	Here is a good place to start.  http://www.carm.org/witnesses.htm    Satan can appear as an angel of light.  They add just enough truth mixed in with manmade logic to come across as being truth.  But it is in error.  Read the bible for yourself, asking the Holy Spirit to open up the true meaning of the scriptures for you.  God Bless.|`|wRBfUgI2aa	The most important one is the Bible.  Your own copy or any other.  Ask us any question you want.  We will answer from the Bible instead of what you normally will get from others--their own view or what is popular.    Did you notice in the literature how every time a statement was made that there were scriptures referenced in ()?  That was for you to look up to verify for yourself this was true.    Too, historians are also refernced like Josephus, who documented much of the history we know today.  Other articles are quoted from newspapers, encyclopedias, reference books that can be looked up.  However, these never replace the Bible as primary source material for what we believe.    The reason our beliefs are different from other religions is because in interpreting what the Bible says, we allow it to interpret itself.  What we mean by this is in reading a scripture to appears unclear, we look to other scriptures that explain similar things.  This is clear difference to most religions who rely on what was told to them for a hundred years or dreamed up by the reader.    For example:  Rev. 14:4 speaks of the 144,000 as "virgins" and "without blemish".  Most people explain this as being literal Jewish virgins.  Is this true?  Most of the Bible speaks of men as leaders of a family.  Would this not exclude most from being virgins?  What other explanation is there?    2 Corinthians 11:2-4 mentions "chaste virgins" as those who have shed themselves of all false religion.  Further, James 1:27 shows the worship God approves is clean & undefiled, with no spot from the world.  In other words, without blemish, clean.    So these would be only pure worshipers of Jehovah in the way He approves, not necessarily our personal manner or desires.  That doesn't mean all JWs either.  These have been chosen since after Jesus began a new covenant with his faithful followers back after Passover, 33CE.  In Luke 22:28-30 he showed this covenant was for them being with him as kings & priests in heaven.  JWs as an organization has only been around since 1880s.  So all along since 33CE, there have been faithfully followers of Christ in worshiping Jehovah.  Not tons, but a few all along.    Now does this make sense to you?  Certainly a better explanation than "Jewish virgins" and it is agreement with the rest of the Bible.    Fortunately for the rest of us, that 144,000 group is not the only ones mentioned.  Rev. 7:9 shows a 2nd group "a great crowd which no man was able to number"  Not as some of low mental ability claim "could not count that high", but a number without definite limits.  An open ended number.    Any way, this is how Jehovah's Witnesses get our beliefs.  We believe in the Bible.      Clearly Jesus is our leader, not any human.  He is also not God Almighty, who is Jehovah.  Simply ask yourself, who was Jesus praying to?  If it was himself, why pray?  Also does this not imply mental instability, this talking to yourself and expecting an answer?  The Bible makes plain that Jesus and Jehovah are separate individuals.  Jesus by what he has done is a god in hios own right now, although not the Most High God.

cd2etz5Raa	The world was perfect as Heaven is - the Lord even walked in the garden of Eden,     Genesis 3:8 (NIV)  "Then the man and his wife heard the sound of the Lord God as he was walking in the garden in the cool of the day,"     - - -    All of that changed when Adam and Eve acted on their temptation and sinned. The thing is that when they sinned, they opened the door to sin and it entered the world, thus setting it apart from Heaven and making it a little more like Hell. It also was the one thing separating us from God, which is why He sent Christ.     In Moses' time, people were asked to sacrifice animals and lambs as vindication for their sins, but God sent Christ in place of the animals - He sent Christ who was the one, true, perfect and blameless lamb, and because He was blameless, his blood had the power to set us free from our sins.     To answer your question, Christ's blood is what allows us to be forgiven for all of our sins, but we have to ask for and then accept the forgiveness. Christ's death did not close the door to sin, it's still wide open, but His death is what allows us to have our sin washed away.    Take care!!!|`|AA10819407	I am just going to refer to your topic line...

On the other hand, Jesus is like a good father who died and left us a rich inheritance that not only frees us from the enormous debt that Adam burdened us with but also provides enough for us to live on eternally. Jesus' death is not simply a cancellation of past sins; it is also a wonderful provision for our future.    Why did God require the death of a perfect man? Well, what was Jehovah God's penalty for Adam if he sinned? Was it not death? (Genesis 2:16, 17) "The wages sin pays is death," wrote the apostle Paul. (Romans 6:23) Adam paid for his sin with his own death. He was given life, he chose to sin, and he died as a penalty for his sin. (Genesis 3:19) What about the condemnation that the entire human race came under because of that sin? A death was needed to atone for their sins. But whose death could justly cover the transgressions of all mankind?    God's Law to the ancient nation of Israel required "soul for soul [or, life for life]." (Exodus 21:23) According to this legal principle, the death covering mankind's transgressions would have to be of a value equal to what Adam had lost. Only the death of another perfect man could pay the wages of sin. Jesus was such a man. Indeed, Jesus was "a corresponding ransom" for the saving of all redeemable mankind descended from Adam.1 Timothy 2:6; Romans 5:16, 17.      ACCORDING TO 1 John 3 verse 8     For this purpose the Son of God was made manifest, namely, to break up the works of the Devil.    Jesus will fix all the problems created by Satan|`|AA10988107	AS IN ADAM ALL DIE EVEN SO IN CHRIST ALL MADE ALIVE    1Cor.15:22 For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ   shall all be made alive. 15:23 But every man in his   own order: Christ the firstfruits; afterward they   that are Christ's at his coming. 15:24 Then cometh   the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom   to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down   all rule and all authority and power. 15:25 For he   must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his   feet. 15:26 The last enemy that shall be destroyed   is death. 15:27 For he hath put all things under his   feet. But when he saith all things are put under him,   it is manifest that he is excepted, which did put all   things under him. 15:28 And when all things shall be   subdued unto him, then shall the Son also himself be   subject unto him that put all things under him, that   God may be all in all.    2Cor.4:3 But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that   are lost: 4:4 In whom the god of this world hath blinded   the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of   the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God,   should shine unto them.      Luke 22:3 Then entered Satan into Judas surnamed Iscariot,   being of the number of the twelve. At Jesus first coming   a kiss identified to his enemies and he was put to death  to ascend to the right hand of God, Acts 2:27-35, to wait  for Satan and his unholy angels to be put down on foot  stool earth underfeet, Rom.16:20, of the raised up holy,  John 6:39,40,44,14:3, Mark 13:27, to be with Jesus.    Heb.2:9 But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than   the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory   and honour; that he by the grace of God should taste death   for every man.  Heb.2:14 Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of   flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the   same; that through death he might destroy him that had the   power of death, that is, the devil; Rev.12:3,4,6,7-12, So  Satan is cast down and the heavenly are raised up to be  with Jesus at his 2nd coming, Rev.20:1-6,12,13, THEY ARE  WITH JESUS AND NO SATAN 1000 YEARS.|`|3EudCWEuaa	Um, I see your problem. Jesus DIDNT have to die, he CHOSE to die for our sins. He had the choice to sin, but rejected it.    The sins of the father do not go to the son.

Maybe leprechauns made the universe!      "Suppressed Correlative"  A correlative is redefined so that one alternative is made impossible.    Example:  CHRISTIAN: The brain of a honeybee was obviously designed by God.    ATHEIST: You must not invoke the supernatural. That's not science. You must find a natural explanation for the complexity of the honeybee's brain.          I can continue. Do you want to see more?

His teaching was meant to have every human on earth to hear, know and believe.    Not only did Our Lord never refer to the "bible" anywhere at any time, but the word itself, the "bible" does not appear in the Bible.  Let alone "the bible alone."  And yet for hundreds of millions of Protestants, "the bible alone" is the Rule of Faith.  But since the Bible does not say this, they must get this rule of faith from a source outside the Bible.  What is the source?  Where do they get it?  From fallen-away Kathol-ics.  Apostate Kathol-ics, an outside source.  But to have another source of truth apart from the Bible, contradicts and defeats the very principle that "the Bible Alone" is the source of truth.     Furthermore, it is reasonable to expect that if Christ intended that all men should learn His truth from a book, the Bible, He would surely have written that book!  And He probably would have commanded that His followers  LEARN TO READ as a fundamental principle of His religion.  Certainly if Christ had intended us to learn His Truth exclusively from a book, He would have spent a considerable time talking about that book.  Or at least He would have spent SOME time.  Or if not spending SOME time, He would have at least made ONE REFERENCE TO THAT BOOK, as the only source of truth.  But whereas, He spoke very often about His Church, His Kingdom, He did not say one single word about the Bible!  Neither did He write a single word that we know of.  The exception may be when He wrote the sins of the Pharisees with His finger upon the dust.      But if Christ did not write the book that was to be the only source of His Truth.  If He did not do it Himself, surely then He would have commanded the Apostles to do so.  And yet we find no evidence that He commanded them to write anything.  Instead, He repeatedly and most emphatically commanded them to PREACH the gospel, and to preach it to all nations.  There is one exception.     The one exception is the command that Our Lord gave to the apostle John after His Ascension into heaven, and this command to write is contained in the last book of the New Testament, the Apocalypse, called now by "misleaders", the Book of Revelation.  Here is the interesting thing though.  That while some "misleaders," grasping for straws to prove that the Bible alone is the source of truth, cite this particular text, in order to prove their point, the fact is that their founder, the founder of Protestantism, Martin Luther, did not believe that the Apocalypse was divinely inspired.  He rejected the Book of the Apocalypse as part of the inspired scriptures.  In addition, he also rejected the Epistle of St. James, The Epistle of St. Jude, and the Epistle to the Hebrews.  In his 1522 Preface to the Book of "Revelation" of St. John, Martin Luther wrote this--these are his words:  "I say what I feel, I miss more than one thing in this book and it makes me to consider it neither apostolic nor prophetic.  I can in no way detect that the Holy Spirit produced it.  My spirit cannot accommodate itself to this book.  For me, this is reason enough not to think highly of it.  Christ is neither taught nor known in it."    Therefore, save for the singular word which Christ wrote in the sand, Christ, who is God, never authored His teaching, but preached orally to His Apostles and Disciples and to the Samaritans (Gentiles) who would hear Him.     The Apostles spent their lives preaching the Gospel of Christ.  From Judea to Spain and to India.  Everywhere they went they established local churches, commending Christ's Doctrine to faithful men who should be fit to teach others.  They did not spend their time passing out bibles.  Some of them did write, and the Church gathered those writings, together with writings written by other than the Apostles, into what came to be known as "the Bible."  But when they wrote, they wrote to particular congregations or persons and on particular occasions.  The ancient Fathers of the Church tell us that St. Matthew wrote the first Gospel for the Kathol-Christians of Palestine at their request.  St. Mark, who was not an Apostle, wrote his gospel at the request of the Kathol-Christians in Rome.  St. Luke addressed his gospel to an individual person.   The people and the clergy of Asia Minor asked St. John to write his gospel in order to affirm the divinity of Christ against the heretics of the time, who denied it.  Thus the gospels and the epistles do not purport to contain a complete and entire presentation of the whole teaching of Jesus Christ.  Indeed, St. John says in the very last verse of his gospel, "but there are also many other things which Jesus did, which if they were written, every one, the world itself, I think, would not be able to contain the books that should be written."  John 21.      Our Lord, Himself, testifies that there were many other things to be revealed to the apostles after His Ascension into heaven, and hence, were not included in the gospels by the in|`|R8yelFG7aa	As was stated, that is circular reasoning and therefor not valid.    The fact of the matter is the existence of God can't be proven.  It can be suggested, supported, a person can find reasons to believe, but that's what it is- belief, faith.      Someone who believes in a god or gods doesn't do so because a book told them "This is the truth".  They may think the way a book tells them to, they may think the book is true too, but the belief in God, Goddess, or gods is based on personal experience.      My experience tells me that a spiritual "world" or "layer" exists.  I don't expect anyone else to believe that based on my word, I just know what's real to me.  My experience also tells me that the core of Christ's teachings- real love for self and others- is truth.  When I seek God, I find Him, and I can't deny the reality of His love for me.  I don't believe because a pastor once told me that God inspired the Bible and what the Bible says is truth.  I believe because it's evident to me, in my life, that I personally am a better, healthier, happier person when I live according to the teachings of Jesus.    So far as logic arguments for the idea that one deity exists and that deity is the God described in the commonly accepted "christian" bible- Ockham's razor.    "entities must not be multiplied beyond necessity"    If the information offered by Christianity to explain existence based on one God and the characteristics ascribed to Him can adequately account for... well, everything, then it is logically unnecessary to assume multiple gods exist.|`|wzxrvTmdaa	God's plans is love for mankind, revealed through the Bible, through (good) christians, through churches and through miracles.|`|AA11849917	You're rant is downright silly.  No.  You do NOT have your reasoning correct!  DUH!    There is plenty of evidence for God's existence outside of the Bible.

uhIeM5y7aa	HE is speaking to Jesus as Jesus has the power to create through the father.  It tells you straight up what it means. It doesn't need interpretation. Many theologians like John Calvin and Jacob Armedimium and others say other wise.   Just pray for an answer instead of asking man. If you still question there are plenty of answers in the bible.  The question is not what your asking but maybe you should ask why he is creating.God always has a plan.There is a reason that God and Jesus are creating the earth.  The last verse says it all    Job 38:1-7   1 Then the Lord answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said,    2 Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge?    3 Gird up now thy loins like a man; for I will demand of thee, and answer thou me.    4 Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? declare, if thou hast understanding.    5 Who hath alaid the measures thereof, if thou knowest? or who hath stretched the line upon it?    6 Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? or who laid the acorner stone thereof;    7 When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?      if you have further inquiries email me|`|eLedl03Naa	Actually what he said was, "I want to see jelly fish control land sea and air."|`|6296beaabcf8f4682bfa047d500f8e9aaa	Presumably the same gods he was talking about when He said, in the ten commandments:    You shall have no other gods before me    Which suggests there are other gods.

No one can possibly understand the Spirit we call God. Mere mortals have invented religion to make money.

If all people in this world would realize that religion is a Man Made invention we would have universal peace. But  children are brainwashed into believing the religion fairytale and grow up to carry their beliefs to their children. So all the religions will be carried on perpetually and we will Never have world peace.

Schools are good -- plenty of churches.  Lots of stores. Utility bills in the south are less for a year than in the north because we don't have the long cold winters.  Seldom have ice covered roads -- so no need for chains.

His magickal instincts told<br>   him that, if he wanted to entreat the Dark Ones to carry out his wishes, he'd best call upon them boldly, with conviction, as friends and companions, not quivering in their unholy presence."<br>   <br>  Page 97: "We don't have to kill our God: we don't wear the<br>  instrument of his agony and death around our necks."<br>  <br>  She says “our God”, so if Satan is an “archetype” why call Him a God? She is also comparing Satanists and xians; Satan is immortal and very real as opposed to the fictitious “nazarene” that is nothing more than a worthless stolen image from 18+ Pagan Gods such as Norse God Odin and Egyptian God Osiris. <br>  <br>  Page 103:<br>  "When you're faced with that decision, with that piece of paper in front of you, declaring your allegiance to Satan for all eternity, renouncing God, Jesus Christ, Heaven and redemption, you may find suddenly that you don't want to go through with it. That's good. You should find out. If you do want ton align yourself with those forces completely, and you know there is no turning back, you know you can pursue the delights of the flesh without repression. "<br>   <br>   Page 104:<br>    "It is also dangerous for people who take part of the philosophy and try to<br>   ignore the rest; adopt the liberation without taking responsibility. Or<br>   using Satan's tools to gain material wealth, then not giving homage to the<br>   Devil in some small way, in some dark subterranean grotto somewhere. Some of<br>   the most powerful men and women in history have freely given that homage,<br>   where no one would ever suspect, let alone discover. And their wealth and<br>   happiness increased beyond reckoning. But you have to take<br>   responsibility for your actions. As has been said, nobody rides for free."<br>  <br>  Page 109:<br>    "If you have nothing in particular you want to perform a ritual for, its perfectly understandable you may feel a strong need to ritualize but don't actually know why. If that's the case, develop your own kind of Dedication Ritual, to renew and reaffirm your strength and alignment. Open the ritual as instructed, then instead of reading one of the three suggested invocations, speak your mind freely. In speaking directly to Satan himself, you may discover what is in your subconscious that you can't quite bring to the surface. Express appreciation for the direction you have received from the Dark Lord and ask that he continue to guide you to further increase your earthly power - - you might want to write out part of your Dedication ahead of time, to spur your thoughts once you're in the chamber. Ask that he bestow ever-increasing wisdom and perspective so that you can carry out your Dark Will on the Earth. Instruct the demons you name to manifest<br>   themselves to you by increasing your earthly pleasures."<br>   <br>    Page 110:<br>   Keep yourself constantly aware of instructional coincidences, open to the demons who will whisper in your ear. An old meaning of demon used to be 'muse' - - a guiding, inspirational spirit. You will get guiding signs if you only make yourself sensitive to them."<br>   <br>    Page 111:<br>    "Our standards, Satan's standards, remain consistently high."<br>   <br>  The above quotes are only a few. There are so many major discrepancies. The "archetype" image is an insult and a blasphemy to Satan. Satan is *very* real!! Those who have opened their souls and are respectful and willing, may establish a relationship with the True Creator God of humanity who *IS* Satan Himself!!|`|Shi5z6iJaa	pick up a copy of Anton Szandor Lavey's The Satanic Bible it's still in print and The Satanic rituals: A Companion to the Satanic Bible|`|kOoCya9Oaa	So you are saying that you want "to turn" to something that "dont really mean anything"<br>  <br>  Sigh
urIm4YaBaa	Not all settlements had the same procedure. Some grew fantastically based on resources that propped up in the area (for example, Oil City, Pennsylvania). Others became important trading and manufacturing areas based on being at an easy-to-reach place among many needed resources (for example, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania). Some had cheap land, which was bought, developed, and promoted for good use (such as Orlanda, Florida). Others are simply a place where specialized services can be centralized for use of a larger, rural area (such as Zanesville, Ohio).    Some are natural harbors (historical Carthage), some are highly-defensible positions (historical Jericho). Some were pre-planned and highly specialized (such as St. Petersburg), but most grew "organically," gobbling up other villages that were established nearby (such as Chicago).  All of these will increase the local population, lead to the establishment of businesses, which brings in more services to provide for the workers.    But *how* it happened "historically" is a huge question, and it's largely dependent on the 'where' and 'when' you're referring to.|`|YZdTBWoCaa	Population growth is a human condition.|`|CiY9Tkf6aa	It's all about trade and having value, things like raw materials in your town.

She is good at organising things that need to be done, knows where to go and who to talk to in order to straighten out taxes, accounts and stuff like that.She's also very polite, pleasant and easy to work with, so it's not like she's ordering people around.    She kept our congregation's accounts for years, and now she's training someone else to do it. Whenever there's a knot in the red tape, people go to her. She can explain things to you in a few words and make it all clear.|`|AA11232725	Niv Romans 12:8  if it is encouraging, let him encourage; if it is contributing to the needs of others, let him give generously; if it is leadership, let him govern diligently; if it is showing mercy, let him do it cheerfully.     KJV Romans 12:8  Or he that exhorteth, on exhortation: he that giveth, let him do it with simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that sheweth mercy, with cheerfulness.      Barnes Notes on the Bible    He that ruleth - This word properly designates one who is set over others, or who presides or rules, or one who attends with diligence and care to a thing. In 1Th_5:12, it is used in relation to ministers in general: And we beseech you, brethren, to know them which labor among you, and are over you in the Lord;     1Ti_3:4-5, 1Ti_3:12, it is applied to the head of a family, or one who diligently and faithfully performs the duty of a father: One that ruleth well his own house;     1Ti_5:17, it is applied to elders in the church: Let the elders that rule well, etc.     It is not used elsewhere except in Tit_3:8, Tit_3:14, in a different sense, where it is translated to maintain good works. The prevailing sense of the word, therefore, is to rule, to preside over, or to have the management of.     But to what class of persons reference is had here, and what was precisely their duty, has been made a matter of controversy, and it is not easy to determine. Whether this refers to a permanent office in the church, or to an occasional presiding in their assemblies convened for business, etc. is not settled by the use of the word.     It has the idea of ruling, as in a family, or of presiding, as in a deliberate assembly; and either of these ideas would convey all that is implied in the original word; compare 1Co_12:28.|`|tManvxfQaa	GOD is the ONLY Head or Administrator    If anyone else is trying to be...its not of God !!|`|yk7jmSnDaa	well administration is leadership. it's pretty much the samething.

6D2jlvgkaa	A contented man is an Optimist . I am greatly contented with what I have . I got my contentment from my learning from the Bible . I Praise God for the things which He has given to me so far .Also I thank God for the things he has not given me so far .And also I thank God for the things He is going to bless me with in the future .     I am so happy over my death also .It is the Entrance for my Real /  Eternal Life after the so-called death .I welcome it with a heart always overflowing with Happiness .   It will happen not before , as well as not later than the time appointed by God . I can't hate any one on earth . Hatred will spoil ones health as well as peaceful sleep . But so far I have no such problem .     Once , one of our Yahoo friends scolded me as," bastard " in the Yahoo Answers .That word is still their in my Yahoo Answers site. It caused me much pain .Yet I can love him also as equally as I love my thick friends .Of course , he did like that  because I know well that he has not attained the maturity I have attainePersonal remains  my duty to forgive him and to love him and pray for him .     I  love the animal kingdom too . I love the  vegetation also . Every day I water some plants which gives me great pleasure . Of course ,helping others gives me great pleasurexpecting understood anxietying to others  ( or ) helping  others is the very formula of Happiness . I  feel the presence of the Almighty Holy God and His personal assistance , His Company and  Security to me every minute .     Of course I have nothing to worry over on earth . I am of the strong faith , that I have a soul within me which is immortal . As the Bible suggests , I have confessed all my transgressions and sins before my Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ ,and have been assured of my persoanal Spiritual Salvation which leads me to the Eternal Life with God the GOOD , the wonderful Creator of heaven and earth and every thing seen and unseen .    .I have got a maturity to love even my so called -enemies ( if any ) and to help them even . I never pass by without inquring about the well-being of my enemies too.Some people may hate me for my principles .In stead , I don't have a heart to hate them for their principles . I do hate the idol- worship which is foolish ( and which cause great damage to a nation's economy also ) , but I do never hate the idol-worshipper ,because I should not hate him .I am expected to hate sin and not the sinner .    I have got the maturity to consider every one as my brothers and sisters . I consider younger women to be my own sisters and all the older women to be my mothers  .I don't covete anything which belongs to others . Thus I don't develop Desire or anxciety for anything which doesn't belong to me .. Hence there is no anxciety , greed , and consequently  no disappointment in my life . Since there is no disappointment , I have got the oppartunity to be happy always . I am always surounded with some young men  who are so eager to hear from me .I do help others daily, ( of course ) some people within my capacity and limit ( irrespective of nationality , colour ,religion or linguistical difference) .I am a Christian . I am matured enough to love both the Catholics as well as  the Protestants equally .I am an Ecumenically- trained believer .I find nothing wrong in the Bible .But I can't appreciate all the practices of the Christians .  I don't know any national differences too.    Not that I love the Cricket players less , but I love the soldiers more , because they safeguard the nation in the cost of their precious lives.It will be great Injustice on my part if I don't love the soldiers properly ,but  always appreciate the cricket players. I am able to Love the whole humanity equally . Above all , in spite of my tough teachings, I am able to love people of all religions equally . Of course I wish every one to know the Truth which has Changed me to be such a man with no Desire ,and a Victirious man whose mind always is overflowing with Peace, joy and  and serenity .      As I have said in my Profile , I love TRUTH more than my Life .I know well the fact that any one who is afraid of his Life can never preach the TRUTH . So I remain a man to face death 100% happily any time .Death is the Entrance to take me in to the Eternal Kingdom . As every true Christian is doing  , I am also  expecting with great anxciety for the Second Coming  of my  Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ .     " The LORD is my shepherd   I shall not be in want ."  ( Bible : Psalm 23:1 ).    " ...  He grants sleep to those He loves ."  ( Bible  : Psalm 127:2b ).    " Do not rebuke an older man harshly ,  but exhort him as if he were your father .  Treat younger men as brothers ,  older women as mothers,  and younger women as sisters ,  with absolute purity ."  ( Bible : 1 Timothy  5:1 ).      " Behold , I am coming soon !  My reward is with me ,  and I will give to every one   according to what he has done .    I am the Alpha and the Omega ,   the First and the Last ,  the Beginning and the End ."  ( Bible : Revelation 22: 12 ).    " Repent , for the kingdom of heaven is near ."   ( Bible: Matthew 3:2 )    " Repent and believe the good news ."
