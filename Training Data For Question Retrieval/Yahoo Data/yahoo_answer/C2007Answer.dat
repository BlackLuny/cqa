DxoodgOtaa	maybe,<br>  maybe not. it really all depends on what they can get outta the phone without the sim card.
Wx6QaBtUaa	Yes, only on Amazon, unless you want used ones.<br>  <br>  If you are considering to buy one, I suggest you to check the actual customer reviews below to have your decision. In my opinion, it worth.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Freview%2FB00154JDAI%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref%255F%3Dcm%255Fcr%255Fdp%255Fall%255Fsummary%26showViewpoints%3D1%26sortBy%3DbySubmissionDateDescending&tag=querystr-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=390957" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?i...</a>|`|5Wie7d3caa	The Kindle is manufacturered and distributed by Amazon.

CD0JesQeaa	Well just like here in the US, you cant send text messages to anyone outside the country. You have to have a special package to be able to do that. Call you cell provider and ask about it.|`|ZWaRNMzVaa	Well I never been that far away from my friends......(I think, Is Indiana and North Carolina that far???)  Well since you got your phone in Canada it wont be long-distance texting!|`|DxoodgOtaa	sorry but your mom is.
R9AAhsIjaa	I don't know much about the Go Phone packages but you can probably call their customer service line to get some answers to your question about Instant messaging. <br>  <br>  As for the Pantech Slate, my sister has one and it has been a great phone. It's stood up to so much abuse from her one year old and has been dropped repeatedly but still works as perfectly as it did the day she got it. It's so sturdy and functional. Good pick!|`|DxoodgOtaa	yes you will because internet is really expensive and it takes up a lot of money on a go phone in a very short time.
DxoodgOtaa	maybe your phone is uncapable of picture mails.
DxoodgOtaa	call your service provider.
Ho3lRmDMaa	The dvd should have an s-video output or standard RCA jacks (red, white, or yellow. If your TV doesn't have either one of those inputs you may be out of luck.|`|AA11513207	This depends also on your DVD player as it should have some information in the manual on what channel to set on your television.<br>  <br>  BTW - does your TV have RCA inputs for audio/video or ar you using a really old RF connection?<br>  Details, please!
Da5s2ZbYaa	I bought a spare charger for my chocolate on ebay for a few bucks. I would do that. Insurance usually covers just the phone I think. I didn't get the insurance.|`|ft8t98Pnaa	Your charger inst under your insurance...just buy a cheap one from Walmart.... <br>  <br>  maybe if you payed your bills on time they wouldnt refuse to replace your phone... you shouldnt be the one sounding ungreatful....your the one that owes THEM money|`|DxoodgOtaa	if they wont replace the phone becvause of money, chances are they wont replace the charger either.
MvvKMAtmaa	Nope. Besides the US, I think you can only get sidekicks in Australia.
7Zw1cEmPaa	You have a loose earth connection
gWlmU1KJaa	get vlcplayer for your dell inspirion<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/" rel="nofollow">http://www.videolan.org/vlc/</a><br>  <br>  that gets around the region issue for dvds on a pc<br>  install that<br>  put in dvd, cancel out of the default dvd player<br>  start vlc, and go to media- open disc
oSVN0Bbyaa	no<br>  i do it all the time.<br>  i lay out on the trampoline and put a towel under me and then slide my ipod under the towel.<br>  its all good nothing will happen as long as it is not in the suns direct rays for more than 20 minutes|`|7RziqsDcaa	no, people will just think your a qweeeeer if you do that and you're a guy, that's all.|`|5aoAcXDGaa	Are you kidding??? HOW would and ipod melt before you burn to death???<br>  <br>  Believe me. You can leave your ipod in the sun. Nothing internal will happen but the sun tends to eat things up so it might make your outside of the case more fragile. Just leave it in a shaded place for safety :)|`|UW5i6biIaa	No it won't. If it's covered by a towel it should be grand, but i wouldn't risk leaving it out in total sunlight, it'l probably melt|`|lggL1TFjaa	i think it could get over heated <br>  so keep it inside / in shade when not in use<br>  and in shade when in use if possible ie under sunbed
z88IMXNFaa	No.  Physical damage is not covered.|`|5aoAcXDGaa	No. That is not a hardware/software problem. Your out of luck.. THEY might be able to fix it for some $$$.. But they will not fix it for free|`|FqLR9CUJaa	Short answer: no. <br>  <br>  Long answer: the care service will only cover manufacturing defects so damages due to accidents or improper usage are not covered.
GHAnm9ayaa	True dat man. Even when my phone doesn't need charged I just stick it on there, that way I don't have to borrow someone elses.|`|cc3GVUZKaa	When I get home, the first thing I do is charge my phone to my desk (iPhone). But the only down side is that people call me and I never hear my phone ring. But when I go to bed, I always have my phone charging. So in the morning, it's completely charged. I love my iPhone.|`|8RflQ9DVaa	Generally because that is just indicative of their personality. You know.. the friend that is always late, or always forgets something. People like that drive me crazy. It's usually the really simple little things too. But if it wasn't for them, how could we go on about how together we are!? ;o)|`|5aoAcXDGaa	I dont do that.. I charge it at work or when i have time. Just because idk. Im lazy. BUT other people feel like they use power all night long and rather not do that. <br>  <br>  I kinda agree with that. SO idk<br>  <br>  But i carry my charger everywhere and have a car charger with it so im good :)|`|ef1nQpSJaa	Leaving it plugged in will charge it up then start running the battery down again, so leaving it on overnight reduces the battery life and can reduce the battery life.|`|xXXUEfNwaa	i have my phone charging at nite <br>  its plugged into the wall next to mi bed <br>  and ya its always charged|`|MvvKMAtmaa	I don't know why your friend does it, but my friend apparently got a tip from a Verizon wireless worker that it's best to use up all the energy in the battery before charging it again, but I kno thats not true.<br>  <br>  And by the way, I kno people say that charging it overnight is bad for the battery life, but it really isn't. It won't overcharge, so if you turn your phone off, when fully charged, your phone will just turn off, and won't use power.|`|YArPv9WFaa	i have such a busy life almost never still in one place thats its not even laziness but forgetfull.
A7foKkGKaa	sound gernade
J0Ie3XJmaa	Unlimited double minutes means that every time you add airtime to you phone, it doubles. So if you buy 60 unit card, you actually get 120 units.<br>  1 unit = 1 minute. Also you can use promo codes, they give you extra bonus minutes.<br>  Text messaging cost 0.3 units for each text message.|`|62bdfaff99eb94891a0098fdd62fe168aa	Lifetime double minutes are as long as you have that Phone (and it can be changed to a different phone if you keep same number) you get double the number of minutes on the card.  If there is a special promotion (such as you buy a 120 minute card you will get 20 free minutes )you get double the card plus the bonus (so in that case you get 260)<br>  I don't text so can't answer that part.

LoQCk9wxaa	I myself like the second generation, because it has better games and more features, but also, it has a built in speaker so you don't have to use the ear buds. If you love games then it is the one for you, because it is touchscreen and you tilt the ipod for different things, overall it is the best.|`|Z8g2MZUkaa	Yes, it's very good. I, myself, own the iPod Touch and I would say it's by far the best music player on the market. There are so MANY features on the iPod Touch soo you'll never get bored with it.  You can search the web, check your mail, go to the itunes & app store, use the calculator & much more ! I LOVE my ipod touch(: It is worth every $200<33
AA12400533	they will give you the same phone you had|`|y1Yl6p9Qaa	They will make you go through the insurance company Asurion, and they will send you the same phone and it will more than likely be refurbished.|`|Jci78CbRaa	yes
Og3OGzgKaa	see you have have to understand it was the era she grew up in . us as teen grew up using the new tech. of texting while texting was something rarely used . she knows thats if just faster to call but then again texting is just the new generations way of communication <br>  .. it drives older generations crazy . i guess its cuase they have no one to text . unlike my mom . it used to drive her crazy till we put textin on her phone now thats all she uses :)|`|7G0n3junaa	Because she is older than you, and for a big part of her life, there wasn't texting. Texting might have been around you for a big part of your life since you're only 13, so you're used to it, unlike her...|`|AA10531094	You'll understand when you're older and the younger people are using more modern technology.  They'll probably drive you crazy.|`|J0Ie3XJmaa	Why you don't play with your dolls anymore? Because you grew up, you are not a little kid, and playing with dolls it is not interesting for you.The same is about texting. Texting is not something you really need, it is a kind of entertainment. It is not interesting for adult people because they grew up, they are not teenagers anymore, they have other things to play with. lol|`|7b9d806206db51285e9ebed3c58d7ab0aa	I agree with her. I guess I'm old fashioned too. I'm very slow at texting and I like hearing peoples voices. Voices reveal more about a person than text.|`|zTQaREymaa	Older people think about things like spelling, grammar and correct punctuation.|`|YMXdE0Vzaa	Because she's old.<br>  Kinda like how I'm only 17 but I ******* hate all the new Poke'mon **** but love all the older ones.|`|WX1g8lcxaa	The simple reason is, without sounding old, today's youth have very little mental stimulation, therefore in general, dumbing down. I don't want to sound rude, but it would have been unheard of for a 13 year old to have such bad grammar and spelling which is so evident in your question when I was your age. As a consequence of this "dumbing down", young people have less and less social skills and try and avoid direct contact wherever possible. When I was 13, only about 3 of my friends had a mobile phone and if we wanted to contact each other, we would call each other at each other's homes. It's just what we're used to. So young people have effortless and far-too-easy ways of communicating, and that's what young people are used to. <br>  <br>  I could ask a similar sort of question saying "Why do younger people have no manners?"<br>  <br>  It's a sign of the times.|`|olen08R9aa	its because they are older and texting is a sort of new thing to them, also they dont understand sometimes in general because they are a different age group and stuff, im thirteen too but i know what u mean, i text alllllllllll the time|`|getWVUJlaa	because back in the day they didnt use texting.<br>  plus people take advantage of it now a days like crazy.<br>  im a teenager and i text but after a while it gets boring, annoying, and i get lazy.<br>  xD|`|ONX0TikLaa	its beause older people cant keep up with the pace of txting u need to move your fingers fast and older people have artheritus and stuff making its ore difficult to move their finger fast .. or maybe its somthing to do with their old mentality|`|oaT0G6g3aa	They prob think its so much easier to just talk on the phone but I agree, texting is sooo much easier.

HVQFVtelaa	I answered a question the other day about a 5 year old JVC player that had broken, and expressed my surprise that a unit with that logo would break that soon, and made my suggestions.<br>  <br>  Another fellow stepped in and proclaimed that JVC was junk, that Panasonic was much better, he got best answer. If he had said Technics was better, he would have made the same mistake.<br>  <br>  You see, JVC makes both Panasonic, and Technics, and they all share JVC technology. In fact, equipment with the JVC logo was the most expensive, and had the best technology. Technics was the mid-price label, and had good technology, but not the best.<br>  <br>  Panasonic was JVC's low-end price label. The hierarchy still applies. Jvc invented much of what we take for granted today in electronics, but few people know. They invented VHS recorders; every single VHS machine ever made was made under JVC license, all with JVC technology.<br>  <br>  Personal preference in speaker sound is your decision, they are the vocal cords of your music, but never doubt JVC quality. Mitsubishi stereo has a good name too, well deserved. We have forgiven Mitsubishi for inventing the Jap Zero that bombed Pearl Harbor. Both companies were born in the same era.<br>  <br>  Have you ever seen the old RCA Victor logo with the little black and white dog listening to the antique Victrola record player? JVC stands for the Japan Victor Corporation. Many, many years ago RCA victor was born out of JVC technology and bought the rights to use that logo in the US.<br>  <br>  To this day JVC holds that logo in Japan. That should give you an idea how long they have been making fine stereo equipment.

oJuD20CSaa	I spent about an hour at AT&T store buying a new phone the other day. I switched from an iPhone to a Propel, I considered a Pantech, but according to the salesperson, Pantechs aren't very good. I'll take his word for it considering the Pantechs were more expensive. <br>  <br>  I'm liking my $50 Propel so much and it has trumped my old iPhone in a few ways, I actually hubbed about it so I hope this helps.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://hubpages.com/hub/My-iPhone-is-Now-an-iPod-as-I-PROPEL-into-the-future" rel="nofollow">http://hubpages.com/hub/My-iPhone-is-Now...</a>|`|AA12400533	propel matrix has slide up keyboard problems

The worst thing to do is not answer the phone. They are the police, they have access to cellphone numbers. This is another reason children who are immature should not have a phone. All you had to do was tell the 911 people the phone accidentally dialed the number, I'm sure it happens several times a day!!!|`|AA12400533	do u happen to have th iphone cause it happens with that phone just tell them that it was by accident and you werent trying to play around just explain what happened
LsLVHj9Maa	If you can defend your case probably no.<br>  <br>  And if your phone is doing that you need a new phone lol, or at least get it repaired.|`|z88IMXNFaa	For a first offense, the police will waste their time, come out and make sure everything is ok and give you a lecture.  After the first offense, you risk a fine.|`|BwloAPMraa	if you call 911 you can't hang up.

LhbESYD4aa	I'm right along with you! I've been watching reviews, unboxings and all that good stuff on youtube. I've looked at all three phones. I really like the LG Incite. The LG Vu and Samsung Eternity is aimed mainly toward people who want to watch the mobile TV, plus you pay extra for having that feature even if you don't use it, no what I mean. So I'd go for the LG Incite. The Incite is a smart phone also, so that's cool! But if you don't want to just go and buy the Incite right now, you could always test drive each phone, At&t's 30-day trial. I'd recommend sending all the phones back before the 30 day mark hits just in case they don't let you return it, or whatever the case may be! I hope I helped!
vNwgUggyaa	Try washing it? Just get an eye glass cleaning wipe or something.
M7i30zP6aa	Unfortunately, there is no way just to password protected the contact list only.  And even if you set password to protect your phone, there is a hard reset to get it back too.  That's just the way it is for phone and really not much you can do about it.

It simply works  by the power of the AM signal.<br>  <br>  Somehow, either your stereo or your speakers acted as simple radio receivers.|`|EMC7JwVBaa	CB radios have been known to sneak into the darnedest things, such as toasters, tooth fillings and church PA systems. AM is like that sometimes- especially when peaked out to higher than legal output.

cxNLOPHNaa	Typically rebates, in general, for any product/manufacturer take between 6-8 weeks to process. Rebates go through a third party clearing house to be processed. Most likely yours is still sitting in a mail bin somewhere in the building. They just haven't gotten to processing yours yet. You should receive your check around week 10-12.<br>  <br>  It's also worth noting, your check may not be in an envelope. These days most rebate checks are printed as a postcard. Many people often accidentally toss them out as junk mail.|`|kyTDQEWaaa	It takes forever.  They probably havn't even opened the envelope yet.  I think mine took over three months.|`|hLSIRDtZaa	LOL...Laughing so hard my stomach is hurting. Don' t you know that AT&T is in a financial crisis right now, they laid off a bunch of employees recently. They are one of the Blue Chip stock companies that might need a bailout. You're not going to see that rebate, they're going to keep that money to replace their company's debt. LOL AT&T might be going out of business like so many other companies that's been around for years. General Motors, Circuit City, Ford, Chrysler, etc. These guys have pocketed your rebate for themselves sad to say. Now if you want to contest it, you can go to the Better Business Bureau over it.
chHPoiThaa	O2 usually take between 1hr - 24 hours to activate your sim. This happens automatically and will not require your intervention in any way. This time period also depends on the number of new O2 users coming into the market as well.<br>  Try turning the mobile off and then on again. Most times this helps.<br>  If after 24 hours it still doesnt activate, you will either need to ring them on 202 or just get in touch with the retailer who sold you the Sim.

Yes.<br>  <br>  If not, it is a piece of JUNK.|`|PNB8ueIgaa	iPhone is user friend on WIFI but you have to connect to the place /spot where WIFI is available.  In Singapore most MacD and Starbucks are available and other shopping centres - dont know about other countries.<br>  <br>  Singapore is quite fluent with iPhone and it appears to surpass all other phones - iPhone is NOT the best but it has good programs but it jams just the same if you are not careful having surfed internet.  If you have jailbreak it, it becomes unstable at times and the telco is not happy with you or rather Apple is not happy!  Does anyone know how to DE jailbreak this program?  <br>  <br>  Be blessed by iPhone|`|wTwppABQaa	Yes it can. If you have one click on link to know how to use it.
H4f2dXVLaa	iPhone.  some apps you cant get on touch plus iPhone is iTouch with a phone.|`|PJZRGsc3aa	both are equal<br>  <br>  though the touch can't be used as a phone, and the iphone requires having AT&T and a date plan for the internet|`|COMOAbB3aa	Well in my fine personal opinion, I recommend the Iphone. That is, if your willing to pay that outrageous phone bill each and every month. I hear the Iphone does have more apps, of course you can call, and texting,internet, yadda yadda all of your features of your middle class phone. Although it has texting, I assume by reading about it and seeing it in person, it is a very hard phone to text with. The touch screen is very high class I hear, on both, which have several layers of protection and sensors. Although,  if you are a person who has no router, this may cost you at least another  franklin out of your wallet. But with the Itouch you can use the internet and such ONLY at places that have Wi-Fi. With the phone its everywhere. Of course, if you are not a big fan of AT & T, (believe me my mom can get worked up about these cell phones) you are out of luck with the Iphone. You are locked inside AT & T! <br>  <br>  So There's my opinion!|`|95f7247eb624aa87ba4619aeec8608ccaa	I touch is everything you would want in an mp3player.  Iphone is just the same but a fone.  Of course the fone has more features.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ao24nnuN9Tpbj_73mi8Lnh7sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090309145018AAAsYEf">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  ^^^<br>  American Idol Viewers click here!<br>  <3Nikkay<br>  Live.

My bill is roughly $122.00 a month.|`|iPpmhjR1aa	They're exactly the same. But iphone can call, text, and get on the net anywhere.  But it also costs more, and you have to KEEP paying for it, and you have to keep paying MORE if you want internet. plus you HAVE to have AT&T. whew! i'm happy with my itouch|`|fzLnapcZaa	well the itouch is the same as a iphone with the exeption of the camera and the phone part.<br>  so the iphones better|`|wEfjE2uPaa	well if you get the iphone you have everything an ipod touch has PLUS a cell phone! so that's a better choice if that's your preference.|`|7bYaVxRLaa	iphone<br>  its basically a itouch with a phone!|`|u7Vp848Oaa	Ipod Touch!!!! Definitely! They rock!!|`|brVj9ktDaa	iphone internet anywhere!!! oh yeah|`|Hk6wIgiOaa	I like my itouch, I heard its better but then again its not a Phone? Depends what you need???|`|hXnbGuxyaa	itouch .|`|ONX0TikLaa	in my experience ipod touch is better and a seperate phone.. the iphone is exactly the same as the touch just with txt phone and a camera. and the camera is only VGA you can get a LG viewty for around ￡90 with a 5mp camera and a touch screen so i recomend ipod touch over iphone due to u can get an better phone and an ipod touch for around \￡300 same price as an iphone .. but remember iphone comes with contract so you're better off with a seperate phone on O2|`|bpC7QiVaaa	The iPhone is of course better because it is a phone, but it isnt that great. Apple and At&t have a lot of hidden fees (not much though). The plans can get expensive. The iPhone does have internet access anywhere you have bars. The iPod Touch, though, is easier to keep up with (not as heavy, thick, and there is no phone bills!), but you have to have Wi-Fi to access the internet.|`|JYwvwDbKaa	If you get an iPod Touch, you will be able to intall apps, listen to your songs and do all the usual iPod related stuff.<br>  <br>  If you get an iPhone, you will get all that plus all the features of a phone.<br>  <br>  Depends on what you need or are looking for!<br>  <br>  I would get the iPhone, that thing is just amazing! It has everything I need on my day-to-day and will save me from boredom at times!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|fTcS9TJuaa	The Phone is better to my<br>  <br>   I own a iPhone and then got a itouch for xmas.<br>  <br>  But if your looking forward on buying either one.. Wait untill summer this year<br>  <br>  Its rumored that Apple will have an New iPhone thisyear by the 4th Quarter.<br>  <br>  The draw back about the new iPhone is that, for SURE it will be locked and you will need a two year contract.<br>  <br>  The current iPhones are still hackable/crackable and can be made SIM free<br>  <br>  <br>  My iPhone is SIM free (Thanks god, I hate T-Mobile NL)|`|6l8qLz0waa	ipawd touch because it dosent break very easily as long as u dont throw it on the floor and stuff. any how i phones break like crazy so i dont recomend them. iphones arent good for texters. uhm ipod touches have youtoube internet and the new update is texting. i highly recomend that !!!<br>  hope i was a help|`|iW3HJBe3aa	an ipod touch is great and its a one-time payment. But one thing about it is half the stuff you can do on it require wi-fi.An iphone is great becuase u get internet everywhere.But it is very expensive.|`|uMUqOWzKaa	if you need a phone, Iphone.<br>  If you just want an Ipod i think that the Ipod Touch will be better.|`|TjAszHWYaa	the iphone has more features but i like the Touch feature on the Touch but ud be better off w the iphone|`|GjGuy3bYaa	Get da i-phone the touch has small battery and brakes faster|`|wKxQEj0Zaa	ipod touch is okay it gets boring some times i bet iphone is better
EyP4d90Paa	I have an LG Vu. The screen is not squishy at all. I like the phone much better than the palm centro. The touch screen is very easy to use.
oJuD20CSaa	I had the same dilema but after trying out both at the AT&T store, I went for the Propel. I just came from an iPhone and I'm liking the Propel.

Nfmd335Maa	nope.|`|QoLL2ucGaa	The Sidekick 08 doesn't "just make noises." In order to have customized ringtones, you must buy them for about $2.50 from the Catalog. The Catalog is where you buy backgrounds, themes, songs, games, and apps for your Sidekick.<br>  I would prefer the Sidekick 08 because it is less expensive and you are able to customize it's shells. Also, the Sidekick 08 has a 2.0 megapixel camera and records videos.

pLCLtbtFaa	I'm sorry, but that's not possible. You must have calling minutes in order to get the unlimited texting. That's where they get you. I hate that. If you could have an unlimited texting plan without calling minutes, I would certainly go with that carrier!|`|z88IMXNFaa	No.  You need a voice plan in order to get texting.

You can just buy the phone at full retail price and pop your SIM card in.<br>  <br>  or<br>  <br>  2. You can extend your plan and get the phone at the plan price. How much you'll pay depends on how far into your contract you are, so it may or may not be worth it. A T-Mobile agent will check this for you and let you know exactly what you will pay.<br>  <br>  I know nothing about the Sidekicks; all the better reason to go to a T-Mobile retail center and check it out! LX's are pretty pricey though.<br>  Good luck!|`|UARTf9gPaa	you can just buy the phone and use it without having to get a new contract.<br>  <br>  but it will be insanely expensive.<br>  <br>  i have the slide, im getting a blackberry pearl though because my slide broke.<br>  <br>  my opinion, just stay with the slide, i LOVVEEDD that phone and dont know if any other phone could beat it.<br>  <br>  but if you insist on getting a new one i say get the sidekick 2008, the lx is too big and the 2008 has more features and is prettier.|`|6QwJKnXzaa	u have to buy the phone for full retail price and thats the only bad thing. then just pop ur sim in it and itll work. i recommend the g1 though.. i have it and its so awsome much MUCH better then the iphone or blackberry storm ( ive had all 3) u won't have to sign a new contract

bC5OAfs5aa	If those files on your iPod were wiped out, it's hard to get them back.

Unlocking is a tricky business and you may require continuing support which is not available with an unlocked iphone.<br>  I would suggest you to wait a little longer as the prices of the iphone are set to go down..
Ur6H8gwkaa	If I'm forced to pick between the two, I'd pick the one lens deal and here's why.<br>  <br>  On the 2 lens kit, you've got the 18-55mm. The 18mm end is a fairly wide shot. But 55mm on the long end is a bit short. 55mm would be about 2x or 2.5x on a compact camera.<br>  <br>  The next lens 55-200mm  The 55mm is too long for any kind of a wide shot. 200mm is nice and will reach out far. You'll be changing lenses a lot to get the shots you want. That's a huge pain for a casual shooter.<br>  <br>  The one lens deal covers the wide shot on short end 18mm, and the reach is decent on the long end.<br>  <br>  <br>  The better thing to do if you have your heart set on this camera, get the body only for the best price you can. Next, start looking for a 18-200mm (give or take) zoom that will cover that entire range in one lens. <br>  <br>  Now, there are pros and cons to doing such a thing, but for a casual shooter, it would be fine, plus no having to carry around 2 lenses and dealing with lens changes. You could miss a shot doing all that. <br>  <br>  Look into Nikon, Sigma and Tamron to see what they carry and for how much that might be a better way to go.
dZjkuw74aa	well the only way that i see you can try it is if you try hooking is up and going to my computer and seeing if your device is there. <br>  i have tried this before and i am pretty sure it is not possible.<br>  the only other way is to bluetooth the music to your phone.<br>  otherwise you are going to have to but a package from verizon.<br>  which will probably be around $10-$25|`|PNB8ueIgaa	first you must have the driver installed in your computer before you can do anything.<br>  <br>  after that, I believe you can just drag and drop unless your phone has program that requires conversion of the music file to one acceptable to your phone like iPhone

SAvpk6Isaa	I have the IPOD Touch and I seriously recommend it to everyone I know. It has almost everything you will need in everyday life and has millions of hours to keep yourself occupied. It's expensive, but very much worth the money after the first few days, even hours. :)
xbQhnEzuaa	it depends  on what ipod touch you have. if u have the 1st gen ipod touch then jailbreaking it would be really good. you could be able to customize the theme and put on moving wallpaper. you could even play some greats games like mortal kombat deadly alliance on it. but if its the 2nd gen ipod then its not worth it just as yet because there isnt an untethered jailbreak out. this mean that if u jailbreak your 2nd gen now, every time u take ur ipod off it wont come back on unless u connect it to ur computer and follow some steps to get it to boot back up. plus it voids ur warranty.
yWU57CLYaa	I just got the lg versa, here are my pros and con's of the phone.<br>  <br>  Pros,<br>  So simple to use, very user friendly.<br>  Love the detachable keyboard.

6Jj4eH0yaa	Option 1: Duct Tape.  Wrap that ***** up so tight it will never come apart again!  On the downside it may make the touchscreen unusable.<br>  <br>  Option 2: Hot glue.  Smear hotglue on your kitchen table and gently place the 17 pieces randomly within it.  Once all of the pieces are firmly set within the glue, completely encase them with more glue. This is to protect them in case the phone gets dropped again.  The glue is clear, so you should be able to see the screen.  (Quick tip: Use a sharp pin or needle to pierce the hotglue so that you can interact with the touch screen.)  Note that the hot glue will melt when the temperature rises so you may want to think about moving to Syberia or somewhere where the temperature does not get very tepid.<br>  <br>  Option 3:  Super Glue.  Once you have the phone back together think about super gluing it to your hand so that it doesn't get dropped again!

Insert your iPod to your computer USB or FireWire port. <br>     2.  If iTunes is already installed and prompt a message on whether if you’d like to associate this iPod with this computer and deleting its content, click No. Or else you will lose your only copy of library on iTunes. Beside, ensure that ‘Enable Disk Use’ is selected.<br>     3. Open My Computer or Windows Explorer, the iPod should be automatically detected as a portable hard drive.<br>     4. Click on the iPod icon or the iPod portable<br>        hard drive letter to open the contents of the drive.<br>     5. If you don’t see a folder called “iPod Control”, it’s hidden and invisible. To unhidden it so that it’s visible, go to Tools -> Folder Options -> View, and then check (enable) the option “Show hidden files and folders.”<br>     6. Open the “iPod Control” folder, and then the Music folder.<br>     7. The Music folder contains the iPod’s music and videos, divided into folders. Copy the library to local computer hard drive’s My Music folder.<br>     8. The files copied have unintelligible four-letter file names. To reveal the names of the songs and other data tags, add the files to the Windows Media Player or iTunes libraries or switch to “Tiles” view in Windows Explorer.<br>     9. Rename the file if necessary.|`|eDO63azOaa	if the other computer has itunes all you have to do is plug it in and open itunes and make a new playlist and drag the songs into the new playlist|`|0tJx6OZraa	On your new computer try re downloading itunes and i believe it should automatically sync into itunes.

aimzj38faa	Unless you paid extra for the extended coverage when you bought it, then no. No standard coverage includes theft, that's your own fault.|`|Uzzv4FYZaa	I doubt if the factory warranty covers theft.  If you (or your parents) have homeowners insurance or personal property insurance, you can probably recover something at least.|`|63e4b2a381a37a2a4e488d966800a454aa	No, the warranty does not cover it if it is lost or stolen. Homeowner's insurance would cover it, but you would have to meet the deductible first.
MEFs0PGGaa	I own a blackberry flip and I love it.|`|F0uLexezaa	iphone is the best phone i've ever had. you must use AT&T and also buy the data pkg|`|ZtECjEPyaa	i recommend the blackberry because the iphone isn't as good as people say it is. one day, it will start going really slow and even freeze up.|`|QDNKGA0Jaa	Well it depends on what you like. I have friends who have iPhones and they love them. They have plenty of features and pretty much an unlimited application store. My friends have SO many applications that make the iPhone so much fun. The reason for the WiFi is that some places don't always give you great service, in these cases they might have wifi which is much faster than any service the AT&T can give you. Even when you have service in places like restaurant and city parks, wifi is always a plus to have if available. Also the iPhone doubles as an iPod which is great too.<br>  <br>  The blackberry storm is probably the closest you will get to the iPhone with a blackberry. The problem with it is that it still has many features of other blackberrys. So therefore it is still targeted towards business people who need the applications. One of the good things about the storm though is it is on Verizon, which is the best service provider in the United States. But it still lacks much from the iPhone. it does not have much in the way of an MP3 player and up until recently does not have an application store.<br>  <br>  So pretty much, i suggest the iPhone. You can still look at your emails with it and at the same time get the plus of apple support and the huge app store. Only thing is you lack the verizon service.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps =)|`|DkYGl11naa	I would say black berry...it will allow you to send your emails to the device...if you have the 4.5 OS you will be able to see the emails in HTML. If you have the BB 4.5 OSS you will also get Docs to go ....Word, Excel, and Slideshow to go thus you will be able to view and edit these documents on your Black berry .....not so much create unless you buy the upgrade. The keyboard would make your life easier in regard to typing emails....I know the BB can hold at least 4 emails accounts....I did it before but took two of them off...became to much for my preference since so much junk mail came to two of the email accounts....if your into to typing and instant messaging then the BB I would say would be more preferable since it has the qwerty keyboard....if you just more to surfing the internet and entertainment such as music etc then the iphone would be better in my opinion.|`|oRRVpkXHaa	I have heard good things about the blackberry so i would say go with the blackberry.|`|EpGk9v9haa	Well im 13 so if you want disregard this. The storm has no Wi-Fi and around 60 dollars a month for internet meanwhile the Iphone has internet but from what ive heard much cheaper internet services. For college though the Storm has better multitasking capabilities so it may be a good idea to look into that.

ycv1tk1gaa	I had the same dilemma but when I asked the man at the Sprint store about getting the Instinct I was informed that you had to have the data plan. So if you don't have the data plan and you don't want to be on the internet I would go with the Lotus. The Instinct's keyboard is really hard to type on also. I have the Lotus and love it. It is really easy to text on and has a lot of storage for your inbox.|`|cUP8PmRIaa	I have the instinct great phone but its more for internet. The lotus would be great for what your wanting it for.|`|3UN8jBrbaa	First, you don't need a phone at 11 or 12. Second, LG for the winner.
PNB8ueIgaa	This is one of the better phone and yes you can send pictures either as MMS and email..enjoy yourself.
1HtTxOOQaa	I don't see that happening any time soon. It could happen only if a company bought the other one.. But we all know even thats not going to happen. I always thought that why not create a single console and so all manufacturers can create games for it? I mean I own all 3 and imagine how much money I have wasted in buying all 3(wasted meaning spent and not literally wasted). I would even pay more than the price of a PS3 to buy if there was one console out there. I mean I had to buy a 360 just for playing Gears 1/2 and that is silly. I had to buy a Wii for my smaller bro but I can say it's money well spent cause it's Fun at least for now.<br>  I always considered the PS3 to be my cup of tea. It has or will have better games than the 360 and the Wii (hardcore gaming), it has all features I need to make it my media centre...<br>  <br>  If ever the companies do decide to bring out a single console (again we can dream...), then I feel that they only need to mod the PS3 to get a mixture off the 3. The only thing I need from the 360 in a PS3 is it's online... (please no reliability from the 360...RROD!!!!) and the only thing needed from a Wii would be it's motion sensing controls (the PS3 does use motion sensing with it's six axis feature, but it's rudimentary). Other than that, Blu-ray games, FREE online,Wifi(all PS3 features), plus all games on a single platform so you don't die of jealousy that the other one has that game or that one... It would be the ultimate package. Well still it's just a dream.<br>  <br>  But I still would prefer 2 or 3 consoles in the market cause it creates competition and better games which further lead to prospects for a better game in the near future.Just imagine how a PS3 fanboy waits anticipating a major exclusive like Killzone 2 and wishes it kicks Gears butt and vice versa. If we had one console, that feeling would not arise and so it would really be dull. <br>  <br>  I also agree with the fanboy point you made(racist...lol). Sometimes they do get on your nerve. But still, the world would be a dull place without them(imagine PS3 vs 360 debate has been rated no 1 amongst all blogs and people actually make money off stupid fanboys fighting!!!).I always say it's personal preference. Buy what you want and stop influencing other peoples decisions.|`|ca1o8Ylsaa	First how can some one be racist to a console when Gaming System have no race???<br>  <br>  Yeah the only way we can stop these annoying fanboys are to ignore them and even if they are supporting your favorites console you can't support them or they will keep coming back.Also don't try to argue with them since they won't stop and its a wast of time since their fanboys and will never stop.<br>  <br>  Just pretend their not their and ignore them they will eventually leave. And it will get boring for them to even come.|`|C7rV71Cjaa	Hmm... interesting question. Though I have to say I don't wish that would happen and I know it will never happen. Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo are businesses and businesses like to make MONEY! And if they all made one console then they would have to share the money which means they would have to share equally and I doubt any one of them would want a third when they can try to get a whole with their own  console. It just comes down to the customer about who wants what. Though the problem is, that some customers love their console and see the other consoles and think "Man my console is the greatest, and if anyone asks me why it's because I said so!" and the console owner becomes biased. Though I feel that fanboys only rip on other consoles because they are jealous of what they're not getting with what they have already. See a PS3 owner might be jealous that a Wii Owner has Super Mario Galaxy and Madworld so they will rip on it for their PS3 not having it. A Wii owner might be jealous that they can't have an online service as awesome as Xbox Live so they will rip on the 360 for not their console not having something as great as Xbox Live. A 360 owner might be jealous that the PS3 is a blu ray player and can have games be up to 50GB in size, so they rip on the PS3 for their console not having that much tremendous size in space for their games. Fanboys are biased and being biased is not a good trait to have. It means fanboys will refuse to look at what's good about a console and think their favorite is the best. I've been called a Wii fanboy before but am I? No I'm not because I can see what makes people like the PS3 and 360 even though the Wii is my personal favorite. Do I ever feel jealous that I don't get Xbox Live-like service or a humoungous harddrive for DLC? Hell yeah I do but I look at my Wii and get happy by the thought of what I get that the PS3 and 360 don't offer. The point of this is that fanboys will be fanboys sometimes no matter what. The key though is fanboys, keep your untrue opinions to yourself and maybe we can all just get along.|`|381e3207230460fe8521d523304a91a6aa	Absolutely not.  If Sony, MS, and Nintendo merged and made one system, it would suck big time.<br>  <br>  It's this competition that makes it so great for gamers.  Each system is trying to outdo each other, and the gamers are benefiting from this competition.  <br>  <br>  If there's only 1 console, it can make whatever games it want, and if you want to play a game, you have to get that game.  It would be like the Atari 2600 days.<br>  <br>  What did you think cause the video game collapse in the 80s?  It wasn't competition.  It was no competition.  Atari ruled, and Atari just kept making one crappy game after another until gamers got tired of it, and just didn't buy any Atari or games.|`|ktbyKKK9aa	Racist to consoles? Wow. Anyway, they can't "morph" together. The 360 + PS3 will just create another PS3. The PS3+Wii+360 will make a PS3 with Motion Controls.|`|9VigolCZaa	I agree if they worked together they could do so much stuff, but instead there like Hey little kid you look smart buy a 360 instead of that baby toy wii

381e3207230460fe8521d523304a91a6aa	You probably can't.  You should have bought the extended warranty when you first bought your PS3.<br>  <br>  Extended warranty is a gamble.  Stores want you to buy it right away because odds are that you will never use it so they get free money.  But like all machines, the PS3 is prone to mechanical wear and tear so the older it is, the more likely that it will break down.  If it breaks down, GS will have to fix it or give you a replacement, and that's something that GS doesn't want to do because it loses money.  <br>  <br>  You can calling GS and ask if you get can the extended warranty, but my guess is that GS will say no.  |`|HXahRFKEaa	Calm down. lol.

6PAksNZjaa	usually you just left click on it and drag it over to your itunes library it should work.
HFuI8oVYaa	You need to set your camera to manual mode. You need to set your shutter speed and aperture manually and don't change them for the session. If left on any of the assisted (auto) modes, your camera may choose different settings between shots as you move your subjects and the shadows change. Also, beware of light reflecting off your body/clothes. It can change the lighting and color. Make sure outdoor lighting doesn't influence your lighting. Clouds and sun movement will also affect lighting if outdoor lighting is present.<br>  <br>  As previous poster mentioned, avoid using fluorescent lamps as they flash at twice the line frequency. Use incandescent and set your white balance manually. <br>  <br>  If you do shoot with fluorescent lamps, you can only shoot at 1/120 sec or an exact multiple of 1/120 (i.e. 1/60 1/40, 1/30, 1/20). If you're in Europe, you need to be at an exact multiple of 1/100 sec.|`|YmcURwDAaa	It sounds like you're shooting under fluorescent lighting. If you want to avoid flicker and weird yellow lines in your pictures, you need to select a shutter speed reciprocal with the AC mains frequency, or any shutter speed divisible by that number.<br>  <br>  In America, AC power is transmitted at 60hz. Shoot at 1/60, 1/30, 1/15, 1/8, 1/4, etc. You can go as low as you need to. You can't, however, go any higher. You'll see why.<br>  <br>  Alternately, try another light source! You can shoot at whatever shutter speed you want under a regular tungsten bulb. Try sunlight. Try the flash. Try a compact fluorescent. Halogen. LED. Whateva.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

pDcJGptPaa	Night shots are difficult. The simple answer is--Tripod. With the Kodak vs Coolpix flash issue, each camera has it's inherent flaws, and you have just touched on one of them. Nikon's preset flash values are different than Kodak, and you just have to adapt your shooting habits to your cameras abilities. That is why when you find something that works for you, keep it until it gives up the ghost.|`|HFuI8oVYaa	Night shots without flash on any camera requires that the camera be mounted on a tripod or benched (place the camera on a solid object like a table, wall, rock, ...) to minimize camera induced blur. Well lit means sunlight. If you are shooting at night in a house with lamps, that is not well lit.<br>  <br>  As to fill flash (yipee, someone who uses fill flash!), perhaps you can use exposure compensation to deal with the over exposure. See if your camera has a flash compensation adjusment (doubtful).

It has auto focus, a viewfinder, optical image stabilization, and uses rechargeable NiMH batteries.  <br>  <a href="http://www.imaging-resource.com/PRODS/A590IS/A590ISA.HTM" rel="nofollow">http://www.imaging-resource.com/PRODS/A5...</a> ...<br>  <a href="http://bountii.com/deal-1523871-canon-powershot-8-0-megapixel.html" rel="nofollow">http://bountii.com/deal-1523871-canon-po...</a> ...  <br>   <br>  You may never need expanded wide angle or telephoto capabilities, but the A590 IS is compatible with Canon's accessory lens adapters: A small button next to the lens bezel is actually a latch; press it and you can remove the bezel ring, exposing a bayonet mount for accessory lenses. Canon offers the WC-DC52 0.7x wide-angle lens, the TC-DC52A telephoto lens, the 250D 52mm closeup lens separately, along with the LA-DC52G adapter to mount them on the camera. (Note that the wide, tele, and macro lenses all need the LA-DC52G adapter to mount them to the camera. The lenses won't work by themselves.)  <br>   <br>  There is no one place to get great buys, but click the second link in the information above then search for your camera of choice at the upper left.  Camera prices at this link change often.<br>   <br>  What gives a camera its picture quality?  <br>  It is mostly the skill of the photographer that produces high quality pictures. The lens and camera are very important, but the ability to set the scene, adjust the cameras settings, and hold the camera very still or use a tripod with auto or remote shutter actuation when required is what gets the great pictures.  Megapixel resolution is about potential photo size, not picture quality.<br>   <br>  There are so many cameras out there it is difficult to say which is best, but the second source link will be very helpful as it list most of the cameras out there with prices. The following information should help you know what to look for in a camera.<br>   <br>  A friend asked me to clean and charge her new 2000mAh Duracell batteries as described in the next link.

Also, 2000mAh batteries seem to have a longer life.  Did not like these batteries at first, but have 12 over five years old and all are still as good as new.  Higher mAh batteries (about one year old) still work well in flashlights, but won't start my camera.<br>   <br>  CAUTION   Do not overcharge!  Batteries can be damaged.  Use an automatic two or more hour Energizer Compact smart charger with temperature monitor, trickle charge technology, and safety timer ($9.76) at Walmart.  Use pre-charged 2000mAh Duracell ($12.97) or RayOVac ($5.97) batteries (both hold charge one year) and a full cycle charge.

Have multiple friend with the wii. My opinion:<br>  <br>  Ps3- Excellent system. Many upsides. Free online, multiple usb ports (depending on your generation 2-4) Bluetooth capability, Blu-ray disc drive. Games come on a blu ray disc. Removable laptop hard drive on the side, so if you want to exchange your 80 gigabyte hard drive and buy a 720gb hard drive for music/movie/photo storage you can, in about 10 minutes. Some (games) will play in 1080p, which is the highest resolution TV's come in right now. Can connect to your pc to stream media. Older systems can also play PS2 games, which is a plus to most. Since the PS2 game library is one of the largest.<br>  <br>  Xbox 360- Best console for online. Xbox live, as it is called does cost money however. 12 or 13 months for about 50 bucks. Same games as the PS3, more often than not. Also more games than the PS3, currently. Can also connect to your PC to stream media (easier than the PS3 since it uses Windows Media Player, which most comps will have) Best thing the 360 has going for it is it's online community. Definitely the best that is out there. Has plenty of First person shooters game because of it, as well.<br>  <br>  Wii- Foreseeable where consoles will go in the future. Great interactivity. Great party system and an excellent system for a family. Unfortunately most of the games are the same. Definitely not a system for graphics lovers, as the Wii's graphics are not impressive at all. <br>  <br>  <br>  Short version<br>  <br>  Ps3- Media beast. Get it if you want something to handle everything you throw at it. <br>  <br>  Xbox 360- Online buddy. Get if if you want to play games online in an excellent community.<br>  <br>  Wii- Family Owned. Get if it you or your friends will be playing the system, great entertainment value.<br>  <br>  There's my 2 cents....maybe a bit more.|`|glMkfGpgaa	This should help you alot!!!Honestly:Well if your thinking about graphics than Wii is out of the picture<br>  My favourite is PS3<br>  Just look at the sharp points of each system:<br>  360<br>  Pros:<br>  Really good graphics<br>  Really Good online<br>  Not that expensive<br>  cool features coming out<br>  lots of good game<br>  Cons:<br>  online isnt free<br>  not enough disc space to make a really big game(GTA 4 was gonna be bigger though 360 doesnt have enuf memory on its disc)<br>  HD dvd is pointless<br>  They overheat and break easily though<br>  In one or more version it isnt even hd(lol?)also it goes at max of 1080i and upscales to 720p & 1080p<br>  The HD drive costs more than 100$(what the hell?)<br>  PS3:<br>  Pros<br>  LOTS OF DISC SPACE<br>  on blu-ray<br>  The blu-player is built in(360 HD isnt free its over 50$ + HD is dead!)<br>  Amazing 1080p graphics<br>  FREE ONLINE<br>  more of the features are free<br>  lots of good games such as MGS4(and exclusives)<br>  LOTS OF GOOD GAMES COMING/already OUT LIKE littleBIGPLANET<br>  Cons<br>  Online isnt good as 360<br>  games take long to develop<br>  price<br>  <br>  Wii:<br>  Pros:<br>  Controls CAN BE fun<br>  Brawl<br>  Cons:<br>  Honestly the Wii graphics are below normal(no offence)<br>  HORRIBLE ONLINE and barely any games have online<br>  not that much good games coming out<br>  games get watered down<br>  Not a descent roster of games<br>  Overall I think:<br>  Though 360 is doing best<br>  PS3 has by far the brightest future<br>  The Wii has the best controls<br>  PS3 has the best graphics<br>  360 has the best online <br>  Though the wii doesnt have that much good games coming out and the amount of good games coming out is less<br>  go on gamespot and check how much 9.0's wii games got<br>  and check PS3 and 360 also<br>  And the next console is probably coming out somewhere late 2011-2012(early to mid)The PS3 now has just has just as almost good games as 360 compared to 360(Remember the one year more)<br>  So overall you decide what you want<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Source(s):<br>  Have Wii and PS3 and played 360 alot and comman sense on 360|`|g91dQLBPaa	Wii.

VMVW3E7Aaa	People so often ask: "Which one is a good camera to buy?"<br>  Here is my 10 cents on the subject:<br>  <br>  Point & Shoot cameras are wonderfully handy because of their small size.<br>  When light conditions are ideal, they even take really nice photos - all of them do.<br>  <br>  However, they all DO have limitations - they don't do very well in low light situations  (i.e. noisy photos, hard to avoid blur, etc). The little onboard flash is very harsh at close range, and doesn't reach very far.<br>  Many of them have no manual functions, so you are limited to only very basic photos, you can't compensate for unusual situations, or do many fun "tricks" and special effects.<br>  P&S's  also suffer from  frustrating shutterlag and many of them chew through batteries rather quickly.<br>  <br>  However, if you're ok with all those limitations, then go ahead and pick one, most of them (the same type and same price range) are rather similar. Personally I would pick either a Canon or a Nikon, and would certainly stay away from Kodak. <br>  <br>  A higher end P&S will give you more manual options and better quality.  Many of those even give you the option of adding a proper flash (which makes a big difference to your flash photos).<br>  <br>  Don't worry too much about megapixels…. there is a limit to how many pixels you can squash into a tiny P&S sensor before you actually LOSE quality rather than gain it.<br>  Don't worry about digital zoom, in fact, don't EVER use it. It simply crops away pixels, i.e. destroys information. The only real zoom is optical.<br>  <br>  Decide which features are important to you, and look for cameras that have that feature. <br>  Then go compare a few models on www.dpreview.com  .  <br>  <br>  The very best thing you can do for your success is to borrow some books and learn about  photography.  A bit of knowledge will make a much bigger difference to your photos than your choice of P&S camera can.<br>  <br>  For what it's worth - if I was in the market for a P&S camera right now, my choice would be a Canon Powershot  SX10 IS <a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=ModelInfoAct&fcategoryid=144&modelid=17630" rel="nofollow">http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/contro...</a>|`|uJBnZWtcaa	If you have a camera store or office supply or Best Buy close by go look and handle a few of them to get an idea about what feels good in your hand.  Make a note of the ones you like then go online,<br>  <a href="http://www.dpreview.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.dpreview.com</a> , click on the Camera Database and scroll down the camera manufacturer and the find the model you're interested in.

0hbpCSwiaa	Heres the problem.....your computers sound card is what actually determines and sends the appropriate 5.1 audio to the speaker system to play.........the speaker system is not cabable of understanding the HDMI digital signal. So if you want this to work, first you need to figure out how to send the audio from your PS3 over to your computer which could then forward it over to your 5.1 speaker set. The computer has to work like an audio receiver to translate the digital audio into the analog channels of your speaker set.<br>  <br>  Simple answer: you can't do it unless your sound card allows for a digital input as well as an output. Even then, you would need the digital input on your sound card to be HDMI, otherwise, you would need an HDMI to Digital Coax converter and then adapt it over to 3.5mm
8213dbb28238df28f026dac640239fb1aa	No, the PS3 is not a computer.  In order to have surround sound with it you must buy a receiver/amplifier.  The PS3 can only send surround sound via optical or HDMI.  And once you do that you can't use PC speakers with it.  Sorry, but no surround sound without some spending.

3oKcNr3caa	the only difference between the 2 is the hard drive size, i'd say get the 40gb one and if you end up wanting more memory you can upgrade the hard drive yourself.<br>  <br>  I bought a 320gb hdd for my 40gb model, it only cost ￡50|`|0AUTZt5Aaa	80GB, since it is the same price as the 40GB and they don't make 40GB's anymore.|`|jxpV13rTaa	first guy is a little odd..dont listen to him theres nothing in that paragraph that is true. they are exactly the same other than memory. i would say get teh 80 gig, but if you dont think you need it then just get the 40 gig. both are unreal|`|381e3207230460fe8521d523304a91a6aa	If you're talking about the new 80 gb, then get the new 80 gb.  Why pay 400 bucks for the 40 gb when you can get the 80 gb for the same price.  The 40 gb got upgraded to the 80 gb.<br>  <br>  If you're talking about the old 80 gb, then get the old 80 gb because it has backward compatibility with PS2 games, has 4 USB ports, and 3 flash drives.|`|HX6JjCTyaa	I would suggest 80gb over 40gb which is older model.80 gb come with internet ready Wi-Fi and 80GB of hard disk storage for all your games, music, videos, and photos.|`|URpSHVF9aa	well it depends what 80gb ps3 it is<br>  if it is one of the old 80gb then it has ps2 compatible<br>  memory card readers <br>  if it is a new 80gb then all it really it is just double the size of a 40gb<br>  <br>  a 40 gb  (not produced any more)<br>  can play psone and ps3 games<br>  it has wi-fi<br>  and that is mainly it|`|3Tlq60FTaa	I would think an 80gb because it's not that much dearer than the 40gb and it's double the memory. Ok, perhaps you won't use that much memory but better to have it than not have it.<br>  <br>  I'm thinking of getting one aswell, Have fun !!|`|iFsl0iymaa	Absolutely not, there is no difference between the two other than memory capacity.  That goes for any system the xbox 360, ps3, wii, etc.  A 40gb is plenty unless your are a heavy gamer.  I have a xbox 360 and it is a 20gb and i have lots of game saves of around 12 different games and i have had it for at least 3-4 years and i still have only used half of the memory and i am considered a heavy gamer.|`|YhdfaEJVaa	You might as well buy the 80gb its the same price. A lot of people probaly don't need 80gb's. Some people probaly don't need a 40gb. But then again those people might not game that much. I personally have a 80gb MGS4 bundle ps3 and I have only 7 GB's left. I have about 30 demos, 600-700 photos, and about 10 or 11 game saves. And who knows how much mandatory game downloads on it. <br>  <br>  Does that make me a hardcore gamer. Let the public decide. I'm soon going to upgrade my 80 to 500GB and its only gonna be like $110.<br>  <br>  And for the person who naively said 80gbs have 4 usb slots, he is wrong. All ps3's in production do not have 4 usb slots. <br>  <br>  So basically buy a 80gb. Its better to have it and never need or want it, And never need it. With more and more games coming out the small amounts of mandatory downloads. And firmware updates I bet some time within this year you will need the 80GBs. Even if you only use the memory for demos and games. Within next year or so, your ps3 will be full. <br>  Just get 80. Or buy the 160 if you cann afford it <br>  <br>  And there is no major difference other then amount of Gigabytes.|`|dde6fe2179e353e51a4888e29baa2dd3aa	No difference other than memory. Trust me you don't need 80 gigs of space on a PS3. As for me, i'm a hardcore gamer, and i don't give a **** about the 80 gig, cuz the 40 gigs good enough for me.|`|wzA4GcWKaa	basically the 40 gb and the 80gb ps3 are the same system the only difference is the 80gb just has more memory and trust me you don't need all that memory so i say get the 40gb ps3.|`|eg1TaKZdaa	The 40gb PS3 is good for small time gaming and one or two controlers. <br>  The 80gb PS3 is good for hardcore gaming and 2+ controlers. The 80gb has media card slots and 4 USB Ports.|`|r2tdDVVjaa	lol its difference is the hdd not memory...lol....i have 80, and i dnt hve much on it....if u wanna putting stuff on it, 80, if not 40|`|fCxNAmBhaa	get the 40gb  them u can upgrade just buying the 120 HHD for  $79 dollars.

HXahRFKEaa	hmm..... It depends. The recent upgraded Itouch actually has comparable gaming graphics to the PSP.  Yet, on the 14th, there's a new PSP coming out (PSP-3000, announced at GC, & is unofficially nicknamed PSP-Brite), it'll have a little more RAM, it's a little lighter, is a little faster, has a better deign, & has a brighter screen.  I'd do PSP for graphics, but Itouch for controls.  Look at the websites, see what you think.  (Just so you know, Sony has made it really hard to hack the new PSP)  The new PSP will take the price of the Slim (PSP-2000), about $200.  Check out the below URL to see the first PSP-3000 pack available on the 14th of this month.|`|bdyiYMZLaa	ipod touch. its cooler.|`|I4VUPWAIaa	PSP is easier to hack and can do many things with custom firmware.|`|lA7K7Ny3aa	hmm...psp plays games and the touch has youtube which do u like?|`|0ad1f530b187d4324eabb37e3320c86aaa	Get the Ipod touch! much better.|`|g9NtnrqQaa	psp it can do a lot more stuff|`|XpTrLxIXaa	i would say the one that has more of what you want<br>  |`|jWY0lMu8aa	Your PSP will outlive your iPod Touch.

hE4CXKX2aa	Well it sound like you are dialing from a cell phone, so here is the gist of it.  <br>  <br>  Home phone (land line - POTS 'Plain Old Telephone System')<br>  <br>  1.)  any 800 or 866 number is toll free.  It would not really matter if you dialed the 1 before it.  It is free.  - But they can put you to a service where than can bill you for time, but you either need a credit card or a pin number for the time that you bought.  Like how phone cards work and such.<br>  <br>  2.)  and 900 number, with or without the 1. and it will cost you how much that number said in their ad or what not.<br>  <br>  3.)  Yes it should show up on the bill as a dialed number and how long in minutes it was.  But the can't show you is any number dial from that number as in from a phonecard and such.<br>  <br>  ---------------------------<br>  Cell phone usage - <br>  Depends on your carrier<br>  They could charge you the minutes you used, or not.<br>  Besides, the 900 might not be able to charge to your cell phone account if it is a prepaid phone as well..  On the 900 number, their system could or might not connect since they might not be able to bill you accordingly to the prepaid phone.|`|GiEinn85aa	Well, if that's a local number or a cellular, then yes. Any numbers that begin with 1-900 costs money just to let you know.<br>  Where's your location btw?|`|ZpsbW8gHaa	nah but nice joke|`|YMoOsKGCaa	yes it does. 1-866 is the free one. anything with 800 is getting your cash =]|`|hQv43Xhmaa	800 numbers are free, 900 numbers cost money<br>  <br>  and it depends if it will show up on the bill, if every number you call is on the bill then yes|`|m0QaQZhLaa	nah yo thats the point|`|ML3PGUPYaa	no.|`|166c6f22dd3296f7b76f56d6a0c35c12aa	no|`|7no23XV6aa	no|`|9G9g2G9Waa	yes it does|`|UAXHmqgRaa	I don't think so. I think all 800 numbers are free no matter what.|`|A8YUlTimaa	no i don't think so! it happened to me too, but i call wireless service provider and they reduced my bill! call them....|`|IkJmk1tCaa	It would show up on your bill as an outgoing number, but a 1-800 number does not cost money.|`|jgYcu3yHaa	No it doesn't, but that joke about the black person and abortion is really ignorant and awful. It's not funny at all.|`|OmkxSKTwaa	No it shouldn't. The one is optional in my opinion :) You can put it front of any number and its still the same number.|`|h9ZQjnANaa	Wow..Pretty racist comment you have there.."why"...<br>  <br>  No it's free.

YmcURwDAaa	Does it take other SD cards? If so, then yes, it can safely take anything up to and including 2GB cards. Some devices have problems after that. None of them have problems before that.
fWMat3xwaa	you could......but consider this, ...the e-bay seller may owe a balance when they disconnected and Directv wont activate until the account is clear, you ll have also spent $20.00 on a replacement access card, the dish you have now may need to replaced, only a 5 lnb slimline dish can be used for HD programming. This is a ka/ku band dish so unless you have the right meter it cant be peaked, Directv wont install your hardware but a local independent retailer will for about $65.00 an hour plus material, you could switch to Dish Network for free, if you are out of your commitment with Directv, they have far better DVRs anyways. What ever way you go, it will be worth it, even for $199. make sure to get the receiver number  from the seller and verify its re-deployment with Directv before bidding. avoid the older DVRs with Tivo they are the best ones but do not support mpeg 4, this is the most run-on sentence / all over the place answer ive ever given. ,,,congratulations

551b2184eb8b53e521be093fb04e526baa	Hopefully the television stations are within the limit of 40 miles as stated by the specifications of the LAVA antenna system.  Not knowing what type of antennas you have already tried, you need to install this antenna on the roof and preferably on a mast.  I use an 8 Bay Bow Tie antenna with a Channel Master preamp on a mast about 30 ft. high and I receive around 40 stations, including the sub-channels, from a distance of 75 miles away.  See link below.|`|ee97f3c7ffcf7d47dc6882e63330d45aaa	get a longer piece of pipe and hold down wires boost your antenna up higher into the air, the antenna will be able to see further over the horizon to see more distant stations. note that you are attempting to do what the tv stations cannot provide, that is longer range broadcasts, there is a huge difference between the new and old systems as to distance of the signals transmitted|`|a91fdc98672c951bb2b3dbcd91d1b581aa	Let me see?

I know because I've been in the same situation (I love all Crash games on PSX).

With burning it you would be able to play it on a PS1 or 2 (combined with a few swap tricks but I won't go into that here).  You can even get a USB to Playstation controller adaptor for a few pieces of change :P  To use ePSXe you also need to acquire the BIOS file but since there are legality issues I'm not going to provide a link.

6092c93e1782e8c065a3ec0605f82705aa	unfortunately their is no way to fix this as its not the xbox its the game developers, Dead Risings' text is rediculously small even on a 52" high def widescreen. i found it much easier to turn off subtitles if the game will let me|`|0060e98c7b965bc75c0cc7e4149e6123aa	Hmmm try chaning the screen resolution on your tv to make it a bit more zoomed. And is there any option in the Xbox settings to upgrade text size?
95e7980203768cfd8899c6ca563a13b3aa	Unfortunately it is putting movies and video onto psp isnt very easy. First you'll have to download a program for converting or even getting video's onto your psp. I looked around and i found that psp video 9 is the best, it is also free so you wont have to pay anything extra. You can get it from www.pspvideo9.com just go there and download the program. Once you install the program after downloading it, connect your psp and open the program. Go to setup and click auto find under settings and now it recognises your psp. If not then go to my computer and see which drive your psp is in and change accordingly. When your done opend psp video 9 then click copy and now you can upload your videos. If your videos are not in mp4 format then click<br>  convert and after that "one click transcode" then you browse your file and click ok now it should convert and then you can see it under copy. From there you just click "Copy to psp'' Dont hesitate to email me ;)|`|AA12219608	MUSIC<br>  <br>  Saving Music / Audio to a Memory Stick Duo?<br>  You can use your PSP? (PlayStation?

AA11061445	they will be deleted have you a facility on your computer to burn the music from your itunes library onto cdrw ,if you have and it wipes your music off your ipod you have back up discs,everything i have on my ipod through itunes is backed up on Cd's ,for that very reason,if it my ipod deletes the music  i put the disc in then burn it to my library then put it on my ipod|`|T2CRYKotaa	Sorry to tell you this but yes they will be deleted. They will not be deleted from your itunes library as soon as you delete them but the next time you plug in your ipod, you will be told they cannot be found and then cannot be sync'd to your ipod. I know exactly what you mean though, there is not enough space on my computer for all my music and the rest of my stuff!!|`|Sktb49Wmaa	I don't believe that it will be erased because I think that it makes another copy of the music file specifically for Itunes in AAC format|`|bQapeBDOaa	They will most likely be deleted UNLESS  you uncheck the "Sync" option. That usually deletes everything off the ipod and puts things on the computer back on to the ipod.|`|itT4K7DSaa	They will be deleted the next time you sync it.
bd15441c0920c617077ac1881d213472aa	Hi Kas<br>  There are a couple of ways to unlock this phone, I am assuming you are in the UK <br>  1) Most independent mobile shops or mobile market stalls should unlock this for about ￡10.00<br>  2) Contact your provider, there will be a charge but they will provide the subsidy code.<br>  To correct Tim on his post regarding the US law on unlocking, he has it all wrong. This law DOES NOT require a US provider to release the code upon request. In fact, they do not have to provide the code to you at all although they will as long as you meet certain requirements. The new law takes away any legality of the owner unlocking the phone making it legal for him to unlock it through whatever method he chooses.<br>  Cheers|`|rvtOlXMDaa	You can call your cell company and request the unlock code.  A law was passed and enacted late in 2006 with requires cell companies to provide the unlock codes on request.  They sometimes try to say you have to be out of contract, or you need to have the phone for 6 months - not true.  You can request the code the day you buy the phone.<br>  <br>  Check out www.copyright.gov.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|BtftDQmPaa	Yeaah just call ur phone company.. they would know how!<br>  :) ..does anyone know if this phone comes in black ??<br>   xox
bQapeBDOaa	That's just the sign to show that it's charging. And you probably don't have it set up for itunes to load automatically when you plug in your ipod. Just open itunes and it should be there. If you want you can change the option for itunes to open automatically|`|P6Vx2vgiaa	OK, that sign means its charging.<br>  And you're saying it won't start.. I think it froze<br>  To fix this, you must reset it<br>  <br>  Resetting Steps:<br>  1. Switch the "hold" button on and then off<br>  2. Press the "Menu" and "Select" button [the circle one in the middle] at the same time until the apple appears on the screen.<br>  -Hope this is helpful
S6Lxzsakaa	I Kinda go the same.. but on Intel Way...<br>  I can run it on High without any Problems but when i put it on Ultra High i got some lags...<br>  <br>  But that Computer sounds really AWESOME..

3d4f5fe4e80a20bc2f8cec55fcaf1cf7aa	nope, you may have to convert videos if they are not bought from the zune store, but there is free software to do this.<br>  <br>  buying new songs from the zune music store costs money, copying songs you already own does not.  songs you bought from itunes or the windows media player (or any other DRM) store will not play on the zune.|`|AA12097508	Nope it comes with an installation disc of the zune software, if u download videos on p2p programs make sure they are in mp4 or wmv only. U can download the Zune software if u want to give it a try..... It does not work with WMP|`|XPWDnL8paa	No, there are no addition costs. May I add that it is better than the iPod and it has better battery life than the iPod video 30GB. That's funny, because the Zune has a bigger, brighter screen, which should require more power. Like I said, the Zune is better than the iPod, but there are much better MP3 players out there.
IyhUZq0Caa	im afraid not. it has to be broken in some way.<br>  or you could just break it yourself =)|`|6skDWG5Yaa	no they will just fix it thow and if you duarantee is up. than take it to the apple store. they will fix it.|`|iiQcso9Vaa	If it's just dirty no, I believe warranties only cover hardware or software problems. You could always take it back and ask them.|`|EJbEYszlaa	if it is in guarantee then take to shop otherwise take it to aplle store|`|XPWDnL8paa	What does your guarantee say? Is it just a warranty?|`|aGAYQjb1aa	no u cant
QqtQUy4Daa	The void sticker you have to remove for the faceplate will only void the warrenty from sony NOT from compusa, bestbuy, or any other store you bought the psp at. As for the other question just go to the store from where you got  the warrenty and ask them if it will cover the dameges.
18252a75452eb432322070df26207fa2aa	you are in quite a pickle...i dont know what u could do...unless u could call apple...i dont know i hope u solve ur problemo|`|AsU2A4fTaa	You cannot.<br>  <br>  If it is no longer on your computer or iPod, there is absolutely no way to restore it. This is why iTunes asks you if you would like to "Back Up" your purchases after you download a song or video.|`|3f5afb4d943aaa111a3602858dad47b3aa	there isn't anything u can do, it probably says in the iTunes contract that they aren't responsible for lost music. besides it reminds you like a hundred times to back up your music. Sorry i've lost money that way too. Good luck.
AA11388730	you can forward e-mail messages, but you cannot forward a text message as of yet. there is a rumor that this feature will be added with the next software update from apple. if you meant to forward an e-mail, open the message, and click the icon that is an arrow pointing left, and choose "forward." if you were talking about a text message, then you may want to read about the new software update on www.iphonehacks.com. they have a detailed report on what features to expect from it.
AA11388730	if you buy it from itunes, it is saved in your music library. to apply it as your ringtone, you go to "settings," choose sounds, and it should be in the "Custom" section.
mFn6LNnDaa	I think you can get whatever area code you want.  Just when activating the phone in the store, ask to have a California area code. <br>  <br>   I know when I was signing up for my plan, I had the option to get a different area code and did.

Also there are some titles that won't work.|`|441203aaca9f7b8caa5f368adca42d9faa	In the uk only the original 60Gb version plays ps2 titles.|`|O5kiuWdkaa	There are some models of the PS3 that will play PS2 games. Look for PS2 backwards compatibility in the product description. The newest released PS3 with the 80gb hard drive will not play PS2 games, it will play PS1 games however. |`|HFrDqvIgaa	Yeah, But not the current 80 gb oor the 40 gb. Juts the old 80, 60, and 20. The 80 in mgs4 plays them though.
dGKNOzkxaa	Maybe try to do a System Update to update the firmware version of your PS3.|`|UTzERFbyaa	The same problem of the user "gavin"??<br>  take a look to my answer in his question two questions up from this..<br>  ;)|`|d32a55812667f47a538c396269df382aaa	You're screwed. Its a faulty Blu-ray drive. Sony had the same problem with PS2 and DVD if you remember. The only problem Sony has is they want to use the newest technology but its so new they hadn't perfected the reliability factor. The only thing you can do is to keep trying the lense cleaner or send it to Sony and pay $150 to get it fixed. Sorry about your luck man and I hope everything works out for you.
btICle0zaa	I was gonna get the Sennheiser 280 silver edition, but the sound is ****. lol. The Sony MDR V700's blow away sennheiser, and technics are really good too. go to Guitar center they have all different types of quality headphones. Try them out yourself compared to the sonys, the power rating for the Sennheisers is 500 Milliwatts max, sony is 3,000 max milliwatts. Sony has a better frequency range so you'll hear the super crystal clear highs, crisp mids, and really really really low bass that won't distort, no matter how hard you drive them. I use them in my mixer. Sony covers your whole ear, you only hear muffled sound(when no music is playing). if you play music in them, it feels like you are in the middle of the Concert with them on.  Sennheiser is harsh, and all vocals, very hard on the ear. Try em out for yourself if you don't believe me. oOnys have been good for a couple years now.
HXahRFKEaa	Save money, go into a store (Kmart, Best Buy, Circuit City, GameStop, Eb Games, etc.), & buy a 1 year card for $50.  It's really the easiest way, you only have to do it once a year, too.  Or say it's a good idea for Christmas or birthday to relatives & friends.  And as a tip, if you haven't done this yet, sign up for a silver Xbox LIVE account  (which needs no credit card or anything like that), & you get a free one month of Gold membership.<br>  Hope this helps!|`|jnXenqcMaa	just pay for it, simple as that|`|V1IfOP8Raa	Haven't you ever heard of REWARDS1??

qWicVoU9aa	No.  The SIM activation has to be done at the time of purchase and then you have to connect it to iTunes to wake it up after that.|`|z88IMXNFaa	Nope.  It has to be done in the store or the purchase will not be permitted.

J0Ie3XJmaa	It is not the same, it is absolutely different phone. It looks like iphone, but software is different. <br>  I have an i9, it is another chinese iphone clone, this is definitely not an iPhone, but it's worth its money. What is good about these chinese clones is that they are unlocked, you can use them with any sim card. Also they have two sim card slots, it means you can put in your phone two sim cards and use both of them at the same time.

I, like so many people online have been scammed by this same company.  it was only after i read the reviews, albeit too late, that i realized my error.  i suggest you do the same.  Read about the many people who have never received a phone, or never be given back their money..right now i am still awaiting my phone which was ordered in September or August last year. just Google cellular blowout reviews and sahre in the many disappointments and frustrations.  i guess some of us learn a little too late|`|lQ3uor3jaa	You should try to call and talk to them.

There is an outside chance that it might turn on, but that aint happening anytime soon.<br>  <br>  To check if the battery is damaged, remove the battery and wipe the area under the battery dry(thouroughly) and then try to get a friends battery(same makeand model as your phone). If the phone switches on, only the battery is damaged and you will have to only replace the battery which isnt too expensive.<br>  <br>  If it doesnt then the internal circuitry of the phone is damaged and you willhave to buy a new phone.|`|LntcUbNNaa	k i once had my phone in my pocket when i was swimming for a good 20minutes when i found out i freaked i tried turning it on and so what i did was go home blow dry it and then i just let it sit on my furniture and like 5 days it started to work again so try that unless its a really big deal i borrowed someones phone while i waited.|`|lNS13xoraa	Its simple, trust me!!

c7ee727afb26df28f827deb57db1035eaa	you have to register your iPod with iTunes before you can ever start using it. this means plugging it into a computer that has iTunes. the same thing happened to me. I don't think you can do anything at all until you plug it into iTunes. you don't have to put any music on it tho. you'll still be able to browse the internet and play games on it without downloading any music. <br>  <br>  The fees only pertain to an internet that you have to pay for. like if you stay at a hotel and use their wifi, they charge you like $10. iPod itself dosn't charge anything. its expensive enough already!<br>  hope that helps!<br>  O_o  cheEto

Untouchable!<br>  <br>  Roy Clark - Bluegrass, chicken picking, classical, and could crack a joke all in the same song.<br>  <br>  Jerry Reed - Made it cool to be from the Louisiana swamps!  Applied a banjo "claw" style to the guitar.<br>  <br>  Chet Atkins - Chords and melody at the same time...Mark Knofler would follow in his footsteps later.<br>  <br>  Les Paul - In addition to coming up with a great guitar, he developed a lot of studio tricks (such as overdubs) that are still in use today.<br>  <br>  Hendrix - Made the amp itself part of the sound and not just something to make the guitar loud.<br>  <br>  Robin Trower - People call him a Hendrix clone, but I think he put a blusier yet more effected sound out there.<br>  <br>  The Edge - Used the guitar as a curtain of sound.  With him, the effects are very much an integral part of the sound.<br>  <br>  Eddie Van Halen - brought tone and technique back into style in the late 70's.<br>  <br>  Tony Iommi - The Godfather of heavy.  Everything after him was from his blueprints.<br>  <br>  That's just the first few that came of the top of my head.  I'm sure lots of other people will have lots of other opinions.

Included features are nationwide long distance and roaming, visual voicemail, call forwarding, call waiting, 3-way calling, and caller ID.  The iPhone does not do picture messaging at all.

Text messaging is extra..the cheapest is 200 messages for $5.00. This was my exact plan until i started texting more and had to add the 1500 text message package for $15.00. My total monthly bill is around $95.00, which I'd have to say is quite ridiculous being this is just a phone used for leisure. Hope this helps!
pLCLtbtFaa	I think that since Alltel phones and other phone companies' phones are designed different, you can't use another carrier's phone with Alltel. Alltel and Verizon will have everything settled and official about around September this year (I talked to a representative). You can use the Blackberry if you really want it, but you would have to use another carrier, not Alltel.<br>  Hope I helped. :)

Take the sound file and put it into your music player. The program works on Mac and Windows and there are some video tutorials that you might want to look at to get more information about the program. The program can be found here: <a href="http://www.schoolfreeware.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.schoolfreeware.com</a><br>  I am hoping that is what you are looking for.

Ar27UBs3aa	While u r talking on phone press the top left botton (More) and then press 8 call recording will start :P|`|DxoodgOtaa	why exactly would you record their voice?|`|YBYnZlP8aa	I often record cell phone calls and conversations related to my business. These are typically witness interviews dealing with an insurance loss. Both parties are aware of the recording. I have found phone voice recordings to be much more useful than a written statement.<br>  <br>  You will need a device to record the phone calls. The Olympus TP7 Telephone Recording Device has been getting good reviews at various websites.<br>  <br>  The device works by inserting the earpiece into your ear prior to beginning the call. You then plug the male adapter into your tape recorder. Hit record. Then proceed to use your cell phone as you normally would. The microphone in the earpiece picks up the audio from the other parties voice as well as your own voice.<br>  <br>  You could also start the recording process in the middle of a cell phone call if needed.<br>  <br>  This is from an article on eHow - which I authored: How to Record Cell Phone Calls. Check it out if you like. I also included a link to state by state law on recording. Hope this helps.
N2p30Mo4aa	you can cancel it, but you'll be charged a penalty.<br>  <br>  if you know a friend that is interested in a phone, ask if they want to take over yours. there will be a transfer fee, but nowhere near what it'll cost you if you cancel|`|UGHVDspjaa	you will need to pay it off so if its 30 quid a month you will need to pay all the months up to your contract end so you may as well keep it till your contract ends. Ring and check|`|PUWoKAG1aa	no, it has to run for the full contract now, you only get a 14 day cooling off period in all contracts.|`|78a77e601eb622a41ad73849ef94ca5caa	No, funny that seeing as its called a 'contract'|`|uVX1CZwWaa	That's the thing about contracts. Once you sign and agree to it, there's no getting out unless you want to pay the ridiculously huge cancelation fee.<br>  <br>  It sucks, but that's the way contracts work :P|`|MvvKMAtmaa	Yea, but you have to pay a $ 150 cancellation fee. It really sucks. I would say sell it to a friend who wants it.|`|nhG4hUNAaa	Nope - not unless you pay the rest of the term!<br>  <br>  Unless its a monthly contract of course|`|z88IMXNFaa	Yes but there will be a contract termination fee.  The typical fee is $175.00.|`|9607f07a7fcd3e1d711c44cbed59369faa	If you cancel the contract before its up you have to pay a cancellation fee.....which can be high.

F75prVouaa	It's a bit like the action replay for DS. You just insert the disc and upload the cheats you want to cheat on. Then you stay where you are on the thing don't go any where else because the cheats won't work if you do. Then you can take out the Wii Homebrew disc, then you insert the game disc. And Then You Can Enjoy.|`|ipZeqi3xaa	The Homebrew channel is a third-party (not authorized) channel. It is used for hacking Wii games like Mario Kart Wii (eg, infinite items, etc). Only people who suck at games use it because they want to be good. It may wreck your Wii, so I suggest that you don't try it. You can download it from the computer on a SD card and download it into your Wii from the same SD card. If your good at Wii, then you don't need it =D|`|g8jS4x53aa	homebrew is a channel by team twiizers that lets you mod your wii and add codes to your games to get things like new items.|`|S8AXB3JRaa	It is a wii channel used for hacking the wii
ipZeqi3xaa	Practice no scoping by playing against a friend. This will be helpful. People say that you should snipe from a tall area. This is true, but you can also snipe from a bushy area in closed area, as this works good too. You can ry this in Upheaval and especially Makin. For sniping in tall places, Dome, Hangar, and Cliffside are good. PTRS is the best sniper in the game as it is very powerful and accurate. You can tell if you are in a good sniping spot if you are surrounded by things like bushes, tall grass, large containers, etc. If you are in a tall sniping position, make sure that there is no open entrance behind you;only in the front.|`|ca1o8Ylsaa	Try sniping on tall places so you can see them more enemy's and also try to have overkill perk so when someone try's to comes in you can easily change and shoot them fast.Chose some where  there only one way to get in don't chose out in the open or where enemies can get in two sides. Use bouncing Bettye's so when it goes off you can tell when someone try  or is trying to come in|`|yJWwNoO8aa	When sniping online, never try to snipe someone that is moving because you will NEVER hit them unless they are walking toward or away from you. You can also snipe non-scope if you wish with a rifle like the Grewer just make sure you have the camoflauge perk and make sure that they can't see the flash of your gun when you kill them. Personally I would ALWAYS have camoflage perk on if your sniping unless your playing hardcore  because if you shoot and miss they'll find you. Also if they see you and you kill them move to a different spot immediately because they'll come behind you and shank you when they respawn.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps :D
g8jS4x53aa	yes, it is. the only way its not is when you use codes or channels that are flagged as dangerous. and nintendo wont send updates that will brick your wii if you have an illegal channel.|`|C7rV71Cjaa	Modding anything is never 100% safe. The best way to make sure your Wii is 100% safe is to not mod it at all.
Cnfngqf3aa	I use this program I found online, in fact I don't even have cable on my tv anymore because I can get all the same channels on my computer.|`|nQ7G1nBVaa	You need a tuner card.<br>  <br>  There are no "Channels" as such online, but some broadcasters and cable channels offer their programs for online streaming after they air.|`|sq8rycY0aa	well i recomend youtube
WdzACevnaa	The Zen V or Zen V plus are wonderful MP3 players they are simple and very good for their price|`|LJMGbzrxaa	Some phones work with itunes, like a blackberry. But why not just upgrade to another ipod? they go for like, $150 now for the new nano.
