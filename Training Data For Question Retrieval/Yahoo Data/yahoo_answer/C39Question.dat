Esa pregunta que al parecer fué interpretada como una alianza entre "nosotros dos" y supuestos enemigos del grupo, no tenia nada que ver con eso.   Intentabamos expresar que nosotros muchas veces defendimos a quienes considerabamos nuestros amigos sin pedir nada a cambio claro está, cada vez que alguno de nosotros dos sacabamos la cara por ellos siempre nos llegaban mails de..ya sabemos quien insultandonos y en algunas ocaciones diciendo que nos fijemos bien que clase de amigos teniamos, puesto que con fraces como "te pegarian un tiro en la nuca" y "para que defendes xenófobos" nos intenta decir que nuestros amigos no eran lo que parecian.   Aesto apuntaba la pregunta que ayer eliminaron , el punto era mostrar que quizá ciertos "enemigos" no estaban tan equivocados, quizá podes esperar cualquier cosa de un enemigo

An active duty Army Maj. (non-pilot), An Air Force full Col. (Ret. pilot), and a non-pilot Air Force Chief Master Sergeant (Ret.). These three guys know me very well. Will they be strong letters of recommendation or do I need to find an Army Warrant Officer pilot to write me a letter?      Also I haven't spoke to a recruiter yet, but I have completed everything thats in the packet that I can do on my own. What is with the recommendation letters only being good for 90 days? Does the Army send out a questionaire or can I just hold on to my letters until its time for me to turn them in? Any help is greatly appreciated.

NO person i know that has smoked weed has ever died! i know countless people who have died from tobacco. Do you ever see a doctor prescribe tobacco? no. have you ever seen them prescribe weed? Yes. so you see the only thing keeping it illegal is the fighting and selling and what not! Hence. if u legalize it maybe the fighting will stop. Also  instead of wasting gas to transport the DEA to houses if we legalize it that saves a ton of gas! Also we don't need all the workers breaking down doors for nothing. with us making weed legal we can help the environment which points back to the DEA issue. so as you see we should open out eyes. Anythings you feel against me about? (ps im not over 18 so watch what you say please and i am not a smoker)

20090203133510AAgO5Hf	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	What should I do? Please help! Speeding/Eluding an officer ticket?	So I was having one of those days that was just going terribly. My club meeting after school ran late and I had to hurry home so that I would have time to do my projects and homework.   And lo and behold, on a long stretch of road, out of nowhere, a police officer steps onto the road waving at me and like the absent-minded person that I am, I figure he's waving to slow me down because there is construction or something. So I slow down and go on my way.   Five minutes later, I glance in the rear view mirror to see the guy on a motorcycle with his lights flashing. So I pull over.   The police officer charges me with speeding (going 44 in a 30 mile zone) and for "attempting to elude a police officer".      So now, I'm wondering if anyone can help me out. I admit that I was going too fast, but that was for good reason. And I did not in any way try to elude the police officer. He claims that he told me to stop and then when I didn't, to come back. However, I took his waving as a slow down sign. It didn't occur to me that I had to stop. And after slowing down, I didn't think I did anything wrong, so I never looked in my rear view mirror, which means I never saw him waving at me to come back.   Had I seen him, I definitely would have stopped or gone back or something.      Does anyone think I should fight this? The citation says that I have to appear in court. Any advice? Is there a service or something out there that is experienced in dealing with these things and has a good track record?      I recently turned 18, and I have always been one of the best students in my school. Will that help at all? Will I even get my say? I'm really worried about these tickets. Please help!

We got a "new" dryer in the laundry room in our apartment building, and seeing as how they almost  never fix anything in this building, I was the first person to use it and went over after about 20 minutes to check to see if the clothes were drying.

When I opened the dryer, I was blasted in the face by steam, and ended up going to the ER with a burn on my lips, inside my nose cornealal injuries from steam, and a slight burn on my face. It was so hot, it actually burned off some of the hair on my arms!    Now the manager of the building says that he won't pay my medical bills, he also told me that "There isn't steam in the dryer, it's a gas dryer" Well, there was, and I got burned, now what?

No soy panista ni nada, pero no sé, no hace falta ser afiliado para darse cuenta que eso no fue un accidente.

A mí lo que me llama la atención es que se trataba de un avión de gobernación. Es decir, ?estará algún lobo vestido de cordero metido en el gabinete de Calderón?

They screw things up so badly, that their own comrades have to distance themselves from them. Then when election time comes around they become more democratic than the Democrats because it is the only way that they can seem reasonable. If McCain won, the minute he took office, he would do as W did, and go into an Orgy of putting Republican Nonsense into action.

I have a dilemma, now I know nothing about what happens when it comes to the procedures behind theft at work and what goes on from there, a good mate of mine has been suspended from work on the suspicion of theft, there are transactions indicating money has been spent with the said amount stolen, also there is CCTV footage showing my friend at the point of stealing too, they have been suspended with full pay and will be due for a hearing, my friend still lives with their parents and is adamant once they find out, they wont hear the end of this, to make the situation worse my friend has the same employee as their parent, so far the management investigating have informed my friend it wont be disclosed, so parents are unaware of the situation.   What goes on from here? will there be an arrest? how serious could this get? any advice would be appreciated, friend was in tears this evening and realises their mistakes, what would be the best way forward? would this result in a criminal record? bearing in mind my friend has had no history of theft or criminal activity in and outside of their working life, ever! all answers much appreciated thanks!

20090208033552AAPJIDh	Politics & Government;Politics	?Acabará Obama con la política de mentiras, manipulación y espionaje de EEUU en las naciones latino-americanas?	La política intervencionista de los EEUU en los países latino-americanos, va desde lo menos a lo más; desde la des-estabilización política de un gobierno o candidato presidencial, hasta el apoyo incondicional de un golpe de estado contra gobiernos elegidos constitucionalmente. Se estiman en más de 400 golpes de estado auspiciados por EEUU en tierras latino-americanas.       La barbarie y el terrorismo de estado que ejecutan a través de sus agencias de inteligencia, entienda-se CIA, DEA y FBI, han dejado mucho sufrimiento y muerte; grandes injusticias en contra de la disidencia política. Además promueven instituciones económicas, como el BMC y el FMI, que en vez de ayudar a levantar cabeza a las economías locales, les otorgan préstamos a interés de tal manera que les resultan casi imposible cumplir tan siquiera con el pago minino de los intereses. Así, cuando más les convengan de acuerdo a sus intenciones políticas en la región, les exigen el saldo de la deuda que llevará a la des-estabilización económica, la miseria y la hambruna a una nación en específico. El ejemplo más dramático lo es Argentina.

Fui caminando pensando en mis cosas y gritándole a mi Vladimir (mi perro, comunista, sí) cada vez que me traía un gato mordisqueado y semi muerto. Bueno llegué al video, entré, y me vi abrumada y atormentada por películas todas iguales. Veía en las cajitas nombres diferentes pero eran como espejitos, todas del mismo tema: terrorismo. Así q, abstraída, le dije al se?or due?o del video: "che, loco, el terrorista perfecto para los ianquis sería un hijo de un árabe padre y madre latina, tanto miedo a todos le tienen?" Bueno la cosa es q este se?orito, empezó a los gritos atrevidos adentro del video, diciendo que él era un se?or penitenciario (me acababa de enterar de su trabajo de pordiosero, q espanto) muy respetable, y q todas esas películas estaban en la razón, y bla bla bla. Pude rescatar de él que es una persona q apoya pegarle una patadota con su punta de acero a un menor q afana un estéreo y no a un milico q vende drogas a ese menor; q está a favor de los abusos a los derechos de la dignidad humana, a favor de la tortura, de la delincuencia de la policía, a favor de abusar y golpear a una prostituta, q poco la diferencia de su mujer también golpeada; a favor de una estado juez y gendarme, terrorista y pacífico a los abusos de la élite gobernante. Todo esto él me lo contaba con mucho orgullo a pesar de mi boca abierta, incrédula yo, pobrecita de mi. Salí espantada, casi vomitando, descompuesta, y pensando que si no es mejor cambiar mi idea: en vez de querer incendiar un establecimiento de adoctrinamiento religioso, es mejor quemar un video club, con su due?o adentro. Y me pregunté, también, la DUDA QUE YAHOO NO ME DEJARíA PUBLICAR: ?En qué benefician a la sociedad todos esos miliquines divididos en penitenciarios, caballería, en moto, monopatín, en pantalón o falda, en auto o helicóptero, si en realidad con todos ellos podríamos hacer una bolsa de la misma mier.da y prenderla fuego? ?No sería ESTO mas beneficioso para la sociedad?

20090222164804AAiurVy	Politics & Government;Politics	Why do conservatives want to pay more for health care just to spite the poor and uninsured?	When an uninsured individual gets sick and doesn't go to a GP on account of being unable to afford it, their condition can deteriorate. They usually end up in an ER - which alone is very expensive - for extremely expensive treatments, which could have easily been avoided.      Long story short, this drives up health care costs for everyone through increased demand, numerous billing charge-offs, and inflated insurance premiums. In other words, you're already paying for the uninsured as if we had UHC - you're just paying more.      Now, since it's in their OWN INTEREST to cover the uninsured, isn't it about time that conservatives and libertarians stop whining and SAVE THEMSELVES SOME CASH? Sheesh...      *By the way, to preemptively debunk some frequent objections:      - Universal Health Care means just that, and only that - everyone is covered, period. It does not necessarily mean a state-owned medical industry.      - All of the supposedly awful UHC programs of our friends and allies actually outperform the American system. Additionally, public polling in those countries indicates overwhelming support for their respective systems - in contrast to the US.      - If you're going to post something discussing the awful state of the British NHS or Canadian Medicare, I ask that you justify it with OBJECTIVE FACTS. Anecdotes about your Canadian aunt who had to wait for a hip replacement don't count.      - If you're going to comment on the cost of UHC, you must compare the cost of that to the cost of alternatives. Every study I've ever seen indicates that the cost of leaving so many uninsured dwarfs the cost of coverage. The experience of countries like France, Germany, and the UK further bears this out.
20090222174418AAJmvNW	Politics & Government;Military	SAS - British Pride Question Reincarnation?	So you know all those really stupid questions you'll see asking "who would win, seals, delta force, SAS?"? Well, I personally believe that they are all pretty much the same(ability, not mission-specific capability). I'm just curious about what makes so many Brits so sure that their SAS is the best. You'd think that the nation with the highest spending capabilities, largest recruiting pool, and the most extensive experience in recent military history(US), would be the most likely candidate to have the greatest special operations group. Once again, this is not an argument, I'm just curious. Please avoid saying the training is more intense, because if the US wanted to make our Spec Ops guys better, they'd just make the training tougher, which they haven't, so...(circular argument). Above all else, DO NOT say that the SAS are the best because of the caliber of their men; assuming that the US doesn't have men of equal capability would insult both Americans and non-Americans.   - Once again, please just answer the questions. Don't argue, because logic would prove that the US has better potential to have the greatest spec-op unit.

20090222183732AATV5aH	Politics & Government;Other - Politics & Government	In lieu of recent headlines, should there be an animal "Bill of Rights"?	Would u support an animal Bill of Rights?      For those of you who didn’t know, today kicks off National Justice for Animals Week!      Started by the Animal Legal Defense Fund (ALDF), February 22-28 is a week dedicated to raising awareness of animal abuse and to share information on how communities can come together to create and enforce tougher laws to protect animals.      As part of this week, the ALDF would like to send a message to Congress that we, the people, support legislation that protects animals and provides them with basic legal rights.      Enter the Bill of Rights for Animals, which would entitle animals to the following:      The Right of animals to be free from exploitation, cruelty, neglect, and abuse.      The Right of laboratory animals not to be used in cruel or unnecessary experiments.      The Right of farm animals to an environment that satisfies their basic physical and psychological needs.      The Right of companion animals to a healthy diet, protective shelter, and adequate medical care.      The Right of wildlife to a natural habitat, ecologically sufficient to a normal existence and self-sustaining species population.      The Right of animals to have their interests represented in court and safeguarded by the law of the land.    These all seem to be fairly straightforward ideas. Unfortunately, from backyards to factory farming and labs, animals are still suffering and cases of abuse and neglect aren’t a scar

20090222191005AAyxBr1	Politics & Government;Military	Why do ex-Military lie so much about what happened during their Service?	Now I am all for celebrating our Men and Women in service and our solders. My family has served since the American Revolution I have as well.      Service meaning support mission and Soldiers meaning those that have missions to kill our enemies.      Why do so many people who performed support missions in the Military come home and announce they were battle heroes, when they were not?      Should they be ashamed to be a fork lift operator in a supply warehouse for 4 years?       How many service men or women do you know who would admit to you: I just pushed paper for 4 years, or drove a forklift, or drove a supply truck? I have heard few military people mention their careers like this.      Yet with only a tiny number of real Solders in the Armed forces, How can they be telling the truth? After all aren't their Military orders sealed, so who can know if they are telling the truth?

20090222193848AA8qYEk	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	A subpoena was mailed to me as a witness to a simple battery. My husband is the defendent. Do I have to go?	My husband and brother got into an argument about politics. My husband started a physical altercation by shoving my brother. My brother called the police and they arrested my husband for simple battery. My brother was not injured at all.      As things have calmed down over 4 months, there is no interest in our family to have this go to court. My husband has sought out anger management and alcohol treatment voluntarily.       I was mailed, not personally served with a subpoena as a witness.      The public defender gave my husband an affidavit to give to me. It basically says, I am his spouse and do not wish to testify. My brother lives out of state and does not plan to come to the trial.       The public defender also told my husband that since it was a mailed subpoena vs. a physically delivered one, there was little chance the court would do anything if I did not show up even without the affidavit. But, I wanted to make sure I did this properly.      We were told to sign, notarize the affidavit, then file it with the court before the trial.      If I do this and not show up, will it jeopardize me?       And, will my brother encounter any problems if he does not show up as the victim?

A truly free country that sets an example, not one of greed and consumption, but a better way of life.

What are the fundamental objections to the Obama-Pelosi plan?      It is three parts social spending to one part stimulus. It takes too long to work. It represents a permanent not temporary expansion of government.      It is too much LBJ, who bet the ranch on spending and failed, and not enough JFK, who bet on tax reductions that succeeded.      Even Bill Clinton would not have ceded so much to the tax-and-spend wing of his party, which he relied on for votes, not advice.      Has Obama no more imaginative ideas for government's role in reshaping the economy for the 21st century than this? Was it all talk all along, to prepare the way for a return to the days of spend and spend?      Sad, because this is likely to be Obama's last shot at getting this economy on its feet and running by 2010.

20090222194806AA2Ba2y	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	Could this be a possible mistrial?  If not what are the chances of probation?	I was found guilty of Felonious Assault and sentencing is set for March.  It was a surprise to be found guilty I thought for sure the judge saw through all the lies.  The guy I was in an altercation with recieved a slightly fractured nasal bone (undisplaced) and 3 sutures to close a .5mm cut he recieved from the ground.  No weapon was used at all however, there was another guy involved that hit and kicked the guy after the fight was over.  The other defendants mother works for the city courts and his charges were dropped down to a misdemeanor during grand jury indictments.  My question is, is this grounds for an appeal seeing as how his charges were not bound over even though the two guys that testified against me also stated he was involved and the "victim" stated the guy hit him from behind first?  My other question is would this be considered a mistrial.... After both sides rested their case the judge had the prosecutor take the victim back to her so she could see his face?  I am definitely appealing this case and looking for a lawyer!  With this information do you think it would be worth it?  I also have a very limited history.... 1 M4 and 2 MM's.   What are the chances of probation?      I also have a great job, I am married, 27 years old, I have a daughter and another on the way.  This was my first time out since my daughter was born.  It happened at a bar on the night of July 4th.  I no longer drink and haven't drank since September!  I have no desire to anymore.  I have been out on pretrial release and done great.  They also just put a SCRAM bracelet on me to monitor alcohol.  Are my chances for probation pretty good?

20090222195129AArVWtM	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Can I file a lawsuit against Wal-Mart for wrongfully accusing me of shoplifting.?	I bought my girlfriend a bottle of perfume for her birthday and as I walked to the register to purchase it, I put a DVD that I had in my hand (not in, my coat pocket, or in anyway concealing it or removing it from the package) on a shelf cause I didn't have enough cash to buy both the perfume and DVD.  After I purchased the perfume, I walked to the exit and as I neared the first set of doors the security guard or loss prevention ran up to me flashed his little ID card and demanded that I "Give him the game I had in my pants befor be called the cops."      He didn't ask me to step into a private location, instead he chose to keep me in front of the doors as other customers walked by staring,  I said I didnt have anything and would gladly take my pants off to prove I didnt have any stolen items.        After about 4 minutes of embarrassment he told me to show him where it was, I replied its "Back on a shelf next to some pots and pans."  He told me to take him to it.  I did, showed him the DVD on the shelf then left.      My step mom is a loss prevention worker at TJ Maxx and she said that nearly everything he did was wrong.  Thanks for any help.

20090222195349AAwwP7n	Politics & Government;Other - Politics & Government	Why haven't I seen this on the news?	I heard that a muslim cut his wife's head off because he got mad at her. Why hasn't this been shown on CNN or MSNBC? I heard that Bill O'Reilly showed it. But why arent the other stations showing it? Because they don't want to show the cold hard facts that muslims aren't about peace? Ive also heard numerous stories about men killing their wives and daughters because they weren't following the "rules" of islam or whatever you want to call it.      if they claim they're all about peace, why are they killing their own family?   Again, why haven't I seen this on CNN or MSNBC? Why don't they want people to see this kind of mess?

I am considering joining the Army National Guard and I'm trying to get a genuine sense of the different MOS they offer. I am leaning toward 31B-M.P. but am open to other jobs. What I really want is to fly helicopters; however, I am apparently too old.

Since I can remember, I have always been a muscular person (although I recently had a child). My body fat is regularly monitored and is now at approx 26.3% (under the AF required 28%).      HOWEVER, according to the "calculator" that my recruiter has, my measurements show that not only is my body fat at 40%, but that I am OBESE!!!!! WTF???      I have no clue what to do! Anyone know any tricks? I can't fail this...       BTW, if u don't believe me, please feel free to check out how "obese" I am at www.myspace.com/kaoskitty79

20090203101033AAaIvuq	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	What do you think you should do if a police officer puts force on you for no reason ?	im doing an essay on police brutality like the case on oscar grant      New Year's Day 2009, Oscar Grant an African American father of a 4-year-old daughter and lived in Hayward, at approximately 2:00 AM PST, BART Police officers responded to reports of an altercation between two groups of passengers on an incoming train from the West Oakland BART Station. Five BART Police officers found a chaotic situation when they arrived at the Fruitvale station, with a brawl continuing on the platform even after they arrived. BART Police officers removed Oscar Grant and several other men suspected of fighting from the train and detained them on the train platform. Police have not said whether Grant had been involved in the fight. While dozens of people are shouting and cursing at officers from the stopped train, Mehserle and another BART Police officer positioned Grant face-down onto the concrete platform. The officer who punched Grant kneels on Grant's neck. A struggle ensued, and seconds later Mehserle began tugging at his service handgun on his right hip. Mehserle then stood up unholstered his gun and fired a shot into Grant's back. Immediately after the shooting, Mehserle appeared surprised and raised his hands to his face.    The .40 caliber bullet from Mehserle's semi-automatic handgun entered Grant's back, exited through his front side and ricocheted off the concrete floor of the platform, finally puncturing Grant's lung. Immediately after the shooting, according to one witness, Grant yelled, "You shot me! I got a four-year-old daughter!" Grant died seven hours later at Highland Hospital from his bullet wounds.
