Zg2bprz0aa	Actually, I haven't. (:|`|0fdea5c7c4c63ee0b9a5aff838c155c7aa	nope|`|ZEi8bvP9aa	They are really nice, but usually it kind of depends on the weather on how nice the moonlit Bar-B-Que is.|`|oXuLtEHyaa	My relatives all live in Owensboro, Kentucky. I have been eating at Moolite since I can remember. They have a huge buffet and a menu. Once a week they have a catfish fry and a steak night on the buffet. It is pretty expensive though. Moonlite is world famous, but it is not like it used to be.
bQraDPLUaa	While not a dress up place, Panna 2 is tons of fun. Its a Christmas tree lights devoured closet of a restaurant with extremely affordable Indian food- and when its someones birthday (and its usually "someones" birthday) they play a crazy techno birthday song and flash the lights on and off.<br>  <a href="http://www.panna2.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.panna2.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/panna-ii-garden-indian-restaurant-new-york" rel="nofollow">http://www.yelp.com/biz/panna-ii-garden-...</a><br>  <br>  But if you want to class it up what about these:<br>  <br>  Buddakan <br>  <a href="http://www.buddakannyc.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.buddakannyc.com</a><br>  <br>  Highline<br>  <a href="http://www.nychighline.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.nychighline.com</a>|`|AA12017987	I've been to Dave & Busters in Upstate NY and it was fun. They have one on 42nd street between 8th and Broadway. Across the street from there is BBQs it's not "fun" but they give you lots of food and it's not expensive. Mars 2111 is over on 50th street and Broadway. I went there it's cool the way you walk in and they have simulated spaceship ride taking you to mars to eat. I didn't eat there though cuz it's soooo expensive. I can't think of anywhere else right now. I just know those places cuz I go to church in Times Square so those are the places I pass by or eat at on my way there.<br>  <br>  <br>  PS. I just realized you were asking about somewhere you can dress up...not sure. Although maybe you can try BB Kings right next to BBQ's. They have different things and shows going on there so maybe you should check and see what's going on thre before going. I think you then can select something that is nice and requires you to dress up....|`|uh5DlJzqaa	A place that you don't really have to dress up for but you can cause its a casual place.I'm in tenth grade and these are places i like to go cause i live in manhattan. There not like a burger joint or something. <br>  <br>  On the lower east side there are  great restaurants called " 7A"[italian] and Yuca Bar "[all types of Spanish food cuban,puerto rican etc]<br>  <br>  Another is a cuban place called "Cafecito" and there is a good japenese food place called "Momofuku" though its a little pricey<br>  <br>  i dont know the exact addresses of these places but there all on google maps if you need the address|`|h3gTSTsXaa	oh i love mars 2112...you do not really have to dress up but it is a fun place to go|`|fPZPsGv1aa	i like pop burger.
YRd5AM5uaa	Is this really what you are looking forward to???<br>  Anyways taco bell is the best so do that first if thats your life goal|`|GHd84xipaa	there was a place called Burger Chef back in the 60's,but no longer in business.back then they had .15 cent burgers.so did McDonald's|`|uIahELWKaa	cant wait til i can drive<333

Overall though, probably Chick-Fil-A.|`|wLgGD63raa	Sonic. Too bad there aren't any in Michigan..<br>  <br>  But.. since there also aren't any In N Out's here either..

DbQKHNYsaa	Yeah I don't think Starbucks will have a value menu anytime soon. They should though.
pueeMH6gaa	Don't worry about it.  Most of the people they hire aren't that bright so they don't expect people to learn it right away.  Let's face it, there aren't a lot of nobel prize winners working the cash register at McDonalds.  Try not to stay there very long you seem to smart for this job.|`|pBu4ZGyTaa	Dunno...but yeah I agree with the guy who said you're too smart for it|`|xo73KV6zaa	lmfao i dont think so but you can look on google nd see if there is.!?|`|Q5DBN66zaa	No, but they have one in Toys R Us. :)
HBFHZXybaa	Cleaning, yes. Maybe the cash register and probably get the donuts/muffins, etc. That's it.|`|kKOIuslzaa	You got the cleaning part right... But possibly making coffee, cash register, and being an attentive clerk.|`|pueeMH6gaa	Usually the new guy goes on toilet detail.  Take some rubber gloves because they don't provide any.|`|FyIcIzIoaa	cleaning,and making coffee|`|UbR8EfMxaa	you will be doing all the grunt work.|`|VvbOSbRnaa	Could be just cleaning. Possibly also filling the donuts. I'm not sure what state you work in, but I know in some states you need to be 16 to operate a cash register.
Mnmw1tzAaa	It freaks be out o___O;;;<br>  <br>  They sound like they're having orgasms or something. Makes me not want to eat them (not that I eat there to begin with).<br>  <br>  Naw, my impression of it was that they're acting like they would around a newborn or infant. Kinda stereotyping women but, hey, if it gets your attention...|`|9M6a9QoCaa	I HATE BURGER KING!!!!! They food poisoned me with the wrong oder!

9e11df00019ad57ae83fd8ebfdfbc709aa	Whole Food's is known for being an upscale grocery store with lots of convenience food options (thus the hefty price tags).<br>  <br>   While you can't get coupons for Whole Foods you can try buying the essentials, like milk, butter, and cereal at Target where it's rock bottom prices, or at Safeway with your club card.  <br>  <br>  For the salad bar specifically, try avoiding heavy items (like potato salad which is full of inexpensive potatoes) or get stuff like shrimp (which is an expensive item and worth the weight). Put your croutons, cheese, and salad dressing in the to-go ramekin's which won't add to the weight of the salad.|`|SdDvbPf0aa	yeah well, whole foods is expensive! <br>  <br>  <a href="http://consumerincentivepromotions.com/rd_p?p=95680&c=7259-grocery250gc_emc_d4f1&a=22125" rel="nofollow">http://consumerincentivepromotions.com/r...</a><br>  <br>  yeah i just looked that up really quick, im not sure if it works...|`|IIt2e7pJaa	Go to the big whole foods in Austin with a skating rink and everything and forget the coupons|`|rnyEkPHeaa	sure look it up ur dam self
up4CNbs9aa	I am actually working on that myself right now. Now are you talking being a straight up manager like the GM/kitchen/server/hospitality manager? Or are you talking being a service professional, where you'll be scheduled a few shifts as a "manager" and other shifts you'll serve/bartend/host?<br>  <br>  I'm working on becoming a service professional and you pretty much have to bust your *** day in and day out. Red Lobster lives and breaths for it's customers, and they want NOBODY to be dissatisfied in the least. Keep a smile on your face, be confident, have fun, be perky, KNOW YOUR STUFF, don't be afraid to speak out if you have an idea or have noticed an issue. If you want a chance at manager you have to be on top of your game at all times. There is a class you'll have to take, they run them every so often but you'll have to talk to the manager of your actual location to find out when they are.<br>  <br>  As for compensation I'm not too sure yet, but I'm sure if you're seriously interested in managing you could speak to your current boss and get a ton of details.|`|g6ocdYrvaa	not me

KYPhnVe8aa	Hydrogenation of vegetable oil chemically changes the oil to give the fried foods a nice crunchy texture that lasts longer- even after the fries or onion rings sit for several minutes.  Unfortunately this process creates trans fats that clog our arteries.  A lot of places just use regular vegetable oil which has not been hydrogenated - kind of like the vegetable oil (salad oil, canola, corn oil) you would buy at the grocery store.  This usually gives you fries and other fried foods that go soggy easier but they still taste pretty good if you eat fast.  They both make you fat but the trans fat will make you fat AND could give you a heart attack, too (stay away from it!)|`|MEOjwPCNaa	Personally, I wouldn't eat any of it. If your great-grandmother wouldn't recognize it as food, it isn't. The trans-fat debacle shows what happens when we create novel foods which aren't found in nature. The fact that "nutrition science" advocated it for thirty years is proof that you probably shouldn't listen to food industry...errr, nutrition, science.
4604flr2aa	Yes, I went.  :)  I originally wanted to go with my husband first thing at 6am but when our alarm went off at 4:45 for me to take my shower I decided that wasn't worth free pancakes so I went back to sleep.  My husband got up and went without me!  LoL  He said it was packed but the wait wasn't too long and the service was good.    So I decided to get up around 7:15 and I went with my kids and we brought grandma too!  We got there and there was a lot of cars in the lot but we walked right in, no line out the door... there were like 2 or 3 parties ahead of us.  We put in our name but we were called in less than 5 minutes for a table.  Our food arrived fast too, it was great!  We also remembered to leave a TIP on the full amount the bill would have been if the meals weren't free.  ;-)    Later in the day we were out driving around and we saw 2 different Dennys that had the lines out the door and wrapped around the building!  OMG, crazy!!!|`|VvbOSbRnaa	I wanted to, but I didn't get up early enough in time to make it to go!|`|lfNk8MaFaa	I wanted to, but I forgot before school... and I don't get out until 3:30.

When I saw it on the Superbowl ad I was like, hmmm, I have to wake up for an appointment today anyway, so why not?  I figured we'd walk in, might be a little busy, but pretty much thought we would walk in and get seated.  Boy, was I wrong.      Took awhile just to get a parking spot.  We probably would have left, but were in bumper to bumper traffic in the parking lot, so we had no choice.  When we saw someone leaving we figured we could park, so lets try it.  It was a madhouse.  They told us between an hour and an hour and a half wait.  The good thing...... They were giving out rainchecks.  So we left and went to IHOP and we'll go back for our free grand slam within 10 days.  Still not a bad deal.|`|iou7nV3Kaa	I did, and they were sooo good!!!yummy!!!!!|`|AA10868740	Oh no I forgot
