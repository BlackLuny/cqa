20090304075820AA1WaLX	Local Businesses;United States;San Antonio	Is San Antonio simply going to sweep DA Susan Reed's crime involving stolen SW Airline tickets "under the rug"?	Is San Antonio simply going to sweep DA Susan Reed's crime involving stolen SW Airline tickets "under the rug"?      A Short Editorial Per The District Attorney Susan Reed's Involvement With Stolen Airline Tickets      We are told by the Media that Head Bexar County District Attorney Susan Reed claims total   innocence and ignorance of being a party to the scheme to use a portion of the 5600 stolen   Southwest Airline tickets for her own personal use, and has instead implicated her trusted   Chauffeur/Bodyguard/Investigator, Mark Gudanowski, as her unwitting Scapegoat in this crime.   As an experienced "Investigator", one would readily believe that Mr. Gudanowski would have   quickly become aware of the significance of this multitude of "Free" airline tickets,   as would have an experienced prosecutor such as Susan Reed. I ask you this question, people:   Do you honestly believe that such an excuse or defense would work for YOU in Her Court???   Does a true proponent of Justice (NOT Reed's brand of "Just-us" for San Antonio's financially-   priviledged and powerful!) actually need a Chauffeur/Bodyguard in our fair city?   Is Reed a part of the Judicial System, or the Mob? Corruption has long run rampant among   various members of San Antonio's Law Enforcement and Judicial System, following the trends   set long ago in its mother country of Mexico, and Reed has stoically and steadily climbed   the rungs of San Antonio's political ladder, furthering her political career at the expense   of many of us, her helpless and hapless Pawns, the common everyday people, who simply cannot   afford the high-priced attorneys and/or discreet "Pay-Offs" that are necessary to "win" in   her Courts. Countless San Antonians have suffered having their families ripped apart and more   often than not destroyed due to Reed's personal brand of "Just-Us". I should know; my beloved   wife was one of her innocent victims, a decade ago. She will rest in peace when Reed rests   in prison. It is only fair, is it not? A crime is a crime, no matter who you are.   The greatest crime of all, however, would be to NOT seek a Grand Jury indictment against   Susan Reed for HER crime, exactly as would be done should you or I be the guilty culprit.   I leave that decision to you, the people of San Antonio.         Know your enemy, Susan Reed:      Gerald "Wolf" Faris   aka   Lord Sesshomaru   801 River Road, #511   Boerne, TX - 78006   (830) 428-8901
