ECe1rgsdaa	Just do some inexpensive candy wrapped in tulle for favors. Not many people use matches anymore, and it will prob. get tossed anyway.<br>  <br>  Here is a tent rental place for you! <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.albertatentrentals.com/tents.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.albertatentrentals.com/tents....</a>|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	Yeh it is, its also very tacky so why not reduce the number of people and have a decent celebration or save until you can do it properly on the scale you want.|`|AA11312653	Better yet, skip favors entirely! All these fripperies like favors, guest books, programs, save the dates, response cards. and the endless rounds of gift giving are purely inventions of The Wedding Industry and not traditional at all. I suggest you start reading Miss Manners on weddings. She isn't trying to sell you anything (except her books of course!) and will give you real facts about what is necessary and what is optional. Wedding Industry related entities aren't going to tell you that something is optional, because you then you might not buy it. Miss Manners can save you scads of money.<br>  <br>  For instance, did you know that handwritten invitations are considered more formal and more correct than invitations created by a hired calligrapher or those produced by printing or engraving? The idea is that it is most gracious to sit down and personally create the invitation with your own hands, and paying someone to do it for you is a shoddy substitute. Your handwriting need not be excellent; mere legibility is perfectly adequate. <br>  <br>  Read Miss Manners for many more money saving and oh so excruciatingly correct ideas how to have a splendidly elegant wedding without going into debt.|`|AA11603468	There is a big difference between trying to be cheap and sticking to a modest budget. You actually don't need favors at all, and that's not cheap, it's realistic. Who actually wants matches anyway?|`|mc6YtaRbaa	Lot's of people just don't do favors at all. No one really wants something with your name and wedding date on it anyway so I would do nothing instead of doing something tacky like matches.|`|IWWZdZRpaa	Favors are a waste of money anyway.  Just skip them all together.|`|UAF8Zxzaaa	I did favors just because I wanted to give people some sort of thank you for paying to travel to be with us on our wedding! A lot of people live in all different places. It would be nice to do for people if you could. It's not too expensive depending on what you do. What I did was I bought little bottles and put little thank you messages in each one for each guest or each pair of guests. You could always just buy a large bag of candy (are very cheap) and put some in colored tissue paper for each person. Of course you don't have to but it's always nice.|`|237f7b8deabaa8cf367ed76288106f19aa	I would skip the favors if your on a tight budget. I have thrown away countless matchbooks and other useless items with the couples names stamped all over them. People usually only take them b/c they feel obligated knowing the couple spent so much money on them. If you are wanting to cheap out for your wedding then I would recommend skipping the tent. A large tent is going to cost you up to $10,000! So you need to figure your budget out and then see where to "cheap out."|`|I4d5PCKQaa	Believe it or not, a few minutes of browsing on Google for cheap favors and whatever else needed is not much. My sister wanted shot glasses for her favors and she bought it at 70 cents each which was not bad.

If you don't have a spare $100 for the test then save up until you do and then let both guys know that one of them may be father and you need a dna test to see which one it is.|`|aXYiOskmaa	call the maury povich paternity show.|`|LmaGaIosaa	You would need to know exact dates of when you were with each of the guys.  If you know this then calculate 38 weeks before your child was born and this will give you a close idea but this may still not be accuarte as you could go two weeks early or two weeks late with a birth of a baby so a dna test would only make it completely accurate.|`|i15KoiJhaa	Nothing short of DNA testing to determine Paternity is going to help.<br>  <br>  I can understand your fear in not wanting to have this conversation with either Man especially after 2 years....<br>  <br>  However, the only way to determine who is the Father of your Son is to make both Men aware that they may have Fathered your Son 2 years ago, and request DNA testing for a conclusion.|`|cTYAYrb9aa	Do a DNA test, your son had a right to know.|`|ESKslyfsaa	The only way to know for sure is a DNA test.|`|K2Wg3f9saa	Tell one or both that you suspect that the child could be his and that you will be asking for financial assistance (which you should do anyway) towards raising the child. This should jolt one or both to want to make double sure rather than have to pay maintenance, and so pay for a test. Maybe they could even split the cost btween them (or all 3 of you).<br>  <br>  If you go to a maintenance court,  the court can order a test if the person denies or doubts paternity. If you are sure that they are the only two, you only need to eliminate one to know who the real father is.<br>  <br>  This is something you need to sort out, rather now than later, even though it is difficult.|`|mrysAOpGaa	how the hell are we supposed to know, we werent there when you were ho'n around with two guys at once, and we dont know when you were ovulating or any of that..what a atupid question to ask..but guess what!! they have this really awesome thing out..its been ouut for..i dont know..FOREVER..its called a DNA test, yea its a really amazing thing, it tells you who the father of your baby is. check it out|`|v4DfbDEQaa	well if u cant have a dna test u will ever kno but who does the child look like more.... this wont give a certain answer but it a step forward|`|LyDPDzCdaa	YOU SHOULD ASK GOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|ZjEba9Pqaa	well you could try with who does your son look more like. but you cant really be sure unless you get a DNA test my love.

aXYiOskmaa	the up side is she's talked with your mom. very courageous on her part. at the moment, i guess the best thing you can do is be a great sister. try to be more involved in her life. distract her from cutting and from her new "friend". do stuff together. hopefully, by keeping the lines of communication open with her, she'll talk more instead of cutting.<br>  from my personal experience, there are many times when i wouldn't have made it through without the help of my older sister. she was the best.|`|AA12086491	Your sister needs professional help.  I understand how she got into this, but she needs to be somewhere that she can learn about how to stand up for herself and avoid this kind of situation again.  Her actions should have been to find this girl help, not make her feel justified by joining her.  It would be really good to get her out of that environment but besides your mom knowing, try going to school counselors to get ideas on where your sister can go for help.  You don't have to say its your sister, just say its someone you know that your worried about.|`|o93Agstdaa	Since she took the first step, the only thing  you can really do is be there for her. Let her know she is not alone, and that she can get trough it.|`|sRsGTgqIaa	Her friend may not be the reason she is cutting.  Sounds like she has been through a lot.|`|OWjbg4GYaa	I started cutting my self six years ago, and I could tell you from my own experience that most of my reasons for cutting is because of the great sadness and depression that sometimes I go through, mostly is because of family problems. For so many years I tried to stop, I even when to therapy, tried to get involve in church, everything, but sometimes is really hard to stop. I know exactly how your sister feels, she feels alone, lost, unloved, and sad really sad with no control over her emotions, so weak very weak, but at the same time she can't be weak she needs to be strong in order to deal with all the problems around her family, and the only way to prove to herself that she is strong is by cutting. This is a never ending game. All you could do is to be there for her, just love her, love her a lot no matter what please, she needs it, we need it.  If you need more info. on this subject feel free to e-mail me at nbenergy100@yahoo.com, I'll be more than happy to share my experience.|`|xqzE2tkqaa	she's cutting her wirsts cause she's not happy.<br>  <br>  maeby she feels so upset that she hurts herself instead of hurting somebody else, you for example.<br>  <br>  she needs help that's right! and im so proud she recognized it!<br>  most of people dont<br>  <br>  but...that's not all...she needs a bit of happyness in her life<br>  without that, not even the smartest doctors in the world woul fix that problem. <br>  <br>  take care of her, he seems to be a very brave girl<br>  <br>  kiss :)|`|P5RkJk5eaa	letting your sister know is the first part and don't stop treating her any different then you have just show her your love and let her know everything going to be ok and it not right to cut yourself even if your friends does and all the problem that going will get better and remember you got to go down before you can go up.<br>  i hope that helps k|`|l1JGL1DCaa	Sorry i really don't know but i'll try.<br>  You can try talking to her her but that will get her mad I don't really know what type of person she is so here are other suggestions<br>  <br>  *talk her out of it<br>  *Tell her friend to stay away<br>  * Help her to stop<br>  *Talk to her about the problems<br>  *Just eb there for her she needs all your love right now<br>  <br>  Hope it helps and i hope for a better future for you<br>  CAROL|`|Dowi63iuaa	Counseling maybe?

Self mutilation is a sign of someone who feels they have no control.  Seek the advice of a professional counselor and/or a support group.  Just know that you are not alone.  I watched a long-distance friend cut themselves on webcam for attention once.  It was a cry for help.  I felt sickened, angry, disheartened, and frustrated all at the same time.  Find someone you can talk to, and perhaps after your sister has had some counseling, you can let her know that you still love her and have not passed judgement on her actions.
5KZdTMPDaa	Tell your friend to think with her head and not with her heart.  Do the right thing, don't be soft and weak when it comes to situations like this.  Try one more time and ask nicely that he move out.  If not, Call the police and get a restraining order. No one should threaten anyone.  <br>  <br>  Before someone gets hurt or the child sees more than she needs to, do the right thing.|`|BV5ClWj7aa	she needs to follow the proper laws to get him out of her life. get a restraining order to keep him away. truth is either he is bluffing or he isnt but she has to protect her child. i will not comment on the steps she took to get to this situation but i will say that it is a lifes lesson and hopefully she has learned it WELL.|`|KLQWJrRyaa	I say contact your local authority this man is a crazy psycho if he threaten her then she has enough evidence to a restriction on him and if you can testify to his drinking and threats then for sure you can get a restriction on him!<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|rAXkpuzIaa	She needs Gods intervention!|`|bvEzuvTZaa	they are living with you?  if so, have word with your police dept. and let them know that you will be asking him to leave and that he threatened your girlfriend and ask the police when they could be there when asking him to leave and get court order for him to not to come around.  if it is her apt. to do the same and then move back in with her folks so there would more grown ups if he comes around to be able to have somebody call the police and the child safe.|`|epEm23bdaa	I would get a restraining order on him...but rememember its just a peice of paper so be safe.<br>  <br>  second I would move back in with my parents for a little while til he calms down and moves on then tell her when she does move out again dont let him know where she moved.<br>  <br>  <br>  good luck hun.|`|gDuDNeRcaa	if he is not on the lease where they are living now...she can have him evicted. if he tries to come back or isn't cooperating, get the police involved.|`|7EfUQ1MZaa	i think she need to sneak out the window so that she can leave run,run, run as fast as she can. to another state he will never know <br>  or unless she poison him hahaha im just kidding dont do that but im serious about sneaking out the window she need to take charge he just a bf they didnt get marred yet, <br>  <br>  she can leave anytime still she has the chance|`|ntcETBTQaa	Go to the police and get a restraining order.

Whether or not you move on to somebody new - you will be ok. Read books, hang out with friends ( I would avoid mutual friends for a little bit), watch funny movies (no romances!!), throw yourself into work (or school work), etc.<br>  <br>  Before you realize it, you won't be thinking of him that often. Soon after that - you will wonder why you felt so horrible in the first place. <br>  <br>  I promise, it may suck, but it will get better.|`|4EWCegiRaa	That has only happened to me once and I couldn't figure out what was wrong with me or how to fix it.

If your urges are this bad and your not even married and you already want to cheat then just stick to being a player. Wear a condom every time. The world doesn't need more f'ed up kids.|`|QmvYGkNJaa	If you genuinely want to sleep with her, then you shouldn't be marrying your fiance. If there's ANY hance of it happening, you should either postpone the wedding or tell your fiance. By the way, depending how far you are in planning the wedding, postponing it could cost you mega bucks, which YOU would be liable to pay, not her family. <br>  <br>  Keep it in your pants; you're about to marry the girl you apparently love more than any other in the world.|`|vtTpUCNfaa	You need to ask yourself whether you really love your fiance' or not. It is normal to find other women attractive but acting on those feeling is a whole different thing. If you don't think you can subside those feelings maybe you shouldn't be getting married.

It's ok being attracted to someone but wanting to have sex with her badly shows that you are not ready to commit to one woman. I could understand if it was a fantasy but to actually want to is baad. If you think you're going to cheat save your future wife grief and don't get married.|`|tW1k73R9aa	I would advise you to postpone the wedding and take time to think...it could be that you love your fiance but are scared of getting married and this is simply to give yourself an excuse not to marry (psycological stuff, go figure) or it could be that you love your fiance but deep down you know she would not satisfy your sexual desires and this is making you anxious. I think to be engaged to her you must love her, so I would suggest that you take some time to think about stuff, like whether she is the woman for you or not, and whether the feelings you have for the other girl are genuine or just because you are anxious, or more 'your type'. I wouldn't sleep with her, this would ruin things all around for everyone. Just take some time:)<br>  <br>  Personally I wouldn't marry a guy unless I thought he was hot, hot, hot!! so hot I had no eyes for anyone else. I know this because I did not marry a guy I was engaged to because deep down though I loved him, did not find him really that hot:( and in the end I couldn't go through with it, though I know a lot of girls who would have ie for the money or stability etc. (everyone has their own ideas, its a free world) Had I done it would have been miserable. Have never regretted my decision:)|`|H0vicK8Kaa	please dont get married!<br>  You'll just hurt your fiance / wife!

It happens whenever it feels right.  You should start by just kissing her romantically and giving her little kisses and then holding them out for longer.  If she doesn't resist, you can start 'snogging' with her.  Everything needs to move slowly and take shape the right way.|`|dtHjJah5aa	Wow.....snogging huh?  That is a term that I have to admit I haven't heard before.  I hope that is a term for snuggling....because at 14 and 16 you shouldn't be doing much else.  Good luck.

4HoVVCenaa	I do, under some circumstances. I want my women to be strong, have a personality, and be feisty... stand up for who and what they are. So if the anger is real it doesn't bother me. Fighting is a form of communication and is better than no communication. But one should always fight "fair". Dirty fighting is destructive. Fighting fair means the fight is about the issue, and side bar issues are not brought up just to hurt the partner. It has to do with respect.|`|4EWCegiRaa	Heck yeah I do!  I need a woman who's passionate and usually everything is a little better when she's a little angry (just a little).<br>  <br>  But not a woman who's a b*tch.|`|FzFSzilmaa	only part of the time... like during sex... the rest of the time, it is just boring... :D<br>  <br>  try meeting real life and stop reading romance novels...|`|8v40KEd0aa	My men did.

In fact, when my girl is angry she doesn't even want to talk to me.<br>  <br>  Though I would argue there's a fine line between her being angry and just fired up a little.  If I see her angry at someone else and getting fired up, then yes, it can be a bit of a turn on (as long as she doesn't go too far).<br>  <br>  Short answer - Yes, as long as she's not angry at me.|`|PCravWnIaa	depends on who she's angry at. i love seeing my girl get all worked up like she wants to kick somebody's ***, mostly because that pent up aggression gets used up in the bedroom if ya know what i mean.|`|ugaIZSjuaa	nooooooooooo so not cool well it depends if shes not angry at me and its about something else then its a good feel when i know i can make her feel better|`|NcFllN5Raa	Don't take out your anger on me, angry women.|`|AA10774661	Yes the angrier the better.

l50LNHYKaa	When my boyfriend and I started going out as a bday present his parents gave him a ticket for a 2 week tourbuss all over europe. he told me he wanted his freedome to do w.e and when he came home bcuz it was summer he wanted to have an open relationship. So before he left I acted completely different than other girls, if he did something to piss me off i wouldnt nag about it, i gave him a nice bday day bcuz his parents were away, i did everything a guy could want, then i let him go. when he came back from europe he called me up and he said he missed me and wanted to c me. a year later we are hapilly together and hes happy that i stuck around so try that even if hes dumped u b the gf every guy wants but also act as if ur not interested n e more and that will get him back|`|AA10184623	I think maybe you should let him see what's out there because he might realize he loves you all the more. I know it is probably not what you wanted to hear but if he's only been with you and know one else then he might be curious about it if you end up married and then make a huge mistake by cheating so just let him figure it out.|`|A94u2In8aa	Try dating someone else.Maybe someone he doesn't really like or is intimidated by.Guys tend to take things for granted.Once he sees that he cant have you anymore he may want to get back together with you.Unless he loses you or has the illusion of losing you he wont really realize what you two had together.And dont run after him.Go on about your daily life as though you do not NEED him.Let him know in some subtle way that you WANT him but not NEED him.That you can get other guys.Good luck sweetie!|`|BV5ClWj7aa	Let him go.. cant make a dog stay home in the gate.. not saying hes a dog im just saying that when they sneak out the gate and leave if or when they come back its up to you if you wanna give him that chance again. hell you might find someone new and better.. someone different that you like|`|QfitgXqSaa	act NONCHALANT...dont be clingy..make him realize he needs you by not sticking to him or begging him 4 anything|`|2hyP31E9aa	Me personally, i chose my relationships carefully. I didnt want to get hurt constantly and that is really what exsperiencing other relationships is a series of getting hurt in different ways, but when you meet someone special who treats you right and cares about you, it would be the stupidest move EVER to toss it away on the basis of " i wanna try relationships with other people" Try and have him stick with it for a while longer or keep him into your relationship, really explain to him how you feel about him and that you want this relationship to keep going cause who knows what could happen it might lead to al ife with both of you holding eatch other. best of luck|`|JTrWRUBiaa	I'm not sure what makes a guy (or any person) jealous. I, myself, am easily brought to feel jealousy, and I hate it. Being jealous is certainly not a choice.<br>  <br>  As for your additional details:<br>  I think if he wants to leave you (whether temporarily or permanently), that is his choice. If you keep pursuing him and telling him that he will regret it, you may actually push him further away.<br>  Just tell him that you think the relationship is a good one, and you feel it should continue rather than end. Don't go overboard with this, or you may seem desperate and scare him away. <br>  <br>  *Just explain, calmly, how you feel, and let him make his choice.*<br>  <br>  As for him not being ready to be committed, that could be true. It sounds like you may both be fresh out of high school, and at that age, it's pretty normal to not want to commit.|`|cydakP87aa	i think you just have to let him go.<br>  you dont want to make him feel trapped, and if he stays it might eventually come to that. <br>  he should experience other girls, and you will experience other guys, and thats good for both of you.<br>  i know you really dont want to right now, but just give it a little time and it will seem better. <br>  break ups are always tough, but sometimes when we least want to admit it, it is the best thing for us. <br>  just let him go.<br>  he probably will come back, it seems like they always do.<br>  just be strong. you can do this. <br>  it will get better. i promise.|`|4HoVVCenaa	Insecurity makes people jealous. But wanting to experience life and to date is a sign of maturity. Life is about learning, including learning how to have relationships so that when you select a mate, you have a higher probability for an LTR. You both should date other people, then you won't feel so insecure.|`|u7GBP579aa	tell him|`|LJkw276Laa	everything lol seriously|`|yyIVrngcaa	let him be, act like you're ok with his decision,...if he sees you don't care then he might start feeling like he'd rather stick around...it's weird but it works (sometimes)|`|ntcETBTQaa	Let him go. he will come crawling back after he realizes what he lost... then it will be too late|`|maj3V0ioaa	hang out with ur friends n show him u can have fun and be happy without him going to another guy will make him lose interest in u so dont do that
kqxddLNoaa	Make sure he doesn't look like he's trying to hard. Get rid of any facial hair. The best clothes would be quiet baggy so you can't see his baggage. If he's going to look like hes dressing him up, then dress him up, you could dress him up as a witch i'm sure your friend wasn't that specific. That way he is a girl. If not then just make sure as i've said he doesn't look like he's trying too hard. Not over done on the make up. You'll have to teach him how to walk, talk and act like a girl. Talking's not to hard just see that the clothes are tight so his balls are squashed. hehe. hope this has helped have fun, sounds like fun =]|`|9NfLuHo9aa	then when he says to you, honey im gay you gonna wanna know how it happened.
gK0vcdnDaa	I am feeling very much the same way.  <br>  <br>  To remedy the feeling in myself I typed up the list in Excel with my Fiancé, with all the information we could need (e-mail, physical address, phone numbers, which "side" they belong to, accommodations, etc) and I e-mailed it to my mother, his mother, his sister and my step-mother.  They all filled in the info that they could and I went to work on the rest.  <br>  <br>  I scoured placed like Facebook, MySpace, my old Yearbooks, and his, as well as his work roster, tried to remember old co-workers that I was close to and friends from towns I've lived in, college buddies and I even went as far as to look at my grade school signature book.  <br>  <br>  THEN I had to go through and decide who I really wanted there, we are limited to 90 guests at the ceremony, so that helped limit it to the family and closest of friends.  We are inviting nearly 225 (including kids and unknown dates), but we are having a "destination" wedding and have already been told that about 75 won't make it (which cuts about 120 off that list), but we are extending the invite regardless.<br>  <br>  Anywhoo - another thing that helped me was saying the names aloud and trying to think of whom else is important with that "group" or that person.  Saying my friend Patrick's name made me remember his parents, and his parents helped me remember a girl from high school whose parent's and I were close, So I'm inviting them as well, but not their daughter.  <br>  <br>  Little things will help jog your memory.  Looking through an address book, or old e-mails.  <br>  <br>  IF you do miss someone and they inquire before the wedding, determine if they are someone you want there - if so let them know that you'd be honored for them to be there but you didn't have their address/contact information, apologize and get them the information right away.  Keep some extra invitations on hand specifically for this purpose.  <br>  <br>  If they ask about it after the wedding, you can tell them that you didn’t have their contact information or tell them that it was a small wedding and you thought of them but couldn’t invite everyone.<br>  <br>  Good luck!  <br>  -Elle|`|pub2GLZPaa	When I was doing invites, I felt the same way....<br>  <br>  I asked my mom, went through both maternal and fraternal sides of the family tree on my side, then thought of close family friends..... then did the same for my fiance's side.....<br>  <br>  After that, thought of my friends- people I've met traveling, went to school with, I scavenged through my facebook "friends" list, searched all my emails to see if maybe an old address might spark a thought.<br>  <br>  In the end though, even if you accidentally miss someone its not a big deal, you can always invite them over the phone and say you didn't have their address but the invites on its way.... etc.|`|QJslTCUBaa	Can you ask his parents, your parents, siblings?|`|UUQXNhMtaa	Let him go over the list when he gets back|`|rpVQpJA7aa	Run the list by someone in his family, and also him, then your mother or sister or something.

I think you're being too technical about this.|`|884v4VhGaa	Sorry that this isn't entirely relevant, but in Canada the way it works is that you can use either name once you're married, as long as it isn't for fraudulent purposes. So a marriage license is usable in pretty much any circumstance where you would need to show change-of-name. <br>  <br>  This is merely a formalized version of what is done socially. As far as I know, your name is legally the same as it used to be, but socially it is not. After all, you can call yourself whatever you want, no matter what your legal name.|`|kN4EaiUDaa	well technically your considered your new last name when you say I DO, but to make it legal you have to go get a new driver's license and social security card for it to be changed in legal government information. i would advise that you take care of all the legal paperwork the week after you get back from your honeymoon. if your anything like me i was ready and could hardly wait to share a last name with my husband|`|AA11310817	You can change your last name as soon as the marriage certificate comes in...

ifgzHzA3aa	A good piece of jewelry would be nice.  Nothing engraved or wedding specific, just something she can keep for always.|`|kUE3Ddktaa	It depends on what she's into. She's your best friend, right? So you should know her pretty well. What would she most appreciate?<br>  <br>  Jewelry is nice, but only if you know her taste and know she wears jewelry often (and can pick out something she'll love). Maybe she's really more into great handbags, or first-edition books, or live music - what about concert tickets, or a session at a rock-climbing gym, or another experience that she'd love to try? Make it something the two of you can do together - NOT wedding related, but totally for her - and let the photos and memories be your keepsakes.|`|rpVQpJA7aa	I would take her to lunch and let her know how much you aprreciate what she has done for you, then go get massages together...send her flowers maybe or one of those edible arrangements fruit basket things.|`|xFv6LirIaa	But what about a very nice spa gift basket she can use at home?

0fbcc59fc901bca7e0ca600714a7fb88aa	Hmmm, best years of my life.  Carefree years were when I was younger around 5-8.  Trips to Tennessee with my family, my dad playing ball with us, learning to ride a bike and my dad being there to make sure I didn't fall.  Sitting at the small kids table in my bedroom in front of our window that was open and the fresh breeze coming through while playing tea party and having those clips for curtains dangling off our ears as if our ears were pierced, OUCH. Swinging on the swing set to see how high we can go while singing Day dreams about night things by Ronnie Milsap (my fav growing up).  Oh, and playing guns and indians with my brother and our friends.<br>  Now the other best in life?  Now with my husband.  My life was so stressful trying to make it in life.  Wrong choices in men got me married and divorced a couple times.  But almost 2 years ago, I married my best friend.  The one I truelly believe in my heart that God wants me with.  He spoils me in the best and simple ways, like playing with my hair as I fall asleep in his arms.  Works so I can stay at home. Calls me babydoll and never lets go of my hand when we are walking or just sitting and watching tv.  I for the first time in my LIFE, look forward to the rest of my life with him.  Feeding him, taking care of him, adoring him and loving him.|`|vBR9nB81aa	I have to say the best years of my life is right now actually. Im 20 years old, I just had a baby girl 9 months ago. I have my dream job, training horses everyday, I go to school, and I have met a great great guy. I am the happiest I have ever been and I am free to do whatever I wish with my life. My life is somewhat of a struggle being a single mother, but it pushes me more forward and I love my life! <br>  <br>  Most people would love their childhood because there was no worries, everything was carefree. I did love my childhood, but the relationship I had with my family as a child and teen was not as good of one as I have with them now. I love my life more now as much of a challenge it is, then as a child.|`|RzkbwWYoaa	high school years and the 90's but mostly the high school years|`|yPMPx78waa	the 90's :)<br>  everythings all technology and dangerous now, NOW i could not walk down the street in the middle of the night without getting raped.|`|LhIxnRTzaa	I'd say just before I hit puberty...nothing seemed to matter and I was so carefree.

Sometimes people just get caught up and don't realize where their actions are leading them!! That said, there is NO good excuse for it!!|`|7u8hX3Hkaa	Depends , <br>  <br>  There are a million reasons to get some on the side while still being <br>  in love with someone .<br>  <br>  I relate love and sex as two different things .<br>  <br>  Yes , one can be in love with the person they are having sex with , <br>  but it is not required .|`|1bubNOQmaa	No, there are many reasons that people cheat and often times it has little to do with love, especially for men who typically aren't as emotionally connected to sex as women are.|`|Wrf5orAuaa	Not necessarily. An affair can happen on the spur of the moment, and everything turns upside down|`|jBigEy0Caa	No, most people who have an affair don't leave their spouse for the one they are cheating with.  If they do it usually doesn't work out.|`|c95b6cf1e21b1025509e8470848d6b6aaa	No. Human beings make mistakes all the time. Just because you are in love does not exclude you from making a bad decision.

But you are correct, if a guy truly loves his significant other, there should never be an affair.  Why would he need or want to?|`|TYGgRjqDaa	I don't believe so.  There could be other reasons.  He could love her but be lonely (ie, just had children).  However, if he did have an affair the question is can you forgive?|`|xvey8ixPaa	No. Usually people cheat becuase they themselves have a problem, and it does not mattter if they love someone or not, they are going to be that way. It usually has nothing to do with the person that was cheated on. The problems run WAY deeper than that.|`|oche3k5taa	I think that if you truely love someone, your not going to want to be with anyone else.

Humans are attracted to others and often the little head overrides the bigger head.  Has nothing to do with whether he truly loved her or not, just if he fell in lust with someone else.|`|J74Y5LKxaa	No, that's not fair.  I truly believe that the feelings and desires you have for somebody can have absolutely NOTHING to do with the feelings and desires you have for somebody else.  On the other hand, people who are 100% satisfied typically don't cheat.  So where does the REAL problem lie?|`|467be00aa9eff8cd86b019690cc79aa4aa	That is what you would think but men cheat for many different reasons.

Sure they are using you.|`|UBMuPUmzaa	Do not allow this woman to take over your life and make you feel bad. She does not sound like a true friend. You have already gone above and beyond to help her out. These are things that she and her Husband should be doing to take care of their family. When you stop giving them rides, they will find them from somewhere else. <br>  <br>  It's one thing to help someone out who appreciates it. That makes you feel good. But when you help someone who shows no appreciation, you will only drain yourself, and dwell on this negative situation until you take care of it. <br>  <br>  You sound like a nice person, and I think your positive energy would be better given to another friend who truly loves you.

ix5Wmhy0aa	If she IM's you, text's you and talks to you a lot, then I think she peobably likes you a lot more than you think. It's obvious you really care about her, and it's totally normal not to like anyone else.<br>  <br>  If you really want to resolve this, you should just tell her how you feel. She could suprise you by saying she feels the same. It's not fair on you to drag it out any longer because you sound really upset about it, and if it is annoying you then you should deal with it sooner rather than later.<br>  <br>  If you don't want to just tell her outright, then you should invite her places more. Just you and her. Take her places that are thoughtful, and show that you really know her. Find out about her hobbies so that you know you're taking her somewhere that will interest her. She will get the hint soon, and will like you even more because you have shown that you really know her.<br>  <br>  If you really make an effort not to get annoyed with her, and be mean with her, then she will be more comfortable with you. If she is always worried that you will get mad at her, she may be more careful about what she does and says around you, and your relationship will get more strained.<br>  <br>  I don't think there is anything wrong with you, but I do think that you need to control your emotions when around her if you want her to like you as much as you like her.<br>  <br>  You sound really nice, so i'm sure it will all work out fine :) Good luck!<br>  <br>  <br>  If this helped at all, could you please spare a vote for my school? <br>  The details are here:<br>  <a href="http://plugaway.weebly.com/please-vote.html" rel="nofollow">http://plugaway.weebly.com/please-vote.h...</a><br>  <br>  It'll only take a few seconds and would help me so much!<br>  Thanks x|`|4b0BWPc2aa	i dont think there is anything wrong with you. i think the aggravation is actually because you put in all this effort into caring abotu her and liking her, but she didnt show it back. well did you ever actually come out and say "hey guess what i like you"  cause i bet if you do that she will say she dfoes to. it just takes one of you to actually say it,. you cant sit there and jsut think that everything will just fall into place, you have to work for the best things in life.|`|ibFTUi1taa	I think you answered this yourself. She probably doesn't like you like you like her and you are frustrated about this whole situation. <br>  You need to sit down and talk to her and explain what you are feeling, and that you are sorry for how you've been acting. If she doesn't like you, then I would move on because this relationship is not a healthy relationship for either of you.|`|ogU0AEkOaa	You know i bet you shes knows you like her like that but she don't wanna too much act on it!! because she likes you and would even date you but not now... so she plays the friend role whenever possible and don't put out too much rope to hang herself just in case she needs to back out... women are like that... your like a saftey blanket... if all else fells at least your still there!!!|`|9Yeq2Hwvaa	When they say that opposites attract they mean it. It also goes back to when you were in gradeschool and mom always told the little girl that the boy that was always spitting spitballs and pulling her hair actually liked her. You think that the woman will confuse cokiness for confidence. It is common and actually some women do. But if she is not easily fooled she will just get angry with you and annoyed and stop talking to you all together. Relationships like this are based on anger etc tend to be fun at least sexually. lol If you were involved with her and you both got angry and then you had sex or even made out it would make the situation more intense and invigorating. Perhaps if this angle is not working try ignoring her for a while then go back to her and start talking to her and then try to be nice. If you really like this girl then do that then ask her out. Don't beat around the bush so to say and avoid the situation. Most girls are shy and do not like to make the first move so, just be a man and ask her for cofee or something. You won't regret it.|`|jlUczlQZaa	It sounds like you are afraid of being rejected by this girl who was originally just a good friend and who you now feel more deeply?<br>  <br>  Don't blame her for acting the same even though you feel differently, that is not fair, however, you may be sending her confusing signals and you may be reading her signals incorrectly.<br>  <br>  Unless you want to continue this emotional roller-coaster, you have to confront your feelings and discuss them with her.  You may loose a close friend, develop a new closer relationship with her or find that even though she doesn't feel the same way, you both can continue caring for each other as friends and move on to liking someone new romantically.  <br>  <br>  Either way, it will all be out in the open and you should not feel so confused anymore about all the mixed emotions and signals.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|dtHjJah5aa	Perhaps, you like her because she isn't into you. Sadly there are alot of good women and men out there who 'love' the most unloveable people in the world or people who just aren't right for that person.  It doesn't make sense.  You say you are mean to her because she annoys you when she IM's or texts you.  Perhaps she doesn't IM or text you more because every time she does, you end up being mean to her.  I think you could like another girl, but you don't want to.  It's in your head...and you need to talk it out with a councelor or someone you trust.  Good luck.  I hope this helps.|`|yyIVrngcaa	Infatuation/Obsession.|`|u0eTvggDaa	Well if you have to make your self be nice to her, then it's not going to work out.<br>  <br>  It does sound like your holding a grudge against her, for something. have you ever even asked her to hang out with you or something? you never know she might end up liking you.<br>  <br>  If It's meant to be, it will be. You can't force these kinds of things.<br>  <br>  The best thing that i could tell you to do is tell her how you feel, and be honest about it!<br>  <br>  <br>  GoodLuck!|`|jMONfztfaa	first off the relationship you two have is a 2-way street. whether u guys see it or not. if you truly care for her, then just try be and positive towards her no matter what. and she should do the same to you.|`|3Ewo8Pgzaa	Maybe you WANT to like her a lot.  she annoys the life out of you, so you can't be that into her.|`|lxB9UgCiaa	well just be chill when she agravates you will learn that girls arent perfect and will mess up and ocasionally piss you off but from what youve said it seems that u 2 like each other .........ask her out

My oldest sisters are twins and sixteen years older than me.  When my mom got sick, I lived with them for a while, so we were pretty close for a long time.<br>  <br>  As I grew though, I started to notice a lot of things about them that didn't mesh well with the life I wanted to live.  Both were pot smokers, dated abusive men, had trouble keeping jobs, etc.  So, as adults, we no longer spend a lot of time together.<br>  <br>  I still appreciate and respect all that they did for me while I was young.  I've had the chance to help them out on many occasions and I still consider it an honor to be able to pay them back a little for all they did for me.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, we just don't spend a lot of time hanging out together anymore since we don't have any common interests and most of the things they consider fun would cause me to lose my job and my family's respect, so, there's that.|`|QF3Lbm7Paa	I argue with my sister and hate her annoying guts on a regular basis, but if anybody wanted to hurt her they would have to get through me first and i would have a BIG sledge hammer- she's my baby sister and when we don't argue we are best friends who have grown up together, when your kids its worse cos your kids- and they haven't learnt to share and the importance of not poking people.

i15KoiJhaa	My perception is his Son is finally at an age where your Husband feels comfortable enough to let him know the jest of why things didn't work out with his Mom... and to express that he wishes her (His Ex Wife) no ill will...<br>  <br>  I don't think he is regretting that the marriage ended, but more so may have felt over the years that his Son had received incorrect information from his Mother as to why the marriage ended.<br>  <br>  It doesn't seem from what you've said that they have kept in close contact (Your Hubby and his Ex) and to me... again... it seems that your Husband was looking for some understanding from his Son in letting him know there are 2 sides to every story....Not something you can (or should do) when your Children are little... his Son is now an adult and the Father/Son relationship has matured.<br>  <br>  If nothing else... my guess is his Son probably felt a little more uncomfortable hearing this from his Dad then you did in over-hearing it.|`|efbb15bd3b273c3e6801e5fe2b1add09aa	Not everything is about you!  This is clearly not about you and it was clearly something that he and his son needed to talk about.  Your husband was simply trying to impart some wisdom to his child and perhaps seeking some type of forgiveness from him at the same time.<br>  <br>  IT IS NOT ABOUT YOU.  STOP FEELING INSECURE.|`|c95b6cf1e21b1025509e8470848d6b6aaa	He never said he regretted leaving his ex...or asked for info on her.  You are being jealous and paranoid. She exists, they were married, why wouldn't he want her to find somebody? He found you, right? You are looking for something that was not there.|`|ae3ecab489f9cbbdd2b51fb0492f64d3aa	I think you are acting like you are very insecure with your marriage.  A marriage is two people and when it ends it is 50% his fault and 50% her fault. I feel bad for the son. It was not very mature of  his Father to do that to him. I think the son handled it in a very mature way. Because you only see the son once in a while and the ex lives far away, I would just let this go in one ear and out the other. However, I would let your husband know that you felt he was wrong in saying what he did to his son about his mother. That you felt he was being very unfair to his son. The son loves his Mother and his Dad needs to remember that.|`|uP4qnB6raa	Tell him strait out that you don't appreciate him having conversations with anyone about his past [EX]. Tell him that the past is the past, and he doesn't need to be bringing up old **** anymore. Good luck!|`|1bubNOQmaa	With the way you have phrased it here, it doesn't seem like he is regretting his choice, just concerned for her.  He apparently was with her for a long time and she is the mother of his son, so he will always care about her.  What's more, as his current wife you might try to feel relieved that he doesn't feel nothing towards her, it shows that even after a divorce he still cares about what happens to her - which means that he is loyal and not cold.  It is somewhat awkward that he was talking to his son about sex with his mother, but the son is an adult so I guess that's okay...  Anyway, he chose to end that relationship and no matter how much he might care or worry about her, he made that decision and chose you, so try not to worry.|`|kN4EaiUDaa	he could just be curious. maybe even just to see if his life is better than his exwifes. maybe an ego booster. talk to your husband to see if he does have feelings for his exwife and also ask him if he ever heard that she has changed her ways and was a good person would he ever go back to her. just be blunt with him, if he's a good man he'll be honest even if its at the cost of hurting your feelings. also you might think that he feels like the only thing he can talk to his son about is his mother. maybe he doesnt feel like there's more to talk about and that his exwife is a common ground. or maybe he wanted to talk about his mom to make his son feel more comfortable about him having a new wife. i wouldnt assume the worst but i would defiantly talk to him about it|`|AIuN5Lw9aa	If he said it within earshot, I imagine he wasn't hiding anything from you. But it is possible that he cares for her without the romantic feelings attached and just wants the best for her. I've seen this happens between divorced couples; they care for each other w/o the sexual feelings.<br>  <br>  Maybe you should have a heart-to-heart with him...|`|m81dfyOYaa	I honestly don't think it's appropriate for your husband to be talking to his son about the sex life he had with his mother. I'm not a prude at all, have always been open with my now grown children about sex, but my sex life with their father (my ex) is off limits.  You don't have to handle it, it's done.  Me, I would have told my husband how inappropriate it was. In the meantime I talk to my children about their father (we've been divorced for 23 years), and my husband talks to his children, in my presence, about their mother. Both my ex and his ex are still a part of the kids' lives and it's nothing to feel uncomfortable about.
9Yeq2Hwvaa	i understand where you are coming from with the oral aspect of this question. My boyfriend and I have been together for almost a year and he himself enjoys oral a bit more than sex. I can understand in a way since he is more experienced in that area seeing as he was a virgin when we first started dating. Basically when it comes down to it. Just talk to him and tell him how you feel.If he really is as caring and compasionate as you say he is then he will understand. Also men tend to enjoy oral more than regular sex because they tend to ejaculate quicker while women get more pleasure by the g spot with is more sensative to penial insersion. So most men enjoy oral more they just wont admit it. What my boyfriend and I do is rotate off one night he picks what we do the next i pick. Do something like that, that way you can please both of your needs and see what he likes to do. I am sure you can think of many ideas that would work. Good luck hon =]|`|4HoVVCenaa	He is being selfish.

To not confront the issue will only make your life miserable. Could it be because he's the boss he represents Power? You see him in a position that your husband is not in? If your husband was the boss you would not have to work? So many factors and such little time. You unfortunately will have to deal with it because you cannot avoid him at work. Trust that you will always do what's right and not be tempted by lust. I'm 100% sure you are not in love with the guy but you are a bit obsessed with his position. I wish you luck dear in getting through this hurdle.|`|JQRjub1baa	Remember that your  family is your primary priority that is your foundation and love and affection but someone else ?<br>  you need to sit down and reflect upon it deeply ,and ask this question <br>  yourself you will  find out what family means and what it takes to build a family. consider reflecting for all.|`|AA11319441	Whatever you do, don't act on your feelings.

I will tell you what they talk about..<br>  <br>  Basically, having a crush on someone else while you're in a relationship is a very normal thing.  It's awkward, but you need to address the issue with yourself.<br>  <br>  You can think that there's something wrong with your relationship, your guy, you.. but the fact is, is that there isn't.<br>  <br>  Many times you develop a crush on someone because you admire certain traits that they possess.  Your boss.. is he affluent?  Does he exude charm?  Maybe it's his confident demeanor or success.. something must be attracting you to him.  What's funny, though, is that these traits that we admire and are fond of are often things we wish we possessed in ourselves.  Why not take some time to analyze your crush, the reasons why you are attracted to this other person.. and then try to develop these things in yourself?  Maybe it's time to be more aggressive about getting a promotion.. maybe you're not feeling very happy with yourself.. I really can't say, but give it some thought!<br>  <br>  Maybe your relationship has grown a little stale.  Things do, over time.  What's important is that you and your husband try to schedule some together time hopefully around once a week.  Between work, family, and a daughter, I imagine your life has been kind of hectic!  It's really important, for not only your sake, the sake of your relationship, and the sake of your daughter, that you and your husband have good experiences and have fun!  <br>  <br>  Relationships can take a lot of work, and I understand that, if you're already really busy, this could seem like an unwanted problem to deal with.  I can also understand that it seems like an easy escape to run to another man in these times.  However, it's very unpractical and more than likely a recipe for disaster!|`|XY2K3Z0Uaa	Sounds like to me that your NOT in love you just have a crush on this guy....therefore if you do not act on your feelings then everything should be fine. To bad if it's that you like him deal with it because that's life. Be true to your husband no matter what.|`|Cb2am6wyaa	Trying to fall out of love with someone that you're not really wanting to fall out of love with is hard.  I know you said you want to stop loving him..but its a lot more complicated than that.  There are things that this guy is obviously doing to make you love him..and he needs to stop and you need to distance yourself from him.  Maybe drop little hints to your husband here and there so that he can start doing whatever it is this guy is doing.  Spend alone time with your husband..i know how hard that can be with a new baby, but you need to do that for yourselves and your daughter.  Try and bring back that spark you and your husband first had..and again, just try and stay away from this guy as much as you can.  Its going to be really hard in the beiggning..but you can do it if you that is what you really want

rInv89Xnaa	Okay i would sit down with your "dearest" and the girl that told her and just listen to what they have to say. and then tell them what really had happened!|`|1uRUaSblaa	So sorry that you have fallen out with her.<br>  Did something ELSE happened that made<br>  her feel this way? How long and how did <br>  you know this gal? Why is she finding it <br>  so tough to trust you?Could she be needing<br>   more time and space to calm down before <br>  giving you the 'trial'? What is her personality<br>  like?I believe she is hurt and may just wish <br>  to be alone for now.If she has really passed<br>  you the 'death sentence' for the relationship,<br>  you may want to consider moving on. <br>  She sounds like someone with serious <br>  emotional issues.Give her time to sort out <br>  her mind.It will be tough to handle her<br>  fragile heart for now.|`|fPHjh4Jsaa	this is easy<br>  since you don't even know the other girl, find out who is feeding her this crap, could be someone that is trying to break you 2 up<br>  <br>  you can always get her together with whoever told her and this girl that you supposely flirted with all together and confront the situation once and for all|`|7b882f43c0724ab2516a55698652a19daa	Sometimes she may have some friends who may not like you for certain reasons or our of just pure jealousy. It happens. They may make their own opinions, but it should not matter to you.<br>  <br>  Tell your girlfriend that you never flirted with her. Tell her that you dont know why someone else thinks you flirted with someone else, but you do not want to do that. and you love ur gf a lot.<br>  <br>  And please please, please, be true to her. when you are true, words just speaks for itself.
A2G9foewaa	I got married in Sedona on 8/8/08 and I have to say it was absolutely spectacular and I would definitely recommend it.  The site we got married was Red Rock Crossing in The Village of Oak Creek just outside of Sedona, we only had about 20 people but the view was wonderful.|`|lYZ71zYAaa	Sedona is the perfect place to be married in. I went there last summer with my daughter, and her family It is just beautiful. You'll love the mountains. Good Luck.
NQFV2AdZaa	Sorry, but you're too young to be thinking of marriage if you're still at school. He sounds really immature aswell, although you showed a lot of maturity by making the effort to change for him. It looks to me like he's had cold feet about making a commitment with you and is making lame excuses to argue with you. First he says you are too controlling, then after you change and he can't use that excuse any longer, he's using trust to carry it on. Talk to him and ask him why he's making lame excuses to fight with you. Tell him if he can't appreciate you then you won't be hanging around to be abused any longer. Good luck!|`|OAYaeW22aa	ok tell ppl that you arent on drugs and if its true then you can say u are telling the truth|`|LIh8jWuqaa	just simply be qiet when hes angry and talk sweety cuz one has to be calm wen one is angry things will get better|`|AA11200879	stop trying to change others, just be cool with yourself dont hurt yourself let it be|`|2xMtNeWiaa	wow this is kind of like my situation. although i wasnt close to marriage or anything. my girlfriend broke up with me so she could "concentrate on school work." we are both in college and i undersatnd that she needs to work. but I work full time, and go to school full time AND find time for her. so i found it to be very backstabbing for her to break up with me without even trying it out. (she broke up with me first week of school). since then, she's been telling me what a mistake she made and she tells me everyday that she loves me(we rarely used to say we love eachother). and now i just dont really look at her the same way. its hard to get the trust back, cuz its always gonna be in the back of your mind. <br>  <br>  basically.. the thing to do now is to make new memories, and show him new things, new trustworthy traits of yours to gain him back. its not gonna be easy, and its not gonna happen over night. good luck to you!|`|PSGK1zXLaa	I'd start by having a friendly conversation, when both of you guys are level headed. Look back into past and find a moment where both of you guys enjoyed each others company. Go back to that place and talk it out. But most important is to listen to each other. Love , trust and respect has to be present in every relationship, one can not exist without the other. You say there is mistrust, well that is definetely a problem but is not a problem that you can't fix if you still love and respect each other. It's hard but time can fix that problem. You have to start by being friends again and eventually becomes lovers again. You can't lose that friendship in a relationship. Is no greater feeling in the world IMO when you are able to be with someone that is your bestfriend and your lover at the same time. Somewhere along the line you guys forgot to be friends.. Doing things to enjoy each other ... Also space time apart from each is essential, give time to miss each other.. Do nice things for one another without  expecting anything in return. If you truly love him.. then do just that. Love him.. concentrate your energy on making him happy everyday ... Now, you have to truly ask yourself and dig deep within yourself if you truly love this person. Then you'll know no sacrifice is great for the one you love... Sometimes in silence we find the answer, just because he doesn't talk to you when you do something nice that he doesn't appreciate it. Just give it time and do not expect anything.. Good Luck :-)

What is affordable for the new york executive may not be affordable for the average joe. Everyone has their limitations and it is hard to say what someone can or cannot consider decent and fits in their budget. If $100 is affordable and decent for the buyer, then $100. If 2k is affordable and decent then 2k. It is just what the buyer can do without breaking their pocket. I would never want my fiance to take out our CD's, checking account and savings account just to get me a ring so i could be "keeping up with the jones' ". Be logical and do the best you can. If she loves you if will not matter, she will love you just for asking her.  It would not be decent to put yourself in financial ruin over a ring.|`|7G4hisdzaa	What a question!  Lol.

I think even if your significant other says the ring isn't a "big deal," it is - and you should make sure to invest a solid amount into it.  It's one of the most significant purchases you'll make in a lifetime, and the time, thought and effort that goes into the ring should reflect that.<br>  <br>  Just as a note, I proposed to my wife a few years ago with a beautiful, diamond engagement ring.  I relied on a lot of my buddies who got married before me for pointers during my shopping process, and they were unanimous in telling me that no matter the ring, make sure it is properly graded when you purchase it.  You should go through GIA (Gemological Institute of America) for your diamond grading reports, if you're wondering who to go to.  Ask jewelers if they sell jewelry with accompanying GIA grading reports - if they don't, go to another jeweler.  There's only one way of really knowing what you're getting, and in making such a major purchase, you obviously deserve to know.  <br>  <br>  Being aware of specifically GIA grading reports made my shopping experience exponentiallyy more pleasant.  I basically was able to pick my budget, go into retailers, and narrow down my search by who I knew was most reputable according to who could provide me with a GIA report along with my purchase.  <br>  <br>  Check them out online if you want more info - it was very helpful for me a few years ago, so hopefully it will do the same for you.  <br>  <br>  Best of luck!|`|UIXKTaghaa	It's not about cost, it's about what you think she'll like.  I went with my fiance to buy the ring and we had a lovely day together.  We knew our budget was limited so I got a zirconia one for ￡25.  It's cheap, but looks like a diamond and no-one knows the difference.  <br>  <br>  Weddings are expensive and only you know how much money you have.  Speaking from experience, I would have been happy with a ring from a cracker.  I didn't care about the cost, and actually just had one of his neck chains for 8 weeks instead of a ring as we didn't have the opportunity to go and buy one together as I was living away at the time.<br>  <br>  If you want my advice, then don't spend a lot on the ring, instead spend time working out your proposal.  <br>  <br>  Women like a bit of romance, I'd much rather have a romantic proposal and a tacky ring.  Than the other way around.<br>  <br>  The ring can be changed at a later date for something she likes, in fact, unless you know her finger size it will probably have to be, the proposal memory can't be changed at any cost.<br>  <br>  You can work out a budget for the ring together after the proposal. - providing she accepts of course!|`|0PCaKDxHaa	any amount is acceptable for a ring... some girlfriends are more sentimental and want something that has been in the family for generations... and other girlfriends are more materialistic and want the biggest flashiest ring that anyone has ever seen...  so what you spends depends on your girlfriend...<br>  <br>  some girls want a small real diamond... others want  HUGE real rock... it all depends on what she wants...<br>  <br>  some girls want platinum settings... others are fine with white gold... <br>  <br>  the cost of an engagement ring varies greatly depending on the specs of the ring you are looking to get...<br>  <br>  some girls would be just as happy to get a ring from a cracker jacks box... others would think you were nuts if you proposed with a 25cent ring... <br>  <br>  you know your girlfriend better than we do... you need to take into account what she'd appreciate... and then you need to check with your finances... whatever your bank account dictates as being appropriate has to be considered too... its not all what she wants... its what you can reasonably afford... you cant go thousands of dollars into debt before you even start planning the wedding...|`|dDkbDIqnaa	As a receiver of a beautiful engagement ring worth about ￡1500.00 i can say that it isnt the ring that is the priority, it is the meaning... that 1500.00 ring was given to me by my now EX fiance and to be honest, i'd rather have had a priceless boyfriend than a peice of metal on my finger...|`|yah14b6gaa	my ring cost about 5 grand but it doesn't matter how much it cost it's the thought that counts there really pretty rings that have real  Diamonds and cost less then a grand but if she loves you she should except the ring that you can afford|`|aipChC3haa	The engagement ring traditonaly is more expensive that the wedding ring, so I'd have to say about $800-1200.|`|DUPOEk1daa	Tradition doesn't matter anymore.<br>  Spend what you can afford, without skimping.<br>  If you need to save money, then SAVE.

ZDC81VjZaa	It's Eve's fault.  <br>  <br>  Damn woman couldn't follow one simple direction and that was to NOT eat the forbidden fruit of Knowledge.  Of course, she didn't want to be the ONLY one who'd betrayed God's order so she connived Adam to eat of it as well.  <br>  <br>  God found out and cast them from the Garden of Eden and told Eve that she would bare pain in childbirth.  <br>  <br>  Of course, you can't talk Biblicaly in most schools any longer so this may not be the greatest answer but it IS a factual answer.<br>  <br>  Hmmm... wet dreams.

SNVauR3laa	If they are truly just friends, why is he being so secretive? Are you the type that is irrational, and controlling? If not, then you need to be honest with yourself. There is something going on, and it does not have to be physical for it to be wrong. Even if he has never kissed her, if he is giving a part of himself to her that he should be giving to you - talking, leisure time together, etc., then what he is doing is wrong. If you don't want your marraige to end, then you need to confront him, and tell him that it has to stop. You cannot stay married like it is. You need to get to the source of why he is stepping out, then fix it, and truly forgive him for this, or your marraige is over. Good luck.|`|PbwCVPL1aa	If I can talk to someone out of staying with a cheating, no good for nothing lier, then I have done good. THEY R NOT JUST FRIENDS, WHY WOULD U ALLOW THE PHONE CALLS TO GO ON?

I would talk to him about it. just sit down with him and bring everything into the open.|`|goY0JHzlaa	Just friends my A$$. Don't be a fool.|`|XQe8rlH7aa	I'm sorry for what your going through, I know it's difficult.  It's hard to face the thought of your husband being with someone else whether emotional or physical.<br>  <br>  Things do not sound right with your husband and his "friend", from past experiences I've learned that if there is a rumor there is definitely some truth to it, it may not be all true but there is some truth.<br>  <br>  Now with that being said, I am not going to tell you how your crazy for putting up with him and all that jazz that I'm sure your going to get from family and friends as well as in some of your answers.  It's difficult to tell someone they should leave when I have nothing invested in your relationship.  If you husband can stop disrespecting you and cease all contact with his "friend" then I would work with that, however, if he chooses not to them you have some tough decisions to make.<br>  <br>  Can you continue to live this way?  Is it good for your child to have a mother who is not happy?<br>  <br>  Trust your instincts, you already know the answer.  Be strong and face what you need to face head on.  Let him know exactly how you feel and what he stands to lose if he doesn't stop this behavior.  And if they are "just friends" there should be no problem in letting her go for his wife.<br>  <br>  I hope I may have said something to help.  Best of luck to you.
U4AwP0p8aa	Interesting.  I spent 4 years in Schweinfurt.  Got out in May 2005.  Kinda found myself in the same situation.  I know it's gay to try and go out and find "guy friends" but I suppose you just have to put yourself in a situation where you can.  You could join a gym.  After awhile of going you just tend to start to know people.  You basically just need to find a starting point or two, so you can meet a few people and "network" from there.  Seems silly I suppose but you won't get anywhere sitting at home, so just keep on putting forth the effort.|`|goY0JHzlaa	Join the Masons, the Moose Lodge, or an Elk's club, etc.  I'm sure there are all kinds of clubs you could join. This way, you can meet other people outside of work and your relationship with your girlfriend.  Most of these clubs have members of men and women with one common goal in mind. To helpt he community, They have events that you could participate in and may find male companionship there.|`|hjc2y3TMaa	You two need to find other couples your age. since she already works with younger people this should not be hard. Invite other couples for dinner/drinks and you will get to make a couple buddies that are probably going to be interested in exactly what you are. Golfing, BBQing, Fishing...the things grown men do together without the bar scene. Good luck...enlist her help--woman are far more social. Married men with kids run up against the same problems...us women do as well but then we have all kinds of social opportunities like mothers groups that hold GNO and such.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	My husband took a few adult education classes last winter and hooked up with some other dudes...He was interested in small engine repair and it was a good place to meet others with similar interests.  We live in CT so I totally understand the winter piece of things...doesn't leave much for the social scene and bars do get old fast.  You could also try some local clubs for things you are interested in (hunting, fishing, video games, hiking - whatever floats your boat).<br>  <br>  Also, you could try some dinner dates with people your fiance knows.  It may take time to find the right couples to hang with, but if you find the right dude - you can always make plans for a guys night out.<br>  <br>  It's hard to network - but it is possible...my husband has a small circle of friends too and meeting others does get more difficult outside of the school setting...just keep networking and you'll eventually meet others of like minds.
SNVauR3laa	First of all, husbands are generally no help when they are sick. They are like big babies. Mommies can never stop. We never get to lay down, and be sick. I don't think you should hold this against him, because I think most men do this. <br>  As far as what is going on in your house, I get the feeling that your husband is very traditional. He thinks that women should stay home and cook and clean. He doesn't see you as a working woman because you don't leave the house. <br>  I think what you need to do is make him walk a day in your shoes. He does not realize what all you are doing, and how he is contributing to the messes. If you are so in love with him, then he can't be that bad of a guy. Sit down with him, and non-confrontationally let him know that you feel like you are overloaded, exhausted, and you need his help. Let him know that you don't think he realizes what all you do in a day. If he is not willing to do a day as you, then write it all down, step by step. Then, offer a solution. Tell him what he could do to really help you out. When he does the things that you ask, you need to reward him by being extra attentive to his needs. Let him know that thanks to his help, you now have the energy, and desire to do something fun with him.|`|4HoVVCenaa	Try couples counseling. This is a serious problem and if not fixed, you will be unhappy forever, and will leave sooner or later. Not only is this damaging you, but it will damage the children.|`|467be00aa9eff8cd86b019690cc79aa4aa	Welcome to marriage. Your marriage sounds like most peoples. Good Luck!|`|0F8hauikaa	Unfortunately, this is more common than you might think. Women are expected to supplement the family income but still expected to fill traditional roles as well, which can be overwhelming. Nagging you husband will only make things worse so just try to delegate responsibility when you have an opportunity. Ask your husband which chores he would be willing to relieve you of on a daily basis. Effective communication really is the key here. As the children get older, increase their responsibilities, too. I would also recommend that you have at least one day or evening a month to yourself, to take a class, go shopping or something, so that you'll have something to look forward to as an individual. Although marriage and parenthood involve a lot of self sacrifice, it's not selfish to take care of yourself so that you can better take care of your family.|`|5SR5Hyfeaa	You are being a good mother to your husband ! ? Daaa :) Stop picking up after him, and never tell him he needs a shower again. trust me he will get the idea he needs to be responsible for his own actions. Most of us shower every day. If you only wash the clothes in the hamper, then he is the one to blame. <br>   Don't be afraid to speak up, Tell him to get up with the kids every other time !!!

The way he is managing himself has more to do with his upbringing.  His mother probably did all the work when he was growing up, and that's just what he is accustomed to.  My situation is kind of the opposite.  My wife doesn't do much around the house OR with the kids. I take care of the house and the kids.  My kids are a little older and I am teaching them to help with things around the house.  Eventually they will have their own families,  and they will both contribute to their own families.|`|RQfLKOPQaa	One of the things that I learned when moving on my own is that things don't get cleaned up by themselves. Stop doing all that house work. Do the things that you are supposed to do, but the rest, make your husband do it. If he leaves his stuff around, make it disappear, when he needs it, he will come asking, and at that time you'll tell him, next time do it yourself!! If everybody cleans after themselves it's easier to maintain a clean house.|`|yd2SP7d6aa	It's possible you are expecting too much but than you might not as well.  I don't know the hours your husband is working, when you get up, if you take naps during the day etc.<br>  <br>  Take for instance myself, I get up at 4:45a.m. M - F for work and I don't get him until 4:30 p.m. (yes, the commute sucks that bad).  Now if my wife was a stay at home mother (you aren't a daycare provider because you aren't taking care of other peoples children) but she got to sleep in until 7 - 9 a.m.  and she got personal time to herself when the child "napped", well I'd be a bit miffed if she expected me to take on all this additional work when I got home (sickness is different).  Here she would have had 4 - 6 (say a two hour nap) hours of personal time (if she opted to sleep that would be HER choice).  So where exactly would MY free time be in there? She got to sleep in later, got 2 hours off while the child(ren) napped but I get shafted when I get home? (Yes he should step up on week-ends/off days and if you are sick but beyond that..nope).<br>  <br>  This is actually one of the many reasons I don't have kids.  When I  get home from work, I don't want to "work" again.  I want to be able to relax and enjoy my time. My time is already screwed Monday - Friday, having kids on top would just make it 100% worse (why do you think  when polled couples with children are less happy than couples WITH-OUT children).|`|RP6Xmvxsaa	being a mother it s your responsibility to take care the kids  it s a division of labor in short , the father will work for the family and the mother will take care of the family , the head of the family seek for money and the mother will budget the income of her husband|`|0jeWHxKmaa	no because your kids are not just YOUR kids...they are also his.He has responsibility 2.|`|4JrDGW7Taa	No you're not! But you must open up to him about how you feel.  You must explain why you need help from him. But this is not all! You must also allow him to tell you about his needs. There must be a back and forth to establish some agreement what a marriage is all about.<br>  <br>  Of course, you and he will disagree. But unless you talk about what each of you think what a marriage should be like, you will never agree on anything. Talk, talk and more talk is the answer to your difficulties. Check our my source for more info.|`|62gMbgb1aa	sure you are not expecting to o much from your husband, but my question is does your husband know what you feel? have you ever told him what you feel concerning his role at home and told him that you would like if he shares this responsibility with you! <br>  i think you two have to talk about that and in a nice way, he will say that he is spending the whole day at work and he comes home tired and need some relax, then you have to explain for him that you are not expecting him to do the same amount of work you r doing, but some help so you both can have the opportunity to spend more time together.|`|AA10928214	It's just life. That's why you are supposed to marry people that you are compatable with and you know are going to help with you're needs to. Do you want to have a job where you work all day, bring home lot's of money, and you're husband stays home with the kids? Then go to college, and switch places, or you should have done that in the first place. Maybe you should talk to him about it, but remember he's probably tired too. But, he does need to understand that you clean all day, and take care of screaming kids, and need two minutes of peace for yourself.|`|PBPVTJG7aa	You are just having a bad day or a bad month....but everyone goes through this...thing is...this has been your everyday for years right?  Just that lately you just feel like you need a change...the only thing i can say is talk to your husband and try to find something that makes you happy.|`|R3K3cdpFaa	no, you are not. you are a human being and deserve to be treated like one. it sounds like his life is very comfortable and that he likes it that way. i can relate, alhtough i dont have kids. my husband craps all over me and when i get pissed off and start yelling at him, he gives me craaap for the rest of the week for raising my voice. and then comes the silent treatment which is horrible. i have had enough and am leaving. now he's crying and saying he's an idiot and that he will change. been there dont that. im leaving this time.<br>  our situations are completely different, but what i can say to you is don't let him crap all over you, and stop calling it "help", after all, they are his kids and it is his home too. why, when you clean is it 'expected', and yet when he does it it's 'help'??? HELP????? it's his duty and responsibility as much as it is yours. dont use that word, 'help'. it makes his understand that it is not his primary obligation.<br>  change is hard and takes time and you have to remember that you cant expect him to change unless you do too. change the behaviours, that patterns and most of all your response to him. <br>  i wish you all the best and hope everythign works out best for you and your babies. stay strong and remember you always have options... and that there are always compassionate people in the world who are willing to listen. :)|`|TZpFcx47aa	Its great that you are in love and he is a good dad. You dont wanna mess that up by griping him out over housework issues. That he helps with the baby shows he is trying to help. I think lots of women slip into that "mommy role" with their husbands, and hey, the husbands let them. lol. Its normal i would say, but it really doesnt have to be that way. He might not even realize things are as messy as they are. It sounds goofy but maybe make one of those " charts " of stuff that has to be done ( showers, cleaning up etc.). Act like its for your daughter, but make a line on there for everyone, including yourself, maybe if it is hanging on the fridge that "mommy showered, mommy cleaned, hey, maybe we should alll do those things will click  for him. good luck.|`|beTrAYHRaa	Heaven,no you are not expecting enough I am in the same boat .I am a full time student a mother of 4kids 15,7,6,4 and I cook,clean,and do all the other motherly,wifely duties .All my husband does is complain and think I am going to wait on him hand and foot.He leaves his crap all over the house to .So what I do is go on strike I stop cooking ,cleaning etc.Then he gets the picture and gets his act together.|`|uP4qnB6raa	No your not expecting too much from him at all. I think if anything you are letting him take advantage of you and you need to put your foot down. Maybe you have tried this before, but I think you need a different and more stronger approach, something that will let him know that you aren't playing around anymore. I think since you both work, that things should be equal around the house. I know there is really no such thing as 50/50 but try to compromise something. You should really sit him down and tell him how you feel about all if this. And make him really understand. Other wise you'll be stuck in that same situation for a very long time, and it will only worsen. Good luck!|`|wpEoqEVXaa	This is not the norm. Most men do their share. <br>  <br>  I have a problem that you claim your husband "helps" you. Taking care of his child, his personal hygiene and the home is not helping you, it's doing what he should be doing as a parent. First, you need to learn to use different language with your husband. Honey come help me, should be removed and instead. Honey, come do this, needs to be put in. <br>  <br>  You need to sit this man down and have a long conversation. Women don't want to have sex with their kids, and if he is just another one of the kids, it's going to get old and fast. Tell him you feel like it's turning into incest. <br>  <br>  Since you are home most of the time, i do feel like you should take on a bit more of the responsibility within the home... but something like a 60/40 deal, not a 99/1 sort. <br>  <br>  Bathing should be done daily in most cases, smell should have nothing to do with it. It's just hygiene, and being around his kids should mean that he takes the time to be clean. Neither i nor my husband (or any friend or family member i have) has ever waited till we smelled to bathe. That's simply unacceptable and gross. You need to sit him down and tell him that he needs to pull his weight around the house, he needs to stand up and become the MAN he should have always been. This should have been seen and repaired before having children and in my opinion, before getting married even. But, it's a bit late for that now. So, make it change now. Otherwise, you won't be happily married in a few years to come. The stresses will only get harder as your children age and your husband will continue to revert into the child he's so happy in being. <br>  <br>  You need to sit him down and explain what you expect out of him. You want him to take on more responsibility of being a parent. You need to go get a life outside of the home, even if it's only for 2 hours a week. Go join a gym or a book club. Whatever it is that makes you happy. Anyway, this is the time where hubby will be at home with the children all by himself. He will be responsible for feeding them, bathing them and getting them to sleep. He'll need to feed himself and not leave you a mess on top of it all, so he'll have to clean up the dishes afterwards. Start treating him like a man, and he'll be forced to start being one. <br>  <br>  Explain to him that bathing daily or every other day would be a plus to all. You should not have to tell him when to bathe, that that's apart of being an adult. Tell him that as an adult, you expect him to get up and manage like a man and a parent would do in the house. When he makes a mess, clean it up! Explain you want a partner and not another child. If this doesn't cut it, you two need therapy. From here on out, treat him like a man. Dont' do for him anymore. Or... do it but in a way that is riddled with riddicule. If after the talk, if my husband didn't shape up i'd make things unpleasant. I'd say... in the worst mommy voice i could come up with.. now little johnny you need a bath because as usual, you smell bad. Don't make mommy mad or i'll ground you. If you don't get up and take out the trash, i'll take away cable. You can easily call the cable company and have it shut down for the month! Pretty soon acting like a child won't seem like so much fun and he just may get off his smelly behind and start acting like an adult. If nothing else... counseling!|`|AIuN5Lw9aa	Nope you aren't asking too much. Maybe you can start off by saying you feel a bit overwhelmed and kindly ask him if he can choose something to help you with. Start from there. If he refuses, explain that a family requires co-parenting and you feel the kids would benefit more from his taker a larger role in their care. <br>  <br>  It's all in the phrasing and tone of voice...men tend to shrink away from accusations, so I'd suggest avoiding that tone.
SNVauR3laa	Try showering with him for a while. He gets a show, you get a clean husband. You save water, and both get something out of it. After the shower, be more affectionate to him. Mention how nice it is to be close to him. After a while, only take half your showers together, then if you'd like eventually, he should shower on his own. OR you can continue to share this time together with no interruptions.|`|707gOCvbaa	For starters call him into the shower in the morning when you go in. Call him in every time. Not showering is a filthy habit. Has anyone at his work place complained? Someone has to notice and they could be saying horrible things behind his back. He needs counseling if he does not shape up. Boils are disgusting and I could not imagine sleeping in the same bed with this guy and he smells offensive. Be consistent when you complain and stay on him every chance you get. He must not take you seriously if he still fails to shower. good luck.|`|SiniSj1eaa	when he does shower make sure to point out how good he smells and how much of a turn on that is..<br>  <br>  Also if it were my guy I would be like "hun, do you want to take a shower first or should I tonight?" just bring it up in convo that you expect him to shower regulary..is he really going to say "im not going to shower" cuz then you can be all like..."uh, why?"...and point out why its not healthy.|`|AA10453556	What kind of work does he do? Most jobs I know of require good hygiene  <br>  so I wonder how he stays employed. He definitely needs to be made aware of the magnitude of the situation. Was he always like this? When you first started dating him did you notice this trait? Perhaps hearing it from other people would help him to realize the need for better hygiene. Have one of his friends mention it to him privately.|`|8txWayVnaa	*looking horrified*<br>  <br>  Well. . .at least you know he's not fooling around on you.  (Trying to see the glass as half full!)<br>  <br>  Does he have any friends?  Ridicule from his guy friends might persuade him.<br>  <br>  The only other thing I could suggest is you move out of your bedroom and stop sharing a close space with him altogether.  Tell him you won't come back until he showers everyday.|`|803c63e1bdfd226d14f4e5cafdc52f7eaa	If his hygiene is affecting your health, you need to tell him you will not share a bed with him unless he starts taking better care of himself, which means showering DAILY.|`|uP4qnB6raa	Put his stinky butt out on the couch. Tell him he's not allowed to share a bed with you until he has showered. Also... If you married him and he was already like this, then its going to be hard to break him of this habit now. I'm not saying it's too late, but you might just have to. I feel for you, that's pretty gross.|`|OTkvhdoTaa	I'd sit him down and give him a heart to heart talk.  Being a clean freak myself, I wouldn't even stay in the same house as he.  I would also stop sleeping in the same bed.  I would also put down a plastic sheet so that his filth doesn't seep through to the mattress.  Honestly, he is just down right disgusting!|`|H3WHxCgaaa	Tell him that if he can't take care of his own hygiene - it's back to the doctor for a psychological work-up.  Tell him that you fear he is having some major mental issues and may have to go on meds...<br>  <br>  In other words - scare the crap out of him!|`|kN4EaiUDaa	if that was me i would loose my attraction for him. I wouldnt want to have sex and would even have a problem hugging and kissing my husband if he was like that. tell your husband that its hurting your attraction to him, that will make him clean up his act..literally|`|6b0361fd65c600b0617b3884ebc87b1eaa	Take him to a fenced in body of water with a bridge going over and push him off the bridge. Come back in a few days and ask if he finished being dirty.|`|RP6Xmvxsaa	give him a good shower you can shower together and give what he wants|`|BuyzuOEjaa	Tell him to shower daily or twice a day or stay out of bedroom.|`|goY0JHzlaa	YUK...

But there's only one way to find that out.  Put yourself out there and let him know how you feel.  If he feels the same....great!  If not...then at least you can move on.  Good luck.  I hope this helps.|`|yyIVrngcaa	talk. see how he feels about you first...then after he says what he says go from there, you don't want to pour your heart out to him and have him not feel the same. good luck*|`|EyaqiWPwaa	the only way you are gonna know is if you make him a sandwich|`|cbXKOqmyaa	statistically speaking chances are he is not... <br>  <br>  the easiest predictions to make are love related because 95 percent of the time the pessimistic outlook ends up with the correct answer...|`|8KbQDRPpaa	tell him how he feels about you yea maybe your gonna sound silly but its worth it. and then tell him how you feel and see how everything works out !!<br>  <br>  ""GOOD LUCK""|`|A3AKLHz6aa	go for it whats the worst that could happen sounds like a match made in heven|`|kK4vYqXPaa	You really shouldn't demand ...HONEY ...

Abundant and unusual amounts of these hormones and neurotransmitters can cause the brain and adrenal glands to perform excessive dopamine-norepinephrine-epinephrine conversion and turn the brain and body functions to be extremely sympathetic. <br>  <br>  In other words, there is a big change of body chemistry when one excessively practices masturbation.<br>  <br>  Note: Masturbation is a healthy sexual behavior. But, like other behaviors, when over-practiced or addicted it can lead to both psychological and physiological imbalances. <br>  <br>  The side effects of such changes to the body include:<br>   Fatigue. Feeling tired all the time<br>   Lower back pain<br>   Stress / Anxiety<br>   Thinning hair / Hair Loss<br>   Soft / Weak Erection<br>   Premature Ejaculation<br>   Eye floaters or fuzzy vision<br>   Groin / Testicular Pain<br>   Pain or cramp in the pelvic cavity or/and tail bone<br>  <br>  Slow down, buddy.

Are you sure that he's over her?<br>  <br>  <br>  *If I've helped you, please answer one of mine**|`|JLayHNZCaa	Okay, how should he feel about her looks?  She is an ungly XXXXXXXX and yet he was with her?  So he likes to be with ugly XXXXXXXXs?  Does that make you an ugly XXXXXXXX?   Seems like you are immature and insecure?  Get over it.  He is with you now, and what he feels about an ex is irrelevent unless he is asking to bring her into the relationship bed with you?|`|zxwUpCasaa	ummmm a LOT of girls are pretty and cute. and that's the reason he dated her, most likely, in the first place. of course he thinks she is. just because you break up with someone doesnt mean you automatically think they are ugly.|`|MAABo1zKaa	hahahah... okay first of all that last line made me nearly pee myself laughing! i dunno men are strange.. he dated her before so obviously he thinks shes pretty.. prying really will get you nowhere hunnie.  i mean idk shes probably funny looking and if she is just tell yourself that because your clearly wayy cuter!|`|sr0vZPQqaa	Why wouldn't he still think she is pretty, if he was attracted to her in the first place he would wouldn't he. He's not all of a sudden going to think she is ugly just cos she's an ex.|`|kc1IBYMRaa	Maybe she is.  If he's straight he knows pretty girls when he sees them.  Don't expect his vision to become selective just because he has a girlfriend.|`|tp87bkXkaa	no you shouldn't worry!<br>  just because their relationship fell apart that doesn't mean that she turned ugly.. lol<br>  she can still be pretty without him liking her.
IQ50BJ0Waa	Not my husband (though I'm sure he has and I just can't remember) but my best friend's husband put a pork chop in the toaster - not toaster oven - but actual toaster to heat it up. Couldn't figure why the toaster wouldn't work after that :)|`|NuUdCz0Laa	When my wife and I were dating, I was help preparing a turkey dinner, after I had deboned the turkey, I placed it in the oven, to allow for more counter space.  Three weeks later, my fiance called and advised that her kitchen smelled awful and it was disgusting to even walk into the apartment.  That is when I realized that I forgot about the turkey still sitting in the oven.  I went over to open the oven door and place the rotten remains in the trash, that was the least I could do.  We still laugh about that every time we have turkey, twelve years later.|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	rolling on the floor laughing at loud!<br>  <br>  ok now that i have that out of my system.<br>  <br>  When i first met my husband we were takign a shower together, he hit his head on the shower nozzle. I htought it was hilirious. He is 6'1 so i figured he should be used to it by that point!|`|467be00aa9eff8cd86b019690cc79aa4aa	Me and my husband do things like that all the time. We have to just look at each other and laugh. I guess it keeps life interesting.|`|RtkB46peaa	You guys sound like a sitcom in the making!   I think it's great that you two can banter back and forth!|`|uMEvnFkJaa	When I was ten years old, I was around at my friend's house and his mum found a can of Coke that had been put in the freezer earlier, and had since exploded and left a huge mess. She thought that we had done it, and got really mad at us. Then my friend's dad came home and turns out he was the one who had left the can in there.|`|PBOWJYQ6aa	Yes. We had dinner guests one day and I had Salmon cooking in a glass casserole dish in the oven. I told him to leave it alone while I went to the bathroom. He wanted to impress our guests with how helpful he is in the kitchen. The moron thought it would be a good idea to poor cold water on it so it didn't dry out! Of course it shattered, and we had nothing thawed as a backup!|`|i15KoiJhaa	LOL<br>  <br>  My Husband has a "Love Affair" with our deep fat fryer....<br>  <br>  Sadly enough, if I wasn't at home I am fairly certain he would attempt to deep fat fry everything... and I do mean everything!<br>  <br>  A few weeks ago I picked up some nice NY Strips for dinner and my Husband was miffed that I would not allow him to throw them in the deep fat fryer... *Puke*|`|56b67ae7a7d42f99ff2ecd43af8e2067aa	Men often don't care about instructions. They just do whatever comes to mind.<br>  Years ago, my husband boiled the feeding bottles of our first child to help me with the chores. l was surprised to see them deformed. Turns out he didn't put water in the boiler.|`|1TXJDiedaa	Hhahahhaaaa Thats funny~ Well my husband cooked ramen noodles once without the water because he wanted them crunchy?? Anyway they caught fire and they were black. I was like UM who taught you to cook again??|`|H3WHxCgaaa	How about those late night hot dogs that end up sitting in the microwave after the "chef" has fallen asleep...Ugh!  It happens!|`|4Zdp7fu9aa	ahhahaa my husband never did something like that.. but he does funny stuff all the time..|`|aMkWajC7aa	that's hilarious....|`|oDXKYOAvaa	what it says ...  you like burnt corn ... maybe a little wire problem .... Babe!... Fix that microwave cause I hate burnt popcorn|`|G6owPyncaa	no|`|RF2YV9ataa	Yes lol my husband is so awful when it comes to stuff like that lol like this for examle: <br>  Recently my husband has really been trying to get back into shape so he has bought these internal cleansing tablets the ones that really flush your system out then he turned around and bought something callled dieters tea now ive told him not to mix stuff like that together becuase he doesnt know how they will react when they mix but his excuse is babe its all natural its not gonna hurt me lol ok so he takes the cleansing tablets and then drinks the dieters tea at the same time and for the past 2 days he has been really suffering on the toilet becuase he didnt listen lol<br>  and then we are about to have a kid in like a couple days so he puts the stroller together without follwing the directions of course and do you know this dunder head still has parts left over AFTER hes so called finished lol like seriously lol do you really expect me to put our kid in it when you have misc parts still sitting on the floor and then he says well we didnt really need those parts lol OMG i love my husband
APy56tkZaa	I think a certain amount of skepticism is a good thing, just make sure you can balance it out & not let it consume all of your thoughts.<br>  Jealousy is natural, but acting out towards an innocent person because of it is wrong.|`|u7f0QB37aa	All women cheat maybe not physically but they all cheat in the end trust no one but your mommy and chances are she cheated on your dad.|`|VjMyHAWraa	If someone has cheated on you, it is really hard to trust someone else! Just remember that everyone isn't the same. You have to give every new person in your life a chance. It's not their fault you had a bad experience with someone else! If you are still with the person that earned your distrust, that is different! They will have to really work hard to see if you can trust them again! If you can't, then move on . Trust is a very important part of any relationship! Good luck!<br>  <br>  additional info: Wow! some of you guys really have serious problems with trust! I suggest counseling for all of you!!! All women are not the same!!|`|AA11205208	trust is something that should be freely given until violated. Then, a return to trust must be earned.<br>  <br>  It is really hard to give unconditional trust to someone that has blasted your trust right out of the water, but if you are married and committed you have to at least try.<br>  <br>  As for being normal? Who really wants to do that?|`|gLXzVbm8aa	everyone has some sort of trust issue some more than others but its normal. never fully trust anyone. they have to earn your trust and respect.|`|mfqfO0wUaa	Like a couple of others who answered said ONLY trust you mom the women these days are all Who*es|`|NI7bvePkaa	The only person you can trust is your mother.
oQkwZhXpaa	Aww I know you must really feel awful, with not knowing, and not thinking she cares. Just remember that whatever happens, you are going to be OK, and you aren't going to feel like this forever. The guy I like sometimes does similar things and it kills me not knowing how he really thinks of me.<br>  <br>  I think that her breaking up with her man hurt her, and she probably did like you when she told you, but maybe when she broke up with her guy, she kinda got cold feet and felt bad and unsure, she sounds insecure, and probably put herself about a bit to try and convince herself that people like her, or to try and guage how much you like her.<br>  Be nice to her, and keep complimenting her because girls like that. Tell her that its up to her what she decides to do, but you'll always be there for her if she needs you.<br>  <br>  I think that perhaps its a good idea to try and get some help for your depression as it sounds pretty bad, and I know that you don't deserve to feel that way. You only live once so, hard as it is, try and have fun. Show this girl you can give her a good time, because she may feel that someone depressive will bring her down too, and she doesnt want to have to deal with that. <br>  <br>  Much as you like this girl, I think you should arrange just a time to talk. Tell her you want to speak to her about something important, and, I know it will be hard, but tell her exactly how you feel, almost word for word as you have put it on here, but tell her you understand that she wants her freedom etc, but you really care about her and to just give things a chance. She will respect what you have told her, and also, not being funny, but girls love to be told they are liked so nothing bad will come of it. If she says no, then at least you both know how things stand, and you can both move on, as you especially sound like you deserve someone nice, and be in a relationship where you can trust the person. What would be the point of a love less relationship where you are always worried about what she is doing. You shouldnt have to be second best to anybody. I think its worth having a chat with her though :)<br>  <br>  Good luck :) You can do this =]<br>  <br>  p.s even if she says no, you will get through it. It will take time and you will feel like crap for a while, but you will get through it..theres plenty more out there you know, and you will find someone who will appreciate you the way you are, which is what you deserve.|`|imofYcOHaa	I know it must be hard for you, but some people are just not meant to be,If it happens it happens, theres plenty more fish in the sea. I feel for you :(x but don't turn to Alcohol,you don't sound pathetic you sound like somebody whos just in love, it happens to everybody, and theres somebody out there for you, so don't just get your hopes up on one person. Hope things work out for you :(x|`|9sCVyZ32aa	tbh what i think you should do is try and get over her yeah it maybe hard but try and find sum one else that you like meet new people and remember things happen for a reason so this must mean either she isn't good enough for you or there is someone that is better on the way and when you find that person you will be as happy as larry i dunno if this will help but its worth a try really aint it.
wia9SXCPaa	I think this is all a bit confusing.  If he hates his brother why would he be trying to set you up with him.  I guess I would still be a bit suspicious about him not wanting you to go to the bank to get money.  Something doesn't seem right there.  <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|CM1dfztQaa	Sounds like there are trust issues or old pains flaring up. If he expect his step-bro to pay, it's like he's setting you up on a date too. Your husband may be setting you up to see what would happen behind his back. Especially if all you said about his relationship with his step-brother is true. This is very touchy ground. Tread softly.<br>  <br>  Another idea is, that he may not like this match making scheme of yours. If he is uncomfortable with the idea he may just be trying to get out of it, and not being nice about it.|`|AA10034000	Well, I am not actually there to see how your husband is with body language and his tone of voice but sounds to me like he is letting go of the past and being mature about it. He is okay with you and his brother hanging out and I say go and have fun but don't be flirty or anything. Mind your manners of course. lol..... Have fun.....|`|sr0vZPQqaa	Sounds like he wants you out of the way for some reason and he's not wanting you to go to the bank. Have you checked your bank account? Maybe he has cleared it out and is going to move out whilst you are out.|`|i15KoiJhaa	Seems a little odd to me...<br>  <br>  Why not have the blind date go on without you?<br>  <br>  Your Friend and Brother-In-Law are both adults right? Let them plan their own date and attend it without anyone else's involvement.|`|AA11205208	I think I would stay home with my husband.|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	yea sounds fishy to me. maybe he is messing around and has less of a guilty concious by lettign you go on a date to|`|MXGFGBtZaa	Are you sure he actually hates him? Hate is a strong word. Besides, he is probably thinking "If he's going to take my wife out, I want it to be his money that pays for it. Not mine"<br>  It sounds like a strange thing to do, but if you are uncomfortable with the situation say you will go alone and tell your friend that your husband was working and couldn't make it. It's not essential that someone male goes with you.|`|uP4qnB6raa	maybe he is trying to date the friend that you are trying to hook the brother up with or something. Or maybe he's doing something shady. OR maybe he just let it go.|`|y4w6ybr3aa	That is a bit strange, maybe he is just trying to show that he trusts you. Besides it's a double date so you wont be alone with him|`|d76cea359766d11e12c1e23ab4e11658aa	Amanda don't go -|`|AA11032586	That is weird.

Dumb it down to their level.  Ask them if they've ever seen "Mean Girls".  If they say yes, say "yeah... well, you're one of the mean girls".  And walk away.|`|SnpP6dGFaa	They're trying to get your attention and bug you.  Just ignore them - you have the friends you like that you enjoy being around.

goY0JHzlaa	Honey,<br>       You need to join a support group in your area for military wives. The base should provide something like this. I think it may help. I've never been in your situation. But, I can empathize. Stay strong and let your man know you love him more than anything. Be as supportive as you can be. It will be hard and I respect any person married to someone in the military. It's a tough road. But, know this one thing.<br>  I appreciate the sacrifices that your spouse makes everyday so that I have the luxury of living in this country. I also appreciate the sacrifices you must endure being a military wife. God Bless.|`|AXbdNdPzaa	Why did you marry a man in the army?  You had to have known he was going to be deployed, it doesn't happen overnight.  I feel so sorry for your husband.|`|u1uECuFNaa	You should think positive!<br>  My husband is gone....he has been gone since September. I am middling along. (we do have children though)<br>  I have been depressed for the most part...but I am thinking positively.<br>  You should get a hobby. Join a support group, get a part time job, find things that make you happy and keep your spirits up.<br>  I would also think you would want to have a baby to keep you company and have a part of him with you always. <br>  As a spouse, I try not to think of him dying or getting injured!<br>  BUT having a baby alone is hard, too. <br>  And he will miss out on a lot. <br>  My husband is often able to email or call me and it is great. Does not last long, but it is better than nothing. He sends occasional snail mail, too.<br>  I steer clear of the news.....all the time...too depressing.<br>  I wish you lots of luck and strength. It takes an extraordinary spouse to handle deployments. All wives of military rock! (okay, most then.)<br>  <br>  Friends and family will help you out a lot...make sure you have a good support group around you. People to help keep your spirits up. I have drawn closer to my mother and my sister (they are several hours away) since he has been gone. I am trying to exercise more and stay healthy.|`|NuUdCz0Laa	First let me applaud you and your husband and his choice to serve our country.  Yes, it is going to be very hard and lonely on your part, you need to enlist the help of family and friends.  As far as having the baby, I would choose to wait, or at least toward the end of his tour.  Your emotions will intensify while pregnant and you want your husband there when you deliver, so be patient, stay with family and write him daily, it will all be worthwhile in the end.  Good luck to you and your husband.|`|fb719885a6ad0c93baa1955ec6f7904caa	If you have some one on the side when he is gone DO NOT fall in love|`|F4d89iRMaa	It's okay, many wives go through this. You should just be lucky its not a 15 month deployment, girl! When he is gone for the whole year, what you & him should do is keep in touch and stay in touch at all times! My husband wrote me, sent me cards, souvi's, and called me daily for 15 months straight. HECK, he even texts me! The only time he doesn't call is if he is on a mission or the phone is cut off. If  you want to keep it strong you two will need to communicate as much as you can. Lots of couples divorce over this bc they fell apart during the deployment. Always think positive and send each other little messages saying you appreciate and love one another. Just keep strong and stay away from temptations. Also, when he returns after deployment, not all but a lot of couples will be trying to get to know each other again bc that is a year of separation from each other--making up for times you two lost. Don't think about him dying even know it is in the back of your mind. Live moment by moment. Good luck!|`|SiniSj1eaa	I had a boyfriend who was a Marine and went on deployment for six months...honestly the first month was really really really hard. After time went on you just get used to it..<br>  <br>  Granted he was not my husband so I really feel for you. It takes a strong woman to have this type of lifestyle. Please whatever you do..stay faithful..I know it seems easy to say you will, but a year is a long time and your going to have those lonely nights...<br>  <br>  ps. my little brother is going to boot camp this summer for the Marines, and I share the same fears and he hasnt even gone overseas yet. I will make sure to pray for your husband. It will all be ok though I promise. You can get a lot of support from other wives on base and your family. Just keep yourself busy and make your baby the center of your attention.|`|MfIz3TPVaa	i do feel for anyone thats going thru this - my x-husband was in the navy while we were married and he was in the persian gulf conflict , it does get lonely and all sorts of bad ideas run thru your head , well he made it out ok -you need to pray about this matter and think that soon God will cease all wars- , can you write letters in the time frame that you dont hear from him that was one thing that my husband and i did. Stay strong & pray. dont cheat on him it will just cause more problems|`|oDXKYOAvaa	I new a newbie  Marine ...on that one man dream!!|`|xT4pJ56maa	Im a military wife and its hard. My husband and I were just talking when he was last deployed so its a little different. But my dad is in the army so I do know where your coming from. I personally wouldnt try to have kids until he comes back. Im not trying to tell you what to do but it will be hard with the stress of him gone and what not. My husband just got a different job and hes unit it like a last resort for deployment. But my husband trains soliders before they go overseas. If youd like to chat more just shoot me a email. And please please please try not to think about him dying it will only kill you inside. And me what I did was only watched the local news and weather and as soon as the war stuff came on I changed it. If you watch your mind will run wild.
qpjorXRnaa	Um, maybe he gets happiness out of other peoples pain.

He betrayed your trust. Expensive gifts and a trip will do neither of those things but mask the problem. The more he lavish you the likely he will cheat again.

You know what I would do? I would make him get my name tattooed somewhere on his body - wherever I chose it to be. That would prove something to me and I could possibly forgive him again.|`|geJM58L2aa	If a guy cheated on me he wouldn't be able to buy my trust back with gifts and other material things.

I might add that here in NYC it is very common for ladies to end up with semen on their clothes esp when they ride the bus or train.

If you suspect she's cheating just confront her.  (Most times if you think they are cheating, then they are.) Women are good liars.  Trust your instincts, and do what feels right.  If you think to move on, then do that.  If not, you need to work on these problems now.  It's up to you.  What you will or won't accept.  Personally I wouldn't accept thinking it.  You need to talk to her.  Don't yell or cry though.

1235333b4f34f1147fc81bf4aef8885baa	A degree in electrical engineering is highly marketable and relatively lucrative.  Though the tech field is rocky and layoffs anc factory closings are common, electrical engineers rarely have a hard time finding work because their skills are really always in need.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, if school isn't really your son's thing and he doubts his ability to finish the degree, a CDL is a good ticket to a solid blue collar job that will probably never become scarce.<br>  <br>  I would say that it all really depends on your sons ambitions and personal qualities.  Trucking isn't as hard as it used to be, but it is a job that will always require a lot of time alone on the road.  If he's young that may not seem like a big deal now, but I'm sure he plans on marriage and kids someday and that future is something to consider.  On the other hand, not everyone was born to be an academic, and there's nothing wrong with providing for your family with a blue collar job.|`|AA10088948	Getting his electrician's license is a ticket to permanent well paid  employment. <br>  <br>  CDL is good as well but it will pay less. <br>  <br>  He will make up that extra expense in very little time. <br>  <br>  Electrical experience in the military is excellent experience.  Try the Navy electrician program.  <br>  <br>  Good Luck with that.
vlCWp7sSaa	I find that as a compliment, but it depends how you take it.<br>  <br>  I think he's trying to say is that you're really sweet and caring. That you are willing to understand and listen to people. I think he phrased "take advantage of you" wrong. I think he was really trying to some like, someone who wants to be with you.

tWWUVAgcaa	Same thing happend to me a bunch of times..your friends leave you for no reason at all.

imh6CrYHaa	What do I think... I luv cheese but now im serious... What seems to be troubling you... Wait...no i said WAIT... yes ive gt it.. You seem to troubled by sue but dont let that worry you, you should be worried bwt urself, i mean you seem to be leaving her out alot. Mayb makin her feel selfconsious of wat she like, now although at this moment in time that might seem the right thing to do... in time you might learn to regret this. As i did once in my long past... My friend {i can spell unlike you} and i were in a similar situation nad the result was not a gd one. But the charateristics that my freind was showin was similar ones to wat i had done in my past, mayb you shud think abwt wat ur doin first be4 u speaak of other people... <br>  <br>  You also say bwt her home me life ....but wat do you reli know ....have you spoken to her and have you gathered all this information from your own reliable sources? <br>  <br>  <br>  You dont know how much this could be effecting her, she could be on the verge of suiside? Do you only give? She doesnt give you nethin? r u sure bwt this? <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I wud quite like you to update me on wat u think on wat ive given you to think abwt. Telll wat u did next and wat uve thought over also explain wat excacally she has done and i will repli<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  SO KEEP ME UPDATED!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  from your reliable source MR N... you know u luv me...|`|TbapRrYGaa	errrm wah :s|`|KzDwZfLBaa	???????????|`|ZZVNlXdxaa	Do you go to lincoln middle school?|`|rFuvNbRWaa	in life there is a rule. you either lead, you follow, or you f off. Sue seems to be that person who follows.. that is why she copies what other people do or say or write or look, shes a big time follower obviously, whether its becuz she comes from a background where her confidence has been lowered and possibly destroyed, or just because shes got no imagination for creativity do come up with her own things rather than follow. either way, the copying part you just need to be a friend, be nice to her and explain her she can do something else and doesnt need to copy other people, and maybe help her come up with something new, be her friend, being friends means to help each other sometimes and this might help her not be what she is, that makes people dislike her; you will do yourself a favor by changing her, as well as other people who get annoyed from her because of that, and to top it all, you will do HER a favor as more people will probably like her and will want to be friends with her. As for her complaining bout you being closer with someone else - that definitely comes from having no confidence and feeling betrayed, and once again you will need to epxlain her that people make many friends, people only share things they are comfortable sharing and with the people their sharing them with, and if you feel more comfortable sharing things with another friend, then she shouldnt "stress out" but maybe try to see the reason that you would rather share your stuff with another friend rather than with her. and explain to her that if she didnt copy your things, that firstly annoys you, then you would probably share things with her, but under certain circumstances of things she does - she "digs her own grave" and, like everything else in the world - to every action there is a reaction. explain to her that changing other peoples reactions wont work - but changing her actions to get different reactions might very well work in life..

You seem to be giving me an awful lot of attention.  Why don't you just come out and admit that you fancy me?  It's a proven fact that boys who do this to girls all the time are trying to ask them out so I am giving you the opportunity now."<br>  <br>  Say it as loudly as possible with all his friends around.  Even if he says "I don't fancy you" then I guarantee he will be so embarrassed that he will leave you alone.|`|p9xRhQNFaa	I've had the this situation at my old high school, and new one. <br>  The worse of the two guys would do the same thing, smack my **** as i walked past and embarrass me in front of the whole class - he would go through my blazer and when i was 'on' throw all my stuff around the class room. Eventually i had to get teachers involved and that was why i move. <br>  They second guy was similar, and instead of standing up for myself (cause that just spurs them on when you get annoyed) i just ignored him. When ever he did anything i would just act as if it didn't happen and cary on with what i was doing. Eventually he got bored and now he has stopped it all together.<br>  If you don't want to get teachers involved that is the best way to go around things. If he insults you just say "thanks" sarcastically and carry on with what you were doing, or just ignore him completely. Bear with it, cause when you ignore him at first he might do double doses to catch your attention, but if you don't give him the satisfaction of wining you up (like when he calls you Kate) he will soon get bored and move on. Tell your friends to do the same.<br>  Hope this helps, and good luck :)|`|GySn7kI5aa	Lol he probably fancys u but is just going about showing it in a wiered way.<br>  tell him to leave you alone and that u dont fancy him back. that should scare him off|`|Ddn9I9v3aa	Kick his balls in.

1235333b4f34f1147fc81bf4aef8885baa	Your stepdaughter needs to be punished for invading someone's privacy.  You need to get your husband on board with this.  In fact, if possible, he should be the one that delivers the news that she'll be grounded or whatever.<br>  <br>  You should also do damage control with your boss.  Don't try to hide what she did.  Tell them upfront that you caught your daughter in their personal belongings while you were over feeding the dogs or whatever.  Explain that she's being punished for doing this and then make her apologize.<br>  <br>  Your boss will probably be fine with this because you're dealing with it directly.  If you try to hide it and they find out later, they'll feel betrayed.  Promise that, if you're asked to housesit in the future, your stepdaughter will not be tagging along.<br>  <br>  By the way, how old is your stepdaughter?  This is fairly typical behavior for someone below the age of 14.  If she is over 14, this is a sign of trouble.  By that age she should understand personal property and privacy and be able to respect others.|`|nTDlqdHIaa	She's doing it on purpose.<br>  <br>  especially if you are the first person her father has been married to since her mother.<br>  <br>  I have a step mom...I'm now 22 I was 15 when my dad married her and to this day I can not believe some of the things I did to that woman...but we have a mutual hate for each other...I haven't spoke to my father in 3 years thanks to her. <br>  <br>  I don't know how well you get along but make sure she can not sense you don't like her (if you don't) that just makes it worse...lol...teenagers are like dogs...they sense your fear and they like it...haha. <br>  <br>  But...I also have a step dad and I get along with wonderfully and always have...but I never liked my step mom. <br>  <br>  Good luck >.<|`|i15KoiJhaa	Crap!<br>  <br>  You need to sit your Husband down and tell him how you feel about this.<br>  <br>  Then he needs to intervene in this with his Daughter... there is only so much we as Step Parents can do... and in this case... your Husband needs to be the one who steps up his game and finds a punishment that fits the crime.<br>  <br>  For Heaven sake you could've been fired over this!<br>  <br>  Respect for other peoples property has to start at home... and sounds like your Step Daughter needs some lessons in this.|`|c2a2744402d2ea85b1126f83ce3e8869aa	I wish I could offer a great solution. I can relate - being a step-parent is one of the hardest things I have had to do in life also. You don't say how old your step-daughter is, I am curious. If she can post on my space I would assume that she is old enough to know better. How did your husband respond? That is probably the single most important factor, if he blows it off and makes excuses for her, then I highly recommend a good counselor for you. I have been married to the most wonderful man for more than eight years, and virtually the only problem we have had has revolved around my issues with his children and his with my son. Our children are adults now, with only his 21 year old son still at home and it is still an issue. I wouldn't trade my husband for the world, but I sure wish I knew how to handle the step-parent issue better. For the record, I have been in counseling for seven years and it has helped me a lot. <br>  <br>  I would definitely not allow the step-daughter to go again. Since you spelled out to her  not to go on the computer and not to go into the drawers, obviously she will not respect you. (sounds just like my step-daughter!!!) Will she respect her father? My step-daughter does not respect either of us or our wishes, so it has been very difficult. Currently,  she is 22 and considering moving back in with us temporarily and I am about at my wits end. Good luck to you.

Just think about all the times hes hurt you. So i wouldn't wait for graduation or ever because showing him you've moved on with his lame bullshit is saying more than waiting for him to walk the stage from graduation so you guys can get it on when next month he'll be with someone else.<br>  <br>  Do it for yourself. you deserve better.|`|DnCpBjPDaa	Honey you need to let him go. He's dating your cousin??? How did he meet her? We're talking about family being involved here. If your cousin dated him first would she want you interrupting he relationship with him? Think about it that way.|`|6mbHpl1Gaa	I think you should go with what you feel in your heart.  If he feels the same then he will be with you.  If this seems to be a pattern, then I think you should move on.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|ekejFic8aa	Don't waste your time with thinking how it ends, just think about how it can be fun and thrilling ;)|`|sz52aXMjaa	go for it darling,.|`|Dc8iMSjVaa	please go for it<br>  u cant let him go :)|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	You should do nothing, if he really likes you more than he likes your cousin then he will not mess her around any more and tell her himself.<br>  What you do after he dumps your cousin is up to you, she may speak to you about it but in anycase just wait it out.|`|czHD5tPwaa	Go for it, you troll!
n8lXItGraa	Oh yeah...I'd want to know.  Apparently he has never gotten over the ex.  I'd want the whole scoop...from him.  Don't let him dance around the subject.  You might hear things you don't want to know...but it sounds like you need to know.  Once you have all the information, you'll then have to decide whether the relationship is really worth salvaging.  Just because you have children, doesn't mean you have to spend the rest of your life with a man who cheats and lies. Children are more intuitive than you think.  They know when things aren't...right.  They can feel tension.  Only you can determine what your next move is  If you know for sure this was not a one time thing...chances are it is still going on.  Sorry to hear that.  Hope this helps|`|CM1dfztQaa	There is no easy way to find out about something like that. I knew something was up with my ex, when we were married. He wouldn't tell me what was going on and actually started trying to make me believe that I was going crazy. He could play head games like no other.<br>  <br>  Finally, through my own investigating, I met his girlfriend. She was a really nice girl that he had totally snowed. I showed her the light (my bruises) and then I filed for divorce.<br>  <br>  So, I guess the answer to your other question is yes, I would want to know. If you allow this sort of behavior, you aren't allowed to be angry that it's happening. Learned that the hard way.  Good luck.|`|J74Y5LKxaa	In the last 2 years there have been about 5 different women that my father in law has either had casual sex with or on-going affairs with.  And those are just the one's I know about.  His wife is one of those "burry your head in the sand" kind of people, so I guess she figured that if she asked him no questions he would tell her no lies.  Eventually though I think she confronted him with it.  And after 35 years of marriage and SIX daughters, three of whom still live at home, I guess he figured that $40,000  in new jewelry was a lot cheaper than a divorce.  Besides........now that he's making half a million a year from his construction business, she's not about to leave him now anyway.|`|wia9SXCPaa	Yes I would want to know.  I would like the information to come from my husband so we could openly communicate about the issues and see if there is any way to work things out.<br>  <br>  I think it sounds like your husband should have stayed with his ex wife so you wouldn't be in this situation.  Good luck to you and your baby!|`|i15KoiJhaa	Yes, I would want to know.<br>  Yes, I would want to be told.|`|PbwCVPL1aa	Just tell him to tell u the truth or your leaving and leave anyway. If u think for any reason that he is cheating then get out of it.|`|XQe8rlH7aa	That's a tough one.  As a wife I would want to know and I would want you to be straightforward and honest.   Now I DO NOT condone cheating in any form.<br>  <br>  Now with that being said, if this was something that was a one time affair and she has no knowledge of it whatsoever, meaning she has not questioned whereabouts or actions and you have seen the error of your ways and will NEVER do it again, I wouldn't tell her, why cause unnecessary heartache.  <br>  <br>  I know that may sound a little bad, but I wouldn't I would let the dead stay dead. But if she has an incling or and uncertainty I would come clean.<br>  <br>  As for the future, cease all communication from your ex if you haven't.  Nothing tears the heart of a woman more to be devasted by the man she loves.  Keep that in mind.  Good Luck.|`|ldB0Fyo2aa	Oh, honey. I now have two children, getting a divorce, and wish I had listened to the little voice inside my head when I thought maybe I shouldn't have married my husband. If nothing else, please, please figure out if you have a healthy marriage or not before having another child. Now I'm faced with having to go back to work and possibly putting my baby in daycare, something I didn't want to do. Okay, now back to your question. <br>  <br>  Wait, are you talking about someone else? Yes, she needs to be told. He's committing fraud against his wife, spending her/their money on someone else. Who knows what he could be doing with their money. If you're going to tell someone her husband is cheating, you have to be damned sure you're right. Really, really positive. Then go to her, sit her down, and tell her. Bring the phone numbers/url's of some helpful resources. Offer to watch her child while she adjusts. <br>  <br>  Be aware that she may hate you at first, but that won't last. If you're sure, please tell her. It's the best thing for her.|`|uP4qnB6raa	Yes I would want to know. And I'd like for him to come strait out and tell me. I am a strong woman and I can handle the truth. And even if I can't handle it, I can find someone who will handle it well for me. LOL!!!

lYZ71zYAaa	You need an a line slip, for your A line  dress semi full not ball gown full.|`|0PCaKDxHaa	you need one of those full slips that have lots of POOF around them... not just a regular slip like you'd wear under a dress to work... you need something that will make your dress fill itself out...<br>  <br>  they sometimes call them crinoline slips... you can find them on ebay for cheap... but you dont have that kind of time... but at least if you go there, you will know what you need... <br>  <br>  you can also google wedding slips.. you'll see what it looks like... they sell them at almost all bridal stores... usually they run between $25 and $50... unless you are getting a huge one... then it might be more... good luck!|`|di6p10Ifaa	Really your best bet is to take your gown and to go to somewhere like Davids Bridal that has many styles and choices in slips. Considering that we cannot see your gown, a-line can range, what you can do is try your gown on with the slip before buying it. That is what I would do. Some places can be weird about returning so I would definitely want to try the slip on with the gown before buying it. Hopefully this helped. You have not failed as a girl. It is hard being a girl, so many choices, decisions, colors, patterns, we all get caught up in the whirlwind of being a female at times! :) Have a great time shopping!!!<br>  <br>  Edit: my gown is an A-line as well and it looks terrible without the petticoat. You really need the petticoat to see the potiential of the gown if your gown is like a taffeta or satin. Otherwise it can hang and look drapey. Mine looks really drapey without my petticoat, i have a taffeta gown. You would be shocked at the difference with the full slip on. Davids bridal is great give them a try.|`|hkwBR1moaa	Your best bet is to ask the bridal shop what kind of slip you need because they know the dress.  <br>  If you can't ask them, then go to a David's Bridal if you have one near, take your dress with you and ask them to help you find a slip.  They sell slips for about $50.00 and have them in stock,  That way you can try your  dress on with the slip and know that you have the right one.<br>  <br>  Edit... Mine is an a-line and I still need a special slip to fluff the dress out.|`|0WASp0bHaa	You need a bridal slip, not one you pick up at Sears. They point being those will still be see through. Nothing worst than walking around and everyone seeing the silhouette of your legs. A bridal skirt is heavy and while you are walking down the aisle your dress is going to go in between your legs. You need a bridal slip that will help it to stand out a bit. The fabric of the bridal dress will still drape.
A94u2In8aa	She broke up with you on Thanksgiving?!Wow thats harsh...as for your dilemma...you could call her up and talk to her...get an idea of whether she really wants to get back to gether with you...but dude..if she broke up with you in that bad a way then do u really wanna get back with her?You might just end up getting hurt again.If you like her A LOT and by that i mean if you find that you cant stop thinking about her etc. then you could consider getting back with her.Think carefully before making a move.You dont wanna end up getting hurt again..|`|62gMbgb1aa	well .. this depends on how was your relationship before that.. and what was cause that made you break up.. <br>  then you will know if she worth to be forgiven or not.
WpGROxH8aa	Its difficult to say without knowing a little bit more about the condition she's in. Can she walk at all? Either way, you should have her go outside when its nice sometimes. Either take a short walk or push her around in her wheelchair.<br>  Maybe play board games when you're inside. Does she like music? Did she ever play an instrument or sing? You could sing with her. There was a woman at a nursing home where I used to volunteer that would forget she knew how to play the piano but when she sat down at the piano she could read the music and play. <br>  You can read to her or with her. <br>  What hobbies was she interested in when she was younger. Is there any way she can continue with similar things now. Maybe not to the same extent, but modified versions of what she used to do?|`|4HoVVCenaa	Walks, and outdoor time is good. New things that stimulate the mind are better than old, repetitive stuff. Trips to the musem, concerts, etc. Take her clubbing... once. Anything new. Both of you learn a new language.|`|gPYTkIW2aa	You should definitely get her sudoku and word game books. Those will help prevent Alzheimer's. Also keep arthritis out of her hands. I would suggest acrostic and logic puzzles. Puzzles themselves also stimulate the mind. I would look in the area for groups that go and play bingo and bunko or something. That will get her out of the house. Have her join a quilting circle. She'll meet people and exercise her hands and eyes. I hope you find something that works. Good Luck!!|`|yiUNN8ADaa	My grandmother LOVED puzzles! We'd always work on puzzles together and we'd have great conversations while doing it. You could always take your grandmother to a movie. Theaters are handicapped accessible and many provide headphones for the hard of hearing. If you'd like her to be physically active, take a short walk around the block with her. Get her out in the fresh air. Maybe you guys could make a scrapbook together. A family tree? Go through her old photo albums with her and let her tell you stories about her past. I hope those helped! :)|`|X8riDZBqaa	You could enrol her in an educational class.<br>  Or a senior's group.<br>  Or an activity one-like swimming.<br>  Encourage crosswords, puzzles, reading, the 'puter etc.<br>  Ask about when she was younger.<br>  Get her to plan meals.<br>  Solitaire, other card games.<br>  Word games like Scrabble.<br>  Board games in general.|`|vvaZoMU4aa	you can play board games,and  also to  walk in the park together or on the beach (depends on where you live)
VZVGXRyraa	There are no set morals for a certain age. Morals are person specific. You're a hurting unit if you need to ask other people what your morals are.<br>  <br>  And respecting yourself... You should know this too. Act civil, stand up for yourself, don't hook up with every guy that comes around. Before you do something think about and answer 2 questions. "What could result from this?" and "Is what could result from this good or bad?". If it's bad, in any way, don't do it.|`|hHndD5SEaa	well do what makes you feel good and what you consider as respectufl.... if that means you dont sleep around then do that - if it means you dont carry on in a certain manner - then do that... just do what feels right to you and what you consider respectful.<br>  xx|`|AA11826328	You are at an age where you can show the world who you are and what you are made of, there are a few things that you can do to show people that you love yourself and that you have nothing but the utmost respect for yourself things such as the following:<br>  *The way you speak tells a lot about you I mean when you carry yourself like a woman and not a little girl helps others to respect you.<br>  *The way you dress also tells a lot about you this may tell to the most about you and how you feel, you don't have to wear clothes that hide your shape or anything like that but, at the same time you do not have to wear clothes that make you look like a slut either. <br>  The colors tells a lot to, as long as you love yourself and you reflect that in everything you do then you are on the right track, If you are happy with the choices that you make in your life then you are doing what is right to show the world what kinds of morals you have.<br>  You are at that age where you are finding yourself and learning to love yourself, enjoy it, enjoy life and finding what it is that you want for you and not what others want for you okay.<br>  Good Luck & Enjoy your life....Lil Angel|`|YSEQilzxaa	Answer 2 Ur Query:-<br>  1)Be Polite...<br>  2)Dress what u wann dress bt dont use such a cloths tht dirty eyes would pas comment in ur behalf or stare at you in those gaps...<br>  3)Avoid talking loudly..laughing loudly too creat bad impression....<br>  4) cover ur body if someone stares at u...<br>  5) Use smooth makeup...dont use such a makeup so tht they wud call u tht type of girl<br>  6)...U didnt mention ur background,carrier..thus I cant explain my views....Above 5 points varies frm girls t girls...<br>  <br>  Ur Bro!!!!!|`|C44Ux50paa	i think you show that you respect yourself by living by YOUR rules. do what you want and make sure you have no problem telling people NO if it's not what you want.|`|e4M8RZ3Maa	goh girl#  stop moaning !  you know perfectly well.<br>  smart attire.  responsible.  not on drink or drugs.  nice nails.  friendly manneretc..you know this stuff its easy...|`|OAYaeW22aa	be with respectful ppl and always bring a condom to a bar lol|`|i4bjQbPcaa	You can show people you have self respect by dressing well and being clean.

NeTNnvSZaa	I know quite a few men who are extremely subservient.  AND they pay for everything when we go out AND they feel like it's a privilege to do so.  They're lucky guys.<br>  <br>  You sound kind of bitter.  Kind of like you've wined and dined but got nothing for your trouble.  They call that sour grapes.|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	Well I for one would not trust any man to keep me so I am financially independent. Real women assume that men are going to be a gentleman and pick up the tab for dinner out unless she insists on going "dutch".<br>  Womens roles today have changed, years ago it was the norm to get married, keep your husband happy in the home, cook, clean, iron, bear children, raise them and men went to work to be the breadwinner.<br>  Today women can do all of the above and hold down a job which I think intimidates men.<br>  You have obviously been meeting the wrong kind of women if you feel that they want a meal ticket and a free ride, if you want to catch a different fish start changing the bait.<br>  Oh by the way if you and I were on a date and you ever brought that subject up, you would find yourself having dinner alone,  I find your question presumptuous and offensive.|`|O0pYOOpAaa	It goes both ways and there are so many different people in this world.<br>  <br>  Women are smart and at the same time they have "female flaws" - like men have "male specific" flaws. Today, I think it's a mixture of both. Some men are subservient to women and some women are subservient to men. Some women are just bad, one sided, and narrow minded. I think the same goes for men, sometimes.<br>  <br>  From what I see though, women get there way most of the time. Not because men are subservient, but because men allow women to take control of them. I think it's because men don't see the sense in arguing about small petty stuff and just want peace so they give up their rights to the female nagging.<br>  <br>  But, not all females are like that... just most of them.|`|15jfF0tKaa	KNOW WHO YOU ARE FIRST.  If a woman says an opinion, listen up because hey thats what they are about!  If you want a woman to work, be real about it!   <br>  Women know what they want, unless you get them young and empower their education for a trade.  So let's review: If you think a woman is looking for an easy ride----SAY SO!  If you want a woman to work, SAY SO.  Expect to have to listen, expect to have to know what you want to be happy.

They have their own thoughts, interests, and beliefs and no man can or should interfear with it.  Some women are brought up to be more traditional or don't trust men to bring up children when they can hardly take care of themselves.  But don't think they don't have goals other than that.  I plan to be a self sufficient, self providing lawyer and any man who thinks that makes me lazy or like I am being catered to clearly has a low opinion of women and doesn't deserve to be graced by their presence.|`|TKqeuxDPaa	Your comments are not FAIR !!!

In this day and age it almost always takes both people working, but if you put your mind to it and sacrfice a few things...one person can do it alone..dont close your mind to finding a woman that will show you she is worth it !!!!|`|EYOQVTGbaa	WELL i I think You should be a Gentleman and pay its a write.

wsxMUdYZaa	Survive? Maybe...<br>  <br>  BUT I think a marriage shouldnt only survive. It is much more than that. With your wedding you should start the happiest, the most amazing part of your life and I am sure sexuality is a great part of a relationship. It is not everything, but did you try to make a chicken soup without salt? Yes, of course it doesnt consist only of salt, but without that little spoon it wouldnt be tasty at all.<br>  <br>  If you had no sexual life before your marriage, maybe you just need a little time to open up. Take it slow, step by step :)<br>  <br>  I am a very sexual person but will not have sex till my marriage - cant wait to tear off his clothes and jump on him and satisfy him in every way, everywhere, all the time as soon as we are married :D|`|AIuN5Lw9aa	Only if you are really, truly happy in this type of relationship. I've never heard of something like this, though. Usually having sex is one of the highlights of a marriage, being that intimate and close with someone. I know I certainly enjoy it in mine.|`|3SSVBJAqaa	Only if it works for the both of you. Me personally, I go a week without it and get all crazy and cranky.|`|AA11603468	How very sad. To my way of thinking, sex is an essential part of a healthy and loving relationship. Something is wrong if you're 21 years old, and have no physical desire for your partner.<br>  <br>  If you were totally ok with the situation, you wouldn't be on here asking a bunch of strangers what they thought about it. And a marriage shouldn't "survive", it should thrive-totally different. It's like can a person survive without love...I guess they could, but what a huge and wonderful thing to miss out on.|`|NuUdCz0Laa	Apparently you are a very lucky person and have managed to find a mate that has the same desires in their personal life.

That seems sort of ridiculous. Most guys need to get off way more than that, so he's probably masterbating all the time, with or without you knowing it.

Personally I think it adds to the marriage experience.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	No.  A marriage can't survive without sex - in my opinion.  Sex is a natural stress release and should not be missed...|`|6UmRmaeWaa	If you both agree then there is not point to asking this question...<br>  <br>  On the other hand I think you need it to keep a relationship bonded<br>  <br>  physically and mentally.|`|AA11328507	No one NEEDS sex, if your both content with being married and not having sex that is your right and your business.|`|ldB0Fyo2aa	Please don't have children until you've explored this a little. I thought it was okay to go without sex, too. Six years later, my husband I are getting a divorce. It really isn't usual that newlyweds, especially so young, aren't sexual. <br>  <br>  I would encourage you to reach out to someone to help you examine this a bit. Check with your local social services office, your church, or a neighbor who may have had counseling. I totally recommend the Imago type of couples therapy. It's amazing, and can help a couple grow closer together. <br>  <br>  If you need help finding resources, just add that to your question. <br>  <br>  Really, I encourage you to look at this a little more. And please, please don't have sex just to have children. That's what we did and I wish, wish, wish we hadn't. I love my kids but now I'm stuck in a divorce. <br>  <br>  I wish you the best of luck.|`|5mTKspfYaa	your marriage is doomed.<br>  <br>  get out while you have your sanity.  you're obviously not in love with your partner.<br>  <br>  was this arranged?<br>  <br>  seriously, sex isn't everything, but this is so wrong for so many other reasons I just don't have time to write.<br>  <br>  you will regret every minute you spend in this "marriage"<br>  <br>  get out and discover who you are|`|uP4qnB6raa	You  should really talk with your husband about this conversation if anything. I mean if you feel that you two don't need to have sex to keep your relationship alive, then more power to the both of you. Really. But don't assume that he feels he doesn't need it either. He's only human, he might want it more then you think he does. But over all, no, you don't need sex to survive marriage. Only weak ppl do.|`|S2aeGQpdaa	i'd say it's hard for a marriage to survive w/o it because you may be tempted to cheat if you're not getting sex from your spouse. sex is only one part of a marriage and as long as you two are agreeing on the sex issue, then it's on you two.<br>  <br>  but the fact that you are asking this question makes me wonder if you are actually ok with it.|`|CF1R0TPvaa	Yes, in fact a marriage can survive anything as long as the other person will put up with it.  If one person is committed to marriage, or they are too scared to leave, or they don't see any better options, they will stick it out even if they feel abused.|`|beTrAYHRaa	I guess it can my husband and I have not slept together for a long time and it does not bother me at all.I can careless whether it bother him.We are still married so I guess it can survive without sex.|`|avhYoGREaa	Um, a marriage can survive without sex very rarely.<br>  Read the book, "His needs Her needs".|`|y4w6ybr3aa	If you both feel the same way then there shouldn't be a problem.<br>  In my opinion your just room mates without intercourse
geJM58L2aa	Different people would deal with the situation in different ways.  If in the past he was a victim of any sort of sexual abuse or molestation, he could be reluctant to become sexual with anyone because of his past.  I think that'd be an interesting novel.|`|m1d0fxj5aa	yes its highly possible. but most people that were abused like that normally do semi get over it and can lead normal sex lives|`|JDZku5iSaa	Yes. He might want to have sex but when faced with the actual situation he could be freaked out by the whole thing and not be able to do it.|`|Y3LVpCMNaa	I will tell you straight up that like rape everybody takes it differently. You think about it how would you feel if somebody just violated you in any kind of way. The character you make will have their own way with dealing with it. If it was a women that person could develop a fear of women, if it was a man something else could happen. It all depends on that persons own emotions and personality.You should watch more television like "law and order special victims unit" or watch a few movies, take a few psychology classes. Things like that could help or talk to a therapist about how some clients might fill.|`|o5rfI7oUaa	No because i like girls my own age! Sometimes it doesn't affect people that much because you are young so to ansewer your question it would be depending on the person.. I got over it..|`|AA11826328	I am not entirely sure about this subject of course I am not a Dr. or anything but, I have a neighbor who's little boy was sexually abused twice, once when he was like a yr-old and then again between the ages of 3-5 yrs.-old both times were by girls older than he the 1st time it was like an 8 yr-old girl a family friend's child then the 2nd time it was by an 13 yr-old girl that was a cousin I think anyway, my neighbor tells me that she had to take her son to see a counselor for years and he is very shy, I do have girls and they all play together the boy is still a child as of right now but, she (the mother) says that he is not willing to be left  alone with older females he does get very uncomfortable when girls get too close like in play, Now as far as I can see this child may not grow-up and not like girls but, if he gets help like he is getting then may be he will be able to have a healthy relationship with a woman, now take another child who has been put in the same type of situation and did not have the help do you think this child will grow-up normal, I think they would have a lot of issues, so if I were you I would go to a site on the internet dealing with the mental because that is what it will boil down to, if the child a child can handle such a thing by the time they reach adulthood.<br>  Good Luck with the book...<br>  Lil Angel|`|VZVGXRyraa	I was a victim of child molestation and while, i'm not afraid of it...i know others that are.<br>  <br>  The effects of molestation vary from person to person. There are no set signs.

t5mX3rwLaa	My last girlfriend was 30, Im 23 when we started going out together, even though I would like to say age is not important we did find some bumps along the way, for example, she wanted to be a mother, which I thought was great, I was up for that, but the difference between us was the timing, her biological clock was screaming for motherhood, while I on the other hand was not in a rush, we even discussed the fact that I was ok with being a parent so young, like your date I′ve been trough a lot and don′t act  mi age, but she felt that, and it bothered her, anyway, it`s not impossible, but it is a challenge, and you have to enter the relationship knowing exactly those things so that they don′t become an issue later on|`|4HoVVCenaa	Enjoy it while it lasts. Nothing wrong with it. You are both adults. But don't expect it to last. Don't fall too deep in love.|`|EjyD1sXeaa	age is just a number, yes, but...<br>  within the next 6 or 8 years, do you want kids? cos after that it starts getting risky.<br>  does he want that commitment by the time he's 26?<br>  <br>  16 years diff isn't that bad  - especially when  we grow older, that gap lessens, and women live longer than men, so I've always thought we should marry a slightly younger man.<br>  <br>  You say you have a lot in common and you can probably relate to many things that have occurred in the media etc, so I would recommend the relationship. It's not like you're hurting anyone.<br>  <br>  keep me posted and good luck|`|n8nhjmfraa	uhh well its not illegal but that's a huge age difference<br>  but if youre both happy, then why not.<br>  personally though, i thinks a little weird that you are interested in some one about half your age<br>  good luck i guess|`|geJM58L2aa	If you're happy, good for you.|`|y76ZHadsaa	RAPPEEEEE!!!!

Then you could also take some business classes to learn how to run your business and then also look into some classes on hospitality which would help you be a great success in your catering business!

QF3Lbm7Paa	Of course its normal- its like saying you don't like everyone you know- you can't like everyone and family takes more work then most but it is well worth it in the end cos when you are in trouble or upset there is nothing like family.<br>  you can pick your friends but you can't pick your family which is why it is chance whether you mesh well or not and so you family aren't people you would choose to hang out with other wise but you are so make it work.<br>  You will regret if say the next time you see them is your parents funeral or their wedding.|`|OWjbg4GYaa	My father's family is just like that. He as 10 brothers and sisters in total, and they never ever talk to each other. The last time he talked to my grandma was 4 months ago. When my grandpa die he only went to the funeral because my mom told him to go, and that is just the relationship that he as with his parents because with his brothers and sisters is just worst, I don't even remember the last time they had a normal decent conversation. I hate it because I feel like I grew up with no relatives.
89d3bf3b50a93d03e19347179f7c0974aa	Depends on what you mean by go further. If i was with someone for 4 months and happy...id do what it takes to make her happy|`|61Fwbi79aa	Something else is going on here. There is a reason that he is not getting closer.|`|WFRooU7Maa	Let her do what she wants|`|LcOPL8gCaa	I'm a girl, but I wouldn't want to go further with a guy i've been dating only for 4 months. There are other things you have to look at, reasons why you should & shouldn't. I mean, I'm not sure what you mean further, but most the time its sex. Which you sound really young because your spelling is bad. Its He not his hunny. Anyways, I wouldn't allow anything after 4 months besides, kissing and cuddling. But its me, make your own choices. But learn from them. <br>  Good Luck & Best wishes!|`|maj3V0ioaa	let her do what she wants it cant really be that bad for him to wanna get away from him|`|OAYaeW22aa	you would date and have some physical feeling lool|`|FzFSzilmaa	further??? as in sex?? bring it on... :D|`|2R1dYsUKaa	haha what he doesn't wanna go further when his gf does?? well hmmmm don't start a fight that will cause problems down the road....he should just tell her he like/loves her and thinks going further will only complicate the relationship and that he thinks it can wait cause he loves/likes her and that going further isn't that important to him.....but for the record i would agree to go further cause it's not gonna hurt anything.|`|Ddn9I9v3aa	I would **** her like a rabbit and lick her like a dog.

2gRrmPsvaa	You weren't attracted to her. She pushed it onto you. She was on her period. EXTREMELY overweight?! You seriously could've made a BETTER CHOICE for your FIRST TIME, which is supposed to be special and unforgettable. Or did you just want to do it with somebody, anybody? The overweight(especially the EXTREMELY overweight) will always try to push a relationship on you and play hard to get rid of. You didn't want to do it in the first place, so you shouldn't have. Well, you're not a virgin anymore, and you can't redo the first time. Next time when you're "in the moment," listen to your heart, not your dick. You had no excuse to give it to someone you didn't wanna give it to. You kinda set yourself up for this. She just better not be PREGNANT...|`|9c1566c47a15c85674bb15bd22990182aa	Well that's a tough one, but whatever you do, be honest with her; she'll respect you more in the end.  Just don't be a jerk about it.  Tell her you didn't see things going that far and you're sorry they did.  Yeah that's horrible that she didn't tell you she was on her period, gross.|`|v96pYAg1aa	Truth is there is nothing u cant say that wont hurt this girls feelings the fact is u should just tell her that u dnt like her other wise she will keep calling and messaging and man that is the most annoying thing in the world|`|kqCFJhsMaa	Im not a man and I know you only want men to answer but you should tell her it was a mistake and you dont want to furthur the relationship.|`|WwELeJMTaa	LOL wow.. and are you sure it was her period and not just her first time? And there is no way a chick forced you to have sex. you wanted too.  <br>  <br>  and im sorry but now you will have to marry her. sucks to be you|`|w8QkrUhBaa	she is one of the fat ones that was desperate for some loving, just tell her straight up that you dont want to be with her and it was just a mistake.|`|LuDNY9Dkaa	There is no way you can save her feelings now.<br>  Do what you have to do.|`|3f905d1b2081a81c29e857f2f95f5c89aa	You had sex, want to stop seeing her, and not hurt her feelings?

There is no way around that.  You may want to consider staying with her if you feel that strongly that you don't want to hurt her feelings.  Additionally, would she look that bad if she lost a lot of weight?  You may want to  suggest that she go on a diet and exercise for her sake as well as yours.  <br>  <br>  Some women will not tell you that they are on their period, prior to having sex with you because of what is in this next sentence.  If you do break-up with her, there is a chance that you may still get a call in a few months telling you you're going to be a father.|`|AA10140520	She may be in love with you, get to know her more, talk to her, weight & looks don't matter-my woman is overweight & I'm happy with her. (anyways, can she get pregnant?-did you use protection?)|`|61Fwbi79aa	dont string her along. Just let her know that there is nothing there. It might hurt her, but not as bad as misleading her.|`|d4kwKpBNaa	I guess you should tell her how you feel. If that doesn′t work, be rude, but do not let things get to another level.|`|JLayHNZCaa	Maybe she was virgin?|`|AA10823062	Tell her that you enjoyed being with her but that you are not yet ready for a serious relationship. You can be honest without hurting her feelings. Tell her that you would like to meet other women before you decide to get serious with any one person. That does not say anything bad about you or about her. You should continue being nice to her but you don't need to sleep with her any more than a woman who likes being your friend needs to sleep with you.|`|WFRooU7Maa	Just tell her that you aren't that into her<br>  and that you made a mistake<br>  And that you don't want to get serious with her<br>  It might make her mad, but it is the best way to get her off your back|`|XEcoJnt4aa	honest , honesty, honesty is always the best policy. It is not usually the easiest, but yes, it is the best!|`|pRF5LLloaa	last time that happened to me, I married her.<br>  <br>  that was more than 30 years and three children ago.

pVnUhYLQaa	It sounds like everything is going well for you; why do you want to mess it up with marriage?<br>  <br>  EDIT: lol, I knew I was asking for thumbs down. I just see marriage as unnecessary. Love is love. a promise is a promise. Why get paper work involved?|`|w1necKzYaa	take her to a fancy Restaurant and get down on one knee! or in front of her family and or take her somewhere with a beautiful view! also if possible ask her father for his permission!|`|JHAqEETmaa	Ask her hand to her father.<br>  I know this sounds a little old-fashioned but even in XXI century women really love this romantic idea. Even if you already live with her and you're expecting a child.<br>  <br>  Still, if you find this ridiculous, tell her that as you'll be a father you know you'll be spend the rest of your life with her. so, the next step is marriage.<br>  <br>  If you don't like this idea, well i can't help you anymore and good luck!|`|yah14b6gaa	i think what you should do is show her a very nice time have a romantic night. take out to dinner, a walk on the beach then have a surprise waiting for her at home like candles and rose pedals every were tell her how much you love and then pop the question hey i cant help that i'm a romantic type of gal good luck|`|0PCaKDxHaa	the best proposals are unique... <br>  <br>  my now husband proposed at the wishing well at disneyland... after we'd been at the park the whole day... we wanted to watch fireworks, but they were cancelled... so we went to the wishing well and tossed our coins all together, then all our friends started to walk away... and when i turned around my boyfriend was down on one knee... so of course we have pictures of it all... thats really important to me....<br>  <br>  a friend of mine... was in bed with her boyfriend on valentines day some years ago... and at about 1130, he just reached into the night stand and tossed out a box to her... and said "wanna get married?".... <br>  <br>  another friend was proposed to on christmas eve... the ring was in an ornament on the tree... she opened her gift, an IPOD... and played the only song DL'd onto it... it was a voice recording of her boyfriend tellin her to go to the tree and find the blue ornament.. there was something inside for her... she went to the tree, and as she opened it, he got down on one knee in front of his whole family to propose...<br>  <br>  a friend from work was proposed to by her boyfriend.. he had a day off work... spent the whole day at the engagement ring store... she came home and was mad that he hadnt cleaned the house or done his "chores"... so she started questioning what he'd done... he got angry and threw the box at her and said "i'll clean the house later, this is what i was doing all day"... needless to say she felt bad...<br>  <br>  proposals are meant to be remembered for a life time... people are going to ask how you proposed... so make it unique...
wia9SXCPaa	Sounds like your in the middle of a giant soap opera.<br>  <br>  I don't think the marriage stands much of a chance.<br>  <br>  Sorry!|`|AXbdNdPzaa	You should get your head on straight before you marry anyone.  I am not sure if you are ready to be in a committed relationship with anyone at this time.  Good luck.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	you've only been dating a total of 6 months and you have already been living together for 5 of those months?<br>  <br>  statistically, no.<br>  1.  you haven't been together very long<br>  2.  you're still playing on again/off again footsie with a HS ex who you cheated on.<br>  3.  you've never mentioned that you feel anything beyond obligation to your current partner.  Granted he's stable but you don't know that he will never leave you.  There are no guarantees.  If you remain as tepid about him as you are right now then I can guarantee that he will leave you for someone who makes him feel like superstar.<br>  <br>  My advice would be to make up your mind about which man you really want to be with and drop the other one cold turkey.<br>  <br>  If you still decide that your current partner is that man then don't be in a rush to marry him.  Take time to get to know him and decide if he really is who you want to be with.  Don't settle for him because "he's stable" and "will never leave". (which BTW is not a bad thing.  It's good that you recognize that you need stability and fidelity but don't let that be your only criteria.  You need to make sure that you're stable and faithful as well, otherwise your stable, faithful man *will* leave you.  If you can't give back to him what you want from him then he's the wrong guy for you even though he has qualities that you want and need.)<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|fe9b89ef9075d826f6d2b372470173b0aa	He might be stable, but you certainly don't seem to be. You are in no way ready to get married to either one. Until you can forget everyone else and commit yourself to your partner, marriage is a BIG mistake - and it's an even bigger one to bring children into that picture.|`|avhYoGREaa	Definitely go for the guy from school.<br>  He obviously loves you, the other guy just sounds like a perv.|`|tKjSWha2aa	nope|`|uP4qnB6raa	WOW! That sounds like a story that should be made into a movie or something. That must be hard. I honestly think that weather or not you love your current boy friend or fiance, I think you are moving way to fast. You have only dated him for 6 months, and you've already lived with him. It's much too soon. Especially for marriage. I mean ok go ahead and be engaged thats fine, but at least wait a year or two to actually make the big move. Be careful. Marriage is a serious thing you know.
beTrAYHRaa	I asked that same question a couple of days ago.I am married and I fell in love with a married man who is great in bed and is just awesome to me period.I never asked him for no money I am very independent I enjoy him not what he can do for me.My husband likes to argue and yell so this other guy is the total opposite of my husband .So i say enjoy it while it last but be extra careful of how much of your hurt you put in .When it is over the pain is unbearable always stay prepared.|`|803c63e1bdfd226d14f4e5cafdc52f7eaa	That is cheating and is morally reprehensible.|`|pRF5LLloaa	You stay with your marriage partner, and you STOP thinking about other men.|`|wia9SXCPaa	You go back to your husband and tell him what your having issues with.  You give your husband every benefit of the doubt.  You work on your marriage.  If you still aren't happy and you do decide to end your marriage.  After the divorce and only after the divorce do you even consider another man.|`|yd2SP7d6aa	Bottom line, if you're married and you see another man it means you are an unfaithful, slut / whore who deserves to have her vagina sewn shut.  Anymore questions?<br>  <br>  If your unhappy tell your husband and try to fix the situation and if you can't fix it than be upfront and get a divorce.|`|zhaHc4FAaa	I would be cheating.   It's wrong and it will hurt me and my family.   I would work harder at my marriage.   Nothing in life that was worth it was ever easy.   Save your marriage and cut off communication that would hinder the bond of your marriage.  <br>  <br>  How would you feel if the shoe were on the other foot and your guy ran off with some woman and took all his money with him?   Just think about it.|`|AA12240972	It's called cheating and I wouldn't do it.
t7AIAXo9aa	I don't understand what you're asking...<br>  <br>  If you really like her, then you should ask her out! That's a no brainer. But don't if you're not going to treat her well. If she's in a home like that, she does NOT need even more stress. You could be that one person who's always there for her. She'll need you, and you better be ready to take on a lot. Treat her right. She deals with enough as it is. You can help her by just being there for her, listening, and caring.|`|ablriuUVaa	if she turns 14 before u turn 16 thats cool<br>  but if ur 16 and her 13 thats pretty bad|`|yPMPx78waa	i dont get what the question is here?|`|edpKlRnhaa	you can probably help her by being her everything. jids in foster homes usually need somebody to love them. If you start going with her, just do your best not to hurt her. You will never know how much that helps.|`|v96pYAg1aa	Ask her if she likes u if she says as a friend then u are done if u say she is as mature as u think she is then there is probably no chance as to the fact that she might not be into relationships|`|rAXkpuzIaa	If u really want to help her, don't treat her like a whipped pup.|`|opT8Uc8Paa	that's so sweet. thankfully ive never been in a foster home but ive been in other situations that considers this kind of help.<br>  and to be completely honest this girl has to be mature for her age to go through so much so the least you could do for her is be there. try taking some of the weight off her shoulders by showing her there's a world outside the one shes been taught to grow up in. <br>  i wouldn't exactly take her home right away until she says its ok, since you'll be showing her the family she never had but try going out to lunch or going shopping (which i know sounds horrifying but its not so bad!) <br>  but like i said be there for her, its the least you could do.|`|sz52aXMjaa	If she turns 14 before you turn 16 thats fine.<br>  And who cares if shes in a foster home?|`|jLNnwWcpaa	i would ask her out, and then talk to her and comfert her tell her its gong to be all right, tell her ure there for her.|`|zanfEbhTaa	help her by being with her.<br>  if she wants..|`|Ddn9I9v3aa	You are too stupid to get her.

Get out now while you can|`|5cf0470a204de934eb842ceee9cb69cfaa	Then it seems as if you need to communicate more with him, The key to a good relationship is communication.

You deserve to be happy, so go for it!|`|4EWCegiRaa	That's a no.<br>  <br>  Even if it was a 'maybe', he would have lied to make you feel better about it if he cared.  "Yea, I guess" is more of a "Well... this is better than nothing and I can't say no so..."|`|AA10928214	That's a no.<br>  Go out with someone that is definitley happy with you.<br>  Don't waste your time.|`|sr0vZPQqaa	What is the question?

7foornMVaa	You need to let it go.  He will never understand nor does he want to. Men don't work like that.  He said he was sorry and probably meant it the first time but if you keep harping on it, it wont mean a thing except to shut you up.  <br>  You two are arguing over spilled milk. He should have told you that he would call you in the morning and you should accept that answer and be satisfied.<br>  Try and get over this and be happy.  Its not worth the fight.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|HMhUKAgkaa	Do it bakc to him. Don't answer next time he calls and when you call him back later, just say you didn't think about answering the phone, that's why you didn't answer.|`|oojO4WAraa	The problem is you. You knew where he was at and what he was doing.  You sound high maintenance, demanding and hard to get along with, also selfish and immature.  The guy should be able to go out and have some fun without you getting all bent out of shape.|`|0fVtHNtmaa	If it's a only a one time thing then don't make a big deal out of it.|`|vjijiJT3aa	give him some time and space, he'll talk to you when he's ready.|`|rAXkpuzIaa	Put it behind u, but be cautious.|`|EnMB5V7eaa	It is quite obvious from your story that he is seeing someone else, probably having sex with her too. Maybe its because you nag him too much.|`|GLa6jrNoaa	Sorry to say this but sounds like he is trying to avoid the relations ship in more blunt words he is going to break up with u cuz he don't care about the relationship|`|PS83gPGoaa	you knew he was going out so why ask him to ring you if you dont like talkin to drunk people|`|edpKlRnhaa	I think you're over-reacting..He was at his mom's b-day party!! just chill out and let the guy have a good time..|`|3Ks21ASDaa	You have the right to be upset but if you love him don't let it ruin your relationship. Boys don't think sometimes... he cares about you but he was too caught up in the party to think about calling or texting then. He thought about it when he was drunk, atleast give him credit for that.|`|5tz405Iaaa	Well in my opinion  he's an ***, I mean.. I'm not the number one boyfriend in the world.. I would say somewhere between Judas and Hitler, and I would still let the little lady involved know where I am and what I am doing.. It's not a case of having to tell them where you are at all hours but it just shows some courtesy. Sounds like he's a lil bit of a jerk, he has gotta put it some more time/effort I mean you've put the ball in his court now. If he doesn't buck up his idea's cut him off because going down that road just leads to a crappy relationship, (PS I dunno sounds suspicious to me, check that slime ball didn't hook up with some skank at this party)|`|AA11452969	Its  not too much too ask but for a guy they dont really care or understand how it means to us women. This is one of our differences sad but true. For him it wasnt really such a big deal. i know how you feel. but if u will just be upset about it and not move on you guys arent goin to get better. Just try to let it go and next time, dont expect anythig from him. You cannot tell them what to do. They have their own ways and own minds. Guys doesnt like girls who demands things from them. If they want to do it they will do it. dont ask for it or you will just be upset about it if they dont meet ur expectation. There are times when u need to really be direct and ask them but there are also some situation that you need to just mind ur own and not try to control things u cannot control. Next time u can just remind him to text or call you after a party or whatever, but then expect the worst already so u dont need to get upset.|`|XphTDpR7aa	This is a funny situation cuz I have been in both. The thing you have to realize is that he just got done workin  a 12 hour shift... and  then there is a party to go to after work.You get done with a long day and then you have more **** to do.And it was his mom's bday so he wanted to spend time with his family or whatever.But I do agree with you that he should have thrown a text your way atleast and said he was going to be late. My gf doens't do that all the time and I get pissed but expect her to understand when I don't do it for her...maybe it's a guy thing Idk. Best of luck|`|M3zEOfwOaa	If he "wasnt thinking about textn u", then u need to let him go..he forgot u because of his family..bullsh*t he is prob cheating on u, or jus doesnt care enough about u 2 not let u worry..he sounds like a jerk!|`|eYtgcHwkaa	He's not ready to take you seriously and you're not ready for a serious relationship, either.<br>  Go your seperate ways|`|EYOQVTGbaa	If he Carry's on like this maybe you should talk to someone allot closer about this<br>  <br>  <br>  hope this helps|`|100FJWDUaa	you should know to nvr wright something that long on yahoo answers........i didnt even read it...we don thave the time for that...but i would say no..its not to much to ask|`|FMfQVCkDaa	sounds to me like you are being a little too smothery on him.  thats the technical term lol<br>  <br>  srsly, chill out.  the guy worked all day and then had an impromptu good time with the guys and actually DID end up calling you before the night was over.  even though he was drunk, he wanted to let you know what was going on.  <br>  <br>  see it from his shoes.  he probably doesnt think of you like his mother, i mean, do you really want him to think he has to report in every day or so?  things probably wont last if you try and keep him on that tight of a leash and freak the hell out like that.|`|TKqeuxDPaa	You arent going to get him to understand...I hate to tell you that but its the truth..men dont understand womens feelings..they are very selfish people. its about them and whats important to them. If you choose to let this go..you might make up and go on...but it will happen again, so what do you do?? Either you hold out for a man that isnt going to be selfish...which isnt likely to happen or you be with this man and accept him for what he is...if all you have to deal with is a night here and there that he doesnt call or text..you have it made...good luck. Hey, pick your battles carefully..
2b0a3200c0db672cf39c688cc41d456caa	If he truly loves you the way he says he does, he will wait for you to be ready, and will respect your feelings on this.  Follow your heart, and stay true to yourself.  True love would never make you compromise yourself.|`|CM1dfztQaa	If he got that upset about not living together before getting married, then he has no intention of getting married. Sounds like he needs a place to live.<br>  <br>   If he loves you and wants to marry you, he will be willing to do this the way you are most comfortable. He shouldn't expect you to compromise your religious beliefs to be with him. <br>  <br>  If you start giving in on major things already, you can look forward to a lot of years of being walked on and treated like your feelings and beliefs don't matter. Don't let him back you into that corner. Know in your heart that you deserve better.|`|dd0d57e5ff24820c6981c10f9097112faa	i suppose he isnt a member of your church?  he sounds like he's ready to 'play house' but not actually get married and by his reaction...it seems he never will marry you.   i would say you may have to let this one go if he insists on living together first 'in sin' and you cant live that way.  that's a very big line to draw and you should stick to it and stay behind it deary.|`|efbb15bd3b273c3e6801e5fe2b1add09aa	My advice to you is to stick to your beliefs.  If you don't want to live together before marriage, then he should respect you and your desires and do everything he can to make it happen the way you want it to.  If you cave in now, and give in to your fear of losing him, then he will always manipulate you to get his way.  If he does leave because you won't shack up with him, then he really isn't the right guy for you.|`|gLXzVbm8aa	if he doesn't understand that you cannot move in with him then he probably will not care about your feelings towards other things. explain that you are not ready that you would rather get married first and good luck|`|i7b1WiLNaa	Don't do something you are uncomfortable with.<br>  <br>  You gotta lay it on the line!|`|7oF2o4q5aa	My now husband and I did that years ago.  We even lied to the pastor of the church we were married in (a LOT of guilt over that).  I told my mom that I was moving and "Steve" was moving in with me.  That simple for me.  Anyway, we didn't lie to his family, we just didn't say anything.  At one point his sister called at 7:00 a.m. and I said, "Oh, I don't know where Steve keeps his pens" to take a note...it was a big family joke for a while!  They ALL knew and his mother is very religious.  I think they accepted it because they knew we were going to get married.  BUT if you don't feel it is right then don't do it.  If he walks because of it, maybe that's a good thing and you will see his real character.  Everything happens for a reason.  If he is going to walk over something like this then he would walk out during the marriage, too, if there was BIG trouble.  You also have to decide FOR YOURSELF what is right.  This is an adult relationship and you are an adult.  You have to decide this issue between you and you or you and God, however, you care to look at that.  Don't ever let someone make a decision like that for you or make you do something against what you truly believe in.|`|AA11032586	You've answered your own question. You do not need to live in sin. You know it is wrong, by acknowledging trying to hide it from Church Family. If he cannot understand it is wrong, but no marriage for right now, I would say, loosen up the ties to him a little, until he is ready for marriage. Good luck. God Bless.|`|dzbblpjgaa	Do not compromise your beliefs. If you do this for your man how do you know he will not make other requests or suggestions you do not like? If he does not respect you on this and can see you upset and he still applies the pressure?  I would actually cool it a bit. If he sees how he has been, maybe he will let the subject go for a while. I hope you find a way to continue as you are for a while. Good Luck :)|`|o5rfI7oUaa	My advice would to follow your family.. Even though you are old enough to make your own decisions.. Your bf shouldn't get too upset with you just try to plead with him|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	if he truly loves you he will respect your decions, if he doesnt then he isnt hthe one|`|AA11205208	If he doesn't respect your values regarding living together than he is not accepting  you for who you are and what you believe.<br>  <br>  I hate to say it but if I were you I would reevaluate the whole relations-hp and see where you may have already compromised your beliefs and values for his.<br>  <br>  Just little things, but things you have nonetheless compromised. I would bet that you discover a little trail of small things that lead up to this bigger demand. <br>  <br>  If he cannot respect your beliefs and values then no matter how much you love him your relationship is one-sided and unhealthy.|`|b7bb85526b028b7f92b16c8204ed4012aa	The most important thing here is that you do what you feel is right for you. Dont worry about what anyone else thinks as this is your life so if you feel good about doing it then by all means go for it. But if you have the slightest doubt about it, then forget it as youll never be happy and could destroy it quicker than if you didnt do it. If he truly does love you more than anything than he will honor your wishes and focus more on marrying you.|`|pWz8d8MBaa	UMMM... wait if hes going to leave u over this than it shows you the real person he is and i would not want to stay with a guy who gets upset when you try and tell him what you want to do! do not move in with this guy, even if u decide you want to it will be a test on if he loves you he can wait. this might be a sign that even if it is nearly impossible to not try and get him back if he leaves you because of this that this happened for a reason and there's still the one out there for you and you learned from this relationship.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|mF0L5jMNaa	This guy is disrespecting you.  Someone truly in love makes sacrifices for the other partner.  You shouldn't have to tell him twice.  If he doesn't back off on this subject he is telling you that your feelings don't matter to him now or in the future.  <br>  <br>  Have a talk tonight and ask him if he is going to continue pressuring you.  Most men will start making plans for marriage when they realize that "living together" is not an option.<br>  <br>  PS:  Share your credit reports before getting married.|`|AA10139925	I think you need to find out why he's so afraid of the "marriage" issues? Is it the commitment thing, or is there something else going on?  Getting married is a sacred trust that you enter into with someone you love and just living together does not honor that trust.  I don't think living together is testing out marriage, it's just an arrangement.|`|FasxVeohaa	OK so if he has waited for a year to be with you, than he should be able to respect your wishes and wait just a little longer. Tell him that he wants to live together you at least need to get engaged and have a wedding day. Or just get married and than move in together. You need to stand on your own feet and not worry about what other people are going to think it is between you and jesus not the church to judge you.|`|MXGFGBtZaa	Stand up for your faith and principles. He is going to have to accept this if he truly loves you and wants to marry you. Tell him that you want marriage first. Tell him why. Be firm but never use the line "If you loved me you would"<br>  Because that sounds childish. Tell him that you love him. That you want to marry him and live with him. Say you don't want to hurt him and that by being upset he is making things very difficult for you. I doubt he would leave you.|`|bGyVJ6meaa	if he leaves you over something like this, you had a lucky escape.<br>  <br>  stay true to yourself, if you both believe you will be together forever, then there is no problem waiting.|`|8Lmu2kXEaa	well i would just move in. i mean if you want to do it then do it. its your choice. it doesnt matter if you parents or your church judge you, let them who cares?|`|y4w6ybr3aa	I am a strong believer in people living together before they get married. That's when you truly know somebody and if they are right for you.|`|AA10928214	yeah, forget living in sin, you aren't doing that. Just live with him, as long as you are old enough. You prolly won't regret it.|`|qPfhXZw0aa	Why would it be wrong to live together before youre married? Everyone SHOULD live together before they do. Itll show you what it would be like when you are married. Its definatley a good idea!|`|kXVagSmbaa	it's right.. and if he leaves.. then his lost. but its up to you.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=ArVRWk.tNuoE7IQjTgPhqGHsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090223082257AAvtK1A">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  help me please.|`|oDXKYOAvaa	Wakin up with a smilin and a kiss ... Oh ...baby ...  take the doubles ...   triple ...play...ya know what Im talkin about!  wink ...wink...|`|7SwfRs4Uaa	First off, it should be about how you feel, he feels - what you two feel together. If you personally don't believe that living with somebody (nothing more, nothing less) isn't a sin, then that is what you believe and need to follow. I understand that your family matters, their opinion too and I am not saying it shouldn't. BUT, you cannot live your life through them is what I am saying. <br>  On another note, although he desperately wants to marry you and let says you do decide you don't want to move in together just yet. He too needs to understand where you are coming from. And if you are his one and only, then he needs to show he is there for you... regardless.|`|9BsyKN9haa	First of all if you want to then do it. You can't be scared of your parents forever! they lead their own lives and now its time for you to. NOW, if you personally feel uncomfortable then that's a different thing all together! Its a pretty big deal to live with someone and things can easily go wrong. I would think long and hard about what you want and leave what he and your parents want out of it. If you want to, go ahead, but be careful. If you don't want to them he needs to respect that and since he is the one then there should be no problem with him respecting your choice! Good luck!|`|APy56tkZaa	If he truly loves you & wants to be with you all his life then he needs to meet you halfway here.<br>  Why not begin marriage preparations & announce your engagement.<br>  But remember, "the cow isn't as valuable if she gives out free milk".<br>  <br>  I had an ex who rushed me into living together & marriage.<br>  From my point of view, if you are together without any doubt then there is no reason to rush things along.<br>  <br>  If he makes you to believe he will move on if you don't move in, I don't think that this is the man you want to be obligated to for the rest of your life.|`|O8TA4tMGaa	The key question is this: what do you want and what do you believe in?<br>  <br>  Making life decisions based on what other people feel, think, or would try to shame/blame/guilt you for is not trusting your inner wisdom.  Only you know what you truly desire and need in your life.  The first question to ask yourself is this: Do I want to live with my boyfriend or do I want our relationship to take a different turn where we get engaged, get married and then live together?  That is not a joint decision.  If he was uncomfortable with the idea of moving in with you and wanted to wait until you two got married, would you get upset with him and demand that he move in with you?  I don't think so.  I think you would love him enough to respect his decision and work towards setting a wedding date and getting married rather than throwing a fit because you can't have what you want right now.<br>  <br>  Love is about mutual understanding and respect.  This decision is  not about what other people think and if you make a decision based on other people's opinion, what you're really saying to them is, "What you think of me is more important than what I think of myself."<br>  <br>  I firmly believe that you need to choose you on this issue and go with the decision that feels right to you, no matter what anybody else thinks.  No one has the right to judge you or tell you how to live... unless you give them that right by turning the controls of your life over to other people's opinions.<br>  <br>  Remember: this is about you.  Don't let other people's personal opinions affect what you know is right for you.  <br>  <br>  I wish you all the best!<br>  <br>  P.S. If telling your boyfriend what you want out of a relationship causes him to get so annoyed that he threatens to leave you, let him.  You can do much better.
hTsljlkEaa	I had this same problem, but with someone from a new school moving to our class. We had never met before, and we INSTANTLY bonded, and became best friends. I have now found out, that if you and her have a really close relationship, then she may appear to be flirting, when actually you are both just extremely comfortable around each other. You should ask her out for a coffee sometime, as a friend at first, and then let things develop, If you want that.|`|kMfHWDVMaa	I personally think that this girl you are talking about is into you, because what girl puts her head on your shoulder and be around you a lot for fun? :P Ask her and maybe your friends to a group movie and see if she sits next to you and if so see if she presses her leg against yours. :)
8IfePMa3aa	Those people don't deserve to be trusted. They may claim they're not going to do it again, but they will because it's in their nature to do so.<br>  Exes are exes for a reason; it's dumb to take them back.|`|60b0d42c3c92dec6d976704c90ee8eb5aa	They do say a Leopard never changes his spots, but yes, very occasionally, they do.<br>  <br>  But....<br>  It usually takes a pretty dramatic happening or trauma to do this  - like a person might `change` if something that happens to him makes him really appreciate what he once had, and has lost.<br>  <br>  This is why some divorced couples get married again.<br>  You never know what you have til it`s gone.|`|62bdfaff99eb94891a0098fdd62fe168aa	no oe else can answer if you can trust again - that is your for your heart to answer.<br>  But you would be advised to be sure that the reasons that lead to the breech of trust are no longer present|`|vlCWp7sSaa	Usually when a relationship has ended, it is difficult to start it back up again without having problems. My best advice is to try and figure things out with him. Ask him why he lied to you, and try to compromise on the mistakes that have been made and how to prevent it from happening again. If he starts to have an attitude about it, or continues to lie, it may not be best to go back out without him.Your heart might be broken again.<br>  <br>  Good Luck,<br>  Addy|`|vjijiJT3aa	it depends on what he lies about, can't give you a personal response without knowing the lies.|`|goe3y4FPaa	sounds like u need some of rick.. in ur life.. me.. im there for my ladys wheter we hot or not.. im gonna be there till we die.. feel me lil mama.. evryone is different..|`|PKf6vYk6aa	im all for second chances. but trust is like a mirror. once its broken it can never really be put back the same. however, it is possible to just wipe the slate clean and start over. i think being with someone for 4 years is a good enough reason to try again, how could you not. it is possible to trust again, it can just take a while.|`|opT8Uc8Paa	no matter what people say....people change. its repairable! it is..really! <br>  but college is a tough time for guys (and girls). its the same for when people say you shouldn't bring your boyfriend to college as in old news. you meet new and different people but if he means it when he says he thinks about you then i would see where it goes.|`|DnCpBjPDaa	Once someone breaks your trust they ALWAYS have to earn it back.

He can't have his cake and eat it too b/c he would end up hurting you again.|`|VZ14JElBaa	You can trust him, but be cautious|`|6mbHpl1Gaa	Well I guess it really depends on what he lied to you about.

Good luck|`|8RCANzJvaa	of course.<br>  dont get me wrong, its a long hard road to earn someones trust back. <br>  its even longer and even harder for you to put whatever happened behind you. it should be a turning point in the relationship -- almost like if you want it to work out that bad and he feels the same way, why not give it another shot? things are gonna be tough... gonna be different for the first little while.. maybe  even a few months.<br>  <br>  but its all worth it if you both truly want this.<br>  <br>  my bf and i recently had a fight, and i lost quite a bit of trust on it. I didnt think it warranted a break, but he certainly did.. he wanted a month. took him two days to realize, wtf is he doing, he wants this too badly. I couldnt trust him at all that week i was so skeptical about everything he said, did, wondering if there was a secret underhanded meaning to it or something.<br>  <br>  i still find it hard to trust him with the computer (thats what the fight was over... porn...)<br>  <br>  but im getting there.<br>  <br>  and its only been two weeks since the fight. you guys grew closer than he and i are atm, youve been with him for 4 years. you know him better than anyone else, and he knows you better than anyone else. if you can last 4 years, you can last forever.<br>  <br>  good luck hun, its gonna be hard. but remember its worth it.<br>  <br>   I have a tattoo on my left wrist to remind me of what i need to know in tough times like this (trying to trust again.) its really working for me. It says, "embrace the small things"<br>  every time you think , omg this isnt working, remember that. its the small things that help. bring a smile to your face.<br>  <br>  atleast its something right?|`|Di6FAQxRaa	I think you should leave the past where  it is. Today is a new day, he knows why you broke up with him, so he probable has changed. You can trust him again if he proves to you that he wont do it again. It is hard to tell when someone is lyingg. Does he want you back and is he willing to change and stop his lying ways? Then get back with him if you guys both want to be together, but tell him why you left him, and also let him know that you will dump him again if he lies even once. I had theSamee problem, and i still cant trust the guy because idon'tt know if hes telling the truth or not, so its just a temporary thing for now.

I kind of know what you're going through - on a smaller level though. You want to tear down this wall that you never felt could come between you too. But in a sense your hands are tied because although you can do things to TRY to make her feel better, in the end, if she isn't feeling it too, then it's a no-go. You can't change, fix or go back on the past. It's done and thus far this is what has happened between you to.<br>  <br>  I think you need to sit and REALLY, really examine how you feel. If you think you can put this resenment 120% behind you - then there is a chance. The next is to show her. NOT corner her or give too much. But be who you are - before all of that happened - if you can. It should smooth itself over. Give her time, ease into it and don't force it to happen quicker. Good luck.|`|mXTn7fGRaa	wow...  always be of good cheer no matter the situation okay??!... lean not onto ur own understanding... sometimes "right now" is not the right time... remember that Everything happens for a reason and that (and here's a known but unapplied secret) Life is a Test.

KnTrvQd6aa	Unlike Dr., Sir, or Rev, titles like Mr., Mrs., Ms., have no legal standing at all; they're purely social conventions.<br>  <br>  Your friend may use any, or none, of those he wishes, whether he's married or not.<br>  <br>  It might be useful to point out that it isn't necessary for him to have ANY medical treatment to obtain a GRC; all that is necessary is for him to provide documentary evidence (which usually includes a medical statement confirming a diagnosis of transsexualism) that he has been 'living in his acquired gender' for at least two years, and make a Statutory Declaration that he intends to continue to do so for the rest of his life (When the GRA was enacted, it was created in this way at least in part because of the limitations of surgery for trans men). So he can, if he wishes (and assuming he's eligible), get a GRC, change his birth certificate, and enter into a Civil Partnership without the necessity to go through a marriage, and then have it declared void.<br>  It's just something to think about...|`|AA11706291	If he has legally changed his name by deed poll then he can keep the title Mr however on the paperwork for getting married he will be Mrs. If he wants to change his name to his partners name he would have to change it again by deed poll I believe.<br>  <br>  In order to get the Gender Recognition Certificate I believe they may have to divorce before then obviously remarry under a civil partnership.

The Mr. can be used after the certificate is issued.  This is very strange.  It used to be that people didn't "need" a piece of paper to prove ones love for another but, now, not only do homosexuals want that same piece of paper, some people actually have to have a certificate stating their sex or (as some like to call it) gender.

7HVsVspOaa	Many states have a congregational requirement. This is why so many marriages performed by internet ordained officiants have been over turned. I would ask at the same place where your license will be obtained if it is legal in your state. Where I live the clerk tells you to ask your lawyer. This is a huge red flag. Some states allow notaries to perform ceremonies. If that is the case in AZ I would have him take the test. Better safe than sorry. The other thing you can do is sign the license at the courthouse and then let him do your public ceremony.|`|88234fa7f47e6fd5bb301672de45093eaa	Actually, very few states require that you have a congregation in order to be recognized as a person able to perform a marriage ceremony (I believe they are only New York and Pennsylvania).  Congregational requirements come into play when looking at tax-exempt status, but not at legal ability to perform religious ceremonies.<br>  <br>  Here's a link to a summary of marriage laws in Arizona: <a href="http://usmarriagelaws.com/search/united_states/arizona/index.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://usmarriagelaws.com/search/united_...</a>  While it doesn't specifically say if on-line ordinations are recognized, almost all states/counties accept them due to issues of separation of church and state (the state cannot determine the parameters or validity of your religious beliefs, or spiritual adviser).  My sister-in-law got ordained in Illinois to perform our ceremony, and it's absolutely legal here (I sent an e-mail to the marriage bureau and got it back in writing that she could legally perform our wedding).  A friend of mine is also ordained on-line and has performed weddings in Illinois, California and Minnesota (and perhaps other states).  Double-check with the agency that issues marriage licenses, but I'm pretty darned sure your friend can perform the ceremony (without a JOP or anyone else to witness it or deliver the vows).|`|AA11380378	Being ordained to become a minister and having a licensed in your state to perform marriages are two different things.<br>  <br>  You have to ask him or ask your town hall whether or not your friend is a legistered and licenced officiant in the state of Arizona, otherwise it wouldn't be legal.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|JtEBaOdjaa	Check with the courthouse.  In some places an online ordainment is enough. In other places it isn't.<br>  Technically speaking ANYONE can perform a wedding, ordainment or not.  You just need a judge or JOP to witness the event. (and sign the marriage license accordingly) Also, the vows must be administered by the judge (or JOP).  That is the only part of the ceremony that is a legality.  Your 4 year old niece could do the rest if you wanted.
GYuYGWVeaa	dont think about it. Your stressing out. For a teenager like your age should stay relaxed. If your mom does not have any medical concerns she will be fine, and if she does she should get her treatment soon as possible. Age 50 is not a big deal, she still has a long life to look into. :D|`|ccs5VkRgaa	Well i don't know if you a religious person!<br>  But something important that Jesus did here in earth is that he gave us comfort and hope using the bible! Everyone actually has gone through the experience of losing someone they love. But thing the is how are we going to cope with it? What are we suppose to do? Whatever happens to your mom remember what Jesus said in John 5:28,29(read it) Jesus promised there was going to be a resurrection! The bible also says hold on to God and he wont let you go, trust him and he will help you! (2Corinthians 1:3) I tell you this coming from the bible because its the reality, the only one that can help you is God because he can give you the strength you need to carry on!<br>  Enjoy the time you have with your mom! Think positive think of the hope that everyone one haves that God promises, and tell her the same thing. Hope this can help!|`|De1tOxHXaa	just enjoy your present each and every movement with her,because we don't know of death and don't worry about the future, make your that much stronger than you don't have to take care of it..|`|srAP6Vzvaa	stay strong. this is the modern age. people live till their 70's or 80's. don't worry about things you have no control over. she's going to be fine.|`|rOW9BPnZaa	I'm sixteen and my dad's 56, my mum's 54.<br>  I'm not worried and neither should you be, people live until their 80's.<br>  Calm down and don't stress, it's ok to be protective but it will mess with you x

We have 1 kid and I have noticed no difference in the amount, still once a month if I am lucky.<br>  5. I obviously wish for more.<br>  <br>  Let's put it this way, if I knew then what I knew now I would not have married.  Women tend to lose interest in sex, that is according to many many guys I know and from seeing all the griping on yahoo answers.  In my view a man needs sex to feel close to his wife, obviously there are exceptions especially since you are only 23.  I believe if a guy does not want sex with you he is cheating on you or there is something wrong with him physically.

In the beginning it was quite different.  <br>   <br>  Throwing a child into the mix will definatly changes things. Thats part of the reason for lack of enthusiasm.

Eventually the desire to have sex does diminish, and you may find yourself in a position where you 2 have nothing, or very little in common. When baby comes, sex will also diminish, the child will need attentive care resulting in fatigue and tiredness as you 2 get used to being parents. Once the last child of your brood is old enough to take care of themselves in the way of brushing teeth, homework, lunches, that sort of thing, then after a recovery period of what can be some years, the drive should return.<br>  <br>   Never base a relationship on sex only, you will definitely hit disaster. Of course he can`t keep up to your drive, he is in his 40`s! So am I, but 2 - 3 times a week is plenty enough, if all I thought about was sex, then I`d get a hobby or do something to not become obsessed with sex.|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	How long you've been in your relationship? since Nov 06<br>  -How old either of you are?  he is 40 I am older<br>  -How often you have sex?  when ever I see him, twice each time unless he stays over then its three times (morning)<br>  -If you have kids, how much has it affected how often you have sex?

I am 58 my wife is 37, we have sex one or two time a week, but we do try to have a date night twice a month and that usually results in several sessions of sex.  We have seven children, two of the oldest no longer live at home, the youngest is almost five, and children do cause some issues with sex, being quite, locking doors, etc.  We would both love to have the time to have more sex, but the key word is time.  We are very happy.<br>  You need to realize that he is on the down side of his sexual peak and your on the upside of yours.  It will only cause problems, if you do not tell him your needs and desires.  He will do whatever to keep you happy so just talk to him.  Good luck and congratulations on the up coming birth of your baby.
UhWQuxLVaa	just keep playen it cool 4 now & see what happens|`|K8j3ufTSaa	I don't think that is immature at all. You seem like you are being thoughtful about this relationship (whatever it is) and that is beyond your years. One month is a bit early, I think, to start talking about a long term relationship, HOWEVER, I would confirm with him that you two are exclusive. This is for your health, and will not look clingy. And until you are both absolutely not seeing other people, always use a condom! <br>  note..if he is seeing other people, and not willing to only date you, I would consider how that would make you feel. Always be good to your heart. Best of luck!|`|JizwgEiYaa	You could just plainly ask him if he would date other girls or is exclusive to you.|`|qroOTyrGaa	If you have talked to him about it before and he remains adamant about not putting a title on your relationship then that means that you need to start exploring other options. Men do this if they want to keep their options open and look around for other girls while you sit at home pining over him. It's very convenient for him, but where does that leave you? If a guy has feeling for you he shows it, and he can't bare the thought of you not being his. Women being complicated always assume a much more complicated version of why he is not 100% committed to you but the truth of the matter is men are simple creatures and if they're into you they're into you, if they're not they don't make an effort. Put everything out on the table very blatantly without sounding needy and if he wants your relationship  to stay the same without evolving then it's over.|`|qRDHEGHJaa	lol im 24 my husband will be 28 to. well just ask him what he think of your guys relationship.

"<br>  <br>  this is not immature at all!<br>  trust me (:|`|4HoVVCenaa	Communicate.|`|8vfCRg7Caa	there are plenty of reasons people dont want a commitment. and you havent really said his reason. Maybe you need to get his reason for not wanting to have a commitment and if it doesnt convince you, then move. Convincing for some people would mean, hes working on his doctors degree, becoming a lawyer, in school has a 40 hour a week job and doesnt have much time. Either way, convinced or not, if its not what you want leave. Too many people like something they cant have when they let somebody else i likes them even more than the person they cant have, get away. The endless cycle of love is never fair.

Nc7clhzIaa	You may be coming on too strong.  Also, make sure you are chewing gum.  This is no offense to you, b/c I don't know, but just make sure your breath is ok first.  Then I would join the conversation when I felt there was a relevant moment, then maybe ask what he thinks about that.  That way it is an open ended question to give his opinion & you can see what he is like.  You know, learn things about him.  Do not try to stalk him regardless.  No one deserves that.   Guys like girls who don't complain, like things they like (ex. guitar, sports, cars, art) girls who like to laugh & are open minded to what they want to do.  That is a good way to get guy/girl friends.  You can always get a bf later.  You gotta become good friends with the guy first to get to know him & make sure ya'll are compatible ya know.  Most guys will come after you.  1. Fresh Breath 2. Smile 3. Laugh @ their corny jokes 4.Go places or do things with them that they like(but don't get too intimate) 5.  Just be their friend & some guy will come around & swoop you up!|`|BQ7P9QvBaa	ask him what's on your mind. You can get the answers you need to change what you are doing and start a good conversation!|`|F8t4fAm1aa	try to make sure you dont spit while talking and check if your mouth smells good,maybe he's avoiding bad breath and maybe try not to look him in the eyes while talking|`|zfbjAD0Gaa	Well, I am 14 too. Maybe the  guy is afraid of you. Some guys avoid younger girls because they're supposedly "jail bait"|`|34ikhhtMaa	You have to realize that guys send mixed signals all the time. Like one day they are n to u and the next they aren't. I am 17 and I know what you are talkin about, but as you get older guys will mature and you will find a guy who is right for u. My advice is just don't worry about it and go on like u can live with or without him. Guys like mystery so don't always talk to him. He will notice and think is she with someone else(they like competition) so just be yourself and do your thing(lol). Good LUCK!!<br>  <br>  JAMIE|`|MGOFjVnVaa	maybe you should begin to be more reserved. keep your<br>  distance, be friendly, hard to get in other words.<br>  girl like that are much more attractive to boys than those<br>  who chase them.|`|CUUjvakpaa	well just be yourself|`|Ww7CyyALaa	The way he is acting is making me think he might have a small crush on you and just shy to say it. So you should be your self around him and make the first move by telling him that you have a crush on him|`|goe3y4FPaa	u said it seems.. u have to accept.. guys are guys.. and girls are girls.. evryone is always gonna have there own opinions.. u cant make someone.. what u want.. u have to learn to accept guys for who they are and live with it..|`|mF0L5jMNaa	Just stick to pleasant greetings.  Don't ask questions.  "Good morning, hope you're doing well".  Next move is his.  Don't stalk, don't press.  Why be with someone who doesn't want to talk to you!|`|pWxhivTIaa	time to find someone else -- look around, SOME boy likes you
q0b6uPCraa	Yeah, have some fun. Post videos on YouTube, you could have a awesome carrear ahead. Just one thing.. DO NOT THINK OF A NAFF NAME!<br>  <br>  Good luck! x<br>  Discuss the name between you and make sure you are sure. Find a place to practice (I suggest someones garage!) and Voila!|`|sr0vZPQqaa	Yes why not.
AA10086844	I love Maggie dresses.  I really don't think that she has made one that isn't gorgeous!<br>  <br>  Good luck and congratulations!!!|`|AkUhaMm9aa	the dress is nice...i dont think there is such a thing as an ugly wedding dress..but it has to look good on you..that's all that matters..you could have simple dress and if your body can work it then it would look amazing...i realized that at the store when i tried on dresses for the first time...<br>  <br>  some dresses looked so good online but when i got to the store..they looked ok on me...the one i wasn't so crazy about..was the most flattering....so you never know...<br>  <br>  just ask for opinion of people you know..they have to see you wearing it and they will be able to tell you...im sure it looks great..|`|IbhX8kHxaa	This has got to be one of the prettiest dresses I've ever seen!! I bet you're going to look like a princess walking down the aisle to the man of your dreams! You might even make him cry! :o)<br>  Did you buy it white? What's your hair going to look like?<br>  What ever you decide I bet it'll be beautiful!!<br>  <br>  Congratulations and God Bless your marriage!! Go on and feel confident!!|`|YbwDFvEaaa	It's beautiful! <br>  <br>  A friend of mine was married this past October and her dress had similar layering on the skirt and train. We feared it would be too much when she showed us the picture, but in person it looked absolutely stunning.<br>  <br>  Congrats and Happy Wedding!|`|di6p10Ifaa	I absolutely love it. My gown looks very similar to this but the pickups are more pillowy. My gown is also in ivory with champagne accents. But wow this gown is really gorgeous, how can you go wrong with a Maggie??|`|a3422bad6666b60894e80bace0f14387aa	Definitely not my taste but if you like it, that's what matters. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|geJM58L2aa	That dress is absolutely gorgeous.  You'll look beautiful on your day :)  I'm jealous.. my husband and I got married in a tiny chapel on a spur of the moment type thing so I never got to wear a white princess dress :(|`|xuiSfzgraa	I absolutely LOVE that dress....I am wearing a similar dress to that one for my wedding....I am sure you are going to make a very beautiful bride in that!!  Congrats!|`|WNLv9m9Naa	omg I like this dress so much I went to a wedding store a couple days ago with my friend and she tried this same style on its very popular I bet you will look amazing in it! Best of wishes on your big day:)|`|3Ks21ASDaa	GORGEOUS!|`|ODR1Woxyaa	wow looks amazing|`|cgQqHJtKaa	It is incredibly gorgeous. Looks like it costs a bundle too!|`|wWzK6eJaaa	That dress is AMAZING....Love iTTT :-)|`|mbu5LD02aa	I love it its very nice <br>  <br>  ps. Congrats|`|IHwMbLX5aa	Wow... looks alot like my Maggie dress... So I love it! lol.|`|2rCZbaEIaa	very beautiful....not my style at all  but still stunning|`|oeXnhiPWaa	Though I can't imagine wearing it myself (but then I can't imagine myself ever needing a dress that fancy) it is rather stunning.|`|7iIh5QmOaa	i think it is gorgeous. and congrats on the wedding. very beautiful looks something like what i am looking for.  plus thanks for points!!|`|UAF8Zxzaaa	Pretty good. I love all the tapering on the bottom of the dress. The top isn't my cup of tea but it is lovely overall.|`|FnjudRI5aa	Love it!!  Very Gorgeous!!|`|lYZ71zYAaa	Beautiful  I love Maggie Sottero dresses.|`|gpL7W3jAaa	Wow...beautiful. Congrats.<br>  <br>  P.S. I got a Maggie dress too!

Congratulations.|`|4Jihn5Kqaa	beautiful :)|`|DUPOEk1daa	I love the pickup skirt. Mine has one too!!|`|p5CrZ5Bwaa	That's really pretty...It looked like it was super long and it was georgous|`|n1IIUQAEaa	Thats a nice dress|`|7r1rmQZzaa	OH MY GOD! That dress is BEAUTIFUL! I would LOVE to wear a dress like that in my wedding!!!|`|FpG0sxIKaa	it is nice|`|hkwBR1moaa	It's pretty.  I'm not a fan of the gathered skirt or strapless but it is pretty.  I also think that style is way overdone right now.  Nothing original about it.  But again, it is pretty and if that's the look you like, then go for it.|`|3SSVBJAqaa	Sorry, but the pick-up style is tacky, in my opinion. I do not like it and your photos will look extremely dated.|`|OIJ3JBkSaa	well you are going to be the prettiest bride!  i love the beading and embroidery on the bodice and it carries through around the back of the dress which some gowns don't have. it appears as though it is well structured and will keep its shape and your shape through out the day. quite often you see gowns that aren't made well enough to keep their shape all day and as the day wears on the dress begins to droop. this one doesn't appear as though it will!  <br>  i love the way it snugs to the waist will really accentuate your bust as well as your waistline!  its hard to tell but i think it looks as though the everywhere the skirt is gathered it is finished with some beading.  very very pretty sweetie - great choice!<br>  wishing you the perfect wedding day!|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	Its ok personally I dont like pickups they look tatty.|`|CdTe8MO4aa	very cool it makes her look very tall<br>  :)|`|0Id85yiYaa	it's big|`|JtEBaOdjaa	Honestly? The skirt looks like drapery to me.  I hate rouching or pick ups or whatever those ugly things are called.  I have never liked these dresses.<br>  <br>  That being said, if you love it and feel beautiful in it then it's the perfect gown. And I'm so happy that you found your perfect gown:D|`|PdaiyUkDaa	very very very  nice  just the type i  would  pick i hate the ones that look like giant marshmellows|`|GvamTVqAaa	beautiful :)  Congrats!|`|gwindStOaa	beautiful! I love maggie dresses too!|`|u4910BFfaa	Very pretty.  Good luck!|`|EjyD1sXeaa	stunning, classy and gorgeous|`|JKYyDpOkaa	OMG! its like freaking beautiful :)|`|AA11380378	Are people still wearing pick-up styles? <br>  <br>  Yuck!

IPS3hWweaa	It depends on how big of a lie it was. If it was something that was said as a joke and the guy took you seriously and thinks it was the truth when you were just joking all along, then it's easy to forgive.|`|e55d4a01420a2827c4108baf10b7d77daa	What's the lie? Is it something like "Your shirt looks nice" or draining his bank account and lying about it?|`|KHtf2pDKaa	i agree with ryan.depends on the serverity.but if was done accidently i wouldnt pay too much attention to it.but it all depends.if i really loved and she loved me i would probably give it a shot|`|KFUsmwItaa	Depends on the size of the lie and what the lie was about.|`|901120d48dfc056c97f7f7ab6c44bd38aa	you shouldnt lie period. how can you unintentionally lie to someone?|`|boh5rCNlaa	if she was hot|`|W20KslFzaa	Depends on the motivation for the lie, and what it was about.  If you're lying to try to manipulate someone that's bad.  If you're lying to protect someone about something that really doesn't effect the person you're lying too, then that can be OK.<br>  I've been lied to, and I've been a liar myself.  It's human nature, and sometimes you can't help it and feel trapped by your lie.  Then need to lie to continue covering for the first lie.<br>  If you came clean, and there was a good reason behind it, then the other person should be able to understand.  They may not trust you as much as before for a while, but it's up to you to earn that trust back.  <br>  It's when lying becomes a habbit, rather than a rare thing, that's when I give up.  <br>  But again, the reason behind the lie, to me, is more important than the lie  (provided like you said, it wasn't cheating)|`|rJPHe9hvaa	it depends on the severity of the lie. a tiny little white lie? maybe that could be worked on. otherwise? probably not.
p1gzHgAraa	so he wants to divorce you, to see if he can fall in love with you all over again? im not trying to sound rude at all-but this is the weirdest excuse for a divorce i have EVER heard! <br>  <br>  if he wants a divorce, then he needs to move out (thats the first step). once he moves out, file for separation then for divorce-since thats what he wants. but please, do not wait for him to just fall in love again! it seems to me he doesnt really know what he wants-but i think that having him move out is a step in the right direction.. my guess is he will realize once he has moved out whether he made a big mistake, or if he feels that he needs to go forward with divorce..<br>  <br>  my heart goes out to you-i bet you are really confused and hurt. but just let him go- and just see what happens-but dont beg him to come back, and dont wait for him, you have a life too.. and you need to concentrate on yourself at that time and see what YOU want! best of luck to you! Mel|`|DTZmqnCkaa	Sounds like a very creative plan to me IF your marriage is truly damaged at the foundation.  Anything is worth a shot if the marriage is failing and the 2 people agree that they love each other.|`|B12E4rYiaa	Why not have a trial separation instead of a divorce this is much easier than going through divorce proceedings. You need to be in counseling and do everything you can there before you do the last resort which is divorce.|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	I think he's lost his mind! I would never agree to that. If he is unsure, he should get counseling to help him decide. Divorcing and saying you MIGHT get back together is just crazy.<br>  <br>  Tell him to seek counseling before anything else. And then, if he still can't make up his mind, do it for him-and kick him to the curb.|`|tsBL19qzaa	Always being together isn't a good thing. <br>  <br>  I think that if he wants a divorce, you let him know that it's over with. You can fix your problems while you are married if he really wants to. But, I see this as ploy to keep you around, just in case whatever he is doing doesn't work out. <br>  <br>  Give him the ultimatum: divorce and it's over with or we work out our problems while we are still married.<br>  <br>  Why waste time with his game playing?|`|e276df96c55a338c1e69a8869d0cd199aa	Your marriage is over.  If he had real intention of working it out, he'd be suggesting marriage counseling not a divorce.|`|K8OjmMUAaa	Well I agree with the people who know him...obviously he doesn't want to leave you forever. I think that he'll probably come back during the separation as well. It sounds like he's thought out his plan pretty well...although, it's not a very practical one. You're talking about a LOT of money going to waste, what with the marriage you already have, his moving out, a divorce, and then a possible remarriage and him moving BACK in. Not to mention all the wasted time. If it were me, personally I'd just let him go and get on with my OWN life instead of letting him waste all the money and time he wants to, but that's just me. I do think that he'll come back during the separation, though. I think that maybe you s hould look into getting some counseling, if he's worried about your foundation, before he wastes all that money?|`|rqNb6FIraa	Seperation (no matter what excuse is being made for it) is leaving. Things have come between you two and that can be hard and he might really want to start over fresh. but, from what you've told me it seems more like he wants to take a break from you and see if there's anything he wants more than you. It's not fair to you and you need to call him out on it and prove to him that this is either the makings of a permanent divorce (in which case he should just come out and admit it) or just temporary poor judgment. Get the truth before you let yourself get caught up in his words about doing this for you.|`|y4w6ybr3aa	I think he his being very selfish and if he loves you then he wouldn't chance losing you.<br>  Do not be a fool, if he leaves do not give him the satisfaction of knowing you will wait around for him when ever he feels like being single.|`|zMg4hQwDaa	divorce is it, he is trying to get you to go easy on him with the expectation the if your a good little girl you might get lucky and get him back. Leave him now, and totally forget him. He is not coming back.|`|sr0vZPQqaa	Take the divorce and tell him you are not hanging around for him but are going to get out there and have some fun. Who does he think he is!|`|scnW0Wzeaa	Move on ,He had his chance for greatness. He blew it.|`|ky82orBzaa	ask yourself if you love him enough to do it again sounds like its over but you only know that in your heart|`|2YX18RE2aa	What a load of bull crap.<br>  <br>  If he needs a separation to determine he wants to be married, show him the door.<br>  Make sure he understands that it DOES NOT swing both ways.<br>  <br>  Separation is not the method to rebuild a relationship it is the method of shutting one down.<br>  <br>  He does not want to hurt you? How do you accept that "Honey, I want to move out for a year and a half to make sure I really love you. While I'm gone you just sit here and do not date or anything just stay faithful while I leave and find out if life is more fun without you." This is not supposed to hurt?<br>  What a load of Bull Crap.<br>  <br>  This sounds like a not so very well veiled attempt to go bang other women for a year with you waiting for his return if he does not find anything better.<br>  <br>  I think I would point out to the immature jerk off, that if he wants to consider staying together he will attend marriage therapy with you and will attempt to stay in the house and work on the marriage instead of running away to sow his wild oats. Less that effort he is welcome to hit the road but do not expect to return.<br>  <br>  The long and short of this is that separation is the LAST step not the first. To just think that there will be less pain with him elsewhere and you wondering what he is thinking is bizarre in itself.<br>  Give him that divorce if he must but there is no return. He must iunderstand that he does not get to hang you out that way.<br>  <br>  Stay or Go, those are his choices. Stay requires therapy to figure out ewwhere he got so far away from reality. Go means all bets are off and you get to find out if there are other guys waiting for someone like you.<br>  <br>  Frankly, I view this guy as either, extreemly immature and out of touch with reality OR he is wondering how much he can get away with while you wait for his return.<br>  <br>  Either way he is not really interested in your well being OR hurt for that matter.|`|Ag8pE3Cyaa	Never heard before such a collection of BS!<br>  <br>  Something is very wrong here. Your husband has a hidden agenda. Not sure what it is but it's definitely not what he says it is. He's gonna get you to divorce him amicably so he gets most of your assets and then he'll disappear. <br>  <br>  Try to be smart, don't be naive. What he says makes NO sense!! <br>  <br>  Tell him if you divorce you will go on with your life and will not be waiting for him! and if you go through with this make sure you get ALL that you are entitled to!|`|fQYU96euaa	There are few reasons for such drastic measure and I hate to say it but he sounds like he wants out but doesnt want to hurt you. He wouldnt be asking for a divorce to later remarry, very costly and not to mention that marriage is about ups and downs...more downs then ups to be honest and its how you work through those bad times that makes or breaks a marriage, you dont divorce to rebuild your marriage, you divorce because you no longer love your spouse and nothing can save it.<br>  If he wants a divorce then give it to him but dont wait around for him, move on with your life and let him know he blew it.
tCiVuFK9aa	I am sure that you are not the only one who has already labeled your friend a gossip.  And good for you that you know this about her and won't be telling her anything personal again.<br>  <br>  You may not be able to stop her gossiping but you can get her to stop telling you things about others.  Next time she starts just tell her up front that you really don't want to talk about other people and what they are doing.  And when she says "she told me not to tell anyone but"  just say then don't.  If you won't allow her to carry gossip to you then she may stop.  At least she will stop with you and you don't have to hear the negative things about others.  I'm like you, I really don't like gossip and most of the time it is not completely true.<br>  Red|`|NTUr0t3haa	Refuse to listen to her. Interrupt her, cut her off, and even get up and leave if you have to. But don't listen to it and be very consistent about that. Right now you're the audience and that's all she cares about. Stop being an audience.|`|Sp1DkZfgaa	well you have to tell your friend that if she keeps gossiping to you, then you just cant be her friend anymore.. and if she is gossiping about your other friends or other people you know, then u gotta tell her u cant be friends unless she stops
gMYoi210aa	well u girls up there are WRONG! i dont brag! i am not like most guys ive been told, u see i have never bragged, about how many chicks ive been with, in fact i dont even like to talk about it|`|BDjBVdtRaa	I hear guys ALL THE TIME bragging about all the girls that they have been with. If us girls did that we would be called a whore or a slut or something. It's stupid. if its so bad for us to do it, then it should be bad for the guys too!|`|8la1kUh3aa	Few people have the audacity to stand up, personally, to ideas like this...|`|LgOOYyXIaa	guys brag! believe me! it goes BOTH ways..
iqh2iDknaa	Sounds like this guy doesn't really know what he wants. However, he seems to be more or less a nice guy (he is not out just for sex) and you need to be more up front with him about how you feel. I think he might be unsure of whether you like him all that much.|`|ml0lgKVSaa	I sorry to say this but it sounds like he just wants to get some. and if he is kissing other girls.... definatly a player, and i wouldnt waste my time, i can tell you that if a guy is doing that and you think he likes you your WAY to good for him. find someone else.|`|QCa4Pffqaa	yeah he just wants sex.|`|hkl6Zz2zaa	he just wants some like all the other guys|`|aZ1ZxTNvaa	yeah <br>  sorry honey<br>  but he jsut wants u in bed|`|tuXBPrjsaa	yeah he just wants some ***. guaranteed|`|n9HAc3H2aa	Young men want to get in your pants.  The sex drive is intense and pushes us to get what we want, and as SOON as that moment occurs, the interest completely fades and we are soon off after another... it is nature I guess.<br>  <br>  After 40 or so, the drive fades a bit, and it is easier to stay with one woman.|`|Hm0bCjYFaa	It doesn't sound like he knows who he likes|`|OyWVqe23aa	flash him.|`|Lt03NhXPaa	well he probably is really into you or he may just want some who knows|`|fPx4lwofaa	i can't really answer that question, no one but the guy in question knows the answer to that. it sounds like he might, but guys are pretty slick. i would just be cautious, don't get your feelings to mixed up into it. wait and see if he tries to get ahold of you, if you have mutual friends, and he didn't get your number, he could try getting ahold of you through them. anyway, just take it slow and remember that you did see him kissing someone else, (who was drunk),even though you aren't together that should tell you something about the type of person he is, good luck

Shy people sometimes come across rude, so she's probably trying her best not to seem that way.

You need to let her know that you don't want to push her into anything, and that you enjoy being with her.

If you are in your teens this is a very common statement.  When you are a teen even YOU don't know who you are and where you are going in life.  Many people are confused until they finish college and get their career established.   I mean look...when you are a kid you want to be a dancer and fireman and a doctor and then a baseball player....you are learning.  How can anyone understand who you are until you ESTABLISH who you are?<br>  <br>   It is a dog eat dog world out there and you try to find bits and pieces of your life with the people you are with.  You are learning about life through them...through the experiences you have with them.  You gain wisdom and experience ....but that doesn't mean it gets easier.  You just THINK YOU KNOW who are by the time you are in your mid to late 20's.  You have a good foundation that will still continually change though.<br>  <br>  Your family and friends are along for the ride.  They can't tell you the future and tell you who you are because next week you will have a new crush or a new best place to go..or a new idea or a new hobby....you are all over the place.<br>  <br>  Don't be so hard on everyone.  They might understand you more than you think you they do.  They know you are growing up and things will change.  They are waiting for the final outcome which will never come.  So just keep talking about them and you and voice your opinions and they will know where you are.  Keep an open mind though as you can never learn anything about life and the truth if you are closed minded with blinders on and tunnel vision.<br>  <br>  Hint....you are never done growing...so it is up to you to be more consistent with your thoughts and beliefs and that only comes with age.  When you are young...you are changing what you think all the time.  When I was 30 I swore I would never change my mind about some thing...and you know what????   I am TOTALLY 100 percent different from who I was then.  I am 61 and still changing.|`|fwbKoLEYaa	Well, a lot of it depends on your age.. you have an obligation to listen to your parents if your still young.

I doubt they're your fault, unless there's some significant part of the story you left out where you committed some horrible offense. <br>  I'd stay away from him - I wouldn't want him to get angry for no reason and physically lash out at you.<br>  <br>  Just give him some space. If he values your friendship, he'll come to you. If he doesn't come to you, he's sorting out his problems or wallowing in them.|`|NTUr0t3haa	It doesn't matter why he does it. What matters is that you're still interacting with him despite his hostility. Maybe you want to win him over.

Unfortunately you can't really crawl inside his brain and see what his problem is towards you and to tell you the truth HE may not even know.  I don't know the exact situation as far as if you dated in the past or if he liked you and felt rejected by you.  You may be popular and he may have sterotyped you as a "b**ch for that...there are so many reasons.  From personal experience, I would just ignore him.  Don't reach out to him, don't ask him questions, don't try to be overly nice because then he will see that you aren't going to deal with being treated this way.  Then he'll either change or you'll have one less "bad friend" in your life.|`|oQkwZhXpaa	Don't blame yourself, you aren't doing anything wrong by the sounds of it..there are a few reasons he could be doing this..<br>  <br>  Firstly, he could like you, and not want to make a big deal out of it or want you to notice in case you don't like him back, and he doesn't want to dissappoint himself. <br>  <br>  Secondly, he could be having problems at home or with college work or anything, and he may, weird as it sounds, dislike you for being so nice to him, that being disliking the person you are for being so nice even when he is nasty to you. Equally he may dislike himself and want to better himself, and is horrible to other people because he wants to distract attentio away from the person he is.<br>  <br>  I think you should carry on being nice to him, be as nice as you can, mae conversation when you get the chance and give him a few random compliments to help his self esteem. Perhaps if you get to know him well enough he will explain to you why, although remember some people are just naturally more aggressive. Don't worry yourself about it being your fault because odds are its just him trying to find a way to deal with something else, and because your nice and calm, he thinks it easy to take it out on you.<br>  <br>  Have a chat with him, say you'd appreciate it if he wasn't so nasty if things deteriorate more, or even if they stay the way they are. Just talk to him and let him know your there if he wants to talk about anything, and let him know that your concerned and worried that you have done something to upset him. <br>  <br>  Best of Luck :) You'll be fine :)|`|AA10333823	From what you've given, I think you need to talk to him. You're obviously good friends, since you've known each other for 5 years. There may be something going on in his personal life that he hasn't clued you in on or it may actually be something you're doing. You won't know by digging through his stuff or something, which would actually piss him off more. <br>  It could also be entirely sarcastic. Like I said, you won't get much info until you sit down and talk to him about it.<br>  If he doesn't respond to this, or just gets angrier and ignores your request to talk alone, you may just need to distance yourself from him. This sounds like anger could lead to violence and abuse.<br>  Hope this helps!|`|Iqh7U5Ypaa	is he like this with everyone else??<br>  you should ask him why he's a bit angry (or seems it) when he talks to you... <br>  <br>  ask other people and see what they say about his anger and if they hear the same tone in his voice as you do when they speak 2 him. <br>  <br>  maybe he has things going on in his personal life that may be affecting anger?<br>  <br>  ..or he could use us womens excuse and say he's hormonal hehe. <br>  <br>  Hope you find out whats wrong (:|`|iYc1HLmmaa	Well first you might want to ask him about why he's acting in such a jackass manner.<br>  <br>  It could be something going on in his life or maybe you did do something that you didn't notice you did.<br>  <br>  Hm...<br>  It would be best to just ask him first.|`|H2VxdK44aa	just be straight forward with him and ask him, "are you mad at me for something?"

4EWCegiRaa	He sounds like someone who's been hurt you so many times, he's just demoralized about it.  He's over you because he has to be over you because you're impossible.  <br>  <br>  Actually, I think the right term would be that he "made his peace" with you.  It's like when someone dies and you make peace with their death, he's done that with your relationship.  It's over.

Especially the part where he says he was diagnosed with it.<br>  <br>  HPV, usually only affects women. It can actually causes cervical cancer. Men are carriers, but they almost NEVER show sings... the problem is, it shows up between 20 days and two years AND ONLY WOMEN CAN BE DIAGNOSED WITH IT (you can check the CDC website). There is no way your husband could have been diagnosed with it, because there IS NO FDA APROVED HPV test for men! I know this, because I have it and I had to tell my boyfriend. I know ALL the statistic and facts about HPV. The ONLY way a man can know, is if the women they are sleeping with comes up with it.<br>  <br>  Quote STRAIGHT from the CDC website: “Currently, there is no test designed or approved to find HPV in men. The only approved HPV test on the market is for women, for use as part of cervical cancer screening. There is no general test for men or women to check one’s overall “HPV status.” Unless your husband has a cervex and had an abnormal pap test, HE CAN'T GET TESTED FOR HPV.<br>  <br>  Because of this fact, I believe that your husband is lying and cheating on you. He is lying, because you believe it is HIS problem and not yours, what you don’t realize and what your husband isn't telling you,  HPV IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON STDS, IT IS ONLY TRANSMITTED THROUGH SEX, you could have it and you need to get annual pap smears, for at least the next three years, because you could have a strain that causes cancer. I have to get checked every six months because of it.|`|kfSuRisvaa	your family support  will know that's a strange question every deployed service member spouse should know that hope you were not up to no good and trying not to get caught with your hand in the cookie jar|`|4HoVVCenaa	Contact the Red Cross.

IvMPh09baa	trust takes time to gain back once it is lost.  When you lose trust in someone, its not going to take a week to regain it.  Honeslty, you have every right to not trust him.  And thats the main problem here... he has disrespected you and neglected you and lost all of your trust, so don't feel that you need to feel bad for not trusting him.  You are just going with your instinct, its human nature when someone hurts you deeply you protect yourself and no longer trust them.  its completely natural.  <br>  <br>  As far as trusting him again... well thats up to him really.  You don't just give your trust out to anyone, people earn it from you.  But if you don't have it in your heart or there has just been to much crap that has happened that is keeping you from trusting him again... then maybe its time to throw in the towel and find someone that wouldn't betray you so badly.|`|PHYj1UPwaa	The very best thing you can do now..right now..is to find a good God-loving Church..A place to grow and worship and learn the truth of God and His Son...You need to find a group of loving older women that will guide you and be an example to you..Please go to my blog..www.swordofthespirit123.wordpress....

My first husband was so abusive I had to leave because one of us was going to die.  So I met my second husband in the program and we got along really great.  only thing is my husband (boyffriend at the time) always had a hard time connecting with me on a emothional level. Needless to say my husband neglected me for years and even though I loved him (still love him) I told him I needed more from him.  He finally told me that he was not the man for me.  6 months later he decides he wants me back.  I have not been able to get that love that was once there.

I think it's safe to assume "no" you don't have any peace.<br>  I was in the same boat as yourself 2 years ago, I felt I couldn't forgive my Father for abandoning my Mother & I; guess what I forgave him and I AM so at peace with my decision.<br>  <br>  You say that you CAN'T forgive your husband, what you should say is that you WON'T just like you WON'T forgive your parents. You will never "move on" or "put it behind you" or "get over" the abuse you suffered at the hands of your husband or your parents but with forgiveness you do learn to live with it and actually look at all the stuff you went through without that knocking you down but somehow lifting you up! <br>  We all have good life experiences and bad ones right? When you look back at your good experiences it brings a smile to your face right? and then where does that memory go? it goes back into your memories; the same thing with your bad experiences, when you remember one of them they make you sad, they may even put you in a crappy mood but where do they go? they go back into your memories.  We are made up of good and bad!!<br>  <br>  Only you know if you want this marriage to work, you say your husband is trying to change and if he truly makes a change for the better you guys should go to counseling and tell him to woo you all over again like he did when you first fell in love with him; but the first step is to make peace with all the resentment, pain, frustration, abuse you have in your life right now.<br>  <br>  Marriage is extremely hard work, only you know if you want to go through it.|`|IgBCGFeqaa	I personally don't think that you should forgive him it's good that you don't let people mess with you! i think you should try to move on if possible because even if he is trying he still did it in the first place and you never know when he will let loose and do it again! good luck|`|Sr4u5skgaa	Im really sorry to hear all that, but in my opinion i really think you should move on, be brave and live the life that you deserve. <br>  <br>  Its hard to forgive someone when they have been hurting you mentally or pyshically for so many years. However i think the only way that you can move on properly is to forgive them but to forget them. You have to be able to forgive your mum and dad but be able to move on.<br>  <br>  Stop worrying about things in the past, they are in the past for a reason, you still have a future ahead of you, make it a good one!<br>  Good luck with everything x|`|jdRKZe18aa	Only you can say if this is the right road.  If you still have some feeling & committment towards him and believe he is genuinely TRYING to change and the proof will be in his behavior, actions and effort that HE NEEDS to prove he is sticking to.... then remaining with him might just be worth the risk.  BUT past behavior does typically indicate future behavior - so time alone will tell if CHANGE is real & permanent.<br>  <br>  Sounds like you have issues of your own though that need addressing with a professional - so why not SEEK your own help for change while he is going through his own changing?  MAYBE you have a chance of both coming out the other side of this better, stronger and more united.  I SAY breaking up a marriage is always the LAST OPTION and if there remains ANY HOPE of change and fixing and making things better it is worth the time & work.  Especially when you've invested in this relationship and if children are part of the equation.<br>  Make him prove though that he is genuinely changing.....|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	Get a divorce, life is too short to waste in unhappiness and since he will not change, you have to by getting away from him.
IPS3hWweaa	You want a say about what happens with a woman's body? Why? It's not your body. If you want a kid, you can adopt. Leave a woman's right to choose alone.<br>  <br>  Maybe you could talk to her and convince her to carry the baby until birth, but at the end of the day it should still be her choice to make.|`|EPaYoJaiaa	If the guy wants to be the single parent then the guy should have to carry it around for 9 months. Unfortunatley that's not possible.<br>  <br>  I do agree with you that the father should have a little more say in the decision of an abortion. After all, he did help create it. But she is the one carrying the baby around for over half a year and then has to go through hours of labor feeling like she's passing a bowling ball through a golf hole. So she's the one that gets the choice. Is it fair? absolutely not but life isn't fair, and ya just gotta deal.|`|ew3Wl6hKaa	I agree, if the father is ready for the responsability and wants to raise the child than I think he should be given the chance to, it took two to make it and they should both have a say in what they want.<br>  AND it may not be his body but the life growing inside the woman is part of him so he should be able to have a say in whether the baby will be voluntarily murdered or NOT|`|R9AEpBc0aa	I agree. I mean both the guy and the girl created the baby, so why not have a say from both? Although i think there should be NO abortion in general.|`|4IVWMgp7aa	Men should only have a say if they're the ones who are pregnant.|`|CqoTqEu6aa	this sounds like "uterus envy". <br>  <br>  you overlook the entire pregnancy situation. The baby does not emerge from thin air for you to take care of, if that were the case men would have every right to assert their claim and become single parents. But well that's magic land, in reality pregnancy changes a woman's body forever, even if she does not keep the child after. <br>  <br>  For some women it is unsafe for them to carry a child to term, should their boyfriends or husbands demand these women have their children even if it means potential death or serious health complications for the women? <br>  <br>  Should a woman be forced to carry a child for nine months for the sake of a boyfriend when it might; alienate her from her family?, cause her to lose her friends? cause her to lose her job or at the very least inhibit her ability to work? interrupt her studying? cause health problems? change her body forever? force her to go through the pain - mental and physical - of labor? put her at risk for postpartum depression/ major depressive disorder? <br>  <br>  Then there is a whole other issue, if a woman does not want a baby and is forced to carry one to term, who is going to make her have a responsible pregnancy - any man who forces a woman to carry his baby is going to be out of her life in an instant so who will be there to prevent her from drinking? smoking? doing drugs? who can encourage her to eat right? take the necessary vitamins? <br>  <br>  it is naive to assume men have an rights when it comes to whether or not someone has a baby, in the end the body is theirs and you have no control over it. . .|`|8vfCRg7Caa	arguing over abortion i just never understood why people feel so strongly about it. Now i really dont understand why guys argue over their rights to a child. The court system goes in the woman favor for obvious reasons. There are just too many dead beat dads out there. And there are some dead beat moms but not as many as dead beat dads. So it is what it is. <br>  <br>  Frankly i think no matter who you are the mother or the father, you should always be prepared to raise and finance a child on your own. Not that you should have to, but you shouldnt be counting on the law for those means.<br>  <br>  Sorry mothers should have the say so. I dont think guys proven over time to make responsible choices. And laws on based on history whether we like them or not.|`|e98RKB35aa	I believe in the child has the right to live. Putting a poor child in the middle is wrong. It isn't there fault that they are in your uterus. They got created by two people. If the father wants to raise it then the baby should be born for that purpose. I understand I guess if it is rape or incest but that is about it though. I really feel strong to the child having the right to live even if you put it up for adoption. At least he/she will have a chance.|`|87d4tt6Raa	I perosonally think abortion should be illegal. I mean is not really even the mom or dads choice, its not their life thats being taken! <br>  What would the women think if it was her mom going to have an abortion on her? Like say her mom decided not to have her? Would she like to be killed? <br>  Abortions are murder. No two ways about it.|`|04ZBuoqWaa	You're right. I guess I can understand an abortion if the women are raped or abused by a relative, but on moral ground, I think ending a life under any circumstance is WRONG! But I agree that the father should have a say, and kudos to any man who will stand up and be a single parent!|`|JCdBSULraa	I think this is the wrong section.  I guess it could have some "singles and dating" argument, but it's mainly political.<br>  <br>  I do think abortion has really gotten out of hand, but I get so disgusted trying to think about it, I'm not ready to right now (hence why I'm in the less-sensitive singles and dating section).|`|7edl5u1oaa	I agree 100% The child is a part of him just like it's a part of the mother. Both should have a say in it. When it comes to child support or other issues, they involve the father!! Why not this?|`|nS83ag9raa	i dont think anyone should get a say at all..<br>  <br>  if the child cant cant chose...why should we???|`|0G1fOjpWaa	If only more men thought like you the world would be a better place:) I agree with you wholeheartedly on this matter. It takes two to make a baby and so any decisions involving the baby should be 50:50 between both parents.Having said this though, it is the womans body that has to go through 9 months gestation and then the pain of childbirth! lol. Ideally, chidren would only be conceived when they are wanted and on a personal level and as a woman i dont agree with abortion as an escape hatch for couples who get pregnant accidentally and then want a quick exit. If the woman is a victim of rape or abuse then it is more understandable that abortion be used in some cases but for anyone who just wasn't careful? then abortion isn't the answer. The law is wrong a lot of the time and is unfair when it comes to paternal rights...look at madonna and guy richie for instance....guy=sane, madonna=insane, yet who gets custody????<br>  With abortion the law basically says that because its the body of the mother that she gets to decide....totally wrong, the father should definetly have his say....in my opinion though, theres only one victim in abortion though and thats the unborn baby whose life has been taken away through no fault of its own....|`|HrDcaocMaa	I 100% agree with you... It's not "fair" for a woman to make that type of a decision if both participants don't agree on it whole-heartedly.  If a father wants to care for his child and the mother doesn't - well, I believe too that he should have some right and say in the matter - even if that means her delivering the child and handing it over to Dad... It's funny because if it's the father who wants the abortion and the mother doesn't she'll have the final say, have the baby and than suck every dime out of that man's wallet... but I believe the opposite should also be allowed to occur - with the Father taking care of the baby and Mom getting slapped with Child Support etc...  It's a messed up world, and I hope that you're not living through this nightmare because if you are my heart goes out to you...??????|`|VZVGXRyraa	I agree, if a man wants to raise his child regardless of him being a single father then he should get the chance to. One of my friends got a girl pregnant and he was really excited for the baby but then the girl came to him and said "i don't care about the damn baby, i'm not going to lose my body or the rest of my life to this mistake" (those were her exact words). And she had an abortion the next day. My friend was crushed, depressed for months afterwards and  he still breaks down sometimes and it's 2 years later. He would've been a great dad had the girl not been a selfish brat. <br>  <br>  If a man wants to step up and be the father to his baby, girls should respect that and carry the baby to term then just sign over their rights if they don't want to be a part of t he baby's life.|`|95b08c96cc8082f81aedcdfa3f5f6e45aa	I very much so agree with you. I think that just like with adoptions you need to get the signature of both parents infront of a lawyer inorder for the adoption to take place. But with the Federal and State systems fighting weather or not aboritons should be legal or not, there is no standard procedure for abortions. But if you think she should not have it done, go there the day that she is planning on having it done and try to stop her. You have rights too! and if you want to raise that child on your own, good for you. But tell the girl that. Tell her that she doesnt have to have anything to do with the child and that you will care for it. and see what she says! Good luck, this is a hard situation.|`|NGE7nIhqaa	I DEFINITELY agree with you. The father of the baby should have just as much say as the mother. If at least one parent wants to take responsibility for the baby, I don't believe it should be killed.<br>  <br>  I can also see the other side, though. The mother is the one that is actually having it. BUT, it's not fair at all for the father to have absolutely no say.|`|zygejRlSaa	I agree with you in a way.I don't agree with abortion but i would not take that right away from another woman.I think in a way a guy should have a choice ,but the guy isn't the one having to carry the baby for 9 months.He all so isn't the one dealing with all the looks and stares.Or rumors.And having a ruined body and being up all night and being sick in the morning.Then having the pain that comes with birthing the child. Or having to give the baby to you or give it up for adoption.The mother would think about that baby all the time for the rest of her life.I think if you cant handle having a baby you shouldn't have sex at all.|`|pabVvxylaa	Ok first let me start by saying I would NEVER EVER have an abortion. However why do you think you should have any say in what a women does with her body. You may have donated the sperm but her body turned it into a fetus. Not to mention she has to carry it for 9 months. So if a women doesn't want to have a baby but the guy does you think she should HAVE to care it to term. Also how would it work if the women was rapped and the rapist wanted they baby? i know you feel it should be your choice to but in the end its her body her choice.<br>  Personally I think  the women and man should beside together. but in the chance that they disagree she has the final say.|`|wKVrgkPGaa	I think that if you absolutely need to abortion, because I am against abortions, that the woman should get to decide.  It's her body that's going to be doing all the work.  She's going to change and have to deal with day-to-day occurrences or problems with her body, while the males just stand by and wait for the baby to come.|`|e35080c0de8e48c6b1cd707eb28a4829aa	Well I feel if a man can be financially liable for the child maybe he should have more say maybe if the couple has differing idea's they should go to a class to fully know and understand there options and then so even if the woman has the final say at least she can say I fully know my options and have made a choice that's not a spur of the moment emotionally driven one.|`|x2weKYTpaa	Absolutely they should have a big say in this, if in fact they know that 100% is theirs, you are right if the guy wants to be a single father then let him, it's so much better than killing the baby just because of the mothers selfishness|`|ikpKEqIlaa	No man is gonna tell me I can't do what i want with my own body!  Sorry, but it's my body, my choice.  If a man wants to be a single father, he can adopt or get an egg donor and surrogate to carry the baby (like Ricky Martin did)|`|qrGLcTh4aa	It's not your body, it's not your choice.  If you don't want to end up in that situation, then go to store and spend a few dollars for condoms. Preganacy prevention isn't rocket science.|`|BDjBVdtRaa	I do not believe in abortion at all!It's murder. I agree that the father should have say in what happens to his child, because after all it is his child as well as it is his!|`|COhmyWZOaa	i don't care who has a say in the matter. ABORTION IS WRONG! its MURDER!!! we shouldn't kill inocent babies just because a couple of people made a bad choice. remember, the chose comes BEFORE sex, not AFTER|`|RvqpJRFYaa	I completely agree. Everyone should have a chance at life. And your one of the few men man enough to admit it. Kudos for you. (:|`|q1Ty3nk6aa	I would completely agree with this the human incubator task could be transferred from the female to the male. It's all very well saying you wouldn't mind being a single dad, but if that's really what you want, adopt, or find a surrogate mother or something. To force a woman who doesn't feel that she's ready, or who doesn't want children to have to have one growing inside her for nine months, thus impeding greatly on her life in the meantime, only so that she can go through excruciating pain during birth to hand over the child to you is, in my opinion, not a reasonable thing to do. Not only that, if she doesn't want the child before it's born and therefore gives you sole custody, what happens when she later wants to reconnect? And how's that child going to feel knowing that it's mother didn't want it? Yes, it may be a disgusting thing to both do and say, but abortion does not leave a woman with nine months of uncertainty and then a lifetime of possible regret, a man with a child he has to raise on his own, and a child who has abandonment issues. It's perfectly reasonable that men don't get to decide whether to go through with abortions or not.<br>  <br>  I do think you raise an interesting question though, I mean, if your girlfriend found out she was pregnant and didn't want to keep it, would you rather she never told you she was pregnant and went through with it or, supposing you were against abortion, would you rather she asked you and then aborted anyway?<br>  <br>  Just something for you to think about.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Actually, I've just been reading all these and everyone's saying how there's no excuse for people who get pregnant 'cause there are plenty of contraceptive devices out there - well, yeah, there are, but accidents do happen. With exception to abstinence (and let's face it, who REALLY wants that) there are no contraceptives which are 100% effective. Yeah, you could double up, or even use three different contraceptives, but that's still not something which you can EXPECT from people. Many people don't realise that a condom is not 100% effective, or that you can still get pregnant on the pill. It's not because they didn't try to be safe, it's that they weren't educated well enough. So stop condemning them to a life which they might not be able to cope with! There's no point in bringing a baby into this world if it's quality of life is going to awful, is there?|`|qRDHEGHJaa	I think aborting a baby is wrong any way. If the mother didnt want a baby she should not of acted like a &&&&& and got prego to many birth controls out there for any one to say they didnt try to get prego. or it was an accident wtf ever. And even if they did pass a law that the mother had to have the fathers concent all she has to do is say she dont know who the father is. Or even if they passed a law only if you are raped you can get one, she can always say she was raped so there is no getting around any of this the only thing people can do is stand by their choices and no if they get one they just KILLED a human..... I also think if your going to get one maybe you should get ur tubes tied if ur not a grown up enough to use protection, get fixed.  And the man SHOULD have a say so in it as well she has no right at all to get prego if she didnt want it. she didnt get that way by her self so how could she kill a mans child if he wants it????????

1235333b4f34f1147fc81bf4aef8885baa	In general, I can't think of many other than that your energy level is naturally higher as a teenager than at other times.<br>  <br>  Individually, it's possible.  My sister-in-law, for example, had her first baby when she was 16.  This was back in the 80s, so that meant dropping out of school and that all the dreams she thought she had went up in smoke.<br>  <br>  However, rather than looking at it as a bad thing, my sister has always said that it's the best thing that ever happened to her.  Having a child gave her motivation and a sense of responsibility she never had before.  Rather than being defeated by the challenge of rasing a child when she herself was just a child, she rose to to the challenge.<br>  <br>  She got her own place, worked her rear end off as a waitress while pushing herself through college.  Today she works for the federal government and provides a very nice life for herself and her son.  She married a few years back and now has younger children with her husband, whom she's very happy with.<br>  <br>  At 15, she had been failing out of school, a regular on the party scene, taking drugs and drinking until she couldn't remember what she'd been doing, had already been treated for an STD, etc.  But, getting pregnant changed all that.<br>  <br>  She's 33 now, by the way, so these are longterm life improvements.  She volunteers at a crisis pregnancy center now to help young girls who are going through some of the same issues that she was.|`|ZckxI1M5aa	The only possibly positive thing that could come out of being a teenage parent is that he/she would be forced to become more responsible and mature faster that normal. <br>  So many people with give you negative responses becuase being a teenage parent is extremely difficult and they will suggest that teenagers who get pregnant are completely irresponsible.  I believe everyone makes mistakes.  But my mother had my oldest sister at the age of 16 and by the time she had me (5th child) she was 23.<br>  She was forced to grow up and learn to take care of her children and herself alone.  Today, she is one the most brilliant, well rounded people I know. And I believe it becuase of a world she was thrown into.<br>  I don't in anyway advocate teenage pregancy nor do i advocate abortion. Abstinence or safe sex are the only ways to avoid pregnancy.|`|Tyi6rEtcaa	You become a grandparent young enough to do things with the grandkids.  That's the only upside to teen pregnancy I can see being possible.|`|3zm0jA0yaa	none that i know of<br>  Well lets see, you don't have to be worried about what you are going to wear on a date cause you are not going to have any~!<br>  You don't have to worry about what to do with your money, cause you won't have any, it'll all go towards diapers food rent etc.<br>  You don't have to d ecide what careeer you are going to have,cause you don't have a high school diploma much less a college degree<br>  Yes i guess theres positives IF YOU RE A MORON!|`|AA10500537	no in most cases  but if you plan on marrying the dad  and he will stick by you  it could work out,<br>  that doesnt mean you should go out and get pregnant  because most times the young dads dont stick around.|`|Wzi2Zll7aa	NO.|`|UC8chYWlaa	No, not really. You'll never get to be an average teenager and just party. Don't get me wrong, i got pregnant with my son at 16 and i wouldn't take that back for nothin in this world, but i never got to just be a teenager. You have to grow up really fast and don't have any time for partying or goin out with friends.|`|8XptmQBXaa	You'll be able to watch them grow up, and be able to relate to them better when they are teens. and there won't be a huge age gap with them. You won't hear them say "Well when you were my age it was different times back then"
AA11380378	Ok, chill<br>  <br>  I understand your situation. I was in the same situation as you. I relocated 1000 miles and left all my friends behind 8 months before the wedding. What I did is I relied on his female family members for advice, girl time and such. Does he have any sisters? Cool aunts? Crazy grannies? Cousins? it would be blast to include them and make them your entourage.<br>  <br>  At least you recognized that you sound childish and jealous, but it's pretty normal to feel this way. I suggest you do what you can with what you have.<br>  <br>  Another alternative is to treat  yourself to a spa treatment instead of a bachelorette party? or treat yourself to a Coach bag instead. Nowhere says that you "have to have" a raunchy bachelorette party or all the other frills and things. Be a mature lady and pull yourself together.<br>  <br>  Also, talk to your fiance and see if he can enroll the help of his family. That's what we did and we decided on a co-ed bachelor/bachelorette party with family and friends, we went party together as a group and had a fancy meal, got drinks at a bar. It was a lor of fun and I did not feel excluded. My fiance's family also threw a small shower for me, it was very nice that they dis as otherwise I wouldn't have had any; but even if I didn't have it, I would have make myself happy anyway.<br>  <br>  Good luck and CONGRATULATIONS!!!!!!!!!!!! be happy , you are getting married and ultimately, that's all that matters. <br>  <br>  **HUGS**|`|AkUhaMm9aa	I m exactly on the same boat as you are...i live far far away from my family and only have like 3 female friends which dont even know each other and are much help with the planning....so im not even going to bother with the bachelorete party, I think I will just organize a little dinner with them..and we'll see what happens..<br>  <br>  an idea: some people have Double bachelor parties now..so all of your Friends  his or yours can be there..<br>  <br>  you could have a bbq at home with family and friends and then go out all together...<br>  <br>  you should talk to your fiance and tell him how you feel kinda left out...maybe he'll come up with something..|`|EjyD1sXeaa	Fly back to your home town and have a great time with your female relatives and friends. there don't have to be loads of you. go out for a classy meal or movies...<br>  QUALITY not quantity!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  please remember, life isn't just about your bachelorette party or wedding day, it's about enjoying the rest of your life in your marriage with your husband|`|JtEBaOdjaa	Why don't you ask your fiance if he minds having a joint party. Explain this all to him.  He'll understand and I'm sure he wouldn't mind having you along.  You say you do all of this stuff with them anyways, so I don't see why he would have a problem.<br>  <br>  When does your sis come into town? Maybe the 3 of you could hit the spa for the day?  Much better than drinking for the night. (in my opinion. I'm over the whole drinking thing though)|`|MGOFjVnVaa	let the "boys" have their fun. you really do not need all those<br>  giggling chicks around you - the so-called bachelorette parties<br>  are just a feeble attempt to copy the bachelor's parties.<br>  <br>  if i walked in your shoes i would treat my sister to a nice dinner<br>  at a real fancy restaurant and - if possible - see a musical,<br>  go to a concert or even a good movie. that is a lot better<br>  than all that "ahhhhhh" and "ohhhhh" over presents one<br>  doe not like ayway|`|wWzK6eJaaa	Why dont you have a combined bachelorette and bachelor party, go to a nice place and get VIP or something everyone can be together, so you wont feel so alone. Plus i think its better like that and theres no surprises like "umm, honey theres something i gotta tell you before we get married, the night of my bachelor party, etc" :-)|`|lYZ71zYAaa	So you and your fiance cousin, make a night of it. What about your future mother in-law? I went to my daughter in laws party and had a great time.does the cousin have any girl friends that would love to help celebrate with you?  good Luck.|`|CkN4pgpCaa	Have you considered asking the wives/girlfriends of the guys that your fiance is going out with for his?  If some of his friends (or your guy friends that are going) have wives or girlfriends, they may be looking to get out of the house that night as well.. since their men will be out partying!  You could just let them know that you don't want them sitting at home while your men are out and that they should join you for your party... it'll be a fun girls night!  There's no rule that you have to be BFF with all the girls... it's just supposed to be a fun night with the girls!  You make even make some new friendships!  <br>  <br>  Of course, this will only work if the boys have cool and fun wives and girlfriends.  Otherwise, I would ask your sister and fiance's cousin to bring a fun girlfriend or two.  It can be a lot of fun bonding with new girlfriends over drinks and dancing.  <br>  <br>  Good luck- I know how you feel:)  My fiance has  huge groups of friends from HS, college and work.. while I just have a few close girlfriends that aren't even really friends with each other.. just me.  It's tough to not get jealous when so many people want to get together for his night out and it's much less for you.  Just try to focus on having fun no matter how many people are there!|`|0Id85yiYaa	i'm so sorry you're feeling bummed. i moved to a small town to be with my fiance and pretty much gave up my life; which meant losing touch with most of my friends...so i can relate. i know you've already suggested going wtih him, but why not tell him how you feel and say that you want to have a joint bachelor/bachelorette party? since your friends are all male, have your party with them! there's no rules that says you have to have a bachelorette party with just girls! i hope you start feeling better!
bQR2Ld7Eaa	Unfortunately, you DID make a mistake... Those guys that, "love making fun of each other and putting everyone down," have probably known each other for a long time and as much as you were "following their lead," you are not apart of the group yet, because "you're the new guy." You kind of over stepped your bounds, I had a new boss that did the same thing AND EVERYONE HATED HIM. All his "comments," were no different then the playing around we ALL did, but he was "the new guy," and didn't know ANY of us, so everyone took his comments wrong. <br>  <br>  The boss only lasted about three months before he got transfered into a different position (dead end position, so he could do any more harm). You can only fix it by playing along now, or making friends with all the young hot chicks in the company. Nothing says, "I'm the man" like all the hot cCompanychicks being your friend. Other than that, you have to be patient, your the new guy... give it time and they will come around.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	If you're the boss then yeah, you did  wrong.  You tried to make yourself their equal and now they don't respect you.  Unless you can get control of them and reassert your authority then you won't be there long.<br>  <br>  If you're just the new guy and you are their equal then you eat a little crow and tell them you're sorry for causing offense but you were just trying to kid with them and fit in.  Then you back off and behave in a professional manner with them if and until they decide they want you as part of their little clique.  <br>  <br>  If it really is unbearable then ask for a transfer to another department or if that isn't possible then start looking for work elsewhere.<br>  <br>  edit:<br>  I agree with the poster who said work isn't the place to make friends.  You're there to do a job, not build a social life.  I always like to keep work and my social life separate, just for the reason you are experiencing now.  If you always behave in a professional manner then no one has any real complaints about you not treating them fairly.  But if you have a social life that crosses over into your work life then you run the risk of someone accusing you unfair treatment because they either are or are not your friend.|`|YIeXrfBKaa	The workplace is not always the best place to make friends. Perhaps you are more mature, but the age range difference is not significant. Step back and ask yourself if you are trying to impress them and why? You are there to do a job; you go in, do your job, go home to a life. Yes, it would be nice if the workplace was ...friendlier, but it isn't. Do you job to the best of your ability, learn the ropes, and work your way to a better environment.|`|yiUNN8ADaa	I suggest ignoring them. You're the new guy. No matter what your age, they won't accept/respect you until you prove you can hang. Just do a good job at work and ignore their comments. Eventually one of them will need your help with something and when you come through for them, being the kind person you are, they will realize you're cool.|`|pRxzPiSbaa	you could always try telling them how you feel....but that might make things worse. i would seriously try to talk to them though.
1235333b4f34f1147fc81bf4aef8885baa	Your soon to be sister-in-law is a textbook "taker."  She'll take all you have and then some and blame you for not having more.<br>  <br>  As for the daughter, I feel bad for her and you should too.  That's not to say that she isn't a brat - she probably is.  But that's unfortunate and not really her fault.  Who turns out normal when they have a mother like this?<br>  <br>  You need to talk to your fiance about setting some groundrules.  Bottom line: at some point, they need to be out on their own.  In the meantime, they need to start chipping in.  If it's not an actual rent payment, they need to be picking up some of the utlities.  If they won't, you have to put them out.  Offer to allow the daughter to stay, but mom has to go.  Mom's an adult and capable of taking care of herself.  They won't want to stay separate, so they'll both go, but no one will accuse you of throwing a child out on the streets.<br>  <br>  I would suggest making appointments at some social service agencies.  There is a lot of low income housing available to single moms.  They could also probably get set up on food stamps or other temporary assistance to adjust to the change.<br>  <br>  The mom is a taker.  Let her take from the government instead of you.|`|vmWEm4Jzaa	having had an unfortunate house guest for 4 months that didnt seem to want to help himself at all!!! i would say you are just going to have to set a date that she has to be out by. i am prego also and i told my husband his foster brother could not be living here when the baby comes because i would probably kill him. now-his f.brother has some issues with holding down a job also but i tried to get him into some programs for free housing and help with job "rehabilitation"but it sounds like you need to get her out of your house and let her mooch off someone else. talk to your fiance-sounds like its time for some tough love!|`|zdu3gh8jaa	I'm sure you have already asked this question.|`|0115b8162e3b4d1bdce5ffb45890b1d8aa	You do not ask. You tell them amd tel them now,  they go to the council for emergency accommodation. you will be amazed how fast they get their own place. Yes you will be eaten up with guilt but why should they free load on you and your fiance|`|TplAab3Haa	What a terrible situation to find yourself in. Firstly (I'm assuming you're in the UK) go along to CAB to find out the legal position. There are things which you can do in the meantime. You don't have to feed them. You could put locks on your cupboards an fridge. As its your property, you could change the locks and not give them a key. You could consult a solicitor ( I think you get the first half hour free under legal aid) and get then to send her an official notice to quit. After that if she's still there she'll be trespassing or worse so you could call the police to have her removed. Make it all official and stay within the law and you should be OK.|`|XNo8YGyfaa	X, I'm afraid we can't afford to maintain the household if you two are living with us. Landlord is threatening to kick us out. You're going to have to find another place to live in two weeks. (maintain eye contact)<br>  <br>  If they don't even try, change the locks an send them to a parents/ uncle's house.|`|YQ1Q7XeEaa	Your fiance' needs to tough it up and tell them to move out.  It is your flat after all.<br>  <br>  Yes it is as simple as that.  It's called tough love.  This mother will not do for herself until she has no other choice.<br>  <br>  I could see keeping the 10yr old as long as she will live by your rules.  (what are the chances of that?).|`|h3s02b3Jaa	Buy the local paper and put a ring round all the flats to let. Then tell them it's time to start viewing. If your flat is rented, say the landlord is going to do a check up and his insurance will not cover them because they are not on the lease, so they have to go. <br>  If this does not work, then you will have to be blunt and tell them they have out stayed their welcome and could they please move on.|`|i4bjQbPcaa	Right for a start it is not the little girl's fault that she has not been taught discipline and if you are that concerned why don't you and your fiance teach her about respecting others?<br>  <br>  They have been there for a month, it's not a long time so it seems like you have decided to change your mind because you found out you were pregnant.<br>  <br>  Speak like an adult to your fiance's sister, let her know the money situation (which you would have been aware of before she moved in) and tell her that she has to contribute to live there.  She will be entitled to housing benefit as a parent<br>  <br>  Edit:  They were there 6 months before you arrived, so you knew they were living there and your fiance was happy with the arrangement.  Me thinks its basically you have pitched up and now you are having a baby you want a 'normal' family and not have his family hanging around|`|oMNXWMs9aa	You need to put your foot down I know what you are going threw I had to learn the hard way and I 2 am pregnant in my case it seemed as if no one appreciated any thing and I have learned I have other things that are more important. it seems like you try to help family and they just seem to take advantage of the situation.

62TvIinPaa	Nope.|`|6PhSENcXaa	It doesn't offend me what so ever.  Most of the time my wife is holding on to my other arm.  So while the ladies are looking at my arms the guys are looking at my wife.  <br>  <br>  I bring my wife into a room and the guys are all watching every step she takes.  Some even drool.....   But then the girls are falling off their chairs checking my arms out and probable even drooling themselves.<br>  <br>  So no it doesn't bother me, there's nothing wrong with looking.|`|T4N6a7MQaa	Why would a guy be offended by that. Looking and laughing might be offensive. What you are suggesting however is a compliment.|`|tMcIcpQIaa	It totally depends on what kind of guys muscle you are looking at. Obviously if the guy who goes to the gym everyday  wouldn't mind if you look at his muscles. But if you're looking at a geek, skinny dude or nerd muscle he probably get offended.|`|AA11660242	Personally, no. I get embarassed when that happens. It's like when a girl knows she looks good, and she dresses the part, and all the guys stare. She probablly would feel embarassed too.|`|ZkFfzDXlaa	they shouldnt get offended.. i mean all we're doin is checking them out..|`|2fsghqKoaa	no more like flattered|`|zJTJTPyMaa	haha absolutely not!! when they see you checking them out its a serious confidence boost for them|`|1cb3542838b379bb2f5a7c25c04d579baa	I don't think so.

JhvqUvlsaa	Well you want your child to have his/her mother in his/her life so you can't throw her out with yesterday's garbage; so here's what I would do: politely tell her not to get suggestive like that anymore. You're with someone else and it makes you uncomfortable. When she gets mad and stuff let her. Then tell her you're glad she still likes you and you want her there for the child but you're uncomfortable with the sexual innuendos.|`|uNbsSLcbaa	you should stay away from her. if you have another girl and shes the mother of your kid, then you should forget about her. Shes acting like a whore|`|BYQ2kHPjaa	It's understandable that because of your child you both will always have a connection to eachother, but she needs to understand that you have moved on and are with someone else. I advise you to be honest with her and tell her how you feel, and that you don't appreciate her comments or actions. She needs to accept that your relationship is in the past, and that is where it will stay. In my opinion she is acting slightly slutty, desperate and pathetic. Good luck x|`|6RmKN0SVaa	stay away from the ex she is just trying to make you jealous and want her back... stay with the mother of your child because you obviously have a bigger responsibly with her but really if she is trying to act like a **** to get you back then she is really immature and needs to grow up|`|G32X9fnZaa	Good God how old is this girl?She sounds like a child herself the way she's acting.You have a dilemma.Does she live close by?Do you see and support your child?Don't get re-involved unless you are sure of your feelings.She sounds put out 'cos you are with someone else.<br>  Good luck and get to know your child.|`|yUIODXRzaa	if shes the mother of ur kid u should stay with her|`|LXNo9ROaaa	Whoever you love most.

If she isn't, then all is well.<br>  If she is, you need to be a responsible father.

You had sex with your ex (regardless ex, fling, girlfriend) so that child is your responsibilitiy. You need to find out for sure if she is, and if she is, if it's yours and if she is going to keep the baby. Once that is all settled, be a man and stand behind what you did. As for this new girl, let her know what is going on - if you don't, I guarantee it will come to kick you in the a**.|`|kcSZ03TLaa	sucks for you, next time you will think twice about going around sleeping with different people.|`|fmATfubnaa	You should try to be friends with the girl carrying ur children if its so

FS8vHNmoaa	There isn't anything wrong with you. This stuff happens all of the time! Just look up on yahoo answers "Am I attracted to my sister?" and you'll get a load of results that are similar to your case. My guess is you aren't really attracted to your sister its probably just hormones. Most likely your problem will pass. <br>  I remember about a year ago when I was about 12 or so, I kept thinking of every bizarre and disturbing thought that I could surface to my head. It really bothered me, but it passed. Heh, I actually ended up talking to my mom about it and she was incredibly understanding Really I guess  you're dealing with "raging" hormones and all that. It most likely will pass. DON'T listen to those people who are saying that there is something wrong with you because it most likely isn't true.<br>  Seriously, you may find talking to an understanding adult or looking it up on the internet, for me its really helpful when I find that there are other people with similar situations to me.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps ^^|`|lA0e6vWxaa	"SIGMUND FREUD" You might want to read up on Sigmund Freud, I learned of him from my psychology class when I was in college.

EHwEMo51aa	As for the name calling, ignore it - they'll soon get bored! The guy that dumped you because his mate was calling you mean names is VERY insecure. I'm single and you're age it's okay.. once you accept it others will, I know what you mean though I want that special someone too but there's very little point in going out with someone just because you feel you have to - wait for him someone will treat you right. There isn't a perfect man but whoever you do end up with needs to respect you and make you feel special.. and NOT dump you because his maye said so. Chin up everything will work out!|`|34ikhhtMaa	1st off- Make sure you don't dress trash/ such as really low cut shirts that show tons and super short shorts or skirts.<br>  <br>  2nd- make sure u aren't wearing too much makeup- that can make you look trashy and like a tramp.<br>  <br>  3rd- Make sure you don't say things that may make you  seem nasty.<br>  <br>  4th- If you truly want a guy that will love you, then you need to make sure that you are being yourself, but not being tacky.

Humility is really, really attractive. Some guys just get all offended when they're teased and they think they always have to "prove themselves"-- that is just so ugly and immature.<br>  2. I want a guy who cares about other people. Like, genuinely focused on making other people comfortable.<br>  3. I want a guy who likes me. If a guy is good for me in many ways, but he doesn't bother with getting to know ME, I don't bother with him. Maybe that sounds selfish, but I want someone who cares about me.<br>  4. I want a guy who doesn't have a mean sense of humor. I think there are a lot of genuinely nice people out there, but when they tease people, that little mean streak starts to show, and it is such a turn off. Guys who laugh at other people's discomfort gross me out.<br>  5. I want a guy who will take charge. This is sort of like number four...if a guy is too lazy to do the work and "chase" me, I'm not going to bother with him. He can find some other girl who doesn't want to be chased.<br>  6. I want a guy who's taller than me.

Just remember don't break her heart and not show up at least call her if you can't come|`|lJ2XG0QMaa	OMG this is so much fun. I can help you out! <br>  Yes go see her. And ask her about herself. Girls looove when they get to talk about themself. Do not go on and on about you. Let her talk. Ask her how her day is. Ask her what she is doing on the weekend. And ask about school or music. Keep the visit brief like 10 min. ALWAYS keep casual visits brief. It makes her always want more time with you. Then dont call her,wait for her to ask 2 see you. Most of the time say ok but then only stop by for a quick visit, sometimes say sorry you are busy you have plans with other friends (even if you dont) this makes her think you are Mr popular. Always let her come to you to ask to see you. If you want a date with her try this- one casual visit mention that you and a group of friends had some really good ice cream at (name of icecream place) the other week and it was really good and say that she would like it. then wait for her to say "id like that" BAM you got a date!|`|CQUuCpTQaa	Well you can't miss something you never had. If she really wants to see you then you should go over. She's probably too shy to call. Do you want to see her?|`|OyWVqe23aa	the way to make a girl miss you is to give it to her good!! have a big d*ck and do it to it!!!|`|282f3c3ef67f759a8388216dc595a9dbaa	Go|`|DNwHGeEtaa	Just go if she wants to see you. I'm a girl, and if a guy I liked gave me his number, i wouldn't call him either if he didn't call me first.<br>  <br>  To make a girl think about you and miss you, one thing you can do is being sweet. Little things can make a girl remember you all the time. Some sweet words can touch a girl's heart and she won't forget. You don't have to kiss her @ss, but being nice and sweet will secure you a place in a girl's heart.|`|m3cf7vsAaa	Blowing her off is what it might seem like if you don't go at all.  A good way to make her miss you is to tell her you're out of town, or sick, or even that you have some other random commitment to go to and not see her at work for a week.  If she is going to miss you, then it'll happen when you aren't there for a period of time.  It'll dawn on her like hmmm I miss the guy.  But not going for one day is likely to be interpreted like you found something better to do.  In turn making her angry not making her miss you.  Oh but you may want to wait until you actually have to be somewhere else or you are sick... since lying to the girl isn't a good approach either.|`|OvBmXfZmaa	Well, she's probably playing hard to get.  Go and see her.. show her your interested, but don't stay long, and when you leave tell her to call when she gets off and maybe ya'll can meet up then, if she calls then she's probably interested.  If she doesn't then stay away and if she wants to see you she will find a way.. Good Luck.|`|c0plf0VLaa	Don't jump at her beck and call.. If she's not calling you, she probably isn't that interested. Don't get played; be aloof. She wants you to go visit? Don't visit until Saturday. I think if you keep your distance and play hard to get, you'll have a better chance with her.  Good luck.|`|JvOL7y2Kaa	why complicate things and play mind games?<br>  <br>  just go.<br>  <br>  if you like her, be with her, don't play miss you hard to get games.

1235333b4f34f1147fc81bf4aef8885baa	Depends on his reasoning and he'd have to have an understanding of the consequences.<br>  <br>  Obviously, a lot of kids shave their heads so they can look like Skinheads.  If my kid was into that culture, there would definitely be some repercussions for shaving his head.  I can't control his interests, until he's 18, I can control his haircut if I need to.<br>  <br>  However, here in the US, it's pretty common for boys (especially young boys) to shave their heads in the summer.  I wouldn't really have a problem with this, so long as they understood it might be giving them a tougher image than they might like.<br>  <br>  I don't personally care for the bald look, but my problem with my boys has always been the opposite.  They love their long flowing Jonas Bros-esque locks.  No mom should ever have to fight for combs with her teenage sons, so I'd be happy if they told me they were ready to shave their heads come spring.|`|rJPBF33taa	No---kids do not understand the consequesnces of poor decisions.<br>  Imageine if your child is teased or harrassed for that.<br>  You would be partially to blame.<br>  That is as crazy as parents who let their kids wear Christmas tree t-shirts in July "bexaue they want to."<br>  We the parents need to filter the kids from the world.<br>  Good Luck and kudos to you for caring enough to get a second opinion.|`|Ot2tJXU2aa	It would depend on why and your social events and what you did in your spare time! A parents job is to redirect their children onto a path that is healthy and will further their future as a well rounded healthy adult!|`|tN2N3IzMaa	What are the reasons for you wanting to shave your head??  If my child was hanging out with the wrong crowd and wanted to shave their head to fit in I might object. But if the reasons are okay- then why not!|`|Ng7sF33Oaa	When my children are old enough to make there own descions that's when they can do what they want but when there still living in my house they do what i say.|`|Imgb9hIWaa	it all depends y they want 2 shave there heads|`|AA10500537	no not if you lived in my house  then when you left you could do what you want|`|DTZmqnCkaa	Sure, it's only hair and will grow back.|`|Ql0gi4rVaa	i would let my son do it if he wanted too (it would break my heart cus he has GREAT blonde hair)<br>  my brother let his son do it for years<br>  <br>  you need to sit down with your parents and talk to them WITHOUT whining or crying <br>  act like an adult (calm pleasant etc...) and ask them their opinion<br>  and remain calm and respectful when you are explaining your opinion<br>  if they say no then no it is<br>  they may change their mind if you act better than you usually do<br>  also give your mum a reason to support your decision<br>  for example tell her that you will do some chores for  may many days to earn the rght to shave your head<br>  maybe this will be incentive enough for her<br>  but remember you will always be her baby boy regardless of how old you are<br>  she loves you more than you know<br>  and you MUST respect her at ALL times<br>  regardless if she disagrees with you<br>  <br>  trust me on this one<br>  one day you will receive many rewards if you treat your parents well<br>  not only from them but from others<br>  <br>  what comes around goes around|`|95b08c96cc8082f81aedcdfa3f5f6e45aa	Personally I would let my son shave his head. As long as his school allowed his head to be shaved, and would not get into any kind of trouble as a result of shaving his head. If I had a daughter I would never let her do it. But my son I would, the hair will grow back so quickly that it isnt that big of an ordeal.|`|8iE6oDmwaa	once their in college i'd let my kid do what they want, but any younger than that then no. shaving your head, especially as a teenager, will give people certain impressions about you, probably some that you don't realize but that your mother does|`|uFT0k30Kaa	Yeah. I mean if you are a kid they have some say so but if your older, you do what you want to with your hair. I would let my son shave his head.|`|TPnMtzd9aa	no i wudnt mind<br>  <br>  its their head<br>  <br>  as long as it wasnt completly gne like shiny head gone|`|wlWCGGVIaa	depends how old <br>  but generally no|`|TWsxP46Qaa	if my kids are under 16 theres not a chance in hell they're getting to shave their heads,after that its their call|`|AU04o0Pmaa	yes why???|`|DeMcghkoaa	are you a boy or girl?  why?  my son shaves his head during the warmer weather because his dad does.|`|bb06GQ5Paa	I'm not a parent but I wouldn't mind my sons shaving their heads.

Yeah, I would have a problem with it.|`|ZCo6OFToaa	I am quite laid back really, my little boy has had a mohican for about 4 years (since he was 5) it's only hair it will grow back!|`|LCIcUTwNaa	Wow...I'm not sure about that one. I have adaughter who will soon be 21 and she sure has gone throught the rainbow of hair dyes and I've always said hair grows back but....How about you just get like a crew cut and see how they react to that first and if all is well go for all of it.|`|1hciyvKdaa	No, the reason is, it makes a kid look like a skin head or a gang banger. If for a sport thats one things, but usually the common thought on shaved heads is not a good one. Thats why I would say no.|`|Mfy5gd77aa	shes right. shaved heads on kids look stupid and disgusting. wherever you go people would have preconceptions. they only work on some men as it is.|`|6PhSENcXaa	Absolutely not, unless they were 18 years old.  Our 5 boys knew better then to even think about it let alone do it.

How old are you?  Huh?  I don't get it...I think you should focus on school, college, supporting yourself...love will come when it comes.|`|MJi4qsWYaa	WeLL. ur decision is ok....      :)hhehehehheheeh|`|ygimTNzoaa	You being 15 can not have that answer right now. Everyone changes and maybe not marrying before you're even 30 would be a good idea. I was in a 5 year relationship as the first relationship I was ever in right after high school. I was 18 years old, he was 19. We loved each other even as we'd broken up and today are still great friends. Being as young as we were having not experienced life with jobs, responsibilities, family, ect.. We both developed our personalitys. In the end, after the 5 years we still loved eachother but had no sexual desire anymore. We were even holding eachother back from potential careers because we WANTED to be together always. Having had accepted that we cannot go much further in life as a couple we'd have to take a break and see what else is out there, so we'd find out if we were really right for eachother. I never imagined I'd find someone else, and I have. He thought he'd have no problem finding someone else, and now he always tells me,  letting me go was the biggest mistake of his life. The main thing is he's happy that I'm happy. I've seen how much he's changed since we've broken up and he's not who he was before. Being a bit older say your  30's you've had your time to grow your own personality, hopefully settled in a carrer and a life of independance, you should know what you want in life, and out of a mate, and I believe you have much more chance of success if you held out till then. But I'll tell you now, my X would've never lost me if he hadn't proposed the idea of taking a break, I'dve married him and been happy not knowing what I "could've had". You choose your own life, I've chosen mine, now I'm pregnant and having my new fiances baby and we're both thrilled. I know I'll be happy where I am the rest of my life. When you're in love, it's just something you know. Good luck in that future of yours.|`|VjMyHAWraa	You have obviously seen some marriages go bad! Which some do. But you are very young and impressionable to be making any decisions about this matter! Grow up first ,then things will be clearer for you! Enjoy your teenage years! Once they are gone...they are gone!!|`|FtyLwqR5aa	that's what you are thinking now, but once you get older you will see that it is not so hard to break up with one you love. besides love and relationships CAN last forever until death. It is what you try to make of it.|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	I think you are still a child, so you think like a child. You will change your mind when you grow up.|`|tsBL19qzaa	At 15, your statement only shows what you don't know about life.|`|b7bb85526b028b7f92b16c8204ed4012aa	But you will as you get older nd find the one true love of your life. True marriage is harder to get out of but just being together is also way to easy to just walk away from, no real committment to speak of. Youre way too young to be worried about these type of things and your thinking will change a thousand times over the next few years. Also dont ever compare your life or any relationship you ever have to anyone elses or you will doom it from the very beginning, everyone is different so yours will be different from everyone elses too. Be your own person and dont worry about everyone else or what theyre doing. Worry more about your education now and the rest will take care of itself. good luck and enjoy lifes journey

But, sometimes guys are very shy or awkwardabout approaching girls.  Many times girls are a lot more mature that boys of the same age and so they need a boy who is alittle older, someone who is not afraid of starting up a conversation.|`|XRLinunRaa	The reason why he doesn't say anything is because he is nervous, I'm sure when you like a guy you get all nervous and want to say something to the guy so bad but are too nervous to.|`|c9f2a1b3d1f4937e76dfc5f19e0e903daa	Oh the games we play.

When a guy stares at you it means that they like you, or you have something on your face. But because his friend said he likes you then its not the second one. Just go up to him and tell him that you like him|`|2HlOrec1aa	he's obviously kinda shy...around you at least...maybe he hasnt had that much experiance with girls...if you like him back then maybe you should talk to him it's ok for girls to make the first move =] See if it's a misunderstanding of if you two could actually go somewhere|`|tI11Aax9aa	well, thereis a possibility. if hes always looking at you than yeah he might like you. and if his friend told you that he likes you, than heprobablyy does.

I always ask about the science test or the Movies or something.|`|NTUr0t3haa	Instead of "just listening to music" say, "I'm listening to ____ (name of group) and thinking about how much I ____" (some philosophical thought that might be controversial and evoke comment).|`|JhvqUvlsaa	Look at their status and send them a message asking them about it. "Oh you're going to Florida for a week? That's cool so what are you going to do?" <br>  When they respond see what they say and then respond again.<br>  Also, send all your friends a bulletin with 10 questions to answer. When they respond back with their answers, send them a message regarding one of their answers. "Omg did you really do that?" And then go from there. <br>  <br>  Works for me. =)
7465ac9a7d2ba579932941bf1ef1a071aa	That is life, living together with someone is not all fun and games, it isn't an easy life. Maybe you could have just watched the show on your own and let him do his own thing. Guys hate to be nagged on stuff, just tell him once and if he says he'll do it, he'll do it in his own time. When he does do it, make a big fuss over it, like how much you apperiate it, boost his ego a little, kinda of like when you praise a dog for doing something well. Life is much smoother that way, if you giveh im postivie attention instead of negative it will be better for both of you in the long run.|`|T4N6a7MQaa	Last two words explained it all. You're still young. Relationships don't just happen and aren't that easy. You've got to work on them all the time.|`|NbUwThM4aa	when you live with someone you really get to know them. it's called a trial marriage. i wouldn't recommend it.|`|3a647f65ed58c0295bd67fb05ff0517caa	all i can tell u is just make him happy if u know wat i mean and maybe he would do right|`|JjwQMN3laa	Your answer is in your last sentence. You've only been dating a year and you're still young. Even though a year seems like a long time to have been with someone doesn't mean you know everything about them. This gives you a peek at how he could be in the future if you were to stay together. But, if he's constantly doing things that upset you, then you're going to be disappointed for a while because he's set in his ways, and if you plan to stay together, you can't "change" someone overnight.
1F6ZnYtXaa	i think gut feelings are generally right. i believe your gut instinct is your bodies natural defensive mechanism- its the first feeling and natural reaction to protect yourself. After that intitial moment, your brain comes into play and over rides your gut feeling by trying to 'think' about it and come up with some logical reason or excuse. But we should always trust the first, natural, gut feeling.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	Absolutely, and the best barometer is your gut. It is there for a reason, and the feelings you get, are from subliminal "messages" your spouse sends out, certain behavioral changes, etc and that all goes right to your gut and gives that feeling so you always need to pay attention to it.|`|IvMPh09baa	wow... this is exactly how I have felt all weekend.  My husband did not show up to meet me at 11AM on saturday when promised.  I called and the phone was turned off, then he showed up with flowers at 6PM.  Something in my gut is telling me... something wrong happened.  When I asked him where he had been he said he accidentally slept in all day.... yeah... no honey.  I have heard him try to explain his story many times... but something just does not add up here.  Not at all... and I know in my gut... he did something wrong and he is not being honest.  I have asked over and over, in the most calm I possibly can... but still, something in my gut is telling me that this doesn't feel right, somehwere inside it just doesn't make sense.<br>  <br>  i am filing for divorce, i have tried talking to him over and over, but I will tell you this... I trust my gut more than I trust him.<br>  <br>  I will add.... i ask him question about what happened, he automatically gets mad and said i am investigating him. well, he didn't show up when he was supposed to... i have a right to question.|`|ZckxI1M5aa	Female intuition. just like motherly instinct. It a 6th sense that women have about things.  Only thing is you cant accuse your mate of anything unless you know for sure.  Insticts/gut feelings are not 100% reliable. They are just really strong feelings that women are born with.|`|4o3jXz3Waa	I can't speak for everyone obviously, but my gut feeling was right on target.  When I suspected my husband was having an affair, turns out he was.|`|64b71311b453645560ceb49d58250d08aa	I wouldn't say it was a gut feeling as much as the guy or gal acting differently.|`|IELqIdHuaa	Yes you can tell.As a woman I knew long before there was something wrong with my relationship but I hoped it was a phase he was going through and would overcome. Had he discussed this with me we could of worked it out. Im sure you have that gut feeling, so with that in mind, go with it. Ask questions and make sure, life is to short to be with someone who will only be unfaithful to you. You can find someone worthy and if the other person is unfaithful to you, it will happen to the next one as well. Chin up and move on my dear.|`|lfTlBOhAaa	There's usually a credible reason that causes a "gut feeling" like the other person acting differently, habits changing, etc. More times than not, the "gut feeling" is a clear indicator that something isn't right. So trust your instincts!|`|VMlWSc2Paa	As hard as i is to admit yeah i pretty sure my BF has something going on he doesn't want me to know about. But each time i try to confront him about it he denies everything and twists it back to make me look bad....|`|NGE7nIhqaa	The reason most women know about that kind of thing more than men do is because they pay more attention to their significant other. There are always signs, if you look. So yes, I'm sure everyone could tell if they looked..|`|sCCjAKllaa	If their gestures, along with their overall character takes a 360 turn, then yes. That's a two way thing that "both" can pick up on.|`|p1gzHgAraa	i ALWAYS trust my "gut" instinct.. i am 32, and have learned through the years that is always right..

I love the slingshot idea!<br>  The glasses, good idea. Most places ask that you do something other than clink glasses anyways (they break lol)<br>  <br>  hmm, all I can think is pull out a chainsaw, but that won't work.  Can you find a mini chainsaw? lol. jk  Actually what you COULD do is pull out a chainsaw (without the chain on it for safety reasons). Rev it a few times as if that's what you're gonna use and then just use a normal knife afterwards.<br>  <br>  Oh, what about a sword? That'd be cool
T3d4iXGFaa	I understand your pain my brother, no one spends as much as my wife and I mean NO ONE!! But as much of pain as she is and does not understand the concept of money I WOULD NEVER LAY A HAND ON HER!! <br>  <br>  You need to see a anger counselor or someone to get your anger in check good luck.|`|Y9gy11rsaa	First of all you need to forget about the spending for the minute and deal with the fact that you hit her.  You need to speak to each other in a calm non threatening way - somewhere public if she's not feeling safe with you.  If she frightened then you need to accept that.<br>  <br>  The money issues are separate.  Maybe opening an account purely for the payment of bills is the way to go.  Set them all up by direct debit payment and lodge money to it each payday.  No cheque books on the account, no laser card, no online access to transfer funds - the only way to withdraw should be 2 signatures in the bank, in person.<br>  <br>  Hope you can work it out.|`|Ql0gi4rVaa	you absolutely must go see a professional<br>  you may also consider moving out immediately<br>  <br>  the only time a man can hit a woman is self defense (she is going to kill you) no other time<br>  <br>  you are way out of line!  You must manup and do the right thing<br>  it will take years to correct this mistake (maybe you will never recover from this) but you must take responsibility and get help immediately<br>  this is NOT acceptable behavior<br>  <br>  how would you feel if some guy hit your daughter or your mom?<br>  yeah i thought so <br>  so man up and go get help and MOVE out now!|`|Tyi6rEtcaa	Nope, I can't.....IF you're truthful with us here on answers, and I'm doubting your veracity, you swatted a woman like she was a man, full force.  Even though I am against hitting women at all, that is beyond the pale in anyone's book, FYI, and you should feel a right sh1t for having done so.  <br>  I'm underwhelmed with you altogether, whether you are for real, or trolling, makes me no never-mind, I feel about the same for both sorts of said pathetic creatures.<br>  Take note of my monicker, hey what?|`|04ZBuoqWaa	You can't really expect her to forgive you for that. Just b/c she pissed you off by calling you cheap is no reason to slap her. My husband gripes all the time b/c I spend money set aside for bills. I admit I have a problem and he admits he is stingy, but he has never slapped me for blowing money. Sounds to me like you need anger management classes and you both need marriage counseling.|`|Ot2tJXU2aa	Well, money is a stressful discussion, at least you feel guilt which shows you're not an animal, but please restrain yourself next time by just leaving the whole situation and venting it out in a healthy way like sports.  I think you should handle the money and the bills and give her a spending allowance especially because she can't control her spending and its affect your necessities like electricity and your temper.  And if last nites argument doesn't make her see how this stress's you then I would find some counseling resources if you can convince her what she's doing to your relationship is immature and she needs to some sound reasoning from an outsider.|`|4qLLQwToaa	I do understand that you are angry about your wife doing this, it is very wrong of her to spend money that is for bills etc. but it was bad of you to hit her. cant you both compromise by saying that she has a small allowance that is for her to spend? or maybe you should be in charge of paying the bills? or cant they be paid by direct debit at the bank?|`|AA10113995	well honestly, you can't nessesarily exspect her to just go out and forgive you.  As a matter of fact you'll be a very lucky man if she ever forgives you. Lying, and being rude is one thing, but once you pass that line and hit someone, its practiclly unforgivable.  Earning your trust back will be the hardest part.|`|d1acfd2b69dcb7239283328cfde761c5aa	First of all. There is NO excuse for EVERRRRR  hitting a female.   I dont care what she does or says.  Thats just not right.  It is good that you feel guilty and you SHOULD.  I dont know what to say to you that will make you feel better......

It sounds very sweet because she can keep them forever but I still think you should ge her a dozen of her favorite flowers.|`|5KcZNvN8aa	i wouldn't like it personally as i dont like people spending money on me...<br>  <br>  but thats not the point,<br>  she'll defiantly love that, so romantic :)|`|c9f2a1b3d1f4937e76dfc5f19e0e903daa	She will like that you went and got her a gift- no matter what it is.|`|2V7HRd7Vaa	i would love it!!|`|nTHPuF5Caa	Well yeah...<br>  <br>  I think she is gonna like it.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>   =]
af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	The "love you, but not in love" speech always means there's someone else. The phone sex was because she couldn't be there with him.<br>  <br>  Sorry.|`|FtyLwqR5aa	he sounds as if he is mentally messed up and he is emotional;y messing you up. go for counseling and see what happens after that.|`|AA10886262	that's messed up....totally!|`|LPEWAoWCaa	Men are pigs, he was thinking with his "other" head - be careful so you don't wind up even more hurt!|`|K8OjmMUAaa	I think you should just let him have his damn divorce, since he wants to go his own way and do his own thing and yet still mess with your head so you'll fill his sexual urges when there's no one else around. Seriously, what a JERK. Don't let him make you act like his slave! He's already disrespecting you - don't disrespect yourself as well. <br>  <br>  If he was still that interested in you, he'd still be with you. He said it himself: He's not in love with you anymore. But obviously he still thinks you're good enough to have sex with, even if you're not good enough to be married to anymore. THAT is what I would tell him next time he starts talking all sweet like that, and then I'd tell him I'll see him in court, and next time he wants phone sex to contact my attourney. <br>  <br>  Girl you deserve better than this! Let him go and move on with your life!|`|PHYj1UPwaa	He works with his parents??  and he is at a conference with his parents...and he sees his parents everyday...is this man married to his parents or to you??  He sounds like a child...OK...if this man is so set on the divorce..knowing you are pregnant with his child..I would give him a taste of his own medicine...I would not be so available to him..Stand up for yourself and your children and go find a backbone...I would not answer the telephone just because he called...I would get a lawyer and get my share of the divorce including alimony and child support and I would go forward with the divorce...He's pathethic...|`|sCCjAKllaa	That's really ashame. It's like you're important to him, but not enough. I really don't understand why, though. Everything you've described doesn't sound like someone who wants a divorce, but someone who's okay with playin mind games, and it's pretty sad. You can "probably" change his mind, but you really shouldn't exert yourself too much.|`|AA10684513	You need to tell him that he is either a husband or a friend.  Nothing in the middle.|`|DNwHGeEtaa	Why does he want a divorce? My suggestion for you is that, since he said he didn't know what you could do to change his mind, then don't do anything. Play hard to get. You may talk to him sometimes, but don't always let him get what he wants. When he says he wants a divorce, just tell him if that's what he wants you'll give it to him. <br>  <br>  If he still finds you sexually attractive, he'll come back to you. Just let him make an effort to get you. If next time he wants a phone sex, tell him that you only give it to your husband who's not filing for divorce. He can't have it both way. If he chooses the divorce, he can't have you anymore. Make it clear to him. Don't always let him get what he wants.|`|UFOdwXgfaa	I am sorry to say this to you but big warning bell should go off. This is one of the most consistent things a cheating spouse will say. It is often said by a spouse going through midlife crisis also. Your spouse may have a deep, loving bond with you but, intense feelings of passion can override the bond with you and cause your spouse to loose sight of his feelings. The passion they feel in their new relationship can cause some much-skewed thinking.<br>  <br>  The “I love you but I’m not in love with you,” statement is a sign that something is wrong in the marriage. View it as an opportunity to open up to your spouse about how you feel in the relationship. When hearing such a statement it is easy to become panicked, to go on the defensive and react in a negative way. You need to not only say what is on your mind but to also listen to what your spouse has to say.<br>  <br>  Good luck and get some marriage counseling.|`|zMg4hQwDaa	get a good lawyer, tell him divorce means that you are his ex wife not a friend with benefits. he is trying to get you to go easy on him through the divorce and then he will never be nice again, he won't have to. so tell him that you either are married or he must go away and leave you in peace. tell him you will be looking for a real partner that is there for you. start dating, see how he likes that one. do not be soft on him.
tvK1xjzkaa	Your scared that you won't be able to do it on your own, and trust me honey if you are dealing with this douche bag I know you can make it on  your own. Leave him you don't want your children to think this is what life is about. Love your self and  your children enough to care and leave for a brighter future.|`|HQKuzxulaa	I hate to say it, but things aren't going to get better. Leave for the sake of your children who deserve better. Your husband needs to contact AA, but I doubt that he will. You've got to leave him with his problem, maybe when he finds himself all alone he' ll decide to do something about it. In the meantime you can't force this situation on your kids. All the very best. Good luck.|`|sXnoIFRsaa	Your husband has a disease it is called Alcoholism and you need to go seek help.  Check out your local AlAnon chapter they will give you the tools you need in order to better yourself and move onto what is right for you and your family|`|TUNvbXbgaa	you need to leave him. why put your children through that?   get a lawyer as soon as you can and file.  i was married to an abusive drunk.  sometime leaving is the only thing you can do. he has to help himself.|`|sCCjAKllaa	Of course you should leave. You should never want to expose your kids to anything relating to alchohol, and he's a jerk for that.|`|scnW0Wzeaa	Dump the drunk. You will be doing the kids a favor.|`|7U31NpCnaa	are you working<br>  if you are working and able to manage  then leave|`|V8DXcVlOaa	I lived this life for 12 years with my ex-husband and leaving wasn't easy however after making every attempt I could make to get him the help he needed and failed I had no choice.  My children did not need to see their father drunk every night.  My children did not need to listen to us fight about his drinking all the time.  My children deserved better then that and as much as it broke my heart I had to realize I could not help him if he wasn't going to help himself.  I went to Al-Anon twice a week and yes they will give you suggestion on how to deal with living with an alcoholic but is this the way you really want to live your life.  Is this the life you want for your children?  I can tell you without a doubt my children are much happier now that they aren't subjected to their fathers drinking everyday.  They are finally happy go lucky children that don't have to come home afraid of what is going to happen when Dad gets home.  <br>  <br>  Honey, trust me when I tell you there is nothing in the world you can do to make him change.  You can't get him to stop nor can you make him do something he isn't ready to do.  Alcholism is a disease, a very treatable one but not without his willingness to get help for it and by the sounds of it his is no where near ready for that help.  My suggestion is walk away, get yourself and your children out of that situation and start living your life again.  In the long run you will be much happier as will your children.  I also would suggest going to Al-Anon, you will be surround by people that are living it or have lived it and you will get a great deal of support from them, support that you will need in order to get through this but you will get through it.  <br>  <br>  I will keep you in my thoughts and I wish you the best of luck!!!|`|Bg0ZGNY7aa	wow um this is an extremely hard question because you love him and you are pregnant with other kids already or ya whatever you get it<br>  well if he's abusive don't need any kind just abusive then leave him if he's ever cheated then leave him if you scared for your kids because of him then leave him maybe you can stay at your mothers house or a friends house it depends if you have any where to fall back on or maybe you have money then get a apartment or make him get one you are the women so just read this and think and good luck<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  goooooooooooood luck!!!!!!!!!!|`|AA11602080	If he loves you he'll stop drinking and go to AA meetings.  He will also go willingly to marriage counseling appointments with you.  If he's not willing to do either one, he cares about no one but himself.  If that's the case then take your kids and get out of the situation before it turns volatile.  My father was an alcoholic and he beat my mother and us kids when he was drunk just because he could.  If you love your kids as well as yourself you will prevent living that horror.|`|c9f2a1b3d1f4937e76dfc5f19e0e903daa	Go to Al Anon and get help for yourself.  That is a group of other men and women with spouses who are alcoholic.  It may help you feel a lot better knowing that you are not alone.<br>  Being a single mom of three kids may be really hard.  Think about all of the pros and cons.  It might be harder for the kids if you get divorced.  I am not saying you should absolutly stay with him--- just think that staying with him should be an option.|`|y43tzOQlaa	Before I even read the 11 answers you already got, I will say this, your children deserve better and so do you. Yes it's hard, yes it sucks, but the only change that will happen is what YOU DO! It can't be left to him, his choices are his, he can only change when and if he wants to. Alcoholics are selfish, it is a very selfish disease. You need to get a support system. Good luck.|`|Gzk1TQFAaa	For a more informed and probably wiser answer, I recommend  that you talk to someone in your community who is experienced with alcohol and family problems.  Someone who can REALLY help.  If you're a Christian, a pastor could be a good choice. Another option available is to look-up Social Services in your local directory.  This won't go away without some good intervention, so act soon.  Good luck and God bless.|`|6VZGYCZcaa	My mother left my father when I was about five years old due to a drug problem. It was very hard for me at the time and I really didn't understand why we were leaving. Here I am 20 years old and he is still doing it. I know now why she left him and I am glad she did. I could not have pictured growing up in his house with him doing these things. You cannot force them to get help and if they do not get help they will not stop on their own. You have to think about what is best for you and your kids. Good luck!|`|zMg4hQwDaa	your first mistake is the"I have another kid on the way bs" if he is sooo bad why do you keep reproducing with him. hello, use birth control. <br>  You need to learn to leave and be a grown up for them.

His only concern and I do mean only, is where the next drink is coming from. Wouldn't you tell her that there is nothing she can do or say to stop the drinking, it has to come from him?Wouldn't you ask her to give you one valid reason why she and her children should stay? Wouldn't you tell her she has an obligation to her children and remind of the chance they could be taken away?Wouldn't you tell her that if she can't  get up the gumption to at least for her children's sake she is being selfish and only thinking of herself?|`|3SSVBJAqaa	Stop thinking about yourself and how much you love him and start thinking about how much better your children deserve.

y4XOGjPPaa	Be EXTREMELY careful. You sound very trusting of others, but not of yourself. Your conscience is trying to warn you of something, that is why you are nervous. This man may be married or a sex offender, who knows? I know that sounds harsh, but that is the reality of it. MOST men who do online dating are married - that is a proven statistic that I just read. Please trust yourself. Go to a crowded area, like a mall, when you meet him. Don't give out any info - like your address, where you work, etc. And please, please, don't go somewhere private with him. Make sure there are lots of people around at all times. 33 is bit old for you, by the way. Look for men closer to your age and you won't regret it.  Sorry for being so harsh, but I know that men put on whatever persona you want them to be online and usually are not sincere - why should they be? Are you a bit of a people-pleaser? It sounds like you are putting his needs before your own - you are worried about looking like an idiot but ignoring the voice inside of you that is saying "He's too old for you". You make excuses for him "but he is a good person" - how do you know that - you have never met him. Find your backbone and don't give yourself away so easily. Trust in YOU, have confidence in yourself and trust that voice inside of you. I apologize once again for sounding cruel, but I am truly concerned about you and your safety.|`|PfP8LSF6aa	You know what you should do, get one of your friends to be there with you and him. And when you feel comfortable enough around him and you calmed down, ask her to leave. It's that simple. He won't mind it either, he is scared to death too believe me, he won't show it but he is.|`|4EWCegiRaa	"Also this meeting has nothing to do with anything sexual, so please don't think like that."<br>  <br>  He's driving to another state to see you... you don't think that's crossed his mind or might even be his motivation?  <br>  <br>  I'm not saying you should go into this with a closed mind but I don't think you should be naive either.<br>  <br>  The best advice I can give:  Just be yourself.  At the end of the day, he needs to see the real you in order to decide if he likes you (and you need to be yourself in order to decide if you like him).  It'll work out if it's supposed to work out.|`|mshPaOeHaa	A date is a date. After all, you are meeting him for the first time. So older guy or younger, it is perfectly normal to feel the jitters. Just keep your calm. And since you know that he is a good guy, you don't need to worry. Just look forward to the meeting. For all you know, he might be feeling nervous too!|`|jVUEohsNaa	I met my wife online, match.com, seven years ago... she was 19 and I was 42.... and we are VERY happy.<br>  <br>  Just take it slow, and if he is a gentleman about everything, then you should be okay...
8XKmMBU7aa	You are brilliant baby.<br>  I will say you baby brilliant<br>  <br>  have a nice day and nice dream.|`|f21c4568248ded0eeab01a76d3a81476aa	I'm Chinese and Black myself and in grade school everyone gets teased.  The next time they "whipser" something, turn around and confront them nice and loud but in control.  Ask them why they have a problem with your race, loud enough that other around can hear.  Tell them to stop being racist b!tches already because it just makes them look like idiots.  This should shut them up, but if it doesn't just don't back down, kid.  Draw your line in the sand and never let anyone cross it.  You gotta stick up for yourself.  Trust me, it gets better.  Be proud your black/asian, when you get older all the guys will want you.  Just don't be arrogant.|`|DBVJ7AIMaa	Speak to a teacher. All schools have an anti-bullying policy, and this is bullying.<br>  Hold on to the thought that they are jealous of you. You obviously make then feel threatened, so you must be a nicer prettier person, with a more interesting background.<br>  Racists are the lowest of the low and have very little going for them apart from their bigoted ideology.<br>  I know it's easier said than done, but don't let them get to you, and speak to someone.|`|VEgv5NhSaa	No!<br>  You be yourself im half and half (half asian and half english)<br>  <br>  and im proud!<br>  <br>  They seem like sado mates who need to get a life, dump them!!|`|q0b6uPCraa	Tell dahling. I know you dont want to but bullying is against the law. It's called Racism. Tell your mom and your teacher.|`|G2NoXxDVaa	they are just ignorant<br>  i think that mixed race people are pretty exotic<br>  be proud of who you are<br>  ignore them|`|i4bjQbPcaa	Right first of all, how can the colour of your skin or your race make you bad?  <br>  <br>  Please tell your teachers what is going on, these girls are racially abusing you and that is against the law. Your school needs to act on this.  <br>  <br>  Good luck, they are probably jealous because they spend their lives looking orange from cheap fake tan trying to make themselves look darker and end up with conjunctivitis from sharing eye liner to make their eyes look asian.|`|G32X9fnZaa	Believe me I know there are still racists around.I am a very proud white Mum of a mixed race boy.These are stupid little girls who have no respect for anyone,not even themselves.Much as you don't want to make waves they cannot continue to do this to you.Ignore them.Do not get into a slanging match with them.Please tell a teacher and do things in a proper way.I am sure the school does not want a reputation for condoning racism.Tell your parents also please.|`|2lCM1agNaa	I'm full black but was brought up in a white community where there were no blacks. I have a light complexion so was often called biracial or black offensive names. People made fun of my hair, skin colour, lips - you name it. I had so called 'friends' who used to say they were cool with me but used to make fun of my looks and then turn round and say they were just joking. It used to really really hurt; they claimed to be my friend when they were actually very racist. Masked racism is the worst because when you try to reason with it, they claim to still be your friend. Boys in the class used to talk out loud about the hottest girls in school and list me as the bottom because I was 'ugly and had wiry hair'. It was awful. I did everything I could to fit it - straightened my hair, tried to lose weight (I got curvy very early in school) - the whole thing was a bad influence on my self esteem. But luckily I had some great supportive friends, teachers and a great family who helped me with how to handle things (including how to effectively stick up for myself without ever having to get physical; if done smartly it can earn you waaay more respect before things get verbally abusive and even physical).<br>  <br>  You have to remember that a lot of the time, people will lash out because you are different. Your ethnicity might threaten them, make them jealous or they just won't understand it because you are not 'generic'. I found this out when I got older. When I left school and went to uni, there was never any shortage of men who told me how beautiful I was and who wanted (and still do) want to be with me. At school, people are cruel and many are ignorant. <br>  <br>  I'm happy you can voice your unhappiness because that is one step towards getting the matter resolved. You really have to make a point of bringing this up with your guidance teacher in confidence, if it is a group of people bothering you it will be hard for you to fight it alone. Tell your parents what you are going through, and don't be afraid to do it, that is what parents are for, they love you dearly and will support you. The main problem is when people do not acknowledge or report that they are being bullied, and this is where the downward spiral can get really bad.<br>  <br>  However, never ever ever forget how beautiful you are! A lot of the most beautiful people on this planet are mixed race and many have had to fight through similar problems and have made it far in this world. Don't let them get you down! You do sound gorgeous though - Taiwanese and black - that sounds like an exotic combination. Embrace it and don't let anyone tell you different.|`|AA12221556	They are jealous.  I'm Italian.  My boyfriend mixed.  We have 2 beautiful children.  I wish I was mixed.  They have the best of both worlds!  I love their complexion.  <br>  <br>  You have to be gorgeous.  Asian & Black.  Be proud of what you are.  Your parents made you.  Not everyone is going to like you, to bad for them.  Stand confident.  When you hear them talk about you..say don't hate me cuz you ain't me.  Stand up for yourself!  Some people are just ignorant.  You should pray for these lost people.  They need help!!!!<br>  <br>  Have you ever said the serenity prayer?<br>  <br>  God grant me the serenity<br>  to accept the things I cannot change (people's ignorance)<br>  courage to change the things I can<br>  and the wisdom to know the difference<br>  <br>  These unfortunate people will have to deal w/ God.  People can be so mean!<br>  <br>  You should tell your parents.  I know if my sons get made fun of I want to know.  I would be really upset.|`|B3CvI9RHaa	heres where i come in:<br>  <br>  I am a BBC-  A British Born Chinese =]<br>  <br>  I come from an area, where there are 98% + white people.<br>  Also because the people dont go around the country much, they see all coloured skin ppl as either sick/disgusting/freaks. <br>  <br>  I've felt like the way you feel for 13 years mate...and i've been called all sorts of name and like you the girls espiecally hurt the most, cos you know, a lad has gotta have high self esteem to get along well...<br>  <br>  i'll tell u something though- it worked for me might not work for some other ppl- <br>  <br>  i took several kung-fu classes when i were younger- so i could defend myself from bullies if need be. i didnt get high only to the middle (red belt).<br>  <br>  i was smart for my age then- sorry if i sound stuckup- and i soon became a teacher's pet with little/no effort at all...<br>  <br>  the way i saw things then was- you can't be too smart (because people will pick on you) and you can't be too popular (because in the "popular" word i meant, popular but dumb) <br>  <br>  and so i changed my ways. i stayed smart, but revised less (enough to scrape an B-A*). Kept people's secret, kept out of their way and dont shy away from dirty looks, rude comments etc etc. They wil only intimidate the bullies worse. <br>  <br>  When i became 14...my life changed =]. i had some "friends" but i was still careful-  you can't tell them eveyrthing beacuse like in movies...they can spill out ur worst secrets with no remorse"<br>  <br>  and now i'm 15 going on to 16...i've been out with them and even started talkin to girls. The girls who used to call me freaks...now look at me with new eyes. <br>  <br>  Achieve this and you'll be fine =]<br>  <br>  EDIT: because u remind me of me...i will tell u something else.<br>  ACHIEVE the friendship with the people's friends. Espiacally one in high places (in school). Then instead of working up...you can work down ;)<br>  <br>  if u understand that =] u are definetly in the way to greatness =]<br>  <br>  BTW- For all asian people. a good hairstyle is amust ;) and fashionable taste (still trying to achieve this though haha)<br>  <br>  good luck mate =] and gimme best answers for my efforts xD<br>  <br>  EDIT NUMBER 2: 1 MORE THING!!!! Dont go to teachers when you're getting bullied. Teachers are useless and can make matters worse (9 times out of 10 in my experience). Sort them out yourself...though leave the ones with the petty comments alone. they're not worth it. if they come up to you and full on punch you...then fight. Earn Their Respect. Dont kill'em though or hurt them enough for people to be scared of you =]
OpduZC3Eaa	I've stabbed with ballpoint pens and pencils among other things.<br>  <br>  I've thrown random objects.|`|NeTNnvSZaa	That's called spousal abuse, would you think it so funny if a man used a frying pan on a woman?|`|gPYTkIW2aa	A while back before my parent were married, before they even met, she was dating this guy that was a total prick. He cheated on her more then once and all this. Well she finally got sick of it and threw her coffee at him. Well she missed and hit the guy sitting behind her boyfriend. Well that guy got up and was like what on earth. And my mom was so angry and upset and embarrassed she said, "I was trying to hit my cheating boyfriend but I missed, I'm soo sorry." He looked at her boyfriend and was like, "this guy here?" she nodded and he grabbed her boyfriend by the collar and said right into his face, "Guys are meant to be gentleman. You are scum for making this beautiful lady cry. Apologize and say you will stay out of her life." He was all shocked and mumbled I'm sorry. (mostly because this guy was huge and obviously fit because he was a karate student/teacher for years) Well my mom and this guy started talking and lo and behold here I am years later, the result of their marriage!<br>  <br>  <br>  also, he's not a karate teacher now. He's a priest. He did karate when he was younger and just stayed in shape. Thought that was funny.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: Thank you AJ. They do love eachother :)|`|bO2rzfISaa	I wish I'd hit him right in the mouth with it yesterday instead of listening to all the abuse. Today he's all back to normal but I can't forget the vitriol that came out of his mouth.|`|gLXzVbm8aa	i have thrown stuff at my boyfriend. one time we were fighting and i threw a hamburger at him.|`|zhaHc4FAaa	Nowadays, people use guns in place of the frying pan.    How sad.<br>  Cool off before doing something foolish|`|mF0L5jMNaa	Who hasn't wanted to take a kitchen implement to someone else!  However, assault and battery is a crime whether it's your husband or not.|`|4Zdp7fu9aa	Emmy J. <br>  <br>  Loved ur comment is so romantic wow ur mom must love ur father more than ever... <br>  <br>  Hhahahha no i dont hit my husband with pans and other stuff i just argue and i always get him badly with words..:P
59787f4f0e10a8b5f99f5409e4580213aa	you are correct|`|LDLTjNCraa	That's a good attitude to have.<br>  Maybe there wouldn't be as many young teen pregnancies if everyone thought like that.|`|UcgWrGaAaa	You are showing great wisdom Grasshopper.<br>  <br>  You are absolutly right when people start dating much too young all they have to show for it is a string of ex's and they can also get very hardened to the whole idea of love.  And oh yes, then there's the pressure to have sex.  Really, you are doing the right thing.  Dating is really for grown ups.|`|KFUsmwItaa	If that's the age you wanna start dating that's the age you can start. Most of the time though you find someone you really like and maybe wanna date him before your 17. Just date when you feel comfortable with it.|`|8QEtcKhnaa	There is nothing to rush for you have your whole life a head of you. Focus on education and wealth. More meaningful relationships will come your way once you really know who you are and have achieved real goals|`|62bdfaff99eb94891a0098fdd62fe168aa	You have your own feelings stick by them - don't let peer pressure make you do things that are not what you want.|`|xs9L4eGpaa	im 17 and nothing yet xD<br>  <br>  who gives a shi* iv got better things to do|`|R5IAmQAVaa	Dating takes a lot of experience to get right... you don't just jump in and everything is good.  You need time to learn what you like, learn to be in a relationship, learn what adjustments you need to make.  What you are asking of doing is like saying, "I want to be a professional basketball player, but I'm going to wait until I graduate highschool to start practcing."  If you wait too long, nobody is going to want to date you.<br>  <br>  If you are looking for a mature, serious, and long haul relationship... you are going to have to go WAY past 17 anyway.   Mature and serious relationships don't start until you have established an adult life.... live on your own, pay your own bills, have a career.  I'm 31 now, and started dating when I was 14.  I went through several relationships and didn't have an "adult" relationship until I was in my 20's.  And if you wait that long, who is going to want to date someone that has never dated before?  <br>  <br>  The whole point is that those 1 day relationships are the stepping stones to get to adult relationships... you just can't skip over them.  They may be stuipd, but they certainly aren't a waste of time.  They are learning expereince.  They teach you valuable things about who you are as a person and what you are looking for in a person.   If you skip having them at 13, you will end up having them later in life.  Might as well get them out of the way so that when you do become a mature adult, you will be ready to have a mature relationship.<br>  <br>  Don't rush yourself into something if you aren't ready for it... but don't hold off because you think you can simply jump in at 17 and everything will be all "grown up" and happy.|`|OIAODVcHaa	I couldn't agree more. I'm 13, and I've got a long way to go before I start wanting to date someone. I haven't set an actual age limit for myself, but I think 17 is an OK age to date. I have a list of all the things that a guy has to be before I would marry him. I've vowed to myself that i will not date anyone who i would not be interested in marrying. What's the point? why would you get intimate with someone you're not going to spend the rest of your life to? Why would you put that sort of temptation in front of yourself willingly? <br>  To me dating is so much more important than people give it credit for. I think at my age there are far more reasons NOT to date than to date. I hate all the middle school drama that comes along with "dating" a bunch of immature little boys with no ideals. What are you to them? What makes you want to date them? What do you think you will get out of a relationship with them?|`|mtOVRAnbaa	Well... i happen to think for a 13 year old you seem very MATURE.. and I think that if you see that you want something more serious and your not ready for the "puppy love" phase then I admire you! I think that's a really good way of thinking... @ 13, 14, 15, and 16.. and EVEN OLDER.. teens DONT realize that when you start a relationship.. DO YOU really think your going to marry that person and spend the rest of your life with that person?? Chances are helllllll no it aint gonna happen.. Even if your 25 chances are your not going to meet the person your going to be with forever... It takes alot of things to keep a relationship going.. and as a teen you dont really know of anything besides holding hands and who your going to see at the next football game...<br>  <br>  I ADMIRE YOU =) good luck hun!|`|4NcshCDvaa	I was just friends with guys until I found the right one. <br>  <br>  I was best friends with him for over a year before we got into a relationship and I was 18...almost 19.<br>  There is nothing wrong with waiting. <br>  <br>  And if it isnt going to go anywhere then why date?<br>  You can hang out with a guy and not date..<br>  <br>  I dont have multiple exs and I found the ONE without dating around.<br>  <br>  <br>  And he did the same thing so neither of us have to worry  about stupid exs causing fights or anything!|`|Ww7CyyALaa	That is perfectly acceptable, when you feel you are ready to date and your parents agree then go for it..... if you date when your not ready your not going have fun...... And trust me dating can be really fun|`|5LWq12epaa	I agree, I am 13 also, and I have only had stupid relationships, so I stopped dating 4 awhile|`|scnW0Wzeaa	I started dating at 13 and became a father .|`|pWxhivTIaa	whatever is right for you, is right for you --- wait til you're 17 - that's fine|`|fLU63N4kaa	Dating = unnecessary drama, especially at such a young and immature age (in my opinion 13-21ish). Don't waste your time!<br>  <br>  Concentrate on school, get good results, get into a good college, studying something you really love and then you can start looking for mature, meaningful relationships if that's what you want.<br>  <br>  And don't feel obliged/pushed to start having relationships because it's the norm in school. You're much better off on your own right now.|`|Di6FAQxRaa	yes 17 or 18, and even when you start dating at that age the guys are still not mature,lol...Age 21 is even better because you can date older , mature men and experience life in a whole new way. So wait you are too yung. Play with you dolls and toys and enjoy being a child. Life is too short, dating should not be allowed at your age group. The girls in your school are fast sluts, dont be like them. Its good to be different. You be different !|`|oQkwZhXpaa	Hehe I know exactly how you feel..I'm 16 and I have never had a boyfriend..like you say its better off to wait until you're older and more mature when everyone has grown up a bit and you can actually enjopy something meaningful =]<br>  <br>  You're 13 years old..live life a bit first...have fun..go out and enjoy yourself and do the things you can't do when your in a relationship with someone :) and do what you want. Ignore it if people say you should go out with someone because its your choice. But equally dont let a good opportunity pass..if someone nice comes along dont reject them just because your not 17 or whatever..made that mistake a couple of months ago and I'm still regretting it now lol. <br>  <br>  You have an intelligent head on your shoulders obviously..let that develop and dont worry about boys just yet lol.<br>  <br>  Good luck and have fun :)|`|cwuBl93Zaa	Well in my opinion, it is always good to have some kind of experience in a younger age because then if you get into a relationship when you are older you would be able to pick and choose the people that are more mature or still act like they are 13. it doesnt kill you if you tried to date anyone. remember life is short and we are never guaranteed tomorrow, so live life at the fullest. (but keep it legal ;] )|`|9624d1b569ca710536d56a309ae51f7aaa	Good for you!<br>  Dating is always associated with some form of sexuality. In the beginning it starts with WOW she or he is Hot... attractive. Then rapidly moves on toward the temptation thing.<br>  If you start too early.. what happens when the Dating thing looses its appeal and the temptation thing goes beyond just internal desire? I think you know what comes next.<br>  <br>  At 13 or 14 or even 17 go for courtship then date in large groups.|`|AA10698189	I dont think its something you plan.  It all depends.  I didnt start dating till I was 17, even though guys were interested but I wasnt ready (or allowed).  I do think 13 is too young though - I think its nice to just surround yourself with both male and female friends and have fun! When that special someone comes along then you will not even have to question it!  No rush though!|`|34ikhhtMaa	Iam 17 and I started dateing at 16. I am the same way, I like older more seriousy(but funny too) guys. I felt the same way about guys at 13, I thought they were imature and STUPID(they are lol) Guys are not good in relationships till they are older. So stay single and live your life, anyways your only 13!!!<br>  Jamie|`|8HQLhCI0aa	ya .17. that's great Ur really mature  ..<br>  u know whats best for you ..<br>  and if your not interested well do do it ..<br>  yea couples at that age are just childish nothing to serious.<br>  well i am 17 and still had childish bfs ..<br>  it all depends in the guys and how the relationship is going .. <br>  best of luck ..<br>  ur really smart ..=)|`|sEryEzoyaa	i agree with u! i mean i like hanging out with guys now and i have guys who are my friends, but i m not gonna date till i m 18... so yes i think u madea great choice... good for u! oh and btw i m 15...|`|x851kjHuaa	its up to you if you think you should wait till your 17 no one can tell you anything, but you will never know if a guy is serious or mature if your with him (going out) because guys always act different when they have a chick|`|hiJCkXX0aa	AGREED! YOUR STILL YOUNG SO ENJOY YOUR TEENAGE YEARS. YOU HAVE PLENTY OF TIME LATER ON IN LIFE TO DATE.  I DIDNT DATE ANYONE TIL I WAS 17! & IVE BEEN WITH HIM TIL NOW. IM 18 NOW.

VERY VERY SMART!

Have friends and have fun but save dating for when you are ready to find a man to spend your life with. Then don't waste time on non-men who are all action but no talk or depth. Be the best person you can be, then set out to find your equal. Don't settle for less.|`|MQJQDBONaa	That's an excellent idea, and really really mature too. I agree with you btw :) I'm 16 and I felt the same the past couple of years....those silly little immature relationships are more trouble than they are worth.  The only major benefit I can see is that it's a confidence booster to be able to say you've had a bf/gf.<br>  <br>  Although when you get your first bf at 16 and you're the last one of your friends to date someone....there is some teasing goes on! Especially if you date your best friend! Lol sorry just had to add that bit!|`|BQ7P9QvBaa	so dont date yet! if your friends at school are pressuring you just tell them, "nah! there are some HOTT guys out there but im too busy." and if you do get ready to date, be the first couple in your school to last over a week, then month, even a year! it is a good road and a fun game to outdue all the other couples :D|`|okXvWN5haa	you cant really take advice from other people, about wen you should start looking for love. dont set an age for yourself.cuz im sure that someone will come along  sooner than that, and you will want to date them. you can set the time, for it to be the rightt time. it just comes to you..|`|gMO08cFdaa	I started dating pretty young, and you're right - it was SO STUPID !<br>  you're better off waiting - highschool years in general is probably the best time to consider relationships.|`|kw15nA5jaa	there's plenty of time for guys... you're 13. focus on school, sports, your friends, video games, the mall... etc... be a kid and enjoy it|`|lMtFlVDUaa	well at 13 why bother. there's no need to date people at your age (sorry to sound all momish) seriously leave it to later..|`|979090faf6f85c0f0923e03261b8a308aa	u remind me of myself lol <br>  <br>  its all good dating isn't worth it wehn you that old anyway too much drama X)|`|8hw2IKasaa	yes around 17...make sure u have a down pact on your education first.<br>  =]<br>  its the best way to go.|`|opT8Uc8Paa	15-16 but thats just my opinion.|`|94C2U5FLaa	why is this qeustion on yahoo answers?! no one is forcing u to date at 13!!!!

You'll need to find a counsellor in your area, so try your GP to see if they can recommend any. Your mother is probably just worried about you, so open up to her and she can help you. With good counselling, support from your family and friends and determination you will get over this. Good luck xx|`|AA10500537	go  admit yourself in a rehab   get help if not you;ll be dead by the time youre 21 .<br>  please do this now .   your mom isnt giving  you enough supervision|`|AA12398373	I think you are an awesome kid.<br>  The reason I say that is because of your elevated self-awareness, and maturity.<br>  <br>  It's a big step to recognize that there's a problem, and an even bigger step to decide you are ready to change it. The behaviours you are exhibiting are those of an addict, and I don't mean just the drugs and alcohol, but the self harm is also an addiction too.<br>  <br>  I totally support your intention to see a councillor, but where you go for that depends on where you live and what is available there.<br>  I think a good place to start would be for you to take your concerns to your mother. I know you probably don't like the sound of that, and there's a logical reason why you might not. It's the shame.<br>  It's not unusual for an addict to try to hide their addiction from those they are close to, and it's mainly because they are ashamed of the things they are doing, and what they have done in the past.<br>  The biggest problem with being ashamed, and keeping this a secret is that you are trying to face one of the most important issues of your life ALONE!<br>  <br>  But it doesn't have to be that way.<br>  Standing up and facing your issues head on is a very brave thing to do. With bravery comes pride, because you have every right to be proud of yourself for reaching this turning point, and pride trumps shame every time.<br>  <br>  Go to your mom, I urge you.<br>  Her initial reaction may not be pleasant, but no matter what, she loves you and cares about you, and once what you have told her sinks in, she will turn her attention to one thing and one thing only, and that will be to help you get through this.<br>  <br>  Take care and be well! ;-)|`|ccs5VkRgaa	well think about it. Do you think the drinking and the weed smoking is a reason or problem why you don't get along with you mom or your distration in school?<br>  -have some self control.<br>  -don't always try to take the easy way out because the easy way isn't always the better way.<br>  -spend time with you mom trying telling her how you feel, comunicate with her, your mom can actually help you with the habits you have.<br>  -see the good things in you, think positive about yourself, instead of thinking about the things you can't do...think of the things you have accomplished...and move forward!<br>  your young your 16, enojoy life with family and friends but not with things that can harm you! well thats my opinion!|`|5593cbf55deeaf4344a8bf599a5164c3aa	You PRETEND to have a relationship with your mother? Is there any chance that your mother could be a controlling person?  Are you really sure that you are happy? Does she know that you drink and smoke or do you feel that you have to hide this from her? Some of the symptoms that you explained lead me to believe that you are being controlled in your life and have no say so over yourself.|`|Y9gy11rsaa	Hi hun, first of all - congratulations for realising you're on the wrong road and asking for some help.  My daughter went through something similar just last year and is now doing great - no smoking, no drinking and doing really well in school so don't lose hope!<br>  <br>  Firstly, do you think you could tell your mom what you've been doing and ask for her help?  That would be the best thing to do.  If not then look in your local telephone book under counselling or local newspapers often advertise for The Samaritans or a similar organisation geared towards young adults.  Just phone any of them even if you feel they're not right for you they'll point you in the right direction.<br>  <br>  You sound like you really want to start fresh.  Just remember it can be difficult, you may need to break away from some friends and feel lonely sometimes until you make new friends but stick with it and it will all be worth it - I promise!
VZVGXRyraa	They allow it because it's purely sexual...no strings attached, feel good moments. Some girls just need these one time moments and they trust gay guys more than straight guys to keep it to a one time thing instead of expecting to get more. <br>  <br>  It doesn't take a genius to know that if a girl wants no strings attached sex with a straight guy, that the straight guy will want more later on and then the girl will have to deal with rejecting him. With a gay guy, more than likely...they have sex and that's it, a past action, probably never to be repeated again.|`|ew3Wl6hKaa	sexual play?? Im not sure exactly what that means but I've had gay friends who I've allowed to spank my butt or grab my boobs but I would never allow a straight guy to do that.....it just seems allowable simply because I know they weren't doing it with a sexual intention they were just fooling around but I would never take it further than that.....cuz u never know!!!!! (and im not slutty like that)|`|5h0nUQODaa	hmm. i'm not sure i quite understand your question<br>  <br>  but.. it has always been the case that one day, I would sleep with my gay best friend - just as experience for him.|`|6UmRmaeWaa	I am VERY open minded to different situations but...I don't want to be with gay men because I want it to be all about me! I want the attention, plus i think if i were welcoming others into the bedroom it would be another woman not man.<br>  <br>  Sorry I think I answered your question.|`|WfxpiomNaa	i LOVE gay men as friends, but i am not turned on by them ONE bit.|`|ZzfLnSjUaa	my reason is bcuz im into men only nd dat does not include bi or gay men|`|goe3y4FPaa	well.. cause gay guys wont have sex with them.. and there like girls..|`|AA12266415	My, you have a lot of questions.  First and foremost... most people have a sexual preference.  Those who say they are "bi" more than likely are not... they prefer someone of the same gender, they just do not want the criticismm... bottom linee, everyone chooses one side or the other at some point. :)    And as for women who "hang" with the gay boys -- they normally called fag hags... and if they are having sex with gay men... then shame on them -- they obviously cannot find what they are really looking for.  Most gay women who hang with the gay boys -- it does not necessarily mean they are having sex... they just want to say they have a "man" on their arm.  I have gay male friends... but I would not pretend to have them as my boyfriends..  Maybe today's younger women are changing.. who knows..  Like with anything -- there are personal preferences and choices we all make -- you have to decide if what your friends are about -- if what is right for you.|`|ztW4Pvjoaa	okay...Im not really sure I understand what you are asking? do you mean that some girls find it okay to "mess around" with their gay guy friends and you want to know why that is okay? If so...girls love attention. we love compliments and too feel beautiful. Many gay friends love giving attention to their straight girlfriends. It is not really sexual in nature, no one gets "turned on" if that is what you are worried about. If you have a girlfriend who flirts with her gay guy friends...i assure you it is honest fun and no harm however if it makes you uncomfortable then out of respect he/she should stop.|`|6004ba9ae9f5a0152f95a388ddabc367aa	all women are not like this I am not but i guess its because they might be wanting the attention without the commitment.women like attention we want to feel loved and needed men one day might figure this out.sometimes if you befriend a gay you will know hes gay i was friends with a few and believe me they were gay|`|opT8Uc8Paa	they know a gay guy wont be staring at there **** or *** when there out doing something since there not interested. Bi or not i guess you're never 100% sure of you just go by what he says giving him your trust. <br>  <br>  and im not sure if that's how it is with girls being lesbians and guys being straight. i think that's just a gay guy girl acceptance.|`|gCCkDLMHaa	i mean i am not like that because what would they gay guy be doning while my boyfriend was in there u know stick his thing in my boyfriend *** dont think so now another guy that is nt gay that would be kool. well kinda but sex, its somthing that only is supose to be share with the one that you love your life long partner...................ha ha who am i kiding sex is sex. the whole gay guy thing no going there... sticking his dick up my boyfriends *** no way i kool its all gravy lol,|`|pFkGJlntaa	Some women just like the company of gay guys because of how they are - they give opinions, etc.. whatever you like about gay men. The only way to be sure if they are 100% gay is to ask them.|`|9BoHoOUDaa	if a man is 1% gay he is 100% gay.<br>  <br>  If he even thinks about touching another guys junk stay away from him because there is a 70% chance he will eventually get AIDS
ihe7xV6Raa	it sounds like she's into u<br>  <br>  call her or something|`|jsabaPqCaa	It doesnt seem like she wants to be with you alone, as shes always with her friend and your mate when shes around you, and once they've gone, she wants to go.<br>  <br>  This could be anything tho. could be that she wants to feel safe as she doesnt know you that well, so doesnt want to be alone with you. <br>  <br>  Is she interested? dont know. Ask your mate to ask his gf, she'll definitely know!!|`|X3aD1wflaa	Yeah very interested but shy|`|mqpAAW6aaa	She might just be really shy.<br>  If you haven't spent loads of time with her in person, just online ect. she may really like you, but she might just feel a little shy and uncomfortable since she doesn't know you as a person, just as the online person. If that makes sense.<br>  She might just feel better when her friend is there, because she knows there's someone there who she knows well, like a reassurance or a back up plan, so she feels more confident.<br>  Just talk to her. It will all work out im sure!<br>  =)|`|La4EHNo7aa	She's interested all right.|`|492681182d7c9b1f14276670369e851baa	Yes she likes you.<br>  <br>  If you still like her then ring her.
1hciyvKdaa	Ok, first off after watching on court tv, the engagement ring is yours, it was for the pupose of a marriage and with that not happening it is legally yours to take back.<br>  -------<br>  The lease is yours. IF I was you, I would go through, pick out all bought with her money and give it to her. Now look at the relationship realisitcally. whatever belonged to you before moving in is yours, whatever she brougth in is hers. So make that list. Than this is the deal, if your both blending your money and shopping as if your married etc, fair is fair. There is no payback in dividing up property. Why is she asking to take over the storage, is she paying for it because your broke??? Well if thats the story, shes kinda buying you out since on your own youd lose it all right? You need to be the fair adult here. By law this is not a divorce. By law probably since her names on the ok to enter the storage, she can remove what she wants. So can you.Remember most things can be repurchased later on as needed, cheaper than the storage prices. Go take what you want, that wan not ever hers. List what you take, list whats there, put it all on paper. The storage will most likely make you empty it, end the contract and let her then rent and repack, for all you knwo they have a waiting list, the storage does not want to be involved in you twos petty fighting.If she was paying all the bills rent etc and your money went to furniture art etc, honestly it should be split up.  Always be the bigger person, it feels so much better being the honest one.|`|3e657243a606e14632ec806cc8f3adf1aa	She is only entitled to what has her name on it, you have receipts with your name you will receive those items.  She is trying to rip you off.|`|BMEMH7JLaa	You'll end up getting back together don't burn any bridges.|`|e276df96c55a338c1e69a8869d0cd199aa	You need to talk to a lawyer.|`|Ag8pE3Cyaa	She's entitled to what ever receipts she has with her name on it.|`|dcb024b5e2b5c65f694bdddd3199db68aa	There is no pre-existing agreement or contract that state any sort of re-payment for any "help" she provided.  Her "help" in the relationship could be seen as a "gift" and therefore not something to be reimbursed for.<br>  <br>  as long as your argument is that her help was a gift her sense of entitlement is only her opinion.|`|4Zdp7fu9aa	u need a lawyer i think shes not aloud to take anyof ur stuff if is on ur namee...|`|AA11328507	She is entitled to what she paid for.|`|7foornMVaa	Sounds like a case on Judge Judy.  You take what you paid for. She takes what she paid for. Plain and simple.  If she think she is entitled to more, shes a fool.  If you bought things together then you need to split them fairly. If I were you, I would get another storage unit and put your stuff in it and then let her have what ever is left in the other one. Put her name on it so she will be financially responsible.<br>  <br>  Good luck
8XKmMBU7aa	baby brilliant why please.<br>  Today they had given you birth, Will you give birth ? than ? <br>  <br>  have a nice day and nice dream.|`|vmWEm4Jzaa	no it doesnt seem strange to me to live with your parents when you are still in school|`|zdu3gh8jaa	All 3 sons are still at home at the ages of 22, 20 and 18 years. The younger two are still in college/training and although the older one is working, his finances are still not sufficient enough to maintain and upkeep a property of his own. Each of them have their own lives to lead and contribute to the household in whatever way they can. Their dad and I do what we can to try not to interfere in their private lives and they try in return to give us our space. I don't find it weird in the slightest having them still at home. The last thing they need in this day and age, is to have to start adult life thousands of pounds in debt just to keep a roof over their heads. Both their dad and myself agree, they are welcome to stay as long as they wish, but when they are ready to set out on their own then we will not try to hold them back.<br>  Hope this helps.|`|2l7lbcJWaa	I'm almost 20 and still live at home. My mom would like me to stay until I'm married..lol. I don't think it's weird unless you're living off them, but I have a full time job and go to school also. It saves me much-needed money to live at home right now. If you get along with your parents just fine, I don't see the need to rush out while you're in college. You could be saving up for a down payment on a house or something, instead of wasting money on an apartment.|`|AA12280584	no im 24 and still live at home and dont have plans to move out for a long time yet!! its a bad world out there stay safe at home where its cheep and you get your washing and iroing done for you! and always get your fav meal on a sunday! :)|`|crw44vnRaa	No, I know of several young men and women who have supporting parents, that stay in there parents home for various reasons. What matters is your not living OFF your parents, you have your own job and way of life.|`|1235333b4f34f1147fc81bf4aef8885baa	In the US it's pretty common to live with your parents throughout college.  It's expensive to stay in the dorms.<br>  <br>  If you get along well with your parents and they don't mind, I think it's totally fine.  Now, mind you, living at home shouldn't be an excuse for not working or supporting yourself.  You should be paying rent, or some of the utilities, or at the very least buying some groceries and helping with dinner/chores.<br>  <br>  I lived with my mom for all six years of university.  We joked sometimes that I was a "failure to launch," but the arrangement actually was great for both of us.  I helped with bills and chores around the house and we got to become "adult friends."  After I moved out, she used to ask me all the time to move back in to save money.  By then, I was ready to be out on my own.  Wouldn't change what we had for the world though!|`|AA10505686	In a tough economy  you have to.  Especially when young people take low paying jobs.  I think its even good if somone is trying to make something of themselves by going to college.|`|4qLLQwToaa	My daughters aged 26,22, and 19 all live at home, they pay their way so its ok, they are saving for their own place at their own pace, so it is ok yes.|`|v4xIauuYaa	not these days lots of people stay with there parents cost of living to high.|`|b540a7523d1dcc08713923926477aef5aa	Seems perfectly fine to me.  I want my children home until age 30.
TPhIWWniaa	Dress slacks that are NOT tight anywhere and a button down blouse/sweater (depending on where you live).<br>  <br>  You can also do the dress slacks (black or brown) with a blouse tucked in your pants with a cream, black or brown suit jacket; it doesn't matter if the suit jacket and the slacks are different, the blouse will throw it off; obviously you'd wear the black slacks with the cream or black suit jacket and the brown slacks with the cream or brown suit jacket.|`|mbu5LD02aa	Wear a nice pair of pants and a nice shirt|`|AA10684513	Wear a nice pair of pants and a nice shirt or sweater.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	Professional attire - a nice sweater and slacks; a button down shirt and slacks; a suit with a skirt; a button shirt with a skirt...don't go crazy but do look professional.|`|b7bb85526b028b7f92b16c8204ed4012aa	Professional business attire wont hurt any|`|scnW0Wzeaa	No, wear a teddy.|`|RoyvUWl7aa	Power Suit for sure!
dYzXluF8aa	OMG, this is too cute and yes it is normal, and you are a very lucky girl to have this connection with your partner, treasure it.|`|FhKfyxWlaa	Yes, it is completely normal for people in love to be connected to each other. Congrats!|`|PHYj1UPwaa	Yes..it's called Love..|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	I'd be worried if I DIDN'T feel that.|`|IvMPh09baa	this makes me want to puke.<br>  <br>  seriously, shutup.
972044364c9dc13773675a3798c08e0faa	Yes they would be afraid because the way the first time it was done it was violently taken and the fear that the person they love will harm them in the same way leaves an unsettling and very possible feeling that it will reoccur.|`|eZj1qCd7aa	??? I'm sorta confused. Do you mean If a guy got molested by a guy he would be afraid to have sex??? Well if I was molested I guess I would be a little afraid of sex.|`|qDWuMuwZaa	be specific to your question, give more detail.|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	Human beings are so diverse in their actions that you can do a novel and make it real.<br>  If I give you my opinion it could differ from others, writing is all about imagination and bringing that imagination to life on paper.<br>  Do it and give it your best shot.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	people who have been sexually abused run a wide range of behaviors in the area of sexual psychology.<br>  <br>  some will avoid sex. <br>  <br>  some will become sexually promiscuous and engage in other risk taking behaviors such as drug and alcohol abuse and engage in physically dangerous activities.  (this is the most common reaction)<br>  <br>  some will try to "recreate" on some level the molestation and try to "correct" it by becoming involved with someone who reminds them of their abuser or by victimizing someone else.  (males are statistically more likely to become abusers.  It has something to do with them equating power and strength with the abuser.  This does not mean that women do not commit sexual abuse and this does not mean that all men who have been abused sexually become sexual abusers)<br>  <br>  A lot will depend on what kind of abuse was involved.  Was the abuse only sexual or was it sadistic and more along the line of sexual torture.  The more violent and traumatic the abuse the more extreme the victim's reaction.<br>  <br>  Basically, if the male in your story was abused by a female then he will most likely become sexually promiscuous and be a misogynist.  He'll have a deep seated mistrust of females and will be the love 'em and leave 'em type and he won't be nice to them.<br>  <br>  If the abuser was male then if he is heterosexual then he will be promiscuous because he's trying to prove to himself that he isn't gay.<br>  <br>  The short answer is:  yes, it's possible for a male to be afraid of having sex with a girl his own age if he was sexually abused.<br>  <br>  The long answer is:  there is no easy answer.  A great deal depends on the exact nature of the abuse, who the abuser was (male or female; stanger or family or friend), the age of the abuser (much older or only a little older) and the victim's personality before the abuse.
JhvqUvlsaa	Does he have myspace?  Facebook? If so ask him if he'd be willing to add you and you can chat that way. Just look at his status and make a comment about it. Something like "hey you're trying out for football? Good luck!" This is a lot easier than in person; once you get comfortable chatting this way then chatting in person will just be a continuation of what you said online. <br>  <br>  Good luck!
mkrKHQvFaa	Everyone I know that has had a runner on the grass has had issues (especially if the bride is wearing heals) because it does not work well.  A better bet would be create an aisle with rose petals.  Make a border with red roses creating a look of an aisle.  If there is a flower have her sprinkle white petals thus keeping the look of an aisle.<br>  <br>  I have to agree with the others though that I do not like the look of the aisle runner that you have selected.  If you do not like my advice or oppinion and feel you must go with a runner I would go with a solid white.|`|hkwBR1moaa	Honestly... I think it looks like ugly wallpaper.  I'm sorry!  Go for traditional white.  They sell them at wal-mart for $15.00|`|AA11380378	I like this one a little better:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.orientaltrading.com/ui/browse/processRequest.do?demandPrefix=11&productId=IN-3/1911&mode=Searching&requestURI=processProductsCatalog&xsaleSku=3/1527&sku=3/1911&cm_sp=Cross%20Sell-_-Product%20Detail-_-Product%20Detail" rel="nofollow">http://www.orientaltrading.com/ui/browse...</a><br>  <br>  Only $5 more<br>  <br>  Good luck<br>  <br>  EDIT TO ADD: Color palettes are not an issue. Trust me. No one will care or notice. Also, beware of heels on grass if the aile runner is thin. Like one of the users said below, for outdoors perhaps a rose petal trail may be a better option.|`|sVNWdW50aa	It's a little busy for my taste, but it's really your sister's opinion of it that matters. You will want to put small small stakes in it every few feet to keep it in place. Nothing large or obvious, just something to hold it down and keep the wind from picking it up or having it bunch up and cause her to trip. We did the same thing at my brother's back yard wedding and it worked great. I wish I knew where the stakes came from, but I didn't buy those.|`|pfjxEZBmaa	No offense, but it looks cheap and tacky. A solid print would be better.|`|xuiSfzgraa	I think it's pretty.  It's your sisters day, so if that's what she wants, that is what she should get.|`|rpVQpJA7aa	It is really pretty, but what kind of material is it? You don't want peoples heels going through it. Also, it might not stay in place real well. Try a really thick material, or none at all if its an outdoor wedding!|`|9YWmMyT7aa	I would go without the isle runner. Your outside, enjoy your setting. Besides you don't want people to trip over it or have it get muddy before the bride walks down the isle.|`|DUPOEk1daa	It's real pretty and all, but we don't know any of the bride's colors...or theme or any useful information to help answer this.|`|Imgb9hIWaa	i like the second girs better the other 1 i dont like at all|`|4ad4cbf95f1aba7e2adf54cf0d7981c0aa	It's pretty, just make sure it goes with the theme.  Also being that it is going to be laid on grass, when the bridesmaids and the bride walk on it, it is going to get dirty and mostly likely ripped due to the heels, and it will just be thrown out when the wedding is over, so you might not want to go to pricey.  See if you can just find a regular white one, it will go with whatever theme there is, hope this helped :)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.save-on-crafts.com/aislerunners1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.save-on-crafts.com/aislerunne...</a>

Or the situation. Rewrite it to make it much easier to read xD <br>  <br>  Anyway from what I got it kinda sounds like he wants to have his cake and eat it too!|`|82tgfHzqaa	You can't stop him. He's going to keep cheating, probably forever.<br>  <br>  However, you don't seem all that mature yourself. You both need a few life lessons and learn to value your relationships with other people more.<br>  <br>  You guys don't work together, leave him in the past and move on.
x851kjHuaa	if she has to impress him then they arent meant to be, tell her to be herself, and dont change anything about her she is perfect the way she is. she doesnt need to change just she needs to be more flirtatious (like look at him than look away, smile at him make him know YOUR THERE and then he will kind of chase after you, make small talk if they have a class together, maybe myspace him and get to know him add him as a friend) JUST BE YOUR SELF if you are in different cliques then make him notice you not you chasing him|`|UcgWrGaAaa	Don't worry about boys being impressed.  If they are too impressed they will be intimidated.  <br>  <br>  I think what she really wants to do is flirt.  You can be very subtle and still get the message across.  Look strait into his eyes and smile.  OR touch his hand or arm while looking into his eyes.  She can totally give him a good vibe and if he is interested then the ball is in his court.  Meaning he will respond if he is interested.|`|mF0L5jMNaa	Great posture, a pleasant smile and the ability to talk to anyone about anything.  She should learn to be comfortable in almost any social and employment situation.  Men are attracted to self-assured, self-confident women.|`|F8t4fAm1aa	tell her to wear shot dresses and tight jeans (look sexy). and tell her to look at him until the guy notices and then turn away.the guy will automatically get the idea that she's interested and he might make his move|`|ZzfLnSjUaa	well try to find out if the guy likes her.and if he does tell her and just get both of them to talk to each other. ur friend will never know unless she tries!!

dLd7usmGaa	There is nothing wrong with wanting to have fun and enjoy life. you look pretty young so why not? you only live once. its not fair that you are being ignored, neglected and rejected. obviously girls dont see what they are missing out on. wait for that right girl, and until than, have fun and enjoy yourself!<br>  <br>  i hope you find that one*|`|fcjXaa9faa	"Just looking for fun", always leads to someone getting hurt. If you are a nice guy, (and they are hard to find these days) you will do the 'right thing, the right way'. Don't give into "your" wants, yes we all want, and we all need, but there is a time and a place for everything. If you want to be in a good stable relationship in the future start working on refining your character now, and the person you want to be and the loyal person you will need to be for your future family. <br>  If you are not ready for a relationship now, then stay away from the ladies. One night stands are for jerks, I don't think you are a jerk, remember do things in the right order.|`|c9f2a1b3d1f4937e76dfc5f19e0e903daa	I cheated in my marriage and had a lot of regrets.  Before you do anything, "play the tape all the way through" so that you can see all possible outcomes of the situation.  Think about the consequences and how you would be able to handle the situation if you got caught.  Divorce- are you ok with that?  Do you have children- will they be affected?  And remember to use protection!|`|1Y0yPiSvaa	Have you told your partner in this relationship that you feel you are being ignored........|`|bb06GQ5Paa	No.  Have fun and be careful.

Stepping out on an unsuspecting mate isn't approved behavior for lifestyle people in general.  You're better off seeing a pro if you're going to lie.|`|VjMyHAWraa	HELLOOO! Your not married anymore! You don't have to tolerate that sort of treatment! Move on.. have fun! Remember you are single! do whatever you want. You don't have to be in a serious relationship if you don't want to. Live it up for a while!|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	If you only have yourself to answer to and you could handle swinging then do it, who cares anyway I dont even know you.|`|OBCvewW2aa	There's something wrong with a person who just wants to have sex with strangers and not have an emotional connection to anyone.  "Friends with benefits" is a term penned for the soulless.<br>  <br>  The question is, are you man or are you an animal? Do your physical needs take such precedence over your emotional ones?  And if so, what's wrong with you exactly?  Methinks mama didn't hug you enough when you were a kid.|`|Msd9PiRGaa	Well if you're not ready for a relationship yet then why are you in a relationship. <br>  <br>  Live your life the way you want, but be honest with people, don't get people to think you're interested in a relationship when you just want to fool around.

Turning to swinging is not the answer, find a place to hang out and have fun with your friends,  you dont have to have sex with every woman that you meet. Your not ready for a relationship so find a female friend you can talk to and trust, and then see if you have a chance at making a new life with this woman. I met my best friend and now he finds that there is something missing in this relationship after 2years. Its heartbreaking but you can do this..Just wait the right person will come along..I wish you luck, I do know its tough to go through when you feel alone like me.|`|DTZmqnCkaa	You answer your own question.  "Not ready for a relationship yet, just looking for fun.."  Do exactly that.  You will be absolutely amazed at how many women will say yes to a set up like that.  Especially if you're over 30 years old.  Be COMPLETELY honest and up front with everything from day one and have your fun.  Being lovers is a great set up.  Something like...."I may or may not ever love you but I will always be honest with you and if I have sex with somebody else I swear to God I will use a condom AND tell you about it.  For now, I will pay for the pizzas and drinks and hotels etc.. but I just want some serious hot, fun, hard sex and see what happens later.  It's your move."  You'll be shocked at how many yeses you get.  The key is 100% complete honesty in this little set up.|`|ZxOGKZOkaa	As long as you are not married, you can do whatever the hell you want as long as it doesn't hurt someone.  My first bit of advise to you (and don't get offended if you are mormon) is that you don't date mormons.  If they are no longer with the church, they may have more fun, but I've been hanging around them for a while and they CAN be fun, but in a G rated sort of way.  I have to keep a lot of things to myself.   They don't appreciate my low cut tops.  I think they are just jeoulous because their father in heaven wasn't as generous with them as he was with me.  ANYWAY....move to California.  Lots of good swinging stuff going on there!   I know of a house that's for sale and the owner is desperate to unload it because she's been unemployed for quite some time and can no longer afford TWO house payments.<br>  Whatever you do, just don't get into drugs.  Drugs are bad, mmkay?  (southpark)<br>  Oh ya, and friends with benefits are cool.  Just make sure you get out of the relationship you are in before you go for it.  It's not fair to her.  Be a man and just tell her to put out or get out.  Or just tell her to get out.     : )<br>  You need a woman that likes to eat sausages.....|`|4fded85bb017fba5407e3727176079ffaa	Here's a novel idea.<br>  <br>  Why don't you walk out and stay out of realtionships until you understand better what you want.<br>  <br>  When you are out, you can have as many 'friends with benefits' as you like as long as you are upfront and honest about your intentions.<br>  <br>  Besides, if you are miserable, think about your partner.  How miserable are you making her by acting like a petulant child?<br>  <br>  I want my cake and eat it too is not a valid reason for hurting someone else.|`|PlQ4N2Hxaa	GET OUT!!!!<br>  <br>  Why be miserable?  Find peace with yourself and enjoy being single...  Go out have fun do what you will. <br>  <br>  It sounds like you might be co-dependant (divorced and back into a bad relationship) talk with a professional and see why you are attracting these people who are bad for you and try to change that.|`|QK7ssy2Xaa	If I were you I'd just spend some time with YOU. I wouldn't go swinging thats what your hand is for. Just hang out with your friends and family and enjoy life. Take some time to yourself and relax. And when your ready then start looking. But for now just go out, have a good time and try to forget about your past.|`|sCCjAKllaa	No, man! You're not a pig; just someone who seems misguided right now. Hey, we all need to blow off steam sometimes, so you should find a good friend that you wouldn't want anything serious with, then hit it off.|`|BDjBVdtRaa	do what you think you want. no one likes to be hurt or depressed. and no your not a pig alot of ppl have that|`|n7BuH75gaa	There is nothing wrong with that at all.<br>  Have fun, you only live once.<br>  Who cares if any one judges you.<br>  Be a hedonist.|`|AA10684513	If you are not married it is easy to just walk away and find someone you will be happy with.|`|scnW0Wzeaa	Have fun.

Just stating "my" opinion as a mother of a 17yr old son - I'd be livid if a 33yr old woman was interested in having a relationship with him. I'd immediately think her elevator was broke!<br>  <br>  Of course he gets along with your 3 yr old - he's closer to her age than he is to yours. You can put her through pre school and him through college.|`|T4N6a7MQaa	It might be simply wonderful now. It won't stay that way though. There is no way you can have a lot in common. You were 17 when he was born. Same music? Not likely. Same likes in movies? Also not likely. This age difference is going to show later and it's not going to be pretty. He's still physically maturing. You, at 34 are soon going to be physically slowing down. It's obvious you've got your mind made so anything anyone says is going to do nothing. My only advice is to beware of how he's going to be as the hormones continue to rage. They will too. He's just not there yet. Sorry!|`|vyNlyfczaa	My best friend is 8 years older then her husband (who is 28) - they have great relationship, she just found out that is pregnant (they tried for couple years!) then her sister is with they guy who is younger than she is 14 years (I think he is 24) - the relationship is going to be almost 2 years! So in my opinion if this works for you guys, go for it! As long as you feel comfortable with each other why not?! Don't look at other people opinions! I mean let's face it, there is so many relationships that the guys is 10-15-20 years older than a girl and this is not such a big issue like when the girl is older - I don't get why!<br>  Good luck!|`|H3WHxCgaaa	LMFAO.  I'm the same age - going through my peak as well...who wouldn't enjoy a young male at this time in our lives?  It feels right for you now - but in another 5 years you'll be a thing of his past.

I had never been truly in love before this, I am now 47 and Frank is 31, we have been together going on 8 years, age makes absolutly no difference in our relationship, we do not have children, even though Frank would make a great Father, I am not able to have children and never have been, Frank is fine with that, so if you get along, and emtionaly support eachother that's what it's all about, but one thing I might add is he is only 18, and down the road a few years he may change his mind about the children thing, so just keep that in mind.|`|pRF5LLloaa	You are old enough to be his mother!<br>  <br>  While there is nothing LEGALLY wrong (he IS 18....) you are going to find that he is VERY immature for you.  Boys don't reach emotional maturity until they are about 27 (if ever...).  <br>  <br>  This is illustrated by his statement that he doesn't want to bring a child into this world.  We ALL know that is highly idealistic -- the fact is, you bring children into this world and then you do your best to raise them right.  but HE is not committed (or mature enough) to do that.<br>  <br>  In about 5 years you WILL regret this.  I would place bets that, if you get married, within 3 years of getting married you will find that you are now raising two children instead of just one.<br>  <br>  Also, you will have exposed your daughter to this, and when the split come she will be almost inconsolable.   HE's closer to her age than yours!  She will probably bond to him like an older brother -- which you will tear away from here when the split comes. There is a good chance that when you two split, she will hate YOU for causing it (may not be right, but that's how children's minds work)<br>  <br>  Think VERY CAREFULLY about how your actions will affect your daughter, before you proceed any further with this guy.|`|sXnoIFRsaa	Technically you are old enough to be his Mother, you really do not have anything in common with someone who is 16 years your junior.

WHich means that all is noce now but eventually he will wake up from his dream and guess who will get hurt? you. I say take it all with a grain of salt. refrain from being so jubilant and overly excited about it. take your time, ask him about MORE than just what you have in common. try to understand his dreams, his hopes, his goals in life and see if it fits with yours.

There are times though when I feel like I'm raising my husband along with my kids. When it comes right down to it though, age is just a set of numbers. What matters the most is how YOU feel about the relationship. In 10 years, you'll be in your 40's and he'll still be in his 20's. His energy levels will still be way up there, while yours well ...not so much. Just take your time and really think things through. You're a mom above and beyond everything else.|`|GeSNfbOYaa	As long as you and your daughter are happy with this particular gentleman, then there is no problem whatsoever. <br>  Tbh, along as there is love in a relationship, what is the problem? He sounds like the perfect man and if what he is saying is correct, probably needs an older woman to look after him. Don't worry about what over people say either, it's not of their Business; you can't judge anyone over the internet. <br>  <br>  But hey, I'm a little bias, Idc that David Bowie's 62, I will marry him :)<br>  <br>  Hope this has hoped.|`|HPO87jGiaa	Well as long as there's definitely chemistry going on, I'd say lucky you.  But in my personal opinion, first impressions are not everything, later down the road he may have 18 year old male tendencies such as hanging out with his friends way too much, avoiding some responsibilities, but if he is how you say he is and you're not totally blinded by love and/or obsession then go for it.  I thought it was very motherly for you to say "I also don't have to tell him to do things, he does em on his own...like he took out the trash... without saying anything..." lol. It'll be a hard relationship and for some reason, I think if he ever breaks your heart, you will fall hard.|`|Sr4u5skgaa	I think you should read back over what you have already written, look how happy you sound.

EVERY COUNTRY i've been to there has been no issues whatsoever on age. America is the only country that is so hung up on the age between a man and a woman. why that is >??? i have no clue. in short your answer is 90% of the human population on this Planet could care less of a x yrs difference. For me personally, i have no problems dating a women older than me.|`|tTsdeyfoaa	yeah, its just a number to a certain degree. Like someone said, it wont last. He is 18. Think about that for a second. He still hasnt lived life, and you have. He will turn 21 and decide he wants to party etc. Happens every time. He may not act like 18 on the surface, but deep down he is 18. I honestly dont think this could ever work. Eventually you two will both be in very different places in your lives. I would say dont waist your time
CM0C65dtaa	Actually I have a much higher libido than I used to (I'm 50) - maybe it decreases later - lol).  It probably depends on the woman.  If they've had bad relationships with men, they mite just want a fling, but if she has had good experiences, she may miss the romantic aspect of it.|`|FhKfyxWlaa	Who said that all women have declining libidos or interest in romance? How many women have you actually polled in this area? Menopause doesn't usually happen until 50, and even that doesn't always make a woman lose interest.  What any particular woman wants is up to that woman specifically. Not good to generalize. Treat all women well regardless of what it is you assume they want. You'll never go wrong if you behave in a respectful manner.|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	I am a cougar.................my fiance is 17 years younger than me and I love sex with him, whenever, wherever and however, but the thing we share most is our emotions, our feelings and our souls.|`|IvMPh09baa	No..  Everyone wants sex, nobody loses interest in sex... they just lose interest in who they are having sex with.|`|PBOWJYQ6aa	Libido doesn't necessarily decline with age. It goes up and down at various times in our lives. Most of us want romance from every relationship- without it, relationships aren't really relationships, just "friends with benefits." I am normally pretty honest about which one I am looking for. She'll let you know.|`|zhaHc4FAaa	It depends upon the woman.   Some woman are bored with all that stuff and just want the physical fulfillment ( boy toy)..while others still want to be romanced and are truly looking for a relationship.<br>  <br>  Every woman is different, so it depends upon the kind of woman you meet and what her need is|`|mF0L5jMNaa	All of the above.  However, when a woman is a cougar she is not looking for a long term relationship ... just some companionship and fun.  Everyone enjoy romance (i.e. attention) whether it culminates in a sexual tryst or not.|`|PHYj1UPwaa	Well..I am older and I definetly Love romance...Honey...heheheheh|`|mTl9l3aMaa	Most womens' libido goes down over time, but probably not romance.|`|f7f0fd5f021b5d1e4672cdbda2a11ffeaa	All women are different, she could be looking for any or all of those things.  There isn't an age at which people stop wanting to be treated nicely.|`|jBigEy0Caa	Sex gets better with age for a lot of women.|`|fb719885a6ad0c93baa1955ec6f7904caa	Where did you get your info older women are hot for sex and romance|`|fLn0iRpxaa	Being 47 .... and having experience in dating younger men. Both simply for my own sexual needs, & that of a continued 4yr relationship with a man 39 now. Therefore, I would say it truly depends on what you desire. You can have both.|`|GhmGtG3Gaa	More then likely, if she comes off like she really just want sex, then that's what its usually is!!<br>  But if she acts like its more; like she want a relationship then that's what it is!<br>  It depends on the signs you're getting from her!!|`|4847c723d0daf83586e5ab2098b506ccaa	yes|`|FrpvmqI1aa	yes|`|NI7bvePkaa	SEX SEX SEX is what she is looking for.|`|4Zdp7fu9aa	I dont knoow im 18 and im married to my husband but i wish my interest in romace dosent end at age 40:P|`|yiUNN8ADaa	Most likely just sex interest. If she wanted you for more, she would tell you. Cougars aren't shy!|`|mXTn7fGRaa	Hecky NAW!!.... in this case it really depends on the person.. u cant stereotype this one!! =)|`|NeTNnvSZaa	Depends on the man and what kind of interest the "cougar" has shown.  No one can divine the answer.|`|7foornMVaa	Im 38 and my libido is as strong as ever. All women like romance.<br>  We are interested in both, romance and sex.  I say they go hand in hand if you wanna get in my knickers. lol

I like ya too. =)|`|RtKzazMDaa	you could gain a little confidence and get to know him better, and get closer to him. maybe talk to him in class, or say hi when you see him.<br>  <br>  or you could stop obsessing over him and stop liking him. maybe stop looking at his myspace and concentrate on school or something.|`|ryOXYF8uaa	never categorize yourself!! you are worth more than to label yourself and hold back because of social class!!! you are two equal human beings so stop putting yourself into categories and speak to him!<br>  <br>  however dont ask him out right away, schools a tough place to be and he may also be lame enough to categorise himself, so speak 1st    x|`|goe3y4FPaa	b.s.. if i wanted too.. i could of been bagging.. all the popular girls.. in my h.s.. wheter i was popular or not.. if hes a guy.. he problably.. wants the hottest girls around.. and if evryone likes him... u just might be a piece of meat and nothing else for him..|`|ZzfLnSjUaa	hahaha why dnt u try checking ur yahoo....seems like the guy u like answered ur own question!!|`|opT8Uc8Paa	hate this situation. first of try to make him recognize you and by that i don't mean laugh a little louder at a joke when hes 3 seats away because that's soo obvious...as much as you don't think it is...IT IS!.<br>  so by trying to be recognize try wearing a different type of outfit that would get people to recognize you (low rise jeans with a halter top?) nothing skanky looking though guys like girls down to earth. when people start to recognize you he will too. or if you have classes together answer the questions so he would think your smart.<br>  second. does he play sports? try going to an game of his not cheering or making a big scene but just be there. <br>  and third when your walking in the hall and see him try to get a conversation going with a friend who just happens to be standing near him.<br>  <br>  once you have him though don't get dispirit because having him can be as easy as losing him.|`|BQ7P9QvBaa	i am in the same kind of conflict, but i have my answer to it. It all depends on what kind of girl you are. <br>  <br>  Shy: Try and get one of your friends that are more outgoing to tell him that you like him. It works even though you dont like the idea of him knowing. Then get one of your other friends that are or at least look somewhat popular to tell him how cool and down to earth you are. Guys do depend on looks a majority of the time, but deep down they are all about a girls feelings and personality. The shy type is good but let your wild side out infront of him a little bit! The guy i like is getting lured into this trap with me :)<br>  <br>  Outgoing: You already know how to put yourself out there for him, so go right on ahead and do that! Talk to him more often and talk about the things that you have in common. Then when you are at the right chance ask him to go some place with you. Something you both like. If you have alot of classes with him, then start out a conversation by saying something like, "Another class with you? This day just keeps getting better and better!" Something that can start a conversation and sound flirty and nice.<br>  <br>  I hope you can go out with this guy. Dont be afraid to show him you. Just be yourself and confident at the same time.|`|QYPqIiYlaa	It's always a difficult situation at this time in life. I'm in high school too, & I, along with manyyy others have been in this situation, lol.<br>  FIRST of all, don't put yourself down by saying someone is out of your league. Because no one is better than you, so don't say that. :)<br>  Now, you seem like a shy girl, so this could be difficult for you. But, first, start off with a cute little smile, like this one :), whenever you pass him in the hall or something.<br>  If he doesn't smile back, then forget him, he's a jerk! lol.<br>  BUT, if he doess smile back, that shows that he at least has common courtesy,<br>  SO, next take it to a smile & a "hey", if he says smile & hey back, lol, then add him on myspace after school on a Friday, that way, he has already noticed you (from the smiling & heys) so you won't just look like some random girl adding him on myspace.<br>  Okay, so add him on a Friday, that way you will have all week end to chat it up on myspace.<br>  That's all I've got for now, lol.<br>  Good luck!|`|AA11903486	Okay look, the thing is. Have you ever spoken with him? How do you know that you have alot in common just by looking at his myspace profile? Seriously . . . Think about it.|`|joLmPLL3aa	the main thing is CONFIDENCE, half the TOP BOYS in my school are nutin but jerks lol trust me but if you want it you go and get it! it dont matter whaat any1 else thinks its what makes U happy ! <br>  good luck :)|`|vvaZoMU4aa	not to care about all this "popular" stuff and just b yourself and to talk to him, duh
POWGcfjgaa	One thing would be a good idea is by like putting it in food or something cool and awesome like that... hint her before you let her eat it unless you want sergury on her. LOL!! and say i love you, you are the only thing i ever wanted and stuff like that..<br>  <br>  Just randomly giving it to were would be funnny too lol

I like girls that are crazy but laid back at the same time. Girls that like to some of the same stuff but still has stuff that i dont like.  They have to been able to hang with my friends and her friends but then be a couple at the same time.|`|OyWVqe23aa	their d*cks.|`|7e4jxj3Daa	Cute, sweet, caring, decent shape, but she has to have great legs to make it with this guy!|`|JCdBSULraa	You're probably going to get 5-10 sarcastic answers that say "My d*ck".   Generally we like a slender form and things we have in common with them though.  Aside from those, it's going to vary from person to person.

XnEnelsBaa	I think that most people would agree, 13 is too young to be having sex. I think she probably feels very 'grown up' at the moment but I'm sure she will regret it later. <br>  <br>  Chances are if you interfere too much you will lose your friend. Most young girls are pressured into sex at that age rather than actually wanting it. But once you start, it is difficult to stop!<br>  <br>  Perhaps I am old fashioned but I think 15 or 16 is about right for most people these days. Learning when to say NO! Is a great skill for your life not just for sex.<br>  <br>  If you think your friend is in actual danger then please get advice from a school counsellor or adult, someone you trust.<br>  <br>  Take care now!|`|hWqIn3CVaa	shes obviously very horny and likes golf courses and i agree with my friend pen guy YOINK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|eBB9qJRxaa	Yoink!|`|9ZeNGl9Laa	that i think is wrong i would get that girl help|`|Vbdfphhbaa	she needs help. has she told you why she is doing this? what does she think of sex in general?did she tell her parents? have you asked her if she is using contraceptives? condoms? anything to keep herself safe? something happened between tha last time you spoke and now that triggered her behaviour.what if it wasn't sex with your friends permission ?(were talking rape here) she may be acting as if nothing is wrong,but it is. try talking to her and see where you go from there.you have two choices:<br>  <br>  1. go to health clinic with her and simply get her to at least be safe with her body,and get some education regarding std's pregnancy and stuff.<br>  2. talk to her parents...she will hate you for this,but if it means preventing her from getting hurt or even pregnant,or her safety. it will be worth more. be prepared,she will hate you for going to her parents,and for telling. and she may not appreciate you caring for her. give her time and see what happens, she will see that you are only worried for her and do love her.
Vbdfphhbaa	avoiding her is not going to make her go away...not going to the park,will give her power over you (she still wins) learninga new move? definitely will help you. like others said try not being just you and friend,bring more friends with you. the next time she comes over and tries to do the same thing again (she yelled stop,thats her signal) simply ignore hr,but a simple remark like "sorry I'm not stooping to your level" and leave. if she tries to pick you up again,tell her you'll call the cops,that should stop her on her tracks. she is definitely insecure and relies on making others feel downright crappy.<br>  <br>  *a contest in the park should help her shut up also,remember the more participants the better. just make sure you know your moves!|`|EjyD1sXeaa	get more of your friends and sisters etc to hang out with you at the park. Don't let this bully get her evil way. She shouldn't have picked you up and dropped you - that's abusive - tell your parents (perhaps your mother could spy on the situation)|`|q0b6uPCraa	Dont avoid, thats what she wants. Do not try to beat her, you will hurt yourself. Just say:<br>  "Well, Lil Miss ******!" (A word beginning with To and ending with sser.)<br>  If she replies keep shouting "****** ******!" (The same word!)<br>  And after awhile she will get fed up and you say "Stumped!"<br>  <br>  Also get your big brother or sister to hang out with you. Tell them to dress like a punk and wear black eye make-up to freak the girls out.<br>  <br>  A contest is a BAD idea. Tell your mom or dad, she could get arrested for picking you up and dropping you. It's bodily harm. That IS bullying really!|`|h0AMrZkvaa	no to avoiding the park but it might happen more often or you could learn something way more cooler than a back tuck do it in front her and be like now you got severed <br>  yeah you are getting bullied|`|BDjBVdtRaa	have a dance off!?!?!?!?! to see who is better.LOL|`|Pytcmdveaa	cheer off?
58cfb3933858f1cc29cad9e0a4f9ad95aa	Sounds like she's just trying to make you mad. And even if she does want you back, don't take her back!! You don't want to be with a chick who's capable of being so mean!|`|td6WXhv4aa	You can get them back through the court and the cops.|`|gjtdLPIYaa	she loves drama. that's what she is doing trying to continue drama|`|iJZ5Efb0aa	probably doing it out of enjoyment of your annoyance. i think she is liking the fact she has your stuff either because she knows you want it back, or she just wants to keep it because it means something to her, or she could want you back.<br>  either way, it could just be because she wants you to suffer not having your stuff, or she could want you back.|`|Y1zH3Ecfaa	This is bad ...You might want to handle this quick before she starts selling or giving it away to other dudes .....|`|nBGjPwViaa	No, it doesn't mean she wants you.<br>  She's just being immature -- it's the<br>  only way she has left to control you.|`|ew3Wl6hKaa	its out of spite|`|BKr3y30maa	It can honestly mean either of the two.  If you are the one that broke it off, maybe she is mad and is doing it out of spite.  Or maybe she is holding on to your things because she wants you back.  How do you feel about her I guess is the question?  Do you want to get back with her?  Whether or not, I would call her and ask for your things again.  If you don't want to get back together with her, don't be mean about it because you don't want to piss her off more and give her more of an urge to keep your stuff. But if you want her back, tell her.  Good luck and hope things work out for you. :)|`|z9st8cLvaa	Its hard to say, but it sounds like spite.  Have you asked if you could pick your stuff up from her?  Instead of waiting for her to send them to you?|`|RvddYKqjaa	Most likely it means she hasn't taken the time to pack them up and send them to you. If she is playing games with you, why would you even think about going back to her?  That will wear thin very quickly.|`|y76ZHadsaa	she is probably not over you! and doesn't want to give it back, or, she doesn't care enough to bring it back. but most likley the first one.|`|sr0vZPQqaa	It means you ain't getting your stuff back. Forget about it and stop giving her the satisfaction of keep asking for it.|`|AA12233287	Sounds like she's planning on keeping it, sorry.|`|hdzm3tfAaa	Trying to do VOODOO haha|`|2TAq6XO2aa	she doesn't want you.  she just doesnt want to forget u|`|Nc7clhzIaa	I can think it may be a revengeful thing.  Making you wait for your things, knowing that you want/need them would make you more aggravated.  Kinda like, she will return your things when she good & well feels like it.  If she is having to use her gas & her time/money to bring you your things then I guess she would return them whenever she feels like it.  Why can't you go & get them yourself?  So maybe she isn't being a pain, it's just that it may be a pain for her to load up everything when she finds time out of her busy schedule.|`|mF0L5jMNaa	It means she is thinking "why should I go to the trouble of packing and shipping this stuff".  Call and ask her to put your things in a box and put out on her porch (or someplace else decided upon) where you can go by and pick it up at HER convenience.  Getting your stuff is your responsibility.|`|EPmuhhGaaa	Depends on your ex- here are some possibilities...<br>  <br>  1. she's already burned them<br>  2. shes keeping them like a trophy <br>  3. she may just want to annoy you/she may be so mad its pure spite<br>  4. she may still like you (slim)<br>  5. she may have lost them<br>  <br>  No matter what you're not getting them back through her. Either get a spy to find out why she wont. You could show up at her house asking. You could let it go. <br>  <br>  But don't read into it. My frind keeps all her boyfriends hats and sunglasses for no real reason.|`|dOMzkQIraa	Been there, done that...<br>  <br>  No, it doesn't mean anything except that she's a *****..<br>  <br>  Forget about her, forget about the stuff, painful but you'll live ;)<br>  <br>  Do NOT go anywhere near her house! Don't call her, don't do anything. She can get you arrested for stalking, I know.... All I wanted was my stuff, never got it and I almost got arrested for it...<br>  <br>  If you can prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that that stuff belongs to you you can report it as theft. If you can't prove it forget it.|`|Hh9sRoZMaa	Bro. Dun think too much. Learn to let go. She just don't wanna see you for these period that's why she still haven't return you the things. Let her go and look for another.. Your life wouldn't end without her. Prove to her that she is not worthy of your attention and get a better one.|`|I5P2OSAjaa	i think it means she's lazy and you should go over there and take your stuff. if she wants you back, make her tell you, don't let her play games, that stuffs ridiculous. you gotta play like you have the hand regardless. get your stuff back and see if she does anything. good luck|`|56MmKc5caa	what kind of stuff is she unwilling to give up? If it's jewlery or clothes then she still likes you. If it's cd's or furniture she is doing it out of spite. Good luck.|`|3uI0JAAwaa	Dunno, but you can hire a PI, and he can break into her place when she is gone and get it back for you legally.|`|9VRwBeATaa	Go over there and demand your property be returned.|`|A2G9foewaa	She probably wants to pawn your stuff, you better go get it soon|`|deG4RMJhaa	it's possible she still cares|`|dqCcedc4aa	she is doing it out of spite.|`|olqjNv9Eaa	you better do something or you never see your stuff again|`|M71hN9OBaa	she doesn't want YOU. she wants your stuff..to give to her next boyfriend.|`|v96pYAg1aa	SHE STILL LIKES U AND DOESNT WANT TO BE UR EX !!! I am over excited today sorry for the cap lock :( :3|`|86UljsVfaa	i was the same way with my ex bf lol. i broke up with him like last night and i am wearing his necklace right now, it doesnt really mean anything if u two arent together anymore, she may just like the possessions and doesnt wanna lose something she got from someone she used to love. she doesnt want you back trust me on that. she is prolly a gold digger if she is keeping everything. but im burnin this necklace, so i wont be considered a gold digger. oh and also she is prolly scared that if she gives back the stuff, you'll end up giving it to ur new gf. i have this same exact problem...we hate that!!!!!!|`|PD2opzXdaa	It could mean that she is keeping them to still have contact with you.  Or it could mean that she doesn't have them anymore.  Look if your done, the items she has aren't that serious leave it alone and move on.  Unless, you want her to have them and you are both playing games.  <br>  <br>  Wish you the best<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|0soaWkXOaa	Unfortunately, women often keep a hold of what you have left behind at theirs. Get over it a stop being so clingy, you will not get it back! When you find a new bird it will happen again . . . thats if you end up breaking up. anywho, best of luck keeping your possessions in the future.|`|eKtKKbiFaa	LOL... i havent returned my ex's shirt as well.. lol.. but im gonna go return it this evening.. took me aa month<br>  to be honest i dint wanna accept it was over..but apparently it is.. so i guess ur ex still hasnt acecpted its over.. even if she has mooved on.. somethings are jus hard to come to terms with.. give her time.. she'll return it|`|NI7bvePkaa	It's her way of controlling your emotions.

0fVtHNtmaa	It's obvious right in front of your face that Sarah is a cheating lieing whore. Your friend just can't believe you'd be stupid. How can she be supportive? You see a kid reach for a hot stove and you say "NO HOT!" and they want to touch it anyway. You know it will burn them bad, do you say "Go ahead sweetie, with my blessings." NO you don't. get it?|`|mF0L5jMNaa	Hey you just stood your friend up financially.  Your actions are going to cause her financial and emotional problems.  She now has to find another roommate.  No one wants their home to have a revolving door of people who can't make a decision.<br>  <br>  Of course you should not move back in with your old girlfriend.  People who aren't 100% sure about their committment should not be living together.|`|ryOXYF8uaa	Daisy is like your sister, she can see you are making a mistake by going back with sarah, bcus she hurt you. she doesn't want you to get hurt again.<br>  im with daisy on this one hun, she will do it again, what if daisy wont let you move back in wiv her wen sarah hurts you again??think about it hun    x|`|AuWPMH44aa	shes trying to be a good friend and not let u make the same mistake again. but u shuld do wat u feel is rite so if its talking to sarah and trying to work out things then do it.|`|opT8Uc8Paa	daisy likes you. its so obvious. <br>  first of admit your mistake so she'll at least think your responsible to own up to your own ****. and she wont wish you luck if she likes you as immature as that sounds its true. its like if you were living with a buddy and hes going out with a girl you really like so of course your not gonna say "ight that's cool i like the girl but your going to bang her. good luck."..no. <br>  second sarah doesn't seem to know what she wants. <br>  i would take things slow if i was you. talk to both of them separately.|`|62bdfaff99eb94891a0098fdd62fe168aa	a) she cares about you as a friend and doesn't want to see you hurt<br>  and <br>  b) you have threatened her security|`|Un9CElCaaa	because women are competitive. ur friend is worried about u. she doesnt want to date u but the fact that u want the other girl will make her want u whether she is interested in u or not
eXSy6IwMaa	if one person has a dream and the other doesnt have and just get along. i think thats still a good thing.. at least at that thing, both of you will have the same goals and dreams for you life.. <br>  <br>  and if other other person does not have dreams to resent the others dream, i think the one who has  a dream would just be supportive to the other one who doesnt have a dream.. <br>  <br>  then, dream the same dreams and work for the same goals.. thats a good thing and i think it will produce good bonding and great understanding... :D|`|FhKfyxWlaa	Whether you have dreams of your own or not, a good spouse is always supportive of the others dreams and goals.|`|AA11328507	Of course you can import your dreams and goals into a marriage...it will work out as long as the other spouse supports the decision|`|62cdabc33de92fc0cab4f5016db9f9bcaa	if you don't have dreams and goals in marriage (yet alone life) why bother even getting out of bed. goals push us and keep the hope alive in us.and in marriage, it should be a must. I was married and she didn't really believe allot in goals and was kinda blah to the whole idea.it took its toll on me, its nice to wake up every morning and shoot for the stars, single or not. my dreams and goals keep the passion of life in my heart.<br>  <br>  just a thought<br>  <br>  cheers
HMhUKAgkaa	Absolutely. You are keeping this from your husband? That right there is a red flag. How would you feel if your husband read all those emails? If it's bad, then you better stop this online relationship. Cheaters are ALWAYS found out. You need to decide who is more important to you. Is this worth losing your husband over?|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	Its starting to get to you now isn't it, I mean you are starting to feel guilty and my guess is that you are beginning to have feelings for him more than you realise and your sub conscience is kicking in.<br>  Its clear you have to stop emailling each other or things could get out of hand.<br>  If you love your husband you wont let this online relationship go any further, explain to him that you are feeling guilty about your husband and want to turn your attention to him.<br>  I know how exciting online relationships can be - I am getting married to my man and we met on line - but you are married and your poor husband needs as much if not more attention than you are giving to this other man.<br>  Be strong and if you cant break if off completely then limit your emails to once a month or so.|`|577ba10a2319b430720b5a913b74b862aa	i wouldn't call it cheating at this point, not in the sense you're talking about.  but you are cheating yourself,  your husband, your friend and his wife out of full relationships with the spouse.  it's past time to cut him off.  if you're asking this question, it's obvious you must feel guilsty and that's not good, to either your marriage or the friendship.  it really is best to stop communicating with this other man.|`|u7f0QB37aa	Yes you are acting like a filthy whore going behind you poor husbands back and having feelings for this other man.<br>  <br>  You prove my point that women can't be trusted you all cheat in some form or another.|`|RBQrgByeaa	An emotional affair is not cheating. How romantic, actually!|`|NSKimt1Qaa	I"m sure there are plenty who disagree with me, but I don't consider it cheating.  You are just e-mailing an old friend and you've been doing so for 2 years without it leading to anything more.  I see absolutely no harm in that whatsoever, and I'm just going by the information you provided. Now, I didn't read your other responses, but people can judge others quite harshly, so you need to realize this and do what you, yourself, feels is right for you.|`|FhKfyxWlaa	Yes, you are having an emotional affair. It needs to stop. If that guy was the right fit for you, you would have married him years ago.  A good rule of thumb is this: If you can't tell your spouse about it, its WRONG!  If your husband were doing this with another woman, you would be furious.|`|K6vEbdqxaa	If your husband doesn't know about it, and you don't want him to know about it it's cheating.  An emotional affair is far worse in my opinion than a physical one.|`|F4d89iRMaa	emotional and mental affair. if you are hiding it you know you are guilty of something. how would it feel if he is posting this question?<br>  walking in someone else's shoes can help|`|61Fwbi79aa	If you have to ask then the answer is yes. Anything hidden from your husband is cheating. What would he say if you asked him this question?|`|B12E4rYiaa	If your husband doesn't know then this would be considered cheating. You need to tell them or risk them finding out on their own which will be worse.|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	Anything you hide from a spouse is cheating.|`|tsBL19qzaa	Yes, you are cheating.|`|De1tOxHXaa	It is just the starting of cheating,so stop it now as it gone late.<br>  This is not the talk of online relationship,it can quickly be turn as physical.If you love your husband,if you have some feelings,if you think that he is also loves you than it is better to stop this online relationship and if you don't feel that your husband don't love you than you can carry on.|`|GhmGtG3Gaa	Yes and no!!<br>  Yes because your feelings are getting stronger for him everytime yall talk and your still in a relationship even tho yall haven't like had sex or anything, its still consider cheating!!<br>  No because you're in titled to have friends that you communcate with even tho they could be your ex!<br>  So really it just depends on what type of relationship you and your husband are in!!|`|dYzXluF8aa	Yes it is consider cheating, it is the emotional connection you two have, that may lead you both to do things you may regret, tell me this would you like your spouse to talk to his ex girlfriend and did not tell you nothing about it, I DON'T THINK SO!!! So if you would not like your husband to do it then you know it's wrong, so stop while you are ahead.|`|O8TA4tMGaa	If you asked the question, you already know the answer.  Where is your heart?  What do you want for your life?  Why have you not told your husband and why has he not told his wife?  Where is this online relationship going?  Are you happy in your marriage?<br>  <br>  Answer those questions openly and honestly and you'll have all the answers you need.  It is not my place to judge, condemn, blame or shame you (you're probably doing enough of that to yourself without anybody else's help).  At the end of the day, you need to love yourself enough to be completely honest with yourself about where you are in your life and what and who you want in your life.<br>  <br>  You deserve the best.  Accept it now.|`|sg2hOcXLaa	Anything that you can't do in front of your husband without feeling guilty, I would recommend that you don't do it. <br>  <br>  The definition of cheating means stepping out. Even though it's not physical, your still cheating on your husband in your heart.|`|yNFsEPVBaa	If you value your marriage and are becoming emotionally involved with your cyber date you must quit. But if you are just enjoying the pleasure of talking to someone fun just keep it up. Good for you and for your husband.|`|mfqfO0wUaa	It's only cheating if you play with your kitty and he's spanks his monkey while you guys talk on the internet.|`|AA11328507	Your emotionally cheating and STOP it now before you both destroy your marriages.|`|bipLaDk7aa	as u said ur spouse is not aware of this...u are in contact with ur ex secretly . this clears that u r cheating on ur spouse.   well revealing about this to ur spouse after 2 yrs is a bad idea.|`|AA10420452	yes you are hiding things like this should tell you what if he was chatting with an old fling and you did not know how would you feel about it|`|BuyzuOEjaa	depends on what the email are about and how you feel for each other.  yes it can be in some views.|`|6PfJXI7iaa	I don't think it's cheating until you meet.|`|y4w6ybr3aa	How would you feel if your husband did this to you?<br>  There's your answer|`|vmWEm4Jzaa	its called emotional cheating-generally turns into physical cheating. i would stop now before you lose your husband!
4EWCegiRaa	-I want someone I can trust.  If I can't trust you, what's the point?<br>  -I want someone who is a good person.  You need something to fall in love with.<br>  -I want someone smart.  We're going to raise our kids together so I don't want an ignorant, biased jerk.  I don't someone who can't teach the kids anything.  I don't want a woman who's hand I have to hold during the simplist of tasks.  I want someone who can articulate themselves, read something above a high school level, and thinks about things before she makes decisions.<br>  <br>  Oh, and it would be nice if she could cook too.  I can't cook but I love food even though I stay fit.|`|YFXusnT1aa	She has to be cool, I have to feel like I can tell her anything. She has to have a sense of humor, she can't be threatened by other girls. If someone is just a friend that is what they are. Allow me to make decisions for my self she can't take over all the time. Be confident in us, and herself.|`|Oz5F8Alfaa	honest answer please don't be offense.  Men always want to have a pretty attractive sexy girl to show off with their friends (not much their family).  but they always want to have a wh**e in bed that could pleasure them the way they want.|`|LMPK5WBaaa	Himself !!
zoDGfEXvaa	no, flirting does not lead to affairs. If two married people are mature enough to handle it, flirting can be fun and flattering. There is nothing wrong with it, and it makes people feel good about them selves. So in my personal opinion, flirt away!|`|dYzXluF8aa	Well I believe any flirting is wrong when it is not with your partner, this may and can lead to other things in an innocent relationship.|`|T97TUAqMaa	Think about this: would you want your spouse to know/hear what you are saying to the other person? How would you feel if you heard your spouse saying those things to someone else?!?!?|`|oMNXWMs9aa	Yes flirting is very wrong that should only be done with your spouse.|`|dcb024b5e2b5c65f694bdddd3199db68aa	A lot of affairs start with flirting.|`|BuyzuOEjaa	I am not sure it wrong or cheating but it might be taken wrong,|`|f572cd9e5284c6c84045096ffbd2aeb8aa	If you have to ask...|`|ECe1rgsdaa	That depends on the level of flirting. If it is just innocent and jokey, then no harm done, but if it means more, that is a problem.|`|IvMPh09baa	ask yourself this.... what is flirting satisfying in both of you?  Are there some underlying feelings making you flirt with each other or are you both just desperate for attention?|`|64b71311b453645560ceb49d58250d08aa	some people are just flirty, when I was a waiter, it just came naturally to me and stayed even when i was off work. when i got married my wife knew how i was. It can cause problems, but i don't think it is wrong if all it is, is flirting.|`|e276df96c55a338c1e69a8869d0cd199aa	Yes.  You are giving the other person the idea that you are interested, when in fact, you are not because you are married.|`|fQYU96euaa	Yes, its wrong, it leads to affairs.|`|tsBL19qzaa	wadfm
AA11375099	I've been married for 26  years, at first we would yell about a lot of stuff, after awhile I realized it only caused us to be angry towards one another, even if you won the fight you lost a lot more than you realize.<br>  <br>  Let things go, don't try to control him and do what he does to you, ignore him when he asks you to do something.  Then he will know how it feels.  You do not even have to argue with him about it.<br>  <br>  I know you love him and he loves you, but there are pressures there in just living together.  So, just don't let things bother you so you can go beyond it.  Sure, it could bug you that he does or does not do certain things but eventually it will work itself out.<br>  <br>  You two are a team, you fight together to get ahead in this hard world.  So, don't become worst enemy's over something that does not matter when it comes to life and death.<br>  <br>  My wife is fighting breast cancer, and I am scared.  It hurts to see her hurting so much and there is not too much I can do to keep the tears away, except hold her.  Losing her breast, the chemotherapy treatments and soon radiation is hard on the body mentally and physically.  So, I do what I can and we never fight.<br>  <br>  Never.  When your loved one could lose their lives, everything is trivial.  Nothing is worth fighting for.  When you both are battling for life, you will become one as a team, the way you were meant to be and realize that you are married to the most perfect partner in the world, and nothing they do matters as much as them just loving you.|`|7foornMVaa	Hes not your dad he is your husband. That means you two are equal.  If he doesnt get that, divorce is in your future. Of course, unless you willing to roll over and just do as he says. You should have known that before you got married.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|RF2YV9ataa	Couple sfight when they dont know how to talk to eachother.  It seems as if this marriage may be missing a steady line of free communication.  True your husbadn seems like a jerk to say hes the boss and doesnt have to listen to anyone but thats not true because he has to listen to YOU! In a marriage there is no definite 1st or second in command.  There i only the 2 of you and its unfortunate that he hasnt learned that yet but dont be discouraged hun because just becase he hasnt learned it yet doens tmean there is no hope for you guys.  I only say this becuase i know it really really works becuase i go but you 2 should try some church marriage counseling sessions.  They can be really fun and can teach you guys the fundamentals of a happy healthy marriage.  Other than that, you need to stand up and tell him he is NOT the boss.  You didnt marry your daddy and you definately dont need him to pretend that he is yours.  Tell him this is an equal relationship adn that yes you love him but he needs to understand that if this marriage is going to work.  That will put it into perspective for him and probably shock him into reality.  Good luck hun :-)|`|B12E4rYiaa	It's difficult to live together no matter if you're married or what the relationship is. No one is the boss it takes compromise and working on issues to come to an agreement on a daily basis. Both people need to work on how they respond to difficulties.|`|IvMPh09baa	so you married a man that wants to control you.... congratulations, you are in a controlling and quite possibly abusive relationship. get help.|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	He's a control freak and a jerk. He is NOT the boss, marriage is a partnership, 50/50.<br>  He's acting like a complete asshole.|`|FhKfyxWlaa	You have an immature marriage. You need counseling.|`|rqNb6FIraa	That isn't a healthy relationship! He is not the "boss". He's your husband and you're his wife not his employee. Marriage is about give and take and excepting eachother's wants and needs, not controlling your spouse. And he's right he doens't HAVE to listen to you but if you're in love then he would. It doesn't seem like you two love eachother equally. Maybe you should think about seeking marriage counseling or getting a divorce.|`|b7bb85526b028b7f92b16c8204ed4012aa	Its a law in Nature that anytime you two of any species together that sooner or later they will fight. In your case however, your husband wants total control over you which isnt right nor fair. A marriage should be 50/50 most of the time. Besides what your husband doesnt fully understand is that behind every good or sucessful man stands a woman; his wife!|`|PHYj1UPwaa	Congratulations...My EX husband was exactly like that..except he used the Bible as his reference...He said God gave him the rights to be the Boss...The Head..I was his idiot under his feet..He even got extremem angry at me when I was outside on a very hot June day in Florida mowing the grass, while he was inside, in a nice air-conditioned house playing with the playstation with his son..14 year old son, that should have been helping me, by the way...Hubby came running and screaming out of the house...fists in the air like a maniac..something about mowing too close to the fence line...I knew at that point, divorce would only be a matter of time... Just think about what kind of life you look forward to when you are married to the BOSS..Good Luck....|`|H3WHxCgaaa	We don't.  We also don't yell at each other like children when we do disagree.  If you two can't "fight fair" then go see a marriage counselor that can help you figure it out.|`|Ag8pE3Cyaa	Normal people don't fight every day. Your husband is not normal. I would not put up with a husband like yours. You should reconsider if you've married the right man for you.|`|tsBL19qzaa	Immaturity.|`|e276df96c55a338c1e69a8869d0cd199aa	It's because you married a jerk that has no respect for you.|`|dYzXluF8aa	Well this is not a marriage it is more that he wants to be in control of you, like the prior postings you do have to fight fair and the relationship should always be 100/100 not 50/50, you should feel like his equal. My husband and I do disagree and fight a lot, but I believe that we do meet at a half-way point, where we can seem to average out, not only his or my way but we work something out to where both of us are happy. A relationship will always have its ups and downs, but you have to be treated with respect and honor. Sorry to say honey you are not treated correctly.|`|4Zdp7fu9aa	WOW... me and my husband we always get along see im the kind of person that if i want to do something i ask my husband because im afraid he will be angry but hes not at all but i dont have a controling  life.. im perfectly happy the way i am with my husband and my son.. Cause if i do something or i say something to my husand he never tells me oo im the boss i dont have to listen to u he just says ok baby and thats itt.. goodluck with u u need help u and ur husband..|`|7be3f4155dcd42f2a8721e0033593ea7aa	Sounds like it's time to get out. If this is a young marriage, all the better. I hope there are no kids caught in this. It will only get worse at that point. <br>  You are not his servant. You both need to work for each other and the partnership. If you want equality, you aren't going to get it from this guy.<br>  Being treated like a slave is a deal breaker.

You need counseling, he needs to admit his mistake and convince you that it will never happen again, and be sincere about it, otherwise,  you will end up apart, because of HIS mistakes,not yours.  If you weren't treating him well, then he should have addressed that in a grown up way, not by having an affair.  Do you really think he used and hurt another woman to get back at you for treating him bad?  I think he said he loved her because he does.  I would consider, is he staying in the marriage for the kids, because he doesn't want to lose assets?  You need to get these questions answered.  Good luck!|`|y4w6ybr3aa	I'm sorry this happened to you and your family.<br>  Relationships are based on trust, if you don't feel like you could ever trust him again, then you should leave him<br>  Good luck with what ever you decide.|`|aMkWajC7aa	well, leave him...he is not worthy being with you anymore...he did that once and he will keep on doing that coz he will jst think that u forgive him...never give a second chance to those husband who are like that...kick his *** to where he belong...|`|ryOXYF8uaa	I'm so sorry this happened to you and your family.<br>  As easy as it is to say, protect your children from their worthless father and leave him. Children shouldn't be dragged through the stress and pain of divorce, so make it simple and quick. Tell your husband what he did was wrong, and you can never fully recover from the pain he put you through, then kick him out and live happily with your four children.<br>  It's not going to be as easy as it sounds, so be prepared for the future pain. To keep you going, think of the future you and your children will have. Let him see his kids, as children shouldn't be locked away from their natural father.<br>  Live your life how you want it and don't let that worthless scumbag keep you down.<br>  Good luck with the future.<br>  x

(no offence) good luck and i hope my advice has sincerly helped you.|`|Uz3qClUgaa	no you should not dear.. try getting rid of this feeling ... kissing on lips is just for your partner dear ... be thoughtful and right in your ways .. the relationship you are talking about is too fragile and pious .. don't ask her .. she might feel annoyed .. tell her that you are with her always and you want to be in touch with her ,, you miss her|`|NXJDsVfNaa	Um, ok that's weird.

This kind of affection crosses a cultural line. I understand what you are saying. My family kisses on the lips. mom, dad, sis...we are hispanic. In the hispanic culture as with many other more affectionate cultures and countries (mainly latin) this is normal and fine. If your feelings are not sexual in nature then this time of family intimacy is a beautiful thing, especially when you have famililes that barely hug. Your father's feelings toward her should not affect your feelings about your sister. Good luck and I hope you two remain close.|`|hiIyp38Daa	firstly give yourself 2 seconds to think... let that thought rest for 2 days or so... feeling like that usually leave after 2 days... if its still there after 2 days, then u should call, wat are u planning to say though? i love you so much i want to kiss you? you can't really freak her out on this one. i guess it could turn out fine really, i mean people peck their moms on the lips... why shouldnt they do the same for their sisters :p make sure she knows though that ur not atracted to her, its just mutual love :p

YQ1Q7XeEaa	I do not know you family life.  I do know you are a victim of psychological abuse which is why you still care for someone you admit you are afraid of.<br>  <br>  There is only one way to stop the pain.  You must leave and NEVER see this man again.  Get that?  Never.  No matter how nice or charming or remorseful or threatening he becomes he will only be trying to lure you into the trap again.<br>  <br>  I would try returning to your family.  I don't know what they are like but if they love you they will take you in.<br>  <br>  I leave you this story to hope upon: Luke 15:11-24<br>  <br>  11Jesus continued: "There was a man who had two sons. 12The younger one said to his father, 'Father, give me my share of the estate.' So he divided his property between them. <br>   13"Not long after that, the younger son got together all he had, set off for a distant country and there squandered his wealth in wild living. 14After he had spent everything, there was a severe famine in that whole country, and he began to be in need. 15So he went and hired himself out to a citizen of that country, who sent him to his fields to feed pigs. 16He longed to fill his stomach with the pods that the pigs were eating, but no one gave him anything. <br>  <br>   17"When he came to his senses, he said, 'How many of my father's hired men have food to spare, and here I am starving to death! 18I will set out and go back to my father and say to him: Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. 19I am no longer worthy to be called your son; make me like one of your hired men.' 20So he got up and went to his father. <br>        "But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was filled with compassion for him; he ran to his son, threw his arms around him and kissed him. <br>  <br>   21"The son said to him, 'Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son.[a]' <br>  <br>   22"But the father said to his servants, 'Quick! Bring the best robe and put it on him. Put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet. 23Bring the fattened calf and kill it. Let's have a feast and celebrate. 24For this son of mine was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.' So they began to celebrate.|`|4cpeg0dZaa	I understand your situation, i  think that you should build that confidence and strenght you had when you ran out of your house and do the same thing now. Good luc kbelieve in yourself YOU CAN DO IT.|`|6R9McFZhaa	I know that i don't have point for this but baby first you have to leave all that drama queen ,and decide what the best for you ,that relation start only for the first bf in your life or a good sex ...almost all the teen do it don't worry but now you are not anymore so put your head on your shoulder and think the best way is to go back to your family but you have to see if he looks for you again you are going to come back to him ,if you are going to move out is because you want another life ,and believe your relation is not going to have another direction ,that it one experience in your life that you can teach your children ,talk to your parents if they say not then baby try to rent in another place you have age to work and study at the same time ,but first put everything in your mind that you are going to have a better future ,look around you and see what you have in four years of your relation and see if you deserve more|`|vYeTegZNaa	If you been in that relationship for so long technically you should own half of what he owns.. so what i think you should do is get back in contact with family, Friends someone you can trust take all your belongings and go stay with them for a while until you can think clearly.. your bf sounds like a right A hole.. so u defo get in touch with the police just in case act that he doesn't like the fact that you're gone..|`|7ImGw976aa	You need to sit up and start thinking 'what's best for me'.<br>  You need to sit 'Mike' down and tell him like it is, if he won't listen or accept it then you can throw back that he's not willing to help because his maturity level is to low. And next time he tries to verbally abuse you, you don't have to just take it, do talk back about what you think about that or just walk out and leave the room if he's not going to stop going on.<br>  By the sounds of it you've got the question of: Should I really stay with him? You might just think you love him because he's brought down your self esteem but it doesn't mean you 100% really do and plus once again you really have to say to yourself, what am I getting out of the relationship? Does it make me happy?<br>  Also possibly contact your parents, you might be able to sit down and discuss things with them.<br>  Think about going to college so you can get a better job and do something you like.<br>  Also try and maybe get some counseling so you can improve your confidence. Just visit your GP and explain.|`|92kDhDcMaa	Take a deep breath, and remind yourself that you can do anything you put your mind to, with the right motivation.<br>  <br>  Sometimes it seems like we've completely run out of options, and it gets so depressing we can close our eyes to the ways out in front of us. Just don't let it hold you down. Accept that things are bad right now, but not without a commitment to making it better. Talk to people. If you haven't been able to garner any good friendships, talk to the most trustworthy coworker you have and try to develop one. If you've cut ties with your family, talk to an aunt or uncle or grandparent you think may be understanding, even if you haven't contacted them in ages. Check out internet support groups... hell, check out old-fashioned, sit-in-a-circle type support groups while you're at it. At any rate, do whatever you can to lift your head out of the vicious cycle it's fallen into and FIGHT. Find your motivation to make your life better. You deserve it, don't you?|`|xCifmFfkaa	You made your bed, now you need to lie in it.<br>  <br>  And by lying in it, doesn't nessecarily mean stay put and take more of his abuse...<br>  <br>  If you're gonna get out, you're gonna do it with yourself and not a lot else... I would want to think you ran away from SOMEWHERE 4 years ago... Find that place/those people.

I have been where you are and yes it is hard for awhile, but it does get better and there ae better men out there.  No money = move in with family until you can get back on your feet.  You do not need that in you life, especially that young.  You will find that you can be happy.  It is tough to do, but you just need to do it.  Like I said, I was in that situation once.  Do not tell him you ae moving, and just do it when he is not home.  Good luck.|`|e276df96c55a338c1e69a8869d0cd199aa	You created your life, only you can change it.  Seek professional counseling.

When girls ask questions on here about liking a guy but they have a girlfriend and what should they do..... most of the answers are that they should "go for it", "he really likes you so you should call him", etc.  Situations like you're in now are the result of the girls who don't have any respect for relationships.<br>  <br>  The other thing is the age difference.  Four years you've been together so that would have made you 16 and him 26......Again, when people on here ask about age difference, most people say it doesn't matter!  Well it does matter because you are at two totally different phases of your life.<br>  <br>  When people answer these types of questions, they need to think about the consequences of their advice.  When it benefits one person, there's another one getting hurt!<br>  <br>  A bit off topic here, but I think both of those scenarios could possibly apply here....that's why I mentioned it!<br>  <br>  Anyway....yes I think he's cheating on you and the more he's trying to justify his actions by flipping it back to you and tell you you're acting crazy the guiltier he is.  Not only is he cheating on you, but his flirting with his cashiers is totally not acceptable or appropriate for a workplace.<br>  <br>  Don't try to make any excuses for his behaviour....there are NO good excuses for being unfaithful.  He shouldn't need a harem to feel good about himself.  If he loves you and knows you love him, that should be all the affirmation he needs!<br>  <br>  Cheating is an absolute deal breaker!  If he was my boyfriend, he'd be gone!|`|4EWCegiRaa	You sound like you're going crazy BUT I would be crazy too if I was manipulated by someone since I was 16 years old. <br>  <br>  Remember when you were 16 and he was 26 and people said "he's too old for you"???  Well, this is what they were talking about.  You're so blind to his mindgames... I doubt this is the end of the rabbit hole.|`|Oz5F8Alfaa	Yes, he's cheating for sure.  get rid of him before you be more hurt.|`|QJslTCUBaa	What it sounds like to me, is that he's a loser. but you already know that.|`|OOYc7Mbfaa	As they say, if you have to ask the question...|`|nUq4A3Xcaa	Stop right there.  How did you feel after posting this?  Now is this jack@ss really worth this much, time, effort and emotion?  You don't need to ask us if he's cheating, you already know the b@stard is.  You are not the same person at 20 that you were at 16.  Get rid of this guy and enjoy being single, play the field and find a respectable guy.|`|0fbcc59fc901bca7e0ca600714a7fb88aa	so if you were 16 and he was 26?  I being a mother, would have had words with him and a serious talk with you.  What do you think he's doing if this is most likely how he got you.  He's not going to grow up.  Get out, while you still have the ability to have a life.  Then, I would call the company he works for and fill them in.|`|LHnVjJqsaa	just me being me and tracy h pretty much sum up what i was going to say.....get the eff outtta that relationshpi!!  if you dont you'll be broken beyond repair by his stupidity...he is only gonna hurt you honey trust me i have been there...<br>  <br>  and btw how long did it take you to convince yourself that those messages were innocent? just ask yourself that<br>  <br>  and btw....do you really think your gonna gain some insight from someone else? do you think some magical comment is going to just give you the strength to do it and not get hurt??  NOOO<br>  <br>  so make like nike, and just do it...before it gets worse and worse you are wasting time (the best time) of ur life!
5fdgfNCRaa	I understand why you wouldn't want to go. Who would if they were in your shoes?<br>  Tell your friend how you feel. Ask how she'd feel about you not going and let her know that you're uncomfortable with the hurtful comments that people make, thinking that they're harmless.<br>  Whatever you do, don't just not show. She'll take it personally - I would, if my best friend didn't come to my baby shower. <br>  <br>  If you're ok with being "phased out" of friendships since you "can't relate," I think that action speaks for itself. They want to exclude you on any given day because the conversation might turn in the direction of boyfriends or babies.. so on a day that solely revolves around babies? It shouldn't be a shock to them if you "opt out" since you "can't relate." <br>  <br>  If you want to try to maintain your friendships, you could try to talk to them and let them know that you don't mind that they're girlfriends/wives/mothers and that you still like spending time with them. If you don't want to, just move on. Friendships don't always stay as close as they are now.<br>  My two best friends are having babies - one is due in March, the other in May. Ever since they got pregnant, they seem to be drifting away from me. It hurts, since they're like my sisters, but I'll be able to move on. <br>  You'll be okay too :)|`|BDjBVdtRaa	you should try to learn what you can to help you when you get into a relationship or have a baby and you will be closer to your friends. so its a win win|`|C0uMGfCCaa	ask her if she really wants you to go. tell her i fell like i'm being rejected and i need to know if really want me there or not.|`|WJX994D2aa	It will matter.

It is also very rude of your friends to tell you that you can't relate, even if you can't relate it isn't a friendly thing to say because you should be allowed to be with your friends at times like those if you wanted to.|`|DoR81lgaaa	shes your best friend. i think you should go because friends are supposed to be there with you through thick and thin. just because you think people will bombard you with questions dosen't mean you shouldnt be there with her. if you really feel bad you should sit down with her and say:"look... i think your to young to have a baby but no matter what i'll be there by your side the whole time."   thats what i told my bf and shes only 13!|`|JhvqUvlsaa	I would go since she is your best friend; go with a smile. I'm thinking everyone will be having such a good time and gushing over her that there won't be as much of the comments as you think. And if there are some comments, just smile and say "someday I'll have kids; but not right now." <br>  It would mean a lot to your friend so I would go. =)|`|EjyD1sXeaa	there is always going to be a "last" person to be in a relationship or start a family, and it's you this time.<br>  Just ask yourself, "are they really true friends treating you like this?"<br>  having a baby is not a competition and you shouldn't be ostarcized because you're not pregnant.<br>  <br>  In your shoes, I would go on holiday for a few days while they're having the baby shower. Life moves on and perhaps it's time for your friendship to move on too
WDs4fRoxaa	She is depressed.<br>  <br>  She has issues that only a professional can help with.<br>  <br>  I think she forces you all to be in her life so that she is<br>  not alone. It is how she keeps control over you all.<br>  <br>  She could not control what happened with your dad, so<br>  she is trying to maintain control over all of you.<br>  <br>  Have all of your siblings meet you at her house, and<br>  all of you sit down to talk with her.<br>  <br>  Explain that she needs to seek treatment to deal with<br>  your dad's death and anything else that might be bothering<br>  her.<br>  <br>  Let her know that none of you will be over to take out her<br>  trash, or do any other chores that she should be doing.<br>  <br>  From this point forward she is going to have to get help<br>  and learn to live her life.<br>  <br>  Best wishes|`|DBVJ7AIMaa	I'd give anything to have my mum back, even if she made unreasonable demands, so tread carefully as you will miss her when she's gone. <br>  For now, why don't you all take it in turns to visit her once a week. That way you and your siblings all get a break. <br>  If she feels that is unreasonable, calmly explain the the alternative is no visits.<br>  There's no reason then why you can't make a fuss on special days, because that's what they are, special days and anniversaries. They stop being special when every time you see her has to be a 'red letter day.'|`|b5eSmOhiaa	I wouldn't say she's spoiled rotten.  Maybe she just feels you owe her for all the things she did for you when you were a child.  Even if she raised you badly, you're still alive.|`|AA10500537	soinds like something you;ve always done and she still expects it . draw away from her a bit and she;ll get her own life as long as she;s well and can care for herself|`|Tyi6rEtcaa	Got a friend/tenant with a mother the same way....RUN!!!!!!!!!!!|`|tCmwFJn5aa	There is an amount of respect that you should always give your mother.  If my mother wanted me to...  I would never hesitate to go and clean her house, cook and do anything for her.  She took care of you on her own afterall.  She deserves the same, appreciation.<br>  <br>  I don't think that your mom is spoiled rotten.  From all the info that you wrote, I feel that she may be depressed and in need of anti-depressants.  Take her to see a counselor or bring one to her.|`|Ot2tJXU2aa	Smart girl! Your mom is spoiled! Are you living with her? I have to ask because if you are and a lot of children you know don't find doing housework and living under their parents roof a responsibility of theirs? But it sounds like you aren't so I say CUT the apron strings, but don't stop the red carpet for her birthday or Mother's Day wouldn't you want a little pampering and appreciation from your children and there's nothing wrong with a lot especially if she wants/likes/needs it? But going over to clean her house and doing other duties for nothing more than enabling her to sit down and ignore her own responsibilities on a daily basis really isn't helping her at all.  She will be mad but if you guys stick to your decision to redirecting your terms of an adult relationship with her things will change eventually, but it all takes time!|`|Y9gy11rsaa	Parents often forget that because they made us does not mean they own us.  Because they raised us does not mean that we owe them anything - they chose to have us and to raise us.  Respect is something that is earned not something that is a right.  Help is something to be given not something to be demanded.  <br>  <br>  I think you and your siblings should write her a letter - agreed upon together - telling her that you love her but that you all now have your own lives and that you are willing to help out as soon as she changes her attitude.  I do think that you all need to be in agreement and it's very important that you all lay down ground rules and stick to them.   Maybe sitting down with her and making a timetable for her chores would help - maybe she simply can't get her head around the running of a household and panics?<br>  <br>  Does she have friends?  If not you should consider encouraging her to join some social groups so that she can get a life!|`|mF0L5jMNaa	Narcissism.  She is thinking that she is nothing unless she is the center of attention.  A 59 yr old woman (close to my age) should be way beyond this.  Parents are supposed to be pleased when their children have interests beyond them.  We are happy for them when they have homes of their own to take care of.  <br>  <br>  Tell Mom she should start looking at assisted living facilities if she is no longer able to take care of herself and her home.

Be straight with yourself and with him, just ask him what is giving him that feeling.

Ten years later, he can still tell and it doesn't bother me anymore, unless I am mad at him for some silly reason, or because he can still read me so well.|`|0fbcc59fc901bca7e0ca600714a7fb88aa	Girl, my husband is that way.  Its their insecurity that they feel they are doing something wrong.  I just have to reassure my husband that nothing is wrong, and after awhile, I merely tell him to knock it off or something will be wrong and thats because he is reading way to far into something that just shouldn't be read into.  I love my husband dearly and I know he loves me the same.  My husband also says that he can't believe he has me.  That I am so beautiful and sexy (I think I'm average).  I think because of his insecurities throughout his life, has rolled over into wanting to make sure everything is right with me so he doesn't have the fear of  wake up one day and realize it was all just a dream.<br>  Thats what I think.  Take care|`|LHnVjJqsaa	say honey...if you dont stop asking..there WILL be something wrong...in the nicest way possible...maybe he is reaching out to you cause HE has soemthing wrong..when he asks, u ask him too...maybe he si trying to tell you something
VZVGXRyraa	Everybody can be in love. It's an emotion that courses through every single person. Sometimes though, feelings are misread and people believe something they're feeling is love when it's not...this has a tendency to happen in young to mid teens who're over the top lovestruck, but it also catches a lot of adults.<br>  <br>  Truth is, only you know if you're in love, nobody else. Only you know what's in your heart and head. This may be the real thing...it may not be the real thing...time will tell and if it is, great; if it's not, plenty more fish in the sea. Don't let anyone tell you that you can't be in love, it's BS.|`|gjtdLPIYaa	no because first of all you are 17 and have sex. you have no self respect for your self. most likely he wont be the "last face you will see before you die" you may think you are mature for your age . but it's clear that you are not. mature up|`|hlvdPjeFaa	It depends on your feelings. No one can judge that for you. However, i think the real problem is present when there's too wide an age gap. Things just don't work out then.

But if you do want to give them something get them a book to read; ask what kinds of books they like to read. Crossword puzzle books seem to be popular with elderly folks too. Or maybe a houseplant that is easy to care for; now that it's almost spring there's a lot of plants to choose from at the stores and nurseries now.<br>  These are things I gave my elderly friends and it worked out pretty well; I hope something I said helped you too. =)|`|NiYIPrkQaa	If you can give your time that is always great! But if you really want to give a gift try a small pet that would be easy to take care of but also provide them with entertainment and the feeling of being responsible for the pet. Try Gold Fish, or a small dog, or even better a cat, they are more independent. Research shows that pets have a calming affect on the elderly.|`|yUIODXRzaa	yeah definitly attension<br>  my grandpa likes when my neices read storys to him lol idkk<br>  and he just likes when i sit and talk to him :)|`|r4iAS9rgaa	Attentions.. visiting hours are what they enjoy mostly...just sit and talk to them.|`|vcXffsDGaa	A tub of Steradent?

But it also depends on their personalities. Like liberal personalities may be best, Conservative is maybe a no no. My mom wouldn't mind answering anything at all my man asked her, but my dad would rather keep off the subject all together about pretty much anything and everything. Just make sure they're easy going people and I don't think you should have a problem.|`|835887bcb03d75a14ac83bf2c7e41048aa	Don`t make that mistake.

None of us when marrying into another family is or ever will be good enough for their child according to the in laws so you really dont want to show them right by asking questions which they may deem stupid and ignorant, although they may seem harmless to you at the time. dont give them any ammo that they can use against you later. Marriages are hard enough so you dont need in laws looking for any excuse to put you down. Hope this makes sense|`|IvMPh09baa	yes.  your marriage is not anyones business but you and your husbands.  i would only seek advice from an unbiased person, such as a counselor or professional in regards to my marriage.|`|scnW0Wzeaa	Asking in laws anything is horrible all around.|`|AA10684513	I wouldn't ask your parents or your inlaws any questions.

There are some things that they just should not know.|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	keep it between you and your husband. it is no one elses buissness|`|lQouIoCraa	dont you mean the outlaws? If they are not the outlaws now, someday they will be.  Chances are they are already judging you way too harshly for not being good enough for their son/daughter, It would not be wise to give them more ammo for down the road.  Also think of the trust you may injure between you and your spouse.. just a thought, but many of us here at ANSWERS are pretty nonjudgemental.  You just have to read between the lines.|`|AA10698189	Definitely dont ask them anything!  They will always be biased!  Find a friend to ask - anything but the inlaws.|`|zMg4hQwDaa	yes, no questions are good because they will make assumptions you have no control over, and that could create more problems. they will also feel invited to meddle.|`|AA11363993	I wouldn't. It will just make them noisy, and try to interfere in your marriage.  I would ask a minister or friends.|`|MtDEf9zxaa	It all depends on who they are.

Im feeling brave this week. So Ive decided Im going to tell her this week, Maybe a letter, Maybe get another friend to tell her, Maybe pluck up the courage to tell her myself.. So The answer is...

I54KyS8Laa	If your boyfriend were to stay with you he'd be what is defined as an "enabler."  His presence would simply enable you to continue your habits. Break them, forget about them and then bring him into your life. <br>  He is not the answer to you solving your problems. First it's important for you to learn how to like and love you, then others (he included) can be with you. <br>  Begin reading about self image. An old stand-by is Psycho Cybernetics by Maxwell Maltz and you most likely can find it in any library or you can get it at Amazon for fifty cents. <br>  Then read "Your Erroneous Zones" by Wayne Dyer--easy to find. <br>  Your mind is like an incredible computer that somehow has caught some disastrous suggestions. You can learn to feed your mind the right suggestions--these books will help you do that. <br>  Even though I counsel over the phone, I wouldn't want to work with you until you've read these basic books. It's like you're in third grade but haven't read the first and second grade books yet so how could we talk about third grade (just chose an arbitrary grade). You have some homework, that unfortunately no one has told you about yet, to do. <br>  The bottom line is that your problems are as serious as you choose to make them and you have the power (yet to be discovered) to dissolve them. <br>  <br>  Read those basic books and then call me if the books and what I said makes sense. And maybe you'll be calling just to tell me that what I said led you to solve your issues. <br>  <a href="http://dstressdoc.com/counseling.htm" rel="nofollow">http://dstressdoc.com/counseling.htm</a>    <br>  <br>  Richard K.|`|CdTe8MO4aa	cutting your self isn't making anyone feeling sorry for you<br>  you could maybe start a new hobby like painting or drawing<br>  maybe save up and get a tattoo<br>  while he is gone you need to learn to be your own friend<br>  stop being your own enemy<br>  when you can learn to love your self then you can love others|`|BzGnuWs4aa	I believe him.

It is unfair of you to expect him to take more than he can handle.  Boyfriends and girlfriends are not obligated to do a thing.  They are not obligated to stick around when things get tough.  They do that because they want to.  He did it already and now it's happening again and he's scared to death.  What did you expect him to do?<br>  <br>  You never know, he might come back.  If he does, you better appreciate it because it sounds like he's really at the breaking point right now and it sounds like because of your situation he might need some help of his own because he's been drained.

There is a song out of the 50s that goes something like " If you want to be happy for the rest of your life, never make a pretty woman your wife..." .

mfwNdPGXaa	wow. Basically it's HIS deal, his problem. Try not to worry about her, and stay out of her way (and her house). You guys are going to have to hang out elsewhere until she gets over it. Over all it doesn't sound like too big of a deal, other than she def runs her mouth. She was pissed at him, not really you. i would back the he** off of the situation and if your boyfriend insists that you come over, you make darn sure he already told his mama that you were going to come over. If stuff gets awkward again, do the same thing...get your stuff and leave. Tell your boyfriend that the situation makes you uncomfortable, and thats the bottom line. If he cares for you, he will make it a priority to smooth things over with his mom, for your sake. <br>  Don't fret though...boyfriends moms always suck! <br>  ; )|`|K71ZlPWgaa	long question, short answer<br>  a. apologies for Your role<br>  b. talk to your boyfriend about it and decide your best course of action<br>  c. don't be scared to go round to there house<br>  d. bring a present, chocolates or something<br>  don't worry be happy:)|`|LLeQyWGcaa	the mother is mad because he is spending more time with you and not as much with her. she has a hard time letting her little boy grow up. time will  pass and things will get better. sounds like a screwed up family to me.|`|Co7BtKiPaa	get a new god damn boyfriend.<br>  jeesh.<br>  is everything that complicated?|`|AA10628838	Sounds like the trash on Jerry Springer. No wonder our world is the way it is. No one can have respect for one another.|`|1hciyvKdaa	His mom, was calling you, her sons gf for some help. You blew it, she really for some reason, wanted you to help her out. You didnt say she was rude, you were just suprised. She took you and her sons relationship seriously. You were wrong to complain about it to your bf, telling him is one thing, saying your pissed, why? Anyhow, so he calls mom and goes off, so now shes shocked, thinking she hung up from her possible maybe daughter in law some day, so now she is made, at her son, now you. You stirred up a can of wasps. <br>  Remember sometimes us moms do odd things, there is no book of rules in life telling anyone how these relationships go. Unless I read something wrong or you failed to mention something. <br>  She thought you might be able to help her, you dont know what shes asked him to do that he may off pushed off and said no you do it Im going to my gfs house, you have no clue, only they do. So can you imagine if you had simply said, somehow nicely to make sure you both do things for your parents so they stay happy about you two both going out, and how easy that would of been, and none of this would be happening now? Its pretty simple, actions have reactions. Positive actions breed positive outcomes. <br>  I say, you owe his mom an appology, if she accepts it, you may have a wonderful friend for life, you wont know if you dont try. All families are not alike, its ok they are not.  Her language to you was uncalled for, but forget it, this is someone you have to deal with, take the upper hand and try to undo the wrong. Even if you dont feel its your fault, bite your tongue appologize, it could realy pay off and teach you more about dealing with people.PIck real battles, not petty ones such as this it will help you in life more to learn that ok.Peace out.|`|ew3Wl6hKaa	OMG that lady is CRAZY!!!!! do NOT go over to his house, obviously she doesn't like u so why sould u go somewhere where ur not wanted!!! tell ur bf if he wants to see u than it will be ar ur house or somewhere public (in case his mom chases u guys down and tries to kill u!!!) but it also sounds like his family is pretty messed up!! they should have shown u some respect, u were a guest in the house and they should have kept the family drama between themselves not made u feel all awkward!!<br>  PS- don't bother apologizing because u didnt do anything wrong she's the one that called UR phone, if she has a problem with ur relationship with her son she needs to deal with HIM not you, ur not her kid and ur not dating HER ur dating her SON!! she needs to grow up and act like the adult that she is not a high school brat|`|m2T75uOYaa	Break-up with him.

You have  to be able to get along somewhat with his family in order to have a healthy relationship. What she is doing is VERY wrong and so childish and by no means should you take that kind of abuse, but you need to take a step back and look at the big picture. Is that the kind of family you really want to be a part of? If you can't even have a civil conversation with an "adult" there is a BIG problem. If I were you I would keep myself away from that unhealthy environment.|`|JFJF3GPWaa	All you can do is explain to him how you feel. If he tries to make you go round there he is a bad boyfriend because he shouldn't try and push you into doing anything you don;t want to do.<br>  I don't know what is going on with the mother other than maybe she's being over protective of her son. But i don't think it's a good idea for you to go round there again because his mother obviously thinks your unwelcome. If you are still going out in another 4/5 months time if your up to it try going round there again and see how it goes.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps x|`|OvBmXfZmaa	Well, boyfriend momma drama sucks.. (first I think it's weird she called you in the first place) I would suggest maybe talking to his mom and saying you never meant for things to be like they are and get outta hand, and see if things can be worked out.  And if she still doesn't want you at her house, go to your house, or sit OUTSIDE his house, then you aren't inside her house like she said.  There are alot of other things that you and your boyfriend can do besides go to his house.. think of something creative that will be fun without his mom's drama.  Good Luck =)|`|angW1Lkfaa	Me I would stay away,  I had a similar problem my brother and his wife couldn't define parent the state   was ready to take their boys and I ended you raising them, my brothers wife drove me nuts. Had to get a block on my phone, then she would come over, had to get a no trespassing order, then a no contact order. This went on for 12 years. <br>  You don't need to put up with this flat don't go over. I pray you to aren't to serious, I guarantee you two get married (no offense but you have kids) and she will make your life a living hell.  Your boyfriend is not considerate<br>  of your situation. He has no right to put you in that environment. Is this a preview of what your life becomes. I'm not trying to chase you off but run.|`|mldo1vxYaa	This woman doesnt want you in her house, she has made it clear twice and yet you still go there, Im sorry but if I told someone they werent welcome in my house and they showed up they wouldnt be getting in. I think you should count yourself lucky she let you in.<br>  <br>  She thinks you are changing her son into someone she doesnt like, and by ringing him and telling him everything she said that just proved it to her which is why she rang you back so angry. Your bf shouldnt have rang her and given out to her, he needs to cop on to himself, you both do.<br>  <br>  This is easy to fix, tell him to stop being an ***, help his mom some more around the house or whatever she wants and then maybe she will see you are not as bad as she thinks.|`|C0uMGfCCaa	wow thats intense. i compeletely understand how you fell. what you should do is call the mom and politely say what exactly happened.|`|cwuBl93Zaa	TRY APOLOGIZING TO HIS MOM AND TRY TO MAKE A RELATION WITH HER. WELL IDK. THATS ABOUT THE BEST I CAN SAY.|`|nKFz3WK7aa	I didn't understand one word of that|`|AA11140814	Looks like his mom over-reacted. i am sure he has tried to explain to her what an idiot she is, but even if he hasn't give the situation some time to cool down before trying to go over there again. Trust me, if she catches you it will only start more drama.  <br>  <br>  <br>  Keep your mouth shut, tell your man to help out more and please her. In like a month or so she will have forgotten about it.|`|EtIIlqebaa	Wooow. K that is harsh. I feel terrible for you! Uhm, you should have a talk with your boyfriend, obviously theres a few family issues going on they need to work out. Ask him why he doesn't do anything around the house, and ask him to have a chat with his mom about what he can do to help out, and maybe talk to her about you. Because i really don't think this could possibly be your fault, and to blame it on you is immature. Later after he has done that, even though you may get scared, ask to have a CALM talk with his mom. Be pleasant and respectful, and tell her you love her son, and You like seeing him, and you're sorry if things have seemed difficult because of you. Ask her if there's any way she will forgive you, and anything you can do. I know, it's hard, because you might not mean that but adults need to hear what they WANT, y'know? I hope things get better. you really need to work this out, because this could end up causing big stresses on your relationship. Good luck!|`|HPO87jGiaa	Oh wow, crazy story.  I'm in a similar situation, I don't want to go to my girlfriend's house because her mom is a crazy *****.  Well anyways, what I would do is not go over there until things settle down.  Obviously they have a dysfunctional household going on over there and your boyfriend has an attitude.  So until he fixes that and has a better home life, I would suggest staying away from that house, and if your boyfriend forces you to go, refuse him and tell him that you're very uncomfortable and that you would appreciate it if he respected your decision to not go to his house until things settle down over there.|`|JizwgEiYaa	If you really haven't done anything wrong, then continue to be respectful to her. Find a new place to hang out and no matter what, don't lower yourself to her level.Don't go back there if you feel threatened or uncomfortable.|`|M71hN9OBaa	sit down with his mom & have a respectful conversation. if she tries to curse at you again, tell her she's being immature & that you're trying to resolve whatever issue she has with you. tell her you'll try to tell your boyfriend to help around the house.|`|RvqpJRFYaa	do not go over there... if he wants you to come over he will see that his mom is wrong and MAKE her call and apologize to you. end of story. Until he does that do not go over there!!|`|aUfag6Yhaa	I understood you.  <br>  <br>  Wow.  What a situation.  The question is "how much do you like Mark?"  Because if you keep this relationship going you'll be seeing a whole lot more of his mom and the rest of his family.  <br>  <br>  With his mother acting like this - you might be best not to go over there.  She really used that kind of language with you?  Shame on her.  I would never do that to my kids, much less right in front of their friends.  To me, she isn't thinking at all of how much she is embarrassing  her son, and also making  you feel like you are completely unwelcome.  That's just not right.  She's knows that I"m sure so why she's doing it is something only she knows.  <br>  <br>  I'm a  mom so I notice what you said about not being allowed out because you got in trouble in school.  That's good.  You might not think it is, but it tells me that your family cares about  you and wants to see you do the right thing.  Does  your mom know about what Mark's mother said to you?  If anyone treated my daughter like that - I'd be knocking on their door and demanding why.  No kidding.  That's just awful.  <br>  <br>  Also, I don't like it that Mark's mother called you in the first place.  He had  a right to be upset about it.  If she has a problem with what Mark's doing at home, that's with him.  She should never call you unless there's a good reason, like inviting  you to her house for dinner or something like that.  Aside from that, "the mom" is supposed to stand back and not put herself into her kid's personal life - without some kind of very very good reason like drugs or alcohol.  But, there wasn't anything like that, and still you got that treatment.  <br>  <br>  What you need to do in my opinion is think about how you feel toward Mark.  If you are at all unsure or if his mom has changed things - then you might want to give yourself a break from him for a while at least.  But that's your decision.  His mom is probably not going to stop acting like this unless she is talked to, and if that doesn't work, you are really in for a troublesome time.  <br>  <br>  I hope this all works out for you.  I hope Mark's mom realizes that she was wrong and treats you with courtesy from here on.  What I always tell my daughter is that she deserves to be treated with respect.  No exceptions.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|c0plf0VLaa	Oh my gosh.. From having to deal with my man's crazy family, you need to have yours stand up for you. He needs to tell his mom that she was rude for calling and talking smack about him to you, how could she expect you to not say something to him? It definitely sounds like she's threatened by you because she's "losing her baby boy" (know what I mean?)<br>  <br>  The first time I ever met Nick's mom, she was tipsy on wine (and it was like, 4 in the afternoon) and she spent a half hour rambling to me about how much of a slut her daughter (his sister) is because she had just gotten pregnant with her boyfriend of 2 mo. A month later she called my parents while I was out with Nick and told them I was doing coke (NEVER touched it in my entire life!!!).. Sometimes it just takes them a little while to get used to you, you know? Moms usually just want whats best for their kids.<br>  <br>  Good luck hun =)|`|eZj1qCd7aa	I know you really love your boyfriend, but sometimes the outside enviroment can interfere. If your boyfriend's mom really doesn't like you I have to say the best thing to do is break-up with him. I'm soorrryy but the only thing that you might be able to do is get your boyfriend to do more things in his house. I'm really sorry but this is complicated and I would just break up with him.|`|pFkGJlntaa	You are dealing with something beyond your control.  First of all, never do anything that you don't want, especially if you do not feel comfortable doing.  Why put yourself in that position.<br>  <br>  Secondly, it is not your place to do something about your boyfriend's parents.  Stay away from them.  It is up to your boyfriend how he wants to deal with his own parents.  <br>  <br>  how old are you guys anyway ?  <br>  <br>  Don't allow yourself to be miserable.  If you do, then you are doing this to yourself.  There is nothing you can do about his parents.  That is not your concern.  You can not control people.  And they are not positive for you.  Lots of drama.  Keep away from them.  Unless you like being involved in this kinda stuff.<br>  <br>  You know the answer.  You just have to do something about it.  Your question is so long.. and it has nothing to do with you.. it is just about a bunch of people screaming and yelling because they are not happy.  Where is the love ?|`|pvDVFrKwaa	Mothers are always very very protective over their boys. I have that problem with my boyfriends mom at times.<br>  <br>  I also have seen the family that hated the girlfriend. <br>  <br>  I think you need to communicate with them. Dont be afraid to as your bf to sit you all down and just talk about what is going on. Discuss the problems his mom has with him not being around. Push him to listen to her. Explain that the phone call situation was a mix up and get her to start over with you. Tell her things like you really like her and you really love her son and you wnat to stay a part of the family<br>  <br>  this may turn her heart around. Ive rarely seen a mother that didnt gave to that
UpRdvpmXaa	He's definetly attracted to you to be asking for it 20 times before you leave the house in the morning. Sex is a way that a couple can show their love for one another. I think once we start thinking of it as just an act of pleasure then we start thinking of it as a duty that just takes up time. The way men go about trying to get it definetly affects his wifes reaction on whether or not they want to do it. <br>  If he's just flat out asking "can we have sex?" That kind of may sound like "hey lets squeeze in this other task tonight" to a woman. But if he find the right time to tell you that he loves you and adds a little romance to the interlude before sex, it would make it more appealing. <br>  I think the agitating fact may just be that sex is seen as a chore or a task. You don't owe anyone sex but your relationship is owed intimacy and a sense of union. Maybe you can talk to him about why you're not interested as much as he is and maybe you can both talk about things you can do to make it more appealing...like adding a romantic gesture (candles, bubble bath, a surprise bubble bath with wine and music in the background, a trip). Its all about love and unity. A gentle offer such as a massage and words of endearment might really be a good lead in to the act of making love because its the love that should be at focus and not just the sex. <br>  I think having sex once a week is reasonable for a very busy married couple...but remember making love is a connection between two people, which really helps in a marriage. Its what separates your relationship with each other from your relationship with anyone else (that connection). <br>  I'm a guy and I understand that when my fiance is tired, she appreciates a back rub but I'm not gonna be trying anything on her tonight (we don't have sex yet but after marriage...thank god we will). <br>  Just talk to him about why you're not as interested as he is...maybe you just need to add a bit more romance into the relationship...try something new. Take a trip and just focus on the two of you (if you have kids, promise some family members some favors).  Its important that you sit down and talk about this because you're both unhappy about it and its not good to leave things unresolved and who knows it could be a quick fix....... such as you need the romance (as does he) and he might like it about once or twice a week (which you might just enjoy if romance is added to the mix and not just him asking for sex). <br>  I can only imagine the response my fiance would give me if I asked her for sex after marriage. "Hey honey, I want sex." She'd look at me and just shrug "um...i guess. I have to finish this paperwork and then I'll see", which wouldn't make me feel really good. But if you start with the romance like giving her a massage (which I'm for because I love her) or just talking about how much I love her...i can see a better response, where she doesn't think she's doing something for me but rather we're doing it for each other. <br>  <br>  Good luck and God Bless :)|`|kbz5S3waaa	haha, our roles are reversed, i'm the one that gets all edgy and feel like i want to have sex every single day. Why are you holding out from him, yes this is the real world, and you're married so sex is apart of that.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	Why would you go w/o sex for a week or more? Some women use this as a tool to feel powerful, however, sex is a vital part of marriage and if you don't want sex more than once a week you need to go to a therapist and find out why to rule out any physical abnormalities. You seem to be under the delusion that sex is something to be rationed...that is not how it works in a healthy marriage.|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	I cant get enough of my fiance, we do sex whenever and wherever we want and he is gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous, admittedly we have only been together since Nov 06 and not 7 years like you but honestly the way I feel about him gets stronger and stronger each time I see him.<br>  We are getting married in June and neither of us can wait, its the second time around for both of us so we are not kids and because of the way we feel about each other I am certain we wont ever lose that spark.<br>  How bad would it be for you to accommodate your husband in this ? after all you loved him once.|`|f9sL3WgQaa	I am the same as your husband.. Nope I am so cranky unless I get it everyday and that still isn't enough.  <br>  <br>  His sex drive affects everything else in his life. The way he sleeps, eats, works out, the way he is at work, the way he is with you, helping around the house and so on. It could be apart of maybe a depression that he has...if he is like me...sex is my "uppers" and without it I get very depressed and moody.<br>  <br>  your so called "real world" is what you make it. I'm telling you if you are looking for your "real husband" if you miss him..just give him sex for a week straight and you will see the difference.  he will be so nice and sweet and loving towards you and the rest of the world.|`|AuKKjaxaaa	This is a common problem.  Remind him that women want to be courted.  They want to feel desired for more than just sex.|`|ygimTNzoaa	OH I envy you!! I WISH my man would want to have sex with me so much. Yes my man wants it, but rarely initiates it, which is weird because in my last 5 year relationship, my X was the only one who initiated sex. Weird how things flip yes? My man isn't capable of having sex more then once a day, and force 2 times out if I can. Now it's more like 4-5 times a week I wish it was more like 4-5 times a day AT LEAST. I crave it, but he just doesn't have the juice for it lol. Sorry. People are just different, but I still wouldn't have my man any other way.|`|4o3jXz3Waa	I guess what's "normal" depends on the sex drive of the people involved.  My husband and I have been married for almost 14 years, and normal for us is about 3 times a week.  And I actually have the higher sex drive in my marriage, which may seem out of the norm for a woman.  Guess the typical stereotype doesn't fit in my situation.<br>  <br>  Just be glad your husband still desires you and isn't looking for some play outside your marriage.|`|K8OjmMUAaa	You're right, this is the real world, and most couples are doing good to have sex once a week. Besides, it's your body, and he does NOT have any rights to it. He has no right to be a jerk whenever he doesn't get it when he wants it, too. Maybe next time he refuses something petty that YOU want, you could act the same way, and when he asks you about it tell him "Well how do you like a taste of your own medicine?"<br>  <br>  He needs to grow up.|`|k4mGOlwsaa	sorry once a week wouldn't be good enough for me so i can see why your husband is frustrated. You should be happy he asking you and not someone else. You need to ask yourself why you don't want it more and work on it from there and talk with your husband about it cause this could potentially cause alot of issues in your marriage.<br>  me and my husband do it 5-8 times a week.|`|B12E4rYiaa	You need to have a good honest conversation on the matter so that he understands your side. If that doesn't work then meet with a counselor to give guidance before it gets worse. There are a lot of husbands that would like to get sex once a week so he's a bit unreasonable. Your feelings matter so try to work it out.|`|PHYj1UPwaa	Sounds more like an addiction to me..Or maybe he just feels tense and that is the only way to find relief...Be careful with that one..If he becomes bored with you, he will look somewhere else...Try planning a date night once a week...Good Luck...Yes, this is a real world and he should also be responding to your desires to make sure you are happy, too...|`|FtyLwqR5aa	He is very self centered. men are 90 % sexual and 10% emotional and women are 90% emotional and 10% sexual.|`|OHfZFR31aa	I also would get very agitated and difficult if I went without sex for a week or more.

As for your problem for now, it doesn't always have to be sex; try being creative by making a tape or something of that nature, of yourself getting off, and leaving it for him to watch while you are not around. This will give him motivation to satisfy himself which should decrease his attitude, as well as make the time when you are together even better; because he will want you more. <br>  <br>  **Note**<br>  2-3 times a week is not a bad thing (to have sex)...TRY IT :)|`|CF1R0TPvaa	Here is what I recommend:<br>  1.  You must tell him you only want it once a week, or whatever.<br>  2.  You MUST initiate at least some of the time.<br>  3.  You MUST go with the flow and give in to him when he initiates at least some of the time<br>  4.  You MUST let him masturbate and look at porn or whatever else he wants to do.  If you definately do not want him messing around with other women, IT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that you pleasure him in other ways, more than once a week.|`|8XptmQBXaa	I was in the same situation my wife never wanted it more than twice a week so i started working out got in great shape and still the same routine. I tried talking to her but it never changed, and I ended up cheating, over and over again. She found out and wanted to kick my ***, but we talked about it and now she knows it is a serious part of a relationship, eventually we got over it.

My husband and I are very young (married when teens) but we have kids and a hectic life full of work, school, and appointments so our sex life is nothing like it should be for someone our age.  When our sex life first started to dwindle, my husband would be the same way (frustrated/agitated).  I don't know what it is, they seem to need it more than we do.  I don't know what else to tell you.  The only way to fix it is to give it up or deal with it.  Sorry.<br>  <br>  Oh yeah I forgot, you need to allow him to relieve himself in other ways (there is nothing wrong with a little porn).

71VRvldJaa	I answered another question you asked and I'm assuming this is the same boy you are referring to.<br>  You know in your heart that this boy is not right for you!  You have a little voice inside you that is niggling away at you and it seems like you're trying your best to ignore what it's telling you, but you know you can't because what it's telling you is right.<br>  If you are adamant that you are not going to give in and you know that he is sexual, you are going to have an ongoing problem in this relationship.....there's only two possible outcomes to this......he walks because you won't have sex with him......or you give in thinking you can hang on to him by doing that!  Either way, YOU are the one who is going to end up hurt.  Actually....there is a 3rd thing that can happen!.....you can end the relationship yourself, prevent a broken heart and maintain your virginity!  Hmmmm which sounds the best?<br>  He sounds very controlling and manipulative and I'm willing to bet that if you stay with him, he will eventually wear you down.<br>  Listen to your inner voice when it niggles away at you.  It's your friend and it's there to guide you and protect you when you're heading in the  wrong direction.  Believe me, it won't steer you in the wrong direction!<br>  <br>  In truth, you really don't NEED a boyfriend at 14 years old.  It sounds like you've had some trouble with your grades in the past and if your mind is preoccupied with this kind of "crap" (and that's EXACTLY what it is), your grades will continue to slide.  Focus on school right now and have male friends who are ONLY friends.  There's lots of time for boyfriends later.  <br>  <br>  You seem like a really nice girl with good intentions and I care about what happens to you!  I want to see you grow up still proudly wearing that promise ring!|`|JhvqUvlsaa	I think you need to end it with this boy. Sorry...I know you love him but he wants you to sleep with him and you already made a decision not to until you're married. And he's flirting around (you've heard it from two people so it must be true) and you get into fights a lot. Doesn't sound like a healthy relationship. I think the next time you see him you should tell him you're breaking up wit him and when he asks why just say it's not working out or we have too many problems. He might get mad but he'll get over it. =)|`|Iqh7U5Ypaa	well, all i can say, is stay with him and just see how it goes.<br>  BUT<br>  tell him about how he should know you love him so he doesnt need to be told constantly. <br>  discuss these little things with him, it will make your relationship stronger and maybe bring you to closer. <br>  <br>  if you speak to him and he's not very happy etc, then dont be with him. <br>  <br>  and the sexual stuff..all guys are like that...trust me (:<br>  <br>  good luck. <br>  <br>  x|`|c2ec7696beba807b7e7d0738493ee859aa	Well just have some fun with him, don't let it be too serious, if hes flirting with Other girls then flirt other guys, see how he likes it :P BUT don't let it go past flirting. Good luck.

But I wouldn't be too worry about it because it's not like it's the most important thing in the world. You should just try and talk to a few girls, and if they seem a little interested in you, or if one of them catches your eye, then you should focus on her more. Even if the girl doesn't like you in the first place, she will eventually learn how to like you because girls just work that way. Kinda freaky. But it's true!|`|oPfuSTfUaa	since your the guy, id wait untill i had a car and drivers licens if you want a good  long lasting relationship, but heck go ahead if u wanna, but if you dont really want one n your just doing it cause your friends are thats dumb!|`|qSnxHinzaa	if your ready<br>  dont rush yourself you might wind up like me and notice that some people are just meant to be single.|`|hwKFm7H8aa	dont get a gf....get a girl willing to do anything...and one that you wont have to spend time with..|`|rJPHe9hvaa	why not?

That will just be a matter of a refi in your name only. <br>  You may be able to leverage that you have paid the mortgage all along. <br>  <br>  The mediation services are the 1st step and their recommendations whether he agrees or not weigh heavily if the matter cannot be resolved outside the court room. <br>  <br>  If he refuses to attend mediation that will also cause the judge to sway more in your favor. <br>  <br>  In the meantime, if he does anything to make you feel threatened call the police they will make him leave and it is very easy for you to get a restraining order after that - his name on the house won't matter he will not be legally allowed to enter it or harass you. <br>  <br>  Know your rights, do the foot work don't let this guy bully you.  <br>  <br>  His plan to ruin your credit is laughable. Unless you just sit back and let him call the shots. Do not move out of that house, at this stage possession is 9/10 of the law. And will be until there is a court order in place. <br>  <br>  <br>  Call the bank as well even they in order to protect their own best interest may even be willing to go the extra mile to help you.|`|g6pqGjrkaa	if the loan is on both side names  both has to clear the loan before selling it.

That is the problem. You have two choices, either amicably reach a solution, or go to court. If you were married, the most common court ordered solution is to sell the property and divide the proceeds after the debt is paid. With that in mind, you might try professional mediation before you go to court. Talk to the mortgage company about whether you can waive your rights and transfer it to his name only to avoid a credit rating problem.

Give him plenty of time and space and continue to do things together and in time he will come to accept him as a new person in his life, and as you say, in a few years he will be off to college anyway.|`|1hciyvKdaa	Your son is not use to sharing you, so imagine its now him losing time with you. Even though at that age they start getting independant, he may see soemthing in your bf  you dont and he worries about your safety.  A woman whose not dated for that long, may over look more obvious to others signs of a not so good person, because shes so lonely that any attention is more appealing than none. So give a reality check on the b/f, his relationship to you, the impact any fighting and your tears have on your son ok.Kids cant always voice their feelings so take into consideration, he may have all kinds of feelings he cant share with you. IFit was me,and my son was upset, Id not date that person, and if I had to, too lonely to not to, Id not have that person in me and my sons home, and Id date the person way less and see if it comforted my son more.  yes adults do need their own lives etc,but hes not seen you have one, so its so foriegn to him. You might want to explain that you held off dating until he was older, to spend all the time you could with him, and can he try to understand, you will date, you and girlfriends will go to the movies etc and try to understand. But look into his eyes and see if its fears about this guy or not. Dont have the bf at your home anymore.|`|AA10500537	your son has been the man of the house for all these years now someone is taking his place ,<br>  give him a chance  have special nights just with him ..<br>  hopefully he will come around|`|1235333b4f34f1147fc81bf4aef8885baa	It's normal for your son to be jealous.  It's always been just the two of you and here you are deciding that that's not enough for you.  His feelings are hurt.  In a weird way, he's feeling replaced.<br>  <br>  The truth is, only time will heal this.  If it's a bad situation and causing your son to act out or become depressed, you should seek help from a professional counselor.  In the meantime, just keep doing what you're doing because you haven't done anything wrong.<br>  <br>  It's not wrong for you to want an adult companion and life partner.  Remind your son that you'll never make him feel bad for falling in love with someone and wanting to marry her and have children of his own.  Tell him too that you understand that this is a weird stage for him and that you know it will take him some time to adjust to the new situation.<br>  <br>  UItimately, everyone will get used to eachother.  You'll eventually start to understand what everyone's new role in the faimly is.  Even though your son and your  boyfriend may never be close like a father and son is close, they will probably hammer out their own relationship in time.|`|39e9235b89c9b80c32eb4b4082db80ccaa	Your son doesn't hate your boyfriend for no reason.  It's no that simple.  For thirteen years, he was the sole object of your affection, and I'm sure that he got more attention from you, no matter how hard you try to give him that same attention now.  The fact is, he sees another male as "moving in on his territory."  Let's not forget, your son is 14, and biologically, he's becoming more aggressive.  I'm not saying your son is interested in you, of course, but he feels like your boyfriend is an invader.  He doesn't want to surrender his independence to a man who hasn't been there for thirteen years, and then suddenly find himself subject to him.<br>  <br>  I know that this is a hard situation.  My mother divorced when i was six, and remarried when I was 9.  Believe me, it's hard to accept another man.  All you can do is accept what your son gives you, and try to understand how he's feeling.  As a teenager, he will tend to be a tad unpredictable anyway, and would resent the situation, even if he was totally prepared for it.  <br>  <br>  At this point, just try to weather the storm.|`|gJlxZdL5aa	First of all your son is 14 and has been the only male in your life for the last 13 years basically his whole life.<br>  <br>  This is going to be very hard for him.

I'm not sure if there is anything you can do to make him accept this, you might just have to accept his feelings and live with it. My mom has a boyfriend of 9 years. I will always hate him, but he yells at me and my sister and stuff so I have reason. But the thing my mom is doing wrong is not accepting that we will never like her boyfriend.|`|Ot2tJXU2aa	Do you do things with just your son on a regular basis like no less than once a week? And do you talk with your son about his interest and what's going on in the world, other than topics about your relationship with your boyfriend and his attitude over it?  I find we get so caught up in finding this great person to have around our kids we forget that we once spent all of our time with our children and that they still need that one on one with us.  I bet he's just missing you and feeling like the outsider now. Refocus his way of thinking and he will forget why he doesn't like your boyfriend?|`|jlUczlQZaa	No matter how many times you tell your son you love him or reassure him it will not completely alleviate the jealousy or anger he feels towards having another person play a significant role in your life.   <br>  <br>  He simply does not want to share you, no matter what.  Fair?  No, just a child's feelings.  He needs time to adjust to the transition, time to see that you will follow-thru on your committment to ensuring he is still your number one focus and time to realize that having another adult care and love you is a positive change.<br>  <br>  He has been with you for 14 years, this new man has only been there for one, thus, your son needs time to adjust to these changes without feeling scared that his whole world is going to fall apart.  Your happier in finding someone to share your life with, however, your son would see it as "why aren't I enough" in your life?<br>  <br>  I would continue dating, with your son as your prime focus and consider marriage in a few years, after your son is away at school building his own life.  If this man is as special and committed as you say he is, he will wait and support the need to focus on yourself and your son's relationship and ensure your family life remains a positive and healthy one.  You have only been dating a short time and to make such a change and committment, you should at least keep things as they are for a few more years to ensure this is the right relationship.<br>  <br>  Make it very clear to your boyfriend that this is "your" decision.  If your boyfriend is unsupportive and resents your son for your decision, then he was never a good candidate in the first place and it's better you find that out now rather than later.|`|lA0e6vWxaa	It is going to take time for your son to realize that he is not going to lose you.  When my mom first started dating I hated her boyfriends.  I felt like they were taking her time away from me, I felt like she was putting them before me.  I think your son just don't want you to get hurt, because if you get hurt, he has to be the one to see you sad.  I experienced that with my mom.  As time went by I started to get use to her boyfriend.  He wasn't that bad after all.  So your son will come around, give him some room to accept it and it'll happen when you least expect it.|`|wLFM00iiaa	the reason it is seeming so strange is that you are not looking at it from his point of view. you have to imagine that you were in his situation. he probably is lonely without a father or a male figure and as you havent dated for so long it will be weird for him for you to have a boyfriend. the chances are that he is happy as you 2 as a family and doesnt like the idea of everything changing. he may also think that this boyfriend will be the new 'man of the house' and take you away from him. nobody likes change but change has to happen.  being a teenager i can only empathise with him as i feel sorry for him from his point of view and if i were him i would hate this guy. i think you should just not spend time with your boyfriend for 2 weeks and take your son on holiday to spend quality time and really talk about it. this may bot be the best advice but i hope you understand what he is going through.

Instead of telling her to grow up in general, tell her that you think you don't like it when she gossips or when she does ____ and ____.  Then offer her an alternative way to handle problems she has with people she doesn't like instead of gossiping about them.  It is good that you want her to be more mature in these areas.

Give it a few weeks and if she's not making any effort to change, find a girl who's on your maturity level.|`|62TvIinPaa	The only way to tell is directly... <br>  Because, in such situations the person will be living in the past and doesnt have will to change.<br>  Sit beside her, and speak to her frankly. Make sure u dont embrass her or <br>  insult her. I hope she ll understand.<br>  <br>  Best wishes,|`|BYQ2kHPjaa	When she says a comment or does something, just subtly say "thats a little immature, don't you think?". I used to have the same problem with my friend, and I just said this and she stopped doing it and grew up. Good luck xx|`|nBBeISEcaa	Tell her it's time to leave the high school drama with high school and focus on college and making herself into who she really wants to be.|`|04ZBuoqWaa	Maybe you should just tell her that you are in college now and you think it's time that you are both more mature|`|q1Ty3nk6aa	Grow up.

y4SUDnpaaa	This is a very important question and you shouldn't be asking strangers to give you opinions. Why don't you try looking it up on Google or go to a library where there are law books. I hope you are more responsible in other areas of your life.|`|qpAYU8Knaa	In Oklahoma, the age of consent is 16. That means if you are an adult and have sex with her before she turns 16 (with her consent) it is considered a statutory rape no matter what your age difference is. You should wait to date her till she turns 16, otherwise you will be in a lot of trouble. I know you just want to date her and not have sex with her but you never know when you get carried away. Why take a chance?|`|yd2SP7d6aa	There is nothing wrong with the two ages dating (that could be a Senior in High School dating a Sophmore / Junior).  The issue you need to be aware of is having intercourse "sex".  Under the age of 16 she is incapable of "consenting" and if you are an adult (18) you will go too jail (between 1 - 15 years) for statuatory rape - second degree rape (this is also regardless of parental permission).  <br>  <br>  If she was 14 & younger and you are 18+ it is rape in the first degree and at one time the penalty allowed up to even death (this isn't the case for you).<br>  <br>  Unlike some other states, once she reach's 16 she is old enough to consent to have sex with anyone she wants (adult or not) though there are specific laws the outlaw teacher / student relationships.|`|DTZmqnCkaa	RUN RUN and keep running.  Whatever is going through your mind..STOP it now.  It doesn't matter how much you think you love each other or how old she looks or acts or if it's her begging for sex.  If she or her parents or the law find out about it and can prove it, they will put you away for a long long time.  There was a case recently very similar to yours and the girls parents turned him in he was sentenced to 125 years in prison. NO NO NO!  You must MUST wait until that child is 18 years old.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	All sorts of problems when you convince her to have unprotected sex with you and she ends up pregnant...<br>  <br>  Go find someone your own age to date.  She's too young...<br>  <br>  If it were me - I'd take you out back and whoop your a$s myself.  I know what you are up to and it has nothing to do with her brain...|`|y43tzOQlaa	She's young, but you need to know if her parents are okay with it, then if it goes forward, have protected sex. Wrap the rascal!!!!|`|1Y0yPiSvaa	It will not bring you problems as long as you respect her. Both of you are still children. Enjoy that as long as possible.
KFUsmwItaa	Well I don't know how to help you honestly. He's taken, there is one very important thing that I would need to know before I can actually offer help if he considers himself her boyfriend well then I think your gonna just have to try to move on. But if not there is a possibility that he considers his online life and his physical life separate. In this case they a bf a gf online but in real life he would be open for another relationship. Best of luck to you.|`|JizwgEiYaa	Wow, obviously he is not looking for something serious, because he doesn't have a good hold on reality. If you are sure this is not some long lost cousin of his in Japan, then find someone new.|`|cPPB3B4gaa	there's nothing u can do, love...
KOwzDLPdaa	Thats a wonderful idea! My husband and I both go away a lot and it was certainly appreciated when I did it for him.<br>  <br>  Explain to the photographer how you see the photos in your mind, in that classy way (heels and his shirt is a great one) and the photographer will help you get the rest figured out.<br>  <br>  best of luck and you go girl!|`|Bg0ZGNY7aa	woow i wish my girlfriend was like you damn.<br>  well a bottom down shirt is hot no high heels um maybe sightly bed head you know or a jersey for his fav football team and just as sexy as possible and next time he's home bamn you get the piont.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  good luck.|`|X5aMV1Pmaa	I think what he'd really like is a hot meal to come home to, perhaps his favorite dish.  If you want to get the hanky panky on later, that's fine too.|`|u7f0QB37aa	That sounds like a great idea but don't know if that will be enough to keep hs hands off the hot flight attendants|`|874EAxkfaa	your are the best kind of wife!
nUq4A3Xcaa	Being 13 explains some of this, but first I had to go to the urban dictionary to figure out what chav was/meant.   If you don't like chavs then don't associate yourself with such people and don't turn into one yourself.  At the same time don't judge them because you too may have imperfections to them and live a life that they dislike as well.  Surround yourself with others like yourself.|`|LHnVjJqsaa	wtf is chav????  skanky???  you are so young preoccupy yourself with a rubix cube or something and chill the eff out!
NQ48X0rraa	Dude the exact same thing happened with my ex. Girls like this are a real pain in the ***. What if later when you with her, she meets some other guy and then wants to chose again, she's not loyal and my ex wasn't too. They just wanna have the cake and eat it to. You will regret it later, its tough, move on
q3cbuc3Eaa	means that they don't hate you|`|eS9nPWqBaa	it means he still respects you....stop reading into it more than it is.
8FbOtXAXaa	I think that losing either one would hurt a great deal. If you lost your parents it would be sad because you grew up with them and they taught you everything you know. And if you lost a child it would be just as devastating if not more because you are raising that child and you expect to go before they do and it just seems like such a huge loss when a child dies because they are supposed to live a full life and when it is taken away from them its hard to understand why.|`|IQ50BJ0Waa	Fortunately, I haven't experienced either but I would think losing a child would be harder. Parents are older and are expected to die before us. We spend a good portion of our adult lives preparing for it. Children on the other hand are the exact opposite - they are suppose to die AFTER us so when it doesn't work out that way, it blindsides us with grief.|`|AueAwhQeaa	I have lost both. My father 3 years ago, and my 13 month old son last Sept.<br>  <br>  There is NOTHING like losing a kid. There is NO WAY to explain it, and is something that will never change. <br>  <br>  They say as a human you made to deal with everything that could come your way, but not to bury your children.|`|HhCL30uUaa	I have lost both of my parents to horrible diseases but thankfully I haven't lost either one of my children.  I would have to assume that losing one of my kids would be worse because you always expect your parents to die before you do, not that you want them to but you know you will lose them someday.  I don't think you really think that way about your kids.  I hope this makes sense, I may have gotten a little off track.|`|MU0X9zqFaa	I have lost a parent, it was devastating.  I have heard it's harder to lose a child because a parent expects to die before their own child does.
ifgzHzA3aa	A handwritten sincere card goes a long way.  If you are already up to budget, stick with what you have for each girl and just make sure that you thank them personally for the work and help they have done.|`|hkwBR1moaa	The idea of a Bridesmaid gift is to say thank you for helping me and standing up for me on my big day.  Giving some and not the others a little something extra defeats the purpose.  That's what the bracelet is for. As for the MOH.  I do agree with getting her something 'extra'.  I'm getting my MOH, who also happens to be my sister, a photo album of pictures of her and I growing up.  I'm decorating it as a scrapbook.  It's costing me hardly a thing.  So maybe something like that.|`|JrVhTyLdaa	You can get each of those who contributed more something extra if you wish. You are showing your gratitude for what they have done. Of course the maid of honor deserves more because of all she has done. You can find a great many inexpensive ideas for gifts at <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.e-weddingfavors.com/catalog/Bridesmaid_Gifts-38-1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.e-weddingfavors.com/catalog/B...</a>|`|H0vicK8Kaa	You should def get the 3 that helped MORE a lil extra something.. Like GC to spa or something.. just dont give it to them in front of the other girls to avoid making them feel bad.. and give them all the bracelets which is so cool!<br>  <br>  Dont get anything extra extra to the MOH since the 3 helped the same... get them all the same extra thing.|`|QJslTCUBaa	MOH should have something special. It could be a dinner invitation, gift card to one of her favorite places to shop, a piece of jewelry. Give to her when it's just the two of you. Best Wishes :-)|`|rpVQpJA7aa	If you are on a low budget, I think the gifts you have gotten them are just  fine. They sound really neat! I wouldn't give extra things to certain bridesmaids and not the others. That will only hurt feelings!|`|DeXRWlR6aa	Maybe just a nice card w/a note inside. To the 3 who didn't help, something along the lines of "Thank you so much for being part of our special day" but the other 3, thank them for all the help.
KSK22vHUaa	Wow, your parents are pretty inconsiderate and irresponsible.  I wouldn't be ready to talk to them either.  <br>  <br>  I would not speak to them until they apologized.  I'd be as frank and open about how I felt, explain it all to them, and then wait for them to understand.<br>  <br>  But your mom would rather give your birthday cupcakes to strangers and lie about where you are at a funeral than consider you for a moment.  She'd rather make sure that SHE looks generous than be generous to you.  That's ridiculous.|`|QJslTCUBaa	Has your mother always treated you this way? Honey, your mother has a problem, not you. She is very cold and disrespectful towards you. Don't be her doormat. Do what makes you happy and stop trying to please her. Good Luck. :-)|`|2eHFbEstaa	tell them that they pissed you off an hurted your feelings.if i were you i wouldnt go to town with her .let her know why .|`|rJPBF33taa	Never hold a grudge...tell your parents how you feel...but then let it go.<br>  GOOD LUCK!|`|e8bRcVNAaa	I'm really sorry what's happening to you. I don't have a good relationship with my parents either. Our relationship is so bad I've even thought about suicide. Hopefully, your relationship is not as bad or worse then mine. Happy 21st birthday by the way.|`|Ql0gi4rVaa	your parents are way out of line on this one<br>  you need to separate yourself and become your own person<br>  <br>  they have already done so with you|`|x80SgAlPaa	My mother is very similar. My life has never been a priority to her and pretty much that is the gist of it. While their life shouldn't revolve around you; you should make it clear to them that if they want to be involved in your life actively (going to the mall, etc.) then they need to learn to respect you and your time. Emphasize that just because it is not a big deal to them that it is to you - they dont have to understand it to accept it.|`|bb06GQ5Paa	Why don't you use this opportunity to talk to your mom and tell her how your feelings were hurt by those two incidents?|`|1hciyvKdaa	Wow, Id stop doing anything with mom long enough for her to contact you and ask whats up, let her feel left out for once. Do they drink alot? That could be the problem?? Id move on with my life, and let them seek you out. How mean and unloving to do to you. Its ok hun, parents as friends can be fools, they definately need a reality check. Let them worry for awhile and stay with the new pup and have some fun, you need it ok!!!  Id put off accepting any invites for now, if you dont think mom with use it to take time to appologize and shes going to simply forget about it, dont go with her places and let her wonder why, just make up excuses, my pup needs me home, or I have plans.
sXnoIFRsaa	This chick is TROUBLE and you know it.  Leave her alone and stay away.  Says so much about someone who would go back with a dude that hits her.  Grow up and stop being the knight in shining army.  She needs a shrink not a BF
0IsSBOgkaa	Fells like your chest is going to explode if you are not together with her. When you are together you become a totally silly and incredible happy and horny too.<br>  You call just to hear her voice. Others girls dont exists anymore!<br>  you just see her in your eyes and feels her in your heart all the time.<br>  Its amazing when you are together..<br>  The hard thing is when just you love her. Because heart pain is the most hard pain ever.<br>  good luck!|`|JjwQMN3laa	You'll know it when it comes. It's different for everyone.|`|mJo35PwXaa	painfull do ur best 2 keep ur heart 2 urself!|`|bNllesmMaa	I remember the feeling well, the first day of me realising I was in love.  It was a sunny day, which is strange as it was winter.  I remember walking out of my house, feeling whole for the very first time.  The pessimist me had gone, and I felt positive.  No matter what issues I had at that time, I felt as though I could over come them instantly.<br>  I almost felt as though I had a cold, because it was like I was in a shell.  It was a very odd feeling, and one I think everyone should feel sometime in there life.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately it didn't last, and falling out of love is a lot harder.  As they say, it takes 1 second to say hello, and a lifetime to say goodbye.|`|OyWVqe23aa	real love is putting your d*ck in the girl. yay
RC8Pxx8eaa	Heh heh heh, we do pretty much anything we want....between two people that love each other there are no boundaries.|`|71VRvldJaa	This world is crazy enough without bringing bondage sex into our bedroom!  No I haven't ever had it nor would I!  I think  it would take away from the intimacy and passion and those are what has always been important to me.....not control and domination.|`|Oz5F8Alfaa	no i never have.  But i'm pretty sure if you dress up and initiated your husband will love it a lot.  It is always good to do what you have in mind about sex.|`|4EWCegiRaa	He'll be worred about thin walls and stuff like that until he sees you wearing leather asking to be spanked.... just for it, he'd be crazy to say no.|`|395c377076280782e3d71dbcfe6ad589aa	Not yet....still looking for leather.
YFXusnT1aa	Don't say anything, he won't know how to react. Sometimes even your girlfriend will get asked out by a guy, as long as you don' care its no big deal.|`|uFmrZbCbaa	Jealous no mad yes. If I was seeing a girl and she took another guys phone number she would be doing the two timing boogie away from me. What is it with people you do things to the one your with yet if the roles were reversed and he got another girls number he would be hung out to dry. To make this simple if it doesn't feel right chances are its not.|`|T4N6a7MQaa	You owe him no explanation. In fact saying nothing would most likely be for the best. He's not going to like it and acting cool would be saying he's not that interested anyway.|`|ky82orBzaa	why would you take the number if you like the other guy no don't tell him|`|sIareS2Vaa	I'm the kind of guy who doesn't let things bother me, but this would get at me a little bit. Guys, just like girls, don't like to think about their gf or bf interested in someone else. It makes them feel like they aren't good enough. So yes, he will probably be at least a little jealous. If he isn't, then he probably isn't taking the relationship too seriously (whether thats good or bad, you decide).<br>  <br>  I wouldn't tell him, but if you want to see the other guy, don't try to hide it from your current boyfriend. That will definitely lead to some problems.|`|kxAMOZAuaa	He doesnt need to know .. Especially if you arent going to call the guy.|`|9Y4vvEaFaa	yes so hurry up and tell him before it goes bad|`|2esGKO2Caa	Jeez do yourself a favor and your boyfriend just go do what you need to do. You're right you don't have a relationship. Leave your boyfriend and you need to stay out of relationships and do whatever and when you do find someone you really like. And he asks you this same question then you'll know what i'm suggesting it's not about jealously.|`|64b71311b453645560ceb49d58250d08aa	why would you take his number if you weren't interested in calling him? if you want to be exclusive talk to him about it. if not, then call the dude and hook up with him if you want.
wXaGIPSPaa	did you go to his place and check it out? seems if he has nothing to hide you would have a key to it too.<br>  You know this man....trust your gut.<br>  can you trust him? will you be forever checking his phone etc? is that how you want to have a relationship?<br>  can you fully connect with him sexually?  Or do you hold back a little to protect your heart? Do you lay there fighting memories of him lieing and hurting you?<br>  can he change? past predicts future.<br>  Can love conquer this? at what cost?<br>  the turth is within you and only you.<br>  Find peace.  You know where to look.<br>  take care.|`|KzmTLOQHaa	I have been following your stories and I will tell you right now that I am on your side 100%! You have been trying for awhile now. Seems like there is no progress! The more you try the more he messes up. Its like he doesnt even want to try to change! The people that says "dont change for anyone" is full of ****. We all have flaws. And if I am doing something that my husband doesnt like (going out partying too much for example. which I dont do by the way) or he does something that I dont like (holding his feelings in and pulling away) then he or I will try to work on it to make the other person happy. Thats what it is all about in the end. Making eachother happy. BUT it has to be 50/50.<br>  So ask him what he thinks you could work on. And if he says something like complaining to much then tell him that you will try to work on it. (we already know his faults. lol) That way it doesnt like like you are nagging him. And he thinks hes not the only one that has faults. Know what I mean?<br>  That being said. Maybe he did sleep in late and was ignoring your phone calls because he didnt want to hear you complain. Hey I am trying to give him the benefet of the doubt at this point. lol<br>  My husband always says that he HATES argueing. as do most people. But guys really dont like any kind of conflict. And I bet he knew you were going to be upset for him not showing at 11:00 (I would have been for sure) so he was just trying to avoid the problem.|`|PHYj1UPwaa	I was married almost 20 years and when my husband started trreating me abusive, hitting me, threatning me, calling me awful names..I decided for a seperation....The seperation was to give us basically a time-out..I was hoping he would return to his senses and I would be going back home...He must have thought it gave hime a right to his freedom...I kept telling him, I wanted to come back home..he told me how much he loved me and needed me and I thought we were on the right track..until I caught him with his girlfriend ..He was having sex with her and had another girlfriend in another city, here in Florida while married to me...He was supposidly dedicated to our church..A very fine christian man, I might add...Our marriage ended in divorce 4 months later, when he refused to leave the girlfriend and come home..If you have a gut feeling...women know..we just know when something is not right...I would pro have a close friend follow him or hire a short term private investigation service...Good Luck...Watch your assests and protect yourself..If they will lie about one thing..they will lie about many things..Protect yourself...|`|y4SUDnpaaa	You're right his story makes no sense. If there was a reason he wasn't ashamed or trying to hide something he would have told you the truth. If he had not cheated already maybe you could let this go, but the best predictor of future behavior is past behavior. Forget about why he lied, just trust your gut that he did lie. If counseling didn't work and you still can't trust you there's really nothing solid to build a marriage on.|`|zMg4hQwDaa	you have low self esteem, never call him or chase him again. he obviously treats you like sh** because he knows you allow him to walk all over you.|`|MuVKeK8faa	Follow your gut on this one!! Start dating other people!!|`|0UUDFxR0aa	Go with your gut|`|9c16c903d98e1ee2dd93bbe04e3fc406aa	It is never a good sign when someone gets defensive about answering a question.  It usually means that they are hiding something.<br>  If he can not be honest with you, then cut your losses and move on.<br>  He obviously doesn't love you enough to be honest with you.<br>  Follow your gut and get out before he hurts you even more.|`|AA11920434	Every time I have ever had that "bad feeling" I was right. I do not know how long you have been married or anything, but have you thought about counseling? It already sounds like you do not trust him. A marriage will not work without it. If you do not get help together, at least get it for yourself to figure out why you put up with all you have and be able to make better choices for yourself in the future. Good Luck and God bless|`|JgU9vaP4aa	ur going to push him away.. is this what you want? do u have a reason to not trust him? has he liedto you in the past? is this is habbit?<br>  maybe what he said is just that? if you want to work things out then you need to give a little.......... or do u really want to work it out?<br>  if you do want to work on things then you have to give a little. he wont always follow your rules.|`|VUNfI7yBaa	Yes, fallow your gut, it is usually right. It sounds fishy to me, the whole situation. I wouldn't believe it either. If their was nothing going on he wouldn't care if you asked him 1000 questions, I think you should move on and let time heal your wounds.|`|wzqahEqiaa	It sounds like he is hiding something.  He may be dating another woman, or have a drinking, or drug problem.  I know you want your relationship to work out.  Your husband is disrespecting you and you will probably never get an honest answer.  Keep your distance from him as much as possible until your divorce is complete.  Hopefully there are no children involved.  Good Luck!
F6yfJSr9aa	Custody issues can be complicated.  I think it would be in your/friend's interest to consult with an attorney to better understand the potential issues.  It probably isn't a good idea to just post legal questions on Yahoo (trust me, I had a bad experience), when many of the members don't know what they are talking about.  With such an important issue like custody, you or your friend def. need to, at the very least contact, a lawyer, even though I know they can be expensive.  When I had a legal problem, I used www.quicklegalanswer.com for my legal stuff and was surprised how fast an attorney answered my question.  It was very cheap and helped me put my mind at ease.  Anywho, just thought it would be a good idea.  If you need anything else, let me know.
f534a428c6db5b8e865429b94a1c13c9aa	Ok, first, stop and breath. 7 years is a long time. When he says he wants you to forgive him, does this mean he wants the wedding back on? If so, then you need to figure that hurdle first. Maybe he had cold feet, maybe he was with guy friends who put all these horrible pictures in his head, figure out what was going on with him and see if he was just panicking? Get to the bottom of whether or not he cheated on you, you know him and you will know if he is lying. If you cant trust what he says it will hang over your head for the rest of your lives and you need to figure out if you can live with that. Even if he did cheat he needs to at least be honest so you can decide if it is something you can get over. <br>  <br>  Next, taking a break might be a good idea, especially if he doesn't want to go through with the wedding. You have been in this for 7 years and he should know if this is a commitment he wants to make for life. If he claims he doesn't know then you need to get out of there with your child and tell him to let you know when he figures it out. You shouldn't wait around for him or anyone. If you leave there is a good chance he will come crawling back but there is also the chance he doesn't and you need to be ready for that. If he doesn't then it wasn't meant to be and at least you can get on with your life. Good luck.

Tell him you dont even know how YOU are going to feel 5 or 10 years down the line in marrage but you are willing to give everything you have to make your marriage work and he should do the same.<br>  Men have ego's the size of planet mars and anyone that boosts it for them gets their attention, he messed up and flirted and I dont think for one minute he cheated so get on with your wedding plans and let him know you wont tolerate anymore misbehaving.<br>  He sounds like a kid.|`|fPHjh4Jsaa	If he does not know how he feels 5-10 years down the road then I would say he does not truely love you. The unknown future is scary but if he loves you then he would of never said that. You probably want to take him back because he is all you have there, but i would strongly recommend that you think this through. Questions like why did he even say those things? Why was he not sure of the marriage and why would he cancel it after 7 years of being together|`|4459a617a0f5dd8c54421a39f39f8ed4aa	Wow. This is definitely a case where counseling will do you guys some good.<br>  <br>  If he feels this way after a week away from you, what's to say it won't happen again when you're married.<br>  You two need to sit down and seriously discuss this relationship with a pastor or counselor. Since you have a son, it makes things complicated.<br>  <br>  Postpone your wedding, for now. I know it may be hard, but he obviously showed cold feet.|`|q8eue7CRaa	It is much better to put the wedding on hold then go through the horrible stress of divorce. Be glad he was honest with you. As awful as you feel now, you would feel much worse if he told you this a) the day before the wedding or b) during the honeymoon or c) just lied to you and ended up having an affair to not mess up wedding plans.|`|uKFgRHeqaa	I would take a break from him. Because if he felt that way suddenly it may be true and you do not want to get hurt in the long run. Because if he is just lying to you (maybe because that other girl turned him down) then what happenes if another gilr comes along, but your already married? and if he is sorry he will understand why you want a break.|`|1Ayb4UK7aa	If this is the second time you have tried to plan a wedding, I would break it off completely.  He is making excuses because he is too scared to make a commitment.  If he was serious about getting married, he should know how he would feel in 5-10 years.  Have some self respect and dump this guy.|`|3c51ba3982b4a0fa984f838020963690aa	Take a break.  Put off the wedding, neither of you are ready.  You do already have a son, and sounds like neither of you are behaving properly for your son's benefit, that's unfortunate.  You need to think what's best for your son.  The less drama, the better, to put it simply.<br>  Take your son and go stay with family or a friend somewhere, and do not see your bf/fiance for at least 3 weeks.  Don't talk to him regularly, give it real space, unless it's your son who wants to talk with him.|`|7G4hisdzaa	Wow.  <br>  First off, you do not have nothing.  You have your son.  You have family and friends you can call and talk to.  And you do have an option of moving home.<br>  From what you have told us, I am chalking it up to commitment issues.  Sometimes you have to push past what your heart is telling you and listen to your head.  He does not sound worthy of you or your love.  <br>  Absolutely I would not marry him.  Not right now.  And if this is your second bang at planning a wedding, well....that kinda speaks for itself now, doesn't it?  How many times are you going to let him do this to you?<br>  All in all it comes down to who you love more--him, or YOU?|`|d463fe7e1693b502adb816944612a0e8aa	Let me put it in a different perspective for you: I'll offer you a comfortable fully furnished & maintained home, complete with loving 'spouse & child' at your disposal 24/7, leaving you reassured and respected but still independent to 'dabble on the market' all with no binding strings attached.<br>  <br>  Yes it's tough on a relationship to be separated for long periods of time.  <br>  However, it is time to hand his argument back him once and for all...Life doesn't come with guarantees and who knows what 10 or 15 years will bring but it's either right enough for ME that I would marry now. If not, it will never be and it's time we make a permanent break.
YFXusnT1aa	Finding excuses to talk to you, gets flustered when he speaks to you. Finds a reason to invite you out a lot.|`|lPNP9bt2aa	he ask you out|`|4v2jcOsiaa	He'll try spending alot of time with you.
IQ50BJ0Waa	I promise to take care of you when you are being a total baby when you're sick. I promise to always sort out the red socks from the white loads.

I promise you my  deepest love, and fullest devotion. I promise to stay by your side, and to wipe away your tears with my laughter, I promise to encourage you and inspire you, I promise to love you when times are good and when times are bad, when our love is simple and when it is an effort, these things I give to you today and all the days of our life.  From this day forward I will live, laugh, love, and grow old with you!|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	We had a whole custom set of vows written for us, so we didn't use traditional anything. I don't have a gripe with traditional vows, as long as it's a secular version - we're non-religious. I have to say, I've never given much thought to the vows themselves, a friend of mine (a professional writer) wrote them for us, and it worked out great.

But acquire some yellow police tape and tape off the area, put a chalk outline of the glasses if you don't want to actually leave them on the floor.<br>  <br>  Don't say anything about it.

"Some MFers just insist on ice skating uphill."<br>  <br>  First you need to realize that you cannot MAKE another person do, think or feel any particular way.  If he insists on not taking proper care of his sunglasses and the dog gets to them again, it will be his loss and his fault.  <br>  <br>  Sometimes you just have to let people learn their lessons the hard way if that's what they insist on doing.<br>  <br>  If that happens again, I probably wouldn't buy him another pair.|`|2l7lbcJWaa	you have told him enough times that he should have it engraved in his head by now. So if I were you, I wouldn't waste one more second telling him. If he leaves them out and the dog chews them up, well, you told him so. He should have listened and maybe the next time he will. I wouldn't buy him anymore sunglasses either if he's not going to take care of them.|`|Vbdfphhbaa	is there a specific place where he can put his glasses? like a drawer etc? having a handy place like a box on top of counter,a drawer that is just his can help. specially if its on eye level. a bit bright so he wont miss it, and most of all masculine,nothing flowery or girly. dark woods and simple patterns help. woven is nice laso. also a front door table just for him to drop his things will keep all in order. mentioning this places where he can put his glasses without being bossy will help a lot.|`|AA11602080	Yeah, don't replace the glasses.  Dogs are dogs and don't know the difference between toys and sunglasses.  If he is that irresponsible then "oh well" for him.  Too bad, so sad.<br>  <br>  You might want to try talking to his @$$hole because that is where men's brains and ears are located.|`|AA10681117	Those are his choices to make and his consequences to accept. The more wrapped up in it you get, the less happy you'll be. Take care of your stuff and let him take care (or not take care) of his.|`|BKr3y30maa	Tell him everytime you have to spend $200 on sunglasses to replace the pair from before, you are going to spend that much on yourself.|`|N8kxg8wgaa	Hide the expensive ones and tell him the dog ate them.

Simple as that.|`|W1rCsvTzaa	You just gave me a flashback.  I wear the glasses without frames.  Photogray lenses, high refract.  Almost $400/pair - my dog chewed them to pieces 3 years ago.  I am still not as careful as I should be with them.  I am just really absent minded, it is just the way I am.  I wish I could change.  Ugh...|`|8TmK8Qklaa	I found it interesting that you referred to the dog as "my dog" so he doesn't like the dog or what? I would stop buying him replacement sunglasses, it's as simple as that.<br>  <br>  If he wants to act irresponsibly then he needs to go without until he learns to be responsible. There is  no age limit on this principle being taught. Your place is not to do anything at all, except train your dog to stop chewing or put it outside.<br>  What if it was something of yours the dog chewed up, would you be so gracious about it?|`|ucVgUcDvaa	Take the glasses away and hide them. Act like you have no idea what happened to them and then blame the dog. Make him think that the took them for a little while. Don't give in until he is sure the dog ate them and he was a idiot to leave them out. Then pop them out and say "You almost lost these. You are being irresponsible. Start putting these where they belong every day"<br>  It worked for my kids!|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	Hide them, and tell him you don't know where they are.<br>  Stop trying to mother him, and make him face the consequences of his irresponsible behavior. When you constantly fix things, he can't learn a lesson.<br>  Honestly, I would not have bought the second pair for him.|`|VUNfI7yBaa	let the dog eat them again if he leaves them sitting around. And never buy expensive sun glasses again for this reason alone|`|pRF5LLloaa	Stuff like this -- it is probably not possible.  Your husband LOVES his shades, but he doesn't VALUE them enough to take care of them, and protect them from the dog.  If, in the future, the dog finds then -- do NOT buy him another pair.  That would be wasteful of money.  let him buy his own, and MAYBE he'll learn some sense of value.<br>  <br>  If this is ALL he does wrong, just ignore it, and pick them up after him.  It is better for you to do that and protect his AND the dog, than to let him fend for himself and suffer his anger at both you and the dog.|`|AA11596133	CHANGE whatever way you are talking to him right now.  Obviously what you are doing is not working, so change it! <br>  <br>  I found that doing things like leaving notes that have XOXO on them, or drawing silly things like hearts on the notes, or even pictures of "before" and "after" really work.  I took pictures of my daughters room of before and after I had cleaned them, printed them, then posted them on her bedroom door.  Without a word, she now keeps her room MUCH more in order. I know it drives you crazy to have to repeat yourself, but it is just something we have to do.  I also know, that the more you speak out of anger and frustration, the less likely they are to WANT to listen to you.|`|AA12029875	don't give them back and don't buy him another pair.  When he asks if you have seen them say no. And ask him when he had them on last. You don't help him look for them, but you can be a little peeved at him because they were the 2nd pair.  IF/When you think he has learned to listen to you, they can always turn up under the back seat of his car.|`|y4SUDnpaaa	If this is the second time this has happened and you've warned him several times then I would say it's no one's fault but his own.  I wouldn't say I told you so or anything else. When he sees the glasses and asks what happened just calmly say the dog chewed them up I guess you'll have to buy another pair.  Just don't let him take it out on the dog.|`|koXcq0l1aa	yeah, buy a knockoff of the pair of sunglasses that you're talking about and let the dog chew on them.  Hide the real deal.  When your husband sees the knockoff's chewed, he'll be regretting that he left the glasses laying around.  Then give him the original pair and say, "See what I mean."  Guaranteed he'll take better care.|`|eoQoCcz5aa	One would suggest you super glue the places  on the glasses where they rest on the face ,  for instance the nose and ears , when he puts them on they will be forever  stuck to his head  , so no need then to worry about him if he misplaces them . <br>        One hopes this has been of some use , kindest regards , cheerio .|`|2ikZxzBfaa	Yell and scream @ him.......oh yeah don't have sex with <br>  him until hes ready to listen lol! that's what my girlfriend does<br>  and it works every time.|`|IvMPh09baa	sometimes guys are just bad listeners... try writing it in a note to him

kGBli717aa	Wait until he wants to have another one on one, then let him have it. If he knows that you are on to him it will make it less likely that he'll try that again as far as in your church setting. Hopefully it will also give him food for thought and he will stop acting like a slimy jerk.
fr1jbLA3aa	Us chicos are estupidos half the time see, we are thinking about you muchachas very often anfd trreating us a s a friend is a bit of a rejection, so we just very moody and grouchy like big babies. All I can say is this guy likes you and the behavior won't stop, if you go out wih him then he'll just get bored so, I'd just confront him about it, hopefully he'll shape up.|`|KIsrFf0Faa	Simple. Based on my experience, when a guy acts out of character when you just see him as a friend, it's probable and most likely that he likes you. The sole fact that he acts sweet when you show him that you like him, indicates that he likes you. But, I'd be careful though. Since he acts weird when you show that you don't like him, it could be that he can eventually hurt you in a physical way. I mean,if  just to make him be nice to you you have to act like you like him, that's strange don't you think?|`|XT81GCu1aa	This guy shouldn't be "angry" with you, you can't help your feelings.  However, he can't help his feelings either so realize that it is also his choice to not be "just friends" with you.   If he can't handle that, it is perfectly understandable.  Give it some time.|`|zFhQJtt9aa	because he likes you and he does not want to put in the effort if he gets nothing in return.|`|K4VZtIr3aa	Platonic friendships with hot girls never work...they just drive us men insane.|`|b6d207b7421df3840cc19062f2df25deaa	My God!

Holy crap!|`|3c51ba3982b4a0fa984f838020963690aa	Because most guys won't bother being your "friend" unless they had some interest in you for more than friends, whether they act on it or not -- and to boost their egos, they want to think that you're interested in them as more than friends.  So when you come out and set it straight, they get hurt and their egos are bruised.  Oh well, they do it to us, too though.  That's how things just are.|`|yyIVrngcaa	guys don't want to be friend unless they get something out of it , (most of the times sex) a guy will only talk to a good looking girl because they want to eventually have her. so, yea....sorry but it's the truth. forget that guy.|`|AFn1wlzcaa	he wants to be more than friends and thats why he acts the way he does when you treat him as a friend but when you treat him differently he talks to you casue he thinks he has a chance of gettting with you.|`|v96pYAg1aa	Reason y becuz the guy might actually like u and it always hurts when the girl says that I only want to be ur friend
O8TA4tMGaa	Elena,<br>  <br>  Never do anything because you're looking to gain the approval of anyone else, whether that's the approval of your family or the approval of your boyfriend.  Why?  Because any time you make a life decision because you're trying to gain the approval of someone else (especially family) what you're really saying to that person (or those people) is this: <br>  "What you think of me is more important than what I think of myself."<br>  <br>  Never give anyone that kind of power over you.  The most important opinion in the world is the one you have of yourself.  This boyfriend may come and go.  Your family may like you today and hate you tomorrow.  You can't control what other people do but you can control what you think of yourself and how you treat yourself.<br>  <br>  Are you enjoying this new relationship?  If yes, then continue to enjoy it for as long as it lasts.  Would you like a better relationship with your family?  If yes, give them love without expecting it in return.  However, remember, we teach people how to treat us.  If your family treats you like crap and you continue to be around them, seeking and begging for their love, guess what you're teaching them?  You're teaching them that they can treat you this way or that and you'll still be running after their affection.<br>  <br>  Love yourself and do what's right for you.  Trust your own inner wisdom (you know if this guy is right for you or not at this moment in time) and live your life.  Every relationship is an opportunity to learn, grow and heal.  See this relationship that way.  Its success is the fact that you two are learning from each other right now.  Success is not an issue of whether this lasts but whether we're learning and growing together in the process.<br>  <br>  Do what's best for you.|`|1235333b4f34f1147fc81bf4aef8885baa	How old are you exactly?<br>  <br>  If you're over the age of say, 25, five years is not a big difference.  If you're much younger than that, five years is too much of an age gap.<br>  <br>  Even though your boyfriend may be a nice guy, your family suspects that he's dating someone so much younger because he wants to manipulate you.  Maybe it's true and maybe it's not, the bottom line is, your parents are probably right to be suspicious of someone so much older dating someone so much younger.<br>  <br>  If you are below the age of 18 and he is over, having a sexual relationship is illegal (even if you're 17 and 22).  Your parents could make a lot of trouble for both of you by reporting this to the police.  It's a crime, called statutory rape and your boyfriend could go to jail and have to register as a sex offender.<br>  <br>  You are probably wise to leave your boyfriend at this point.  It will save both of you trouble in the long run.  If it's meant to be, you will be able to hook up later on in life when you're both of age.  If you're still interested in him then, your parents will probably not object.|`|P5RkJk5eaa	her something to think about do you love him answers yes would you do any thing for him if answers yes and do you see yourself with him 4ever if yes then do what your heart tells you and do worry about that because your family is going to be there any way you look at even when time get hard. and no your smart about it just how your heart feels.<br>  k|`|De1tOxHXaa	i think you have to listen to your parents thought as they are the well wisher of you and don't ever try to go against your parents|`|WDs4fRoxaa	You should weigh the pros and cons of the situation.<br>  <br>  Your boyfriend is going to side with you, love you, and<br>  respect you because he is happy to be with someone<br>  who is five years younger.<br>  <br>  Your family is threatening you and being mean to you,<br>  because they want you to understand where they are<br>  coming from.<br>  <br>  Five years is a big gap when you are a minor or just at<br>  the age of consent.<br>  <br>  They realize that this guy might have ulterior motives, and<br>  all they want to do is protect you.<br>  <br>  Listen to the things that they say and then credit or discredit<br>  their beliefs.<br>  <br>  See if their words have any real meaning before you discredit<br>  them.<br>  <br>  Best wishes|`|UDl8Ac76aa	No, I don't think you should leave your bf just to be accepted in your family. That's not worth. It's indeed hard to choose but choose the side loves you more. Since your family treats you like crap, you don't have to bother to think of their side. I am sorry, that it's kind of evil maybe, but I was the same. Hmmm...not the same problem though, but I always treated like a slave that have to obey anything, doing anything just to make them happy but there's no one even thanked me. So how can we be happy if we don't have any chance to be happy? He is your way out, if you really sure about it. One thing, blood can't be erased, whatever happens, they are still your family, so don't hesitate. Trust your heart! Good luck! ^ ^

Will she stop drinking so much so she doesn't mess up her life and put herself in those predicaments?<br>  <br>  Until she's on the same page as you and has the same standards and boundaries as you, you'll only get hurt.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|slJlLGMVaa	If it's a first time thing, then I think u should forgive her, it may have hurt knowing the she kissed someone else but she was drunk and wasn't in her right state of mind.

If she repeats the behavior or you find that she's been carrying a torch for the guy for a long time then it's better to quit the relationship and move on.|`|rPznrUnxaa	you should forgive her and see this doesn't happen again.<br>  she is loving you and don't let her with other guys.|`|Oz5F8Alfaa	no, dump her.  apparently she didn't have any respect for you.|`|Q96UcafFaa	Dump her but not just because she CHEATED on you but because you "KNEW" she was going to cheat. that means you have a lack of trust for her man. if you do decide to stay with her make stipulations. obviously her friends aren't in charge of keeping her out of trouble (they let her go home with a random guy) so tell her your not comfortable with her drinking anymore until she can be trusted again. hope the best for you man. good luck
a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	they won't feel the pain until they are the ones on the hurting end of it. they act as if they don't care about u either because they really don't, or because its their way of disconnecting from u. they may regret it later on, but u won't know unless they come back and tell u, or try to connect with u again. i believe that anyone who is on the hurting end of a divorce will hurt be it the woman or man. when a man meets someone else and leaves his wife, he really doesn't care, and that's one of the hardest things for the wife to accept. when my ex left me i was totally devastated, he just cut me out out of his life after 10 yrs. the hardest thing i had to endure was that he really didn't care about what happened to me. he isn't the one in pain, and he already has a new life, and he is happy for now and he really could care less. i think after awhile they will regret it, especially when the honeymoon phase ends, and reality sets in. but its always too late by then.|`|D3hYbsVJaa	This sounds horrendously personal.

You are talking about your own case and I can see that your hurt is very real and very deep.

I was married 16 years and with him for a total of 21 years. he was my 1st sexual encounter and i was his first but like you he moved on we are not yet divorced i filed and sometimes i hate this but then the way he treated the kids and i at the last i think it for the best. I DID see a cousler about him and talked she told me i didnt love him for like 2 years i am in love with what we had in the passed and i need to work on that he was a habit for me and i need to move on and block out the pass and look towords the future but its hard cause i do compare men to him cause when our marriage was good he was great and treated me great but we women takes a long time for us to move on that is all we have feelings that just dont go away and yes i loved cooking for him and taking care of him but i know now its time to move on it hurts but we are women and we are very strong. We are stronger than we think good luck hope this helps. if you need someone to talk to my email is hill.leeann@yahoo.com

You don't want to move halfway across the world and have to make new friends in an all new culture.  You like knowing how to do things and you like your friends.

teDI6RQ8aa	A dog that would bite my family, something is wrong.  Perhaps he had neurological problems.<br>  <br>  Do you need counseling?  This is the umpteenth time you asked about this.  This happend 13 years ago.  Get over it.|`|bb06GQ5Paa	It wasn't your fault.  It was your parent's fault for not training him properly in the first place.  All dogs, regardless of size and breed, must be trained in the beginning and during their lives.  The first time he growled at your mom, your mom should have asserted herself then.  When she just backed away, that reinforced the dog's bad behavior.  Too many people get animals and expect them to be well behaved with no work on their part.  Sounds like that's what happened here.|`|ad9efc98eb0fbeeae6b6c4abfd63046caa	he was protecting you and it wasn't your fault he got given up|`|9dqG2ZSRaa	i feel bad for you my dog got ran over last night|`|1235333b4f34f1147fc81bf4aef8885baa	Your dog was doing what comes naturally to dogs: protecting their owners.<br>  <br>  It's not your fault that he did that.  It's just nature.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, your dog sounds more aggressive than most.  His inability to make good judgments between what constituted a danger to you and what didn't was off, so he became a danger in and of himself.<br>  <br>  It's unlikely that they were trying to protect a new baby.  Dogs are usually very protective around babies.  Your dog probably would have been equally, if not more protective, or your younger sibling than he was of you.<br>  <br>  Your parents probably just decided that his aggression issues were too much for them to handle.  Even though he was a good dog, just doing what nature told him to do, he had bad judgment and if he had gotten the chance to fully unleash on someone he could have really hurt them.<br>  <br>  Three episodes of unprovoked aggression from an adult dog is a serious problem.  Don't feel like it's your fault and don't blame your parents either.  It was just a sad, unavoidable situation.|`|Tyi6rEtcaa	Ahhh, the guilt-ridden blame game....I used to play it so well.  If your actions DIRECTLY caused the dog to become vicious, then it was your fault....not what I hear from you.  Dogs will be protective of those they love, and if your cousins tormented the dog, he was within his rights to go after them for it, IMO...If someone dared mess with any of  my dogs, I'd let the dog loose, see if they still wanted to play that BS.<br>  If you weren't provoking the dog into bad reactions knowingly, or purposefully, it is NOT your fault they gave him away. <br>  Grieve his loss without the guilt, it'll be better for you in the long run, and more fair to yourself, too.<br>  PEACE|`|d0707fcbfeb406dfcf46da9dd0bafb4daa	It is not your fault, your dog was defending you for what he perceived as aggression towards you. His history guarantees that he will have bad memories, you can teach a dog good things, but bad experiences also leave an imprint.<br>  Poorly trained dogs are in a constant state of excitement and have no way of controlling it themselves without any guidance. That is were owners come in. As a young child you depend on your parents, and going by the sound of it your parents had poor anger management skills, which set the dog off.<br>  It is not your fault that in stead of getting a dog trainer involved, who could have actually trained them a bit, they chose the easy way out and got rid of your dog.<br>  It is not because you were a kid, you have to be yelled at all the time.<br>  There are other ways of disciplining and correcting a child, as you know.<br>  After all these years, let go of these things, draw your own lessons from them and move on: You now know what is right and wrong: dogs do get ill, that is the painful part of having animals, that is the course of nature. Hang in there and I hope your dog gets better.<br>  And by the way: it is not your fault!

It sounds more like he wants this time to see what else is out there after the separation/divorce...and if he can't find something better, he will be back.  Either stay married and work on it, or go your own ways....I think he has the itch and wants someone else to try scratching it for a while....

I would tell him that you are interested in working on your marriage now, but no way are you going to work on your marriage after you divorce and suffer the embarrassment of re-marrying your ex husband.  Turn the tables, my dear.  Counseling now or never.  What the hell is he thinking?  Don't consider the "opinions" of his friends, they don't know what is in his head.  It will give you false hope.  Do NOT agree to his immature demands.  Don't do this!|`|7IVEMAg8aa	I think it is a crock. If he truly wants to be with you, then you can work on your marriage without getting a divorce or separation. It sounds like to me that he wants to play the 'field' and keep a safety net with you. If he doesn't want to work on the marriage without getting a divorce or separation, then the best thing for you is to divorce him and find someone else who will love you.|`|KAoNgzcFaa	Sounds like he has some other chick on the line and just wants to keep you on the string in case it don't work out or he changes his mind so my advice would be if you go along with him on this is to get out and date other men you never know you might find some man who suites you better.<br>  <br>  Edit not being rude but when you ask a question you don't decide what the answers you get will be it's just the opinion of the answerer <br>  <br>  EDIT again  You both agreed not to date well i hope you have eyes in the back of your head because this whole scenario your husband has layed out sounds very fishy, come on you are smart enough to know you don't get a divorce to work on your marriage,,  You better think this one through.

He should make her feel loved|`|72daYczHaa	no, a guy that dosent do those things shows that he is not affectionate which is vital in a relationship or than he is too scared and maybe needs some more time until he will be ready for a proper relationship<br>  hope i helped xx|`|iYc1HLmmaa	No.<br>  <br>  Absolutely not,<br>  that would be such a waste of time.<br>  <br>  Move on, there are so many fish in the sea.|`|aZ1ZxTNvaa	ha! eww no<br>  i don't date prude people|`|pabVvxylaa	no
6b8cbbdcbfb34ad6e49d598a03f113a0aa	My wish list as a Man or for that matter any Man should be:<br>  <br>  1. CHARM - is what draws men to those women who are not as good-looking as the others in our black book. Charm is what pulls us back to women even after they burn us. Charm is the one thing that lets women get away with murder - okay, charm and the next thing on the list.<br>  <br>  2. RESPECT- The last thing a man wants is a woman who lets us down, embarrasses us and makes us out to be fools, especially in public. There is nothing wrong with admitting that men are excessively proud and sensitive to criticism, but if done right, constructive criticism from the one person who knows us best can only make us better men, fathers, lovers, brothers and human beings. <br>  <br>  3. SENSE OF HUMOUR - This will forever remain a priority for any man. We work hard, we put up with a lot, and we need a woman who will put a smile on our faces when things are gloomy, and make us laugh when things are down. <br>  <br>  4. INELLIGENCE & CONFIDENCE - Previous generations probably preferred a smart woman - not just book smart, but also street smart. But truth be told - and this will not please feminists (but then again, who cares?) - many men did not want an overly smart woman, after all, it would be too hard to tame and control her. After all, men feared that women could become unstable and make demands (oh no...). Today, men have matured a bit and now see the value in having a valuable ally as a partner. If a housewife, mother and maid is all that you are looking for, you are selling yourself short men, so go out and find someone who will learn from you as much as you will learn from her; imagine the powerhouse couple that you will make.<br>  <br>  5. HEAR OF GOLD - Most women are selfish on good days and plain malicious on bad ones, so why any man would let himself get tempted (well, we know why) by someone who has bad intentions beats me. If you are looking to get involved for the long haul, a kind woman with a heart of gold will nurture you and offer the compassion, sincerity, warmth, and affection you need to make it to the top. Just make sure you are able to reciprocate the kindness, because someone ultimately will and then she'll run for the hills.<br>  <br>  6. HONESY & TRUST - When the games are played, final rounds called and booty calls over, we want someone we can confide in. The most successful relationships are built upon trust, candor and honesty. <br>  <br>  7. LOVE - Although there are different things that make men happy - some of them may not have been on the list but should have been, while others are but should not have been - when all is said and done and the ink has dried up, the first dates turn into the honeymoon stage, and the relationship develops, all men really want is love.<br>  <br>  8. A STATUESQUE BODY – you need to pass a physical to be the best you can be and Lord knows that women make us pass their own physical exams, so why should we be any different or make any excuse about it? <br>  <br>  9. AMBITION & DRIVE - If a partner is what you seek, then you will have to find a woman who will challenge your thoughts, stir up your emotions positively and give you a run for your money. Challenges start at home and end on fields, boardrooms and life, so make sure that you meet your match, because practice does make you perfect. A woman that is too strong-willed will also be too stubborn, and this is just plain frustrating, but one that chooses her battles diplomatically will prove to come out a winner in the game of life. Would you not want her on your team?<br>  <br>  10. SHE's NAGLESS - There is nothing worse than a nag! A great girlfriend knows this and chooses her battles wisely. She knows when to speak up and when to let it slide. You don't want a girlfriend who will give you hell for leaving a couple of dishes in the sink occasionally. However, if you live together and you stay out all night without calling her, and she lets you have it, then you're setting yourself up for disaster. This is a situation that nobody would let slide - not even a great girlfriend. <br>  <br>  11. SHE GETS ALONG WELL WITH FRIENDS & FAMILY - A great girlfriend will not only help your mom in the kitchen, listen to your dad's stories and hang out with your friends, but she will enjoy it. She'll make a real effort to get to know and love the most important people in your life. And she won't try to get you to ditch your best buds. She'll actually empathize with your brother's getting dumped and suggest that you guys take him out to cheer him up. Not only that, but your friends won't roll their eyes and moan when you mention that she'll be joining you guys when she gets off work (yes, women like this do exist). <br>  <br>  12. SHE MAKES YOU WANT TO BE A BETER MAN - any man who has a great girlfriend or wife will tell you that she makes him want to be a better man. She doesn't have to say or do anything; it just is that way. <br>  Good Luck>r|`|KFUsmwItaa	Okay my dream girl wow she is a knock out. Well first of she would be shorter then me 5' 5" to 5' 7". Long silky black hair and deep brow eyes slightly tan skin. Probably 120-130lbs C cup. Next up emotional, she would be kind, caring, gentle, and understanding. Her personality she would have to be easy going and a bit spontaneous. She also has to be intelligent, and good sense of humor.|`|8OREBeRdaa	Where do I begin? In no particular order<br>  - she doesn't smoke or do drugs<br>  - social drinking is ok, such as a good martini or on occasion but no alcoholics; and doesn't drink BAD beer<br>  - she's fashionable but not trendy and knows what looks good on a girl (and on a guy for that matter),<br>  - intelligent but not necessarily genius level, it's not that I'd feel intimidated but I've dated someone like that and it tends to make them uppity.  Plus, that shows that she's willing to learn new things<br>  - be a feminist (i.e. y'know equality among the genders) just not a man-hating femi-nazi! <br>  - physically? I tend to go for dark auburm brown hair to the deepest of midnight black hair, healthy, longer (past shoulder length), either large curls or very wavy<br>  - has some ethnic background to her whether Italian, Mediterranean, Hispanic, Portugeuse, Spanish - y'know so there's that olive skin a bit<br>  - She's healthy and active but not a slave to the gym.  Likes to do group activities that are productive for experience (i.e. hiking, skating, roller blading, cycling, etc.), NO Hypochondriacs!!!<br>  - MUST have curves, but not overly so.  I'm not into skinny waifs, but I admit I'm not attracted to chunky girls (sorry, I'm being honest here)  Salma Hayek or Monica Belluci have the look I like.<br>  - well spoken, knows how to write and spell. (sounds silly but trust me on this one)<br>  - she knows how to dress elegantly and comport herself as a lady when she needs to, but she can also be the life of the party when the occasion warrants it.<br>  - patient, understanding, tries to communicate and compromise, non-judgmental<br>  - she's travelled a bit but not so much that she's been all around the world and there's very little for her to see<br>  - has a little bit of geek to her, meaning she likes the odd action movie, knows the difference between a Wampa and a Wookie, but not necessarily hardcore geek<br>  - likes meeting new people and is pretty outoing<br>  - knows a second language <br>  - likes to sing and has a great voice, oh yeah, and plays guitar!<br>  - has healthy relationships with her family and friends, sure they fight but it's never long term<br>  - is NOT still hung up on her exes<br>  - appreciates that guys need "guy time" and I'll appreciate that she needs to go dancing with the girls.<br>  - a killer smile that makes a guy's heart skip a beat<br>  - is somewhat confident but not a princess or spoiled or think she's "all that", yet demure and shy enough to blush or redden in the cheeks when I tell her how beautiful she is. <br>  - is not a clean freak but not necessarily a messy slob either<br>  - has a job and has somewhat stable in her career and financially<br>  - no kids (sorry, I'm not ready to be "Instand Dad")<br>  - likes to read a variety of authors<br>  - likes a variety of music and has a well rounded ecclectic taste<br>  - is considerate, polite, has a wonderful heart<br>  - if she's mad @ me, she'll tell me, not hide it from me, or make me guess<br>  - likes pets and kids<br>  - likes romanticism and chivalry<br>  - will be that person who will gently guide me when I need it, sometimes she'll lead and I'll follow, sometimes I'll take her by the hand and lead the way, she's my partner in crime and my best friend|`|hZjUHAmUaa	5'3 - 5'10 105lbs-130lbs, Fit gorgoues burnette.

You don't need that Sh*t just remove all of the negative people in your life and tell them to grow up.  Your happy and the people who love you should be happy.

Best Wishes to you and your husband!|`|ntef2sPMaa	their just mad because you have it all and they dont. they want what you have and they wont stop at nothing. try not to notice and go on with being happy. their jealou, forget them. and congradulations on being married. :)|`|kR4WMGbqaa	is she jealous?<br>  has she always liked your husband.<br>  <br>  ;)|`|m3cf7vsAaa	Jealousy honey jealousy.  Women are competitive!  They're all actresses and all the world is a stage.  They may act as if they are "happy" for you but in reality the sh*t talking makes it very obvious that they are envious of your happiness and probably know flat out that they will never be equally as happy.  Put your chin up and don't talk to your cousin, or trust her with information you don't want the ex friend to know because she will tell her.  Love your husband and try to meet new girlfriends.  A friend whose a girl and actually cares about you is hard to find but once you have some, you'll have them all your life.  It took me until I was 22 to meet a true friend and trust me that I had a lot of trial runs before that.  I got my feelings hurt and a lot of drama brought upon me.  Truth is, true friends wont act this way.
tRcO5uyiaa	Yes. I was controlled by my mom and step-dad from age 9 to age 15 (my real dad left our home when I was 7 yrs old). I left their house at age 15 because I couldn't stand to live there anymore. There was weird mental abuse from both parents and physical beatings from the step-dad if I did something that was not 'good enough' for his "standards". Both my sister and I were terrified to live there. It was like living in a jail. I'd come home from school and be thinking of a thousand different places to go besides to my parent's house. I was just devastated every day. Finally, after one big argument about my grades not being good enough (I had straight A's and one B), and hearing the name-calling and "not being good enough", I left my parent's house the next morning with a garbage bag, got on the school bus, and never went back.<br>  <br>  It has now been 27 yrs since I left. It was extremely difficult to try to survive on my own so young, but I managed. I put myself through college and was able to get good jobs, finally getting a career with government. I've done several things in my life - travelled extensively, saved a down payment for a home on my own, and have a retirement income. So I didn't do too bad for a child who was "such a loser" all those yrs ago. Unfortunately, I found out I have a mental illness (over 10 yrs ago) and my parents will not speak to me at all. At first I thought everything was my fault, but since I've had treatment from my psychiatrist, those feelings are slowly going away. I will not say what my parents told my sister about me. My sister and I keep in touch, even though it is strained. My parents and I have not seen each other for nearly 12 or 13 yrs. I do not miss them or think about them.|`|nMcjBv4saa	yeah i didnt really have to do anything eventually they left me so all good :)|`|2LmfQUbKaa	YA MY MOTHER EVERYTHING SHE WANTED I WAS SUPPOSE TO DO WHEN I GOT WITH MY HUSBAND AND I HAD TO LEAVE AND I COULDNT DO ANYTHING OR SAY ANYTHING TO MAKE HER CHANGE AND IT HAS BEEN 10 YEARS SENCE I LEFT AND SOME PEOPLE JUST DONT CHANGE I HAD TRYED EVERYTHING WRIGHTING LETTERS TAKING THE BLAME TRYING TO TALK TO HER IF THAT DONT WORK I WOULD SAY GET AWAY MWYBE THEN THEY WILL SEE YOU ARE SERIOUSE!|`|RiHiOCANaa	yeah i stood up 4 myself gave attitude n put my opinions out there
zycEjQKNaa	Well I have not gone lifting in awhile but I can bench i would say about 110, and can squat about 135 and lift maybe 100....idk its been about 5 months since i lifted because i am no longer in my weight training class. But when I was in that class I was a beast. I could do more backward push-ups then the football players, and was the only girl who tried to get anything out of that class.
4QHanq1Laa	I can lift 65 on a bench press. I dont do it often though, cuz I dont like looking bulky.|`|a7VkyZLfaa	I can but usually I dont carry things because I have to act as a female ,this is a guy job , if I am alone and I need to carry something heavy I will but if there is a man with me I will ask him to do it .

Good luck with it though. If I were you I would get her the one that is closest or is her favorite color.

JuNf9cnJaa	How old are you is the first thing?  Secondly.... IRAN!!!!! hmmmm I'm assuming you are from USA or something?>  Girl... meet someone locally, just trust me, Iran is not some place a girl wants to be just meeting random men/boys you've just met, especially if you were raised in the US.  <br>  Thirdly, if you don't know how to get a Visa, then you are FAR too young to be making a decision to move to Iran for a guy who "told you about his family".<br>  wow!!! <br>  Hey I come from a wonderful family, have 2 sisters a dog and a cat, I moved to Vancouver and its so beautiful and I'm a wicked awesome person.... <br>  Is that convincing enough to make you up and move here?  No no no, silly girl!<br>  Again wait for your time, you will meet someone local, and you will feel these same feelings, you do not need to move to Iran to meet a nice boy:-)<br>  Good luck<br>  <br>  EDIT:  P.S. how do you know this person is who they say they are?

FQxUpc9baa	it sounds as if he does.  so give him that hint that u like him to make sure your hand touchs his etc.
d1MN9G31aa	Kind of hard but it can be done.  I think it means showing a different kind of love.A really caring genuine and sincere love that is just about principles.That can overide even our own needs and emotions,and can be very hard on oneself,but best for the other.Hopefully.If we arnt making a big mistake!.But much time spent together should tell.<br>   I had a long term relationship and eventually knew that in the longer run it wouldnt be good so we had to split.It was a sad time and I suppose it shouldnt have gone on that long anyway if we were not going to get married.Something I would want to be more sure about much sooner now.But it was difficult because I missed her for a long time,her love,her warmth,her making me feel so needed.<br>  However,if someone was letting me go then I would be wondering if they really wanted me that much.I would feel hurt.|`|FQxUpc9baa	yep i just did it. and yes  it did hurt but in the long run i think it was best for both of us. it's been 6 mths since i let go. and now we r just trying to be friends|`|6q86rICnaa	I'm doing it right now and it kinda hurts like hell. Worse coz he's wondering why I want to break up with him, but it is much better for him this way and I wold hate to see him make a mistake and get hurt because of something I've caused.
mshPaOeHaa	This shows that he really likes you for the kind of person you are and is concerned about you. He cares a lot for you. And maybe somewhere he is jealous of your boyfriend. But i guess that's about it. Just take it as a compliment and don't ponder too much over it.|`|99ca2ca70cb2b3160d7f4d2f2beccd18aa	ask him what he means<br>  he probably means it <br>  as a compliment as<br>  in, "you are so kind"<br>  and that he is lucky <br>  to have you as a friend|`|sr0vZPQqaa	An insult! you're weird.|`|BKr3y30maa	I would take it as an insult, BUT at the same time....it seems to me that he is telling you that because he doesn't want you to be taken advantage of.  Maybe he is thinking that if he tells you that, you will do more things that you want to do.  I think he cares about you and just doesn't want you to be treated like a doormat, which is sweet.|`|nUq4A3Xcaa	I don't take it as an insult, but that you should be aware that there are those they would take advantage of your sensitivity, so you should keep that in mind, in your current relationship.  I don't take it that he is saying that because he would love to be with you, but merely stating that his opinion is you are an ideal mate.  However, I would say it is a strong possibility that he has feelings for you, then again if you over analyze it, hmm he is the one suggesting that you could be easily taken advantage of....|`|0fbcc59fc901bca7e0ca600714a7fb88aa	Here's my story and you make dibs from this.... My last marriage, my husband ran around making all kinds of "girl" friends.  I tried my best to be the best wife and always overlooked things that should stand out in your head like a red flag... My "male" friend kept telling me, you deserve better.  Why do you stay with him when he is doing this to you.  You are truelly a beautiful woman and very special.  <br>  Well, I eventually got divorced, moved away and tried to put my life back together the best I could for a single mother struggling.  About 2 years after, I ran into my male friend again.  Now, we are soooo happily married and everything is right in my life.  I truelly believe God chose us to know each other well and to eventually put us together because we both deserved to be happy in life and love.  TaaaDaahhh|`|17ded6df7e87d2c7857de488b08712c0aa	Essentially, he thinks that you are a great person to be around because you handle every interpersonal situation you encounter so well.  That could obviously be a hint that he has feelings for you or he could be giving you the credit he feels you deserve, as a really good friend should.|`|2TAq6XO2aa	ask him what he meant by it
CCLLnSrGaa	get to the docs for the morning after pill.then get him to put you on the pill.always use condoms as well|`|hHndD5SEaa	dont EVER use this method - its NOT effective.

He is being a flirt but let him be the flirty one not you.|`|LCLpSa5Faa	Yea I wouldntt worry about it.

I think it is a mental thing going on here and a psychiatrist is equipped to find out what is going on with you.|`|VFdC2wPlaa	You are depressed. Depression is a problem for a lot of people.

You should but he will only put you on Prozac or something like that.  But people are starting to depend too much on medication to make things better.  <br>  <br>  I am going to be very blunt now but you need to just suck it up, figure out for yourself why you feel that way and fix it.  Only you can control your happiness. Not your doctor, not a pill or Yahoo! Answers.  I have had this problem and someone told me that same thing but they were not as kind about it.  but they were right.  Thats life!  You just got to deal with whatever it throws at you and deal with it.  <br>  <br>  Also, pray.  Whatever religion, pray and it will be better.

So why take the chance on meeting and marrying a man that I might be disappointed in later in life.  My husband had NO money when we married, but we have built a comfortable life together.  If we were poor we would still be in love.  But really, you must know yourself.

You should play along, though, tell her you fantasize about her ALL the time. You might get a little sumpin' sumpin'! Don't forget your raincoat!|`|JfsVqoiDaa	She wants to hear you say her name.
q0b6uPCraa	Come on you can do it!<br>  There are other people in the world who have been burnt or disabled or paralysed. You are ok. You will get through this.<br>  <br>  Just relax for a minute then carry on. If you carry on now then your brain will get confused and you will stress. Stressing is bad for your heart you know!<br>   <br>  Afterwards you can have a nice relaxing bubble bath and pamper yourself. Fancy that?<br>  Just carry on and you can have a cookie.|`|lPNP9bt2aa	you are the best of the best<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  you are the winner<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  you are powerrrrrrrrrrrrrr|`|2AdJStDYaa	Stop what you're doing. Walk away from your computer and eat something, or have a shower or go for a walk. Once your head is cleared, return to your computer. If you continue right now, no offense, the final product is likely to suck. There comes a point in work that your brain is overloaded and shuts down, and needs time to reboot, so to speak. Give it a break, and come back in a little while. If time is an issue, listen to this. It will most likely take you longer if you stay here and procrastinate because you have no ideas. Take a break. Trust me.|`|AA11609972	Take a short break, stretch a bit, have a drink preferably hot chocolate, put on some music but keep volume low and try again, remember you are not the only one doing homework.|`|hRrCAewyaa	Unless you already have, maybe build an outline of bullet points to get yourself going again.  Do some brain storming to include what you already have and then maybe your brain will give you some more ideas?!?|`|UYU1kapPaa	You can do it.  Put your pencil down, close your eyes, and take a deep breath.  Put some ideas over on a scrap piece of paper (brain storm for just a few minutes).  Good Luck!!!  YOU CAN DO IT!!!!|`|AA10350513	i have it worse than you.<br>  i just pooped my pants, and then sat down real hard. ewwwwww!|`|AA10333823	Just take a break. I'm in AP English, so I know how stressful writing can get.<br>  By taking a break and relaxing, you allow more creativity to flow. Do something you enjoy for half an hour and then come back to the essay.|`|VFdC2wPlaa	Keep going... you can do it! lol your almost half way done. Remember that the faster you get it done..... the sooner you can do something else.|`|Sl0rFha6aa	Ummm...<br>  Thats a little pathetic.
PXfUyd5aaa	No, you didn't over-react. You just feel bad because she apologized. It happens to me all the time - I get pissed, and then the person acts sullen and remorseful, and all of a sudden I feel bad for flipping out.<br>  <br>  Remember that she apologized because she knew she was wrong. Dead wrong. And she was. WHAT THE HELL?! SHE HAD SEX IN YOUR BED. That's ridiculous!!! Life is not a romantic comedy, people can't do that!!!<br>  <br>  So don't feel bad.|`|QQ1Vwsj8aa	I probably would have let it go as long as they changed the sheets,but if that is how you feel you don't need to justify it.  And, that was very cool of your friend to listen and hear you and apologize..|`|y4w6ybr3aa	I think its very disrespectful. <br>  She apologized, if your still upset then just cool down before you talk to her again.<br>  You have every right to be upset, but I wouldn't end the friendship over it.|`|9faf164b8bfd02a8adbd83229d74816baa	No. Your actions had warrant because they should not be using anyone else's bed but theirs. Having their little scene on someone else's property is VERY disrespectful and you were right to be upset.|`|TNTZkez8aa	i would be hella mad but if she apologized there is nothing else really to be done. just tell her if they do it again you are taking away her key|`|Axl0RXu9aa	I think you did exactly what any "normal" person with self respect would have done. They were totally in the wrong and it was, as you say, a VERY disrespectful thing to do. As long as you have let her know your feelings and, to her benefit, she did not try to minimize it and has promised not to do it again, then I think...let bygones be bygones. Don't hold a grudge. Kudos to you!|`|956a1082568ff3ffbd89f1b19cccb386aa	I wouldnt be mad at all. i'd simply ask if they washed the sheets! (and change them anyway) now if they said they brought a prostitute over and had sex in my bed...i'd be furious!! however, i'm assuming she was there cause she was watching your house while you were away or had permission to be in your home. did she and her bf simply know the house was empty and help themselves? if so, i'd be PO'd at that aspect...not the fact that they had sex in my bed<br>  ps just saw you dont use sheets on your mattress...thats really bad...get a tight fitted sheet..|`|6kBNHzSVaa	you have every right to be upset your bedroom is like your sanctuary -at least she apologized for it and hopefully she at least had the courtesy to wash your sheets after cause that is gross -just chill out for awhile you already told her how you feel don't end a friendship over something like this|`|onrcmQf8aa	To me,  that is disrespectful. Not only is it a form of disrespect, but it's disgusting.  They are leaving their bodily secretions in a place where you lay your head.<br>  <br>  You have every right to be angry.<br>  <br>  Please answer mine:  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AiVrY05mwGZkfHHBBxRwZ9Lsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090223071521AAK5y8t">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|8RCANzJvaa	a persons bed is their own private area , if you will. id be pretty p.o'd too. tbh i woulda done the same thing. waht she did is just not right.|`|2gstVBcMaa	No you did not over react because that was not only gross but completely disrespectful.  It is a good sign that she apologized without trying to justify it, because i really really sometimes people do make mistakes especially when hormones and sex is involved ( I mean its a pretty normal thing to not have 100% rational thinking when in those "intimate" situations).  So no, you did not over react, just try and move forward and try not to let this ruin your friendship.  just be sure to wash wash wash those sheets:)

Which means that they can also choose their sexual partners. Although people may believe it is wrong for a 30 year old man to be sleeping with a 16 year old but Its not illegal, therefore its just people opions when they state its " wrong" Its wise for a 16 year old girl to be sleeping with someone she knows and trusts and is around the same age as her, but of course if she chooses she wants to bed someone older that is her lifestyle choice|`|KFUsmwItaa	I would say 24 is the limit.|`|6UmRmaeWaa	im 27 and coul not see myself with a 16 year old.

So don't worry about "the fish in the pond" right now.  Relax....take some time to accomplish goals that you have set.  If you haven't set any, nows the time to concentrate on that.  <br>  One day you will want nothing more than to be a kid with no responsibilities again....so don't miss the opportunity now.  Good luck. I hope this helps.

2svonkw1aa	okay. 1st off. do NOT commit suicide over a BOY. he is NOT worth it. NO guy is worth it. (Romeo and Juliet were stupid and extremely bad examples.) and even if things don't work out. you are 15. there will be so many other guys in your life, this one might be special now but he may or may not be in a couple of years. and it would be a shame to lose your life over a guy that won't even be in the rest of your life. (not saying he won't, just saying he might not)<br>  <br>  so anyway. to your problem...<br>  Put on the bulletin something flirty like, "hmmm. maybe we should find out ;) " ... that'll definately get his attention. just be flirty and be yourself. obviously if he talks to you then he thinks you're cool. Try and get his number and text/call him. Make sure you don't rush things. talk to him a lot and when the time is right (you'll know when it is) tell him you like him (not how much cuz that might scare him off) if he doesn't like you back then just blow it off and ask if you can still be friends (that way you're not bored at that family thing) <br>  <br>  Hope this helps. good luck hun! and message me if you need any more advice. =)|`|01WTU3gVaa	1)Calm<br>  2)down<br>  3)please.<br>  4)Breath<br>  5)in.<br>  6)Breath<br>  7)out.<br>  <br>  And hang out with him, myspace is useless.|`|g1tF4HUnaa	Well I think if he liked you maybe he'd be up for hanging out with you sometime, so why don't you invite him along to hang out. Don't try anything too much yet, like a big date with candles and stuff - or the cinema even - just send a message saying "Hey, are ya up to much this weekend? maybe wna hang out r sumfin?" and see what he says.

It actually hurts me when people say this because my friend commited suicide. You should see the impact it has on everyone in your whole town. Trust me.

pPr4gWXyaa	prudent saving and investment that's the good old fashioned way, there are no quick fixes making money|`|aipChC3haa	Get a job, just a little one, at a McDonald's or something and it will work out good, because all of the money that you make from that can 80% into the wedding, and 20% goes into savings for after you get married and hopefully a down payment on a house.|`|fc76816ec74874b1d44f6e87125ce2baaa	Well if you mean you have to save 10K you will need to put away just under ￡420 a month for 2 years, half that if you only need to save up ￡5000, a lot of money I know!

You moved on and have no problems which is so lovely for you.  Pay no attention to this needy character and if he should text you back or say hi, wish him the best of luck and move on.|`|IPS3hWweaa	I think it was a mistake. You shouldn't text him at all anymore.

He'll text you just to find out if you're still okay with talking to him, in case things don't go well with his ex.|`|64b71311b453645560ceb49d58250d08aa	if he called her name out once instead of yours, thats who he is going to be thinking of if you hook up with him again. and how many times was he thinking about her before.|`|JtQvOLqkaa	No, I don't think it was a bad idea.

You've done all you can.  Just let everything fall where it may.  I think you handled it like a mature adult, he's the one being the immature one about it, so leave him in his own world.  He's making it a bigger issue than it is, and you need to completely move on from him.<br>  <br>  Goood luck!|`|AA11300875	It seems like you know you wont get back with him, and good for you if you stick to that.<br>  As for being a nice person, their is nothing wrong with what you did, some people would just handle it differently.<br>  Just dont lead the guy on, take your friends advice from now and just ignore him.<br>  If you run into him in person, you can say hi, but I wouldnt bother with the txting or email.
PBOWJYQ6aa	The figures, whether correct or not, do not account for the hundreds of other factors involved. The question is impossible to answer with any degree of accuracy. For example, If the man makes $75,000 a year, and meets a woman who is technically poor but lives on $200,000 a year because her wealthy brother buys her everything she asks for, she is finacially wealthy, technically poor, emotionally destitute, and as to whether she will date the $75,000 a year guy- who knows. It may come down to what else he has to offer. Is either of them rich or fit? Depends on your perspective.<br>  It depends on the person and the circumstances.|`|qNfrFm9Caa	Just because you are rich doesn't mean you are a snob, and just because you're poor doesn't mean you don't get sh*t in life. They are plenty of fit poor people out there. My fiance and I are not anywhere close to being rich (and he was actually homeless when I met him, thanks, and we are both fit, and happy. We're together because we love each other. I don't know where you got your statistics, but quit being a douchebag.

SN2LzME2aa	I had my first "romance" when I was 12 too!<br>  Truthfully, I would talk to him just like you would any friend and when you become close than you can maybe hint that you have a crush on him by asking him what he likes in a girl, etc. <br>  <br>  Good luck honey!|`|DNq6u1ygaa	well, First that's stupid, the Church cant control ut love life. but find out what he likes and talk to him about those things. you can also find out if he likes you by just seeing if he flirts with you. you can do that by just being around you. plz don't find this offensive, but he might no be into you right now because he is older then you. but if you are around him more he might see how cool you are! hope this helped!!!!! Good luck! PS. don't worry, i know just how you feel to I REALLY like this guy, but I dint know if he likes me. I really want him to, but im just not sure. double PS. im 12 to!!!! awesome!|`|bE0KxI9Xaa	I don't like that rule. It's not fair. I wouldn't ask those questions because you don't want him to know. That will sort of give it away. If he is like 2 years older, you need to play "Hard-to-get." impress him a little and flirt. Get his number (As a friend.) If I were you though, i would tell him now, because you might not like him when you get a little older. Just let it out! Who cares what other people think! You never know...he may like you too!!|`|ff545BLyaa	And this is why religion sucks any one with me???  We I may not be a girl however I would say that you should just talk to this boy.  What could possibly go wrong just be friends for awhile and see if you make a connection.|`|WLj5UZoOaa	aww your only 12, thats cute :)

And by the way, when you get on here and comment that you are with the mother of your child.  Be with the mother of your child emotionally as well as the rest instead of getting on here and telling us all that you still like her but you are with the mother of your child.  So, you can either choose to be with the one who acts like a child or be totally faithful and respect the one with your child.  You see where I am coming from?|`|LHnVjJqsaa	stay away from her! THATS THE SKANKIEST thing ever...god i feel sorry for your new girl...does she know? id kick her @$$ if i was ur new gf...or jsut bluntly tell her to cut the bullshit that its mmature and she is acting like a hoe with no self respect....IM NOT calling her a hoe...im saying she is acting like one...|`|x851kjHuaa	just dont f*** up with your chick the one you got not and ignor the other chick just be friends
JCdBSULraa	It's a good thing.  Girls like tall guys, even if they're fat.  I think if most girls had to choose between Tom Cruise (5'2") and a fat guy(270 lbs+) who was 6'4" they'd usually take the fat guy.  <br>  <br>  In general, girls view a guy's personality like guys view a girl's slenderness<br>  girls view a guy's height like guys view a girl's personality.<br>  <br>  That's pretty confusing, but basically your tallness is the 2nd most important thing a girl will look for. The taller, the better.|`|T4N6a7MQaa	She most likely only meant that you are a large person. Take it as a compliment if you like. Some women actually do prefer larger men.
kGBli717aa	You better find out if she is. If she is pregnant, you should try to patch things up with her; you still care about her, plus if there is a baby, well, you will want to be that kid's dad, if not now, in the not too distant future.
8XKmMBU7aa	baby brilliant I don't have G/F<br>  I can't think this but according to your question my answer is that .....<br>  If She don't love me, I will Love her more and more.<br>  <br>  have a nice day and nice dream.|`|cfa1e4823e92f3f00446eed5231e68faaa	DUDE!! dont waste your time then if you love them enough dont keep them in the relationship b/c she could be out there looking for another guy...yah know.....but to benifit yourself its not a healthy realtionship when someone doesnt love you to the fullest yah know so while you could be out there searching for another girl you are stuck in this relationship that isnt really for real <br>  if it were me i wouldnt stay in the realtionship b/c it would be a waste of my time but i would also discuss it first with my bf yah kno cause that would be really sucky if you just out of know where broke up with them just do what you think is right=]|`|oQkwZhXpaa	Well there isn't much you can do in all honesty...<br>  <br>  I would just remind myself that the fact that they are still around must mean something, and that as long as they are still with you, they still love an awful lot :)<br>  <br>  Also, I would just keep being nice, give out compliments, hugs and make them feel special, and they will see how much you like them, which is something attractive in itself. Be there for your partner and reassure them, just be nice...no one can flaw that..<br>  <br>  Good luck, you'll be fine, I hope this helps :)|`|gVMmdeLcaa	well... they say absence makes the heart grow stronger... Take some time apart.. i dont mean break up just go stay with some family for a week or something.. and she'll realise how much she misses you|`|TXY6EAYqaa	Maybe if you give her more time she will express her feeling towards you.

q1pwHXrMaa	That he is way to immature. He is constantly contradicting himself so that means its not you; he's nutz. <br>  <br>  Do yourself a favor and find someone else b/c all he is going to do is continue to be a huge headache and annoyance.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|fmIDB4ZFaa	He sounds very unstable.<br>  I would not date him again.
kGBli717aa	If you like him, you need to go, it's a package him and his son. It shouldn't be too bad as long as your bf is there with you. Just be polite and try to stay neutral; the mother sounds like trouble, so try to avoid any problems with her; she could make your lives miserable. Your bf will love you all the more if you are there to support him and of course let him know that you think his kid is great (even if you don't!).
OyWVqe23aa	no. all he has to do is give it up everynight. do you use sunglasses so the *** doesnt get in your eyes?? thats really smart. i like you. we should be friends. tell me more.|`|9l6MOZ8Paa	depends on if he loves her or not|`|T4N6a7MQaa	If it's just for sex there's no reason to do anything for her. What you are asking is bordering on a relationship.|`|VZVGXRyraa	In this type of a relationship there's no *should*. It would be person specific, depending on how the guy feels. If he wants to do certain things for her past the sexual relationship than that's up to him.<br>  <br>  There aren't set rules for what should and shouldn't happen in a sexual relationship.|`|sXnoIFRsaa	This is weird but okay, look this is a booty call and a booty call is just that.

sXnoIFRsaa	Sorry for you and for him.  This is not healthy and you need to think back when you and him first got together and remember why you fell in love with him in the first place.  Stop being on the defensive number one and start listening more.  Explain that he needs to be a better listener also and remember the most important people here are your kids and you are ruining them by letting them here your fighting for the sake of the kids stop.|`|577ba10a2319b430720b5a913b74b862aa	it's not necessarily over, but it sure needs a LOT of work, from both of you.  you BOTH must agree to get help or do whatever it takes to make it work.  there are things in life that can get in the way of even the best of marriages -- kids, finances -- and it takes work and commitment from both partners to make it work.  the two of you must decide if you both want to try to make it work and make it good again.<br>  <br>  good luck!!|`|IPS3hWweaa	Yeah, that's done and over.

For the kid's sakes, I'd want them to grow up in a happy loving home otherwise they'll grow up thinking this is a normal relationship when its not.|`|rlUUaSgqaa	I don't usually like to recommend divorce for people, but in this case, I really think it would be the best option.  It's stressful and not healthy for children to be in an environment where there is constant fighting.  If he blames the entire problem on you and won't agree to counseling, then there's nothing you can do.|`|IvMPh09baa	fighting is normally just an a side effect of feeling so frustrated from lack to communicate to each other.  You are arguing constantly over silly stuff, because both of you deep inside are not actually talking about what the real problem is.  I think that there is a root problem here... something big is bothering both of you alot and its frustrating you to not be able to talk to each other about it.  So you argue, thats the only way to let out all your frustrations.<br>  <br>  Listen... the only way this will ever get better is if you both sit down and communicate calmly to each other what the real root problem is.  Obviously, you feel as if he puts you last on his priority list... you need to tell him what you need from him then.  without blaming him, without yelling at him... talk about how you feel when he chooses his job and family over you.  how does it make you feel when he does this... maybe he doesn't know.  hes not a mind reader, so you have to tell him how you feel... nothing will get better until you do.|`|AA10684513	Ok don't watch the movie Fireproof it was really stupid.  But if you are unhappy and not willing to work it out then move on.|`|jHWgdJMraa	I have been in this situation, what I did was finally listened to what he was saying I was doing wrong that would set him off and I put myself on hold for a little while, and concentrated on nothing but the thought of losing him and what it would be like not to have him in my life, and then I started just doing things for him and keeping a mental track of all the times I wanted to go off on him and did not and then I would look back at the journal after a few weeks and read my thoughts, my anger, the reaction I wanted to have at the time and did not, and I must say I am glad I did not lose my temper , because looking back at all the times I could have yelled at him and started something was not worth it at all, it seemed so stupid and Petty, and children should never be exposed to fighting like that, and he then seeing how open and loving I had become, and the sacrifices I was making totally changed and started doing and giving more, it took several months but it was well worth it, all you can do is give it a try. Good Luck P.S. I also payed allot and this helped too...|`|JgU9vaP4aa	you can go to counsling by yourself. and once your there you can find the answer to your question.<br>  he doesnt have to go with you. work on YOU BEING HAPPY and also work on how to argue fairly. changing you will help the relationship trust me. try this first before you try other options.<br>  maybe once you get to TALK ABOUT IT with someone.....you can see where to start.<br>  i wish you the best. maybe all you need is conflict resolution.|`|AA12396274	you don't say what you fight about, if it's just trivial stuff, just quit it , takes 2 to argue, i mean like him leaving a mess in the bath or clothes on the floor,or what ever just leave it it's his mess,|`|0UUDFxR0aa	Watch the movie Fireproof.|`|sCCjAKllaa	Then you two need to divorce or break up. That doesn't sound too good.|`|0j9rvsXAaa	I am an the same boat as you. All my husband and I ever did was fight fight fight. We have gone to counseling, but didn't get the chance to keep going for long because he went to jail for Domestic Violence. Now the only way I will get back with him is if he seriously gets help. There has to be a problem in your relationship that started you two to fight so much. You should think back what caused you to lose that good relationship with him. I lost Communication and respect with my husband because of his jealousy and insecurity. Also because we both had so much pride we both always wanted to be right and never wrong. We both held grudges against each other and always wanted to pay each other back for what each of us did to each other. The problem that I think what caused my husband to be abusive is that I was so disrespectful and so defensive about everything that he said. Which didn't give him a reason to hit me, but I think I should have been more understanding and try to control myself and should have helped him with his with his problem. So I think maybe you need to be more understanding, listen to him and try to resolve his problem then tell him that you need him to listen to how you feel to. I think communication, understanding, love, and respect is the key to a healthy relationship. I hope this helps and  I really hope you two get help before it's to late. I wish you the best!

It sounds like there is more to this story. <br>  Calling someone's parents is not cyber bullying, writing her nasty notes to get back at her IS cyber bullying.

b3zGfYMpaa	Unfortunate things happen, but why must you deem a single mother as someone financially unstable or someone just looking for a father figure for her kid? Not all woman are like that. It might be hard to see differently at first, but I dont think being a single mother should be written off first just because of that when she hasnt been given a chance to prove you otherwise. Some single mothers infact, are actually pretty successful and have chosen to be a single mother on their own because an ex has treated them badly in the past. If a woman can get away from a man like that shes already more well off  if you ask me. Whatever was going to be the consequences of being single..less money etc. I would never stay with a guy who wasnt right for me. Give some credit where credit is due. I dont know why society looks down on single mothers.|`|Kp46I3W4aa	good questions who knows?|`|u1Oi6tGHaa	I don't know.  Why do some women date douche bags like you?

I have had unprotected sex and the girl did not get pregnant. We both did the deed so I wouldn't consider her any more guilty than me. I can't judge her for splitting up with the guy either. I have had bad relationships too.|`|hwKFm7H8aa	are you 12?<br>  <br>  you need to start thinking....you got it all wrong...they date for sex.|`|OyWVqe23aa	they wanna get called daddy!!!<br>  and they know the mom is a ****.|`|x2weKYTpaa	i really don't know what to say about that one.

I wasn't looking for anyone.<br>    But i think some men like it because for some of us we are more stable, you don't have to worry about us going out with out you, you don't ' have to worry about us just throwing our  money away on stupid expenses, and we always have something good to eat.  lol oh yeah and you obviously know what we like to do during our free time :)|`|w6DJj1a8aa	my ex said that he would never date somebody who had kids and we were together for 2 years and we loved each other sooo much and i still believe that we still do soooo and it was real but the timing was wrong =) lol

There are much harder things to do later on in life, trust me.  If neither of them mirror your feelings, then you now know that your friend is not your friend and your boyfriend is not your boyfriend.  Time to start getting to know some new people, broaden your horizons!  Most of all, enjoy life, if you start looking for things that are wrong with the world, you will likely find them.|`|dDkbDIqnaa	You may be just paranoid and your friend could innocently have her eye on someone completely different... however if you think that a friend would do that to you, she doesnt seem like a good friend to have.  And if you think your boyfriend would reciprocate then he's not that good a boyfriend to have.  I'd relax if i were you and if the worst happens think yourself lucky that you dont waste any further time on people who should not be a part of your life.  If you turn out to be wrong, take this as a wake up call to having trust in your boyfriend and girlfriend.

iPNOVR6Gaa	I have 2 pieces of advice: <br>  <br>  1. Be yourself.  If he doesn't like you for who you are, it's not worth it.<br>  <br>  2. In the future, put questions like this in Singles & Dating, not Marriage & Divorce.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	OK, you have no way of knowing who he is, people frequently lie online esp in matters of dating. He could be married or he could be a criminal, so you need to do all you can to protect yourself by meeting in a public place, bringing friends with you to the meeting, bring a cell phone and do not give him any personal info. Listen to your gut when you meet him and if you feel any hesitation or uneasiness, leave immediately.|`|u1uECuFNaa	Honesty.<br>  Oh, please stay in a public place....<br>  Hard to trust anyone these days....and he will understand if he is really as nice as you say.<br>  I expect to see more questions from you. (to know you are okay, etc..)<br>  <br>  Did he take it down?<br>  Or just take one down and put another up a bit different?<br>  Just keep yourself in a public place and have your cell phone handy. He should not know your exact address anytime soon either.|`|t81MEJ82aa	There is no advice to give other than don't expect too much.|`|835887bcb03d75a14ac83bf2c7e41048aa	Just relax, let it flow and don`t try to be something you aren`t.|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	Stay public and dont go anywhere alone with him, I think that although the age gap is big the fact that he is divorced would worry me more as he has been there and done that etc.,<br>  Dont throw your life away on an older man unless you completely fall in love and I dont think this is going to happen or you would be ready for this meeting and know what to expect.<br>  Good luck and be careful.|`|qpAYU8Knaa	There is nothing wrong in dating someone, even an older person, you meet on line, if you are cautious. Do a background check on him. Your first few meetings need to be in a public place where you feel safe. If he lives in another state then how is your romance going to flourish? Long distance romances typically do not last very long. Are you looking for a serious relationship at your age. Being 33, he may be in search of a life partner. Are you ready for that? Think and act carefully before your relationship goes any further.|`|zMg4hQwDaa	33 is not that "old" relax, if you have known him this long over the phone etc, then it will all go fine. Besides that's how i met my husband.|`|AA12396274	i don't think you should meet him alone, he may be fine ,but he may also be bad bad guy, Don,t  You trust him too far.Please be careful.|`|AA10420452	keep in the public eye you never know what he could be hiding keep yourself safe and good luck|`|0LvWiESWaa	This is an open forum and you can ask questions wherever you like. <br>  <br>  I do agree that you should be yourself. Of course you are nervous as up to this point the guy has been kind of a fantasy. When we don't meet people in person, we make up our own ideas about them to fill in the holes meeting them in person would show us. <br>  <br>  I think it's a very positive thing that you are meeting him instead of dragging out an online relationship for years and years.|`|AA11602080	Be cautious of meeting ANYONE online.  Its easy to hide who you really are from others on a computer.  My girlfriend meet a guy online who was "divorced".  One day she got a rude awakening after 8 months of dating this guy and found out that he was really a married businessman.  His wife found her number in his cellphone and called her to inform her to back off her man.  She later confronted him and he confessed. <br>  <br>  He lived in another state and most of their relationship was online or on the phone.  The only time she physically spent with him was when he was in our city or he would have her meet him at a predetermined destination in other cities, but never the city he lived in.  The only thing she was to him was a free hotel, restaurant, and a piece of @$$.  She was hurt bad because he called her EVERY morning to say good morning without fail.  She was really fooled into believing this jerk really loved her.|`|b7bb85526b028b7f92b16c8204ed4012aa	I wasnt going to answer this but reading your question just raised a big red flag to me especially the additional details. Why would any guy take down his profile even before meeting someone, just incase it didnt work out or was is pofile deleted by the dating service due to violations? Something doesnt add up here. My answer comes withexperience in dealing with women who have had terrible dealings with meeting someone they just met on line in person for the first time. Some of the guys were actually arrested as sexual predators afterwards when I got warrants for their arrest.  The first no no youre already doing, you never tel anyone where you live or work and no personal info. you should have agreed to meet him in a public place with a friend nearby just in case. If hes legit he would understand you being cautious especially today. Please be very careful as you dont really know this guy yet. Its very easy to be who ever you want to be on the computer and really easy to entrap anyone. Trust your gut here and if you sense anything wrong at all get out immediately. I dont want to put a damper on your hopes but in todays world and being a father too, I just dont want to see something go very wrong here, so Im just telling you to please be very cautious but have fun. Good luck|`|sXnoIFRsaa	You are just having lunch relax for God's sake.  He lives very far away so it is doubtful that anything will come of this.  Concentrate on your studies and make something of yourself.  The age difference is not that big a deal the distance is.  Be careful tell all your friends where you are going and make sure they know his name and make and model of his car and that he knows they know it.  You transport yourself do not do not get into the car alone with this guy.
wKt2WljZaa	Well it's a bit tricky question. <br>  I personally feel that even if someone is going for the arranged marriage he or she should spend some quality time together so that they get to know each other well, the likes and dislikes, the nature of the other half, his/her interests, how he/she respect others feelings. Otherwise the road may lead to hell for anyone of them or both of them.<br>  <br>  Now when we comes to Love marriage we often see that all the attraction between the couple which was there before the marriage seems to just fade away when they comes in terms of the reality.<br>  But i have a few friends who were in live in relationship for a few years, now happily married.<br>  <br>  So ultimately i feel whatever you chose, be caring/romantic but yet a bit practical because along the path both will have to make a few arrangements or sacrifices to make it work. <br>  Moreover remember it's not only about two individuals as two families are also involved in this. So one should be very careful and wise while chosing a life partner as it may make or break a life... :-)|`|CF1R0TPvaa	Arranged.

8QEtcKhnaa	I have been in the same situation. My best friend who was a lot older than me I fell for very hard and he fell for me too. I was with my bf for 10 years at the time and we have children together. I ended up not cheating with my best friend although we both knew we wanted to badly. It's been 2 years and we seemed to have lost touch. He ended up finding someone who was much better for him than I could be and i am still with my bf and we still love each other so so much. I always think about what could have been but I also think that I am erasing all that we do have by thinking that way. I will always love my friend, always but I am happy with my bf and want to spend the rest of my life with him. Feelings are feelings you cannot escape them but you have the right to choose and make your own bed. You know you have a solid relationship now. Why sacrifice it for something that may not work. Most guys cheat. If you have found a loyal one, consider how blessed you are.|`|sr0vZPQqaa	Why do people always think the grass in greener on the other side. Do you not think if you got with the other guy that you would feel the same after 8yrs with him!|`|f7f0fd5f021b5d1e4672cdbda2a11ffeaa	You probably shouldn't ever get married if  a nice co-worker is enough to make you consider throwing away an 8 year relationship. Temptation is everywhere and if you don't end up hooking up with this guy, another nice guy you have a lot in common with is bound to come along.  If you are going to get married, you need to make sure you are committed from the get go or it is already over.
CYwha8Baaa	I am sorry but your scattered all over the place....<br>  <br>  I am quessing you cheated on your husband or something in that extent becasue of him not forgetting part<br>  <br>  I am not sure but you stopped in the middle of a sentence and<br>  <br>  DAMN it i really want to help you and answer your question but i cant without further information!
874EAxkfaa	see a marriage counselor, you are both too immature to handle your situation alone.|`|jHWgdJMraa	It sounds like you should have thought of that before you cheated on him. But he has not left yet so hang in there and try to regain his trust, anything you would say to him now is not going to be beleived because you violated his trust, so now you need to work hard to earn it back, and hopefuly he will notice and be able to forgive but remember it won't be forgotten.|`|Ag8pE3Cyaa	What did you go? burned one of his shirts?<br>  <br>  He hasn't forgiven you, he won't forget, he doesn't want to be around you,........but he wants to renew your vows?!?. Sorry I can't relate to you, I run my own ship.|`|2l7lbcJWaa	I don't understand what you did? Did I miss that part?<br>  You should right a book though, seriously. The whole first part of that is like the first chapter of a book and you can't stop reading. lol. But really I don't know what you did to him to provoke all this.|`|Vbdfphhbaa	its not fun being on pin and needles. a simple reminder that we are all humans does the job. that being said just because you made a mistake doesnt mean you are simply going to suffer tru this forever. you did something wrong,and he no longer trusts you. ok is he willing to work it out? and trust you again? if you are not fun with him,then what does he want? why is he obliged to be with you? <br>  <br>  the same way I pointed to my own husband I'll point to you:<br>  <br>  *if he cant trust you,is it worth it to be together then? I wasnt willing to be with him if he could not trust me,you either do or dont. you work at it or you let it be.<br>  *just because I did something wrong ,doesnt mean I'm not sorry. I was willing to face the concequences,even if it meant separating from him. but I just didnt want him with me because he had to...no such thing as had to...you love me or you dont.<br>  *forgive and forget,easier said than done,but it is possible. just tell him he is nowhere in near perfection and he will do mistakes of his own. maybe not as big as yours but he will. bringing back the wrongs in every argument is not right and should not be done.<br>  <br>  both of you have to figure out what you want from your relationship. it will take days,but its all in his hands and you must be willing to deal with the consequences,like it or not. living together and unhappy is not fair for either side. I would suggest a marriage counselor,specially if he is willing to hash it out. wait on the wedding vows and sort your differences,be willing to make changes,and be honest to each other.
xDdhUldraa	If he is getting upset over things that you don't feel are important, to me there is an issue there that could develop into something other then love.  You and he need to sit down and truly discuss all the BS (your words, not mine) that gets put out.  Then have him justify why he finds it important.  Then you need to come up with why it is not.  You need to come to an agreement on those topics.  Being that you are an "old soul" you would understand the importance of how things work for him.  Sometimes the issues that he sees as serious are for a reason.  It could be his upbringing, social norms, or personal opinions from observation.<br>  <br>  The mom issue.  That is a sticky wicket.  Two schools of thought here, and neither of these are ones anyone here, other then yourself of course, can make a judgment call on.  First one is where does your mom fit in your relationship with the guy today and then in 5 years and again when you and he have babies.  Will she be invited to the wedding, the baby's christening, the house warming of your new home?  Will you and he attend Christmas and Thanksgiving dinners there or go elsewhere?  If there is no fit in where these kind of answers lay then break off contact with her for now.  Explain that you have a life and are able to make your own choices and you choose him.  Obviously, the opposite answer applies if this is not true.<br>  <br>  Secondly, the other thing you need to examine is, is this relationship, (Yours and his), going to last that long?  Is this a fling?  Is it me learning what nearly 40 years olds are like?  Am I staying with him to harbor a deep anger at mom and showing defiance?<br>  <br>  No matter what you choose I will hope that you are able to get past all the anger that is there.  No relationship, be it with a partner or parent, can last very long with anger.  The easiest way to make it go away is to talk to the person and explain why you are feeling the way you do.  I find it interesting that sometimes when I feel a certian way and vebalize the reasoning for feeling that way that I recognize that my feeling is not worth the time I took being that way.  Just the exercise of saying it makes me recognize how silly I was standing my ground on an issue that I don't feel that strongly about.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|ZA11WBR2aa	I hope you are over 18 years old.|`|4HoVVCenaa	If you are 18, then don't worry about it.

You need to seek some counceling so that you can be on the same page at the same time with open communication.  Your mother is probably worried that you are being taken advantage of by someone much older than you.  She is only looking out for you....so don't be so hard on her.  That's from a 'Mom's' point of view.  I hope that things work out for you.  Good luck...I hope this helps.|`|31b9789366ff5be076f00fbeadf4d573aa	my dad was 17 years older than my mom but that was waaaayyyyyyy back when. like the way old days. they are both dead now so you can imagine how long ago that was. if your 18  no one can do any thing about it. if you and he don't see eye to eye and your just with him to piss your mom off.......well you should move on because the only people your hurting is you and him. good luck|`|tX2giFynaa	From my opinion you have to talk with your mother in front of your boyfriend.

I'll just tell you the truth. your parents will never accept your relationship until you are married. period. sorry. until then they see this older man disadvantage of their sweet young daughter. and that's just stuck in their heads. they wont believe anything else until you are married to him then they will accept it or at least that's what happened in our relationship and the stress between my parents and us. another thing, as long as you are with him you need to know one thing. he is older than you and he has had more life experiences than you so therefore if you trust him you should trust what he says or does, as long as it doesn't go against what you are feeling inside. If something inside your gut says no i don't agree, then listen to it. but if he loves you then he is wanting to teach you his way of life and to tell the truth it is easier to go along with it, if you agree with it, and it strengthens your relationship with him.|`|p40CU1AGaa	wow. i dated a guy for a while that was 19 yrs older than i. a very respectable man, every one in my fam loved him and approved of him just because i was happy. on the other hand, in the end we were just at total different stages in our life. if i was maybe 3 yrs older then i was, it probalbly would have worked out. <br>    if you are happy and  in love, your family should respect him and your situation. and if you LOVE him, you can work through it. no relationship is PERFECT. . .. <br>  GOOD LUCK|`|AA11662490	If you are already having this much difficultly then intensify this times 10 when you think of marriage.

Taking it personally is.  Don't take anything anyone else says or does to you personally.  People say and do things because of them, not because of you.  What do I mean?  <br>  <br>  Everybody comes for a particular life experience and perspective.  We react to other people based on our own perceptions of how life goes, what's right, what's wrong, but all of that is belief and value that belongs to the person who's talking.  It's not yours to own unless you agree with what someone is telling you and then you take it on as your own.<br>  <br>  My advice to you is this: if you love this man and if you appreciate him and if you can look at him every day and wake up committed to creating an enchanted love where you two are partners, healing one another, loving one another and forgiving one another, on a daily basis, then don't take what he gets upset about personally.  That's his issue, not yours.  Don't take what your mom says personally.  She's speaking from her life experience, not yours.  <br>  <br>  If, however, you are trying to change who you are to make the people in your life feel better about themselves, it's a no no.  You won't be able to do that forever and, one day, you'll get tired of trying to make yourself somebody you're not just to be accepted by the people who are supposed to love you unconditionally.  Remember: love IS unconditional.  If that's not what you're getting from any of the relationships in your life, it's because you are choosing it.<br>  <br>  Love the people in your life unconditionally and be loved by people unconditionally.  You do not have to change for someone to love you.  Their choice, if they want to be with you, is to love you just as you are for who you are.  Don't settle for anything less than unconditional love.|`|kXVagSmbaa	okay,if you love him thats all that matters.<br>  when i was 14 i was dating someone 18 years old.<br>  now i'm 17 and still with him,besides in 10 years it wont matter.<br>  dont break up with him if your happy.|`|AA10814815	Well, I mean if your really in love with him and all.<br>  If your 18 it doesnt matter<br>  <br>  BUT <br>  if your younger you kind of have a problem there...|`|2MvdB6SJaa	i take it your under 18.  so. yeah
K71ZlPWgaa	slow down with your relationship is perfectly natural to be like this. Tell your boyfriend that you want to slow down a bit he will understand and if that does not work, then you'll hav to breakup with him.|`|ZzfLnSjUaa	well his moving a little too fast for u i think u should just let him know before he gets all into u. Quit giving the poor guy hopes and just let him know easy|`|NzePT1QYaa	Whatever you do dont force it. If you want to love him then that is a sure sign you dont like him as much as he likes you. be gentle, dont hurt him, but the worst thing you can do is go 6 months down the line, still not love him and still be with him. But if you force it you'll hurt yourself and you guyss will probably end up with scars, even if you dont love him. if you care about him at all, just be honest. if every1 was always honest in relationships then it would save a lot of hurt. Hope this helps and good luck to you 2.|`|tWtMUZhnaa	If you feel you do not and cannot love him finish it.Do not pretend to yourself that it can work and you can love him if you cant
UpRdvpmXaa	Hey Victor, <br>  I'm sorry to hear about this. I went through the same thing growing up and often just got away from the situation. I don't know how they are around you but if its really bugging you, maybe one day you can go up to them when they're not arguing and tell them that it really is affecting you to see them fight the way they do. You're their son and I'm sure they don't want you stressed to the point of panic. Let them know that you'd really appreciate it if they could just be civil around each other because you love them both and it hurts you to see them be this way with one another. Maybe they can't see how its affecting you. Maybe they think they're just affecting themselves and need to know that its hurting you, which I can imagine it does. <br>  <br>  Let them know that you know this is affecting you and that you can't be around it. Suggest you may need to stay with someone else until they figure this out. That might get them realizing how much this affects you. I used to go to a friends house and stay there sometimes because being at home gave me panic attacks because I worried so much about their fighting. Think of things you like to do and go out and do them. If you like to ride your bike, go out and do that for a while in the afternoon so you're not there all the time. <br>  <br>  Important thing is just let them know and if that doesn't work, realize this arguing has nothing to do with you. They're not happy with each other, it doesn't mean they're not happy with you. If anything, they need to think about you a bit more and know not to fight so much around you. <br>  <br>  Good luck and God Bless You. Remember you have a loving Father who was willing to sacrifice his son for you and loves you :) John 3:16|`|sCCjAKllaa	I've dealt with it at a young age, and yes, it's very difficult. You have to ignore it, though, bro. There problems don't (Hopefully) revolve around you, so you need to not let it stress you. Parents argue and fight; that's just the way it is, and we all hate it. Get a nice girl or did things that will either get out of the house, or away from thr negative energy.|`|kQun71mpaa	well the best way to help you with the stress is just never come home. The only time that you would come back home is to sleep. Just always be out of the house, so that you don't hear them, and then that makes you less stressful. Or if you are in the house just blast up the music or cover your ears with something so that you can't hear your parents fighting.|`|p1gzHgAraa	im sorry you have to go through this. just realize that this is how NOT to be when you are an adult! lol.. i have been with my hubby for 5 years and have never argued-i love him too much to argue and fight-its just not worth the energy and hatred that follows.<br>  <br>  it would probably be best if your parents DID divorce. i grew up and my parents divorced when i was 9-and im glad they did.. they both were horrible together! .. <br>  <br>  How old are you? you should try to sit them down and tell them how you feel, and that you know your mom wants to leave,and that maybe its best if they do divorce instead of staying in a toxic, unloving relationship.|`|Wa9Zr4HHaa	I am going through exactly the same thing right now. They are barely even speaking to each other, and my mother wants a divorce. Just think that one day, you'll leave that crazy house and have a good life of your own.

Straight up!|`|iwIrQ4ncaa	one benefit is, if someone is kicking your @$$, she can definitely jump in and help you out.<br>  the down side is, if you piss her off, she can and most likely will kick your @$$. =P|`|FzFSzilmaa	try dating the woman, not her muscles...<br>  <br>  treat her like any other woman...|`|eM3tXyqBaa	you can spend your freetime wrestling with each other..joke!|`|msoDXmvuaa	they can get u needles when u decide ur gonna do roids with her.
GhmGtG3Gaa	Because the wife is to damn greedy!!!<br>  He they have joint custody she shouldn't be getting child support to!<br>  I mean cuz he's doin he's part in help raise her!!|`|AA11602080	Because one parent is the custodial parent (the mother) so the non-custodial parent (the father) has to legally pay child support.  The child lives with his mother for the majority of the year and she claims the child on her taxes.  Sounds right to me.|`|ryjnt3dhaa	Because he is the male.  No other reason is necessary in the american court system.  Men pay 95% of the child support in America.  It's completely unfair, but we live with it because it's the law.|`|AA12396274	because he is the Daddy, and Daddy's are supposed support their children, the court ordered him to pay it,|`|6d3d506f71ae558ee917c76931cf6a23aa	He may need to prove your story in court and have his support modified.|`|sCCjAKllaa	That sounds bad.

Sounds like she got him good. Nice guys finish last and obviously got tooken advantage of.|`|sXnoIFRsaa	This is the agreement that they came to when they filed for divorce.  Stay out of it, this is no concern of yours and if you are in a relationship with this guy keep your mouth shut.  She came into his life when you were not with him and she left his life the same way "when you were not in it"  Now start new and never mind about what he did before.|`|jHWgdJMraa	does the ex work? did the get a divorce because he was caught cheating? all this would play into a decsion the judge made regarding the child support|`|AA10684513	My ex does the same thing and it is because he makes more money.  That is just the way child support works SORRY!
VSVQHKwKaa	Yes, but our manner of romance is a bit different than women. <br>  <br>  Women's' idea of romance is a display of love and adoration.<br>  <br>  Men's' idea of romance is a display of respect and admiration. <br>  <br>  Any effort you make to display your caring nature (massage, shower together, cooking a meal, ect) or any time you can elevate your man's reputation (bragging about him, agreeing with him, taking an interest in him) is considered good romance.<br>  <br>  Flowers and chocolates....not so much. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|8a8e5dcc284740df009d2405e628cc0faa	no. no romance please. we like to be teased, tempted, made to wait on something we know will please us extremely. we like to be somehow denied something now but with a promise we will get it later and that if we wait it will be worth it. That is the mind game you want to play with your man, give in too fast and its over in 5.<br>  PS: do not make the wait last too long though or you'll risk him losing interest in you. a no no.|`|BMEMH7JLaa	I feel I should be the romancer's not the romancee|`|e98RKB35aa	I like it very much so. Good conversation and a nice dinner for two is just great and maybe a good desert too to share.|`|W1rCsvTzaa	I love it when my wife asks me to go out on a "date".  We only do this on Friday/Saturday so neither has to get up early the next day.  The date part is the normal stuff, could be dinner or movie or window shopping at this cool outdoor market near our house or some combo.  She always leaves a good 2 hours at the end of the night for a nice slow seduction followed by really fun S*X.  For guys the romance is only great, if it leads to the right ending.|`|fGE7hL12aa	I think women appreciate it more than men, but yes, I like a little romance. <br>  <br>  A quiet dinner for two, (when we actually have an evening to our selves), is nice.
n2gEupY9aa	Persons cannot be perfect. Bear that in mind.<br>  If you love and be loved in return,<br>  If you are accepted of being you,<br>  If you feel contented on what you have,<br>  If you are happy on doing everything.<br>  Then you are almost perfect.<br>  <br>  How can you feel that you are almost perfect?<br>  By letting you feel by the one you love..|`|Nc7clhzIaa	Perfection- is a false image people portray in their own minds to be flawless.  (my opinion)  I do not believe it exists. I do believe in close to perfect.  However, when it comes to personality, no one is perfect, but you can be completely lovable by all kinds.  A great personality I feel is someone who is always bubbly, happy, smiling all the time.  Don't let your bad days get the best of you.  Someone who will go out of their way for others through, calling them to check on them, generous to others, & just a giving person.  Someone who gives more of themself & expects nothing in return.  Someone who is always grateful for what they have & does not complain.  There are few & far between type people like this but they do exist.  They don't let bad weather or a bad day get the best of them.  Everyone likes a friend who is open minded, happy, & non judgemental.  Good Luck|`|mEMRv3MVaa	I have to say that nobody is perfect. Everyone will make mistakes.<br>  <br>  But it is VERY important to be picky. Make sure they have the same morals and standards. You can never change them, so just be aware of that. I would ignore some of those small mistakes they make if it really doesn't affect you, but some of those major ones that you may be unsure of or don't approve of, just be aware that you can never change that person. So, the answer? Just make sure they are as perfect as can be.|`|eq89yFoEaa	A person will be perfect when he or she understands that one can never reach perfection, and in spite of this realization, to love oneself for who he/she is. Nobody is perfect, but we can be the best version of ourselves by improving ourselves in the aspects of life that we think need more work, and we do this out of love for our own self and others.|`|pIGMbLHUaa	perfection is possible, but its in your eyes, only you can deside whats perfect for you or for a person. i thnk everyones perfect in their own way, lets make everything that way =S|`|AA12266415	sounds boring to me.

Perfect is intimidating to the person going for it and for the people around them.  It can be painful in several ways.  My husband seems to think he's perfect and that I'm not good enough.  <br>  <br>  Seeking perfection leads to selfcenteredness.  You will always be thinking about me, me, me.  <br>  <br>  Also when you finally realize that perfection is impossible you may be discouraged from just making a normal amount of effort.<br>  <br>  A better goal, a more acheivable goal is to be caring, humble, and grateful.

mCpC4Zjbaa	If I took a babysitting job I would ask the parents for specific things I should know about their kids. For example, whether I need to wash their hair in the bath (they may only wash it every other night) ... or they might like a certain story read to them before bed... they might sleep with the light on... they might have allergies...they might have a snack before bed... etc. These are things that only the guardians or the kids will know.  Most parents don't expect you to know the whole routine right off the bat.<br>  <br>  Also care for kids is different depending on the age group that you are looking after, so it's kind of hard to tell you all your responsibilities.<br>  <br>  But mainly you should make sure to maintain a safe environment, and handle any emergencies, or health issues that occur adequately. <br>  Treat them with respect, listen to their needs and try to fullfill them if they seem legit. Plan out a balanced day... ex.. time at the park, or a fun activity like going on a hike or swim, and then some developmental activities like (drawing, puzzles, writing, play dough , crafts,etc.) , and just fun general play time, maybe a movie or something, and schedule snakes and meals in between. <br>  <br>  You'll probably need to do some light chores, and hopefully you can get them to help (ex. putting their dishes away and making their own beds). <br>  <br>  Also, some kids take a while to get off to bed, so you might need to start early. Make sure they brush their teeth too! That is something some kids speed through or try to skip entirely!|`|4Wu660ITaa	play a game with them. don't just leave them on their own and hope they are good. spend time with them and get to know them as a person. a kid wants to be treated like they are older no matter what age they are so help by asking them questions.<br>  i have been baby sitting for years and find it is easier to have a good time and keep kids happier when the baby sitter while play a game with the kid.|`|GrtYEzcjaa	put them to bed mabe read them a story|`|AA10757358	Get the number where the parents can be reached in care of an emergency.  Find out what medicine if any you should give them and how much.  Ask them what to do if the child wakes up screaming like he/she has an ear infection.  Ear infectioins show up at night and every sitter needs to know what to do when that happens on their watch.  Find out what their favorite toy, stuffed animal or blanket is and what time they should be in bed.  Remember to write down the fire departments number and ambulance in case of emergency also the closest relative.

TCqrS8Vqaa	hiya chris, she wants the relationship to work as much as you do. she will be thinking the same as you,not knowing what to say etc.just phone her up,and start talking to her,ask her if she wants to start of at the beginning,or where you left of.ask her if she wants to go out, you pick the day.and hopefully things will go from there. and you will be all lovely again.good luck.|`|bNllesmMaa	Phone her, and ask her out for a date or casual meeting.  Go for a bite to eat, or watch a film, maybe bowling for a laugh.  If your old enough, go for a drink.<br>  <br>  Texting her shouldn't be the problem, its trying to get her to date you again.|`|TXY6EAYqaa	Just ask her if she has had a good day and that you have been thinking about her.  Nothing heavy.|`|oQkwZhXpaa	Well its obviously a good sign that she's told you how she feels and given you her number, but i think you should be careful about taking things too fast and repeating what happened before which made you guys split up in the first place. <br>  <br>  Say something nice, not too heavy straight off, keep it light hearted but be nice, like "oh..thanks for giving me your number, its chris, just wondering how you were, whether if your not too busy you'd like to meet up sometime coz its been ages. hows your day going?" something like that lol, you can prolly do a much better job than me XD do it quickly though so she knows your interested :)<br>  <br>  If she ignores your question, let it go for now, she may just feel pressured, but continue to text as normal about other random stuff. Compliment her loads and say nice stuff because girls really like that :)<br>  <br>  If she agrees to come out with you go for it :) just take things slow and go somewhere casual, like a movie or something, and again keep saying nice stuff. See how things go, and text her lots after saying how nice it was to see her, would she like to do it again sometime. Next time, have a talk with her about how you would like to give things another go, but don't say it too heavy, but just say it would be nice.<br>  <br>  Good luck you can do it :)
cXtEx98Haa	I think you already know the answer and are looking for us to validate what you think.  Here's a summary of what you said:<br>  She has "a family," presumably some other guy's kids.<br>  She has a house that is presumably hers not yours.<br>  She doesn't want to go into Bangkok because "she doesn't like to spend money."<br>  You are 19 and, in your own words "are doing things like a dude in his 30s or 40s."<br>  Several times you said it is s.h.i.t. and finally it is "major BS."<br>  <br>  Tell the lady thanks for the good times together, you wish her well, but you are ending the relationship as of today.  Be kind but absolutely firm.  Find somebody closer to your own age, have your fun from time to time.  Don't let your ex cry you into staying.  She has her family and her house; they are hers.<br>  <br>  If your question is one which gets a lot of answers, I assure you many will tell you you're being a fool.|`|4293T0LNaa	ur too young to be getting involved with a 35 yr old woman, ur still young and need to live a little, alot more than u are now, hit up the dance clubs like u said. if u dont love her and u arent happy, then get the fuc.k out now, u dont wanna spend the rest of ur life with someone who doesnt make u happy,|`|nyeYS0Seaa	You live in Thailand?

hrU14wMDaa	You need to separate yourself from them until your husband makes his family understand that they will properly treat his wife. You will no longer answer phone calls or listen to messages from his mother. <br>  <br>  If you must talk to them, just tell them that you do not allow people to talk to you in that manner and therefore until they can treat you kindly, you will no longer be able to be around them. It isn't a healthy environment for you.<br>  <br>  You really could have turned the phone call about her son becoming a police officer around on his mother. You should have told her that you thought she raised an independent thinking smart adult man who doesn't need permission to pursue a highly regarded career. That you are going to support whatever career makes your husband happy that it isn't in the best interest of your marriage to act like a second mother to your husband.<br>  <br>  Life is way too short to be treated badly by anyone.|`|ghz5D5iLaa	She needs to be put into her place. Tell her that you don't know why she thinks that she can treat  you like that but she is mistaken. You do not have to take it and you should stop. If she cannot behave stay away from her. My husband agrees with me on this so she takes her **** out on the daughter in laws that will take it.|`|Gk00iL6waa	Minus her out of your life, that's what. If your husband don't understand, tell him to contend with her...|`|2LmfQUbKaa	well sweetie its not your job to talk to her and that you have is great but your husband is the one that needs to put his foot down and demand that she respects you and if he cant or wont you will never get any respect she wont respect you because he allows her not to! not wanting you to fall out with your husband sit him down and tell him exactly how it bothers you and what you would like done! i hope it works out for you good luck!|`|02aea83d2f79ceb8f5615a37ae051608aa	Be rude back!!|`|WyDsza2Faa	Hey i know exactly where your coming from!!! The first time i met my mother in law she said to my partner it should be you sarah and Michael which was his ex girlfriend and son. I just walked out!! My mother in law ignores me or she'll talk over me continuously. My partner and i were at her house one day and i was trying to talk to her and she would look straight to my partner and start talking to him so he turned to me and said theres a brick wall behind you babe!!! So i literaly turned around and started talking to the brick wall like it was my mother in law! You should have seen her face. Priceless!!! To date i still dont get along with my mother in law and she's allways siding with my partners ex and treating him like he's a child and hes almost 30 so that really doesnt help matters. Sorry no real advice mate but i feel for ya x
gIajIrP9aa	That's definitely not cool. You should tell your friend because if he is looking at you that way than he is looking at other girls that way as well. Which means he must not understand the concept of a monogamous relationship.<br>  So even if you don't go with him and don't tell your friend he will just cheat on her with someone else and she will get hurt.<br>  It will be better in the end if you just tell her now. If she found out later from someone else about this than she would probably be mad at you for not telling her.|`|sbeoF50gaa	Let's say you tell her, will she be upset with you?

Behind hes girlfriends back he is hitting on her bestfriend not a smooth move atall. I think you should tell your friend. She doesnt deserve to be with someone that doesnt respect her. Although this may upset her and she may get angry you cant continue keeping this a secret because it will eat you up inside and she will be even more angry at you if she finds out you didnt tell her. Explain to her what happened and if she is smart enough she will leave him, because any girl deserves better then a guy who wanders around behind her back.. especially with her best friend.|`|HrDcaocMaa	GO with Him!  If you like him - than go for it!  But try to get him to break things off with her first, and than make "YOUR" relationship with him a secret from her until she's had enough time to bounce back from him...

n7uzcdRbaa	There certainly are families like you describe - they perpetuate the poverty and disadvantage.  The mum is probably repeating her own family experience and for generations the script is inherited. Mum has done well to get the better of her drinking problem. Unless you have evidence of a child at risk it is best not to make a report.  As chaotic as it all seems, it does maintain an equilibrium, like a diseased body.<br>  Often sons make there fathers proud the first time they enter prison, a similar family script.|`|RiHiOCANaa	call social services|`|dhpu8ZFkaa	They need help.<br>  <br>  As in helping hand... a guide in the right direction. <br>  <br>  The oldest daughter needs to get a grip, get money from the fathers, work hard and get her own place. It is unfair on her to rely on her mother as much.<br>  <br>  The son and girlfriend sound/are a joke... they need to get a grip on their kid before they bring more into this world, or the kid is going to be like the younger brother. Again, get a job dont rely on hand outs and mom.<br>  <br>  The youngest son.... needs mental help. He sounds like he has suffered/been through a lot. His father should not be allowed to have him to stay if he is allowing him to do drugs. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Yes, social services have a right to be involved. <br>  I would feel embrassed to be anyone of them... but I would work to improve the family image or atleast to not be tarred with the same brush.<br>  <br>  =)

GHZnLiYvaa	Hi, I'm sorry but I really need to tell you this. You have a ego problem too. Tell me one simple thing. At one stage, when you both know that deep inside you still like each other, when he wants to be with you, why do you play hard? I mean, ultimately its you who's gonna get hurt.Why can't you guys talk the things out, be straight forward, stop playing around for a while, get serious atleast for a while and sort the things out? My relationship was exactly in the same phase and that's what we realized we need to do.

ow7ZVVPsaa	Is this your 1st cousin - so either your dad's/mom's brother/sister's daughter?  This is not right!  What your father did is wrong, after all he is older than your cousin and should know better. Ask your father what if the tables were turned and you cheated with your cousins father - would he say that it is alright?  I dare say he would.  How do you handle this? I think it is best to ask your father that question.  Put him on the spot as and ask him what he believes you should do and then make the decision yourself.  Your gut will tell you what's best.  As for your cousin - I think it best you steer clear from her until you are settled with your feelings on the whole situation.  Cheers!|`|2LmfQUbKaa	i would sit him down and tell him exactly how you was feeling you are the child yes but it still your family it is happing to! and your cousin well there is no nice way to say that is just nasty she is young and every one makes mistakes not saying that was soooooooooooooooo wrong! i hope it works out just support them and follow your heart!|`|PbPiF2p3aa	Ugly.

If she does call, make one yourself to Child services. And be on the next plane to get the kids.

BAD TOO! but he needs to feel i deserve respect and love like any woman. and i realise if he cant give me this then i am better off alone....until someone comes that can give me this. <br>  to answer you question...... if he refuses to talk about it and wont change what do you do? ask them to leave becaue they need to experience life without you. a seperation is what is best for the other to see if like without you is as much fun as he or she thinks it is.........its a 50/50 chance. they will realise they need you......or they will walk, and if they walk then you r better off in the long run. <br>  i am saying this and at the same time dont let me fool you. its hard. but i also know its better for you.<br>  good luck|`|7foornMVaa	You deal with it with lots of hobbies, friends or liquior.  <br>   Good luck|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	Its obvious this person will not change so get divorced and move on, you will spend a lot of years being unhappy if you dont.

Being a girl myself, I know it hurts more if you are being led on to nothing. You really need to let her know.  It seems like its really bugging you, so let her know that as well.  Say, "There's something that's been bugging me for a while, and I know you would want to know.  So I just need to tell you that I care about you so much and this relationship we are in right now isn't working out.  I don't want to jepordize our relationship, and even though it hurts me to see you hurt like this, I need to stop before I hurt you even more.  I hope you understand, and I will always be there for you." just let her down easy, and make sure you're sitting down and flatter her, but don't over do it, and just let it out. :)|`|uBmomdQCaa	Ok, first off you have to be gentle.<br>  When you're "out", you can be like "its so great that were such good friends and its not like awkward between us"<br>  she might be like "we're more than friends, arent we?"<br>  You can be like "well no.. at least thats how i take this relationship"<br>  <br>  Something like that.

lAQG15kdaa	Well it sounds like you also don't know what you want because your wondering why he hasn't called in three days. Its hard going through the initial steps of divorce, and its normal to feel like 'do i really want this' He was probably really upset for a few days, but realized its for the better and that's why he isn't calling you and why he didn't answer your phone call.|`|IWWZdZRpaa	He wants his TV back and he probably got the first bill from his lawyer.  If there are problems there are problems.  You decide if you want to work on the marriage and then worry about his feelings.|`|PXNPL5Ivaa	im not sure, get everything out in the open tell him your secrets and get him to tell you yours and then forget about it and act like nothing ever went wrong, if he loves you then he is probably in despair, put him out of his misery...|`|goY0JHzlaa	The whole situation sounds ridiculous. Both of you need to make up your mind about what you really want.|`|PCw1zDtsaa	No,<br>  <br>  Please do not step outside of legal measures, its over.|`|uP4qnB6raa	It is a good possibility that it might be true. But at the same time don't give in until you really know for sure that you can trust him. Don't listen to anyone and whatever they say. Follow your heart and do what you feel is right. If you feel you can't trust him, then don't fall for it. Trust is the key ingredient to a healthy realtionship, and once someone ruins that trust, I think all should be over with. Unless you really see a change. But don't rush into any decisions. Ask him a lot of questions until your satified.
rpVQpJA7aa	I would take her to a special place...maybe something significant to the two of you. The place you went on your first date?! Or take her to a park for a picnic, and as you are pulling out the food, and handing her her sandwich or something, also hand her the ring, and tell her how much you love her?!|`|8khqSyxnaa	I personally thing calling it a "promise ring" causes problems.  Give it to her as a gift of your love and appriciation not as a title for the ring.  So basically a "promise ring" is saying, I want to ask you to be engaged to be engaged to be married?  That's dumb.  It's relationship suicide.|`|kmNm27JAaa	Make it special and personal to her so she will always remember.|`|DUPOEk1daa	Agree with Alex C.<br>  Don't call it a promise ring and don't try anything fancy with it, as it is NOT an engagement ring.<br>  <br>  On your anniversary, exchange gifts, keep it simple.

Weed's illegal because our government can't control and tax it the way they can with alcohol and cigarettes. When he starts drinking and driving, then you need to start worrying. Alcohol is a bigger poison than weed is, be glad that he's not into the harder stuff like coke and heroine... <br>  Try to smoke some with him.... I bet you'll like it.|`|0IsSBOgkaa	Hard problem. Things like this just get worst and worst.<br>  If I were you, i would break up with him. And find a normal, sexy and loving guy.<br>  But you if you loves him ,say  that its you or the drugs.<br>  He have to choose. Never get to close of a guy that deals with drugs.<br>  Because you are in danger more then himself.<br>  I really dont know how this things works at your country.<br>  But for me that lives in Brasil. That Terrible danger. They kill each other for 5 dollars or less, just because of drugs.<br>  Then stay away! or make him change|`|6IeiXBP7aa	I do not know how ya'll feel for eachother but communication is da key to a healthy happy relationship. If you think well know he is doing drugs let him know you do not tolerate it, suggest to stop or tell him he is not making you happy. Allow him time to think about it && if he loves you he'll try his best to quit immediately.|`|7465ac9a7d2ba579932941bf1ef1a071aa	If he is not meeting your values, than breaking up is your only option. Do you want to be in the same car with him when he gets pulled over sometime, and has weed or anything else on him? You could be in trouble too. You obviously feel very strongly about this issue and i know it is hard to break up with someone but you have to be strong, and stand by what your gut is telling you. If you are not comfortable with this situation, your only option is to break it off. Just be strong and smart, use your brain before you heart on this situation.|`|95b08c96cc8082f81aedcdfa3f5f6e45aa	First off you sound very young, and if thats the case GET OUT NOW! it will only get worse after college and beyond. If need wants a 4 wheeler that badly, then he needs to go get a better job and save his money to get big things like that. Not result to selling pot in order to make a quick buck.  Trust me darling, im sure you can do a lot better than this. And you shouldn't have to be drug testing your boyfriend, if you dont want your boyfriend to do drugs, get another boyfriend. You arent his mommy and you can't tell him what to do. If he "loves" you and he knows that you disagree with drug use, then he wouldnt do it. If he does do it then that shows that you arent worth anything to him. So give him an ultimatum, tell him it's either the drugs or me. CHOOSE right now! and if he chooses you then great, but be strong and stay on him to make sure he isn't doing it behind your back! but if he chooses the drugs, then walk away! It will hurt at first, but the pain will go away and you will move on! Be a strong and independent woman! And stand up for what you believe in! Good Luck!|`|Hxn5nAf9aa	Drugs are definately a serious business - especially if there's dealing involved.<br>  But you must really love this guy, so you just need to trust your instinct in whether to trust him or not. If he's lied to you alot in the past, it's a good reason to not trust him. But if he's faithful and honest -let him know that you're always there for him. :)|`|pDtoi6FUaa	um i think (ima guy and used to sell drugs) i think you need to sit him down and have a talk with him. now im going to warn you IF you do this and he stops he buyers (the peoplle he sells to) will start getting antzy and theyll want to know why he stopped and they arnt going to be very happy. but i hope i helped because i was a huge drug addict and seller and stopped because my girlfriend got pregnant. now 17 months later we have a daiuughter. but i had to quit selling and using to support my family.|`|zXazRsKzaa	Even if you love him, the two of you seem to have some fundamental problems. If he is selling weed, he is smoking weed no doubt. <br>  <br>  I think you should probably be a bit more understanding. In all reality he was probably smoking and selling weed before you, and he will keep doing it after you. I know you love him and it is hard, but people don't change. And even if he did for you, he would be bitter about it. <br>  <br>  I hate to say this, but you should probably just break up with him. <br>  <br>  Since you are so against drugs, you probably shouldn't have gotten involved with this guy to begin with. You can most likely do better.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|IPS3hWweaa	You should tell him that if he loves you he won't be messing around with GONJA!

I'm not trying to call you stupid or anything of such sort, hell if I was brainwashed to believing something all my life, I'd believe it to! I'm just telling you to better educate yourself, which is a step most people refuse to take, because it requires work and a change of mind, a change in which they don't want to believe. Marijuana is less harmful then alcohol and cigarettes, have you ever drank before? If so, your just as guilty as him. Bet you didn't know that. Marijuana is less harmful then if you ate fast-food 4 or more times throughout the month, have you ever eaten fast-food for then 4 times a month? Then your just as guilty as him. Caffeine, a drug. Ever drank Starbucks? Think about it, the only difference is, your drugs are legal, and in your mind, "Ok to do..." because the government allows it. His are illegal, that's all. Don't believe people when they say it's a gateway drug that leads to heavier drugs, that is a lie. That is a choice people take not a Marijuana issue, smoking Marijuana is not addictive, that is a choice not a Marijuana issue. These are things you can learn by doing research. I have been smoking Marijuana for years, never touched another drug and I can quit whenever I want, (which I have, for 8 months, to get a job)... <br>  <br>  Its weed! Big deal? Let him smoke, I have a girlfriend, who does not smoke, has a child, and does not mind me smoking. Although, she will not let me smoke, until I get a job, I use to smoke 2 or 3 blunts a day, easy, when I did work just a year ago. Then I quit, so I could get a job, although I live in California and the job-hunting is scarce here. But, I have stayed clean for 8 months, just to get a job and respect her wishes. If he has a job, can support you, an wants to toke once in awhile, LET HIM!<br>  <br>  Stop being a b*tch, no offense. You act like it's Cocaine or Heroine! It's not an addictive drug, it has been proven that it has no addictive side-effects. It has also been proven that the government would like to legalize it, although cant, due to the fact they cannot tax it, or regulate it, like they could alcohol or cigarettes. Due to the fact that you can grow Marijuana easily in the comfort of your own home.<br>  <br>  It's not a big deal. Really. Stop tripping. You think it's horrible, because its a drug! Well, that's one persons word (the government) many people, smokers and non-smokers, disagree! Be more like my girlfriend, she is very responsible, mature, and knows the difference between what is right and wrong. Just because your government tells you it's wrong, doesn't make it wrong. If your government told you it's wrong to have more then 1 child, would that be right? No. Be a little brighter and educate yourself int he field of Cannabis before trying to ban it from your boyfriends existence. Everyone says that he will quit if he loves you, well... look at it another way, maybe you'll let him smoke it, if you love him? To be honest with you, sometimes, when me and my girlfriend fight (before I was unemployed) I use to go toke a bit, smoke a bowl or two, to relieve some stress and in a few hours, I'd be fine and I could talk to my girlfriend again, reasonably, no problems.<br>  <br>  Some people use Marijuana for different reasons. So don't judge him for doing it because its illegal. That's wrong. People need to open they're eyes and see the real picture here. Not to mention the fact that he can be making big money in selling that sh*t. You know how many people buy bud, over Cocaine or other drugs? It's the most profitable plant and drug int he entire world! Cocaine is worth more, but weed is sold more. Cocaine and other drugs, also known as "Narcotics" which weed is not a narcotic, which not many people know, contains addictive elements, that's why Heroine, PCP, Cocaine, Meth, etc. are all narcotics, and weed is just a drug. That is what separates the two meanings.<br>  <br>  If he buys an ounce of weed, (28 grams) for $200.00 he can make $550.00 (estimates) and profit $350.00, that's weekly. Now, do the math, in a month, he can make $1400.00, tax free, on top of what he already makes. Personally, if you want, ban him from selling drugs, because he can get caught unfortunately with this screwed up system and put in jail (depending on how much he has on him) usually police are lean with it and will let you go if you have an ounce or less, trust me, he shouldn't be carrying more then an ounce anyways. So, you can lose him if he sells, so ban him from selling if you want. But, don't ban him from smoking, that's just being uneducated. He lives in America, he has a right to smoke the reefer if he wants in the privacy away from the law. It's not harmful and it's not like he is smoking outside a building (like cigarette smokers) an giving kids and other people second-hand smoke which is more harmful then smoking in itself.<br>  <br>  Do the right thing. Talk to him. Explain to him why you don't want him selling, because you could potentially lose him due to it. But also let him know, your fine with him smoking weed. Although you don't want him doing it around you, if he wants to smoke it, do it away from your sight. But at the same time, tell him to be honest, if he see's you, he has to let you know he's been smoking, whether he's high or not, he has to let you know... "Look babe, I'm coming over in an hour an I smoked a bit ago, but I shouldn't be high anymore..." or "Hey babe, I'm coming over, I'm high right now, so just letting you know..." etc.|`|JZMfUDylaa	wow you drug test him what are you his mother? god i wouldn't date you if you were gonna be so stuck up no offense hun but weed isn't bad. however other drugs are very bad but not weed. if you don't believe me then i suggest you looking up this site: norml.com it tells you TRUE facts about pot. what you hear from the media is lies weather its about pot or anything else.  Tobacco and booze are dangerous and 10 times more dangerous than weed. ever heard of anyone over dosing on pot? nope not possible. God made weed man made booze so who do you trust more? anyways if your going to stay brainwashed from the govt. and it's lies than that's your problem not mine I'm just happy that I know the truth and not just the truth about weed but how messed up our govt. is too ok hope i knocked atleast a gram of sense into you lol!!|`|QCa4Pffqaa	Why would you want to break up with him? Mostly ALL guys will do weed. There's no way they wont want to try it atleast once in their life. But if he's really doing it alot AND lying to you about not doing it, then tell him that he NEEDS to stop if he still wants to be with you. If he really wants to be with you then maybe he'll stop. It'll take him a while to though so give it some time. Don't do anything stupid about it, because you never know, if not being with him is your best option.|`|wFN8bVqsaa	Why is breaking up with him not an option? He is CLEARLY lying to you. Noone smells that strongly of weed if they were just transporting it from place to place. And, there are countless ways to pass a marjiuana test, even if you have been smoking, so he could have done that early on. I say, he is lying to you and unless you want to be in a relationship that is a lie you either need to end it and move on, learn to live with his smoking weed, or make sure he stops lying to you.
AA12398373	Keep the texts, and voicemails for the police, they will need that as evidence. He made threats, and those can be made into charges against him.<br>  Those threats can also be supportive evidence for bringing assault charges from the choking incident.<br>  If you have any witnesses from that incident then he will likely be charged for that as well.<br>  <br>  I am not sure about the incident where he came around honking his horn, but that may fall under any anti-stalking laws that you have in the jurisdiction where you live. From your details it sounds like you have a witness for that as well. So he has built himself quite a fine package of trouble for himself.<br>  <br>  But look. A lot of police get very frustrated bringing charges in situations like this because it amounts to hours of paperwork for them, and then the couple end up kissing and making up, and then everyone ends up asking to have the charges dropped. Even if you live where you don't have the option of dropping the charges once they are put before the courts. Witnesses tend to clam up if the relationship takes a turn and the couple try a reconciliation.<br>  The cop you see today may be very reluctant to help you, may even seem like he's on your ex's side, but it may be for the very reason(s) I just gave here.<br>  <br>  If you are certain you are done with this guy, and want to send him a stern message to back off, then I highly recommend that you stick to your guns no matter what kind of feedback you get from the cops. Some are very sympathetic, and others can seem to be quite reluctant to work with victims of this type.<br>  But I think your ex boyfriend is a fledgling stalker, and if you can let him know you mean business, there's a huge probability that you can stop his terrorist tactics before he can take it any further.<br>  <br>  I have worked in the security business for almost 40 years, with a special interest in stalkers.<br>  I know what I am talking about.|`|YQ1Q7XeEaa	You need to get a restraining order and get the police involved.<br>  <br>  And you need to do it TODAY!|`|XNo8YGyfaa	call the cops. he just might mean it.|`|4lL6l0dFaa	Wow. That guy sounds like he has a problem. I think that he can get charged with harrassment, sending death threats, and physical assault. This is serious. Talk to a police officer about this. This guy deserves to go to jail.|`|tCmwFJn5aa	Save the text messages and the voicemails and turn it over to the police.  Do not take chance on him being a coward.  Cowards are actually dangerous.  CALL THE POLICE and TELL YOUR PARENTS!|`|562qoBUUaa	This guy is really scary. Anyone who makes these kind of threats is a psycho. Because he did physically attack you you need to keep your distance from him and probably get a restraining order for your safety. He probably won't get much for the abuse if you press charges. Maybe some time in the county jail and community service hours. That doesn't mean it's not worth it though. I would press charges. Definitely do not go near this guy again and take legal action (ie: restraining order) to protect yourself. He's completely unstable.|`|iVw14PRJaa	he has anger management ..angry thats why hes threatening you<br>  I did that to my ex and I regretted it. I told him i was going to burn his family and smash his car up....ahhhhhh wrong way of showing anger.<br>  <br>  you should tell him that you will get a restraining  order against him. Also let him know that hes showing the wrong type of anger, the type that will destroy any chance of even having a friendship.<br>  <br>  I guess he was pretty hurt by it. He'll get over it and learn his lesson one day I hope.|`|4HoVVCenaa	You should absolutely talk to the police. Let them decide how to handle it.|`|tao83sDxaa	look he is showing his true colors, he is a bully. nothing that you do or that your cousin does, give him an excuse to lay a hand on you. you need your dad to help you with this bully. i am so glad you are talking to the principal and the police. you may need to take an order of protection out against him, the police will tell you. don't answer any of his ways to get in touch with you. when you see him come up on your computer or voice mail press delete. if he is 18 i am sure charges could be brought against him. no way no how can he lay a hand on you. it might be a good thing to see if your dad could talk to his parents about his behavior towards you. i think he could by put in jail. he is showing his true colors, and you don't want anyone like that in your life. he isn't afraid to hit girls, he needs help and you need to stay away from him.

There is a reason why he may do such things and he needs to find that out on his own! Don't let anyone turn you into a victim. Make the first step and talk to someone. Someone at school or someone at the police station or a national help line. This may turn into an ugly legal battle and you need to make sure you are following the correct steps and doing this the right way. this will be difficult to come out about. make sure you understand that and that you are ready to take this head on. Be strong and know you are doing what is right. Im sorry honey. Take Control, you can do it!
mpGjPV6Xaa	Well, if you must know not all guys are open enough to approach a female, sometimes it has to be the other way around. Many guys are shy, because they are scared of rejection, therefore when a girl approaches a guy it's different. So, if you want a guy to date you, go where many attractive guys hang out like the mall, movies, party/club,etc... and look for a guy that you find attractive. If he's alone, you have a better chance with him, just don't give your hopes up and make a move. Also, make sure you always smell nice, dress decent, although many guys are perverted so decent isn't really nothing to them. Smile, be yourself, and do the best you can when talking to a guy. If he some how doesn't like you, then hell with him, there's always other guys out there. But, I honestly don't think that you will be rejected as long as you're respectful, not stuck up, sweet, and down to earth. Guys like girls with good personalities, open minds, funny, etc...<br>  <br>  So, I hope this helps you in getting a guy, I have faith in you. Just don't be afraid, you will see a guy that you like and a guy will like you. You have to be out to get noticed though. So, on weekends go places you know guys will be.<br>  <br>  Hope I help and gave you enough advice !<br>  <br>  Take care and good luck !!!<br>  <br>  Joseph D : )|`|dPULl5hjaa	Simple - ask him out !|`|Ql0gi4rVaa	lol<br>  unless you are extremely unattractive or smell<br>  all you have to do is ask a guy out<br>  any guy will date you<br>  guys are like that (unless they are married or with someone else already)<br>  they are like puppies pet them and they will wag their tail immediately<br>  its sorta sad<br>  <br>  be friendly dress nicely flirt|`|QCa4Pffqaa	start flirting with him. try hanging out with him too.|`|AA11535303	Give a sweet smile.Invite him with a good heart.He will come for sure.But make sure you select a good guy.

I would document every single time she comes around you and what is said. Eventually, if she persists, you can take all that to a judge and get a restraining order. Period! she sounds flaky and i wouldn't trust her at all. She sounds a bit unstable. Make sure you are NEVER EVER EVER alone with her dude. She will scream rape if so I am sure. Protect yourself now and always. Get an attorney if necessary dude. Take pictures or have someone else showing how she is always around you and get that restraining order. Cover your A*S*S*!|`|n2gEupY9aa	tell to your friends about your situation. try to meet one of her friends and also tell everything to them. after that ignore her. if she comes to your office then ignore. if she text you then delete it. everything she do just to get your attention IGNORE. if she accused you don't be afraid because all your friends know everything. you have your witnesses.<br>  <br>  JUST IGNORE HER..goodluck..|`|MXGFGBtZaa	You need to have a big old confrontation. Stand well back from her, be polite but firm and do not swear.

Have you told her how you feel? If you can, try to sit her down and be assertive with her. Again, if you feel threatened, tape record the conversation, that way you always have something to back you up if you should need it. If she cannot respect the way that you feel, I would definitely consider a restraining order. Good luck to you!!!|`|2qLhC7kBaa	I think you should tell her to leave you alone .....this is the best thing you can do.<br>  tell her that you don't like her but in a good way (don't  hurt her feelings)<br>  Good luck.|`|DnCpBjPDaa	You need to tell a higher authority so they can know what is going on.

wia9SXCPaa	You could ignore her but it doesn't sound like that has worked too well for you in the past.  If you work with her it can be a sticky situation with sexual harassment.  I once knew someone that reported a coworker only to be accused right back and then fired.  <br>  <br>  If it was me I guess I would ignore the texts and tell her you have a girlfriend and ask her kindly to just back off a bit.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|F4d89iRMaa	ignore her duh! she will eventually just go away.|`|TT2Pozpwaa	contact your company about sexual harrasment.  i'm sure that will get her to stop.|`|DNwHGeEtaa	Just ignore her. You can block her number on cell phone too if you want. Next time she comes to talk with you, just walk away. She clearly wants something. I guess it's not just that she likes you so much. She might have liked you a lot, but the fact that you rejected her makes her want you even more. I think this is not about her liking you, it's more about she wants to win you. Don't let her play this game. Just block her contact completely.|`|CCpUkt4Raa	well man it sounds like you do have a problem lol but it sounds like she really does want to be friends. i mean maybe the whole flirting thing is just for fun =/ maybe she does it to other guys too outside of work... telling her to f*** and die sounds a bit extreme (even if it is getting annoying). if you really want her to leave you alone, have you tried talking to her and letting her know instead of yelling and ignoring her. for some women they like it because they view it as a challenge so they continue with it. try reverse spychology on her too. she may like that you ignor her (kinda kinky in a wrong way lol) so go after her. if that doesnt work then yeah talk to her about how you feel (i recomend that first though)|`|O8TA4tMGaa	Continue to ignore her and report her for sexual harassment if she doesn't stop.  This woman clearly thinks "no" means "yes" and, unfortunately, if the nice or mean approach didn't work, you need to take this higher up.  Bottom line?  Don't be her friend.  You'll encourage her to keep trying to get what she wants from you if you do.  She sounds mentally unstable to me.
nBBeISEcaa	Just tell the guy that you kissed that you made a mistake and that you're sorry if you possibly led him on. Even though you feel that you're being mean to him it's okay because we all make mistakes, you just need to fix this one before it really gets out of hand. If he tries anything just tell him that you're involved with someone else and you apologize for the whole situation.|`|TzE60Bhtaa	If he keeps asking just tell him no and leave you alone|`|K71ZlPWgaa	say to this other lad, look I have a boyfriends and I am sorry you are a nice guy etc. But I really like him so I won't dump him, I am sorry|`|8YZoW8K7aa	Off the subject...are you from Liverpool?<br>  <br>  Go for who ever you like more.

iYc1HLmmaa	In making a long distance relationship work the first and most important thing you need to do is wanting to make it work and love that is strong enough to handle it. <br>  <br>  If you feel you have this and you really want to try the long distance thing then it is important to have complete trust in your partner and to be completely honest with them. Like any relationship trust and honesty are key factors to making it work, but when you are in a long distance relationship these two things become even more important. This because you are apart more often then you would probably be if you both lived in the same town. <br>  <br>  The other important thing to have in a long distance relationship is solid communication. It is so important not to keep your feelings bottled up inside of you because it will put strain on the relationship. If you tell your partner how you feel you guys will be better able to fix the issues and find ways to keep that issues from recurring.<br>  <br>  I know that long distance relationships are tough and they don't work for everyone. I do believe though that if you truly want it to work and have trust, honesty, and communication it can. My husband and I were in a long distance relationship for 4 years and things were always tough on us especially since there was a time we went a year without seeing each other. I believe that anyone who focuses on their partner during a long distance relationship will succeed, and having support around like family and friends really helps too. <br>  :]|`|lxB9UgCiaa	well its really hard to get through it me and ----------- almost broke up 3 differnt times andnow we are getting married! um but what we did whenever he got paid he would pay his bills n stuff and then save the rest of all of his check as money to come and see me we got phones on the same plan we talk txt eamail im send letters and he comes up to see me every chance he gets i live in north  carolina he lives in south carolina 10 to 12 hours away he could drive to georgia in like an hour but it worked because we didnt give up :)|`|p5SAQHzBaa	I'm in a long distance relationship too.

RPuZgfyZaa	Personality because although someone might be really attractive, they can be really vain (im not saying all attractive people have bad personalitys and im not saying all unattractive peopl have great personalitys) also i tend to look for people who have the same sort of personality as me. Looks catch attention, personality keeps it.|`|e98RKB35aa	Both because you have to have a good look and a good personality to click with someone.|`|W6NGihsSaa	personality it answers every thing in the end people get old personality don't|`|xgJbxZgfaa	both of course =)|`|iYc1HLmmaa	OK, looks may be the first thing some people pick up on, but no matter how dazzling the display there has to be something deeper to make a meaningful relationship.<br>  <br>  Regardless of your appearance, the most attractive thing you can offer others is the ability to relax and be yourself. If you're looking for more than just a friendship then think about the kind of signals you're giving out. It's basically about communicating your interests clearly.<br>  <br>  You don't have to leap on the person you like and hope they will respond in kind. Just focus on conveying your desire to take things further. It may not get you instant results, but it will cut down on those missed opportunities<br>  <br>  That's just my thoughts on it.<br>  :]|`|jbV0rH5vaa	personality.........reason? because looks are just a cover to be whatever you want deepdown if you can find a guy with a good personailty that you can talk to and open up to isnt that better then looks that are just makeup or in other words a cover to be a ***?|`|dbLsIkwcaa	its both cuz without looks u have a lower rate at getting a date. if u want it to be a sucesful relationship personality comes in.|`|RoFfCYGxaa	Ideally both.  But I'd be willing to give a little on looks for an awesome personality.|`|gZDSWgmPaa	looks because if the personality doesn't get better after the stabbing its on to the next|`|2V7HRd7Vaa	preferrably both.<br>  but then personality. you don't wanna be stuck with a jerk|`|6febee8b4757d9cd4857176f7b29c818aa	Both because it would be difficult to live without either of it.|`|UhWQuxLVaa	Both! but looks first ofcourse!|`|iqh2iDknaa	I am not going to lie- I think looks are really important in the beginning, but you need the personality to keep a relationship going. So basically if you can somehow know a person long enough you can get away with looking like whatever as long as you have a stellar personality.|`|bE0KxI9Xaa	I say personality because looks don't always matter. If the person makes you happy then, that is okay. But if the person is hot but has a terrible personality, it's not worth it. So, looks don't always matter, i would go with personality.|`|InddlGisaa	looks for now, personality for later when it matters lol|`|E0KhrgnSaa	both.|`|NRldAzrpaa	Everyone will prob say personality, but in real life personality doesnt matter as much. I would like to say personality, but if im being totally honest then, Looks.|`|slJlLGMVaa	Personality because I've met a lot of cute guys who were just annoying and a lot of non-cute guys who were really sweet ;D
kGBli717aa	Everyone has different way of expressing themselves. Be flattered no matter how someone tells you that you are cute! Be happy that you are! Don't forget, beauty (and cuteness) is fleeting, unfortunately.
8XKmMBU7aa	Every liar says, I need really help.<br>  So my suggestion for you. Please bow your head on her foot and suck it hard until she will say you yes.<br>  <br>  have a nice day and nice dream.|`|ew3Wl6hKaa	yes ur friend does have a problem, i would suggest talking with a guidance councillor about her ( u don't have to mention names) just tell them ur worried about ur friend she likes this teacher etc etc.. she might get really really depressed and try to do something to herself if she doesn't get help.|`|gqvvXknQaa	Sounds like she has a hard core crush on him. I'm sure she'll get past him in time. Maybe introduce her to some boys in your school to keep her mind off the teacher.|`|Hm0bCjYFaa	Let her read your question here.|`|i8LbFRbSaa	Get her a boyfriend... Its probably the only way to take her mind of it.|`|6SP9YvDzaa	i have been in your friends situation and its crazy how much you can love someone without even knowing them. Its all the more attractive, because its forbidden love, and she know she cant have him. <br>  but she does need to realize that fantasizing/obsessing over a teacher is leading nowhere. The best thing to do, is when she starts to think about him, she must immediately think of something else. I know this isnt easy, because its fun to fantasize over someone.  She needs to start living in the real world, to put it bluntly. <br>  all you can do is be there for her.<br>  best of luck!!!
tXo62R8Naa	if you are not talking to her then no... you don't have a chance. just say hello and everything will flow|`|Hxn5nAf9aa	Definately - Anything is possible!<br>  Just go for it, theres a chance she might be into you. :)|`|i3pn4jNcaa	she seems like a loner type and i think she likes it that way. but who knows maybe you can break her out of that shell.|`|q3cbuc3Eaa	sex is for...married people.
8XKmMBU7aa	baby brilliant.<br>  Please you are really great.<br>  I like you.<br>  <br>  have a nice day and nice dream.|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	Why do you care if someone likes you or not ? get your friend to ask for you.|`|SbiNNM3Caa	ok<br>  i dont think thats the best way to do it<br>  but just say<br>  'hey dude...how are you today?...so i heard you kinda like me is that true?'<br>  and then if yes keep it up<br>  if no end it<br>  i really think u shoudl just be 'real' about it and ask them seriously on msn<br>  or face to face which is seemingly embarassing but hey the truth s kool<br>  that reason and they might not confess over msn<br>  good luck|`|2V7HRd7Vaa	just ask them who they like..<br>  good luck! :]|`|z2QYSFlvaa	dont worry, be happy|`|ZkFfzDXlaa	huh???? wait... what?!!!!<br>  i dont get this question<br>  srry..|`|6TZZJepkaa	just say you fancy me<br>  <br>  answer me <br>  <a href="http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090223100312AA2CL6H&r=w">http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|cPPB3B4gaa	just ask!
FhHkT0bBaa	When it comes down to it,you just have to explain to him that your not best friends,that you don't mind him spending time at your house with your child,but that doesn't mean its as if he were family,set boundaries and stick to them.As adults you should be able to work this out since you've done so well so far,but it also sounds like hes pushing the envelope a little,which is not acceptable. At 8 your daughter is more aware than you think,sit her down and explain that your not totally comfortable with the way things are,explain why,she will understand more than you think.Either way,you have to take your current hubby's feelings into consideration as well,it may not be easy at first,but in the long run everyone will feel better setting parameters instead of letting resentments fester and come to a head.|`|1235333b4f34f1147fc81bf4aef8885baa	You have to decide whether a little rudeness is worth the benefits you receive from having dad over during his visitation.<br>  <br>  As far as him using your microwave, not a big deal.  Is he really planning to crash your family dinner or is he, for example, just coming over after work?  He's probably hungry and it would be awkward to stand there waiting while other people eat their dinner in front of you.  My mother always taught me to feed my guests, even if they're not overly welcomed guests.  It's just good manners.<br>  <br>  Does he have vistation outside of coming over to your house?  If he does, but it's limited, or if he doesn't at all, he's probably bringing the girlfriend over because he wants them to meet and spend time together.  Maybe he's planning on marrying the girl and doesn't want to blindside his mother with a stepmother she's never met.  Fair enough, especially if they're not spending time together outside of this.<br>  <br>  If coming over to your house is just part of a bigger visitation plan, I think I would just try to make these visits more slight until they fade away.  When he asks to come over, just explain that you already have plans that night, but if he wanted to (for example) take her out to a movie on Friday that that would be fine with you.  Of course, this presumes that having the ability to be a fly on the wall is of less importance to you than not being inconvenienced regularly by unwanted visitors.<br>  <br>  You are definitely in danger of your daughter seeing you as the bad guy.  You are, in a sense, the bad guy.  You're the one changing the rules that everyone has gotten used to.  The only way to avoid a backlash is by offering a more positive alternative.<br>  <br>  It seems to me that you're struggling with some control issues here.  I think you need to ask yourself if the things your ex has done that seem rude to you are really a big deal or if you have just come to resent his continued presence in your life after all these years.  It's probably time to stop trying to control your daughter's visitation with her dad.|`|6d3d506f71ae558ee917c76931cf6a23aa	Sounds like you want to control the situation at all points. You don't mention why he doesn't have at his place for visits. But I would consider talking to him about that and to not make himself so familiar with your house. Set some guide lines for him when he does visit and explain to your daughter.|`|AA10500537	speak to him and tell him its inappropriate  and you want it to stop.<br>  he is taking advantage of the whole situation .<br>  let him take the child to his place or spend a day at the park|`|x80SgAlPaa	Ask your daughter how she feels about the situation. Explain it to her first before you talk with her dad. It's the best way to avoid coming off as monsters is to do that first. If she's 8 she will be able to understand that you are not shutting the door on her dad...also, it will teach her that rude behavior is not acceptable. <br>  <br>  After youve talked with her, have a conversation with her dad while she is there. she is a part of the family and should be involved. The girlfriend is not a part of the family as should not be included unless he requests it. <br>  <br>  Just remember, keep to the key points (1)It is rude behavior to do things like inviting people over/coming over without asking. (2)You still want him to be involved in your daughter's life.<br>  <br>  Avoid going off on tangents, such as his parenting style or his girlfriend; because, they can throw a wrench in your main point.|`|H2VxdK44aa	just sit him down and be straight forward with him, tell him that it is your house and if he wants to bring a guest, he needs to ask first. also say that he is not welcome for dinner unless he is invited. and say that if you feel he needs a drink or a snack, you will offer him one yourself, but explain that you like having him come over to visit his daughter, but he needs to respect his surroundings more.|`|Y9gy11rsaa	Firstly, congrats on keeping a good relationship for the sake of your daughter - that goes for your husband too! Well done!<br>  <br>  I think your ex probably doesn't realise that what he's doing is wrong.  Firstly, unless he's in a committed relationship he shouldn't be introducing random "dates" to your daughter.  It will only confuse her.  Is there a reason he cannot have visitation at his own home?  I know you feel better about being able to keep eyes and ears out for problems but is this really necessary?  After all he is her father... I don't think there's any nice way of explaining all of this to him - you have to be direct, although be kind and gentle as well.  If his relationship isn't great with your new hubby then maybe it's a conversation you have to have with your ex alone - you don't want to alienate him but he has to know what acceptable behaviour is...<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|bb06GQ5Paa	Well, you and your husband should be commended for being so grown up in this situation.  Now, only if that was contagious.  I can understand your dilemma.  On the one hand, you don't want to jeopardize your daughter's relationship with her father and on the other hand, you have a right to some privacy and time to yourself in your home by yourself.  What is his designated time to come over?  Maybe you can restrict that somehow by saying that you and your husband need time to be with our family without any outside interference.  And besides that, having company over during the week is too stressful with everything going on.
imziSPonaa	If you are going to break up with him, it's better to get it over with now and not wait.|`|64b71311b453645560ceb49d58250d08aa	just tell him how you feel next time you talk to him.|`|mtOVRAnbaa	If your serious about him then WAIT.. it'd be nice for both of you to have someone to write to and have that connection with. Especially since you are both marines! If you DONT wanna be with him... let him know easily.. He's a marine.. Im sure he wont have trouble finding another women..|`|yM8NiXmLaa	You should give him a nice long hug and tell him goodbye and then you tell him good luck and to be safe. That would be very nice of you and he will still not feel as bad about himself.|`|OyWVqe23aa	you are a *****. dont break up.
JtQvOLqkaa	It's just hormones.|`|NXA4fJbTaa	how would you know that she is always wet?? <br>  is your hand permenantly down there? loool|`|4293T0LNaa	u must be good, lol<br>  <br>  ummm idk, that is kinda wierd, 5 days? maybe its just vaginal discharge??|`|zJTJTPyMaa	shes ready for more bro lol

AA11777322	Well the fact that he keeps doing it says that he enjoys it.  Now what you need to do is figure out if you are over reacting to this or is he breaking the deal between the two of you.  If he is not crossing the line with this person then you should be cool.  Hey learn what she is doing and do it to him for yourself.  That way he won' t go looking for things he already has at home.|`|76nTvO4iaa	If you haven't ever had a professional massage, I recommend that you try one.  They ARE nice and you feel relaxed and energized after you're finished.<br>  <br>  Next time....ask her to give YOU a massage after she's finished with your fiancee.  It will be interesting to see if she's really into the healing arts or just putting the moves on guys, specifically YOUR guy.<br>  <br>  If she refuses, find a hot guy to give you a massage.|`|5e66f381627bd428c703e558425a21ceaa	i am a massage therapist. <br>  <br>  it is not sexual. some people are perverted, but a lot of us are out there really trying to help people heal from injuries, relax, and detoxify. <br>  <br>  if you are jealous why dont you start getting massages from another man? then you will understand what it is all about. <br>  <br>  its really not perverted or based on attraction. its wonderful! give it a try treat yourself. it will help with pre-wedding stress. <br>  <br>  now if she works at one of those special massage parlors or iss not licensed then perhaps you should tell him to go to a legit place. <br>  <br>  good luck, i know it can seem like a threat. i think once you get a massage you will see that it is not that way. i rub guys all the time and would never want to be with them in any way.|`|JtEBaOdjaa	Did he go to a professional and get a massage by someone licensed?  I don't see a problem with it.<br>  If it's someone at work who he's taking his shirt off and getting massaged from, then that's a little worry-some<br>  <br>  edit: ask him to invite her over and give you a massage.  Then you can get a feel for who she is. But hun, if its on the up and up you need to get over your jealousy.  If my fiance wants to go get a professional massage I couldn't care less if it's a 19 year old blonde bimbo with huge boobs or an 80 year old man.  It's a professional relationship.|`|q8eue7CRaa	What's the situation of these massages? How does she act when she's doing the massage? Boundaries need to be set here. If he does indeed love the massage, he should think about going to a masseuse he doesn't know. I think it can get risky if they are both enjoying it and could turn into something else. I'd be careful!|`|iVnQ4aCiaa	If she is a professional that is licensed and legit you have no business saying anything to him about it. <br>  If she is shady and is giving out happy endings, then that is wrong.|`|putV0uopaa	on one hand he should respect your feelings and stop doing things to upset you. on the other hand he is allowed to talk to other girls and even enjoy it. As long as he isn't going out and cheating on you there should be no problem. If you are marrying this guy then you need to learn to trust him and respect his boundaries.|`|rpVQpJA7aa	I would explain that he has commited to spending his life with you, and not that other girl. Tell him that if he isn't ready to commit to you, you are calling off the wedding because what he is doing is really hurting you, and you aren't happy. If he truly loves you, he should want you to be happy!|`|mkrKHQvFaa	Is he paying for these massages or is some random girl just giving them to him.  If he is paying for them and it is professional you are being too insecure.  If some random girl is giving them to him then he is crossing a line and being very disrespectful!|`|X5aMV1Pmaa	If she is a professional, then I think this is fine.  If she is just a friend who enjoys giving massage, that's a problem.  Find out for sure.
MAABo1zKaa	she likes you.|`|ew3Wl6hKaa	she likes u, and gets nervous talking to u (hence the no eye contact and can't stay still) and when she sees u ignoring her she has to "prove" she can have any guys she wants so u better ask her out before another guy does.........that's how girls thing!!|`|6UmRmaeWaa	your the man....she's into you.

sVNWdW50aa	I would stick with the plum as the main color and accent with gold. There are lots of gorgeous flowers that would work. It's not too unusual a color, so you should be able to find lots of decorations and favors in that shade. Rather than alternating dress colors, you could go someplace inexpensive like Davids Bridal. Each girl could have a different dress in the same plum shade and use gold accents for sashes and shoes.|`|0jUGSaZPaa	I like the idea of the alternating, but maybe have your MOH in gold with a purple sash and the other 3 BM's wear purple with a gold sash.<br>  <br>  Other ways to decorate the reception:<br>  Have gold table clothes and purple sashes/napkins, etc.<br>  <br>  For flowers:<br>  Think purple roses...  They are so gorgeous.  You should add some gold branches in the mix of the bouquets... Really unique.<br>  <br>  Centerpieces:<br>  You can use the purple roses again, or just do tall vases with gold branches sticking out..<br>  <a href="http://www.elizabethannedesigns.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/pink-branch-centerpieces.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.elizabethannedesigns.com/blog...</a><br>  <br>  Groomsmen should wear purple vests, or have them alternate just like the girls.<br>  <br>  Here's some other ideas:<br>  <a href="http://www.pinkcakebox.com/images/cake730.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkcakebox.com/images/cake73...</a>  I thought this was a cute cake, and maybe you can have a masquerade ball?

I'm from Louisiana and am a huge LSU fan.  Purple and Gold are their colors.  So just make sure you're not from a place where the big college team is a rival or you might get picked on... lol.  But they are pretty colors.  I would use maybe one main flower in gold and use purple wild flowers as accents.  For the cake, you could do a layered cake with a soft gold fondant and then have purple (plum) ribbon fondant trimming each layer.  <br>  Canterpieces- Gold Candles with purple flowers scatteded around it.|`|js3M1vgEaa	OMG!! Great colors! Our wedding is planned for June this year and we are going with the Eggplant and Gold accents. For the dresses we went with Aldred Angelo and I let the girl each choose thier dress, and this was great becasue so many dresses came in these colors! Beautiful flowers are in the purple tones are the Hydrangeas, Flox, Roses and Sweet Pea. Candles are always beautiful for centerpieces and inexpensive!|`|iVnQ4aCiaa	The only advice that I have for you is to find the color of purple that you want and then use a swatch of it to match every single little purple thing in the wedding.  I got married last fall and had Royal Purple and Copper and the purple was a nightmare to match.  It can be done but carry the correct color with you no matter what!|`|rpVQpJA7aa	I think that sounds gorgeous, only maybe use gold as your accent color. Too much of it can make it look like a "50th/golden anniversary celebration". Maybe do plum dresses with a gold sash!
AW1dCzH0aa	I think that the Emily Post wedding planner is amazing.  She's got all kinds of great etiquette advice as well.  I have her etiquette book and I thinks its very navigable.  :)  I also really really really liked the Martha Stewart Weddings website and magazine.  Totally worth taking a look at!|`|0jUGSaZPaa	I'm not even joking here when I say this.. But my FMIL just got me "Weddings for Dummies".. It's a pocket edition.. I'm sure she got it in Target's $1 section, but it's great!!  Really helpful on tips, and determining what you want, etc.|`|lWfCL3Q4aa	One fantastic read that I recommend to all brides is Rebecca Mead's One Perfect Day. This is not a wedding planning book, but it's a MUST READ for all brides. It tears back the curtain from the wedding industry and gives you a glimpse inside the big, white wedding machine. A machine that ain’t so pretty. It will open your eyes.<br>  <br>  Another book is Intimate Weddings: Planning a Small Wedding that Fits Your Budget and Style which also has a website <a href="http://www.intimateweddings.com/blog/" rel="nofollow">http://www.intimateweddings.com/blog/</a>|`|JtEBaOdjaa	I have one that's a binder style from Chapters. It's called "tying the Knot".  It's great, it has tips and ideas and also doubles as an organizer.  There is a place for all of your information, without it, I'd be an unorganized mess! lol<br>  Chapters actually has about 10 versions of this, priced between $20 and $50.  Go check them out and see which one fits your needs best.|`|X5aMV1Pmaa	The ones by Martha Stewart are very nice.
8sJQP3Y4aa	You can obtain the marriage license at the Fulton County Probate court and get married there also.  Getting the license alone does not make you married.  But their will be judges there to perform the ceremony. See the website listed below.  Congratulations and good luck to you|`|js3M1vgEaa	That's about it! Once you get the license you can be married on site. Congrats!!
qlepHpX0aa	I don't think your over reacting, I think he disrespected you by doing that then again for lying about it.  I think that he got mad cause he knew he did something wrong and you called him on it.  Weather he did more that night or any night he goes out, you both need to sit down and talk about the situation because it's not fair to you to feel uncomfortable every time he goes out, and feel like you can't trust him. If he is not understanding about you wanting to talk about it or if he doesn't seem concerned then you should consider if you want to stay with someone like that.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|vUAfLHxiaa	Your not overreacting.  You let your boyfriend go out with his friends and he took away your trust in him.  He had no right to get angry at you about it either.   I would say that if he doesn't change up his act then you should get rid of him.|`|uNbsSLcbaa	I dont think you are over reacting. i mean your bf didnt even mention that he had a wild night and slept with this best friend's roommates, he wasnt even planning on telling u!! what an ***!! it will take time for you to trust your boyfriend again. u should confront him and tell him this is bothering you. but also tell him that she doesnt mind him hanging out with his friends but just not having sex with other people. especially when he's drunk! <br>  <br>  Good Luck with your decision..|`|CEqYjcBeaa	First off, if he is getting mad at you that generally isnt a good sign. He is in defense mode because he was caught doing something he told you he wouldnt do...in not so many words. You have a right to be mad, it would have been one thing had he told you about it, but he kept it from you. It's really up to you on how much you truly trust him as to wether or not to just drop it. But the simple fact is that he lied to you and is deffensive because he was caught which would make me wonder what else he might be hiding since he was mad at you for it. You have to make a judgement based on how much you feel for him and truly trust him. If you think something happened, then chances are it did. Good luck!
el8yX5q3aa	You sound very young....and should not be doing this on the internet.  I would be very concerned about you if I was your mother.  <br>  <br>  WOW...why not just invite pervs into your home. <br>  <br>  Concentrate on spelling and sentence structure honey..it will be more valuable in the long run.|`|AjBpAPpdaa	aww sure, but you live very far away i'm guessing, all the way in america ):|`|bx2saJjUaa	ok
e6ao6QiHaa	You're both adults. Hopefully she'll keep that in mind. You said you both like each other, so the difference shouldn't matter to her.|`|tjFcfI9Aaa	there is nothing wrong with an age gap as long as you both like each other it shouldn't matter remember age is nothing but a number..hope this helps and good luck!|`|CI6m0L0Zaa	I am 23 and my ex and I dated for a long time. He was 32 and I was 21 when we first started seeing eachother. We got along great and never had any problems due to our age gap. Were still very close even though we didnt work out. I don't think age is an issue as long as both people are equally mature.|`|wggQRDb2aa	man , you are grown adults. once you pass 18 it is all fair game. it will depend from person to person.
7465ac9a7d2ba579932941bf1ef1a071aa	Sounds like he is trying to be controlling, don't allow that, or else it is time to move on. If he can't trust you, or you allow him to have reasons on why he shouldn't trust you then there will always be that problem, it will never go away no matter how hard you try. I'd explain to him that you are just friends with this guy, and nothing more and if he can't give you the respect to trust you then maybe this relationship isn't working out. I care about you deeply and you should know this and I'd never do something to jeopardize our relationship, but that doesn't mean I cannot be friends with this other guy.|`|YFXusnT1aa	Too protective I dated a girl like that it drove me insane.|`|AA11798469	You seem to be collecting guys that want to control you. Is that really something you want? Perhaps you should just date without the formal bf/gf thing until you find someone who is confident and stable enough to deal with you being you. Your right to assert yourself with your boyfriend but I have to say that his type almost never gives up the unreasoned jealousy so you might need to opt for your freedom.|`|3b439d9a67a6c2ad214cd95b7a1343b5aa	Your boyfriend is being a bit overprotective, but you also have to see his point. The friend you have is also an ex, which means at some point, there was an emotional and romantic attraction there for both of you. For most people, that would indeed present a concern and a legitimate one. If you liked the friend once, what's to stop it from happening again? So in that way, you have to see his point.<br>  <br>  However, he does not have the right to dictate your friends, nor you his. He has no real reason not to trust you or the friend and his jealousy is a sign of insecurity on his part. Sitting down with your boyfriend and being upfront with him might calm things down for you. Letting him know that it's him that you care about, that you're with, and not the other, might be helpful. Basically, reassuring him of your attention. He also has to understand that he CANNOT tell you who you can talk to or not and trying to do so is childish and ridiculous, especially when you don't do the same. It's true, the two of you are not married and he's going to have to get okay with your friend. When you talk to him, ask him what his concerns are and why he's so jealous. If he gives good reasons, address them but if he can't give you real reasons and be honest with you, then you have to ask yourself if you can deal with his jealousy.<br>  <br>  I've been in a similar situation, so I understand what you're going through. For me, I don't tolerate jealousy in my partners. I have A LOT of guy friends and any man who deals with me has to accept that or move on. I'm not dropping my friends for him. End of story.<br>  <br>  Good luck with it.
XdVjZ2ytaa	This is a tough situation, so this is what I would do if in your shoes. Don't move in with him. If you are not ready, you will eventually resnt the fact that you felt forced into the situation. Yes it is hard for him to have to drive to see your daughter, but he knew you were pregnant when he rented his place, and he should have made a better effort to move somewhere closer to you. He didn't have to move all the way to your town, but could have moved part of the way to make the drive shorter. When you have a child you need your family and friends as a strong support system for you and your child. I have two kids of my own and would have died without my mother! I don't think you should neccessairly wait until you are maried however becasue you never "really" know someone until you have lived with them. If you try living with him for a bit before you are married you get a day to day feel for how he lives. And you will be under enough pressure as it is as a new mother and a new bride, much less trying to fold yourself into his world at that point.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|eS9nPWqBaa	Well you're already pregnant so you might as well move in.|`|gLXzVbm8aa	why would you wait until you are married if you already slept with him?|`|4EWCegiRaa	You're already pregnant, might as well just move in.|`|2Q2ltt1Saa	Living together with someone is totally different than just seeing them, even if it's an every-night visit; there's just general "at home" behaviours that you don't get as much of and can get away from when they have to go home, vs. when you're in the home with them.<br>  <br>  Learning this now will help make it easier when the baby comes; you'll at least startto be acclimated to the first situation before it changes, vs. two major changes at once.<br>  <br>  The fact he went and did this without your consent and used all your savings, however, is doesn't bode well for the relationship.  If he did this now, what's to keep him from putting you further in debt by buying something else he thinks is appropriate, without your knowledge?  (New car, for example.)<br>  <br>  Moving in before you're married is just a religious holdover that I don't even understand in the slightest- you've obviously been doing the main thing religion doesn't want you to do before marriage anyway.  (If it's because of other worries, i.e., abuse or he's a "bad" guy, that's more reason not to move in.)<br>  <br>  I think he already sealed the deal to watch out and be as cautious as possible with the way he's acted.thus far.  Losing your family's support would make things more difficult, but that's part of going through life.  Given the situation, his actions, etc., though, I'd pick family support over his choices.  <br>  <br>  He should be able to cancel the lease within a certain period of time, and should do so until you're both financially ready- even if that's not a tthe time of the wedding.  (My sister and her husband married and stayed with my parents for 8 months to finish school loan repayments and save up enough to have an emergency savings account.)|`|rvA9BXehaa	I think you have excellent reasons for staying put. You have a support network and I assume a doctor all ready to go for your delivery, and the time immediately after the birth. I don't think now is the time to move as a result.<br>  <br>  Getting knocked-up by this dude is neither a reason to live with him or a reason to get married. However, if you love him and want to be wed, then waiting until after the delivery is fine. Plus, you have the time between now and then to make plans.<br>  <br>  Do not be negative with him about his renting the trailer. He did what human males have always done for their mates. He found shelter. You should thank him. Men need those pats on the back.|`|GEcnLggxaa	First n foremost congrats... Pls get married to make evryone happy.. Thats the only way.. Afterwards u can ask ur parents help financially if the money ur fiancee is earning is not enough, till he gets a good job... U have taken a decision to give birth to a child without marriage then u will have to take up the responsibility of the kid together... Its better u move to ur fiancee's place after u get married only.. Dont go now, its risky... Take ur parents support for some time..Ask ur mom to be with u for few months after u give birth to a baby.. that is what everone does.. Parents are needed but Husband is a must.. Not Fiancee..Be Strong.. Get married to ur Fiancee as soon as possible...TC..All The Best...

It doesn't actually mean she wants to, she was probably just curious. I have wondered too. I really don't think she will follow through with it. At least she was open an honest about it and said what she thought.|`|1cb3542838b379bb2f5a7c25c04d579baa	I don't think you have to worry.  Fantasies are a healthy part of an individual's sex life.  If you are concerned, though, you should talk to your wife. <br>  Some women tell their significant other their fantasies as a way of feeling closer to them.|`|3xuJI78Zaa	I'm sure she's just curious. <br>  I mean everyone's at least a little curious.<br>  And if they say they aren't there lying.
zJTJTPyMaa	keep doing all those things your doing good lol<br>   <br>  i think shes now looking for the for intimate parts of the relationship.. im not talking about just grabbing her either haha im talking about finding some reason to put your arm around her or put your hand on her hip. or even hand on her leg or stomach.  Nothing really too forward until your alone then handle that by yourself but the important thing is be a gentleman about it but basically id say find someone to playfully touch her more of a gentler version of flirty then she'll know your really interested

HrDcaocMaa	Honey, in today's world you always have to be in check with your man.  Even having a ring on the finger means diddley-squat!  Tell him how you feel about the recent talks with the Ex's lately - and ask him point blank if there's a reason why he feels the need to talk with them.. Should you be concerned with getting an STD, is one of them pregnant, etc...?  Sorry to put the thoughts in your head - but honestly, "Ex's" are ex's for a reason and should remain that way ALWAYS... Think: Pandora's Box|`|VUNfI7yBaa	It is NOT ok for him to be talking to them at all.|`|ew3Wl6hKaa	I'd be worried!! I'd start hanging out with all my guy friends and mentioning them in conversation to see how he would react if he gets jealouse than u can just say "but u talk with ur ex's, he's just a friend" etc etc|`|i3pn4jNcaa	it depends on the girl really. and how long theyve been broken up for. i allow my boyfriend to talk to his ex. she was his only other gf and they went out for a yr but im pretty cool with her and i know she wouldnt try anything. so it dosent bother me. you need to do some research on them|`|6oMF0EIpaa	That’s where trust comes in… If he says their friends and he doesn’t hide anything from you then sure they’re just friends… just don’t let your guard down to easy… make sure he’s acknowledges you when he’s talking to these exs… Don’t let him go with them with out you there…and if he introduces you to them as you being his girlfriend then its all good… if he cares bout you he wont hide anything… just be aware…Just make sure he dont hide anything from you ever...|`|ablriuUVaa	yes its normal<br>  if u to broke up wouldnt u still want to talk to him?<br>  <br>  well its the same way for him.|`|CqTmbIYPaa	ya its cool for them to talk you just need to trust him and they can just be Friends im like that with my ex|`|Lq7dFeJAaa	It is a dangerous soup he's cooking.  Some people just need the temptation and the right moment to stray, especially if the exs want him back.  I hope he isn't going on dates with them.  Ask if he would feel comfortable with you talking to your ex boyfriends.  You could tell him you value your relationship and you feel hurt when he talks to girls he has a romantic history with.  If he blows you off then I would reconsider him as a bf.  Just think how much more he'll blow off your feelings and serve his own in the future.  Also I would call ex boyfriends and do exactly what he is doing.  Maybe he'll see how it really feels.  Definitely don't stop worrying.  This is a red flag.|`|Ebexkggoaa	I wouldnt really trust him. I was going through the same situation, last boyfriend was always talking to his ex. At first I thought it was no problem, but then he was kind of being flirty. A few days later we broke up and right away he asked his ex out. I dumped him because he was always talking to her, while he kept going back to me saying he loves me. I honestly hate guys, i mean i dont take second chances because guys seem to never change. && to answer your question i think you should be aware of what hes talking about and how he talks to her. Dont try to be nosey because he might become annoyed. Im not really the jealous type but just let him know how much it bothers you. I never told my ex that it bothered me, i just let it go & i should of reacted. Try to get more of his attention, if he's the type who starts flirting then there might be something going on. I know how guys are!! If he's just cool with them, then you shouldnt be worrying. :)|`|a35TstUEaa	I dont know your situation but I would say dont stress it until they are like hanging out alone or sneaking around on  the phone then its time to worry. I have many of my ex's that are still really good friends of mine I have never really had a bad break up so maybe hes the same day, Me and my husband use to hang out with his ex gf but then again she was in a relaionship with his best friend so it was maybe no big deal. If it bother you sit down and talk to him.|`|kqxddLNoaa	There is nothing to worry about. I go through the same thing. I hate my boyfriend talking to his exs and i seem to hate them to. They're most probably just friends. If you love him and trust him then believe him. And just love the fact that he's yours now and they've lost out.=]|`|TQSov8K3aa	No you should definitely  worry about him talkin to you exes i mean the only reason he would be talkin  to them is because he is planin on leavin you if you really think about it|`|aZ1ZxTNvaa	eh idk? <br>  it just depends on what hes talking about with them?|`|gVMmdeLcaa	hell NO is it okay 4 ur bf to talk to his exes|`|AsLPNP4daa	hi's talking bout his ex because he already forgets them... and it will be okay for him opening a topic bout his ex's|`|lgUJBdhTaa	no need to worry. they could be just friends.
pRF5LLloaa	You are getting played.  HE knows that the most important thing HE can say is "i love you".  it keeps you hangin' around, so that he can "use" you when and if he see fit.<br>  <br>  Obviously, if he's looking around at dating websites, he's NOT interested in your for anything much longer than one night at a time.<br>  <br>  AND -- he has a record as a "cheater".<br>  <br>  I've got to wonder why YOU have such a poor opinion of yourself that you think you have to put up with this shtuff!<br>  <br>  Dump him now, get some self-respect, and find a man who will treat you as you deserve to be treated, and as exclusively.|`|gVMmdeLcaa	dnt trust him... u can do better! I really dnt understand ppl that cheat... but seriously if he did it to his previous gf, he'll do it to you most likely. he probably told her he loved her too...|`|SsEN9KRqaa	as a guy i think you need to be careful of what he is doing he might mean it he might not... i never cheated on any of my partners but i would be extremely careful about what he is doing|`|dbLsIkwcaa	guys dont go on dating websites to make friends. hes probly cheating. once a cheater always a cheater|`|Swy5L6Mgaa	There are 2 things I'd say here: <br>  1. the best way to predict future behavior is to look at past behavior: if he cheated before, chances are he will again.<br>  2. if a person has a reason strong enough, things at no1 can change; but if your guy is on dating websites and you don't feel like he's totally committed to you and you alone, you are not a reason strong enough for him to change; he may want to have you available, but this doesn't sound like Love. The "only friends with the women" part it's just an excuse, and a very lame one.<br>  Walk out with dignity and give a chance to a better someone else! <br>  Anna Presso
mWkpqtL3aa	It sounds like she is indeed a bit interested, but most likely she's being very frank with you... she doesn't like putting labels on anything, so it leaves things open to happen as they come.  If you put the label of "dating" on a relationship too soon, it could lead to disaster... having a very close friendship to begin with, flirting and being personal, without the "girlfriend/boyfriend" labels make some girls a lot more comfortable than the pressure of knowing that they've just jumped into a relationship that they may not be fully ready for.  I know, because I've been there.<br>  <br>  Take your time, patience is a virtue when it comes to relationships.  Trust me, I know how hard it is to wait around and see what happens... I'm the most inpatient person I know!!  However, I do believe, from another female's perspective, that she is interested, otherwise she wouldn't be reciprocating as much as she is in your offers to hang out.  No one has text conversations for hours on end with someone they don't have some type of interest in, ya know what I'm saying?  <br>  <br>  As for what to do to "take things further," just take it slow.  It may be a little nerve wracking, but if you let things happen as they come, the relationship will be much more magical and special than if you rush into labeling things too soon.  She may have had some past relationships where things moved too fast, plus she's being realistic with the fact that her friends and education come before a boyfriend... because the truth is, boyfriends come and go sometimes and friends and her education should come first.  That sounds like a very realistic and respectable quality to have in a girlfriend if things go that way, so good luck!|`|iSKsSJ3Baa	tell her straight up, do you like me?|`|UlXwRYFyaa	honestly, and i'm being blunt sounds like shes playing you. i've been there, did it to a sweet guy, eventually i gave in because he kept trying hard for me. don't give up, i'm now completly inlove with my boyfriend who ive been with for a year and a half. girls have too many guys so its sometimes hard for the good ones to be noticed. just try hard, even tho she may play it all down keep it going. show her you care. it WILL turn into something more, much more. just don't give up|`|AA11119636	what do you mean playing hard to get??....you haven't make your move yet<br>  <br>  she's interested already...that's why she goes out with you, flirt with you, touch you, and txt you...<br>  <br>  ou need to make your move so she'll know you are intrested in her and be more firm yes...<br>  <br>  ask her out on a proper date...then kiss her at the end of the night<br>  this will show her you want to take things to the next level

If this is a "deal breaker", you don't care about her and you should re-evaluate how you view life and the people in it.<br>  <br>  PS-  Maybe she's not wet because you're not turning her on... did that ever occur to you?<br>  <br>  You're the guy that makes men look bad!|`|h3NJO9dWaa	Maybe you aren't doing enough foreplay to get her wet and turn her on. Try lube. Also, it could be that she is on a medication that makes it dry. Just talk to her about it, and make sure you say "You don't seem wet all the way when we have sex, I hear this can be painful during sex, it's not hurting you is it?" Or something. Make it sound like you are asking about her comfort, not criticizing her.|`|AA10928214	If it's hurting YOU it's probably hurting her. just buy some freakin KY duh.

xDdhUldraa	Take him out to a mini race track, get some remote operated airplanes, go swimming, bowling, bike riding or anything that an 11 year old might enjoy.  Make a plan with him. Say next Thursday you and I are going to the pond down the street to skip rocks at 4 pm.  Then stick with that.  To be a big sister or brother is to interact with the kid.  It could be that he just doesn't want a relationship that will break up on 5 to 10 months.  Maybe he is uncomfortable talking to females.  One thing we can't talk about is the age gap.  If you are 16 then you are nearly a third over his age.  He might not be able to contend with that and may feel unsure of himself.  The last and final thing I can think of is he sounds as if he was an only child and his parents decided to open their home for the experience and he had no choice in the matter and may resent you for what you represent.
1DL9pUsEaa	defiantly defiantly definatly likes u more then a friend lol
WDs4fRoxaa	Check out this website. They can help you find the resources<br>  that you need to be free from his abuse.<br>  <br>  www.ndvh.org<br>  <br>  Best wishes|`|5cf0470a204de934eb842ceee9cb69cfaa	You need to go to the police station, and ask why when you have called, they do not respond, ask to speak to the major? You do need to get a restraining order. You do need these papers. Talk to the Pastor, counselor, tell every one who will listen. Contact your abuse center in your area, they will direct you in the way you should go. Read books on self-esteem!|`|TT2Pozpwaa	There is probably some type of domestic violence shelter somewhere close to where you live.  I would try to contact a hotline.  There has got to be someone in your family or friend that will help get you and your mother out of that house - out of that situation!  Keep reaching out.  Someone will help.|`|dzbblpjgaa	If he breaks the law once the restraining order is in place he will be taken to court and possibly jailed. The police cannot ignore this. Get one in place ASAP through the courts. <br>  <br>  As your health is at risk, is there no help or advice from your doctor? They may be able to do a referal to a place of safety or get suitable agencies involved. <br>  <br>  Fear is stopping you, now stop the fear! :)|`|4PupieViaa	Call 312-836-3406. They will help you, they helped me and I am a big fan of them.|`|AA10928214	I think it depends on the state in which you reside, but the police department should be able to do something. Next time it happens contact the police department, but make sure he doesn't know that you have so he doesn't have time to leave. When they arrive, they will see the physical marks left on you're mother or you, and he should be arrested. If once again, the police department fails to help you, you need to talk to someone about this. Such as the police chief, who is in charge of the police department, and needs to make sure his officers are doing their job. The police are there to protect and serve, and by them not coming out, they are not protecting you. Like another person said, you need to contact a shelter also, they can help to lead you in the right direction. You and you're mother can not stay in the house with you're father anymore. He hasn't killed one of you yet, but he could, and that's a scary but serious thought, Please get yourself away from this situation. Make phone calls, and be persistent. E-mail me if you need any help.
cYioBe3Kaa	you really should check davids bridal. i used to work there and i do recall some flowy, casual dresses for little girls.
Di6FAQxRaa	I think you should see her, and have a face-to-face talk. Dress real nice and smell really good. tell her the reason why you let her go, and tell her why you want her back now. Did you talk to her while you were broken up? Maybe she thought it was over for good. If she is a pretty girl she probably found someone who likes her unconditionally. But since yu guys were together for so long, i know she still loves you. But 3 years is long to be taking care of someone, so she should have been got off her *** and started working. Just explain to her that you got tired of it. Tell her exactly how you felt then and how you feel now. If it is meant to be, she will be in your life. Give her some time to think things through, i think she will come back, shes not gonna get over you in 2 months only if she found someone better, which i doubt.....keep me posted. What ever you did in the past should be left there. If she cant get over that than leave her alone.. Talk to her though and tell her your feelings. You need to talk b4 you can get her back, i think she feels hurt that you put her out. But tell her you want to take her out, go to a lounge or bar, somewhere where you guys can talk, if she likes what she heard maybe shell give u a chance.Tell her you took her for granted and that something really "extravagant and valuable" has been missing in your life, and that it was her. She will definately feel great after you tell her that she is very "valuable" in your life and that you want her to be apart of it again.|`|KBh6jKCTaa	the thing is, if you don't wanna be with someone when she needs you, then how can you expect her to be totally willing to take you back when she doesn't need you the same way anymore? i think it's good she took the time to find herself, but in the process, her wants and needs will have changed, so to get her back, you need to take every effort possible to get to really know who she is now (yeah, it's only been a month or so, but a lot changes in a month). you need to be the man she needs - she made changes in her life, and you kind of have to do the same for yourself. show interest in her new life choices, show that you love her for her, and most importantly, show her you're not gonna leave her again.|`|TrEYixLXaa	I am 24.  You should of never left her just because she was to dependent on you in the first place.  When you love someone, that isn't a reason to leave them.<br>  <br>  In my opinion, if she told you that she is thinking about it, that's because she wants to get back with you as well, but she just wants to play hard to get since YOU left her. <br>  <br>  Just call her, keep being nice, take her out somewhere and I'm sure you'll be fine.|`|Vbdfphhbaa	you gave her wings...she has flown the coop. you cannot ask her to go back with you...unless she wants to. for now just be friends and support her,that's it. give her a chance to experience freedom and find herself. you may get lucky and get a much better person than she was before. and she will simply be herself and not depend on you. give it time...|`|u49dfBkDaa	You didn't have to break up with her really to make her more independent, maybe she feels like you should have been there for her. Now she is independent, she wants a guy she can depend to stick around.<br>  You might be able to get her back through the usual ways though...call her, see her, tell her you love her and miss her...|`|UZ97lztYaa	Send her some flowers?<br>  maybe some roses.. and right a special message on the card..<br>  u dont want 2 hassle her 2 much because she will then get annoyed.. u want to give her something 2 think<br>  'awww thats really sweet of him'<br>  and make her miss u and think about u :)<br>  tell her how proud u are of her, that it takes someone really really strong to get their life back on track :)<br>  <br>  hope i helped and good luck.|`|zhaHc4FAaa	Cory,<br>       Unfortunately, you set these terms to be with her and now that she has found herself...she has found herself without you in it.   The only way to get her back is to work on yourself and romance her.   Maybe in time her heart will come around.|`|QK7ssy2Xaa	Ok I am 25 and I can honestly understand how she feels. You let her go and now you want her back. She is playing your game. She is going to let you hang for a while and keep you on a string. Now she knows that you know what you lost and she wants to make you dangle for a while wondering what shes going to do next. I don't know what to tell you. I guess it all depends how much she loves you too and how long you've been together. You shouldn't have let her go to begin with. If you really want her back, just tell her how much you love her and screwed up. If I were her, got off track and needed support, I'd wonder if you would do it again. So good luck and just tell her you will support her and be there for her no matter what.|`|vIbyyneaaa	To tell you the truth it sounds like you did her a favor when you broke up with her because now she has her own life. Tell her that you did what you did because you love her and that you only had her best interest at heart. Tell her that it might not have been the right time to be together in the past but now that you BOTH know where you are in life, you can be the happiest you've ever been. It could be a fresh new beginning to a love that never ended.|`|f97ff996dbb9ed22f8fb76befc96bd40aa	I don't think you deserve her if when you were together you didn't motivate her then why should she take you back and let you not motivate her again...like you said leaving her made her get a job so just leave her alone and let your decisions be final.  Maybe there is someone else in her life to motivate her.  If she wants you back she will come back because you have made an offer but don't push her.|`|AGKxNYBeaa	She'll probally be trying to show you that she has become independant like you told her and she might have been hurt when you told her the reason for you breaking up with her, I know I would be. But she only said it 'might be too late' which means their is still hope. Take a general interest in her, meet up with her for a coffee, lunch, take things slowly again, drop her a text to see how she is etc. See how it goes from there? I hope everything goes well for you!|`|opT8Uc8Paa	Don't pressure her...you'll come through as a stalker who's way to depend on her. Girls like chasing guys but not in a way where its like "alright this is pointless..." you know...?<br>  try asking her to go out for breakfast before she goes to school (or lunch) and drive her back then. <br>  DON'T ask to go to the movies which makes her think you only want *** or dinner since after dinner means your place. <br>  just hangout like you would with a girl you like starting slowly so shell think your not shady looking for a booty call.|`|Q7rUmJt7aa	Go to San Diego and jump of the Big red bridge for her. That should show her you care. lol. I dont know really dude. Show her you love her, take her to dinner, write her a poem or song to show your love. That might work. hopefully it will<br>  Hoping for the best man|`|w7g4eGqFaa	Well honestly, just show her that shes important && that you'll do anything for her. if i was her and you were trynna get me back, surprises from you would be nice, even if its a little surprise. visit her at work, at her house anything that will show her your worth(:|`|LuDNY9Dkaa	There is nothing you can do but wish for the best.<br>  Good luck.|`|DnCpBjPDaa	Well you should let her make up her own decision no matter how much it hurts. But do express to her how much you love her and that you want to be with her again.|`|HKF4tdmhaa	You should have stated that you wished her to work right from the day you met her. Explained your financial position or your aspiration for a working wife.<br>  <br>  Why do you need your girlfriend to work? And you should have married her for since she was 3.5 years with you right? How long would you want her to be just your girlfriend. You never seem to have exhibited commitment to her.<br>  <br>  OK did you help her update her skills to get a job that she might have prepared?<br>  <br>  Won't you have fed her provided accomodation and clothes as basic amenities and fed her children too had she been down with coma or paralysis or met with an accident?<br>  <br>  You seem to have not noticed anything she had done for you being together, as you did not list any good point about her. She might have been a great cook or a good home maker, good gardener, a painter, a good singer which you did not appreciate or notice in her.<br>  <br>  All you had was minting money through her and may be if you had it was cheap sex as you will not pay even to a prostitute everyday!!<br>  <br>  Since she did not work you simply dumped her. For 6 weeks the girl had been on road and had somehow managed to stand on her own legs now you want her. You people wont help a girl stand on her feet or back her when she struggles. You simply pose behind her when she holds a trophy as though you are holding her from fainting!<br>  <br>  Well to win her back you may need to ask her to forgive you and commit yourself to marrying her with a promise that you won't breakup again. Also tell her you only wanted her to learn the hardships people face(but why should have she got to face it) and that if she wishes to leave her job she may! (but know for sure no girl will leave her job after you have done this much, as the breakup you already administered on her will torment her for life and fear it not repeat again).<br>  <br>  Tell her you want to start again as a family. <br>  <br>  Will you buy a flat for her in her name? What are you that she has to come under your shelter again. When you are so stupid to have taught her lessons on financial independence. What is it that she is going to gain by coming back to you?<br>  <br>  But its going to be tough for you. Its really terrible to find oneself being put on the road for not paying you rent(thats what you expected right?). Sick of you guys noting comes to my mind to give you advice than to curse you.<br>  <br>  Tell that it is you who cannot live without her and be genuine hereafter.  Take good care of her. Now she may break up anytime with you as she is independent. So you dont end up being dumped!!!|`|n2gEupY9aa	Maybe she just said that its too late because you caused her so much pain when you broke up with her. Until now i guess, the time you broke up with her is still fresh in her mind. She can't also accept the fact that she's depending on you. Your ex gf is not aware that she's doing that, maybe because you let her be.<br>  <br>  Now, try to talk to her in private and make sure she's on good mood.<br>  Try to explain that you just want her to be an independent, trying to help her to stand on her own feet. And also tell her that one of your purpose is to make her strong. Strong to face the real life IF EVER something wrong happens to you. Who knows and who can tell what will happen..right? Try to imply to her that u just did that because for her on good. After that, you say everything that your heart wants to express. Look into her eyes, hold her hands and say I LOVE YOU and I WANT YOU TO COME BACK because YOU ARE MY LIFE.<br>  <br>  wait..don't you say sorry for breaking up with her because you made her independent. owkei?<br>  goodluck!|`|ntWi1fo0aa	Well if you just broke up with her in january and shes got her life together in february then maybe you were holding her back. Not to be mean but if you could have stayed with her in her down time and stuck by her and just gave her that nudge in the right direction then maybe you would have proved to her that you truly loved<br>  her instead of letting her sponge and thinking daily so <br>  negative about her. Maybe now that shes on her feet she can find a rich man to suit her needs because if you don't make much money then I doubt she was that happy with you and the beans you were bringing home.<br>  Good luck to you  <br>                                  P.S.<br>                                  If you were thinking forever in Marriage that commitment comes with for better or for worse... meaning stick by one another through good times and bad. You don't sound inconciderate... Just materialistic, but who am I to judge... I carry a full time job and household and would never sponge off a man|`|dd0d57e5ff24820c6981c10f9097112faa	ever heard of 'for better or for worse?"   i dont think she should take you back homo|`|046473fd7f160fe7a30e657aa5faaf75aa	Ask her why it may be too late?  If she got into school and found a job in less than a month after breaking up with you it is more than likely she was moving in that direction already, so your break up is not what inspired her to do so.  Does she resent you for pushing her toward those worthwhile pursuits?  If so, perhaps getting back together isn't such a good idea after all.  Investigate.|`|3c51ba3982b4a0fa984f838020963690aa	So you gave her wings and now that she's flying, you want to think for her?  You have to let her make up her mind, and stand back.  You let her know you want her back, you did what you could, now she has that info and needs to mull on it.  Maybe she's too busy for a relationship right now with school and work.  Maybe you have to be patient and wait until she's done with school.  But let her make up her own mind.  Give her that space.  You were able to before, you should be able to now.|`|ActoZyHraa	Let her know you need her in your life, by doing this , send her cute msgs weather its over txting, the internet etc. Take her out & do romantic things with her, possibly a high class resturaunt, keep pushing her to do good in life, she will feel like you want whats best for her, encourage her that you love her in ways you have never loved anyone. =] hope this helps|`|hlvdPjeFaa	Why did you even end it with her in the first place? Time changes everything. It was a choice you shouldn't have made. But since the milk is spilled, you might as well concentrate on moving on.|`|b3zGfYMpaa	Its natural for a girl to become dependent on someone when shes trying to figure herself out and has no clue about her place in world. I think its good that you gave her that time to do so an you should praise her in that she has. Shes doing good things with her life and the only thing you can do is try reassuring her how much better and different things could be now if she gives you another chance. Im sure she was hurt by the first breakup and therefore shes hesitant to re initiate things now, but if you can make her understand why it was better that you took the break maybe she'll take up on your offer sooner than you think. Other than that you cant force her or try talking her into the relationship once again. If you did you'd just be a hypocrite. Shes alot more independent now and this is a choice she needs to want on her own for it to happen. If she comes back to you on her own its that much more rewarding to you so just be patient.
DnCpBjPDaa	I think that he is definitely playing you. Usually when a guy gets caught and they say that they "need someone to talk to", he's guilty and lieing. I would not trust him and I would find someone better if I were you. Love does not cheat.|`|7Ih3G7Y1aa	I think that you shouldn't trust him because he is lying to you and because if he's doing drugs, he shouldn't be around your daughter from what i'm understanding.|`|XgkJF43taa	i think that there will be that feeling of not trusting him....but if hes telling you to go over anytime then i think that he wouldnt be hiding anything......also he came back to you that night explaining wat was the situation...i think that he is telling the truth|`|edpKlRnhaa	I think he's trying to get banged by someone else. Don't trust the lying son of a *****!|`|Ddn9I9v3aa	No you|`|LAxNiEigaa	personally i think he's lying.<br>  if he needed comfort or a 'friend' of some sort to talk to...i'd assume he'd talk to one of his guys friends first. but for the sake of the matter lets say they werent around..and he talks to this one girl from work. why would he INVITE her to his house to talk about it? why not talk about it at work during lunch or a break in private. or atleast go out for coffee and talk about it where the setting itself isnt so intimate and personal as a bedroom.<br>  next...why would she be hiding in the first place if he claims there was nothing to hide? it just makes it more obvious and more of a sketchier situation.<br>  dont listen to his lies!|`|vIbyyneaaa	If he's been you're boyfriend for 10 years, he should have stood by you when your daughter was going through these things. It sounds to me like he moved out so he could tell you he loved you... while he had some other woman over his house. It was so you couldn't be watching what he was really doing. He is a coward who wants to hold on to you and be with someone else at the same time. He can't have it both ways and you need to tell him that. Trust me, you'll be better off.|`|dd0d57e5ff24820c6981c10f9097112faa	he got an apartment so he could screw his workmate.|`|fe9b89ef9075d826f6d2b372470173b0aa	I think he wants you and the other one too. You need to make it plain that it's an either/or situation then quit calling, quit going over, and let him make up his mind. If you never hear from him again, he chose her.<br>  <br>  Why would you want him back anyway? He's a liar, a cheat, and a coward.|`|8v40KEd0aa	Nope, he's cheating.|`|xqan4ChSaa	get over him and you talk 2 much note:not trying 2 be mean|`|MAABo1zKaa	i think if your together and he needed someone to "talk" to about YOUR problems as a couple he would have come to you. And if he felt like he had to hide this so called "help line" in his bedroom obviously he knew it was wrong her being there. if your together your a team, if he had conerns about your relationship he should have come to you. he is 49 and certainly not a boy, he is well aware of his responsibilities and right from wrong. Problems with your daughter  should have nothing to do with his relationship with you and if he truly cared and wanted to be in the relationship i feel as though instead of stepping out of a questionable situation he would have stayed and helped and attempted at all costs to improve the situation. it looks bad from any angle you look at it and honestly I myself would not trust a damn thing he says.. how could you? thats the worst thingto find your man with another woman and recieve a bullshit excuse with sketchy facts..|`|b3zGfYMpaa	If your guy has a go to person whom he vents to and asks advice..after 10 years Im pretty sure you'd know who that person was. When a guy has a friend like that, especially a girl, you know you have nothing to worry about if hes already told you about her. If he hasnt its usually a sure-fire sign that theres something else going on..why else would he hide a friendship from you if thats all it was? And why do they need to "talk" in the bedroom of all places? Plus, you said she was hiding.<br>  <br>  No, I wouldnt trust him after this. After that little act, my guy would have to do alot for me to gain the trust back, but only you could decide now if its even worth it. If working things out was his real intention, why would anyone go and do something like this. He needs to spill the beans once and for all and say whats really going on. If he admits to messing around, it'll be easier for you to move on. If not you have your own reasons to believe he was anyway and now he cant be trusted, hes not someone I'd want to persue a relationship with.
aMkWajC7aa	it is a big wrong...she can do something aside from prostituting in  order for her to survive, its better to ask help to anybody than doing  that...she must have a respect to herself...that's not a good solution...|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	No I dont, but really girls dont have to resort to this in this day and age as there is always the benefit system for temporary help.<br>  Its not a permanent solution but it helps, nobody has to resort to going on the "game" I think the majority of women that do this actually enjoy sex and get paid for doing what they love. Its not about pride or morality its about selling what you have to men as they will ALWAYS be stupid enough to pay for it.<br>  If ever I get enough money I want to open a brothel, where there is sex there is money.|`|4HoVVCenaa	No. But it is sad. It isn't called the oldest profession for no reason. It can be thought of as a profession. But, it is illegal, except in 13 counties in Nevada. Some of those girls make $100K per year.|`|ODf41iN4aa	Yeah, & it could have psychological problems as well.  Better to be a waitress or barmaid or even a topless dancer, which at least isn't invasive of the body.  All of these are legal, too.  <br>  <br>  Or try every temp agency in town & keep going back.  Or start cleaning houses or, if you don't have kids, become a live-in nanny.  Or see if you can get funds for reentry into college, as well as work-study jobs.  Or deliver flowers & see about an internship for flower arranging.  Anything!  All of the above if necessary.  Some people hold 3 part-time jobs...I've done it myself while taking a couple of college classes.  There's gotta be something legal & not so psychologically demoralizing.|`|q2AsDnjpaa	Find that really hard to believe. Unless you are being picky.<br>  <br>  Are you declining night shifts? I I would say if you have applied at all restaurants, Fast food chains, security companies, hotel and motels,and still don't have a job then it isn't ok but has it be done. I guess you have to do what you have to do.<br>  <br>  I find it very hard to believe that you can't go on social assistance if you have proving you are trying and not being hired.|`|62bdfaff99eb94891a0098fdd62fe168aa	You have only two things of true worth<br>  your body and yourself respect - <br>  by having to ask this question in this venue you have demonstrated that you loss the second when you sell the first|`|ziSXXqWUaa	nope in the word of Malcolm x "by any means necessary"|`|DNwHGeEtaa	Selling yourself is the biggest mistake one could make in his/her life. Yes, the economy is so bad, but seriously the US economy is still one of the best. That's not an excuse. There are McDonalds, Burger King, KFC and other places. It shouldn't be that difficult to find a job there. Or be a cleaner, a waitress, etc. I know it pays very little, but by the end of the day you can go home, look at yourself in the mirror and still respect yourself. Mexican immigrants can find themselves a job, why can't you?|`|EdDLydH7aa	There has to be an answer some where, im in the say boat as far as employment goes but prostitution just isn't the answer, it's dangerous and self demoralizing b/c i know some women who have done it and don't enjoy it at all and in some states it is legal, but there has to be some way...i feel for you b/c it is hard to find employment and i know that living in a shelter isn't optional idea, it is cold out and the weather is at freezing where you could die from the elements, i know im not telling u something u already know, but im just saying there are other options...good luck and look into shelters for women and things like that...prostitutionn is the easy way out..be patient and try to find another...you aren't the only one in financial turmoil and with the economy being the way it is, there might not be many customers paying for services either so that isn't dependable, that's a death wish...good luck to you...and best wishes|`|NXJDsVfNaa	No its not wrong. You sometimes just have to do what you have to do. <br>  Its sad that some people are reduced to that, and I would personally never do it, but it happens.<br>  Although, I am sure there are SOME other things that she could do. Anything but prositution.|`|t5mX3rwLaa	No, it`s sucks not having a choice, and I would tell her to really think about it, it can brake some women spirits, others enjoy it, so it would depend on that and not her financial situation|`|kw15nA5jaa	so being a male should i resort to selling dope?
0fbcc59fc901bca7e0ca600714a7fb88aa	Sounds to me like Obsession and possession.  Two bad combinations. This Stacey has obvious issues.  Honestly coming from two truelly bad relationships.  The second one was to the point that after he left me, he would find out that I started to date again and would weasel his way back into my life making me think that he missed me when all in all, he didn't want me with anyone else, but he wanted to be with all others also.  Take care and hopefully you can break all ties with Stacey.  It truelly isn't her place to be asking about your personal life.  Let her know that.  Don't answer anything (questions) she asks.  Just let her annoy someone else.  You need your life and she needs to get a life.|`|4AZp8Quwaa	Sounds to me like she doesn't want you, but doesn't want anyone else to have you either. Just jealousy I think.
AA12233287	Sounds like Mom is way over-protective and demanding, sorry. The Bible says you should honor your parents all the days of your life. It doesn't say that you should let them run and control your life. Hate to say it, but sounds like Mom needs to get a life. You're an adult, act like one, and you might need to remind her that she needs to act like one too.|`|1235333b4f34f1147fc81bf4aef8885baa	The verse your mom is talking about is in Genesis.  It basically says that, when a person is married, they will no longer cleave to their mother and father but will become one with their spouse.  She's misinterpreting it pretty severely, obviously.  Most obviously because, if she were to take this verse literally, you wouldn't be living out on your own in the first place.  Following the Biblical pattern, you probably would have married off at 12 when you became a woman (your brother would have been a man at 13).<br>  <br>  God requires that we honor our parents.  That doesn't mean that we let them dictate every detail of our adult lives to us.  But, we should respect them and do our best to get along with them.  Sometimes that means biting the bullet and letting them have their goofy way about things.  Your mom doesn't like you to mention your boyfriend; that's dumb, but who cares?  Keep conversation light and avoid it.  Don't talk about your brother.  At 19, he's old enough to look after himself, you managed it after all, right?<br>  <br>  I would also try to avoid fights by using a lot of humor.  Not sarcasm mind you, but humor.  For instance, if she says: "I get to control you until you're married" counter with "anybody need a wife?  anybody?  I'm not picky!" or "Oh, sure, like you're giving up control just because I'm married.  I'll remind you of that then!"  Humor can defuse a lot of situations that reason and logic can't.|`|fAp0vFAHaa	Well when your aged 19 you are still a child (excluding the law) because your still a teenager and a teenager is still a child and when your 20 because your still an adolescent this is because your not a young adult overall (only by law your not a child, aged 18-20) but for the society and yourself shouldn't be acting like a child at all, in public or in private places (18 your psychologically matured into a young adult but the only things you shouldn't be thinking about is marriage, having descendants, having sex on your parents bed and moving out when your aged 18-20 but when your 21 are fully developed (full development ranges from the day after your 21st to the day before your 22nd but throughout the whole world the oldest age of majority is 21), a grown young adult and that having a personal life of your own should be the beginning but even though it's hard to let your descendants (your children) live their own life it is the time they start their personal life and career but you can come visit them every week (if they aren't in a situation where you cannot get involved) and see how things are going or if want you can live around the same area within the same town or district, but there should be no reason why you can't see your descendants at all, once they're ready to start their own personal lives and careers (or if you are a current attendant at university you can either live in a hostel or friends or husband/wife's house or even your own house, these are the options you must select because if decide to stay living with your mum aged 21+, there is; definitely no point asking this for advice, some people will think your a no life but at the end of the day it isn't a crime to live with your mum/dad for the rest of your life or most or couple of years after you turn 21 although some people think your a no life but at the end of the day it's up to you).|`|mF0L5jMNaa	Oh my!  Sorry it has come to this.  The Bible has been translated many, many times in history.  And many people add their own interpretation to the verses ... often it is the conservatives who take some verses so literally.  But you are not going to change that.<br>  <br>  You know that you and your brother are no longer legally under her control.  But if you or he is dependent on her (and your Dad?) financially, you need to follow the rules of the house.<br>  <br>  It's a big decision to break with family.  There is no safety net if you get in trouble financially or emotionally.  <br>  <br>  Good luck.
Ot2tJXU2aa	Chalk this one up to finding out your parent is human! Cutting him off isn't the best decision because this is your father for the rest of your life no matter what he has done or will do, but it doesn't mean that you have to put up with his ridiculous advise and control issues. Keep standing your ground and setting boundaries and if he doesn't abide by them then you have nothing more to loose and you can keep your sanity.  In the end he will not over step his boundaries but make sure you don't initiate a conversation that makes him a sound board for your relationships otherwise you will be over stepping your own boundaries and of course he will advise you, your still his daughter.  Remember this you can forgive your significant other but a parent can't when they are trusting someone to take care of you as kindly as they have.   I mean how would you feel if it were your own child you were listening to?  I hear parents all the time say I want to be a friend and a parent to my kids and this is wrong I feel because it contradicts its self and ultimately is immature.  Your friend definitely has your best interest at heart and is protecting you, but don't cut your parent out of your life just adjust the tone!
ejrVotg8aa	Maybe, but if she knows you're not interested in her she'll probably keep her distance. Maybe she just likes your company and friendship. Try not to make it an issue in your mind so it messes up your friendship.|`|djhCah5Maa	Maybe not.  You should be able to tell if she likes you that way or not.  Does she flirt with you or touch you too much?  Give her a chance.  She may just want to be friends.  Then if she hits on you, you can tell her nicely that you don't like her in that way but that you would really like to be her friend.  You could mention something about having a boyfriend right away, so you don't lead her on.  If you accidentally lead her on, then she could get upset.|`|aMHIA7XMaa	It might just mean that she wants to hang out with you - you guys are friends after all.|`|k6it06fiaa	no it just she like you as a friend and enjoy hanging out with and talking to you. Does not she like you that way.|`|CYcqQb6Caa	just because she wants to hang out with you doesn't mean that she likes you in THAT way you know. As long as you let her know in a nice friendly way that you are not bi then you should be fine and if she makes a move on you or something that you don't like then let her know that its unacceptable. hope this helps|`|B76B4KN1aa	hanging out is harmless. just make sure she doesnt try to get you drunk or try to increasingly casually slip in bi comments to see if they bother you. there are a few bi/gay people who hope that their straight friends are just denying to themselves their own sexuality, but most of them dont waste their time with someone who isnt attracted to their sex. Think about it, would you try to seduce a gay guy if you knew he had no interest in girls. no, it would be akward and pointless|`|33d13c8fa116273403e0f7b580bfabe3aa	No, relax, 1 of your best friends should want to hang out with you. I know that I like to hang out with my close friends. It doesn't mean that I like them more than a friend. Unless she tells you otherwise, just relax.|`|AA12076234	Well She is your friend and thats what friends do. I hang out with my girls all the time more than guys.

gK0vcdnDaa	YAY!  Another bride not having a wedding party (or at least considering it)…<br>  <br>  I am still debating weather or not to have a Best Man and Matron of Honor.  The day is about our love, not about our popularity.  I have been thinking that I’d like to have our witnesses stand with us (my step-mother and his best friend).  Having my step-mother there will also help so that she can pass me the tissue and I don’t have to deal with my bouquet.  If we do decide to have the wedding party we will not be picky about clothes.  I want them to be comfortable, if it is something they already own great! if they want to buy/rent something to match the wedding colors then that’s fine too.<br>  <br>  I really think that it is up to you.  If you are having a very intimate wedding (less that 30 total) I’d say skip the wedding attendants and let everyone enjoy as a guest.  <br>  <br>  We are having about 90 guests and in my opinion if I were to have a bridal party it would be three women, the women who mean the most to me in the whole world – my best friend of 16 years, my step-mother and my mother.  My mother I want as my mother not an attendant.  The other two I am really still debating over.  They know this.  They are aware.  I told them that I will have a real answer about a week-month before the wedding.  They are cool with it.  Either way they will be in attendance.  And wither way they both know that they are extremely important to me.<br>  <br>  In answer to your question: Do I think a wedding should have a wedding party?<br>  I don’t think that a wedding should have anything other than love of the bride and groom and the family and friends there to witness the marriage.  I think that if you choose to do without no one will care, more than likely they’ll never notice.  <br>  <br>  Best of luck & congrats!<br>  -Elle|`|OIJ3JBkSaa	finally a girl after my own heart - i think the money, the energy, the time spent on weddings has gotten way out of hand and i think any bride who feels the way you do about asking friends to spend so much money on dresses is a very good friend indeed. <br>  see i honestly weddings should be private and intimate - with only your closest family and dearest friends there to witness your vows. it is one of the most intimate moments in your life and i've never understood the need some people have to turn something so personal into a huge affair.  but that's just me!    <br>  so in answer to your question - no - a wedding shouldn't have to have a bridal party - all that's really needed is the bride, the groom, a couple of rings, a preacher and a couple of witnesses - everything else is just 'stuff'.<br>  good luck and happy wedding!|`|8IA3d3NNaa	your wedding, do what you want, my mom (she got married at 19 the first time) had them wear their prom dresses (all different colors), was very cool looking.|`|JtEBaOdjaa	I think that is fine but remember that you need to still pick 2 people to sign your license as witnesses.<br>  <br>  It's your wedding, you don't want wedding party then you don't need it and no one can tell you that you do.  The ones who do are traditionalist, followers with no imagination.<br>  <br>  Edit: If the only reason is the dress problem, let them wear something they already have.  Or tell them to pick out any dress they want.  A little black cocktail dress is something that every girl should have in her closet anyways.  So if they don't, this is their opportunity to get one.  But that's just a suggestions. I still don't think you NEED one.|`|gwindStOaa	I've never been to a wedding without a bridal party, but honestly I think it would be fine. I see what you're saying about the dress, but there are other options... you can have them wear simple dresses that they CAN wear again..... but really I don't think you need a bridal party if you don't want one|`|AA11380378	I've been to a few weddings without GM or Bm and no one even noticed or cared. I wishd that I could have done without too, but I had to include his only sister and only cousin, otherwise, I wouldn't had have any.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck, congrats!|`|pfjxEZBmaa	I don't think it should have a bridal party. I didn't want one, but I have one sister who wanted to be my maid of honor and since its a one time thing, I let her. And 2 of my friends really wanted to be bridesmaids as well, so I said ok for them as well. They know they will be paying for the dresses themselves, and I have no strict rules about what they should wear. I did it more out of obligation than want or need.|`|51St5GEcaa	If you're concerned about the dresses, then get dresses that can be worn for several occasions, simple and chic dresses that you can find anywhere, and don't necessarily have to be brides maid dresses<br>  If you're concered that it will be too much work and too much fuss, and you have no problem with having no bridal party, then just don't have one. I'm not going to have them either. Its becoming more common now.|`|237f7b8deabaa8cf367ed76288106f19aa	Take it from me, who just bought my 12th bridesmaid dress yesterday! Your friends will be thrilled that you don't want a wedding party. I don't think it is necessary by any means to have a wedding party. As much as I would love to retaliate to all of my friends for making me be in there wedding, I don't think I am going to have a wedding party either. Its just one less thing to worry about.|`|paerqxfMaa	It's fine not to have any bridesmaid or groomsmen.  You should however, have witness - maid/matron of honor and best man.  But, then she can choose what dress to wear - I was the only maid of honor for a friend, she told me what colors she would like and I was able to pick out a dress that I wore many times - it didn't even have to be floor length.|`|AkUhaMm9aa	Im doing the same thing our wedding will be small about 40 ppl..<br>  so i will only have my sister and MOH and he will have his best friend.<br>  <br>  thats it..and Im letting my sis pick out her dress...as long as its not something that looks like a club dress..im fine with it...also she wanted to pay for her dress..I offered to pay for her ticket to flight all the way from spain to be here..for 1 week..byt i live in canada...<br>  <br>  what you are doing its just fine..but if you decide to have 1 bridesmaid or MOH giving them the choice to wear a dress they like its more convinient for them...they can use it again..if they want..<br>  <br>  good luck|`|FnskUYpqaa	I think a lot of people don't mind paying for the dress because they like to be a part of your special day. But I do think it would be less stressful for you to have less people to worry about. Either way you decide is fine it's your wedding. Personally I would have 2 or 3 bridesmaids.|`|aipChC3haa	I think a wedding SHOULD have a bridal party, it makes everything easier for the bride and which girl doesn't want a big wedding?<br>  Even if you can't afford it, which girl doesn't want a huge wedding?|`|QJslTCUBaa	It's cool. Best Wishes. :-)|`|A1M9dIDvaa	It's your wedding day - do it your way. I think weddings are even more special when they are individualised to the couples' personalities & wishes. If you don't want a bridal party don't have one - but for the legal aspect of the wedding you are required to have two witnesses (these are normally your bridesmaid & best man) but why don't you ask your parents - say your father, his mother - to be the witnesses. I think it would be a lovely sentimental touch.|`|K7uj2AtHaa	I think its totally dependent on the couple. My fiance and I are not going to have a bridal party. Our wedding is also smaller and I saw no sense in asking my women-folk to pay so much for a dress in this tight economy. My fiance only has 2 men who he would ask to be groomsmen and we can't count on either of them to show up 100% (one because of distance, the other because of his job). So we just decided to make it easy. And it has been such a stress reliever not to have to worry about coordinating shopping with them, or making sure their outfits match each other, or about buying flowers for them to carry, or rehearsals...|`|I4d5PCKQaa	With no bridal party, there are less hassles. If you want to have one but small, I think you should just have a maid of honor w/ best man and a flower girl which is simpler.|`|rpVQpJA7aa	You don't have to have a bridal party. BUT remember this, you might need help on your wedding day with small things, so maybe atleast have a personal attendant?!|`|DUPOEk1daa	We weren't going to have them either, then we decided that we would use our siblings for the party.<br>  <br>  I kind of wish we could go back and not use them...or anyone.<br>  So I'm with you!
8XKmMBU7aa	baby brilliant it's OK.<br>  <br>  have a nice day and nice dream.|`|mvKDbb2uaa	If you've already booked the venues, then that usually means you've locked in your price and should not be subject to price increases.  You should've signed a contract with the final price.  <br>  <br>  Since your wedding is in 2011, you have time to save.  I would greatly suggest booking vendors early because they can quote you lower prices usually by booking early.|`|hkwBR1moaa	You ahve over 2 years to pay for it!  If you've already booked things and put deposits down, then your rates are locked in.  Just keep saving a little at a time and paying it off over the 2 years.  Don't wait untill the last minute to pay and buy the rest.  That's when the 'credit crunch' will be felt!|`|7G4hisdzaa	You are afraid the prices of the venues will hike?  The ones you already have booked, correct?<br>  You really need to discuss this with the vendors.  I would assume that the prices would be locked in, but if you have not talked to them about this and there isn't anything in the contract, beware.  <br>  I wouldn't cancel it out of fear--but do lock in a price NOW, and get it in writing.<br>  You have the big stuff out of the way.  If worst comes to worst, you can skimp on the other stuff.  Having a place to have it is most important--take it from someone who has everything BUT the venue.<br>  Good luck, try not to worry, and keep your head up!  It will work out.  :)|`|7a8db8d183d13feb7759bd9779e41ee3aa	I wish people would stop harping on about the credit crunch. A credit crunch makes it so you can't get credit. We are now in a recession. That's when people start loosing their jobs and money gets tight. So unless you want a loan for your wedding the credit crunch is not your concern, a recession is though. <br>  <br>  Nobody can plan that far ahead. We have no idea what will happen, its impossible to predict. Just be normal. Do what all people should do when they get married, don't overspend and don't stretch yourself too far, then everything will be ok!|`|AA11380378	It's never wise to put diwn deposits two years in advance. Especially since you don't even know if your could afford it.<br>  <br>  Yes, the prices will hike 2 years from now. Check your contracts and see if the deposit is refundable; it should be refundable as it is booked so far in advance, but again, check your contracts.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|mbu5LD02aa	It's never wise to put diwn deposits two years in advance. Especially since you don't even know if your could afford it.|`|EM5rQOGBaa	no keep the venues as it means dat once the deposits paid they can't put the price up , 2011 is a long while away if it comes to the & ur short on cash there is plenty of other thing to do to cut costs ,( am getting married nxt year & cutting things out of my wedding as don't want anything to fancy as it really only mine & my partner day)<br>  <br>  1. make your own favors ( very cheap to do)<br>  2.buy a second hand dress ( ur only goin wear it for 1 day & can take it so a dress maker to make the way u would like it)<br>  3. plan honeymoon for a few months after the wedding<br>  4 get family n friends to help you with things like flowers .|`|pfjxEZBmaa	If you've already made a deposit on the venues and signed a contract, that should lock in the price it is now. Which should save you from a price hike. If you have to cut corners on other things, than do it. There is no reason to worry about 2 years from now. Though IMO that's why I think its not smart to plan that far in advance.|`|b1xQKDEraa	weddings are one of thw few things not affected by the credit crunch, wedding shops and venues are just as booked up as ever. the credit crunch is not putting people off getting married. Get good wedding insurance to cover any companies potentiallu going bust and just save as you would do anything else.|`|lIO4uiJmaa	What do you mean you can't afford to get married ?<br>  <br>  I think you are confusing marriage and a wedding !

As far as being out of work there is no way to tell. I would not loose your deposits over maybe not having a job.|`|rpVQpJA7aa	No, don't cancel. Start saving NOW. Deposit a certain percentage of every paycheck into a high interest savings account!|`|I4d5PCKQaa	You can do a lavish wedding and still safe at the same time. Browse around online for favors and etc. Instead of having people do things for you, do it yourself. My sister is getting married in July. We're on a certain budget but not too cheap. We've bought shot glasses at only 70 cents for favors & put it into boxes ourselves. You can still have the wedding of your dreams. If you start getting your things now it will make it less stressful.|`|1cb3542838b379bb2f5a7c25c04d579baa	See if you can lock in the price.  Also, looking into things you can do on your own (instead of hiring someone else to do them for you) will save money.  Use coupons as well--one woman I know has a huge family.  They all gave her coupons to an arts and crafts store, and she'd use one every day.  She saved a TON of money.|`|DUPOEk1daa	It will be okay.<br>  Just save all the money you can until then.

Call him 1 - 2 times a day - depending on how his schedule matches yours. <br>  Or wait to see how often he'd like to talk to you. If he calls you twice a day, theres no need to call him twice a day.  Just try to match his feelings for now. Don't be to overbearing. men don't like that too much|`|fmATfubnaa	As long as you love him its ok to wait for him, your not wasting your time, i think he likes the attention and he really likes you:)|`|mjd1qjy7aa	Hold your ground girl. He'll call if he is really into you and I agree with the other person - focus your energy on something else.|`|DTZmqnCkaa	Today's world is all about cell phones and texting right?  Just call him whenever you want to and if he's available, he'll answer and talk.  If he's not available, leave him a heartfelt message.  You can't move too fast or too slow, you're not doing anything yet.  You haven't met in person and so far you're falling in love with an idea and/or an image.  Just stay sane until you meet in person and take it from there.  If it's meant to be and it's Gods will, it will find a way to work out no matter where you each live.  My best advice is to stay calm and rational and keep things in perspective and see what happens face to face.  Good luck!|`|cJep8NnHaa	that is really nice. it sounds like a fling that stepped up. i dont think your doing to much. making the cake and him sending you the shirt is sweet. and you should go see him if hes gonna pay for half[[thats really nice]] also dont be so sure its a waste of time. continue txting and talking and instead if you calling and not being answered call and leave a message saying:juss wanted to say hi little sweet stuff and then tell him to call you when he has time and isnt tired!!that solves everything.|`|c9f2a1b3d1f4937e76dfc5f19e0e903daa	He called and asked you to be his woman- so he is into you!  I think that you should call to say hi this evening.  If you can handle a long distance relationship that it may work out.  Did he call and thank you for the cake?|`|w57mGg4caa	Sounds like he was a little bit lonely and if you find a  fool you will use a fool.  Sounds like you are a bit desperate.|`|lBkLzGodaa	I dont think your moving to fast. you just have to keep in mind that, because he's in the military that he's going to have to be moving around alot, and your not going to be seeing him all the times because of it. That might put a strain on the relationship but it takes a strong woman to be a military girlfriend of even wife. I think you should call him! not all the time mind you, but it seems like he enjoys spending time talking to you, so even if he was tired i bet he would love to hear your voice before bed lol. <br>  Hope things work out!!!!
mfwNdPGXaa	She definitely likes you, but is struggling with feelings for her boyfriend/ex boyfriend (?) back home. <br>  She can't move on until things are over with him. She is probably torn between which guy to move forward with.  <br>  Your best move would be to back off, stay friendly with her, but don't talk about getting together, at all. You will know when she has figured things out (cut things off with him) by her actions, she will sit by you again, or start up a convo.  <br>  Watch her actions and you will know when the time is right to bring up the topic again.<br>  Good luck!|`|K71ZlPWgaa	ime is the best healer, she will evantually stop avoiding you don't act desperat act normal you are doing fine.|`|5fdgfNCRaa	Talking about her boyfriend gave her a reality check. She likes you, but because she has a boyfriend, she "can't" like you. If she's friends with you, she thinks she won't stop herself if something happens, like if you flirted with her or kissed her etc. <br>  She's doing this to avoid cheating on him. Maybe she's giving herself time to break up w/ the boyfriend, but she might be trying to talk herself out of liking you. <br>  <br>  You caught her staring at you again because despite the fact that she is trying her damnest not to like you, she can't help it so she still looks.<br>  She's torn betwen you and the bf and she's trying to make the "right" decision.<br>  <br>  I hope the best for you! Good luck!|`|8l4y6gxlaa	I think that before you started talking to her she thought that you could be her friend. Then you scared her off saying that you liked her more than a friend. She probably got a little bit wierded out by that and was trying to avoid you for a while. That is probably said that she needs a while. But don't worry... she will come around and you can be normal friends again. Just be patient and things will work out.|`|fwbKoLEYaa	she sound stupid...<br>  if she really is shy then, maybe she is embarassed about the whole situation..I mean the direct approach saying that you know and all that stuff probly scared her off!  Its good to be forward, and I admire the fact that your not a pussy..but with someone like her its not good to be like that. just give her time, to do whatever she needs..|`|Ww7CyyALaa	She's embarassed you found out she likes you AND you know she has a bf i'm pretty sure she likes you but she likes her boyfriend to when she said she needs sometime she probably meant she needs some time to figure out what to do like who she like more|`|4v2jcOsiaa	Maybe she really loves her boyfriend but likes you at the same time, yet she's confused. Just give her time.|`|ml0lgKVSaa	it sounds like to me that yes she does have a boyfriend back at home, but she is falling for you.  Maybe she is trying not to hurt her current boyfriend, but shes also torn between whether or not to go after you.  It sounds like she doesnt want to hurt either of you guys.  so be her friend and give her the space she needs.  shell come back.  besides its better to just be friends, then to push her away. <br>  hope it helped. :)|`|NzePT1QYaa	She's a tease and only because her boyfriend saw you shes not talking. i bet if you hadnt have met her boy she'd still be flirting with you ... STAY WELL CLEAR!! this is the prime example of 'It's the quiet ones you have to watch'.|`|w7VYMm1Oaa	maybe shes confuse on where she stands with you and her current boyfriend. just give her a  lil time and shell eventually come around(:|`|hkl6Zz2zaa	well you need to let this go cause she has a boyfriend and she just wants to see how you react|`|qSnxHinzaa	yea looks like she got scared away, move on man|`|AA12266415	Gee Josh... let me give you the recap -- You hardly know her, but you know she is really shy.  She extended herself to you in order to get to know you better -- and then you bring to her attention that she has a BF somewhere else.  And, now you wonder why she is feeling awkward around you.  It would have been nice if you had just let her get to know you better as a "person" -- without labeling your potential friendship/relationship -- as a boyfriend / girlfriend scenario Why do you men do this?:  So now you have what you wanted from the start -- a friend, ha!.  :)|`|EPmuhhGaaa	cuz shes shy and u embaressed the heck outa her! <br>  <br>  she still likes you but is embarressed and has a boyfriend. let her get their first and YOU sit next to HER.<br>  <br>  Just ask what movies shes seen lately or how things are going.<br>  <br>  you know be like "Hey stranger! how are things"<br>  <br>  you could friend her on facebook or myspace and talk to her there.<br>  <br>  DON'T BRING UP RELATIONSHIPS UNTIL SHE'S ACTUALLY COMFORTABLE WITH YOU- WHEN SHE IS SHE WON'T ACT SOOO SHY AROUND YOU. BUT SINCE SHE LIKES YOU SHE MAY STILL A LITTLE.<br>  <br>  online is easy for her cuz theres no face to face contact. but definately sit next to her and be her friend.

I never know if I'm making the right decisions, and I honestly hate having to choose anything, for fear of making the wrong choice. But I will tell you what I've learned so far. You never get time back. You never get back those years that you spent worrying. If you are not ready to get married right this second, then stay with the guy and have FUN! You never know what it could turn in to. And if it doesn't turn into anything more than a good time, then you can still look back and say "21 was a good year for me". I am really trying to stop taking life so seriously. It sounds so cliche, but you have to remember...you'll never get this part of your life back. I would rather spend my time being happy and care free. <br>  <br>  <br>  “Then Jesus said to his disciples: ‘Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat; or about your body, what you will wear. Life is more than food, and the body more than clothes. Consider the ravens: They do not sow or reap, they have no storeroom or barn; yet God feeds them. And how much more valuable you are than birds! WHO OF YOU BY WORRYING CAN ADD A SINGLE HOUR TO HIS LIFE? Since you cannot do this very little thing, why do you worry about the rest?’” (Luke 12:22-26, NIV).|`|LLeQyWGcaa	take it one day at a time. the very least he is a good friend and everyone needs good friends. in the mean time you could find that someone special as the days roll on. you will find someone in the near future, no worries.|`|c2ec7696beba807b7e7d0738493ee859aa	Your young, relax!!

If he so happens to be in the conversation while you're doing so it's a great way of talking to him without it being obvious that you like him. If you make yourself too available to him or tell him you like him right away, he'll probably think you're desperate so you have to develop a connection with him first. And all these answers about wearing short skirts and low cut tops, that gets you the wrong kind of attention, if he's good enough for you he won't notice that kind of stuff. The main thing is to learn to be more confident and outgoing and then men will come to you.

Most of the male persona is clueless whether a girl likes him or not. These days’ guys noticed girls who like them by flirting or seducing them. Though it is inappropriate to say to what these girls did but it is the only way to let the guy directly know that the girl liked him in an obvious way. A male’s mind is drawn to things like sports, work and things that do not involve big emotions. <br>  <br>  Some males will take advantage of you instead of liking you. It is to always think that some men have shallow mind too when it comes to direct physical attraction. They may even forget you the next time you meet them. Although for you it is the only way to make him know that you like him. Having guys to like us is pretty tough especially if the guy is pretty occupied. <br>  <br>  We like them to like us emotionally and be committed to us. We like them to never forget us the next time you meet again. We want to establish a relationship that is satisfying and forever. That is why we want them to keep forever. There are lots of ways on how to get a guy to notice you but not in a seductive way. Here are some ways to it: <br>  <br>  1. Know him better. Know what he likes in a girl. And change to be like it but not completely. Go with what he likes. Remember he is still a person. Every person has different likes or dislikes. <br>  <br>  2. Know his lifestyle or activities from day to day. If the guy goes jogging everyday in a particular time then go and jog with him. Then talk to him in a friendly manner and don’t let him notice that you like him or you’re doing this for him. <br>  <br>  3. Establish communication. Just say "hi" or "hello" is the simplest way to get him noticed you. Some girls would get the guys phone or cell phone number just to talk to guys. Some of the guys would not like having the girls to have this kind of first move. Or if you were office mates ask him some help about work. When you see each other try to flash him some smile. Have an eye contact when you are talking with him. Keep interested in whatever the guy says. <br>  <br>  4. Just be your own self and remember some first impression do seem to last. Most of the girls find their selves acting awkwardly when facing or meeting with the one they like. Being with yourself let the guy knows who you really are. Don’t overdo anything. Pretending to be like someone you are not, just to impress this guy is not good. <br>  <br>  5. Make friends with him. Be with the flow. Making friends with him is one sure way of establishing a relationship. It is good that you make friends with him at first to get you notice. A serious relationship often starts in friendship. Who knows what will happen in the end. By doing this you will know each other more often. <br>  <br>  If you happen to know or you are already a friend with the guy <br>  <br>  1. Make a connection with him by knowing what you do and like both. Having same hobbies or activities will help you be noticed. Joining the same club or working together is one key to be able to get to know more about him. <br>  <br>  2. Don’t be too demanding or pushy when you are on a date. Teasing him is also good. Have fun when you are with him. Make him feel that you are here at his side. Always lend a helping hand. Help him with his problems. <br>  <br>  3. Its okay to be aggressive but not too much. Give him a little space and time to be with himself. Let him find you. Absence can make him long for you. Give him a reason that you are worthy to be with him and make him fell you are special. <br>  <br>  4. Dress well to catch an attention. Have a make over. When it comes to attracting guys, be pickier with how you look. It doesn’t mean showing off, but at least you are looking your best when you’re with him. <br>  <br>  Whatever ways you would like to follow to catch a guy’s attention, remember that having a good approach and conversing is still the best way to be noticed. Still, knowing a person better is one way in liking him. Remember to impress him always. <br>  :]

mkrKHQvFaa	There is no perfect time line.  Some people propose after 2 months of being together and others 7 years.  It is a lifetime for commitment and when you feel like you are both ready for that, that is when you ask.  Don't do it because of pressure from others or because you feel like you have to.  Do it because you want to spend the rest of your life together.  Good luck.|`|JtEBaOdjaa	Seems like you guys are pretty serious and anytime now would be great!

But if you get past 3 years, than she'll start getting anxious and nervous, and think you don't really care.  That's in a normal situation when you aren't living together.<br>  <br>  If you have already lived together for a year...you should probably hurry up.  I know if I lived with a guy that long and he hadn't asked me yet, I would question his intentions.  Not to sound bad, but I would think he just wanted an easy lay with no commitment.  <br>  <br>  At least talk about it with her and let her realize where you are at.  Girls love it when a guy is for real.  If you let her know that you want to do this, but you just don't want to screw up the timing, she will know how much you care and how you are trying to make it perfect, appreciate it, and maybe even give you and idea of what would work for her.|`|IHNll9Yjaa	Well, might be good if you had some College under your belt.....you could have an extended Engagement.....if you guys have talked about Marriage and Children, or she talks about having kids....then yea.....go for it.

So being a virgin is words I perfer to hear...|`|SRPwwLJ9aa	how do they know your a virgin lol, don't just tell them if they don't ask and its not weird that you are one, keep chasing them and if they don't randomly ask are you a virgin don't randomly tell them|`|ml0lgKVSaa	I respect that you havent had sex yet.  Its your decison and if a girl is freaked out about it then that means every guy and their best friend has had a turn. dont even worry about it. Its respectable.|`|yCBpl2Jgaa	Not weird at all. Some girls like guys to take lead.control during sex. Some guys like it the other way around. Youll find the right girl sooner or later. xx|`|6ehYn1zGaa	dont tell them your a virgin or find a girl who is a virgin too and wants someone like that.|`|WU7xMQCyaa	No it isn't weird|`|jBZJkSjWaa	..congrats....no u not weird ok...|`|0Sqb6SBMaa	Mate just get it over and done with even if it's someone your not that much into.<br>  <br>  Believe me its the first step once the "first time" is over, you'll feel as if a weight has been lifted from your shoulders.<br>  <br>  Don't let the time pass you by.
sVNWdW50aa	Perhaps the help she was offering wasn't the same as you perceived. And, don't forget that the economy has changed as well. The money might not have seemed like a big deal when she first offered it. Since investments have dropped and nothing is worth as much as it was just 6 months ago, it may have changed her ability to help.<br>  Also, $8k may not seem like a lot to you, but it may be a considerable amount more than she had it mind.<br>  Don't hold a grudge. Mom's always want to help, sometimes the want is bigger than the ability.|`|bb06GQ5Paa	I've dealt with that...and almost the same situation.  I just let it go and when she brought the subject of a house again, I told her that I'd rather do this on my own.|`|x7vB4P5Naa	yeah, my mom does stuff like that to me all the time.  Nothing as major as yours, but she's done a lot of little things.  I'm not gonna really get into it right now because I'll just get upset.|`|AA10500537	borrowing money from family is the worst  thing you can do .<br>  go to the bank and borrow it  and you;ll have a fine  realation with your mom.<br>  go on as if nothing happened|`|Ot2tJXU2aa	First of all borrowing from your family is a BAD IDEA! She made a mistake and doesn't know how to admit it without disappointing you.  Did she come out and offer such a huge amount of help or just help?<br>  <br>  Save more money, but do your self a big favor and take the advice of people who know this isn't always the best idea and that it can lead to bigger issues in the future.|`|i15KoiJhaa	Maybe she made the offer never really thinking you'd take her up on it.<br>  <br>  Or possible that when she made the offer to begin with, she was thinking about less money then 8 g's... or her idea of helping you was hooking you up with a Realtor she knows, house hunting with you...<br>  <br>  Instead of feeling humiliated and betrayed, talk to you Mom... tell her you believe there has been a misunderstanding that you had thought she was offering XYZ and maybe she thought she was offering ABC... <br>  <br>  No reason to hold a grudge, it will only make the relationship more strained....|`|x80SgAlPaa	Many people offer stuff to be polite but don't think they'll be taken up on the offer. Or, she might be concerned about her own financial well-being but feels unable to tell you that. $8,000 is a lot of money.<br>  <br>  I suggest being completely honest about it with her. Tell her you felt her offer was insincere and that you are not upset about the money...you are upset with her breaking your trust.
mzNLfY4Caa	You should of seen my face....when I started singing that song.|`|oeCIzoF9aa	No but seriously, I may have done the same thing.  But most likely not.  I'm sure you did something to her to get her so angry in the first place.  But, from the story it sounds like you both got carried away with the situation.  You should have acted more mature and just let the whole thing go before it escalated.  <br>  <br>  Terrible ending to the story though.  Will Smith is a monkey and belongs in a cage.|`|6PhSENcXaa	Don't blame her for you being and abuser.  There are no excuses to hit a woman of any age no matter what she says or does.  A real true man will not hit his girlfriend, wife or just a friend.  She should kick you out and call the cops and have you locked up.  You should lose your freedom so you don't beat another woman.  Sick! <br>  I've been with my wife for 31 years plus and I never ever lifted my hand to her or hit her in any way.  I never will hit my wife no matter what happens between us.  <br>  You must be so proud of yourself now!|`|LbGRsCTKaa	Too much idle time on your hands today, huh?    Why aren't you in school?   This story is totally unbelievable.   I read this same story a while back on here.    Get busy and do something constructive.|`|kNFH5lKnaa	You're just a fucckking idiot<br>  :DD|`|AA12196812	Get some anger management councelling. <br>  <br>  And - in case this girl didn't break up with you yet - break up with her, nicely and politely. Offer to pay her doctor's bill if needed - you probably broke her nose and she needs surgery, but end the relationship.<br>  <br>  You obviously are fully aware that it was wrong to hit her. You need to develop strategy to not hit people again, no matter how nasty they get.<br>  <br>  ---------------<br>  I see comments that your story is not believable. I disagree. It feels rather genuine. If you did make it all up - hey you write good fiction. Next time, publish it as fiction though, not as a true story.|`|i5MiFhMyaa	There is never, ever an excuse to strike a girl or a woman.  If you want to fight physically, fight with a man. Leave her, break up with her, but never hit a woman. Even if she hits you, you don't hit back. Report her in that case.<br>  <br>  in this case she should report you and either (1) have the police come out and file charges or (2) have her brother, male friend or whatever come out and seriously kick your butt.<br>  <br>  Abusers are always sorry afterwards and claim that it will never occur again. It always does.|`|MajGRAaraa	Dude you are a loserface! Why bring in the Fresh Prince of Bel-air,lol! Dude that was amazing,but if your story is really true,I might be able to help you.|`|ablriuUVaa	i think there is valid reasons to hit a women, but not like that<br>  ull probably get charged<br>  <br>  u should have slapped the ***** instead|`|4QHanq1Laa	u r mentally unstable.|`|kPKKyZluaa	WTF is with the last part are you truly serious or are you insane. If you want an answer than be serious not stupid|`|TWeRUgXxaa	are u freakin serious?|`|UWisVSYYaa	There is not going back nor there should!<br>  That scene would be before the inner sight of both you and her anytime go to caress her - stressing mostly her as she would instinctively get a reflex to avoid an expected hit ...<br>  Chastising yourself physically (though not extreme) would earn you the following:<br>  1)Kill your mental pain!<br>  2)Feel some kind of justice!<br>  3)Become stronger!<br>  ...<br>  And when henceforth a girlfriend or family member start to Fight you Verbally - Start saying a Prayer in your Mind - this would prevent you to Rage Physically !<br>  ...<br>  Anyway - do your best to accept yourself as imperfect as you are - because - remember this wise saying the Orthodox Christian Church has come up with:<br>  Everyone carries in his Life two sacks of Sins -- The Others' - Before themselves ; and His Own - Behind themselves !!!<br>  ...<br>  Peace be with you , brother !|`|sqmIO2u5aa	You really did that to your girlfriend? so unbelievable, but if it's true then you surely have to go counseling...For controlling your temper..It's not ideal to hit your girlfriend, that only means that you can surely hit her more to your future wife..If I were the girl, I probably dumped you in jail...|`|sjOy6dFDaa	ABUSER!|`|gAnDYe2eaa	LoL PRINCE OF BEL AIR. Yo You lucky she didnt call the cops man you be in some deep DOO DOO. If you was older you be in much deeper DOO DOO. SCOOBY DOOO.

Let's look at the situation closely.<br>  <br>  <br>  Whoa, right there..<br>  <br>  You can't play those types of husband-and-wife games outside of marriage. God tells us to guard our emotions and affections. And he also tells us to stay away from even the hint of sexual activity outside of marriage. You and your girlfriend were crossing the line.<br>  <br>  So what happened next? You responded in an angry violent way to your girlfriend's immaturity.<br>  <br>  But Jesus told us to be peacemakers.<br>  <br>  "Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called sons of God," He said in Matthew 5:9.<br>  <br>  The actions of another person - in this case, your girlfriend's - do not excuse you from Jesus' command to be peaceful. Quite simply you should not have hit your girlfriend.<br>  <br>  But you did. I truly regret that you grew up in the atmosphere you described. It was an atmosphere, in your own words, which told you, "If someone hits you, you should hit them back."<br>  <br>  What happened to you as a child and what you were taught is not right. Acting out feelings of anger is not God's way - and shouldn't be our way - of dealing with life.<br>  <br>  Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak, and slow to become angry, for man's anger does not bring about the righteous life that God desires (James 1:19,20).<br>  And remember Jesus' example, during his torment and death on the cross? What did he do?<br>  <br>  When they hurled their insults at him, he did not retaliate; when he suffered, he made no threats. Instead, he entrusted himself to “him [God] who judges justly” (1 Peter 2:23).<br>  <br>  So where from here? That's what you want to know.<br>  <br>  My advice, is that first of all you should seek forgiveness of this girl. Confess to her you were wrong, and ask her to forgive you.<br>  <br>  And then give the relationship space - lots of space. In my opinion, great damage has been done to that relationship. It should not be your primary concern right now.<br>  <br>  Instead - and this is the most important step of all - you should gain some Christian counseling to help get to the bottom of your anger. It is true that the people who are often hit while growing up are more likely to hit others when they are older. So God may be using this incident as a wake-up call for you, to show you how serious your problem could be.<br>  <br>  Spend some serious time on getting yourself well, on making yourself whole. Until you do that (with God's help), you will have a hard time having the kind of dating relationships you want and need.|`|o07KqtFZaa	that's horrible
i3pn4jNcaa	tell her to stop being so high maintenance and be thankful shes with a guy as nice as you.
Hm0bCjYFaa	just be his friend and give someone else a chance with you|`|kqa9VFrfaa	He wants to play around. He wants to have plan A,B, & C. If U R not plan "A" why be his back up? <br>  He is basically telling U that if the # 1 girlfriend doesn't put out for him, then he would love to have a second choice.|`|ew3Wl6hKaa	what are you talking about!!!! non of that makes sense, pay attention in school instead of worrying about dumb grade school garbage|`|FyhzmgRUaa	It all depends on how you feel. Will you be alright with just being friends? and are you sure that you don't have any feelings for him?, would you be OK seeing him this new girl?. And you also said it yourself that you don't like the fact that he smokes. It sounds like you want him to grow up a little?, Hope that helped.|`|AA12240339	Shoulds like he just wants to keep you around for extra loving.... And maybe he is confused in any case if you still truly love him tell him to either shape up and have only you as a lover, or move on and just be friends....|`|mbu5LD02aa	pay attention in school instead of worrying about bf's|`|GqTSa85daa	He wants the best of both worlds.  Your a fall back for him.  Don't fall for it, move on!|`|3b439d9a67a6c2ad214cd95b7a1343b5aa	Hate to say it, but you're the Plan B. If things don't work out with the current chick, you're the back up. So at this point, you need to ask yourself if you're willing to an option for him instead of a priority. Personally, I play 2nd to no one.<br>  <br>  Besides, you broke up with him for a reason. Remember that. <br>  <br>  He's not looking to be friends, he's looking to have his cake and eat it too. Don't fall for that. Walk away and stay away. If you guys are really gonna be friends, it'll happen in time.|`|qroOTyrGaa	Don't be friends with him until you're 100% over him or else you'll have a complicated mess on your hands. Imagine how you would feel if he was hanging out with an ex girlfriend while you two were together. You'll never get over him and he'll never get over you unless you give each other some space. And if you do end up being friends with him, if he crosses any lines with you, you need to make it clear that you want to stay friends. But overall staying friends with an ex right after you break up normally doesn't turn out very well.|`|1ab212c3a6d557476823936bc5066419aa	Firstly, if smoking is the only reason you broke up with him for, you should really cut him some slack. <br>  <br>  If you think that this relationship will not work because you hate smokers so much, I fail to see how you will stand him as a friend. If you don't have too many issues with your friends smoking, then go on be his friend.<br>  <br>  I have good friendships with my ex-boyfriends.<br>  <br>  Stick to what you believe is best for the both of you<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|JtQvOLqkaa	Depends on what u want and what u r capable of doing. Are u over him enough to not let a close friendship with him mess ur head again? Do YOU want to be closer friends with him? Whatever u decide, my advice is DO NOT fall into the trap of becoming his friend with benefits!|`|FIuUsrAMaa	the answer is clear!<br>  three people can't dance tango!<br>  dont let him get closer.|`|50nmZ3aoaa	i think he is just playing you, he wants you to fall in love with him. i dont think that he likes you. (thats what i think)<br>  i think that its time for you to move on and find a new boy friend.|`|RvqpJRFYaa	Get someone else... make him miss it.. DO NOT run back crying to him..|`|ebryvMQuaa	Sounds like this guy wants to go back and forth between you and this new girlfriend. he says he wants to become closer friends which makes him seem a little sketchy. Now I wouldn't say DON'T be friends with him just be careful. He seems like he has alterior motives for wanting to be such close friends with you even though he's claiming he has a new woman? <br>  <br>  The question is does his new girlfriend know that he wants  you two to still be friends? He might just playing the both of you. <br>  <br>  I'd stand back and see what happens, just what ever you do don't go running back to him or think you guys are suddenly going to be okay.<br>  and if you wait it out enough you'll eventually find out what the motive is.|`|j9Sz7i9kaa	It seems fine to be his friend, just think of how you would want to be treated (don't interfere with his current relationship, even if you think it is just going on to make you jealous). The reasons you broke up are good enough and maybe in the future if things don't work out with this girl and he quits smoking and as his friend you see he isn't in love with someone else you can try again. Or not. You will probably meet someone much better for you if you don't let this guy become all you think about. Just be the kind of person you'd want to be with - surprising how that attracts good things to you!!|`|U5cj2E4caa	Well, you have to decide what you really want. I know it may be hard for you knowing he has a new girl in his life but do you really want to put yourself in the position knowing you are now come second in his life?<br>  <br>  Ask yourself if you do become friends will it cause you emotional pain?  Also think about if you really want to be there for him because it seems like he may be using you just incase it does not work out with this other girl.  He has a choice right now, if he doesn't choose you now then you deserve someone better who will put you first.
BKr3y30maa	Compliment her every once in awhile but don't compliment her constantly.  Know that if she wants to spend some times just with her friends, that it's not something to take personal....everyone needs their space.  Really listen to her when she talks...that way if she mentions something she likes, you can possibly surprise her with a little gift later on (example: if she says she likes to collect unicorns, you might come across a pretty figurine to give her) and she will be impressed that you actually remembered she liked unicorns.  Don't pressure into sex, when she is ready she will let you know.  Call or text her just to say you are thinking about her.  It's the "little" things that mean the most.  Great to see a guy on here that is so concerned about his girlfriends happiness!  Best wishes!  :)|`|7JTku3qpaa	well my boyfriend is awesome but slightly clingy.. lol but nothin i cant overlook. he is always taking me out for suprises.. and he bought me flowers.. just little acts of kindness is all it takes. take her subtle hints seriously. if she says her shoulders are sore.. back massage.. if shes feeling bad.. hugs and getting her her favorite thing. like if im feeling bad my boyfriend goes out and gets me my favorite tim hortons doughnut. lol its those little things that make everyday i see him 100% worth it. but dont spoil her.. it might make her a little bitchy. not saying she is but we all get that way when we're spoiled. =]
AA10757358	I'm sure your parents have a reason to not line like this girl.  Did you think that they just might be right  There are a log of girls out there so find one both you and your can like.|`|1uvrkDWNaa	It would be a a lot easier to answer this question if you could tell us why your parents hate her.<br>  <br>  *edit*<br>  If you like her that much then, continue to see her, but keep it from your parents.  They cannot tell you who you can and cannot date.|`|Ga7rI488aa	Well you have to take into these into consideration. <br>  <br>  Why don't your parents like her?<br>  If they have a good reason, then it's good to consider, but if it is something they just can't put their finger on, then tell them they can't even give you a legitimate answer.<br>  <br>  How old are you?<br>  Age plays a partial role in this. If you're still really young, your parents are least likely to take you seriously. But if you can back up your argument, then they might warm up to it.<br>  <br>  If all else fails and you truly believe she's the girl you're meant to be with, then pursue her. If not, take your time with her and them see what happens next. Hope that helps!|`|pOKjZcFJaa	It's always hard to date somebody if the partents dont approve - so the best is to convince your parents that you two are right for each other right now. Explain to them that you have changed since the last time you cheated on your girlfriend... and that since you cheated on your ex with this girl, it must mean that you really do feel something for this girl. It usually helps if the girl is sweet enough to have a decent chat with the parents... maybe if she shows them that she is a nice girl and excuses herself for the past mistakes, they may understand better and at least have respect for her since she is taking the time to excuse herself.<br>  Time will figure things out in the worst cases... but if you really do like her, don't give her up :)<br>  Good luck!<br>  PS: And it would help give you advice if you specify how old you are!|`|YHwVw2pdaa	I think you should try to reason with your parents. The cheating part, you should tell your parents its not her fault but yours for cheating. Tell your parents some good things about the girl you like. Try making your parents like her by saying that she gets good grades, shes nice and helps other, etc... I think parents go for that. Sometimes parents get overprotective about their kids dating someone. haha hope this helps! =]|`|4zVi6gvgaa	Stick it to them! It's totally up to you who you do or don't go out with! Let them know that you're in charge of your own life!
yepd9psLaa	WOW,<br>  You really should email me and explain your situation better. I am here if you would like someone to confide in. I have been at that suicidal feeling before and know what you are feeling that desperate no energy to live anymore feeling. I am a world it feels away from my family you should talk to some kind of person if you have a particular religious affiliation they have seen it all and heard it all believe me people you see every day and think are fine are going through a lot of turmoil themselves hold on sweetie. My favorite quote that got me through that rough time was in my fav book the Count of Monte Cristo " LIVE for a day will come when you will be happy and bless life" Email me seriously-|`|AA11996507	You don't say exactly why your life is at such a low point at the moment, but trust me, there is always someone worse off than you.  Find that person and help them.  I am totally serious.  It will put your own problems into perspective like nothing else.  Volunteer a few hours of your time per week somewhere where you can work with kids with cancer or abandoned animals or victims of violence or whatever you can find in your community.  Soon you will feel great about yourself, not only because you will see that your own issues are not as bad as you might have thought, but also because you will know that you helped someone else.|`|b8c678e20c5b368190238ab98c78d204aa	How old are you that has a lot to do with what your going through i will not try to blow smoke up your butt i will just tell you what i went through. So many times i wanted to give up and i tried a couple of times the last time my sister found me and called an ambulance for me. I was in intensive care for two days when i woke up to people crying across from my bed the doctors were working on a man but he died. The guilt that i felt was unbearable here i was 22 and feeling sorry for myself. That's all it amounted to poor me no one loves me that day showed me what a fool i been. I am now married with a 28 year old son and a loving husband. Just think if i would have died that day all the things i would have missed out on. I'm just telling you my story you can take it or leave it. Stop thinking about your self think about what kind of pain your mom would go through if you tried to off yourself. It would kill me if my son died before me if he killed himself i would blame myself what did i do wrong. Sense i did go through that at a young age i was better equipped to talk to my son about all the changes he would be going through and what to expect. Knowing this and knowing it's normal and having someone to talk to about it helped my son become a happy man let alone a happy kid growing up. I hope someone on here can get through to you and say the right thing to make you understand that you can get through this. It took me seeing a man who wanted to live die right in front of me before i got it i never want to feel that kind of shame again. That day my life meant something to me there has been days sense then when i been depressed like when my husband walk out on me and our marriage or when i caught him cheating on me or when we were separated for 2 1/2 years. I swore i would never let myself get that far down again and i haven't i am 56 years old now and i still go back to that day and hear the cries and a man i didn't even know die.How dare i take my life i don't have that right so i promised myself i would never try that again. I know this sounds corny as hell but it's my story and my life.|`|0ysJHjjEaa	Live for your friends and family. Life is never fair to anyone. Everyone feels fear, pain, and sorrow. So many people were not given the chance to have free will and life. As bad as you have it, someone else surely has it worse. Before you consider making a drastic decision, consider ways to improve your situation. You're never alone and whether it be religion, a phone call to a hotline or jsut an escape like reading a book, there is a better way to handle your feelings. I hope to best for you and all the love.|`|Ch39oU58aa	Things will get better!  you have to give yourself a chance. Before you decide to take your life how about exhausting all your options first? Tell you family how you feel (they'll most likely support you), talk to a therapist, find religion, find a support group...etc. you should actually call boy's and girl's town hot-line... they specialize in helping people in your situation. call 1800-448-3000.  they are available 24/7<br>  <br>  Best of luck|`|EJWphb88aa	life is a challenge and if u face ur difficulties boldly its better for u.<br>  Anyhow i suggest u to start chanting and praying coz it has measurable powers in them, u will feel spiritually more confident and mark my words ur world will change for the best.<br>  Visit this website <br>  www.spiritualresearchfoundation.org<br>  All the best pal be patient ur life will only improve.|`|w6v8JnBAaa	Oooh! It's good to know that I'm not the only one who feels this way sometimes! I don't live in fear everyday but I do live with anxiety that I constantly battle to keep under control...but you're not here to hear all about anyone else's problems....<br>  My counselor gave me this advice: Ask myself what I "need/want" right at this minute. What would be a good thing to do for my body right now? A drink of water? Going for a walk? Should I just push myself to get into the car & go to the mall & force myself to window shop?<br>  The point was to make me train my mind to think of something else & to get through the bad "feeling". She told me that all "feelings" pass in time & shouldn't be feared. They can't hurt us. So whenever I feel myself slipping downward, I just say to myself. "This feeling too will pass." & now my mind automatically knows that I should start thinking of something to do...water...walk...find a movie...vacuum...pet/comb the dog....ANYTHING but feeling like ending it.
z9k2TUcbaa	Approach her casually by saying "Hi my name is [name], what's your name?" I know it sounds lame right now, but when you ask it, it'll be as casual and original as you can ever be. After she tells you her name, just start getting to know her from there, but go slow because you JUST met her. Say something casual like "I've always seen you walking at lunch and passing periods, and I always wanted to get to know you" *smile* and there you go, a perfect conversation.<br>  <br>  Just have fun with it and don't be nervous, get all those insecurities out of your head, but that doesn't mean to go become an egocentric freak :]<br>  <br>  I suggest you to look 'clean' as in not messy or poorly dressed (as in effortless in trying to look sharp).<br>  <br>  Good luck! ^_^|`|HcCuqGYiaa	say hey i am---- how are you?<br>   it is really that easy|`|De1tOxHXaa	So,you are attracted towards that girl,go and talk to her about some general things and do some filtering too.<br>  for example, say her you looks quite beautiful to me,i want to talk with you, just ask her what is her daily-routine, also you can ask her for going on date,but only you can ask her for going on date after some talking with her.
ZG3Xiup3aa	what  i think that she might care  about u becuz she likes to call u and stuffs.|`|hx7NWXq2aa	Are you in a long distance relationship?? Because if you're not then why doesn't she see you if she really cared she'd want to see you. It sounds to me like she's seeing someone else but I'd say if the behaviour keeps up I would end it to save you the heart ache of the situation. It sounds like its so hard on you as it is that it's not fair on you, you need someone who really cares actually you deserve it as a person.|`|P5LC2fdWaa	well, i think that you should talk to her (girls will be open to talk) and tell her how you feel and ask her if she feels the same way. maybe she just thinks it is a little accword. nothing will get solved if you dont tell her how you are feeling! haha. everything will be okay. even if you both decide that you should "take a brake" then remember (as corkey as it sounds) "everything happens for a reason" . everything will end up perfect!
mSt1LGfjaa	well im here to give you a great big hug and hope you feel better honey bunny,,|`|VX16L24Taa	you could be going threw something<br>  and you know that a hug makes you feel better<br>  or you could be feeling crap!! like i do right now<br>  and just wanna hug from someone lol<br>  your brain, body knows they make you feel better<br>  right now i need a shot of tequila, and some of my girls over<br>  ohh and obv some hawt quyss... but its too early<br>  just making plans!!<br>  <br>  hugs are great lol<br>  but i don't give them out nearly as much as i receive them (or like to :P)|`|xarKlp0Oaa	Some days you just feel down in the dumps and a heg is always a good thing.

FtyLwqR5aa	she is to young to be in a relationship especially one where she is mistreated. you need to make sure that she knows you are her friend no matter what and that you are there and going to be there when she needs you. trust me she will need you. Just make sure that she is ok and don't down talk the other guy. eventually she will see that you are a better person and you will win her. She does need to get away before it is to late. it only takes 1 hit to kill someone.|`|7VyHmYogaa	well you should straight up tell her all of the things your feeling for her again .... and don't back off because if you rally like her try to make her see that she is doing wrong with the guy she is with right now and don't pressure her with asking her out because i don't think she is going to be ready for a relationship after they break up ....just be with her and try to make her see that not all guys are the same ...|`|osoTq2dcaa	let her be she is 15 she is confused ... your mind doesnt emotionally develop till your at least 18|`|dK2Zv21Daa	Run Like Hell Run ! UR what "17' She likes this treatment already<br>  can you deliver ?  y not look towards  your books and leave  the bull  behind|`|f06Sy0dfaa	Sounds like she missed out on a really sweet guy. <br>  If she broke up with her bf, and told you that she liked you, then got back with that other guy, I say LEAVE her ***. Find another girl. There are plenty out there!! Don't wait around on her, because you might miss out. She doesn't deserve you. If you really wanted to get with you, she wouldn't be playing around with your feelings, and playing the "whom shall I date game". That doesn't fly. If you want to be friends, then I think that's all you should be. Just look for another girl, I'm sure you'll find the perfect one.<br>  Good Luck to you! :)|`|TQSov8K3aa	Okay so she really likes this dude i mean she is in love with him shes lost her virginity to him so she thinks shes owned to him now i know you might think you would treat her better but its her choice dude she might really like you yeah but she apparently likes him better maybe you should talk to her and show her that you can treat her way better than her current ever could but mean while, while your waiting on her to fall for you let her know that ya ll can always still be just friends|`|7tUAlLUXaa	i think she playing you..<br>  she doesn't know what she wants ..<br>  you should just forget about her|`|0RJK65zcaa	hmmmmm, sound to me like yur friend may be really confused or something..... this is one of those situations where all you can do is wait until she makes up her mind.....now you do have to remember that you are still young so dont waste your time waiting on someone to decide how they feel. life is too short and time is flying by..... if you feel like its worth the hassle then by all means do what it takes to get your girl even if it means waiting and just being there for her when she needs you too be there......anyways good luck and i hope that it this advice helped ypu out in some kind of way~chosen|`|6IeiXBP7aa	I don't want to be so hard on you but move the fukc on. Obviously she only sees you as a friend, a friend to lean on when her boyfriend leaves her. She is very young & dumb every one at that age gets blind by the stupid **** heads that treat em like ****. Do not loose her friendship she may need you more than what you think.|`|JhvqUvlsaa	She's confused so just be her friend and back off while she's with this guy. If they break up again let her come to you but tell her you'll be there for her. If she acts like she wants to go out with you then accept but if she is too wishy washy then ask yourself if this is what you want in a gf and you'll probably find the answer is no. So keep being her friend but give her room to figure things out.
ugaIZSjuaa	no i dont think it awkward but i guess the limit for me would be about 15 years older and im 21 soooooooo|`|3m9DQuDRaa	I'm 29.  The woman I'm dating off and on is 31.  I usually prefer younger, though, solely because I believe myself to be immature in most cases, and would like to have a maturity level that matches mine.  I don't know...  I don't like too young...  but I guess my range would be three years older than me to five years younger than me.<br>  <br>  I'm not awkward per se, older women seem to be a bit more understanding of things and such.  My only gripe with older women is that at my age, it seems like every women who is older than me by even a year seems to be in a different generation...  likes a completely different set of music/movies/shows than I do...  so older seems to have the problem of not having a lot in common.<br>  <br>  Younger girls seem to even up with me a bit better.|`|81G2HovJaa	I am not sure when I was 19yrs old I like a 22yr old girl and a 34yr old girl.

SkFgDxpEaa	yes it is totally right for you to expect that. but when he was wooing you, he would have tried nearly everyday, so now ur married, he might be expected to do it every so often, like a few times a week|`|W1rCsvTzaa	We are in our 20th year of marriage.  I give my wife the same level of emotional focus and attention I did when we were dating.  I LOVE my wife, she is the best.  <br>  <br>  When we close the bedroom door, she treats me the way a girlfriend treats her rich boyfriend when she is trying to get him to propose.  And I do the best I can to please her as well.  But I know that sex is only super important to her because it is super important to me.  <br>  <br>  There are times in a long marriage, when the boundary between you blurs and sometimes even disappears.  And when that happens, you can no longer tell where you end and she begins, where she ends and you begin.  And you slide into this upward spiral anticipating what each other wants, laughing and touching, stealing glances that no one else notices and seeing things in your own private set of colors.     <br>  <br>  My greatest hope in life is that my daughters marry men who care for them the way I care for their mother and my son marrys a woman who loves him the way his mother loves me.|`|aDIPIu7xaa	Hell Yes!|`|AA11596133	YES, it is totally unreasonable for you to expect him to act like he is courting you, because he is NOT courting you.  He won his prize, so to HIM, he should not longer have to wine and dine you. <br>  <br>  Men are like that - they do NOT see things or feel the way we do - they just do NOT.  It would do you good to understand that right now. Men are NOT born with the ability to read minds, or to know what you want at any given time.  It takes YEARS of "training" on your part, and a whole bunch of patience and understanding, to get a man to understand you at all.  I strongly suggest that you get yourself some books written on the subject of male and female communications, and REALLY learn how to properly TALK to a man.  It took me over 9 years to "train" my husband to LISTEN and how to talk so we BOTH understand each other.  Men and women ARE different - learn WHY and things WILL get better for the both of you - I promise!|`|VSVQHKwKaa	Only if you will respond as well as you did when you were dating.<br>  <br>  BUT REMEMBER ONE IMPORTANT THING.....<br>  <br>  <br>  He was initiating a physical interaction. In other words, while you might be under the impression that he was initiating an emotional relationship....<br>  <br>  ....he wasn't. You were.<br>  <br>  He was initiating a physical relationship. That's his job.<br>  <br>  The emotional relationship is your job to initiate.<br>  <br>  So if your question is "Why doesn't he make love to me?"....then the burden is on him.<br>  <br>  However, if you're (likely) referring to the emotional condition of your early relationship, then it's up to you.<br>  <br>  And, of course, emotions drive action far surer than vice versa.<br>  <br>  So get to work rebuilding the emotional love and intimacy of the relationship. Your husband will catch the cue and start courting you like your early days. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|3e817bbcd346c2c2745cc92bc09d0ef2aa	yep..it's all in the chase..he's got you now and he knows it|`|3mJiPveSaa	Not unreasonable.

Do you like both sides, I mean do you feel as though you're getting what you're missing from your wife with your EF, and vice versa?  Do you think your wife is a little rough around the edges and your relationship is all about sex?  Maybe she is lacking depth, intellectually speaking, and you feel devalued and used by her.  Your emotional friend is filling in the pieces that are missing in your relationship with the wife.  This seems to be working for you for the time being, but it seems like a temporary fix.  Sooner or late, something will have to give.  Underneath, you're not happy.  Take it from one who knows.|`|rqNb6FIraa	What's wrong with that?

RtkB46peaa	You're being a little insecure about this, but a little insecurity is nothing to worry about.

DooqYRfAaa	I agree with you, there's nothing wrong with hoping she'd offer to pay when the two of you go out.  You're both investing time and emotions in the relationship, why not share in the finances.  Just don't resort to dumb reasons to try and get her to pay, it's not worth it and it's lame.  Maybe you need to stop using the term "expect" when you think of this situation and change it to "hope".... this way when and if she doesn't offer, you won't feel as bothered.  Or, this is what she's like and she'll expect you to do everything for her.  Hope not.|`|xWqKKp0Naa	Hi there .

Most guys liked that idea too.|`|T9xbywGPaa	Hello Johns.  <br>  It seems there are many different ways to look at this. First, it will depend on how a person was raised and what they were taught. <br>  If you are more old fashioned, you were probably taught the guy usually pays for the dates. <br>  If you feel the woman should pay once in a while, you should probably make sure that is understood. <br>  What a relationship is for is to enjoy the person you are with, accepting each other for who you are and having someone to share your life with. If the relationship is past the dating stage, you should already know enough about each other and how you are to not even question who pays on a date.  :)<br>  Bottom line.. each person is different and dating is different from couple to couple. Just make sure you're both on the same page and there won't be any misunderstandings or upsets.|`|VZVGXRyraa	Maybe i'm just old fashioned but whenever my fiancee and i are together, i'm the one paying. It's been that way for 2 years.

If you want custody, get a lawyer, and start collecting evidence, affidavits, eye witness accounts of abuse, etc. Record everything.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	Depends on how old you are, if you can prove that your mother is unfit and whether or not you can support your siblings.<br>  <br>  I recommend you talk to a lawyer first (most offer a free consultation) and then to child services.|`|Fsbg8hbwaa	I'm a lil confused cause you say your brothers dad abused you guys too and now they're splitting up. This is not the man she is married to now? In order to get custody of them you would have to prove your mom unfit to have any of you. Then the court will look at where the kids should go. Are you 18 or older? That also makes a difference. Also the state you live in makes a different, every state has diff. rules. But first step if you really are serious is proving to authorities that your mom is unfit, you do that by telling what has happened w/privious boyfriends.|`|AA10928214	I think first, you are going to have to prove that you're mother is an "unfit mother" otherwise, why would they just give the children to you? Also, how old are you? You need to go talk to a lawyer and see what they can work out for you.
vffZ3is4aa	if you live alone and are moving in a roommate, yes you can move into the room you want. but do it before you find the roommate.<br>  if your roommate is moving out and a new roommate was shown their room, then they can expect that the room they are getting is the old room mates.
yM7YPmzSaa	I would put my career before any man but my family before a career!|`|8nRVvq0Jaa	I think I'd go for the guy of my dreams. My Mum is single and no matter how much she has or how much he works towards I'm sure she would rather be sharing it with a partner, now both kids have left home.<br>  <br>  Although 50K a year is tempting|`|ShwV6Ewfaa	i would go for the girl of my dreams .Money really doesn't mean much to me .whenever i do have it i just buy rubbish i don't need that clutters up my house .|`|jwvh48Raaa	I will take both, I refuse to compromise.|`|hHndD5SEaa	After the amount of guys Ive dated and had no luck with - Id go for the guy of my dreams!!!! <br>  <br>  xx
5agXk9ldaa	well i don't wanna lie to you, i am now in a relationship with a girl mmm she is not beautiful, but i donno her personality is awesome, she is funny, she likes things i do ...<br>  but deep inside i am so confused because i think no matter what also the outside look is important too|`|45UTKuamaa	Yes and they were a lot of fun. Some of my most memorable dates and I am married to one of them.and we still have fun after 20 yrs|`|c1i7Mn1Baa	Relationships like that tend to last the longest because they are based on something real and have a solid foundation.  Nobody stays handsome or beautiful forever on the outside.|`|v4xIauuYaa	laughter is better than boredom so yes I would go for personality|`|Tcc6T9xPaa	No not really.|`|8oKazGVGaa	yeh they sucked tho he cried too much|`|hk5f8yxVaa	Yes, but it ends up a bit rubbish because even though their personality was great, I just couldn't get aroused when it came to intimate matters.|`|1Am1STCWaa	I am still in school and i dont go out with people for there looks just for there personality!<br>  It will work out great!<br>  It did for me and i am sure it will for you!|`|ShDV45l1aa	lol, would u go out with the best looking, STUPIDEST PERSON IN THE WORLD?<br>  <br>  or the "medium looking" funny person that you LIKE?
UFOdwXgfaa	Sounds to me that he's not being completely honest with you. Sorry, I know it's not something you want to hear but just the fact that you stated that he takes up for her sounds a bit fishy to me.<br>  <br>  She wouldn't call the house if they weren't something going on. They are definitely on speaking terms.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	How long have you been dating?  I mean, after 10 years I would expect there to be some kind of contact during that initial breakup period...Hard to say...<br>  <br>  Add:  After 1-1/2 years, it's time he cuts the cord and drops contact to a minimum.  You are right - it's inappropriate.  Put an end to it - one way or another...|`|MuVKeK8faa	Sounds like she is working on getting back with him.  I'd watch out!|`|8103f5a386f35ec2420460c4f3b3dcabaa	on a wiser note; some relationships need to end..just end..no need to communicate..that way you can heal and move forward..|`|FtyLwqR5aa	Well PAST is what they are that's what they are suppose to stay. Calling him and then him sticking up for her when you have issues about it is totally inexcusable. He either wants her or he don't. If there are no kids involved they have no reason to be chatting. Then if there is kids it should be about the kids and hang up. I hate to say this to you but I wouldn't doubt that he wouldn't take her back and that that's what they are working on. Funny how a lady don't want them till they have someone else.|`|IKXZZDH9aa	Unless they have children together, she is an ex for a reason. I wouldn't mind periodic calls just to say hi, but constant calling etc...forget it.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  Well in that case, the proper reaction to him saying that he  wants to stay friends is to politely move the coffee table to the side, ask him to stand up, Suplex him followed by the People's Elbow.<br>  <br>  After opening that can of whoop *** on him, give him an ultimatum. Stop the contact, or the next time you're leaving.
e5f4c192231c92a0d059825b151f7553aa	Stop hiding it from him.<br>  <br>  He senses something is going on - but maybe not what - and the fact you are hiding things from him makes him feel annoyed, bad, and just like crap in general.|`|967a4775c02dc2dd40b45608b213d540aa	dump him.  obviously he is insensitive and cares more about how HE feels as oppose to helping YOU feel better.  Dump the jerk.|`|HzjeKsDJaa	dump the idiot,he obviously is not the right guy for you|`|kgIccwR0aa	just talk 2 him and change your approach towards his liking by asking him whats missing..|`|PccHbsKbaa	idk, dump him i guess|`|hnpw7xataa	Hi Lizzy<br>  I am sorry you are feeling depressed and i did not pick up on that at all when we chatted. I believe being honest is always the right thing to do no matter how much it hurts. He did not pick up on it you told him what was wrong and he did not like what you said to him. So his defense to what you said is to make you the bad girl and tell you that your making him feel like ****.  Honestly you need to think of what is important to you and only you at this stage, because what you see now only gets worst after you are married. If i was you i would sit down and make a list of what is important to you and what it not and then make another list of what his good parts are and what it not. Then make a list of your good parts and what are your bad parts. Then take both lists and see if any of yours match any of his, i bet his list has nothing in common with yours.|`|fYvFtFG0aa	i think maybe the reason he's feeling bad is that he can see the way you're feeling, but you won't talk to him about it, so he might be feeling like you're not opening up to him, and shutting him out. i think you need to talk to him, and ask him why he feels like that. you just both need to talk through what you want from each other and work it out. good luck anyways xXx|`|efaa0047164a56b968f37aa30f7ffc74aa	i"d say talk to him it can be hard at times but it really helps. He can tell something is bothering you and even if it has something to do with him its better to tell him sooner then later because it could get a lot worse.|`|c695e3d842e5ce7f37359934a75d6b3caa	Talk to him.  Have him tell you what he needs from you.  Tell him what you need from him.  He could also be playing a game with your head in an attempt to Control you.|`|22RHxwVmaa	I think that's all you can do<br>  but maybe talking to him about whatever it is that's making you upset will help some more :]|`|CaDdKyERaa	GIVE A HARD SLAP TO HIM....and say that '' U are selfish''|`|AA10481071	move love should fix it
WAgGp0hLaa	he still love u|`|AeLT0lLFaa	Just ignore him, he probably wants you as his booty call./|`|10114ae4ad291d214b18ee10bbfc8bfeaa	He is expressing him self through the song..
AA11363993	I would say she is very attached to you and at that age is very upset to leave you.  I would keep correcting her and telling her "daddy". In a  few months she will get it.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	No - not abnormal at all!  Kids go through that stage around 18 months.  Here's a current example - <br>  <br>  I help take care of my (18 month old) niece for a couple of hours on Wednesdays.  My sister is pregnant so I've been helping out more (she's due any day now...) and my niece is comfortable and appears happy about spending time with me and her older cousin (my 8 yo daughter).  When I drop off my niece or leave the house - she throws the biggest temper tantrum - every time!  Does it mean she doesn't want my sister or her dad?  NO!  It's just normal for the age and stage...<br>  <br>  Don't sweat it!  Normal...|`|t7AIAXo9aa	So she prefers you over her mother? She doesn't like or want the attention of her mother? Hmmm..sounds like me as a baby. I still don't get along with my Mom and have never had a bond or anything with her. We just don't get along. I much prefer my Dad, but the motherly figure in my life would have to be my Aunt. Make sure your daughter at least has some type of motherly figure in her life, I don't know what you can do about how she reacts to her real Mother though...I still don't get along with mine!!|`|u1uECuFNaa	At that age, kids pick a favorite. They want to be with that person always...<br>  My kids picked me, thank goodness. I do not handle rejection well.  :) They also are around three other people, at least with mom...so it is natural to want to be the center of attention.<br>  You need to correct her about you being daddy....<br>  My son started calling me by my first name for a while. I changed that as soon as I could.|`|b7bb85526b028b7f92b16c8204ed4012aa	No problem here. Shes just forming the boundaries of her young life. Shes experimenting as to see what and whom she can control and get away with. Shes wy too young to fully really understand whats she is doing or her world round her so shes learning. Now if she was 17 years old then Id worry but for the next couple years shes just getting to know her world, but kids will be kids. You must be a first time daddy by asking this, so youre learning too just as she is. Enjoy and have fun, the worst is yet to come
Ddn9I9v3aa	I get turned on by having my **** sucked|`|AA11200879	yes i too get turnd on like dis|`|FBGMKdqKaa	I think it's a general erogenous zone for every female?
VMY7No0eaa	wow.. hard to think this out.<br>  had to draw it out... <br>  can you give a better discription?<br>  I think you are shirt tail relitives..= nothing but not sure.<br>  <br>  You have to have BLOOD relitives in common... in laws don't count.|`|89be3656aab8efef76257e64df83b534aa	second cousins, if they have your blood, removed if they do not|`|Oz5F8Alfaa	i think it called "second cousin". this mean you both are not directly related.  you just have been to have the same aunt and uncle but you each from different side of the aunt and uncle family.
n0FDgpTyaa	Just explain to him that you were asleep and didn't intentionally miss the calls. It isn't as though you were ignoring him. <br>  tell him that you hope that he is feeling better, and that you owe him one. Next time, come to his rescue.|`|SIiv5ttAaa	My advice. . .  Try not to think about it too much sure you didn't go but it's not because you didn't want to people who dwell on these kind of things tend to try to make up for it and in turn end up making the situation worse. . .  So in other words just let the subject die you will have a chance to help him later in life maybe when he really needs it so don't worry life is short enjoy it while you can. . .|`|jc1RJirqaa	You shouldn't feel like you let him down because you had no control over the situation...However, you do feel like this, so I think you should do something for him that's extra special!|`|iJbslaQNaa	:(|`|sr0vZPQqaa	You didn't hear the phone so not a lot you could have done.|`|AA11032586	You need to let him know you are truly sorry and that you honestly did not here the phone. Let him know you are very glad he is o.k. now. There is no need in feeling bad.
vEiaoR3Saa	Just go to him today.<br>  <br>  You should surprise him with a visit.<br>  <br>  Get him something,<br>  Or just spend qaulity time.<br>  <br>  Make sure he knows that at any time you will try to be there it's just that you couldn't at the time.<br>  <br>  <br>  Let him know, it wasn't just because you didn't feel like it.
cL34EiMWaa	Well, I am a Christian, and it would be my opinion that yes it is possible. Just take it slow and pray about it. I really would like to say that I'm very happy you found God and accepted Him. Nobody is perfect and girls will still date you even with that past. Your past can't define you, especially if you're trying to better yourself and improve upon past mistakes. Just take it slow with relationships. Build your relationship with God and seek Him out and He'll carry you through the tough times. He's got someone special for you, so don't worry too much. Just be patient and let it happen. Often, you'll find what you're looking for when you're not expecting it and you haven't been searching so hard for it. God bless, and I hope this helps :)|`|SsjXGhL2aa	Of Course the past, is the past and knowing you went threw so much of this, it would make you a better man, someone in my family had a Very tough past and he now live's the best life. He is great and i think no matter what past you got Babe you can have any woman you want. Your past does not make any difference Especially if she's the one, Don't worry Babe! ;)|`|KyHYOKmQaa	Yes, if he had truly left that life behind him. However, I would never date a religious person, but I guess that's beside the point. You are really young, it's great you got your life together, keep it up and I'm sure you'll get plenty of girls ;)!|`|44Z2JGeCaa	Fo Sho! I think bad a**es are hot. If you're being respectful to women and are mentally stable now there's no reason not to date you. People always change, I mean if you really knew me....hahahah that's a different story. I used to be like a cup size B like two years ago and now I'm like a D. Just saying...|`|mVMk80oeaa	I would... Just be honest and don't think of the past. It's gone and there's nothing you can do to change that now. If you find a great girl and you're honest with her, maybe she'll be able to help you get through it. <br>  Best of Luck!|`|nKmuwKJ2aa	ur past is just a part of being u and it doesnt mean thats the whole u as a person. <br>  for me, yes, i will. the important is the future.|`|VEgqq1wRaa	definately :D<br>  <br>  As long as you share that, anyone would be crazy not to go out with you.|`|Uss6h5C7aa	m srry bt i wud nt .....<br>  its 2 risky kind of a thing .....<br>  if u hv a brk up nd again do all ddese stuffs which u mentioned den all da things nd blames wud be on me !!!!|`|I1tnVvVGaa	i would!!|`|xmWxafHSaa	Yes.  Everyone deserves a second chance.  Learning from you past mistakes is what life is all about.  No one is perfect and we have all made mistakes or have regrets but you learn from them and that is what makes you a better person.  <br>  <br>  You have your entire life ahead of you, as you get older those days will be a distant memory as you grow into maturity.  So don't give yourself a hard time, forgive yourself, like Christ has forgiven you.|`|Q2UDhYgkaa	Just dont tell them about your past until you get to know them - it might turn them off if you tell them too soon but once they already know you it won't.<br>  <br>  Hello - you feel wrong for looking at porn? 99 per cent of guys look at it.<br>  <br>  As for cutting yourself that doesnt mean you're a bad person it just means you were going through some hard times and you deserve some good times after them. Good luck.|`|jROpVbrhaa	Yes of course, i believe in the saying that theres always a room for improvement.So the mere fact that you told your past, and regret a lot, it only shows how to prove your craft.Anyway good luck and God bless.|`|S4QBvAaGaa	Honestly it depends on how bad it was. I think certain people may be more sensitive to negative things in your past than others and could never see the new person you are without thinking of the person you were. If you'd like it to be less of an issue in future relationships, I think it would be best not to mention it unless someone asks and when you feel your relationship is becoming serious or you would like it to, let them know then because people tend to take it the wrong way if you tell em' later or they find out without you.<br>  Personally, your past is better than mine but I wouldn't try to cast judgment on who you were, as long as you didn't leave any babies or dead bodies or anything particularly gruesome behind.<br>  Good Luck! :)|`|ahjqc9Ifaa	I am willing to give a person a second chance--but I'm wary, too, because people who want to change their behavior often don't stick with the new regimen but backslide, sometimes permanently.<br>  <br>  I'm not part of your dating pool, but if I were, I'd date you only after you'd been a different person than the old you for a year or more without a slip, and only after we'd been friends for several months at least.<br>  <br>  Fully do-able. Best of luck with the turn-around.|`|776143369bb290accd3ea9aa251e66c9aa	There's a difference between you're definition of "bad" and mine.  Looking at porn and being rebellious aren't really on my list of horrible things.  Sounds like you were a normal teenager with a bad attitude.  <br>  <br>  I wouldn't date a guy who used to beat up his ex, had been to prison or sold drugs, or was a recovering addict.  That's a bad past.|`|c695e3d842e5ce7f37359934a75d6b3caa	I am proud of your accomplishments at a young age.  It is very difficult on teens today with all the pressures you have to face to do certain things that are harmful.  dating-I know me, I look at the present accomplishments to judge dateability by.  The past gives a little insight-but a true dating possibility will not jusge you by your past only.  If she does she isn't worth your time of day or a second glance.  <br>  Good luck and great job!|`|t3G5xSbIaa	OF COURSE! lol seriously it would be great to meet someone like taht who puts away his past and changes for the future and present. cuz u know relatonships always have probs cuz the guy never changes but oh man u changed big time u got ma total respect! gd luck with all u do hun!|`|YfsqXG3naa	we have all a light and dark side and the most important is the present time , just be honest and sincere with the girl if she asks you about your past , good luck !|`|y9TvRvs6aa	Yeah of course. Just be honest, and let her know that its in the past, and you're just concentrating on healing at the moment.|`|izjQ5lzTaa	I'm a christian.<br>  well, i would only date you if you prove to me that you won't go back to the past (what you did) and confess your sins.|`|dU4IPBO0aa	Everyone has a past, its the future that really counts tho!!!  Yes, I would date a man with a past.|`|l2iqJbZKaa	I would date you.
NuUdCz0Laa	Actually I think the counseling should start before the marriage.  Like you I have been divorced before, I am not proud of my choices or my decisions, but in the end, I finally got it right and find myself now in a very happy loving relationship.  But it would be very helpful to hear all this and to ask all the questions before we say, I DO.|`|2b0a3200c0db672cf39c688cc41d456caa	Divorce is the easy way out for most.  We've become a society built around convenience, and most would rather give up on something rather than put in the work needed to make it right.  I think counseling would help alot of people that want to get a divorce, but they just don't want to invest the time/effort needed to make a marriage work.  Sad.|`|VhHVjMe8aa	I think it should be harder for people to get married.  That's when the counseling should happen.  If it was harder to get married maybe less people would get divorced?|`|yd2SP7d6aa	Some States have a separation period before granting a divorce and most divorces do take a bit of time.  I personally don't think the problem can be fixed by making divorce harder to come by, the problem is with the way people have been raised.<br>  <br>  <br>  Taking responsibility is NOT a strong point in our society & catering to our selfishness is.  How can you hope to form a long & lasting marriages with those attitudes running rampant(those marriages are doomed to fail regardless of counseling or not.  Those attitudes are ingrained and are hard to break)?|`|3SSVBJAqaa	I think it depends on the situation. No one should stay in an abusive or controlling relationship. I also don't believe counseling should be forced upon a couple when one has cheated (they possibly put their spouses life in danger that way).|`|4HoVVCenaa	Depends on whether  you believe in personal freedom or a police state. I know that sounds like an over the top statement, but most government comes down to that. The questions is always, who makes the rules, who benefits, and who is harmed. Your operating assumption is that most are not able to make their own decisions in this arena. But then who is?
afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	I think divorce should be a lot harder to get. i also think it should be a lot harder to get married. I think there should be some kind of prepatory class to take and both parties should have to go. People rush into marriage without thinking. I agree some times divorce is nessacary in the event of abuse but other then that it should be worked out.|`|wia9SXCPaa	I think if you made it easier to get a divorce more people would be divorced and if you made it harder then maybe a few less people would be divorced.  Some places require counseling before court.  The bottom line here is what you are willing to put into a marriage is probably what your going to get out of it.<br>  <br>  It is easy to get a divorce, but takes a lot a hard work to stay happy in a marriage.|`|efbb15bd3b273c3e6801e5fe2b1add09aa	I think they should also have counseling BEFORE getting married, part of the problem is how little thought goes into a marriage to begin with and how we lack common sense as a society|`|BuyzuOEjaa	I think at times divorced is too easy or other times they just got married too fast|`|NeTNnvSZaa	I think it should be harder to get married.<br>  <br>  But that being said, even under the most ideal circumstances marriages fail and prolonging the end isn't going to help anyone.|`|IQ50BJ0Waa	It wouldn't matter if it was harder. People would then just stop going the legal/proper route. I know a couple that hasn't lived to together for at least four years, they have a child but no custody issues, there is nothing preventing them from getting a quick painless divorce but they never have and probably never will. <br>  <br>  If it were harder you would see a lot of "married" people with second families all over the place - the institution of marriage would be threatened. I know what you are saying about it being too easy to give up when things are hard but I don't think there is a solution.

UpRdvpmXaa	I know a family that has 9 children and the way that all of these children have come into their lives has been such a blessing and I love visiting them. They're 9 of the most well-behaved and kind hearted children you'll ever meet. <br>  My neighbor's name is Lisa and she's married to her husband Tyler. They thought they couldn't have children and set about trying to adopt a child. Well, soon after their interview, they were introduced to this little girl who was 3 years old. Lisa said when they came home they just knew that that was their little girl. When they returned, they were told that the little girl was from an abused home and that she had 5 sisters (not much older...at the time the older girls were 4, 5, 6, 8 and a baby sister 8 months). Long story short (cause it was a really long story full of obstacles), they met with the children and fell in love with them and adopted them all. Lucky for them, their careers allow it financially, she's a nurse anesthetic and he's a dentist. <br>  <br>  A year later...surprise surprise...they got pregnant with twins and had their two sons. Got pregnant again only 2 months after having had the boys and had a little girl. The children are now 12, 10, 9, 8, 7, 4, 3, 3, 2. <br>  They both say that they love having a large family and even though it all came to them unexpectedly, they wouldn't change anything. There is a lot of love in that house and I hope I can only be half the father that man is to his 9 children. You always see them in the backyard together playing around. Its something to see a dentist crawl on the grass with three kids on his back while his wife does pedicures on the oldest girls.|`|3yWAyps4aa	Who cares as long as am having sex!|`|i15KoiJhaa	I am one shy of 5 Kids... <br>  <br>  I have 4 Kids... 2 Biologically mine, and 2 Step Kids.<br>  They range from age 6-13 (almost 14!)<br>  <br>  So, I didn't necessarily make the decision to have 4 Kiddo's... but I did make the decision to marry my Husband and as loves and accepts "Mine" I love and accept "His"
AA11730284	Idk, i feel the same way about my crush, like one minute i like him and the next i think he's ugly/hate him. I think it's just mixed emotions about the boy. I'm trying to forget that i liked him and just find another guy to like, that won't make me double think my decision, you should do the same.|`|WLLvMY3iaa	let myself grow up.|`|9p9DDRSnaa	now you know what its like to be married!  lol|`|lzooHi0Baa	You have the symptoms of a masochist.   He has to do something bad, creating hatred in you before you can love him.   That is being masochist.   Address this issue early in your life and renew your mind as far as why hatred is a reason for love.  Might sound very confusing and maybe crazy but I know what I am talking about, I am only trying to help you.   You can test yourself in other areas, for instance, is your best friend the one that upsets you the most and  the one that mistreats you and even talks about you behind your back?  If so, then I am right|`|tPRRUs4Jaa	i'm sure you don't actually love him or hate him. you're probably about 12 years old. so i would say you really don't do anything about it, there's nothing you can do except try to control yourself more and not freak out about it like you seem to be doing.|`|scnW0Wzeaa	Move on. You don't know what you want.|`|4G5KZSY6aa	go meet a doctor.|`|d617gOaUaa	You're not sure about him. It's the hating part, the chase, the drama that makes you THINK you like him|`|UIhbJjQFaa	because you hate the fact you love him

But i can help u on the rest:)<br>  <br>  If i were u i wouldn't say do u wanna go out with me coz that could sound maybe a lil desperate but u could say sumin like hey u wanna go out somewhere 2nite....jst sumin along those lines! coz this makes sure a knows u like him and if he really likes u he will say yes and then let him take over so let him pick you up etc and pay of course!<br>  <br>  I would ask whenever u think it's right ...if it was me i would ask before and if he really liked u he would wait as long as it takes ....also when u get back he will be really happy to be with u !<br>  <br>  Have a great time in America <br>  Hope this helps|`|n7BuH75gaa	Forget about going out with him.<br>  Cut to the chase.<br>  In school grab him and drag him in a secluded spot and shag his brains out.<br>  Make sure you grab a couple cigarettes for afterwards.<br>  Have fun...oh, and be safe too!

Sorry!<br>  But.. what you can do...<br>  Ask one of his closest friends or any of his friends if he talks about you in good ways. If he does.. then ask them to ask him if he will ask you out. tell them that you really like him and then they will tell him that and hoepfully he'll ask you out.<br>  <br>  he wont do it himself, but im sure his friends will!<br>  <br>  and do it after you come back :D|`|XphTDpR7aa	Just to make things clear...when a girl asks me out I don't get horney if thats what your asking, but then again I'm the guy and I usually do the asking.For the sake of the question I would ask him out now, hand with him for a while, and then when you have to leave text him like there is now tomm! <@:)|`|0cAL60hMaa	yes defo ask him! and before you go, because you might be to late when you come back and 1 month is a long time you might change your mind or he might of gone off you so do it asap! :D|`|zTEkHvlFaa	Do it!!! ...

SPhq1BFUaa	I can't really tell you what the answer will be because I only really know part of the situation, there are tons of other factors that come into play. But based on what you've said it seems like he would say yes. I don't really think that your or his size will play that big of a factor if any at all in his decision. I know a couple who we're together for 2 years who are the exact same height as both of you. Anyways just ask him. I seriously doubt he'll turn you down.
8QEtcKhnaa	Feel blessed he loves the life you two created together and cherish every moment of that. when he comes home things will be more at ease for you. Once you are able to make love and watch television together and do all the normal things you would do together but now with a little one, you'll see how things fall back into place.<br>  <br>  Also try mentioning a few things to him. Like " I miss your warm body next to me" things like that to hint around that you miss him in more ways than just being a father too. <br>  <br>  Best wishes|`|kqa9VFrfaa	The baby is a big deal, so feel blessed that he cares. He is at a disadvantage because he is not there to touch and hold the baby, so his interest is perfectly natural. When he comes home he will love both of U, just in different ways. How he relates to the baby also depends if it is a girl or a boy. He will feel more tender toward a little girl. Try not to worry so much. There will be better times ahead.|`|89be3656aab8efef76257e64df83b534aa	it's called the madonna syndrome, or similar. he now sees you as his mother/the mother of his child/ren. if you are to resume coitus you must seduce him again and not appear as the 'mother' which, obviously, does not attract him.|`|wvzQObahaa	well , you can add spices to the relationship ! like buy some sexy cloths, new haircut or color ! invite him out for a romantic date ! <br>  i think some sexy lingerie will do the trick  (with beer)!!!!!!!!
uC2OAc4Kaa	Ok, I would tell her "Hey _______ Is being really rude right now I wouldn't hang out with her" and if she ask why say "well she is saying _____________________________ about you etc" and tell her you will be there for her.
J9LZwAMraa	Well i mean if he does both its still pretty wrong, i don't even think one beats the other because he obviously is tying to impress other girls when your not around.<br>  <br>  If you have found this out, i dont think you should break up with him but i do think you should really talk to him and understand WHY he is doing what he is doing... You should not allow this.<br>  <br>  Also i think if he is doing this he maybe looking for attention from you and other girls. Like he is getting attention from other girls in the short run but he knows he will get caught, and that will lead to more attention from you?<br>  <br>  Idk there are million other reasons he might be doing this... Just talk to him.<br>  <br>  Good Luck,<br>  Drew|`|72UNDrwkaa	they would both be bad, and if i found out my bf was doing either of them i would end it with him xx|`|AA10928214	Yeah, because why would someone that supposedly loves you (because he's you're boyfriend) say nasty things about me behind my back? That's not love. And if he likes you, he's not going to tell another girl he doesn't have a girlfriend. And if he does, he doesn't like you and is just trying to sleep with someone else.|`|NxZl1Qccaa	yes i would be, and i would break up with him,obviously he doesn't respect me as his gf. and telling nasty things is worse.|`|rDFnsFf2aa	BAD THINGS BEHIND YOUR BACK|`|CkuJ5vbmaa	yes i would<br>  bad things behind ur back...

UOLj2jldaa	This is an easy question. i went through the procedure when i was 19, The best decision i ever made. The difference is it a health issue you fill cleaner less chances of bacterial build up around the penis area. for me my size actually increased. And some ladies who like to give orally it works much better for them.|`|fQYU96euaa	You know, there is nothing wrong with a natural uncut member, when your erect its nearly the same. I wouldn't go through with a circumcision, there are complications that can happen and they really arent worth it.|`|sCCjAKllaa	You're not going to regret it, though I don't know if there will be pain. You'll love it in the end.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	From a woman's perspective: a circumcised penis doesn't feel any different to a woman than a non-circumcised penis.  <br>  <br>  I've had both, and in my experience, a man who is not circumcised has a much higher level of sensation than a circumcised man.<br>  <br>  Why would you want to go through the pain of circumcision now for no reason?  There is no reason for an adult man to undergo this procedure unless there is a medical necessity for it.  Keep your foreskin.  It's the way you were meant to be.|`|835887bcb03d75a14ac83bf2c7e41048aa	1 is hygiene. The skin must be washed under frequently, not to say that men who are circumcised have to wash less. Also penile cancer can result in uncircumcised men. I would think that most partners would prefer circumcised, it is neater in appearance, no hanging skin to peel back, and will increase your sexual satisfaction. It can be painful, but in the end, should be worth it.|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	I prefer circumcised, its prettier to look at without all that extra flappy skin, and oral sex is sooooo much better for the same reason.<br>  My fiance is circumcised and its clean, healthy and I know I can go down there any time I want and have no "skanky" surprises, what goes on under all that extra hanging skin makes me want to heave.<br>  Have it done ladies will love it.|`|4o3jXz3Waa	I have never been with an uncircumcised man, but I have heard that for the man, sex is more pleasurable when he is uncircumcised.  I don't really think it makes a difference for a woman, though I can't speak from personal experience.|`|OBCvewW2aa	There is no reason to be circumcised.  It's an extremely painful and barbaric procedure and serves no purpose whatsoever.<br>  <br>  P.S.  If you don't know what you're doing, no amount of snipping will make up for it.|`|K6vEbdqxaa	I've only been with one man that was not circumcised, and I have to say that I definitely prefer the circumcised variety!

hEcKmleVaa	Your ex is immature and doesn't know what he wants. He has a history of toying with his former gf's heart (breaking up 20 times?)  It sounds like he doesn't want to explain anything to you, he just wanted out for whatever reason. But he doesn't really deserve pleasantries from you under the circumstances.  I wouldn't acknowledge his texts or attempts to be friendly.  He lost that priviledge.  His timing was also inconsiderate--the day before Valentine's Day?? Nice guy.|`|i4bjQbPcaa	It's sounds like you are better off out of this one.  He did exactly the same to his ex girlfriend.  He doesn't care about anyone but himself, it is boosting his ego knowing he can get you back everytime he does this.<br>  <br>  Ignore him and you will learn to live without him|`|0SoDvjU7aa	he's an attention seeking twat tha constantly needs re-assuring.....PLEASE BE AWARE.......this type of bloke usually turns into the wife beater or jealous controlling manipulating boyfriend that feels he has to put you down regularly in order to keep you under control.........DUMP HIM!!!!......help him learn from his mistakes!!!!|`|jBZJkSjWaa	...sounds like he has some growing up to do...|`|eic9fd2Qaa	will form this decripiton i get that if he phoned you up b4 valentines day, firstly if he didnt want 2 give u a present like spent money this is what he would do i think, but we dnt know if he got you anything, i think the best ling 2 do would be to sit down and talk 2 him, ask him what he sees yous like in a year. you should be looking at him and asking yourself do i see me with him in a yeart maby 2 years, if your answer is yes and his is also yes and yous talk about how your going to stay close and not flll out, then yous are emtn to be, but if you feel you dont no if yous are going to be, maby this relationship isnt the best, you could be missing out on the guy that is really ment for, you and you will know for defent when this guy comes along. Thanks|`|yiUNN8ADaa	It sucks that I have to say this, but he probably breaks up with you all the time so he can go screw around with other chicks and not feel guilty about it. Your guy sounds like a dog. I wouldn't give him the time of day. He just likes playing with your emotions and it's wrong. Don't fall into his trap! Spend your time with men who are going to appreciate you and treat you like a goddess. There ARE men out there that can do that for you.|`|EteRTWkfaa	i know how you feel because  my boyfriend does the same thing! it sucks and confuses tha hell out of you huh? well just sit down and talk to him make him talk about it and work it out let him know how you really feel about all of this! GOOD LUCK! :)|`|9YQVIolwaa	he's cheating on u....  leave him...|`|Z07EMEBIaa	He wants you to keep running back to him. It seems that he feels by constantly breaking up with you, he is reasurred when you are upset and want him back, as it lets him know that he is wanted. He seems quite insecure about relationships as i think he might fear that you are going to be the one that breaks up with him, and he would find it hard to deal with that - maybe he has a huge ego, or maybe he has problems with feeling wanted. I would really think hard about how you feel about this guy, and if you decide you really love him, then you need to talk to him about his problem and let him know hoe you feel. If you decide you dont love him, then i would walk away and end all the trouble<br>  <br>  Hope this helps and good luck for the future - remember, its your life, don't sacrifice your happiness for someone who wont return the love|`|AA10283947	He's a low life low down twerp who doesn't deserve a girl on his arm, flick him off like a speck of dust that's heading for the gutter to be washed away and disregarded.

6d718b2ca0424bba8e88fd0bd7a40273aa	You can have a lovely, hand-made programs that will dictate the course of activities. This way you can have two languages in the program so everyone can understand. Also, if you have a bridesmaid or the mother of the bride/groom can do announces. Since you probably won't be a big space someone can just tap their glass to announce the next activity/event. <br>  <br>  As for the order, it is entirely up to you to decide on the rhythm of your party. Look at a couple of bridal sites like brides.com and gather the events of a reception and pick and choose what you want to do and in what order. For example, I had no idea that there was a father/daughter dance or a already married dance, a prayer of grace for the food and marriage, and special music needed for the cake cutting. I didn't realize I needed any of this until I visited weddingwire.com. They have a list of the different ceremony and reception activities that music accompanies. <br>  <br>  Any way, you can keep this incredibly simple by choosing a choice number of activities and spreading them out. Good luck!|`|yN8vmGSnaa	You and your fiance just talk about it and decide.

Just keep in mind that the cutting of the cake traditionally signifies that the wedding is over, so many people will leave at the point.<br>  <br>  You can also have a program (at each place setting or one at each table) which will tell guests the order of the evening (times are not needed), something like:<br>  <br>  Cocktails<br>  The Bride & Groom Arrive & Share Their First Dance<br>  Toasts (if you want)<br>  Dinner (if you're having a sit down meal)<br>  Dancing<br>  Cake Cutting (and then explain the tradition, especially if some guests will not know it)<br>  Bride & Groom Depart|`|3M3htWrBaa	i think that you should have the wedding (of curse) and then you should have your best man do the mc part next you should cut the cake and have your first dance or the other way around just remember it is your special day you can plan it how ever you want.<br>  <br>  best of luck|`|P0OV39nuaa	I agree with asking the best man to help out with announcements. <br>  Also, I would do the dance first and then cut the cake after dinner.|`|lgxE5nUoaa	You can choose to do those things at any time.<br>  <br>  When my husband and I got married, we immediately walked into the reception hall and cut the cake.  Then we had dinner and afterwards, we danced our first dance.  We also did not do the bouquet throw or garter toss.<br>  <br>  It's your wedding, you can do anything you want.|`|q8eue7CRaa	Could a friend ask as MC when the time is needed? If you have a best man, could he help out with that?<br>  <br>  Try to get a rough timeline planned out for the evening of the sequence of the events so the MC knows when he should announce each thing. If you have an ipod, I'd suggest having music on the whole time.

zD2NWrIzaa	you could build a single story extension on the side or back of your house|`|Tyi6rEtcaa	I'd add it outside of the living area, if possible.  A pad poured for the enclosure, and landing, enclosed walls, and a freight/construction sort of lift like on job-sites for workers and materials.  Wouldn't be fancy, but functional.  Heck, a chain hoist with electrically powered gears for the chain, used to pull up, or slowly lower a platform, ought to turn the trick.  If you mounted pipes for "tracks" the platform, or car, really, would travel on, and used bearings to roll up and down them, it would seem fairly simple to accomplish such a feat.  Weld a bracket to brace the runners, and fasten the hoist in the center of a peaked brace atop the outer framework, voila'.<br>  PEACE

Someone else will offer to throw you a party (or not, in some parts of the country it's not traditional).<br>  <br>  If you're throwing one for someone else, figure out your budget and then ask them for a guest list (don't assume you know who to invite, as it's rude to invite someone who is not going to be invited to the wedding, unless it's an office party in a place where such parties are frequently thrown).  It can be as casual as a party at your home with appetizers and drinks, or as formal as a sit down meal at a restaurant.|`|6d718b2ca0424bba8e88fd0bd7a40273aa	Well we are having an incredibly small engagement party. Actually, I've never been to one. In my family, everyone spreads the word about an engagement and then they wait for the wedding invitations. So, I'm simply having a dinner with my fiance's family and my family. I'm going to cook a 4 course meal, a sit-down dinner/lunch. Or we are thinking about having a small get together/cook-out at our place. He will tell his parents so they will know to come and I'm going to tell my parents. <br>  <br>  Usually, however, if you are planning a large event,l you decide on a budget, guest list, and theme. You plan according to those guidelines. It can be at a house/restaurant and it's basically a party with appetizers. You can send out invitations when you are done getting your particulars in order.|`|mkrKHQvFaa	First set your budget<br>  Tou need to figure out a guest list and estimated head count.<br>  Next figure out how extragagent or cozie you want it (ie someones living room/back yard or a nice restraunt/tea house).<br>  Figure out your location and date and reserve it (or use someones house)<br>  Purchase invites and mail them<br>  Purchase decor and figure out games<br>  Purchase your food/set up plans with your caterer.<br>  <br>  It is just like planning a birthday party honestly with a different twist on it.

Change is needed or else I'd kick him to the curb.|`|ryOXYF8uaa	he sounds like an arogant pig that you could do without.<br>  i would imagine myself as his mirror image and behave the same way.<br>  see how he likes a taste of his own medicine<br>  <br>  xxxxx|`|goe3y4FPaa	well.. u could move on.. and come to me..  or  hes gonna keep doing that.. some guys are just nutz..|`|pYomxgYfaa	Looks to me like arrogance isn't the problem, disrespect is. <br>  <br>  He doesn't respect the privacy of your sex life, and he doesn't respect you as his girlfriend. If he goes around hitting on other girls, then he clearly doesn't care how you feel.<br>  <br>  What I would do is hit on other guys in front of him. If he makes a big deal, tell him you thought it was okay, since he did it to other girls. It will make him think twice. <br>  <br>  If he doesn't care, then he doesn't care about you or the relationship. If you're cool with that, then I guess just take it for what it is, and don't bother stressing over it.<br>  <br>  If it bothers you, then the best thing you could do is get out of the relationship and find someone who will respect you and treat you the way you deserve to be treated. <br>  <br>  Good luck :)|`|2R1dYsUKaa	sounds like you got a grade A dick head for a boyfriend.....if anything i'd try talking to him about it so you can possibly fix things.....communication is key a relationship..if you don't have it then your relationship is bound to fail....and if he interrupts you on your one on one smack that ***** and tell him to keep quite lol jk but it'd be funny to see.well hope things work out for you.|`|ShwV6Ewfaa	He sounds like an idiot and it doesn't sound like he has any respect for you at all and sex is a private thing between you and him so if he thinks it is appropriate to discuss it with his mates you need to ditch him he's a looser hunni|`|60f46466d2dd728810388e09955b9b12aa	leave him and concentrate on studies and carrer,you will get better boyfriend later.|`|kQ2PkJEeaa	dump him . simple|`|okXvWN5haa	its something that you guys have to work on a couple together. if he is not willing to change some of the things that he does that you do not like. then its not worth you trying hard for. but if he really loves you and cares about your feelings then he should be open to trying to fix things. and maybe you both are just stressed out from school. just spend a weekend together out of town and spend time for just the two of you. or if you dont have enough time for the weekend, all you need is a night or day together. but you have to sit down and talk to him and remind him of the things that he is doing that you do not like. because he could have just fogotten about them getting caught up in everything that is going on. good luck
OAYaeW22aa	the anser is to be with you. thats why guys lie|`|7at1Hyn8aa	How exactly is he lying?  What do you know about him, that he is not aware of?<br>  The fact that you want to know everything has me thinking you are insecure too.<br>  The only thing that he should be straight forward about is any sexually transmitted diseases he might have.  And, in most peoples eyes, withholding part of the truth is not lying.<br>  How does it improve your relationship if you know exactly how many girls he slept with, and what he did with them?  Did he want to know the same about you?<br>  <br>  There is a difference between telling all and telling what's important.|`|b3c054cf8a809cd78b23404a2feecb7daa	Either he has slept with too many or he hasn't slept with many at all. If its the first (too many) then he may think that you'll be turned off by the huge number (which you probably will, cos I know I would be). If he hasn't slept with many, or worse still is a virgin, then hes probably ashamed of his lack of experience. Either way, you may need to question him about this in the most subtle way you can. Not knowing his sexual past can lead to vulnerability on your part.|`|89d3bf3b50a93d03e19347179f7c0974aa	It may be alot of things. He may feel embarassed or insecure about it. He may think it will freak you out and scare you off. He may not care to tell you. Everyone has thing in their past they arent proud about and dont want you to judge them based on that.|`|dfBbvqb0aa	There shouldn't be a good reason why a guy lies about this past relationships. And if he's unhappy about taking about them lots. I think that shows he's not ready to have a romantic relationship any gurl because COMMUNICATION is a big time / important in a relationship.|`|f19757f068ee9d5da83bede3d9db780eaa	He is probably embarassed or has something to hide.|`|w8QkrUhBaa	he might be insecure or embarassed.|`|099f9932fda7deca1bf90d1e23d79b0eaa	Just to maintain relationship with you which otherwise he may loose if he discloses about his previous adventures.|`|NQFV2AdZaa	He probably is embarrassed or still hurting over past relationships and would hate to admit his mistakes to you. The past is gone, it's the future that's important and your time with him now. Leave the past where it belongs and enjoy spending time with each other now as life's too short to waste fretting about what happened before you both met, good luck!
dcb024b5e2b5c65f694bdddd3199db68aa	All you can do is strive to be a better man then you were yesterday.<br>  You do that for a few years and you will of learned from your past and move past it at the same time.|`|YAiKlPkMaa	The past is just that, the past. We cannot change things that happened or things that we said. Stop thinking about it, think on happy things you have planned for the future. Forget about the cheating event, it's unproductive and a waste of precious time.|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	i know you say you cant but honesty is the only way for true happiness. Once yo uconfess and tell her everything you will finally have that burden off your chest. if you continue to hide it then it will get harder everyday.|`|lJhl3wLAaa	Set it free my friend. Set it free. Your past is the past. You are allowing it to control you now. If you want to be free of it then let it go. <br>  Any time you start to think of the bad redirect yourself to the good. Put on some great music, dance around, go for a walk, do a puzzle, paint. Anything to change your mood and mind.|`|sCCjAKllaa	You have to just look at the past as just that: The past. It has no influence on what you can do now, and the present is the most important thing. You'll be fine.|`|2f5664fd06e95438a1ca5a49001a260caa	I don't personally believe in forgetting about your past.  I like to use my past mistakes as lessons learned to build on a new future.  But don't dwell in the mistakes you made.  You realize now that they were mistakes, so that should be enough.  <br>  <br>  If being unfaithful really still bothers you but you are not willing to talk to your partner about it, maybe you could find someone else to talk about it with...conselor, preacher, friend who can keep his/her mouth shut...whatever works for you.  This could help you to relieve some of the pressure on your mind.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!

You should also wait until you are 100% that you want to have sex. If you have to ask whether or not you should, then I don't think you're ready to be honest. Just because he said he's ready to have sex, doesn't mean that you have to be. He can wait for you.<br>  <br>  When having sex, there is always a risk of getting pregnant. Condoms are not 100% reliable and they can tear or burst etc. if not used correctly. Educate yourself on sex and how to use condoms correctly before you decide to do it.|`|IjKndeVvaa	No, you're not ready.

Just because you went out with doesn't mean she can't go out with him. It might be wrong because maybe she didn't talk to you about it first before she did it. But I don't think you should be very upset about it. I went through something similar recently also. It ended well i guess. Its the friendship that counts shouldn't let someone come between it. Talk it out with her and try to understand what is the real problem at hand. Give it time if she is your friend then she would come to you and talk it out with you. And everything will come into place.|`|KHhqmo4Oaa	Make as if you don't care and slowly get away from her if you can't bear the situation. If you act unhappy and tell her about it, you'll end up feeling double upset.

If she can take control of him, and get him to run around doing her bidding I guess she could consider herself so, but no. <br>  money isn't a big deal for me though.. and I tend to be more submissive when it comes to my boyfriend.
F2rI3Juaaa	You need your space - Take comfort in that!|`|c1Dpi0eyaa	Clingy is as clingy does.Chemical overload coupled with emotional bonding produces a feeling of want when the two are apart.It's simple relationship dynamics.|`|Pdex43zgaa	You women are so fickle.|`|YCXxP43Laa	You miss him because you love him, and enjoy his physical presence. I'm not sure it has anything to do with his clinginess... that is a separate issue. Try to reassure him when you are not together, and if the clinginess bothers you, tell him. But say it in a positive way, try to make it upbeat and conversational, so he doesn't take it as a sign of rejection or criticism. It sounds as if he is insecure, so you need to boost him up, but make sure he knows how much you miss him, and how he is in your thoughts, that may help him to stop being so clingy!|`|Fb0wSA1Gaa	haha exactly. its love. I basically live with mine and the second I leave, I miss him horribly.|`|9SSO454taa	that's love|`|44Z2JGeCaa	Are you always this stupid or is today a special occasion? He's your boyfriend hes supposed to be clingy and if you wouldnt miss him when he was gone your F***ed up.  Why are you confused...like how old are you seriously? With as dumb as this question is your probably like 13...why are you even allowed on the internet???|`|XZ9yP4Jkaa	then your both clingy. i guess your a perfect match!|`|pVaZty4Maa	yup and thats what we call love these days sweetie :) congradulations you were bitten by the love bug :)|`|Uss6h5C7aa	johny is rite ....<br>  u r totally in luv .....<br>  nd dats really sweet !!!!<br>   <br>  :)
0RJK65zcaa	ummmmm, this person is someone who has had a silver spoon in their mouth their whole life....this is someone who needs to see life from another perspective....honestly speaking this person is human but i hate when people classify lower-class americans as poor people.... just cause a person is lower class does not make them poor because they could be just as content with their life as the next person. most people dont need glitter and gold to be happy, and the people that do have it 9 times out of 10 arent happy with their life~chosen|`|TOe9RPbeaa	i would think she is really cool , and u can have a really  great time with her. but THAT'S IT. i wouldn't consider her a True friend.|`|QW71z7Deaa	Sounds like a selfish little spoiled brat!|`|eVK2zZsOaa	Sounds like somebody who is a little crazy and definitely not a nice person. This person seems very mean and stuck on themselves. Anybody who looks down on people and shows it definitely has self esteem issues and feels the need to put others down to build themselves up so I would say that they aren't as confident in their own skin as they would appear. Anybody who gets angry enough to almost kill somebody has some serious mental issues. If you find this person is generous and very sweet you are as delusional as they are.|`|AA10505686	I think....this person is a selfish Paris Hilton ding-dong type.

We are business professional and wear ties Mon-Thu except for Memorial Day to Labor day, we get business casual (I guess it's too hot to wear a tie?).<br>  <br>  My wife doesn't care how I tie it as long as I look pimpin fresh, which I usually do.|`|4fded85bb017fba5407e3727176079ffaa	Men in the good old US of A don't really wear ties.

o2Iez6n0aa	U cant really, exfoliated before u shaveee.<br>  And also the red dots are caused by the hair growin back, I heard somewhere you can exfoliate to kinda break the hairs back through, so the red dots go.<br>  Obviously dont try to rub your skin off. Just heard it helps it to grow back.<br>  Best fing u can do is get waxeddd,, or keep the hair reaaaaaly short,Might be a little bit spikey though lol.x|`|2XTkSV4daa	Lotion...you can find special lotion for that in any regular store|`|4coBU4Zvaa	go with the hair, not against it (Y)<br>  i swear by it haha<br>  <br>  its not sore, there's no rash and when it grows back, it doesn't come back thicker, just the same <br>  god send haha|`|YFXmO2Xqaa	you got to shave consistently but if you got a rash or razor bumps you kinda screwed right now not much you can do about that.just shave (down there) all the time or deal with the bumps|`|FzFSzilmaa	use cream or wax next time...<br>  <br>  or moisturise...<br>  <br>  or use a shaving cream/gel with skin balm...|`|g0YNQdL2aa	Get him to kiss it better?|`|hk5f8yxVaa	Well, firstly I just wouldn't shave there, as you look like a little girl and that's REALLY weird. <br>  <br>  However, if you insist on doing it then use the same rules as shaving anywhere. Lather up well, and moisturise the skin afterwards - taking care to make sure no strange substance get near the vagina as this can lead to thrush.|`|mmMgfhf2aa	Use proper shaving gel not soap.|`|GcIcwHLPaa	Wax lol
0IsSBOgkaa	In the begging of my relationship with my ex-Girlfriend, i wait for 5 months to give her a ring. I was not worried about making sex, i gave it  because she "was" the girl that i loved and wanted to stay as long it takes. She makes me happy, stronger, inteligent. Of course that most of the men today, want to make sex all the time and in some cases they give a ring to the ring just to "make" with her as possible they can . ( that's disgusting in my point of view).<br>  But there are nice men, that dont want just sex, we want a partner to hang out, to what movies, to go shopping, to be with us all the time, to sing to dance, to talk... Sex i VERY GOOD, but its not all.<br>  Sry if i mistake some words, my english its not that good ;)<br>  thx|`|RoFfCYGxaa	I don't really understand your question, but promise rings don't always mean no sex.  Sometimes guys give promise rings as a kind of pre-engagement ring or just as a promise of their commitment & faithfulness.  And there are some guys out there who are waiting for marriage, not many, but there are a few.|`|4t5sIIDeaa	My boyfriend gave me a promise ring on Valentine's day and it has nothing to do with sex.  We've been having sex for six months but the ring is just a symbolism of his commitment and faitfulness to me.  He knows I'm not ready for an engagement, so he gave me a "promise" ring.  Promise to be faithful, loving, and committed.<br>  <br>  Hope that helped and cleared up a little for you of why some guys give "promise rings".<br>  <br>  PS - I have also heard of the promise "wait until marriage" rings but I thought those were just for high school girls with foolish unrealistic thoughts in their heads. lol :)|`|VZVGXRyraa	I gave my girlfriend a promise ring on our 1 year anniversary. I gave her the ring as a type of pre-engagement ring, promising my life to her...promising her happiness and protection and never ending, unconditional love and so much more.<br>  <br>   I don't appreciate you lowering the value of a nice gesture. You're obviously meeting the wrong guys. I know i was never out for sex with any of my girlfriends. My fiancee and i decided to wait to give our virginities to each other until we were engaged.<br>  <br>  Promise rings mean different things to different people. Don't judge until you're placed in a similar situation because right now, you know nothing about it.<br>  <br>  Edit: There's more to a relationship than sex...it's the people who's always thinking about it that has something wrong with them. I'd rather spend a year or two developing the emotional, stable part of a relationship than jump into the sexual part and have the relationship centered around it. My fiancee and i have the strongest, most amazing relationship and we never got close to having sex for the first year and a half. There's nothing wrong with us, it's just not the first thing we think about.<br>  <br>  Sorry if i don't fit your warped stereotype of the male gender.|`|Msd9PiRGaa	Diamonds<br>  <br>  She'll pretty much have to|`|64b6c4aa611ce13b3cd370c530cd518aaa	His family values and upbringing would explain it....
mE0N72spaa	You're just not ready for commitment. You may feel like you are, looking around at other couples, but you still want to stay single, test the waters, see what you can and can't do. I am EXACTLY the same, only recently have I realised it's because I'm not ready to commit - I thought I was, and I would like to be in a couple, but I haven't really met anyone that I like enough to go out with them... we're just not people to rush into commitment just because we like a boy and he likes us back. Don't be too harsh, just make it clear that you're not much looking for anything serious, so that you don't hurt anyone along the way. <br>  <br>  Good luck :)<br>  xx|`|i4bjQbPcaa	Why are you so scared of commitment?  You need to work that out before you can get over it.  Do you think you are scared that you will be hurt?  Or is it simply that you are young and you want to play the field.  It does not make you a bad person and when the right person comes along you will want to commit.<br>  <br>  Good luck x|`|t7AIAXo9aa	I think you're still learning. You're probably in like, junior high or early high school, right? I think you are still learning things, and are just not ready for a relationship like that. You're not ready to make the commitment. You are still maturing. Give it time and just pay attention to life and learn from things, it just needs time. You're still maturing...you're not ready. So don't push it until you're ready.|`|PS83gPGoaa	grow up|`|kNVLWmwUaa	thats like me i like them so much and just want to go out with them for a while then when we actually do go out or i get them its like hmm wheres the next person and the chase. yet i hate the chase at the time but seem to love it too. but i suppose its realising that is the thing and the beggining.<br>  i suggest u should just put up with it, take it slow and spend time with them and u'll grow to like them in a social or romantic way etc.<br>  <br>  :)|`|MQJQDBONaa	Yeah.....I'm the same. Look, you have to break the habit at some point. The next potential guy that comes along, date him. You can break up with him eventually....but give yourself a minimum time limit. You might find you enjoy it once you get into the habit of it!|`|ShwV6Ewfaa	Thats just typical lol|`|7fh3JCVxaa	my friends like that, so i know what you mean. you just need to get out of the habit of doing that.<br>  my friend goes off a guy when he likes her back, but i made her give that guy a chance and when she started dating him, she got really into him and she likes him again :)x|`|A4ofPUnGaa	u cant stop it,its just too much fun

A little white Y-shaped scar in your eyebrow or a ridge across the chin suggested something interesting has been done to earn it.  But if your nose is missing they won't stick around to hear the story.  <br>  <br>  In aristocratic German circles, of course, it was considered a mark of dishonour NOT to have a duelling scar of some sort...so occasionally it's a cultural thing.  But very few Arab girls go for blokes with one hand missing...|`|CpNVSJpmaa	Not hot exactly , more mysterious ?

My boyfriend has acne scars and I think he is the best looking guy in the world and I don't care about his scarring.

If you do it in public it will embarass her and make her feel obligated to say yes, which she will just resent you for.<br>  <br>  Do it in a sweet way - You say she is one of your best friends, so i would assume you know her pretty well. Maybe you could pick something for the two of you to do that interests her. This would make her more inclined to say yes, and would make her more comfortble on the day you go out.<br>  <br>  You sound really nice, so i'm sure it will go well, and as one of your best friends, i'm sure she will want to go out with you!<br>  Good Luck!<br>  <br>  <br>  If this helped at all, could you please spare a vote for my school? <br>  The details are here:<br>  <a href="http://plugaway.weebly.com/please-vote.html" rel="nofollow">http://plugaway.weebly.com/please-vote.h...</a><br>  <br>  It'll only take a few seconds and would help me so much!<br>  Thanks x|`|AA10814815	Just be natural :]<br>  <br>  make sure you have an honest tone in your voice<br>  and if she's your best friend just be comfortable.<br>  <br>  I came on to mind like, "Imagine if we went out"<br>  <br>  if the answer is "ew" you might wanna give it up lol|`|VmPk6Mvlaa	well if you know she feels the same way about you, im sure if you asked her out even in the most simplest way, she will say yes.

djUMvICoaa	My question to you is why do you think she would want to go to the U if she isn't trying to get good grades in high school?  It sounds like it would be a big waste of daddy's money and why do that?  She's a big girl and knows the implications of not doing what she should.  Why are you so attracted to someone who is so lackluster in what she does?  This might be something that will come back and haunt you some day.  The good thing is once you get to college you will be able to meet girls who are motivated, they will be more of your liking.  So sorry I didn't answer the way you wanted but sometimes it's better to look reality in the face sooner rather than later.  good luck|`|eqCI4M9Yaa	well if she really wants to get into uni and she can try harder you should tell her to try she might push you away but if she really likes you she wont you just got to make sure she knows your concerned for her|`|F4kFUxd1aa	that is really sweet and sensitive of you to worry about her future. It shows how genuine your feelings are. I don't think that she will look at it as you being bossy, well she shouldn't. It also depends on how you approach her about it. You will be doing the right thing by encouraging her.

JFJF3GPWaa	Dumping someone in person is better because it's coming from you and then the person understands that it's really over, and that you mean it.<br>  <br>  However if you dump a person by text it feels to them like you don't respect them enough to do it in person. It's like the relationship never meant anything to them because that person can't even be bothered to tell you face to face. If someone dumps you by text it also feels a bit unreal and you don't get the sense of closure you would if they'd told you themselfs.<br>  Hope this is what you were looking for :)|`|64b71311b453645560ceb49d58250d08aa	its more personal to do it in person and shows that you at least somewhat care about their feelings and if you do it by text your *****|`|DBVJ7AIMaa	I would suggest respect.

8130732466e5c537088eddfef54bd90faa	Some advice from a person who has been married to a bi-polar for 13 years.  Counseling alone is not going to get the job done.  Meds will work if you can keep him on them.  (Most of the time, as soon as they are stable, they take them self off the meds, because they think they are cured - not so).  If you are just dating, break it off and don't take him back.  I know it sounds terrible, because you may really love him, but bipolar will make you loose your mind. (YOUR mind, his is already shot).  People may tell you to keep up with counseling and meds, and that there is hope, but in my experience these are only temporary band-aids.  It will come back, and it will destroy you as a person eventually.  I used to have a nice home, nice car, money in the bank, and a pretty good life.  A dozen years later, I live in a crappy hotel, take the bus to work,  and don't enjoy life too much.  (despite the fact I have a pretty good job).   The other thing that burns me, is people always say, communicate, communicate, communicate.  I would agree that open communication is necessary in a healthy relationship, but a bi-polar individual will twist your words, and then use them against  you at some point.  I'm so tired of it.  Just get out of the relationship and save yourself the grief.|`|c5UAa65qaa	If he refuses to do the work to control and hopefully end the cycle by going to counseling, nothing's going to improve.  You need to look out for your own emotional well-being, and if that means refusing to tolerate his problem when he's not making any effort to deal with it constructively, then unfortunately, that may be what you have to do.|`|FtyLwqR5aa	He needs to be on meds to stabilize his moods.

byCrVwh0aa	oh that is a bit of a confusing one!well if this first guy is a player then maybe you shouldn't go out with him. if he's serious about you he'll stay friends with you after you turn him down.<br>  on the other hand, your friend has always been there for you and i know its scary going into a relationship with someone you've been friends with but look at it this way, at least you know him! he'd be a best friend and a boyfriend. If i were you i'd go for guy no.2 and maybe let the other guy mature a bit. If you can't imagine losing your friend maybe its the right way to go. there's only one way to find out. take the risk!

Surprisingly, living together before marriage is not an indication of future together, a significant number of shack-ups later divorce.  Shackup is often for sex or convenience, not commitment.  <br>  <br>  You'll need to be with someone for long enough to experience the good and bad times to see how you each handle it.

But if people didn't have the illusion to start with, the marriage rate would fall and there would be no divorces. I'm never surprised at how many (mostly females) are disillusioned w/marriage. So my basic theory is: For every 'illusion' there is 'disillusion'.<br>  <br>  Of course, nobody wants to talk about that tho. They would rather blame money or abuse or infidelity, or they 'fell out of love'.<br>  <br>  People don't fall in love, if the love is really 'love', they grow as persons, as a couple, they grow in love.|`|0d0W0nbVaa	usually works out like this:<br>  <br>  one or both parties develop some kind of 'resentment' through many different reasons.   could be emotional abandonment, being lazy to one party's views,  etc etc...   then the negative energy start to brew... and the person resenting start to treat the other party like crap.  than the other party starts resenting for being resented, and being treated like crap..  then some hot co worker smiles at him, warm loving wanting looks,  and before you know it,  one night late at work, they both drop their pants and screw like rabbits.  <br>  <br>  wait,  that's my story. <br>  <br>  never mind.<br>  <br>  lol.|`|IvMPh09baa	Lack of communication.<br>  <br>  if people took the time to talk and listen to each other, I think alot more issues could be deal with together.<br>  <br>  its when you stop talking to your spouse about your problems/concerns/wants/needs... thats when things fall apart and eventually get so far apart theres no need for the relationship anymore.<br>  <br>  ADD: I see alot of men answering finance, and alot of women answering infidelity. interesting.|`|JkvlAVX2aa	People just would NOT stop getting married.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  P.S.

VecVZ15naa	I realize you're asking the women, but I have to give my opinion as well.<br>  Your buddy's sister-in-law is the ultimate "rebound girl". She and her sister looked alike, talked alike, etc. He's more than likely seeking comfort over the loss of his wife. Sister-in-law is also looking for comfort and who better than the widower. It all seems like a rather natural reaction to a great loss.<br>  However, as his clear headed buddy you should point out to him that he should slow things down a-bit. Yes. they might actually make a great couple and they might actually be in love, but they might also be on the rebound and just grieving. She's his daughter's aunt and things could get awkward if a romantic relationship goes bad. The good news is she's his daughters aunt so she's not gonna go away. They should slow down let the grief take its course (it's only been 8 months) and THEN see how things go, it could turn out to be a great match.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	1. Too early.  Should give it a good year at least before dating anyone.<br>  <br>  2. His first serious girlfriend, the rebound girlfriend, should not be someone to marry - it'll end in divorce later.<br>  <br>  3. Prepare for the unexpected.  In life, sometimes things work out in some of the strangest ways.  Maybe it will work for them, maybe not...<br>  <br>  Couldn't hurt to make it a long engagement...|`|TTt51jutaa	They need Dr. Phil!|`|2c441ddbdb5c2e594351cb0212be0fe9aa	I don't see anything wrong with it. In fact his late wife would probably be happy to know that her husband and her sister are together now. She loved both of them afterall. And isn't it better than taking a chance on some unknown woman who wouldn't have the same love and affection for the late wife and for the little girl that the aunt does? I think it might be a good idea to have a longer engagement. But in the end they are 2 consenting adults and they should do what makes them happy.|`|CQsD09D6aa	I find that a bad idea. They are both still grieving and are getting married as a result of it. I agree with the family. Before jumping into anything they should get counseling.|`|PCw1zDtsaa	NO NO NO that's not right.. They should not be together...!! What type of morals do they have???|`|wpEoqEVXaa	I would find it morally wrong. They were related for more than 10 years. In essance, he is marrying what he knew to be his sister for all of the time he was married to his wife. Morally, i'd say it is wrong to wed with a relation like this, especially if the relation is the sister of his deceased wife. <br>  <br>  Whereas any wife would want to know her husband moved on and found love, i don't know many who would turn around and say please pick from one of my siblings. <br>  <br>  He may be going through transference, which won't be a healthy relationship for either of them. It's amazing that the sister is willing to be with her brother in law. <br>  <br>  I find it most odd that they are involved, in love and already to get engaged when the wife has been gone for only 8 months. Did their love affair start before the wife's death? Was the wife's death somehow not an accident and they did it to ensure that they could be together? To get engaged after only 8 months seems out of the norm for any couple, let alone a grieving family like this. Red flags everywhere on this one. <br>  <br>  I don't have any biological sisters, but i have two friends i've known all of my life that i call sister. I want my husband to move on and i expect no time frame when i am gone. BUT, i would not want him with either of those that i call sister, that he sees as his sister in law.|`|y1Fihj3Maa	I think it may be a bit early.  I would suggest they wait at least a year, and if they still feel the same way, then may they find true happiness.<br>  It would be the most respectful thing to do for all family involved.<br>  <br>  A senior friend of my aunts has this story to tell about her grandmother:<br>  <br>  Her grandmother had 6 children when her husband passed away.  Her husbands brother, also had 6 children, and had lost his wife.  Grandmother became house keeper, and care giver to brother in laws children.  They then married and had 6 more children.  Just trying to figure out the various relationships between the children will make your head spin.  True story, but happened over 100 years ago.|`|DZCFD0p2aa	that's the way they rolled back in olden days. <br>  They are 2 adults and no one has a right to tell them what to do.

You can't go into the more advanced moves until your vagina become more accustomed to his "shaft".<br>  <br>  Just go slow and be sure your well lubed. And use a condom. If you're not well-lubed, the condom will break and you'll get pregnant or catch an STD.<br>  <br>  If you give him a BJ and he comes, he might not be able to get back up. Just make him hard enough.|`|YG8J5xA5aa	yeah him on top theres no other way to do it really.<br>  He needs to slowly push.<br>  His needs can come the next time. This is all about you att the moment, he's not having something inside if him ripped open is he?<br>  just give him a bj before hand.|`|0TMOzqX7aa	missionary
xpAk4yVqaa	It is a private matter between the two of them, and you just need to see it that way. Also why would you want to be with a man who is scared of his own responsibilities? He has to man up, and do it. You should know that already.<br>  <br>  You probably feel scared that there is a slight chance that he might fall for his ex again because of the child.<br>  <br>  But instead should feel that if you were to eventually marry this man, you should see how he treats others in his past relationships to get a better judge of him now.<br>  <br>  Let him take the responsibility in being a man, and face the kid, and ex alone.<br>  <br>  Trust me there is no better time to get to know who your boyfriend truly is as a man than now. This is the best test for you to see some of his true self. <br>  <br>  The divorce rate is increasing because of marriages that were not really meant to be.<br>  <br>  People never show their true selves during dating, but you have the opportunity to see a glimpse of his true self. <br>  <br>  Think about it , he was having unprotected sex with his ex, that alone shows you that he takes risks, and is pretty selfish. Then he asks you to go with him as support? I mean a man should take responsibility and not look for someone to help and mother him.|`|41fe712a36ecf2746af8f97a562a2794aa	Ok, they've got quite a few important things to talk about. If you and her don't get along then that's just another thing to stress her (and your bf) out, and the important thing here is the baby's future, not whether you and her get on (you probably never will).<br>  <br>   Drive there with your bf, YOU can sit in a cafe around the corner and leave him to meet her and chat, then he can meet you afterwards.<br>  <br>   I really think it's unlikely anything will happen between them, she lied to him and they're not together now, he's with you! If he wants to tell her that you're sitting around the corner, that's up to him. It's pointless putting her under any more stress than she's already got.<br>  <br>   Obviously this means there's no point buying the baby a present (unless your bf wants to get anything). Give them a bit of space so both of them can decide what's to be done about the baby's future.<br>  <br>  Best of luck!|`|Q1MI6L96aa	If you were husband and wife, then you should go. At this point it is a private matter and he should not use you as a crutch because of being nervous. You are not a prop in this drama.|`|YkLAFRAxaa	no you shouldnt<br>  this is kind of private and it would be suoer weird for the mom of the baby to see you walking in withihm
eGpOIV12aa	e<br>  <br>  one of you must make the first move. he is probably wont and wants you to make the first move
OFJFLs2Paa	Well yes it could be anything that you named, but to me I don't think that it is none of them what so ever. I think that he was just looking into your eyes just because you was looking at his friend and it kinda looked like you was looking at him. Or he might not have been looking at you and you only think that he was. I mean you did say that you guys were far away. A lot of people mistake that all the time. I may be wrong about this, but there is no other reason. Also I don't think that you should think so much about this I mean if he liked you then he would try and talk to you or try and get with you. Because if he knew that you liked him then that means he would have a chance with you. Now he didn't think that you was acting weird he just was maybe thinking what is she looking at or does she still like me after a year. He wouldn't have known right away that you was looking at his friend because you guys were far away. If he wanted you to talk to him then he would try and talk to you first. With you talking to other guys thing that is kinda like the one before it. I don't think that he got jealous because he would have you or would have had you if that was the case.
B3cPFhssaa	Yea i reckon he likes her,it's a give away if you ask me.<br>  I'd just keep quiet about it,what do you plan on doing anyway?<br>  You can't say "I saw him first" because that's lame.<br>  If she knows you like him and she's a proper friend,then she won't go out with him anyway.
qpAYU8Knaa	If he is getting what he wants without texting or  calling why would he want to spend his time and energy doing it? You are correct. You are just his sex bud and he doesn't want to show any affection to you in public.|`|b3zGfYMpaa	Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me. <br>  Sex buds rarely work..someone always gets attached (usually the girl) and if sex is all that he has in mind, your going to be the one getting hurt. Get yourself out of the rut before that happens. I'd just be friends and leave it at that. Its a sticky situation being that its your sisters finance and all..I wouldnt persue anything further and cut off all sexual activity with him.|`|dH9IhDIFaa	If you want it to be more than that then a casual sexual relationship is a bad idea.  You should let him know what you are looking for and he can decide if he wants to be that in your life.|`|n7BuH75gaa	Obviously.<br>  You guys are just using each other for stress relief. It's okay. Just don't be a typical girl and think it's going anywhere.|`|mldo1vxYaa	You have just shown this guy he can sleep with you anytime he wants without any form of commitment or comeback or even common courtesy. I would forget him and move on, your sister wont thank you for messing up her relationship because of your mistakes. You obviously already have a connection with him so dont sleep with him again and find someone else.|`|Di6FAQxRaa	Well you slept with him in the first place so that is all he wants. You guys dont talk or hang out so all he wants is sex. You are better off being sex buddies. Why are you acting mad for, he isnt your man? You dont need to show emotions. If you wanted to be with him in a relationship you shouldnt have slept with him.first if you wanted to be wth him.|`|2DRWQxP3aa	I think one night stand gone weird relationship. I wouldn't suggest sleeping with him again, seeing as you are soon going to be related. <br>  <br>  answer please: <br>  <a href="http://ca.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090223091208AAhC22R">http://ca.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|KR1FdEZgaa	to be honest, i think he is just getting what he wants. sex no commitment. he maybe with another women, and your convenient. if that is what you want go ahead and get it. if your looking for a boyfriend keep looking and avoid him.|`|Ch39oU58aa	Stop making a fool of yourself!  He is just using you and you're probably a joke to him and his brother. Being sex buddies isn't a good idea because you don't know how many he has... AIDS IS REAL|`|03GQ637Raa	You should only  be sex buddies if you can keep a lid on your feelings.  But on the real, move on and leave him alone because you might not be his only sex buddy and there are too many  ST D's that you could get.|`|EPmuhhGaaa	with ur sisters and brothers engagement its a confusing situation.<br>  <br>  ask him what he wants from you. if he says idk he means he wants sex. don't attack him, just calmly in a private place.|`|PxLhryHyaa	if you're ok with it! whatever you want! just don't end up getting hurt in the end!!|`|De1tOxHXaa	no doubt,you both are like sex buddies and carry on this if you like having sex with him, if not than get your *** off to him.|`|HKF4tdmhaa	You seem to enjoy sex with him and it is making you forget all that the guy has done. I don't know if you are drugged or you are so sex starved that you will bed with him even if he just considers you a sex worker whom he need not pay.<br>  <br>  Well if you both can live together for 5 days without doing sex or talking or gesturing about it then tell me, that its some sort of healthy relationship.<br>  <br>  You probably have lost many things in life than just your body. Its your mind that's not stable. I don't think he was the only person to have had sex with you. To you sex is something you will share with anyone who comforts you for the moment and you would consider little about future.<br>  <br>  May be you are very dedicated in love for this guy but when he doesn't need you why you keep offering him yourself as and when he may get access to you. Are you willing to do anything for him even if he may react as though he never knew you the very next day.<br>  <br>  Well if you are so true in your love will you raise a kid if you get pregnant by him? Or is it you have made it up in your mind that it is this guy you want in your bed anytime anyday.<br>  <br>  Sex buddies? let me tell you you sound sex bitches. You treat your body as a component that will fit any other component, thats all. You will cling on to any living being that can physically exite you. You are sick!<br>  <br>  Yes! Raama!! Why do you keep this girl and boy alive in the first place!|`|77NzfiVkaa	There is no such thing as just sex buddies. You are going to get attached (as it sounds like you already are) and get hurt. Just forget this guy.|`|ew3Wl6hKaa	sounds like that's all he want's!!<br>  And just like me u'll want more!! don't bother with him, trust me u'll find better!!
Vv7a31pmaa	you should not do this like this.
oIkJSPJOaa	I was at one time. Words of advice. Protect that love and don't let the illusion of the green grass come between was is great and an unrealistic dream.<br>  <br>  Coming out of a bad relationship should help you to better appreciate a good one. And there are good men in the world.  So don't let past experiences allow you lose the greatest opportunities of life.  Everybody deserves to be loved.<br>  <br>  I salute you and that love. May it last a lifetime.|`|4coBU4Zvaa	congratulations :)<br>  <br>  and yes i am, i feel so comfortable with this guy, and feel we could easily take on the world :)<br>  if that makes sense haha<br>  <br>  sorry about your marriage too|`|Xj7p8uWUaa	Congrats! I'm 25 and still trying to find not Mr. Right but a decent guy. Maybe one day I'll be in your shoes|`|WokwBBGIaa	no i hate my partner and want to smother him with a pillow
gQe01CHCaa	Tell him what you just wrote!!!.. you just answered your own question sweetheart. That was simply beautiful.|`|DTZmqnCkaa	Let him hump your sister and friends without consequence and just tell him you want him to be happy.  That oughta prove it.|`|F9LET66Eaa	Show him this page.<br>  Show him this open question.-|`|F5JXQUEAaa	Swallow|`|45ca9f20886ed179a7577d9c3b53a67faa	I think when it comes to matters of the heart no one can say they love someone more then their spouse loves them. There is no way of knowing exactly how much he loves you just like he does not know exactly how much you love him. I think that you both should not worry about who loves who more and concentrate on each other and being there for one another. <br>  <br>  True love and strong love will shine through in this type of thing! Trust me! <br>  Good Luck!|`|5agXk9ldaa	sacrifice i think is the best way <br>  if you like something he hates it, well don't do it for him.<br>  and sometimes beautiful msg on his cell at midnight make him feel happy.<br>  good luck
mDq4Mf9zaa	well it all depends on the guy<br>  IT ALWAYS DPENDS ON THE GUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  Sarah.V|`|bYGx8xdVaa	no if u want to get a partner mature as u and not a child...

Absolutely no doubt about it!<br>  xx|`|zvAfMgf3aa	I do have a chance, I don't know about you??|`|nlOC41Qraa	Not if your communication skills are always like this, then no!|`|TXY6EAYqaa	Get that car ready and see where it take us.|`|44A9BZ04aa	of what, with who???
VSVQHKwKaa	Honey,<br>  <br>  Babies don't live, grow, or develop on just love. <br>  <br>  Certainly that's one of many ingrediants, but it's not the end-all, be-all.<br>  <br>  You're not capable of giving your baby all the experience, maturity, and protection it deserves.<br>  <br>  Your waiting and patience is a monument to how much you love your children and how you want the very best for them.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|BRyRtQSvaa	Your mind will change when you do!|`|4EWCegiRaa	You think you know but you have no idea.  The simple fact that you even what's wrong about it shows how ignorant you are about it.<br>  <br>  And that's not your fault.  You should be learning those things now but just because you THINK you know, doesn't mean you know what you're talking about here.<br>  <br>  PS-  I wasn't even talking about money but do YOU personally have a steady income?  Where is this money coming from?  Is it going to last you atleast 25 years since that's how long you may have to support this child?|`|UR3MjFLtaa	if use are so in love whats the rush? Waite a couple of years make sure things are true. Finnish school and save up. when you and him have ur own life, job,  house, then you are ready.|`|ULUpOqplaa	Where I live they are pregnant and shacking up at 13.  By 16 they are old maids.|`|Gzjx99hBaa	u dont know what your taling about.|`|8A42sQoCaa	I definately believe it is possible to love someone at 16<br>  but as far as getting married...<br>  if you live with your parents,<br>  are not in your third year of college or graduated heading into a career,<br>  dont make more than $40,000 a year. then its financially impossible<br>  it costs around $30,000 just to raise a kid for a year, much less feed you. <br>  Babies are not some cute thing you can carry around on your arm and show off, they are living breathing people, who need undivided attention, care, love, and support. At 16 your just getting started taking care of yourself. You wouldnt be having a baby, your mom would because she would be the one taking care of it<br>  <br>  at youngest wait till your 19, see how you feel then|`|AA11671599	Actually, I am old school, and women were made to be married and have babies.  Last I checked in any female world of any being or animal that has babies, egg or live birth.<br>  <br>  If they are not meant to have babies at an early age, then why do most start ovulating at or around 12?<br>  <br>  Oh, yes, the government said so, and is trying to control the population.|`|X5aMV1Pmaa	Yes it would be wrong.  Wait another 10 years.|`|MAABo1zKaa	go look up how much a baby costs a year. youll piss yourself in fear.
2R1dYsUKaa	wow buddy you are in a serious predicament...well it could be 1-3 things.... one she is just having cramps, two she is having cramps and a delayed period due to so much sex, or three she is prego....... those seem like all the sympotoms of each....but if she's on birth control chances are you are in the safe zone my man.....you don't have to wear a condom just clean up after ward then go at it again...or condoms would be the safer way.,...its up to you.condoms limit the feeling for both ppl it sucks.|`|hXCBJTAOaa	To me the way it sounds, she might not be maybe you where laying on a bone or something. And with the cramps she could be about to come on her cycle, sex changes to body and by the way you are describe it you all are doing it everyday, and the body has to catch up. LOL, But you all do need to use condoms. BE SAFE!|`|RoFfCYGxaa	Well, I obviously can't answer if she's pregnant or not, only a doctor could do that, but I can tell you that even if she was she wouldn't be able to feel the baby in her stomach already.  She should go ahead & take a pregnancy test or make an appointment to got to a doctor to be sure.  And you guys should definitely start using condoms, just to be safe & so you don't have to go through all this worry & stress again.

You can say 'I think your nodding is kinda freaky, why do you do that?' (emphasis on 'I think', it's to say that it's just YOUR opinion and you're not insulting her) but she might just say that it's none of your business and go back to it. :/<br>  I also think it's kinda funny but people do what they want after all... free country and all that :p<br>  Cheers!|`|u1Oi6tGHaa	I don't think weird is the word you should use.

I highly doubt she does it on purpose, so don't make fun of her. Ask her casually if she noticed that she moves her head a lot, but make sure you say it subtly or it could ruin her confidence a bit. Maybe apologize for laughing. She might also just be full of energy, you never know.

It gave me the creeps just to sit there and listen to some one talk for an hour sucks... so i would tap my fit or my fingers hell some times i would go completely crazy and cuss the teacher out so at least she isn't me. that is for sure.

YQ1Q7XeEaa	Ummm No.<br>  <br>  My question is what is it in you that wants to give a player a second chance?  I've never understood women who allow the men in their lives to cheat or worse, abuse but still take them back.|`|sCr2iTczaa	NO. he wasn't faithful in the first place what makes you think he will be the second time around?

I kid you not. she's been in and out of insititutes)) but now he's with his crazy girlfriend and left in the dust. don't forgive him.|`|C44Ux50paa	I honestly don't believe it is worth it to give cheaters a second chance.

Good Luck:)|`|AA11755944	he will continue to cheat.|`|B7kPUmUWaa	I'm big on second chances, but you need to discuss with him why he did it.

Just talk it over, and then make the decision that's best for you.|`|cydakP87aa	no. once a cheater, always a cheater.<br>  they never learn if you take them back.<br>  be strong and get rid of him. <br>  really, as tough as its going to be, it will be better for you in the end.<br>  i promise.<br>  good luck :)|`|QIYHApEkaa	Only if your foolish enough to belive he wont do it again, once they cheat on you they will do it again and again so kick them to the curb; That goes for both men and women!|`|F0mE7l3xaa	if you make any mistake for the first time your a fool make it twice and your an idiot. he just may of done that on accident. if he does it again dump him.|`|rOcNunO3aa	if someone does something bad then shame on them....<br>  if you give them a second chance and they screw up again then shame on you...|`|9WJ1mYkwaa	Heck No! He isn't even worth your time.

Sorry, but he will most likely do it again.<br>  Did you catch him, or did he confess?|`|DNwHGeEtaa	No, he deserves no chance! I know we always say that everyone deserves a second chance, but we have understand this clearly. So if a guy cheated on you once and then he made a great of effort to prove to you that he would never cheat again, then he would deserve a second chance. But in your case, your boyfriend cheated on you with his ex. The problem here is that it was his ex. She's always gonna a threat to you, because you know that nothing has changed. Clearly he still has feelings for his ex or there is some sexual tension between them. You know these things don't go away every easily. It's not like he was drunk one day, out of his mind, and slept with a random girl with no intention. In your case, he had the intention. He knew what he was doing. <br>  <br>  Forget this guy. He's not worth it.|`|BV5ClWj7aa	cant really say. thats for you to decide. when it comes to making decisions like that only you the person can really say for sure what you want to do. there is no wrong way. this is life. you take him back he cheats again you will know to let him go. you take him back he doesnt cheat and yall are cool. you dont take him back and in the back of your head you wonder if he would have stopped cheating and been there for you. You have to decide|`|dfBbvqb0aa	Hey There Gurl<br>  <br>  It would depend on the situation i guess. I know for some people. This would not be a excuse. I would forgive the guy if he had really really gotten drunk, blacked out and did something with his ex gf...|`|hBhhLRe5aa	NO!!!!! when a boy cheats on you with a girl they been with it means that they are not going to leave that person alone... and you forgive him he going to feel like he can have watever he wants....|`|NDqDFnGyaa	Heck no girlfriend, don't go out with him again. If he cheated on you once he won't hesitate to do it again.
JtEBaOdjaa	I think it's a perfectly fine idea.  Give someone else, who may not be able to afford a nice gown, the chance to wear one.<br>  <br>  Chance are, by the time you have a daughter getting married the dress will be out of style and she wouldn't want to wear it anyways.<br>  <br>  I would sell mine but we're doing a trash the dress photo shoot the next day so I don't know if mine will be in sellable condition after I jump into the river. lol<br>  <br>  EDIT: if you do sell it, please be honest about any problems there may be: a loose stitch, tiny bit of dirt on the bottom whatever it may be. I hate when people are dishonest about used items they are selling. it's not fair to the buyer.|`|RA3p25Qoaa	My dress was a gift from the previous owner so I'm not sure if they want it kept in the family or not.  <br>  I have no issue with selling wedding dresses. My mother didn't keep hers and if she did I wouldn't have wanted it. ( love you mom) <br>  <br>  I think if you can sell your dress it's a great idea. you clear up some room in your closet and another bride get's a great dress on a tight budget.  If my aunt doesn't want my dress back I don't imagine I'll be keeping it. I may sell it or offer it to another bride. <br>  <br>  Same thing with graduation dresses. I kept mine for 4 years and realized I would do nothing with it. so I put it up on freecycle and gave it to a girl could really use it.|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	Yes, I sure wish I would have, but didn't think of it at the time, and now it's too late.  It's just hanging there....<br>  If you are sure you don't want to keep it - or make something from it if you are crafty (like a memory quilt, or pillows), go ahead and sell it. Or donate it to a charitable organization.|`|AA11603468	Then it sounds as if you'd want to sell it. To answer your question, no, I will not be selling my dress, even if it is never worn again. It's my dress, and I plan to keep it for the rest of my life.|`|gbn3iVZQaa	I would keep it.<br>  <br>  maybe your daughter could wear it|`|oXfvBdNHaa	Ill probably sell mine. Why not? I won't wear it again, it will just sit in my closet and collect dust anyway. I have pictures for sentimental value.|`|u4910BFfaa	You could sell it.  Most people just leave them hanging in their closets for years and they just get in the way.|`|8d87fe8a8d0a0fb67336e3e06085d424aa	I would keep it. something memorable. and what not|`|caa265fc73cd7f24fe83d9a186ac1af9aa	If you don't want to keep it, then go for it.<br>  <br>  I had heard of someone who will take a dress apart then make a throw blanket and/or decorative pillows out of it.  Since i know I won't have need for my dress again, but I also wouldn't want to part with it, I plan to look into making something else out of it once the wedding is over.|`|6d718b2ca0424bba8e88fd0bd7a40273aa	If you really think you won't be using it for another activity then there is abolustely nothing wrong with setting up an ebay account and selling your dress. A matter of fact htere are a lot of wedding dresses available on craigslist.com and ebay.com. So go ahead. <br>  <br>  My fiance's mother recently married and she used her sister's old wedding dress for her wedding. The dress was from the late '80s but she didn't care because she was happy/blessed to use it. So you never know when one might come up. But it sounds as if you are sure, so go head and sell it. On your website browser click used wedding gowns and a few sites that buy/sell wedding gowns.|`|a3422bad6666b60894e80bace0f14387aa	If you won't wear it again, selling it is an option, yes. <br>  <br>  I don't plan on selling mine, I plan on donating it. A lot of charities accept gowns either for charity auctions or re-sell stores like Salvation Army and GoodWill. I firgue, I don't need the dress and I am not in this to get my money back, I simply want someone else to enjoy my dress! <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|sHHfDscgaa	Sell it.  It's just clutter to you.  I'm getting married in April and I'm either get a dress that looks like a nice party dress or I'm renting a dress here in Vegas.  <br>  <br>  It's really a sentimental thing.  What's important to you?  If it doesn't matter, get rid of it.|`|q8eue7CRaa	I'd talk to you husband first about the idea - if he agrees it's fine to sell, then I don't see why not. However, if he is sad you want to get rid of your wedding dress, I think you should hold onto it.|`|AkUhaMm9aa	ifyou spent a lot of money on your dress you could try to sell it and you could get about 50% of what you spent..<br>  <br>  I know a lot of people look for used wedding dresses..<br>  <br>  here is the link..<br>  www.preownedweddingdresses.com<br>  <br>  <br>  good luck.|`|rpVQpJA7aa	If you absolutely know you don't want to keep it, then go ahead and sell it, but remember the sentimental value it has. Would you like to keep it for one of your daughters or something like that?|`|mkrKHQvFaa	No not dumb.  I honestly bought my dress off Craigs list and it had been worn before.  I love my dress more than anything I found in the stores.  If you are not going to save it I say sell it!  Good luck.|`|enn4OfAWaa	Well obviously once you get married you probably are never gonna wear it again but wouldn't you want to keep it since it signifies your marriage to your spouse??|`|cLrY0O4Uaa	I think it is a GREAT idea! Why not pass on such a beautiful dress to someone who can benefit from it? Try preownedweddingdresses.com or oncewed.com.<br>  Congratulations on your wedding too!|`|EwY7dIViaa	I haven't gotten married yet, but I wouldn't sell it. I love keeping things! I actually have diaries from when I was 6 years old...it's all about the memories. My mom still has her wedding dress too!|`|52b0f62af53dd437245aea3bc2df6601aa	Sell it so other people have the opportunity to celebrate joy in the dress.  A good dress should never go to waste.|`|DutTBV3caa	i think if you know you wont regret it then selling it is ok. just think about it before rushing to sell.|`|BnJRwJiEaa	I would keep for a little while longer.|`|I7QcHkLFaa	Sell it|`|f4HsyUfQaa	well my wedding dress is a  very simple white jacket and skirt. I would put it on e-bay or craigs list.|`|ECe1rgsdaa	That's what I plan to do! My fiance doesn't really want me too, but why keep it hidden in the back of my closet? It's beautiful, let someone else enjoy it! I'm pretty sure my future daughters would rather get their own dress, just like I did. The fashions will change, and they may not be the same size. Go for it! :)|`|0jUGSaZPaa	No it's not dumb!!<br>  It's great!!<br>  <br>  So many people have so much clutter, b/c they keep things that they don't use anymore and things add up...<br>  <br>  Your wedding gown is probably in a closet, taking up a lot of closet space.. So why not?<br>  <br>  You have your wedding photos of you in your dress, so you always have the memories.. :)<br>  <br>  That's what people should do... If they are not using something, but they have attachment to it, take a photo!!  Now, it's just a photo you have to still bring you back down Memory Lane opposed to clutter.<br>  <br>  Make sure you are 100% sure you want to sell your gown though...  And be smart about it. Do some research on how much other brides are selling their gowns for...  And be sure to mention the retail price.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!!<br>  Congrats on being a newlywed!!|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	It's up to you entirely. If you want to keep it for sentimental reasons, keep it; if you feel like selling it, sell it. Not everything is done for purely practical reasons - often, we keep stuff we will never use/wear out of pure sentimentality. I personally wouldn't have a problem selling my wedding dress if I wasn't going to use it again; I don't get terribly attached to clothes. But everyone is different.|`|kUE3Ddktaa	Lots of women sell their gowns on craigslist and Ebay. <br>  <br>  I mean, really, has anyone ever met a woman in the past ten years who has worn her mother's old wedding gown? I haven't. If you don't have any use for yours, sell it and help another bride make her wedding day special. There is bound to be some good karma in that!|`|nqINitkmaa	I wouldn't sell mine, its sentimental, very special to me. But if you don't feel that attachment to it, then by all means go ahead and sell it, you can sell it on Craig's list, e-bay, or even a second hand bridal shop, there are lots of those around. Good luck!|`|lgxE5nUoaa	I wouldn't sell mine even if I never do ever wear it again.  There is simply sentimental value there.
AUnKu2Wgaa	i have also had sex in a changing room and u r totally ryt it is soo fun! the riskiest place i have had sex is in the local park and an elderly couple past us whilst walking their dogs oh my god the shame!|`|rXeCMVanaa	the library.  the study room.  looking back i would have brought a pillow to avoid the carpet burns.|`|qEfM6XRyaa	driving home from his football game in a small car at night with his mother driving and us in the backseat it was so awesome|`|M5kUNkbMaa	haha public park in the middle of the grass...later we found out there are 24 hour cameras there, with a person watching all the time.  :-X|`|w8gBWpKTaa	Giggedy Giggedy.|`|Oz5F8Alfaa	public parking lot at lunch time.
OtqB24NVaa	Maybe you should put a lil more into your email to him.... I mean, he did tell you he liked you and your unlike anyone he has ever met. Thats a BIG compliment and upfront letting you know he wants to go out. However, you emailed back just stating that you thought he was a very nice guy.... now, thats not something to let him you know you "like" him in a dating kind of way. Thats something you say about your brother, or a friend. Maybe you should email him back and make sure in it you let him know your interested. I believe once you do that, he will then ask you out. Look at it from his point of view, most guys when they ask a girl out get a response ssomething like this.... well your a really nice guy BUT blah blah blah....rejection! So, he probably is unsure how to take that<br>  <br>  try something like this......<br>  <br>  Hi, I just wanted to let ya know how much I appreciated and was flattered by the nice words you had to say about me in your email.  I think your all around, simply put just a great guy and I like you also. I look forward to seeing you each day at work....just add whatever you feel from here|`|gJE0ujbzaa	Your attitude is very childish and self centered. The guy already stuck his neck out and told you he was interested. Yet it doesn't sound like you are doing anything to acknowlege that. You are treating him the same as always. Most people would take that to mean you weren't interested. Particularly if you sent an email back "a couple days later" saying you thought he was a "nice guy", but not acknowledging the fact that he said he really liked you. <br>  <br>  Basically, it sounds like he WAS asking you out, just not on a specific outing, and was hoping you'd say "hey, let's have a drink one evening" or something.<br>  <br>  WHY should a man always do the asking?  Sure, I myself prefer it-but I'll be the first to admit it's because it's so much easier to say yes or no than to risk sticking my neck out, only to have the person say no.<br>  <br>  You ask if your attitude is selfish-well yes, it is.  You are dumping ALL the responsibility of a relationship on the other person.  If I were a guy, I'd just assume you had no interest in me, and move on to someone who wasn't such hard work.|`|hHndD5SEaa	I think he is waiting for you to ask him out!! like in fairness he seems to have made a massive effort in the email!! I think you should cut him some slack - maybe email him back adn say something like - so after that lovely email you sent me Id assumed that you'd have asked me out by now!!! see what he comes back with to that?<br>  xx|`|gQe01CHCaa	Well if you are not willing to meet him halfway- don't complain if he doesn't try. Just an opinion.|`|Y9UiJpNcaa	He is nervous if you are still sensitive from your last relationship. Or hes a bit nervous|`|M2KHsSkDaa	Maybe he hasn't thought about how to ask you. give him sometime, he could just be nervous?
2R1dYsUKaa	personally, no i don't like red heads, they have tempers like none other lol...and they cheat on you..i dated 3 and they were all the same. plus to find a really attractive one is hard... the only plus is that they are a freak in the sheets.|`|PmSDmkOvaa	Well yea I like red heads not the ones with freckles all over there body but other than that yea.|`|eXxYEYLnaa	Yes I think some of them are, Its not all about the hair!|`|TpBHi8S2aa	I think there are some good looking red headed women.  They are just rare.|`|v96pYAg1aa	Some are hot but that is just my opinion
s5ALY2Eoaa	Awwww<br>  I'm sorry that those nasty misgriffs are being mega parallel blackheads!<br>  They are total menstrual starers.<br>  They lick eachothers feet every night.|`|VMY7No0eaa	SOUNDS LIKE YOU ARE a LOT immature!<br>  wait until you have a BOSS like this and get your pay or fired from them.  Or a co-worker takes all the credit for something you did!<br>  <br>  I would just do my work and stop name calling so much!|`|T7qgrOJzaa	Well maybe it's your attitude that's making so many people react megatively to you. Just be as nice as you can be and you'd be surprised how many people are nice in return.
GUVl3KiYaa	it's all about the lack of insecurities and being a happy fun person.
SCiY5JESaa	she aint diggin you|`|9GHhc9SBaa	It's hard to say, to me she seems like a tease.<br>   I think you should ask her, it's no use waiting around until it's too late. Also, she's offering you a kiss... if it isn't done yet ask HER where she would like to kiss you and if she looks confused just go ahead and kiss her yourself, that's one way to 'ask' her.<br>  Either she's just playing around or either she's a really straightforward girl and you're making her wait. There's no losing situation here, if she is playing around then she's probably aware that you're going to react to her touching you and... biting you (huh? XD) so when you ask her she'll probably have a made up excuse to let you down slowly. (That's what I think anyway O__o).<br>  I don't know, I mean personally I wouldn't throw myself at a guy unless I needed something important in return whether it's love, attention, passion,...<br>  Wow, hard question XD<br>  Cheers!|`|tIO8zYWBaa	oh no she doesn't like you one bit, stupid!|`|VmPk6Mvlaa	Hmm..well its alittle weird with the whole age thing...but personally to me, it sounds like shes interested you. I say go for it. You'll never know if you dont try<br>  =]|`|43sVTaCMaa	i think that she likes you.  why else would she act this way around u and not with any other guys?  she might think that your 18 or she's embarrassed to tell the class that she is interested in younger guys.  and never ever think that someone is out of your league; have more confidence in yourself; girls like guys with confidence.  it is so obvious that she likes you.
VBtzeVlKaa	I am sure that counseling to deal with your chilhood memories would help you move on from all that and find a meaningful, and lasting love..... OR you simply have not met that ONE person yet, who will make you feel safe and secure in a relationship and put her all into it and love you unconditionally for the wonderful person you are, knowing your past and all that comes with you, but understanding you, and loving you regardless. Someone you can tell everything to, and her all to you, holding nothing back... and in that freedom you will be set free to love as well. Love sets you free all the hurt and pain in the world. <br>  <br>  She is out there somewhere, believe me!  Once you meet HER, you will fall "in love" and you two shall soar to great heights  together...  :)   <br>  <br>  Wishing you all that's best in life!|`|V8JtHopoaa	You need a councilor. A family member of mine has just got 5 and half year in prison for child abuse to my 2 sisters just ova 20 year ago.<br>  1 is now 27, im 24 and younger sis 22.

Good luck xxxxxx|`|hHndD5SEaa	maybe your attitude isnt allowing you to be in love with someone? We've all been hurt at some stage or another - but you have to let down the boundaries and eventually let someone in.... sure it will be tough - and a massive risk - but it might just be worth it!!<br>  xx|`|gywXHuGCaa	i'm the exact same...<br>  <br>  it might be coz of this<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AkcT8IkfEW74UMaF_928GPPsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090223054433AA61iOr">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  answer it if you dont mind plz|`|ce9d90af4bd252d25ce81377df2eecc6aa	I feel very sad in reading this..My support and best wishes go out to you.<br>  I don't think that you should be concerned about falling in love.. As one day you may fall in love.. Life is forever changing.. Life is like a roller coaster.. Good and bad work together and in the end I think that your life will come together for the good.<br>  I think what happened in your childhood has inevitably hurt and damaged you.. So now what you need to do is start looking towards your future and not to stay focused on your past.. You can fix yourself and heal yourself.. You can win your battle and come up even stronger than before.<br>  You see I look at life as a battle.. I believe that people who have difficult circumstances can either remain negative and hurt or totally change there perspectives and aspects and turn their life around 360 degree's to be really positive and strong.. So that's what you need to do.. <br>  What you believe is what you receive.. So stop believing that your never fall in love.. You might really surprise yourself you know!!<br>  Best wishes and peace be with you always..
uoDhDLUvaa	ok this is exactly what is going on with my friend bry and jose and me.<br>  dan is no friend he is jealous<br>  jessica shouldn't believe dan and if she does it means that she is in doubt. if you ever lie to her she is gonna believe him. if you have never lied then you are not to worry. dan is no Friend ok. he shouldn't be spreading crap, weather it is true or not. you guys are friends and if he is saying stuff bout you then he doesn't want to be friends anymore. you should talk to dan and see if you guys are still best pals. explain how you feel bout what he is doing.|`|KdhNCnEjaa	You should punch the mother ****** in the face, dead serious, thats a low move|`|IWO1GTpGaa	Well I basically had the same problem, but the difference is I asked my "friend" will he be mad if I dated his ex.  He said no but once he start seeing us together he changed and stuff got funny.  I told my girl that my "friend" was jealous and if he says anything about me that isn't good don't believe it or come to me and ask me if it's true.  I got tired of him acting all funny and what not s o I actually confronted him and said, "Friend if you are mad at me for dating your ex then I'm sorry but I like her and I ain't gonna let you change how will fell about each other.  You broke up with her so apparently ya'll wasn't clicking and now another man stepping in and you just going to have to get use to it."|`|We6LuDEfaa	The best thing for you to do is to confront Dan in public and ask to speak to him.  Talk to him in private but still in view of public eye.  Explain to him that you have heard from Jessica what he has said about him in a non accusatory way and ask him if this is true.  Tell him that you dont want there to be any awkwardness between the two of you and that your friendship is more important than a girl(even if that might not be true).  If he reacts in anger he did it in public and looks like a fool. You end up looking like someone who tried to solve the problem maturely. If he doesnt react the problem is generally solved.|`|2efWKG2Uaa	Harsh. Well, I think you need to understand your friend′s situation first. Imagine yourself in HIS situation, how would you feel if one of your best friends suddenly started going out with the girl you love? because if he′s jealous now that means that he still loves her. Maybe he doesn't′t know how to deal with his situation. You should talk to him, be reasonable and understanding, be the mature one of the two. The kind one always wins. Then talk to Jessica about this, tell her the truth and about how this makes you feel.<br>  It′s a though procedure, but I′m almost sure that if you do it right, it′ll work. I have used this for many problems, and they′ve always turned out ok. Remember there are different perspectives in life, and that your friend is a human being, with feelings just like you. It seems dumb to hear this, but really, we forget it all the time, so it′s worth repeating.<br>  Good luck! I hope I helped!|`|LJoURlNYaa	Tell Him Straight, Are You Jealous Of Me?<br>  See What He Says, And Tell Jess, That He's Making All This Crap Up, If You Think This Is A Bad Idea, Do What You Thinks Best.|`|se27sAUwaa	You're so not going to like this..... You're in the wrong. Knowing that Dan and Jessica had a past relationship you really should have asked your best friend how he would feel about you dating Jessica. Obviously he's feeling hurt from it, whether it's because he still has feelings for Jessica or feels miffed that she likes you more. How would you feel if you wanted to hang out with your bestie and you ex-girlfriend is now prancing around?? It's not a nice feeling. Before you ruin your friendship you need to talk to him. Explain that you see he's distressed and you don't mean to be the cause of it. Ask him what you could do, short of breaking up with your new girlfirend, that would make him feel more comfortable. <br>  <br>  Also.. where are you getting this "Dan speaking with Jessica" tidbit?? Please don't say Jessica! The situation you're in is very very tricky. Right now, your're playing tug-o-war with your buddies. Guess who the rope is?? Patch this up before it becomes a mess. Not saying that your girlfriend is lying but just keep in mind that Dan does not want you with Jessica... or atleast feels uncomfortable about this. Jessica def. knows this and is liking it. One - b/c she's getting more attention now. And Two - once she can seperate you from Dan she'll get even more. Honestly, I would dump Jessica, nicely. You prob. won't be with her for long and after you break-up you'll be kicking yourself in the ***, head, balls, and anywhere else for losing your best friend over some silly girl.|`|SSnoi6QPaa	Don't do anything mean to him because your girlfriend probably won't appreciate it.  Talk to her about it and if she believes him have a CIVIL conversation with your friend Dan.  But remember, you broke a friendship code, you're dating his ex who he obviously cared about.  Even though he's taking the childish route, don't stoop to his level.  Be the bigger man.|`|GOFsAwHDaa	well looks like you love jessica a lot and DO NOT LET DAN ruin your relationship! because he is not worth it. Jessica should not listen to Dan if he is her x boyfriend because he does have nothing to do with you guys,! and if you are going to confront him tell him to stop because you guys do not care wtf he is saying!!1|`|99teIRU7aa	thats a pretty bad situation you got goin  on there. let me just say if your girlfriend belives him that is not good at all. i think you should confront him and say you have to stop lying about to my girlfriend just because your jelous of us.|`|LbJqU82waa	GO AND TRY OUT FOR ONE LIFE TO LIVE, FFOOL!|`|aDMAtfqZaa	YYYYYY *****|`|SsjXGhL2aa	Well, you should just talk to Dan.. If he doesint understand, F*ck em!|`|FoEWvYEsaa	you should never have dated his ex...believe me i know from experience..
OFJFLs2Paa	Wow that is a hard one. My brother is going through the same thing right now, but his girlfriend believes him. So I am going to tell you what I would do. Let him talk about you like that all he wants and make sure you find out all of what he is saying then prove your girlfriend that he is the liar! Or talk to your girlfriend about this. Asking or telling her that you don't want to loose her over someone that makes up things. Also you can talk to your friend and ask him why he is trying to mess with your relationship. Maybe you can get him someone for himself then maybe he will leave you alone. I don't know there could be many answers for this.
tpYrRQ5Vaa	Tell him to stop being a ****. Mine now looser (:
haCssg2Laa	he is taking the easy option thats for sure<br>  as for taking advantage? hmm kind  of, but not in a big way<br>  he should be saving everything he can to come see you and taking odd jobs to get some extra towards his fare<br>  he isnt doing that, so i would say he isnt exactly showing how much he cares in a big way<br>  <br>  i too would feel peeved, in your shoes, if he managed to muster up the money, i would then help him out with the fare, after he got off his backside and did some himself|`|4HoVVCenaa	Probably. I wouldn't pay his way over. If he really wanted to, he would put some aside for this purpose. And if he really wanted to, he could work the odd job or two. No offense, he sounds like a bum.
vQVAZM66aa	It obviously depends if the girl finds you interesting. Just make sure you choose appropriate pick up lines, or just have a natural sweet smile on your face when you look at her. It would be best if you just say Hi and look at her eyes [not somewhere down]. Don't touch [literally] her yet if you just met her, she might think you're a pervert. And don't ask for her Email or Number until the end of your conversation or acquaintance, that's just trying too hard.

QI9zF9Xqaa	well always the guy's ask you if your like 25 or 29 he will ask you if he say's ok i will talk to you later or i g2g then he is not interested in you if he say's just for a while u wanna come over that always takes like hour i've been through those then that means he is totally on you|`|0fVtHNtmaa	If he doesn't ask you, then ask him.

XsqQHKk0aa	Don't tell him just keep acting the way you have been. If you tell him you like him he might change and then that would ruin your friendship. And plus if you see him start to slip away,maybe then is the right time to tell him you have some feelings for him. But remember whats more important is that you stay his friend until then so you dont ruin your chances.

I had lots of pets, so nobody would rent an apartment to someone with lots of critters. I finally decided to give up some of the animals so I could go on with my life. I let go of the cats and rabbits, and my parents (God bless them) watched my dogs until I bought a house, a few years later. My sister left home early and then had to move back. My brother did the same thing, and I did not want to repeat what they did. So it worked out better that I waited.|`|4EWCegiRaa	A month before I turned 17 and I did it ALL by myself (including college unlike most people who say they moved out alone and their parents paid their bills).<br>  <br>  It was hard but I made it somehow.|`|xHc3KGDmaa	22|`|BRyRtQSvaa	18 and the only time|`|nAK82h6vaa	I was 18|`|vG0tsqJtaa	20.

They don't take seriously their own deal breakers or even know themselves well enough to know what they are.<br>  <br>  If sex is important to you, then it's not shallow to end the relationship if you've tried everything to improve it and it still can't be improved.<br>  <br>  FWIW:<br>  While I won't stay in a relationship where the sex starts off being bad, I will stay in a relationship and work at it if the sex changes for the worse due to a medical reason.  That's an entirely different thing to a new relationship where the sex is bad from the get go.

RtlL0PDcaa	dont worry. you know it happens in everyones life at some point or the other. you cant help it. you need to let people go sometimes. but dont worry everything is for good.if she is not happy with you try to correct your fault and rectify it. if you find there is no mistake on your part you cant do anything its her problem. she is wrong then.just relax. i know it hurts but if you people had to break up you will no one can change that. remember one thing. you will get only what you worn.

I do all the grocery shopping - he does all the laundry and everything else gets divided 50/50 as much as possible.

If both parties don't give 100% relationship will always have problems.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	I'm a single mom.  But this seems kind of petty to me, actually.<br>  <br>  It's dirty laundry that someone must simply throw into the washing machine, throw in the dryer and throw on a bed and fold, pretty much.  If he wishes to act like this, let him.  You don't have to own it.  lol<br>  <br>  I know you're saying it's about everything in the home, but from my perspective 50-50 doesn't seem all bad.  I've been doing 100% for so long...|`|RtkB46peaa	MOST, but not all, men do a considerable amout of work around the home that usually goes unnoticed, or unappreciated.  I take care of the cars, the yard, the fields, and the dog.  I do all the major construction around the house, and when something is broken, I fix it.<br>  <br>  And are you in a situation where he works and you stay at home with the kids? If so, um, he's got the whole "40-hours-busting-his-butt-at-work" thing going for him, doesn't he?  Isn't it funny how stay-at-home types often claim credit for all the little things they do all day to compare their contributions to their spouse?  Maybe this doesn't apply to you, but they give themselves credit for all their work, like laundry (1 point), dishes (1 point), changed the diapers four times (4 points), vacuumed (1 point), etc, etc, etc, but the person who goes to work and goes to meetings, gets yelled at, stressed out, and has to work with immature jacka$$es all day long gets only 1 point for their entire day at work?<br>  <br>  And more simply put, it wouldn't surprise me if he only does his own laundry for good reason.  Most guys throw their laundry in one load, throw some soap in, and hit "GO".  Women on the other hand, can be obsessed with their "system":  white with whites, dark blues with blacks, warm water for lighter colors, cold for darks, everything folded just the same, oh, and "THAT SHIRT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE HUNG, NOT FOLDED, WHAT WERE YOU THINKING YOU IGNORANT JERK!"  We men may not be the quickest witted people around, but we learn quickly when to avoid chores that will never, ever, ever live up to the "expectations" of the wife.   Can you tell that I don't do laundry anymore :)
K5lWkSNOaa	You should wait. You definitely do not want to cross the parents. If they did tell you were coming on strong, then you need to show them that you're not overbearing calling their daughter/son on their family trip. It's not your place to anyway. <br>  <br>  Best case is the person forgot to call you. Wait until they come back, and wait some more, and then call. No sooner! Worst case is they were mauled by feral cats on the way and got stranded with no cell reception. <br>  <br>  One, always respect the parents. Two, give space. Three, time. Everything will work out, but you need to chill out. Go to a movie, relax. He/she will come around when they're ready to. The ball is in their court mate with this one. <br>  <br>  Oh, and when they do in fact come around, the first thing you should do is apologize for being overbearing/obnoxious. That should straighten things out a bit if there are any rough edges.|`|4IVWMgp7aa	Don't call them.   They'll call you, if they really give a rat's patootey.  Especially after saying you were coming on too strong, let them make the next move, and decide how much contact they're comfortable with.|`|R8v712Gvaa	Don't call them.

6aKd0Kcjaa	and then what, you go and have an affair too,maybe you should make an effort instead of looking into his past and checking on he's tarty ex wife,be different to her by making him a better and considerate lover instead of destroying his confidence,the man must be pretty upset even today knowing that he's ex had two lovers pounding her probably at the same time too,and they slept in his bed sat in his sofa,i mean they intruded into his life and he's ex let it all happen it can destroy the best of people that thought,so be very entertaining and get him to open up a bit by you be the play maker,|`|707gOCvbaa	You would be insane to do that.

TyhbWMgraa	First off, I'm sorry that you have to go through this right now.<br>  Because I am in a slightly similar situation and I know how bad it hurts.<br>  <br>  There is nothing that you can do to change the things that you have done in the past. The best thing that you can do for yourself in this situation is to accept that you are human, and humans make mistakes. It is important to be able to forgive yourself for the choices that you have made.<br>  <br>  Ignore the awful things that others have to say. High school is a lot like a tabloid. Right now you and your indiscretions might be the cover story, but in a few days, someone elses issue is going to become the talk of the school.<br>  <br>  If you act mature and don't try and deny the things that you have done, your friends [and the rest of your school] will probably have a lot more respect for you. <br>  <br>  Good luck, and I hope everything works out for you.|`|f9473fa380913d1942ffc2e79943f65eaa	Rumor is just that a rumor . Its not your true character. Be more concerned with your character than a silly rumor. Talk is just that talk its as cheep as the mouth it comes out of weather its true or not. Don't sweat it . let it fly Don't call attention to it .Neither defend or explain you don't quote owe anyone an explanation. It will take you more years to build your character and keep true to that . Its what people want o get close to. Nothing can ever destroy your character. Ya embarrassing moments may creep up but you know your true inner self let that shine on through.|`|cTzayyEHaa	there was a rumur about me allso but i wasnt true and people are still saying it and it has been more then a year since it started, and it really pisses me off to. i dont think there is any thing you can really do except say people make mistakes. and if they are your true friends they will not keep talking about you.|`|N65IDUGKaa	well in all honesty all you can do is live with it..you took it upon yourself to tell your so called friends, now all you can do is wait till it dies out or someone else does something so peoples attention can look another direction...until than your stressing yourself for nothing|`|7fd87a77e7b1eab8e246db5eaa04f9abaa	ignore it. i know it isn't easy to do, but it is the best way to get rid of it. soon people will get bored, besides, you can prove the rumor is not true by simply being yourself|`|TOe9RPbeaa	ignore it... people just want to make you feel worse. so, just act normal and they will soon be bored. and the rumor will be history....<br>  <br>  <br>  Good Luck, Bella<br>  xoxo.|`|MfDRFP7faa	ignore it!<br>  \<br>  rumors are vicious|`|7b0903c0e39a55a5230350128e4fcff1aa	Don't admit to anything. Just say what you do is your business. Tell them to think what ever they want too. It will calm down eventually.|`|dMTx6QRaaa	deny it|`|8cWXhZGjaa	I remember reading in a psychology and communication book that ways you can silence rumors is to poison the well. To do that you  purposely keep the rumors going but gradually make them sound more ridiculous. That way once the rumor starts to sound ridiculous people will start to become skeptical. One example of how you would do it is, say that someone created a rumor that you had sex with another man. Keep the rumor going by saying you also had sex with two midgets and a bearded lady, then once the rumor spreads that you had sex with two midgets and a bearded lady,  tell them you also sex with a person that four eyes and a cyclops (seriously whats the likelihood of finding a bearded lady a person with four eyes and cyclops) then it starts get ridiculous and people then start to get skeptical. This may not be the best example I can think of but you kind of get the idea.|`|9b6a51f72b4ce44cd195fb24fccdaf8caa	Rumors in highschool can get ugly and there's no way to change them. I don't know what it is about teen girls that gets so hostile when it comes to the way they treat other teens. It's wrong and can mess up someone's whole life. <br>  You can ignore it as we all do but it seriously won't make you feel better. or You can confront them and tell them not to spread your personal stuff around but that will only lead to fights. Sorry I'm no help but someone reading this may do something one day to help teenagers succeed.<br>  <br>  Something needs to be done.|`|96ZfDF6Aaa	Only time will make it go away.  Soon someone else will be the victim of the gossip machine and will replace you.<br>  <br>  The more important factor is that you are ashamed of what you did. Your opinion will affect you more than anyone else's opinion of you.<br>  <br>  You need to find a way to make this right in your own life.  In the mean time ignore anyone who speaks of it.  Don't say a word.  Just keep walking.|`|7KOqTYYLaa	It's only a rumour if it isn't true, which it clearly is (true) so basically don't do it if you're ashamed of it.
17d0eca96aa4c9dc2a5df4922583bc31aa	Thats wierd....|`|fC8OPOTkaa	schizophrenia|`|WLLvMY3iaa	yes|`|AA10034000	Ask him when the last time was that he took his medication, seriously. Maybe he missed a dose and needs to take it. If not then go see a doctor and right away. Hope it all improves ....peace+|`|0fVtHNtmaa	Something's wrong with him. Dump him and find a normal guy. So much less drama|`|scnW0Wzeaa	No he's wacked!|`|lzooHi0Baa	When he asked you to be his girlfriend, was he waiving his hands in the air, talking to himself, looking around as if seeing something?   If not, you should talk to one of his family members and find out about his mental history.  None of us are fully normal but your b/f sounds like he is a candidate for schizophrenia and that is very serious.  If he has had symptoms since age 12, I am sure his parents are aware and would have seeked professional help for him|`|jMaG9EXtaa	I would consult with a Psychiatrist and ask.  They will give you the best advice and might want to see him, just to be on the safe side.  Oh and also find one at first that does not prescribe meds...You can get their advice and let them decide if he needs a Dr. that gives meds.|`|fLU63N4kaa	Make him get checked out or to go see a psychiatrist. <br>  <br>  Don't make any assumptions until you get professional advice.|`|kxAMOZAuaa	Run .. Run Fast..|`|KK718Xxaaa	schezophrenia|`|Ql0gi4rVaa	he is not into you<br>  he is bored with you<br>  move on|`|EcSbNWMbaa	he should go to the doctor about that.|`|fJxPw930aa	yeah !|`|Tuv79aXWaa	sounds like Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)<br>  he needs to go to a doctor to get that checked out and medicine. <br>  but I'm not a doctor, so I really don't know<br>  but thats what it sounds like.<br>  google it.|`|orabzb0Naa	He should see a doctor.  This would be considered strange by you and your friends and would be something you would have to deal with.  Hope he get better.|`|6uwGVD3jaa	That's really creepy. he should see a psychiatrist.

You're beautiful! you have AHMAZINGLY gorgeous eyes, and you have a great smile. The people saying that are probably just jealous. Don't worry about it.

You have to learn not to let what other people think about you determine how you feel about yourself. If you feel beautiful then you are beautiful. But as long as you think that you are ugly those vibes will be passed to those around you and they will feel your lack of confidence and not notice the beauty that you do have. Remember all girls are princesses. Its our birthright Didn't your father ever tell you that?|`|6uwGVD3jaa	I really don't know but i mean usually when people rate other people its on a scale from 1 to 10 and two is at the very bottom. But you never know it can also be at the top. And i mean don't let what a couple of kids at school are saying effect you, they're probably just jealous!|`|TnjNnVNraa	well where the pic? well you can let nobody Judge you,you should be able your self we all Beautiful in our on way if we keep worrying about what other think about us we will not get no where like that.. those dudes don't no nothing about you so don't get all down cuz of that you hear me! like me they tell me im so Beautiful i  have nothing to worry about but they don't no nothing beauty doesn't tell who you really are inside.|`|fc38e5eea7336d6a48ea669df9681bd9aa	Honestly, I think you just want attention. A girl that looks like that doesn't need other people to tell her she is pretty.<br>  <br>  Of course you are pretty. Definitely not ugly!<br>  You shouldn't worry what the "kids" at school have to say about you. <br>  <br>  And stop asking for so much attention by posting silly questions.|`|Swy5L6Mgaa	OMG. I so hope you are only joking. I didn't even look at the picture, but I can tell you this: NEVER ever let anyone else rate you. Or give a rat's a** when they do. You are so much more than your looks, so much more than somebody's opinion on you. If there are people out there unable to appreciate your beauty, it's their loss. Walk tall, smile and shine!<br>  Anna Presso|`|FuZwzMVfaa	Woa girl! Those peoples SO dont know what they're talkkin about! They're just jealous! Don't mind them! 9 1/2/ 10<br>  Im far worse than u think!|`|PcPswmv5aa	It is not in how you look in a picture.  If you are super confident in yourself all will want you.  Work on projecting confidence.  It works every time.  It takes about 2 months to make a change.  Start now.|`|UIhbJjQFaa	you have amazing eyes, really big with long eyelashes i am jealous and you have really nice hair and beautiful smile, you are very pretty|`|fLU63N4kaa	You are beautiful on the outside and I'm sure you're very beautiful on the inside too.

Just be like "Mom, he's my FRIEND not boyfriend, I'm aloud to have friends"|`|4EWCegiRaa	Let me tell you something I didn't know at 14 but learned at 17.<br>  <br>  At 14, some of my friends would be friends with (or date) 17 year olds and nobody would think anything of it.  Some people thought it was cool because they were older and more mature.<br>  <br>  However, at 17, I learned that any of my 17 year old friends that be befriending (or dating) 14 year olds had bad intentions or were bad people.  What would you think of one of your friends do something like that with someone who's 11.  Strange right?  Well, this is even worse.  And there are NO exceptions.<br>  <br>  And just because you feel one way now (like that you're just friends), doesn't mean you won't want more a year from now and it doesn't mean he's not wanting more now despite what he may or may not say.
hHndD5SEaa	i dont really think anything - they were probably just having a conversation with you making sure you were ok!!<br>  xx
UAMtRFruaa	I'm into it. Only because they have a lot of money and I don't have to do anything for them to share it with me.
1415133dda6d51b695452e406f5973a5aa	Human sexuality isn't a black and white issue buddy. I'm as strait as a razor, but I know that I love my hips and thighs, some strait guys love their **** (I don't know why, not enough breast feeding I guess *wink*) but the points that even from what I've heard from the gay community some pitch, and some catch, human sexuality is best understood as a very colorful thing. Just look at our ladies! They don't care as long as they're getting a dude hot, shoot, I'd get a kick out of it to have some fun with a lesbian, lmao, if they'd let me, shows the connection between human ego, and human sexuality too, but then again thats a perversion..... <br>  <br>  Hope that rambling helps.
j1fABNBmaa	I would recommend giving her a few years.  You obviously don't even really know if you love her or if it is just a passing fancy.  She is still young, give her a chance to enjoy her childhood.  Don't make her grow up before she needs to.|`|toLCaFc9aa	You should wait a few years. She is too young and you could scare her if you tell her now.|`|3jhLIUKyaa	few years|`|fPHjh4Jsaa	it's ok to like her but i think she is a bit young for anything really<br>  <br>  stop falling in love so easily, you don't even know what it is|`|y76ZHadsaa	okay. that's kinda weird. considering she is 11. . . give it a few years.|`|Zm3QIw4Taa	umm dude thats kinda weirdddd|`|BPoZPvGoaa	15 is an age of discovery.  you are in the midst of High School.  There is a lot more more in college, your first job...  There is at least 10 years of wonderful youth life laying in front of you.  I hope you will reconsider sticking with just 1 girl.<br>  <br>  The mere fact that you are asking these question(whether you like her or not) tells you that you are not sure about this girl.  The fact that your best mate is going out with her tells you she is not devoted to you.<br>  <br>  Love is a very funny thing, it provides warmth and pain.  It provide security and mistrust.  It even provides you with a lifetime warranty with an divorce escape clause!<br>  <br>  Bottom line is... You are still very young.  There are a lot, a LOT of things you have not experience yet.  However,  I am a true believer of Nature.  I think life should happen naturally and all things happen for a reason. Good luck to you!|`|2Kqlgxqkaa	i think uve just misinterpreted your feelings.<br>  you probably feel like you like this 11yr old, not for her, but because she reminds u of her sister.<br>  Dont act upon it, wait, relationships dont last forever.

Is this how you felt about her older sister? If so, don't exactly tell her, but kind of impose that you like her by the things that you do.Observe to see how she reacts. Then you will know if she likes you back. Then you can make your move.|`|kMfHWDVMaa	Well, I would say give it some time to sort out your feelings between the older sister and younger sister.

lWxUn0Xraa	i think you DO like him... if you didn't like him, you wouldn't write this novel asking if he does like you.
3c51ba3982b4a0fa984f838020963690aa	Are you dating my ex?  LOL.  Wow, he was totally like this, too.  Didn't understand the word "space" we humans need.  He always wanted to kiss me even in a park with kids playing around -- and he wouldn't understand why I'd be like, stop!  And if I wanted to leave at night, he wouldn't want me to go and he'd drag things out playing the gentleman walking me to my car and talking my ear off, then asking for a ride back to his door (it was a 2 minute walk from the lot), when really he was being rude not letting me leave to go home.  <br>  <br>  Anyway, sorry, flashbacks, lol.  I totally understand that smothering feeling that starts to sneak in.  At first you find all the attention flattering, but then it starts to just get on your nerves.  They cross that fine line and don't understand the natural queues.  It's frustrating.<br>  See if you can have a talk with him about this -- they tend to be sensitive and clueless, so try to do it gently but CLEARLY as possible.  Give it more time, give him time to adjust.  If you still don't see improvement in let's say after several weeks and a few reminders, tell him this isn't for you and you need to back out for good.  That's all up to you though.  How much you can take.  Good luck!|`|EjyD1sXeaa	he's really into you, more than you are with him. maybe you're his first real g/f or maybe he's just like that. you need to talk - communication is a vital foundation of any relationship|`|4lL6l0dFaa	He sounds a bit clingy. It sounds like you don't like some of his behaviors. I think that you should tell him that you don't like when he does those things. I don't think that you are paranoid. Everyone has limits on personal space, and no one likes their personal space to be violated. Just tell him how you feel. If he doesn't take your feelings seriously, then it may be time for you to be worried.|`|5ad48390d67eef1bf45ef9d3d3c02fe2aa	He likes you. If you like him back, stay with him. If you don't, let him go.
7uzLGR9gaa	He sounds like a good guy.  It seems like he is afraid of losing his youth.  He's graduating college soon and it's out to the real world.  Then he loves you enough to marry you.  He's looking at having a wife and a full time job as being old.  I think it's good that your giving him a little bit of space.  Maybe try doing your own thing for a little while and when he sees your doing good without him, trust me, he will come running back.|`|tPRRUs4Jaa	i guess all you can do now is just let him be and have his space and hopefully it'll work out the way you want it to. but just know that no matter what, it'll always work out the way it's supposed to. <br>  good luck!|`|X7z0KWXbaa	sounds like he loves you but isnt ready to spend his whole youth in a real relationship, it sucks but commitment issues are a real problem, perhaps if you had a break let things cool off and let him grow up a bit then u'll get back together, but for now theres no use forcing it because it wont get you anywher,<br>  <br>  it hurts but dumping you then acting like nothings changed is messing with your head, sounds like hes keeping you around til hes figured what he wants but hes leading you along|`|pgJ9lvyMaa	The best thing for you to do is to let him go.  Don't take his calls, don't agree to see him (unless he's in the hospital or something) and start trying to move forward. <br>  <br>  Don't set a "time frame" because, well that never works.   Work on you for now, and while it won't be easy, in time your heart will heal.  I hope he realizes he's being stupid, and you guys work out, but don't "wait" around.  Live your life to the fullest.|`|6uwGVD3jaa	I say give him time. Maybe he wants a break from the whole scene. I just suggest you avoid him for now and if he acts like you guys are going out again then seriously set down the law. It may hurt but it will give him another reality check and he will realize he cant live without you.|`|4Lzf3wenaa	time is the only thing now. He needs to be able to think. It's not you, it's him. Just give him time and I'm sure things will work out.|`|F8t4fAm1aa	maybe he cheated on you so he's protecting you from the real reason of you guy's breaking up.he's probably feeling guilty and thinks he doesnt deserve you so its best breaking up|`|A5ElEAleaa	leave him, there are other guys out there.<br>  or you could just wait for him.<br>  but i think you should leave him.|`|VtJ5kRgIaa	what was his reason for breaking up?.. and if hes acting that way hes still got feelings for you|`|0LwNYEUdaa	The reality is that you guys are both young. The strange truth is that ex's tend to get along better for the most part when they are not together. Even married couples get tired of each other. Like someone else stated, there could be two factors.<br>  One, he has cheated<br>  Or two reality has kicked in. When you are young like about 20- 25 you are still in your exploration years.You are basically either discovering yourself or trying to finding yourself. You may think its love buts really its far from love. He may be able to appease you physical, mental, sexual appetite of that sort but you guys haven't even touch the essential fundamentals of  a committed relationship and the true understanding of its beauty. If he needs his space give it to him but don't allow anyone to have you running around in circles.|`|2QvgTFYsaa	If you give him his space and he's still treating you like a gf when he sees you, ask him what his deal is. Tell him that he's sending you mixed signals and that he needs to make up his mind. You shouldn't be forced to wait around hoping he'll change his mind. You need to know for certain. Call him up or go see him, and decide on one way or the other. It can't be both.|`|WLLvMY3iaa	He wants to fool around silly! I would move on, let him sow his wild oats, maybe he will miss you if you don't let him paw all over you like you are still his girlfriend.  If he doesn't realize that he wants you, at least you won't be pining for him while he is getting his tastes satisfied.|`|SO7zRZK9aa	Why did he break up with you in the first place? And are you asking how much time until you should try dating him again, or how much time you should stop hanging out with him to get over it? Is this a temporary break up so he can focus on school or work or w/e, or permanent?
TCqrS8Vqaa	hiya ann, seeing the birth as turned him of.my husband was the same.it took months, before he told me why he had gone of sex with me.stop giving him oral,as all the time he is having oral,its a replacement for sex.cut out the oral,dress sexy and one night after a week or so with the oral,cook a meal have a drink,listen to music,and do what you do to get him in the mood.but no oral.then hopefully that should do the trick.its worth a try good luck.|`|492681182d7c9b1f14276670369e851baa	Stop giving him oral sex for a start.<br>  <br>  Then give him a set amount of time to change.  If not, then do something about it.|`|b3c054cf8a809cd78b23404a2feecb7daa	Perhaps hes afraid of you getting pregnant agai, even with protection. He may feel like another baby would be the last thing he'd want right now. Apart from that, I'm afraid I have no idea. I don't think hes having an affair, but don't rule it out either. Perhaps its worth being a bit more observant about where hes going and what hes doing. I don't wish to make you paranoid, but its a possibility.|`|hHndD5SEaa	sounds to me like hes scared of having another baby!!! Talk to him about it - sort out some form of contraception to ensure it wont happen again and if he still wont agree to sex... then theres a much deeper problem between ye<br>  xx|`|0SoDvjU7aa	did he look down there during the birth???|`|hNCiw6Laaa	A woman will never understand a man...We hold things in and dont let them out...|`|eL268hETaa	Is he afraid of the possibility of making another baby?  Does he not find you attactive anymore?  If it were me, I would ask him flat out of he is getting it elsewhere and if he wants out of the relationship.  Don't spend so much time trying to please a man who doesn't want you.  Just find someone else who can treat you like the treasure that you are!|`|hIjtkN0daa	your hubby is an idiot. <br>  <br>  My advice - is lay it out on the table - get some counciling if he is afraid of your bits are seeing child birth or you walk. <br>  Good luck|`|raxnazWKaa	Much like in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, maybe he is gay|`|hOTrfGHEaa	if i wasnt getting anything back he wouldnt get oral|`|gCP6uZOvaa	A straight man passing up easy sex with a girl, SHAMEFUL!!!|`|3zm0jA0yaa	did he see you deliver your child? some men get turned off by all the blood and gore of childbirth and never say a word about it to you, but do things like this because of it. If it's not because of that then I'd say the guy is cheating on you for sure. Not hardly any men go that long without sex without getting it somewhere else. You've got some serious problems girl, and without him talking about it it won't get resolved. I'd say get the guy to talk to you seriously about whats going on in his head.
VCX7S3d6aa	Awww you seem like a lovely person and was willing to give him up for your friend ! I hope you know how much of a good friend you are ! but like you said, she texts alot of men and its only things like 'Hi how are'... pretty much general chat ! but if your really intrested in him maybe its time you put your self first for once ! go for it, you never know !|`|YFXusnT1aa	Same thing happened to me, I liked a girl whose friend liked me.

This early on neither of you can know who would be a better match with him and it would be ludicrous for her to get mad at you.<br>  <br>   But be weary of him since it sounds like he could be a player and not worth either of you twos time!|`|i4bjQbPcaa	Speak to her and tell her that he has been texting you too.

If he was really interested in either of you for who you are instead of after a fling he'd not be after you both. <br>  <br>  He sounds like hes just trying his luck to see who he can get and I think you'd be best staying well away and find someone you won't risk damaging your friendship over x<br>  <br>  <br>  now uve put additional details ill take that back- he didnt ask for her number and hes clearly flirting with you and not her... you should go for it! why did she go out of her way to get his number though- or was that before you sai u were interested...? xx|`|onrcmQf8aa	You should communicate to your friend that you like that guy.

But,  if she is interested in him - then one of you need to back off of him.<br>  <br>  It's not cool to step on a friend's toes when it comes to dating men.  That's a type of action that should be reserved for your enemy.

And if your friend texts so many boys, who's to say she is really pursuing this one guy for sure?|`|hHndD5SEaa	I think you should just ask your friend if shes interested in him romantically - tell her that you two had met and got on and you'd like to persue things with him but need to know shes ok with it.<br>  xx|`|AA10478980	Just let things play out.

sr0vZPQqaa	You're doing the right thing by not being too clingy, normally in the first few weeks  the person will find time to speak/text however busy they are. By you not overdoing it she will more inclined to text herself.|`|62bdfaff99eb94891a0098fdd62fe168aa	give her space -<br>  If you love something set it free if it comes back to you it is yours if not it never was.|`|I5P2OSAjaa	call her in a few days and see what's up (if she hasn't talked to you by then). stand up for yourself and tell her if she's too busy, fine, but you can't wait around. don't let her get into your head. realize the situation you may or may not be in, and look out for yourself. i'm not saying be mean to her, but figure out what's going on and make a rational decision.  good luck|`|xJ2kcJsraa	dude, believe it or not. people do have other things other than wait for your phone calls or talk to you.<br>  <br>  clingy? definitely. 2 days and you're already whining...<br>  <br>  i don't call mine in like a week and she's still okay about it. she's not insecure, not like you. relax. if she tells you she likes you. then take her word for it.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|fqboOITjaa	Wait until she contacts you, she wanted the space so give it to her. If you try contacting her now only after two days then she'll probably think you're clingy. <br>  <br>  I know it's hard, believe me, but it'll pay off in the end!|`|3zm0jA0yaa	First of all you got to relax, and try not to read all this stuff into something that is probably not there. You have to just take a leap of faith in a relationship. That's why they are so scary sometimes. Cause you can't read another persons mind. You have to just trust in what they are saying. If you have a question about something just come right out and ask. Wouldn't you want the same from hare if she felt something was going wrong? It clears the air so much more quickly and you don't spend time running yourself crazy with these, what ifs! The best thing to always be if the relationship is working out , is to be honest. Upfront and faithful. She will not forget you. I don't even think it 's possible to forget someone that quickly. Today ppl. seem to read  bull into things they are not sure of. Why not just come right out and ask if you have a concern. Thats what I believe anyway. If she is trying to avoid you, you will pickup on little lies and things that don't make sence. Trust your gut. Always trust your gut, and ask her things you're not sure of.  Good~luck!<br>  '|`|AA10097443	Trust your gut,,If your last time together was great... then what has changed..sense then..?  Space is good.. send a thank you card one that's funny a light heart ed.. show your fun side. Why would she forget..are you saying that you are forgettable or as the song goes un-forgettable..? ask your self this..if not keep on keeping on..let her contact you next ..if she does not contact you keep on keeping on.|`|nmiXLhwCaa	Keep giving her space, if you come off as needy she wont want you!  Spending time apart will NOT make her forget about you at all, it may even make her want you more.  Try to relax and focus on other things, play a video game or something.  It will all be ok:)|`|AA11363993	yes, i would give her a little space, if she says she has been busy, you have to trust her.  If she really likes you, she won't forget you, she will call you.|`|94C2U5FLaa	call/text her now!!! she prolly wants u to text first.she would be thrilled!!|`|PD2opzXdaa	I would call her invite her out to dinner and express what you just said to us.   Communication is always the best key - now you may get your feelings hurt if she tells you that she is interested in someone else, but that's what you have hear so that you can move on if needed.  Clingy, is never good - where's your friends, family, co-workers?  Some women ( I said some)  like a man that has a life as well and is not up under them.  Relationships are just complicated!  Wait, did you guys establish that you were even in a relationship yet?<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|oeXnhiPWaa	Being clingy is one of the worst things you can do, so I'd leave her for another day or so. Set up something with her for the weekend, then if she says she's not busy, you can still see her but give her space.<br>  Also, she really could just be busy, and the beginning of a relationship may be utterly amazing but eventually you both (I don't mean to imply that your not by the way) need to get back to your normal routines and things you still need to do. The novelty wears off, if you like. But that doesn't mean it won't be good again.
RyYV3aXlaa	we're men we're pigs and we lie. what part of that don't you understand ?|`|M9y1X8lgaa	He is lying  to you if random women are sending him naked pic's he is prob meeting for random sex with them and if he is a 24 y o virgin then he is just weird and i think a lire|`|rAXkpuzIaa	I don't know, but run fast & far!|`|zx0IQ1Fsaa	break up with him! <br>  <br>  there are more fishes in the pond and some are gold fishes|`|G25VY8Anaa	yes he is very weird lol
paV2LdR9aa	He probably lied because he thought you would think he was weird if he told you thr truth - that he'd never had a girlfriend.<br>  Obviously that kinda backfired because now you think he's weird because he lied!!<br>  When he was telling you stories, he was probably just re-telling stories about his friends/brothers girlfriends.<br>  Well I suppose you can look at it two ways, either think 1) If he's that good at lying, what else can he lie about (which I can guarantee is what most women would automatically do) or 2) Just think that he was trying to impress you in the first stages of your relationship and wanted you to think he was normal. <br>  If he's 24 and never had a gf before, he'll probably be super embarrassed about it. Personally, I'd give him the benefit of the doubt, but it's your call.|`|swV3SIw7aa	well honestly i dont trust liars<br>  but why should you be creeped out?<br>  i dont understand...<br>  <br>  help me please...?<br>  i updated and im still hella confused....<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090219080118AAVzKJF&r=w">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|QQv8f1vRaa	well maybe he was jus tryin too look more experienced and maybe tryin to stay on ur level. just tlk to him about it and see what the point of it was

Maybe you're sad because of a sad event in your life, but you have to realize that there are people experiencing worse than what you're feeling [say children suffering from abuse and harassment, helplessly being poor etc]. (Instead of complaining about small things, we really should do more helping).<br>  <br>  Just look at the bright side of you're life, I'm sure you'll get what you want someday as long as you work hard for it. :]|`|wE7lLCHSaa	I'm pretty happy.  I didn't used to be.<br>  <br>  Yeah, the world sucks and it's full of rotten bastards who will stab you in the back to get a little more for themselves so they can buy more useless crap.<br>  <br>  But sometimes people can really surprise you.  And sometimes you fall in love and everything's just going perfectly.  And sometimes you have an amazing new experience that you'll remember forever.<br>  <br>  There's tons of bad stuff, but that's life.  I like to think of it as a ride.  I don't really have much control over anything -- I'm just trying my best to enjoy the ups and downs.<br>  <br>  On another note, don't worry too much about needing to feel happy.  People got along fine for millenia without worrying about silly things like happiness.  In spite of what modern pop culture tells us, you really don't need to be happy.  Many people aren't, and the few who are probably are so because they aren't even thinking about it.|`|AeLT0lLFaa	i'm happy. music makes me happy. jogging makes me happy. <br>  i agree that love sucks, especially when you don't know what your crush wants...<br>  but, that's why you gotta move on and not dwell on things, if you do then your life sucks.|`|pz6ZDgjhaa	i am i got a great boyfreind, dumb friends, stupid drama, and great sex.

He probably already knows that you're not making much money, so it's unlikely he'll ask for a lot.<br>  <br>  He may just have you pay the difference in utilities or buy some groceries.<br>  <br>  He may tell you that he thought this was a short-term arrangement so he would rather you save your money to apply toward your own place in a few months.<br>  <br>  If you're not going to school, you should probably try to find a full-time job.  If you're looking for another school, definitely get started on that and find out what your options are.  That way you can present a plan to your brother later on.|`|AA11767076	You seem to do a lot around the house that he would normally have to do himself or pay someone else to do.<br>  <br>  If you were my younger brother or sister & you were living with me while you were figuring things out & helping out as much as you are, I would not want to take a dime from you!<br>  <br>  Just make sure that you do not wear out your welcome.|`|Tyi6rEtcaa	The matter ought to have been settled prior to your moving in.

The work you do around the house can make up for the lack of rent, but a token amount of $50 or $100 a month could help out with the utilities.<br>  <br>  start looking for a better job or enroll in  college or trade school if you need skills to get a better job.|`|h6NqNzHAaa	Yes you should, but you should negotiate for the work you do around the house.

Just make sure you will be able to recognize if her feelings will really be love for you & not just a rebound or someone to have around until she finds someone else. This is something she can do unintentionally.|`|8bpR8wjLaa	you should just wait until she gets over with all the break up thing with her ex and just be more nice to her and make her laugh and stuff that will make her feel better and then if she feels better and forgets all about it you can tell her how you really feel about her!!<br>  good luck with that!!|`|ekfdyQxyaa	i have same problem;)|`|rQhsONxRaa	this exact same thing happened to me so i suggest that u give her time...maybe she's not ready to go into another relationship...<br>  if she doesn't feel like it's going to work then trust her because if u keep asking her to try it won't work and you might even end up not being friends with her|`|94C2U5FLaa	be friends with benefits first. ur talking about her loving you!??? cool your jets bud! hookup with her more and more, and eventually ask her to be ur gf
ephBKMthaa	At least she is being honest with you.  Or perhaps she's bored because she's interested in someone else.  Either way - doesn't matter.   You could make it without her, when she says she loves you  . . but.  BUT NEGATES - meaning she doesn't love you the same way you love her.<br>  <br>  I  you truely love her - and I'm sure you do - set her free and see what happens.   If it's meant to be it, it will be - you can't make it happen.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|NDFN04sqaa	Try to mix it up a little, do things that you don't normally do.  Also listen to some of her suggestions on what she wants to do, even if its not somthing you like.  Relationships are about give and take.  If this doesn't help maybe she isn't the one.  You can't spend your life running around trying to make her happy because in the end you are not really going to be happy yourself.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|hHndD5SEaa	if shes bored then bring a bit of life to the relationship - try new things - go new places- maybe head away for a weekend somewhere - things that can inject a spark of life back into your relationship!<br>  xx|`|F4kFUxd1aa	For some strange reason when we love someone too much and we show it, they take it for granted. Maybe she is a little too comfortable in the relationship and needs a little challenge. If u try not calling her too often for example a week or so it will definitely spice things up. u will see a change but don't overdo. It may sound harsh and risky but try this method and see how she responds to it|`|rUsFKFQ8aa	Dya no what, i feel the same way with my boyfriend at the mo, a bit bored but i still want 2 be with him definately the thought of not being with him hasnt even crossed my mind.<br>  we have just chatted and we decided we are just going to do more stuff 2gether as we have got in2 that whole routine malarky! start doing simple things like just saying 'come on lets go out for a walk' if you don't normally go for a walk or take her out for a meal but don't plan it, just decide one night. Your girlfriend just needs a bit of excitement i would think!<br>  sure things will be fine. <br>  xx|`|5acf40d2aa61e65eff15834add1f7bd5aa	let her try living her life and you do the same......|`|ff4GztaTaa	It sounds to me like you may have become too comfortable in the relationship. Possibly, in her mind, you have ceased to be the funny, exciting fella that took her out to nice places, always made her laugh,etc.<br>  I would try to sit her down and talk it  through with her. Ask her why she is bored, what she misses about you and the relationship,and how she would like things to progress, without coming across as desperate or needy. Women are really put off by that. <br>  Then each day,say to yourself, "I'm going to make her feel like she could be in a room of 1000 women. She would look at them and their relationships,and still think she's got the best deal."<br>  One more word of advice. Don't start smothering her, that'll have her heading for the door really quickly.    I wish you luck.
JKlKmAcwaa	when losing your virginity anne there isn't a 100% way to ensure you won't get pregnant, using birth control methods (the pills, the patch, and IUD, a diaphram) in conjunction with a condom is going to put you risks low, very low -- but not 100%.  Sorry about that.  <br>  <br>  Avoid all STD's by always insisting the guy wear a condom, he will argue this probably, but in the end INSIST. Now you specifically asked aobut HIV/AIDS (with good reason) however there are other dangerous diseases out there and you should be aware of them as well.  I included 2 link that can make you familiar with them.   <br>  <br>  how do you do it the first time -- well, missionary style probably, slow and gentle.<br>  <br>  what boys like -- as long as we are getting something, we LIKE IT.|`|mtOVRAnbaa	WEAR A CONDOM!! simple!!

The condom will protect from you getting pregnant and gettting a disease. I recommend that you get to know the guy a LONG time before you lose it b/c he could have a disease, and believe it or not, he could give you an infection if he isn't clean. But if I were you I would just wait until your married, that way you don't have to worry about getting pregnant, getting a disease, worrying about how he likes it, etc.|`|XWWlLizZaa	well the only 100% way to not get pregnant or diseases is to not have sex (obviously) but other than that birth control and condoms are the best.   don't be like me...me and my boyfriend used the pullout method when i lost it (3 days ago) and now i'm getting nervous.  as for what guys like...i think the fact that your a virgin should be good enough!            good luck!

(no offense) then yes.|`|dvNWbUgLaa	Good for you for staying away from drugs and alcohol!<br>  I wouldn't bring anyone home while your dad is there if I were you.

m16gf9mzaa	You know, I think this is a big warning sign.  He doesn't even trust his own mother?  Remember that in a relationship, you cannot change the other person.  It is possible he could decide to change himself.  But this is the kind of issue that he would need some real therapy for.  <br>  <br>  So, ok, great, if you suggest he go into therapy, and he actually takes the suggestion.  <br>  <br>  But what if he does not take that suggestion? Well then, you get to decide if this is the kind of relationship you have always dreamed of having, then you should certainly stay with him. Or maybe you have always dreamed of being in a relationship with trust, real intimacy, and reliable affection - if so, it may be time to let this guy go so you have room in your life for the kind of guy who can give you the kind of relationship you dream of.|`|e640e5fc04f1c4da3326c5429e707bdcaa	As you said, this is his issue...obviously he is not able to handle a loving relationship.

Tell him to grow up and get it together.|`|WLLvMY3iaa	Tell him he could be in big legal trouble for filming someone without their consent.  Disgusting and disrespectful.  Guess he didn't hear about those guys being sued for taking pictures with their phones when their victims didn't know.|`|sr0vZPQqaa	No harm in looking but to record it! perv|`|fLU63N4kaa	All guys like to look at a woman. It's not really a bad thing, as long as it's done with respect. Recording a woman is showing a total lack of respect. You have a right to be mad! <br>  <br>  What I do find amusing is that men think women love it. And yes, the ones who lack self-worth secretly like it, but women who actually respect themselves are disgusted by it.|`|kdmhuVTEaa	It's not really close to cheating if you think about it.<br>  He's only filming them he's not groping their ***.<br>  <br>  Men are born with the natural instinct to be attracted to woman. I would not be too upset. <br>  If your really all that bothered confront him about it.<br>  My boyfriend says that he looks at girls bum's sometimes. He said he can't help himself, But then he says that he's with me not them.<br>   but he'd never record them. So whether it's just your bf i don't know.|`|0fVtHNtmaa	The fact that he admits that he looks at other girls a$$ and boobz is a big red flag. Of course he's going to do things like that because he's a douchebag. You already knew it.|`|4G5KZSY6aa	there's nothing to panic...that's just GUYZ...but a TRUST test for you...just try to get this info from his mouth pretending that you don't know about it...if he tells you the truth then there's nothing to worry|`|JQq53j3Kaa	he's a guy, it's what guys do, you should feel free to look at other guys too. You guys are together but it doesnt mean you cant admire other people's bodies. And just remember- he's with you- not them.|`|YkLAFRAxaa	that is sooooo discustingg he sounds like a real jerk!!<br>  i know you probly love him alott because 2 years is a long time but you should be the only girl hes looking at!|`|EcSbNWMbaa	You need to keep that boy on a leash. (:|`|na8ObA5Haa	Here is the simple part:<br>  He is a pig, Guys that are nasty and disrespectful do that, its obvious you deserve someone so much better. <br>  <br>  Now for the hard part:<br>  You have to decide if you are willing to put up with his behavior or do you want to drop the past two years you have spent together over this.  This isnt a descision anyone can help you with except yourself. you are the only one that knows your relationship's potential,  My advice to you is weigh out the( Pro's & Con's) and see what you get out of that, Definitley talk to him about this let him know what you saw, and tell him how your NOT ok with it. <br>  <br>  <br>  good luck! be smart! everything happens for a reason!|`|VZVGXRyraa	Well, i personally don't walk around and stare at other girls' bodies. And i would never think about recording it. That would be mighty disrespectful to my fiancee.<br>  <br>  But since this is so clearly bothering you, confront him about it calmly and rationally. Let him know what you found and how you feel about it. Tell him that you would really appreciate it if he wouldn't do anymore recording. He's open with you, so you be open with him.|`|qRDHEGHJaa	UMMM yeah sorry i could see if they was a text to him from someone else but for him to video tape it on his phone thats not right to you or to them girls he is doing it to. Thats not normal honey. im sorry i would say something to him right away bc if he is happy with you why would he think hmm she has a nice azz take his phone out press the record button and watch it????? dont think so and if he feels comfortable to do that what else is in store????|`|qroOTyrGaa	Be very careful, because if he has so little respect for a woman that he'll videotape that kind of stuff, then it means that he doesn't have respect for you. Also take a look at who he hangs out with, if his friends are a bunch of losers than the apple doesn't fall far from the tree. If you start to be more confident with yourself, eventually you'll realize you're too good for these men. But seriously, it's time to start dating men who aren't shallow idiots.|`|JjwQMN3laa	You're jealous.... Sit down, cool off... and don't go through his phone. Very untrustworthy of you. You're complaining about a couple of videos of asses... Think about how he would react if you told him you were suspicious and snooping and went through his ****... And ladies, don't try and deny that none of you NEVER look at another man sexually... Everyone does it, and those that deny are a bunch of bullshitters. Females have double standards, realize this and live on...|`|uCVaw2F0aa	If I were you, I would confront him about it first. If you think that he is lying. Leave for a few days. Then go back to his phone ans delete those videos. Then ask him if he wants you back. If he says yes. Then go back to him. If he does it again. leave that b***ard. no affence|`|5ROjgZggaa	DO NOT LISTEN to any that say that is just what guys do deal with <br>  you desevre better.<br>  but when you approcah him (which you should) dont freak out on him<br>  truth is he will probably just tune you out<br>  he will be more responsive if you are calm ask let him talk and you will be able to reach deeper in him|`|SJBJ85caaa	you should talk to him about it and tell him how you fell.and if he dosnt care u should take a break from him.not every man in the world is like that he just dosnt appreciate you like he should.just remember there are more fish in the sea.|`|7PtpibEcaa	wow, that would make me mad too..<br>  well not all dudes are like that<br>  yours is, hes a perve (no offense)<br>  but thats just how he is but, hey he is honest with you thats what mainly matters, he was open with it.|`|qoq9WlPxaa	Sounds normal to me.<br>  <br>  but then he should learn to control himself, and you should let him know that it upsets you. But as long as you let him get away with it, he will keep doing it.|`|ebI6ubrgaa	Dump him, he's obviously not mature enough to be in this relationship. If he doesn't want to settle down that's not your problem. Just get rid of him and find something better.|`|BDpkauR2aa	confront him and tell him how you feel ............    and if he really loves u he will stop looking|`|AA11454791	guys are pigs, get used to it.|`|3yWAyps4aa	hes a perv|`|4YpXyNnDaa	You've been dating for 2 years? That's bs.  <br>  Yes he might look and that's what guys do and I can understand that, but in a sense "cheating" is anything that you wouldn't show your partner. (advice from a famous psychiatrist), and I don't think he'd "film" these girls' asses when you are sitting right beside him<br>  I'd confront him but seriously thats ridiculous, any of my friends wouldn't have that and neither would I.<br>  2 years is not worth that sh**|`|6CPFRnGraa	What I really think you should have done first is approached him about it, not ask people on yahoo answers. You won't get very many intelligent suggestions on here. If you haven't confronted him about it yet, then I would suggest you do that. Don't freak out on him though, tell him calmly how it made you feel to see those videos and that you don't like it. If he blows you off then he will most likely keep doing stuff like that, which may lead to worse things than that. I wish you the best of luck.|`|shg4egWIaa	NO, guys don't do that. Not the kind you'd want to be your bf anyway. If a guy's going to be yours, he needs to keep his eyes off everyone else. I'm not saying (as a guy myself) that we don't have to fight off temptation. But if this guy's in a relationship with you and making videos of other women's back ends, then he's not that committed. He's obviously looking for something in other places. <br>  <br>  Think about it, if he's recording this on his phone, it's because he wants to watch it again and again. Do you stare at other guys?|`|nMSV2kcVaa	He's low and you need to leave him, like, now.<br>  <br>  Unless u like prevs..lol|`|xJBJn6dOaa	okay, 1) don't go through your boyfriend's phone. 2) guys have weird stuff like that. would you freak out if you found out he had dirty movies or magazines? He's just a guy, relax. 3) he's not cheating on you, he's just a guy. It could be a lot worse... he could actually be cheating on you. Let it by
GhmGtG3Gaa	Sweetie, you wasn't stupid for making out with him!!<br>  Don't let that get to you, stuff like that happens!<br>  You should talk to him about it and see where yall stand!!<br>  You'll never know what'll happen, some of the greatest relationships is based on being really good friends!!!|`|WFYtrtRmaa	suck it up<br>  <br>  put this in perspective<br>  <br>  think about what OTHER people are going through<br>  *rolls eyes*<br>  <br>  srry to be a ***** but comon|`|XLjSYo67aa	your stupid for making out with him!!!! lol jkjk liza geez well then um idk i just wanted to say hi and hows it going girlie.............girlie..................<br>   la lala omg why does marissa think AIDS is funny its a ******* disease!! geez lol well if i would think he probably got caught up in the moment and thats why he kissed you and i think everything will be a okay love!!<br>  <br>  ~chrissi<br>  (bring sexi back, yep)

Or they resisted the training.|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	Some men are simply physically unattracted to pregnant women.  Clearly, it is wrong to cheat on one's wife, even if you're not feeling attracted to her.  But the combination of being unattracted to his wife, being attracted to other women, and possessing inadequate honor and self control, can result in cheating.|`|sRsGTgqIaa	Because they need the sex from different women to feel like a manly man?|`|H3WHxCgaaa	I wouldn't know - that wasn't a problem in my marriage.|`|HL8PEDFLaa	what?

And she had to go bathroom..   but accidentally, she hit flush while she was still sitting on the toilet...   if you dont know, toilets suck the "stuff" out, not like on the ground, so she got suction cupped to the toilet, haha..   well, also in the bathroom in a button to call for assistance. so she hit it, and a sturdes came..  The stuardes pulled on her arms for a while, but couldnt get her off....  so they calloed a secound stuardes....     they each puylled on a hand, working and working on getting her off. as you can imagine, she was pretty humiliated at this point...  but it got worse. as they could not pull her off, they had to call in a co pilot or something "boy"  and he had to stick his hands behind her and pry her off..  when the suction finaly popped, she went flying out off the bathroom, straight out in front of the first class.<br>  <br>  i bet she was glad to get off that plain...<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  2<br>  <br>  There one was a very young girl "true"  she was very little, and found the absolute best hideing place in a roll of carpet by the wall.  but it took so long, and they didnt find her, that she began to have to go bathroom.  she didnt want to give away her spot so she didnt call. but sadly she couldnt get out....  eventual, she wet,  and iot didnt turn out pleasant....<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  well i hope that helps....  if all else fails...  try singing, that always chears me up..  kind of sing your thoughts, your hopes, anything...|`|AA11410067	ha ha ha excellent... keep it up.

CHlxBbkHaa	Well... have her tested for STDs... that would be an easy way to determine if she could have given some guy herpes.  <br>  <br>  Generally though, if you don't trust her and think she could be cheating on you, you should break up with her.  A relationship without trust isn't much of a relationship.|`|uoEfoI7aaa	if you have to ask the question, chances are she is cheating on you dude.|`|6AzWUY8Gaa	I can't say that she is cheating. There is a possibility that the guys calling you are friends to the one she cheated with before. Haven't you thought about why you get the same calls at around the same time? I think those guys know each other and want you and your girl to break up.<br>  Continue having faith in her and all will work out for both of you, be careful though, and watch her closely.<br>  <br>  All the best of blessings.|`|vP00YUsLaa	no **** you should be suspicious. my bf and i told each other that even if we were drunk and we ended up having sex with someone we didnt know it'd be our faults. why, you ask? because if we really loved each other, we would know how to take care of ourselves and protect ourselves from people who would probably wanna have sex with us. for example, im out clubbing with my friends.. i'll drink a bit but i make sure to keep my drink with me, if i lost my drink somewhere, i'll leave it. if im totally wasted, then i have the worst friends ever for not watching over me. i shouldnt be super wasted to begin with. anyway, so now you're getting calls from three stueges you dont know. u never know maybe she is cheating on you, or not. i understand you love her, but its really all up to how you feel about her. meaning... the fact that she said no and yet you still felt suspicious means you really need to check up on your girl.

waBq57jcaa	You just answered your own question "I'm still in love with my ex" . In order to really "move on" you have make room in your heart for someone new. You should be honest to your current BF and be honest to yourself, and ask "am I ready to be in a relationship".|`|HdQRETyQaa	I have experienced this.<br>  It's so hard.<br>  But it really doesn't sound like you have moved on.<br>  You need to forget about him.

Don't think of him too much. Your bf might get hurt, if he knows that you ex still have a place in your heart.
4e983j3Zaa	to be honest, the appearance does count for something. it's the first thing we see. but to me, there needs to be a mental connection. so which ever one can stimulate me mentally and physically would be best. and a great personality, character and sense of humor wouldn't hurt either.|`|tVDzc6qAaa	anything is preferable to obese|`|XCDz8BVHaa	the sweeter and more loyal one|`|ljiIgYFoaa	Is this a trick question?|`|AA12235978	Someone with a good personality.

ZDqdYhdGaa	I am happy that you are moving on! <br>  <br>  I am the same way that you are when it comes to letting guys know you are interested, but I am a little older than you are..(sadly it doesn't always change as you get older). <br>  <br>  I would say there are 2 options that avoid having to tell him to his face. (I know telling him to his face is probably the best, but some of us just can't do that.) Since you are talking to him on myspace, you could send him a message saying, "Hey there is this great move out that I want to see _________, just wondering if you were up to going to see it with me this weekend. Maybe grab some dinner before hand". (Oh and try to pick out a movie he would be interested in). <br>  <br>  The other option would be to have one of your girlfriends "spill the beans", meaning have one of your girlfriends "accidentally" let it slip up to the guy you like that you have a crush on him but you are way to shy to ever let him know. Doing this puts the ball in his court and leaves the asking out up to him if he wants.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|RoyvUWl7aa	First of all, thanks for answering my question. Look, u can't be nervous!!!  You've got to have confidence chick!!! For real. That's all u need. Maybe if you get really anxious and stuff , have u thought bout seeing a psychiatrist for like anti anxiety meds? It's all about confidence and being straight  up with him, or with anyone for that matter. And stand by what you say and mean what you say. Hope it helps and good luck.   G|`|CVdpH2O6aa	wait, your a guy and you like a guy?  YOU ARE GAY!!!|`|AA11200879	let him take the first step|`|vjijiJT3aa	live on the edge, just tell him, but be prepared for anything.|`|N4xd99Qaaa	Well you basically have several options. Simplest, just tell him how you feel. You avoid a lot of other problems by being yourself and expressing yourself. Now, granted, if he just wants to be friends, the rejection will suck but the more you confront rejection the more you learn how to recover from it, thus in the future it won't be as difficult to approach people. <br>  <br>  The other option is to make him make the first move. Flirt with him. Initiate the hugs. etc. etc.<br>  <br>  The other thing you can do which I never cared for his to get one of your friends to talk to him. Have her tell him she thinks the two of you would make a good couple. If he agrees then she should tell him to ask you out.|`|HMv6jvUCaa	Use a good perfume, and make sure you hair smells nice, because when he hugs you he also smells you.<br>  <br>  It's always a turn on,  just be careful not to over do it.|`|3c51ba3982b4a0fa984f838020963690aa	Have a friend ask him if he likes YOU.  And if he does, then they tell him to make his move cuz he has a good chance at there being a yes.  If he says he's not sure, just keep things going the way they are -- maybe that'd mean he's not ready.  If he says no, then you got your answer clear.  All this without asking him on the spot, or him knowing for sure this was you trying to find out.|`|rAXkpuzIaa	Relax,ya'll r only 16. If ya'll r meant to be together. then it'll happen.|`|AA11154080	Emy all i can say is... just grab his balls he'll get the message|`|OAYaeW22aa	hug him|`|0ox8VKwKaa	I very impressed that you moved on from a bad relationship. The slower you move in a relationship the better the chance for things to work out. Give your emotions and your body a chance to catch up with your mind. Once you get past the initial attraction then the real attraction goes to work Plus if you go slow than there's a good chance you'll get to know the guy before your too involved and that way you will avoid a person like the last one. Become good friends first. Friendship is the glue that creates trust and encourages people to stay together.
AA11349881	Find someone new|`|86907ad9cce026f929aa1445843edac4aa	i shall hypnotise you and when  i count to 3 you will have forgotten all about him<br>  <br>  1 2 ...........|`|JPwv3E7jaa	even if everybody replied by saying that you should just give up, would you? It sounds like you're really in to him, so just giving up wouldn't really be an option, you can't help who you like. If I was you I would let him know how you feel, you never know he might just be covering up the fact that he likes you. Either way, you'll know for definate. If he's not interested then you can begin to move on.|`|eic9fd2Qaa	will now this sound like the same as one of my mats he liked this girl 4 ages, txted her all the time, even told her he loved him, but she pretty much lead him on, so if this is what yo think this guy is doing 2 you dont let him, id say your 2 nice of a girl for this 2 happen to you|`|TxzM2li3aa	gve up if he liked u then he wud av don sumink by now move on.|`|5rCXC0Luaa	why dont you go kill your self?|`|ix5Wmhy0aa	If he isn't interested it isn't fair on you to keep liking him, and no one else. If you really don't want anyone but him, you should try to get to know him better, as a friend first. He might realise he does like you once he knows you better.<br>  <br>  If you don't think you will ever have a chance with him, then their is really no point you waiting for him. It's only going to stop you being happy in the long run. <br>  <br>  Try joining some clubs in you local area that interest you. That way you will meet guys about the same age, that have similar interests to you.<br>  <br>  I really hope this helped.<br>  <br>  <br>  If this helped at all, could you please spare a vote for my school? <br>  The details are here:<br>  <a href="http://plugaway.weebly.com/please-vote.html" rel="nofollow">http://plugaway.weebly.com/please-vote.h...</a><br>  <br>  It'll only take a few seconds and would help me so much!<br>  Thanks x|`|EgYx7m0Yaa	Maybe he's bored of you ,you should dress up good pretty and nice that boy will surely be attracted to you . you can't just give up|`|ShwV6Ewfaa	Never give up until he is yours.

He's being extra sweeter bec he's trying to compensate for his unreadiness. He doesn't want you to get hurt. just give him time, at least he was being honest. you don't have to give him hell for honesty
UZBULUuraa	You may not be gay but you are narcissistic. It will be hard to find any woman who would marry you because of you self love.

And sometimes girls go to gay bars to get away from guys that are asshole so technically its cool cause you might still clubin with a girl|`|NXJDsVfNaa	That makes no since...wait are you a woman or a man??<br>  If you are a man, then its not a GREAT idea for you to go into a gay bar since you are straight.<br>  If you are a woman, then it is perfectly normal to go looking for hotter women in better gay bars..

And if you really get into foot massages - it's a blessing for your woman ;_)|`|zycEjQKNaa	umm...that is kinda weird but obviously she does not mind because she is letting you do it. So i say just go with the flow or do whatever. If she doesn't like you will know. She will tell you or like back up do things to avoid you doing that.|`|672Wl59Paa	Hey dude whatever floats your boat, if suckin on toes gets you and your girl going, then right on!!  Maybe you should ask her if she enjoys that.|`|kxAMOZAuaa	Doenst mean you have a fetish .. But if you did .. its the number one fetish for guys to have.

That's child molestation.|`|8U0mKXsEaa	Oh god, hell no! <br>  Geez that guy, it's illegal to date someone under 18 if you yourself is over that age. Your friend is too young and illegal to be dating someone over 18. <br>  <br>  That's wrong.|`|cpzdUGzYaa	noooo|`|sEryEzoyaa	omg noooo!!!!!!!!! that is just not safe!!!!!!!!
LKsl00CTaa	After decoding that ancient language, i'd say yes, everyone likes to feel complete with someone. So find someone for yourself and get to know 'em.

jlUczlQZaa	Unfortunately it sounds like your bff is superficial and fickle.  A true BFF would not treat you that way and leave you wondering what it is going on.|`|ugmtF6Bsaa	He was flirting|`|AA10350513	they are lesbians. and you are not. start munching clam.
OFJFLs2Paa	The thing that I would do if I was you I would act like he was someone that I can really talk to about anything. Or just know that nothing bad is going to come from talking to him. He likes you and that is a very good thing so you don't have to try and impress him no more.
7qEhTLzBaa	Well in my honest opinion, thats just wrong, and its good you realize that.<br>  You need to sit her down and have a serious talk, no joking around, be very serious. <br>  And if that doesnt work, tell her that if she doesnt stop you'll have to tell her mom, because obviously her parents need to have a sex talk with her, 13 years old thats just wrong. And if she starts to act bratly with you point out your just doing this for her own good.<br>  Hope this helps!(:|`|87d4tt6Raa	I think shes WAY to younge to be sleeping around. As you said, you where just watching disney a couple weeks ago! Im 16, and still a virgin (cause of choice), but I still wouldnt go around sleeping with guys. Someone who does this usually is insecure (even if they can put on a good front, and not seem it). And, they have no sence of who they are......<br>  She needs to go back to being 13, and wait till shes older if thats the kinda life she wants........|`|4293T0LNaa	13 yr old having sex? well, i would tell her mother lol. there is obviously no parental supervison to prevent this from happening. but i guess she'll never learn until she ends up with an std or something, ewww..|`|7MzazcQkaa	Judgments aside! Lets remember who we're talking to people. It sounds like your friend is not properly guided at home, and is hurting in some way. She is using sex as a way to feel loved i am guessing from what you said; however wrong she might be that is normally why young children turn to sex. If i were you i would think of someone who your friend trusts completely, someone you know they would take advice from and confide in. Then i would discreetly tell that person that you think your friend needs someone to talk to and is possibly going through a hard time. Don't get into specifics b/c if 13 finds our you'll only push her away (ill call her 13 as i don't know her name). Don't tell her parents as it will cause upset between the lot of you and i don't think will help matters at this point. If you are the person who your friend trusts, then i would seriously suggest going to lunch or dinner or breakfast somewhere just the 2 of you and telling her sincerely that you love her, that your worried about her explaining why in a non-judgmental manner, and that you'll be there for her if she needs you. Be honest but also be careful with how and what you say as you don't want to point the finger so to speak. Making the person feel at ease and safe is the best thing b/c it allows them to see they can confide and turn to you for help. Now i know it's alot for a young kid to do but most times that's all someone needs to deal with a situation their in; simply that a friend who will listen, love them, and be in their corner. Now some kids are very resistant to confiding so she may rebuff you and try to shut you out...that happens often. Just be her friend try not to judge and if you see her doing something very harmful and dangerous then you have to consider telling an adult as that is too much for a child to handle, if your unsure of what that would be speak to an older sibling if you have one and ask them. BUT it sounds like your friend is not at that point. While i don't think 13 should be having sex at all, she might regret her choices and make a better decision next time... In any event i hope that helped at all. If you ever need more advice you can email me i'd be glad to give advice as i had a friend who went through the same thing when i was your age so i understand how troubling and hard it is to deal with. I don't really promote a young kid to deal with these matters but it sounds like you want to be there for her so this is my best advice to you. Good luck dear and i hope and pray for the best for you and your friend. I hope she knows what a kind and caring friend she has in you those are hard to find, KUDOS to you for being such a good person.|`|bb06GQ5Paa	You need to tell your mother so your mother can talk to hers.  13?  At 13, I was still climbing trees and riding my bicycles and I hadn't so much as kissed a boy.|`|PFBKuVhBaa	ewwwwwwwwwwwwwww<br>  sorry but thats foul

The best man for you is one you are willing to compromise with, communicate with, and willing to work hard to make the relationship work, and he will want to do those things also.|`|UYRIJ7ETaa	well i think if he is boring don't go for him|`|goe3y4FPaa	NO..

You both approach life with a glass-half full philosophy. In the beginning, it may seem like there's no stopping you. Problems can start when it comes to expressing love. You choose to spell out your feelings through ideas and words, while Rams show their emotions through action. Staying together long-term will require a lot of effort, but if you and your Aries can pull it off, there really will be no stopping you.

eUiMXcFcaa	Try to look at this from your friend's perspective.  I know you think he "backstabbed" you by getting back together with a girl you like, but in his eyes you were the one asking out the girl he just ended things with and still had feelings for.  You guys are friends and some girl is not worth risking your friendship and causing drama.  Tell your friend you're going to back down and ask him to do the same, but if he really likes her be ready to accept them being together and move on.|`|1y8FYocmaa	well if your friend is really your friend he would not be saying all that mean stuff about you..i actually had a friend like that, so I confronted her and told her how  felt and she was being a b****. just go with you instinct and if you have any more q's please ask me!<br>  =]

Like one of the guy giving you the ultimatum isn't going to get what he wants by doing that. The guy that you went out with before, there must be a reason why you guys broke it off. And if you think that he is worth to give another chance then go for it. The choice is really up to you. there is no advice in the world on this yahoo answer site that can help you.

If you are feeling like the only one you can't get off your mind is the guy befor this one then it's a rebound for sure, (and that doesn't mean your a bad person or are trying to hurt anyone, things like that just happen sometimes.)|`|gfksposqaa	You have to be honest with yourself and you will know the answer.|`|hEcKmleVaa	Yes, young people tend to fall for someone new quickly and sometimes pretty hard.  It doesn't necessarily spell rebound.  I was in a five year relationship, left him, and was married within a year to a guy I am still married to 20+ years later!  I would suspect rebound if your guy still tries to keep in touch with his ex, talks about her a lot, or your relationship doesn't progress as you think it should be in terms of sharing, having fun, wanting to see each other a lot, etc.  Have a wait and see attitude, but just relax and have fun.

Love is far deeper which is why poets, authors and song writers have been using it as their theme for centuries.|`|3ee8101ef611dcb2fe20c82dfe728d6caa	I believe love can start out as lust. It may be the physical attraction that gets you interested enough to want to get to know a person to fall in love with who they are. Lust can be immediate, but love builds over time.|`|LUIB0LzMaa	if a boy or a girl has more than one relations, it is lust.<br>  and if you have only one relation with any boy or girls it is pure love. And i am in pure love|`|MDtBuOaMaa	if you like them cuz they are hot, then its lust but if you would put your life on the line on any given day just so the other person could live another, now thats love|`|5Gt3ErYNaa	People get the two confused all the time, and it happens just as frequently (if not more) with women confusing it as it does with men. Love implies that there's a deep mutual emotional connection, understanding, caring, and admiration there.<br>  <br>  Lust of course is just enjoying sex, which any two people who find each other averagely attractive can.<br>  <br>  Love should come first. Unfortunately, for so many people, they have a few drinks, have a few laughs, and they're sleeping with someone who they're not in love with. Enter emotional drama/baggage/damage and unnecessary depression.|`|OeRzlZPnaa	The difference between love and lust is purely what your attracted to. When your into a guys personality and how he acts (who he is as a person) that's love. Yet, when your mostly fixated on the physical aspects, like his looks and his touches (if there are any). That's lust and not love.|`|u1Oi6tGHaa	If after having sex, you're still interested in getting to know them and just spending time with them, then it's more than lust.  I think the best relationships have equal amounts of love and lust.  You love spending time laughing, talking and getting to know them and at the same time can't keep your hands off of each other.|`|izQn53q2aa	When it's just lust then all you'll care about is the physical.  When it's something more, like love, then well, you'll want more than the physical.  Love is when after the lust is sated you still want to be with the person.|`|3k1NM6dnaa	Lust is when you want sex and sex drives the relationship. love is when you don't really care about having sex, It is or would be nice but you enjoy just spending time with the person and talking to them. Then sex just happens later on in the relationship.|`|7Y6bAyNAaa	Lust is just skin deep, love is deeper and to love someone is to know  them, to love their personality, to see who they really are. Lust is all outward appearance
YbwDFvEaaa	It sounds to me like you're all pretty young, and not really ready for a serious relationship. It's natural to want to date different people and to experience what you can, which is why neither one of you had qualms about seeing other people when you've both professed feelings for one another.<br>  <br>  All you can really do at this point is be straight forward with her. Tell her that you know you have feelings for her and would like the chance to have a relationship with her, and ask if she wants the same thing. It's very possible that she will tell you that she can't reciprocate those desires, but at least she will know where you stand should she decide to leave behind her current relationship in the future.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|utGddhnVaa	wait your turn|`|EdDLydH7aa	Hmmmm...it doesn't sound like you are really are ready to be with her or she is ready to be with you if "someone or something" keeps getting in the way and like you said you both keep playing games, well that doesn't sound like you are serious at all...either of you...just let things go as they are and if you 2 are meant to be together you will be, but right now it doesn't sound like either of you want to be...not to sound mean, just answering from the information you left good luck|`|aQNtoCYsaa	She has recently got a Girlfriend? Then she is a lesbian and won't ever go out with you.<br>  Unless you are a girl as well?<br>  Time to move on I'd say.|`|KPhmCcmgaa	If i was you. I would move on. If she liked you that much then she would be with you, right??|`|bELskj1Gaa	Have a threesome?
3zm0jA0yaa	LOL These stupid girls are trying to impress you but what they are too young and stupid to realize is that it doesn't make them look impressed at all. It just makes them look like a slut and a drunk. My daddy once told me there is nothing uglier than a drunk loud mouth female. They think it is cute or being grown up by drinking, but not being able to handle your liquor is dumb enough~! They are just young and stupid and you should tell them so. It don't take a decent person to come off like a slut but it does take a decent person to come off cool.|`|b3zGfYMpaa	I reminsce with my girls about our wild times infront of guy from time to time. Its okay to a point as long as your leaving out some details and dont talk of ex boyfriends..than I'd say its crossing a line. I did it once and my boyfriend got upset. As long as you do it in the right fashion and it doesnt give a bad impression, talking about it in the past tense to me sounds more like: "That is how I WAS, but look at how much I've grown up now!" A girl thats doing it may just be trying to show how shes changed and how proud of it she is because shes able to talk of the past with no regret or shame and shes comfortable with it. Its just shows confidence and guys love confidence. If she does talk of it all the time though, she maybe showing thats shes not over it and shes still in party mode.|`|Ot2tJXU2aa	Immature!|`|VSWl45cKaa	It is a display of a lack of depth that is based on impressing a guy who she thinks wants to do nothing else than party. The real world doesn't work that way.|`|6UmRmaeWaa	They are trying to look cool in front of you. been there done that...man I was dumb!
eVK2zZsOaa	You just come out and tell him that you only want to remain friends. If he respects you and he respects the friendship he will understand. You won't be selfish if you break it you him. If you don't want to be with him just politely break it to him. You are probably sending him mixed signals so that is why he trying to pursue it. After you break it to him, try not to hang out with him so much. That might help him get over you.|`|e2379ca65e20818375f1f5e7d111d387aa	well tell him that u had FEELING 4 him before but like u got a man that u just want 2 be friends n i'm on the same predicament like u are but just let him know how u really feelin right now but if someone give u a great answer let me know|`|wzBwQ3oIaa	Friends help you but not themselves.
AjeNkvjlaa	i think she was probably trying to tell you that she wants a relationship to actualy happen with you guys<br>  what you should do is just tell her she looks pretty, or say a cheesy chat up line and make her laugh <br>  teasing her just shows her that you are friends and nothing more<br>  you should compliment her, and dont push her lol!

JFJF3GPWaa	There are some certain signals.<br>  <br>  1.) If you catch him looking over at you all the time<br>  2.) If he asks you who you fancy regally<br>  3.) Flirting<br>  4.) If he keeps finding excuses to touch you e.g tickle you, hug you, play with your hands<br>  5.) If he acts differently around you than he does with other people.<br>  6.) (depends on the type of boy) but is he more shy around you than other people?<br>  7.) If he remembers things you've said from previous conversations that someone else wouldn't normally remember e.g. your favourite song/band your sister/brothers name. Any small details that you've only mentioned once that someone wouldn't normally remember<br>  <br>  If the answer to these is more than 3 or 4 yes's then he probaably likes you.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps and good luck! x|`|BZAkGwPtaa	have ur friend ask him
yoS4cAszaa	I've been going out with my boyfriend for 18 months and things are a bit different. Some of the things he did/does really bothers me and no matter how much he apologizes and stuff it helps but not that much. Pay more attention to her and try not to mess up anymore lol. Dont buy her flowers after you do somthing wrong, doing it for the hell of it is much nicer. (Although she might think you did something wrong lol) I still love my boyfriend a lot but things will never be the same as when we first dated. When you get to know someone you get to see there flaws n if you still love them after all that then that shows real love i guess.|`|YAiKlPkMaa	I'm thinking you are trying to play house with someone who isn't really compatible with you. Propose marriage, see if that changes things.|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	If you have moved in together then ask her to marry you, if you love her as much as you say you do go out with her and get her the ring she wants and set the date.<br>  You will know by her acceptance or refusal how she feels about you.<br>  <br>  Good luck and please dont live with her for years and give her babies without being married to her.<br>  Can never understand this living together thing.|`|UZBULUuraa	At 14 months the newness is wearing off and reality is setting in. She could also be wondering what she's missing by being committed to you. You need to be the best boyfriend you can be and if it is not good enough for her, let her go.|`|sCCjAKllaa	Don't change your way for anyone if you're a good person. Some girls just need to be catered to too much, then when you do it, you're being too clingy. Tell her to either act consistent, or just end the relationship.|`|Ag8pE3Cyaa	Welcome to real life.<br>  <br>  Both of you sound too young to be playing house. Living together is very hard and you have to have some life experience first if you want it to work out.|`|IcH5gMICaa	Well, it has been about 14 months, so that is plausible really.  Usually relationships start heading downward after about 2 years, but earlier is not a bad sign.  It's just a sign that communication is not going strong.<br>  <br>  She is trying to tell you she needs more attention, you're doing your best to please her, and somehow the bond is being broken.  I would have her write down her feelings, read them to yourself, and then you do the same.  <br>  <br>  She's very lucky to have you and at least you care.  If things continue going this way, I would consider that she WANTS them to go this way and I would end it.|`|975415025988bc1fb1841f77aa985c36aa	Sex and gifts can not take the place of emotional attention. When you have been together for awhile sometimes the things that pleased either of you in the beginning are mere annoyances now. Any good relationship takes patience and trust. What you need to do is sit her down and talk to her about it. Good luck!|`|p7l8aKQ7aa	treat her nicely. Dont be selfish, share everything with her even ur food.|`|e4gsxv0jaa	My boyfriend is the same way... Let me tell you something.... I don't know you but you have the same problem that my love does.. I mean he has totally ****** up sooo bad its not even funny.. much girls would just move on and screw him for the things he has done in the past..but there is just so much I can take...I mean I never stop loving him.. and your love wont stop loving you thats a promise.. its just the fact that we're stronger than we were once and we are not going to let no guy put us down or control us like in the past... cry tears all the time and blame everything on us.... I think you should talk with her and ask her whats the matter... I mean my boyfriend does, and I give him my answers... I told him that I can never trust him or his words with it comes to be loyal to me beacuse i heard that before.... But i noticed he trying sooo hard to make things work... he just bought a house for us.... but its hard to let go of the past.... but like I said you should ask her whats are her feelings.
YkLAFRAxaa	i dont really know what the problem is...<br>  she might be tired of having sex???<br>  give her a break and let her tell you when she wants to have sex:)|`|T4N6a7MQaa	To get passionate, meaningful sex you leave and find someone who is interested in a sex life. She obviously isn't.|`|taxZzCABaa	First off, talk to her about it if you haven't already.<br>  <br>  Secondly, try getting some kind of answer from her about why she is trying to rush you.|`|1rn6uxIWaa	Sounds to me like she's also lost interest in you. Talk to her, and make sure she still has feelings for you, and is happy in the relationship. Communication is key!

wsxMUdYZaa	Definitely YES! Though I thought all of them do...<br>  <br>  I would love it if my boyfriend didnt watch it, but there is nothing I can do about it, as we are living in different countries, and it is natural for him to get horny, I accept it. And even if we were living close to each other... I will stay a virgin till my wedding, so I should understand it and shouldnt complain. <br>  <br>  Just it doesnt feel good. The feeling that he might compare me to women who are experienced, who perfectly know how to use their plastic bodies, who had sex with hundreds of men and wont get covered in blush when seeing a naked guy, who are masters in turning on men... When I told him about it he said he would never compare me to those girls, as it just wouldnt be fair, because he loves me and no other woman could beat me in any kind of competition. And he said those girls are disgusting - and I asked how come he still looks at them, and he said when he looks at them he is disgusting to. He is not himself, just a horny guy who needs relief.<br>  <br>  I just try not to think about it, because it upsets me a little. But I am sure when we get married I will compensate him that much he wont have energy to watch porn ;)|`|f38daa37b1a29a4f31ff1dc5d2746334aa	that`s great my man,but you don`t have to shout that out what you don`t like u don't like and i`m happy for you cause you are your own man,with  women or ladies if she is charity or any other name they have got what they like of their own,who ever has a name has his likes and dislikes so you can`t say ladies.get to know what your lady wants her dislikes and let her know yours too.You`ll flow nicely because of the respect of one another`s feeling,I don`t like it either but we belong to different school of thoughts.So one will know me that i don`t like when i`m asked.|`|z9k2TUcbaa	What's your question?<br>  <br>  My girlfriend never minded me watching porn. She knows how horny I get at times, and she accepts that. Sure some may say it's rude to see woman's privacy, but it's porn. There's an industry just for that.|`|CHlxBbkHaa	You don't need to tell her.  When you start dating a girl she'll snoop around your room.  I found porn in a few of my boyfriend's rooms.  I wasn't impressed.  They were pretty open about it.  The ones that I didn't find with porn, told me they weren't overly interested in it.|`|IWxQshDiaa	i hate guys that watch porn puts me off so bad and the fact that there not thinking of me and thinking of some1 else whist in a relationship its nasty!!!! xxx     <br>  any girl would not mind if u dont watch porn just dont come acoss to be gay! xxx|`|FVeNsugBaa	YES!

And I believe him because he actually gave me an opportunity to search his room, and I found no pornos at all.<br>  <br>  Instead, I found a whole DVD collection of Disney/G-rated movies. Apparently he was raised on family-friendly content instead of porn. And apparently, his girlfriends don't have any problem whatsoever.<br>  <br>  ...|`|y9TvRvs6aa	I think it is personal choice.

RkimYgEtaa	Write her a letter or show up at her door and tell her you need to talk. Make sure you apoligize for every little mistake you possibly remember, say " I know this may not mean a thing to you but I wanted to apoligize because I can't live with myself because of what I've done. I'm not asking for forgiveness I am just asking for you to listen." something like this, bring her flowers too and if she doesn't appreciate it then just casually leave without any fights, if she doesn't want you sorry to say then just let her be - don't keep trying and trying, it'll get annoying to her. Good luck sweetheart .<br>  <br>  If you have any questions about this or anything else, contact me at;<br>  curleynicole@ymail.com<br>  <br>  Much love.|`|Wa8x5UQlaa	This sounds like a story for Jeremy Kyle or Jerry Springer or something like that!|`|j7fzuDxgaa	she has to want to come back. you cant make her want to, maybe all this is pushing her away ie pressure? maybe you could be friends for now its always good to have a friend and it would be good for your little boy if you and her were friends to and who knows one day things could change for the better for you. best of luck
sVQ0IB0Gaa	I feel it's better to explain and apologize then to yell at him for no reason. I'm sure he will be understanding because he is still there being yelled at and soesn't know why. Everybody has drama.I don't think you will push him away, it may bring you closer.
F4kFUxd1aa	I am kind of in the same predicament. I have done a lot of research etc a little too late but atleast I can help others who are experiencing the same situatuion.  <br>  <br>  The best thing to do is to act okay with the break up. Do not contact him at all and just pretend that it does not bother you. When you are in class together, pretend that you don't even see him and just focus on school, spending time with family and friends. its works like reverse psychology. Even though he broke up with you he would be curious as to why its not bothering you and the tables will turn. Instead of you chasing him, he will be the one chasing you. Its up to you if you still want to be with him.<br>  <br>  Spending time with family and friends helps.Just take it day by day.

BBfIXcI0aa	Putting on a pair of pantyhose isn't crossdressing. Putting on lipstick and a skirt is. Since you were doing the latter and not him, I don't think you have anything to worry about. Lots of men enjoy hose in a sexual sense - they feel good, and since they aren't used to wearing them for things like work, they can sexualise the experience. There's also the little sense that they're doing something naughty when they have hose on under pants, and everyone enjoys a fun secret.<br>  <br>  Don't worry about it! It's totally normal. Just go with it - it's spicing up your sex life. If you like, reach into your kinkier corners and try something you never thought you'd be able to do before, too!|`|pDqsFgjyaa	wow, um, that sounds perfectly normal to me.... >.< not...|`|8a388a5ebde8e1afd4da3560460f83a8aa	yes he meant that he likes wearing the panty hose, not seeing you in them. im sure hes done it before. he probably wears girl clothes when hes home alone. and he will not get over it. if you cant deal with it, move on. i certainly would.|`|i5MxtGENaa	definetly talk to him about it (Y)

This is why he dumped you for this pretend relationship that doesn't really exist.<br>  <br>  Just assume nothing will develop with him.  If that means you don't want to talk to him, don't.  If you still want to, go ahead.  Either way, he's not interested, but no one here can tell you what to do.  That's all based on what you want, and only you know the answer to that.

koAaPXKQaa	I think that this isn't the kind of relationship I'd want to be staying in forever. He has to change and you have to not be thinking of another man. While you have eyes and feelings for someone else, the relationship won't be as great as it could be and you maybe subconsciously wont be wanting it to get better.<br>  <br>  In saying that, I wouldn't be putting up with the s**t that your fiance is giving you, and if he isn't willing to change, I'd get outta there.<br>  <br>  You guys really need to work hard at this, and if it doesn't get better, then maybe he's not the right man for you.<br>  <br>  I think also that you have to do your best to get over the married man... it's not fair on you, him or his wife for that matter.

KO4kkypnaa	Need space means that she is probably unsure about her feelings and being around you makes her even more confused. She probably likes you but isn't sure if she is going to get hurt again or waht is going on. She needs time by herself to sort out where SHE is without the relationship to decide her status in the relationship.<br>  <br>  Answer mine:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090223061643AAM5jAa">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|n9CLuCMlaa	Girls have a hard time "letting things go" a lot of the time. The fact that you broke up with her for another girl, probably caused her confusion and emotional pain for a while. Although you two have been back together for a little while now, she may still fear that you will ruin the relationship again. Trust is a big factor for a relationship and commitment is also. If a guy ruins either trust or commitment, it could put a dent in the relationship. <br>  The fact that you two have been back together for 6 months and NOW she says that she "needs time to herself", could just be something she is dealing with that is completely separate from what you had done a year ago. Do all you can to give her her space, while not letting her forget that you care for her. Sometimes girls think they are losing feelings for their partner, but in reality other emotions or situations are getting in the way that are telling their mind to over think everything; this includes a relationship. <br>  Truly, there are many different factors that could cause the reason your girlfriend said "she needs space". The best way to find out is to ask her. See if there is any stresses in her life, but make sure to listen to her. Even if the answer is that "you are the stress", listen and do your best to adjust to what she needs in a relationship
mejxzP8aaa	why did he move out? i think you didnt make it clear to me..<br>  but yeh if you find out why he moved out.. then you can try to figure out.. whether the reason was something that involved u. <br>  as in if he moved out coz of u.. then u mite wanna further pursue the problem... and dig to find out.<br>  <br>  if he wants his own.. time... im not.. sure how much time is he spending with u in comparison to his own time? more with himself or with u.<br>  <br>  and has alot changed since his moved out? like ur relationship.<br>  i think you can prolly figure out. if u ask urself that. <br>  <br>  hope that helps =)<br>  sows.. ur quest is so brief|`|VqVBgI8vaa	i don't think it's over doll, i think it's the fact that he's not doing a lot (workwise) he's probably feeling a little inadequate?  Without going into my experience and my story, i think that the fact that he's moved out and still wanted to maintain contact with u says that he's still in to the relationship.  Have u tried talking to him about how he's feeling about being jobless - so-to-speak???
YbwDFvEaaa	I think it's more likely that you're in love with the person he represents, which is something you have to be extremely careful with.<br>  <br>  Whether it's on purpose or not, people tend to portray only their best qualities while online. You're not actually there with the person every day, so it's easier for them to filter out all their little quirks and flaws, or sometimes some big flaws, that might change your mind about how you feel about him/her. <br>  <br>  Just be very careful with your heart in this situation. There is nothing worse than realizing you've fallen in love with someone who doesn't even exist.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|EvDmgWjvaa	Your confusing infatuation with love. Yes I have been infatuated with a female now Im older I know what I was feeling wasn't love|`|NgawN7Pcaa	i have had this too. only through texting..... when they're all flirtyy : ) lovee .<br>  <br>  i do believe so .. i never heard that you had to meet the person to fall in love .<br>  <br>  its kinda like a "love at first TYPE thing" instead of sight.|`|xMCuUvd4aa	Imagine how easy it is to love someone when you see them an hour or two every day or so.<br>  <br>  Now consider how much easier it is to love someone when you see their flowery or complementary words to you for a few hours online every day.<br>  <br>  Talk is cheap and the true measure of a person is difficult to uncover through online interaction.<br>  <br>  You naturally fill in the gaps of what you know with positive assumptions.<br>   <br>  So, my point is that yes it is possible to believe someone you never met other than online is your soul-mate, but there is so much that you do not know about him that it is quite likely that you are in love with an idealized version of him, and he will not in reality be the "soul-mate" you have created in your mind. Another negative is that sometimes people are nicer or outright lie about themselves online, for instance, when talking to beautiful girls. It makes taking the measure of a person's soul that much harder.<br>  <br>  Be careful. Meeting otherwise unknown netizens, can be risky. Take precautions, and good luck.|`|FzFSzilmaa	can do... cos you are connecting with personalities not with looks... and that is more intense... :D|`|QGuxbItCaa	Once you grow up and experience real love....you will realize this is just puppy love.|`|vjijiJT3aa	on the internet a person can tell you what ever you want to hear, show you pictures that aren't them, and be completely the opposite of who you thought they were. It's never a good idea to meet someone on the internet, and for all you know it's a grown old man or a pervert, please be smart and know what your getting into, keep it strictly conversation no personal information about yourself and no nude pictures. Be careful.|`|9NfLuHo9aa	yea i met this girl who lived in the US when i was in a different country, we e-mailed then she came back home (to the foreign country) and it was just as it was online. She was everything, really dont believe its puppy love..its more than that. That connection was there, couldnt wait to see her when she came from the airport. It was just perfect. What happened? My butt had to move to the US while she is back home permanently. Lol i know it blows but that's how it was but the point is that, if i had not moved. It would have worked perfectly cause she came back four months before i moved to NY and that was the best for months ever. Really was worth all the countless e-mails, don't believe anything different. If its meant to be it will, and mine was also..meant for four months but four magical months at that, and i still love her.|`|Bn5JoVlLaa	NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO its all in ur head.. u have made him out to b this amazing 'soul mate' yea u get on wel in e mails but that does NOT mean u love them.. love has to b physical, emotional, its about companionship (real compansionship not from reading an e amil)  its about understanding each other and helping one another along in everyday life... <br>  sorry to say it but i think ur been silly n not been realistic...|`|uFmrZbCbaa	The possibility is there but it is kinda unlikely.

Be careful and I wish you the best of luck.|`|DooJ5iDGaa	IT CAN happen , I would say technology has open new possibilities when it comes to relations. I say its more of an infatuation or a substitute for loneliness and having someone to talk to and make you feel special but you never know|`|Ejw9Yf0jaa	infatuations maybe|`|kgIccwR0aa	yap...normal just be thankful for the opportunity|`|w6dXWoPzaa	yessssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss...|`|X2VurcLeaa	It is possible to fall in love with the idea that this person is perfect through what he is writing. People are able to censor themselves much more through writing and texting and email, even over the phone, then they are in person. <br>  Basically, what I mean is that he may not be all that great in person. Then again, he might. So even though you might "love" how he "talks" to you and feel that he is the one, you could be way ahead of yourself.<br>  How old are you? If you have dated much, surely you know it is best to take things slow. Even if you still feel in love, maybe you should wait this out. I'm sure he has his faults and you are bound to see them sooner or later. There is no perfect relationship.|`|A18ZgovSaa	well it is up to you,,,but i think it will be much better if you will met each other.dont be so sure that he/she is your soulmate.theres a lot of unseen emotions on communacating with the internet.and yet you didnt see each other right.dont expect too much ,there is nothing much better than spending time personally although in a short time,than just telling some likes and dislikes on net..think of it.it would be much better for you if you will meet each other.especially your a girl...right?|`|MfSarGzwaa	i like someone like that and i still do like him but i meet up with him and hanged out and fell in love with him but he never liked me tell him u like him|`|Ron6f6nAaa	well i have met people online, but im sure its impossible to know if you love them or not when you have never even met them-people can be completely different in person than they are online-be careful
MW1yrHbOaa	guys are stupid, if he showed up to your house and didn't see another man there, then he knows that you are telling the truth and he showed up unannounced so it's not like you would have even had time to tell someone else to leave.  If he is just your baby daddy, he shouldn't care any way.|`|Px990WYDaa	if you feel like you have to prove it to him, just wait till your phone bill comes in and see if it shows the times the phone was answered, even if it was like 5 secs it should record it as a minute.|`|l557TQFoaa	TRUST. a relationship is base on trust. he must try to understand that your phone service is not reliable, I advise you to change to verizon to save your relationship. If you to are together chances are, he'll always bring this up.
NgawN7Pcaa	make her jealous. she sounds like one hell of a confused person. go find one of her friends, flirt with them.
z2T6att7aa	He was probably in a foul mood when you asked him, but that is no reason for him to be like that. You should probably go and talk to him, because you don't want tension around you when you work - it'll "bog" you down, I would suggest talking to him and explaining that he really annoyed you, and that you only asked him a question, and that the fact that it was a bad time really shouldnt have made him act like a jerk.

Lsst29Btaa	I know all you think about is death, but I promise you things will get better, in fact, hurting someone or yourself physically will be worse & you definitely shouldn't do that...you may not believe me but I'm serious.  Yes it sucks, and I've been in a similar situation where I was really upset, but a) you could get in a **** ton of trouble. b) if you harm anyone you truly will never get the girl of your dreams back... & c) people care about you, you may not see it or realize it, but hurting yourself is selfish too, and you would hurt people around you that don't deserve to be hurt.  Things will get better, I remember a time when I thought things never would get better too, and I too have depression issues...but they do get better, they really do...take it one day at a time and doing people harm will only make things worse, maybe talk to a doc about getting on anti-depressants--they can help too, its okay to look to others for help--it doesn't show weakness, it shows that your smart enough to know when something isn't quite right...it'll get better, just give it a little time!!

I'm still with him but I still don't have the complete trust that I used to. I find myself wanting to go through his messages to see if he is lying to me again. But I love him and would not leave him for a lie. So really, its whether or not you can live with his lie. But it takes time to rebuild the trust.

It might fill a gap and help you move on from someone in the past, but that's about it.|`|TrEYixLXaa	Where there is a will, there is a way.  Long distance, or no distance, it really doesn't matter.  All that should matter is how you both feel about eachother, and if you feel strongly enough for one another then their is no reason why it wouldn't work.|`|cZ2WDB34aa	Finish college.Get a degree.

I can give you 3 reasons it won't work. <br>  <br>  1. you are still getting over a long term relationship. 2 months may seem like a long time, but it's not long enough to get over a relationship like that. <br>  <br>  2. If you live in 2 different states. who's going to take the time and money to travel to see the other? is he willing to do that and for how long? what about you? now if you live in the same state or your states are not that far apart. it might not be that big a deal. <br>  <br>  3. you said you were worried about the long distance. if you are worried at all, it's because that's your hearts way of telling you (you're not ready yet). you mind came up with the reason of the distance factor. but it's really your heart saying wait. <br>  <br>  give yourself some time. don't rush into anything that might hurt you, him or both of you. if he really wants to be with you, he will wait. if not, then you know you were wasting your time.|`|LAxNiEigaa	to be honest babe i dont think it would work out.<br>  the long distance aspect is part of it..but the other is age.<br>  now normally age doesnt mean anything but he is an 18year old boy who just got out of high school...still has to enjoy his "university parties" and all that stuff. he may like you a lot now, but he may get caught up between two worlds, yours and his. yours wants him to be seroius and hopefully marriage type at some point later on. for him its just to live his life before he gets serious to settle down. i may be wrong, he may actually really like you and what not. but  boys MENTALLY are behind girls so he may have doubts about it at one point or another.<br>  <br>  and back to the first point, distance might discourage you both|`|dfhBAv0Zaa	your cant be in a relationship with someone you never see and especially someone you've never met!|`|rAXkpuzIaa	If u want to go out with him, then do it,but take it slow.|`|8KbQDRPpaa	try to visit kansas and talk to him and see each other..... talk about your future relationship and see if its gonna work out!!!<br>  <br>  ""GOOD LUCK""|`|2pNT0eAAaa	if you guys are for real serious, then no, you aren't rushing.|`|SxcN4lcMaa	i think that if you like him go for it because he mite be the one
ActoZyHraa	Well just because one guy treats you horribly doesn`t mean the next one will, you have to be confident with yourself & someways to do that is first off start by trying to feel like a happier person, start working out, change your style up maybe , once you feel like  your on top of the world, you can start searching for someone who you think will treat you right, def don`t go look for love in a club tho , you can find someone trustworthy almost anywhere ^_^ good luck & think positively it helps ALOT|`|7fh3JCVxaa	you know that your last bf was horrible, so its not your fault and its nothing to do with you, it was him that was messed up.<br>  so just go for it and keep talking, and think, why should i mess this up because my ex was such a jerk?<br>  you'll find it easier with time but just trust him, he clearly likes you or he wouldnt be with you.x|`|fS5UkvkGaa	How old are you?<br>  <br>  Try getting him on his own. When you are fresh into a relationship it is somtimes hard to talk to them especially when they have friends around them. Either you can call him or just ask to have a word.<br>  <br>  If you wanted you can try to build up your relationship slowly or just pretend you are someone else for a few days. Be flirty. It will get him interested and then you will find it easier to talk to him. Find a common intrest or something to make fun of. It never fails (for me anyway!)|`|isg9i7Z4aa	really these guys are sick really sick...never meant to be trusted,...very few infact very rare pieces can be trusted...for time being when u hate lads...be away from them tats better,,,and confidence eh??do something like dance or perform somewer,where u get lots of compliments and r kindof an imp person...ur confidence will be raised...dont worry|`|nf93PWvbaa	get cosmetic surgery, confidence comes from the physical

75NcG1OQaa	It's clear he wants to be with every day and only him. So yes he obsessed. The thing is you have to let him know that you need time to hanging out with your girls friends and why. If he still doesn't let you then ask why and then tell him that he can't control your life. You can hang out with anyone you want but make time for him and if he calls/texts all the time don't answer he has to learn that you need time to yourself. If this doesn't work you might need to tell to cut it out or it's over. Which is one thing both of you don't want to do. So try this and I hope it works out.|`|ODf41iN4aa	Yeah, he's a bit too much.  You should have some down time away from anybody.  <br>  <br>  I was seeing a guy for awhile who wanted to spend every minute of every wkend together.  After all, according to him, we could do laundry together, sit & read side-by-side, etc.  In theory, that sounds reasonable & even great, but I just wasn't used to that much togetherness & couldn't take it.  It was kind of too bad because we both liked sci fi & cards & board games.  He was pretty cute, & at first I thought I was in luv until he started getting on my nerves.  He was just insecure.  I had tried to spend part of each wkend alone or just made myself unavailable sometimes, but it just wasn't working.  He started to seem very self-centered, too.  When he won at a game, he said, "The hero wins again," which drove me nuts.  When I broke it off, he wept big crocodile tears.  I don't mind guys crying, but it was just a bit too much...the key being the self-centered part.<br>  <br>  So, I guess it's just wait & see how obsessed your guy is & whether he's self-centered as well.  <br>  <br>  Dr. Phil said once on Oprah that it's not always that important to have everything in common.  For instance, with a married couple, it's fine for one person to go off on Saturday to go fishing or golfing while the other person does something else.  It's perfectly healthy.  I'm not that fond of Dr. Phil, but in this case, he made a lot of sense.  As usual, it's all about balance.|`|EZwQC0ZXaa	yes hes obsessed and controlling...tell him you love him but be reasonable limit ur texts and calls...tell him to try waiting like an hour before he sends a follow up call/text...but he may not want to change so don't get your hopes up too high
CCpUkt4Raa	well it sounds to me that everything that you need to look out for you already found. she seems to be deeply involved in your answers and your reactions to her questions. she wants to know more about you. she points her legs towards you because she's focusing all her attention to you. its good that you 2 stayed friends for so long. being friends is the best start you can ever do in getting a relationship going, but if you really feel for her and you can since that she feels for you as well then keep an OPEN mind. talk to her about relationships, go out every now and then and slowly build your way from there. if you do that already then you're already half ways there my friend ;)... some things in life take a good push and something this close you should really take advantage of... lol well i mean as for boyfriend girlfriend status.|`|JciRlsWEaa	The best relationships are when you are best friends with you boy/girlfriend.  If you guys are both into each other and share a sense of humor than that's great.

Girls are taught not to make the first move and things like that. So you're going to have to make the first move. Ask her on a real date, or just try to kiss her. See how she responds. That's the only way you can tell. There are some signs of flirting but people are different so sometimes apparent flirting is just friendliness. You just have to tell her or show her how you feel. If she doesn't feel the same way, you can try to take it back and see if you can still be friends, but you have to take a risk.|`|a7VkyZLfaa	Ask  her if she has a boy friend and then if she says no, you can ask her a nother question which is what is your dream man describe him and then ask her that if she enjoy your company . I am sure while asking her these question she will know that you like her and if she interested you can tell from her eyes or maybe she will  tell you something. Then if she ask you why you are asking such questions tell her that you really like her and she is special and uniqe and not like any other girl that you met. If she says she is not interested in a nice way or any other way just tell her that you want to have her as a friend and you dont want to loose her , this is will maybe let her change her mind and love you .Good luck|`|hjbZ6CkLaa	im also a 17 yr old boy. so i no how ur feeling. <br>  <br>  it sounds like you two are perfect together. u should ask her to the cinama or something like that and go for the 'hold hands thing' to start off with. if she doesnt move her hand then im sure u 2 will defo get together but if she pulls away just tell her u didnt no her hand was there and just forget about it and be good friends<br>  <br>  in my experiance girls who become 'good friends' with me usualy end up being my gf <br>  <br>  hope i helped<br>  <br>  good luck mate|`|HMv6jvUCaa	Just ask her, before someone else does.|`|EjyD1sXeaa	she sounds very attracted to you. do the photgraphy and take it from there.

If you develop a boyfriend/girlfriend relationship now it will burn out sometime when you are college age.  But if you stay close friends and "it's meant to be" you will grow closer over the years.  Which do you want?  A high school sweetheart or a lifetime companion.|`|jiGE97cNaa	lemme think, keep these questions to yourself.|`|15jfF0tKaa	Dear snowman, the relationship sounds like a good one to me. I wouldn't rush her, she is interested in learning about photography and I assume she is being straight forward about that. If you want to date her ask her, if not assume she likes you as a friend. Be honest here. She will get mad if you assume its a dating thing when she wants a learning experience leading to $.  Honesty is the way.  I'd say I am wanting to ask you out?  I am also interested in working with you so I will let you decide.
OFJFLs2Paa	Well what are you talking about it was hard on your relationship? Whatever was hard on that relationship I would try and change and show her that it has changed. Then maybe after seeing all of that then she will give you guys another chance. Good Luck and I really hope that you get her back! =D
WpCwTxN5aa	I understand where you're coming from, but what you should understand is than an hj is nothing as compared to a bj, but bj's are pretty much as good as regular p-v sex.  In fact,  many guys prefer receiving oral to p-v sex, and if you're giving him bj's, then he really has nothing to complain about.<br>  <br>  However, guys are prone to push the envelope to whatever is forbidden, and if he does push for p-v sex, then you just have to lay down the law.  If he can't be happy even though he's getting bj's regularly, tell him he'll have to find somebody else.|`|38432188076da24bd2e484fa5d428e24aa	go 4 it try something new its not like u will get into sex that fast. idk?! try it and see how it feels i think it is nasty also but i tried once i am catholic as well as u r.|`|4HoVVCenaa	If you want to say no, then say no.

Now what he has to understand is the due to the that you don't believe until sex after marriage he has to understand that is an absolute limit. You have to set these limits for yourself and he needs to respect them if he doesn't then kick his *** to the curb.|`|jard50Yiaa	I agree with the poster directly above me...|`|AA11440601	If you do not feel right about it then do not do it. Your boyfriend is treating you as a sex object and not as a person he loves. You deserve better.<br>  <br>  God is concerned with how we treat each other. <br>  <br>  We have been instructed to love <br>  + Our neighbor as we love ourselves<br>  + One another as Jesus loved us<br>  <br>  When we treat each other like sex objects, when sex is taking instead of giving, we damage the human dignity of both our partner and ourselves.<br>  <br>  True giving of yourself to another in a sacramental marriage is what love is all about. <br>  <br>  Marriage is a symbol of God's creation of the world in an act of divine love and self-outpouring.<br>  <br>  Marriage is a symbol of the love, commitment, intensity, and passion of Christ for the Church for which He laid down His life.<br>  <br>  Christians take sex very seriously because it is a glorious gift from God that lets us feel just a bit like God. We become lovers, givers, and creators.<br>  <br>  With love in Christ.|`|eP3kCEQxaa	NO  i think that is desrespectful. yall have only been going out for about two months and if u feel uncomfortable doin it then u shouldnt have to. and if he really liked u for who u r them he will  understand but if he gets mad then u kno the tru side of him and hes not worthit|`|edpKlRnhaa	I understand if you don't want to don't I didn't want to but I did it to my bf.

Even if you wait until marriage, don't get hung-up on what's gross or not gross. It can cause a lot of personal issues later in life|`|nn68oyzdaa	first of all, you're still a minor, and if he's trying to force you into something that you don't want to do, don't do it! some stuff can be seen as rape. be careful! if you don't believe in sex before marriage, then please, please, please wait. i feel the same way. people shouldn't have sex until after they are married. that's what it says in the Bible. if you don't want to do it, then don't. explain to him your views. if he understands, then that's great. if not, get away from him as soon as you can because it will only start a downhill progression that could lead into abuse. i hope this helps, and i wish you the best of luck!|`|zFx7NT2Baa	This guy has some sympathy for your views and experience because he has known girls/women who have felt the same way about both the hj and the bj.  What I can tell you is more than one has come around to the belief that a bj is even better for her than going all the way with sex in the marriage sense of sex.  Better for her?  Yes, it seems, if the guy is (and I try to) sensitive to her needs and she wants to provide pleasure and he (me) wants her to have the pleasures of intimacy with a man's (whatever you wan to call it), and for her to feel in control of what she is doing, part of which is to be in control of both her feelings and his, then she wants him where she can do the bj to her speed and desires.   May I suggest you have a warm towel or a towel you can warm afterward, for either a hj or a bj.  You offering to wipe away any fluids is a touching and bonding thing.  If you go to the bj, I suggest you ask him to gently guide your head by his hands lightly on your hair or cheeks.  Go slowly and do enjoy the experience.|`|ZvTbDyxUaa	2 months?<br>  <br>  That's short for anything...
c5UAa65qaa	Your reasons for disliking drinking are all centered around how it makes you feel: you feel out of control, you don't feel happy when you do it, etc.  There's nothing wrong with that; I don't drink a lot myself for similar reasons.  But what you have to recognize is that everyone reacts to alcohol differently.  Maybe your boyfriend is the kind of person who has to drink a lot before he starts feeling out of control, and as long as he doesn't, it just gives him a pleasant buzz.<br>  <br>  If this is a really important issue to you, or if you find out he hasn't been honest about other aspects of his personality, then it may not be wise to try and force yourself to get over it.  But as long as he's honest about his actions from now on and not doing it to the point that it's obviously harmful to him (and of age), I think you may just want to accept that this is one area where you disagree.

You'd have preferred he spoke to you in person or over the phone, all relationships start out really awkward and if that's really what he wants and he's not just being nervous, you're ok with it.

YbwDFvEaaa	Whenever I see the question "Should I wait...?" my knee-jerk reaction is to say "No."<br>  <br>  This case is no different.<br>  <br>  If he didn't want to be with his girlfriend, he wouldn't be. No amount of begging a person does will get someone to go back into a relationship they don't want once it's over. This on-and-off romance with his girlfriend is not likely to end soon, no matter what he has been telling you. I'm sure he knows very well that you have feelings for him, and he's trying to see how much he can get out of you without entering a relationship with you by offering you these empty promises of leaving his current girlfriend.<br>  <br>  Furthermore, you should never wait for someone who is already in a relationship. Someone who is in a relationship with someone else shouldn't even be considered an option for romance. Do yourself a favor and move on. Even if this guy were to end up single any time soon, there's no telling that he won't put you through the same yo-yo romance as this other poor girl...And chat up another girl while he's with you, as he's clearly doing to his girlfriend now.<br>  <br>  Get yourself out of a bad situation before you even get into it... Move on, and find someone who is available to get to know you without having prior commitment.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|xBMwbR5Qaa	Well,this might sound brutal but...If he'd be really into you...then...why does he keep getting back with his ex again and again?<br>  (Sorry for my english...I hope this helps though:) )

6sns33traa	Should how many men she's slept with matter to you?  Not unless you want her judging you by how many women you've slept with.<br>  <br>  Advice?  Yeah, be sure you are both on the same page before you get to far into this relationship.  If she enjoys a sexually open relationship than you are going to have to accept that and not expect her to change for you.  And she shouldn't force herself to change to make you happy if you don't want to swing.<br>  <br>  One of the biggest reasons for trouble in marriages is the idea of "Well, that's okay if they do that now, but when we get married that will all change."  Whether it's a guy selling his motorcycle or something as big as this, if they change they will resent you. Love should be unconditional: You love them for who they are or you don't really love them.<br>  <br>  So you two need to do some serious talking about what it is you want from the relationship and the future before you go much further, because if it's not the same than it would be better to find someone who's ideas of love and sex more closely resemble your own rather than make each other miserable trying to compromise yourselves.|`|nmiXLhwCaa	Are you comfortable with her having been with so many guys and liking to swing?

You have to ask your self can you handle her being with someone else if she still has urges to be with others. I'm just trying to look at it realistcally so you dont get your self involved something you might regret. But again I dont know her personally just an outside point of view. Best of luck
oPfuSTfUaa	if you know that he'll come back then let him go. he'll realize how much you mean to him. But seriously, if hes cheating on you..why would you seriously want him to come back? if he truely loves you then he'd want to give up his other.."friends".  if he doesnt, then hes just a waist of your time. i know you love him..i understand believe me i do, but if he doesnt love you..then its going to always be an empty relationship.  but most deffinately listen to your heart :)|`|7be3f4155dcd42f2a8721e0033593ea7aa	If he wants out, just let him go.<br>  Yeah, at 37 one would think he's grown up enough to know what he wants.

Might as well look at it.  The reason they are on good terms is because she doesn't know he cheated on her.  He wears his ring, sweetheart, because he wants people to think he is still married, because he hasn't come out to everyone about wanting a divorce.  Or, they are working on their relationship, which is why things are going well for them.  You may get the call that he can't do this to his wife.  Don't date married men!  Its wrong, you know its wrong, you will get hurt as a result.

HrDcaocMaa	If you want to have an extremeley serious relationship with him that means you will have to be accepting of his Karate Hobby... But that doesn't mean that you can't be a part of "His World" either...  You can support him by going to lessons with him or to his competitions etc... Maybe even show him that you'd like for him to teach you some moves, self-defense etc...  The more you make available of yourself and the more giving that you are - the more that he will fall in love with you and want to have that serious relationship.  But the key here is to be 100% certain that you are true to YOURSELF - if you think that you can't do these things without totally dreading it and it becomes more burdensome for you than it's time to move on....  Also, the reason why I say this is because he made it quite clear to you that Karate is a Major influence on his life right now - maybe more so than a potential girlfriend - so that's why if you show to him that you really have an interest in what he does than the greater the chances that he will want you for a girlfriend...
R1gqthbmaa	First of all, he has to give you certain signs of liking you. If you get some of these signs, then go on and don't ask him straightaway, take it easy, with your time, approach him with a gentle way and then, if you really get these signs, ask him.<br>  I think that's all you can do!

This retard kept touching my ***, even though I shot him evil looks and stared at him and then my boyfriend at the time spoke to him - the 3rd time my boyfreind got him by the neck and pushed him against the wall - the guy looked like he was about to crap himself and stopped.<br>  4. as above - when ur drinking in town, its less dangerous to just remove urself from the situation than to confront,<br>  5.no i dont feel bad for him at all - he has no respct for peoples bodies, now ke knows what it feels like. Hell NEVER do that again,and given his attitude before and how hugely disrespectful it was (not just a little touch but actually a grab, and UNDER her skirt too) he could have become a rapist or something.<br>  6. id feel a little shocked but ultimately pround<br>  7. Ashamed of course, if it was my own son I probably would feel protective but who wouldnt? dissapointed too, that he could be such an *ss and that he had to ultimately get just desserts for it..|`|517360c1a1db979fb2f19bbb959f22eaaa	Of course it's his own fault and she had a right to defend herself. On the other hand, I don't know what country you're in, but in the US, there are laws that are supposed to protect kids from sexual harassment from teachers and from each other. She should have reported the incident and the school is legally required to report the incident to the proper authorities and to discipline the kids. <br>  <br>  But if she felt the boy threatened her with rape or other form of violence, she was within her rights to hit back. The problem is always to figure out what amount of force is justified in any situation. Self-defense means using just enough force to stop the attack and not going beyond that point. For example, if knock someone down to stop the attack and they stay down, you don't keep kicking them or if someone hits you in the arm, you don't break his leg. When you cross that line, then you stop being the victim and you become the aggressor. You're wrong and can even go to jail. <br>  <br>  The problem in this situation is that she overdid the force, sending the guy to the hospital. She could have swatted his hand away or slapped him and then reported him. But in the heat of the moment, even though she kicked him, she didn't have to take him out.|`|df089a1d7acdbf674fc91dddc4748277aa	If the event happened as you say it would be my opinion the B*****d got he deserved, I would ask what kind of up bringing his he getting, how can a 14 year old act this way as he no mother or sisters, however if their was more to this I would need the whole situation explaining, for now I will say give your sister the benefit of the doubt and applaud her actions, his action were well out of order and people who play these games get what they deserve, the school are sending out a dangerous message if you a week kick a bag of nuts.|`|kqa9VFrfaa	Yes, she did have the right to defend herself, however she should have used her KNEE instead. <br>  The reason the school is punishing them both is because the schools are trying  hard to promote non-violence in both directions.

I'm sure she didn't mean to make it so he'd have to get one of his testicles removed and never be able to have any children, but she doesn't even feel sorry about it.  So ya if this was real you and your sister are both horrible petty people. <br>  <br>  1. No I don't. <br>  2. Yes, a good kick in the balls is something a 14 year old boy needs sometimes but she ruptured his damn testicles and now he can't ever have kids. <br>  3. If i was a girl, I would have broken his nose.  <br>  4. I've never grabbed a random girls ***.  <br>  5. It's definitely not what he deserved. He deserved some sore balls, or a slap in the face, or even a broken nose to teach him a lesson. he definitely didn't deserve to never be able to have kids. She permanently mutilated him. I know if a girl grabbed my *** or did something like that and I responded just as violently as your sister did I'd find myself in Juve. <br>  6. I'd be proud of her in defending herself but incredibly upset that she damaged him that much. I'd tell her she was right in defending herself, but punish her for mutilating another human being. <br>  7. I would be disappointed that he disrespected your sister like that but I would be incredibly angry at the girl, and her parents, and the school. I might even sue your parents. They'd definitely deserve it for raising your sister so horribly. She wasn't wrong in defending herself and she didn't mean to do any damage, but she doesn't feel any remorse for what she did. For making sure a guy won't ever be able to have children because of something so stupid and pointless. What kind of person does that make your sister? And what kind of person does that make you and your and your parents for being approving of her actions?|`|82cb8f9319b4af25b84a0e62e4814ffbaa	WOW!!! This is the 9th time that you have asked this question.<br>  <br>  I think your sister went a little over board. Yes, the boy should have been punished but NOT like this...gee...and NO your sister should not have been suspended.<br>  <br>  I'm sure the kid will never do this again and he probably will never have his own children due to your sisters over reacting.|`|AA10628838	No she didn't do the right thing. And it sounds like the 14 year old was seriously hurt. All she had to do was tell a teacher, and all the witnesses could have backed her up. Now she is in trouble because she decided to play judge and jury and met out the punishment herself.|`|AE9aauACaa	I think she went a bit over the top with kicking and shouting.<br>  Ive had it done a few times i punched him in the stomach and told my parents what had happend and they said he deserved it. I wouldnt be happy if it was my daughter if it was my son i wouldnt be with the fact that he had to have surgery but dissappointed because of what he did.|`|d2d25b8ca8cc3c343da79b0e9e90dd00aa	I will answer your questions as honestly as I can.<br>  <br>  1. I agree that your sister did that for self defence and I am sure the boy learned his lesson. But I think a better thing to do would have been to gather up the witnesses and get him suspended alone, or if she really has a temper (which I am guessing she does) she could have just slapped him. <br>  2. Yes, I think she hurt him a little more than expected bearing in mind he had to have surgery and his ability to reproduce in the future has been severely handicapped. If there were no consequences, I would have just assumed to enflicted pain on him - not given him permenant punishment.<br>  3. Like I said, I would have reported him to someone of higher authority to deal with it.<br>  4. Yes, a guy groped me and grabbed my bum and I reported him; he was suspended from school for 2 weeks and apologised to me. <br>  5. I think he deserved to get punished for being a perv and behaving like that, but not to that extent.<br>  6. If it was my daughter, I would feel very bad, but still I stand my ground when I say someone of higher authority should deal with it. <br>  7. If it was my son who had lost his testicle like that, I would be very furious. Guys at that age have their hormones flying all over the place so behaving like that is normal - not accepted - but expected. A slap in the face and a call to the headteachers office would have put him in place.|`|pWz8d8MBaa	1. yes and no she went overboard he can never make a baby with his future wife now, think about it she affected him alot he was just being a usual perv teenager! to get surgery! i would serioulsly want to die if i was him think about it he will be teased and a seriouse future girlfriend is going to be hard to find.<br>  2. yes if she  didnt make permanat damage than that wouldof been the perfect thing to do.<br>  3. i would of immedidaltly told someone that way his punishment would be in full i i wouldnt get in trouble and then maybe like egg his house or something like that.<br>  4.a guy grabbed my a$s once i just told him to f. of and then i got him in trouble and he had 1 day of in school suspension.<br>  5. i feel very bad for the guy he got way over his punishment! seriously kids do this thing all the time it does not deserve to have ur balls ruined forever!!! the school could of giving the perfect punishment.<br>  6. if my daughter was in this position i would feel bad for her because im guessing she would feel horrible about it and if she doesnt im sorry but thats just messed up! but i would have to punish her by telling her she went extreme and to get some money to help with the familys surgery expensises.<br>  7. if my son was in this situation i would sue the girl who did this! sorry but im sure anyone would! i would make sure that he undestood not to do this again and in court expain that.<br>  <br>  how could u agree that this is a direct result of his action!! ya a nice fall done crying thing would been and a typical bruise but surgery and a life long problem!  i thinkk u need to look at  urself in his position and think aboutwhat u would think.<br>  if ur sister didnt mean for this to happen that bad then i think this matter should come to an end but she doesnt and that kinda weird..<br>  <br>  ok im sorry for being harsh and evrthing but reconsider what he didi to ur sis. and what ur sis did to him.<br>  <br>  ur a very nice brother to be thinking about this!!!! and u should help her out with future problems this may cause, sorry to say but im pretty sure she will definitly be getin alot of crap about this at school.|`|1cfa3610b6d1b6140a73170b42273c55aa	Although right to retaliate your sister was rather "over the top". The boy was wrong and would have been sufficiently punished (I hope) by the relevant authorities, now however he will suffer for that for the rest of his life and your sister will not. Over reaction without constraint will always lead to grief. We must all Always remember that we are all ultimately responsible for our actions and that sometimes the consequence will last for years.|`|2U4U22cxaa	I agree with what she did although the guy will have people behind him because he was injured. The is classic example of  Don't do the crime if you can't do the time. He paid for what he did now he is playing the victim. I think stuff like this is a major reason our society is falling apart because people don't pay for their actions and never learn their lesson. If more people paid the price for the bad stuff they did our society would be a lot better for it.|`|CrKox2niaa	If the boy grabbed her, she had the right to defend herself, however, she over reacted and has now caused permanent damage. Boys are boys and have always done these sorts of things especially to girls who looked different as compared to everybody else around them. Why did she not just report him to the principal or a teacher? True enough, the boy should not have touched her but your sister is wrong for kicking any boy like this. If it were my daughter being grabbed, I would expect her to do the right thing, not cause a young man to not be able to father his own children some day. If it were my son, I would be angry that he had touched a young girl that way. I would also be looking for an attorney to file charges against your sister for the emotional and physical harm she has caused this young man. He will no longer be able to become a father, his parents will also never have grandchildren from him.|`|UWisVSYYaa	...Since I have strong feminent side , although being a male - I will allow myself to answer:<br>  <br>  1. Do you think she did the right thing? - 100% Right !<br>  2. Would your answer to question 1 be different if the boy did not suffer permanent damage? - Same as #1<br>  3. What would you have done? - If there was not witnesses - to finish him.<br>  4. Have you been in a similar situation? What did you do? - Nah - I'm a boy.<br>  5.

0LvWiESWaa	You are smart to be gun shy. Although the dating has to start somewhere after a divorce chances are, the first relationship is a rebound relationship. As I see it, it's even clearer here because he isn't even waiting to be divorced before he starts a new relationship and even wants you to meet the kids. He's trying to start a new relationship where the old one left of, in a way. A sure sign things won't pan out. When he does get his bearings, he will want to play the field some.<br>  <br>  What goes on between him and his wife at this point, should not be your concern.

It never bothered me because my stepmom was super nice. It may take the kids a little longer to come around, but they will learn to accept you. If you want to stay in this relationship you are going to eventually have to communicate with the ex. My mom and stepmom always agreed that I would never be in the middle of a divorce situation and my parents talked about child support, etc. when i wasnt around. When the divorce is final the only thing they will have to talk about are the kids so it will get better. Hang in there if you really like him!|`|aDhZIhQcaa	Girl, I am worried for you.  Go back and read what you wrote with an open, objective mind.  What does it tell you about him?  For one, it tells me that is a very controlling man and once you are with him, he will be controlling every aspect of your life.  You are getting involved with someone who will be a waste of your life and time.  I know love is blind and right now, you are so complimented that this "older man" has taken an aggressive interest in you that you can't see what he is really doing or what is real motive is.  I can and it scares me.  The writing is on the wall with this one and it doesn't look good.  Plus, he hasn't even taken the time to obtain closure from the failure of his marriage.  He is jumping from one right into the next relationship.  And that never works out.  You are going to get hurt, girl.  On top of that, he is using his children to sucker you in.  I have been where you are and it took me 6 years to get out of it.  I was emotionally, spiritually, and verbally abused by the same kind of man.  He suckered me in the same way this guy is doing to you.  I will be praying for you and good luck

1235333b4f34f1147fc81bf4aef8885baa	I think that good foster parents are heros!<br>  <br>  However, speaking as a social worker, I do think that you need to do a lot of research on what it's like to have foster kids in your home.<br>  <br>  Kids who are in foster care have a lot of "issues" just by definition.  Whether they've lost a parent or had to be removed from their care because of abuse, there is a lot to deal with.<br>  <br>  It's a delicate balance when you're trying to be a stable, yet temporary, person in a child's life.  It's difficult not only for you but also for your marriage and your biological children.<br>  <br>  However, for families that can pull it off, it's extremely rewarding.  It's truly doing God's work!<br>  <br>  Good luck in all you do!|`|x7vB4P5Naa	I think fostering is great!!!  The only downside is that you could foster a child for however long, get attached to and love the child, but then the biological mom comes around and wants the child back.  That happened to a family friend of mine....she fostered a child and was in the process of adopting the girl.  The real mom wanted visiting rights and the stupid judge gave the mom visiting rights!!  But she was in jail at the time, so my friend had to bring the girl to the jail to visit her mother, even though it was obvious the girl didn't want to go ( she would cry ).  Eventually, the visiting stopped and my friend adopted the girl and everything's fine now.  So, my best advice is to look at the family background first before just picking a child...because you might end up loving the child and wanting to adopt and then the real family will suddenly come out of nowhere and cause problems.  Good luck!!!|`|XadcGNGnaa	I think you are doing a great thing! I think it's nice when people do things like that for others - after all the horrible stories in the news it's great to see people being selfless.<br>  I'm not sure what your question is so that's all I can say <br>  :)
iBtZUcHjaa	i suppose if its a huuge like, split, he will be able to tell.<br>  but otherwise, i dont think so.<br>  but there are things you can do to prevent breaking,<br>  just google it :]|`|9l6MOZ8Paa	yeah|`|MQVmh5hiaa	Shouldn't the guy know.|`|K4ulbvUpaa	Yes a guy can and it's always good to take a look at it after the act and if you feel semen inside of you then it broke! Just a suggestion have the guy pull out before he cums just as a precaution, and i suggest take some birth control to be on the safe safe side!|`|qlepHpX0aa	Sometimes yes the guy can feel the difference it might "feel better "<br>  depending on how tight it is on the guy you might even feel it snap.  But you wont always feel it. Most of the time you wont know until you actually look at it.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|OkCrlU7Aaa	Well if the condom is tight, then the guy can feel it rip.|`|sr0vZPQqaa	Not always, it's best to check it after to be sure.|`|aLO7KBMVaa	I am a guy and have had a condom break on many occasions, Yes you can tell. Most of the time you can hear it "pop" but sometimes not, but if the condom fits properly then the guy will feel it break, if he cant feel it break then he needs to get condoms that fit properly.hope this helps, probably had 20 break and knew all of them did when it happened.|`|SsEN9KRqaa	it all depends if its really rough s*x then maybe not but if its just casual then it would feel like a rubber band snapped and usually it hurts the girl but not all the time tho|`|U8sTUqY4aa	yeah if you see a rip
KtdlJbrOaa	While I have not been in a similar situation, I do think you can make your marriage work.  As long as you are committed to one another, and really want to stay together, you can do anything.  Congratulations and good luck!|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	I have been there before and i can tell you IT all worked out. we had a rocky time for a while but now we are back to being as happy as ever if not happier. it Just takes time and patience. as long as your both honest with each other and set ground rules in order to avoid the same mistakes you can make it work. any marriage can be saved if both people really want it.|`|YORa3jg3aa	Well, you can make it work again, it will just need commitment from both sides.  I suggest counseling though, because while everything might seem to slip back in place, there were probably some root issues that caused all of this.  For example, it's possible your husband was feeling rejected at home while you didn't know he felt that way, he couldn't communicate it to you, and went elsewhere for 'love'.  So go through some marriage counseling, and I'd suggest reading some marriage help books on the side - a good one is "the Love Dare".
a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	it breaks my heart to read your story. but if she didn't want u after she met him, and was willing to dump u for a few dollars, she will do it again to u. if you take her back u will have many heartaches, because of her choices in life. someone who really loves u will not do this because they would not want to see u suffer. truth is there will always be someone she will think is better than u. if u do ever take her back, u need to let her suffer for awhile with the choice she made, don't let her off so easily. stand up for yourself, show her there are consequences, if u don't she will have learned nothing from her choice.don't let her believe that she can shred your heart in pieces and u will still be waiting there like some doormat for her when she is finished with him. nice guys like u are the very ones who get used like this, because they won't stand up for themselves. myself if this were done to me and it has been, i would not take that person back, because there is always going to be someone else, there will always be another man that catches her eye, who she thinks has more. how sad u think u have to have this girl, and that u can't love anyone else.|`|lgxE5nUoaa	No I would not.  I could not trust them.|`|b26NgqOFaa	No I would not.|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	No, dont take her back, start thinking about your own life instead of getting wrapped up in hers. You both got together far, far too young and she is now experiencing the want to be with other guys as she would have done at 15,16,17 etc.,<br>  You need to concentrate on your own life now and put all this down to young love, just because you got together when she was 14 or so does not mean you have to spend your life with her, all you are feeling at the moment is a loss of what you are used to, its not love.<br>  Move on and meet other women you will have a much better time than worrying about things.<br>  Good luck.|`|ZaMzRSrraa	no I woulnnt  once burned twice shy<br>  <br>  and I have self respect...she will leave you again and again ..because she KNOWS YOU WILL TKE HER BACK..YOU ARE HER FALLBACK GUY|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	Honey, how many times are you going to let her break your heart?<br>  If she really loved you, she wouldn't break up with you. Forget about her. Move on, and look for a girl who only cares about YOU, not always trying to upgrade.<br>  <br>  She doesn't sound like a very nice person.|`|scnW0Wzeaa	Dump and run like hell|`|8y3bdMjHaa	i understand that you may love her but it seems she felt trapped and unsure about the things around her(mainly because you too had dated for so long at such a young age). i think in most cases,yours included, dating too young too long ends up badly. if she would not have cheated i would say take her back because she learned what she really wanted after she dated the rich guy but she cheated which is one of the biggest no nos in my book. in the end its ultimately up you but its hard totally forgive and forget someone for cheating and never knowing if when things get bad if they will do it again.|`|AA11596133	I DID NOT BOTHER TO READ YOUR NOVEL - I do not CARE about any of the details you have chosen to cloud your rational thoughts with - - the ANSWER to your initial QUESTION, is <br>  <br>  OH HE** NO!!!<br>  <br>  I would not take back an EX for any reason there could ever possibly be!! <br>  THAT WOULD JUST BE STUPID!|`|PeMpDAbraa	She is going to keep doing this to you IF YOU let her! You may love her but how many times are you gonna let her hurt you? Have some self-respect!|`|lJhl3wLAaa	I would not take her back in a million. I"m not a thing. I'm a person with feelings. I'm not second best. I'm not the back burner just in case you don't have anything on the front burner. She can make her own choices. She chose to date a guy with money. Once she is tired of that she is not allowed to just come back. Once she leaves she is gone. She is 21 and very immature. Not sure what she wants in life and will probably be an unhappy person for a long time until she figures out what she really wants out of life. Don't let her use you again.|`|opRfm2Gsaa	no def not....never go back|`|sCCjAKllaa	Nope. I wouldn't even take her back after she left the first time. You can do much better with another girl then someone who's constantly tryin to get out of the relationship.|`|uNdculYPaa	I don't think you should take her back.. give it some time your heart will heel in time. you don't need someone like that in your life. If you  take your back she will always walk over you as a door mat.|`|5dRvtaGgaa	You really need to dump this girl, permanently.  She obviously doesn't love you if she's going to take up with anyone who's got more money, etc.  She sounds very shallow and stupid to me.  Why would you want to be with someone like that?  Let her know that she is not welcome back in your life.  I can guarantee that she will continually do this to you over and over and over again.  Put your foot down and move on.  It will hurt for a while but you'll get over it soon enough.|`|rTF9Wjp9aa	if you enjoy having your heart broken than continue taking her back... she doesnt see you as good enough for her... and she will most likely keep looking for someone "better" than you...<br>  <br>  <br>  there is a chance that she will eventually realize that a marriage , a relationship, a life worth living can be with you, but thats only a possiblility, and there would most likely be a few more times that this would happen...<br>  <br>  she is not currently in love with you.. it sounds to me that she loves you, but just not the same way you love her....
a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	both have to work today, so that they can make ends meet. but if the husband is financially well off, it is better for the children if the mother can stay at home, especially if the children are not in school yet. i believe that the marriage of yesterday was better, the wife stayed home, her life was taking care of her home and family, today everyone has to work, creating more stress, more work on the woman, and less time to spend with the kids. and when u spend less time with kids they may not get the attention they need or the guidance, because the mother is too tired from having to work.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	A man should support his wife 100%.  But that has nothing to do with whether or not she could or should work.<br>  <br>  You're talking financial support, not mental/emotional support...<br>  <br>  Both parents have a financial obligation to thier children.  If the family structure is that one person doesn't work, the support will come only from the parent that is working.  If the family structure is that both partners work, both should be contributing to the household and child-rearing costs.|`|b26NgqOFaa	omg it depends on what you can afford.|`|VSVQHKwKaa	A man should support his wife and children.<br>  <br>  Whenever you start screwing with that equation, you get marital instability. <br>  <br>  And traditional marriage was far stronger and far happier than our current methods. <br>  <br>  Good Question!|`|AA11596133	Your question is misleading.  To answer your QUESTION, a man should be JUST as supportive of his wife as she is to him. <br>  <br>  As far as working, that should be a very private personal matter - if they can AFFORD to have one or the other stay home to care for the kids, then that IS the way I feel it should be.  NOBODY but the PARENTS should be raising YOUR kids.  The average time kids spend in daycare, is 9 hours everyday!  That just cannot be GOOD! <br>  <br>  "Modern" ways OBVIOUSLY are NOT working!|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	Not very many couples can make it on one income these days.<br>  I think it's better for their self esteem if they contribute to the nest egg.|`|9BsyKN9haa	I think every family is different and as long as they are both happy and the children are taken care of and loved then more power to them. In our case we have done a lot of different things. <br>  <br>  There was a time when he was going to school and taking care of our son while I worked. When he graduated he joined the army adn I stayed home with our son b/c it was a big change for him, with his dad leaving.<br>  <br>  As of right now we have another baby and we decided that i would stay home till she startes kindergarten then i will go back to work. I love having those time with both of our children but will be very happy to back to work. It doesn't bother my husband at all i stay home. After he was a SAHD he realizes how hard and stressfull it can be and every night when he comes home he helpss me in anyway he can.|`|4JrDGW7Taa	Of course, marriages are better off the traditional way with the man working and the mother taking care of her children. There is a definite link between the disappearing traditional marriage and juvenile delinquency. But, I understand fully, that such arrangements do not fit too well into today's world, where the wants are so much greater than what the traditional marriage can provide.<br>  <br>  Still, I will maintain, that a parent's care for their children is far superior than putting them into daycare. All these statistics are available on GovernmentGuide,com/mns. Also check out my source|`|AA12396274	well we had 8 children, so both of us worked ,BUT,Daddy also helped with,all the taking care of them too,nothing is like it used to be hon,you have to make your own little family rules together,just the 2 of you,we didn't have a list ,just if something needed done, one of us went ahead and done it,we both got an allowance for our very own,same as the kids, the rest went in the pot for whatever was needed. good luck,and god bless you both,a little add on, our kids are grand parents now,and they all work and play self confidence goes a long way.|`|ee2eb688bade7663b57e940f752dc454aa	This depends on so much. <br>  What is your financial situation (for example, do you earn enough alone to support yourself and your wife in the lifestyle you desire?)?<br>  Do you have a child or children? How many? What ages?<br>  Is one of you willing to take a part time job (and all that implies for "building" a career) to be available in cases of emergency (a sick child, for instance)?<br>  Are you comfortable with a traditional role split -- you (or your wife) as dependable financial support with the other as full time stay at home person/ parent?<br>  I worked (at the same job as my husband so our salaries were comparable) until we moved to a foreign country for his career. There I worked part time (free lance) until our daughter was born. Then it was obvious one of us needed to stay at home (day care was difficult to find and expensive, and, frankly we didn't want other people raising our child. His job demanded lots of short term -- and spur of the moment traveling, long hours, late nights, some weekend work).<br>  I am ever thankful that I could (and did) stay home for our daughter even though it meant any career ideas I had were effectively put on hold (although I continued to do very occasional free lance work).<br>  I am also very low maintenance (live in jeans, drive a 10-year-old car, not into jewelry, etc.) which makes a huge difference financially.<br>  Obviously, this is not an easily answered question!|`|fQYU96euaa	I think this depends on the situation of the individual family. <br>  For my family, having me stay at home and raise our kids is financially better then if I work. We don't have to pay the 800 dollars per month daycare cost and I am raising my kids not some worker at a daycare, I don't pay gas money to drive to and from work, don't have to pay for lunch out, we just plain save in the long run. Staying at home sucks though, I don't get out often adn don't have many friends, I don't get a paycheck...and that may seem small to some but that paycheck used to represent some Independence....so basically I am sacrificing my dreams of a career for the betterment of our family, because I know it wont last forever and my dreams can be achieved at a later time.|`|Vbdfphhbaa	both should work,keeps the relationship healthy. its ok to take time off to care for children,sice daycare can be costly. I havent worked for a few years and I for one dont like the idea that my hubby is the only one working...I love to work too!|`|Ntj4p0Gqaa	i think both should work.. but when you have a newborn thats a moment in the marriage when the mother should be able to stay home with the cild for a while|`|FQxUpc9baa	both wk and modern ways|`|yN8vmGSnaa	It depends on the two people involved and how they feel really. I have noticed however that when two people work it benefits their relationship because if per say the husband is supporting his wife the man may become resentful of that and the relationship suffers. On the other hand some people make it work with one person working and the other staying at home when little children are involved and day care is too expensive. <br>  <br>  Two people have to choose together what is going to work for them. In the case of my fiance and I we want to both have jobs because times are tough and we need to both have jobs and bring two incomes to the table. His brother also just got married and when they were engaged they both had jobs but his brother lost his job due to layoffs shortly before they got married so his wife supports them both while he goes to school at night. It works for them so they are both happy.|`|0W4S6J5maa	It Truly is an individual (or couple) choice. Whatever you and your husband think is best and agree on, is what you should do.<br>  <br>  I personally work full time. I have a couple friends who stay at home until the child is school age or can at least talk, then they start working outside the home.
mkrKHQvFaa	Something not floral.  Men wear black or blue suits.  I would do the same.  Wear either a skirt or pant suit.  You could also ask your Aunt what she would prefer you wear.  Good luck!|`|lgxE5nUoaa	Wear a very stylish pant suit.  They always look appropriate and classy.|`|BnJRwJiEaa	Wear something nice and not to flashy to take away from the bride|`|bCgW89MLaa	Definitely a nice "woman's wear" outfit.  Pants suit or dress outfit with matching top and bottom.  3/4 to full length sleeves.  Only wear a skirt if it hits your knees or longer and goes with a dress coat (also, nylons must be worn with a skirt for this occasion).  You will want to look a bit more professional than the rest of the guests, without looking like you are going to work at a law firm.|`|6d718b2ca0424bba8e88fd0bd7a40273aa	Most female wedding officiants wear black dresses/black pants suits. Since you are apart of the wedding party a nice dress/pant suit will do. Ask the bride/groom if there is a particular style they want you to wear just to be on the safe side.|`|rpVQpJA7aa	I would wear a pants suit outfit. You need to look classy, but not over dressed. A professional look is good, and don't show too much|`|zsgHqrtEaa	Because you know the couple so well, you could just ask you aunt.  She probably won't care if you wear a solid color as long as you don't clash with her wedding colors.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, I would wear a grey dress (something classic with sleeves) or a pants suit.
e871c3bc7828a54588e8b88635cfba63aa	A civil ceremony is a civil ceremony, unless you are in China or performing the ceremony in Chinese. You could ask the couple if they want to do anything special.|`|7HVsVspOaa	You can do your usual civil ceremony. <br>  <br>  The usual guidelines I go by are no white, all off white, no odd number groupings of candles if you put anything like that out, and if they want a red runner or something that's one of my options for the table. <br>  <br>  In asking these questions and trying to be what I considered culturally considerate, I have found that some of my Chinese couples really want what they considered a "Western Wedding" with everything they have always seen in the movies. From "Dearly beloved, to by the authority vested in me..."<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.
iVnQ4aCiaa	Dump him.  If you don't trust him at all then there isn't any hope.  And why would he not want you living there?  Why would he not send your Christmas present?

Sorry, I'm not trying to be mean, but it's true.|`|5LWq12epaa	I live in Colorado also!!!!!<br>  But if you have a problem with it, you should talk to him and I think that since you havent talked to him in awhile, it would be a good idea to call him and maybe work out your problems.

You need to decide what you expect in a relationship and if he isnt filling that out then to bad for him, it might suck to can him but i promise you will get over it.  you need to be confident in who you are and the right one will come. and lastly he isnt gonna change...|`|YYAu9lFDaa	ok you need to read what you just wrote.<br>  that should tell you that you need to dump this loser, like now.<br>  why would you want kids w/ a someone who cheats and doesn't even care about you or doesn't even want you around???<br>  i mean seriously... read what you just wrote and if you don't get it, then we can't help you.<br>  he doesn't love you if he cheats.
ShdV8jm4aa	Leave him, if he can't quit drugs for you do you think he would do it for anyone else? Your child is the most important thing in your life now. It will be tough but you can do it! If I can you can. <br>  You have this sense of empowerment after you have gotten through the first year, like you can do anything! Trust me, leave him. It may be one of the hardest things but you sound like you are a very strong woman and I trust you can do it. <br>  <br>  Don't tell him you are pregnant. Ask him if he will get off the drugs, kindly, if he refuses be firm. If you have to ask a second time, just leave. Do NOT tell him you are pregnant. I have made this mistake before & I am paying for it! Let him live his life with drugs and with no child. You will get the true blessing. *Hint, you will find someone that loves you both more than anything in the world. :)<br>  <br>  Hang in there. It will get better.|`|qEfM6XRyaa	i was in a similar situation the father of my child drank alot and did alot of different drugs including pills and other narcotics but as soon as i told him i was pregnant he straitened up and started being more responible he was 26 then and well he is doing good no drugs or alcohol and is is so happy to be a dad so i think you should sit down talk to him about the drugs and then ask him wat he would do if he had a family to think about and depending on his answer u then tell him about your pregnancy and im completely against abortion its wrong i believe if u are responsible enough to sleep with someone then u should be responsible enough to care of a child so i hope i helped|`|kqa9VFrfaa	I do not believe in abortion as a general rule, because it is very rough on all involved, but U need to see a doctor right away to see about the health of your baby. A man who takes drugs can cause the baby to have serious nerve damage or other problems. <br>  If U do keep the baby, and U do not want the bf to be a part of the baby's life, then best thing is not to tell him. Get your parent's advice on this. If U want your name ONLY on the birth certificate U must think this all the way through. <br>  If his name goes on the birth certificate, then he will have parental rights. Something to think about.|`|T7qgrOJzaa	First of all, you can't change him. Until he recognizes he has a problem and wants to change it, his behavior will continue. <br>  <br>  And you are right, you need to make a choice, but first let him know that you will not stay with him if he continues to do drugs. You do not want the father of your child to be a drug addict, and then you give HIM the choice. Lose his woman and child or quit drugs. <br>  <br>  You'll know what you'll need to do based on his decision. I hope he makes the best choice for all of you.

Ring him, pick him up from school, visit him, take him for meals, take him bike riding, take him shopping, go to the park with him, get lots of pictures with him so you don't miss him so much when your not with him. Maybe when you get yourself stable and have a flat/house he could come to you at weekends and or alternate weeks [if he doesn't mind that as it means he has to move every week] or just have him over in the holidays.

Who ever said it makes you less than a man. She just has more strength physically.|`|BnJRwJiEaa	I think you need to gain some weight because you r to small.  Maybe if do gain some weigh you might can beat her.|`|kdmhuVTEaa	Perhaps she's just a strong girl lol.|`|CcxITP1Paa	Maybe she just has an advantage than you.  Some people are better at sports and athletic than others.  You can't let that come between you.  It shouldn't matter who is more athletic than the other.  If you are only together because of athletic ability (or as you say, the lack thereof) maybe you shouldn't be together.<br>  <br>  But me personally, I wouldn't care if my boyfriend wasn't that athletic, or if I were more athletic than him.  It's just another thing I could playfully tease him about.|`|sr9gfvzoaa	If your really concerned about it, start lifting and working out more. But it will take awhile for you to bulk up.

If you think you can trust her, let her know what is going on. She can set up some "behind the scenes" work, and she is your best key to hanging out with the girl you like. Maybe you can all catch a movie or something together, at the suggestion of your friend. This way, you aren't being creepy. <br>  Invite your friend and the girl to the party! If you can't invite her yourself, ask your friend to do it for you, in a way that makes it seem like it's an open party, where you told your friend to bring a guest.<br>  <br>  P.S: I suggest before using this method, you should be 100% sure your friend has no feelings for you other than friendship. Because, that would be, well... just bad. haha<br>  <br>  Hope this helps :)|`|6uwGVD3jaa	You don't have to get her to do anything. Just when you see her next time just be like totally cool and say "Hey i''m throwing a party in a couple weeks i was wondering if you wanted to go."<br>  And if she says like "cool, when is it?" Etc. just be like <br>  "I'll text you the details" And then like turn around to leave and be like, "Oh wait i don't have your number."|`|OoNeyVAoaa	there you go! the perfect excuse for you to get her number ok so if you only see her when you hang around with your other friend then do so..and when you do see her tell her about your party and ask her if she can help you with some last details your not quite sure about..trust me it will work! and if you really like her make her your date for your party and remember if you want a girl to like you make her feel speacial!|`|TnjNnVNraa	well the best thing you should do is ask your friends to introduce you to her and then invite her to your party there ya could exchange numbers and get to know each other.|`|qRDHEGHJaa	tell your friend that you like her friend and have her to call and ask her to come to your party. if she shows up then you know she might have a lil crush on you to|`|zFhQJtt9aa	hang out with your frined that will bring her along and talk to her there, also make sure you get her number and invite her to your party then.|`|CcxITP1Paa	Ask her straight out by getting her number.

You can also get your friend to mention you and see what she says. Also, you can get your friend to bring her to your party and see what happens. It sounds like you've got some good opportunities to get to know her at your party.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|Mi8mJeNHaa	Your Friend that is her friend. thats the way in buddy.

We use nature as a reference point for our own behavior all the time. Therefore, we see that suicide is not a logical decision.<br>  <br>  One may argue that our intelligence overpowers the instinct to survive, but who is to say that a culmination in reasoning with ones self that leads to the decision of suicide, is correct?. Obviously the person who wants to kill themself has that say, but that still doesn't mean they are right and justified. <br>  <br>  The goal of life is to achieve enlightenment through learning the views of others. People should not be so ignorant to ignore the fact that even though they may believe things that have happened to them give them reason to commit suicide, there are still basically equivalents of them at another place in the world with similliar situations who are still living and surviving. Why is that so?, there is your answer, continue the journey.|`|bLVa2qYeaa	Because if someone feels things in their life couldn't possibly get worse, then all that could happen is his life getting better. There is always the hope that something good will happen. For a Christian, heaven is a reason not to commit suicide, because no matter how much the world sucks, he or she could go to heaven, and if they kill themselves, they will go to hell, because suicide is a sin in Christianity. And finally, most people have at least someone to love them, and they definitely could stand losing him if he committed suicide (for example, a teenager who commits suicide would take his parents lives away, as well as his own)

SjEH1Lx6aa	Wow, your mother is overly concerned. I wouldn't say anything to her, but leave a page in your notebook that says:<br>  <br>  Mom, it really hurts my feelings that you do not trust me enough so you go through my personal, private things to snoop in my life.<br>  <br>  I know you have done this before and it hurts me that you would do it again. It is sad that I cannot leave my room without being afraid that my stuff is in jeopardy.<br>  <br>  _<br>  If she finds that, she will probably confront your and apologize. Your mom seems like that kind of person.|`|GBy0W2YEaa	carnt you say something like it my mate notebook|`|RvddYKqjaa	Communication goes two ways. A parent has to do what a parent has to do, whether kids like it or not. When kids are forthright with parents, when they pull the silent treatment all the time because "it's the thing to do" parents will find out what they need to know. Your mother has learned what she was guessing all along. You can't be trusted to tell the truth. <br>  You don't sneak out of the house without a parent knowing it. Listen to mom about what you put in your mouth. Read about HVP and learn how you can contact it. Mom is right. If you are under 18, and you're still at home, you go by the rules your parents set. Be glad they care. Do your own thing when you are out on your own. I'm really sorry that you find what she says so laughable. <br>  She's a very wise mom to find out what her daughter is doing.|`|nTDlqdHIaa	Well if I were you I would just talk to her and be honest...it's the best thing to do. I mean she might not like what she hears but at least she will hear it from you straight up and not by reading it. By just talking to her and being honest with her you would probably be surprised at how fast she will change her way of thinking. I'm 22 and when I was like 16-19 I thought my mom was the worst because she asked too many questions and constantly went through my room. Which made me mad but I started talking to her more and stopped ignoring her and now my mom and I are friends. We know our boundaries but we have a new respect for each other. Honesty is always the way to go no matter what it's about!|`|kjcybCOvaa	just confront her at your homes. put it sumwhere where she wont loook. dont go phssco on me plz.|`|Inxmls7xaa	Why can't kids be straight forwards towards their parents?<br>  Just get in that kitchen and say "Mom, we gotta talk".  <br>  Tell her its all cool if she went through your notebook (but tell her you don't want her going through it again cuz its personal).  Then let her know that some of the things she probably have read in your book were just some things you made up.  That's it.  And just say sorry to her if that makes her feel better.  Mothers get hurt easily by their kids and then it takes them a long time to recover.  So don't expect your mom to change so soon, it'll take her time.<br>  <br>  I'm talking to this guy on the phone and my mother has talked to him before.  Now she thinks we wanna marry and I told her thats not the case.  But mothers....phew, their heads are like coconuts, you can't get anything through!  All I said was sorry mom, I didn't mean to hurt you by talking to him on the phone, we're just friends.  The reason why my mom is upset is cuz she asked him "Do you want to marry her?"  and he said "I'll see"....I mean come on, it probably was tough for that guy to say "no" cuz that would be like dissing me.  And he didn't want to say "yes" cuz maybe he really don't wanna marry me.  So "i'll see" was probably the best answer?  And my mom took it wrong.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	You or the people you hang with are probably behaving in a way that caused your mom to worry about you and she went looking in your room for any evidence of what you were up to.  (This is the ONLY reason I think a parent has any right to check up on their kids this way.  As long as the kid is behaving, I think there is no reason to snoop.  BUT if the kid is acting shady or there has been a sudden change in the kid's attitude or who they are hanging with then it's the parent's responsibility to find out what is going on by any means necessary so they can head off a potential problem before it is too big to deal with.)<br>  <br>  You know she read the notebook and she knows you know that she read the book.  There is no reason to accuse her or confront her or whatever about her reading the notebook.<br>  <br>  What you need to do is sit down with her and say something like, "Mom,  what is it that you think I'm doing that has you so worried?  Is there something about the way I've been acting or my friends have been acting that has caused you to be more concerned than usual?"  At this point you just have to agree to answer her questions honestly and listen to what she has to say, even if it feels a bit uncomfortable.  The main thing to remember is that as long as you are a minor child, she is legally responsible for your well being and she has to make sure she's doing all she can to make sure you turn into a responsible member of society and not a canibalizing serial killer.  Also, unless they are abusive, parents really do have your best interests at heart.  They don't want you to fail.<br>  <br>  as to your notebook:  if you don't want her to read it, then stop writing in it.  But keep in mind, that means she's going to be asking a whole lot more questions and a lot more often.<br>  <br>  Once you are 18, the kind of questions she has now will be none of her business.  At that point she has the right to make house rules for her home to be followed by the occupants and if she's bankrolling your lifestyle then she has the right to make certain demands on you, but the mineutia of your life stops being her business.<br>  <br>  She just wants to talk to you.  So freak her out and start the conversation. (doing this also gives you bonus points in the maturity department.  It shows her that you aren't a sneaky little kid and that you want to relate to her as an adult)<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|y5P4dY7aaa	Be honest with her flat out, and talk to her about everything communication is key, but don't be rude or try to get an attitude with her, she is your mother and is gonna love you no matter what.

You won't be rejected by him, if you want something to happen, you're just going to have to make a move on him. Don't wait to long, because you might lose your chance with him and some other girl will take him from you.<br>  <br>  So, when you see him again, just walk by and say " Hi, how are you today?" You know just talk, be yourself, be respectful, down to earth, and give it a shot.

YYcR6lESaa	He is most definitely cheating on you. relationships do cool off after time but not that much for any reason. not getting a business loan is crap to. if he needs 75,000 he has about 400 hundred ways to get it. mortgaging is one way to get it or he can get regular loans. any bank would give him that much for any reason even if his credit sucked|`|1BJKxu09aa	sounds of cheating is If a man leaves the house smelling like his favorite shampoo, and then returns that night smelling like a different brand, it is suspicious.

Your ex is talking about Large big business company's.  Seems you mean -75,000 in debt in his company?  For small business company that is consider a lot.  You do need a loan around 200K to boots up your business,  if loan is not approve and you cannot absorb the debt of 75K then the busy is done, your bf has to declare bankruptcy. In this economy a loan approval is very hard.  Basically your bf is struggling to keep his business.  You are suppose to talk to him and be there for his instead of doubting he is cheating. You need to focus on both of you in life instead of materialistic things.  Materialistic things are just small rocks on the steps.  There bigger steps you guys need to worry about if you plan to married your bf.  BUT if you really think he is cheating on you, talk to him or see where or who is he with on the dinner times.|`|6b6ff719959d29a5aa770465d592c901aa	Venture cap guys wont even ans the phone for 75k, need many more zeros, usually first in is a minimum million, after that its in lots of 5-10 mill.<br>  Unless he has amazing financials and equity to cover a loan - they don't exist right now.|`|fLU63N4kaa	If he's cheating then he needs to (and it sounds very weird saying this about a 40 year old) grow up. I always believed it was pathetic and so immature for anyone to cheat on anyone.<br>  <br>  I'd guess, and like to believe, that he's just really caught up in work but no one here can be sure so maybe you should talk to him about how you feel. If he has nothing to hide then he will calmly assure you of his love for you!|`|qroOTyrGaa	Either way, whether he's cheating on you or not, he's still neglecting you.  Sounds like he makes quite a bit of money, and with money comes power, and with power comes women. Even if he's stressed out, buying someone a mug of chocolate is a thoughtless gift and has nothing to do with his work. Talk to him honestly and bluntly, if nothing is resolved take a look through his phone.|`|6uwGVD3jaa	Hate to say this but it's pretty obvious he's cheating. I mean it's either that or he's being a coward and doens't want to be the bad guy and break up with you. But if he's really changed so much then there probably is another girl.|`|RaVvl5OJaa	Whatever you do DO NOT put on foliage and hide in the bushes or kidnap his phone.

Good luck!!|`|Pxh93GHcaa	He might be cheating but not really sure. You might need to closely monitor his body language like does he make a proper eye contact while talking to you? When he is talking to you what is his hands doing at that time? Does he sensitive about your need or always talks about him? These are possibly few questions you should get answers of before coming to the conclusion. Generally guys after a certain period of time (Like many dates, honey moon so spending substantial time with her woman) they take relationship for granted, they feel like they will always be there for them and be little casual. This does not mean they are cheating. It’s just a phenomenon man posse.|`|eoQoCcz5aa	One would suggest you find the most expensive restaurant you can find , tell this chap of yours you both going for a meal .

He probably is physically exhausted due to too many early mornings and lack of sleep. Add to that his concerns about funding for his business. Contrary to want you think I do not consider 75K to be a small amount (but then I do not mix with rich people). With the current economic climate both here and in the USA businesses can and will fail for want of funding much less than 75k.<br>  <br>  He may not have a nest egg because everything he has earned has been ploughed back into the business. Or excessive spending to give you want you want.<br>  <br>  I have to say that your question strikes me more about your concern about  money than a genuine concern about your boyfriend. You sound like a high maintenance female, of course I may have misjudged you but that is my take on it. <br>  <br>  It is not weird......it is called reality.|`|AA10034000	Haven't you read the news? Noone can even get a loan for a house let alone a freaken' business so I am sure that is what it is for him. His income is his {manhood} It seems. Sounds like you are not very patient or understanding. Why don't you speak to him about it? Ask him if there is something you can do to help him out. If you want to spend alone time with him and long dates, then let him know, he is not a mind reader.....................don't be so insecure.|`|YbwDFvEaaa	In light of the current economic situation in the US, it could be very possible that he's experiencing more stress now than in previous years regarding the performance of his business and bringing in enough funds to stay afloat. Many banks have a freeze on lending so a loan may not be possible for him. It is also possible that he's already tapped out his resources, and simply has not expressed the depth of his dilemma to you. <br>  <br>  This does not absolve him from having to put some effort into your relationship, however. Sit him down and have a discussion with him regarding your concerns, without sounding accusatory. Don't express to him your fear that he may be cheating, but do tell him it worries you that you only see each other once or twice a week and that he doesn't seem all that enthusiastic about his relationship with you.<br>  <br>  If he becomes overly defensive or unreasonable upset, then you will want to consider the fact that he is hiding something from you. You should always discuss concerns with your partner before jumping to conclusions. It's just up to you whether or not what he tells you makes sense, or if he's toying with you and your emotions.<br>  <br>  Good luck.
6EsUGkg5aa	Just be yourself and try and let the conversation flow, talk about the things he's into, like skating, and try and get him really talking that way there's more topic for you to get into and discuss with him, don't be shy, you only life life once, why waste any chances right?|`|vuxef3O4aa	go the scary tough love approch.

But you need to get to know the guy first and then ask him out :)<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|jz7dbg2saa	ask him out,  when talking talk about an interesting topic... <br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Aq4AaKL9jfl49S5ZICdu3cPsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090220084041AAExPYJ">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|iGxEExUhaa	girl if you like the guy and if he is available make use of the opportunity. Set up your game and ask him if hes interested but dont be too possessive|`|1UWBjoLgaa	Ask if he wants to go to the cinema or something and start building it up from there|`|KPYQwyeraa	ask him out be careful though it may ruin your friendship in the end like say you guys have a bad break up or something|`|enn4OfAWaa	Yeah....you're not gonna get anywhere unless you man up and ask him out.|`|cJSxv5n3aa	Well, if you don't have much to talk about, you should consider if this is something you are doing because you really like him, or just because you think he looks good. If it is the latter, its probably not an ideal match, but you never know sometimes things work out anyway.<br>  <br>  Be direct!<br>  If he doesn't have the courage to ask you, then show him who is in charge.<br>  Say "So are you going to ask me out, or would you expect me to do everything for you?"<br>  <br>  maybe he's gay.. you never know.|`|oRUG4VbJaa	well first you have to actually talk to him. sit him down and try explainging it if you cant explain it to him face to face then maybe write him a little letter and give it to him next time you see him either when you first see him or before you leave give it to him however you prefer.. but just let him know thats the best thing to do first. cause if you already got his attention make the move before he thinks your not interested and before some other girl tells him she likes him and he goes for her because you didnt make the move..<br>  <br>   Good Luck!|`|OvQKd508aa	Well, if you don't have a lot to talk about, ask him to teach you stuff about skating or something else he's good at.  You'll have something to talk about and you'll be learning something that could be a lot of fun.  Guys usually don't like having all the pressure of asking a girl out, so chances are if he's flirting with you he already likes you.  Just ask him out and see if he'll go for it.  If he does, awesome!  If he doesn't, make sure you make it clear that you still think he's cool and want to be friends. :)|`|EmOIkLCSaa	even if u ask him, he won't b wit u for longer...<br>  he'll use u n throw away...<br>  n if he doesn't, u'll soon get bored of his weired attitude..<br>  better search a really nice guy, simple, caring and sweet...|`|dEb85e07aa	if i were you i would ask him out cause you never now he might like you to but is scared to ask you out.|`|9vccbqrVaa	Just tell him how you feel.

Best friends don't make a habit of setting each other up for failure or humiliation. Either she has asked him about it, he has mentioned something to her about you, or she just knows you both well enough to realize that you have a good chance together.<br>  <br>  Take your friend's advice, take a deep breath, and ask him out sometime! It can just be a casual date to get lunch somewhere, something simple where you'll have the chance to talk and get to know each other better.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|FM0UrlAJaa	you know he is atleast somewhat interested in you because he flirts with you.  just ask him out to a movie or just hang somewhere|`|SlQD7cpnaa	ask him out dont wait to long 4 it then he might lose intrest or he might not notice u anymore hes proballly a kittle nervous to!!!! <br>  <br>  cj|`|scnW0Wzeaa	Put out!
ZkeoRyy3aa	He does love his gf if he is not getting any more serious with you than being a little flirtatious.  Guys like a little excitement on the side, like flirting, or talking to other women.  <br>  You need to move on and find your own man.  Once your in a committed relationship you'll understand how his gf would feel, knowing your trying to steal her man. Karma.|`|CCXMW0HYaa	Just think, if he dumps her and gets with you, he could do the same with another girl...Find a better kind of guy. What you have going on is a big warning sign of things to come.
1jcnJJN8aa	w h a t ` s L O V E ? <br>  <br>  are your palms sweaty, is your heart racing? and is your voice caught within your chest? <br>  it isn`t love, its like. <br>  <br>  You can`t keep your eyes or hands off them, am i right? <br>  it isn`t love, it`s lust. <br>  <br>  Are you proud and eager to show them off? <br>  it isn`t love, its luck. <br>  <br>  Do you want them because you know they`re there? <br>  it isn`t love, its loneliness. <br>  <br>  Are you there just because its what everyone wants? <br>  it isn`t love, its loyalty. <br>  <br>  Do you stay for their confessions of love, because you don`t wanna hurt them? <br>  it isn`t love, its pity. <br>  <br>  Are you willing to give all of your favorite things for their sake? <br>  it isn`t love, its charity. <br>  <br>  Areyou there because they kissed you, or held your hand? <br>  it isn`t love, its unconfident. <br>  <br>  Do you pardon their faults because you care about them? <br>  it isn`t love, its friendship. <br>  <br>  do you tell them everyday they are the only one you think of? <br>  it isn`t love, its a lie. <br>  <br>  But do you except there faults because they`re a part of who you are? Do you see their true heart, and touch your soul so deeply it hurts? Are you attracted to others, but stay with them faithfully without regret? Would you give them your heart, your life, your death and stay because a blinding in comprehensible mix of pain and elation pulls you close and holds you? now thats LOVE...|`|6CPFRnGraa	I think that most relationships people have aren't necessarily 'love' more so than the hope that the person they are dating is 'the one'. There is a person out there for everyone, you just have to sift through all the people you date to find the perfect one for you. It's not easy. I personally have no dating experience (now you're probably going to question whether or not I should be answering your question, lol). <br>  As for what LOVE is...<br>  For me, love is knowing that I would do anything for that person, no matter what. I don't focus on their faults or listen to the things they say I know are only said in anger. I accept and respect them for who they are. <br>  Hope this helps.|`|UsjRk5DWaa	wow...i was just thinking this right this minute...about how u knw wether u love someone..or are 'in love' with someone...i really am confused myself so sorry...havent got an answer..=S...BUT i gta say i totally loved that 'teddy's answer, totally awesome...!!!!! =)|`|o5uEyrRHaa	Teddy's answer is perfect.

i9IolcIUaa	I have been married for forty years.  My husband is my best friend, my companion, my lover.  I miss him if he goes out for the day and look forward to seeing him when he comes home.<br>  <br>  He listens to me, he brings me tea and toast in bed each day, he loves and respects me, he still likes to buy me nice lingerie. He nurtures me in a gentle unobtrusive way.  He is not full on with compliments but when I asked my son recently what was the positive thing he could see in his parents marriage and he said the way that we look at each other!  We were not even aware of this, so wasn't that wonderful to know that our love is visible to others?<br>  <br>  I can trust him absolutely and he is a godly man too.<br>  <br>  What is love?  Physical attraction, Deep Caring and Friendship and Respect. I firmly believe that marriage is a partnership between three, God, husband and wife.|`|Py3kFnDyaa	well first off.. you should only have one wife that you truly love. then dont just take the first person you meet that may say they love you because they may not mean it and will hurt you more in the end. love is when you think about the person all day . do things to make them happy even if you dont like it. say thank you and i love you a lot. also a lot of physical touch !!|`|eIWPl5yVaa	Don't kill yourself before your time. 5 women !!!. WOW!!!|`|4EWCegiRaa	Well, using and abusing" love obviously isn't good.<br>  <br>  But someone said last week (to me) that Love is giving someone the ability to destroy you and trusting them not to.  I think that about sums it up.
DgvDXlV0aa	You probably shouldn't put that much info about someone else online!|`|eIWPl5yVaa	Giving Personal information about the person  on the web might hurt not heal the wounds.
lkNJNnlSaa	stop being a wimp.<br>  <br>  <br>  You will be fine if what you say is true.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT - I'm sorry, that was quite insolent of me. I'm sure you will be fine. 6th Form is nothing like years 7-11, everyone gets along with eachother and you speak to loads of different people you thought you would never speak to in a million years.<br>  <br>  Just be yourself and keep doing whatever it is your doing as it seems to be working (according to you).<br>  <br>  There's nothing to be nervous about.<br>  <br>  There is something magical which happens during the summer before 6th form starts where most of the kids actually grow up and act like adults - so there is hardly ever any bullying or teasing (you will get the occasional thing where you play pranks on one another).|`|4WttCv0paa	Just talk to everyone you meet. Ask the same questions: What courses you taking? What school did you go to? Go on holiday this summer?<br>  Everyone's nervous starting sixth form, use that to your advantage.|`|0RJK65zcaa	be yourself, your in college if you are still getting bullied, then you've got serious issues....when you are in college for the most part everyone is grown and have there own life so the last thing they have time to do is to sit around and bully someone. when you go off to college being nervous is normal but remember these are people from all over the world so youll be fine when it come to friends..... the word popular for college is not common..... for my college everyone is known in there own way sooooo, just relax and get ready|`|AA11225881	college is filled with more matured people, who are only worried about their classes and grades. friends are important but most college people don't pay attention to the geeks or popular people. they have their own life and their own goals.<br>  <br>  so i suggest you stop trying to prove yourself and just let things come naturally. stop thinking about it to the point where you get yourself nervous over something that doesn't need to be worried about.<br>  <br>  talk to people, to the ones you want to talk to. talk to your classmates and get to know them well. what happens outside of classes is up to you.<br>  <br>  you choose your friends, you choose your crowd.<br>  <br>  be comfortable with yourself. that's all there is to it.<br>  <br>  everything else should follow.|`|WPlEOkE5aa	just raise ur head, look at other people and think " im different, im cool, im smart" ur gonna get along in life, the bullys wont. just be confident talking to new people, make sure they know what ur about.
eIzv9Lwwaa	i had a bf two yrs older than me at that age. our bdays r a month apart. we were on and off and i thought the same thing when we broke up. we kept in contact and he thought i was trying to make him jealous by dating other guys. he dated like two girls while i dated like 5 or more guys. i am not the jealous type unless im really into a guy and want him so bad and feel helpless. im a virgin so yea and it was long dist. we arent together and i believe we are over. we talk less than ever and yea... from 13 to 17... he is 19 now. i think he thinks im too immature and he is going to the army so idk. your bored of the usual, just do more. he wants to be with you thats y he barely dates otha chix. let him eat you out lol! another time do something to him. have sex. dont feel pressured.|`|q2POh1dEaa	too young|`|BO28Mn8haa	13? girl you are going to regret that. i promise you that.<br>  <br>  and he doesn't do it because he prefers to wait for u. but he seems clingy. <br>  <br>  i waited until i was 18 to start having sex. i'm 20 now and its getting pretty redundant. imagine if you start now at 13? seriously, please.. you will feel like a whore later on in life. take advice|`|FM0UrlAJaa	i would say that he doesnt get a new gf when you break up because he still wants to be with you and dont want you to think he is over you.  as for the other part......... wait for the sex.|`|IkAtIQumaa	Guys DO talk to other girls when you're broken up. You just don't know about it.|`|UsJDUm1Haa	ok. uhm maybe hes not getting a gf because he is in love with you.  and if you like him then you have to stop going out with other guys its making you look like a player. no offense. dont have sex at your age its stupid. your only 13 what if you get pregnant have you thought about that? what if he is using you? and save your virginity for when your older and your with someone who you really care about and your mature enough to handle all situations that i said above.|`|ze4Gt1araa	Well I believe he does that because he really likes you a lot and he doesn't want to get with another girl that isn't you and that's really cute of him.<br>  <br>  About second part of your question if you want an advice your too young for sex your only 13 you got enough of time in front of you and more guys to come make your first time with someone you DO love and when you're more mature about it.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|3yWAyps4aa	I thought i would answer this by telling you that your far too young to even start thinking about things like that. Hes just using you to what he wants. You can tell your only 13 as your so immature. Your first line was i am deeply in love with him. Your 13, you dont even know what love is. I hope you enjoy raising your child at 13. bye bye|`|pxS4pY2paa	1st answer: Maybe he really likes you and doesn't wanna see u with anyone else. <br>  <br>  2nd answer: um dont do anything just yet.<br>  u r 2 young for dat<br>  just wait a little longer and if u cant wait n u feel he's da one then go for it. Don't move into it to fast.|`|dEb85e07aa	He might not get another girl because he really loves you and doesn't want another girl.<br>  <br>  <br>  And if i were you i would not do it with him until you now that you are ready.|`|7BaHGMEyaa	i'm 13 too! :)<br>  he doesn't want to have another girl because he obviously has strong feelings for you :]<br>  when i lost my virginity we started slowly like fingering,hj,him down on me then we had sex.|`|gVMmdeLcaa	WAY too young
YnG0Tjxjaa	It does sound like she's using you. The new-ness wore off and it sounds like she's bored. Doesn't sound like she's a very nice girl. Haha, I don't think it's an American girl thing. We have the ability to appreciate a good man, but it sounds to me like she doesn't.|`|0SIhrYCbaa	If you really like her as you say then none of this wold bother you. But it does and it should. Why would you really like someone that is miserable every time you are together? No one can tell you what her problem is but her, have you asked? <br>  Its not because she's an American girl because many of them would be thrilled to have the relationship you describe. <br>  You need to decide why you bother seeing her if she doesn't seem to enjoy your time or your company.<br>  Don't waste your time on anyone who isn't willing to make the same effort.<br>  Move on.<br>  <br>  Nobody can use you unless you let them.|`|Rf2r23sYaa	You need to ask her this yourself. Seriously. Just straight up ask her "I'm trying really hard to make you happy. I fly across the world to see you. I buy you gifts. I take you to nice dinners. But, you never seem happy. What's going on?" <br>  <br>  It's not an American thing. It's something with this particular woman.|`|sCr2iTczaa	I think she is a been there done that kind of gal. I think that she is unappreciative about things and she should at least be happy that she has some one who likes to do  nice things for her. Trust me she won't realize what she had until you break up with her that is for sure.|`|1KPKEsHsaa	Yea, she's using you, unless she gave you some POO- NANNY, already.|`|DkVofG9paa	sounds like she lost interest in you.  a woman is going to be excited about anything her man does for her, if she's into him.|`|cspcpTkBaa	maybe she justs misses being with u in a private place. u hav 2 remember, YOU CANT BUY HAPPINESS. maybe u should just find sumwhere, like ur or her house, and spend sum quality alone time together. dont go to far to where yall r gettin naked and freakay, but just watch a movie and cuddle or sumthin. BEST OF LUCK TO YA!|`|FpwRrOwxaa	I don't know. How old are you? How old is she? I have a sister that lives in California with my parents. She's always calling and telling me about this one guy that lives in London. I don't know. It might be an american thing.|`|EcSbNWMbaa	Maybe she doesn't want material things. Do something creative and romantic for her and see if she acts more excited.<br>  If that doesn't work, your relationship sucks butt. <br>  End it homeskillet. (:|`|n6IBfiDPaa	Well you really should be talking to her about this. See what she wants to do. Ask what makes her happy. Maybe she is happy but it just doesnt come across like she is..|`|XGo8O6bXaa	You are being too nice to her, you have to like, be mean to get her to like you.|`|edde127b1150f72ea601ce2bc4a9a90baa	I suggest that you take her out for a nice dinner, and ASK her!.|`|SqDXxAeGaa	maybe she's mad at her self because she might have slipped on the trust issue....|`|JtYNXoRdaa	A) If she were using you, she would be thrilled that you did all this expensive stuff for her.  That doesn't seem likely.<br>  B) It is possible that she's just not that into you anymore.<br>  C) Only you can decide that.<br>  D) It could be.  It's very difficult to stay emotionally connected when you are physically so far apart (speaking from a long distance relationship experience)<br>  E) Only she knows that.  <br>  <br>  It could be that she likes you just fine but doesn't know how to respond to these grand declarations.  You say that she was really excited to do all the touristy stuff.  But she seems miserable when you take her to expensive restaurants or buy stuff for her.  Sometimes, women just don't like that kind of stuff.  Some women feel that they then have to put on a show.  Maybe expensive stuff just isn't her language.<br>  <br>  Something you may want to look up...love languages.  There are 5 of them, and everyone falls into at least ONE category.  Their "love language" is what they need to feel wanted, loved, appreciated.  One of the languages is "gift giving" - it sounds as though this is YOUR language and what YOU need to feel appreciated.  And that's totally fine, but it may not be hers.  I just ended a relationship because we just didn't make each other feel needed, appreciated, loved, anything...and I JUST read about love languages.  I had no idea about them before, but it's really obvious to me now that we had totally different ones.  And that's okay, but the idea is to figure out which one your S/O needs and attempt to do that kind of stuff.  If he and I had understood that, we'd probably still be together instead of feeling like this.<br>  <br>  Or just talk to her and tell her everything you just told us.  We women like to communicate.  Oh, and her being American has little if ANYTHING to do with it.|`|6uwGVD3jaa	Believe me, it's not an American "thing". I think that you really need to talk to her about it and ask. Because you can never really know what the situation is. She just may be unhappy with the relationship and how it is. Or maybe she's just having problems at home/ with friends/ etc/ But its very inconsiderate of her to do that all the time, considering how much you work. <br>  <br>  I suggest break it off and find someone that will actually appreciate you.|`|s6s4BBkDaa	May be the same thing, I provided all the top  shelf foods for the Girl for years, and she never ate much, and always shoved her portions to me<br>  I blew up and she remained the same, after our separation, I learned that feces was to her tastes. yeah American Girls are unique and the Skeletons in their closet rumble all the way back to Europe.  Mate, read "Blind faith", by torn between two Lovers.lol***END***|`|oHN6jwjoaa	maybe to her you seem like you are trying to buy her love. ask her whats wrong or ask her what she wants to do. this would be a tough situation because maybe she wants to spend time with you and not do anything.<br>  <br>  some girls like to just relax and spend some "quality" time at home.<br>  <br>  good luck =D|`|7zIAKszxaa	well i think she is depressed maybe she doesnt want you to buy her stuff all the time go for walks or swimming do something where you guys can spend time alone maybe she just wants to be with you <br>  when you guys are spending time alone ask her whats bothering her <br>  <br>  good luck ?<br>  email if needed|`|zih6UH0laa	i think she doesnt like you anymore and its not an american thing...<br>  well maybe it is..<br>  but she doesnt want to tell you.<br>  maybe you should take her to a crappy resturant and buy her dead flowers... see how that floats her boat..<br>  if it makes her happy, hell, she's weird.|`|kkVHXm1Kaa	talk to her about it thats my best advise i am american and i do not do those things so i think you need to talk to her directly|`|qoq9WlPxaa	Perhaps she is a little homesick? <br>  <br>  probe around with he feelings and find out whats bothering her.|`|gzWwwsg0aa	we american women are very confusing .. .it is just a trait that we posses she is not into you any more i am sorry but you should get another g/f|`|PmJdmMduaa	well, i don't think it's an "american girl" thing. i think maybe you two need to connect in ways that you guys haven't before. find out what she likes to do instead of trying all the "normal" likes in a girl. she seems to be special to you, so you can try to do something that might be special for her and not for other girls. maybe try asking her what's going through her mind when you do all these sweet things for her.<br>  i'm sure she sees the effort in you doing all these things for her. just from this question, i can see that you give a lot of effort in making her happier. goodluck with everything!
DtUy1IFmaa	Your boyfriend is not being very understanding about this.  Driving over an hour and half to work is going to end up taking its toll on you + the fact that you loathe the rural area he wants you to move into.  Your going to move in and instead of being happy your going to be miserable.  Isn't there any way you both can come to an compromise and maybe find a place somewhere in the middle of town and rural area?  Is there a suburb somewhere that's not far from his family and friends and your life in town?  If he wants to marry you as much as you wanna marry him he's going to have to learn how to compromise.  It's not all about him.|`|oP71CqVjaa	well i suggest that you compromise why don't you move to the Edge of the city therefore its between the two.The edge of the city tends to be quieter however you still have all the facilities tell him that if he loves you he will move .

Treat it like you would with any other relationship, just see what happens. Did he feel comfortable with it?<br>  <br>  Try talking to him about it and see if he feels the same. If he does, then you might have a very happy relationship in store, but if not, that answers your problem for you, that this relationship won't work.<br>  <br>  Don't freak out, take it slow.|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	You could be bi, or you could have just experimented and now your head does not know what to think.<br>  Leave things alone and see where your feelings lie in all of this when the dust has settled.<br>  Good luck.|`|AfnQ95Z5aa	Happiness is hard to find.

0LvWiESWaa	Yes, she sees you as a potential boyfriend,|`|IvMPh09baa	how about this genius... ask her out!  That way, you can kill two birds with one stone.  You will know, if she says yes she likes you... if she says no... then she's not intersted. <br>  <br>  Hint: women don't like men that wait around and analyze her, we like men that have the ability to ask us out.|`|OBCvewW2aa	If you were a potential boyfriend she wouldn't lay her cards out on the table like that.|`|LVlS4y7Caa	By her words, I would assume she is INTERESTED...When you haven't met someone?

But, she's kind of forewarning you that IF things do NOT work out between you, not to worry, that you'll have many chances in the future because of all your pleasing attributes.  So, I'd take it that YES you're her main interest at this time.  She also did pay you many compliments however which WAS nice of her.  Good luck, & hopefully you'll be able to make her happy just so things w/stay the way they are rite now.  Best to you...:)|`|bqkfu6Diaa	She wants to hook up. But she is also a woman, so even though she means what she says and fancies the idea of hooking up, she could very well change her mind by the time you became available (even tomorrow). Don't throw away a relationship for the chance of something that seems more appealing. It will eventually catch up to you, and it will really suck. Been there, done that, lesson learned.|`|qWepK294aa	Whatever you do, don't mess around, don't be immoral.<br>  when you get married then it's right, but until then, don't do it.<br>  When you have relations before you are married, or with someone else, other than your spouse, you destroy your future. This is serious, don't take it lightly!<br>  If you're ready to get married, ask her out, but not otherwise.|`|Ntj4p0Gqaa	she could be potential... but hey maybe she is just testing waters because females do that. they see someone already with a gf and since they cant have them they do and say anything to twist things up.|`|ILTKY48gaa	Hmm... <br>  I think that shes flirting, that means that she thinks of you as a close friend though. <br>  If you like her I think you should ask her out.|`|bCgW89MLaa	She likes you

Most religious organizations won't marry you if you're not a member of the congregation.<br>  <br>  A church wedding and a civil wedding are the same.  The only difference is that in a church wedding, your union is blessed by God.  But if you don't go to church and/or don't worship God, there's no point in having Him bless your marriage.|`|aDIPIu7xaa	We were married in our Catholic Church but we both actually assist at Mass regularly.<br>  <br>  I kind of think its hypocritical when people that do not regularly attend church want to get married in one.<br>  <br>  If God isn't good enough for people ALL the time, why would you want to include him on your wedding day???  Makes no sense to me and I think its offensive to God, as well.|`|aEpPt9koaa	How old are you? You sound like your too young to be married. Anyway, I'm getting married in a church because I personally believe it is important to have God's prescence in your marriage. But that's me, if you don't believe in God or aren't a religious person then get married in a church. Its up to you.|`|IvMPh09baa	my husband and i were married by both.<br>  <br>  we did a civil ceremony at the courthouse for legal reasons, and 3 months later we had a traditional ceremony at a catholic church.  <br>  <br>  its normal to do this in his culture, and the legal reasons for our marriage were advantageous at the time.  <br>  <br>  do both!|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	I got married in the church I had been a member in for a very long time and the wedding was attended by many of the members.<br>  <br>  I wonder about the significance these days of a church wedding for people who are not religious and are not attending church.  I don't think there is some special magic bestowed on the union, but I guess it makes for some nice photos.|`|rFMRgHTdaa	First of all don't think about the whole if it doesn't work out thing. If you are planning on getting married its because you plan on being with that person forever. Personally i would go with the church idea just because i believe when you get married its not for legal purposes but because you are in love and want to be united as one in Jesus house. So if you feel that way and can afford a church wedding i would say go for it. I would be honored if my FH wanted to get married through church instead of court.|`|LVlS4y7Caa	I see no mention any way, of having a faith to do so...I see a church for you two as a fancy building to legitimize your nuptials morally.

Well, methinks you might not be ready for marriage just yet.<br>  <br>  Sincerely,<br>  <br>  Grace|`|79wOWoM0aa	I got married BY a pastor but it was in a park.<br>  <br>  Are you sure you are ready to get married?

Think about it, how can it?<br>  <br>  I'd base my decision on that.|`|6PhSENcXaa	I've been married for 31 years and it was in the church and if I had to do it all over again it would be in the church.  As the groom it was fantastic to watch my beautiful bride walking down the idle.  I still remember that moment like it was yesterday.  And my wife feels the same way, it would be in the church for her also.<br>  All our friends and family were there it was just the greatest day ever.  Something we'll always remember and cherish for the rest of our lives.|`|AA11803994	My husband and I were married by a justice of the peace. To this day, I really regret not having a church wedding with all the bows and whistles and a real honeymoon. I feel like I left God out of our marriage. He's the one that invented marriage. Marriage is such a special union between a man and a woman and it should be forever. However, from the information you gave above, it sounds like you aren't quite sure if you want to marry this guy....that if you do, it might not last. I would recommend not marrying him if you have doubts because marriage is hard enough when you don't have doubts and are truly in love. Marriage is a lot of work. It means that two people become one...two people with different ideas...ways of doing things..opinions....and it takes work to get a long with each other but it's worth the work if you love each other. Just imagine not being very in love and just marrying this guy because you like him? I can tell you right now you're marriage won't last. Now-a-days a lot of people think marriage is just something fun to do because you're bored. Finish school, do things you want to do, get a stable job and then think about marriage with someone you really love and want to spend the rest of your life with. But to answer your question....getting married in a church is a special event if you aren't opposed to the religious aspect of it. However, Justice of the Peace is cheaper....but most girls want their wedding to be a special event...cheap or not. Best Wishes!!|`|AA12205301	It doesn't matter if you get married by church or court. It  is still legal. And you can still get a divorce as easily if needed.  If you belong to a church and want to do it there, it is mostly for show and to invite everyone. God doesn't really care where you get married. If it is sanctified by him, you can get married on an ant hill and he doesn't care. If it isn't sanctified by him, then again he could really care less. Do you know truly if it is sanctified by God?  If you don't care then why do you care where you get married??? God sanctified marriage as in the institution but he doesn't sanctify each and every marriage. And getting married in a church doesn't safeguard your marriage from problems.  It is all for show.  And he went out with your friend, who's to say he won't go out on you again?  Doesn't sound good to start with. Just because someone is married in a church or by a preacher, doesn't mean it is blessed by God. Just because a preacher or church goer says it is blessed doesn't mean that it is truly blessed by God. Only God knows and the person if he tells them personally. And in order for that to happen, that person has to have a deep and personal relationship with God and know how to discern if it is truly God speaking to them. And to truly discern you have to have been baptized with the holy spirit. Most people believe that if they attend church, that they have the spirit. Sadly they are mistaken.|`|JAKKanVUaa	first off just make sure that you really want to get married. I made that mistake I married my now ex husband because I thought that's what my family wanted me to do. so before you even ask the question about were you should be getting married make sure that you really want to get married and make sure that you really love the person your with. and as for were to get married make your wedding something that the both of you will remember and that makes the both of you happy. You can get married any were, the same rules apply were ever you get married.|`|dK2Zv21Daa	you should be  more concerned with the  fact that he never  wanted to get hitched in the first place. <br>   And What is  different about  the  church or the court ? <br>  All the baggage here is making me afraid<br>  section by section you are telling us that this is an accident in the making, we just  need a time and a place . Relations like  this leads to only  one conclusion, and in the process marriages gets a bad name|`|EBpGhx0Iaa	you dont want to marry someone who took you for 2nd best. not cool. you sound too young to be getting married. it costs alot more to get divorced than it does to get married these days. don't do it. go find yourself a real man that loves you, not your friend too. and be with him for more than 2 months or 2 years.|`|ENSGrZAqaa	If you are religious then I guess you could get married in a church. If not go to the courthouse. The church will recognize it either way I would think.|`|dPk7dr7laa	Well, personally I would get married by church because i am a born-agaon-beleiver in God and I know that marriage was a gift that God gave to us. It started that way and should remain that way. I would not choose a court because who knows if the person marrying us is a beleiver in God. In any case, court or church, God is the head of all marriages anyway and so it is just my personla prefference and conviction to get married in a church by a God fearing pastor.

KtdlJbrOaa	It depends on what was left blank.  If it's unimportant, the judge could decide to let it fly as is, or just fill them in while you are in court.  On the other hand, if it's something significant, the judge may continue the hearing until your husband has all his ducks in a row & it ready to proceed.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	Yes.

And you should never turn over something with your signature that have blanks because they can be filled in later with whatever.  Assets are usually the biggest parts of a divorce after kids.|`|FXCoGD44aa	The judge isn't going to dismiss the action because of blanks. <br>  <br>  I believe what you are talking about is a financial declaration/affidavit. Those are to be filled out to "the best of your knowledge." If he didn't know the exact balance of a checking account, it would actually be correct to leave it blank rather than put in a false number.<br>   <br>  Just bring it up during the hearing. Mention that you have assets A, B, and C that he didn't list.<br>  <br>  However, I would highly recommend looking into having a lawyer. If you have all the assets that you say you do, it would be within your best interest - truly.|`|DRKzzw0Haa	Get a lawyer now. Only then will you be sure of the correct answer. It doesn't sound right to me. The balances have a required knowledge for both parties for sure. If the paperwork is incomplete then the divorce will remain in limbo until all parties are satisfied. Your shared possessions should be on paper also.|`|tZGc8JRuaa	It's hard to say. I guess it depends on the Judge or Magistrate and how picky they are going to be.

You have 2 homes and a boat and he filed Pro Se? Okay this will be long, but you will need to prepare for possible questions in court tomorrow. ...<br>  <br>  1. Are the homes paid for? When were they purchased? What did you pay for them? What do you owe on them? Whose names are on the mortgages/titles?<br>  <br>  2. When was the boat purchased? Whose name is on the title? Is it paid for? What did you pay for it? How much do you owe on it?<br>  <br>  3. Do you own any vehicles? How many? Year/Make/Model of each? Are they paid for? Whose names are they in? How much do you owe on them? <br>  <br>  4. All other assests... Retirement Funds, 401Ks, life insurance, pension plans, profit sharing, jewelry, big ticket items (ie: electronics, antique furniture, artwork, anything of any value at all) same basic questions, value, when purchased, amount owed, etc. <br>  <br>  5. Children? that is a big one! Names, dates of birth, and if he is biological daddy. I won't go deep in to that one because if there are not any that makes life easier, but if there are some, then get ready that is a negotiation that can seriously cause issues. <br>  <br>  6. OKAY as for the blanks, have the answers at the hearing. Make sure he hasn't accesssed any accounts and cleaned them out or tried to take your name off accounts that you were originally on. Also make sure that you have all the pertinent information on any accounts his name is not on. In some states even if his name isn't on the account if you are married he has the righ to half of it anyway. <br>  <br>  7. The judge can throw it out, but also may not, he may negotiate the entire thing right there. It depends on his temperment, the state you are in, and a whole list of other stuff. <br>  <br>  My suggestion, go to the trial with every document you can possibly think of regarding everything of value, some people even argue over the coffee pot and who get it. If both houses are fully furnished the judge may do rock paper scissors to assign a house to each of you, and if you do not agree on things he can order you to sell everything and split the money in half. You really will want an attorney at some point, but get ready if you choose not to have one.
EDumvVTcaa	It depends on which unit you're stationed.  More often than not, small boat search and rescue (SAR) stations, marine safety units, integrated support commands, personnel service centers, district offices, air stations and electronic support units don't leave home for extended periods of time. The cruises on cutters can last 1 day to 4 months away from home port.  I've never been stationed aboard one but I heard that they try to make sure the cutter crew is home about 50% of the time.  The work schedule at SAR and air stations is 48 continuous hours at the station, 48 hours at home and then repeat.  The other units usually have a 7:30-4, M-F schedule unless there's an oil spill, crash or something.<br>  <br>  USCG moves people to new units every 4 years.  They pay the moving expenses.  USCG gives everybody 30 vacation days/year, even guys fresh out of boot camp.  There are units in big cities and small towns, in the midwest, Great Lakes, east coast, west coast, Gulf coast, and Pacific islands.
gYuJUyvvaa	Talk to him while he is over seas and wait until he gets back. Give the guy something to fight for.|`|JjU6IdnDaa	Lesson Number One.  Life is and will always be about self.<br>  <br>  He is gratifying himself.  You are pleasing you.  Sharing intimate pleasure applies the same equation.  You get off.  He gets off.  You got what you wanted "we slept together and all that good stuff".  He was your sex toy.  Learn to be honest with self about intimacy.<br>  <br>  There is greater appreciation for and respect of self.  When you write and reread your diary or journal make certain the reputation builds rather than diminishes.<br>  <br>  You don't know anything about "know that for a fact" what your girlfriend did or did not do with this guy.  Just make certain you both practice birth control and safe sex. If you didn't, mutually encourage getting checked out.<br>  <br>  Integrity is the something that friends can share.  <br>  <br>  Attempting to establish ego based rationale is tricky and flawed.  You and your girlfriend will probably remain friends beyond the brief intimate moments each of you has shared with the same guy.  It is really OK, since most social interaction at this stage of life is really generic learning.  Girlfriends have been taking notes on the same guy for ages.<br>  <br>  Determining with whom to be social or romantically intimate is an evolution of experience.  Maintain focus on career and educational pursuits.

Be there for him when he is feeling down, listen when he needs to talk, and do special little things for him that help him feel appreciated.|`|EmOIkLCSaa	show u care, ask about his work, his friends, help him doing his regular things, prepare his favorite food, arrange for his favorite movie, ask him to call once he reaches his destination if going out, ask the reason if he's late than normal time.. that's enough i guess...|`|woqSJNDiaa	tell him you love him and make sure you show ur appreciate of everything he does|`|M71hN9OBaa	plan a special night for him.<br>  leave him cute notes in his car/bookbag|`|TUl45tIZaa	By treating him with love and respect.|`|KNX8Oqfnaa	suck|`|OntE0pjhaa	go down on him...really...I'm not joking.

RvddYKqjaa	You take time for each other, and you vow not to fight. You CAN stop fighting. Loving couples don't fight about everything. It takes both of you to argue, so don't put the blame on him. You don't tell him not to fight. You just don't fight back, and never in front of the children. Get counseling if you can, or try separating for a while, to see if you at least miss each other. Remember what drew you to each other. Keep that in mind, and stop bickering like children.|`|FtyLwqR5aa	Hire a baby sitter and get a weekend away. Try to talk about the problem if that dont help then go for counseling if all else fails get out. it is not healthy for the kids to see this all the time.|`|9gxzPlZZaa	I think what you guys need is time alone at least once a month. make it a point to be all by yourselves once a month. When there are kids it is very hard to have quiet time and when we have so much stress in our life we seem to forget about our loved ones. Both of you need to sit down and talk and plan dates enjoy each other like the beginning. All I can say is just make an effort to hold each other to talk to each other and to just spend time alone. At least once a month.|`|pOTigVYPaa	There are two things that need to be addressed.  You said your fights are mostly over stupid things.  So, choose your fights.  If you know it's a silly fight then stop it.  Be mature about it. Leave the fighting to the kids.  Next, you absolutely have to make time for each other!  Start having date nights every week.  Trade babysitting with a friend.  One night a week you watch your friend's kids while she goes out for a few hours and then she does you the same favor.  I'm sure that once you make a practice of dating once a week the fighting will soon end.|`|Wo4Gxtduaa	okay first it seems to me that both of you may be stressed out. see if you can find a way to reach him and let him know whats on your mind. trust me hes your husband he would want to listen to you lol. when things get sorted out do something nice for each other such as cool dinner. have the children go with mom for a day or two. what happens mainly is that both of you have lost the connection and need to gain it back. if you do the following you should have no problem.<br>  <br>  <br>  good luck ^_^|`|H3WHxCgaaa	It takes two people to fight.  You are just as much a part of it.  Go to marriage counseling and get it all out - in a neutral place where the children don't have to hear it.|`|7SwfRs4Uaa	I have the same problem with my boyfriend of 4 years (not to say it's the exact same, but...). We fight over plain stupidity. Half the time neither one of us can remember what the fight was about and when we do, we almost wish we didn't because it is so ridiculous. <br>  Both of us notice it and have discussed it. We made a corny thing to do, to say a word we agreed on. When we'd be in the midst of fighting, hopefully one of us would catch on to the stupidity and then say the word. Both of us would stop talking, take a breather. USUALLY when we came back to talk, no more of a conversation was needed because it was so silly from the start.<br>  <br>  My point is, one of you has to knock the convo out in the middle of it. Eventually this stupid fights are cut down and eventually you can avoid the conversation from even happening.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|DRKzzw0Haa	Everyone said counseling and they are correct.  When you really don't want to fight...the expression..., you can be right or you can be happy, is a good one for the petty stuff. <br>  <br>  For the major stuff the question... why do you feel that way... is good to hear what he thinks or if  he has thought about it at all.<br>  <br>   If all else fails and the argument is inevitable then the three best phrases are 1st..OH...    2nd... Oh I see    3rd.... Oh I see, I'm sorry you feel that way.|`|3M3htWrBaa	consider counseling or try watching the movie fireproof it really helps people with this problem
WRcbYyroaa	Bro, just be yourself. as cheesy/lame as that sounds, you already were able to do SOMETHING right in order to snare her, so just continuing being you, and you will continue to keep her.<br>  <br>  When you take her out, mix it up. Take her to movies on some night, to the clubs on others, and other local spots to hangout. Then on some nights spend along time with her. That way you're still doing what you guys love, but keeping it fresh so that either of you won't get bored.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps and good luck.|`|Qe95LNxYaa	talk about something that both of you like
SToOdHj1aa	Definitely not the first date, but after that it just depends on how things go.  If it feels right on the 2nd go for it, if it doesn't then wait until it does.|`|KRE5oflKaa	i think the only safe time is when you are married.  that way you know for sure he is committed to you and you are less likely to get hurt|`|6EsUGkg5aa	Whenever you feel comfortable is when it's okay to 'put out', whenever it's not a feeling of pressure, or anything similar, only when it's a safe comfortable feeling, but also keep in mind that 'putting out' early does come across as easy, and make attract the wrong kind of crowd, waiting is generally good because you see if the guy wants you, or someone else.|`|1KPKEsHsaa	it depends|`|0LwNYEUdaa	Nice question. I will be honest and blunt. Personally men don't like easy women. From my point of view the longer you take the better. What that does is build up anticipation. It allows men to appreciate you more. If you rush the cu'chie  then mama you're a hue'che. But seriously sometimes there is that instant connection and **** happens. It a good thing when it does. But if it happens because you think he looks good or he gat money then its not worth it. At the end of the day always think about your dignity. Once you lose that you've lost everything. There was an occasion when I thought that my ex- girlfriend  was the one for me. Man was i wrong. When we met we were both on the rebound. She was hot. I was hot.  She was looking for a man. I was looking for a woman. Dam the next night I was grinding her like there was no tomorrow. Three times a day, Twenty-one day days in a week. That **** went on for like a month. Finally I got tired and I was like 'what next babe'. I didn't know a **** bout her and she didn't know dam bout me. all we knew was that we were horny *** bitches. It felt like love.  We felt chemistry. we felt so connected. By the time I got to know her I didn't even want to see her. Thats the reality.<br>  The answer to your question is. 'love the lover, not the player'. <br>  It never really safe but humans are gracefully fond for talking risks . Thats the only way you learn how to survive|`|M5kUNkbMaa	i think it depends on the situation.  i'd definitely say no way to 1st or 2nd date...but i have gone for it by the 3rd date before--we only saw each other every week though and talked on the phone in between (we lived an hour apart)...<br>  <br>  so i don't know, it just depends on if you feel it's right...if you have other interests, other than sex.  if you have sex too soon, itm ight not last, not because you did have sex, but just because you haven't made any other connections first--haven't found other common interests, etc.<br>  <br>  i'm 27, and married now...but i've totally been there...|`|UGHrvNn3aa	you can "put Out" when you want to. don't get caught up in time frames. that can really piss a guy off and make him then only be in it for the sex. then once he get the booty hes gone. <br>  <br>  so just do what you want to do when you want to do it.
GBr9YngTaa	I like the missionary position (bottom). It's nice having a man control something in our lives, as I rather have him not control many other things.|`|BSqDYs1eaa	wilson my answers are not public coz i enjoy following yours , you may want to hide your answers after reading this but you seem to be enjoying this too much to do that, so if you did hide them then you would be cutting your nuse off to spite your face wouldn't you, but go ahead if you want to.

w8gBWpKTaa	Lie until you can replace the laptop? If you can replace it.. <br>  Apart from that, your just gonna have to own up mate. He'll still love you :)<br>  and if he reacts badly.. try and think of a time when he did something similar. Help him put himself in your shoes aye.<br>  Just try not to worry, these things are never as bad as you think they'll be.|`|eIWPl5yVaa	Tell the truth and face the consequence. Lying will make matters worse|`|4EWCegiRaa	Honestly is always the best policy.  He isn't going to happy your ruined his laptop but I'm sure he'll appreciate your honesty.|`|DgvDXlV0aa	Dont lie to him just tell him the truth! He will respect you more for that! IF you lie you may ruin your relationship with him forever! Just tell him the truth it was an accident!|`|492681182d7c9b1f14276670369e851baa	Don't plug it in for a start then tell him straight away and that it was an accident.<br>  <br>  He will claim off the insurance.
PmJdmMduaa	you know, the best way to break up with a person is to just do it. a lot of girls seem to get protective after sex don't they? haha. but i think you should tell her about her attitude and how you feel first and see how she reacts to it. if she's in denial, then she's in denial. let her live with that guilt for a bit. but really, if you're planning on breaking up with her, just do it. it's better to do it earlier than later when her feelings for you get stronger and stronger by the minute. i wish you the best of luck :)|`|QjP2qtSnaa	There is no easy way to break up.  The best way is to explain why and say goodbye.  This is why you need to keep it in your pants until you get to know the person, or meet somebody who realizes it's just casual sex and nothing more.|`|MQVmh5hiaa	Well I would talk to her about her attitude because that is what is bothering you the most right. So if she doesn't change you gonna have to break up with her in a gentle way and tell her why you did.|`|tRNiXtplaa	any girl you sleep with that is going to happen. anyway you do it is going to hurt regardless even if you do it in a nice way.|`|dQbF0alPaa	Well girls tend to change after they have sex with their boyfriends they start to feel insecure and think that because she already gave it up to you you might leave her so you telling you need to break up doesn't help and leads her to believe that now that she had sex with you you're going to leave her. you should try talking to her and telling her that you still wanna be with her but she needs to change but also you can help her by changing her and always being there for her as well as showing her the love you have for her...GOOD LUCK!!! Hope this helps|`|U4DxpUBTaa	It sounds liek you've already tried talking to her about it.<br>  <br>  but, she says she "doesn't want to take time"...right?<br>  well, isn't that kindda up to both of you?<br>  <br>  She can't say, no your not going to break-up with me.<br>  You just can't.<br>  <br>  <br>  I would say, try talkign to her once more, and if she doesn't change, take a break so she can settle down.<br>  <br>  There's nothing worse than an unhealthy relationship.|`|1l7tXOLgaa	o ive been in that spot before just say i want to be firends and try to let her down easy|`|2V3JZ3Wbaa	You will be hurting her no matter what you do. Next time think about the emotions of later on when you have sex with someone. Better off to wait till the right one comes along and save yourself for marriage, long run it is much better for emotions for both of you. Trust me on this one.|`|8rt7OR35aa	This is why, in most situations, sex messes up everything.<br>  <br>  You should wait.<br>  It's not imperative that you have sex now.
