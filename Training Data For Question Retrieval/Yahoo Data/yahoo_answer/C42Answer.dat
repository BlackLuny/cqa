QRvEshskaa	Guarda sono d'accordo con te...In effetti mi sono chiesta anch'io la stessa cosa:come mai non se la fosse presa con Abbate!In effetti la situazione non è chiara...La ragione di ciò va anche ricercata nel fatto che l'informazione nel nostro Paese è fortemente sviata secondo oscuri e loschi interessi di cui noi siamo tenuti allo scuro.In ogni caso credo che il problema,al di la del fatto del libro di Abbate che sarà stato probabilmente citato a suo tempo,il problema di quest'ultimo caso fosse stato quello della "gravita"dell'accusa mossa da Travaglio a Schifani(quella dell'implicazione nella mafia).In effetti la stessa Finocchiaro ha poi criticato Travaglio non per la veridicità della sua affermazione,ma più che altro per il fatto di aver citato una situazione senza esserne a corrente completamente e senza portare prove schiaccianti al riguardo (evidentemente anche il libro "I complici" sembra ver avuto attendibilità discutibile)...Su questo punto sono personalmente d'accordo in quanto forse Travaglio avrebbe dovuto considerare con più attenzione le responsabilità in merito a quanto detto.D'altra parte,però,ma ti avverto che qui mi ricollego ad una mia precisa visione politica quindi soggettiva,io penso che quell'affermazione,per quanto rischiosa,molto probabilmente corrisponda a verità e sia andata a disturbare l'ennesimo scheletro nell'armadio come tanti camuffatto a tal punto da far rigirare la frittata...Tanto polverone non avrebbe avuto senso se non ci fosse stato effettivamente qualcosa di più serio dietro...Sai come si dice:"la cosiddetta coda di paglia"per intenderci...|`|28ea2fc06015a7e0096a3636fabb769daa	<a href="http://www.beppegrillo.it/" rel="nofollow">http://www.beppegrillo.it/</a><br>  <br>  qui in poche righe (e anche nel filmato) grillo è molto chiaro sulla questione...<br>  la cosa scandalosa è che i giornalisti non abbiamo mai parlato delle frequentazioni mafiose del presidente del senato<br>  ma tanto a nessuno frega nulla<br>  in un paese di decelebrati non si può pretendere di parlare di altro che dei rigori non dati la domenica|`|fNjOGo5paa	in Italia ci sono pochissime persone che leggono libri, figuriamoci i libri di Abbate e Gomez. denunciare Abbate avrebbe quindi attirata l' attenzione su una cosa sfuggita alla stragrande maggioranza del pubblico, mentre l' intervento di Travaglio alla trasmissione di Fazio Fabio, alle ore 21.00 del Sabato sera, sulla terza rete nazionale, è stato visto da milioni di persone. non potendo denunciare quei milioni di persone, Schifani ha deciso di denunciare Travaglio (che non ha mai perso una causa per diffamazione, anzi, ha dichiarato di essere molto contento della denuncia, in tribunale si potrà finalmente fare chiarezza!).|`|jVHkTKRkaa	Travaglio ci informa che Schifani ha agganci con la mafia e i politici (soprattutto di destra, ma non solo) si arrabbiano.

O homem está sempre buscando ser feliz e nesta busca, escolhe tantas possibilidades e estas s?o algumas delas. <br>  No meu caso, tive esta vontade de viver só, de me bastar, de me assumir, desde muito nova. Mas, na época em que isto aconteceu existiam certos tabus, a estrutura familiar e social era diferente do que é atualmente que, para que experimentasse isso, teria que quebrar certos elos de uma corrente que também me trariam mal-estar por amar profundamente meus pais. Analisando hoje sei que viver em família é difícil, aliás, se relacionar é uma arte em todos os níveis, quanto mais numa que era um cl? inteiro fazendo press?es e ditando as regras. Cada um queria dar opini?o e ditar o que deveria e o que era permitido.<br>  A vida passou, eu me casei, descasei. Amiguei, desamiguei. Juntei, desjuntei. Se n?o existem estes termos, desculpem, mas foi literalmente o que aconteceu, estou os inventando agora apesar de serem uma realidade muito atual.<br>  Quando houve o rompimento do último relacionamento, simplesmente entrei em um momento em que era preciso me conhecer melhor e ver o que tinha sobrado de tudo aquilo. Me esvaziar, analisar, fazer uma arruma??o e ver o que ia sobrar. Passei 5 anos só. Foi difícil, a solid?o é uma sensa??o horrível mas, a solid?o a dois é muitíssimo pior. <br>  Até o dia que tive o primeiro insight, me peguei pensando comigo mesma: "Como estou bem! Que dia maravilhosos! Como é bom estar só comigo! Que paz!"<br>  Hoje, n?o digo que queira viver só para a eternidade, mas isso é uma proposta de vida que n?o é absurda. Prefiro viver só a ter que conviver aos trancos e barrancos com alguém tendo que competir o tempo inteiro ou ceder para ter um instante de paz, lutando por meu lugar ao Sol e por respeito e dignidade. Para que alguém entre na minha vida hoje, ela vai ter que me mostrar mais do que simplesmente querer um momento de prazer. <br>  Por outro lado, mesmo achando que n?o conseguiria me manter até economicamente e tendo medo de n?o poder contar com ninguém, eu fui enfrente e consegui inverter a situa??o, que n?o era a mais c?moda e equilibrada, entrando em uma fase onde eu tor?o por mim e sei que só n?o vou conseguir o que n?o quiser ou que n?o for importante para mim.<br>  Agora, respondendo a pergunta, a idade é irrelevante, pois se a vida te fizer esta imposi??o, acredito que de uma hora para a outra n?o é a melhor surpresa. A gente tem medo do que nos é imposto por inseguran?a mas, nada que n?o se possa digerir. Literalmente, somos capazes de viver situa??es nunca imaginadas e sairmos vitoriosos, se n?o, sobreviver. <br>  Se invertermos o modo como entendemos a pergunta e nos ligarmos na "quantidade de tempo" que podemos viver sozinhos? Isso é feito desde que nascemos. Somos serem sós vivendo em comunidade. A partir do nascimento, dependemos da m?e e dos familiares mas as nossas dores, os sentimentos, as vontades... s?o só nossas. Passamos a vida a sós conosco e n?o nos damos conta disso. Por isso, e a despeito disso, o que é necessário é estarmos de bem conosco, o resto deve ser um complemento, uma satisfa??o, algo que nos leve a ser cada dia mais feliz.

E' il cap. XIII del libro di Corrado Augias, I segreti di Roma, Mondadori, 2005, <br>  <br>  Era una domenica quasi autunnale nonostante fosse il 30 di agosto di quel 1970. La polizia arrivò a via Puccini 9, al quartiere Pinciano di Roma, verso le 22 di sera e nello studio del lussuoso appartamento trovò tre cadaveri: quello del marchese Camillo, quello di sua moglie Anna e quello del venticinquenne Massimo.<br>  Il marchese Camillo aveva sposato Anna in seconde nozze ed aveva già una figlia- Annamaria -avuta dalla precedente moglie Letizia.<br>  La dinamica e il movente del delitto furono ricostruiti grazie al diario del marchese. In pratica, Camillo era affetto da "voyerismo" e gioiva nell'osservare la moglie posseduta da altri uomini. <br>  Questi altri uomini erano in genere soldatini 'agganciati' all'aeroporto o alla stazione ferroviaria ed adeguatamente compensati. <br>  Dopo molti anni di condiscendenza, Anna iniziò a 'farlo di nascosto'. In pratica si era innamorata di Massimo, molto più giovane di lei, con il quale progettava di cambiar vita. <br>  La cosa faceva imbestialiere il marchese Massimo che, quel giorno, uccise gli amanti a fucilate e dopo si tolse la vita. <br>  <br>  Il marchese Camillo era nato ricchissimo e cresciuto in una famiglia di antico lignaggio. Il suo omonimo antenato aveva sposato Luisa Amman, una donna travolgente, che aveva fatto perdere la testa a gente come Marinetti, Cocteau ma soprattutto D'annunzio con il quale ebbe un rapporto che durò una decina d'anni. <br>  Tutto questo prologo per arrivare alla 'causa' cioè al processo che si svolse su iniziativa dei parenti di Anna che impugnarono il testamento ""assumendo che, se la sera del 30 agosto la loro congiunta fosse morta anche un solo secondo dopo il marito, l'eredità toccherebbe a loro. Li assiste in questa delicata vicenda un certo avvocato Cesare Previti, nato a Reggio Calabria nel 1934, simpatizzante neofascista come suo padre Umberto, commercialista, buon amico della sorella di Anna. ""<br>  <br>  Le perizie, però, danno esito sfavorevole e per conseguenza tutta l'eredità passa alla figlia Annamaria che viene affidata ad un tutore in quanto minorenne.<br>  <br>  "" A quel punto l'avvocato Previti, benchè rappresenti gli interessi opposti, contatta la giovane Annamaria offrendole la propria assistenza. Sconvolta dalla tragedia, lei accetta. [.......] .Davanti al magistrato dichiara di non voler essere affidata a sua zia (unica congiunta vivente) bensì al senatore G.B. (nato a Milano nel 1904 e appartenente al partito liberale). Il pretore di Milano l'asseconda, trascurando l'articolo del Codice Civile che prevede la nomina del tutore preferibilmente tra gli ascendenti o altri prossimi parenti. Il ruolo di protutore, cioè di avvocato della minore e suo rappresentante in caso di conflitto di interessi con il tutore stesso, è esercitato dall'avvocato Previti.""<br>  <br>  L'ereditiera, scossa da tutta la vicenda si trasferisce all'estero e dopo essersi sposata vivrà stabilmente a Brasilia. Nel frattempo diventa maggiorenne e non ha più bisogno di un tutore. Fu a quel punto che il senatore G.B, nel frattempo diventato ministro in un governo Andreotti, viene nominato procuratore generale senza limitazioni e l'ex protutore Previti resta suo avvocato. <br>  <br>  ""Pressata da tasse arretrate e imposte di successione, nell'autunno 1973 Annamaria incarica l'avvocato di vendere la villa di Arcore e relativo parco con espressa esclusione di arredi, pinacoteca, biblioteca e delle circostanti proprietà terriere. Nella primavera del 1974 l'avvocato Previti le telefona a Brasilia annunciandole trionfante di aver concluso "un vero affare". Ha venduto la villa di Arcore al completo, compresi cioè quadri (tele del 400 e del 500) biblioteca (10 mila volumi antichi) arredi, un parco immenso, per 500 milioni di lire. Dal Brasile, Annamaria non si rende conto che la cifra tanto sbandierata corrisponde a quella di un buon appartamento nel centro di Milano. <br>  <br>  Pochi giorni dopo, il costruttore edile Silvio Berlusconi (è lui l'acquirente) si insedia nella suntuosa villa. Non versa subito i 500 milioni pattuiti. Pagherà in comode e lunghissime rate annuali coincidenti con le scadenze fiscali di Annamaria nonchè con le numerose pendenze verso l'Erario del suo defunto padre Camillo.<br>  Di anno in anno e fino al 1980, la proprietà di Arcore, di cui l'intraprendente palazzinaro ha preso possesso nel 1974, resterà intestata ad Annamaria, che continuerà, quindi, a pagare anche la tassa di proprietà. <br>  <br>  Nell'atto di vendita sottoscritto il 2 ottobre 1980, la villa è descritta in questi termini: "Casa di abitazione con circostanti fabbricati rurali e terreni di varia destinazione" (dal 2008 non pagherà l'ICI) <br>  Poco tempo dopo la "casa di abitazione" pagata 500 milioni a rate, sarà ritenuta dalla Cariplo garanzia sufficiente per un finanziamento di 7 miliardi e 300 milioni di lire.""|`|zDOghFwdaa	tu non devi pensare a quello ke è tuo padre o tua madre...pensa con il tuo cervello!!!<br>  cmq io stima x quel delinquente non ne ho mai avuta e mai ne avrò, ma non x questo sono comunista.io semplicemente nn lo stimo xkè è troppo delinquente e corrotto e dunque nn mi sento rappresentata da lui. non lo stimerei neanche se fosse di sinistra...|`|02fTfUZJaa	Ma tu quindi alle ultime elezioni sei stato l'artefice della sua vittoria guarda io nn ho parole !!!!!!!!

wXSKSwwvaa	Beh che Berlusconi dal 90 ad oggi abbia "conosciuto" 780 diversi magistrati è un dato di fatto che fa capire chiaramente che la magistratura, almeno in parte, è in mano alla sx. <br>  <br>  Il recente caso Forleo è la conferma: venerata fino a quando ha messo sotto inchiesta agenti della CIA e del Sismi per sequestro di persona ( il capo terrorista Abou Omar), è diventata l' oggetto di critiche, ingiurie, diffamazioni, processi disciplinari, per aver fatto a D' Alema, Veltroni e Fassino nel caso UNIPOL quello che altri magistrati regolarmente fanno impunemente ( e per me giustamente ) nei confronti di Berlusconi. <br>  <br>  Oltre a quello mi viene in mente un certo Dossier Mitrokin dove per farlo insabbiare si è ricorso anche all' omicidio del testimone ex spia del KGB che doveva confermare i finanziamenti sovietici ai comunisti per fomentare la rivoluzione comunista<br>  <br>  Cmq diciamocelo... Berlusconi si ta parando il pòpò con le nuove leggi ad personam ma nn possiamo accusarlo di più di quella sx che negli anni 90 cercò con mani pulite di far piazza pulita della concorrenza. <br>  Infatti nn ricordo un solo indagato di sx e credo che chiunque abbia senno, sia esso a dx o a sx, possa credere che il marcio era da una sola parte<br>  <br>  Cmq che si voglia farlo passare per santo o per nn colpevole perchè nn condannato in sentenza definitiva... facile togliere leggi che ti farebbero fare almeno 10 anni di galera e poi dire " sono stato assolto perchè il fatto nn costituisce reato"<br>  <br>  Dai su nn pigliamoci in giro...|`|9xTA4pCSaa	E Berlusconi cosa ha da nascondere?

Grillo:<br>  <br>  “Caro Beppe,<br>  ci sono momenti nella vita delle nazioni in cui i cittadini devono fare delle scelte. Momenti in cui non si può più fare finta di niente e continuare a credere che, in fondo, nulla veramente cambierà. Le leggi che continuamente vengono proposte dal nuovo Governo sono un attentato alla democrazia. Se passano, vincerà il regime e perderà, per un tempo indefinito, la democrazia. Non c’è bisogno dell’esercito per togliere la libertà ai cittadini. E’ sufficiente manipolare l’informazione e, grazie a questa, farsi eleggere in Parlamento. Quindi legiferare contro la Costituzione, contro l’indipendenza della magistratura, contro la sicurezza dei cittadini, contro la libera informazione. Una legge dopo l’altra.<br>  Cosa distingue un primo ministro di una democrazia da un dittatore? Il vero tratto distintivo è l’impunità assoluta del dittatore. Quando Silvio Berlusconi l’avrà ottenuta l’Italia sarà, a tutti gli effetti, una dittatura. Sorprende come opinionisti autorevoli abbiano potuto accreditare Silvio Berlusconi di qualità di statista e come una parte della stessa opposizione abbia creduto di poter avviare con lui le riforme istituzionali. La storia di Berlusconi parla per lui. I suoi innumerevoli processi, la condanna per corruzione giudiziaria del suo avvocato Cesare Previti per la Mondadori, la sua appartenenza alla P2, l’occupazione abusiva delle frequenze di Rete4. L’elenco è interminabile come i danni subiti a causa sua dal nostro Paese. Mi riferisco soprattutto allo spegnersi della coscienza civica, della morale, dell’etica. All’esempio devastante che Berlusconi ha offerto alla nazione e alle giovani generazioni in quasi venti anni, un esempio aggravato dalla sua impunità. Una situazione simile a quella dei ragazzi nei paesi del Sud che ammirano il camorrista o il mafioso locale.<br>  Il Consiglio dei ministri di oggi, 27 giugno 2008, ha approvato il DDL per garantire l’impunità alle prime cariche dello Stato durante l’esercizio del loro mandato, che diventano quindi più uguali degli altri cittadini di fronte alla legge. Nelle scorse settimane sono state presentate dal Governo leggi che definire vergogna è insufficiente. E’ più corretto chiamarle eversive e criminali in quanto minano le basi dello Stato e favoriscono i delinquenti.<br>  La sospensione dei processi per un anno serve a evitare la possibile condanna di Berlusconi al processo Mills di Milano. Altri centomila processi saranno bloccati per reati che vanno dallo stupro, alla truffa, al rapimento di minore. La sicurezza dei cittadini, tanto sbandierata in campagna elettorale da Berlusconi e dalla Lega, è sacrificata all’interesse del presidente del Consiglio. Il divieto di pubblicare le intercettazioni una volta depositate in tribunale a disposizione delle parti, e quindi di fatto già pubbliche, impedirebbe di venire a sapere di Parmalat o dei furbetti del quartierino. Il giornalista che pubblicasse le intercettazioni finirebbe in carcere, il suo editore chiuderebbe e chi ha compiuto il crimine non dovrebbe rispondere all’opinione pubblica. Con questa legge, negli Stati Uniti non ci sarebbe stato il Watergate e Nixon non avrebbe rassegnato le dimissioni. L’Italia dei Valori proporrà un grappolo di referendum per l’abrogazione di queste leggi contro la democrazia, se necessario promuoverà azioni di disobbedienza civile come la pubblicazione degli atti giudiziari. Nessuno può più rimanere a guardare.<br>  L’otto luglio a Roma dalle ore 18:00 in Piazza Navona, in contemporanea con l’iter di approvazione della legge sulle intercettazioni, l’Italia dei Valori insieme a esponenti della società civile ha indetto una manifestazione per la libertà di espressione e per la giustizia.” Antonio Di Pietro<br>  --------------------------<br>  L'ascesa al potere della cricca che ci ritroviamo oggi è frutto di tanta, tanta ignoranza .

pl66LArqaa	Io voto Lega da sempre, soprattutto per il federalismo fiscale quindi spero proprio che venga attuato...se ciò non dovesse accadere penso che sicuramente la Lega toglierà la fiducia a questo governo (come ha già dimostrato in più di un'occasione...sono al governo in una coalizione ma se vogliono votare contro votano contro...).<br>  A quelli che dicono che la Lega è un controsenso perchè è stata d'accordo con l'abolizione dell'ICI (in quanto è la tassa federalista per eccellenza), vorrei ricordare che la Lega è sempre stata CONTRO questa tassa perchè è una tassa patrimoniale che colpisce soprattutto i sacrifici di una vita per avere una casa di proprietà, quindi la sua abolizione la Lega l'ha fortemente caldeggiata proprio perchè la riteneva una tassa ingiusta per i cittadini. Ciao.|`|1SUzKKP8aa	Non molti lo sanno, il federalismo fiscale è stato introdotto dal governo di centrosinistra con la riforma dell'articolo 119 della Costituzione. <br>  <br>  Non solo le Regioni, ma anche  Comuni, Province e Città metropolitane, hanno già da 8 anni autonomia finanziaria, sia per le entrate che per le spese;<br>  <br>  A tali enti sono attribuiti tributi ed entrate proprie, che si precisa essere “stabiliti ed applicati in armonia con la Costituzione e secondo i principi di coordinamento della finanza pubblica e del sistema tributario”; vengono anche<br>  attribuite compartecipazioni al gettito di tributi erariali riferibili al rispettivo territorio. Vengono poi introdotti un fondo perequativo  ancorato alla capacità fiscale per abitante e la possibilità per lo Stato di interventire con risorse risorse aggiuntive e interventi speciali per fini ulteriori.<br>  <br>  Ma prima ancora, nel 2000 era stato emanato un Decreto legislativo (il 56) in materia di federalismo ficale, sopprimendo i trasferimenti erariali dallo Stato alle regioni, istituendo la compartecipazione regionale all'IVA e alle tasse sulla benzina, le addizionali regionali all'IRPEF; e destinando l'IRAP esclusivamente alle Regioni.<br>  <br>  Grazie al federalismo fiscale  Formiconi potè tamponare il buco di 2000 mld di vecchie lire della sanità lombarda privatizzata, grazie all'alto gettito dell'IVA di cui disponeva (il più alto dell'Italia).<br>  <br>  Già oggi le Regioni virtuose e più produttive sono premiate da maggiori gettiti fiscali propri, con cui finanziano migliori servizi e migliore assistenza sanitaria e sociale; quelle meno virtuose si attaccano, per ora, al fondo perequativo e ad interventi straordinari, però rigidamente subordinati ad interventi di razionalizzazione della spesa e a precisi piani di rientro.<br>  <br>  Non credo ci sia da fare tanto di più e non so se Berlusconi abbia tanta voglia di farlo avendo, nel suo partito, tanti nostalgici della Cassa per il Mezzogiorno.|`|H5rbR4mqaa	Sono d'accordissima con te!! Mi auguro davvero che lo facciano! Anche perchè, la legge è già pronta! .. poi si sa che Bossi farà cadere il governo se non viene attuato!

No job is worth that amount of stress. If I were you, I would file a formal complaint about this woman with your HR office, and if possible get others who have had similar problems with her to do the same. If she keeps it up, you all could quite possibly sue her for creating a hostile work environment. And even if she owns this company, you can still file a complaint because there is a certain standard that should be upheld in the workplace. Good Luck!|`|G01hkXhPaa	If you have another job lined up for you, even if it's 50 cents less than what you're getting now, take it. I think it would be better than suffering from stress and sickness from the job that's causing it now. And when you get that new job, keep looking for something better /or find something to help substitue the extra earnings you'll need. For example, donating plasma. Here where I live, there are places where a person can donate plasma for $20+ dollars a week.

fa38e842848a4d4d0e66c24701940524aa	There are a lot of variables.  What's in your favor is the size of the Army, most people in my OCS class got their first pick.  The few that didn't were asking for the very small branches that are extremely selective, such as Military Intelligence (consider all the jokes about that as "told"). <br>  <br>  One thing you can do to improve your odds is to excel in OCS.  Of course, that's a function in part of your own natural ability to Lead, and you either can or you can't.  <br>  <br>  Duty stations are a bit more difficult to choose.  Generally speaking, you can expect "everyone" to want what you want, so they're going to pick on the basis of some things you probably can't control. For example, say you want to be assigned to the 82d Airborne, and they only need two from your class.  If two of your classmates came from the 82d and want to go back, and you entered right from college, you're probably not going to the 82d.  If there's one slot and it's you and one other guy off the street, but he happens to "know somebody" with pull (Senator, Division Commander, etc), he'll get it. <br>  <br>  The bottom line is that the Army will always let you express your preferences on that kind of thing, but don't expect to get what you want. |`|6hgiRL7Vaa	You can put down your preferences on your dream sheet. But you will go where the military needs you.|`|523RWqz6aa	you pick either,  air, law or ground... they after your done ocs.. you give them a list of jjobs that you would do.. they look at your list.. and try to give you the job you want, based upon the amount of people they need for that job.. say your first pick is computer tech... and there is no opening.. iif your second choice is infantry, and theres an opening.. you get infantry|`|iOys3vneaa	officers dont have an MOS, they have a branch. they get to put down their top choices, but ultimately it is up to the powers that be to decide where they go. station of choice is something that can be put into an initial contract, but after OCS their station has already been decided.|`|Esa65dDXaa	nope

6LTaPSaeaa	In the Army they did have a commissioning program that allowed you to go to OCS with I believe 60 SHs of credit and you had to finish your BA/BS if you wanted to go past Captain.  However, I don't think it is still an Active program.  I have worked for officers that went through it a couple years ago, but my own inquiries into the subject have been met with confused looks.  It was called the Early Commissioning Program.<br>  <br>  Every other branch requires a BS/BA for OCS/OTS|`|0dEMGUIJaa	Yes, you have to have a bachelors before you can be an officer.

Cannabis is safer, less addictive, and responsible for far fewer deaths and accidents than alcohol.  The only reason drugs are connected to terrorist groups is BECAUSE they're illegal.  It's the same thing that happened during alcohol prohibition; making a substance illegal does not reduce demand but it makes supply dependent on a black market economy which is necessarily run by criminals and free from any regulation.  It's this mentality of 'drugs are bad, therefore they should be illegal' that is responsible for the majority of organised crime today.  <br>  <br>  If you look at the problems associated with drugs, none of them are solved and most of them are exacerbated by prohibition.  Face it, the war on drugs is over and the good guys lost.  <br>  <br>  Also, don't you think it's a little hypocritical to say how great it is that athletes are treated no differently, and in your next sentence to say that Phelps should be made an example?  Seems like you think he should get a harsher sentence for being an athlete (or else you think everyone who uses cannabis should be locked up, which is utter nonsense).  How is that 'no different'?|`|9XJLlPaEaa	It's not linked to terrorism, that's just propaganda, and it's no more dangerous than alcohol. <br>  <br>  Also, no one goes to jail for smoking pot, because smoking pot is not illegal, it's the actual possession that is illegal. <br>  <br>  And btw, America is not the most free country, by far.|`|ySSU0JuLaa	dude he only did it one time and a bunch of important ppl smoke weed but they hide it you go to jail if you get cot|`|nmbbG0vdaa	nope|`|HG0742a9aa	i wouldn't hold my breath for the judicial system to punish those in the public eye

Not the September 11th attacks, which tragedies democracy could survive, but the aftermath, in which a carefully trained public had their grief cynically manipulated by enemies domestic.  Indefinite detentions, USA PATRIOT Act, appalling self-censorship.  Everyone dancing in lockstep to “God Bless America.”  A weird choice of anthem for a secular democratic republic, weirder still because Americans cannot agree on the definitions of any of those words, “God”, “bless” or “America”.  United we misunderstand?  No, just diversity, democracy.  But it requires curiosity, (or annoying essayists like me), to ask questions.  And more questions.  Good questions are critical to good democracy. The pretense of questions, such as the pseudo-debates and shouting matches that pass for critical analysis on TV, continued, as did the epithets framed as questions yelled at dissenters, but these are forms that stop productive discussions.   Questions were frightened out of a lot of folks after 9-11.  And when Bush sent bombs and mines (cluster bombs) and food packets (that looked a lot like the unexploded mines, oops) all over Afghanistan, good Americans were reminded that their proper role was to cheer.  That is, “support the troops.”<br>  <br>  Whatever disagreement you have with a US military action, you must shut up and “support our troops” once the action begins.  This is a recipe for unchecked imperialist adventuring.  This is a recipe for killing the conscience of the citizen.  This is the paradox of the “good German”.  This is self-censoring in the face of cognitive dissonance that can only be allayed by integrating the values of the empire - loving Big Brother.  Many people who are ambivalent about the present war are using the mantra “support our troops” as the lever to their troubled consciences.  These folks say, “Let’s just hope they do their job well and don’t get hurt and come home soon.”  As if examining “their job”, which is, after all, massive destruction of people and property, is uncouth.  As if we are so worried about the cognitive dissonance the soldiers may be experiencing that we must pretend we have no doubts about their mission, lest they doubt themselves and suffer useless pangs of conscience.  There is a distinctive combination of arguments that are held, however loosely examined, by many in the US: the coalition troops are at once skilled professionals who volunteered for the job and feckless children who need to be protected from their conscience.<br>  <br>  I shall continue to ask annoying questions, of the rulers and of the ruled, with the ultimate question underlying all of them: how may we be free?  I shall continue to remind my fellow workers that we are the troops that that secure and defend our liberties.  Soldiers overseas have rarely, if ever, been the troops who have gained or guaranteed our rights.  As is to be expected in a constitutional republic, the troops who have defended me have been in the courtrooms and on the picket lines.|`|IWlPfk1raa	I agree that the idea of America is the best ideology.

LzPhdri5aa	13. Much like the war on Drugs, the consequences to society for enforcing it are too high.<br>  <br>  A government must have a justification for taking an action.  If the reason that government can outlaw abortion is "God told me to" then we are living in a theocracy, not a democracy.  And at that point, you have a society like Iran where a group of clerics decides what is right or wrong.  <br>  <br>  If the reason that government outlaws abortion is, "The embryo is defined as a human life just as important or equal to anyone that has been born," then you must follow that to its logical conclusion.<br>  <br>  Women who endanger embryos are potentially guilty of manslaughter.<br>  <br>  Embryos are very fragile.<br>  <br>  Therefore anything that might cause a miscarriage is manslaughter.  You call this position extreme, and yet look at the war on Drugs.<br>  <br>  Police departments routinely confiscate property without due process and use it to fund their law enforcement efforts.  Rural districts with prisons routinely  call for laws asking for tougher punishments on crime to keep their prisons full.<br>  <br>  Therefore if an embryo is given full rights equal to a human being, 50% of the population will essentially become enslaved by those interests that will gain materially by punishing women.<br>  <br>  So which is more of a crime?

Desperate to end a pregnancy they used unsterile instruments and they ran the risk of uterine punctures that required emergency hysterectomies and infections that rendered them sterile.  That's a lot for  a young girl or a married woman with all the family she and her husband can handle.<br>  You cannot stop it, you can only make it safe.<br>  So everyone who would ban it, or make it illegal would be participating in the kind of horrors than went on pre-Roe v. Wade.  Doctors supported that because they were tired of seeing so many women and girls senselessly deprived of ever having a child, because they could not support or care for one at that time in their lives.<br>  I am more concerned about the health and welfare of existing humans and I believe that a woman has the right to determine what happens to her body, with the consultation of a doctor, and not a legal committee.|`|8eeee84248737295c60d88565ceb0559aa	You have still yet to clarify why the state/government is in the operating room.<br>  <br>  The right to privacy is how abortion is legal.  You have to overcome the "right to privacy" to do anything.<br>  <br>  Its like the old sodomy laws.  There was a lawsuit and a judge said (something to the effect of) "when trying to determine when Mr/Mrs were engaging in sodomy, I asked what is the state of Georgia doing in Mr/Mrs bedroom"<br>  <br>  hence the repealing of those laws in many states.|`|DOQ4bZQuaa	Remember, abortion is a modern extension of eugenics. In eugenics, individuals with "undesirable" traits or of "undesirable" heritage are either, killed, sterilized or otherwise prevented from reproducing. <br>  <br>  Abortion labels the embryo, fetus, zygote,baby etc. as undesirable and as subsequently killed. Often they(the unborn) are considered undesirable because the biological parents are "not ready," or the living conditions are "not suitable". Another "justification" for the abortion may be that the fetus is production of rape or incest, in which case the unborn child is considered a freak of nature. <br>  <br>  <br>  In each of these cases, the unborn child is being viewed as undesirable and thus is given a death sentence. Add this to the fact that most abortions are performed on women from ethnic minorities or in poorer neighborhoods. The result is a society that turns a blind eye to the killing of poor, minority, "freakish", and unwanted unborn children. This is eugenics. The killing (or sterilization) of individuals that the "whole" consider to be inferior.<br>  <br>  Edit: Joe S,<br>  <br>      Joe, I find your answer to be very concise and thorough. However, I have a few objections to a few of your arguments.<br>  <br>  1. "However, it is also an invasive intruder on the most sacred property that a woman owns - her body"<br>    <br>        Your designation of an unborn child as an "invasive intruder" is inherently flawed. All pregnancies jeopardize the health of the mother to some extent, and most mothers experience much discomfort. This is common in pregnancies. If most (if not all) pregnancies in some way hurt the mother, when is the child an intruder and when is it welcome? If all unborn babies who in some way jeopardize the health and comfort of the mother are invasive, then we were all "invasive" in the womb. <br>        Secondly the child is a product of reproduction, a process that is natural. The child is genetically %50 the mother and %50 the father. How can something that is a product of the woman's own genes be "invasive". It did not simply appear there, it arrived as a result of the reproductive act. Is the unborn child truly invasive if it is the result of a process of nature. <br>      <br>          The self defense principal does not apply to the unborn. Killing someone in self defense is existentially different from aborting a baby that hurts (or endangers the life of) the mother. When someone endangers another's life, there are choices involved. One has made a choice that directly or indirectly is endangering the life of another. For the endangered to be justified in killing the person doing them harm, there must be no alternative but to kill. The unborn have made no choices. What is happening to the mother as a result of the pregnancy is caused not by the baby (the baby is not trying to kill the mother) but by the complications of the reproductive process. Should a baby that has no input into the situation be sacrificed because of bad circumstance?<br>        <br>           This designation as "invasive" is not derived but arbitrarily assigned, much like in your argument about whether life begins at conception or at birth. Such arbitrary designations are not valid in any ethical discussion. The woman (or society, by extension) designates the unborn child as invasive in an arbitrary fashion (aka when they wish to define it as such).<br>         <br>  2."abortion foes also usually give way when the pregnancy was completely outside of the control of the mother via rape"<br>  <br>         Rape and incest are truly terrible acts. They occur when the woman's rights have been violated and she is left with no choice in the matter (as incest and rape are forced by nature). However, the loss of the woman's rights in this act does not give her the right to turn around and take away the rights of the unborn baby alltogether via abortion. I agree that becoming pregnant as a result of rape or incest must be truly stressfull, but being extremely stressed is no excuse to end another's life (this does not satisfy the self-defence principle). <br>         Unborn children of rape or incest are often seen as freakish in the eyes of society. This makes them unwanted and as a result we decide that they must be aborted becasue they could not possibly grow up as normal children. This is unfair; it is presuming that the future of the child will be negative and therefore "justifying" its termination. Human beings do not have the right to simply assume what another's future will be and terminate them if their assumed future does not sound good. Even if a child is a product of rape or incest, does the child not have the right to live? Who knows what good a child might do, should we not give the child a chance to make his own future.<br>  <br>  3."Remember, the right to own her body should be given great weight"<br>  <br>       I agree. However, is it not possible for someone to use their body in order to harm others? This certainly happens in society as domestic violence. People who use their bodies to hurt others are wrong (the law waould suggest that american society agrees with this).Therefore we do not have the right to do whatever we want with our bodies.  <br>  <br>       What about using things inside the body? Drug mules, (often females) hide drugs in their bodies. This is bad for society and they waive their rights to bodily privacy when the use them in the drug trade. Is stopping a drug mule from doing this an injustice? No.<br>  <br>        Just becasue the fetus is inside the woman's body does not mean she has the right to have it killed. It is a life and deserves to live. Bodily rights do not take precedence over the right for another to live. Bodily rights deserve some weight, but not when such use of the body results in the death of another human being.|`|HcFHLGIaaa	Abortion at will is legal and will stay that way.

I know several '6th abortion, don't want my tubes tied because I haven't had a baby yet' Nellies who felt nothing at all.<br>  <br>  Anyhow, I am extremely pro- pro- birth control of all kinds....<br>  <br>  Lastly, we all need to teach and remember that sex is meant as reproduction of the species...to act like a resulting pregnancy is abnormal is madness!|`|PG2gd1tOaa	I have never understood how many men I have seen believe too that abortion is strictly the womans right when it is the mens babies that are being terminated. I have also never understood why men have no rights in deciding to terminate the baby yet many states still require a wifes permission for the man to have a vasectomy and how can any parent that is Pro-choice think it is okay for their 13 year old daughter to have an abortion without their permission yet school can not dispense an aspirin to a child without the parents permission.

You are killing women whom you say would have equal right to choose. You imply that your sexual actions deserve no consequence. For those who are raped, having an abortion shows that the means of conception is grounds for termination--I don't want you therefore my desires are more important than your existence. You wouldn't exist today if your mother had aborted you because she didn't think you'd have a decent life...so do you not have a decent life and would agree with her now? If you argue that you shouldn't bear full responsibility for something that you didn't do on your own by carrying the child 9 months, does that mean you can't give the father the responsibility to rear the child for 18 years?|`|5syj6Uzaaa	I think that any defense of abortion must begin with the right of a woman to control what happens to her body.  Other arguments leave ambiguities.  For instance, consider the argument that it is not truly human (#12 on your list).  Arguing this leaves the defender of abortion in a position of defining an arbitrary time at which the little life becomes human.  At some point, the child is born.  Rights are pretty universally granted to the born child.  But it seems a stretch to claim that there is any difference between the several days before birth and the moment before and after.<br>  <br>  The central question is about the rights of living things.  To answer this question, we must admit to a wide spectrum.  Microbes are undeniably living.  However, we ruthlessly routinely kill them without regret.  Even if we discover that some of them may be harmless, no one pushes for "microbe rights".<br>  <br>  On the other end of the spectrum, we consider it a serious matter to kill a full born adult.  Doing so brings severe consequences unless it can be demonstrated that the killing was in self-defense.<br>  <br>  Going even further on the spectrum, killing an infant is even more extreme.  I can imagine that few would grant any notion of self-defense against a defenseless infant.  Notably though, some of the arguments in defense of abortion should logically lead toward an acceptance of killing an infant.<br>  <br>  Finally, going to the case of a fetus, it is somewhere between a microbe and an infant.  It is much more than a microbe.  It has the grand potential to become a fully developed human.  As such, strong consideration should be given to protecting it.  However, it is also an invasive intruder on the most sacred property that a woman owns - her body.  It may cause severe discomfort and even sickness - much worse than many microbes.  In some cases, it may even threaten the life of the woman.  We all recognize that the self-defense principle takes over for many abortion foes here.<br>  <br>  Considering the means of pregnancy is pertinent.  Even when the fetus does threaten the mother's life, abortion foes also usually give way when the pregnancy was completely outside of the control of the mother via rape.  We are left now only with the case in which the woman willingly engaged in sex and became pregnant [1].  What are her obligations to the child?<br>  <br>  Here, we must admit all sorts of sticky issues.  We may liken the pregnancy to a case of inviting a person into your home.  Just because the initial invitation was voluntary, we can not assume that the person must be perpetually welcome.  At some point, following generally accepted property rights, you have a right to dispel the person from your home.  Of course, doing so is not likely to result in the death of your former guest [2].<br>  <br>  We could continue thinking of issues, but this is enough for me to stop.  I will offer a reason that sways me to lean pro-choice.  Since the matter is so ambiguous and complex, it should not be a matter of law.  Law is appropriate when there is general consent on a matter.  There simply is none here.  That certainly does not mean that you should accept abortion is right and good.  Indeed, I think that it is not!<br>  <br>  Life is sacred.  A mother should recognize a sense of obligation to her unborn child.  However, I will recognize another statement on your list without granting it a legitimate statement in defense of abortion.  Whatever the law, some people will seek abortions.  It serves us well to understand the plight of women who are driven to abortions.  Remember, the right to own her body should be given great weight.  While I have no doubt that some women are irresponsible and selfish, there are myriad other circumstances that might elicit compassion even if we oppose abortion.<br>  <br>  And here is where I wrap up with a final say on defense of abortion.  One need not defend abortion itself while opposing its criminalization.  Getting personally involved in such difficult circumstances is key.  Making sweeping legal decrees where there is no consensus is a sure recipe for a black market and all of its evils.  Instead, let's become involved in the lives of women who are in trouble.  Let's plead with them, while having compassion for their circumstances, to respect the sanctity of life.  Becoming personally involved, we may be able to resolve concerns that may lead a woman to want to kill her unborn child.<br>  <br>  No, I do not defend abortion.  It is ugly, maybe even wrong.  But I do defend the right of a woman to own her body.  I may sincerely exert my energy to convince her to bear her child, but I will not claim ownership of her body!|`|CtYqMs5Paa	The only reason I feel abortion is warranted is when medically the risk is higher of losing both mother and fetus as in the case of ectopic pregnancies.  Why lose two (or potentially two) people when you can save one that has another chance to procreate at a later time if they so choose.|`|GJKWgx0Paa	I am pro-privacy.<br>  <br>  In my family, every possible response to an unplanned pregnancy has been tried.  Abortion was tried.  One child was stillborn.  Giving up the baby was tried.  Raising a child, both married and unmarried, was tried.  Marrying the child's father was tried.  Marrying a different man while raising the child was tried.  And for all I know [haven't been told] a distraught pregnant woman tried to commit suicide.<br>  <br>  In every case, the mother has/had unhealed emotional wounds for years and decades afterward, no matter what decision she made.  Psych therapy didn't seem very effective for those who tried it.<br>  <br>  Afaik, no sperm donor or father had anything like the emotional trauma the mother got.<br>  <br>  Thus, my experience is that, no matter what decision she makes, the woman with an unplanned pregnancy will carry a heavy load of emotional baggage -- and apparently for all her days.<br>  <br>  <br>  It follows that I have no valid reason to butt in with any judgment, no matter what decision the mother makes.  She's going to deeply regret her choice, no matter what it is.<br>  <br>  All I can do is offer what little support I can [and I'm a fair dinkum amateur psych] while trying to hold her future mental health in my prayers.|`|cACH0uWwaa	I am pro-choice, in that I believe a Woman has the right to decide whether or not she is going to have sex.  If she choose to have sex and then gets pregnant she already made her decision and now she and the partner need to take adult responsibility for deciding to participate in an adult act.<br>  <br>  To the poster that believes that a fetus is not alive until it has a heartbeat.  Well the heart starts to beat at approx. 5 weeks, so do you still condone an abortion after that fact?<br>  <br>  To the poster that does not believe a fetus has an ego or will to live.  You obviously have never seen an abortion film that shows the fetus frantically trying to get away from the instruments.  I have held a 14 week fetus in my hands for over 2 hours while it struggled to live and watched as it grasped my little finger with its hand!  It struggled so hard to live and I was pro abortion until this happened and saw how valiantly this baby fought to live.  No more can I condone this practice.  All Women have a choice and that choice is whether or not they are ready to have sex.  If they feel they are ready then they must also be ready to pay the consequences of their actions!|`|meVH73dOaa	Abortion is murder, period.

The government already tells us we can’t kill another human being. They already took away that freedom. The loophole here is that we don’t classify unborn children as “human” until they are born. This is, unless you kill the mother, then they charge you with 2 counts of murder, her and her child. Why is it only murder if you kill an unborn child? Why isn’t it if the mother chooses to? Why doesn’t the father have any say in what happens to a child that’s half his? He’s legally responsible for the child, but has no legal rights whatsoever regarding what happens to it? Is that fair?|`|Gx1ewGOFaa	The most important life to protect and save is that of the woman's. I would defend abortion to the death - I think it's such a non-negotiable right that needs to be upheld.

During the Nixon/Ford years, he was Assistant Chief of Staff.  When Ford left office, so too did Mr. Cheney.  I suspect you would have rather he collected welfare than find work.

McCain got almost exactly the typical "bounce" in the polls after the Republican convention.  His poll numbers declined after that, just as they do for every candidate once the effect of the "bounce" fades.<br>  <br>  Obama won by about the same margin by which he led in the polls four months before the election.  The major factor was George W Bush, who was and is (deservedly) the most unpopular president since polls were invented.|`|U60KCkdcaa	Why McCain lost is his moderate stance on the economy by not fighting the bailout. Although his tax plan was good, Obama lied to American people and promised everyone a tax cut. <br>  <br>  Furthermore, he did not go after Obama early enough on the Wright issue, and shunted many valuable supporters that could have helped him out in some the red states that flipped. He did not energize the republican base as people thought he might with Sarah Palin on the ticket. Even though she helped him out, Palin was kept from the media to respond to any and all false allegations that were made against her.<br>  <br>  Final note to why McCain lost, he was not picked by the republican conservative base.|`|b3640707e483a3b444b16b298a3378aeaa	1.

George Bush made some mistakes during his Presidency, and I never agreed with everything he did or said. <br>  <br>  But the Media made sure to do everything they could to discredit the man and his position. They did since the beginnig of Bush's first term in 2000. The level of personal attacks against him, many of which were proven to be lies very never retracted or ceased. The media also made sure to assist the Democratic Leadership in blaming President Bush for their own failures. Remember that Congress, led by Nancy Pelosi has a lower approval rating than does George Bush.<br>  <br>  Agreed, a Republican was going to have a hard time winning, and that is why the Democrats and  the media made sure John McCain was the Republican Nominee. He was not going to win. <br>  <br>  The reason Sarah Palin was attacked so hard and viciously is because Democrats and the media was afraid she might actually cause McCain to win. Contrary to media reports, Sarah Palin was and is better qualified to be President of the United States than John McCain, Barack Obama, or Joe Biden, (who dropped out after New Hampshire, because no one vote for him in the Primaries).|`|J0zC5T3saa	Senator Obama advocated bombing Pakistan, sending more troops to Afg. and voted on numerous bills favoring corporations which caused this economic mess in the first place..<br>  <br>  On top of that he voted to fund the war in Iraq, voted to reauthorize the patriot act<br>  <br>  I know you Obama cultists are brainwashed by the media thinking he's some kind fo progressive but he isn't.. we've suffered with him as our senator here and the rest of the country is about to know<br>  <br>  Oh and before you trash for me being a conservatie I voted Hillary<br>  |`|182UIiCwaa	Ignorance is right, the simple fact that he got more the vote than the approval rating of the incumbent President is all short of a miracle.

However 80% of abortions performed are just for convenience sake.  <br>  <br>  I saw the video of a woman who survived an abortion.

Now that I have removed the allergen from my diet, I see on a much less compulsive, or anxious basis.<br>  <br>  Ton treat an institution of motherhood, with such callus as to kill every baby, is no accident. A responsible accident. I chose to have unprotected sex, because my government will pay for me and my child, born from a mother who chooses not to work.<br>  <br>  Me and my wife have chosen not to have a baby. So we do not. I feel to be responsible enough to bring a child into this world, does not mean a saturday at the ritz, on moneys meant to be spent on your childs food.<br>  <br>  I think I have a little more right to speak on the tropic than many. I am adopted. I am autistic recovered gluten intolerant. Without medical backgrounds on my blood parents, I almost died from misdiagnosis for more than my life span. My genetics are marker with rediculous intelligence, and the cortisolic functions of a rhino.<br>  <br>  If my mother were to have taken pregnancy for something other than what it is, I would not have been here, to prove $100,000 of pure misdiagnosis, due to the "Practice of medicine", and solve it myself with a $174 dollar, 99.9% accurate genetic test, which I ordered and battled for 8 months, I could easily be dead today.<br>  <br>  I hold the HLA DQ8 genetic marker for celiac dysfunctions. Through pure physical training, I survived. These genes are said to be in nearly everyone in the USA. HLA DQ2 and my HLA DQ8.<br>  <br>  Why do I think this? I do not answer without the best resource Imaginable. Dr. Alessio Fasano at University of Maryland, instituted in his home country, genetic testing to be done on every child before entering gradeschool, to illeviate possible symptons of ADHD and OCD tendancies before school, by just removing the allergen. Wheat, malt and barley gluten protein.<br>  <br>  Dr Fasano has the only genetic platform on which to judge with no desciminitory test group. This platform is all of Italy.<br>  <br>  So if my mother was your friend, I would not have been here to answer the questions as to how we can effectively and accurately diagnose ourselves, better than the "Practice of medicine" with pure genetic science.<br>  <br>  If my mother had me aborted, My adoptive parents would not have had a child, to bring into this world.If my mother had me aborted, I would not be here to help take care of my loving wife. <br>  <br>  The responsibility of parenting has been flung into a political mess. The government has turned the responsibility of parenting, into a cash cow.<br>  <br>  Am I against abortion? Mostly so, but when the child is brought into this world by an irresposible 16 year old, that is probably eating to much wheat gluten, and I have not the money to bring a child into this world, and I am working class. I can even claim world class working  class, for I was a drywall taper for more than 15 years.<br>  <br>  I do not understand which people our government is now run by. I do not see which influences of any religion are allowed into the belly of the beast. We all must answer for are crimes that are done to ourselves.<br>  If we look strictly at government from an athiest standpoint, Yet allow hints of christianity, only to the point were we do not address the pure irresponsabilities exhibited by all world government. <br>  <br>  I do not see any true control over anything. In a day and age, where every person has become a wealth of information, Is this the best government we can come up with? Are we not the hardest working people , in the world? Are we feared at our shores, and considered LOCO by most of the world?<br>  <br>  If my mother, had me aborted, I would not even have typed this rant. I would not wake up every day, with the hope of making the world a better place.<br>  <br>  The most responsible member of the family should be given custody. Not the alcoholic, payed child support, just due to sexual orientation.<br>  <br>  I think abortion should be considered irresponsible. I think lying about taking birth control, to capture a man, should be a felony. <br>  <br>  I prey that we can recognize the pure sins, all of our government is enforcing, yet to every religion, all this is pure sin.<br>  <br>  I am not an overly religious type fellow. I am at peace with my maker.

As I shed much of the dogma I was indoctrinated with, being anti-abortion is not something I departed.  abortion goes against my conscience. <br>  <br>  At the point of conception there is one (barring multiple births) person that can result, and that potential for a person deserves protection.  A fetus shouldn't have the same status and rights as a "viable" person per se.  It is after all, fully reliant on and attached to another individual, but the mother should not be permitted to abort for arbitrary reasons.   Only if the mother's physical or psychological health is compromised, then induced abortion should be an option.  Otherwise, I think abortion should be illegal.  Extreme, maybe.  And all the more ironic that I empathize with even the most liberal views on abortion.|`|UhAHaOWFaa	Abortion is just legalized murder, worse of all used against the innocent!<br>  <br>  We would never do that to a criminal so why do it to an innocent unborn baby?|`|7R7e6yX5aa	horrid-another good reason not to have sex|`|fpv8IV3Haa	I am 100% against abortion

Let's just go to www.ontheissues.com and vote okay?|`|LICaZNCsaa	Barack Obama has never leveled a personal attack against McCain or Palin.  They are both trying to spread rumors he is a terrorist, a Muslim, and that he hates America.  That is playing on the paranoia they have already created with propaganda like the cover of the New Yorker featuring the Obamas dressed like Black Panthers and the propaganda Bush has spread about terrorists invading America. They are also playing on the fears of rich Whites that other groups who they can't buy and make into puppets will get power.  These rich Whites then get the poor Whites on their side by racial coding and letting them think Obama is "uppity" and thereby shows them up as "White trash." While Republicans play this type of game, Obama says that he will spend his time telling the people that McCain is ignoring the Middle Class and poor in favor of the rich.  This is an issue for the country, not the ones McCain is raising.  Obama is passionate about this because he experienced these things growing up.  When his mother was sick, she had to spend time fighting for money she was entitled to but that insurance companies had counted on not giving out (Watch Sicko by Michael Moore).  McCain believes health care should not be responsible for serving the people, but should be allowed to renege on the services it pretends to offer while the people they rob should be responsible.  Similarly, Republicans wanted wall street welfare to be for tax breaks for the wealthy, money for race car company friends, spas for manicures and petticures.  Obama tried to add incentives and breaks for the oppressed. Obama made sure to dispel myths about Ayers McCain could not say to his face.  He said that Ayers served on a committee with Obama to advocate for reforms, and was also affiliated with Reagan's former people.  Yet Palin is trying to connect Obama with actions Ayers took almost 40 years ago when Obama was about 8.  Why not arrest all the people who work with college professor Ayers, or arrest Ayers himself if knowing him is such a crime?  Obama made it clear that Ayers never coached him or taught him.  So it is not both candidates who are circulating rumors and myths.  Everything Obama has said has been about the issues, and he has had the courage to say openly and to his face.  Saying that the people do not know Obama and whispering things that are slanderous behind his back despite his open record of service as a community organizer, civil rights lawyer, teacher, and senator that placed him directly among the neediest is despicable and low.  Not to mention the fact that McCain could not even say his name.  Calling him "that one" and those he inspired "other people" when acknowleging his victory over Hillary Clinton, and refusing to look at him when addressing him shows that we are people McCain intends to leave out of his campaign.|`|AA10585364	McCain's attacks are full of lies and deception.

Only those who are very simple minded and can't see the big picture support it.<br>  <br>  First off, just look at the countries in the world that actually have a death penalty.  The vast majority are backwards third world countries, that we certainly wouldn't want to compare ourselves to.<br>  <br>  Secondly, it doesn't work as a deterrent.  The homicide rate is actually higher or just as high in states that have the death penalty than in states without it.<br>  <br>  Third, no criminal justice system is perfect.  So once you have executed someone, you cannot bring them back if you later find out that a mistake was made.<br>  <br>  Forth, it costs more to execute a person than life in prison.  Sure, you probably don't believe me, but do the research and educate yourself.<br>  <br>  Fifth, there are reasonable arguments that it can create more crime.  Let's say a bad person kidnaps, tortures, and rapes a child.  He could let the child go, but he fears the death penalty.  So he kills the child, because it's not like they can kill him twice.  By killing the child, he figures it is less likely they will testify against him.<br>  <br>  Six, since state sanctioned killing is generally only done in backwards third world countries, it makes other countries consider us backwards and unenlightened.<br>  <br>  Seven, racism.  Around 80% of people on death row are non-white minorities.  States appear to seek the death penalty disproportionately for minorities.<br>  <br>  Eight, sexism.  Women only make up 1.3% of the population of death row.  Do women only commit 1.3% of crimes?<br>  <br>  Nine, retards.  We kill retards.  To be more politically correct, we have executed people who are mentally ill, mentally retarded, and otherwise mentally impaired.|`|8EbJJ0zZaa	It doesn't work as a deterrent....but I'm ok with it....it gives families of victims some closure.....<br>  <br>  If the other guy can't explain, I'll try.....it doesn't work based on every study ever done on the subject(I will try to find links)....also on a common sense level....do you really think the guy in your story was worried about being put to death?....do you think a gang-banger, who kills a liquor store clerk is worried about the death penalty?....|`|uiGxCTMFaa	I want to answer this as a conservative. I’ll say that I am against the death penalty these days because, based on its history of use,it has sometimes been arbitrary or biased towards minorities.  I will swear by the fact that the death penalty is NOT unconstitutional!  In fact the Constitution directly points to the use of the death penalty. I would just vote against using it for personal reasons which is why we are a democratic nation. As a Christian who believes that Christ can forgive any sin, (not meaning that sin’s should go unpunished)  we should use life in prison as an alternative. People can be forgiven for the most heinous of crimes. Due to the nature of the appeals process, the death penalty is also more expensive.  If "justice" happens to make a wrong decision, is the use of the death penalty worth an innocent life lost!  I am also not pro-war, nor pro-choice!  Consistent life values!  There may be a place for the death penalty in some states, but I would not trust my states judicial system to be that perfect in its judgment.

The Constitution guarantees us the rights of life, liberty, and property.  If you wanted to talk about the Declaration, you should start your own darn question about it, smart arze.|`|9HRkwzruaa	Wait, they'd have to believe in it in order to uphold it, right?<br>  <br>  Huh.

Politicians run in whatever circle will get them what they want ... Neither party is innocent or better Americans than the other .|`|Alkn6IJYaa	They all do.<br>  <br>  Haven't you read the legislative histories of all the amendments and so on? It takes effort, but is not impossible. <br>  <br>  For example, the second amendment was seen as not an individual right, but a community right, which is why there is the preceding clause about the militia, which at the time protected the community from invasions and so on.<br>  <br>  The right to life - If your talking abortion the fetus is not defined as a separate individual until after the 2nd or 3rf tri-mester.<br>  <br>  Hush-Rush - that has do with the public use of a finite commodity - who gets to use the airwaves. That's why it doesn't apply to soapbox, protests or cable. The airwaves are limited public good.<br>  <br>  Central Banking - To coin a money can be the same as printing it - because the Federal government was not limited to using gold - only the states were.<br>  <br>  Fed agencies - the language is taken from the broader language of the constitution.|`|NqNbIp2caa	It's funny - you are asking us to rule that abortion, and the Federal reserve (and possibly although you are vague about it the IRS) as unconstitional despite Supreme Court Rulings to the contrary.<br>  Last I saw the legal arbiters of the Constitution were the Supreme Court - not extremist right wing internet trolls.<br>  <br>  As for Ron Paul - yes we are all aware of his self appointed title of constitutional champion - but perhaps you can help me out by explaining where the following are authorized in the constitution<br>  <br>  Government subsidization of private sector education<br>  Government subsidization of the space tourism industry<br>  Banning US citizens from travelling freely abroad (ie to Cuba)<br>  Price fixing via limiting attorneys fees in class actions<br>  Limiting the ability to seek redress through the judicial system<br>  <br>  Ron Paul voted for all of them<br>  <a href="http://www.ontheissues.org/Ron_Paul.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ontheissues.org/Ron_Paul.htm</a>|`|cMHxg372aa	I take issue with every single one of your implicit definitions:<br>  <br>  - The second amendment is not "the right to bear arms shall not be infringed." The full text of the amendment is as follows:<br>  <br>  "A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed."<br>  <br>  I support gun ownership, and I actually have a concealed carry permit myself. However, the legal reality of the amendment is far more complicated than you imply - do you believe it's the right of private citizens to own an Ohio-class strategic missile submarine, and command enough firepower to wipe half of Europe off the map? Assuming you're sane and the answer is no, it illustrates the difficulty in determining the applicability of the amendment today.<br>  <br>  - I agree that every individual has a right to life. I don't agree that non-sentient unborn fetuses qualify as individuals, and therefore are entitled to no rights. Sort of like how a fish doesn't have the right to use the sidewalk.<br>  <br>  - I'm not sure how I feel about the Fairness Doctrine, but I can certainly see the point of supporters. There's an excellent argument to be made that the first amendment REQUIRES the fairness doctrine; as the airwaves are owned by the public, it is necessary to ensure that everyone has equal access to this medium. For instance, a public school is allowed to lease out space to religious groups, provided all have an equal opportunity to secure access. <br>  <br>  - The idea that central banking is prohibited by Article 1, Section 8 of the constitution is very much a minority one. In honesty, it's probably best described as a fringe position. The entirety of the argument consists of the assertion that the phrase "to coin money" means literally cast metal coins and nothing more. Most would say that in this context, "coin" means "to set a standard unit or value," or "to make or fabricate; to invent; to originate," as in, "to coin a phrase."<br>  <br>  - I agree generally, and I think the federal government has definitely overstepped its bounds in a number of areas. However, I think you imply that most of the federal government's agencies are unconstitutional, and that I would most definitely take issue with. The DEA definitely is unconstitutional. The DoE? Not so much.|`|E9XL5x3Paa	No, I can't.  But then, no Republican fits that bill, either.<br>  <br>  <br>  Most notably, they all fail in the unconstitutional federal agencies dept.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Add-on:<br>  <br>  I do know about Ron Paul.  I also know Republicans crushed his run for the Presidency on at least 3 separate occasions.  <br>  <br>  And he is not really Republican, even if he calls himself one.|`|ZOXoPgJbaa	No such thing. <br>  <br>  Only Ron Paul upholds the constitution.<br>  <br>  sage you are one misleading sob-<br>  You have twisted all those laws around BIG TIME! Im way too busy studying for my law exam tomorrow or else id break it down.

LzPhdri5aa	We should have a third legislative branch of government consisting of direct appointments from Governors (who by definition represent the interests of a STATE not the people who could counter the Federal government) which could act as a second veto by simple majority on any legislation passed by the federal government mandating any funds to be given to, or directed by, the state or local governments.<br>  <br>  No more mandates without funding!|`|1c74cc7ee9876780e94d288d920e0d0aaa	Great idea!|`|808f8239addd67976faf828dba2a4992aa	Wouldn't work to many lawyers out of work who would lie and cheat to make money?|`|3lVuNfLMaa	A lot of laws are there for a reason and do do good things|`|AA11206283	Too late

w4nzmyChaa	Ma intendi le tipologie di comunismo e le tipologie di comunisti?<br>  Di tipologie ne esistono delle più svariate sia per uno che per l'altro.<br>  In Italia le tipologie di comunisti hanno una certa varietà:<br>  1- quelli di estrema sinistra dagli anni '70 che vivono il loro impegno politico con molto serietà e che all'epoca erano contro il PCI, per lo più si tratta di maoisti, castristi, socialisti rivoluzionaria, anarchici o simili.<br>  2- quelli di estrema sinistra che sono però restati nel PCI e sono attivi come operaisti dentro i comunisti italiani e in parte minore rifondazione.<br>  3- i freekettoni, prevalentemente rifondazione comunista, non hanno un'idea precisa di cosa vogliono. Io sono molto critico con loro, perchè secondo me non sanno bene cosa vogliono e non sono veramente comunisti.<br>  4- Quelli che ora non sono più comunisti, ma si sento ancora tali. Della serie voto il PD, perchè i tempi cambiano, le cose non sono più come una volta, però io sono comunista.<br>  5- Gli adolescenti. Frase tipo: "sono comunista, perchè non mi piace il mondo!"<br>  6- Quelli della scuola di Francoforte, critici con ogni prodotto della società di massa e del commercio.<br>  7- Gli esistenzialisti, la vita umana è inutile, ma tramite il mio impegno politico posso cambiare il mondo.<br>  <br>  Diciamo che le branche principali ci dovrebbero essere sia in termini di comunismi che in termini di comunisti.|`|C3eLEKnLaa	Non ci sono tre categorie di suddivisione ma una sola : la catto-sinda-borghese-stante ,  i comunisti odierni non hanno mai letto marx e il manifesto , anzi proprio non leggono , al massimo sfogliano fumetti, seguono e promuovono tutto quello che può *fare soldi*  , la cosa a cui ambiscono di più in secondo posto dopo i soldi è il potere , la libido di comandare , la facoltà di dire quattro caz.zate e di farsi applaudire , sopratutto il potere di *sentirsi kapò* quando altre strutture loro affini dettano direttive lesionistiche per il popolo che loro dovrebbero proteggere e loro si incaricano *volentieri*  di farle eseguire.  La corrente *unica* comunista italiana è una parodia del maoismo cui manca un leader ( ma non diversi lader ) e un libretto con le indicazioni da seguire ( e questa è la cosa che manca loro di più , poichè vista la loro penuria di sinapsi *un libretto con scritto tutto quello che c'è da fare* risolverebbe al meglio gli *empasse* ) .  Un mio parere personale alla luce di quanto ho detto:  non esistono (più) i comunisti , esistono persone ( persone ? ) che dicono di esserlo per concretizzare le loro brame e monetizzare i loro atteggiamenti.   La cura:  obbligarli a studiare  TUTTI  gli scritti dei Padri del Socialismo e del Comunismo , obbligarli a studiare La Costituzione Italiana e a leggere e imparare a memoria "Dei Delitti e delle Pene" del Beccaria , e alle verifiche , per ogni errore un calcio nel cu.lo e rimandati di un anno, e alla fine del settennato di studi un periodo di *apprendistato sul campo* come manovali in Fonderia ( sei mesi ) , addetti alle manutenzioni stradali ( altri sei mesi ) e poi "sei mesi coatti a Milano , Roma , o Torino , a scelta , a vivere con meno di 1000 euro al mese .  Se , se e dico se qualcuno dopo *sopravvive* a tutto questo allora si potrà pensare alla ri-nascita sia del comunismo sia dei comunisti.

YbwDFvEaaa	I suspect it was the "patriotic" thing to do to support a President who resembled themselves and their own ideology but as soon as someone they didn't vote for made it into office, they started singing a different tune. It's very discouraging.<br>  <br>  My mother is a prime example of this hypocrisy. She used to become very upset with me whenever I criticized the former administration and accused me of not being enough of a patriot, however now that someone she didn't vote for is in office, all she can do is criticize a man who has only just taken office and hasn't even had the opportunity to start governing our people yet. From his wife's choice in clothing, to how he *might* raise taxes, to how he probably didn't write his own inaugural speech (none of them do, to the best of my knowledge) she can't get enough of picking on Obama for every petty little instance. It's very, very sad to witness.|`|0893313b4aaf4932546eaa4244eaabb6aa	Nothing happened to it.  It was always a lie.<br>  <br>  Republicans had better hope and pray that Obama is a successful president, because if he is not, the suffering will belong to all of us, not just the Democrats.<br>  <br>  This is not "business as usual," as happened during the Clinton administration and the Ken Starr insanity.  <br>  <br>  This is life or death.  For the entire USA.  We'll see where their loyalty lies now.|`|lWZi2p70aa	Very good question!<br>  <br>  Well, I supported BUsh for a while, until I saw how the policies were shaping up.  I still respected the office, but I found myself unable to respect the man.<br>  <br>  The Turkish Empire had Christian slave troops they called janissaries.  They wore large wooden spoons in their caps and their officers were called something akin to 'Captain" which meant 'Cook'.  Each company had a lerge pot for community victual, and at times when the soldiers felt rebellious, they would tip over the pot and bang on it with their spoons.  The phrase for "tipping the pot" sounds very much like the English word, "mutiny".<br>  <br>  So yes I supported the President, and I will support any duly elected one, unless he figuratively urinates in the soup.  That is where the line is crossed between acting in good faith and just plain egregious and reprehensible behavior.  And it was not his behavior alone, but rather that of many of his appointees and congressional shills (referring to how Bush drove away my support).<br>  <br>  On a personal level, well, I think he'd be fun to have around for a wilderness expedition or a weekend getaway.  He does seem quite personable.  And so does the new one.|`|qBCGH52haa	Don't worry, these will be the same people complaining about the lack of  partisanship, even though the last eight years were about Bush policies, no consultation with Hill democrats, and no bi-partisanship...but obviously, the last eight years were different.|`|4iAMrHd1aa	Liberals are America-hating traitors who spewed hate and evil for eight years against a good, noble, honorable man. <br>  <br>  So now they have to lie in the bed they made with their hate.

6cd7cae3f8d44a82dd6c9bf47a165cd6aa	Because it's your money.|`|LzPhdri5aa	Gee.  Swell question there.<br>  <br>  Alright.  I'll answer this.<br>  <br>  Because liberals and independents have the empathy gene.  People who don't have the empathy gene are only loyal to their tribe.  They are extremely nice, kind and friendly to their tribe, but regard everyone else with hostility and xenophobia.  They create the harshest possible dehumanizing terms they can for people who are not of that tribe, and then shout them to members of the tribe as loud as they can.<br>  <br>  In this case, the tribe in question is Republicans. The perceived threat/enemy is "Democrats" so the invented term for the thing that makes them members of the not-tribe is 'Socialism'.  Money, in this case, meaning any taxes at all that do not regulate behavior in their own interpretation of biblical scripture.  <br>  <br>  Thus, the answer to your question is that members who are not of your tribe are doing things that your tribe does not agree with, with funding for causes you do not agree with, and therefore applying it in the definition of the term that you apply to them for doing what you do not agree with.<br>  <br>  Shorter answer: Water is wet.  In your little world, Democrats are socialists, and by breathing they are raping your paycheck for tax dollars to waste on frivolous causes.<br>  <br>  You answered your own question by asking it.|`|BLMh0dG6aa	As opposed to cooperate bail outs.|`|IUw5Z395aa	Yeah, they have this weird tendency of trying to use money to solve problems, rather than lining their pockets under the pretense of "fiscal Conservatism"|`|YonedWiEaa	psycology would suggest they did not get attention as a child and are trying to buy affection and admiration as an adult.....|`|01669e8c4403fe7fd458f8bdcb56e56aaa	You mean the way Bush and Paulson did with the banks?

Rather than just pay out $5 or $15 to show a judge his BC and be done with it, he and the DNC thinks it's more economical to spend somewhere in the neighborhood between 30,000--80,000 dollars of tax payers money to cover it up.  Needless to say, liberals don't have a problem of spending everyone else money.  And value receipt?  What is that suppose to mean to the liberals?  The question that should be asked now is, would you allow these people to run your business the way they spend money?  Is it any wonder why liberals claim to be so poor?  If there ever was a group of people who need to get a degree in home economic, liberals do!<br>  <br>  Obama is now a classic explainable that just because a person attends Harvard doesn't make them smart|`|ONjTdk7Kaa	The economy does better under Democratic presidents, so whatever we're doing - it's right.|`|k1jwNKbgaa	Because REAL solutions are tough.<br>  Sometimes you have to make a mess, before things get better.<br>  <br>  It would hurt their voting blocks too much, to do the right thing.|`|yuBuNoPDaa	What have the Republicans been doing and has it been a success? <br>  <br>  Bail out to Wall Street.<br>  <br>  Money is useful.

B9YZ9wYUaa	I beg to disagree with the yes answered here especially with mister state trooper. Consent is the most important factor of a person to agree with the condition prepared to her or him once it is abuse or remove and it is violated on the cops in question and they can be charge with grave misconduct or removal from service.<br>  <br>  Strapping a person to a chair without his consent is already a violation of his human rights, what if he doesn't like it or have no idea with this procedure or what is it all about. Even cops are frequent violators of human rights. Not because the person involved is a COP he can virtually do anything to a person without his consent whether written or otherwise. The law doesn't work that way were only the few are protected. There must be JUSTICE FOR ALL not a handful only.<br>  <br>  This is a person's blood not a person shoe or hat only. SO CONSENT MUST BE PROPERLY asked by the cops, I suppose this is not 1941 during the Nazi invasion of Europe is it? The legality of this kind SHOULD BE QUESTION IN COURT, and to my own opinion it is illegal for cops to strap an individual against their will or without consent taking blood for BAC or otherwise. Who are this cops DRACULA? They have to strapped a person to extract blood?<br>  <br>  17 years(Trooper) in law service doesn't make you a perfect law enforcer unless you virtually read all the law that pertains to it. Unless you are a born genius that is.|`|btdgVKGbaa	Short answer, yes.|`|AA11494150	Yes, it is. That falls under Wisconsin's Implied Consent laws, State Statute 343.305. You give consent to chemical testing as soon as you get behind the wheel. <br>  <br>  As far as forced blood draws, those were upheld by the Wisconsin Supreme Court in State v. Bohling. The legal principal they used to determine this is probable cause plus exigent circumstance. <br>  <br>  Not only will they take blood without consent, but you will be charged with a refusal because you did not cooperate. That is an automatic 1 year revocation of your license, above any penalty you get for the DUI.<br>  <br>  Additional:<br>  <br>  SS,  Drunk driving procedure is determined by state law.

Medical people do the blood work, not some STREET COP!!!<br>  What if a person is a bleeder?<br>   <br>  I know a person in Calif. that was going into a coma from major head trauma . The cop asked if they had been drinking. The person was incoherent and said yes. Even though the hospital had alcohol and drug tested the person and it was neg.The cop then placed the person under arrest for a DUI.,so he was legally able to take their blood.<br>  Which it came back NEG. again.<br>  <br>  That cop said the person was coherent enough to state their drinking yet, not coherent enough to give permission to take their blood?<br>  <br>  You can not have it both ways!!!<br>    <br>  Do you notice who is really trying to cover their a**  by the answers.<br>  The next posting from the cops will read as follows. <br>   The " LAW ", states that a turd with a bow tie is attractive. <br>  <br>  I am amazed with their garbage!
SS1VReF0aa	Unemployment declined steadily month after month following the Bush tax cuts of 03, until the housing bubble burst<br>  <br>  Employment is THE issue right now...we are trying to keep people in their jobs at this point<br>  <br>  How does spending money on building a dog park stimulate the economy? How does spending $300,000 to create one job for a limited period of time (the job exists as long as the project) stimulate the economy?<br>  <br>  <br>  Do you seriously consider Republicans making sure that nearly 1 trillion (TRILLION WITH A TR) in tax money is used effectively to be "partisan bickering" ??? Is that seriously what you believe this is?<br>  <br>  ______________________________<br>  Once that lovely dog park is built, the job is done. That dog park provides no more jobs at that point (maybe a maintenance job and a cleaner). More importantly, that dog park produces nothing! There is no value or product being produced. At that point it is just a big expense. That is not stimulus, that is waste. Then comes the bill that we have to pay back because this money is being borrowed...but nothing that was produced by this stimulus bill will help us to repay that debt being as it is all stuff that produces little or nothing of value. So we are worse off in 3-5 years than we are now! Creating jobs to just make stuff does not make sense. Much of the stuff in this bill is pork, nothing that produces anything of value.<br>  <br>  Give the money back to us in taxes. I use the money to start a business or expand an existing business or hire a new employee. I then use that money to produce things that make me more money. Then as my business produces more and I sell more I expand further. See how that works? My money is used to produce things of value! That is called growth. I wouldn't use that money to build a dog park because I'm not an idiot and I realize that a dog park won't give me a return and grow the economy.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Wow...do you want me to draw you a picture of this? That is your argument? How do you presume we are going to pay for this stuff that adds nothing to the GDP? Unbelievable...<br>  <br>  ______________________________<br>  I just can't resist either...<br>  "pay down debt, which does nothing for the economy"<br>  That actually does a lot for the economy. When people pay down their debt it increases the availability of loanable funds from the banks to others that want that money. Somebody is going to want to borrow that money. Given the right interest rate somebody will borrow it because there is something that somebody can use that money for to create value that exceeds the cost...that is simple banking and economic principle. That is what generates growth. So to say that consumers paying down debt does not help the economy is ridiculous.<br>  <br>  "NOT EVERYONE uses the money to do what you say"<br>  This is true...but that fact that SOMEONE is that adventurous is what makes it work. The risk takers are what drive this countries growth. There are lots of projects that businesses are waiting to pounce on, lots of opportunities to make money. Given the right interest rate on available funds and the right projects with a high enough return, those people will take advantage of the money and use it to create jobs. More people than you probably think or want to admit. We are a country founded on entrepreneurs' spirit's.<br>  <br>  Next...saving it, spending it or paying off debt, it doesn't really make a difference. We are a country that has a spending habit so like you said, most will spend it which is great for the economy. Demand drives growth and growth creates jobs. The big thing you need to realize is that consumers spend their money much more efficiently than the government and they spend it on things that they need or want. Businesses also spend FAR more efficiently than the government and they spend on things that create value. I don't want a f'n dog park and I won't benefit from that park in any way...so why do I have to pay for it? It's probably not even being built in my state!<br>  <br>  Finally...as far as people buying from foreign companies...THAT IS OUR PROBLEM AS A COUNTRY! That problem is not eliminated/solved by increasing government spending or by forcing companies to stay in the United States through strong arming them. The US has the second highest corporate tax rate in the world...geeee I wonder why they are all leaving?! US companies produce an inferior product in many cases. If they didn't then people would buy American. I am looking into getting a new car and I am currently looking into Nissans. Is that because I'm not patriotic? Absolutely not. I'm one of the most patriot guys you'll ever meet. It's because I know its a better product and I am getting the best car for my money. That is what an intelligent consumer does. If the US made a car that matched it I would buy US...but they don't. Same with every product. How much foreign stuff do you buy? Do you think about that when you shop? Everyone complains about it but nobody does anything about it! The American people are complaining about American consumers buying foreign goods....WE ARE THE CONSUMERS BUYING THE FOREIGN GOODS! We want everything cheap and we want it to be top quality and we want this and we want that....want want want. There are costs associated with that. There are rules to this game of supply/demand .... production/consumption.<br>  <br>  Did you get all that? I'd be happy to explain this further if you need more help with all that. Let your voice be heard, but understand the issue and look at all aspects. Peace out my patriotic friend!|`|2f2A2Lz3aa	Where do you get that Americans support this pork package ?

There is so much that will do nothing to improve the economy. In fact it will harm the economy.<br>  <br>  Tax cuts: When taxes are lower, more people have more money to spend. That means more stuff is bought. That means more stuff is made. That means more stuff is shipped. That means more people are hired to sell, make, and transport this stuff. And the result of all this stuff being made, sold and transported means more people have even more money. And when the consumer has enough money to be a little more picky about the stuff he or she buys, then the manufacturers will be forced to improve the quality of the stuff they make. Then more people will want their even better stuff.<br>  <br>  This will not happen when more people have less money to spend on stuff. <br>  <br>  "Tax cuts do not necesarily create more jobs, creating more jobs creates more jobs...period" How does one create a job?

Because the liberals believe that owning a home is a "right" that does not have to be earned. Both the Tax cuts of Buss and Regan DID stimulate the economy. Oh I forgot, you cannot read history and learn anything, you are a liberal.<br>  <br>  As for me and my household, I don't want a Socialist Government here in my free America and I will do everything including going to war with pork barrel spenders like you to prevent it from happening.<br>  <br>  Can I get any clearer that that for you.....?|`|z8kAKvGKaa	Apparently you have not read the stimulus package as it stands- it will not create jobs it is filled with personal agenda's for people like Pelosi.  It is going to rob the American people pure and simple.  It will create jobs for pet projects and when completed those jobs will dissolve.  Cutting taxes has in history proven to be stimulating to the economy- yet now we are being run by the neo-marxist that will tax us into complete poverty and you liberals will be crying when you have crappy health care and poor pay all due to your ignorance of voting in a bunch of selfish, ignorant politicians.  Go GOP- don't vote for this pig barrel liberal spending spree so called stimulus package!!!|`|LzPhdri5aa	Because they think they can repeat 1992-1994.<br>  <br>  It won't work like that this time.<br>  <br>  We are not our parent's generation.

I didn't vote for my state representatives so they could go to Washington and cast their votes based on the latest AP poll.  I expect them to vote as representatives of me and my state.  Hopefully that is what they all do.  <br>  And the majority of Americans oppose the stimulus package.<br>  <br>  According to Rasmussen, support has fallen from 45% two weeks ago, to 37%.|`|Souvww0maa	Why are Obama supports ignoring a greater reality - the stimulus package is nothing but an spend-fest.  There is no stimulus.  There is only pork.  Passing a bill that is HARMFUL to the country for the sake of passing something is beyond stupid.<br>  <br>  Just for the record, the majority of Americans do not want this stimulus bill to pass...  So, I guess you could say that the Senate Republicans are abiding by the wishes of the American people.|`|DAMZKbpDaa	I'm sure the Republicans that were elected feel a duty to their majority that elected them to uphold their political promises and positions.|`|280a2e214bf05397a5b94e4faa4b6d61aa	Funny....I don't remember a "majority" of Americans voting Obama as our new Dictator...I would think that he needs to work under the same rules as the other 43 guys...THAT is the "political reality."|`|ayhDyb16aa	You said it in your third sentence ! Obama wants to change the way the federal government runs !

Never in the history of the USA has a more partisan porker of a "spending bill" been set before the american people !  You wanted change what will this bill change ? What ?  Political payoffs and pandering to special interests ? Is that the change you signed up for when you cast a vote for the Boy Wonder Obama?

Fascists are the true leaders of this movement and their goal is for us to be like China. Wake up folks China is the most Capitalistic country in the world,and yet we call it a communist country.The common people in China earn very little for their labor and that is what some of the so called capitalists want here.<br>  <br>  To properly answer your question I believe in well regulated capitalism so I guess that makes me a capitalist.And as a capitalist I have to say that there is NO justification for this.|`|715f1626818f5d62fcf3ef5c3b86c820aa	you blame whole system for greed and corruption of some.i think there is no justification for it.|`|RxiBpUUuaa	Capitalists may have a go at defending the anti labor propaganda, even average guys that want to be good consumers of corporate production decry labor wages. <br>  There has been an historical and an ongoing labor/management conflict over wages and collective bargaining, yet these groups must accomplish their goals together.<br>  <br>  For every act of honest intention, to produce good in this life, comes arrayed against us the forces of darkness and destruction. Usually in threes.|`|d24525de43ba28019e73bdec2b08f385aa	First of all, you need to define your terms better.  No capitalist would justify using bailout money for anything, because no capitalist would support taxpayer bailout money at all.<br>  <br>  In fact, a capitalist believes in the separation of government from the economy to the greatest extent possible.  That means no bailouts for failed corporations, but it also means no manipulating the economy by the Feds to create boom & bust cycles, no risk-inducing legislation like the Community Reinvestment Act, and little or no interference in private labor/management relations.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, a statist believes that the government should control everything.  That is why, in a semi-free democracy, we need lobbyists.  If the government had no legislative favors to offer business, then business would have no incentive to hire lobbyists to wine & dine fat-cat congressmen from both parties.<br>  <br>  It has gotten to the point that both sides of an issue, right or wrong, need lobbyists.  Dependence on government has brought us to this point.  That is what capitalists oppose. <br>  <br>  Your example of unions is a good case in point.  For years, unions have used money that we were forced...yes, forced...to give to them for lobbying purposes and other political activities.  Republican union members had been forced to pay dues to the union, knowing that a large portion of those dues were going straight to democrat party.  A recent Supreme Court case has curtailed this practice somewhat, but union lobbying (paid for out of union dues and federal aid) has managed to undermine the effect of this holding.<br>  <br>  It's wrong for either side to use other people's money to pay for their lobbying and political activities.  Only a capitalist has the answer to how to stop this practice.|`|LzPhdri5aa	Never underestimate the ability of anyone to delude themselves into anything they want.|`|TtVMlVkbaa	I look at it this way.  They asked for money as a "bail out", turned around and gave bonuses like there was no tomorrow, bought out other banks and didn't do a damn thing for home owners fallen into a crisis because there was no money to loan companies.<br>  This tells me they did not need the money in the 1st place and we are fools to keep "bailing them out".
3e854f375a0b1b810f5035026554882baa	Because when you don't have a viable answer (like McCain and the economy) it's easier to attack with a question filled with lies and half truths.|`|z9UAnf3Waa	I'm sorry, were you talking?

q8dErKKEaa	Non era mica un referendum per diminuire il numero dei parlamentari.<br>  Si trattava di una riforma costituzionale varata dal solo Pdl che riscriveva metà della Costituzione, diminuendo sì il numero dei parlamentari (a partire dal 2011, però! Dal 2011! In tempo per approvare una nuova legge costituzionale che cancellasse la diminuzione, con maggioranza probabilmente così larga da non dover sottoporre la legge a referendum, se così i nostri deputati avessero deciso) ma contemporaneamente introduceva la devolution e di fatto cambiava forma di governo, svuotando di senso la figura del presidente della Repubblica e allargando a dismisura i poteri del premier (che addirittura poteva sciogliere il Parlamento, in compenso però sarebbe diventato molto ma molto difficile sfiduciarlo).<br>  E gli italiani decisero che non valeva la pena diminuire i parlamentari a costo di operare una trasformazione dello Stato così profonda.<br>  Tu gli dai torto?|`|a1c4079ac30ca7c102912d6d1a9cc7dcaa	senti, io sono del Centro Destra e seguo la politica.

e3b4913f44cd6f4d8fa6eb99cb4520caaa	Sad to say his victory could have a big impact on me. I am nearing the end of my reserve commitment and was thinking about re-upping because of the need in Iraq. It is hard to get motivated to serve under a new president that rightly or wrongly (only time will tell) wants to cut back on the US military commitment. I wonder if other service personnel feel likewise. As a young professional making a decent salary for the first time in a while, I now fear that I will be unfairly taxed just as I am becoming successful. Whereas I hope that I am wrong and that Obama will be a good president, I am fearful that he will not be able to escape his history as an ultra-liberal big spending tax enthusiast. With a democratic congress there will be almost no controls. Barney Frank has already promised to cut military spending by 25% to pay for various social welfare programs. Again, hoping for the best, but fearing the worst.|`|AA11784965	We will all just have to wait & see. Personally, I will keep plugging along just like I always do, no matter who's in office.

It's past get over it! Obama needs to bring our boys HOME not put them somewhere else. Everythign they worked for was for nothing now. WE NEED SOCIAL CLASS AND SOCIAL STATUS TO RUN OUR ECONOMY. We need to keep hard working people with values and morals away from welfare leeching alcholics who neglect their kids. I don't know why Obama thinks everyone should have the equal share of college and jobs. If you want something, work for it. If you dont work for it, thats too bad for you! Giving a free ticket to people isnt goig to magically make them smart, hard working, and determined.

However, he did not implicate Bush in that admission of guilt.<br>  <br>  And the Guantanamo Bay torture deal didn't really occur until after 2003, so they still have until 2012.<br>  <br>  <br>  And if Bush was trying to protect this great nation, then why did we leave the fight against terrorism for our little foray into Iraq?  There were no terrorists in Iraq, and all evidence and every single intelligence agency looking into it told Bush that.  That would include the CIA.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  And Obama has already said he is not interested in pressing charges against anyone in the Bush Administration.  Not even Cheney.|`|xoK87yuGaa	There should be a proper investigation. If he committed no crimes it will stop the people from calling him a war criminal. However, if he did commit any crimes punish him, and make an example that America is not above the law!|`|VgOCLskYaa	Only if they are willing to bring Clinton in on manslaughter charges for allowing all the American deaths during his administration with no retaliation only bombing an aspirin factory.|`|FZRWMc3Baa	Since he committed no crimes, the easy answer is no.|`|UZBULUuraa	The problem with all of this is who would want to try him and have enough solid information to convict him. If you note, over history the only people tried for war crimes are the losers and the US declared victory in Iraq a few months after it started. I don't think trying him would be beneficial to anyone, and would probably hurt and polarize the nation even more than it is today. My answer is no.|`|XYTUAzzgaa	if they ever tried to texas would secede taking with it, it's over a trillion dollar a year economy. and the texas national guard would stand ready to take on any such attempt by force. we still remember the alamo even if the libs have banned it's teaching in our schools....come and get it...i can guarantee a civil war if those libs even try...and they know it.|`|U9XlITtHaa	Well since Obama has issued the same orders as Bush he would have to stand beside him.

If you do nothing about it, it will happen again and again! <br>  <br>  Some of the People who were in the bush administration came from the Nixon administration. Ford gave Nixon a pardon, he got away with crimes, we the people did nothing about it. <br>  <br>  We must have Bush answer for his deeds. If he did nothing he has nothing to fear, if he did something he has all to fear!|`|4loaxx2raa	no|`|Alkn6IJYaa	Your statement <br>  <br>  "President Bush was simply trying to protect our great nation"<br>  <br>  if false because good intent is not even a defense of a normal crime, much less a war crime, which is a much more serious offense. It can be used during sentencing, however.<br>  <br>  The President committed many War Crimes as is evident from his own actions, description and words. Not to prosecute him for War Crimes would make a mockery of the most serious of crimes one can make.<br>  <br>  You also make a mockery of our President and the potential of a 'truth commission'. Such mockery is unwarranted because of the established facts of the case. The only question is how many war crimes did he make and how knowledgeable of various crimes we don't know about did he make.<br>  <br>  To answer your question, it is unlikely that the Democrats will prosecute him for War Crimes because they are cowards.<br>  <br>  I just read you said 'he committed no crimes'. I have wrote extensively on the crimes he has committed from Torture, to attacking a country that is not a threat to us, violating all kinds of laws when occupying Iraq, to illegally obtaining funds to attack Iraq, to creating a paid propaganda network, and violating the rights of detainees, violating the rights of prisoners of war and the rest of it. Bush has also committed non-war crimes such as violating FISA laws, denying haebus corpus and other rights to detainees (not picked up on the battlefield), lying the American people, lying to congress, politicizing the justice department, and hundreds of others.|`|8722a385a740fd3c165b65c08ed568ffaa	no offense, but this is getting a bit old.  but no he shouldn't be tried and no he did not cause hurricane katrina either

The Army is the branch that deploys the most that goes for Active Duty, Guard, and Reserves.  In the Army, you are a soldier first that means you will deploy to the battle field and if you get lucky you might get to do the job you signed on to do.  On top of that you might come back to the states for a month after being deployed out of the entire year the rest of the time is spent on the battle field.  Not sure about the Marines.  In the Air Force you are whatever you decide to do first and an airman next meaning that if you are deployed you doing what you signed up to do first if things go bad you'll be called to the battle field.  Another thing to consider when you join is friends and family; if you have a wife and kids or considering someday on settling down to have a family, rather or not you want to see them again, alive.  I hope these sites is helpful.
fAaLjlI0aa	It depends greatly on the probation officer, their case load, what the violation is, what your track record is, the original offense that put you on probation, and what (if anything) you're doing to correct the situation that is in violation of the terms of your probation. <br>  <br>  If you broke a rule (as opposed to committing a new crime) you are less likely to be violated, especially if the PO has a heavy case load. If you are violated in those circumstance, you may be lucky enough to get a slap on the wrist, if both the PO and the judge think you have the potential to get your act together. If you committed a new crime (thus showing it is not likely you will get your act together), you will in all likelihood be violated, and will have to serve additional time either incarcerated or on probation with stricter rules.|`|P055DfvBaa	Usually none.

It was the people, It was mental heath folks on campus who had identified Chow as the risk but did nothing about it so he kept his right to buy a gun over the counter and he killed with that right. The removal of this right (just like a judge can have police enter your home to look for illegal drugs) is an easy process and could perminate or for a time period.<br>  <br>  Columbine: Students killed. No teacher had a firearm to protect the studenta left in their care. <br>  <br>  In the 1940's the Thompson Submachine Gun (Tommy Gun) was an over the counter weapon. It was the source for the Automatic weapons ban he have today. Police Weaponry did not keep pace with the criminals. Hipocrasy is that Autos are still availble to criminals and police can get them but the ones that have automatic weapons used against them can not get them.<br>  <br>  Under the Brady Bill High capacity magazines were banned yet police who are trained to shoot and "Qualify" but citizens are reduced to less rounds to fire at a bad guy.    <br>  <br>  The next battle is Amunition markers.|`|kbz5S3waaa	major Con: an upstanding citizen doesn't have a way to protect them-self from a criminal.|`|PBq7ODPzaa	Read the Second Amendment to the Constitution.  It states clearly the right to "keep and bear arms".  Also look at what the founding fathers said about gun ownership;<br>  <br>  "To disarm the people [is] the best and most effectual way to enslave them …" George Mason, 3 Elliot, Debates at 380 (June 14, 1788).<br>  <br>  "to preserve liberty it is essential that the whole body of the people always possess arms, and be taught alike, especially when young, how to use them …" Richard Henry Lee writing in Letters from the Federal Farmer to the Republic, Letter XVIII, January 25, 1788.<br>  <br>  "Besides the advantage of being armed, which the Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation,... in the several kingdoms of Europe,... the governments are afraid to trust the people with arms." James Madison, The Federalist Papers # 46.<br>  <br>  "They tell us, sir, that we are weak; unable to cope with so formidable an adversary. But when shall we be stronger? Will it be the next week, or the next year? Will it be when we are totally disarmed, and when a British guard shall be stationed in every house?" Patrick Henry, "Give Me Liberty Or Give Me Death" speech delivered on March 23, 1775.<br>  <br>  "The millions of people, armed in the holy cause of liberty, and in such a country as that which we possess, are invincible by any force which our enemy can send against us." Patrick Henry, "Give Me Liberty Or Give Me Death" speech delivered on March 23, 1775.<br>  <br>  what country can preserve it's liberties if their rulers are not warned from time to time that their people preserve the spirit of resistance? Let them take arms... The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots & tyrants. It is it's natural manure." Thomas Jefferson to William S. Smith on Nov. 13, 1787.<br>  <br>  "The right of the citizens to keep and bear arms has justly been considered, as the palladium of the liberties of a republic; since it offers a strong moral check against the usurpation and arbitrary power of rulers; and will generally, even if these are successful in the first instance, enable the people to resist and triumph over them." Joseph Story, Dane Professor of Law in Harvard University, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States (1833)<br>  <br>  "Little more can reasonably be aimed at, with respect to the people at large, than to have them properly armed and equipped;…" Alexander Hamilton, The Federalist Papers # 29.<br>  <br>  "The laws that forbid the carrying of arms are laws of such a nature. They disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes....Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants; they serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man. Thomas Jefferson's "Commonplace Book," 1774-1776<br>  <br>  "Arms in the hands of citizens [may] be used at individual discretion… in private self-defense …" John Adams, A Defense of the Constitutions of the Government of the USA, 471 (1788)<br>  <br>  This is just a handful of quotes from the founders of our nation.  There were 2 primary reasons for the right to keep and bear arms.  The first is self defense, and the second is the right of the citizens to defend themselves from, and, if need be, overthrow a tyrranical government.  The right to keep and bear arms is the peoples trump card to keep the government in check.  That is why people should question why anyone in politics that wants to take away our constitutional rights.|`|LzPhdri5aa	The Supreme Court recently ruled that an individual has a right to own a gun.<br>  <br>  Because the NRA will crush anyone who is in favor of gun control and there are a lot more productive things for Democrats to be doing than taking away guns.<br>  <br>  Because when a crazy person goes around shooting people, the police cannot magically teleport there (ala Star Trek) or arrive there in seconds (ala the Flash).  If you have a gun you can shoot them. If you don't, you can be shot.<br>  <br>  Because the interpretation implying that 'only militias' can have a gun in the constitution is REALLY strained.<br>  <br>  Because the litmus test for whether or not a government should take away a freedom or give it should always be to give the freedom unless it can show a strong reason otherwise.  No successful argument that taking guns away from normal people makes crime go down has ever been made.  The only argument that has actually real statistics involves accidents in the home, but those numbers pale in comparison to swimming pools which are nowhere near as regulated.|`|81e525d2b0af9f7090cd857fd7b2095baa	Strictly my philosophy here, but I think that gun control has some benefits.  I can't imagine why anybody other than the military would need a Mk 19 automatic grenade launcher or a gatling gun.  Your average citizen doesn't need fully automatic weapons, and I can't see a reason why anybody needs a 100 round drum which is what I picked up at the gun show for about $140 dollars.<br>  <br>  With a couple thousand dollars and a really bad grudge someone can go to the gun show and buy a high powered rifle and a high capacity magazine to go with it and they'd be ready to take a lot of people with them to hell in an instant.  There are a lot of these underground militias that just stock up and tons of ammo, magazines loaded and thousands of rounds and several rifles at the ready.  What they're preparing for I don't know... the "revolution"?<br>  <br>  The cons are that we could disarm the citizens and then how would they be able to defend themselves against an oppressive government?  Total gun bans means that the people wouldn't be able to hunt with rifles or other firearms.  Also self defense is a key issue.<br>  <br>  What scares me is that people in the US for the large part seem unaware that we are about to enter another great depression.  Everyone in the US has the right to bear arms, so how will people use all these weapons when this happens?  The thought of that scares me.<br>  <br>  If the economic system collapses and people go hungry, it wouldn't be hard for a small group of people in a truck armed to the teeth to take down an eighteen wheeler full of food.  The food that was meant for the city will be lost and the people in the urban areas will be extremely mad.  If the government tries to disarm the people at that point they will be met with a lot of resistance by people who have been raised with weapons and shoot much better than many in our army who barely qualify with their weapons.<br>  <br>  Oh well, we'll see what happens.  The people who give me the thumb down are living in denial.|`|m5FyTeYgaa	If you have time, this link is terrific. <a href="http://www.constitution.org/mil/rkba1982.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.constitution.org/mil/rkba1982...</a><br>  <br>  You could also look at the NRA website.

But, most of the time, we hope for the best.|`|bac0c08d67448ca69e882615d8e3b333aa	Well, theoretically Congress could pass any law it can muster enough votes for.  For most, a simple majority in the House and Senate would pass most laws, but internal rules within the Senate give the minority a lot of power to crash bills unless the majority can get 60 senators to vote for it.  The President can veto the legislation and it then requires a 2/3 majority in both Houses to override his veto.  That's next to impossible.  And after that, a person or the government could take the case to court, federal or perhaps to the Supreme Court, and ultimately they would have the final call on whether a law was unconstitutional.

Il cardinal Schuster di Milano voleva dargli la possibilita` di avere un processo giusto, invitandolo a non fuggire. Purtroppo successe come la storia racconta: Mussolini fu giustiziato senza regolare processo e messo ignominiosamente appeso a capo in giu` in piazza Loreto a Milano. Per Saddam, sento il parere di persone che sono contrarie alla pena di morte, perche` la vita appartiene a Dio, ma poi sono pronte a gettare in una cella Saddam e buttarne via la chiave, o peggio ancora, condurlo ogni giorno avanti e indietro al patibolo. Ed io mi domando se sia lo stesso Dio a suggerire loro questi dolci pensieri di inaudita umanita`. Allora capisco che gli uomini dei tempi di Mussolini non sono cambiati: sono vendicativi e malvagi e usano l ' avversione alla pena di morte come un programma di elevata cultura, oppure, come certi sacerdoti del Sinedrio, vorrebbero mettere a morte un condannato, ma non in giorno di sabato, per paura del popolo. E tutti sanno che il popolo volle la liberazione di Barabba. Non sto dicendo che Saddam e` innocente, tutt' altro. Merita la pena di morte o quantomeno un ergastolo umano, privo di disumane vendette. Solo cosi` si puo` dire che la nostra cultura e` maturata. Un giorno non vorremmo sentirci dire che il popolo ( o un fantomatico gruppo terroristico ) ha chiesto la liberazione di Barabba. Questo e` il popolo che non sa piu` distinguere il bene dal male. Tu l'hai chiamato il popolo dei due pesi e delle due misure. Perdonare Saddam spetta alla parte innocentemente lesa, non ai politici che si fanno belli contro il dolore e la impotente rabbia degli innocenti. E spetta in primo luogo a Saddam porgere pubblica scusa agli innocenti, ponendo un netto distacco tra le sue malefatte e la grazia del perdono. Io non ho ancora visto questo pentimento, ma movimenti per la sua liberazione si sono mossi prima della sua richiesta di grazia.<br>  Spero di aver reso l'idea senza ipocrisia?|`|02f515339f28161b237fa77052c2435faa	forse perchè devono fare i buonisti!|`|0df7b36c1cbc0d86855496e4cb9b30a4aa	heheheh caro Andromeda...ormai basta che io scriva...non importa neanche cosa..per trovarmi i pollici giu'..<br>  <br>  Per la domanda che e' la stessa di ieri ti ho gia' risposto in merito...|`|3fe7d1a1109a05fb03e0192a42bd8054aa	Forse ai comunisti la storia ha insegnato qualche cosa.

And they are indeed being listened to.  The US never intended to remain as the force of protection. It has always been expected to move the decisions and the force to implement to the Iraqi as they rebuilt a governing body. US troops in Iraq will be down 80% in three years and zero in five years.

r4PSG8v4aa	Si è tristissimo che i docenti di un'università come la Sapienza abbiano fatto una cosa del genere...<br>  Anche se la maggioranza dei docenti avesse detto di no (x fortuna sono moooolti di meno della metà) sarebbe stato ingiusto perche bisogna rispettare le idee di tutti, specie quando queste idee sono condivise dalla maggior parte d'Italia e credo anche della Sapienza...<br>  Inoltre il cristianesimo credo che diffonda anche messaggi universali, che al giorno d'oggi dovrebbero essere condivisi da tutti... altrimenti perche parlare con il Dalai Lama? è anche lui esponente di una religione no? e rappresentante di una cultura completamente diversa dalla nostra... é razzismo all'incontrario! Ben vengano gli asiatici e gli africani, si apra un dialogo con loro, come è giusto, ma non possiamo dialogare in pace con una persona con lo stesso colore della pelle ecc.. forse hanno paura delle sue idee?<br>  Ad ogni modo, anche se la maggior parte dei docenti avesse detto no, e fossero stati tutti d'accordo, mi stupisco che in un luogo di studio come la Sapienza non possa parlare uno studioso come il papa, uno dei massimi teologi del nostro tempo.<br>  x concludere, vorrei dire che quella frase che hanno tirato in ballo i docenti x trovare una scusa plausibile, quella: "tutto ciò che è stato fatto contro Galileo fu ragionevole e giusto" o qualcosa del genere,è:<br>  1 roba vecchia (risale a quando era vescovo nel 1990)<br>  2 Detta da un altro studioso precedente (Feyerabend)  e non inventata di sana pianta da ratzinger, che cmq l'ha citata durante un'omelia in parte dissociandosi..<br>  Non ho altro da aggiungere... zigh|`|CFs8PUQcaa	Allora, innanzitutto chiariamo una cosa: il Papa NON E' stato costretto ad annullare la visita, ma l'ha fatto di sua libera scelta. Anche personaggi come Bush vengono criticati con forti manifestazioni quando vengono in Italia. Ma Bush non ha mai annullato le sue visite per questo motivo.<br>  <br>  Entrando nel merito delle contestazioni, trovo sbagliato il comportamento di quella parte di studenti e professori che in nome della laicità non volevano, in qualunque contesto, la visita del Papa. Infatti, essere laici vuol dire, come disse Voltaire, seguire questo schema: "Non sono d'accordo con te, ma darei la vita per consentirti di esprimere le tue idee".<br>  <br>  Invece, sono d'accordo con quella parte di professori (la maggioranza dei famosi 67 della "lettera") e e quella parte di studenti (la minoranza dei contestatori) che semplicemente avrebbero voluto che il Papa fosse venuto innanzitutto in un altro momento, e non a fare la "Lectio Magistralis" di apertura dell'anno accademico di un'università, e che poi potesse esporsi ad un civile dibattito, e non un monologo senza possibilità di condivisione o confutazione.|`|J8NBbC7Zaa	hanno sbagliato entrambi le parti...il papa a non andare e gli studenti a non volerlo....ma dico io perchè non fare un bel faccia a faccia tra gli studenti e il papa invece di fare una figura barbina col mondo?|`|bsWoVp1Kaa	è una vergogna che un personaggio accademico come ratiznger che ha ricevuto  molti riconoscimenti accademici ed ha insegnato nelle università debba annullare una visita alla sapienza soltanto per colpa di un gruppetto di quattro squinternati.<br>  <br>  dicasi papafobia.|`|lrhj5a1Faa	Ti ho risposto qui!|`|40be003e75762a279a7a7d0629536c7daa	<.......ma è pur il papa.>, per te, avra un ruolo che io e tanti come me disconoscono, se mi parli che è un Capo di Stato, sono d'accordo, ma si deve fare i cavoli suoi sulla nostra politica interna.|`|1fb63250bbf964289dd3ee5d4eb51926aa	è una vergogna|`|28ea2fc06015a7e0096a3636fabb769daa	ma va a cagare...<br>  senza offesa.....<br>  il rispetto magari dovrebbe cominciare a averlo lui, come gli ha chiesto la risoluzione della comunità europea che essendo contro le discriminazioni di tutti i tipi ha ritenuto di fare una 'richiesta' a tutti i paesi di adottare dei provvedimenti che puniscano i leader religiosi e politici che inneggino e alimentino l' odio contro gli omosessuali;<br>  o magari rivedendo la posizione della chiesa nella società e nelle istituzioni (partendo dalla propria)<br>  Qui siamo cresciuti con la convinzione che il papa possa dire ciò che vuole perchè rappresentante di Dio in terra<br>  e che ogni sua parola è Verbo, pena finire all' inferno.<br>  Il papa rappresenta la Chiesa che è cosa molto diversa dalla Religione e da Dio<br>  <br>  Voi credete di guadagnarvi il paradiso solo per il fatto di difendere ogni minchiata che dice il papa così potete permettervi di mantenere tutti i vostri odii razzismi e discriminazioni... almeno abbiate il buon gusto di applicare rigorosamente il Vangelo così come fanno i mussulmani con il corano...che almeno coerenti lo sono<br>  <br>  il papa NON ha voluto andare alla Sapienza....se viene in una istituzione italiana (stato laico) viene da Uomo e non da Verbo e può essere anche contenstato dato che le sue tesi sulla scienza, sullaa famiglia, sulla sessualità e sulla società sono radicali, estreme, discriminatorie  e quindi discutibili<br>  <br>  scusa ma se fosse stato invitato un imam Saudita a parlare, avreste fatto tutta questa caciara se fosse stato contestato, magari perchè sostiene che alle bambine bisogna tagliare l' imene o che la donna per essere pura debba indossare lo shador?<br>  <br>  prendo ora dal sito di Luttazzi una lettera:<br>  <br>  Oggi il sito del Corriere riporta allegramente che il Guardian avrebbe scritto:<br>  "la controversia è ?senza precedenti in un Paese dove normalmente non vengono mosse critiche alla Chiesa cattolica romana" (il virgolettato é loro e a casa mia significa traduzione letterale). Guarda un po', John Hooper invece scrive sul sito del Guardian che:<br>  ?The controversy was unparalleled in a country where criticism of the Roman Catholic church is normally muted.? che occhio e croce si traduce con:<br>  la controversia è senza precedenti in un Paese dove normalmente le critiche alla Chiesa cattolica romana VENGONO ZITTITE<br>  <br>  magari un po di informazione corretta aiuterebbe a dire le cose giuste|`|47949268fe5cbb7d94280b3635f9f60caa	i docenti 3.200 si sono fatti beffare da 70 che non sembrano siano dei docenti di liberta' e dovrebbero essere fuori da quella universita' perchè hanno insultato i principi stessi x cui sono li' che loro di sapienza non hanno e pertanto non possono insegnare.ciao antonio|`|QvHG81LWaa	ha scelto lui di non andare per non confrontarsi con le idee di chi non era d'accordo con lui|`|hrdEzpb2aa	Sono stati degli ingenui.

Everyone, rich or poor, pays the exact same tax rate.  But they tried to implement that back in the mid-90's and none of the gov. would bite.  It was something like 17%.  That way, no one is getting perks, like the rich because they have XXx investment and .333 percent goes here, and 1.5 % there.  You know how the rich hide their money in other things.<br>  <br>  But that should be on just the income.  Then a separate tax for 'investments'..such as properties, another for annunities...  all of lesser amounts, of course, but to hold a 'pat' percentage rate for everyone, no matter what.<br>  <br>  Then a seperate depreciation scale...but give a list of what and what is not included.  Some people go crazy and do 3 different types of desks for their offices.  Dumb stuff.<br>  <br>  I think if the IRS and gove worked it that way, we'd have a surplus of money...a big surpluss.

Alaska even PAYS their residents about $1000 per year from the fund plus pays for everything else.<br>  <br>  Why not adopt Earth Rights for the nation and put tarriffs back on ALL the foreign goods.  The foreign companies now sell then buy thier own goods in a foreign port to eliminate their profit (on paper) before the goods are sold here.  This cheats the US out of the taxes they owe.  Make them pay for the contents of every container before it leaves the docks.  NO LOOPHOLES!  Add in all the Earth Rights money from around the nation and now we need NO TAXES!  The Internal Revenue Service becomes the Import Revenue Service!  ALL the tax work gets off our back and the money stays in our pocket.  All the money from the tariffs is new money from outside the country that is added to our economy.  The way taxes work now is they are a % of our GDP.  The tariffs are new money now NOT a part of our GDP but an addition to our GDP as the gov will spend that new money into OUR economy.

I work in a major city in the southern US, it records a new murder about once every four days, people in many parts of the city have to put bars on their windows and don't go out after dark.  Just today I was admiring the nice wooden doors on a historic building but was saddened to see that those doors had to be protected by new glass doors because so many people have no respect for property.  I grew up in a rural area where no one locked thier doors but that world doesn't exist anymore.  Now people there not only lock their doors but they also set their alarms.<br>  <br>  Also, just look at history.  Has there ever been a long period of true peace?  No, there hasn't.  To think that there would be now if people just decided to get along is like beliving in the tooth fairy.
4cehW3S9aa	I will tell you what it is like in the State of WI where we have the most strenuous training program for law enforcement officers.  In this area, we start at around 45,000 plus overttime as well as great benifits.  In the scheme of things, it is allot more than that.<br>  <br>  Not only did I have to go to college for 4 years to get the degree, we also had to go through an academy where we had firearms, EVOC(learn to drive squad cars evasively), DAAT(gets your butt in shape and learn how to arrest people etc.), first responder and that is all I can think of off the top of my head.<br>  <br>  I don't regret being a police officer but your job will be your life.  You won't be home hollidays and we don't close on the weekend.  If you are willing to do allot of sacrifice, it is a great job.<br>  <br>  The issue with your hair, I don't think will be a big deal as long as you keep it nicely groomed.  I am not for certain on the last question though.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|etjy9SYsaa	Annual salaries vary by state. Here in Ohio, average start is anywhere from $40k to $50k. I had to go through the academy, 6 months long. I don't regret anything, I love this job. I don't see what your race has to do with anything. As for your religious convictions relating to your hair, you cannot be discriminated against. There are officers that wear turbans and yamikas.|`|4d99334f60856f1567cf86a73219976aaa	Not a police officer myself, but have lived with one for most of my life (first my dad, then my boyfriend).  Salary is going to vary by state and by cities, towns, etc.  You may want to google the specific areas you are looking for to find out what salary and various requirements (including educational) that are required.  The more affluent the area, the higher the salary typically is - but at the same time to petty bullsh*t factor increases (my boyfriend is a cop in a rather affluent township and some of the crap they get called for is absolutely ridiculous).<br>  <br>  Question though - what religion are you that you cannot cut your hair?  While certainly religious beliefs are taken into consideration for many things, I know most departments go for a cleancut look, meaning short, neat haircuts for males.  Cornrows will not look professional on a cop.|`|qCQEqoYmaa	Pay varies state to state.  In Georgia it starts at 28K.  Other PDs and SOs vary also from 22K to 28K.<br>  <br>  I had to wait four months while background checks, polygraphs, fingerprint checks, drug testing, and psychological tests were run and I didn't get paid for any of it (at least they paid for the testing.)  I had to get a temporary job until I heard from them.  Once you are hired the first thing you go through is hours of training in all aspects of your job.  Mine was for working in the jail.  Troopers automatically go to a military bootcamp style four month academy.<br>  <br>  As for regrets, I got out of law enforcement because my body wasn't keeping up with my enthusiasm for the job and the fact that more and more admin and higher ups weren't ever cops and keep telling you how to do your job differently even though they have no idea what they are talking about.  Lastly, I got out because I wasn't allowed to enforce the laws equally.  I kept getting updates about who and where I shouldn't patrol or make traffic stops.  That smelled of favors, kick backs and corruption and I wasn't going to be involved.<br>  <br>  As for your religion, you need to make a decision.  Some departments will allow your hair style, but some will give you a choice: Comply with the uniform SOP or find another job.  Since you will be starting the job instead of them adopting a new procedure after you have been hired you will have no recourse under EOE or civil rights.

Cependant, je m'interroge depuis longtemps, de savoir, si Saddam Hussein n'était pas "l'homme qu'il leur faut" aux irakiens. Certes c'était un dictateur, mais il faut aussi s'interroger sur le sens de ce mot, et le comparer à la définition d'un "despote éclairé". Il est évident pour tout le monde, que ce n'est pas un ange, je suis moins persuadé que tout le monde sache que les deux guerres menées par les Etats-Unis en Irak l'ont été sur de fausses preuves. S'il y a bien eut invasion du Koweit en 1990, il est intéressant de voir que le témoignage à l'ONU rapportant le massacre de 372 bébés par les soldats irakiens (voir source) a été purement inventé.<br>  Interrogez-vous aussi, sur le fait que malgré l'embargo imposé par les Etats-Unis pendant 10 ans, les irakiens ne mourraient pas de faim. Pendant le règne de Saddam Hussein, les communautés religieuse vivaient en harmonie, entre musulmans, et aussi ceux-là avec les chrétiens (Tarek Aziz, ancien vice-premier ministre irakien est chrétien).<br>  Comme on souligne plus haut :<br>  "Je suis contre. Je suis même pour qu'on lui rende le pouvoir, peut être qu'il mettra fin à ces massacres en Irak "<br>  Il est probable que de le remettre en place, il devrait lui rester des contacts, des gens de confiance pour tenter de rebatir le pays... mais pour l'instant, les Etats-Unis n'ont pas encore finis de le détruite (je ne dis pas que les Etats-Unis cherche à détruire le pays, mais que les conséquences de la guerre y conduisent).<br>  <br>  Pour terminer sur le terme "dictateur" le pouvoir détenu par une seule et même personne est risquée, évidemment, mais quand cette personne oeuvre à l'évidence pour le bien de son pays? à méditer. C'est d'ailleurs pour ?a que malgré l'expression "les USA ont libéré le peuple irakien de leur tyran", les soldats US rencontraient beaucoup d'irakiens attachés à leur dirigeant.|`|61da919e08bd482cd72d46325c781839aa	les diables sont chez vous.|`|71209860b19dcbebb219d754b97b6440aa	Une pendaison ?!

The negative connotation is fueled by the perception that bureaucrats lack creativity and zest. Bureaucrat jobs are usually "desk jobs" (the French for desk being bureau), often of a clerical or organizational nature.<br>  <br>  Max Weber defined a bureaucratic official as the following:<br>  <br>  He is personally free and appointed to his position on the basis of conduct <br>  He exercises the authority delegated to him in accordance with impersonal rules, and his loyalty is enlisted on behalf of the faithful execution of his official duties <br>  His appointment and job placement are dependent upon his technical qualifications <br>  His administrative work is a full-time occupation <br>  His work is rewarded by a regular salary and prospects of advancement in a lifetime career <br>  He must exercise his judgment and his skills, but his duty is to place these at the service of a higher authority. Ultimately he is responsible only for the impartial execution of assigned tasks and must sacrifice his personal judgment if it runs counter to his official duties. <br>  Bureaucratic control is the use of rules, regulations, and formal authority to guide performance. It includes such things as budgets, statistical reports, and performance appraisals to regulate behavior and results. <br>  Bureaucrats of the EU are frequently termed eurocrats in the English language in Europe - a portmanteau of European Union (or Europe) and bureaucrat. Such portmanteaus have multiplied in recent year, including educratn or milicrat.<br>  <br>  In imperial China, bureaucrats largely composed the social elite. Known in Europe as Mandarins, after the Portuguese word for 'councillor', this variety of bureaucrats passed a set of complicated examinations and were posted throughout the empire.

La Russia non ha la forza per dominare il globo ma ne ha abbastanza da far venir meno l'equilibrio delle forze, la mossa meno saggia di USA ed UE è stata spingere la Russia ad un confronto globale con noi da qui nasce il gruppo di Shangai una grande alleanza euroasiatica capitanata dalla Cina che in futuro potrà aspirare a contendere e forse ottenere il dominio del globo.<br>  <br>  Staremo a vedere ma le cose si mettono male.|`|28ea2fc06015a7e0096a3636fabb769daa	non ho letto il prestigioso articolo di romagna oggi...<br>  perchè dovrebbero fare una guerra? al fine di terminare il processo di globalizzazione? e che vuol dire?<br>  las guerra gli stati uniti la stanno facendo dove gli conviene, e non hanno alzato un sopracciglio per le guerre appoggiate dalla cina (vedi darfur o tibet)...<br>  mica sono scemi no?<br>  poi sappi che l'conomia americana è in mano ai cinesi ora mai, il 60% delle obbligazioni americane sono in mano mandarina, bastas che stringano la mano e gli strizzano le palle, che bisogno hanno di fare una guerra?|`|EsV3KrNmaa	E' proprio la globalizzazione che rende impossibili le guerre (tale guerra secondo me sarebbe sempre impossibile, tra due potenze atomiche, e nessuna delle due potrà mai sottomettere l'altra) visto che interconnette le economìe e le rende indispensabili l'una all'altra. Gli USA sn il più grande mercato per i prodotti cinesi e la Cina è il più grande fornitore di manodopera e manufatti di largo consumo, che permette ai cittadini americani di comprare molto a poco prezzo. Una guerra nn avrebbe senso, se nn per accaparrarsi risorse energetiche, ma il problema dell'energìa dovrà comunque essere risolto in maniera definitiva e radicale nei prossimi decenni, probabilmente grazie all'energìa nucleare da fusione.|`|6PM5XUqsaa	Si è probabile.... la cina cresce insieme alla sua economia, anche se non attua uno sfruttametno sostenibile...

axg3xc71aa	History would be a great place to look for your introduction to politics. If you look at the governments of the past you can see what has worked, and what has not worked. Communism is where the government owns all business, and property. Capitalism is where all business and property. Socialism, and what we have, a mixed economy and both in between. In my humble view when you look at where communism and socialism have gone, it seems logical that capitalism would be a much better system than what we know have.|`|2a9MLpZRaa	Well, if you really look like your picture I'm sure you'll have no problem.|`|IWlPfk1raa	simply the constitution don't get sucked into the political party ****
MbNuYLjJaa	We are tired of watching this country go down the drain because of lazy complainers that want a free ride.<br>  <br>  The socialist philosophy is; "If you have wealth, you must have taken it away from someone."<br>  <br>  The capitalist philosophy is; "If you have wealth, you must have created it."<br>  <br>  Socialism has never worked over the long term in any society that have practiced it.<br>  <br>  The US began implementing socialist policies with the creation of the Internal Revenue Service in 1913. Next there was the creation of the welfare state under FDR in the 30's and 40's requiring every employed person to have a number (social security number) and the US economy has been in decline ever since. The initial benefit of FDR's New Deal was that the economy was stimulated after having been through WW1 and the stock market crash of 1929. Because of this, over time, citizens began to look to the federal government more and more for everyday monetary disbursements from the treasury and that has piled up a national debt which is now in the trillions.<br>  <br>  The former USSR was communist which is much more restrictive than socialism and their communist system came tumbling down in 1991. Socialist countries should learn from this that less government restriction and more private ownership is better for any economy. Capitalism in its true form allows creative entities to amass great wealth with little or no government restrictions|`|dc426f970c639d1ac063198436886c5baa	Of course, the media is in it all for the ratings.  I voted for Obama but personally listened to the opposition AND the one's in support of Obama because I figured that somewhere in the middle I could find the truth.<br>  <br>  The real question is, why would an Obama hater believe a media outlet calling the stimulus bill "pork" when they bashed that same media outlet for telling lies in support of Obama just a few months ago?  Why would they assume they are suddenly telling "the truth" now?  And what exactly IS the truth?  I don't even watch the news stations and I don't really read the major news websites for political news.  I go to the extremist sites on BOTH sides.  Regardless of what anyone says about the extremist sites you can generally find out the TRUTH by checking them out.  Extremist sites that can just post their version of "the truth" generally have no real special interests so they generally don't care to hide the dirty details that CNN, FOX, MSNBC, etc tend to hide.<br>  <br>  These stations LOVE the doom and gloom of anything because, let's face it, doom and gloom sells!  I remember a reporter in New Orleans a few years ago doing personal interviews with normal people presenting their version of the living Hell.  A lady came on talking 100% positive about how wonderful it was that people were helping them rebuild.   For 3 straight minutes she carried on about the GOOD things going on.  The whole time the reporter kept trying to inject a negative angle.  "Yes, but there is just too much work to be done!  These poor people are..."  The lady grabs the mic and says "Yes, but we will rebuild.  I just wanted everyone to know that things ARE looking up here and it's NOT all bad."  The reporter was just so flustered he couldn't talk.  It was at this point that I was glad my dream of being an on location reporter never came to light.  I wouldn't want to always have to work to find the bad in everything around me.|`|AA10761951	The media is all owned by corporations.  General Electric, a major defense contractor, owns NBC, CNBC, and MSNBC.  Time Warner owns CNN. Viacom owns CBS.  Disney owns ABC.  And the News Corporation (Chairman being Rupert Murdoch) owns Fox, the Wall Street Journal, the New York Post, and many other media outlets throughout the world. <br>  <br>  There is no liberal media.  All the media is corporate owned.  They're all huge companies that are looking to make a profit.  Fox talks about the liberal media to get you to stop watching everyone else and only watch them.<br>  <br>  And if the New York Times is so liberal, why were they the ones to break the story about Clinton's involvement in the Whitewater Scandal during the 1992 U.S. presidential campaign?  The New York Times is not liberal.  They're just honest.|`|fc9c5ac698b0813fa1de35f84e7cf006aa	MSNBC is liberal, Fox is conservative, CNN is moderate, most national media is liberal and most all news papers are owned by the same people who do The New York Times which is liberal, but local media tends to be a lot more conservative.<br>  <br>  All that aside, the media was just doing it's job in presenting both sides of the issue on the stimulus bill.  They're basically saying that it's pork  and they actually did give evidence that it's just money going out to several different programs and the argument is that they could have created more jobs with a lot less money because a lot of the money isn't going to job creation which was suppose to be the point of the bill.<br>  <br>  A huge chunk is going to public schools, which isn't a bad thing, but that's just a general example, there's some money going to good stuff and some money going to programs that would normally be considered pork if it was attached to another bill, which is why they call it pork disguised as a bill.|`|KrqhgHFLaa	That is a loaded question, because it makes the assumption that "the media" did not support the plan.

T8nap2Pnaa	Well, you won't be qualifying for any investors' visas on $50,000, so for the moment, you'd probably be better off trying for an H1b skilled employment visa. If you've been working outside the US for a company that has US offices or a subsidiary, then maybe an L1. Given the current state of the economy either could be problematic at the moment, and normally it's harder to get an H1b as their subject to quota limitations. Then again, there's always the Diversity Visa Lottery, chances are slim, but it's free to enter.

It is not uncommon for this type of lawsuit to happen during a campaign.  In 2000, a lawsuit was brought to disqualify Cheney as a vice presidential candidate by trying to prove he was a Texan and, therefore, could not be VP with a president who is a Texan.  It was thrown out.<br>  <br>  Obama has presented a real birth certificate.  |`|b32jC7pGaa	Berg sued the US Government, claiming that the United States Government was behind 9/11. The guy is nuts!|`|IslZC6uEaa	Here's Berg's logic.<br>  <br>  Berg stated that he filed Requests for Admissions on September 15, 2008 with a response by way of answer or objection had to be served within thirty [30] days. No response to the Requests for Admissions was served by way of response or objection. Thus, all of the Admissions directed to Obama and the DNC are deemed “ADMITTED.” Therefore, Obama must immediately withdraw his candidacy for President.<br>  <br>  So, with his logic, I can file a lawsuit against Berg, on any frivolous basis, give him 30 days to respond to my satisfaction, and if he doesn't, he is admitting to all of my charges.

AA11729751	There is a huge, dense concentraton of people living around DC. I have lived there for 10 years in the past, and that northern virginia crowd is weird.

HiiO0oHEaa	Coach2, the extraordinary thing about individuals is that because they are unique, they all contribute different things to a conversation, and to life, and to the growth of their children.<br>  <br>  It may come as no surprise therefore that BOTH parents contribute to the upbringing of their children, regardless of their role in "bread-winning" or home-making. While responsible and concerned single parents are also fully able to bring their child or children up successfully, having two parents contributing to the mental and physical welfare of a child is a biological advantage.<br>  <br>  And one more thing. It has become apparent that many people of a particular political leaning are starting to use the term "liberal" as a kind of derogatory label. This I believe comes from a position of ignorance, so I am happy to help out by supplying the dictionary definition of "liberal". Hopefully, this will clear up in your mind what liberal actually means.<br>  <br>  "lib·er·al<br>  li-b(er-)ral<br>  Etymology:<br>  Middle English, from Anglo-French, from Latin liberalis suitable for a freeman, generous, from liber free; Greek eleutheros free<br>  <br>  1 a: marked by generosity, openhanded b: given or provided in a generous and openhanded way c: ample<br>  2 broad-minded ; especially : not bound by authoritarianism, orthodoxy, or traditional forms; favoring, or based upon the principles advocating or associated with the with ideals of individual especially economic freedom, greater individual participation in government, and constitutional, political, and administrative reforms designed to secure these objectives<br>  <br>  synonyms - generous , bountiful , munificent, given freely and unstintingly,openhandedness in the giver, generous, warmhearted readiness to give more than size or importance of the gift, unremitting giving or providing"|`|gR0i6w82aa	Hillary Clinton was the bread winner in their family also.

tVUJUKWkaa	Look, I know everyone has different opinions about gay marriage and gay rights, but the point is, Sean Penn shouldn't have said anything about that during his acceptance speech.

I was irritated enough that he won, that just made it so much worse!|`|sgua3lH6aa	Sean Penn is full of himself.  He hates everything then accuses everyone else of hate.  He cannot just make a gracious acceptance speech because maybe he doesn't think that entertaining people is enough.  He says he feels "proud to be in a country who can elect Obama".  Well, this is the same country that elected W twice and he was not so proud then.  He probably believes in world peace, but cannot refrain from slugging a photographer.

If you don't agree, wy not write back to calmly correct things in the report.  Tell them things like instead of occasional they are chronic, almost on a daily basis.  But stick to facts and don't go wild or get argumentative.  <br>  <br>  I can't figure out why you are so upset and want to sue or legally do something to the doctor.  So I figure you must be deprived of something because of this report.  <br>  <br>  Whether there is anything legally to do, I don't know as you don't give enough information.  As to the occasional or chronic, that is a matter of opinion and you should straighten it out.  It is the decadence'sis.  I don't know that there is anything to be done other than to attempt to correct the record.<br>  <br>  If you are denied some benefit or pension or something, then you do have to appeal a number of times.  You may find that you can get your own doctor to rebut it as well in that case.<br>  <br>  First, send a letter rebutting the inaccuracies.  Then if it is not corrected and you were denied something, see an attorney to find out what actin you can take to get whatever you want. You may have a right to selet a doctor and dispute it|`|z8kAKvGKaa	You may want to contact the medical board and they will guide you on your rights in addressing this issue and that is whom you contact to file a formal complaint about a physician or you can contact a lawyer and have them do all the work.  Hope that helps.|`|cbWfIKaYaa	You have the right to obtain a copy of your medical record to look it over for errors and then have any errors corrected. You cannot however go through and change the story of your life. The doctor must follow confidentiality and therefore you have no worries about him telling everyone what he wrote. In all actuality it was just a second opinion, and obviously not one you liked, so don't use this doctor again and go seek a third opinion elsewhere.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Go to this doctor's office and ask for a copy of your medical record with them. They will get it to you right away or in a couple days depending on where, and how they store the records. Then look it over for accuracy. Highlight anything you find that is incorrect and go back to them and tell them you found errors and you would like your record corrected. This doctor cannot release your medical record without your permission, you can make sure a note stating this is put in  your record because usually doctors can give each other information from your different records without asking you first.

There is a pretty high chance that he will die in office if he is elected. <br>  <br>  Palin has not accomplished much of anything (the supposed gas pipeline plan you mention has not in fact happened, will not even begin for several years and may never happen. She is anti-science, anti-education, a climate change denier, anti-environment, andcompletely ignorant of military, foreign affairs, economics, urban issues, agriculture issues, the function of the federal government. Like many people I think it would be a good idea to have someone who knows about these things, or at least has a track record in law, the federal government and in creating and managing a large campaign involving many millions of dollars and thousands of workers while undergoing the most aggressive possible examination.  <br>  <br>  Unlike 40% of Americans in the latest poll, I don't think Palin is actually stupid or evil, but there is no way she should be a heartbeat away from the Presidency. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  |`|MqXbtvP9aa	Because all the experts in her own party think she is a dim wit|`|nuOt5017aa	people dont like her because she is hot

(The "federal reserve" keeps no reserves, by the way... and it is not federal; no more so than McDonald's). <br>  <br>  The reasoning given for this mass-production of useless money was - as it is, now - that we needed more money to stimulate a sagging economy. <br>  <br>  The difference is that, then, we were talking hundreds of millions - occasionally billions. This time, we're hearing hundreds of Billions and the word "Trillion" rolls of the lips of politicians who act like they actually have some concept of what that even means. <br>  <br>  The most powerful dread-pump for me, though, is Joseph Biden. Obama isn't my hero but I don't fear the guy. Biden, though, (as you know) actually wrote a "Patriot-Act" type bill with graver assaults against our rights, powers, protections, privacy and Liberties than the 2001 Patriot Act and even the ACLU noticed it. <br>  <br>  His Omnibus Counterterrorism Act failed (Thank God!) though much of it was passed under the name "Effective Death Penalty...[something]" and signed into law by Clinton. <br>  <br>  We have one final weapon if we choose to use it: Unity against Unconstrained Governmental Power. Until we all - Democrats and Republicans - accept that most of our Senators and Reps care nothing for the things we voters consider essential, we're not likely to see eye to eye much less unite. <br>  <br>  So, please, identify the enemy, Dems and Repubs. Please accept that we've come full circle since 1776; that our greatest danger among all common enemies is governmental abuse of power. <br>  <br>  Our ancestors who braved the American Revolutionary War as defenders - all of whom risked death, many taken by it - would never have secured and bequeathed this Legacy of Liberties to us had they not identified their neighbor as ally and tyranny as foe. <br>  <br>  Time is short. In 2010, fire the Congress - Senate and House of Reps - and replace them with real people sworn to demand Congressional term limits, mandatory transparency of government and a "Citizen's Veto" to strike down any item of any bill/law we find to be unconscionable. <br>  <br>  ...

Palin officially moved to Juneau, so when she went home to her house in Wasilla, she was "traveling," and received "per diem" payment for her expenses such as food.  <br>  <br>  Per diems are a normal part of covering someone's costs when they travel for business -- it's expensive to live out of a hotel, and not reasonable to expect someone to cook their own meals on the road.

To answer your question, about 16% of my income is "spread around" through federal taxes, plus about 9% through social security.  George W. Bush is also "spreading your wealth around", and John McCain is promising to as well.  "Spreading your wealth around" is the governments job.  Every government in the history of man has taxed it's citizens.  That tax is used to pay for, at the very least, military incomes, and is typically used to fund social programs amongst other things in the best interests of the citizenry.  This is spreading the wealth around.  If you don't want your wealth spread around, you better give up your right to drive on public roads, use any government programs, not accept social security or medicare in your retirement, the right of American's to fight wars, research for a cure to many drugs, and everything else the government pays for.  You better never again go to a public school or allow your children to, or ever visit a library or museum.<br>  George Bush redistributed wealth in 2001 and 2003 when he gave huge tax breaks to people with specific incomes and neglected giving similar tax breaks to other incomes.  Obama is merely doing the opposite, and canceling the tax breaks Bush passed and writing new tax breaks for people who were neglected in the past 8 and 6 years, with the addition of tax credits for some others.

O5DZvc0Xaa	I never met TJ, but I know he was a constitutionalist who supported states rights and opposed private central banks. He would never vote for a CFR member. So that eliminates McCain and Obama (a.k.a. McBama).<br>  <br>  He would have most likely been a Paul supporter, so maybe he would vote Baldwin (Constitution Party) because Paul endorsed him.<br>  <br>  As some other answerers pointed out, he would also probably advocate a second revolution to take back the government from the private bankers. <br>  <br>  He would at least try to do it peacefully first... of course... because TJ was a very soft-spoken and reasonable man. But "when you make peaceful revolution impossible you make violent revolution inevitable."|`|83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	Tough question because he was a slave owner and treated his slaves rather badly, but on the other hand he was very much anti-government. He would have hated George Bush with a passion because of all the big government power grabs that Bush promoted. On the other hand, he was very much in favor of education and very much against the military, so I dont think he could have supported McCain. Obama's academic credentials would have impressed him, and he would have liked the expertise that Obama has in regard to the Constitution.<br>  <br>  I think he would have considered this a pretty unappetizing set of choices, but bottom line I would guess that Jefferson would have voted for Obama or Nader. Definitely not Barr. |`|2xdbxlT7aa	reality? he was a smart man and would know that Barr couldnt win but thats where his phiolosophy would more likely lie.

No to Obama. By the way, Thomas Jefferson said in his autobiography:"Nothing is more certainly written in the book of fate than that these people [Negroes] are to be free. Nor is it less certain that the two races, equally free, cannot live in the same government. Nature, habit, opinion has drawn indelible lines of distinction between them. It is still in our power to direct the process of emancipation and deportation peaceably and in such slow degree that the evil will wear of insensibly, and their place be...pari passau filled up by free White laborers. If on the contrary it is left to force itself on, human Nature must shudder at the prospect held up." <br>  <br>  McCain is Mr. Amnesty  (amnesty for 35 million Third Word illegal aliens), and both he and Obama push the foreign policy agenda of the American Israel Political Affairs Committee (foreign entanglements). No to McCain.<br>  <br>  Barr also reversed himself and aligned with the Libertarian Party on immigration...meaning he doesn't want it restricted. He also began his campaign by telling folks who advocate for the interests of White Americans "Don't let the door hit you on the way out". No to Barr.<br>  <br>  Nader is the best of the choices...but I think Thomas Jefferson would have sided with Ron Paul. We need to take our country back.|`|AA10288887	I believe Thomas Jefferson would pen a one-page letter saying how the entire federal government has become tyrannical and it's our duty as citizens and human beings to cast off the bonds of the central government to create a more limited one.|`|AA11352682	He'd probably rip up the Declaration of Independence and Constitution and give the country back to the British!|`|6tqGKoREaa	I think Jefferson would go back to heaven and say "You guys said they couldn't f.... it up but from what I just saw, they did it above our wildest dreams."  |`|HTimojDiaa	Jefferson would blow his brains out if he saw what the US has come to.|`|4pM3jlzwaa	Barr, but he may vote McCain because of Palin.|`|ToGm77KUaa	He would start over!|`|AA11702773	Ouch.<br>  <br>  I think he'd vote Libertarian usually, but might vote for Nader over Barr, as individuals.<br>  <br>  But that is because I really don't trust Barr.

Will they brave long lines to vote?<br>  <br>  Additionally, the republicans' 2002 "Help America Vote Act" makes every state work like Catherine Harris's Florida. Each state has a single person in charge of defining what constitutes an invalid registration.<br>  <br>  In Colorado, the GOP secretaries of state have removed over 20% of the registered voters in the state over mismatches with other state databases. Maybe in one database you are listed with a middle name of "Scott" and in another with "S." A republican hack would call that a mismatch and kick you off the registered rolls.<br>  <br>  Count that Dem leaning swing state for McCain, IMO.<br>  <br>  In Ohio a Dem Secretary of State has taken an extremely liberal view of things and has removed only the obvious fraudulent mismatches. That, combined with progressive same day registration/voting laws, is why a very racist swing state like Ohio might actually go to Obama. (Not really counting on that either, though.)<br>  <br>  Disenfranchisement in a lot of swing states and total ignorance by the Obama voters on how long the lines will be on election day and the amount of vote challenging that they will run into if they wait until election day to vote and how strong the racist segment of McCain's support will be, will probably make the race very close.|`|83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	Yes, and the Pew poll shows Obama up 53% to 39%.

As long as it is done through the proper channels and is above board I dont have an issue.  <br>  <br>  If it is a small cafe giving free breakfasts to one or two coppers to turn a blind eye to something dodgy going off in the back room it is wrong.  If it is a national chain of restaurants giving 10% off to government workers which included the police it makes business sense.|`|4vLt3SqFaa	In many businesses not just police departments there is the problem of gratuities and freebies.  In mine we allow acceptance of gratuities so as to not offend the giver, but the value in any given year can not be over 50 dollars from any one person or business.<br>  <br>  Some police departments have absolute rules about acceptance but that too is imperfect because where do you draw the line.  The parents of the kid your officer pulled of the river last week come by with homemade cookies for the department, are you going to turn down their sincere and heart-felt thanks?  To turn it down would rain on their celebration of their child's saved life.<br>  <br>  These are not black and white issues.  The best one can do it to leave some flexibility in regulations and trust your officers to be appropriate and to exercise good judgment.  Good judgment is after all the number one skill you look for in an officer entrusted to take life if need be.|`|gAGnRHIUaa	The answer is yes and no! It is certainly perfectly legal to set up discounts for particular groups. However , in this ever increasingly political correct world we live in, no doubt some greedy lawyer will see an inroad to claiming discrimination against those excluded from the discounts. As for the morality / ethics of the discounts; for those in public service i.e. police etc they can be held accountable if they do indeed turn a blind eye. Though the nature of the discounts I believe could not be construed as a bribe, it is a slippery road and could lead to "bigger " discounts or even more backhanders.|`|jWTZfP4naa	yes it's unethical but low-level corruption is not nearly as worrying as cover-ups for corruptions that have already been unearthed.<br>  <br>  way i look at it, if i worked at burger king, i'd probably risk slipping my mates a free burger when they stopped by. As a policeman i'd probably let a fellow officer of a speeding offence. <br>  <br>  I know it's not right, but i probably would. most of us are pretty susceptible to this sort of corruption. <br>  <br>  But i'd be tempted to rat out a burger king colleauge who was dipping their hand in the till, just as i'd blow the whistle on a fellow police officer who was abusing citizen's civil rights.<br>  <br>  Look at the Metropolitan when Jean Charles de Menezes was shot. they covered each other so efficiently that a court finally ruled that nothing was anybody's fault, and whilst it could be proven that people were lying publicly at the time and later perjuring themselves in court, nobody could really be charged with anything.<br>  <br>  Watch politicians when one of them gets caught with their hand in the till. to incriminate one is to incriminate all so they back each other up, or stop bullets with less important colleagues.<br>  <br>  a blind-eye is as insignificant as a white-lie but there is a very fine line between minor corruption and major.<br>  <br>  perhaps drawing a legal distinction would help to cease such reprehensible behaviour.|`|XoOanmdraa	its not ethincal but perfectly legal|`|N8cAwzxzaa	Anyone working for the NHS gets discounts too.

The commissioned officers have ten different ranks.   <br>  <br>  Warrant officers have some technical skill that gets them the extra respect over the enlisted troops.   Commissioned officers have a college education which gets them placed over the enlisted troops and warrant officers.<br>  <br>  A 2Lt is new to the service.  After he knows a little bit of what is going on he gets promoted to 1Lt.   Sometimes that takes 2 years.   It is almost an automatic promotion.  You really have to be a screw up not to get promoted to 1Lt.   <br>  <br>  |`|npMVWV7raa	Warrant Officers exists in all branches except in the USAF. They are prior enlisted. They are specialized in a particular field and give advice to the CO and other Officers. If need be, they are also authorized to take command of a unit. My CO in my company is currently a Chief Warrant Officer 4. Warrant Officers can fly in the Army but not in the USMC. A bachelors degree is not mandatory although it won't hurt you to have one. To be a pilot in the USMC you must be a commissioned officer. <br>  For commissioned officers like 2nd and 1st Lt's, more emphasis is focused on leadership skills and having some knowledge in various fields in addition to their MOS. To be commissioned as 2nd Lt you must have completed OCS and graduate with a BA or BS degree. Once their training is complete 2nd and 1st Lts can serve as Staff Officers and platoon leaders. In the case of some 1st LTs  and mostly (Capts), they usually serve as Executive Officers. Commissioned Officers don't salute Warrant Officers or enlisted unless they are Medal of Honor recipients.<br>  <br>  You would address Warrant Officers by their rank and last name. For example if you want to address a Warrant Officer 1, just address him/her as warrant officer (name.) For Chief Warrant Officers, you address them as Chief Warrant Officer (2-5, depending on service) and their last name. Chief Warrant Officers specializing in employing infantry wpns are address as "Gunner" then last name. They will have the rank of a bursting bomb on their collar (for USMC.)<br>  <br>  The link below is good at explaining the duties and qualification of warrant officers of all services.|`|LxysyuUUaa	Warrant Officer are Pilots in the arm forces.

Thank you.|`|c34895fb3078ed6b839d8ec9443a9ab2aa	A Warrant officer literally has his/her authority by "Warrant" rather than being "Commissioned" by the President-which is where officers derive their authority.<br>  Typically Warrant officers have a specialized knowledge and/or ability.  In order to differentiate them from senior enlisted, they are made WOs.  Currently, in the Army at least, the majority of WOs are aircrew, but there are some in Special Forces as well.<br>  AFA Lieutenants, 2nd Lieutenant is lowest officer rank-i.e., the newest officer.  After two years of satisfactory service, one is promoted to 1st Lieutenant.  A 1Lt is senior to a 2Lt and therefore a 2Lt would salute; however, there IS a tradition known as "lieutenants' courtesy" and Lts normally don't salute each other.   Typically a 1Lt will be given more responsibility than a 2Lt, though that would depend on the Lt(s) concerned.|`|a0cb768a2bcdc7a915356d5a5db75704aa	Warrant officers are mostly enlisted Sgt's who went into a specific field of work in the Army.

There would be no point in polling equal numbers of Dems and Reps. That would give a wildly distorted result.<br>  <br>  On Real Clear Politics they have a list of all the different polls - there are at least 18 or 19 different ones run by different news organizations, commercial market research companies, universities and public interest groups. As of today EVERY ONE has Obama in the lead. The last poll that showed McCain in the lead was done three weeks ago when he was 2% ahead.

There is where you will find the real difference in the numbers and the direction of any election.<br>  In this election, there is a statement by most news agencies that Obama has double digit leaders in most areas.<br>  <br>  The other thing to recognize is the advance vote in the United States in some states.

In regard to the first question, while I cannot say a President "fixed" my life, I do give credit to Clinton for making it better. If not for the condition of the economy and mortgage rates I would not own my home, and more importantly, if not for changes at a federal level in laws related to children taken into protective custody in response to abuse and how long it takes before parental rights are terminated. My son is adopted and if not for these and other important changes in federal laws we would not have him, he would have likely grown up in foster care. Clinton may not have been much of a husband, be he made it possible for me to be one heck of a father!!

AA12245463	Obama & Friends: Judge Not?<br>  By Charles Krauthammer<br>  Friday, October 10, 2008; Page A19 <br>  <br>  ...associations are important. They provide a significant insight into character. They are particularly relevant in relation to a potential president as new, unknown, opaque and self-contained as Obama. With the economy overshadowing everything, it may be too late politically to be raising this issue. But that does not make it, as conventional wisdom holds, in any way illegitimate. <br>  <br>  Had any white presidential candidate had a close 20-year association with a white preacher overtly spreading race hatred from the pulpit, that candidate would have been not just universally denounced and deemed unfit for office but written out of polite society entirely. <br>  <br>  Would you attend a church whose pastor was spreading racial animosity from the pulpit? Would you even shake hands with -- let alone serve on two boards with -- an unrepentant terrorist, whether he bombed U.S. military installations or abortion clinics? <br>  <br>  Would you attend a church whose pastor was spreading racial animosity from the pulpit? Would you even shake hands with -- let alone serve on two boards with -- an unrepentant terrorist, whether he bombed U.S. military installations or abortion clinics? <br>  <br>  Second, and even more disturbing than the cynicism, is the window these associations give on Obama's core beliefs. He doesn't share the Rev. Wright's poisonous views of race nor Ayers's views, past and present, about the evil that is American society. But Obama clearly did not consider these views beyond the pale. For many years he swam easily and without protest in that fetid pond. <br>  <br>  Until now. Today, on the threshold of the presidency, Obama concedes the odiousness of these associations, which is why he has severed them. But for the years in which he sat in Wright's pews and shared common purpose on boards with Ayers, Obama considered them a legitimate, indeed unremarkable, part of social discourse. <br>  <br>  Do you? Obama is a man of first-class intellect and first-class temperament. But his character remains highly suspect. There is a difference between temperament and character. Equanimity is a virtue. Tolerance of the obscene is not. <br>  <br>  letters@charleskrauthammer.com <br>  .|`|LJkPRqN0aa	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Glyla5R7B8" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Glyla5R7...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  you decide for yourself....|`|AA10084471	This is a completely phony issue.  Obama's birth certificate is public, and you can see it on the web.  And many Presidents in the past have not had birth certificates.  And each state has a different form of birth certificate, which changes over the years (and also, a different form in which the nformation is presented when requested later.)  There is no such thing as a single "long form" and "short form" of a birth certificate.<br>  <br>  There is no serious person who has any question that Obama was born in the US.<br>  <br>  Just as we all know that McCain was NOT born in the US, but that it doesn't matter.<br>  <br>  <br>  The country would be better off if all this energy was put into understanding the issues facing the next President, and planning to vote on that basis.<br>  <br>  Here is an investigation into the matter by factcheck.org --  <a href="http://www.factcheck.org/elections-2008/born_in_the_usa.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.factcheck.org/elections-2008/...</a><br>  <br>  The factcheck investigators went to Hawaii, and inspected the actual physical official document.<br>  <br>  They also posted this which provides even further evidence that Obama was born in Hawaii -- there was a birth announcement in the Honolulu paper at the time:<br>  <br>  In late July, a researcher looking to dig up dirt on Obama instead found a birth announcement that had been published in the Honolulu Advertiser on Sunday, Aug. 13, 1961:<br>  <br>  [There is a picture on the website]<br>  <br>  The announcement was posted by a pro-Hillary Clinton blogger who grudgingly concluded that Obama "likely" was born Aug. 4, 1961 in Honolulu.<br>  <br>  [Factcheck.org is a non-partisan journalistic enterprise of the Annenberg Public Policy Center.  Walter Annenberg was the conservative publisher of TV Guide and a friend of Ronald Reagan and ambassador under Reagan.  If you poke around the factcheck.org site you will see various claims made by Obama criticized, as well claims made against Obama.]<br>  <br>  [The best post so far is the one below that thinks a "Certificate of Live Birth" is something different than a birth certificate.]|`|b90f0a4c32cc3dde140d446b8bb1d11aaa	Not one media outlet has done any investigation on him...They are giving him a pass that no other presidential candidate got.  Obama also has not released all his past medical records; he also has not released any papers from Harvard Law School, any thesis; and also and his records from Columbia.  So...he has gotten a pass and no one and I mean no one has done an investigation that should be done.  He has been very secretive; and has only released some papers when pressured...but he is still getting a pass...To me he is not qualified; no foreign policy experience; the most liberal record in the senate; a man who has associated with suspect friends that hate America; that are criminals; that are unrepentant terrorists; he has a Socialist agenda which will change America forever...So...qualified?  I don't think so.|`|A0825FVZaa	No he was born in Kenya, his paternal grandmother verified that. He is in Hawaii now checking around granny's condo to see what he can come up with.

y0jkVO2Aaa	Birds of a feather flock together......|`|E9XL5x3Paa	It could be simple demographics.<br>  <br>  <br>  Both are strongly Hispanic, which both Republicans and Democrats can get based on which beliefs they press more strongly.  Hispanics overall tend to be highly religious, which could side them with Republicans based on their opposition to abortion and gay marriage.  But Hispanics also tend to be turned off by the highly volatile nature of the fight against illegal immigration.<br>  <br>  Republicans may only have a problem with illegal immigrants, but they believe every Hispanic is an illegal immigrant.  So while they are not racist, they may as well be.  Democrats are known for backing the working class, and Hispanics are mostly working class.  These things together should side Hispanics with Democrats.<br>  <br>  Yet, a highly Hispanic California sides liberal and a highly Hispanic Texas sides Republican.  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The only other real differences between the two are that California tends to be more "big-city," whereas Texas is more rural.  Big population states tend to side Liberal; but Texas is so big that even with its big population it is still more rural.  That may be where the difference comes in.<br>  <br>  And the last difference is the Bible Belt.  Texas is part of it; whereas California, while full of believers in Christianity, tends to be more accepting of other lifestyles.  But why is California more accepting of alternative lifestyles?|`|1NO10YfPaa	Mostly tradition.

But I do have a counter-argument to his.<br>  <br>  "Liberals" tend to be better educated.  They know the difference between "breath" and "breathe", "affect" and "effect", etc.  <br>  <br>  Apparently your stagnant well water is not doing wonders for your brain development.

A lot of it does come down to metro versus retro.  Certainly Texas does have its metropolitan areas and California does have rural areas, but for the most part, Texas is more rural whereas California is more metropolitan.<br>  <br>  People who live in more heavily populated areas tend to have more concern for health and safety, they tend to be more secular, they view things like guns to be more of a problem than a solution, they are less opposed to the idea of expanding government to take control of matters viewed as otherwise unmanageable, etc.  Whereas people in rural areas have a disdain for the big-city-elected government officials telling them what they can or can't do, they view secularism as a threat to their Christian values, they feel that gun ownership is important to defending their property and freedom, they view taxation and social programs as forced redistribution of wealth, etc.  <br>  <br>  I am personally more liberal than I am conservative, though I am neither Democrat nor Republican.  I do not see either side as being "right" or "wrong" -- it depends on one's point of view.  What may be "right" for people in a progressive metropolitan region, may not be right for people living in a more rural small-town community.  There truly are "two Americas", and both sides think the other side is completely bonkers.  <br>  <br>  Unfortunately, so many people in this country are incapable of comprehending points of view that differ from their own, so they automatically assume that their opponents are "brainwashed" or "ignorant".  They fail to realize that there are compelling arguments for both points of view, and at the end of the day, it all comes down to opinion.  <br>  <br>  It is hard to either prove or disprove, for example, the effects of either tax cuts or federal spending on the economy as a whole (note correct usage of the word "effects").  Both could potentially benefit the economy, just as either one could potentially be just a pointless waste of money.  If you need a job, for example, filling an open government position could be the perfect fix for you.  On the other hand, if you're a small business owner who is looking to expand, a tax cut could be the perfect fix for you.  But nothing is ever going to please all of the people all of the time.<br>  <br>  At times I have wondered if maybe the Civil War should never have happened.  Perhaps the southern states should have been allowed to secede.  Slavery would have been abolished in the south eventually (it would have been inevitable as the world came into the 20th century), and that's where most of the "red" states tend to be anyway.  That way, the rural southern red states could have their conservative government, while the metropolitan blue states in the north and westernmost parts of the country could have their liberal government.  The liberals in the "red" nation could simply relocate to the "blue" nation, while the conservatives in the "blue" nation could relocate to the "red" nation.  There would literally be TWO Americas, and everyone would be happy.  At least, happier than they are now.  Plus, we would never have had to deal with some of the drawbacks of being a world superpower, as neither side would have had the power, military might, and resources to become one on their own.  It could have saved us a lot of headaches.<br>  <br>  But then, it could have caused us a lot of problems as well.  I guess when it comes down to it, there is strength in our diversity of thought.  Both sides have contributed much to building America into the nation that it is today.  Some for the better, some for the worse.  But all of that is debatable, and subject to opinion.  When all is said and done, it takes both liberals and conservatives to make America strong.  It takes both metro AND rural viewpoints and contributions.  It's all part of the melting pot mentality.  <br>  <br>  I just wish there wasn't such bitter division between the two sides... if only we could realize that everybody grew up differently, learning different things about the world and being taught different points of view, and that people on the opposite side of the political spectrum|`|nSgo6oVGaa	I think it's the air and water.  Conservatives tend to have fresh clean air to breath and clean water to drink.  Liberals do not and it effects their brain development negatively.

U9XlITtHaa	Yes there is a large elephant standing in the corner. It's called the double standard. Nowadays it seems to be OK for blacks to be racist. Call them out on it when it happens and don't just meekly submit to it. Racism is wrong no matter what color the person is who is doing it.|`|X9Ws9nToaa	I'm black, there 2 things- get on there level or kill them with kindness. I belive in the bible, but I will not turn the other cheek. But protect ur kids first.|`|2932956ec7662d7544675f368775f540aa	In my area some years ago they began the Section 8 business at apartments here, and that has resulted in home invasions, muggings, car and property stolen , trash and garbage in the streets and over all destruction of what was once a safe, clean White neighborhood. This has and is the pattern over the whole nation. I have been insulted, cursed and treated with contempt and rudeness in the stores (where now it is mostly Black employees) and on the streets ONLY because I am White. What is occurring is that I Have become a RACIST in response to the Hard Core Racism of Blacks toward Whites, and I am not alone as other Whites in this area feel exactly the same for the exact same reasons.|`|MbNuYLjJaa	Some of the most racist people I know are the ones that are always looking for a handout and blaming all their problems on their race. You know the type. <br>  They want to live in a nice neighborhood and send their kid to a good school, but when they move into our affluent neighborhood they bring their bad habits and bad attitudes and turn our neighborhood into the hate filled ghetto that they left. The rest of us move out and our old neighborhood becomes the new ghetto. <br>   <br>  One bright sunny day I saw a car driven by a black guy in front of me at the intersection near my house. The light turned green and just as he took off he opened his driver door and dropped a large bag of paper trash on the street and buzzed off quickly. The papers and trash blew everywhere. I beeped my horn so he would know that I saw and disapproved. I was stunned that someone could stoop that low.<br>  <br>  The simple will continue to be simple.<br>  <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=24&chapter=1&verse=22&version=50&context=verse" rel="nofollow">http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?boo...</a>|`|sLEdPDkHaa	you can get bad customer service from any race your town just sounds like LA in the 60s (my family lived in Compton when it was a white neighborhood and watched it turn into a black one)|`|g0lKlQGnaa	Yep<br>  <br>  It's the ever increasing double standard.....|`|EenbVs8Oaa	Black people flaunt their racism in the face of everyone all the time.  The more this happens, the more the double standard will make people of other colors, especially whites resent it.<br>  <br>  Racism is a shameful business, and ALL races need to be shamed when it dominates their culture.  Shame worked for most of white america, but I see that progress eroding thanks in large part to black america and latino america using the race card in every debate on any subject.<br>  <br>  AG Holder called this country cowards when it came to race, I assumed he meant the black community.|`|z2XCCrxqaa	I noticed this in the big city I live by, but now that our property taxes have gone up, and people lost their mortgages, it's going back to how it was when I first moved here in 1989, with a lot of empty houses! The stores I use to shop for deals at are way crowded, and churches are almost empty! sad :(|`|2a9MLpZRaa	If it were under the radar that would mean that I didn't see it until it was too late.  Harping on someone for bad service in a restaraunt or saying that someones racist because they have a rule I don't feel like following isn't racism.|`|E9XL5x3Paa	Who uses Afro-american anymore?<br>  <br>  <br>  Not attacking you as racist on that one, just wondering who actually uses that anymore.  For the record, they are okay with you calling them black now.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  And kids, regardless of skin color, are generally disruptive once out of class.  They still have fun, unlike most of the rest of us.<br>  <br>  And it is possible that your card may not work there.  It may be a more a electronic problem than a racism problem.  I remember working at Wal-Mart in the past, and I would tell people their card would not work; interestingly enough, because it wouldn't.<br>  <br>  There was a specific Visa gift card that one could buy at the local mall.  But the mall forgot to do something, and their card would not work at certain places like it was supposed to, including the Wal-Mart I worked at.  And I assure you, it would not work for black people any more than it would for white people, or Hispanics, Asians, or any other race or gender available.
ezQ44NqAaa	Agree,to a point.<br>  <br>  If I believed,for one minute,that those getting help from government programs were only those who could not care for themselves due to circumstances outside their control,I might have no real issues with it.But nothing could be farther from the truth.We have unknown thousands of flat out fraudulent claims by Illegals,and by people simply unwilling to work.I know of at least 4 of them myself.People on disability,because they are too fat to work,people getting services for their kids because they get pregnant every 10 months to some guy they picked up at the club,the list goes on and on.I could never live like that,but I don't have a real problem helping those who CANNOT help themselves.<br>  <br>  And now here comes Obama,and "Bailouts" and "Stimulus Plans",and now he is basically saying we even get to help pay other people's Mortgages,because they were irresponsible for the most part.<br>  <br>  So now I'm officially sick of this ****!!!<br>  <br>  AD|`|1NO10YfPaa	Yes, this is unChristian.

People like that are rude, intolerant. What if a child's mother was disabled didn't have any income other than a small check from disability?  Yes, there are some who continue to have children just so they can milk the government for more money.  There are people who abuse the system.  And those people should be stopped because they are actually preventing people who need welfare supplements from getting them.<br>  <br>  We shouldn't automatically judge people who are getting assistance.  We don't always know their situation.|`|ExCAedp4aa	That's a decidedly unChristian attitude, and I say that as a "producer" in this country. I have no problem helping those who truly can't help themselves, anyone who doesn't is inhumane. <br>  <br>  I should also point out that many who don't, also thought it was perfectly fine to wast trillions and 4,500 of our people's lives to free other people halfway across the world. Which would seem inconsistent.|`|808da1ba51e8fd80415df1fc03dcf21aaa	Agree|`|6e6fb50d87f07492879715e4526ac64daa	i think suicide is a bit extreme, but i agree with whoever wrote that.<br>  <br>  i am what would be considered a "producer" which means i get my tail end out of bed early every morning and work all day. what sickens me is the thought in the back of my head that i'm busting my butt so some lazy welfare slob can reap the fruits of my labor and the money i kill myself for ends up in crack dealer's pockets or liquor store cash registers while i struggle month by month to make ends meet. <br>  <br>  WE are the slaves of this century. the working class. where's my reparations?<br>  <br>  and for you young college liberals who sip your lattes, eat your tofu, smoke your doobs, and wear your berets with a che t shirt and bad mouth your country and praise socialism, all i have to say is wait til you grow up and mommy and daddy aren't paying your way and you have to get off your duff and get a job. <br>  <br>  let's see how much you love socialism when you're working your butt off everyday and can't afford the electric bill.|`|9HRkwzruaa	I don't agree.  This woman (from what I can tell) had no control over her husband leaving her, and apparently her financial situation changed overnight.  I would never accept welfare solely for myself - I'd just plain go without - but for my child, yes.  I'd suck it up, humble myself, and do it for the short time it would take to get back on my feet.  He's more important to me than my stupid pride.<br>  <br>  I don't think welfare should be unlimited; I think it should be an emergency situation (such as this), and that there should be caps.  I am completely disgusted with people (other than the truly disabled) who literally live off the government (i.e., my hard-earned tax dollars), but this situation is what welfare exists for.  Sometimes horrible things happen, and when a child's safety and health is on the line, you do what you have to do.|`|6V925o38aa	With the democrats in control, they are not even going to talk about this problem, because it is where they get their votes,     If a person is truly old and/ or needy is one thing but to deliberately have three children ( I think that is the quota) on welfare with no job or husband in order to get a check and a house and medicaid and food stamps, that is another|`|qlduZDO3aa	1 vote for horrified at the callous response.  WWJD, indeed...<br>  <br>  I have nothing to gain from the stimulus bill.  Being career military, my job is secure either way.  But, I understand back home in the States, they desperately need jobs.  The stimulus package isn't perfect, but it's the only game in town.|`|U9XlITtHaa	Agree.|`|6Zuvobqtaa	Sounds like the person who wrote it never had a husband who left and two kids to feed. Welfare is there for a reason. This woman used it temporarily and for a good reason. There is no shame in that. It's not an honor, but even middle class people are now going to food banks because they are in trouble.<br>  <br>  Welfare has been around before Obama came into office. Even when the republicans were in office we had welfare. <br>  <br>  Clinton started the welfare to work initiative to get people off welfare and back to work. It was a great program and reduced the amount of people who were on welfare. I don't know where the Democrats will go with welfare now, but I hardly think they will eliminate it. Besides, how we care for people who are in trouble or poor is a general reflection on our society. When times get rough it is not uncommon to see comments like this.|`|MbNuYLjJaa	I think that when an unwed mother goes to the government for support for her illegitimate child, the government should require that she send in proof that she has had a simple hysterectomy before issuing any aid to her. A simple hysterectomy can be reversed if the woman marries and wants to make a family or decides to discontinue receiving government support. The same goes for a man that will not support his child. If he wants the government to subsidize his income to raise a child, then get a simple vasectomy so the rest of us can be sure that he won't continue to dump children on the system. A vasectomy can also be reversed if the man gets a job and/or gets off government aid. I think this would be a fair way to deal with the problem of millions of children that are being dumped on the state. It would also significantly reduce the demand for abortions.<br>  <br>  If they want to act like animals and leach the system, then demand that they get fixed like the animals before they can access government aid..<br>  <br>  It is a very humane way to deal with the problem.<br>  <br>  In some Muslim cultures, a man is executed and his family is sold into slavery if he has wives and children that he cannot support.|`|ZIm5utPWaa	Okay I am a true conservative at heart, BUT there are times when people need some help. There ARE people who abuse the system and take advantage of it but sometimes things happen. <br>  <br>  I needed help in the beginning. I got pregnant. I WAS on birth control but hey, it's not 100%. I do not believe in abortion. It is murder in MY opinion. And adoption is MORE of a burden to the tax-payer then me working two jobs to support my daughter myself. Her father was useless. <br>  <br>  But there are people who will be lazy no doubt. I do believe that there should be limits. like 2 or three years. I was only on assistance for 1 year. But I worked 2 jobs and saved a got on my feet. I dont think assistance should be glorified in any way. Also I think there should be drug tests. Because that would eliminate 1/2 of the abusers. I agree it should be temporary. Not long term. And suicide? come on, if you are gonna off yourself because you have no money, who is going to pay to bury you? that's is just dumb, IF YOU REALLY need the assistance that you should ask for it, but otherwise hard work is the way to go, and living off the tax-payer is just wrong, b/c they ARE working hard to pay your bills. see what I am sayin?|`|cBNjgxW9aa	Whatever one believes about welfare, you can easily see in the first sentence that this is not an especially intelligent or thoughtful person-or something is at least going on personally with him that is clouding his ability to reason.  I quote:<br>  <br>  "If you support Obama and his socialist ilk in Congress, that can only mean you're either looking for a handout for yourself, or for a "loved" one so the government can support them instead of you having to."<br>  <br>  Obviously, a lot of people support Obama for many, many other reasons than looking for a handout.  On the face of it, this person's opening comment undermines the credibility of the remainder of his remarks.  I really don't understand why anyone thinks that this kind of tactic ever really works-it certainly doesn't influence anyone who disagrees.  But then, most people who talk and act like this aren't REALLY looking to influence, usually what they really want to do is just shoot off their mouths rather than thinking things through.  Which, when you think about it, is one of the reasons the U.S. is in such a pickle-we're all spending more time shouting at one another and pointing fingers instead of addressing the real issues and actually trying to solve problems.<br>  <br>  If you look at the essence of the comments though-the ISSUE that is really in play, it is the poster's sense of "pride."  That's what he is talking about, not welfare; he is 'successful' and 'independent...' that is the point of the post and what he really wants us to know.  Something has marginalized this person and left him feeling inadequate, so he looks for someone else to blame or look down on, and pretends a strength of character and independence that he obviously doesn't have. It could be something major-a divorce or career problems-or something minor and temporary, like his candidate didn't get elected or he just got an expensive speeding ticket...whatever it is, this is not the way that normal people express themselves, internet behavior the exception which proves the rule.  People like this have no influence, and that makes them even more angry, which perpetuates these types of ludicrous remarks-e.g. people who voted for Obama are all looking for a handout, I've never taken a government handout, I'd kill myself first...<br>  <br>  So, what this guy is saying is he never went to public school, traveled on public highways, availed himself of city services such as police and fire protection, went to the library, ate any food produced that he didn't grow himself, bought any clothing or other products made in the U.S., allowed his parents to collect social security or medicare, used a bank or currency, benefitted from the military either directly or indirectly, used any energy that he didn't generate himself, earned an hourly wage, owned his own business, watched television or a movie, saw an advertisement, or enjoyed a deep breath of clean air.<br>  <br>  What so many of us often don't seem to 'get' is that we are ALL on the government dole from cradle to grave and none of us pay in as much as we take out.  We're just mad because other people are telling us how much we have to kick in and we don't get to say who gets to take out what.  People like the one whose comments are being discussed here see what other people get as 'welfare' while he is entitled to the government benefits he receives because, from his point of view, he is entitled to everything he gets because he works harder than 'they' do.<br>  <br>  It's a total classic irony which shows up in literature again and again and again.  You don't have to be a psychologist or economist or any kind of ist whatsoever to understand how people like this think.  It's one of the underlying flaws in today's conservative and libertarian thought-not to say that there aren't equally disturbing flaws in liberal philosophies on the street nowadays.  You ask nearly any conservative or libertarian what the problem is and they say tax and spend government authority, but when you ask them to list what needs to be taken off the list of things the government spends money on, curiously enough, little to nothing that they are personally benefitting from appears on the list-because that is an 'essential' government service.  Again, liberalism suffers from its own philosophical traps, I'm just commenting on THIS particular point of view and offering my response as requested.

First, Junior said, "This is a problem that's been a long time in coming. We haven't had an energy policy in this country."<br>  <br>  This was followed by, "That's exactly what I've been saying to the American people -- 10 years ago if we'd had an energy strategy, we would be able to diversify away from foreign dependence. And -- but we haven't done that. And now we find ourselves in the fix we're in." As is so often the case, Bush was lying. <br>  <br>  Consider President Jimmy Carter's April 18, 1977 speech. Since it was given nearly three decades ago, when many of the reporters in Bush's White House were children, it's understandable that they don't remember it. But it's inexcusable that Bush and the mainstream media (which, after all, has the ability to do research) would completely ignore it. It was the speech that established the strategic petroleum reserve, birthed the modern solar power industry, led to the insulation of millions of American homes, and established America's first national energy policy. "With the exception of preventing war," said Jimmy Carter, a man of peace, "this is the greatest challenge our country will face during our lifetimes." "<br>  [End quote]<br>  <br>  Regan killed all funding into renewable resources when he took office. One of the first things he did was dismantle the solar collectors Carter had installed on the White House to conserve energy. And, he laughed about it. I remember this from my interest in solar energy at the time. I thought: "Well, there goes solar energy, down the tubes."<br>  <br>  Where the hell has the Republican party been all these years? Pushing for more and more oil, a non-renewable resource. Now they're jumping on the alternative energy bandwagon like they invented the concept.<br>  <br>  Off-shore drilling will take years to come on-line. 30 years wasted in not investing in alternative, renewable, energy sources.<br>  <br>  Also, check out this National Debt Graph:<br>  <a href="http://zfacts.com/p/318.html" rel="nofollow">http://zfacts.com/p/318.html</a><br>  <br>  [The site is having problems, so you might need to try a few times.]<br>  <br>  [quote]<br>  Double Whammy:   50-Year Record on Sept. 22.    $10 Trillion on Sept. 30, 2008.<br>  <br>  The gross national debt compared to GDP (how rich we are) reached its lowest level since 1931 as Reagan took office. It skyrocketed for 12 years through Bush I. Clinton reversed it at a peak of 67%. Bush II crossed that line on Sept. 22 and hit 69% on Sept 30. That's the highest it's been since 1955 (53 years ago).<br>  <br>  Bush did three things to skyrocket the debt from $5.7 trillion to $10 trillion:<br>  <br>  1. He lowered taxes on the rich (by far the biggest item).<br>  2. He invaded Iraq instead of winning in Afghan-Pakistan (another $600 B).<br>  3. He loosened controls on Wall Street.<br>  <br>  As it happens, McCain backed all three policies: (1) He backed Bush's tax cuts for the rich and now wants to give them bigger tax cuts. (2) He was gung-ho for the Iraq war from the start. (3) When Katie Couric asked Sarah Palin to name one time McCain suggested regulating Wall Street, she couldn't—because he never did. He crowed in the Wall Street Journal how he was always against regulation.<br>  <br>  Obama opposed the first two and said Wall St. needed regulating.<br>  [end quote]<br>  <br>  As much as people despised Clinton, he reduced the national debt and left office with a $100 B gross budget surplus. Bush II pushed the debt to over $10 Trillion with a $600+B budget deficit. Now add $1 Trillion for the bailout, and $700 B for Iraq.<br>  <br>  And people want 4 more years of Regan/Bush I/Bush II like borrow and spend economics?<br>  <br>  How is McCain going to reduce that debt without taxes? <br>  <br>  The sad thing is people have been brainwashed to believe everything will be hunky-dory.|`|CgTwW7H2aa	I came out of college in the Carter years and it took over a year to get a job. My first car loan was 17.9% and inflation was rampant. There were long lines at the gasoline pumps. Obama's proposals are eerily like Carter's and the looming recession will deepen if Obama gets his way. He was only 14 when Carter took office and probably did not know what a bad economy was like. College students of today weren't even born. American voters seem to want to learn the hard way. I remember the Carter years and they were not pretty. It took Reagan 4 years to undo the damage.

08c47ade809f8810ef2b21fa9304d450aa	Gas prices are going down partly because of lower expected demand for oil in the near future and partly because refiners are switching to the winter blend of gas (historically gas prices are more in the summer time thanks to higher demand then and because the govt. requires a cleaner summer blend then).<br>  <br>  As for the oil reserves point, it's important to think in terms of production rather then reserves.  Reserves sound important but are very difficult to ascertain and go up when oil prices go up (reserves include only the oil that you can make a profit on extracting from the ground at current prices).  Also, production goes down long before you run out, and that's just as bad because we aren't functioning on half of the oil that we're getting right now.  Production has been flat the past five years, which is another reason why oil prices have skyrocketed then.  Many think we'll see production fall and never go back up (search the web for Peak Oil for more info on this).|`|tyvFUPOxaa	Your Dad is hundreds of years short and the supply in the USA is getting greater with the new discoveries that are being aided by the improving technology of the petroleum industry and the increasing supply of ethanol.

US production reached its peak back around 1975 and has been declining since. There is no possible way that the US can supply its own oil needs even at the present level of use and production. Nor is there any hope whatsoever that any amount of drilling in US territory will ever meet our needs.  Instead of getting your information from a political blog, try reading the issues of the Oil and Gas Journal or some other industry report that contains the data on production... <br>  <br>  2. gas prices go up and down based on the free enterprise, capitalist system forces of supply and demand. OPEC doesn't set the prices - it attempts to control the prices by increasing or decreasing the supply. The price is whatever people are willing to pay, but since OPEC is not the only supplier, the OPEC efforts to control prices often fail. Since demand is down due to the terrible state of the US economy, the price will go down as well. As the economy recovers under President Obama, the price will go up. I'm sure he'll get blamed for that!  He could keep the price down by implementing Socialist policies, but most of us are not in favor of nationalizing the oil industries as President "Socialist" Bush has done for the banks.|`|472sq1BYaa	OPEC just announced they were going to slow production to stabilize prices, they are NOT liking the downturn in pricing.

If Obama couldn't answer simple questions such as, "which newspapers do you read?", then America would be questioning his qualifications just as they are questioning someone else. Most can ask the same of you, what do you see in McCain/Palin? McCain picked his VP to gain Hillary & females supporters, can you honestly sit there and tell me he chose her because she's the best choice for VP? Now what does that say about McCain?<br>  <br>  Obama/Biden '08!!|`|hR1cZhJBaa	Its funny becasue I was thinking, "how can you support McCain and his rants about nothing, or Joe the Plumber" and Palins, "Joe 6 Pack"<br>  <br>  How can you vote for them????? |`|WhlwZeiXaa	Ok here's my list that I can think of off the top of my head:<br>  -McCain wants to promote abstinence in school while Obama is promoting safe-sex practices taught in schools.  McCain is being unrealistic.<br>  -McCain wants war to last longer than Obama does.  (Palin seems to be a war-mongeror).<br>  -I like Obama's health care system better.<br>  -McCain is pro life, while I agree with Obama that it is the woman's decision what she wants to do, not some guy who doesn't know her or the situation.<br>  -I'm afraid of this country's future if for some reason McCain dies and Palin becomes President.  She'll start WW3.  <br>  <br>  The fact that he was a POW is completely irrelevant to me.  Obama isn't a terrorist.  He's just as loyal to his country.

SCzrZosXaa	Communism basically portends to put all people on equal footing when in fact it makes the leaders wealthy and the rest of the people in bondage to the state.....sound familiar, it should, it's happening here now.<br>  Most of the ex-Soviet countries are trying democratic or republican types of government, some are succeeding and some appear to falling back into the abyss of socialism/communism.<br>  Communism exalts its unemployment figures when in fact they simply make jobs for no reason. Example: Motorcycle plant in Russia made 1000 bikes per day, they only sold 300, they put the other 700 in the melter and started over the next day....full employment, yes, productive/profitable, NO.

83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	The USA had an excellent alternative energy research system set up in the late 1970s after the two oil crises of 1973 and 1979, but when Ronald Reagan became President he completely disassembled the whole system. Many thousands of scientists lost their jobs and the research centers were completely closed. <br>  <br>  That was probably one of the worst decisions of his Presidency. If he had supported them, or even just left them alone we would have an excellent alternative energy system in place right now that would supply a large proportion of our energy. Reagan was a genius compared to either Bush or McCain, but he dropped the ball on that one. |`|xUQDTEbZaa	Yes, it should have been accomplished years ago. But the Reagan/Bush eras destroyed it|`|8Qxb7OZOaa	Duchess is correct.  |`|w0JHkpxPaa	Yes, I remember that.<br>  <br>  I also remember that they said by 1980 the USA would be using the metric system!
SBBnWsJJaa	Hard...<br>  <br>  Up at 5 or so.  Make beds, PT, breakfast, training all day with a field lunch, maybe a field dinner or dinner at the mess hall, some "free" time in the evening shining your boots, sleeping at 9.  Sometimes you have to pull a fireguard shift.<br>  <br>  You usually get Sunday mornings off to go to church or wash clothes, etc.  Sunday afternoon is more training.|`|DibFrwxlaa	You have some personal time at the end of each day.  I had to spend most of mine shining my boots but you won't have to do that.  I'm sure there's some other task to replace it though.  I had time to write letters each night.  If you want you can stay up with a flashlight and write some more.<br>  <br>  But you aren't going to get time off like, "Okay Soldiers, go laze about for hours on end, we're here for you."   Sundays were the only slightly laid back day because half the platoon would go to church and the other half would stay back and clean the barracks.  But we were left alone to clean and got hours to do it so it was a lot of joking around.<br>  <br>  MP is fine.  Infantry is fine.  It's what you want.|`|gebIjqnWaa	For me basic training was the pits, Sergeants yelling at you, cussing, making you stand at attention, hurry up and wait, kp duty, making you run through fire, doing push ups, and constantly reminding you that YOU belonged to them. I had one decent sergeant, and one the devil himself. Maybe it was just my experience. Some people liked it, I didn't. Can you do 100 push ups? They love to do that to you. Be prepared. It can be hell. I'm not trying to dissuade you, just expect to be treated a lot worst then a dog. After all they want to make you a killer, not a lover. My brother was an MP. He never complained. He just drove the brass around, mostly. I found that after you get in your options are left up to them not you. It may not be as bad as all that but that was my experience. The Army is serious business, it's not a picnic. Serving your country is an honor. Keep a positive outlook.|`|L6N38iieaa	You really have no free time until the last week of basic. You spend most of your day training and at night you have an hour or so to write letters. <br>  <br>  I didn't realize it but basic was about the most fun I had in the military. Infantry is pretty rough, you spend a lot of time in the field. MP's train at Fort Knox in KY, that is where I went for basic, they also have tankers and scouts training for basic their also. Basic is what you make of it, if you go in their with an attitude you will hate it. You will have to learn to work with others and no matter what you do nothing is going to be good enough for the Drill SGTs. |`|rLDB7ZwJaa	Hellish.  I thought I would love it and it turned out to be not so great.  Keep in mind a recruiters job is to tell you how great everything will be.  I hope you do not like the person you are because when you get out you will be completely different.  |`|N3S9S1joaa	Average...I guess.|`|VT0YGdK2aa	Basic - you may get 1 hr a day of free time.  my day went like this.  wake up, go to formation, exercise, change, eat breakfast, clean barracks, go to class, training, marching, lunch, more class, lots of push ups, march some more dinner, class, showers, free time, bed.<br>  I didn't know that basic and AIT were about the same with weekend privileges and a little more free time.  An MP is a good job, and I had some friends in an infantry unit that made it sound like hell.  I was active duty and I loved my job as a 91 E but hated the lack of freedom even after I was at my duty station.  But Germany was AWESOME.  Go there if you can .|`|mxiNAKPbaa	the media makes it out to be bad <br>  the training is not what anyone thinks its like i,m not gonna say wats it like though u will have to go though it urslef to understand|`|7438d08f941feb7deb2196efaa012449aa	sorry for you! I do not want to get paid to kill myself! No matter how much I love this country!|`|2c1b0dd014b430d6f3f596a8a32e7638aa	I went to basic about a year ago. I went to Fort Jackson...and it is nothing like a regular job. Haha...time of in basic training?? No. You get an hour or so a day for personal hygiene. You get more time on the weekends though to yourself. You're allowed to go to church and all. Pretty boss there. Reception....be prepared for some serious sleep deprivation. Though once your body gets used to it it will get easier! Reception is NOT basic training, do not get it confused with that. The only way to truly know what you will expect is to just go through it. Everyones perception of how hard basic is will be different. Sometimes it is easy and sometimes it isnt. The roadmarches almost killed me, but I got through them! Weapons week is always the most fun..you get to shoot a weapon. Or maybe throwing grenades was more fun. Either way...its a once in a life time experence. |`|L8NifnIuaa	Training methods change.  What I tell you may not be the same as you experience.  When I was in, there was a high stress and a low stress training.  I was in the high stress.<br>  <br>  We got up every morning around 5am and did exercises.  Some days it was Variations on push ups and set ups and flutter kicks and what not other days we just ran.  Then we went back to the barracks and cleaned up and went to breakfast.  Then we had training.  Depending on where you are in your training cycle, you will be sitting in a class room listening to lectures or doing hands on training like taking apart weapons or putting on bandages or shooting your rifle.  On some days, you will be doing the training in or near the barracks, on other day you will be walking 2-10 miles to your training sites.  If your lucky, they will pack your *** into a cattle car and have a truck pull you to your training site.  Lunch pops up in the middle somewhere and then more training.  I never really saw a pattern to it, but some afternoons we would have exercises again.  You work and train until evening chow.  After you have been in training for a while and if you have been a good platoon of soldiers you will get some free time in the evenings.  (all it takes is one guy to screw up to ruin a whole night).  Early on in the training cycle, it is work from the time you get up to the time you go to bed.  As I recall you are only required to have 4 hours to sleep.  There were many nights that all I got was 4 hours.<br>  <br>  Sometimes, whether you have been good or not, they will just take you all out to a field and smoke you.  (That means do push ups and set ups and other stuff until nobody can move anymore).  Other nights there is training.  Certain things can only be trained on at night.  The days were you actually do get some free time are very few.<br>  <br>  The exceptions.  Anytime you are taken to a rifle range where you will be shooting live ammunition, you will likely get a good nights sleep.  Also, they won't be as hard on you then either.  They want you to be focused on safety and fully alert in those situations.<br>  <br>  In my personal experience, the best night were nights that we camped in the field.  I always got longer and better sleep on those nights.<br>  <br>  Some advice.  Don't think you can hide anything.  If the drills say you shouldn't have something, you won't be able to hide it from them.  They have been doing this for hundreds of years and millions of recruits.  They have seen every possible place to hide something and they have the barracks bugged.  They can hear everything you say.  <br>  <br>  Don't pick on your fellow soldiers.  Never condone or participate in any blanket party or any other sort of self policing.  Stand up for your fellow soldier and try to help him succeed.  I say this, because you never know which one is going to snap and kill himself on the rifle range and you don't know if he is going to take someone with him before he goes.  I don't know a single soldier who didn't know someone who snapped in basic training.  Be a ghost to the drills, if you can go the whole cycle without them knowing you by name, you will be a winner.  Good luck!<br>  <br>  Between the MPs and the infantry, I would take the infantry.  Both jobs suck to the max, but at least you will have the respect of your fellow soldiers as an infantry man.  |`|XNeJp5i8aa	OK I went through Basic about 20 years ago so things may have changed a little.  We were yelled aout of bed at about 3-4 am (O'dark 30 as we called it).  We typically took showers at night but you have to shave in the moring as there is zero tollerance for stubble.  Then it's off to formation.  No day is typical in basic.  But you can expect every day to be exhausting.  No there is little to no free time.  What free time you have you will want to use to catch on to your sleap.  You are never "off" as you put it.  You can be in a classroom for part of the day, outside in physical training, at the rifle range or marching around.  You will have to some studying as well.  The bottom line is that basic is tough.  But war is tougher.  Keep in mind basic will be over beore you know it. It ends so even though it's unpleasant, you know in reality its brief.  <br>  <br>  As far as jobs go.  being and MP is much like a police officer in the civilian world.  You can easily get a job in law enforcement after being an MP.  The infantry isn't bad but keep in mind you will probably see actual combat these days.  It all depends on if you want a skill that will land you a job after your stint in the military or you want to make being in the military a career.  <br>  <br>  If I had it to do all over again I would join the Coast Guard.  
Em9NylOZaa	No there havent been any thoroughbred conservatives for president in a while and the party is shifting. Michael Steele even knew Bush spent too much and made alot of mistakes. Bush wasnt an evil person. McClellan even said that. But anyway, Steele, Jindal of Louisiana, Pawlenty of Minnesota, these guys are the future of the party and thats great for conservatives to have young faces leading for a change. And McCain obviously didnt represent the republican platform like a presidential candidate usually would so its strange to think what gop voters were thinking at the time.|`|E9XL5x3Paa	And you feel we would have gone with George W.

Personally, I can't consider any of our presidents since Hoover a conservative, especially Republicans after Reagan.  How can you call them conservative when they consistently support massive deficit spending?<br>  <br>  If any candidate supports a balanced budget, I'd vote for him or her in a heartbeat.  At least economically, it could be argued that Bill Clinton was one of our best presidents...do you remember...a budget SURPLUS?<br>  <br>  You gotta admit, it's hard to call the current Republican party conservative.  Technically, the Democrats are - they want to go back to the way it was before Reagan: ridiculous corporate taxes to fund an extremely activist government that gets results (although not good results after Nixon abandoned the gold standard.)  Ross Perot would have been a great president, and he put Bill into office.  Just goes to show you what competition can do; you need it in politics just the same as business.|`|ujIinLzGaa	Not among the Republican candidates.  Ron Paul, however, would make a great president.
ZlsUXNSGaa	His plan is going to significantly cut into corporate profits.  <br>  What people don't realize is that investors in the US and ABROAD are pulling money out of the markets.  They realize that Obama's plans make our markets more volatile and less profitable.  Sure the markets were taking hits before, but announcing crazy policies do affect the markets.  One day people will wake up and realize that this stimulus plan creates disincentives to invest and will run the economy to the ground.|`|EenbVs8Oaa	Well, Bush's TARP is leading to socialism of the banking system, which will continue to roadblock any meaningful recovery to this recession.<br>  <br>  Its a beautiful thing, opposing ideology's (Bush/Obama) working together to absolutely destroy this country as we know it.|`|lrMCiDnraa	Wait till the markets open Monday.

Now that he's talking about raising taxes to cut the deficit... it's only going to go lower.  We can expect the market to really do a lovely dive today.|`|sLEdPDkHaa	because mass welfare does not help the economy|`|E9XL5x3Paa	Because it has nothing to do with the bailout.<br>  <br>  <br>  It has to do with bank nationalization.  Obama has already said he won't do it, and every time he says that the markets recover.  Then some idiot like Rush Limbaugh comes out and says that Obama will nationalize the banks, and some idiot like Alan Greenspan says its the only way to save the banks, and then the stock market drops again.  Then it is saved by Obama when he talks about his stimulus plan, and that he WON'T nationalize the banks.<br>  <br>  Rush Limbaugh is the idiot tanking the markets with his lies.  Alan Greenspan is the idiot tanking the market by saying Rush Limbaugh is correct because that is the only way to save the system is to nationalize the banks.  Obama is one of the few still keeping the system somewhat afloat, actually.<br>  <br>  Start pressing Rush to lay off the nationalization talks, and the market will recover.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  add-on:<br>  <br>  Yes, you're right on those numbers.  But one, it doesn't take into account that before the Democrats got into Congress leadership, the Stock Market had been over 14,000 and had been dropping already.<br>  <br>  Secondly, it also doesn't take into account that the job market had been going down since mid-2004.  The Stock Market may have been going up, but the job market was going down considerably.<br>  <br>  And the reason why both were occurring at the same time is the same.  That is because George W. Bush pressed for business tax cuts and got them.<br>  <br>  And instead of using those tax cuts to create new jobs as they were supposed to, the businesses chose instead to start using that money to automate many jobs.  They got rid of jobs, not created jobs.  And that drop in the payroll expense by getting rid of those jobs increased their profit line.  That in turn attracted investors, which sent the Stock Market through the roof.<br>  <br>  But the problem with this is, the employees are also consumers.  They were losing jobs, and so they were losing that which provides the money that funds their spending.  So they quit buying products made by businesses.<br>  <br>  While initially the businesses saved money by automating, they simultaneously were cutting off the money supply to their customers (who were also their employees).  So when employees quit buying, all of a sudden the businesses' profits started drying up.  They responded by laying off more people, but that only served to dry up even more of their profits.<br>  <br>  And that led to investors running from the Stock Market.

715f1626818f5d62fcf3ef5c3b86c820aa	the democrats are at fault,but you need to go back in time and see how they are involved. the democrats gave us the federal reserve,a private bank that controls our money system.the federal reserve caused the stock market crash in 1928,the democrats with the federal reserve made gold money illegal,the democrats 30 years later took away silver money. now our currency is nothing but paper and very easy to manipulate. the federal reserve lowered interest rates and made member banks give loans under clinton's time,they raised rates under bush until the mortgage crisis happened,all the while tightening credit lines to hamper business. someone please tell me if i have made an error in my statement|`|uvbSl7zYaa	The Clintons and Janet Reno, (also Eric Holder the asst. Atny Gen.  at the time, now Atny Gen.), forced the banks to lend money to people who should never have received loans.  Eventually it caught up to the banks that had to lend the money, and it all fell apart.<br>  Now the government is bailing out those banks, (as maybe it should since it put them in the situation), but they are not puting the responsibility where it belongs, on the Clintons and the Dems.  <br>  We get the government we elect and deserve.  It is time for a wake up call.|`|oShnTNORaa	im sure as you noticed the government bounces back and forth on which party controls it, and democrats are not completely to blame just as republicans aren't. are government is to blame as a whole.|`|IWlPfk1raa	To be honest I think you have to do your research all over again<br>  <br>  Not saying democrats don't have anything to do with it.|`|4loaxx2raa	the stock markets are telling us that|`|3c91df9cab412a7ca4201cdaf64121e3aa	Economic downturn of this magnitude doesn't happen in the matter of a year - it is YEARS in the making.<br>  <br>  What started this - spending more than you are bringing in.  It is basic economics.  No business is going to succeed by pulling in less money than they are spending.  That is called operating in the red, and anyone with any sort of economic knowledge will tell you that is not the way to operate.<br>  <br>  How does this relate to the economy in general?  Because Americans have been living too long on credit, and now the bill is due and no one can pay it.  And who is to blame?  All of the greedy b**t**ds in this nation, if not the world.  Everyone was wanting to make a fast buck, and everyone wanted the perks of making that money.  It was the American Dream to have the house, cars, clothes, and so on.  The banks were falling all over themselves to lend money to everyone because at the time they were making money on the interest.  Well, it got to the point that people couldn't pay, and it all went down from there.  Collapse was eminent.and we all have a part in it.  It has nothing to do with being Republican or Democrat.  It has everything to do with being American and wanting too much.<br>  <br>  I know that none of this fits into what you want for an answer.  You want everyone to agree with your senario and tell you that you are right.  But unfortunately, you are not right.  Sorry - your "chart" is merely a statement of numbers.  It doesn't reflect actual "facts" as you state.  Yes - those are the numbers during those times.  But in your method, one could reason that the reason for the Titanic sinking would be the President in office and the majority party in congress.  <br>  <br>  I hate to aggitate you further, but I really don't think you know much about economics at all.  All of this demonstrates that fact.  And I don't need any chart to try and show me that.  Sorry.|`|E9XL5x3Paa	Already answered you on this one.  You were unable to answer to it, so one must assume that if you are continuing this line of reasoning, it's because you don't care about the truth or what is best for us.  You only care about hurting the other side, even if your own side is the one that made the mistakes.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Our economic problems all stem from Bush's actions.  It was his want to fight in Iraq, but not raise the funds to pay for it, that forced him to borrow money from other countries at very high (and exponentially growing) interest rates.<br>  <br>  When Bush got to office, he inherited a $4 trillion National Debt from Clnton, as well as a $400 billion surplus.  When Bush left office, he left us with a nearly $11 trillion National Debt and a $500 billion deficit in the federal budget.<br>  <br>  That means on National Debt alone, Bush managed to spend $3 trillion MORE THAN DOUBLE what all 42 of his predecessors needed 224 years to amass.  And his latest budget managed to lose nearly a trillion dollars when compared to Clinton's final budget.<br>  <br>  Such a huge rise in the National Debt scared investors away from backing the dollar, which is now at its 16 year low.  Incidentally, do you remember who was in charge 16 years ago?  It was George H.W.Bush, while in the midst of his own recession.  But I digress.  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  A drop in the value of the dollar like that meant that businesses had to use more of them to make the same products.  Oil is also measured in dollars, so when the dollar's value dropped it took more of them to equal the same barrel of oil.  That meant that it cost more to transport goods, since both gas and oil are needed for that transportation.  The rise in both the cost of production as well as shipping meant that businesses had to raise their prices to cover that.<br>  <br>  They also had to cut expenses; and the biggest expense they cut was payroll.  In other words, they laid off employees.<br>  <br>  But employees are also consumers.  When they lost their jobs, they had to cut their spending.  There is your problem with Middle Class spending, the biggest driver in our economy.<br>  <br>  That drop in consumer spending meant lower profits for businesses.  That led to even more layoffs.  There's your problem in the job market.<br>  <br>  Lower profits also meant a drop in the number of investors.  If you were an investor, would you invest in a company barely making a profit?  How about an out-and-out loss?  There's your problem in the Stock Market.<br>  <br>  Employees are also bank lendees.  With their jobs disappearing and their savings being destroyed (dollar value drop and 401k gone in the Stock Market), they had to start defaulting on their loans.  And they all did it at the same time.  Home loans, mortgages, car loans, and student loans; they all defaulted at the same time.  There's your problem in the bank market, the real estate market, the subprime mortgage crisis, and the auto industry.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Every problem we have in our economy was either created by the Iraq War, or was greatly exascerbated by the Iraq War.  And that was all Bush, who lied to us to get us to suppor that war.<br>  <br>  And it still wouldn't have been so bad, but he chose to borrow to cover that war rather than raise the funds.  It's like wanting to buy a TV, and instead of paying cash he put it on a high interest credit card; then refused to pay any of it down.<br>  <br>  Anyone who has ever run into credit card debt knows the extreme foolishness of how Bush chose to pay for this war.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Add-on:<br>  <br>  I did read the chart, and it sides with my conclusions.<br>  <br>  Secondly, I don't see how you can call what I wrote lies.  It's exactly what Rush and Hannity say all the time.  We cannot spend like crazy and expect it not to hurt the economy.<br>  <br>  That is their attack on Democrats.  That is their reason for saying you should not support Democrats.  If what I say is a lie, then what Rush and Hannity say is a lie.<br>  <br>  All I'm doing is pointing out that their attack would be better suited being aimed at Republicans, and George W. Bush in particular.  He spent trillions of dollars in Iraq.<br>  <br>  Incidentally, $500 billion of those dollars were used in a stimulus package similar to what Obama is proposing, but for Iraq instead.  And as it turns out, Iraq has a great economy now that is churning out multi-billion dollar surpluses.  Bush did for Iraq (economically speaking) what Obama is proposing for America.  And it worked.<br>  <br>  Now politically speaking, Iraq is under the control of Iran because the Prime Minister of Iraq (Nouri al Maliki) is an ally of Iran.  That is why he is not letting us use Iraq as a staging ground for intimidating Iran into backing off its nuclear ambitions.  But economically speaking, right now you can't really beat Iraq.  <br>  <br>  Now Obama wants to do the same for us.  And as an added bonus, when Obama is done we won't be under Iranian control.|`|ExCAedp4aa	The Dow isn't a reflection of how well traders and investors think the government is doing, it's a reflection of how well business is doing.

q0gnYRPKaa	Yes, you will see him run by on the Airman's run.  He will then proceed to go back to the dorm to change into Blues, and the next time you see him that day will be on the ceremony pad for the Coin Ceremony, where he will get his Airman's coin from his T.I. and he will be officially announced a United States Airman!<br>  <br>  He will then be released back to you until around 7:30 where he will have to back to his dorm for the night.  Keep in mind this day you cannot leave base.<br>  <br>  Friday, graduation is early, and right after the graduation parade he is released to you for the whole day until 7:30 again.  You can leave base and go as far as San Antonio (river walk is gorgeous by the way).<br>  <br>  The next day you pick him up for another day of town pass until again 7:30.<br>  <br>  Sunday, if he got honor grad or his flight got honor flight will depend whether or not he can go off base or has to stay on base liberty.  This time he has to be back by 4:30 to get packing to go to Tech School.  This will be a hard time for everyone.  Be proud though, Basic Training was rough and sucks hardcore.  Not everyone can do it, trust me, we had enough people just lose it (or couldn't take it physically).|`|a0cb768a2bcdc7a915356d5a5db75704aa	I think my sister was on Friday for graduation.

20M2yA9eaa	Only if you like long long days and doing PT (physical training five days a week from 6am-7am)...  You get paid like 1200 dollars a month for working 60 hours a week.  When I was in Korea we also had "alerts" once a month where we had to get up at 3 in the morning and respond to the alert.  Meaning we had to get ready like we were going to war.  Worst case scenario, you will be sent to Iraq.  Especially as a medical assistant.  Better to go to school to become a Physician's Assistant and then join and have the Army pay off your student loans.  At least you'll have a degree and a well paying job when you get out.  And you be an officer.  Think about it long and hard, because you will have to take the ASVAB to even qualify to get that job, and they want people with good Math and Science skills to be a Medical Assistant.  <br>  Good job and you have a good heart for wanting to join the Armed Forces.  It's a good job and you can have a lot of fun, but it is also a lot of hard work.  I HATED PT with a passion.  Also  you have to be able to pass a PT test, for most girls the hard part is the 2 mile run.  Just do a lot of research and talk to a recruiter.  Take a practice ASVAB to see if you can get the score you need to enlist for that MOS (Military Occupational Specialty).  <br>  <br>  Good luck and Good for you!

Cassette tapes were made obsolete by cd's in the music industry. Now this did not happen overnight it was a slow process just as dvds are and have in most cases replaced VHS tapes and how Blue-Ray is attempting to replace the typical DVD. Its a slow process of attrition and technology. As the technology grows so will the desire and/or demand for it. This should be the way we look at renewable energy.

AA10476668	Yes, and the same thing continues to go on thanks to both parties in our government. Dems want the votes of the immigrants and Republicans want to continue to provide their cronies with cheap labor. At the current rate of immigration and the type of immigrants we're allowing (legal and illegal), we're creating a massive underclass of uneducated people who unfortunately tend to have too many kids who also adopt the same values and drop out of school. At some point (sooner than people realize) the middle-class will fold because it can no longer economically sustain the social services and support these people require. At that point they will join the underclass and the upper class will have absolute rule. Our government is composed of very rich people who have extremely generous retirement plans, receive kick-backs from the corps whose lobbyists sway them to vote favorably for big business versus the People, and who are so disassociated and unsympathetic with the real world that it's criminal. They're fine in their houses on the hill, thank you very much, and will do whatever they can do maintain their wealth and power.|`|OHfZFR31aa	Most of the immigrants to the US in it's entire history, going back to the Pilgrims, were poor people. Very few of the English who came over in the 16-1800s were wealthy. The Germans, Scandinavians, Irish, Italians, Polish, etc who came in the 1800s were also poor.

u4SDMJnzaa	Everyone acts like this issue has been beat to death, but the fact of the matter is Obama has YET to produce documentation repudiating these claims.  His mom was born in Kansas, his dad was born in Kenya and he claims to have been born in Hawaii; however, his grandmother claims to have been present at the birth in Kenya (let's suppose the woman is senile with dementia and he actually was born in the US in 1961.)  He was later either acknowledged or adopted by his mother"s second husband in Indonesia (he had to have been in order to attend school for the time he lived in Indonesia) and documentation has proven that he was a dual citizen of Kenya and Indonesia at the time he attended school there which means he had to come back to the states through immigration which would make him a naturalized citizen, not a natural born citizen despite the fact that he was supposedly born on US soil.  (sounds weird, but that's that law) thus making him ineligible to become president, based on the constitution.  However, money talks in Washington and anything could happen.  <br>  <br>  To better answer your question, I copied a piece below from the DNC Call for the 2008 elections.  This can be found on page 19 section g.<br>  <br>  "Filling a Vacancy on the National Ticket: In the event of death, resignation or disability of a nominee of the Party for President or Vice President after the adjournment of the National Convention, the National Chairperson of the Democratic National Committee shall confer with the Democratic leadership of the United States Congress and the Democratic Governors Association and shall report to the Democratic National Committee, which is authorized to fill the vacancy or vacancies."|`|Iwtv6QyIaa	It's not so much where you were born.  There are US citizens born abroad every day.  It's what citizenship his parents had at the time of his birth.  If they weren't Americans then he wasn't either.  Did they become Americans before he was born?  I think his mom changed citizenship when she married his stepfater which means Obama is not a true citizen of the US.  It is confusing.  It depends on the truth.  There are non US citizens born in the US all the time too.|`|lih3axCsaa	Barack Obama was born on the island of Oahu, Hawaii in the Kapolani Medical Center on 4 Aug, 1961. Obama’s parents, Barack Obama Sr and Ann Dunham, met while attending the University of Hawaii (Manoa). His father was a foreign exchange student from Kenya. Obama’s parents didn’t stay together long and were divorced when Obama was 2-years old. His mom was remarried to an Indonesian man and moved to Jakarta, Indonesia until he was 10-years old.<br>  |`|73e55a9f7eecf20de6fc4c2b6f6b9867aa	In order to became a senator this is all you need:<br>  Things You’ll Need:<br>  ?U.S. citizenship for at least nine years upon being elected, Residency in the state which will be represented, Be at least 30 years old <br>  <br>  So saying this you do not need to be us born to be a senator, mayor, or Governor, That is why Arnold could be any of the things listed above but never be a president.  So if Obama was not truly born within the boundaries of  what the government calls the U.S. then he is not eligible to be the president that of which they can and will find out IF he makes it.  In my opinion if you question the fact for birth place then exercise you right to vote and help swing the electoral vote and Vote for McCain like all the normal people including some of my friends who are Democrat and refuse to vote for a man they can not stand or believe.

I thought we were a capitalist society?<br>  <br>  And before anyone harps on about the past and the progressive movement, at the time, we did need it.  People needed safe working conditions.  The Progression Movement of Republican Teddy Roosevelt is not the same as the "progressive movement" of today.  Also, Rockefeller, Carnegie, Vanderbilt and the other Bill Gates of their time did share their wealth.  Many things today are still bearing their names because the wealth they shared.

Its always good to have college to back up the training you receive in the Army.  If you want to go active first, you can always apply for a green to gold scholarship.

That is why you wear a pack up high and not down low.You want to reduce the drag..And of course you get used to it, but is telling a fresh young person whos trying to learn how to hump to place dead weight in a pack in his best interest,NO its not..Not only is it stupid but its bad for you and can damage your back.Since he will get used to it why not have him carry 100 pounds.??The lighter stuff such as clothes, shelter, goes in the bottom of a pack load..as you go up you place water,  radios, batteries for radios and other solid items to make a pack top heavy...Thanks for your input SGT..or should i say "pro"..and by the way..a properly packed pack keeps its weight were you place it..it does not "sink" down as you state.|`|3aHAW41baa	I would train with a steady 40 pounds or so.  The additional weight is going to come from the flak jacket and kevlar.  When I PT on my own I normally just get a backpack and throw a sandbag in there.  Hiking is not really about the weight, it's a mindset.<br>  <br>  STA:  all weight is going to sink to the bottom of the pack.  We're only talking about 40 pounds.  Your body gets used to it.  I've been doing this for a little while, don't try to argue with the pros.  No hard feelings though, I'll give you a thumbs up for good looking out.<br>  <br>  Instruct all you want, this is what we do in the fleet Marine force.|`|OVpcrYGDaa	Don't use sand.... bloody idiots mentioning that! you need to pack out you daysack with a jacket or sleeping bag at the bottom then water bottels or the odd gym weight is a good way to go nothing over 5kg you could use a couple of them. but never sand nnnnnnnnnoooooooooooooooo!!! IDIOTS!!!!! preperation is the key.a camelbak is a exellent way to keep hydrated. 45 - 55lb is what you want to aim for. but dont forget to build upto it gradually increase distance speed and weight.|`|a0cb768a2bcdc7a915356d5a5db75704aa	Just use sand. 40-50lbs.|`|wsTK80H6aa	When I served in the Army we had a 55 pound sandbag in our packs.

In New York, without any pattern of calls, it would probably be a misdemeanor.  The fact that you're not on the voice mail is definitely in your favor.  Do you have a record?  If you're a first offender, a judge might be tempted to give you a conditional discharge; don't get into trouble for the indicated time, and your record goes away.  Since you have good future plans, don't take a chance.  Get a lawyer, Even if it's from the Public Defender's office.  Without knowing the specifics of your case, it doesn't sound like you're in really bad trouble, but don't trust to luck and good will!  Over and above that, most schools will accept you with a misdemeanor.

That's statutory rape, whether you agreed to participate or not.<br>  <br>  Unprotected sex can lead to pregnancy, even if the act is not completed.

Your parents were right to ban you from seeing him, but they might have been a little too late!<br>  <br>  The only way to tell for sure if you are pregnant is to get a test.  There is usually a choice to abortion, it's called having a baby!  I'm pro choice ... but that just means that both options should be open, I don't advocate one option over the other!<br>  <br>  Get the pregnancy test ... NOW!  There is prenatal care that should be done if you plan to go full term with the pregnancy!  <br>  <br>  If you are pregnant, your life is about to change in many ways ... I'll guarantee that you will not like most of the changes!
fgIbNRHfaa	No, you DO NOT have to take the test.  However, depending on state law, if you refuse to take the test, they can arrest you and/or take you to have blood drawn.  (But if you blow over the limit, you will be arrested anyway . . . )  <br>  <br>  But the consequences of refusing the test depends on that particular state's law.  In Louisiana, if you don't blow, they will arrest you and you will automatically lose your DL for 6 months (if you were driving).  However, that is much better than being convicted of a DWI.  If you blow over, you are guilty period.  No defense available.  If you don't blow, then the only way they can prove you were drunk is based on your behavior on the video.  So at least you have a chance, and if you don't show your butt on the video, you have a good chance of having the charges reduced to careless and reckless driving, which is no big deal.  So if you are driving in La, don't blow and keep your mouth shut.  <br>  <br>  In some states, they can take blood to establish your blood alcohol level.  It sounds like in Illinois, they can take you to a hospital.  However, underage drinking while you are walking is much less serious that a DWI.  But no, you don't have to take the test, and you won't be in more trouble either.|`|6a29fa9432cd11f6628b8d1ef1265ca6aa	You have the right to refuse the test. You weren't driving and you are not required to incriminate yourself.|`|TtI7VtTfaa	No..|`|cWmx0J4jaa	you probably didn't need to do so legally, but it would cost an atty to fight it. Are you ready for that?|`|SS1VReF0aa	Yes that's true. If the officer has reason to believe you are intoxicated beyond a legal level and does not take action to enforce the law, that officer is responsible for anything that happens at that point. You have the right to refuse the breath test, and then the officer has the right to mandate a blood test.<br>  <br>  Not sure why I'm getting thumbs down...did anyone read the question before answering?<br>  "The officer told me to blow into the breathalyzer and I asked her if I had to and she said, "you either take the test or I have to call an ambulance to take you to the hospital, because I can be held reliable for you if you go back to your dorm, pass out, and die."<br>  <br>  What the officer said is correct, given the situation. You can refuse the breath test, but then the officer has further action he/she will (and must) take that you cannot refuse.|`|dvS6F9ZSaa	Yes, you have the right to refuse.  And yes the police officer has to protect himself from civil liability.  The effects of alcohol effect everyone differently.  By law, in Illinois, a police officer is not required to have a PBT result to issue a possession/consumption of alcohol by a minor ticket.  The scent and or admission alone is grounds for the ticket.  And every police officer tries to contact a parent to pick up their intoxicated child, however as a college student, that's not an option.<br>  <br>  Furthermore, in case you didn't know, as of June 1st, 2008 any minor charged and convicted of consumption/possession of alcohol by a minor will get a 6 month drivers license suspension too.|`|6x7zV65Xaa	Well the officer does have a point, not sure how laws in IL work, but basically where I am from if you dont subject to a breathalyzer they will send you to the hospital and make you do one, or, if you refuse there, you are presumed guilty because they can't get an accurate reading...its kinda like they say, if you are not drunk then why are you denying doing the breathalyzer type thing? i think the cop was right in your situation, sorrrry|`|wf9RHP3Eaa	You could have refused, but then you would have been arrested, taken to the hospital for a blood alcohol test, and you would have gotten an extra charge on top of underage drinking. I'm not sure what it is in Illinois, but in most states they tack on a refusal charge (basically a resisting arrest charge) when you refuse. <br>  <br>  You did the right thing. Now go kick your fool friend's ***.|`|MnzX5quAaa	NO, you do not have to take the test, but if you refuse, you could loose your license for 1 year, but you wouldn't be charged with a DUI,|`|AA10612715	Refuse the test and when the ambulance comes refuse the medical care..<br>  <br>  You have a right to refuse medical care if you are above 18years old.|`|vIV7eEBsaa	No, you can ask for a blood test at the station.
9yoGMz3taa	Sin, SIN!!!<br>  <br>  Definitely a sin!!|`|E9XL5x3Paa	The two aren't mutually exclusive.<br>  <br>  <br>  There's also the question, am I to judge this on legality or morality?  And if morality, whose morality?<br>  <br>  <br>  I believe it to be a sin, but I believe it should be legal.  A woman should have control over her own body, and a man for that matter (as there are male prostitutes).  Their customers should have control over their body as well.<br>  <br>  It blows my mind that a man or woman can have all the sex they want; but if they do the Capitalist thing and make a little money off of it, then they get thrown in jail.|`|UETAqR8Taa	can hardly handle saying this. here it is illegal other countries not illegal but an injustice to women and men. used by pathetic people who if need to use these services should seek professional help.<br>  yes some feel pushed into this to support a drug habit or child and this is where the government and the public let them down. i feel its a sin and am totally against it, but some i understand are against the wall. there is work for for the dole, so i suppose they (woman or male) have a choice. work for the dole or degrade themselves.<br>  IT IS A SIN- no matter what|`|gYNDNXAkaa	It's not a sin, but a lot of women are forced into prostitution and porn.<br>  <br>  They are forced to do drugs and this addiction allows their controller to use them up.<br>  <br>  It's quite sad.  Well...enjoy your porn!|`|sw2R5A9iaa	i live in NV.  it's a great way to support a family, if done legally.  the girls are kept clean or let go.  the taxes collected support our cities & state.|`|zEZF5ITMaa	I believe women that end up in prostitution are usually really sad and alone people and I wish more could be done to get them out of the trade.|`|81Iglngeaa	sinful|`|UtipU1MCaa	It's a job not a trade; as to being a sin well that's a question of judgment.<br>  <br>  Prostitution has often been referred to as one of the oldest professions in the world (that an medicine). It plays a valuable role within society .. providing outlet for those who are not able to function in that fashion in the normal fashion (by this i refer to physically and psychiatrically damaged).<br>  <br>  Of course there are a number of associated problem with unregulated prostitution (drugs, disease, assaults, robbery, murder etc) but that being said. The legalisation and regulation of a sex industry greatly reduces these issues. Here in QLD Australia prostitution in legal in brothels and single occupancy premises, but street walking (the stereotyped prostitute) is quite illegal and is vigorously prosecuted as a result of all the aforementioned issues.<br>  <br>  It is far to easy to try and take the moral or religious high ground and judge these people as sinful. A wise man once told me that we should only make a moral judgment on someone once we have walked a mile in their shoes.<br>  <br>  food for thought .....?|`|tsnpv9whaa	Its a trade of sin!!! Lol|`|VeBh959raa	of course it is a big sin
YiY9Yd2Jaa	No, because they have made it clear that smoking is not tolerated, they can't have a squad of security men in place to forcibly stop those people who choose to ignore the rules. If you don't like the smoke outside reception, then don't go outside reception.|`|NMaCcyeKaa	I don't think so.  Have you taken your concerns to the student council and college administration?  I don't think you can sue the college for a problem if you haven't made them aware of the problem and given them time to address it.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	what you need is a doctor who can provide better treatment.  seek the advice of a pulmonologist.  i cover my airways when walking near smokers and keep my inhaler handy.|`|b0dee10a6de166bc265de45ecc7668e0aa	Yes you can.  If the school is not enforcing what is probably a state law then you can force them to restrict smoking to certain areas.  <br>  <br>  I really am surprised at the intolerant attitudes -  asthma can kill.|`|gYNDNXAkaa	Aww, mommy's little girl can't handle a little smoke?  Why don't you go back to nursery school?<br>  <br>  Seriously, though, that sucks man.  You will just be a little ***** trying to sue them.  Talk to the Dean first or whoever would be in charge.|`|82e62204f1233511508a75bdb7acf417aa	You cant make anyone "stop" something unless they WANT to stop themselves... And no you cant sue...what you can do is make other people aware of whats going on, alert the media, call your state etc and report it... They know they are doing wrong, but somehow think they are above the law...Go to the Dean of the college if you have to,but you best make sure that smoking indeed is not allowed.. other then that, use the phone instead of going in, you  say you have been in there several times so you know the consequences, so its nobodies fault but your own if you keep subjecting yourself to it!|`|AA11043457	First  you need to talk to someone to notify the school of the problem with smoking.  But even if people smoke outside you have ot walk through it. I think they should make smoking entrances and nonsmoking entrances where no one smokes so you can enter without walking through the smoke.  But that is my own opinion. What you need to do is to go to whatever counselor you are assigned or to the Dean or to a group that handles grievances and discuss your medical problem and the fact that they are not enforcing the rules.  If you have a school newspaper, you could write to that as well.<br>  <br>  Once that is done and you can't get satisfaction,  you  might want to consider a transfer to a non-smoking school - where no one smokes.  Only one I know i BYU and it is no smoking, no drinking.  Was voted most cold sober college for something like 10th straight year.  So no smoking there.  Maybe you can find another one.  There is one in Utah and one in Idaho and one in Hawaii.  There is an LDS college in Virginia too which would not have smoking.<br>  <br>  You can check with an attorney to see if it is worth suing if the school does not enforce the smoking ban in the buildings.  If he smoking is outside the building, you are out of luck as outside is okay, even though you have to hold your breath to come through it.<br>  <br>  Good luck to  you.<br>  <br>  If your state has no smoking|`|5b37795563969b19352fc16bf286b0a0aa	Perhaps you should talk to you college about it.<br>  <br>  Ask them to set up a smoking area, my college had one it was like a little box almost (because Michigan is cold in the winter) so people could go in and smoke.<br>  <br>  Does your state have smoking laws? Like mine has you can only smoke in certain places. <br>  <br>  But seriously, talk to someone before you sue because they can counter sue that you never came to them with this allegation so they could fix it.|`|81Iglngeaa	No, your college cant do anything to enforce it anyways, and really it just sounds like your some crazy antismoker person i mean give me a break outside smoking of one or two people is about to kill you? my girlfriend has asthma and she smokes, it doesnt hurt her at all.|`|zEZF5ITMaa	Maybe you should not jump to legal action but make an appointment with your dean of health and dean of student life, etc... <br>  <br>  Maybe they can move you into wellness/health housing where people would be less apt to smoke outside.<br>  <br>  If none of your cries are heard, then maybe file a grievance, etc...|`|B6Oy01Tcaa	Well, first, you should notify the highest person in charge that you can. If they do not do anything after a week, contact the principle. If that doesn't solve the issue, mention to them that you are thinking about suing them over the matter.

DTSUJe2oaa	Restricting plea bargaining has more than one definition, some states restrict it for certain types of crimes, ones that place the public at risk most commonly, also where on defendant pleas they may restrict all others involved with the same incidence from entering into a plea, the following is Black's law dictionary's definition.~<br>  <br>  If plea bargaining appears at all in state statutes, it is generally in the context of being prohibited or restricted for certain matters or types of cases. For example, many states have prohibited plea bargaining in drunk driving cases, sex offender cases, or those involving other crimes that place the public at risk for repeat offenses or general harm. Another common provision, found in a majority of states, is a requirement that a prosecutor must inform a victim or the victim's survivors of any plea bargaining in a case. In many states, victims' views and comments regarding both plea bargaining and sentencing are factored into the ultimate decisions or determinations.~

Tell her that if she doesn't want you to have it any longer that she can come get it or you will bring it home at the end of the term.  Keep a copy of he letter and send it to her certified mail with the return receipt so she has to sign for it and  you can prove she got it. <br>  <br>  You could tell her that she should not make a false police report as people are arrested for making a false report and that you are concerned about her and don't want her to get into trouble.<br>  <br>  I don't know how she will react to that, but you have it on record that you sent.  You might have a roommate or a teacher read the letter and see you put it in the envelope and keep your copy. and then keep the green return card when it comes back.  Taht way you will have some proof of what you say in case she does contact the police.  <br>  <br>  But don't tell your mother little problems at school as she can't handle them.  <br>  <br>  If she was not always like this, she has developed a problem.  If she has a regular doctor you could alert the doctor to our concerns.  If she finds out she could be mad at that too.  It is very difficult for you when you live with someone with a mental problem.<br>  <br>  I doubt that you would be arrested anyway, but you can consider if you thought that writing the letter might help you prove you had the car with her permission.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you.<br>  <br>  This is not a legal opinion.|`|LBAh1tPoaa	You stole it didn't you?

And many of their 'descendants' are just looking for handouts.|`|gO1iAm99aa	It's been, is and will be with us everywhere. The degree is the question. No one can claim immunity from giving it out or receiving it, even amongst your own in the forms of caste, class, money, intelligence, experience, travel, and even with somethings as inane as height, weight, zits, glasses, braces, a stutter, limp, and what you wear/drive.<br>  Racism has been "lumped" with prejudice, bragging, rudeness, religion, abruptness, making fun, bullying, any/all criticizing/disapproval in order to make it bigger.<br>  Keep people fighting among themselves, and you can create jobs to settle the disputes. Beginning to see? Create a problem, and then elect yourself as the "cure".<br>  Don't kid yourself, it comes from every direction, bottom up, side to side & top down, always has.<br>  The only ONE-WAY thing is ridiculous.<br>  Watch Jerry Springer.<br>  Rights & freedom, but not compensation ... Bingo!|`|6e6fb50d87f07492879715e4526ac64daa	the whole slavery racism thing is a strategy used by the radical left to divide americans into groups and pit them against each other.|`|G6yyceAxaa	You have an interesting question.<br>  <br>  slavery was practiced in countries in Africa, however it was not the totalitarian brand that was practiced by Europeans.<br>  <br>  in African countries, you could be a slave and still own property, and actually marry into the family that held you in slavery.  also you were allowed to continue your tribal and religious lifestyle.<br>  <br>  the principle tribe that sold slaves to Europeans was the Ashanti tribe.<br>  <br>  they actually came from the northeastern part of Africa, but fought and took over the western coast.<br>  <br>  the tribes that sold slaves were also in a sorta "catch 22" position.<br>  <br>  the Europeans were trading weapons for slaves.  if you refused to provide slaves, they would go to your neighbor tribe. if they sold the slaves, you neighbor tribe would then have more sophisticated weapons, and could take over your tribe and sell you as slaves.<br>  <br>  As far as your comment on the African American bums in Detroit,  Detroit has been isolated for about 40 years.  most whites live in the surrounding suburbs where they pay taxes, but work in Detroit.  so you had this influx of people not living in Detroit, but working there and not providing any tax revenue.<br>  <br>  the late Mayor Coleman Young attempted to change this by passing a law that said in order to work for the city of Detroit, you must be a resident (about 80% of the Detroit fire dept and police dept didn't live in Detroit)<br>  <br>  this was overturned by Mayor Archer (who lived in the suburbs)<br>  <br>  isolated, and with a declining tax base things got bad. not to mention a couple Mayors that fleeced the city (Archer and Kwame)<br>  <br>  what they don't understand is that if Detroit goes down, all the pretty suburbs will fall also.|`|z2XCCrxqaa	You have a great point. It was their own kind that sold them into slavery. We can't continue to have to pay a price, when in all actuality, there were many "nationalities" who were enslaved when they came to America. The Irish, the Chinese, the Naitive-Americans, the Mexicans, and this is still a problem today. Imagine being an enslaved person in America today, and not being able to have an education. It's happening! No one speaks about it, unless it's 60 min. or something. Children are sold into sex-trade everyday, and even sent over the border into Mexico and Canada from America. <br>  Now our president has sold our future generations into debt-slavery! He's robbed their piggy-banks and pay-checks !|`|WTllfbpFaa	I totally agree. I think most people are sadly mistaken with racsism.|`|ZG6DeAzPaa	Who exactly is making you feel guilty? Give me an example of how you have given something up, like you claim to have to have done. <br>  <br>  What taxes are you paying... specifically to black people? As of right now, your question appears to be a rant thinly veiled in racism. <br>  <br>  Thanks for responding, I hope you are learning some things from this question you asked. Try to keep an open-mind, and I will agree to do the same. :)<br>  <br>  Is racism over-glorified? You should look up what glorified means. There aren't many people who "glorify" racism at all. <br>  <br>  Is it coincidence that your avatar is a white guy with a turban? Are you mocking people who wear turbans? You seem like kind of a bigot.<br>  <br>  That may be a little presumptuous; I am not trying to offend you. I would actually like to educate you, if you would let me.<br>  <br>  <Edit>: I would appreciate it if you responded by adding additional details, but that is up to you. At the very least, do some thinking. :D<br>  <br>  <<Edit>>: Thank you for the calm and rational response... There was some federal aid that went to hurricane Katrina victims, you are correct. But you also seem to think that only black people were affected by this. That is not true.<br>  <br>  Additionally, it is not only white people who were affected by job cuts in the auto industry... Do you really believe that? All that aside, those who lost their jobs in the auto industry could file for unemployement, just like anyone. Do you think the answer is really to bail everyone out? Throw money at anyone who faces some hardships? American auto companies have failed to innovate and sell their product... they DESERVE to fail. There were dead bodies in the streets of New Orleans, and people on their roofs for longer than they should have been. This is not, "I lost my job cause my boss was an idiot, give me money." This was a natural disaster that affected people of MANY different races. <br>  <br>  Now, about affirmative action. Again, you assume a dichotomy of black and white, but the intended beneficiaries of affirmative action in the United States include disadvantaged ethnic minorities, women, people with disabilities, and veterans. Additionally, courts have ruled that it is not constituional for public schools to use race as a factor for whether a student is admitted. Do you want the government interfering in the rights of private universities? <br>  <br>  You seem to argue a rather socialist approach... I would have pegged you for a more conservative fella'. Private universities rightfully have the right to admit students based on any criteria they want... just like you can open a restaurant and refuse service to black people and Muslims. It just so happens that that is usually pretty bad for business, and educational institutuions happen to benefit from diverse populations. <br>  <br>  The same goes for privately funded scholarships. People have a right to decide what their money goes to, and it just so happens that there are people who want to donate to scholarships that are targeted towards minorities. Would you deny a citizen the right to decide where his donation goes?<br>  <br>  <<<EDIT>>><br>  "or pickin a hispanic or asian kid"<br>  Did you read my post? It begins at the second edit, "<<edit>>"<br>  <br>  <<<<EDIT>>>> As far as picking one race over another and these tax benefits. Ok, prove it. You cannot just make claims based on what you "think" is going on. You are pulling "facts" out of nowhere, to prove quite a controversial point. You know what that makes you look like? A bigot.  I am willing to back up any information I provided that you think is dubious. And what's more, I will admit if I was incorrect. You don't seem like you will. Again, this is an example of your irrational, non-factual bias showing.<br>  <br>  <<<<<EDIT >>>>><br>  "im just stating what "I beleive to be facts "<br>  Are you kidding me? Do you not see that that is a dishonest thing to do? Facts are facts whether you believe in them or not. What you are talking about is speculation... You shouldn't speculate in a debate, you should prevent logical arguments and facts.<br>  <br>  I call you a bigot because you display bigoted behavior to me. You are telling me that you choose which facts you want to believe. You are wrong about affirmative action, you are wrong about who benefits from Katrina Relief. You ignore half of what I write, and just make up other arguments instead of responding to my specific points. If you notice, I have tried to respond to every major point you made. You pick and choose what you want to believe to make it fit your bigoted opinion. I would tell you that you don't have to "read what I say" either, but you are already ignoring it.<br>  <br>  On a side note, I am rather offended that you said I was just name-calling.... I have surely done much more than that, haven't I? I gave you information contrary to what you said. It really shows me that this is kind of falling on deaf ears... and that is unfortunate.<br>  <br>  <<<<<<EDIT>>>>>> Finally, a somewhat rational response. You need proof that there are other people besides black people in New Orleans?  Here are the demographics, what you need to know is in the first paragraph. <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans,_Louisiana#Demographics" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans...</a><br>  <br>  I do not deny that there is an African American majority, but it was not only black people who benefited from the relief funding. <br>  <br>  What you are sort of ignoring is the fact that these are PEOPLE, human beings, like you and me, whose lives were torn apart by a natural disaster. So, this whole thing is kind of pointless.... the same sort of funding would be provided if a nuclear reactor exploded in Connecticut. People care about people... forget about what race it is. They are human beings.<br>  <br>  As far as affirmative action, read up on it here:<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affirmative_action_in_the_United_States" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affirmative...</a><br>  Specifically to universities, here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affirmative_action_in_the_United_States#Implementation_in_universities" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affirmative...</a><br>  <br>  Let me know if I made a mistake, or if you disagree. <br>  <br>  I am kind of disappointed that you ignored my argument, and wen't back several steps asking for my sources. Feel free to ask for sources, that is fine... but you didn't respond to anything I said in the last edit. It makes me feel like I am wasting my time... like you don't really care about what I am saying.<br>  <br>  <edit><br>  "Look Im saying read it again MORE SUPPORT FOR KATRINA VICTIMS IRREGARDLESS OF RACE less support for largely African American bums in DETROIT" <br>  <br>  My mistake, I misread. It is hard to read when all the text is capitalized, as well as using no punctuation. <br>  <br>  We are in agreement about the idiots in the auto industry getting a bailout, but I don't see what that has to do with anything.<br>  <br>  (side note: "irregardless" is not really a word... just say "regardless" it means the same. That's just a pet peeve of mine :P)<br>  <br>  Friends and friends of friends are not a reliable source of information. Especially since I do not know these people, or even know if they exist... so forgive me if I am skeptical of your claims.

4vLt3SqFaa	Which is better is totally dependent on what you are trying to do.  Technical skills tend to be better in the navy and air force - but not in every position.  Also don't forget to look at the coast guard not just the navy if you are considering sea duty.  If you want a specific skill like Nuclear Engineering then the navy is unquestionably the best.  If you want fire fighting then the air force.  If you want police training then probably army Military Police.  So you need to decide what you want before picking a service.<br>  <br>  You are correct that every service has a down side.

That includes everyone. The problem with this plan is those who work for or receive cash.

up40wvywaa	No. Parents need to be parents. This is a personal issue, as well as a family issue.<br>  <br>  Sex is such a personal issue between a man and his wife, yet the schools and the media have made it such a public issue. It disgusts me as a parent and as a woman. When the world comes to our children through the schools and the media and teaches them against  the values we parents try to install in our children's futures, we parents need to defend our children instead of turning them over to what will weaken their future<br>  <br>  My husband and I encourage our children, that it is better to wait until they are married before they have sex. Waiting until then will create a strong bond between husband and wife. Their bond will create stability and strength in their children. <br>  <br>  I have heard stupid phrases to defend stupid reasoning to shopping around before you decide.<br>  <br>  "You can test drive a cars before you decide to buy one." and the most popular is " Why buy the cow, when you can have the milk for free."<br>  <br>  Women have come a long way to become excepted as equal partners, yet many have devalued themselves and taught it to their daughters.<br>  <br>  I remember having this conversation with men, and they all agreed that a virgin women was like a valued untouched jewel that is very rare and hard to find and well worth protecting.|`|2a9MLpZRaa	Nah they should learn it on the streets like I did.  JK, look how many parents do you know that actually talk to their kids about sex?|`|eIbPSsy9aa	Um, yes- the point of sex education is to get them to NOT procreate.<br>  <br>  Although work education is a great idea.

Purely elective of course, but would look great on a resume.|`|PGFmTbUOaa	Yes we do. The ability to procreate is not what sex education is about, its about learning to do it responsibly...which is where the kind of sex education we teach in this country is clearly failing.|`|24d92bd0241aeea71cccfaf017c6c707aa	I believe sex education is important.

Which would you prefer?<br>  <br>  The important point of sex education is not how to procreate, but what are the consequences of said procreation and how to minimize such risks.<br>  <br>  And if teaching kids sex education is fascism, so is teaching math, English and science.

But anyway, how else will most of them learn about sex if they're not being taught at home? Every parent does not not teach their children about sex like I and some others did. Some parents have this stupid idea that if you don't talk about sex, the kids won't have sex. And they think that giving a boy with raging hormones condoms, will make him more likely to have sex. He's going to have sex whether you give him the condoms or not. But at least with the condoms and a good sit down talk with your son one on one without threats, he might just absorb what you have told him, and do the proper responsible thing and cover up his pipe. Mine did. Not a grandparent yet. Yeahhhh!

N8Hkn8DJaa	Distinguishing - When a Judge or a court distinguishes the facts of the present case or another case against a case in question.  Eg, one side may refer to a binding precedent on a certain issue and you would respond by distinguishing the facts of your case from the ratio of the binding precedent, therefore allowing the court to look beyond that precedent.<br>  <br>  Why is precedent used?<br>  <br>  Precedent essentially is another mechanism for the creation of law in Common Law countries and the following of precedent creates uniformity in Judgments and particular areas of the law.<br>  <br>  Advantages/Disadvantages -<br>  <br>  One advantage is that a settled area of the law is binding or persuasive on a lower court and creates uniformity in that area of the law.  A disadvantage may be that precedent restricts a court from making a decision which but for the precedent it may not have done so or that a precedent in a general sense becomes a definitive rule of the area of law in question in the judgment.<br>  <br>  Definitions-<br>  <br>  A Precedent is a binding or persuasive Judgment usually from a higher court that has made a decision as to an area of the law.  As a result, lower courts generally do not depart from the precedent unless they can distinguish the facts.<br>  <br>  Binding precedent -  A precedent that is usually from a Higher court that is binding on lower courts.  eg: if the Full Court Supreme Court of California makes a decision on an area of law applicable in that state, a single judge of the Supreme Court would most likely follow the Full Court's decision as he/she would know that failing to do sue would result in their decision being overturned on appeal.<br>  <br>  Persuasive precedents:  For example if you have identical laws in California and Texas and the Texas court makes a particular determination, you could bring this decision into the California court and it would be persuasive but not binding.<br>  <br>  I am from Australia and I do not know what country you are from though what I have said is applicable to all common law countries : Australia, Canada, United Kingdom, United States, New Zealand, etc...|`|Us2fMtZLaa	When a judge distinguishes a case it means that that judge believes that the 2 cases are sufficiently different from each other for the decision and precedent applied in the first case not to apply to the second one.<br>  <br>  Precedent is basically where you look back on previous similar cases to see what was decided in those cases. The law that was laid down, developed or clarified in those previous cases is precedent. This precedent is binding on all courts lower than the court in which it was laid or in the same court. So if a law was made in the House of Lords then it MUST be followed by lower courts such as the Crown court or High Court and technically the House of Lords should also follow it in future cases.<br>  <br>  An advantage of precedent is that it does promote legal certainty. This means that in cases similar on their facts people have a good idea how their case will turn out and therefore if it is worth taking it to court. Precedent also means that law is slowly and carefully developed by the most eminent judicial minds in the country. <br>  A problem however is that you can end up with a line of precedent that is out of date and does not really apply to the modern world very well and because of its binding nature it can be difficult to change it. <br>  <br>  This is all very much watered down and in layman’s terms, but I hope it helps ?
