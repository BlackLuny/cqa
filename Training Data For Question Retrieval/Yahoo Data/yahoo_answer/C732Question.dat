There were a total of 5 of us there... and only 2 were of age.  The party was at the 19 year-old's house and a 21 year-old friend bought the alcohol for her.  I know the 3 under aged could have gotten in trouble, along with the girl who bought the alcohol, but what about me?  I'm 22, and didn't supply anything to the party.. could I have gotten in trouble if my friends psychotic mother called the cops?   I was going to ask my parents about it, but during the party I turned off the volume on my phone, which was also my alarm to get up for school and I ended up missing my 2 hour accounting class because I couldn't hear it. I don't want them to know it was a drinking party, they just think i was hanging out over there... which is what I went there thinking   Thanks for any input you may have.

I've had vodka, whiskey, gin, wine, etc. before, but not enough to get me drunk. Maybe like a shot and nothing else. I've had half of a beer and so on, but I'm afraid I'll get totally sick. So I'm thinking that all I do is eat a 6-inch sandwich at Subway, and starting drinking wine. I think I'm going to bring a little more than half a bottle of wine with me to drink, and I'm not sure how much I should drink. Well, and tips would help. Thanks in advance!

On the pack, there is a label which says, 0.40euro, similar to the labels on cigarettes from spain/france, now the cigarette labels state the price per pack, if this is the case with the sheesha tobacco label, then this would mean that it is being sold somewhere for 0.40 euros, but where??    I have scanned the label and put in online, here is a link,    http://g.imagehost.org/0191/sheesh_label...
