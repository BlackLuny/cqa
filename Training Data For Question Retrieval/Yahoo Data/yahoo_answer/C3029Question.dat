20090220171259AAtK0Ur	Local Businesses;United States;Houston	Houston Wedding Ceremony Venues (unique)?	How to make a long story short... Me and my fiancee cannot have a traditional church wedding because, for one, he lives in another state and can't come to classes or retreats that easily. The church I belong to is booked for over a year and that is too long for us to wait considering the long-distance element and other reasons we need to get moving. All the other churches want us to be a member for 6 months before the let us set a date. I'd like to get married this summer. Does anybody know of any a) churches that have lenient membership and counseling requirements for couples who want to marry and/or b) unique places for an indoor ceremony (museums, etc.) that are not expensive? I don't mind creativity. Thanks.
