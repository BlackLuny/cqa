20090222144245AAr1xzM	Social Science;Psychology	Common reasons for total loss of motivation?	For the past 4 years I have been dealing with a nearly evaporated drive. Specifically motivation and will to get ahead, keep up, rule in, rule out, fit in, succeed, impress, stand by and connect to. For a lot of people, the answer is "just hang in there", as to imply I was thinking about not hanging in there? Suicide? No. That's not an answer. There in lies the problem. What IS the answer? DON'T SAY GOD. Regardless of my love life, social standings, family and physical health, when my brain tries to process reason for being it hits a dead end and echos back the question repeatedly. I stand starring into nothingness repeating the question in my head. Reason for being? My brain tries its best to give me positive answers. Its about the kids, the future, the money, one special girl, legacy. These answers check in and check out as quick as fads. I don't want to hurt myself, or hurt others. But im seemingly in auto-pilot now'a days. And to be honest, it is finally getting old. Im passionate. But disconnected. Im lost in an ocean thats only 3 feet deep.

20090222150007AAn0NdH	Social Science;Psychology	I hear voices in my head...?	for all of my life, there has come a time, once a year, when i tend to hear voices in my head. i tend to hear them on the same day of every year. i hear them around the dates of Febuaray 23-Febuaray 26. before i fall asleep, right before, i tend to hear voices that keep me in this state. although almost asleep, i am completly aware of what is going on. i can stand up, walk around, feel, smell, see, and hear everything as normal, but theres another sense that comes over me. ever since i was a small child, this has happend to me, and its almost that time again. so im seeking out help from anyone who can help me. if you dont have anything serious to say please dont waste my time and i wont waste yours.   the voices consist of many different people which i will introduce to you.   the first is an older man, i have seen him once standing in my room. he is the first voice i hear. i am able to comunicate with him. one night i asked him to stop talking to me and he wouldnt, so i decided to be brave and told him to show himself, and he did, but all i saw was a black shadow outline of a strong well built older man. i did thinking and decided to find out who he was, i asked him wat his name was. he replied that he was Anthony Mansfield. after doing some reaserch, the man who had built this house was named anthony mansfield and he had died in the family room downstairs on his death bed.   the second voice i hear is of, i would say, 3 men. they begin to converse like they are playing cards at a table, and pretty soon they get louder and angrier until they are screaming at the top of thier lungs and i cant hear anything but them, they swear and yell and it sounds like they throw things and not a split second after they finally stop, i hear a lady scream at the top of her lungs. ive never heard anything like this. its an earshattering screach that would scare even the toughest of men.   now, the last one, only happend once. and if i think about it enough, i can still hear it exactly how i heard it before. its a voice, that once it all calmed down, begins to count. 1...2...3...4...5...6!!!!!! louder and louder, and he shouts six at the top of his lungs.    now this isnt always how it goes. its always different, that was 3 years ago. last year i just heard some people casually talking. even though i could clearly hear the talking, i couldnt make out what they are saying. and i was laying in bed, and i seen my bed sink in by my feet. like someone was sitting there, but there was nothing there at all.    this all used to scare me, bt now i can sit up as if nothings happening, with no fear and try to comunicate, but it seems like this bores them as they tend to stop when im not afraid. so for the next few nights, i will try to fear them and record what i hear, if it records anything than im not crazy. if anyone out there can help me, i would be much appriciated.   -oh ya, i dont smoke, drink or take any meds, i have no alergies or alegic reactions to anything, ive never been to a psych ward and have no record. im not an angel but im not a bad prson. i am not crazy and my IQ is normal. i attend the same school as majority and i fit in fairly well with others. so if you think im a schiz, u should see the guy at work.   NO STUPID COMMENTS, THANK YOU!

20090222150824AALlefJ	Social Science;Psychology	Why is it so hard for me to help myself?	i'm a smart 19 year old girl. i'm fairly attractive. i have a loving boyfriend. i have a decent amount of trustworthy friends, i am grateful for the car that my mother bought and pays for. i have the greatest cat in the world... but i am always alone. i am never content with myself. last semester i did great in school. and this semester i feel like i don't have strength. my mom left me home alone for two weeks nad its not even the end of the first week and the place is a mess. i don't get anything done unless my boyfriend is around. when he isn't i am a mess. i feel so needy and dependent on him. i havent been taking car of myself. i keep on making appointments for the doctor, dentist and i just don't go and haven't rescheduled. i have so much homework that needs to be done and i don't know why i am not doing it. i feel so down most of the time. i have a lot of guilt regarding my past i have been treated for depression in the past and i have been hospitalized due to self injury. although i have not cut in over a year there rarely isn't aday where i don't think of harming myself. i sometimes reach out for cold medicine in my closet and i just want to take nyquil so i can sleep whenever im alone. i just want to sleep. i need to be in the company of people or else i just feel dead. i know i need help. there is something wrong with me, a chemical imbalance most definitely. i just can't see it in myself to get help. i am so self destructive. it's as if i have this fear of being successful, like i'm not worthy of it. and here i am asking for help when i've just unplugged my telephone cords and shut off my cell phone and signed off of messenger. i want help so bad but i don't want to seem like i'm begging for attention so i just am hiding from the world today. i want so bad for my boyfriend to come over and hug me and be with me and just help me write my papers. i don't like being alone. i don't like depending on people so much, but i do. i need help. why is this happening?

20090222152833AAmG96n	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	What is it that women do to raise men's self esteem?	It's so often expected that a man is to do things which raise a woman's self esteem and improve her life. In fact women have long even built their future expectations on ideal conceptualizations of a dreamy prom night, beautiful marriage proposal, and "Mr. Right"- all roles that women rely in full on the effort of men.       Giving compliments, added attention, asking women on dates or inviting them to places, buying gifts, courting, chivalry- I mean, wow. Look at this list of things that men provide to women (and most of these are provided to women whom the man doesn't even have a stake in as of yet, these could be women in an acquaintance role)      Even a man talking to a woman and giving her personal attention (especially when women provide this far less often to men) is an example of men putting effort to raising women's spirits an self esteem.       >>> So I'm having trouble finding what it is that women do to raise men's self esteem. Most especially I'm looking for examples outside of relationships, things which women do to raise the self esteem of men whom they aren't related to or in a committed relationship with. But all general examples are welcome.
20090222153947AAIIwcI	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Very weird dream!! what does this mean?!?	ok so last night i had a really weird dream. heres how it goes:      ok so for some reason for my winter camp at church that happened last week, we were going to chicago(and we live in southern california!) so before we went, we went to a bokstore and got a bunch of candy, which i smashes all together, and it turned a rosy pink, even though it had chocolate bars and skittles and stuff. we put all our candy in a basket that we took with us(except it dissapeared later). and apparently the bookstore turned into an amusement park, and we were at an Anne Frank memorial park, and a rollercoaster crashed, but dissapeared when it hit the ground, right behind us. then the scene changed again and we were on our way up a mountain in a car. so on the way up a mountain, it was snowy and really icy, but we didnt put chains on. going down the mountain, it was extremely steep, and there was water at the bottom. all of a sudden, the car dissapeared, and we all had floaties on, and we were on a raft going down the hill. we went down really fast, then landed in the water. then all of a sudden again, the scene changed and we were hiking up a dry mountain with no snow or anything. then the basket with the candy reappeared, and we ate our candy. then we were at our camp. then i think my mom was trying to wake me up(in real life), and my dream started to change, and the last thing i remember was a girl(wait it was me! i forgot, somehow my shorts fell off so i was in a rlly short maroon dress) and i had goose legs....weird.      soo ya it was really weird. what could this mean? thanks!

I've seen some people on here who's life's are horrible. My best friend's life sucks. I really feel for those people out there who's life's really do suck, but some of us have it easier then others.

20090222154206AAGPAnZ	Social Science;Psychology	Am I incapable of feeling attraction?	I am a twenty-two year old male who feels like he's never felt any real attraction to anyone.  Throughout high school I waited for feelings of attraction to girls and even pretended to like them as we dated throughout my adolescence.  I've been coming to terms with the fact that I might be gay but now fear that I feel no attraction to anyone.  I also am a very anxious and depressed person (I'm on Abilify and Ativan for both conditions) and feel that may be relevant to my inability to feel real attraction and (hopefully someday) love.      I'm over a barrel searching for someone who has shared a similar experience and eventually loved.  Man or woman it does not matter to me, I can accept that now (I had a lot of trouble dealing with my possibly being gay the past few years) and fear that I've repressed feelings and now they may not come back.  Please let me know if this lack of attraction could have anything to do with my depression and anxiety.  Long story short: do I have any hope to date and fall in love like a normal person?

The problem is that I'll get interested in something (for example, a TV show, or a band) and then, all of a sudden, I find myself trying to find out everything about it, scouring the web for ALL of the episodes/ EVERY song the band's come out with. Then I'll get involved in the various 'fandoms'. Yeah, that involves fanfiction, etc.      I'll get obsessed with whatever it is to the point of having a routine of checking the pages every day. This can last for a long time, or a few weeks. Then I'll just go right off it again, usually getting "re-obsessed" with it at a later date.      I've always been a person who goes through "phases":   I did the whole 'Pokemon' thing, I got very interested in designing web pages for a while etc. So I suppose it's kinda like a 'throwback' to my childhood, or something...?      It's especially annoying me because I have my GCSEs this year, and instead of finishing up all of my work and studying (like I should), I keep indulging my obsessions.

Look for outside reassurance, and approval, act needy and desperate for friendship, acceptence and validation......get hung up and bothered about what people say and think about me..... and if people dont give me approval....attention....acceptence....o... reject me.........i become deeply angry about it ----- bordering on losing my conduct and behaving antisocially.         get angry at people condescending me or belittling me or treating me like a charity case , feel affected by those trying to make me feel inferior........become angry, lose focus.....fail to assert myself effectively.....become too emotional -- too affected by what others say and do and think .            im 31 now , have borderline personality disorder and ptsd --- endured a very tough life, abuse , bullying victimisation etc -- as a result ive never lived a normal life, never built any relationships ever, never been employed- always suffered severe low self esteem. rage problems and agression.            for years ive tried to develop, self belief, confidence in myself, to not care what people think about me, or care about what people say , trust my own judgement and believe that it only matters what i think.      but i still struggle to do it, and im finding alot, that i still do what i always did .         i just wanna be this unfazed , laid back man, who is self reliant, confident in his own abilities and in myself and who doesnt try hard to do anything or to be accepted, and just has a ' whatever ' attitude .      but i can never do it or pull it off.               i admit, i wanna be needed and wanted, be accepted , but i always act that way even being disloyal to myself...         almost like : ill do anything, accept me at any cost......doesnt matter about my dignity or self respect.      when i try to be laid back and whatever attitude.......accept me or dont......thats when this ugly desperation always shows through.

So My Dream Was A Little Mixed Up With Some Thing From Realife:   I saw this Indian lady going somewhere and I bumped into her and she smiled and I bowed and she smiled more and bowed back to me.   Then my crush was hugging me with a black arm for hours. (he's not black?) So then people where putting this in the news. So then I ended up with lots of random students and my crush was there....he looked different though....his head was big and he had a mono brow that was black (lol) and I saw him with this little midget that looked exactly like my crush but only little and had curly hair. When I came he saw me and he said "Whoa damn she is tall!" and my crush said "I know!" and so then starr (a girl from my old school) came back from shopping with some other 2 girls that I don't know in real life. (I didn't get a good image of those 2 girls though) and she said "Phew, where done with shopping." and then some random student said "Omg I want to become one of those shopping ladies!" and the coach said "No sorry, were out of that." and well then we had to play a game of easter and we did so we went outside and we saw easter eggs everywhere. I picked a few of them and then in some spot I saw many easter eggs together. Then I said "Is that where you put your easter eggs?" and a girl from my church said "Yes" so I put them there. Then I started to think my crush didn't like me anymore because he was ignoring me. In real life I don't see my crush anymore because I left my old school. And I don't think about my crush so I don't know how he appeared in my dream.   This dream last for 47 minutes. I felled back to sleep at 7:05 AM and woke up at 7:52 AM      What does this dream mean?
20090222051620AAetpIj	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Have any other guys notice this about older women these days?	Are you finding that older women are expecting (especially younger men) to help them, when they are struggling with something physically?      In the last month alone, I have been in situations where the woman didn't ask, but you can tell they expected me to help. I will just list 1 for it would be too long to list all. This older woman (maybe 60) was at the dumpster taking out her trash. (we have to drive to our dumpster) I pull up behind her waiting for her to finish. She was sitting in her car, with trunk open, when I pulled up. She gets looks out looks at me, then proceeds to struggle to get 1 bag out. She could have done it, but it would have took 6 very long trips. I could tell she wanted help and needed help. So I did help. But I'm seeing this more and more. Women moving, heaving big heavy bags/items at the store, mechanical problems, etc. What is going on with older women (40+)? Do they still expect men to be a gentleman, while the younger more capable women don't?  Do younger women help old men, if they see them struggling physically? Your opinions please?

Although the Am Bar Assoc estimates that as much as 50% of couples using FAmily Court had violence (and there are higher estimates), this politician seems to believe it is a "gimmick" used to get a better deal.      In fact, many battered women (suffering from PTSD, depression, nervousness, appear "unfriendly" according to "friendly parent" policies) lose custody to batterers (appear in control, charming even). See The Leadership Council on Child Abuse and Stop Family Violence for info on this topic.       How can this politican get away with stating this?      This article states:   "A town official's comment that many women use domestic violence claims as a "gimmick" during divorce has angered supporters of a group that helps abuse victims.      The Conway Board of Selectmen voted 4-1 against $7,500 in town funding for Starting Point, which offers a hot line, shelter, support groups and advocacy services for people who have suffered domestic or sexual abuse."      "Dickinson said he was sorry he upset some people.      "Hell hath no fury like a woman's scorn," he said.      But he said those who took offense should harness their energy and show up at a deliberative session March 2 to overrule the board's Wednesday recommendation.      "They shouldn't be running around gnashing their teeth. They're wasting time," he said. "They should try and take advantage of this thing. But I don't want to talk to a group of 20 raging women individually. I want to talk to a group of women who seriously want to get the appropriation increased."      Voters will make the final decision on the proposed funding in April."       http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/N/N...

There where a whole lot of animals but I only remember a moose and a bear. then down the hill was a wetland and there was a tiger there. It was left free then I see a sign saying " Tiger reserve" made sense that only the tiger was left outside. Now the tiger was in the water and the water had this bright green algae (the kind you find in healthy wetlands) then on the opposite bank I see this huge white tiger it was at least twice the size of the tiger in the water. Then the white tiger snuck into the water and went under and I could see the sneak past the tiger. I was impressed with the white tiger because it snuck past the tiger without it even realizing that the white tiger was inches from it,
20090222154419AANIJ0T	Social Science;Economics	Question regarding economics?	Theresa runs a pizza shop in a college community. For years, hers was the only restaurant within four blocks of the college dorms. Now two new restaurants, an Asian noodle restaurant and a Mexican taco restaurant, open on the same block and become just as popular among the students. As a result, students' demand for pizza changes.       Assume that most students view the food served at these other restaurants as reasonably good alternatives to pizza.                     Given the greater availability of substitutes for pizza for these college students, which of the following statements best describes the students' new demand for pizza as compared to their old demand curve for pizza?                                    A.   Demand has become more elastic.               B.   All of these statements are accurate.               C.   On the graph, the new demand curve appears less steep than the old demand curve.               D.   If pizza prices rise, students will shrink their pizza consumption by more than before.               E.   Demand shows a greater responsiveness of quantity to price changes.

She has promoted Title IX as an “implacable hammer” guaranteed to get the attention of recalcitrant faculty. Prompted by Rolison and a growing chorus of activists, the Senate Subcommittee on Science, Technology, and Space held a 2002 hearing on “Title IX and Science.” Later, in 2005, former subcommittee chairmen Senators Ron Wyden (D-OR) and Senator George Allen (R-VA) held a joint press conference with feminist leaders. Wyden declared, “Title IX in math and science is the right way to start.” Allen seconded, “We cannot afford to cut out half our population—the female population.” The Title IX reviews have already begun.       http://www.american.com/archive/2008/mar...

20090222125408AASM6UB	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Are you an individualist or a collectivist?	Quick Wikipedia definitions...      "Individualism is the moral stance, political philosophy, or social outlook that stresses independence and self-reliance. Individualists promote the exercise of one's goals and desires, while opposing most external interference upon one's choices, whether by society, or any other group or institution. Individualism is opposed to collectivism, which stress that communal, community, group, societal, or national goals should take priority over individual goals. Individualism is also opposed to any tradition or other form of external moral standard being used to limit an individual's choice of actions."    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individuali...       "Collectivism is a term used to describe any moral, political, or social outlook, that stresses human interdependence and the importance of a collective, rather than the importance of separate individuals. Collectivists focus on community and society, and seek to give priority to group goals over individual goals.[1][2] The philosophical underpinnings of collectivism are for some related to holism or organicism - the view that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts/pieces. Specifically, a society as a whole can be seen as having more meaning or value than the separate individuals that make up that society.

Hair, nails, hair remover..stuff like that. Today, my mom said "Sweety, do you not love yourself? You are always talking about things you can change but you never talk about what you love about yourself" and I said to her "Mom, if I did, you would see me as narsissistic." So, I told my friend and he was like "You can gloat a little". I replied "Someone once told me I have no need to verbally express how I feel about myself because my looks and body say it all" then he said "It isn't all about looks, you know". I didn't want to talk about the subject anymore. I felt like he proved to me why it is a bad idea to talk about the good I see in myself.          Is that weird or is it understandable?

20090222121141AAGmboZ	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	What's the difference between family court and criminal court?	What do you know about the differences between family court and criminal court?       Here's something from a blog:   -The criminal court system pits the immense powers of the state against the accused. In marked contrast, family court is merely a stage set by the state where two private individuals can come to battle out their personal differences, using their own devices, with the state acting more as a weak referee, and wielding very little power.         -When victims of violence against women try to deal with a violent relationship in family court, it's as if the victim, herself, is getting into a boxing ring with the violent perpetrator; a boxing ring where the victim must fight it out with her abuser using only her own devises. In contrast, in criminal court, it's the all powerful state that gets in the boxing ring with the abuser.      -It's at that next court date that the abuser so often comes into court fully armed not only to shoot down her accusations, but also to launch his own set of unrestricted accusations against the victim. True or untrue, he piles it on: 'she uses drugs', 'hits the kids', 'neglects the kids', 'drives drunk', 'is crazy', 'won't get a job.' 'works all the time,' 'is mentally ill', "spends the rent money," and whatever other rant comes into his abusive head.      -In contrast, in criminal court the accused cannot launch counter charges against the victim who is only a witness for the state.      from:    http://www.justicewomen.com/help_family_... 
20090222113343AAPs1Tu	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	If fear is enough to convict for domestic violence...?	If fear is enough to convict a person for domestic violence, then explain this:      1) fear is the number one predictor of femicide. Yet, nothing is being done to prevent 1500 women a year from being killed from their boyfriend or husband      2) Claims of domestic violence are given little or no weight in court. Abusers get custody (more than 50,000 children each year are given over in sole/joint custody).      3) Claims of abuse can result in the woman appearing as "unfriendly." IN today's courts, "friendly parents" policies rule. If a person alleges abuse, they are often considered "unfriendly" and can be fined, jailed or lose custody.       4) Why don't women report their abuse? We all know that pro-arrest policies were created b/c women didn't have the ovaries to have their abusers arrested.       5) many women have been arrested under pro-arrest laws. is that based on their boyfriend/husbands fear?       6) why would just women use fear to prosecute and not men?       7) why is it that states have actually had states of emergencies b/c of the high rate of domestic violence/homicide -  are these states of emergency based on people's fear?       8) if so many men are being charged unfairly with domestic violence (based only on women's fear), why is it still such a problem? Is imprisonment not a deterent?
20090222124711AAVCJnC	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Should people that allege abuse lose custody of children?	Here's a woman that alleges abuse and the child is given over to the alleged abuser. (more than 50,000 children a year are placed in similar circumstances)        http://www.indianapolisrecorder.com/arti...       Here are excepts:   Nelson has learned that an ex-boyfriend will retain custody of her seven-year-old daughter, Kay. An ugly custody battle involving allegations of molestation and mental illness continues.      According to Nelson, biased judges and attorneys have refused to remove Kay from the father’s home, despite serious allegations of abuse in that household. Nelson, who raised Kay for the first six years of her life, believes custody should be returned to her or to Blaylock, Kay’s maternal grandmother.      In May, 2001, Kay was born to Tracie Nelson and ex-boyfriend Billy Dupree (Dupree refused to speak with the Recorder regarding the case). From Kay’s birth Nelson had sole legal custody of her. Although the relationship between Nelson and Dupree ended, Nelson said she understood the importance of a father’s presence in a child’s life and encouraged Dupree to visit Kay.      In September 2004, Kay began exhibiting unexplained sexual behavior, which a nurse at Community North Hospital later stated was very unusual for a girl her age. This puzzled Nelson because she knew her daughter had no reason to be with any man other than her father, who occasionally had Kay at his home for overnight visitations.      To date, Nelson has only occasional supervised visits with Kay that she must pay for, and Kay is not allowed to keep gifts or other items.         -Should alleged child abusers get custody?       -Why isn't the court protecting children? Whose "best interest" is the court for?       -Should the person alleging abuse lose custody?

HB 480 requires couples with dependent children who seek a no-fault divorce to take a 10-hour crisis marriage education course -- first.       "Having children raised with a mother and father is the desire of my heart, to make that happen," said Chisum. "We can save emotional heartache by keeping them together."       Under the legislation, the state requires the course, but doesn't pay for it. Couples would have to foot the bill for the course, which could run up to $200 an hour.       "Let's just make a little effort, put a few hours in, saying, what can we do to restore this marriage," Chisum said.       Advocates against domestic abuse worry about an unintended consequence -- that the bill would make it harder for a spouse in an abusive relationship to leave the marriage, putting him/her at greater risk.         - should couples with family violence have to take the course?      - how will poor families pay for this or is it just for the rich?       - why cant people have the freedom to divorce without the government trying to teach them something about love & marriage?

I know, I know there's 'scientific evidence' proving how the 'female' mind operates differently from the 'male' mind, but what if, through self hypnosis and things like that, a person could learn to develop behavioral patterns, reactions, etc. that were exactly like a man's? Is this a question for how mainstream society is run, or is this just 'nature'?   Really isn't this mindset for how a woman should act, etc. something created by traditions and how people are portrayed in then media?    I, myself, have an androgynous  nature, and for that reason am thought of as boyish (because most women are TOO feminine...). Most of my friends have been guys, etc so this is how I see things.      I think people are just living by stereotypes, so other than physical potential, I don't see why our mentalities aren't/can't therefore be the same. If American culture was different, then perhaps, the sexes would truly be 'equal'?   I don't know it just seems so stupid and this has been bothering me for a while.

I admire people who are comfortable in their own skin and are able to sit calmly for hours and talk to anyone about any topic.They can talk about music, food, politics, cinema, history of the world, geography with ease and without being arrogant. I admire the language they use, the way they express their opinions, their body language. Somehow they seem to have a better life.      I lack all of this. I dream of being in a setting where I am completely comfortable talking to people. I am not a knowledgeable person. I know that I should focus on one topic that interests me and deepen my knowledge about it and I do watch the news and know some current events but I don't know why they happened originally but in the process when someone talks to me or asks me about some well-known historical or political figure or a famous novelist or artist, my ears block and I start to clown and people notice my lack of knowledge of course. It's very embarrassing. How do I catch up with everyone around me. How do I know the names and works of all these presidents, novelists, presidents, kings and queens?

20090222124211AAVpBB5	Social Science;Psychology	Why am I feeling so jealous?	My boyfriend's adopted mum and her partner have just moved right by us, (they lived about an hour away before) because his mum is having a lot of problems with athiritis and her partner is losing his memory rapidly. So they moved by us to be looked after. (Nobody bothered with them where they used to live.) We both do things like clean for them and take them places but I can't help feeling pushed out. My boyfriend used to be there for me all the time, now I keep thinking he cares more for his mum and her partner. He is making her get a wheel chair for example as she can hardly walk. That hurts me as I feel his concerns are only for his mum nowadays. I hate feeling so bitter and hurt but whenever we argue or say nasty things to each other in temper, I keep thinking, 'I bet he wouldn't talk to his mum like that.' I just feel so depressed.   I love his mum and I do care but I feel unimportant. I keep trying to get my partners attention by refusing to eat and getting drunk to see how much he cares for me. How can I stop this? I get hurt whenever he phones his mum or goes to see them and I can't help it! What can I do? Please help.
20090222134243AA91iP6	Social Science;Psychology	I feel as though I'm wasting time?	Everday, I've been trying to do more with my life then just do the normal routine of a 16-year-old Honors student with some friends, because I know that a month from now I'll have to decide whetherto get back surgery for my scoliosis or not. I'm really scared, and I feel like  the most important thing I want to do in my life is help other people, make other people happy, and have fulfiling experiences. My friends of eleven years are jerks now, and I haven't been able to find anything special which will at least comfort me a little. I volunteer to teach at a dance school as well as at religious education, I am a Best Buddies volunteer, I peer mentor, I help a lot of people with their schoolwork, and I've created a website to help girls:  http://share.buddy4u.com/view/%28heartbr...  The problem is, I still don't feel like I'm doing enough and my fear of what's to come eats away at me. Does anyone have any advice? =[ Thanks ?

20090222143355AA6bUAQ	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Do you agree with these statements? A woman's place is in the home. A woman's only tool is her body.?	I think that women deserve equal rights, but honestly, a woman's place is in the home taking care of her children and husband. Once a woman gets out of the kitchen, she acts like an irresponsible little tr*mp whose only tool is her body. I am a woman, but even I can admit that only a few women can do something good outside of the home.      A woman's body is her only tool. That's why women use their sexuality to get ahead.   When you see successful women (especially in the media), the only reason they are famous or successful is because they use their body.      How come women look at famous celebs who strip down to "empower women"?

20090222125754AANZXeK	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	What 'might' be going on in his mind?..if anything at all?	The guy who i like ALOT moved to a different state a month ago. I dont know if he likes me or not because he replies to all my emails but he is kind of private and rarely talks about his personal self. he talks about everything else in the world BUT himself. He does flirt time to time but not all the time or very often.       So in order to see how he would react, i randomly told him about this other guy who likes me alot....of course i dont like him back but i just wanted to see what he would say and react to it. I mentioned about this guy who likes me in an email that i sent him(we usually communicate through emails).....when i did receive his reply, he said NOTHING about the guy who likes me....like he spoke about everything else....the email was long...but didn't even mention his name or said anything about him.....what is this suppose to mean?....whats going on with him?      (oh and if you want to tell me that i should not try to working anything out online, please dont bother answering...he visits this state often so i can work this out if i want...)

20090222131216AAiMbYF	Social Science;Anthropology	A warmer climate allows you to get more out of life?	Do you think that a warmer climate can allow you to get more out of life that a colder one? I've lived all over Michigan, New Hampshire, and Chicago(all with cold, snowy winters) and it just seems that ever since I can remember, life has slowed down to nearly half it's pace for at least 6 months out of the year. Everyone becomes slightly more reclusive, some even depressed, and every day is a travel from car to shelter, shelter to car. There is less connection with the environment. During the summer I find myself in a general happier mood, I get more involved with friends/family/activities and am generally more productive.   People in warmer climates don't have to deal with these ups and downs. I know that everyone is different but in general, do you think that a warmer/steadier climate seriously contributes to happiness and overall productivity in life.

20090222130736AAQcK0T	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	In my dream I was talking to my deceased grandmother, does it mean anything?	I dreamed that I was running to go inside my granmother's house. When  I opened the door she was laying on the couch like she always would watching TV. I closed the door & opened it again & she was still there. I ran to her & cried and hugged her. I asked how she could be there if she died 3 yrs ago. She said, "What are you talking about I am always here watching TV. I started crying hugging her and then I saw my dad walking into the room. He asked me, "Who are you talking to and why are you crying?" I told him I was talking to grandma and what she was doing. Then he said, "There is no one there & the TV is not on." Then I woke up.      Before she died, she kept asking if it was 11. That was something I caught and thought maybe she knew what time or what date she was going to pass away. The day she passed away, that morning around 1 a.m. I woke up getting a bad feeling that I was going to lose my grandma soon. Later that day, when I got home my husband said my dad had called. My heart started beating really fast b/c I knew already. I asked him "what time she passed away?" He said, "11:00 a.m."      Another incident, I dreamt that I could see someone in the hospital bed. I couldn't see the face, but I spoke to my grandmother. She was telling me everything was ok. I was crying and apologizing for not being there. Then I felt her hand on my shoulder & told me everthing was going to be fine. She said, " HE is going to be fine, you can't do anything you are out of town." I knew that it was someone else on the bed and not her. 3 days later my husband was in an accident at his work and he called me to tell me. He said, "Don't freak out but I was in an accident, a chain snapped and hit my chest." I cried because I wasn't there with him, he worked out of town on a rig.      As you can see there have been several incidents with my grandmother, does it mean anything. Is she trying to communicate with me?

Other than that, I'm an awkward person. I can never seem to have a normal conversation or be normal. I dunno. Its just how I am.      I'm also a very boring guy. I can never think of things to talk about, especially, when I'm with a girl, and especially when I'm with my girlfriend.      So, i was just wondering what girls want to hear when they are just waiting for a guy to talk, especially when the girl likes the guy. I dontknow whats cheesy and whats not.      I dunno, i guess i'm hopeless, or a lost case, or just a straight loser. But if there's anyway I can change who I am, could someone tell me?       Cuz I have the feeling that my girlfriend doesnt like me anymore. I barely get the chance to go on myspace, but when i did today, i looked at one of the surveys she filled out, and there was stuff that hinted at that she doesnt like me and that she likes someone else.... and she never says "i love you" back, like she used to.... Am i losing her?      Sorry this is just rambling and a bunch of questions combined into one, but I just dont think I'm a good enough person to have her now. But I want to be. I really do.

20090222130005AAweHhf	Social Science;Psychology	How can I know what to do with my life?	I was always an overachiever in school. Didn't have much of a social life, spent a lot of time studying, wasted a lot of time playing video games. Got the highest marks possible in my end of school exams, now I'm a 19 year old guy in first year medicine in university. I have no great desire to be a doctor, but I really wanted to go to university and there wasn't any other degree I wanted to do more.   The thing is, I'm not sure this is right for me. I would not be happy spending the rest of my life working in medicine, even in medical science. I always wanted to be a writer, but I never really put much work into it, only had it as a passive hobby. Same for music and songwriting (I have played the piano for thirteen years now) but I'm at a bit of a junction there; really want to start a band and try to make it big, but terrified by the lack of security. And even if I do make it big... I might be dropped or fed up of the whole scene in ten years and then I have nothing to fall back on. Should I just get through this medical degree so I always have a parachute? But five years is a long time - I'm too old to go in a new direction at twenty three. I know I would die unhappy if I didn't make it in either writing or music, but not in medicine. Then again, I don't know if I love writing or music enough to spend the rest of life at them.And a doctor's job is so damn secure! Please help; I just don't know what to do.

20090222141334AAZjPQo	Social Science;Psychology	Can someone please edit my essay for Social Work?	I am applying to the Master's in Social Work program because I realized that social work is very similar to Psychology, which is my major in undergraduate school. Similar with the exception that it puts more emphasis on helping people find their strengths, rather than giving them a diagnosis and being predominantly problem-focused. My own experience in helping people with their problems, and enjoying it, influenced me to pursue a career in Social Work.      Becoming a full professional with a graduate degree in Social Work represents the culmination of many years of personal and professional preparation.I have always enjoyed working with people and helping them with their problems. At 34, I feel that I have the maturity necessary to perform at my best level once again, as a student. I also have a high level of motivation that accompanies my current position. I work with incarcerated youth who, by the way, are mostly minorities. I am deeply saddened by the explosive incarceration rates in America, specifically the way males lead the way in going to jail, rather than going to college and working. I feel this sense of urgency makes me an excellent candidate for your Master's Program because I am so fully engaged at my place of employment. It is my sincere hope to be able to contribute to discussions on how to best counsel and care for at risk youth. My research interest focuses on boys, especially those at risk for spending their young adulthood behind bars.      I am currently working at Harbor View Adolescent Center. I am a Youth Counselor for incarcerated youth with behavioral and emotional problems in a residential treatment facility. In my job as a youth counselor, my primary work responsibility is to serve as a positive role model for adolescents aged twelve to eighteen. The residents had backgrounds of homelessness and are also victims of physical and sexual abuse. Some of them had problems with drug and alcohol abuse, depression, and with the juvenile justice system. At times, my job could be extremely stressful. But I discovered that I had the ability to connect with the adolescents and develop strong emotional ties with them. I focused on helping them with their social skills, coping skills, and independent living skills. My main goal was to help them build their self-esteem and improve their sense of security.      The adolescents that I have worked with in the residential treatment facility could become physically assaultive at times. It was during these critical situations that I would experience problems in not knowing what the best clinical approach was to use when they were self-harming. I would like to have better tools in order to help these kids when they are in crisis and know whether the interventions are well supported by the literature. I hope that with the aid of a Master's Degree in Social Work, I can achieve that. I want to be able to help the adolescents in their time of crisis  and teach the necessary skills the kids will need to transition into a more independent way of living.      These youth need all the help and attention we can give them in order to prevent recidivism, especially African American and Hispanic males, who tend to continually come back into the system. If you were to grant me the privilege of studying in your program, I would like to research the recidivism rates of African American and Hispanic juveniles and young adults. I hope to contribute our understanding of how we can best go about saving their lives and, at the same time, ease the financial burdens on our society.      The guiding principle of my life is that each of us has a duty to help and serve others, to seek out marginalized and less fortunate individuals of our communities and offer any aid that we can. I have always lived by the motto “do unto others as you would have done to you”, and feel that the best way to do this is by furthering the ideal of social justice in the way I live and work. Social justice, as I see it, is the value system that recognizes the inherent worth and dignity of every human being and the right of everyone to be treated fairly and with respect. I believe that every individual is worthy of dignity and respect and each individual has the ability to become self-sufficient and able to make the best possible decisions for themselves. When we as a society try to see the world through the eyes of the less fortunate, we can empathize with and understand one another instead of focusing on our differences. Only when each and every individual of a community is afforded the same level of dignity and respect can a society truly be called civilized. Those who cannot demand social justice for themselves must have a voice to demand it for them. It is my hope that by earning a Master‘s degree in Social Work I can be that voice.

20090222130508AAGxe90	Social Science;Psychology	What does my dream mean?	I had a dream i was getting married to my boyfriend, Zach. I was getting ready for the wedding and a lil bummed out cause it was in a church and Ive never wanted to get married in a church, (i always wanted to get married outside and on the beach) but i care about him so i looked past that. my dad was acting strange tho and didn't walk me down the aisle. Someone handed me flowers and when i looked at them i hated them, they weren't my favorite kind of flowers, i remember wanting lilies, but because i loved him i didnt let it get to me. I got to the alter and the service went on, when it was over i went to where my mom was who was sitting in the back. everything was just so weird and when i started talking to her i realized...Zach wasn't up there with me! Who did i get married to? i was up there alone! why didnt anyone tell me?? i started running to the back and one of my good friends named Justin stopped me. He said "dont go, Hes not worth it" i tried to get him out of my way...i had to find zach. But Justin picked me up over his head and started carrying me back to the alter. When i looked down into Justin's eyes all i saw was green!. he was holding me up in the air and looking right at me and his eyes were so green! he put me down and i ran past him outside. I got to this shore and looked out into this dark water, then i saw Zach, he was sitting on a tiny little island. He looked scared, his knees where to his chest and he had a hood over his head. plus he wouldn't look at me as i yelled his name. i started yelling "Zach! Y didn't u come??" "y weren't u there??" "baby! Come here, swim." but he never looked up, then Justin had caught up to me. He grabbed my arm and said "Stop, just leave him alone" "Forget it, it will be OK, just stop!". then i just walked off.                         What does this mean??

20090222133927AAoSrVu	Social Science;Psychology	Have you ever used reverse Psychology to motivate you?	I know I have, for instance, sometimes when I am going to hang out with a girl i might like, I say tell myself that she doesn't like me, she is just being nice, etc. Then I will try to prove myself wrong, and I will then try and have a fun time with her. Is this normal? Or would it be better just to face the situation as it is.
20090222134457AAX2ieO	Social Science;Psychology	Who knew? Fear of microphones?	This is really weird. In one of my college classes, our teacher speaks to us in a large auditorium that requires use of a microphone in order for everyone to hear him. Without fail, the mic will have sudden jolting outbursts of feedback that scare me half to death at least several times during the two hour period. I think I've developed a small fear of microphones, because in church today, I felt very uncomfortable that the pastor's mic would do that same, even though it's never happened in that setting. Is there any way to temper the start of this growing into something bigger?
