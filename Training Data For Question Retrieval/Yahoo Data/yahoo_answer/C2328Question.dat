20090223155441AAcXyjY	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	How different is college from high school?	My mom and dad don't think I'm ready to go off to college. Their making excuses for me not to go. Their saying I'm immature because I don't go out every weekend with my friends, and they say that I showed no improvement in my grades this year(I actually raised my GPA a whole letter grade, so I really don't know what my parents are smoking). I really don't like high school, but my parents are basing my high school experience as to what college might be for me. They are thinking that because I hate high school, college will be the same for me.    I really want to get away though and honestly think that college will be better for me. I'm even taking a college class at my local community college and have no problem with it!    So are my parents right? Will college suck for me? Will I not be able to handle it?

20090223161357AAAMngc	Education & Reference;Primary & Secondary Education	My son was forced to mop the school floors.  What can I do about it?	My 2nd grader is a straight A student.  Never gets into trouble and is such a good kid that his teachers actually told me that having a parent teacher conference was pointless because there was nothing to really discuss.      Today as we were walking out of the school, his friend asked him why he was mopping the floor.  Turns out my son didn't get all of the mud off of his shoes after recess and some aid made him alone mop the hall 3/4 length of the school. I am so furious!!  He wasn't the only one with dirty shoes and he's actually really cautious about that sort of thing so I know it was an accident.  Why was it necessary to pull him out of class to make him clean the hall?  Certainly he was not the only child of all the kids at recess to have dirt on his shoes.  Why was he allowed to track it all the way down the hallway and only then told to clean it up?  Is there anything I can do about this?  I thought that is what a janitor was for.  I certainly don't pay taxes in this community and pay my son's school fees for him to be missing classes.

York University just had a strike and I heard stories about how students are failing, or they're losing their money or their year may be extended. Are these true?

20090223164117AAXh8rx	Education & Reference;Financial Aid	Will this online "college" steal my financial aid and loan money?	I just filled out my FAFSA a few days ago. I think that I got talked into going to an online college. I got a call from Ashford University Online, and the advisor, who seemed to be a pretty good sales man, talked me into filling out an application and FAFSA. I used the schools Federal Code on the FAFSA.       But just a few minutes ago, I made a correction on the FAFSA and deleted the school. Is it to late? Will Ashford receive the money anyways once the money is approved?      My EFC is 378 so I'm positive that I'm going to receive grant and loan money. Here's my problem...They want me to start class tomorrow. If I attend the online class, that's shows that I'm acknowledging that I'm am a student. But if I don't show up, I'm afraid that they'll eventually get there hands on my financial aid anyways, and then I'll have to default, so I'll be out of money with no education at all. I was unaware that I had better options!

My teacher gave us a paper but we need to underline all the verbs within it, but I have a really hard time knowing which are verbs can someone please help me?      This is the story and all the verbs must be underlined      It was a warm summer day when I decided to teach my older sister to drive.   As, we were walking out the door, I told her, “Don’t forget to grab the keys from the kitchen table.”   Once we were in the car, I noticed that she hadn’t even grabbed the right keys.   As my sister ran back into the house to get the right keys, I could tell that this would be an adventure.   Finally I was backing out of our driveway looking for a place that had little traffic.   Once I found a spot, I turned off the car and switched places with my sister.   She got into the driver’s seat and I could see her hands shaking from being so nervous since this was the first time she had ever driven a car.   I told her, “Just relax, and start the car.”   She put the car into gear and slowly eased away from the curb while saying, “I don’t know if I can do this, what if we crash?”   I told her that it would all be fine as long as she watched the speed limit and for other cars.   Everything seemed to be going fine so I reassured her that she was doing great.   I saw a stop sign up ahead, so I told her, “Slowly start pushing the brake pedal and come to a complete stop behind the crosswalk lines.”   But instead of pushing the brake pedal, my sister pressed the gas pedal even harder.   Before I knew it, we slammed into another car in the intersection.   As my sister yelled at me, “I told you we would crash!” I knew that this would be the first and last of our driving lessons together.

I am a 29 year old guy who works 40 hour work weeks as an electrician.    I always wanted to b a programmer but when i was young i had a kid and took on the responsibility's of life. I took a chance and went through 4 years of a tech school get my electrician license while working as an electrician.

Yes they are paying back school loans now but i am just looking at the fastest way to "get my foot in the door" make more income then i can worry about more schooling, I really want to follow the career i had dreamed of going to college for but have not had the time or convenience to.... your thoughts please
20090223162710AAfmCc6	Education & Reference;Words & Wordplay	Does this make sense?	i had to explain in detail an event that is similar to the holocaust that has taken place since WWII. (bosnia,Rwanda,Darfur,and/or pol pot etc..)              so i wrote this            The Kurdish genocide and the nazi genocide were very similar. During the 1980’s Saddam Hussein had a campaign against a group of people called the Kurds. The Kurds are a group of people who don’t have their own nation . They live spread across the middle east and eastern Europe. They live Iraq ,Iran, Syria, Turkey And the former soviet union. When Iraq was on war with Iran the Kurds posed a real threat to Iraq because they were Iranian sympathizers during the war and aided Iran with their guerilla forces. When Hitler came to power he had to deal with people who opposed him and to solve that problem he had to get rid of them and that’s the same thing that Saddam Hussein did. Iraq didn’t even encourage the Kurds to leave Iraq. They just started killing them with strong chemicals bombs. The Kurds were often held as prisoner and were taken from their homes and forced to move to locations where they would live they had no choice. It was go or get killed by the army. Kurds were also tortured, starved, rape and even abused by the state sponsored secret police forces. Although there are difference between the genocides, they were both incredibly similar.              im not very good at global its so confusing

Sometimes (or better to say mostly) a 'news' is only an official verion of an event and many surrounding facts are overlooked due to many reasons.  I am thinking about writing informal versions of a news where I could give more information using a more relaxed language (an excuse for my bad English?) and I am looking for an interesting title for this particular column on my website.  I need a title which indicates the importance of the information, while deos not imply judgement.  I thought of words like "Deformalized" or "De-officialized" (ok! i know it is not a word but this wrong word suits the type of contents I intend to write).  Could anyone come up with a correct English word or idom which could convey the meaning you feel from "De-officialized"?    Now, apart from this, I would like to invite those interested to contribute to the website.  I also very much appreciate if anyone is ready to proof read/edit our materials.

20061112094032AAC2cNS	Education & Reference;Primary & Secondary Education	Have you heard of same sex schools ? Good idea ??	I`ve been hearing about this alot latley. Sounds like the way to go to me.It has been proven by brain function tests that Boys and girls learn in different ways, and (take math for instance) Boys do well in it at younger ages girls a couple years later but yet our school system teaches them all at the same age. That is why boys tend to have less trouble and girls fall behind in math.The schools they have tested this in have Less drop outs better GPA, less teen pregnancies, less flirting more studying going on.and all the kids seem to have better self esteem which leads to less teen suicides.

I started out in the practical nursing program last September and took my general eds. However due to personal issues I had to quit. Since I did not officially withdraw, I recieved all "F"s for the semester. One F is enough to get you kicked out of the competitive program and you have to reapply.       Well I switched programs for one semester to IT and got all A's and a B. Now that I proved myself I was hoping they would let me back in the nursing program. But they said I have to go before the appeals board and I am scared! I don't know what they will ask me or what to say.       Any suggestions?      What are my chances?

20070518094907AACXaI2	Education & Reference;Teaching	What are some postive things about small learning communities?	A Small Learning Community, is a form of school structure most commonly used in secondary schools to subdivide large school populations into smaller, autonomous groups of students and teachers.      The primary purpose of restructuring secondary schools into SLCs is to create a more personalized learning environment to better meet the needs of students. Each community will often share the same teachers and student members from grade to grade.      SLCs can take several forms:      -Theme-Based Smaller Learning Communities or Focus Schools Usually formed around a specific curricular theme. Examples might include "Success Academy" or "Humanities".      -Houses May be themed or non-themed or separated by grade levels.      -Career Academies A three or four year structure developed around a career theme or Career Clusters. Characterized by career-related electives and integration of career theme across entire academic curriculum.      -Freshmen Academies Structure designed to support 9th grade student

The darkness, ever so black as ebony, revealed the elegant gleams of moon-light that gracefully shone through my bedroom window.  Silvery stars sparkled in the night sky, as if to soothe the griefs and agonies of the desolate soul.  Droplets of soft, icy frost glittered the naked beauty of the Swiss Alps as she boldly stretched her gentle arms to embrace the welcoming charm that fell from the boundless sky.        A thousand thoughts raced through my mind, tossing and turning it like a whirlwind, as if to contrast the angelic peacefulness of the night.  It was hard to determine where I was going or what I was planning to do, as the future refused to become clear to me.  Only one figure continually pounded the resoluteness of my mind – and yes!  It was the mocking grin on Grinarold’s face which betrayed him for who he really was.  There, as I lay on my bed, cold and uncomfortable, shivered at the thought of his very existence.

I got very close to him last year when I noticed he was getting very muscular without even working out like I did at his age.    I figured he'd have my gymnastics skills as well. He does, I've been teaching him gymnastics ever since.    The Gym Class teacher gave him a C! My nephew told me he has it in for him because the teacher said he'd give an A to whomever could climb the vertical rope without using his legs, and he was the only boy who was able to do it. Other boys who couldn't climb the rope got As, yet he got a C.   I know he can climb a vertical rope with ease, and I remember I used to be the only boy who was able to do that back in school too.   So I believe him if he tells me the teacher has it in for him.   My older sister (his mom) doesn't seem to care, so I want to go his school and complain about the C.      What's the best way to handle this???????

I took the placement test, and it recommended me for Algebra 1, even though I already took it. I could retake the test, and try out for Geometry, but I might not get an A in it. But, I could pass Algebra 1 with an A. Is it better to take Algebra 1 again or Geometry? And do Universities such as Stanford or UC Berkeley look at these kind of stuff? Because if I take Algebra 1 again, I can only take Pre-Calculus during high school year, not calculus. Which class should I take that would be better on my trascript and could have a higher chance of making me excepted for Stanford or UC Berkeley?

Ok, so my mom works in a school district in a town that's like, 15 minutes away and before I started high school she asked me if I would like to transfer districts because that district offers more opportunities accademically and sports-wise. But I decided to stay in my town because of friends and stuff. But now I'm deciding if I want to transfer or not. I'm not really happy about my school right now, like I don't feel like I'm being challenged enough, my friends are going in different directions and I have some more friends in the other district, and I wouldn't mind a change. But I'm just wondering if there's anyone out there who has transfered in this time of their life and could offer me some perspective. I have to decide in the next 2-3 weeks. Also, my dad isn't too happy about this, he just doesn't understand why I want to change and keeps telling me the negatives and I don't want that to influence my decision.

Or when I'm 91   with silver hair   and sitting in a barber's chair,   may rival gangsters   with hamfisted tommyguns burst in   and give me a short back and insides.      Or when I'm 104   and banned from the Cavern   may my mistress   catching me in bed with her daughter   and fearing for her son   cut me up into little pieces   and throw away every piece but one.      Let me die a youngman's death,   not a free from sin tiptoe in   candle wax and waning death,   not a curtains drawn by angels borne   'what a nice way to go' death      anything will help   :) thanks

I know they only count your highest score but if my two scores end up being very different.   I just got my results back and I got a 570 in reading, 540 in math, and 640 in writing= in total 1750. I was very upset because these are the lowest results I have ever gotten on a practice test and I was very surprised with how I got them. If I knew I would cancel the scores. Anyway I want to get into very competitive colleges like Columbia, Cornell, Georgetown, NYU, Michigan. Now I am afraid that even if I get higher the second time they are not going to like that I got those scores the first time. Also I want to take my SAT's another two times but I heard its preferable not to take them more then twice. I am really really worried because with these scores I cant even get into the schools I wanted to put as safeties like U Maryland, GW, and Boston U. What should I do??? Btw I dont know if this helps but my GPA is probably between 3.5-3.7.

It's just as good as any other source people. get a grip.   Yes there is an off-chance it can be modified but any random person but it is known to be 99.999% accurate within a very small margin of error.      It is the quickest & most convenient way to find things, and I am aggravated by all you who complain about me using it.   You so called "professionals" expect me to use a 'research database' omg those things are such pieces of crap, you can't find anything on them.

I go to a cyber school and It's a little hard for me to concentrate because I'm at home all day. And I hate it because I get so bored so I end up going to the library and spending half the day there. Oh and I have to walk to the library also so that takes up about 24 minutes of my time there and back.              I need to know how I can manage my time more effectively (And please don't tell me to not go to the library. Because I know I have to stop doing that, but what else am I suppose to do when I get bored?) I also need an effective homework schedule to complete all of my homework and turn it in on time.        If anyone needs to know what classes I'm in they are       Algebra Concepts,   Algebra 1,   American History,   American Literature B,   Biology,   Earth Science,   Family Living,   French 1.      And I've been bribed by my mother so many times for me to get my grades up with so many good deals. I just don't know why I've fallen behind again. The current deal is that if I can pass the grade I'm in (which would make me a senior next year, hopefully) I can take a summer course for video game art and design at the art institute. Please help. thanks!
20090223102242AAlnZC9	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	UCAS application, adding a choice, help!?	I have applied to 4 universities to do social work - my personal statement is full of my knowledge of a social worker, and expressing why i want to do that as a career.   However, i have had a complete change of heart, and not knowing exactly what i wanted to do before i applied, at the time social work was the best course for me.   I have found a nursing course that begins in january 2010, and all applications have to go through UCAS. i still have 1 space left to add a choice, but as i cant change my personal statement, the nursing admissions will be confused as to why i am applying for a nursing course when i have written in length about social work...      what do i do? thanks in advance, any answers will really help

20090223135022AA41fcN	Education & Reference;Primary & Secondary Education	Am I dumb or average or what? Maybe it's just my self esteem?	I'm a freshmen and I take standard math (Algebra) and science and english. I take French 2 so I'm ahead on that. A lot of people I know are a year ahead on math and science, maybe in enriched Eng too, like they take Geometry instead of standard algebra. A lot of students so the standard pace instead of enriched. Some students are a little below standard classes and need moderate level classes.       I'm planning on taking standard classes sophomore year, and taking some honors classes junior year, and a couple honors and AP classes senior year.      I have a 3.9 GPA (out of 4.0 scale), but I still feel like people are much smarter than me, or like I'm not up to my full potential just because I'm in a normal pace. Colleges like to look at what classes you took in high school, so that's another reason. I might feel smarter If I know that they look at classes you take in Senior year too.

20081229224324AAV9qXE	Education & Reference;Studying Abroad	?Como estudiar en el extranjero?	Desde hace tiempo busco maneras de estudiar en el extranjero (obviamente con ayuda financiera, sino ya me hubiera ido). Lo curioso que me encuentro aqui en mexico es lo siguiente:   1)Apesar de los muchos anuncios de apoyo, en realidad no los hay.   2)Las pocas instituciones que te ayudan no te dan lo suficiente y te limitan para trabajar.   3)Para los que viven en Mexico, en un nivel de vida ordinario, saben que el nivel de estudios en cuanto idiomas es pesimo, estudiar Ingles es caro y dificil (gracias a Dios ya lo tengo), estudiar otro idioma, jajaja, casi nadie. Lo curioso es que las organizaciones piden un dominio fluido del idioma.   4)Escuelas, me fijo que los egresados son ITESM, UNAM, IBERO, etc. Solo esas o que onda.   Me gustaria informacion, sobre todo de aquellos que hayan estudiado en el extranjero.   P.S. una de las razones por las que me urgue ir es el estudio de idiomas. He oido que algunas becas te mandan antes para estudiar el idioma, hasta el momento no he encontrado nada.   LE VOY A ESTAR ETERNAMENTE AGRADECIDO A QUIEN ME MANDE UNA RESPUESTA EFICIENTE.
