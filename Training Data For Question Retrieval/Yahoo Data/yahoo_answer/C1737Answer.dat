That way you don't have to pay for a plastic red nose on the days leading up to red nose day.    Then get people to sponsor you for not spending red nose day following them around, annoying them, ruining their lives, discovering their secrets and exploiting them... This would be easier if, like me, you went around bullying a large amount of people anyway.    Then stay home on red nose day, put your feet up, nurse your nose, and watch your favourite DVDs/listen to your favourite music/do whatever the heck you want to!    Collect all the money from the countless people you got to sponsor you, and feel good about donating a lot of money for very little effort indeed.|`|26t0dbQ5aa	run down the high st naked|`|AhO0Uoppaa	see how many co-cks you can suck in an hour?|`|b2WGvF18aa	HOw about NOTHING!!!!!!!!!

04c692ac41989c43c38921b6a757ed4eaa	Israel is not a nation of terrorists.  If Hamas were a peaceful nation trying to co-exist and Israel were the terrorists then I would support Hamas in their efforts to defend themselves.    However, we all know (you included) that Hamas are terrorists whose crimes are aimed at murdering every last Jew alive.  Or perhaps you are so self righteous that you don't understand that.    How many hundred times must Israel pull back at the cries of self righteous know it alls just so that Hamas can close back in and murder some more?  Next you are going to claim that Israel does not need to worry about Hamas smuggling weapons into Gaza to murder them with.|`|h1IYS0dbaa	Your question is extremely hypothetical.    Such thing will never happen.|`|i7oHTo9haa	You do realize that Hamas has phosphorous too, and that it is a NATO approved weapon that all ARAB armies have.   Just because civilians were injured with phosphorous does not mean that Israel is responsible for it.     As far as humanitarian buildings, that is the way Hamas and their ilk fight.  It is an URBAN war. In WW2 there were millions that died, nobody fainted at the sight of blood and said "oh let's let Hitler have his way"  People get to defend themselves against an aggression and use what force is necessary to fend off that aggression.    If Hamas cared about the civilians it wouldn't wage battle on Israel, but make their skyscraper to the sky on prime beach front real estate on the Med Sea.  But they don't care about anything.  Look how they fought with Fatah over in Gaza in 2007.  Where is your cry about civilian casualties then when they used Al Quds hospital and a Red Crescent building while firing on a third civiilan building?    n another attack, a Palestinian civilian was wounded when he was inside the house of  Reem Khalil al-Souri, 28, near al-Quds Hospital in Tal al-Hawa neighborhood in the southwest of Gaza City. In her testimony al-Souri stated:  At approximately 15:30 on Wednesday, 13 June 2007, many militants deployed inside the headquarters of the Preventive Security Service, and some of them took position on the second and third roof of the building of Palestine Red Crescent Society opposite to our building, where I live on the first floor. An intense exchange of fire erupted between militants of Fatah movement and those of Hamas. We also heard sounds of explosions. On the following day morning, the fighting escalated and consequently, we were not able to move inside the house. We were 3 families comprised of 14 individuals, including 5 children. We all stayed in the southern part of the house, which was the most secure. Later, gunshots hit the house. We could hear glass of windows being broken and voices of militants. As a result of the gunfire, electricity was cut off. A few hours later, the fightingfurther escalated and we realized that armed clashes were taking place near our building.Militants from Hamas were deployed near our building and neighboring buildings, firingat members of the Preventive Security Forces positioned atop of al-Quds Hospital. At approximately 09:20, Sameer Ibrahim al-Jilda, 48, was wounded by a gunshot to the left leg inside our house. We called a doctor and woman who has some experience in first medical aid, who live in our buildings, and they offered him first medical aid. We called for ambulances, but ambulances were not able to reach the area. We told one of the militants that we needed an ambulance to evacuate the wounded man, but he told us to offer him first medical aid. The situation became more dangerous, and the part of the house in which we were sheltering was no longer safe. The fighting continued until 12:30. It ended with Hamas takeover of the headquarters of the Preventive Security Service. We then evacuated the wounded man in a civilian car to the Arab National Hospital in the east of Gaza City.  -----------  edit to Sophie: The point is dear that people die in a war.  If one side doesn't want their people to die they shouldn't wage the war to begin with.  International law does provide for civilian casualties.|`|laddjTVvaa	Ahem, I believe this was about Hamas, not Hitler. Since when have the Hamas tried to kill every Jew in the world.  It just so happens that the majority of Israelis are Jews.

And it makes sense that we don't have these facilities, how much of a waste of money would it be to hire people to clear the paths and to buy ploughs and to give everyone snow tyres when they probably wouldn't be used for 20 years.    Basically this will always happen unless it becomes a common occurance which it isn't likely to.    As for the fighting in a war analogy, the reason people don't make the effort is because they aren't fighting a war, they work in and office and quite fancy a day off playing in the snow with their kids.  Seeing as it only happens once every few decades i say just enjoy the snow while its here and stop moaning|`|UNw3L5qfaa	I think you're taking things a bit too far here.    The only reason the country came to a standstill is because of the lack of capital equipment to deal with heavy snow such as this. Yes, its a joke as other nations can deal with it, but because they have the problem more often, and therefore it is cost effective to purchase the equipment. Would you be pleased to hear your tax money is being spent on a snow plow that is used once in 20 years?    Be reasonable.

Either fund a snow busting patrol yourself, run it along the same lines as the life boat association where the government doesnt invest a penny so the rest of us dont have to waste our money if its so important to you.

It's just a bit of snow and it was predicted since last week so there is no excuse not to be prepared with snow ploughs and plenty of grit and salt. We never seem to be prepared for anything these days.    That said, while some people used snow as an excuse to skive off work and bludge in their homes, most couldn't make it in to work because the council were too ill-prepared to clear the roads and pavements for them.|`|bxlYleZkaa	Good old Father Jake!|`|Oq5a5hRhaa	It's not that big of a deal.    Where I'm from (Philadelphia), the snow you got isn't that much. But, when I was ten years old, we had 30 inches of snow. Now, in Buffalo, NY, that would be normal, but in Philadelphia it was not.    The state shut down the roads. I mean they literally shut down the roads. If you were caught driving on them you were subject to arrest. My school was closed for a week, and most people didn't go to work for days. Some people were even stranded at their places of employment--I remember reading that some employees of a convenience store were not allowed to leave (because they had to drive home), and they had to survive by eating the candy bars off of the shelves.    It was a total disaster. But, it would have been nothing in Buffalo.    You're not used to accumulating snow. We weren't used to 30 inches of snow. And every time it snows in the southern US, the people and the government react the same way you did. It's understandable.    And it is extremely difficult to drive on unplowed snow. Cars are unable to make it up hills. You can't brake--ever--or you will spin out of control. You need to drive very slowly, to the point where it might be quicker to walk. You need to make sure there is a large area with no traffic around your car, because you will slide, no matter how slow you go. It is a nightmare, and people die in accidents that could have been avoided if they had just stayed home.|`|vHQsz8HHaa	is this the first time your seeing snow in your life?|`|st8xI1Wuaa	You forgot the smoking ban in this Nanny State of ours......thats the biggest joke....no one has batted an eye lid at the loss of personal choice and freedom|`|98JZcrO6aa	yup, parents can sue schools for absolutely anything nowadays.

Lbulud8raa	Such as?    Cremation is considered environmentally unsound by many, and there are belief systems that disagree with it too.    Medical science is fine but many people don't want to do that.    Tower's of silence exist in places like India, where the bodies are consumed by carrion, but these are against western beliefs and senses of decency and they also cause health concerns.    Burial as sea is another form of pollution.

i7oHTo9haa	I don't view them as innocent, all of society is responsible for the monsters they create and aren't immune from it.  Nazi Germany wasn't immune to allied bombs, and millions died.  When Communist Russia had missiles pointed towards America, America wasn't immune to what our world leaders were doing, and the Russians weren't immune to our missiles pointed right back at them.  Cuban missile crisis targeted Floridians for what our President in Washington was standing up for, and the terrorists themselves say NONE of us is innocent they regularly pack on suicide bombs and plunge into malls and restaurants.  So what makes these Palestinians so special that they can wage bombs towards us, but cry they are innocent when we defend ourselves? They are NOT innocent and if anyone thinks they are they are sadly mistaken.    After the Yeshiva Massacre they danced in the street when civilians children were murdered, They also danced in the street when 9/11 towers were destroyed. They are a horrifically violent society, Look at the polls:    84 percent supported the March 6 attack on the Mercaz Harav Yeshiva. -- Khalil Shikaki, Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research  http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/19/world/...    2007 statistics show  52.2 percent of Palestinian population are children age 18 and under and 93 percent have experienced domestic violence (Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics and the Palestinian Center for Public Opinion (PCPO))    And then voting statistics that the Palestinians overwhelmingly supported and voted in Hamas which specifically has an "annihilate the Jew then move onto the West" doctrine. Both men and women voted. 77.69% turned out to vote overall in the Palestinian territories.  One Gaza precinct (Rafah) had the highest turnout 89% while the lowest was the Jerusalem precinct 47.5%.  http://www.elections.ps/template.aspx?id...

Imagine Hitler's troops crying "you killed my civilian" and Allied Forces stopping the War for that we would have never accomplished anything and we'd all be speaking German right now.

They are not innocent.  They are products of there environments: poor, angry and need something or someone to blame. Hitler came to power because of the Aftermath of WWII, which drained Germany of all of its resources (because of reparations and war debts that Britain and France demanded Germany to pay off).  The Arabs and Arab Americans who support Hamas are angry that European and American powers have ruled and made decisions about their lives and "land".|`|zfme8PO1aa	You compare a war between nations with Israel:  occupying territories of other nations,   then encouraging its citizens to appropriate the productive areas of those territories including their water, power and food resources and transforming them into giant concentration camps,   then sealing them off from the outside world and from Israel,   then routinely terrorising them with denial of food, medicines, power and water (learned from US v Iraq), airstrikes and missiles,  then calling them terrorists when a few emulate the Polish Jews under similar circumstances and resist,  then indiscriminately bomb, strafe, and invade.  Attempted obliteration of prison/concentration camps is genocide, and abhorrent to all peaceful people intelligent and informed enough to deduce what is really happening despite US/Israel censorship and propaganda.

Golliwog-   a toy I had as a child  a sticker on the front of a jam jar, which you collected and sent away for one of around 30 different characters  a character in numerous children's books    Her sacking was a physical manifestation of the PC virus.    ps: how did you manage to answer your own question?|`|rP6CHrwgaa	OmG, if they weren't famous, popular who'd give a shite,,,|`|26t0dbQ5aa	that's misreporting. no golliwog can play tennis.|`|AA12121752	So what ?  she mentioned the badges that came with jars of raspberry jam.  They did - big fat hairy deal you PC tossers.|`|3OCx9lsOaa	You don't seem old enough to remember Maggy Thatcher!  In fact she had a pair of balls the size of mellons which is a lot more than can be said for her replacements!  Just look at the Iranian embassy seige!  The sinking of the Belgrano and the Falklands war!  She kicked @ss and she never went to the USA looking like a poodle!  As for her daughter saying gollywog???  Big deal ive said a lot worse things than that and i'm sure most people have!|`|f4fddd96f6c1635b7fc9966339558ba9aa	The history of the name is steeped in our nations historic racism. It was always an odious branding. It has been used by racists for decades. It's somewhat unfortunate that the cuddly little image used on a jar of jam has been hijacked and used by the haters for a long time. There was nothing particularly wrong with the image, just the name.    Carol Thatcher exposed her upbringing with her comment. I'm sure we could all say that words can not offend but if I walked up to Carol and called her a name referring to a female dog, I could probably dress it up in cultural defences and slippery rhetoric to make it sound like she was in the wrong for taking offence.|`|PZZkjST7aa	I think it's right she was sacked, if she made the assumption that her colleagues would not, or should not, be offended by her remark it shows that she was going to be difficult to work with. It was offensive in that she presumably knew the name of the tennis player so did not have to bring in a racist jibe, or any other way of referring to him.  If some people still think that 'golliwog' is not an offensive word the test is whether they would use it openly to a black person.|`|4uB0bbhnaa	with her accent she probably said    ' gorriwog' anyway    She was savcked becasue she wouldn't apologise|`|om9PLGecaa	its just stupid   if you take offence of it then your just felling sorry for yourself a word is a word its not the end of the world is it   if you dont care what people say or think then it dosent matter|`|Ct8UtbnUaa	So I suppose if she'd said Wayne Rooney looks like a Cabbage Patch Doll they'd have made the Director General?|`|UNw3L5qfaa	Is there anything people can say that won't offend someone anymore?    Its all about the money. The person she was talking to just wants to see compensation i.e money for the sake of money.|`|yb4FbFiSaa	It takes people's minds off the strikes anyway.|`|KbhADKrraa	LEFT WING C*NT!!!!!!|`|qqpVZL19aa	Maybe she should call a big black bloke it and see if it is offensive ..    her mom was an obvious lover of black folk and her dad use to have them as slaves in south africa so I don`t understand where her inbuilt racism comes from|`|8bcd238c8b848fb63a058d03732252b7aa	ask Mr Sacks or jonathan Ross|`|AA10718196	Forget "golliwog" she should never have been given a job at the BBC in the first place.    She is thick, ugly and can't speak properly.|`|jTQSSGAbaa	when i was little a golliwog was on a jam jar or a doll to play with...its peoples minds that cause all the trouble i never thought of it anymore than was intended|`|108e0ebeab89e8fb7aca50438b781fefaa	only sacked from the one show not the bbc    maybe  one of the presenters  wanted rid of her and was looking for a way of doing it clever|`|wLGrgBobaa	They still sell them in the shops by me. I never really pay much attention to tell you the truth.|`|a9c55d4c26f4f07d797eea0edd37747aaa	Cant see anything wrong with golliwog or nignog or ****** or paki or sooty.  its just semantics but its useful for minority groups to pretend that they are so insulting that they should be compensated for hurt feelings whenever they hear them|`|9ce331db844e331546e7c9460f0e12b1aa	Why was Carol Thatcher's mother 'hidious?'  Do you mean hideous, as in ugly?  Is that a general insult to older women, or just to women in politics that the Guardian doesn't agree with?   Thanks for the wikipedia link - it shows that some people use such terms out of habit or endearment, not as a racist slur.|`|TadINnYoaa	Mincemeat.|`|KDAAaRanaa	Nothing wrong with it, people call me it all the time.|`|d0c7228277376d06833b965e11cd3291aa	As a child I had a golliwog doll dressed just like the Robertson's jam golly. I have used the expression "you look like a golliwog" to a (WHITE) friend with the intention only of insulting his hair-style. I would imagine this was what Carol Thatcher meant. No doubt this will rumble on for many more hoUrs and days than it should, with the media trotting out people who've been offended/hurt/demeaned by it, but for gods sake why don't we all grow up, stop being so PC. How come people can get so injured by things like this whilst allowing stuff like Gaza, Tibet and Zimbabwe to pass them by. Get real!
8aA31siRaa	Yes, it is weird. Nobody likes Miley Cyrus.|`|PoHpSqwwaa	Miley Cyrus  sucks|`|AkHwZV0yaa	i think the only reason that they make fun of you is because she is on disney channel,and i guess it's lame of people to watch shows on disney channel at the age of 13.but everyone has someone that they look up to for a different reason.look up to whoever you want.maybe just keep it on the down low.|`|f1fd9f1cf1a58e760d7ffd75daa60953aa	i wana date her! and hope to marry her!|`|pCyGLPtpaa	No!  Shes a really good singer, and just because she goofs off doesnt mean she ba, just that shes a normal teen...|`|ITZRv0XGaa	well its ur choice really no one can make fun of you for that. i personally HATE her but no one can choose for you. SO STAND FOR WAT U BELEIVE IN!|`|SwVW0yrAaa	i think everybody loves miley cyrus secretly.  so its all good. (hehe)|`|H4FMzagxaa	She just isn't innocent anymore, she ruined her image.  She is talented and that is something to admire.  But she clearly has personality flaws and I think that is why your classmates tease you.|`|ALvp7YRuaa	no it's not weird....you do what you want to do and if she's your role model then tell them to mine their own. but yah miley is cool. people just mad that she is out there rockin here teenage life when their stuck here doin nothing. well hope that helped.byebye...  og keep your head up high kid.  =DRichyRich|`|Gcvm5Wb4aa	No way. I don't like Miley but You should be able to admire who you want to admire. And if you get made fun of just say "I didn't ask who you liked. This is who I like and I can if I want to." If people see that you don't get afended then they won't bug you about it. Its true! And that's good that you don't admire her for the bad stuff she's done. Just the good. :)|`|mpUsNchQaa	no its is not weird every 1 looks up to someone else and yours just happend to be famouse  just do not wear her clothes and purses and anything else that has her face on it(i think those are weird)|`|0IuWhmWUaa	OMG, looks whats news    http://au.news.yahoo.com/a/-/entertainme...|`|K7uChlM0aa	girl; that's totally awesome.  shes a great role model for teenagers.  you forget what they say.  i think shes awesome too.  people make fun of me but i  just ignore them.     and if you want to be a little   smart with them then   most of them probably like  batman. you know batman dark knight,  so you can say well at least i  dont like fictional characters!:)|`|8BjKKRtPaa	Dont make that bother you. Too bad they don't like her,tell them to get a life. Just don't mention it. It doesnt matter about what they think. don't think that they are gonna be with you for life. When you get older you'll get new friends they'll be more mature and you will too. So who cares? I know a girl called Jill she loves Miley Cyrus too. She has a huge poster of her in her locker. some people made fun of her. She didn't care then they aventually stopped teasing her because she showed them that it didn't hert her even though it maybe did.   Enjoy life don't care,  Suz T.|`|t0mb150gaa	No it is not weird at all that you look up to miley cyrus she is probibly one of the better female role models out there and do not let what other people think affect you. She is a very talented and pretty girl who has worked very hard to get where she is today and her songs teach self esteem and about never giving up so just keep that in mind. She has made some mistakes but everyone does and at least she owned up to them and has taken responsibility for her actions so be proud to have someone like her to look up to.|`|9djvkpzDaa	no, forget aobut them|`|swxiulwtaa	um she's not really talented  and no you shouldn't look up to her|`|k3QFMb4Laa	Im 13 too.  And i hate her.  She isnt a good person to look up to.      SAY NO TO MILEY!|`|xreWOKBYaa	HAHAHAH shes a joke. Find a better (smarter) role model.|`|B2vFQLU0aa	No not at all dont change who u like or look up to b.c of kids its normal  to look up to a celebrity like that !|`|wlgRsZpfaa	yea... miley cyrus is only famous now because of little daddy cyrus. don't keep your hopes up so high, kid. miley will be down in a couple of years. make me your best answer and yell at me ALL you want. (curse too, idc!)|`|W05piyBxaa	no   well depends what about her your looking up|`|7dVtO1gtaa	not really.|`|gAOAdOHraa	Well she is racist.  She made fun of asians by making her eyes slant.  Do you really want the person you look up to to be a racist?|`|xNNFF8YAaa	WELL seeing ur age; you probably havent heard alot of the other stuff..    She wants to be cut from her family so she can have all the control...    ALL of those pics    dissing other celebs    using her dad to get roles & opportunities    got a new car, after her parents gave her a REALLY nice one, then telling everyone that it was bcuz it was " bad for the enviroment " even though the new one is just as bad, if not worse    If you like her, great! but i dont think you should look up to her....    maybe try: Selena Gomez, Hayley Williams, Or just someone else....    She isnt the greatest role model.....|`|oYcWRBY0aa	nope,your cool,im a boy and i think she is very pretty.|`|HunSyQaSaa	at your age? not at all.If it were Brittany I would say so.She is getting her act together.Enjoy the Miley Cyrus craze because next year it will be someone else.Don't listen to others.|`|AdwpUbAuaa	yes it's unless you are a singer|`|wlqjBnNVaa	no. don't let people tell you how you should be. If you like her you like her. If they like someone you don't like you don't like them. Don't feel ashamed. I like her you should see my wall in my room. Posters, every little picture of Miley Cyrus I can find I cut it out and put it on my wall and I'm 14.|`|ML7FRVzIaa	Miley can suck my left tit i could care less about her and her fame!|`|RIbhvrBTaa	yup...|`|zGtELDrnaa	yes|`|4ZOoSO1Eaa	Miley Banana cyrus|`|yDhyuFZeaa	she is a bit sketchy and sorta a slut|`|HVJnQr3Haa	no she a person, that inpires you who cares what people think  You goo girl :D|`|wKcJcHLhaa	o yea!  and i wouldnt be surprised if you end up just like her! (not the famous part)|`|bQKJ4odhaa	well, she is kinda cool. but i don't like her music much. no it's not weird you look up to her. it is not weird at all.|`|AxE4l6HUaa	no tell em to screw off its your thing then its your thing|`|lDO4O2FXaa	well, then u shouldn't tell them that you like her. but i just like her shows she is very talented and i don't think nobody should make fun of her too. i agree|`|7J5nO8mraa	no. shes pretty and a good singer.  i personally dont like her but i can see how you little girls do. you wish u were her, everyone wishes they were someone else|`|ZCgnoZXDaa	No, it's not weird. Girls your age look up to celebrities like Miley. It's natural.|`|a21c0a1fba15ecec329d3a001b9d32ebaa	i personally think she is a spoiled brat and there are many more positive female role models out there but if ur a fan u cant help it|`|5k5P0iOaaa	no miley is cool hannah is dumb! lol|`|CZLpTU8iaa	Trust me, she's the next Britney Spears! Not a good role model!|`|o43uZSDJaa	I don't think so, she may be a little trashy at times, but every high school girl has their moments, hers are just exploited in the media, and she has a huge like empire! If you liked Selena Gomez, you would have a problem. =D|`|Jip9UU0Zaa	no people who say its weird or make fun of you are jerks. you do what you want to. its okay if you do. People who make fun of you are probally saying that because they are following everyone. But secretly they probally like her but dosnt want anyone to know.|`|meKSppblaa	YES!  MILEY CYRUS SUCKS BALLS!!!!!!!!!|`|2b654cf95f00bc7187972ef955e56badaa	Yes. At first she's cool, but now not anymore. She becomes an annoying little loser just wanna get attention. She thought that she's a grow up but actually she's far from it.|`|hqlnUXIraa	No, that's not weird! If you like Miley Cyrus and consider her a role model, awesome, and talented, that's fine. There's nothing wrong with it. Just keep doing what you do and be yourself. Don't change your mind because everyone else doesn't like it or think that it is weird. Keep being you!|`|k5Jiy6ovaa	No your not weird, everyone has their own point of view and if they saw yours they'd like her too so it all depends on who you ask but be yourself and stand up for what you believe in and it doesn't matter as long as you believe in what your saying.|`|Wl2MnHNKaa	yes. if you haven't noticed shes a slut. shes dating a 20 some year old pedophile and put homely girls in her '7 things' to make her ugly face look better.|`|KXwv5cIcaa	Well, I think it is ok. My bro is 12 and he looks up her. Besides, she is just 16, and she is turning 17 this november. That's only a 3 year difference! Therefore, I think it's ok.|`|Ucf8tw7Saa	I'm not going to be rude but, yes sorta. She's really fake and is teaching girls you don't need talent just to be super skinny and she has a 21 year old bf which is soooo wrong. However if you look up to her theres nothing wrong with that it's your opinion so stand up for it! I personaly hate her and if she was on the edge of a building I'd tell her to jump but, that's just me.....|`|uFil7GzOaa	not at all im 13 and i listen to her song 7 things all the time although i havent listened to it lately its only cuz im rapped up in taylor swift music and all that school stuff like sports and hw but yea MILEY CYRUS IS AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and girl u can tel those ppl in ur class to f*** off cuz ill kick their a**es so they better be ready to have the sh*t knocked outa them u no wat im sayin lol.|`|WKKZzKnwaa	In my opinion i think you should look up to anybody who you want.  its your decision, not the stdents in your class.  its not weird   she is a great girl she may have had exposures but obodys perfect.  be inspired from who which ever person you want.|`|Zk9b4zbyaa	You can look up to whomever you wish but did you ever meet her first? I think before you go around acting like someone at least meet them or go to one of her concerts or something. My grandma lives very close to her and I still have not met her so there is really no way to tell what someone is really like unless you meet them.|`|fb3dd3fee54f8b05cc6ac9ae9d500a06aa	yeah u should look up 2 people with real life talents like firefighters and us military members|`|k73cyB0Zaa	look I'm 12 lol but most people are not into Miley Cyrus but wat ever people think you can believe in her if u want Miley is very talented and I think its all right. =}|`|STHy8fdBaa	If you like her, then you like her.  Personally I don't, she's skanky.|`|qc9UBjSNaa	yes you should find someone else to look up to   someone who is worth your attention    http://www.popcrunch.com/miley-cyrus-rac...   i mean come on
VgPG5WMsaa	The whole team!
VgPG5WMsaa	Sounds like it will have a time slot on the News!
XwWQx4Cgaa	its the TV,    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14njUwJUg...|`|avhgLEu8aa	I blame Scotch Mist.|`|glynFK9haa	Oh my gosh!  Your avatar looks just like Palin!|`|0qSpreVyaa	Actually... i think people should take other's emotions into consideration before they speak or act... that's hardly ever done... tha'ts a mistake.|`|RHr9YdQCaa	(I think)They take it to the heart because maybe their just a sensitive person. A lot of people care about what others think of them.|`|15bjtZhzaa	Yes, if there is any money to be made..people seem to try anything.    Your question has really upset me, off to yahoo court :-)|`|t4FBtIsTaa	I think they are all poo heads!|`|kaaP8y2oaa	im broke as hell...but i wouldnt go there.|`|UNw3L5qfaa	Its all about the money.    Every time i see on TV "trip or fall that wasn't your fault?" i think look where you're going.    When i hear "Muslim family suing school for not allowing veil" i think don't go to school then.    And when i hear "Man fired over racist term" i think who decided it was racist?    We're following in the footsteps of America, a suing culture. There is nothing you can say anymore which will not offend someone out there. Your question will offend someone. My answer will offend someone.    But i agree, the whole point is money. People think about how much "compensation" they can get out of anything.    Its an ugly world we live in.
1E7gqGBGaa	It isn't...Who would care? Except the same whiny *** bastards that cry about everything else.  People like to blame celebrities for their failings as parents too.  And in response to the first answer...How does marijuana give you an advantage swimming?|`|htMOl3c4aa	Because he is a role model for younger kids. It's not like he's an actor or celebrity, he's on cereal boxes for christ's sake and that is who kids were looking up to.|`|fcMBMaqgaa	It like Eddie Izzard says, stoners should be given a head start.|`|3MRgEzoiaa	cuz he might have used it to cheat in the olympics and he may be a druggie|`|ff4620d7ef5c56f9405c2f52615552f5aa	Ha ha @ "He used it to enhance his performance". Marijuana does no such thing as far as swimming anyways. I'm sure they do drugs tests for the Olympics, so he wasn't swimming high.    It's really NOT a big deal. Marijuana is an HERB, not a drug. Some of society just makes it a big deal, as if it's soooo bad to enjoy the gifts that God gave us.|`|z28QboW7aa	Because Phelps is a worldwide superstar and the best swimmer in the world. And is supposed to be a role model for swimmers. He should be seen smoking marijuana. By the way after his DWI a few years back he should be more aware of his responsibilities. Hopefully, he will move past this infamous event and learn from and keep breaking records in the pool.|`|ahBKJaVpaa	Because Michael was caught smoking marijuana and it is illegal. An athlete shouldn't be doing that. Like the one poster said, he could loose his endorsements. I am sure there has been money spent on Michael for his positive image. Now he has a tarnish image. He is young and vulnerable.|`|km2rYhTcaa	because he became a sports icon|`|dASDaT4Zaa	This could prevent him from competing in the next Olympics and he will probably loose most of his endorsement deals.|`|MSM66SEnaa	Because he's an American Icon and millions of people (young and old) had their eyes on him, watching his every move. He set a very bad example by making a wrong choice.|`|4tWbC3GPaa	he wont be able to get even bronze next time. he should be  a role model for youngsters.|`|GGAgxzJNaa	Whether he likes it or not, he's expected to be a role model.|`|4810f1ddde8104d49db91aaae4bcd680aa	The people paying him to endorse their stuff hired him for his "All American" clean-boy image.  If they had wanted Dennis Rodman, they would have hired Dennis.      They are not judging him for his actions - it is simple economics.  His picture on Wheaties will no longer sell as many boxes as before the pictures of him with a bong came out.  He isn't worth as much money any more.|`|1xySOaTeaa	Because he is such a great athlete people are surprised that he would do that and damage his health.|`|mHv7nFxEaa	because he's supposed to be a role model for young kids.    i really don't see a problem with it. pot isn't the worst thing you could do.. people are making a big deal out of nothing.|`|AA10815904	Uh, just because.|`|c8yu9dlDaa	1 its illegal 2 he might have used it in the Olympics 2 preform better|`|AA10233376	because smoking or having marijuana is against the law in the united states.     no matter what ones personal opinion is about the drug, phelp's broke the law. as an olympian, gold medalist and professional athlete, he is a role model for children and adults.  in that role he is expected to follow the laws of the land.  as a citizen of the u.s. he is expected to follow our country's laws.    the issue of whether marijuana should be legal or not is a different conversation.|`|DtRXwTHSaa	He is suppossed to be a role model, in perfect health and perfect shape because of his profesion, so it is a big letdown when such a huge idol proves himself to be much less than he is thought of.|`|LF6Ox2k2aa	Penny, Hemlock is a herb too.  Perhaps you should enjoy that "Gift that god gave us"?  PS where do you think crack cocaine comes from?  Yep, its another one of Gods gifts. Just like malaria and HIV.|`|V66nhhs7aa	because what kind of a national hero is stupid enough to let someone take a picture of him smoking pot? it's bad enough that he did it, but obviously he must have let some friend take his pic. like i said...stupid. mark spitz was a real role model.
gYThMID8aa	I don't think her comment was very serious. The uproar is about the fact that she is too arrogantly stubborn to say sorry so who's daughter is she?|`|AS4pWko5aa	carol said it in a private conversation , if the person was offended they should of confronted her about it not gone telling tales     its pc gone mad carol said what many people say in their own homes   a silly thing to say but to sack her is just wrong     ross did far worse in my opinion|`|xZwwb3kVaa	This has got so damn stupid now that it is a crime to open your mouth these days. Has freedom of speech gone out of the window, if so what will they doing next, to curb us.? I could do with finding my own Island to live on as this one  is becoming unbearable to live in. Pathetic is the word, so do not forget all of you keep your mouths shut... I will be listening to you.....and be very careful what you write on here... !! ha ha|`|aEb8Q19Kaa	I think it's completely blown out of proportion. She said one thing, then said it was a joke. She shouldn't have had job offers revoked because of it. I suppose the BBc have to though, otherwise there would be a big hoo-ha calling them racists if they had done nothing about it. It's bloody ridiculous though. I mean Jonathan Ross still got to keep his job! (although I am quite happy he did)|`|ToztjpAsaa	Being white myself, it's probably not for me to say, but I believe the term is genuinely offensive.  I also find Carol Thatcher genuinely offensive.|`|AA12121752	If they sacked Thatcher then Ross should go too - he was far more offensive than that.  Whoever made this public should be sacked also for lack of judgement.  It should only have been an internal matter.  She didn't humiliate anybody on air.  She only mentioned a badge we got with pots of jam.|`|8897ef26cacbd959d0b80f92cb194984aa	It was a joke, and it was funny, because he does look like a golliwog!!    I thought the Ross/Brandgate was in poor taste, but blown way out of proportion, and seeing as it was their production team that put it on the air, even after Saches asked them not to, I don't even think he should have been found culpable.      This Thatchergate now, is even deeper in the well of lunacy.  It wasn't even said on air, poor little porkchop pumpkinhead took offence, awwww, poor baby, his little sensitive virgin ears.  Go home and suck on mamas teet!!|`|40STiGmvaa	Yes the Weld as gorn mad. didn't ya no?|`|ZTc7rE1Haa	I don't feel that I can comment on Carol as I can't find out exactly what was said. I am all for the golliwog toy as it is a totally inoffensive toy which has brought pleasure to generations of children and should still be sold in shops. As you pointed out, it's not meant as an insult. However, it's totally different to refer to a black person as a golliwog, and I can fully understand how it would be deeply insulting. As far as Carol Thatcher is concerned, I have been unable to find out what she said, so I don't know what to think.
b0f0f231555e5da9d455a8890388f3cbaa	It would appear to me that the US Army is trying to overcome a large credibility gap with the legitimately wary parents of possible enlistees.  18 year-olds are considering one of the most important decisions of their lives and most will, or should, talk it over with their parents.    I believe Audrey B is referring to the 60s Vietnam era hippie and protesting college students that opposed that war.  I do remember coming back from 'Nam and hearing them chanting:  "Hey, hey,  What do you say.  How many babies have you killed today?"|`|AP3XqPMCaa	Because a lot of these parents grew up thinking soldiers were "baby killers".|`|AA10811674	Parents are afraid their offspring will get killed, maimed or wind up with PTSD in Iraq, Afghanistan, Iran or North Korea.|`|a6fUSU2Paa	Many parents think that when their offspring join the military, there is a guarantee that their offspring will be killed or taken prisoner, despite that recruits rarely see actual conflict.    The commercials are just to tell them what good the military can do for them.|`|AS4pWko5aa	young people still seek their parents approval     i dont want my boys to be cannon fodder
Q2UDhYgkaa	I would find a person as an example - i.e. maybe a teenager with angst issues who listens to Fallout Boy then start something like -    'Josh is a teenage boy trying to cope with the effects of financial strain on his family. He feels like life is unfair and his iPod is the only thing that helps him forget his far from perfect world. Fallout Boy's angry music help him to express his anger at the world'    I'm a journalist - I'd probably start it something like that.|`|qN8mkITaaa	you could do a story on how peoples' playlists show their personalities
ksOW8Y4Aaa	It's not fully understood. The reasons they purportedly gave don't make sense, since military action is almost completely useless as a means of stopping the kinds of rocket attacks that were taking place.    Partly it was Israeli politics, there's an election coming up and in Israel, the political parties vie with each other to see who can be the most warlike. And they wanted to act before Obama took office, though both of these are about the timing of the attack, not the reasons for the attack.    Best guess is it's part of Israels long standing policy of demoralizing, impoverishing, and ethnic cleansing the Palestinians unfortunate enough to live in Israel's occupied territories. It's also part of their strategy to destroy any possibility of a viable Palestinian State. It's certainly made the Arabs reconsider the Arab Peace Initiative, since it's pretty clear at this time that Israel has zero interest in giving up the occupied territories under any circumstances.    It's also pretty much guaranteed Ahmadinejad's re-election in Iran and pretty much guaranteed their will be reprisal attacks against Israeli interests around the world ... both of which are propaganda gold mines for Israel.    Bottom line is, no one really knows. You will hear a lot of regurgitated propaganda in the answers you get, as if what any government says can be taken a face value.    It is an interesting question, because it's hard to imagine anything good coming out of it for Israel in either the short run or the long run.|`|Klp0Mv6kaa	Honestly,I am a bit tired of this question.Looks like you slept in a cave all your life,then woke up,and ywaning ask the question which has been answered thousandds of times on this board.

I mean they have been smuggling weapons in easily so why not smuggle in food and medical supplies.|`|58e49cee94da926929118606381c20f0aa	The Hamas government in Gaza has not honored the cease fire.  They have been firing rockets into Israel nearly every day during the cease fire.  Israel finally had enough and attacked the areas where they thought the Hamas terrorists had set up bases and were firing rockets from.  Since the Hamas government can not control it's people, Israel decided to take matters into their own hands and attack the people who were firing at them.  The most unfortunate part of all this is that the Hamas terrorists have put all their bases in homes and neighborhoods using the Palestinian people as human shields.  That way after Israel fights back they can say that all these innocent Palestinians were murdered.  Th Hamas government does not even care about it's own people.

61bd799b360ce91a3154d9c71b5ae4deaa	Better that than the banks, but I'm really tired of the schools whining about money.  Since they're a monopoly they go for tax increases first, before they have a look at the budget like any other business or individual.   They threaten to cut things that will get a reaction from the folks, but won't get their federal funds cut.    IMHO, teachers are grossly overpaid for their skills and the work they do.   Come on, 3 months off, a million holidays, and done at 2:30 every day? Please.  And don't whine to me about lesson plans and grading papers.  80% of them haven't changed their lesson plan in a decade, and they push the grading off on the aides.     That said, a few billion of the money we've wasted on the banks and Wall Street would've built some pretty nice facilities and maybe even hired some folks with a clue.  Unless Obama's Secretary of Education was in charge of the money.  He was clueless in Chicago, and I'm sure the trip to Washington hasn't improved him.|`|ff4620d7ef5c56f9405c2f52615552f5aa	Schools often seem to get hit the hardest when it comes to reorganizing a budget. They always have to take cuts! There is a reason behind it all though...not that the public school system was any good to begin with, but the Establishment prefers to keep people dumb and docile, and that's why the school system is so bad, and there's sodium fluoride in the water.    Our schools do need the money, and I even wondered if any small businesses were going to get a piece of that bail-out pie. But it seems that these politicians only care about those whose pockets they are in.|`|BkatcMZbaa	What is going on in your country, everything,every sector needs bailout fund.  Is the country and your community so poor that everywhere & everything to close up some areas or layoff staff.

Friendly speaking, there is such thing in my country.....all are taken care of by Govt or aided fund from Help Societies or own school board fund.    It looks like something is very wrong in management level and control by the Ministry.

I really didn't think about it or care about it until i heard about the bank or some company that used to money to give the executives a raise and/or buy the company a new jet.     People will always be complaining with the decline of education and blame it something other than the real problem. Schools need more funding but the people in charge would rather waste that money. This is one reason why my masters in teaching is going to waste and i am trying to get a retail job.

Finally I would start to cough, and when he got tired he would stop.  <br>  <br>  My wife wants to tickle me, but I know that when I start laughing, then she will keep tickling.  To me it is not a mock attack, and it is not an act of personal closeness.  It is an actual attack, and a cheap way to exploit a personal weakness or vulnerability.

There's no real way to prepare for terrorism because you have no idea when or where they will attack. Or what kind of attack it will be.

They were often alone late-nights in the house, and she states that he was a very pleasant 'young man' during this time.  <br>  <br>  He escaped twice from prison.. Had he been locked up more securely, his FLA murders (some of his most severe) would never have happened.<br>  <br>  Interestingly enough, he also 'helped' Detectives with tips on the "Green River Killings" while still denying his own crimes from death row in Fla.  These tips were chillingly accurate.<br>  <br>  He was executed in 1982 in Florida after a 20-some odd year killing spree that began in the state of Washington, continued into Oregon, Utah, Colorado, and Florida.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Bundy" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Bundy</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://ezinearticles.com/?Ann-Rule-and-Ted-Bundy---Friends-With-a-Serial-Killer&id=1354893" rel="nofollow">http://ezinearticles.com/?Ann-Rule-and-T...</a><br>  <br>  Some other Interesting ones to debate, I agree are the Loeb and Leopold Murders,<br>  <br>  and Charles Manson, the Cult Leader who claims he never himself 'touched' anybody, but instead it was his 'family' or girls that did it.

The peace thru strength doctrine works really really well when they know we mean what we say and we say what we mean.  It makes them responsible for actions that occur within their own countries for harboring and supporting terrorism and terrorists.<br>  <br>  Reagan was the first American President to combat Islamofascist terrorists and peace thru strength doctrine worked really well to hold off advancing Soviet Communism. Everyone thinks this was a Bush/Blair concoction to vehemently defend ourselves but this new found allied hatred against ourselves to backstab each other is actually new. It is brought about by incoming Islamic immigrants that have purposely influenced Western mindsets and turned the West back onto ourselves, rendering us immobile to fight against their incoming Islamic extremists.<br>  <br>  It was Reagan/Thatcher that supported bombing Libya because of their support of terrorism. Qadaffi was totally emasculated then and he still talks like an emasculated leader with a limp today. He had a tough reminder with Iraq and tells the Arabs at the Arab Summit "they will hang us all like they hung Saddam."  They really won't mess with us because we are so strong and some of those Arab leaders actually look up to America to help them with their Iranian threat, they really aren't all that bad.  Some know they have extremist issues and they deal with it and we are actually allied with them  The ones that don't deal with it and harbor terrorist orgs in their countries those are the ones that I am talking about and why we had to go into Iraq and Afghanistan and why that type of campaign is actually successful. Those Arab leaders don't like the terrorist threat anymore than we do but they aren't able to deal with the problem either unless we are all allied together and not backstabbing each other. We have to keep those countries that are favorable to the West stable and not overrun by the other extremists around them.<br>  <br>  Reagan on Terrorism<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo7HkVyJJ5s" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo7HkVyJJ...</a><br>  "I warn that there should be no place on earth where terrorists can rest and train and practice their deadly skills.

It is so deeply inset into their culture the hatred of the West and that Islam is superior and will rule the world it would take decades to educate that out of them if we could even attempt it at all.  Since there are 1.5bil Muslims in 60+ sovereign countries and climbing now, that aspect I don't see as feasible.  The best we can do is to contain the damage that they can do, neutralize countries that pose the greatest threats, and not let it spread to the West or to any country that currently has nukes or any other significant military power, and for the West to just remain strong and united against the threat of terrorism.|`|FfGIZe7jaa	It's simple we need to grow a pair and bomb the piss out of those Arab middle east countries.

You hit the nail on the head, and it's an invisible nail. Nobody has found a solution that works entirely to this date, and I personally doubt there will be one panacea for everything. In my view, every case must be handled based on its individual circumstance. Every terrorist group has its own partisan mission and background. Each one wants its own thing from somebody else and is willing to kill for it. The solution isn't always to bomb them out of their caves. Sometimes it's to negotiate. In all seriousness. But again, sometimes violence is the only thing left- fire with fire. Again, every case is individual, and must be handled differently. If you fix one, you've done a small miracle.<br>  <br>  Ironically, as a side note, it appears at this point that the actions of Al Qaeda did just that, directly causing the demobilization of the Provos... watch and wonder!<br>  <br>  A good question, and one that I unfortunately don't think anybody can completely answer.

80e9b302f1ee300cac6fea79c460458faa	Government and the media goes back so far - if its not the oldest profession, it may be the 2nd oldest.<br>  <br>  Back during the 1700's- early 1800's, Thomas Jefferson - that pillar of democratic society - was caught paying someone to go around the colonies and plant Letters to the Editor in various newspapers to defame his opponents for the upcoming Presidental election.<br>  <br>  During the Civil War, the pillar Abe Lincoln had newspapers shut down if they criticized his presidency, the war, shortages, etc.<br>  <br>  During World War II, all photos and news articles had to be approved by the War Department before they could be published.<br>  <br>  It was said - we didn't lose the war in Vietnam - we lost it on the evening news on tv.  And that may be way, for the Gulf War (1st one), the press was assigned military personnel to stay with them at all time and who had to approve of any news story before it was released.<br>  <br>  From 1992-2002, I workd for a state agency - the Department of Corrections.  One of the largest state agencies in terms of the number of employees and in terms of the number of facilities they operated across the state.  Saw a newspaper article about some alleged abuses of the inmates.  A very interesting article, in that small violations were supported by the reporter, but large "rights" violation were dismissed by the reporter for the smallest of justification.  I was amazed that any "outside reporter" could know our operation so well, that they could manipulate the article in such a way to appear to support the allegations against us while really just stonewalling those allegations.  A few weeks later, the Public Affairs Director for the agency came into our Division and talked with us.  Said his job included reviewing any proposed news article about our operation - and that he would "correct" that article before publication.  If "they" didn't accept our correction of their article, then we would never do business with them again - and they would never be allowed into any of our facilities.  *** Think about that.  In essense we decided what "news" about us would be published.  And the newspaper editors and tv station owners accepted this as the way to do business.  <br>  <br>  Governments have a large fear of the Internet because with it you can have person-to-person reporting / discusssion of the news ands government's actions.  As such, there is no control over what can be said - unless the government monitors all the websites and makes the Internet Service Providers (ISPs) disconnect webpages that are not favorable.  Which is what China does.|`|AA11513843	I just think the government covers up a lot of what they do, you can't really site specific places/sources because the government does it behind our backs, total cover ups.|`|Bh5uWKroaa	Neither of your examples is the result of direct control by the government. Vietnam was exactly the contrary- it was the first war where video cameras really graphically recorded the horrors of war. Iraq, now that's the result of an assumption by the media that people, as you said, get tired of hearing about war. Instead, they like fluffy bunnies and so forth.<br>  <br>  All wars have some weight in this argument, because some things are inevitably censored out of public view. Neither of those is an exception, nor is any other media-covered war.<br>  <br>  World War II is a PRIME example. The army media offices held MASSIVE control over the press, essentially remobilizing massive resources to shift the media to produce propaganda. You know Dr. Seuss? He started drawing as a propaganda artist for one such army office in the war. So, that works. Look around, you never know what you might find.<br>  <br>  As far as philosophical aspects go, remember that whatever side you take, there IS always a valid interest of national security. Things regarding current deployments of troops and national intelligence and so forth are censored out of view, simply because people would die if such information became public.<br>  <br>  Your views are yours alone to make. Whatever you decide on any issue, though, make sure you can back it up with a full explanation and facts. Remember, too, that with philosophical questions, you don't HAVE to take a side. If you can't make up your own mind, then don't get forced! State why each side believes what they do, and say why you can't take a side. However, your paper... not the place of some fogey on the internet to dictate!
Euj25fcXaa	Gopalswamy was not removed.  He will retire this month or next month as chief election commissioner.  Don't find flimsy reasons to substantiate your question.  Generally, in general elections the election commission will appoint independent election observers to see any unlawful acts and to take action there if found.  The concerned states will have state election commissioners and this is the duty of them to see malpractices etc.,  you are asking about naveen chawla.  There are two election commissioners with equal power to chief election commissioner in our country.  Mr Naveen chawla is the election commissioner besides another commisioner.
R1ecMOO8aa	Mr Gopalaswamy is the chief election commissioner.  He is going to retire on superannuation during April, 2009.  Mr Naveen chawla is now as election commissioner.  Mr naveen chawla favouring the congress party is the compalint against him.  so, Mr. Gopalswamy issued memo on charges and recommended the hon president of india to remove him from the election commissioner post.  The president rejected the chief election commisioner's recommendation and instead, she made naveen chawla as chief election commissioner of india after mr Gopalswamy's retirement.  so, mr gopalswamy was not removed, and only parliament have the power to impeach and now parliament also closed due to elections, he is not removed, and he is going to retire soon in april 2009.

IPA: [??h??d]), an Islamic term, is a religious duty of Muslims. In Arabic, Jihad means "strive" or "struggle". Jihad appears frequently in the Qur'an and common usage as the idiomatic expression "striving in the way of Allah (al-jihad fi sabil Allah)".[1][2] A person engaged in jihad is called a mujahid, the plural is mujahideen.<br>  <br>  A minority among the Sunni scholars sometimes refer to this duty as the sixth pillar of Islam, though it occupies no such official status.[3] In Twelver Shi'a Islam, however, Jihad is one of the 11 Practices of the Religion.<br>  <br>  According to scholar John Esposito, Jihad requires Muslims to "struggle in the way of God" or "to struggle to improve one's self and/or society."[3][4] Jihad is directed against Satan's inducements, aspects of one's own self, or against a visible enemy.[1][5] The four major categories of jihad that are recognized are Jihad against one's own self (Jihad al-Nafs), Jihad of the tongue (Jihad al-lisan), Jihad of the hand (Jihad al-yad), and Jihad of the sword (Jihad as-sayf).[5] Islamic jurisprudence focuses on regulating the conditions and practice of Jihad as-sayf, the only form of warfare permissible under Islamic law, and thus the term Jihad is usually used in fiqh manuals in reference to military combat.[6][5]<br>  <br>  |`|AA11835638	Jihad means holy war.
