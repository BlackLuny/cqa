If you love them so much you need to live in Mississippi from spring time to summer.  Only one thing though, this is the beginning of our tornado season, so when you listen for your thunderstorms to come along and enjoy the smells of "downpours", just listen for the sirens to go off telling you to take shelter.....then you will have the full effect of a spring/summer thunderstorm.  Nothing like listening to the booms and also knowing there have been 4 sightings in your county already but thank goodness not all dropped down...have a good one,

xmvPyLYUaa	To find the probability of an event, you take the number of possible outcomes in which the event happens ("successful" outcomes) and divide by the total possible number of outcomes. <br>  <br>  For example, imagine there are 2 red balls, 3 blue balls, and a green ball in a bag and you pull out one of the balls.<br>  Say you want the probability that you pull out a red ball.  There are two red balls in the bag, so there are two successful outcomes (or two outcomes that give you a red ball).  Since there are six balls in the bag, there are six total outcomes possible.<br>  Divide the successful outcomes by the total outcomes and reduce:<br>  2/6 = 1/3<br>  <br>  For your dice problems, start by making a list of all the possible outcomes when you roll both dice.  This is easier to understand if you imagine that your dice are two different colors, like white and red.  So if you roll a 2 and a 3, that could mean either the white is 2 and the red is 3 OR the red is 2 and the white is 3.  As you list the pairs below, imagine the first number is the white die and the second number is the red.<br>  <br>  1-1, 1-2, 1-3, 1-4, 1-5, 1-6,<br>  2-1, 2-2, 2-3, 2-4, 2-5, 2-6,<br>  3-1, 3-2, 3-3, 3-4, 3-5, 3-6,<br>  4-1, 4-2, 4-3, 4-4, 4-5, 4-6,<br>  5-1, 5-2, 5-3, 5-4, 5-5, 5-6,<br>  6-1, 6-2, 6-3, 6-4, 6-5, 6-6<br>  <br>  There are 36 pairs above, so the total number of possible outcomes is 36.<br>  <br>  For part a, find the number of outcomes that give you a sum of 8:<br>  2-6, 3-5, 4-4, 5-3, and 6-2 all give you a sum of 8.  Notice that they are arranged in a diagonal on the chart above.  For the probability, you take the number of outcomes that give an 8 and divide by the total number of outcomes.

e28KtQTqaa	First thing is that you have to be careful with √(cos2 θ).  This is only equal to cos θ because of the effective range of the values of x.  But this is a minor technical point.<br>  <br>  You're correct up to this point:<br>  <br>  ∫ sin^3 θ dθ<br>  <br>  You now need to compute this integral.<br>  <br>  Another answerer gave the answer that involves a trick.  If you can think of the trick, more power to you, but something that may surprise you is that there's a way of solving many types of integral (including this one) completely systematically, in a way that doesn't involve any great flashes of insight.<br>  <br>  There's usually more algebra involved, but it works in a huge number of cases, and makes a lot of the tools of integral calculus that you're probably aware of (e.g. integration by parts, most substitutions) almost unnecessary.<br>  <br>  The plan of attack is as follows:<br>  <br>  1. Find out what the derivative of the type of function that you're interested in looks like.<br>  2. From that, work out what the "reverse" of the derivative operation should look like.<br>  3. Now that you have a general idea of what the integral should look like, write down the most general form that it could take.<br>  4. Take the derivative of both sides, and solve the resulting equation.<br>  <br>  Let me work through an example to show you what I mean, then we'll tackle your integral.<br>  <br>  Consider this problem:<br>  <br>  ∫ x2 e^x dx<br>  <br>  You'd probably solve this using integration by parts, and it would be fairly straightforward.  However, I'm going to use the above plan of attack.<br>  <br>  Consider a general term of the form x^k e^x.  What does its derivative look like?  This is a simple derivative; it's just:<br>  <br>  x^k e^x + k x^(k-1) e^x. = (x^k + k x^(k-1)) e^x<br>  <br>  The actual expression on the right-hand side isn't important.  The important thing to see is what happens qualitatively.  In this case, if you have a polynomial p(x) of degree n, then the derivative of p(x) e^x (w.r.t. x) is q(x) e^x where q(x) also has degree n.<br>  <br>  Because the degree of the polynomial part doesn't change when you take the derivative, it stands to reason that it won't change if you integrate, either.  That is, the integral of x2 e^x should simply be a quadratic polynomial in x multiplied by e^x.  That's what the integral should look like; that is its "most general form".<br>  <br>  So we construct a general quadratic polynomial in x, throwing in some unknowns since we don't know what the coefficients are:<br>  <br>  ∫ x2 e^x dx = (α2 x2 + α1 x + α0) e^x + C<br>  <br>  where α2, α1, α0 and C are some constants.  (Don't forget the C.)<br>  <br>  To prove that this is true, and determine what the constants are, we take the derivative of both sides with respect to x:<br>  <br>  x2 e^x<br>  = (2α2 x + α1) e^x + (α2 x2 + α1 x + α0) e^x<br>  = [α2 x2 + (2α2+α1)x + (α1+α0)] e^x<br>  <br>  Matching up coefficients on both sides gives:<br>  <br>  α2 = 1<br>  2α2 + α1 = 0<br>  α1 + α0 = 0<br>  <br>  which is a simple linear system which has the solution:<br>  <br>  α2 = 1<br>  α1 = -2<br>  α0 = 2<br>  <br>  Therefore:<br>  <br>  ∫ x2 e^x dx = (x2 - 2x + 2) e^x + C<br>  <br>  And we have the answer, with no integration by parts needed at all.<br>  <br>  You implicitly already use the idea in some simple integrals.  For example, the derivative of a polynomial of degree n is a polynomial of degree (n-1).  Because the degree lowers by one, it stands to reason, that if you take the integral of a polynomial, the degree would be raised by 1.<br>  <br>  OK, now let's tackle your integral.  Consider this function:<br>  <br>  f(θ) = sin^m θ cos^n θ<br>  <br>  Where m and n are some integers.  What does the derivative look like?  Well, it's this:<br>  <br>  f'(θ) = m sin^(m-1) θ cos^(n+1) θ - n sin^(m+1) θ cos^(n-1) θ<br>  <br>  If you stare at this for a moment, you can see that the derivative of sin^m θ cos^n θ is a bunch of terms of the form α sin^p θ cos^q θ where p+q = m+n.  In other words, when you take the derivative of sin^m θ cos^n θ, the combined degree m+n doesn't change.<br>  <br>  So it seems reasonable to assume that this is also true when you integrate: you'll get a bunch of terms such that the combined degree doesn't change.  In other words:<br>  <br>  ∫ sin^3 θ dθ = α sin^3 θ + β sin^2 θ cos θ + γ sin θ cos^2 θ + δ cos^3 θ + C<br>  <br>  for some constants α, β, γ and δ.  And C, of course, is an arbitrary constant.<br>  <br>  To find out what those constants are, we'll differentiate both sides:<br>  <br>  sin^3 θ<br>  = α (3 sin^2 θ cos θ) + β (2 sin θ cos^2 θ - sin^3 θ) + γ (cos^3 θ - 2 sin^2 θ cos θ) + δ (-3 cos^2 θ sin θ)<br>  =  -β sin^3 θ + (3α - 2 γ) sin^2 θ cos θ + (2β - 3δ) sin θ cos^2 θ + γ cos^3 θ<br>  <br>  Matching up coefficients gives:<br>  <br>  -β = 1<br>  3α - 2γ = 0<br>  2β - 3δ = 0<br>  γ = 0<br>  <br>  Which is, again, a linear system of equations with the unique solution:<br>  <br>  α = 0<br>  β = -1<br>  γ = 0<br>  δ = -2/3<br>  <br>  In other words:<br>  <br>  ∫ sin^3 θ dθ = -sin^2 θ cos θ -2/3 cos^3 θ + C<br>  <br>  You will then, of course, need to substitute back to get things in terms of x.<br>  <br>  Note that this technique is self-correcting in the sense that if you guessed the form of the integral incorrectly, you'll end up with a linear system which has no solution. So at least you'll never get a wrong answer, assuming you do all your algebra correctly.<br>  <br>  Now just for fun, I'm going to do trick with the original function to see if we can compute the integral without using a substitution. The algebra is a little hairy, so I used an automatic derivative calculator, which is in the first link.<br>  <br>  Consider the following function, for k≥1:<br>  <br>  f(x) = x^k / √(1-x2)<br>  <br>  The derivative is:<br>  <br>  f'(x) = k x^(k-1) / √(1-x2) + x^(k+1) / (1-x2) √(1-x2)<br>  <br>  If you were to perform the division x^(k+1) / (1-x2), you will end up with a polynomial of degree k-1 plus a remainder. Hence, the derivative of f is of the form:<br>  <br>  f'(x) = p(x) / √(1-x2) + β / (1-x2)^(3/2)<br>  <br>  for some polynomial p if degree k-1 and some constant β. In other words, the degree of the polynomial in the numerator is reduced by one. It follows that were we to integrate f, we'd likely have a polynomial in the numerator that has a degree of k+1.<br>  <br>  However, we also need to consider the case where k=0. In that case, we have a standard integral:<br>  <br>  ∫ dx/√(1-x2) = arcsin x<br>  <br>  (modulo an additive constant). So when guessing the form of the integral, we simply add that as another term.<br>  <br>  In other words, we expect the integral to have this form:<br>  <br>  ∫ 3x^3 / √(1-x2) dx<br>  = (α4 x^4 + α3 x^3 + α2 x2 + α1 x + α0) / √(1-x2) + β arcsin x + C<br>  <br>  We take the derivative of both sides:<br>  <br>  3x^3 / √(1-x2)<br>  = [(-3α4) x^5 + (-2α3) x^4 + (4α4 - α2)x^3 + (3α3)x^2 + (2α2+α0)x + α1] / (1-x2)^(3/2) + β / √(1-x2)<br>  <br>  Multiplying both sides by (1-x2)^(3/2):<br>  <br>  3x^3 (1-x2)<br>  = (-3α4) x^5 + (-2α3) x^4 + (4α4 - α2)x^3 + (3α3)x^2 + (2α2+α0)x + α1 + β(1-x2)<br>  <br>  That is:<br>  <br>  (-3)x^5 + 3x^3<br>  = (-3α4) x^5 + (-2α3) x^4 + (4α4 - α2)x^3 + (3α3 - β)x^2 + (2α2+α0)x + (α1 + β)<br>  <br>  Matching up coefficients gives the linear system:<br>  <br>  -3α4 = -3<br>  -2α3 = 0<br>  4α4 - α2 = 3<br>  3α3 - β = 0<br>  2α2 + α0 = 1<br>  α1 + β = 0<br>  <br>  which has the unique solution:<br>  <br>  α4 = 1<br>  α3 = 0<br>  α2 = 1<br>  α1 = 0<br>  α0 = -2<br>  β = 0<br>  <br>  And so:<br>  <br>  ∫ 3x^3 / √(1-x2) dx<br>  = (x^4+ x^2 - 2)/√(1-x2) + C<br>  = (x2 - 1)(x2 + 2)/√(1-x2) + C<br>  = -√(1-x2)(x2 + 2) + C<br>  <br>  Which is the given answer, with no substitutions required.|`|3h1D6Jkcaa	You are indeed correct so far.

Otherwise, you've wasted a lot of time as you could have just taken ∫(3x3dx) · ∫ [dx / √(1-x2)]...<br>  <br>  Anyway, the trick to ∫sin3θdθ is to re-write it as ∫sinθ(1-cos2θ)dθ. This gives you<br>  ∫sinθdθ - ∫sinθcos2θdθ,<br>  the latter of which is integrable using the substitution t=cosθ.<br>  <br>  I think you can handle it from here!<br>  <br>  §

Then subtract that average from each point value to get the sinusoidal part.  Estimate the values of T0 where there are zero crossings (use linear interpolation).  Find the differences between these times and average them to get a value Tp.  That value is the half-period.  The full period is 2*Tp, and that means<br>  <br>  2*Tp/P = 2*π,  so the value of P is Tp/π and the equation becomes<br>  <br>  Ts = A + B*sin(π*Tm/Tp + C)<br>  <br>  Where there is a zero crossing T0, then π*T0/Tp + C = 0, use this to find the value of C.

X8LNbaKQaa	As long as the growth does not alter the general proportions, while the length grows by a multiple, say of X, the surface area grows by a multiple of X^2 (X raised to the power 2), and the internal volume grows at a multiple of X^3.  As a specific example, if X is two (the length of the cell doubles), the cell surface increases by a factor of 2^2=4 times, while the internal volume grows by a factor of 2^3=8 times.  So the volume increases a lot faster than the surface area, limiting how much stuff can be exchanged across that surface to supply all that extra volume.  So, at some size increase, the cell will either starve, suffocate, or drown in its own waste.<br>  <br>  -- <br>  Regards,<br>  <br>  John Popelish

17d2136cb28b3dcd96bfa98507022f5eaa	The Moon is a sphere which travels once around the Earth every 29 days. As it does so, it is illuminated from varying angles by the Sun. At New Moon, the Moon is between the Earth and Sun, so that the side of the Moon facing towards us receives no direct sunlight, and is only lit by dim sunlight reflected from the Earth. As it moves around the Earth, the side we can see gradually becomes more illuminated by direct sunlight.<br>  <br>  After a week, the Moon is 90° away from the Sun in the sky and is half illuminated, what we call First Quarter because it is about a quarter of the way around the Earth. <br>  <br>  A week after this, the Moon is 180° away from the Sun, so that Sun, Earth and Moon form a line. The Moon is fully illuminated by the Sun, so this is called Full Moon. The Earth's shadow points towards the Moon at this time, but usually the Moon passes above or below the shadow and no eclipse occurs.<br>  <br>  A week later the Moon has moved another quarter of the way around the Earth, to the Third Quarter position. The Sun's light is now shining on the other half of the visible face of the Moon.<br>  <br>  Finally, a week later, the Moon is back to its New Moon starting position. Usually it passes above or below the Sun, but occasionally it passes right in front of the Sun, and we get an eclipse of the Sun.<br>  <br>  The Moon's phases are NOT caused by the shadow of the Earth falling on the Moon. In fact the shadow of the Earth only falls on the Moon twice a year when there is a lunar eclipse.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.starrynight.com/sntimes/2009/feb/wwwgfx_cur/Moon_Phases_Full.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.starrynight.com/sntimes/2009/...</a>|`|yp0GQz5Laa	the waxing a waning of the moon is caused by the fact that the sun shines on the moon, but we see that reflection of light at an angle, so part of the shining moon is obscured by the moon itself.  As the earth and moon rotate, the part of the moon we see becomes more and more illuminated.  Then, it becomes full, and then becomes less and less illuminated, until we can hardly see the illuminated section of the moon at all.  <br>  The other thing - if the moon is really seen as a perfect circle, it's full.  If it doesn't look huge, it is because it is high up in the sky, and this causes an illusion which makes the moon appear smaller than if it's on the horizon.

For other uses of "Mathematics" or "Math", see Mathematics (disambiguation) and Math (disambiguation).<br>   <br>  Euclid, Greek mathematician, 3rd century BC, as imagined by Raphael in this detail from The School of Athens.[1]Mathematics is the study of quantity, structure, space, change, and related topics of pattern and form. Mathematicians seek out patterns whether found in numbers, space, natural science, computers, imaginary abstractions, or elsewhere.[2][3] Mathematicians formulate new conjectures and establish their truth by rigorous deduction from appropriately chosen axioms and definitions.[4] The mathematician Benjamin Peirce called mathematics "the science that draws necessary conclusions".[5] However, Albert Einstein stated that "as far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain; and as far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality."[6]<br>  <br>  Through the use of abstraction and logical reasoning, mathematics evolved from counting, calculation, measurement, and the systematic study of the shapes and motions of physical objects. Knowledge and use of basic mathematics have always been an inherent and integral part of individual and group life. Refinements of the basic ideas are visible in mathematical texts originating in the ancient Egyptian, Mesopotamian, Indian, Chinese, Greek and Islamic worlds. Rigorous arguments first appeared in Greek mathematics, most notably in Euclid's Elements. The development continued in fitful bursts until the Renaissance period of the 16th century, when mathematical innovations interacted with new scientific discoveries, leading to an acceleration in research that continues to the present day.[7]<br>  <br>  Today, mathematics is used throughout the world as an essential tool in many fields, including natural science, engineering, medicine, and the social sciences such as economics and psychology. Applied mathematics, the branch of mathematics concerned with application of mathematical knowledge to other fields, inspires and makes use of new mathematical discoveries and sometimes leads to the development of entirely new disciplines. Mathematicians also engage in pure mathematics, or mathematics for its own sake, without having any application in mind, although practical applications for what began as pure mathematics are often discovered later.[8]|`|3tSNQAkTaa	time               |     rate      | salary.......   x+ y = overtime pay<br>  40 hours         |    $12       | x<br>  49 - 40 hours   |   $12*1.5  | y<br>  Let x = regular pay <br>  Let y = pay for week in which she works 49 hours                      <br>  12*(40) =x..........................==> 480=x  ....................................<br>  (12*1.5 )(49-40)= y ==> 18(9) => 162 = y  Therefore, x + y = overtime pay or 480 + 162 = 642|`|IFCF5mtgaa	40x+9(12y)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  let x represent the regular payment and ley y represent the amount paid over 40 hours|`|7NtMbVCJaa	(40hrs x $12) + (9hrs x 1.5 x 12)|`|PtjZMj1Saa	(12 x 40) + (9 x 12 x 1.5)|`|3y2MDWbRaa	Pay = (regular hours) x $12 + (OT hours) x $12 x 1.5<br>  = $12 [ (regular hours) + (OT hours) x 1.5 ]<br>  = $12 [ 40 + (49-40) (1.5) ]<br>  = $12 [ 40 + 13.5 ]<br>  = $12 (53.5)<br>  = $642<br>  <br>  Answer: see above|`|iIjsFLtjaa	= $12.00(40 + 1.5[9])<br>  = $12.00(40 + 13.5)<br>  = $12.00(53.5)<br>  = $642.00<br>  <br>  Answer: $642.00|`|qlFEO5xNaa	let us say Pay per hour  = $P for Y = 40 hr/week<br>   z = total hour worked  in a week<br>  <br>  hence  we have <br>  <br>  ( Z-Y) X 1.5 P + Px40 = total pay<br>  <br>  check by putting the values<br>  <br>  9x1.5x12+ 12x40 =  $642|`|vHTwS3E3aa	12 * 40 = 480 dollars for a regular week<br>  <br>  49 - 40 = 9 extra hours<br>  <br>  9 * 12 * 1.5 = 9 * 18 = 162 dollars<br>  <br>  480 + 162 = 642 dollars for a 49 hours week|`|DrwY7dJCaa	49 = 40 + 9<br>  pay = 40(12) + 9(12)(1.5)<br>  pay =  $642|`|8qctM0B4aa	y=(12)(40)+ (x)(H)<br>  <br>  where x is her over time pay and H is the number of hours she worked over 40

SIhxrxD3aa	Veterinarians go to school for 6-8 years.<br>  <br>  Each vet school has about 2 years worth of courses that you need to take to apply to their school.  These are called pre-vet courses and they will be a lot of chemistry, biology and physics courses.  <br>  <br>  Although, you can get into vet school with only these 2 years worth of courses most people can't get accepted without a bachelor's degree.  This degree can be in anything you want, but most people earn animal science or biology degrees because they overlap with the pre-vet courses very well.  However, you are just as likely to get into vet school with a business degree, english degree, or art degree.<br>  <br>  Before going to vet school you will also need to work for a veterinarian.  Even if you aren't being paid, experience is very important to vet schools.  They want to make sure that you understand the profession you'll be entering.  A recommendation from a vet is required.<br>  <br>  There are only 28 vet schools in the United states and it's very hard to get accepted.  Your grades, test scores and experiences all have to be excellent.  The average science GPA of admitted applicants is around a 3.5.  <br>  <br>  Once in vet school, it is 4 years long.

IUmAflSqaa	The condition lim (a_n) = 0 as n-> ∞ is necessary, so the only thing we can get rid of is monotonicity.<br>  <br>  1. Let f(x) = sin^2(πx/2)/x^2.  Then f(x) ≥ 0 for all x.  For odd n, a_n = f(n) = 1/n^2, and for even n, a_n = f(n) = 0.  The sequence is not monotone decreasing, but this series is nonnegative and bounded above by the p-series with p = 2, so it converges.<br>  <br>  2. Um, let f(x) = 1/x^2 when x is not an even integer, f(x) = 0 when x is an even integer.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure why you distinguish between continuity and discontinuity of f(x)...  If a_n is a sequence of integers, it's easy to construct a continuous function f(x) so that f(n) = a_n: define f(x) to be piecewise linear, with f(x) = a_n(n+1-x)+a_(n+1)(x-n) for n ≤ x ≤ n+1.  And it's similarly easy to construct a discontinuous function f(x) so that f(n) = a_n: define f(x) to be some wacky discontinuous function for nonintegral x, and let f(n) = a_n.<br>  <br>  -----------------<br>  <br>  You're right, my example converges for reasons other than the fact it's alternating.  If you want something that's not absolutely convergent, consider:<br>  <br>  a(n) = 1/n, n odd<br>  a(n) = 1/(n+2), n even<br>  <br>  Then the terms are not monotonically decreasing.  However, when n is odd, the partial sums are equal to:<br>  <br>  -1-1/3+1/4-1/5+...-1/n+1/(n+1)<br>  <br>  And when n is even, the partial sums are equal to:<br>  <br>  -1-1/3+1/4-1/5+...-1/(n-1)+1/n+1/(n+2)<br>  <br>  So if S(n) are the partial sums of this series and T(n) are the partial sums of the alternating harmonic series, we have:<br>  <br>  S(n) = T(n+1)-1/2, n odd<br>  S(n) = T(n+2)-1/2+1/(n+2), n even<br>  <br>  Taking the limit as n goes to infinity, we see that this converges.<br>  <br>  This is certainly not absolutely convergent, since it contains all terms of the harmonic series except 1/2.

91bhiXTVaa	C-Natural Selection acts on the phenotype.<br>  <br>  The phenotype are the genes that are expressed.  A brown critter has a brown phenotype.  A tan thing has a tan phenotype.  <br>  <br>  In mixed dominance, say a shade of lighter brown but darker than tan (mocha) , the phenotype may be expressed (but it still may not be strong enough to act on natural selection).  In a dominant - recessive system, only the two phenotypes are expressed.<br>  <br>  Imagine this as a desert of tan sand.  Tan things are naturally camaflauged, other things are not.  Only the tan condition helps the bearer escape predation.  That's the example of how phenotype matters.  A recessive gene that is suppressed by the dominant gene adds no selective value to the individual that carries it.  <br>  <br>  But a gene that allows partial expression might, depending on the circumstance.

xmvPyLYUaa	Pi is the ratio of the circumference to the diameter of a circle; approximately equal to 3.14159265358979323846...<br>  (wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn)<br>  <br>  To understand what this means, try the following:<br>  <br>  Find a few circular objects around your house, like a cake pan, lid to the peanut butter jar, an oreo cookie, etc.  Get a tape measure.<br>  <br>  For each object, measure the circumference (the distance around the circle) and then measure the diameter (the distance across).  Finally, divide the circumference by the diameter.  If you measure very carefully and divide correctly, then you should come up with a number close to 3.14 every time.  (Expect some of them to be a little off.  It's very hard to get an exact measure of the diameter of a circle without knowing precisely where the center of the circle is.)  Therefore, if you know the diameter of a circle, you can estimate the circumference of that circle by taking the diameter times 3.14.  <br>  <br>  So why call it pi?  Why not just say 3.14?<br>  <br>  It turns out that the exact ratio of the circumference to the diameter is an irrational number, which means the numbers after the decimal keep going and going and going without repeating.  In reality, every time we use 3.14 for pi, our answer will be just a little bit off because we had to round.  For small numbers, the difference is barely noticeable, but for larger numbers, it can make a big difference unless you use more decimal places in pi (like 3.14159).  Instead of trying to figure out how many decimal places we need for each problem, we just use the symbol for pi.  <br>  <br>  Using the pi symbol in calculations is very much like working with a variable.  The key difference is that variables can represent a range of numbers.  Pi will always be that number that is close to 3.14.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps with your report.|`|luYtFLSUaa	Pi is just a ratio: the circumference of a circle divided by its diameter - it's not a whole number or a definite fraction nor is it a repeating decimal.

We do know that pi has been known for over 4000 years.<br>  <br>  In 2000 BC the Babylonians used 3 1/4 as an approximation to pi, and the Egyptians used 256/81.<br>  <br>  It is very likely that people of thousands of years ago observed that circles of different sizes were similar. If you measure the circumference of any circle and divide it by the diameter of the same circle, you will get the number pi.<br>  <br>  We think that they simply measured large circles. That is why in ancient times the most frequently approximations of pi have been 3, or 22/7 or 13/4.<br>  <br>  None of these of course are exactly pi. Pi cannot be written exactly except by naming it. When we write the name pi, we are specifying exactly the value of pi. When we write 3.14 we are specifying only an approximation to pi.<br>  <br>  Here is a nice chronology of the computation of Pi<br>  20th century BC Egyptian Rhind Mathematical Papyrus (16/9)2 = 3.160493...<br>  19th century BC Babylonians 25/8 = 3.125<br>  12th century BC Chinese 3<br>  9th century BC Indian Shatapatha Brahmana 339/108=3.138888<br>  434 BC Anaxagoras attempted to square the circle with compass and straightedge 223/71 < π < 22/7<br>  c. 250 BC Archimedes 211875/67441 = 3.14163...<br>  20 BC Vitruvius 25/8 = 3.125<br>  130 Chang Hong √10 = 3.162277...<br>  150 Ptolemy 377/120 = 3.141666...<br>  250 Wang Fan 142/45 = 3.155555...<br>  263 Liu Hui 3.141014<br>  480 Zu Chongzhi 3.1415926 < π < 3.1415927<br>  499 Aryabhata 62832/20000 = 3.1416<br>  640 Brahmagupta √10 = 3.162277...<br>  800 Al Khwarizmi 3.1416<br>  1150 Bhaskara 3.14156<br>  1220 Fibonacci 3.141818<br>  <br>  after this it was more a approximation of pi to a large number of decimal places the latest being: 2002 Yasumasa Kanada & team, HITACHI SR8000/MPP (64 nodes), 600 hours 1,241,100,000,000 dps<br>  <br>  The symbol "π" was first introduced in 1706 by William Jones when he published A New Introduction to Mathematics, although the same symbol had been used earlier to indicate the circumference of a circle. The notation became standard after it was adopted by Leonhard Euler. In either case, 'π' is the first letter of περιφ?ρεια (periphereia, the Greek word for periphery) or περ?μετρον (perimetron), meaning 'measure around' in Greek.<br>  <br>  It may be interesting to know that Archimedes (250 BC) had a theretical calculation of pi, while many of his predessors and even those after him based the estimation on measurements. He proceeded by calculating the perimeters of polygons to which circles of known radii are circumscribed and inscribed. This way, he obtained the upper and lower bounds of the value of pi.<br>  <br>  No one seems to know how Zu Chongzhi (480 AD) obtained his miraculous ratio of 355/113 (easy to remember because the ratio is made up of the number sequence 113355), which gives 7.5 digits of accuracy using 6 digits! Anyway, his was real close.<br>  <br>  Pi is a very old number. We know that the Egyptians and the Babylonians knew about the existence of the constant ratio pi, although they didn't know its value nearly as well as we do today. They had figured out that it was a little bigger than 3; the Babylonians had an approximation of 3 1/8 (3.125), and the Egyptians had a somewhat worse approximation of 4*(8/9)^2 (about 3.160484), which is slightly less accurate and much harder to work with.

B8IPlF8Baa	Both of the terms inside the parentheses are perfect cubes.  That's the key point.<br>  <br>  And c^3+d^3 factors in a well-known pattern for any c and d.<br>  <br>  You need to memorize that pattern, and more generally for c^n+d^n for any odd n.  You'll be way ahead when you do.<br>  <br>  Even more important is the pattern that c^2-d^2 = (c-d)(c+d) and, as a consequence, c^2k-d^2k = (c^k-d^k)*(c^k+d^k), which can then be factored further if k>1.  But that's not used in this particular problem.

A much simpler way of doing it involves resolving the velocities of the carts into components that are towards/away from the pulley and lateral to the pulley.<br>  <br>  Let a triangle P'A'Q' represent the components of the velocity of cart A. P'A'Q' will be similar to triangle PAQ.<br>  <br>  Let a triangle P"B"Q" represent the components of the velocity of cart B. P"B"Q" will be similar to triangle PBQ.<br>  <br>  The away-from-pulley component of the velocity of cart A = A'Q'<br>  <br>  The towards-pulley component of the velocity of cart B = B"Q"<br>  <br>  A'Q' = B"Q"<br>  <br>  PQ = 12. When AQ = 5, AP = sqrt(12^2 + 5^2) = sqrt(169) = 13<br>  <br>  A'Q' = A'P'(AQ/AP)<br>  <br>  = 2(5/13) = 10/13<br>  <br>  Then B"Q" = 10/13 and we require B"P".<br>  <br>  The rope is 39 feet long so PB = 39 - AP = 39 - 13 = 26<br>  <br>  So QB = sqrt (26^2 - 12^2) = sqrt(532) = 2 sqrt 133<br>  <br>  B"P" = B"Q"(PB/QB)<br>  <br>  = (10/13)[26/(2 sqrt 133)]<br>  <br>  = 10/sqrt 133<br>  <br>  When cart A is 5 ft from Q, cart B is moving towards Q at <br>  <br>  (10/sqrt 133) ft/sec = approx. 0.867 ft/sec

koniJEZaaa	A. 13%<br>  Obvious.<br>  <br>  B. 45%*22% + 42%*25% + 13%*83% = 31%<br>  The probability one voted in favor is the same as the probability one is either a democrat, republican, or independent and voted in favor. Hence, sum the probability of each of the groups voting in favor. Without loss of generality, 45%*22% is the probability that the voter is democrat and in favor. The following two terms follow the same pattern. <br>  <br>  C. 13%*83% / (45%*22% + 42%*25% + 13%*83%) = 35%<br>  The question is asking, if one is in favor what is the likeliness one is independent. Thus you find the portion of those in favor that are independent (part/whole). Hence the denominator is the same as the solution for B, the total population that voted in favor. The numerator is the population of independents in favor. <br>  <br>  D. (42%*75% + 13%*17%) / (45%*78% +42%*75% + 13%*17%) = 49%<br>  Similar to part C, but with the complements of portions. The denominator is the complement of those who voted in favor, hence those who were not in favor. Without loss of generality, this is achieved for the republicans by taking 42%*(100%-25%) = 42%*75%. For the numerator, sum the portions of the complement that are not a democrat, hence the republican and independent portions.

ZTcVcmtPaa	1.  Equilateral triangles are always similar because every single angle will be 60 degrees.  For something to be similar they don't have to be the same size.  Rectangles are not always similar because they can have different ratio sizes for their sides.  Trapezoids don't have to have the same ratio sizes for their sides and they can have different slopes on their sides(angles in the corners).  Parallelograms aren't always similar because the angles can be different.  <br>  <br>  2.  The answer is 39.  Here is an image of how to solve it:<br>  <a href="http://img21.imageshack.us/img21/678/geomath.png" rel="nofollow">http://img21.imageshack.us/img21/678/geo...</a><br>  <br>  3.

With all the other shapes...the diagonals are dependent on each other.  They both change uniformly the same way.  <br>  <br>  4.  Isosceles.  All the sides on a rhombus are exactly the same...so by obvious definitions the halves of each side are the same length.  So if you connect two halves with a line between the two.  Those 2 sides will be the same.  Here is an image to demonstrate that:  <br>  <a href="http://img128.imageshack.us/img128/5605/rhombussides.png" rel="nofollow">http://img128.imageshack.us/img128/5605/...</a>|`|qkuMPSczaa	1. (c) this is because in an equalateral triangle, the sides are always going to be the same. Also, all equalteral triangle have angle measures of 60 degrees which keeps all equalateral triangles in the same ratio. Same ratio means they're similar.<br>  <br>  2. (a) First, you need to find the perimeter of the first triangle. It is 30. Then you need to see how you can get from 30 to 90. You need to multiply by 3. Then, since the first triangle's longest side is 13, you multiply that by 3 and get 39.<br>  <br>  3. (d) just b looking at one you can tell but if you really wnt to know it's because rhombuses can have slanted sides.<br>  <br>  4.(b) the midpoints automatically make 2 sides congruent and isocceles triangles have at least two congruent sides.<br>  <br>  oh yeah the guy above me is wrong about question 3.

JUmfm168aa	Hello,<br>  <br>  For 4, you have Ox (?) and Oy (?) to consider.<br>  <br>  Along Ox, P has no action, as it is perpendicular.<br>  Q has action multiplied by cos(q), similarly R has action multiplied by cos(r). Since they are opposite, I'll take rightwards to be positive.<br>  <br>  (?) : Qcos(q) - Rcos(r) = F[?].<br>  <br>  Along Oy, all forces act. Taking upwards as positive, you have:<br>  P is entirely negative. Q and R have positive action multiplied by sine.<br>  <br>  (?) : Rsin(r) + Qsin(q) - P = F[?].<br>  <br>  So:<br>  (?) : Qcos(q) - Rcos(r) = F[?].<br>  (?) : Rsin(r) + Qsin(q) - P = F[?].<br>  <br>  You should just substitute numbers in at this point.<br>  This is a general form and will work for (a), (b), and (c).<br>  <br>  For (a):<br>  (?) : 4cos(20?) - 3cos(40?) = F[?].<br>  (?) : 3sin(20?) + 4sin(40?) - 5 = F[?].<br>  <br>  Thus:<br>  F[?] = 1.46063715... N.<br>  F[?] = -1.40278913... N.<br>  <br>  So F points rightwards and downwards.<br>  Making a triangle, hypotenuse F, gives:<br>  F[?]2 + F[?]2 = F2.<br>  So: F2 = 4.10127824...<br>  Thus: F = 2.02516128... N.<br>  <br>  And: θ = arctan(| F[?] / F[?] |).<br>  So: θ = arctan( 0.960395350... ).<br>  Thus: θ = 43.8426463... ?.<br>  <br>  For 5, you do a similar thing, only that you consider the line of action of Q.<br>  <br>  You may find it easier to imagine rotating the diagram either q? clockwise, so Q is Ox, or r? anticlockwise, so Q is Oy.<br>  <br>  The equations are formed in the same manner:<br>  Q obviously acts along Q alone.<br>  Since the angle between Q and R is always 90?, R has no action along the line of Q.<br>  P, however, is (90 + q)? from Q, so does act, downwards.<br>  Taking NEwards to be positive:<br>  <br>  (/) : Q - Psin(q) = F[/].<br>  <br>  R only acts perpendicular to Q, as prediscussed.<br>  P has action along this line, but this time, component cos(q), and acts opposing R.<br>  Taking SEwards as positive:<br>  <br>  (\) : Pcos(q) - R = F[\].<br>  <br>  So you have general equations:<br>  (/) : Q - Psin(q) = F[/].<br>  (\) : Pcos(q) - R = F[\].<br>  <br>  This, again, will work for each set. Just stick in the numbers.<br>  <br>  For (a) :<br>  (/) : 3 - 2sin(20?) = F[/].<br>  (\) : 2cos(20?) - 4 = F[\].<br>  <br>  So:<br>  F[/] = 2.31595971... N.<br>  F[\] = -2.12061475... N.<br>  <br>  Thus F points between NW and NE.<br>  Again, making a triangle, hypotenuse F, yields:<br>  F[/]2 + F[\]2 = F2.<br>  So: F2 = 9.86067634...<br>  Thus: F = 3.14017138... N.<br>  <br>  And: θ = arctan(| F[\] / F[/] |).<br>  So: θ = arctan( 0.915652697... ).<br>  Thus: θ = 42.4788618... ?.|`|AA10875218	HINT: split them into their horizontal and vertical components.|`|nAq3EMf9aa	do your own work!!! figure it out yourself!|`|eayIpjouaa	Be sure to set calculator to degrees/radians as necessary.<br>  <br>  The 2nd problem is very similar to the first -- the difference is the reference location at the end of the problem.<br>  <br>  To find the components of each vector P, Q, and R use cos to find the X component and sin to find the Y component.<br>  <br>  Q is 4 N at 20 degrees which translates into the following equations:<br>  <br>  cos(20)=x/4  ==> cos = adjacent side / hypotenuse<br>  x= 3.76 N at 0 degrees (along pos x axis)<br>  sin (20) = y/4 ==> sin = opposite side / hypotenuse<br>  y= 1.37 N at 90 degrees(along pos y axis)<br>  <br>  R is 3 N at 40 degrees. (**I find it easiest to work with the angles measured to the nearest horizontal axis. Reason is then cos is always x, sin is always y)<br>  <br>  Cos(40)=x / 3  ==> x = 2.30 at 180 degrees (along neg x axis) Therefore this is a neg x value.<br>  <br>  Since P is along the negative y axis there are no calculations that need to be made. The<br>  <br>  P results in the following values x = 0 and y = -5.<br>  <br>  Next add all the x values together with their positive and negative signs<br>  <br>  and do the same with the y values. <br>  <br>  This results in a total value for x = 1.46 and y = -1.66.<br>  <br>  Drawing these dimensions will help us find the resultant vector in the appropriate quadrant. 1.46N along the positive x axis and from the tip of that vector a -1.66 N in the negative Y direction. So the tip of the second vector is at the point (1.46, -1.66) . The resultant vector is from the origin to this last point. <br>  <br>  To find the strength of the vector, use Pythagoras Theorem, sin, or cos. The magnitude is 2.21 newtons.<br>  <br>  Then use the inverse tangent (-1.66, 1.46) remember tan=(opp side/adj side) or (y/x) ** see note above. This results in an angle of -48.67 deg.<br>  <br>  Now we can come back and finish the answer, because a vector consists of 2 parts an angle and a magnitude. The magnitude is what we found first using Pythagoras Theorem  2.21 Newtons. The angle is what we found last -48.67 deg.<br>  <br>  Your teacher may/not allow a negative angle which means that your answer may have to be written like this 2.21 Newtons at 312.33 degrees (360-48.67).<br>  <br>  Again the only difference that I noticed between this problem and the next is the angle between the resultant and the identified vector. This problem wanted the angle between the resultant and the 0x (positive x axis according to the problem).

e28KtQTqaa	I don't know about "technicians" specifically, but trigonometry turns up a lot in anything that involves computers and geometry.

451075cc0b28ffa413b31fd0b3fd84c0aa	The two terms are often used interchangeably.<br>  IF you want to be picky, dissociation requires that two ions (at least) are produced (anion and cation) (or at least two separate charge centers). whereas ionization requires the loss or gain of an electron by one (or more) species.  They are NOT quite the same thing. But I'm not very confident that most chemists are that careful about their useage. Take NaCl (+ H2O) -> Na(+)aq. + Cl(-)aq.  The salt is dissciated into Na(+) cation and Cl(-) anion.  While if I accelerate electrons into a crystal of NaCl, I can still ionize the Cl without dissociation.  Similarly with x-rays, I can ionize the Na without dissociation.  I think we can try to put too fine a point on the difference, but I'd say (after thinking about it as I type this) that if the ions are not separated then its not dissociation.  The "seapration" involves (usually) a polarizable media to shield the + & - charges from one another to allow a stable situation.  In astronomy, this isn't the case, so the terms would have to be used carefully as we move from discipline to discipline.  Context is always important.  I do not know how astro-chemists use these terms.

BhumxInEaa	You don't include the diagram so I can't be sure my understanding is correct. Still, it seems that the answer can be derived from energy considerations:<br>  <br>  At point 1, the roller coaster has a certain potential energy and a certain kinetic energy, call the P1 and K1.<br>  <br>  To get to point 2, the roller coaster generates a certain amount of heat H in dealing with friction, and ends up with potential energy P2 and kinetic energy K2. Since energy is neither created nor destroyed:<br>  <br>  P1 + K1 = H + P2 + K2<br>  <br>  Rearranging this we get:<br>  <br>  K2 - K1 = P1 - P2 - H<br>  <br>  Let M be the mass of the roller coaster, V its velocity, and A its altitude. Then:<br>  <br>  P = MgA<br>  K = (1/2) M V^2<br>  <br>  where g is the local gravitational constant - approximately 9.8 m/s^2 at the Earth's surface.<br>  <br>  The equation for H is:<br>  work = force x distance<br>  <br>  You are given that the force is (1/4)Mg and that the distance is 40 m. Note that this means that every term contains M and so the Ms can all be cancelled leaving:<br>  <br>  V2^2 - V1^2 = gA1 - gA2 - (1/4)g(40 meters)<br>  <br>  You are given the altitudes A1 and A2 and V1, so you can compute V2^2 and then V2|`|Sm67owEFaa	you must know the weight of the roller coaster

V8jIAEmBaa	Hydraulic motors and pumps typically about 80% efficient. With both a pump and motor, gets to about 65% or so. Unlikely to beat your mechanical setup.<br>  <br>  You need help from a brilliant mechanical engineer. Hiope you know one!<br>  <br>  Best solution is to use direct drive with a high speed water wheel, and a slow speed generator. I assume you are unwilling or unable to do so.<br>  <br>  Next choice is to go with a custom designed drive chain. [Note that drive chain is the mechanical connection; it does not imply that a link chain is used]. Each stage looses more power, so fewest feasible number is desireable. 4:1 is typical max, but for a low powered application, possible to go higher. So, let's target two stages. Possible to use large gears (like a flywheel and starter pinion, but this requires tight tolerances. A chain or timing belt driven system is probably best. You can use a tensioner/idler to give compliance, allowing loose tolerances.<br>  <br>  Consider a bicycle. A human can do about 1 HP, so drive chain rating is probably about this. Front sprocket is perhaps 10" diameter, at 60 to 120 RPM's. Rear sprockets go down to about 2 or 3 inch diameter. To get 100:1 step up, perhaps 40"  to 60" sprocket and 3" or so driven sprocket. Large sprocket should be attached to waterwheel axle, use same bearings.<br>  <br>  You could use a single additional shaft with the small drive sprocket and a larger sprocket, perhaps the 10" or so from the front of a ten-speed bike. I'm not fond of chain; better to use timing belts like some of the motorcycles now. You need to consider where to buy or how to make the gears economically though.<br>  <br>  This type of system should be able to transmit over 95% of the energy.<br>  <br>  There are also low friction transmissions, such as elliptical drives. Probably pretty costly.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  You are correct that hydraulic pistons are fairly efficient. The main losses are seal friction, with some minor pressure drops in the hydraulic circuit. Pumps though, have lots of parts and seals, and sources of friction.<br>  <br>  Commercial gearboxes tend to have low efficency. I'm not sure why, except that low cost, compact size, and manufacturability are design goals, rather than efficiency. I still think a custom design with super efficiency is the way to go.<br>  <br>  Rather than use a gear the same size as the waterwheel, why not use one small enough to stay out of the water? I'm not a big fan of chains, but a toothed belt should be able to work.<br>  <br>  To answer your questions, start sizing a system by selecting the design (max) pressure. Often 3000 psi, but both higher and lower pressures are available.<br>  <br>  Next, look at the pump. Power is the through variable times the across variable. For electricity, P = E * I. For hydraulic pump,  Input Power = torque * angular velocity. A.V. is RPM * 2pi radians/rev * min/60 sec. The time conversion is optional.<br>  Output pressure is Q * P = flowrate * pressure. The difference between input and output power is loss.<br>  <br>  You will find a very large pump is needed to absorb 1 HP at 12 RPM's. It will be hard to find, as pumps are normally designed for electric motor speeds, like 1800 RPM's.<br>  <br>  Now, find a motor for the pressure and output RPM's you need. The flowrates will automatically match those for the pump, since the pressure and output speed are fixed.<br>  <br>  Datasheets on the pump and motor should indicate losses. I think you will be hard pressed to find a suitable pump at a reasonable price. High torque components are generally rare.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

klpNrhhAaa	We have no manufacturing plants in space, so just about every single thing that we have ever manufactured was done under about 1 gravity of acceleration.  Ergo, nothing we have made has needed to be made under micro-gravity conditions.<br>  <br>  I believe that there have been experiments on space shuttle flights to try to grow crystals, perhaps including crystals of medicines.  The idea is that crystals would form more evenly and with fewer contaminants in micro-gravity, which would lead to better medicines.  I am unaware of any results of these experiments, however, and am not sure how much benefit would be obtained by making drugs in free-fall.|`|XuUMXQ8Naa	None at the moment, the technology is too basic and the labs are too small.<br>  If there is a permanant base on the moon this will change.<br>  At the moment the experiments are indicating the potential which can be achieved in micro gravity.  <br>  Obviously publicity generates money so NASA is always keen to promote this.<br>  For example, <br>  Critical Phase Transitions. During the space flight experiment, in the absence of these gravity-induced pressure effects, a greater than ten-fold increase in resolution was achieved could  become 10,000 times better-defined than the best current Earth-based measurement.<br>  Also, the crystal growth experiments are very interesting with almost half producing larger crystals and about 1/5 producing new crystal structures.<br>  I think tests have been made with insulin up there, but if there had been a major breakthrough we would all know about it!

F32uPjAraa	The richter scale is the measurement of intensity, and the seismograph is the device that is used to graph the intensity of the quake.|`|AA12139405	Richter scale is giving you the amount of energy released during earthquakes. Mr Char less Richter found a no val way to determine the energy released during earthquakes by using seismograph. The arrival time of S wave minus P wave multiplied by the speed difference will give you the distance of epicenter. The maximum amplitude recorded in seismograph and distance are the two parameters required to calculate the Richter scale. Each Richter scale will release 31.7 times more  energy. But the shaking will be increased by ten fold only.The shaking will get reduced by inverse square of distanceThese all are not connected with intensity at all. According the Richter scale magnitude and the distance from epicenter the intensity may differ from place to place for same earthquakes. To know the intensity you have to use only Mercalli scale that needs no instrument.It depends upon only what people felt and the amount of destruction at that place.It may differ place to place for same earthquakes.|`|32bf6cc091942a6c4cc7b3f575927ebcaa	Earthquakes are measured by the Seismograph.  The Richter scale is how they rate the strength as shown on the seismograph.|`|2b72b9528798e570987fa62222e76e27aa	Well both but they are not really comparable.<br>  <br>  A seismograph is an instrument that measures the amount of shaking at whatever place it is.  By itself it can't tell much about the strength of an earthquake because it's measurements are affected by its distance from the epicenter.  The farther away the earthquake, the weaker the measurement.<br>  <br>  The Richter scale is a system for estimating the strength of an earthquake based on several different factors.  One way this is done is to compare the measurements of several different seismographs which are located a different points around the earth.  By noting the time that the signal reaches each instrument and the apparent strength of each signal geologists can locate the epicenter and then calculate the strength of the earthquake based size of each signal and the distance to each seismograph.<br>  <br>  So in a way the seismograph is like the yardstick and the Richter scale is like the units the yardstick is calibrated in such as inches.<br>  <br>  The Richter magnitude of an earthquake is also sometimes estimated by inspecting the aftereffects.  This is important in determining the strength of an earthquake that happened before seismographs were invented.|`|2181567251632c4e5445096bb9761f26aa	Seismographs are the devices that measure earthquakes (like a ruler is the device to measure distance).<br>  The Richter scale is the measurement scale used for earthquakes (like the meter is the measurement scale of distance).|`|aa9fa110a20e70922d00a7a8b77dd863aa	seismographs are the machines that measure earthquakes<br>  <br>  the richter scale isn't a actual thing.. just an idea.. like 'rate me on a scale to 1-10' kinda thing|`|ek1193Qiaa	in science last year it said in the book they were measured on teh richter scale but i have heard of the seismorgraph too so i think it may be both<br>  <br>  yea they both measure an earthquake<br>  <br>  A seismograph is the device that scientists use to measure earthquakes. The goal of a seismograph is to accurately record the motion of the ground during a quake.

The more 9's you put in the 0.9 repeating, the closer it gets to 1.0.  (If it went on forever, it would reach 1.0.)<br>  <br>  There are some fun things you can do with repeating 9's.  Like 0.13 repeating is 13/99, 0.578 repeating is 578/999, and so on.  0.03434 with only the 34 repeating is 34/990, and 0.00456456 with the 456 repeating is 456/99900.  The number of nines in the denominator matches the number of numerals in the repeating unit, and the number of zeros in the denominator matches the number of initial zeros in the decimal.<br>  <br>  You can even convert numbers like 0.254444... to fractions by splitting them into two parts, then adding.  This one is 25/100 (the terminating part) + 4/900 (the repeating part).  Now, multiply the first fraction by 9/9 to get 225/900, and add the two fractions together to get 229/900.

FY4cCjsOaa	Leaving yourself some decent margins, you've got about 7.5 x 10 inches.<br>  <br>  Take the largest dimension you've got, and divide it by 10. That gives you a scale factor, to one inch of your paper.<br>  <br>  But before you use it, check whether the opposite dimension would come out too wide, by dividing its measure by your one-inch factor. If that's greater than about 7.5, you should divide that dimension by 7.5 instead to get a workable factor.<br>  <br>  Example: a plot for a 124ft x 100ft space.<br>  <br>  The largest dimension is 124 ft. Dividing by 10 gives 12.4 ft per inch. Make it 12.5 for easier figuring.<br>  <br>  But the width of 100 ft would take 8 inches that way, and that's a bit cramped. So scale it down a bit further: 100 /7.5 is about 13 1/3 ft per inch.<br>  <br>  In all cases, if the computed scale is inconvenient to work with, because of the spacing and sizing of elements to be plotted, always feel free to reduce the scale some more. 15 ft per inch might be easier to work with.

A3RU9L1Raa	trying 2 disentangle stuff here..OK early in the formation of universe say 1B yrs after BB the universe would be denser..galaxies would form with much more massive stars.<br>  These stars would have much higher core temps than our present sun. The p-p fusion interaction has a mean lifetime of about 10^9yrs at 15,000,000K in our sun. This is bcos the coulomb repusion of the protons is about 1.44Mev (E=kq^2/r) and the boltzmann energy/temp of the protons is only about 1/122 of that..so q-tunnelling is slooooowww!<br>  These early stars (12B yrs ago) used up their hydrogen/proton cores much faster, underwent grav collapse and became supernovae. I presume it's this radiation which has been detected as red-shifted gamma radiation due to the supernova events which by now will have a wavelength of about 1000nm or so due to the 50000x expansion* of the universe since that time.<br>  the early universe only became transparent to photons (ie radiated light when it cooled down to about 13.6eV (ion energy of electron in H-atom). The cosmic background radiation has energy equiv to about 2K now=0.000173eV a factor of 80000 expansion..and these proto galaxies were formed after the transparency phase..|`|2181567251632c4e5445096bb9761f26aa	It does make sense if you stop to think about it.<br>  <br>  Light travels at the speed of light (about 300,000 meters per second, not billions of meters per second).<br>  <br>  To come up with a convenient yardstick for astronomical distances, astronomers use the light year (the distance light travels in one year).<br>  That not only tells you how far something is, but how long light takes to travel that distance.<br>  <br>  It wasn't 1200 billion light years to that galaxy (that makes NO sense). It was 12 billion light years, which means the light that we see right now actually left that object 12 billion years ago.<br>  It doesn't matter if the Earth was here at that time or not.<br>  <br>  To calculate the distance to objects that far away they use a number of things - if light years confuses you, redshift will confuse you even more.|`|zQiwHJV6aa	Actually, we don't yet know the shape of the universe.<br>  <br>  Also, light years are a unit of distance, not time.<br>  <br>  I don't think we have ever detected anything 1,200,000,000,000 light years away.|`|Tiph3lQcaa	Ben -<br>  <br>  Actually, it makes a lot of sense. Before you get too loud and critical, you should probably get a better understanding of what you are criticizing. I can respond to at least a few of your concerns:<br>  <br>  1. We have observed lots of galaxies that were there long before the Earth existed. We can determine their distance by using the Doppler effect (red shift of light spectra) combined with a reasonable and conservative estimate of the Hubble Constant. If you do not understand these methods, then you may want to at least try to figure them out before you discount them.<br>  <br>  2. Light from those objects has no problem reaching the Earth. Have you seen the Hubble Deep Field pictures? <a href="http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap040309.html" rel="nofollow">http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap04030...</a> <br>  <br>  Virtually all of these objects are observed as they existed - in their frames of reference - over 5 billion years ago - before the Earth existed. Since gamma ray bursts create a lot more light and energy than what can be see here, it would be easy to see such an event. They are probably occurring all the time. We just have to be looking in the right region of what appears to be totally empty space.<br>  <br>  3. The curvature of spacetime has been a subject of some debate since Einstein discussed it almost a century ago. The question is really whether that curvature is open, closed, or flat. I personally believe that the jury is still out on the subject, but there is plenty of information that is available so that you can at least understand the discussion.<br>  <br>  Please bear with me here. I cannot possibly explain all of the work being accomplished in cosmology over the past 100 years or so within this forum. You have to look for yourself. Then you can at least ask questions about stuff that you have some understanding about. Also, you will improve your entire outlook and attitude regarding things like science and human knowledge. This would not be a bad thing.|`|hk5f8yxVaa	Actually it's not confusing at all. The light waves just keep travelling in this direction and that's how they reach earth. It was an explosion remember! It has loads of thrust behind it. <br>  <br>  As for how they calculate it, they know the colour that certain gases produce in the life-cycles of things and can therefore work out all sorts of things. Plus, they know that all waves travel at 3.75 x ten to the eight m/s, and how far away it is (using telescopes etc.), so they can work everything out from that info.<br>  <br>  See? Easy as pie.|`|3443ca8928f42fd8cfd8b8d2964936d4aa	Hi. A true scientist questions everything, decides on an experiment that will support (or not) her theory, does the experiment or measurement, and draws a conclusion. Distances in space are estimated based on the experiments of others, whether you can grasp their concepts or not. The inability to grasp does not make anyone "right".|`|8QKwz7W7aa	They use Physics equation and common sense. By observing the relative magnitude (brightness) of an object they can conlude more things such as mass, distance, steroscopic property, materials, etc. <br>  <br>  Put the resulting conclusion with the fact that light travels for about 300 million m/s, they can conclude much more things.

Regardless of that, I will attempt to respond to your question...<br>  <br>  To date, the fartherest things we have observed with optical telescopes have been 13 Billion Light Years from the Sun (and Earth). Using Radio Telescopes we have been able to detect objects in deep space out to distances of 40 Billion Light Years in all directions.<br>  <br>  Your discussion of something at a distance of 1200 Billion Light Years is much farther than any distance I have ever seen quoted in Astronomy News articles or publications, and I believe that it is in error.<br>  <br>  When a star collapses it releases a monstrous flash of light in the explosion. This flash of light is filled with super intense gamma and x rays which shine out into the Universe and travel unimpeded until they strike something, no matter how far away it is. <br>  <br>  Just because a person has a wider educational background and more technical experience than you do, is no reason to call them names, or refer to them as "an egg head." Maybe if you spent 4 years, 8 years, or 16 years studying outer space, and the objects within it, you would learn how to make the complex calculations required to determine those special distances, etc.<br>  <br>  I highly recommend that you visit these sites before you decide that certain things are impossible or nonsensical...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.space.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.space.com</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://exoplanets.org" rel="nofollow">http://exoplanets.org</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/index.php" rel="nofollow">http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/index.p...</a><br>  <br>  when you have at least studied all those sites have to offer in the way of astronomical information, then possibly you will understand more about deep space and the make-up of the Universe.<br>  <br>  Regards,<br>  Zah|`|t8BGljYWaa	OMG science! Sooooo impossible.<br>  <br>  But seriously, folks. Curiosity -- just like yours -- about the explanation behind celestial events has motivated the brightest people throughout human history -- from Ptolemy to Stephen Hawking -- to try and figure out what exactly was going on.<br>  <br>  Since the change to modern scientific methodology a few hundred years ago, knowledge and technology have rapidly progressed. Along the way, ideas were filtered through a rigorous process of evaluation designed to weed out bad concepts and follow the good ones. And while this process is by human nature imperfect -- witness the scientific community following several dead end paths -- the logic behind the process itself remains sound.<br>  <br>  Don't question the knowledge that lead to this conclusion about gamma ray bursts unless you're ready to question the fact that your computer works and you're GPS system functions -- all of these are built on the same 20th century leaps in understanding.<br>  <br>  This (the date and formation of the GRB) might not be right, but the scientific process driving this event's explanation is fundamentally sound. A healthy skepticism is warranted, but unless you can propose an alternate and more correct definition, you should focus primarily on understanding why the scientific community is saying what it is saying before questioning it.|`|YOqbGO2Maa	I guess that's why they go to college for so many years, and get paid the big bucks.<br>  <br>  And by the way, any light that is reaching the Earth now can't be any older than 13.65 billion years.  Not 1200 billion.|`|1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	12.2 billion years old, not 1200 billion.  Since I work with the group wrote the paper, I can explain it to you.  The radiation reached Earth because when the star exploded, it outshone the entire galaxy it was in - these are the biggest explosions in the universe.  So even after the light had traveled 12.2 billion light years, there was still enough of it left for us to see (and detect with space satellites).  We know it was that far away because we took pictures of the burst in different filters, which represent different wavelength bands.  At certain distances in the universe (confirmed using spectra of doppler-shifted lines) there's a drop-out of light due to absorption by hydrogen clouds.  That gives us a good estimate of the distance to these 'bursts'.  That's how we figured out how far away it was.  You can read the paper for more information, it's on the Science website.

OivFRTQpaa	The previous answer is incorrect.  The reason that animal cells are more likely to burst than plant cells in those conditions is that they do not have cell walls.  The rigidity of the cell wall prevents plant cells from bursting.|`|AA12240091	Because animal cells are less dense with water molecules so the water molecules go to the animal cell where as the plant cell is already dense with water molecules so the water doesn't need to even out.

lGixx6idaa	Osmosis: the water goes from HIGH concentration -> a LOW concentration.  Since the person drank a lot of water, the water would be going from the HIGH (outside the red blood cells) to the LOW (INside the red blood cells).  This is a hypotonic solution (the opposite is a hyPERtonic solution).  A way to remember the word "hypOtonic" is to think of the cell as forming an "O" because the water is moving into the cell. <br>  So basically, the cells would burst due to CYTOLYSIS because the water is moving into the cells since it is a hypotonic solution.|`|CYtMRC4eaa	Because drinking large quantities of water will dilute your blood, making it hypotonic to the erythrocytes.

GASTNilgaa	It's very difficult to evaluate "by hand"--- in fact, it might be provably impossible to write an antiderivative of that function in "elementary terms" (ie, in terms of compositions, sums, products, and quotients of the functions one meets in a precalculus class).  If I had to calculate with that thing I would probably make use of power series.<br>  <br>  Things get much easier if you are asked a slightly different question, however.  Call that mess f(x).  If someone asked me for the integral from -5 to 5 of f(x) dx, I would answer 0.  In fact,<br>  <br>  the integral from -a to a of f(x) dx = 0 for any a whatsoever.<br>  <br>  I can prove this without ever calculating an antiderivative of f(x).  The reason definite integrals of this sort are easier to take is that the function f(x) is odd:<br>  <br>  f(-x) = -f(x).<br>  <br>  (When you replace x with -x, x^10 and x^8 remain the same, and sin(-x) = -sin x, so a single minus sign pops out).  <br>  <br>  From a graphical point of view, this tells me that any "area under the graph" of f(x) on some interval [0,a] is balanced out by "negative area" under the graph of f(x) on [-a, 0].  (Think of odd functions such as sin x or x, if that isn't clear.)  <br>  <br>  If you don't like thinking geometrically, you can prove what I said earlier.  The key is the change of variable formula in integrals.<br>  <br>  Let's consider<br>  <br>  the integral from 0 to a of f(x) dx.<br>  <br>  making the substitution u = -x in the integral and using the fact that as x goes from 0 to a, u goes from 0 to -a, and the fact that du = - dx, we get that this integral is equal to<br>  <br>  = -the integral from 0 to -a of f(x) du.<br>  Since I have a minus sign out front, I can swap the bounds:<br>  = the integral from -a to 0 of f(x) du.<br>  Since u = -x, x = -u:<br>  = the integral from -a to 0 of f(-u) du.<br>  Since f is odd, f(-u) = -f(u) for all u:<br>  = - the integral from -a to 0 of f(u) du.<br>  Since u is a "dummy variable" of integration:<br>  = - the integral from -a to 0 of f(x) dx.<br>  <br>  This shows me that the integral from 0 to a of f(x) dx and the integral from -a to 0 of f(x) dx have to add together to get 0.  They cancel out.<br>  <br>  Maybe this is of some use to you.

92f97d29e3d55f3219cc25dfabd347c7aa	Voltage is potential energy per charge.  Potential energy is always measured as a difference between two points.<br>  <br>  The electric field is minus the gradient of the potential.  So electric field lines point in the direction of decreasing potential.  So they are necessarily perpendicular to the direction of constant potential.<br>  <br>  The field is uniform between the plates.  It's obviously zero far away from the plates.  So it falls off near the edges.

Km8hU4lgaa	First off, remember that when two straight lines intersect, adjacent angles will add up to 180 degrees.  This will come in handy for solving the angles:<br>  <br>  7)  You know the m<9 = 80, therefore m<12 has to be 180 - 80 = 100<br>  <br>  Are we to assume that the two vertical lines are parallel?  If so...<br>  8) The angle of <1 = <9.  Which means 100 again.<br>  9)  If m<1 = 100, then we know m<4 has to be 180 - 100 = 80<br>  10) Same thing.  m<4 = 80, so m<3 = 180 - 100 = 80.<br>  <br>  Notice a pattern here?  Two opposite angles are equal to each other.  <1 = <3 and <2 = <4.<br>  <br>  11)  Using the principle above, if <5 = 68, then <7 = 68 as well.<br>  12)  Remember, the lines are parallel, so <16 must be equal to <8.  Therefore, if <8 = 180 - <5.  <5 we know is 68, so <8 = 180 - 68 = 112.  So <16 = 112 as well.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps, and I hope my assumption about the parallel lines is correct!|`|c3988adee76bb2df1e09bf7fdb3893bbaa	<12 = 100<br>  <1 = Insufficient data<br>  <4 = Insufficient data<br>  <3 = Insufficient data<br>  <7 = 68<br>  <16 = Insufficient data<br>  <br>  If some of these lines were parallel, we could answer the question more fully.|`|8IKWLt76aa	Numbers 1,3, 9, and 11 are all 80 degrees<br>  Numbers 2,4,10, and 12 are all 100 degrees<br>  Numbers 5,7,13, and15 are all 68 degrees<br>  Numbers 6,8,14, and 16 are all 112 degrees

So the equation becomes<br>  px^2 + qx + r - (p(x - 2)^2 + q(x - 2) + r) = 2x - 1;<br>  px^2 + qx + r - px^2 + 4px - 4p - qx + 2q - r = 2x - 1;<br>  4px + 2q - 4p = 2x - 1.<br>  Since you want your equality holding for all x you must have<br>  4p = 2<br>  2q - 4p = -1<br>  which solved gives p = 1/2, q = 1/2.<br>  I hope I helped you.

Blood flows out of the capillaries at the arteriole end since blood pressure is high in the arteries. At the venule end, the capillaries widen into veins, so pressure decreases, and therefore the fluid flows back in.|`|cicyiuiXaa	osmosis

Right now my plan for me to pass math for the fourth marking period is to always come to class and on time. Pay attention to your teacher, always ask him for help if you don't understand, do your class work, do your home work, and study and pass your tests. Also ask him if you can do extra work and try to get a tutor. For your other classes do the same, and make your self a schedule to stay organize and on top of your game. I made this plan with my mom and I know it sounds cliche but, so far it has been working for me. With your parents' help every thing will work out for you.<br>  <br>  Good luck.
AA11087517	For the second problem the range equation would be the easiest solution:  d = (v?^2 / g) x sin(2 Θ) where d is distance (or range), v? is initial velocity, g is acceleration due to gravity (32 ft/s^2 or 9.8 m/s^2), and Θ is the angle.  Just rearrange the equation to solve for v?.  <br>  <br>  There might be an easier way for the first one, but off the top of my head, use the range equation to tell you how far it will go when the ball comes back down to a height of 5 feet.  At that point the angle and velocity will be the same as the release point.  Then you could find the vertical component of velocity and since we know the acceleration due to gravity and the distance it has to travel to the ground, you can find the time it will take to fall 5 feet.  Use the time it takes to fall to the ground and the horizontal velocity component to find the distance it will travel laterally as it falls the last 5 feet.  Add this number to the result of the range equation and that will be your distance.<br>  <br>  Of course, all this neglects friction due to air resistance.

JUmfm168aa	Hello,<br>  <br>  For (a), you need only consider the sign of sin( 3t ), since 6 is always positive.<br>  <br>  Since 0 < t < ?π, trebling gives: 0 < 3t < 1?π.<br>  <br>  Sine is positive at 0 < 3t < π.<br>  However, at 3t = 0, and at 3t = π, sine is 0.<br>  Note that since 0 < t < ?π, you may ignore t = 3t = 0.<br>  Sine is negative at π < 3t < 2π.<br>  Since 0 < t < ?π, you may ignore 1?π < 3t < 2π.<br>  <br>  Dividing through by three leads to these inequalities in t.<br>  So, you have that the expression is first positive, for 0 < t < ?π.<br>  Then, it is 0 at t = ?π.<br>  Then, it is negative at ?π < t < ?π.<br>  <br>  Taking rightwards as positive, it moves to the right for 0 < t < ?π.<br>  It is stationary at t = ?π.<br>  It moves leftwards for ?π < t < ?π.<br>  <br>  For (b), you need to know that s(t) = ∫ v(t) dt.<br>  So: s(t) = ∫ 6 sin( 3t ) dt = 6 ∫ sin( 3t ) dt.<br>  Integrating:<br>  s(t) = 6 [ - ? cos( 3t ) + C]<br>  So:<br>  s(t) = 6C - 2cos( 3t ).<br>  Let K = 6C, so:<br>  s(t) = K - 2cos( 3t ).<br>  Since s(0) = 3, you can use t = 0, s(t) = 3 to get:<br>  3 = K - 2cos( 3*0 ) = K - 2 cos(0) = K - 2*1 = K - 2.<br>  Thus, adding 2: K = 5.<br>  So:<br>  s(t) = 5 - 2cos( 3t ).<br>  <br>  The final position is at time t = ?π.<br>  s(?π) = 5 - 2cos( 3*?π ) = 5 - 2cos( 1?π ) = 5 - 2*0 = 5.<br>  <br>  The final position, given rightwards is positive, is 5 units right of the origin of motion.

AA11146651	First, try to write the problem as an equation.  You've got two different types of vinegar that will make (equal) a third vinegar, so:<br>  1.  62%A + 31%B = 57%C  <br>  <br>  Also, you know that:<br>  2.  A + B = 310 liters<br>  3.  C = 310<br>  <br>  Now, #1 has 3 variables.  In order to solve it, you need to find a way to get it down to 1 variable.  You can substitute 310 for C.  And, if you re-arrange #2, you get B = 310 - A.  Now you can solve it, like this:<br>  62%A + 31%(310 - A) = 57%(310)<br>  .62A + .31(310 - A) = .57(310)<br>  .62A + 96.1 - .31A = 176.7<br>  .31A = 80.6<br>  A = 260

But a sphere has size.<br>  <br>  Another problem I try to grasp is this: the universe is "expanding", and this expansion is observable. Think of a balloon inflating. It can't "expand" if it is infinite and endless. And expansion suggests a membrane on the outside, which could reach a maximum pressure, and then burst. In fact, the universe is believed to have a diameter of 93 billion light years. This of course, quantifying its size, means it is finite. Space is said to be curved, which again implies a sphere on the grand scale of things.<br>  <br>  Is the universe like the inflating balloon, finite in size, waiting to explode?

KJHw0oI3aa	The law of conservation of mass states that the mass of reactants must equal the mass of the products.  Atoms that existed as part of reactants are not destroyed or created during a chemical change.  They are merely rearranged, and are present in the substances that exist after the chemical change is complete.  <br>  <br>  For example, if you are baking a cake from "scratch", you would mix the ingredients such as flour, sugar, water, eggs, flavoring, etc.  The cake batter does not look or smells too appetizing before baking.  After you take the cake out of the oven, its appearance, texture, aroma, and taste has changed indicating that new substances were formed from the old ones.  The cake theoretically should weigh exactly the same as the ingredients you put into the batter, except for some water that evaporated during baking process.|`|TP8xmkOZaa	Mass is neither created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction.

F6IOLf3Aaa	It can be done with practice and by taking a systematic approach to training the non-dominate hand.<br>  <br>  For example, if your right handed and want to use your left hand to write with effectively.  You can start off by making your left hand write letters, words, and sentences, etc., but it will take a long, long time to achieve the same quality of writing as with the right hand. The way around that is to "teach" your left hand how to write and do numbers just like you would teach a 1st. grader how to write and do numbers, from the very beginning.  You start off by using the left hand for making number figures, by making (printing) all capital letters, then little letters, then punctuation. When the left hand has perfected those functions, you graduate it to learning to actually write numbers, capital letters, little letters and punctuation; then you are ready to teach your left hand to write words and sentences, etc.<br>  Taking that approach is probably the most efficient means for developing useful long term writing skills in the non-dominate hand.<br>  <br>  In fact, when a child starts school, that would be the perfect time for them to learn to use both hands equally well in doing their school work.<br>  <br>  See: <a href="http://nowgetcreative.com/power.htm" rel="nofollow">http://nowgetcreative.com/power.htm</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://lastcrazyhorn.wordpress.com/2009/01/18/well-on-the-other-hand/" rel="nofollow">http://lastcrazyhorn.wordpress.com/2009/...</a>|`|HJR5ZCpHaa	Yes they can, they just need to practice alot.<br>  <br>  =)<br>  Answer mine?<br>  <a href="http://ca.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090222164937AAs4p9f">http://ca.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|MPbB0ri1aa	Your handedness is genetically predetermined, however people can train themselves to use the other hand if they want, too, but it will not change what their natural dominate hand is.|`|G0QugnQ8aa	yes, if they work on it..although I have been able to do a lot with both hands for a while, like writing, eating, and stuff|`|6JEhoZ08aa	With writing, I dont know.

Mist I guess would come when the clouds are low and shedding their moisture, but in a smaller form than rain drops.<br>  Also ask a fisherman that has been in the trade for years.. they'll know best, their lives depend on such knowledge.<br>  <br>  P.S. I posted a "question" for you because a comment I wanted to add about the color blue wasn't able to be added since the question is being voted on... I think you'll find it fascinating...<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Aoksrs0QXPZrOkdfp10gqKzsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090221231252AAHBcOW">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  BY JAN NULL<br>  Special to the Mercury News <br>  <br>  Predicting fog proves a<br>  cloudy proposition<br>  <br>  Q.  How do forecasters predict fog?  Lucy Baldwin - Palo Alto<br>  <br>  A.  Predicting the fog and low clouds of the Bay Area is certainly a non-trivial activity. Many meteorologists who have worked in other parts of the country say the combination of subtle fog patterns and microclimates makes it one of the trickiest phenomena to forecast.<br>  <br>  To predict fog, we look at various factors. Among these is the amount of moisture in the lower atmosphere and whether the temperature will fall to the dew point, allowing condensation to occur. If low clouds are spreading inland from the coast, we also look at the depth of the marine layer and how low the<br>  base of the clouds will be.<br>  <br>  While some of this information is available from the computer simulations of the atmosphere, it often comes down to knowledge of the area and its fog patterns.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Source # 2:<br>  <br>  Fog usually occurs after it has rained and the air is still saturated with moisture and the temperature overnight has dropped near the dew point.<br>  <br>  Source # 3  Lows and highs; Barometric pressure variations from day to day<br>  <br>  At first thought, you might expect the air of the atmosphere to distribute itself uniformly over the surface of the earth so that the barometric pressure at the same elevation would be the same everywhere. After all, the water in a pond or lake "seeks its own level," and, except for the tides, the water in the oceans does as well.<br>  <br>  But this is not the case with the atmosphere. Several factors, among them the rotation of the earth and the uneven heating of the earth's surface by the sun, come together to cause the air to seemingly slosh about so that at some places it is piled up deeper than at other places. The entire surface of the earth is covered with these mountains and valleys of air, in an ever-changing pattern. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Click to Enlarge            Where the air is heaped up into a pile, the barometric pressure on the ground will be greater than the average value. This forms what meteorologists call a High, meaning a high pressure area. And where the air is less deep, referring to a valley, the barometric pressure will be lower than the average value and will represent a Low, or low pressure region. You have heard the weather people talk about a "high pressure ridge" or a "low pressure trough."<br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  As an experiment, place a pile of water in the middle of the kitchen table and watch what happens. Water doesn't tend to stay piled up! Neither does air. The air on top of the mountains tends to flow down the slopes toward the valleys (referring to the mountains and valleys of air as opposed to actual mountains and valleys). That is, the tendency is for air to flow from a high pressure region toward a low pressure region. <br>  <br>  But the rotation of the earth, although gentle and steady, exerts a major influence on the direction in which the air moves. Rather than for the air to move (or, wind to blow) directly away from a high, it will tend to circulate around the high in a clockwise direction with only a small component of its motion being directed outward from the high. And where the air flows into a low pressure region, it will tend to circulate in a counter-clockwise pattern, with only a small inward component. <br>  <br>  [Note: the direction of air circulation around highs and lows is reversed in the southern hemisphere.]<br>  <br>  To a remarkable extent, the winds tend to blow more or less parallel to the "contours of equal pressure" (isobars) drawn on a weathermap. Typically the angular difference in direction between the isobars and the actual wind is less than 20 degrees, angled out from a high or inward toward a low.<br>  <br>  Barometric pressure variations from day to day<br>  <br>  It is not realistic to expect the mountains and valleys of air to remain constantly over the same portion of the earth's surface; they move. We see this on the weathermap as the incessant motion of the highs and the lows.<br>  <br>  When a mountain of air happens to drift over our little airport, we experience a high barometric pressure. When a valley floats over us, we get a low barometric pressure. It's just that simple. <br>  <br>  <br>  Altimeter in a WWII P-51 Mustang<br>  <br>  Click to Enlarge        <br>  The range of variation is not all that great, generally 0.5 in/Hg or less above or below the average. The pressure in Honolulu is one of the least variable; the record low is 29.34 recorded in 1936 and the record high is 30.32 recorded in 1905. That's just slightly less than an inch of mercury between the lowest and highest readings. <br>  <br>  I don't know the highest barometric pressure ever recorded, but a high of 30.50 in/Hg is noteworthy. Here in North Carolina, USA, a high of 30.40 is reason to call home, just because it's rather unusual. Today, at the airport (EXX, 10/25/03), I photographed an altimeter in a P-51 whose Kollsman window showed 30.39. Checked it against the local weather service, and they were reporting 30.36. All these are corrected to sea level, of course.<br>             <br>  Kollsman window; Reading = 30.39 <br>  <br>  <br>  The lowest pressures are probably associated with hurricanes. Hurrican Mitch in 1998 produced a low of 27.08 in/Hg, and Floyd in 1999 gave us a low of 27.32. The lowest sea level pressure ever recorded in the western hemisphere was associated with Hurricane Gilbert in 1988. An NOAA aircraft recorded a low pressure of 26.22 in/Hg on September 13, 1988. These are the extremes, however, Normally, lows are not nearly that pronounced, seldom reaching a pressure as low as 29.00.<br>  <br>  Pressure Equivalents:<br>  <br>  1 Atmosphere (as a unit of pressure) = 14.7 psi = 34 ft water column = 76 cm/Hg <br>       = 29.92 in/Hg = 1.013 bar = 1,013 mbar<br>  1 bar = 1,000 mbar = 14.5 psi = 29.53 in/Hg = 0.9869 atm<br>  1 psi = 27.68 inches water column = 2.036 in/Hg = 6.859 kPa<br>  1 kPa = 1,000 Pascals = 0.1458 psi <br>  A miscellaneous tidbit, at no extra charge:<br>  <br>  One gallon of water weighs 8.34 pounds. One gallon of gasoline weighs about 6 pounds.<br>  <br>  1 psi corresponds to 27.68 inches water column or about 37 inches of a column of gasoline. <br>  <br>  You will lose roughly 1 psi for every 3 feet of elevation your fuel line rises above the fuel pump. Or, if you have gravity feed, a drop of about 3 feet is required to produce a pressure of 1 psi. <br>  <br>  Disclaimer: These figures for gasoline are only approximate because I don't have an accurate value for the specific gravity of gasoline. According to a US Dept of Energy document, a gallon of gasoline may weigh anywhere from 5.8 to 6.5 pounds. I suppose it depends upon the ethanol content, if any, and on the amount of lead it contains, if any<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Doc Green <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  BUILD PROJECT <br>  Site Pages <br>  Featured Links <br>  Site Map <br>  About Us <br>  Home <br>  FEATURED BUILD     <br>  CH-II Short Wing      <br>          * ARTICLES * <br>  1.

The wet bulb must be constantly in water soaked cotton wool.<br>  <br>  You read both thermometers and average the temperatures. The wet bulb will always be the lower temperature.<br>  <br>  You plot that average temperature on a time-line diagram.<br>  <br>  You take a bucket of surface sea water and read its temperature and plot it on your diagram.<br>  <br>  If both lines are converging, your projected line crossing in time is when fog will appear, i.e. when dew point temperature equal sea water temperature. Note that, at that moment, wet and dry bulb will show the same temperature because no evaporation is possible in fog.<br>  <br>  Sea mist or haze, is just anything prior to fog: when the "spread," i.e. the difference between atmospheric temperature and dew point temperature has very little difference; perhaps one degree or a fraction of a degree.<br>  <br>  Also note that fog, mist or haze are most common in an inversion; i.e. when the air is warmer above than under. That happens mostly in a high pressure with clear sky, sinking air from above (warmed up adiabatially) and radiation cooling during the night, in a clear sky.|`|0e9846c69a3447404194ba8083d4f969aa	You could try weather.com, but I really don't know.

DkwylteKaa	You're actually right...<br>  If you differentiate the function and solve f'(x)=0 you get 3 solutions (x=3 or x=7/9 or x=-2) so 3 points of the curve where the variations change direction.<br>  <br>  More details :<br>  Your initial function f(x)=(x+2)^5(x-3)^4 is the product of two functions :<br>  u(x)=(x+2)^5 and v(x)=(x-3)^4<br>  The first derivative of f(x) is of the form :<br>  f'(x)=u'v+uv' where u'(x)=5(x+2)^4 and<br>  v'(x)=4(x-3)^3<br>  so the first derivative is :<br>  f'(x)=5(x+2)^4*(x-3)^4+(x+2)^5*4(x-3)^...<br>  factor by (x-3)^3 and get :<br>  f'(x)=(x-3)^3*(5*(x+2)^4*(x-3)+4*(x+2)...<br>  factor again by (x+2)^4 :<br>  f'(x)=(x+2)^4*(x-3)^3*(5*(x-3)+4*(x+2)...<br>  Finally :<br>  f'(x)=(x-3)^3*(x+2)^4*(9x-7)<br>  So to solve f'(x)=0 just solve :<br>  x-3=0 or x+2=0 9x-7=0<br>  hence<br>  x=3 or x=-2 or x=7/9<br>  The derivative is equal to 0 in three points so there are 3 critical points.

x54JPCE0aa	You need to find reference points.<br>  <br>  First off, find the y-intercept, which is where the expression crosses the x-axis.<br>  <br>  You do this by setting it to 0.<br>  x^3 ? 4x + 1 = 0<br>  <br>  There are no obvious ways to solve this one.<br>  <br>  So let's come back to this step later.<br>  <br>  Let's try to find the y-intercept, where x = 0.<br>  y-intercept = 0^3 ? 4·0 + 1<br>  y-intercept = 1<br>  <br>  Okay, so now you know that the expression crosses the y-axis at x = 0.<br>  <br>  Now, we will use derivatives to find more information.<br>  <br>  If you don't know what a derivative is, it's an expression that finds the slope of a function at all times. The derivative of y = 2x + 1, is y = 2.<br>  <br>  The notation of the derivative of y is "d/dx y". So the derivative of x^3 ? 4x + 1 is d/dx (x^3 ? 4x + 1).<br>  <br>  To find the derivative of a sum, you find the derivative of each part and add them together. Mathematically:<br>  d/dx (x^3 ? 4x + 1) = d/dx x^3 ? d/dx 4x + d/dx 1<br>  <br>  Kind of like distribution multiplication over addition, isn't it?<br>  <br>  The derivative of an expression of form ax^b is abx^(b ? 1). And the derivative of a constant is always 0.<br>  <br>  d/dx x^3 ? d/dx 4x + d/dx 1 = 3x2 ? 4<br>  <br>  Now, the way that we use this 3x2 ? 4, is by plotting that, and using it to find patterns in x^3 ? 4x + 1. Where 3x2 ? 4 is positive, x^3 ? 4x + 1 increases. Where 3x2 ? 4 is negative, x^3 ? 4x + 1 decreases. Where 3x2 ? 4 is zero, x^3 ? 4x + 1 stands still.<br>  <br>  So solve 3x2 ? 4 = 0, which is pretty easy:<br>  3x2 ? 4 = 0 // Use a2 ? b2 = (a + b)(a ? b).<br>  (x√3 + 2)(x√3 ? 2) = 0 // Combine both into one expression.<br>  x√3 ± 2 = 0 // Move over the ±2.<br>  x√3 = ±2 // Multiply by √3/3<br>  x = ±2/3 √3<br>  <br>  At positive/negative two-third roots of 3, there are important points on the graph.<br>  <br>  You find out if they are maximum or minimums are just tangent arcs by looking at the numbers before and after those x-values on the graph.<br>  2/3 √3 ≈ 1.154 700<br>  <br>  So, we will look at 3x2 ? 4 for x = ?2, x = 0, and x = 2<br>  3(?2)2 ? 4 = 8<br>  3(0)2 ? 4 = ?4<br>  3(2)2 ? 4 = 8<br>  <br>  Since the slope goes up before the first point (?2/3 √3), then down, that's a maximum. However, for the second point (2/3 √3), slope goes down, then up, so it's a minimum.<br>  <br>  Remember that.<br>  <br>  Now we'll find x^3 ? 4x + 1 for those two x-values. We can forget about the derivative :-P<br>  <br>  (?2/3 √3)^3 ? 4(?2/3 √3) + 1 =<br>  ?8/27·3√3 + 8/3 √3 + 1 =<br>  ?8/9 √3 + 8/3 √3 + 1 =<br>  ?8/9 √3 + 8/3 √3 + 1 =<br>  16/9 √3 + 1<br>  Approximately 4.079 201, so about (?1.154 700, 4.079 201) is a maximum.<br>  <br>  (2/3 √3)^3 ? 4(2/3 √3) + 1 =<br>  8/27·3√3 ? 8/3 √3 + 1 =<br>  8/9 √3 ? 8/3 √3 + 1 =<br>  8/9 √3 ? 8/3 √3 + 1 =<br>  1 ? 16/9 √3<br>  Approximately ?2.079 201, so about (1.154 700, ?2.079 201) is a minimum.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately. After plotting those three points, I don't know much more that can help other than plugging in every integer in the domain ?10 ≤ x ≤ 10.<br>  <br>  Hope that these can help at least somewhat.|`|cbLsxrr7aa	Well, first of all, it's a *cubic* trinomial, so the graph will be like a stretched out "S."

Essentially, this action is a transfer of energy from the sun to the wind to the waves.|`|nwsgLAN5aa	As winds blow across the surface of the sea, they pass their energy to water particles, causing them to move in a circular motion. As these moving particles collide with others, they pass more energy to them, and create a wave. The faster the wind blows, the faster these waves get, and out at sea they begin to merge together and create several larger waves.<br>  <br>  :)

Because the mustangs of the US, then New Forest, Dartmoor and various others all over the UK, as well as Carmagues in France are among the feral breeds - composed of the descendants of domesticated animals that went wild. Then Przewalski's wild horse was considered extinct in the wild, but captive breeding programmes have reintroduced it to reserves in China and Mongolia, so it's as wild as the arabian oryx. There's an eastern european horse bred to resemble the extinct tarpan which is technically feral but treated as wild, because it's intentionally not under human control.  that's about it, I think.|`|5gG42iOpaa	There are, but they are all descendants of domestic ones<br>  <br>  We have some near my grandparent's ranch in Montana|`|OxmoHPhcaa	Most likely!|`|yzIB8Cbiaa	The person above me is probably right. there are wild ones in places such a mongolia.|`|uAyYRXnvaa	Moreton Island off the coast of Brisbane (Australia) has brumbies roaming around.

0P6mAOk7aa	If the point C is (x,0), then<br>  D = AC + BC = sqrt[(x - 2)^2 + 2^2] + sqrt[(x - 11)^2 + 4^2].  The derivative <br>  dD/dx = (x - 2)/sqrt[(x - 2)^2 + 4] + (x - 11)/sqrt[(x - 11)^2 + 16].  Setting dD/dx = 0 and simplifying, we get x^2 + 2x - 35 = 0, which has solutions x = -7 and x = 5.  Clearly x = -7 does not give a minimum distance, so the minimum occurs when C is (5,0).

O0qUkMz8aa	A)Potato tubers are stem tissue; they're thickened underground stems (stolons), not roots.<br>  <br>  B)Not sure about this. It's been a long time since I've dug up a daffodil.  Possibly the "bulb" that gets divided when propagating daffodils is a cormel? I'm not saying it is a cormel, but it might be, I'm not really sure.  Alternatively, the answer might be that even though daffodil bulbs can be divided and new daffodils planted, they don't really reproduce this way (not without a person around to dig them up and divide them; absent human intervention, the plant would just get bigger and bigger).<br>  <br>  C)Grafting doesn't produce more plants. Marcotting is inducing a plant to produce roots from the stem, cutting the stem up and planting the newly rooted sections.  Grafting takes two plants and turns them into one; it doesn't really produce more plants.
ajzq5nKIaa	This should be in physics, not maths. The clue is in the title of your question.
Ftkr9jqYaa	a. American Revolution:<br>  How did General Amherst spread smallpox to the Native Americans?<br>  <br>  Jeffrey Amherst's name became tarnished by stories of smallpox-infected blankets used as germ warfare against American Indians. These stories are reported, for example, in Carl Waldman's Atlas of the North American Indian. Waldman writes, in reference to a siege of Fort Pitt (Pittsburgh) by Chief Pontiac's forces during the summer of 1763:<br>  <br>  "... Captain Simeon Ecuyer had bought time by sending smallpox-infected blankets and handkerchiefs to the Indians surrounding the fort -- an early example of biological warfare -- which started an epidemic among them. Amherst himself had encouraged this tactic in a letter to Ecuyer.<br>  <br>  Some people have doubted these stories; other people, believing the stories, nevertheless assert that the infected blankets were not intentionally distributed to the Indians, or that Lord Jeff himself is not to blame for the germ warfare tactic.<br>  <br>  b. Soviet "Superbugs"<br>  According to Vladimir Pasechnik, what had the Soviets developed?<br>  <br>  In 1979, a rare outbreak of anthrax disease in the city of Sverdlovsk killed nearly 70 people. The Soviet government publicly blamed contaminated meat, but U.S. intelligence sources suspected the outbreak was linked to secret weapons work at a nearby army lab. <br>  <br>  In 1992, Russia allowed a U.S. team to visit Sverdlovsk. The team's investigation turned up telltale evidence in the lungs of victims that many died from inhalation anthrax, likely caused by the accidental release of aerosolized anthrax spores from the military base. Given the hundreds of tons of anthrax the Sverdlovsk facility could produce, the release of just a small amount of spores was fortunate.<br>  <br>  News of the immensity of the Soviets' biological weapons program began to reach the West in 1989, when biologist Vladimir Pasechnik defected to Britain. The stories he told—of genetically altered "superplague," antibiotic-resistant anthrax, and long-range missiles designed to spread disease—were confirmed by later defectors like Ken Alibek and Sergei Popov. <br>  <br>  What happened to Soviet Scientists when the Cold War ended?<br>  <br>  The Soviet program was spread over dozens of facilities and involved tens of thousands of specialists. In the late 1980s and 1990s, many of these scientists became free agents—with dangerous knowledge for sale.

AA10132204	The biggest problem is that most people take freshman chemistry as freshman.  They are just out of high school where they probably didn't have to study much and they have never lived on their own.  And chemistry is probably the first "logical" course they have taken with lots of math.  All that in combination is too much for many.<br>  <br>  For you, you have some of that out of the way, so you should not much problem.  See below for some hints.  You will probably like organic better since it is more like biology and doesn't have the math of freshman chemistry.<br>  <br>  When in a chemistry class do the following:<br>  <br>  1. Take good notes EVERY day.<br>  2. Copy those notes over in another notebook in a good hand EVERY night when you get home, filling holes as needed.<br>  3. Ask the teacher at least one question each day.<br>  4. Read the assignment twice before a class. Once each day for two days is best, if you know in advance.<br>  5. If the teacher assigns the odd problems for homework, do the even ones also. If they assign all of them, ask the teacher where you can get more problems.<br>  6. Start the problems the day they are assigned. You should finish at least a day before due, if possible so you can ask for help.<br>  7. Visit your teacher during office hours each week to get more instruction on topics not clear. Even if you think they are clear, go anyway. Ask the teacher for exceptions or additional harder examples.<br>  8. Go to a bookstore and find the Chemistry problem books and learning guides put out by different companies (SAT prep and the like). Find one on your level and buy it.<br>  9. Go to yard sales or goodwill stores and find one or two textbooks other than yours. Sometimes, ideas click better from different books.<br>  10. Visit your teacher after each test to make sure you understand eveything you missed.<br>  <br>  Chemistry is based on problems and learning how to work them, as well as learning the concepts. It is really a math course with chemistry as the subject and you must do repeated problems for it to click.<br>  <br>  The problems most students have is not working the problems, thinking it will just come to them, and the biggest, not taking advantage of the teacher. They are there to help and if you want to learn, use them.

CCeRdaoLaa	I was under the impression that fetal pigs were taken from pregnant pigs slaughtered for meat.  The fetal ones were simply left-over waste (and no good for meat), so they were sold to educational companies for classroom use.  At least, that's how my physiology professor explained it.  <br>  <br>  If that's the case, there really isn't any reason not to dissect them.  They are similar to humans in internal layout, so they make great educational tools.  The benefit of doing hands-on dissection is huge, since it gives a much better impression of anatomy and physiology than a simple textbook (and actually performing the dissection makes it stick in your memory).  I suppose the preservative they use is mildly toxic... but nothing a pair of gloves wouldn't solve.<br>  <br>  Since the pigs are dead anyways - since they aren't killed for classroom use, they'd just be ground up or incinerated if they weren't used - there really isn't a reason not to dissect them.|`|753sjTJoaa	Fetal pigs are commonly dissected because their internal structures and layout of the pig's body is very similar to that of the human anatomy. Pigs, even in the fetal stage, have similar muscular systems and circulatory systems and it is important to have a "hands on" or "close physical"  look at the internal organs and body systems to fully understand how they work and sustain life.

E0U2yII3aa	The most common kind of stars would be main-sequence stars. Most of them are red dwarves since none yet has transitted into being a black dwarf at the current age of the universe. To answer the second question, you simply need to look at the spectral signature of the star and its luminosity. That is by analyzing the light from them. Some stars are too bright and weird that astronomers are baffled if indeed they are main-sequence stars or not. How did they do this? Main sequence stars are hydrogen burners. By knowing how much signature is imprinted by hydrogen in their light tells how chemically enriched a star is already. You can also compare stars of similar masses and tell by their current luminosity. The more luminous a star turns out than a star of the same mass, the farther it is from the main sequence.|`|jlf1sSrGaa	Red dwarfs are the most common type of star. Temperature and luminosity are the two main ways of determining a star's type.|`|qKvnpwL6aa	That's probably a main sequence star.

Others have either graduated to other elements, or have exploded, and collapsed, using gravity to heat the core and glow.  Some have collapsed into brown dwarfs, some are dark cinders, some are neutron stars or pulsars, and some have become black holes.<br>  The spectrum of light from a star will show what elements are in it, what color temperature it is, and about twenty other things about it.

C, Kw = 1.0e-14. So, you can plug in Ka (2.3e-9) and Kw (1.0e-14) and solve for Kb. From Kb, you can then...oh wait. I think you may need to consider normality here, actually, haha. Normality = # of equivalent solute/volume (in Liters) of solution = Moles of species x # of H+ (or # of OH-, in the case of a base). Also, N1V1=N2V2. <br>  <br>  So, for a solution of 0.115M Ba(OH)2, N = 0.115 x 2 (b/c there are 2 OH molecules for every molecule of Ba(OH)2); and for a solution of 0.146 HOBr, N = 0.146 x 1 (b/c there is 1 H+ for every HOBr), and volume is given as 65.0mL, which you convert to 0.065L. So, you plug in: (0.146N)(0.065L)=(0.230N)(V), and V = the volume of 0.115M Ba(OH)2 needed for the titration. <br>  <br>  <br>  (d) You're given the molarity of HOBr (0.160M), the volume of HOBr (0.125L), and the desired concentration of H+ (5.00e-9M). So, the first thing you'll want to do is calculate the molecular mass of NaOBr, which is going to be 23+16+80 = 119g/mol. <br>  <br>  ...I'm going to have to think on this one, but I'll post what I've written thus far in the mean time.
WRNGZviXaa	When genes are linked, they are found so close together on the same chromosome that the probability that crossing over occurs between them is limited.<br>  <br>  The principle of independent assortment states that alleles arrange themselves randomly in the gametes.  So, if you have the genotype AaBb, you are expected to make gametes AB, Ab, aB, and ab in equal amounts.  However, if genes A and B are linked and A and B are on one chromsome while a and b are on the other, the genes will not assort independently.  Since crossing over between them is limited, more AB and ab gametes will be produced than Ab and aB gametes.

GASTNilgaa	It's true!<br>  <br>  Let p and q denote the rational numbers.  The given hypotheses imply that the polynomial<br>  <br>  f(x) = (x-p)(x-q) = x^2 - (p+q) x + pq<br>  <br>  has integer coefficients.<br>  <br>  The "rational root theorem" implies that any root of this polynomial, when written in lowest terms a/b (with a, b relatively prime integers and b nonzero), must have the property that a divides the constant term of the polynomial (pq) and b divides the coefficient of the x^2 term (namely 1).  But if b divides 1 we conclude that b = 1 or -1.  Conclusion: any rational root of this polynomial is an integer.<br>  <br>  Since p and q are rational roots of this polynomial, they too are integers.<br>  <br>  If you aren't familiar with the rational root theorem, I think the easiest thing to do would be to visit the Wikipedia page for it below and read the proof of it.  If you read through that proof, as it applies to the quadratic polynomial (x-p)(x-q), you will get a proof that p and q have to be integers because their sum and product are.

Now based on this, they're asking...<br>  i)  The f(x) value for both function is the same or approaches the same number at x = to nearly 3.  Is this true?  Looking at the graph, for both functions, at x = nearly 3, their y value is the same: 5.  So, this is true.<br>  ii)  Is the graph from where it changes from x = 3 to x>3 following without break?  This is true since not a single x is skipped in the whole function.<br>  iii)  It is not.  This part is sticking out and so it cannot be.  It is differetiable from the left and from the right, but the left side will be 4 while the right side slope is 1, which are not equal.  So, not differentiable at that point.|`|AA11508270	The answer to this question is that the limit as x approaches 3 exists.<br>  <br>  For the limit to exists, you need the limit as x--->3+ and the limit as x -----> 3- to be equal.<br>  <br>  Limit as x is approaching 3 from the right(3+) is : 4(3) - 7 = 5<br>  <br>  Limit as x is approaching 3 from the left(3-) is : 3 + 2 = 5.<br>  <br>  Hence the limit as x is approaching 3 exists.|`|ze7HgH19aa	ii|`|o7Dnlncpaa	iii.

Only focus on the largest term in the term you're trying to divide through by, and let the rest be dealt with by the division algorithm:<br>  <br>  2x+3 | 4x^3 + 12x^2 + 7x - 3:<br>  2x goes into 4x^3 2x^2 times, so we multiply through to get<br>  2x^2(2x+3) = 4x^3 + 6x.  Subtract from 4x^3 + 12x^2 + 7x - 3:<br>  2x+3 | 6x^2 + 7x - 3:<br>  2x goes into 6x^2 3x times, so multiply through to get<br>  3x(2x+3) = 6x^2 + 9x.

Add up the terms you found to multiply through by to find what the division got you:<br>  2x^2 + 3x - 1 = (4x^3 + 12x^2 + 7x - 3)/(2x+3)<br>  <br>  3) You can divide this through to find the answer the long way, but also notice that since you're dividing by x-3, a remainder of 266 means you have 266/(x-3) left, while a remainder of 300 means you have 300/(x-3) left.  Then A means C and D means B, so neither only A, only B, only C nor only D is entirely correct: then A&C must be the answer.  You can verify this by dividing through as done above, or by multiplying  2x^3 + 7x^2 + 24x + 76 + 266/(x-1) by (x-1).

k5Ece8BTaa	There is no scientific evidence that supports the world ending in 2012.<br>  <br>   This scam about the world ending in 2012 isn't true. It's all just a silly hoax. It maybe true that that mayan calendar ends but, it doesn't mean the world is going to end. One of several Mayan calendars is the Long Count calendar, which is reset to day 0 every 1,872,000 days or 7057.5 years. The next reset date, by some calculations, is December 21, 2012. This is not a prediction of the end of the world. The Mayan Calendar has to end sometime. Besides, nobody can't predict when the end of the world is. You shouldn't always believe what you hear from other people. The scientific evidence about 2012 doesn't go together. Those who spread rumors about 2012 should be punished. You know what is sad, people may commit suicide over this thinking its the end of the world. Or maybe some people would get unwise with their money and spend it all like crazy and be in thousands of dollars in debt, just because they thought the world would end. Then they have to pay it off later and deal with the stress of those bills. That's why those who spread rumors about 2012 should be punished. You know what else is false about this 2012 garbage? <br>  <br>  ? Planet X (Nibiru) isn't going to hit the Earth it doesn't exist.<br>  ? Poles are switching everyday, this isn't going to happen all in just 1 day. This process takes thousands of years. Throughout geological history there has been may pole switches and life has still survived.<br>  ? Also people are saying these poles will switch in one day due to a black hole. That's NOT true. The nearest black hole to our galaxy is 1600 light years away.<br>  ? Sun will be lined up with a sunspot, but it doesn't mean it will wipe out all life on Earth. One time ago, Earth was lined up with a sunspot and people were on it and everybody didn't just die.<br>  ? There is not going to be catasphoic earthquakes. <br>  ? No coment will hit Earth or asteriods.<br>  ? These cultures such as the Japanese, Mayans, Japanese or whoever didn't predict such a thing. As I just said, this is just a scam to make money off of ignorant people who don't look at the facts.<br>  ? If you have been watching the Hysteria Chanel about 2012 or anything like that, all they are just trying to do is scare people so they can make money.<br>  <br>  Each time the end the world is predicted. They are always wrong. Here are all the predictions of when the world would end and each time they where wrong. Every year there is a prediction like this. I'm sure that if 2012 doesn't happen, they will think of something else. Through out history the end has been predicted but has never happened.|`|stAeoUeSaa	Winter solstice Dec. 21, 2012 is just the revealing of the 'antichrist' or the 'man of perdition' at the mid-point of what Christians call the 7 year Tribulation (just subtract 1260 days to get the start and add 1260 days to get the end). Satanists and many pagan cultures from every corner of the world all throughout history have celebrated this like the Sumerians, Babylonians, Cherokee, Hopi, Chinese I-Ching (confirmed by Terence McKenna), Mayans (Pacal Votan; Chilam Balam of Tizimin, Mani, Chumayel; Jaguar Prophet), Egyptians, Celts, etc. This evil event is called "the abomination that causes desolation" that will be set up in the Jewish Temple's Holy of Holies when the antichrist is imbued with the spirit of satan himself.

Only three sides of the pen need fencing because part of an existing wall will be used for one of the longer sides. Find the dimensions of the pen.<br>  <br>  That's the question.   To get the solution  let x be the length one of the<br>  sides.  It's parallel side will also be length x and since the farmer uses<br>  25 m of fencing, the remaining side parallel to the wall will be length <br>  25 - 2x .   Now we use the area of a rectangle formula to set up the <br>  equation.  <br>  A = 63 m2 = l w  = x(25 - 2x) .  <br>  Thus   25x - 2x2 = 63<br>  subtract 63 from both sides to get a quadratic equal to zero and we<br>  get 25x - 2x2 - 63 = 0<br>  in decending order<br>  -2x2 + 25x - 63 = 0<br>  multiply both sides by negative 1 and obtain<br>  2x2 - 25x +  63 = 0<br>  We need to see if this can factor.  <br>  Since 63 equals 7 times 9<br>  Try (2x  -   7     )(x -9  )<br>  and that multiplies to 2x2 - 18x  - 7x  + 63   <br>  and that simplifies to 2x2 - 25x +  63<br>  which is the trinomial we are trying to factor.<br>  Set each factor equal to zero giving us  2x = 7 --> x= 3.5 and x=9<br>  However one side is length x and the other is 25 - 2x<br>  if x = 3.5 then 25 - 2x = 25 -2(3.5) = 18 <br>  and if x = 9 then 25 - 2x = 25 - 18 = 7    <br>  Since part of an existing wall is being used for one of the LONGER sides,  we must pick the choice where the 25 -2x = 18  and<br>  that makes answer A the correct answer.

It is likely that if you have been taking hydrocodone for any length of time, had to increase to dose because of tolerance that other opiates, such as propoxyphene will have less of an effect.  However, it is not uncommon to switch medications because the receptors activated by drug A may not be exactly the same as for drug B.  In fact, there are at least three different types of opiate receptors in the brain and elsewhere.  In any event, you should be guided by your physician and not hesitate to report if a new medication is not working or if there are any side effects.|`|62fa2d0c6e8de6507e574cf4131634dfaa	I believe the answer to this is YES.

It does matter greatly that big mamss mean big weight, but that is no use if the mass isnt very dense, for example, if we had a pool big enough to hold jupiter, it would float instead of sinkin, because its  density is lower than water. Just like steel is more dense than aluminium, so a bigger mass of aluminium would weight the most compared to steel necesarily. We dont know the density of all these gases, so we wont ever know the exact valure.

z7BiMSWmaa	FADH2 and NADH donate H+ & electrons to the electron transport chain (ETC) in the inner membrane of the mitochondria. As the electrons pass from one carrier to another (Redox - reduction  = electron gain and Oxidation = electron loss) H+ are pumped into the space between the inner and outer membranes creating a H+ gradient with the stroma of the mitochondria. The H+ pass through the membrane bound ATP synthase to the matrix and ATP is produced.<br>  So, if there were no redox reactions in the ETS there would be no large scale generation of ATP - the whole point of respiration.

y0thw49daa	I think you are a bit misunderstanding. I have actually had a teacher or two this semester flat out say they do NOT care. I understand your concern, but I myself use it is a *resource* for if I get stuck. Not only this, but I use it to learn, not simply to copy down. Yes, obviously, just copying down would be dumb. But it's not like that at all. Not only this, but if there IS a course where the solution manual is frowned upon (I've had teachers flat out say this as well) then I still am able to easily do well on the homework, it just takes a little bit longer to figure it out on my own without any help.<br>  <br>  PS - I am one of the only few students at my university that is a senior and still has a 4.0 GPA, a member of Tau Beta Pi + Phi Kappa Phi (intending to keep my 4.0 all the way to the end, but I do have some difficult courses this semester so we'll see). So yes, I do learn through the homeworks - I ace every test that I take as a result. In fact, in my thermodynamics class, I was among the precious few who got 90-100+ on tests where the average was 50, and some got 40 or even lower. So you can't tell me that I am not learning anything through my methods of study.<br>  <br>  Not only this, but alot of students at my university have been lately coming to me for help on HW etc because they recognize that I DO put the work into the courses, and a lot of it.<br>  <br>  No offense if you were directing this topic to some of the other people out there though, if that's the case, my apologies. Because there ARE people out there who just copy and then fail hardcore on tests.<br>  <br>  *edited to sound less condenscending, sorry about that. Been in a bad mood lately lol<br>  <br>  As a final note, there is only one class this semester out of five that there is even a solution manual for (that I could find, at least.). And I'm ok without them, it just saves time for me, that's about it. I don't NEED them.|`|ifBmd8lYaa	If you never need a solution manual it can be because you are gifted and or hard-working.  Keep in mind that not everyone is like this.  But if they "rely" on the solution manual to pass it will only get worse and they will not make good engineers.  One problem is that with the little time you have to do something, some people can't keep up even if they are trying.  So it's either use the solution manual to get by now and hope to finish...or fail out now.  Some people take a bit of time to discover that engineering is not for them.  In my school the fail/drop-out rate is at least 1 in 5 it seems (close to 1 in 4).  When they reach the Junior level, those are the ones that are usually left to graduate.  Studying engineering is also a weeding out process.  Not everyone is meant to be one.  Some people just don't like it after a while too.  But sometimes, you can try to get by a "required subject" but have no real interest in it and never come back to it again.  But sometimes this can bite you in rear later though.|`|buLqy1b3aa	I think I have had similar experience so far in my EE program.  I try doing all the work by myself, which is obviously extremely challenging sometimes.<br>  <br>  Some students not only use the solutions manuals though, but also copy from their peers.  I don't have a problem with students helping each other, but often they just end up copying from each other.  I'm pretty upset when I get a worse grade on my homeworks than these students.<br>  <br>  The good news is that they usually get hammered in exams.  You generally have no chance of doing well on tests if you couldn't do the homework yourself.|`|MDQrdno8aa	I am an EE student, and I understand what you are saying.  But if those people are being unfair, it is to themselves.  Their lack of learning will one day catch up to them and then they will be sorry.<br>  <br>  There is, however, one good reason to have the answers to homework problems.  If you get it wrong, you can go back and find out why, which is the whole reason for the practice.  Many times I have used the answer to a problem in order to "back-calculate" and that made it much easier to locate where I made my mistake.<br>  <br>  Don't worry about what others do.

Some may see a weak front where others won't.|`|5586ad15a09ab2f36457c1e8042071f2aa	Air pressure is a function of the depth of air of the atmosphere above you AND the density of the air.
