MlTGAD9laa	I really like that name. Its cute, different, and easy to spell. Such a cute name!!!!!! I would definitely go with that name if you plan on having a baby girl!|`|wwCv89Wgaa	I kind of like it, its catchy, but i also really like the name belle so thats a cute nick name<br>  i think its cute|`|zTnR2ZFeaa	sorry im not a fan either. but if its what you like then go for it!  its your baby so you will be the one saying it everyday!!

Its not a name i would name my kid. What about isabelle?|`|Y4UF3kWxaa	it's a unique name :D but think twice before naming someone it.<br>  <br>  here i got some info =]<br>  <br>  The girl's name Jezebelle \j(e)-ze-belle, jezeb(el)-le\ is a variant of Jezebel (Hebrew), and the meaning of Jezebelle is "pure, virginal". <br>  <br>  The baby name Jezebelle sounds like Jezibelle, Jezybell and Jezabella. Other similar baby names are Yzabelle, Yzobelle, Izabelle, Jazelle, Jezibel, Jezabel, Jozelle, Jizelle and Jobelle. <br>  <br>  Jezebelle is a very rare female first name and a very rare surname (source: 1990 U.S. Census). Displayed below is the baby name popularity trend for the girl's name Jezebelle. Compare Jezebelle with related baby names.|`|KOcCenrEaa	will give boys the wrong idea of her just because of the name her parent decided to give her.|`|OEMIkJTUaa	I like it. It is very unique. Go for it!|`|8v40KEd0aa	Please don't do that to a girl. Not a good name.|`|8xlunDHVaa	not a good name it has a bad rap|`|tw1uePBbaa	not a fan...
077a430c1a605554bc4be87a313735a9aa	There is no way to tell for sure without having an ultrasound. Which I'm sure one you explain to them the situated your doctor will have no problem giving you one. <br>  <br>  But if it was my guess i would go with the 8 weeks.<br>  <br>  Typically you wouldn't receive an ultrasound until 20 weeks.|`|1lfgh3KPaa	Haha! First of all, congratulations on your new baby. It's kind of sad the situation you're going through and I went through the same thing. Actually all you need is some honey and some cold water. Mix the cold water with sugar. Eat lot's of vegetables and have your husband make you some stew. You will be like normal after that|`|OZrdXQMyaa	Honey you will just have to wait until ur scan. It is imperative that you receive a good standard of antenatal care for you and your unborn child. There is a possibility that you conceived twins and lost one. Which is more common than you would think.|`|GOcW0PW4aa	You could have had a miscarriage, but then gotten pregnant again!  No one can really explain why things happen, but either you had a miscarriage and got pregnant again, or there is a chance you had your period while pregnant!|`|lyMMjVNgaa	I think you should deffently get checked out <br>  the doctor will tell you in two days<br>  good luck!|`|z77TERJGaa	It's possible that you had a miscarriage and then got pregnant again.  And you probably should have gotten a DNC.  But I had a miscarriage and never had a DNC done and then got pregnant again and had a perfectly healthy daughter, the only thing that was different in my delivery than anyone else's was that I had two placenta come out instead of one and I only had one baby.  Or the other possibility is that your body still has some small amounts of HCG in it and that's the cause of your positive pregnancy test and no period. Well good luck!|`|KfGa8Hdiaa	Nooo idea!! Maybe you didn't have a miscarriage! I mean I miscarried earlier this year and there was no blood and I had to get a D&C. So the reverse seems possible too...that there is blood, but it isn't a miscarriage! I know...a convoluted thought! <br>  <br>  But I hope you are pregnant...seems like you want to be! And the sings are there...so good luck...and wait it out...at the end, does it really matter if you are 8 or 13 weeks? Even if you are 8 weeks pregnant, you could pretend its the same baby carrying on and baby just took a growth breather! <br>  <br>  Don't dwell on earlier m/c, if that's what it was. I try not to think about mine. I am 25 weeks pregnant now!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|96HWpdkFaa	It could have been a misscarige...although it could have just been a threatend misscarige!<br>  <br>  You'll find out at your ultrasound.<br>  <br>  Oh and the pregnancy test could have said positive even if you had a misscarige because the hormones are still there and don't go away right away.<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!
DTYHoinVaa	I am due shortly after you and have become like a crazy women on speed. Constantly cleaning rearranging, washing ceilings, walls, cars. I have cleaned the garage and basement. Deiced the driveway. Im like a nutcase. I think it has a lot to do with the fact that im done being sick for the time being and actually have energy.|`|0JQJs7lPaa	I've been severely tired almost my whole pregnancy. But about a week ago, I suddenly got all of this energy, so I've been running around like a maniac, cleaning and doing laundry and all of that fun stuff. I moved not too long ago, and my house has been kind of a disaster, and it's finally looking like a home!|`|qKnE08Rxaa	I know it's funny. I didn't do anything particular about nesting... maybe more cleaning or organizing baby's room. Actually, my hubby was nesting badly. He was shopping around furniture for baby's room. He decorated baby's room & did so many crazy stuff.|`|mqHL4UcRaa	I've been deep cleaning the house....every other day. I just want it to stay perfect for the baby! I'm losing it for sure.<br>  <br>  Note to Sammi is pregnant: There are other ways of listing a due date...shes probably due June 18th of 2009. lol.|`|qImMwhUHaa	I'm 36 weeks and I've only had 2 or 3 days of nesting so far. I really just want to organize and clean things out too.  I've been making candy and decorations for a friends baby shower. That's not baking but kinda the same. Everyone nests differently. I hope the desire to clean comes soon. I need to get things cleaned up before the baby and all the family arrive.|`|plI0WOrUaa	I keep fixing stuff in the house and organizing everything known to man.  I just want the house perfect.  I did before too, but now I am on a mission to get all of this stuff done before the baby arrives in June.  I feel like super mom already!!|`|Kx6LmwR2aa	i just get paranoid about everything and i hate wen people go " hey how's d baby" and touching my stomach i just flip|`|077a430c1a605554bc4be87a313735a9aa	hehe I was going nuts this morning. I saw dust on the t.v and BAM! i started rearranging furniture and cleaning everything. lol....|`|LGidAYDwaa	I cleaned out the closets, which were horrifying!  I also did a lot of cooking, mostly roasted veggies and fried green tomatoes. They were my worst craving.

u5cwRJ0Paa	I am 28 and have a 4 month old baby boy.  I think that although every 20 year old is different and you may be in a situation that would be ideal to bring a baby into you should think long and hard about this.  Make sure you have your own life first, make sure you have travelled, make sure you have had your fill of socialising with others your age, make sure you have loads of support, make sure you are in a good financial postition (which doesn't mean you have to be rich but don't have any debt, have your own vehicle and household furniture and have a bit in savings).  <br>  Thinking about having a baby and actually having one is totally different.  Women who don't yet have a baby(and that is including pregnant women) don't get it.  They don't yet know about the lack of sleep, the physical trauma you go through both with the birth and then adjusting to motherhood, breastfeeding, letting go of your former life, and just learning to understand your baby and be a mother to it.  You could read everything there is out there on having a baby but you will not know what it is like to have one until you have your own.|`|zTnR2ZFeaa	being only 20 i would really think long and hard about it before making any decisions, yes babies are cute and cuddly but a couple of my friends had babies around your age and i know that they felt very left out while the rest of us would go out partying or go on road trips plan holidays where she couldnt as she had a little one. so she had to stay at home. babies arent fashion accessories and once your a mum, your a mum forever! if its something you eally want and you have a loving supporting husband and can fiancially support yourselves and a baby then good luck to you!|`|3cLE5L7Saa	I don't know what its like to actually HAVE one yet, but if people would have told me about actually being pregnant, I would have been more careful to not get prego.<br>  Things people don't tell you:<br>  <br>  1. You will have discharge all the time<br>  2. Stretchmarks<br>  3. Peeing yourself when you sneeze or laugh<br>  4. Not being able to sleep <br>  5. Heartburn<br>  6. When you get close to being due you feel stabbing pains in your vagina<br>  7. They don't tell you how hard breastfeeding really might be until AFTER you get pregnant.<br>  8. Swollen extremities<br>  9. Not being able to even SHAVE YOUR FREAKIN CROTCH!!!<br>  10. Your belly itches, and its the worst game to play "try not to scratch the belly"<br>  11.  Being worried that the baby is okay in there<br>  12. I can't stand the doc checking my cervix<br>  13. Chaffing (OUCH!)<br>  14. Shortness of breath<br>  15. Not being able to keep food down for 3 months in the beginning<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I'm not sayin I've been miserable the whole time or anything, but I won't have another baby any time soon, and I wish people would have warned me about these things.  I'm sooooo happy its almost over.  The only thing now is that I'm giving up my life to raise a kid....no more kickin it and doing whatever the hell I want to.|`|TJ04fAgNaa	Pregnancy is very uncomfortable, childbirth is very painful, babies are exhausting, but every bit of it is worth the trouble when you hold your own.  Extremely rewarding.|`|1MEnCmwoaa	It is a lot of work! Your whole life changes, after that baby is born it is baby first then you. It of course has good parts too, like how you just love this little baby so much it makes you want to cry. I look at my daughter and just smile. Even when she is getting into everything in sight!<br>  If you are 20, I wouldn't necessarily say that you should wait, but make sure you are with someone, like a husband, that will be there to help raise the baby. It isn't something you just want to jump into. The baby is your whole life.|`|24T71hYjaa	You have a selfish little being who demands that you feed, bathe, cuddle, and wipe their poopy butts on THEIR schedule, regardless of how tired, hungry, and isolated you feel because you don't have time to take care of your own needs because you have become a slave to the new little master.<br>  <br>  Then when he becomes mobile you will continue to be amazed at his innumerable escape acts and attempts to tear up everything you own and will get into places where you never thought it possible.  <br>  <br>  When he learns to talk he will embarass you in public, everyone within 100 feet will know when he has an itchy butt, and will attempt to gain sympathy in the form of misbehavior in public (so when you have to scold or spank him, take him home or in the bathroom so he does not have an audience to continue to act for).<br>  <br>  All his life he will sap your wallet dry, demanding what he sees on the television, what his friends have, and why can't you be as cool has all his friends' parents?<br>  <br>  Oh wait, you probably like kids, so best advice I can give is make sure you are married with a college education and a good-paying job before you have kids so that you can afford to give them the best opportunity of a healthy, happy, and productive life.|`|qUr5P7hgaa	luv my  said it PERFECTLY.... Everyone knows it's true too so don't let them tell you otherwise lol.....<br>  but you still love you baby more than anything in the world!!!

The economy doesn't need to be supporting anymore children who's parents can't afford them....|`|af2136bcacd19dc5b2bab9b0737163c9aa	I had my daughter at 18, I'll be honest with you I had ALL DAY SICKNESS. I was always sleepy tired I weighed 95 pounds in my 5th month of pregnancy because i would throw up so much, I tore a vein in my throat from so much throwing up i would throw up blood, i couldnt drink even water! if i swallowed my saliva i would also throw up i would carry napkins with me and spit in them (gross i know) then later I started to get better I had really weird cravings but i had reallllly bad heartburn, i couldnt be in a house while someone was cooking bc i would throw up lol it was horrible later on in my pregnancy i got a kidney infection which i think was worse than actually pushing my daughter out. lol the baby doesnt let you sleep much how you are use to, you worry a lot about making sure your baby is ok you freak out about the smallest things going to the doctor so much becomes kind of annoying when you have to be at work and all that, you get stretch marks, you get so tired at the end of ur pregnancy you just want to pop the baby out already you're crabby because you just want ur body back! lol umm let me see what else in the actual labor I dont know i think it didnt hurt as bad as most girls say.. i dunno everyone is different though . my pregnancy was a hell ride and i said i didnt want anymore kids!!! but you know what my daughter is almost 3 now and let me tell you it was worth it and I want another one i dont care if i go through that hell again because it's sooo worth it watching your baby grow and seeing how much they change makes it all worth it seeing that he/she is part of you and someone you truely love.. of course its not just about u after u have the baby the baby comes first and when you get ready it takes u two times more to get ready bc its not just u anymore you have to change ur life style completely but its for the best good when they get sick u wish u were sick instead of them they cry complain scream throw up keep you up but like i said its worth it. luck and i hope you make the right choice.
1Kk9upluaa	It's perfectly normal to feel this way.  If you wait until you can afford to have a child, it will never happen, there will always be bills and such.delivery will be fine, painful-sure, but women have been doing it since the beginning of time.  As far as a healthy pregnancy, don't smoke, drink or use drugs (duh)  limit the caffeine and any unhealthy foods.  (not saying to stop completely, just cut back, a soda or cup of coffee every now and then won't hurt a thing)  Do however, stay away from shell fish and other sea food.  Relax and enjoy pregnancy, I felt better during those 9 months, than any other time in my life.|`|abb0f6a6801d1a40a3096d11694e5d6caa	Maybe you should see a therapist or talk to your husband about all your worries .

Hang in there and don't be overwhelmed. :-)|`|hAuemuWTaa	U r not alone, we all get worried and alone at times in our lives, but we all find a way through it. Talk to ur hubby, not us on yahoo, he is ur partner, and he should be there 4 u, to listen and support u, So wen u both get a Chance go and sit down with him and talk how u feel. <br>  You will be surprise tat he will come up with answers for every concern u have.<br>  It is natural to  worry alot wen we r pregnant, most of do it, and it called hormones. We worry cause we want the best 4 ourselves and our babies.<br>  U will have a healthy pregnancy if u eat right and take up all the info ur dr provides u and take it easy.<br>  I do understand that u will have concerns about the delivery as this is ur first baby, i cant lie to u and say it will be easy, but i can say there is alot of methods that u can do to mke things easy 4 u, to get u through the birth, and u will have ur hubby there and tat can mke a world of difference. Also there is alot of pain Relief opptions as well.<br>  If u find urself worring take a couple of deep breaths and take ur mind of it, by do something that u will enjoy.<br>  Tell urself that u r only human and u can only work on on problem at a time and with the help of hubby and other people u will find a way.<br>  If u have financial problems than sit out with hubby and work out a budget, cut out some things tat u both could do with out 4 a while. See how tat goes. All the best And congratulations!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|OEMIkJTUaa	I am also a worry wart like you, I just have to keep telling myself that everything happens for a reason and God has a greater plan.

Sorry to hear it|`|0hV7pTfXaa	While this is an awful situation for you to be in, I understand you not wanting to have an abortion but at your age I do not recommend keeping the baby. Its a responsibility you're not ready to take on.Look into adoption, there are so many great people who are ready for a baby but can not have one of their own. As for you, get some counseling sweetie, someone you trust and maybe even relate to. You can not go through this alone and the final decision has to come from you not your mom. However if you and your mom have a close relationship keep her filled in on how you're feeling and why you feel that way. You're still very young and will need guidence and support. Good luck honey|`|98296d939b6e1a4572c6ef2dbace636caa	From what I see your life is a living ****. You don't need this baby, it's not a toy. It's 18 years of live devoted to putting a child's before yours. Meaning you sleep 2nd, you eat 2nd, you play 2nd. The world isn't about YOU when you have a baby, it's about the BABY. Listen to your mother, she's had a child. She know how tiring, and how hard having one is. Have the abortion, you don't need another disaster ruining your life. You need to heal from all that you've been through. I would think after being raped you would despise sex entirely. You would hate the way it feels to be used. That's just my opinion. Have you even spoke to the police, social workers, or even the hospital? Being raped is a very serious crime and you should not take it lightly.|`|YT1FfANKaa	You don't have to have an abortion if you don't want one.  But living with your mother and her boyfriend is going to be trouble.  Try to find help by looking on the internet in your area for pregnant teens and maybe contact DCYF (Department of Children, Youth & Families)or some kind of help with the rapes and pregnancy.  You have been threw a lot and it is hard to keep your thoughts strait.  First get help for your self the baby wont be here for a few months.  <br>  <br>  PS Your Mom can not make you get an abortion.  At the abortion clinic they will take you aside and ask you if you are being pressured into the abortion.  Here you can say yes you are if it gets that far.<br>  <br>  Good luck and god bless|`|3w7VztEWaa	first off call the police.<br>  Im not playing this is serious<br>  second put this man in jail.<br>  thirdly stay with someone else if you think your mom would do something to prevent this baby from comming.<br>  forth think about what you want.<br>  nothing except you and your baby matters now.<br>  ok<br>  please please.|`|JNDrlLjMaa	I think that YOU should do what's best for YOU it's YOUR baby, no one elses.

I would suggest giving the baby up for adoption.  There are many people who want kids, but for whatever reason there body doesn't let them have them.  You may be able to find a couple who still let you see your child while he/she is growing up.  That will let you still get yourself together finish school and not have to worry about taking someone's life. <br>  <br>  Best of Luck|`|9Ourr7vbaa	DO NOT GET AN ABORTION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  do not do not!<br>  What did the baby do to you. I understand you're only 13 and you don't have the ability to care for the baby, so give it up for adoption. you get money for the adoption so that can help pay for the medical bills. There is lots of people that are looking for a baby, there is no reason for you to KILL an innocent baby because you realize thats what u r doing. <br>  Also tell the police about your mother's sick boyfriend so he can rot in jail :)|`|lBHLO2ADaa	It is YOUR choice... If you want to keep the baby you CAN. Although if it is your Mother's boyfriend who got you pregnant, that could cause some problems down the road... Are you planning on considering adoption? I think your best bet is to talk to a school counsler. Does your Mom know he has raped you? I think it's important you let her know asap. I am so sorry you had to go through this. Next time your moms boyfriend takes advantage of you, CALL 911 right away!!!  Don't be scared to call. I hope everything goes okay sweetie.|`|LT87YyESaa	Wow it seems you really need to turn the rapist guy in to the police first off. I think that abortion is a viable option if you were raped, but definetly get that a**hole turned in!!! At 13, it would be next to impossible to raise a kid because I am guessing that you don't have too much money. If possible, do adoption. But abortion mauy be the correct choice too.|`|MSfC0FXvaa	ok. for everyone who is saying get an abortion... umm NO! its a living thing! it could have a great life. you never know. it breathes. so please please please DONT get an abortion. it wasnt incest. but... you need to put him in prison. like NOW! go tell. call the cops. now now now. and... just explain to your mom you want to keep the baby, with or without her help. im sure you have other family that will help. im so sorry. get some therapist sessions in too. that will help you a lot.<br>  <br>  in the end tho, :) when you see your baby... you will be happy you didnt get an abortion. at least give your baby a chance.|`|oJ5pZQAiaa	Honey, Im so sorry. Your mom's boyfriend should go to jail! I'm 15 and fourteen weeks pregnant, so I kinda know how you feel. If I were you I would talk to your mom about adoption. This way you don't have to keep the baby and you wouldn't have to have it aborted either.|`|zTnR2ZFeaa	you need to talk to either the police, social worker, trusted teacher, doctor, an adult that you trust as what your mothers boyfriend is very wrong and get help from there. as they will be able to discuss your options with you and ensure that it doesnt keep happening.
2a2c24fc81bc910e984828a1ab26fd3daa	This is to elaborate a bit on the first response.  Do you know if there is an option of you getting what they call a cerclage, which is a purse like stitch, to keep your cervix closed.  I would think the main concern for your doctor right now is to make sure your water does not break and keep the baby in there as long as possible.  This is from experience dealing with this.  With my daughter, I had to have a cerclage put in due to a torn cervix, which is from a previous pregnancy that ended in a stillbirth.  I was on bedrest from 22 weeks on with that pregnancy, but they did not find the tear until I was 27 weeks, and at 28 weeks, they put a cerclage in my cervix to keep it closed.  There is a risk of the surgery that it could break your water if you contract during the procedure, but your doctor would try to prevent that from happening with medication before your actual procedure.  I was put on magnesium sulfate for 12 hours before my procedure to try to prevent me from contracting, which did its job.  My stitch popped at 31 weeks, and I was put in the hospital for the remainder of my pregnancy, because they did not want to risk redoing the stitch.  I do wish you the best of luck and you and your baby will be in my thoughts and prayers.|`|7add460ae24c9452ae87b5a99c5aa756aa	I dont know a ton about this...but that doesnt sound good at all.  The fact that she is shoving her fingertips in your uterus, and feeling the babies head...well, to me thats not good.  Its a hella good way to cause infection!<br>  Other things I have heard of, are women getting a stitch put in in order to help keep the cervix closed?  Maybe someone else can elaborate on this.  I might be checking for a new doc if I were you.

I know how you feel. When I was younger people came up to me in the street and told me I was ugly. People would come up to me at school and ask if I was a boy or a girl. <br>  <br>  Ok, so your face looks manly, or rather, you think it does. You've tried make up, and you still feel the same. What is it about your friend that everyone thinks is beautiful? As you say, you know that she has imperfections, because NO ONE is perfect, and NO ONE likes everything about the way they look. Look at yourself in the mirror. I mean REALLY look. I know it's difficult to do, I still struggle to do it sometimes. Is there even just one feature that you like, or even that you think is less bad than the rest? Maybe you have nice eyes, or good skin. Make the most of that one feature. Wear something that shows off the colour of your eyes, or ask a friend or female relative for some help with make-up to show it off.<br>  <br>  Even if as you say, your face looks manly, it's not all about your face. You have a body too. Wear clothes that you think look good on you, and make you feel good about yourself. Wear things that you like, don't worry about if they're from a particular shop or if anyone else is wearing them or not. Are you genuinely overweight, or do you just feel as though you're fat? Talk to a teacher, or an older female friend or relative; if you are overweight then a doctor will be able to suggest some changes to your diet that will help you to lose weight without it being dangerous to your health. However, bodies and faces do change as you get older. I was never really overweight, but as a child and young teenager I was always a little on the chubby side. As soon as I hit my late teens that all just disappeared of its own accord, I slimmed out, developed curves. <br>  <br>  You asked how you can be beautiful. You already are, you just need to realise it. You know what, I still occasionally have people come up to me and tell me that I'm ugly. When I was younger, it reduced me to tears, made me consider ending it all. Now, I can laugh it off. I have a great boyfriend, who loves me just as I am, and you know what, them telling me that I'm ugly doesn't make them any prettier. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.<br>  x|`|RAgWVuu4aa	I know how that feels...It's good to complain and let your emotions out, but get help...Complaining and not acting means nothing...It just makes it worse.<br>  <br>  <br>  Besides, everyone has potential...Get new clothes, a little make-up, a haircut, whatever...<br>  <br>  <br>  *EDIT* I used to look all around manly, too...In middle school, I was asked/shouted at on three or four occasions as to whether I was a girl or guy...Seriously...It all had to do with my eyebrows and clothes...I still have some slightly manly facial features, but I look like a girl...I've been called hot once and genuinely attractive once...Both times by a guy (two separate guys) about my age who had no idea I have self-esteem problems...Well, maybe they could tell by my body language, but they actually meant it...<br>  <br>  Do you have any anxiety disorders or problems?

p68DUZhCaa	i agree with you. people who respond negatively to abortion are obviously not in the position of the mother in question. kids who are adopted spend their lives looking for there biological parents and most of the time the behavior becomes destructive. the mother should be able to have choices, of course a mother trying to conceive but cant is going to be outraged at abortion, but its no ones fault that you cant have children. let these women have choices other than judging and go adopt another child.<br>  <br>  you have every right to post a question wherever you would like. we are not here to try to please everybody with the questions we ask. if you don't like the topic then simply answer another question.|`|gPg7qYGIaa	it not that simple the parents still have to give the kid over to be adopted even if they been in foster care for 10 year also alot of kids in foster care have problems and are not going to be happy about being adopted as they fell there rightful place is with there mum|`|7qt4aQGYaa	that's true, but abortion ends a living creature's life. according to science, life begins at conception, not birth. so when you remove the young child, you take it's life away.|`|XGgPhaDbaa	Maybe they say it because they would rather the child be put up for adoption than murdered.|`|oebqzgNraa	i agree. those people dont really think before they say that. but they should. because thats a good point|`|Oo3PC1yQaa	People give their babies up for adoption because they don't want an innocent creature to be killed for selfish means.

paCHaDWVaa	I had the mirena for 2 years after I had my son, I also have an older daughter. My doctor told me nothing but good things about that thing so I got it. I have had perfect skin my whole life and about 6 months after getting it my skin started breaking out, i started getting migraines, it made my periods about 2-3 wks long and it made me gain weight, not to mention it made me not want to have sex. I loved it at first then it turned into a nightmare. I hope you have better luck than I did, But I have also heard from people that they had it then had it removed and were unlucky when it came to having kids. A lot of OBGYN's will tell you that it is a harsh form of birth control. I had it removed several months ago and had my tubes burned,  I am so much happier. And you also have to remember that when something seems so good there is usually a down side to it. Good luck to you.<br>  <br>  Just wanted to add that I agree with army wife....I know several people that have gotten pregnant with an IUD, and the only reason my doctor allowed me to get it was because I have 2 children and I was married.|`|OZrdXQMyaa	There is probably a small possibility. If I were you I would have gone with the depo provera which is a quarterly injection. (every 3 months).|`|la8W09sFaa	first, just because you have had mirena implanted does not mean you are in the clear from getting pregnant, because abstinance is the only 100% effective method of ensuring that. second, depending on how long you use birth control it can possibly delay your ovulation process when you are ready to have children, because birth control is basically hormones that prevent ovulation. i stopped birthcontrol a few years ago, and i have just started ovulating again on my own in december 08. i do not think u will be sterile. when you get older if you are unable to concieve after 1 year of trying with the same partner, there are doc, who specialize in it so don't worry about that. good luck.|`|NGNeT3rYaa	I can't believe that your doctor would recommend this at 16!!!! See another doctor for one. Two, you should have had at least one child before this type of birth control and you must be in a stable, monogamous relationship. No multiple partners.|`|9hrJfhIIaa	And this is why you research the crap out of something before a doctor does any procedure....<br>  <br>  My doc told me that an IUD would be ideal after having a baby.
OPloDbxvaa	my son started cereal a week before he turned 4 months he was and still is on barley cereal the rice cereal would make him constipated too much , and now at 5 months he's eating soids for lunch an dinner , and cereal morning and night . we  started him because he was drinking 7oz every 2 hours but sleeping 10 hours a night , but now he drink 3-4 oz with each meal and a bottle of apple juice between lunch and dinner 2-3oz ... and the dr. told me it was good the juice helps him poop everyday..lol|`|FXINmF6saa	I started my son on solids at 4 months with baby Gerber. Then at about 6 months I started normal people food because I got tired of having to buy more cans of formula because he was going through 10 cans in less then a month. I just decided solid food would fill him up and he wouldn't take that much formula. I was right he stopped drinking so much formula and by 7 months he was eating like a big boy he didn't even want baby food anymore he wanted big people food now he's 1 and he is quite an great eater. I really think there's nothing wrong with getting her started now so she can get a taste of what's coming. That will help her system recognize food and get use to it.  Good luck! ; )|`|phgfj3F1aa	Well, doctors used to say no sooner than 6 months because anything sooner than that could "cause" allergies.<br>  <br>  Now, they're saying introducing foods sooner could prevent allergies.<br>  <br>  But, I wouldn't recommend giving a three and a half month old solid food. I'd say no sooner than 5 months. And that would be pushing it for me.|`|mgrI7tFEaa	i startd my son of when he was just 3 months as he was a very hungrey baby and he loved it start him of on baby rice 1st tho|`|J4hReID1aa	Check her/his mouth for teeth.

Very common at this age. Give him a few days and if you are still concerned, take him to your GP or child health nurse.|`|clc6qQDAaa	4 - 6 months is the ideal time to start him on stage 1 foods.
W1p6LetFaa	Yes, the 2 weeks before you got pregnant are already factored in there, don't worry!  You will be 40 weeks pregnant on April 19th (even though baby is only 38 weeks from conception).  No, they will not let you go 4 weeks past your due date because that would put you at 44 weeks pregnant.  <br>  <br>  Your doctor will not let you go more than 42 weeks (although different doctors are different), which will be only 2 weeks past your due date.  My doctor personally will not let me go 10 days past my due date (Today, Feb 23), so I will be induced on March 5 if my stubborn little girl refuses to budge.  This means I will be induced at 41 1/2 weeks.  I hope that helps to clarify a bit!|`|n8vBnA9Iaa	No, at 40 weeks, the baby is 38 weeks gestation. So if you went to 42 weeks, the baby would be 40 weeks gestation. The baby is always 2 weeks behind. I am 7 weeks pregnant but my baby is only 5 weeks.<br>  <br>  I only got induced with my 1st one in the hospital. My doctor never told me that she was going to induce me, they did it after my water broke. And I would never do it again. It was a complete nightmare. You do not want to be induced. You may end up having a c section. Let yourself fo into labor. I'm really serious about that.<br>  <br>  They were going to induce me for my 2nd, if I went to 42 weeks. Thank god he was only 5 days late. And I was not induced at all. Thank god for that. He was born in 4 hours, VBAC.|`|AA11315423	40 weeks is a FULL TERM Pregnancy. If you go into labor at 38 weeks, the drs will not try to stop it, baby will be ok. Baby will be even better at 40. They usually induce you about 10 days or 2 weeks after your due date. Baby could get too big or complications can occur after that, not to mention you will be super uncomfortable!
4fded85bb017fba5407e3727176079ffaa	It is.  If you can stand the pain.  It won't cause the baby to come.<br>  <br>  Try having your legs and bikini waxed though.  After that, labor and birth will be a breeze! lol|`|qH1YcQ2kaa	i read somewhere that waxing is more painful during pregnancy because your body is producing more blood than usual. when you wax, all your blood rushes to the surface. since there is more blood than usual it makes your skin more sensitive... or something like that lol. i wouldn't do it if i were you. just shave, thats what i did.|`|7rIAd6gGaa	Sure. There's no harm in waxing. I'll be 35 weeks now, and I'm starting to have a hard time shaving my legs. It's doable though. I shaved them until the end with my daughter. The bikini area is a different story though... LOL. With my first, I actually had my husband trim me up before going into labor. I just couldn't see to do it myself!! :)|`|xypA3yZMaa	I heard from a doctor that it is ok to shave, wax, or pluck.|`|KfGa8Hdiaa	wax is fine...just got waxed a few days back at 25 weeks...i don't like to shave...i usually get waxed...but i would guess it would be hard to shave in the 3rd trimester...and probably unsafe too if you are doing it in a slippery bath...|`|xWkf8jxkaa	You probably can wax but that is probably not wise and depending on how big you get you might be able to shave your legs.|`|264738e6736a5605fe53df0659003e3eaa	I could still shave my legs up till the end of pregnancy, but it was more effort than it was worth.  I did shave before I went to the hospital though.  Waxing is fine...wax away!|`|52U22fiAaa	Yes, it's ok!  And, you can shave your legs if you are flexible or get creative.  My hubby shaves mine for me now.
sbeoF50gaa	Yes you can. You can also visit them regularly for free. THey off the "womens health program" they give you a form to fill out and if you qualify (and I haven't met anyone who didn't) your visits are free. It's through medicaid, but only covers your visits to your OB. They can give you free birth control, free tests (pregnancy and std etc), and free exams. But from what I understand not ALL planned parenthoods have this program, so call and ask before you go down there. We have two here, one accepts it and the other doesn't. Not sure why this is.|`|qH1YcQ2kaa	probably<br>  you can also get the at the dollar store for $1
423983e632cb60a59de566f2b6c70711aa	Toughy. Miranda, it's less common than Bridget.|`|SxPhldhhaa	I'd have to choose Miranda over Bridget. I love both names, as they're both very pretty, but what sold me on Miranda was its sweet and feminine sound and its nickname possibilities.<br>  <br>  I love the name Miranda because it sounds beautiful and sweet, and a feminine-sounding name. I also like how it has many nickname possibilites that fit all ages and all personalities - Randi, Mandy, Mira, Mia, Mimi, Andi, Mindy, Randa, and so on. It's also very pretty left alone, as it just has a very lovely and elegant feel to it.<br>  <br>  Bridget is just as cute and certainly is a very pretty name, but it does sound a little harsher and less feminine than Miranda does. Also, the meaning of Miranda ("admirable") appeals to me more than does the meaning of Bridget ("lofty"). But Miranda Bridget is an interesting combination, actually - I might toy with that one for a while!|`|UpRdvpmXaa	Miranda. My sister has a three year old Miranda and it sounds cute when she calls her My Miranda.|`|Oliq3ZDnaa	Both are great, try flipping a coin, or even Miranda Bridget.|`|qqiVKUBpaa	Miranda|`|pDrdCRQcaa	Miranda for sure.

It's perfectly nice and respectable, but I just don't like it. I also don't find any of the nicknames particularly appealing, so that's another put-off for me.<br>  <br>  I do like Bridget very much, though. It's feminine but strong, unpretentious, and no-frills. Many consider it to be an ugly name, but I put it in the same category as Ingrid and Imogen -- harsh and "ugly", but also feminine with a fluid sound. It's Irish, which lends it an air of sophistication, but the name's enduring popularity gives it familiarity as well. It's definitely a winner!|`|LDiBjNf5aa	I like Miranda, because of the nicknames you can take from it. Miri, Mindy, Manda, Mandy, etc.|`|C4s77P8oaa	Miranda -- it sounds less harsh and more feminine.|`|yNV2kRlbaa	I like Bridget, but I would spell it: Bridgette<br>  <br>  I think it makes it prettier|`|cHrTF5kBaa	Bridget.

phgfj3F1aa	My husband and I just had a baby 2 months ago. I was working up until I was put on bed rest at 8 months. Now, I'm a full-time mom.<br>  <br>  We're doing quite well with under $30,000 a year. Buying diapers when they're on sale is a good idea, but you don't know how big your baby is going to be, nor how fast he's going to grow out of them, so don't stock up too much. Baby showers are great! Ask for gift certificates, if possible. That way, you can use them when you need them, instead of having 400 outfits that your baby will grow out of before he even has a chance to wear them. <br>  <br>  Find out in advance how much your insurance is going to pay for. Deliveries are not cheap, and neither is the hospital stay afterward. Just one of my ultrasounds cost $700. <br>  <br>  Don't be ashamed to take advantage of any help your state has to offer. That's why WIC is there. I don't know what state you live in, so I don't know what programs are available to you. Here, we have Right from the Start, which helped an enormous amount. <br>  <br>  When buying a crib, see if you can get one that converts into a toddler bed and a twin size bed as your child gets older. Same goes for car seats. If you want a stroller, look into getting one that comes with a convertible car seat, If you take care of it, it can last until your child doesn't need a car seat anymore. <br>  <br>  And, finally, hand-me-downs. If you know someone who has any of these things, and doesn't need them, anymore, see if they'll lend or give them to you! A lot of the times, they'll just want them out of the house! Always make sure they're up to current safety regulations!<br>  <br>  Congratulations!|`|1MEnCmwoaa	Make sure to have a baby shower to get most of the stuff you need. You can also buy used furniture (craigslist is great for this)<br>  If you are staying home then breastfeeding will save you a lot of money plus it is great for baby. formula is soooo expensive. The other big expense is diapers and wipes. <br>  While you are pregnant and still working save as much as you can! Try and put away half of your check into a savings account so you can start to get used to having less money a month without having the actual stress of no check and a baby. Then you will be saving each week also. <br>  And most people buy way too many clothes for a baby! I have so many clothes my daughter never wore or wore only once. So don't go crazy on buying clothes. Also, see if friends or family have any hand me downs. <br>  It will all work out :)|`|G35ERUifaa	First, congrats!  Second, start living on his salary right now.  Put your paycheck in savings.  You want to practice living without your paycheck and see how you fare, while at the same time starting a cushion for both of you.  Cut out misc expenses like coffee at the coffee shop, dinners out, take out, etc.  Brown bag it for lunch.  Clip coupons.  Buy generic.  Shop sales circulars.  Shop at thrift stores for baby clothes.<br>  <br>  If you are having trouble making ends meet on his salary alone, consider a part time job that allows you to work when he can be home with the baby.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|9ZaoTkwwaa	Where do you live?  Where i live that would be plenty of money so i don't understand the problem.  Maybe you could work from home babysitting for someone else, so you could raise your child and theirs.  How much are your bills?  Where do you live?  Could you downsize your house, car payment...?  Or could he get a job somewhere else?  My husband is working offshore and makes pretty decent money- but he was making less than $45,000 when he started.  If you let me know this stuff (email me) i may be able to help but its hard to give advice not knowing any of it.|`|bHAlwhTBaa	You have some good advice her.  One other possibility is to work in the evening while he is home with baby.  Good  Luck.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	just start now, either buying a few things here and there or taking extra money and putting it in a piggy bank in baby's room so it's not tempting to use it for something else; my mom raised 3 kids on about that so u can do it....regardless you will find a way; buy your carseat, crib new and the rest look for on craigslist and secondhand shops, you can find great things that have been worn once or not at all bc of moms like me who had way to much for her to wear before she outgrew them; also try freecycle, that's what i am gonna do for a lot of her clothes, bigger stuff  i am gonna put on craigslist; try a goodwill in a nice area of town too, salvation army;my mil is addicted to those places, its like a hobby and she is always finding stuff that still has the original tags...gl; wish i had known about those before i bought all new stuff for my dd to outgrow so fast...|`|da0bd1389f2c6ba2fe645d6d1c4be705aa	theres income tax<br>  baby shower<br>  and you can put 50 dollars back every month|`|iFmKcRl0aa	If you need to work to help your finances, you might consider telecommuting, which is just work from home. It's been a great option for our family, and I love getting to stay home with our little guy. <br>  <br>  Here's some more information about what telecommuting is and how to get started if you feel it's the right option for you.<br>  <br>  Your days might not be easy working and keeping a little one at home, but it can definitely be done!|`|1S7uXsInaa	While you are working, buy diapers whenever they are on sale.  Join the baby clubs online and you will start getting coupons for things like that.  I bought diapers with my last one when they were on sale, he is 11 months and I have not had to buy one package of diapers since he was born.  That saves a lot every month.|`|Q9qno7EVaa	My husband and I were in the same situation, 6mths married and 8k debt, but he earns less money than your husband. Our baby is now 2 1/2 months old and we're doing alright, making payments and all that. We paid out our debt as quick as possible it took practically the whole 9 months but we also bought most of the big baby items at the same time. First step is to sit down and work out a budget and a list of your essential baby items. There really are a lot of things for your baby that you can do without. Buy things 2nd hand where possible and look online and shop around for great deals. Also take any handouts that people are willing to give, I'm sure family and friends will want to help. As this moment I would not worry about a savings account, sort out your debt before anything else. Also to save on money with our little girl, I use cloth nappies at home and only use disposable when we go out, it's more money in the short term but in the long run I believe it works out cheaper, some days we don't even use any disposables. I also give my baby breastmilk rather than formula, formula is just an extra expense that I feel is not worth it when breastmilk it better for babies anyway and it's free so while I can produce it it's what my baby will get. We even struggled with breastfeeding so I express and my baby has it from a bottle, I don't have quite enough milk to feed her so she does get 1 bottle of formula a day but a whole tin lasts a month not a week or less. It's all about where you can cut costs, I'm sure there are heaps more ways you can cut down your costs too. And if you can find any job that you can do from home when your little one is 6mths or so then it's just a bit more money for you. Good luck with your pregnancy and I'm sure things will work out fine. Just don't stress out too much it's not good for you.|`|Od73sfkxaa	Research...research...research!!<br>  <br>  **You may qualify for medicaid. Look up your state's requirements for being eligible. $45, 000 is good for 1-2 people, but when you toss in a baby, the state may find that you are eligible for health insurance (we are).<br>  <br>  **Find a Sam's Club or BJ's to start buying your food, diapers (208 diapers for $28), formula, and much more. BJ's even has discounted gas!!<br>  <br>  **Start making a list of all of the things you need for a baby (crib, bassinet, changing table, car seat, high chair, stroller, etc) and when the time comes make a registry at a place like Wal-Mart and invite LOTS of people to your baby shower: friends, family, and his co-workers. Do not buy a thing until after your shower and everyone has already bought you items. There is no need to go crazy! Even though it's fun to go crazy hehe.<br>  <br>  **Are there miscellaneous items that you should cut back on? Instead of going to the movies or renting movies, try Netflix's (3 movies sent to your home, unlimited movies over the computer, you don't have to drive to return the movies, and there is no late fees!!) Just analyze where it is your money is going and figure out a way to cut it back.<br>  <br>  Research is the best way to spend part of your time =)<br>  <br>  I wish you the best of luck!! Keep in touch!!! I am hoping this month is our month too =)<br>  <br>  __<br>  <br>  We have a mortgage ($93k), a credit card ($7k), student loans ($15k), etc. Just learn to not spend money on stuff you don't need!! People say "oh our mom and dad raised us on this or that salary," but our parents did that 20-30 years ago, and the price of living was not as high as now.  8k debt is actually not that much, especially if you don't have a mortgage. If it's on a credit card, just make monthly payments, but the payments may need to be smaller than what they were before. You can do this!!

You would also need a changing pad, clean outfit (can't tell you home many times I had to change an outfit because of poop/pee/spit-up), burp cloth, binky (if you plan on using one at all), and more.|`|uj1A73ZGaa	I have three girls under two and yes I use a diaper bag. My oldest is almost fully potty trained so I just take an extra pair of clothes for her, a snack and a sippy cup. <br>  Than for my twins that are almost 3months old they are breast feed. I take diapers, wipes, extra clothes, pacifiers, and that's about it.|`|b6EyFLgUaa	I did when my child was younger, I dont now and shes 2. I toss a diaper and a few wipes in a plastic baggie and toss that in my purse. When she was younger I had everything under the sun crammed in that bag lol. Im sure ill do that with my next one as well.|`|TMZQ59kYaa	I use one that is small and will fit a few things. This way I am not toting around the entire house. This site has clutches. Love the bright colors and smaller bags.|`|tkkYIdIvaa	I always bring diapers, wipes, toys, blankets, bottles, and many more things.|`|KUxEBQuYaa	sometimes. it depends on how long i am goin to be gone from home. sometimes its a few diapers and wipes. sometimes the whole bag needs to be brought! lol.|`|gPg7qYGIaa	yes i do for the poo ones it not to bad till the start eating food then they really smell lol|`|WlU3NFu6aa	i do! I am a little anal so i carry meds too. when she was a  newborn she had horrible gas so i carried mylicon just in case we were out and she had pain. tehn she got a littel older and i carried tylenol and teething meds. now she's one and i have to pack a thermos with whole milk and her snacks. I drop her off at my grandma's on weekdays so i make sure she has a small medical case in there too. you know with the thermometer adn nail clippesr. i told you....anal. but i would rather have this stuff and not need it then need it and not have it|`|oXIYHsDaaa	you mean you'll carry<br>  several diapers<br>  wipes<br>  a few toys<br>  an extra set of clothes<br>  a changing pad (changing tables are yucky)<br>  soother (if using)<br>  extra soother (in case the first hits the floor)<br>  Diaper rash cream or Vaseline<br>  Lanolin cream (for your nipples during the first few weeks)<br>  Breast pads<br>  Burp cloth<br>  <br>  You might want a diaper bag, you can get some pretty nice ones, they don't have to be the huge teddy bear printed tote bag style, but the back pack ones are really nice. Once baby is older (around 18 months you can totally get away with tossing a couple of diapers in your purse but when they are little you end up needing a lot of stuff even if you are nursing.|`|ZSSUfSXwaa	You know you'll eventually need one. You can use a regular backpack if you like it better or a neutral tone diaper bag.<br>  Because you'll need more than just a few diapers...even if breastfeeding.. <br>  you need a change mat, to change your baby while out, diapers, wipes,an outfit or two, babies tend to soil their outfits or spit up too many times to count! .. .Plus a blankiefor your baby, a covering balnket to cover you while breastfeeding, toys... etc<br>  <br>  I never quite liked the regular diaper bags.. because they're childish-I have no problem with Winnie the Pooh as long as I dont have to carry a backpack with its picture on the back LOL  <br>  So I got a blue one and now with two children on the go a backpack is much more practical and roomier :)<br>  But yes you will need one...|`|5WP9rLTlaa	have a look at the options available, my baby hasn't arrived yet but I just purchased a stunning red leather one thats identical to a handag I've been eyeing off for months now. It was under half the price of the handbag and it has a matching changemat, wet bag, insulated bottle holder and a purse for me!<br>  My mum liked it so much shes gone out and bought the black one for herself to use as a handbag, she loves it cause its big enough to hold her laptop and all her office equipment.|`|k9VvIG3gaa	YES!<br>  with twins, its hard not too<br>  I have a huge one lol<br>  <br>  Trust me. with a newborn, you wont be able to put the all the things ur baby will need in ur purse..|`|lzivF4Idaa	sounds like a good concept, but you'll most likely be carting around more than that with a newborn.
IU4uNH97aa	I like for a girls middle name but prefer it as a boys first name spelt Layton. But its cute , easy to pronounce unique but not totally different. I bet its going to be a new trend in a couple of years so it's not really for me.|`|XzV4bUeFaa	Not really.  Maybe as a middle.|`|mRQxlNH5aa	Very pretty and becoming much more common for girls.|`|JGpirCtLaa	I really like this, but when I first saw it I thought it was Lee-ton, because Leigh is pronounced Lee...so it may be confusing, but it does look like Lay-ton too. So no matter how it's pronounced, I'm sure people will have trouble. <br>  <br>  But I really like it :)|`|u7UnUZXnaa	adorable!|`|KOcCenrEaa	no I don't.|`|cErLq7f3aa	yep|`|DCJAMtkHaa	I prefer Lleyton (pronounced the same as Leighton) and on males.

264738e6736a5605fe53df0659003e3eaa	Mostly just covering your face and then going BOO or Peek a Boo.  You just have to be really animated with your expressions. Also try buying a new feather duster, then tickle his/her face with it.  Try stuffed animals and making silly sounds and all that.  Sometimes it helps to have mommy or daddy stand behind you and have them try to get the baby to smile, cause the baby knows them :)  Good Luck|`|n6XYYyoLaa	well, a lot of it will depend in the baby's mood; we have went for pro pics and nothing the photographer did would keep my dd from crying, LOL....and me and dad were right there in the pic with her; she was six mos....just have a couple cute toys that squeak and such, and see if that will put the mood right, that's what they were trying, as well as talking to her in funny voices..|`|IGwX328eaa	Make lots of noises and use some of his toys or ask his parents to stand behind you and talk to him.|`|AA10742362	best would be to have parents stand behind u and have them help with that just watch the directions of his eyes.  like if your standing up make sure they arent kneeling in front of u because then in pics babys eyes will be looking down.  vice versa if u r kneeling and they r standing eyes will be looking up, etc|`|fmkwdNJyaa	put a toy that the baby likes in front (directly across from them and dangle it around) of them or anything that they really like or do something really funny or show them a giant colorful lolipop<br>  <br>  toys w/ noise or nice songs/sounds are great|`|uLdeIhHqaa	Just take a stuffed animal/or toy duck and make funny sounds and move the animal/ or duck around...and make silly faces and say things like "Im gonna get you"!|`|yT29OZuvaa	I remember when I was little I was getting a professional family photograph. I was such a stubborn child and I refused to smile. The one taking the picture made really funny noises and used squeaky toys and animal balloons to keep me amused. So make sure you have some of those on hand. It worked, except the thing was, I didn't want to smile anyway. So it turned out that in the photo I had a crumpled smile, evidence that I wasn't trying to laugh...and failed. ;)<br>  <br>  You can also do the old Peek-A-Boo trick, too.|`|X8zRD86Vaa	we had my sons pictures done for xmas. he was 3 months old at the time. and to get him to smile, all we had to do was say poopie. lol. for sum reason that cracks him up

The style is Mama J. You can buy any kind and just have them hemmed; I'd suggest a designer jeans brand if you're not worried about price.

It's very comfortable.  Pea in the Pod and Mimi Maternity also have this, but they are very expensive.|`|MPIcqhTHaa	Try Motherhood Maternity. I am not sure whether they have petite sizes, I'm sure they do, but they have this really cool thing called secret belly fit. All of the pants, including jeans, that have this belly fit have a high waisted band that covers your baby belly and expands to fit you as you grow. They are great! They aren't cheap though, but very worth it if you find a pair or two that you like because you can wear them pretty much throughout your entire pregnancy. And also if it is extra support you are looking for, you can also consider a pregnancy belt. It's a belt that fits around the lower portion of your belly and it's designed to help hold your uterus up and give some support that will help ease backaches and ligament pain. You can find those pretty much at any maternity store or online. I know you can even order them on Target's online site. Finding clothes for petite women is difficult, I'm 5'6 and even my maternity pants are a little long for me. You may just have to settle for cuffing or redoing the hem in your pants if you can't find a petite size. You should definitely look into the secret belly fit pants though. They are the most comfortable pants I have ever worn! I hope all this helps.|`|ytE1q20taa	I just bought some normal jeans that are a size bigger (I'm size 8 so I bought size 10). You could maybe try doing that? I works for me. I was told by a few people that it's pointless buying maternity wear as I'd only be wearing them for such a short time, and by the time I have a second baby (if I have a second baby) I might not be the same size and would have to buy new maternity wear. The only maternity stuff I have bought is two nursing bras. You can also get this stretchy band thing that goes around your belly underneath your pants to add extra support, I haven't bought that either but I've heard it's very good.|`|BDnSmRE6aa	The only ones that I could find that fitted in the waist and were shorter were from New Look but I could only get the ones with the elasticated bit on the pockets. I gave up looking when I found those ones.
aMJfx44Daa	Seems like things that are not material might be a good idea for her.  A trip to the park, or a picnic?  Getting to stay up late?  Reading a story together?  Tea party with mom, dad, and dolls?  A game of whiffleball?  Getting to wear something she likes?  Baking cookies together?  "Helping" you build a bird feeder?<br>  <br>  You could also ask her for suggestions of rewards, and pick the ones that are reasonable.|`|b6EyFLgUaa	She should have the option to take the money that it costs to buy the item or meal or what ever and spend it then or save it for something bigger. Give her the money and put it in a clean bank. Make a list of things shed like to get, like the DS. Say she wins a dinner trip. She can either go out to Chinese or take the 35 dollars and put that in the bank for a later gift. Or spend part of it and what not. It teaches her how to save and how to spend.|`|f34d8af07990dc3e462c898fc5a7609faa	what about picking out a candy from the store like m&m's, skittles, etc.|`|AA10943329	why not reward her with pocket money?

sbeoF50gaa	I would get him tested for strep throat, if not treated it can turn into Rheumatic fever, scarlet fever... throwing up and diarrhea, runny nose, watery and itchy eyes, are all symptoms of strep throat. If he developes a rash he's got scarlet fever.<br>  <br>  Foods: stick to clear liquids, if she can keep that down move to crackers, if she can keep that down try apple sauce. Mild Mild foods :)|`|p8WE47xIaa	Her little belly is full of flem.  She has no way of getting it out.  She can't blow her nose.  So it runs down her throat and is sitting in her stomach.  So that is the reason she is throwing up.  To help her with the flem build up.  You need to get saline spray and a bulb syringe.  Squirt the saline in to her nose,count to ten.  Then use the syringe to suck out the flem.  Do one side at a time.  I think you need to take her to a doctor.  She has been sick for a week and she needs meds to help her get better.|`|GCSFnc4Haa	this happens to my one year old ever time he is almost thru cutting teeth<br>  doctors are gonna tell you KEEP HER HYDRATED pedia light water<br>  bland foods work great (toast plain oatmeal)<br>  dont fight with her to eat either!!! my son pukes if i force him to eat|`|sRy2SKpXaa	Yes, definitely! My 3 year old son is just getting over a nasty week long upper respiratory infection. He never actually threw up, but there has been a bunch of times when he started gagging from the mucus in his throat/nose, my poor guy. Don't try to force her to eat!! My son barely ate at all the past week. Here and there he ate what I cooked for dinner or a yogurt or ice pop. She'll probably lose her appetite from the illness, so don't force her and don't be afraid when she isn't eating that much. Try jello or ice pops. Things that will be easy on her little tummy. My son just started eating regular food a few days ago. Which was a slice of pizza. But now he's back to his normal routine of eating 3 meals a day. I hope this helped, seein as how I just literally went through this. Hope she feels better :)|`|YT1FfANKaa	Yes you can throw up when you get to much flem in your stomach.  I would go and get her to the doctor and they will be able to help you.  She has been sick for a week it is to long not to see a doctor.|`|1TrWuMOraa	Before I found out I had walking pneumonia, It started as a headache, fever, then throwing up, before the coughing and other symptoms arrived. so yes definitley.|`|2T9RXxNTaa	avoid any food till she stops being sick then introduce light foods (not fried, greasy or dairy foods) these may lay heavy on her stomach and curdle.
2674548b6a4c9cdbb098044c58c7af7aaa	Try acetaminophen(Tylenol) first.  I would wait until she's able to keep some type of food down before giving her ibuprofen.|`|f66ce5d864eadcad29348fd4a9871771aa	you can give her childrens tylenol or childrens motrin, either one will break the fever, just follow the dosage instructions very carefully.|`|W2YtVUqKaa	I wouldnt give her that, it might damage her stomach considering how she's already dealing trauma to it. stomach flus usually go away in a day or two anyways so just let her ride through it it will also strengthen her immune system to fight off viruses in teh future|`|FXPTeTcPaa	Ice pops and Popsicles are good for the stomach flu as is jello.<br>  <br>  I would not give her ibuprofen. You should get children's tylenol and give to her.  <br>  <br>  You should monitor her fever, if it goes above 102 or lasts for more than 2 days, you should really take her to the doctor.|`|YT1FfANKaa	I answered your other question and if your daughter is sick for a week you really should take her to a doctor.  Give her either tylenol or ibuprofen.  If you can't get the fever down take her to the hospital.|`|XSol0H6Uaa	why are some of you telling her not to give the baby ibuprofen but to give her motrin.  Motrin IS ibuprofen.<br>  <br>  If you don't know anything about the situation, don't give any advice.<br>  <br>  made you change your answers, huh?|`|58YiE4pFaa	nooo. do not give toddlers ibuprofen, it can end up seriously bad. what ibuprofen does is it forces down the fever. however by doing so it speeds up the heart rate. and for children who naturally have a rather fast heart rate, speeding it up could harm them. if the fever turns out reallly bad, call the doctor. he/she will tell you if you can give ibuprofen. but in the meantime try calming it down with lots of preferably hot/warm water, keep warm in bed, the basics. and if she has the stomach flu remember to keep her from eating any milk related products; cheese, yogurt, milk etc. when she eats, give her something plain and easy to take, like plain bread.|`|2T9RXxNTaa	this is only what i do for my children and im not telling you what to do, just a few pointers. plenty of fluids, im from england i don't know if you are in the us but i give calpol which is a paracetemol or nurofen which is ibuprofen, keep her cool, only have a thin blanket on, keep checking her temp and lots of sleep. if in doubt get her to a doctor. good luck hun, its tough i know. :)|`|5fKtkCBwaa	Im a teenager, but reseached it for you and it sounds ok to me check the link to make sure I'm correct I hope it helps.|`|Nh1ZZz89aa	If she is hot you can try to give it to her, but she may not keep it down. Is she keeping down the pedialite? If she is keeping it down then try it. See if you can add the whole dose to the pedialite. Also, yogurt may help her stomach if she can handle that. That may help coat her stomach just enough so that the medicine does not bother her. Good luck.
K2jT1z5jaa	since you had some symptoms it is definitely possible that its a sign. Also anytime you have sex - pregnancy may occur.Since your period is irregular i recommend that you test in about a week.

046668252b7d273d3a4a3a6908a8607daa	1) It's law in some countries for a new baby to go home in a car seat. Many hospitals will not discharge the baby leave unless you have one (even if you borrow on just to transport him home). It's safer to have a car seat. You should have a nurse liaison in the Baby Unit who will advise you if the baby is very small and may not fit in a normal car seat.<br>  <br>  2) They will usually give you a plan about feeding and how much he should be taking, on average. Plus you should have a health visitor come out weekly to start with and who will also be able to advise on feeding issue.<br>  <br>  3) Some babies will get apnoea monitors to keep an eye on them. Most will just go home and you would look out for him the same way you would a term baby (ie, keep an eye on him without getting obsessed!)<br>  <br>  4) He is probably better sleeping in a cot or moses' basket in your room for, at least, the first six to nine months. It will be easier for you to do feeds, you will be better able to keep an eye out for him and it will better for your peace of mind this way.<br>  <br>  5) He is probably best sleeping in a baby gro, with a vest underneath, and a wee hat, with a light sheet to cover him. Your house is probably warm enough. You don't want him to get too hot.<br>  <br>  6) You will hear him. It will be quieter in your house and he will be stronger by then.<br>  <br>  7) Hold him as much as you did your daughter. When I worked in SCUBU briefly, I was told by the neonatal nurses that the babies' mothers wouldn't thank me if I carried them around every single time they cried! Give him cuddles and the like but, just as with your daughter, don't hold him if you feel he is just having a wee moan before settling down to sleep.<br>  <br>  Don't worry too much. Most units are good in giving advice to parents and also have community teams to ensure you are getting on well when the baby goes home. He will also have regular clinic appointments where they will keep track of him and you have the chance to ask questions. You won't just be flung in the deep end!|`|8oAlBL91aa	My son was a month premature it's not really that big of a deal the only thing they did say that to make sure people who touch him are very clean. He had a problem holding his hear as well, at one month he came done with RSV (respiratory virus) they said it was on a count of him being preemie he was in the hospital for 2 months, we almost lost him. With any new born you can't take your eyes off them it's like your so worried about everything anyhow. Just take any and all advice the hospital gives you and I'm sure everything will be alright. See ya later.|`|GR07LyyTaa	my daughter was a premie.. i kept her in a bassinet right next to my bed with a light on her so i could see her at night and i would wake up to make sure she was breathing... they made me get a special car seat in order to take her home because she didn't pass some car seat test.. and we had to keep her swaddled in 2-3 blankets all day and night because she couldn't hold her temp. and she also fed about every 2-4 hours..|`|tkkYIdIvaa	I know about all this stuff. My first son was three days late.

Ask away.<br>  Well when my son came home with me he was 3lbs. 15oz. I had him in the car seat because it was too cold outside but I don't see why you can't carry him. Your baby well be fine you don't have to stare at him every single second. Just be sure to have everybody that wants to touch him wash there hands well.|`|oXIYHsDaaa	you need to have him in a car seat in the car, you may need to get a special one that is suited for preemies<br>  <br>  If you can afford it the angel care motion sensitive monitor is great for piece of mind, it sets off an alarm if it doesn't register your baby breathing for more than 20 seconds (I love mine so much)<br>  <br>  At night you will probably need to swaddle him in a warm blanket or use a sleep sac and keep the room at about 20 degrees C, the hospital can give you specific instructions based on how well he is regulating his body temp.<br>  <br>  Use a baby monitor to make sure you hear him cry or move his crib or bassinet into your room<br>  <br>  He should be held as much as possible, using a baby carrier, sling or wrap that the hospital has approved for his use. "Kangaroo Care" is wearing baby in a wrap or carrier against your skin. It helps to regulate his temperature and breathing and can do wonders for preemies.
AA11071252	I had three c-sections, all quite a bit different and improving due to techniques as I had them.  I'm also a nurse, so I have experience from both sides.  Take care of yourself first.  Don't overdue.  Lie down to rest when you are tired.  Eat a good diet and avoid alcohol until you are off pain meds, recovered, and back to "normal". <br>  <br>  You should have received discharge instructions when you left the hospital. Read them.  They should contain the answers to any of these questions or a number you can call to get your physicians advice.  Please don't hesitate to call them if you need your questions answered.  Usually the advice is to wait 2 weeks to drive after most "normal" c-sections, but check the instructions you were given.  Also, after any delivery, they usually advise you to wait for intercourse until 4 weeks, or as long after that as you feel comfortable.   The 4 week wait is to avoid the potential for uterine infection as much or more than to avoid the discomfort.  <br>  <br>  I learned that whenever you are on narcotics or any meds that can alter your judgment, you are an insurance risk if you choose to drive and have an accident while under the influence.  Your company has an excuse to get out of coverage if they can prove this.  Thought that was important to share.  It's kind of like...." do you feel lucky?"  I'd advise against it.|`|UkQuMykiaa	I have just been taking it easy.  My husband has been doing all of the house work.  My twins are 4 weeks old today.  I drove today, but I do not think I am really supposed to be, I think you are supposed to wait until you at least go back to the dr's.  I had staples for my incision and they were removed 1 week after my c-section.  I have been doing housework yesterday and today - again probably not advisable, but I feel bad just sitting around holding the babies all day. This is my first c-section and I have been feeling a lot better the last week so I have definitely been doing more. If you have any questions I would not hesitate to call your dr., they will tell you for sure.|`|cCL5vUgCaa	I had an emergency c-section after 17 hours of labor.  I had my surgery on Tuesday night, went home on Saturday, and I was (gingerly)shopping at Target with my sister in law on Sunday for nursing bras. The first couple days after the surgery were very painful but I recovered quickly.  Different people have different experiences.  I was told to do what I felt comfortable doing, when I was comfortable doing it.  The couple rules were no driving for 2 week, no sex for 6 weeks. I had disolvable stitches with derma-bond.|`|vewYW4wcaa	I was told not to drive for 6-8 weeks, cuz if even you have to hit the brakes, the lap belt is right on that incision line, and could really caouse some internal bleeding.. <br>  <br>  Ask if one of your mothers or friends would come over and stay with you while your husband works, its so nice to have even a little bit of help getting everyday chores done!|`|X8zRD86Vaa	i didnt have stitches on the outside. they used a glue[[is what i was told]] and dissolveable stitches on the inside. i also had a t shaped incision on my uterus cuz my son was stuck and didnt want to come out. <br>  <br>  i couldnt drive a while cuz it just hurt to much to bend over. and my hubby helped me with a lot!! and i definately needed the pain meds specially if we were going in the car. the slightest bump made me cringe in pain<br>  <br>  dont worry it all gets better in time though|`|K78hBIOkaa	I had an emergency c section after a failed induction that lasted 24 hours.  Had my daughter on a Friday and was home on Tuesday.  Staples out the following Friday (one week after delivery)  She is a little over two weeks old now and I still have moments where I know I have done too much, like the other posters have said, your body will tell you if you have done or are doing too much.. listen to it before you are in serious pain.  I was told no driving or sex for six weeks and did both at the two week mark.  Driving was no problem, and sex was a little uncomfortable at first, but I think mainly becuase it had been so long.  We were just very gentle, and it didn't hurt at all.  But again, everyone is different, so listen to your body!|`|VRgq1NV6aa	you shouldn't drive until you are no longer on any pain medications.<br>  <br>  Just keep the area dry... after you shower, make sure you dry the area thoroughly by patting. I used a blow dryer (VERY CAREFULLY ON LOW SETTING) to help.<br>  <br>  Don't vacuum.|`|siDcjgJCaa	Dont drive until you are off any pain meds and the stitches have come out.. I waited about 3 weeks... until I was ok with any sudden movements if need be.. <br>  <br>  For yourself.. just rest, take it slow, dont life anything heavier than your baby, relax as much as possible.. stay hydrated, and make sure you eat..|`|aJLx0nhNaa	I didn't have any stitches that needed to be removed.  Mine were the kind that dissolved.<br>  <br>  Basically, my advice is not for now, it's for 6 weeks or so from now.  Right now your body is telling you to take it easy and you are, as much as you are able.  But a time will come, in a month or two, when you will start to feel fine.  So you'll want to do something that you haven't - lift something heavy, go for a long walk, whatever.  And then you'll have pain again.<br>  <br>  So my advice is, once you start feeling totally fine and stop bleeding, give yourself another month.  Or you'll be on the phone to the doctor, admitting that you helped your husband move the sleeper couch. ;)|`|lGcpXteaaa	I didnt really think driving was an issue. I mean your only sitting down or am i missing a major point? lol<br>  <br>  Ugh..the recovery was so hard for me, i hated it! I just found the best advice was not to overdo it. I felt really good on my 5th day so i got up and did a load of housework, the rest of the day i was back in bed in *serious* pain! <br>  Listen to your body, if your tired make sure you rest. Oh and just wash the stitches regularly with warm water and soap. And accept every bit of help you get.<br>  No need to be proud while your recovering!! I had NO dignity whatsoever...it even went as far as my boyfriend changing my bloody absorbant blankets....ugh...i am surprised he still finds me beautiful!! lol<br>  <br>  Sex should be after 6 weeks. Especially if its rough!!|`|aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	My first child was born by cesarean, and when we first attempted sex (close to the six weeks) it was painful and we were not doing anything rough.  It was some time before I even thought about sex again after that.<br>  <br>  I think you are not supposed to drive for 6-8 weeks following surgery.<br>  <br>  Wear a pad sideways, inside your panties to cover the cesarean incision.  It will catch any drainage and also act as a pillow of comfort.<br>  <br>  There are other things besides sex that can cause problems, also.  My third was another cesarean delivery, and sweeping and vaccuming was really painful during my recovery.  I tried it once and then had others do that until I was recovered.|`|43a27c0e1eef30eef2164c4c15242ab3aa	I had to wait 6 weeks to drive.  My recovery was awesome, I never once took any pain medications.  Dont get me wrong I was sore but nothing horrible at all.  I had my daughter at night and was walking around the next morning and feeling good.  I had my stitches removed a week later and everything healed well.|`|iFmKcRl0aa	You just have to listen to your body. <br>  <br>  I think I was driving after about 10-12 days and I didn't have any trouble. I took my time with lifting and pushing motions, however, because I tried to vacuum too soon after getting home and thought I was going to split open.  With sex, I waited for about 6-7 weeks. For me, I was just feeling a little uncomfortable, so my husband and I took our time there.|`|HvALvdc7aa	I could drive 4 weeks after my c section. I had the c section from hell. If you have anything oozing from the incision go to your dr. Don't wait. I waited and next thing I know its infected, has blood clots, a seroma, and a cyst inside the incision. Im 12 weeks ppd and the thing STILL oozes. Good Luck and take care.

It could also be that he doesn't want to believe the baby is his. <br>  <br>  What harm would it do to have the test? It is rather painless for the little one.

But I would make sure that he pays for it if he really wants to get it done.|`|SFNjVMR0aa	I think you should do it to shut him up otherwise that can become a major problem. if he leaves you and you request child support they will ask him if he wants a test he will say yes then you will have to anyway. make him pay for it|`|j7enSIr5aa	call Maury he can help--|`|IFDfpbFJaa	I would let him have his paternity test and when you're right tell him that you can't be with someone who doesn't trust you and that it's not going to work out.......cut your losses. don't even deal with the drama....unless you have something to hide just do it and get it over with or he's going to bother you about it forever....|`|2ObqoJbKaa	You can deny it, unless he took it to court, then I think you would have to do it. Also, you don't have to be 18 to do a paternity test, as long as you have a parents permission.

gyYXV3Bxaa	No, I never feel like I am judged because I used formula.  Do you mean MY personal doctor?  Or the baby's doctor?<br>  <br>  My doctor knows my medical history, so she knows that I was unable to continue breastfeeding.  My baby's doctor doesn't know my medical history.  She just asked, "Are you still breastfeeding?"  I answered "No".  She only asked because she wanted to make sure my daughter was getting enough formula.  <br>  <br>  Come to think of it, outside of yahoo answers, I've never heard one single negative comment about using formula.  <br>  <br>  I know this is off the topic, but I used to be a member of a small church where 99% of the moms breastfed.  I was in that group for 10 years, and they NEVER said some of the cruel and ridiculous comments you see on yahoo answers (formula is poison, you MUST breastfeed, I'm a better mom because my baby gets breast milk).  NEVER.  There was one mom who CHOSE to use formula, and she was never made to feel like a bad person.|`|n3PE2lvDaa	breast milk and formula are not the same. Eductate yourself on the facts before making claims like that. They are not so different that you can pick out what children are formula feed and what are breastfeed but there is no doubt about it that breast milk is superior to formula. Breastmilk has been proven to be healtheir for babies because of the live antibodies that it contains. This does not mean your children will be unhealthy if given formula but it can make a difference when it comes to colds and flues. breastfeed babies are less likely to get sick or if they do they usually dont get as sick.<br>  Breastmilk is also better for brain development. This does not mean that a forumla feed baby will be dumb and a breastfeed baby will be clever. But breast feeding could slightly increase your babies intelligence.  there are many other advantages to breastfeeding if you want to look up the facts. <br>  Im sorry you felt judged because you formula feed. You are right it is your choice. I breastfeed but I do not say mean things to mothers that formala feed. It is there choice. But saying they are the same is inaccurate information so I thought I would share that with you.|`|1Si9RlEXaa	Formula is not "just as good as breast milk" no, they are not the same, breast is and will always be best! <br>  It's hard work being a mama no matter how you do it, but I do wish more women would give breast feeding a try, its easier then it seems, and it is best for baby, even if you don't feel that way.|`|NxysHq8Zaa	I tended to get judged slightly, but I chose to put my 6 moth old daughter on formula, as i was worried i was going to suffocate her, only to discover that she is lactose intolerant, just like her mum|`|UghJ0XROaa	They are the same in the aspect that you use both to feed your baby, but if you think they are identical in any other aspect your are mistaken and need to educate yourself. Formula is not bad, but breast milk is better. Nothing you read will tell you otherwise.<br>  <br>  Your doctor should not be judgmental about it, i breast fed for 9 months and was disappointed i had to switch to formula at that time, her pediatrician was just happy that i did i was capable of doing at that time.|`|HclKftzAaa	actually, formula is slightly lacking when COMPARED to breast milk. However, you're correct that formula is perfectly adequate to feed to babies.<br>  <br>  And a doctor should not be judging you. Even at the hospital where i'll be giving birth, they are very pro-breast feeding, but they still offer support to women who chose/have to bottle fed.<br>  <br>  And you're quite right, no one should be judging you for your choice. It is your decision, and you've made the one that is best for you, your baby and your family. There are many reasons why women bottle feed, and it's not up to the outside observer to offer their opinion on what you're doing. As long as you and bubs are happy and healthy, then there's no problem. :)<br>  <br>  i plan to express milk as well so that i can bottle feed it to our baby (mostly so hubby can feed as well). I am worried that i will get looks and stuff if i use a bottle in public- even though it will have breast milk in there!<br>  <br>  Maybe people get so angry about formula/bottle feeding because they secretly WANT us to be flopping our boobs out in public... Personally, i feel a little oogy about that, which is why it would be nice to use the bottled breast milk when i'm out and about.|`|Q9qno7EVaa	I really struggled to breastfeed my daughter, so by 1 week old I was expressing and giving that to her in a bottle, I did this for my own sanity the first month was hard enough without all the struggles we went through with trying breastfeed. I saw heaps of lactation consultants and they all made me feel like crap because I wasn't breastfeeding, even though she still got my milk, they all said I would not be able to maintain my supply because it was not well established in the first place. Now she's 11 weeks old and I am still expressing she does get 1 bottle of formula a day as I don't have quite enough milk but I have been able to not only sustain my supply but increase it as she takes a bit more. I know the feeling of being judged I feel that I need to explain my situation when people see my baby having a bottle. My dr was great though he saw how hard it was for me and suggested formula if I wasn't coping, it makes it easier when a professional suggests it. As for formula being the same as breast milk this is not correct, while it is much better these days and as close as they can replicate it is not the same, breast milk is still better for babies. Formula can not possibly be the same as formula as each women produces slightly different milk which is perfect for YOUR baby and it changes as your baby needs it to. I think what bothers most professionals these days is that even with all the information about breast being best that many mothers don't even try to breast feed if every mother would at least give it a go they would be happy, but what does bother me is that as far as lactation consultants are concerned is that almost every problem can be solved and they never recommend or suggest formula (well the one's I saw anyway) they need to be a bit more concerned about the mother and how she is feeling through the whole process as it is such a difficult decision to make about giving up breastfeeding I was in tears when I couldn't even though she was getting breastmilk.|`|avx7bLnKaa	noone said your 2 boys were any different from breastfed babies... all she said was that breastmilk and formula are different .... <br>  there are over 100 things found in breastmilk that they cannot replicate in formula<br>  yes formulas are closer today than they were even 5 yrs ago but breastmilk and formula are different but they do serve the same purpose which is to feed the baby...<br>  <br>  breast is best but formula will meet the nutrtional needs of the infant<br>  <br>  if you feel defensive then you need to figure out why you feel so defensive... each mother does what she feels she needs to, to ensure the health of her baby and/or herself<br>  <br>  you made a choice, no reason to be so defensive|`|2674548b6a4c9cdbb098044c58c7af7aaa	No one has ever made a comment about my choice to formula feed.  Even though as a formula feeding mother, even I know that breast is best.  And formula is not as good as breast milk.  But it's still my choice as it is your choice.  It just helps to be properly informed and educated.|`|oem5yEUDaa	No our doctor has never judged me for formula feeding, I tried to breastfeed but it was making me depressed. I'm sorry to say that formula and breast milk are not the same. It is true that breast milk is better, but that does not mean there is anything wrong with formula.|`|MW18liqTaa	I feed my son breast milk so I can't answer you question about being judged.<br>  I would hate to shatter your illusions but formula and breastmilk are not the same. They both can sustain fledgling human life, but the similarity ends there.|`|zezIM9B5aa	Formula is fine. Not as good as breast milk, but it is healthy nonetheless. I hated that the judging, too, but I feel confident in knowing I take very good care of my son so I try not to let it bother me.|`|T389Yzi3aa	Actually Breast IS Best but Formula won't "HARM" the child either.<br>  <br>  Many women choose to use formula for lots of reasons, some include:<br>  <br>  *it's so FRIGGIN painful<br>  *health issues for the child or the mother<br>  *work and schedule issues<br>  *wanting to include the father in feedings<br>  *inability to pump and work demands are pressing<br>  *personal life issues (addictions, emotional issues etc.)<br>  *some moms think its sort of gross <br>  *modesty issues<br>  <br>  But most of those moms know this.....Breast milk DOES offer what formula can't.  It doesn't mean you don't love your child or anything, you just made a different choice than breast-feeing moms made....not a bad or a worse choice just a different one.|`|1795e9adbd644bbbce946795cd052957aa	Do you mean he keeps badgering you personally, or are you talking about breastfeeding awareness posters and general info in the doctor's office?  I'm not sure what the point would be for your doctor to keep pointing out that breastmilk is best if you are already excl. formula feeding.<br>  <br>  However, there's a very good reason why breastmilk is promoted over formula and the fact that you made your choice does not make them equal.  They are not.  Statistically, formula fed infants have a greater incidence and severity than breastfed infants, and you don't need to look science to tell you that.  Our bodies produce breastmilk for a reason.<br>  <br>  If you are talking about the literature that is generally out there at doctor's offices, hearing it each time you visit is the price you must pay for your right to choose an inferior product for your child.  Doesn't matter if you are sick of it, it's something you must deal with. There are more women than yourself who would be grateful for the information and support.   If you're talking about personal comments about what you should have or could have; then yes I'm with you.  There's no point to that; its your choice and you made it.|`|xqp28ETVaa	I was planning on breast feeding and was very upset when my personal Drs and lactation consultants told me I couldn't due to an anti-seizure med I take. But it is best to be healthy to properly care for my baby so I chose formula. <br>  Whenever I take my baby to his pediatrician I do always feel I have to defend myself because the question is always asked and then I get the "breast is best", "you should consult a lactation consultant"  and "didn't you attempt it at all?" remarks as well.....after I explain that it was my team of Drs and same lactation consultants they use that dissuaded me from breastfeeding they finally let up. It gets exhausting and I agree it can be annoying. I know breast milk is better and wish more than anything I could have given my baby that.|`|mvqfIjEVaa	I really wanted to breast feed, but my milk supply just never came in very well.  I tried for a month - supplements, pumping, everything and it never helped.  MY doctor understood and actually warned me that people might make judgmental comments.  My son's pediatrician did seem a little "judgy" with me.  I explained everything to him, but I just got the feeling that he thought I didn't try hard enough.  Maybe that was just me projecting my disappointment though.  I actually still do breast feed, but it's just not enough to sustain my son.|`|OHq5gSjJaa	I tried very hard to breastfeed and it didn't work out but I certainly was not under the dissolution that formula is the same as breastmilk.  Now my formula fed daughter is ahead of her milestones and the happiest baby I have ever seen, but I definitely know that she would have been benefited if I had been able to give her more breastmilk.  <br>  <br>  But to answer your question, no the pediatrician did not judge us at all.  Either find a new pediatrician that you are happy with, or stick with it and eventually they won't say anything because you will dry up and won't be able to breastfeed anyway.|`|46tTmMT7aa	Breast milk and formula are NOT even close to being the same! Just because babies thrive on formula does not mean it is the same as breast milk.<br>  <br>  And no, I was NEVER judged about using formula.

I have never heard of anyone being judged for there choice by the pedi. I go to.|`|Q7jMH5praa	No my doctor and my son's doctor is very understanding and know that I tried BF and it didn't work out. If my doctor did say anything out of line to me about BF I would find a new one and probably find a way to report her. <br>  <br>  I know your sick of hearing it (so am I) but breast is really best. Formula is good but does not have all the nutrients that breast milk does. In your defense though my brother, sister and I were all formula fed and we're all healthy and smart individuals.

But that's not judgment - it's a factor in my son's health.  It needs to be discussed.  <br>  <br>  When other issues relating to my son's health come up (he was a pretty spitty newborn) it's not like my pediatrician nags me "If you were still breastfeeding this wouldn't be happening!"  But it's also not like she has to pretend that breast fed babies spit up more just to make me feel happy.  These are realities and facts, not random opinions of strangers on the internet.<br>  <br>  I don't have a combative relationship with my son's pediatrician - we're partners.

When the mistake came to light, he offered a little "breastmilk is amazing stuff" commentary, and continued to be extremely nice to us. So, as a mistaken-identity formula feeding mother, no, I wasn't judged at doctor's appointments.

You're the "stupid baby mama".|`|VRgq1NV6aa	why did you even get involved with him to start with?<br>  <br>  Cut your losses and get away from the loser so your kid will have a chance.|`|Ki6jlwnbaa	Why would you have a baby with him in the first place?|`|DcLiW4bbaa	No! God no, don't marry him. You deserve someone who is going to be good to you and treat you right, you don't need to tie yourself down to someone who is going to lie and cheat. Just because you have a child with him DOES NOT mean you should marry him.<br>  <br>  You should marry someone because you love them and they love you and you both want to spend your lives together. Someone who lies and cheats obviously isn't ready to settle down and spend his life with you. <br>  <br>  Respect yourself and know that you deserve better, girl!|`|RmFVYkxeaa	NO. At 30, he's not gonna change. Get out while you can. The fact that you're asking this question means that you're having doubts. It sounds like you've answered your own question already, and the answer is NO, maybe you just don't want to face the reality???<br>  <br>  I wouldn't trust him. Don't ever think that marriage will change a person = it doesn't!|`|VUKDrd2taa	Hell no don't marry him!<br>  I would leave his ***.<br>  Liars and cheaters will always be liars and cheaters. Especially if they're that age and still acting like that.|`|Iu0AJDviaa	I feel sorry for all of those poor kids including yours.What a shame.<br>  <br>  Get as far away from him as possible and dont ever look back-if you want any hope for your son/daughter.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	He sounds like a loser.  Why do you think he will change?  A father that doesn't want to get a job in order to avoid paying child support for his other children is not good husband and father material.<br>  <br>  Cut your losses here.  Don't keep doing the same thing and expect different results.|`|CVdcrY3kaa	There's no way I'd marry a man who I could call a lie and a cheat. My husband is none of the above, and I wouldn't tolerate it.|`|lGcpXteaaa	I think its actually quite funny that you just slagged him off...then you just say......should we just settle dwn and get married now?? haha<br>  <br>  Funny. I find it so hard to understand HOW women get into situations like this. Plus why..no HOW can anybody say 'baby daddy'...<br>  <br>  Dont get married...concentrate on your child for gods sake.|`|gyYXV3Bxaa	Hell no! Get as far away from him as you can.  You and your baby deserve better.  I don't think you're stupid, I just think you're naive.|`|IFDfpbFJaa	Ya no......cut your losses. It's easier said than done but no....unless you want your child to grow up and turn out just like him. <br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|5f6XnInEaa	You should not be marrying anyone at all, if you still call someone a 'baby daddy',
DJpS9GDxaa	can't really say...I mean, there's no such thing as a perfect height anyways....but at 12/13, everyone is so different on their path through puberty...lol, that sounds really cheesy, doesn't it :)|`|LUg9dgb5aa	i'm super short.<br>  & i'm 15. i'm like<br>  a 4"6 or a 4"7.<br>  maybe a tiny bit taller.<br>  or shorter.<br>  <br>  there's no perfect height for a 12-13 year old.<br>  Let puberty take its toll, dear. [:|`|kRaVa0Wraa	**height<br>  <br>  it all depends on height, how much they are developed and how much muscle you have.|`|9zwSclnLaa	There isn't a set one.  Everyone is going through puberty and growth spurts, so anything is pretty much normal.  If you are worried, ask a doctor.  Or use:  www.bmicalculator.com<br>  <br>  Enter said 12-13 year olds height and weight and it will tell you what "health" range they are in.|`|I64JOuMKaa	Maybe like 4'8 - 4'11 ?<br>  <br>  Im a shorty ): im like 5' and im in highschool T_T !

qqiVKUBpaa	Totally normal. My baby girl is 4 weeks too. I was concerned about how much she was eating and how frequently so I called my pediatrician's office and the nurse said that at 1 month old 4-6 ounces a feeding every 3 or 4 hours is normal and more frequent feedings like every 1-2 hours are usually because they're going through a growth spurt.|`|phgfj3F1aa	That's completely normal. Babies only eat when they're hungry. My 2 month old eats 6 oz. every 2-3 hours. Does he sleep through the night? He may be eating more to get his calories in during the day. That's what my daughter does. He may just have a fast metabolism.|`|FW9wiJ77aa	Every baby is different. I always fed my kids on demand. If hes hungry every two hours feed him. All my kids ate like that.|`|skSzDIlwaa	well babies are suppose to eat every 3 hours so it is okay for him to eat that much.|`|H47P8urEaa	honestly... my daughter was eating the same amount at about the same time and she is doing wonderfully. some told me that she was eating too much but her ped. told me that if she is hungry to feed her because she will not over eat. she knows when to stop. good luck.|`|MHOxPs8Oaa	Yep it is perfectly normal. You can try feeding him 6 oz. every 3-4 hours if you are having troubles feeding him so often.|`|CVdcrY3kaa	Sounds normal to me. My daughter is 7 months, she still nurses every 2 hours. (but yes, even formula fed it's normal to eat often)
AA12202431	Odd someone say 40mill is normal. I was told I was normal with only 7 mill and me and my wife had 4 kiddies.|`|sk46uigvaa	It depends how many of the 31,000,000 are ALIVE and how many are FORMED properly??<br>  <br>  here is a link to help explain <a href="http://fertilinet.com/male.htm" rel="nofollow">http://fertilinet.com/male.htm</a>|`|aeuWwrehaa	hell no normal is 40,000,000 so i say he is good to go|`|AA10988719	It is considered that a man has low sperm count when he has less than 20 million spermatozoa per one ml of ejaculate, so you are probably ok. <br>  <br>  <br>  A reason for infertility in men can be due to hormones as hormones are necessary for the production of sperm. These levels all need to be evaluated as well as a physical examination. <br>  <br>  There is more to treating this problem than eliminating tight nylon underwear and going with cotton boxer shorts. Heat is not the ideal climate, eliminate recreational drugs and alcohol|`|OOTNTUQkaa	That's a lot of sperm swimming around there. It's like you can get pregnant 31,000,000 times, lol. Just kidding.|`|0LwBdwAPaa	my husband has 16 mil and we got pregnant, and it only takes 1
YUNE5QReaa	She may be a tom boy which is perfectly normal.<br>  <br>  You may find that she has more in common with boys and that she doesn't like playing the games that the other girls play.  I was like that - I would much prefer to play football with the guys instead of bitching about girls with my m8s.|`|w6QF2uJHaa	its ok im 9 and i play with a neighbor boy that's 10 too you should let her decide when she feels like it its her decision im a girl and i hang out with mostly boys  i don't like calling people on my school list <br>  i have called a boy once  and a boy has came over my house i think its find just remember its her decision to choose which friends she wants to hang out with|`|RmFVYkxeaa	No, she's not obsessed with boys, kids just do whatever's convenient. He's right next door and ready to play. If he's not at home she'll probably call her friends. The difference between 8 and 10 is nothing at this age, it wouldn't matter if its a boy or a girl next door she'd still want to play with them. Let her play and enjoy herself, let her do what she wants to do, not what YOU think she should be doing. She'll grow up soon enough and you won't be able to get her off the phone!!!|`|HoonZJMgaa	I have 4 daughters and 2 are about that age 8 and 9 to be exact. They both have friends numbers but don't call their friends however we have a large family and do a lot of things together. My 9 year old was boy crazy for a little while but that was due to a friend she had at the time which I definetely put a stop to. Your daughter may not be boy crazy she may just get along better with this boy than her schoolmates. I would just pay attention closely and not worry too much. In a few years you will wish you could go back to her staying off the phone!(lol!)|`|zrO4h1hqaa	i started in 3 grade or less|`|869a923e153dd118c958218801d84b78aa	my niece was 13!!!!   Very shy.
el8yX5q3aa	Of course they want him to be where he is until it is time..but preemies have a MUCH better chance at making it than they did even 10 years ago.<br>  <br>  I hope you have called your doctor....they might be able to stop it.|`|5f6XnInEaa	There is a fighting chance he will be ok, but if you showed labour symptoms this early, your doctor would more than likely try to put a stop to the contractions.<br>  <br>  Hmph, thumbs down for logic, ey?|`|jSn8Vd1taa	The age of viability is usually around 27 weeks, and you're six weeks past this (Most people go into labour at/after 37 weeks so he's about a month early). He would likely need to be kept in hospital for a while/on a respirator because he's 5-7 weeks early but he definitely has a good chance! If you're having contractions at 33 weeks call your doctor!!|`|GxYtTjUbaa	I'm daughter was born 29 weeks 6 days she was in the hospital for two months she weight 2.6 when she was born the doctor wil stp ur contractions. If my daughter survived and she was 2.6 ur baby will be fine but its scary turst me.I was depressed. Take it easy and relax hun|`|7rIAd6gGaa	You can't know for sure. He'd probably have to stay in the hospital for a while, but the chances of him being completely fine within a few months are really good. My cousin had her son at 31 weeks, no steriods, and he came home within 5 weeks and is doing great. Good luck!|`|WXuZKOBAaa	you should ask a doctor...not yahoo answers
VpDhPP8baa	Having another scan won't guarantee correct identification of sex anyway.  <br>  Scans are done later for some reasons as stated by other answerers here, summarised as- low lying placenta, gestational diabetes-big baby, sometimes for positioning.Extra U/S for a healthy pregnancy is highly unlikely<br>  <br>  Position of carrying/shape/ feelings etc are not accurate. I have had just about everyone tell me this one is a boy- sonographer saw a girl.<br>  Last time me and everyone right up until the end thought it was a boy (I didn't find out last time) but out popped a girl|`|NPmRmnG6aa	My OB only does one at 20 weeks if everything normally. My little girl did not want to have an ultrasound at my 20 week scan and I had to have another one at 24 to get better pictures of the heart.|`|53QQ9KXEaa	It depends on where you go, to be honest... Some places just give you one in the very beginning and one in second trimester, others sometimes give you three (one in each trimester). <br>  <br>  Anyway, don't listen to any old wives tales about pregnancy... I'm having every one in the book that pertains to a girl (even carrying high) and my baby is clearly a boy lol|`|HM0cxcahaa	Not after 20 weeks, unless they think there are any problems such as placenta previa etc or if they think the baby is too big or small they may do another at 34 weeks|`|xypA3yZMaa	Why dont you pay for a 3d/4d ultrasound i think its starts at 50 bucks and they can tell you 100% if its a boy or girl. Good luck!|`|1o820L3Daa	I think thats it, unless your doctor has any concerns. Im 23 weeks now, and have been told thats it.|`|f50f6a665c054d5ffd525f5a31663073aa	no, not normally|`|mgrI7tFEaa	thats it unless there are any complications in pregnancy . everyone was telliung mew i was havin a girl because of the way i was carryin even tho the scan said i was havin a boy!!!
nOzQUsToaa	If I have two sons, I'm going to name them Oliver and Jude. I don't think any of them sounds feminine, they're both boy names, it's just an annoying trend that everybody is giving masculin names to girls. Go for Oliver Jude, it's gorgeous.|`|IU4uNH97aa	Oliver and Jude are both my sons' names.<br>  <br>  I think Oliver Jude is a very masculine name. It's cute and unique without being to out there. Oliver i think ages really well and as a baby/toddler he could go by Ollie. Olivia is the feminine form of Oliver and i think Jade and Jude sound completely different from each other. I also think Jude will not because a new unisex name.|`|AA12380526	They do sound sort of effeminate together.  Also, Oliver kind of sounds like "All over".|`|gxqawyxUaa	I think it sounds wonderful for a boy.|`|Oliq3ZDnaa	In the movie Something the Lord Made on HBO, lab tech Vivian Thomas' mother was so sure she was having a girl, but he was a boy and his name stuck. Oliver Jude is adorable, hopefully your child will learn to avoid people who bully them because they have a girl's name.|`|F2cVt5jaaa	NO!!! This is an adorable name!! I love Oliver and Jude is so unique :)<br>  Keep the name...you will get alot of compliments on this wonderful name :)|`|2IMF3okYaa	you should combine them with a more masculine name like Andrew Bryan or a more feminine name like Anastasia Grace or something else JUST SUGGESTIONS!!!!|`|kfH2uFufaa	Its nice and unique. If you like it, then go with it. Who cares what others thinks. It's a unique combo and not common like every name out there.  =)|`|XzV4bUeFaa	As far as I'm concerned both are boys names.  Oliver is masculine and Olivia is feminine.  (Or Olive)  Jude is masculine while Judith is feminine.  If you like it then go w/it.|`|IuzaNq2Uaa	I love both those names and that name combination! I don't think either of them are effeminate.

TE7foNwMaa	Boy-<br>  Carter -- I really love Carter. It's great, and not too overused. My sister's extremely obsessed with this name, so I suppose I have to like it. ;) 9 / 10<br>  <br>  Cooper -- I love Cooper also. I had a friend with this as a last name, so I would love to use it after her... So I really love it. 9 / 10<br>  <br>  Kellen -- This name's also on my list...though spelled Kellan... After a friend of mine named Kelly. I love it, it's amazing. One of my favorites, also... It's brilliant. :) 10 / 10<br>  <br>  Maxwell -- Maxwell isn't exactly my style, I guess... it's a name that I can only generally picture on a dog... It's not my favorite, but it's not a horrible name at all. 6 / 10<br>  <br>  Aiden -- I don't really like Aiden... it's much too popular. The number one most popular name of 2008... I really couldn't use it, just because of the popularity. Of course, it's obviously a great name...that's why it's so popular. But I would never name my own son this. 6 / 10<br>  <br>  Cullen -- I love Cullen. It's great... It's classy and has a wonderful irish flair to it, and I think that's great. Though I definitely dislike the Twilight books...this is a name that I really loved before the books... I'm not sure how willing I would be to use it though, thanks to the books. But I do LOVE it. 9 / 10<br>  <br>  <br>  Girl-<br>  Isabella -- Again, too popular because of the Twilight books... It's the second most popular name of 2008... So, again, I wouldn't use it because of the popularity, though it is pretty. But I also detest the Twilight books... it's a great idea for a book, but the writer is about as talented as a middle schooler...and the editor...WAY too many typos. So, Isabella isn't really my favorite. 6 / 10<br>  <br>  Grace -- I like Grace. It has a wonderful meaning, and it's sweet and classy. I think it's great. MUCH better as a first name than a middle name, in my opinion. 8 / 10<br>  <br>  Jolie -- I do like it... It's gorgeous, but I don't think I'd ever personally use it. I do really like it though. I also love that it means "pretty" in French. It's great. 8 / 10<br>  <br>  Emma -- Emma's another one that's too popular for my liking... Number 4... I used to adore it, and I think it's a great name, but it's too popular at the moment... It's a good name though. 7 / 10<br>  <br>  Ivy -- Ivy's alright. I love the nature-like feel, it's one of the better nature names. But it's another one that I wouldn't personally use, mostly because of a previous teacher of mine whose last name is Ivie... She's quite crazy, and was fired last year after being found with one of the high school guys (one of her students...and yes, she's married) in a secluded area IN the school...need I say more? She's a rather odd woman, and I think of her whenever I hear the name... so I really couldn't personally use it for that reason. But it's not a bad name at all. 7 / 10<br>  <br>  Addison (Addie) -- Addie's cute, but Addison is another "too-popular" name for my style. Though I do like Adélie and Adalene. It's number 14 on the popularity list, and I know quite a few Addison's. I think Addie's great, though. 6 / 10<br>  <br>  <br>  Both-<br>  Reese -- I personally like Reese for a boy, though I think it makes a great middle name for a girl. I do like the name, though. 7 / 10<br>  <br>  River -- I prefer this one for a girl. I know two girls named River... I think it's a bit odd for a boy, though. So, it would get a 8 / 10 for girls, but a 5 / 10 for boys from me.<br>  <br>  Taylor -- I actually think Taylor's fine for each. I know quite a few Taylor's, but it's still a great name. Very classy. 7 / 10<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Okay, well I hope I helped. :) <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  -- Amy|`|F2cVt5jaaa	BOYS:<br>  MAXWELL: Love it!!!

Most of your "symptoms" are 2nd trimester symptoms anyways.|`|dW9C6aswaa	Well it sounds like you just might be pregnant! I had that same taste in my mouth and I'm due in September LOL.<br>  <br>  <br>  I would take a test right now preferably early response.<br>  <br>  oh well the mood swings and being emotional were my biggest issues my poor husband actually slept on the couch for the past 3 week LOL. His word's were YOU ARE AN EVIL WOMAN lol<br>  <br>  <br>  Sore breast's is also another one along with heaviness it sorta feels like someone had put weights in your bra LOL|`|VmdMG7Edaa	hey i'm not a mom but it sounds to me that you are, in the other hand i have experienced most of the signs before. Once my period was 2months late and all the symptoms that u posted i had . so try not to stress out.
MHOxPs8Oaa	No, not really.  It mainly depends on what the mother eats while pregnant with the child.  If she goes longer than full term.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	could possibly, but my doc said she was more likely to weigh and be about the same size as me and then grow to somewhere between our sizes when she was a baby..|`|kKMhmPPdaa	Our baby weighed almost exactly the average of what Daddy weighed and what I weighed when we were both born.<br>  (His weight) 7 pounds plus (my weight) 9 pounds = 16 pounds<br>  divide that by 2 = 8 pounds<br>  <br>  I've heard this formula worked for several other friends of ours as well.  It also worked when figuring out how long baby was going to be, although I'm sure it's not a hard, fast rule.|`|7rIAd6gGaa	It could, but your birth weight is more relevant. (My doctor told me this.) My husband was 10 pounds, 24 inches (HUGE!). My daughter was a week late (so had more time to grow) and was 8lbs 7oz. Not quite as big. I'm pregnant with a boy now, and I'm hoping he's not like his daddy was either!!|`|CVdcrY3kaa	My DR always told me that it could play a role in it, but it really depended on how healthy I ate. Our daughter was 8lbs 10oz, her daddy was 8lb 9oz.|`|xpUyH0psaa	yes it could|`|cCL5vUgCaa	Not necessarily.  I was scared too!  My husband was nearly eleven pounds, our son was a very average 7 and a half.  Your size will factor into the equation also.

NOAPRIz5aa	Yes, this is normal for a child with a productive cold who is too young to blow their nose.  In the normal way, nose-blowing clears the mucus, but a baby will swallow it and expel it as you have discovered.
hmOidFp3aa	AHH! Good luck it sure sounds like you are preggo to me! Go to whenmybaby.com and on the left hand side there is a llink to a home pregnancy test calculator! Hold on ill do it for you....*waiting*<br>  Okay-it said your next period is due march 2 but you are already 13DPO! I bought some preggo tests online that are accurate 6-8 DPO so you might get a BFPin the morning if you use your FMU! If not it says the next day to test will be thursday the 26th of Feb! Good luck and baby dust! you the website--its good :)|`|CS7eUNhFaa	It's possible.
hmOidFp3aa	Everyone already answered the BFP! BFN is the same thing but negative. The reason that HPTs are only 99.9 percent accurate is sometimes they spit out a false negative! Different preggo tests can detect the HCG at different levels. So if the first test you took has a high sensitive then it will spit out a positive, but the hospital might need more HCG to give you a positive, therefore it was negative! Make sense? Good luck and TONS of baby dust!|`|L0EKlaZ8aa	big fat postive!!!!!!<br>  there is hardly ever a false postive you can get a false negative but u cant get a false postive beucase that meant there was hcg dected in your urine and there is no other way to have that presnent unless u are pregnant, so there is a GREAT chance u are prego wait a few days test again at home then go to the doc and get a blood test if u still dont start.|`|vgQBoU4Uaa	i would personally go with the test that you toke at the hospital then the one you bought at the store but you should try three different times at the hospital<br>  <br>  hoped i helped! =]|`|S5n5Za78aa	what you got <br>  BIG FAT POSITIVE <br>  GOOOOO GIRL congrats|`|CS7eUNhFaa	BFP = Big Fat Positive (meaning positive pregnancy test).<br>  <br>  And yes, you could still be pregnant.  =)|`|96HWpdkFaa	I think you are pregnant.<br>  A false negative is more common then false positive.<br>  Go back and get a blood test done!<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  <br>  (oh BFP means BIG FAT POSITIVE!)|`|FMmncxToaa	BFP= Big Fat Positive !!!!, exactly what you have,a positive pregnancy test; congratulations!
23bgwpD1aa	I waited 7 weeks. my stitches took a little longer to heel.|`|q7HvkRpyaa	I had a c-section and I waited 4 weeks, then called and asked my doctor if it was okay. He told me as long as I feel up to it.|`|iFmKcRl0aa	6 or 7 weeks and I was recovering from a c-section. You just have to take your time with things. If something hurts, you might not be ready.|`|f50f6a665c054d5ffd525f5a31663073aa	2weeks, have sex when u feel ready to have sex just like the first time u did it, if it hurts or u have any pain stop and wait a couple more days|`|mTyu7CKoaa	I waited a week and a half (i know horrible right) but we took it easy and everything was fine|`|MbmHripJaa	they say wait 4 weeks but i waited like 6 or 8 weeks. I guess you just feel regular again...i was so nervous when we had sex again.. lol|`|7rIAd6gGaa	They do say to wait 6 weeks. I waited a little longer than that. And when we did it, it hurt like hell, so we didn't do it again for a while. I think everybody's different though. But I would wait the 6 weeks to make sure you've completely healed. (Besides, you probably won't want to!)|`|AA11065140	Do you really want an answer, if the wait wasn't voluntary?  LOL!  It was 14 months for me - the bio-father was nowhere to be found, and there aren't a lot of dating opportunities for a young mother!<br>  <br>  Thank GOD I finally found my husband!|`|FI8tqUOAaa	You have to wait 6 weeks for your body to heal. Its not safe to have sex so soon after having a baby. You could become pregnant again. You dont want to become pregnant again before your body heals. Its not healthy|`|pjgMW6qaaa	i waited 10 weeks<br>  i was just scared that it was going to hurt. <br>  But i had my post postpartum check up at 4 weeks and doctor said it was ok if i wanted to have sex. i decided to wait anyway|`|05iXos13aa	4 to 6 weeks as soon as you stop bleeding and if you breastfeed you have a harder time  chance of getting pregnant

MW18liqTaa	Some boys start lactating at puberty. I am guessing that the lumps are milk duds.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	It's gynecomastia, it's very common when you start puberty to have enlarged breast tissues when the hormones start to climb, similar to what happens to guys who take steroids and the high testosterone levels give them breasts.  It will get better as your body gets used to the hormones, at least that is true for most boys.   Even my own father had to deal with this in high school - got teased by another boy who said "Nice boobs."  In gym class..   Well, the next year they were gone.|`|xJWZTwFVaa	Well im 19, naven't gone completly :( nipple cripples can and do cause them!)|`|5jjGo6XTaa	well if the lumps like on you nipples like you see it just looking at then cause then its hormons. it it inside your boob and one big bump thats just your boob if its a lump on top of the boob bump it can be cancer.|`|9nJwsSvPaa	your going thru puberty....silly rabbit|`|fqVxw8HMaa	dude you're 14.<br>  never heard of this.<br>  id consider lumps 'not' a good sign.|`|LpqOxVDUaa	perhaps you better go and see dr. or go for health screening,...<br>  its better to know now than later.  weather its cancer or just lump thats<br>  go away as you grow ....u wont know. be safe than sorry i say......
HclKftzAaa	well, the first thing you should do is take a test so that you know whether or not she IS pregnant. Just because she has missed a period, it doesn't not mean 100% for sure she is pregnant. I was very irregular in my teens.<br>  <br>  Then, if you're not pregnant- she needs to get the pill, and you need to use condoms in future!!!<br>  <br>  Is she IS pregnant, you both need to tell your parents. And you need to tell them what you've told us- that you want to keep it. They will be mad at first, but hopefully they will come around and love and support you and your decision.<br>  <br>  There's no point trying to hide/deny it. Life continues to move on whether you agree with where it's heading or not.|`|lzcglDnMaa	I am not going to tell you that you are stupid, because it sounds like you are already beating yourself up pretty bad about this. Calm down. If she thinks that is pregnant, she can trick her body into thinking it is pregnant. That will delay her period, and she will have pregnancy symtoms. You just need to get a test and have her test and see if she is pregnant.  Tell her not to stress, stressing will also make her late. Good luck to you. The dollar tree sells pregnancy test.|`|nqkXE1cUaa	Do not get an abortion. Have you ever seen the movie Juno?<br>  You can give it up to adoption, or have her go to a Birthright Clinic near her. Also, if you get a pregnancy test and she is knocked up, tell your parents. They can make sure she is having healthy foods and taking prenatal vitamins.<br>  Shame on you for getting a younger girl pregnant. You just screwed up her life.|`|mTyu7CKoaa	10 days isnt enough time for her to be showing those kinds of signs, headaches during pregnancy are caused because of increase in blood flow (usually second trimester), pregnant women dont usually start gaining weight til 12-18 weeks, lower back aches are more common in second trimester, and nausea doesnt start til 5-7 weeks... so i doubt she pregnant probably has the flu... its going around|`|H2IhRXIIaa	Ok if you dont want abortion (which is good) and you dont want adoption...then what are you asking help for? Because unless you both have parents that will help you..and you can finish school. Your options are limited..<br>  <br>  And there are 'open adoptions" look into it. But first thing is first you guys need to go take a test!  ASAP! Then go from there.|`|9hrJfhIIaa	She's pretty young still - her periods could be irregular. Many pregnancy symptoms mimic PMS - buy a test when she's due for her period to know for sure. Good luck.|`|jSn8Vd1taa	First thing; buy a pregnancy test or take her to the doctor. At that age periods can still be irregular (depending on when she started) so a week late may not mean anything. Find out if she really is pregnant, and if she is go to a clinic or somewhere like Planned Parenthood to take a look at your options. You've said you're against abortion and adoption so really, the only option would be to keep it...There's nothing wrong with adoption though, just something to consider.|`|CkLwurWUaa	If you don't want an abortion or adoption, keep the baby and take care of it. That is the only way to go if you want to see your baby.|`|AA11542929	tell ur parents.... u guys seem mad young and immature.. go to the store in a week and get a test test her and if its positive get a job and get ready for ur life to be over.. babys are a true blessing.. good luck|`|qH1YcQ2kaa	quit freaking out until she takes a test<br>  not having a period can be caused by lots of other things as well<br>  go get her a test and then decide what to do|`|46ddc6b6990fcd5b5d5e36dc7b533ccaaa	You need to talk to your parents or an adult you trust. You are going to need a lot of help and support|`|lKqRd94zaa	Try an online pregnancy calculator or ovulation predictor. They can give you the dates of when she would be ovulating and when she might be able to get pregnant. If she wasn't ovulating at the time you had sex she can't be pregnant. Also if she is 1 week late with her period that is plenty of time to show up on a pregnancy test if she is pregnant. I have been in your situation at your age too and I was always lucky. Condoms aren't reliable and you are very young still if she isn't pregnant the Pill or Depo shot is your best option. It is good that you understand that you have Both made a mistake. It takes two to tango. I support your decision to keep the baby if she is pregnant but you will both need lots of emotional support more than anything. I hope your parents support your decision. Good luck to you both and hopefully this will be a very important life lesson to you both.|`|mqHL4UcRaa	It takes about 2-3 weeks for the fertilization process, implantation process, and for her body to produce a high enough level of the pregnancy hormone to feel symptoms or test for. <br>  <br>  Even if she were pregnant, it's too early for her to gain weight or feel any pregnancy symptoms. She wouldn't have an increase in appetite until she is 12+ weeks pregnant. Basically she wouldn't have any symptoms until she is 5-6 weeks pregnant. <br>  <br>  She is only 13. At that age her periods are not regular. There will be months that she may skip or weeks that its late. I wouldnt consider her pregnant yet just based on the fact that she is a week late. However, do take this as a lesson learned. I hope you both are not pregnant since your not ready. If she is, keep the baby & do the best you can.|`|skSzDIlwaa	wow sweetie just come down you guys will be okay. i am with you about not doing the abortion. but there is one thing you should know. when your parent's find out they might force her to give it up or do the abortion. if you don't want either you have to be strong and tell them no and you want to keep the baby. <br>  okay with you life ending that is not true ok. just go to school still but when the baby is born let a family member help you guys take care of the child without hurting her/him or doing anything to the baby. Just keep with the schooling and when you are done then you can get your life back on track and find a job and take care of the baby. or she doesn't go to school anymore and take care of the baby and you just go to school and try to help with the baby. try finding a job, mow the lawns for ppl with pay of course. do anything to get money. but don't sell drugs that wont get you anywhere. well thats all i can say now. well good luck to the both of you.|`|cswHfmFdaa	hey im 14 and im pregnant, it will be hard, the hardest is when its brand new, stay in school because u need an education to support the kid as it gets older, there are places that will help you with school a schedual that u can do, extra credit stuff, youll get money from the government, (at least where im from)|`|u6BNPURKaa	Tell your parents.<br>  <br>  In the end, they are going to find out anyway. Do it now and at least you can guarantee that the baby will have proper health care as it matures.|`|7RgrBtmXaa	So what exactly are u asking???? I am only 16 and MIGHT be pregnant so i cant give advice cause i MIGHT be in the same stupid situation!|`|xSOAwIXsaa	Its way to early for those symptoms. <br>  Next time (if there is one) BE SAFE!|`|f872a7e49ec096abf5ee9af70c9d718faa	could she or you talk to ur parents? its about all i can say but i hope she isnt..|`|60nJiCTHaa	Like everyone else said, first things first, buy a pregnancy test. First Response would be the best. or look up a Free pregnancy clinic in your area on the internet and take her there. There all confidential and no age requirement! *IF* she is, and you are leaning more towards keeping it, you need to go to any pharmacy and they have over the counter prenatal vitamins untill you both get up the courage to tell your parents. But i really suggest you tell SOMEone who is older who you can trust and maybe they can talk to your parents. You really need the support right now and they WILL be angry, but will hopefuly eventually get over it. And I am too against abortion and NO ONE i mean no one can make her get one. It is completely up to her. So dont let her parents or yours say she has to because she is under age. Its NOT true!!! Hope this helps and GOOD LUCK!!!!!|`|db5f6d9593a678681b66a5729cebb0e3aa	It's too soon to tell if she's pregnant.  Wait until the day her period is actually due.  If she doesn't get her period that day, have her do a pregnancy test.  If she's not comfortable with the results, then have a doctor do one.<br>  <br>  If her period is coming up soon, that can also explain the hunger and weight gain.  Periods are a hormonal time for girls - some of the symptoms include bloating, temporary weight gain from water retention, and increased hunger and cravings.  After the period, it goes back to normal. <br>  <br>  Good luck but next time, be more careful.|`|xWkf8jxkaa	I was a teenage mother so I know whats its like to be in your shoes. It could be one of two things. It could all be in your mind and her mind is tricking her into thinking she is pregnant and that is why she is acting like that. Or she could be pregnant and have early symptoms. I am not trying to tell you what to do but keeping your baby is the best thing emotionally for everyone. If your family helps you will make it. I had a baby at 15 and managed to graduate high school and be in college at 16 years old. Its hard but if you two do it together you can make it. If i can do it as a single parent, you two can definitely do it together. Abortion and adoption, no because the baby didn't do anything to deserve it so keep it and do the best you can and later on down the line you'll be really glad you did. If you are a little immature then now is the time to grow up and man up.

8KZ7HKgvaa	I love it, I want to name my kids after a relative, but also a name that me an my husband like, that way they have lots of choices when their older<br>  <br>  Treyu, nobody instroduces themselves with their middle names|`|IU4uNH97aa	I think its fine. I have a son with 2 middle names ; Jude Michael River. We chose it because Michael is after the husband Micah and i loved the name River but the husband didn't want it as a first name so we compromised with a double middle name. So i think its an awesome way to honor people but still have names you love in it. But anything over 2 middle names seems a bit long to me and after it sounds like your just listing a bunch of names. For this baby we want 2 middle names if its a girl because this might be our last baby and we want to honor both of her grandmas. I think it depends on why you are choosing to have two middle names.<br>  <br>  -- Plus when my son grows up and doesn't like the name River he can always drop that name and just go by Jude Michael.|`|4kuWOZowaa	Well that is nicole richies baby name..i think its cute actually BUT i really can not stand when people give babies two middle names..they cant fill out all of that on forms. employment apps and in school.

I personally have an extremely long list of names that I love, and I'm not planning on having 100 kids... so I think it would be fine to use a double middle name (though I most likely won't do this anyway). <br>  <br>  So, double middle names are fine if they have reason and personal meaning behind them...and they're often stereotyped as being trendy and whatnot. I do think it's a bit annoying for people to give their children two middle names "just because" though. Just because they know that other people are doing it, and things like that... I think they're wonderful if they mean more. As long as they're not tagged on just because they're nouveau. <br>  <br>  Well, I hope my answer helped...or I hope it made sense, really. :)<br>  <br>  -- Amy|`|KeRqdX2Vaa	Using 2 middle names is a personal thing. My God-children both have 2 middle names. That was a personal choice their parents decided on. If I find names I like that go well together (and the hubby agrees :D) then our children will have 2 middle names. <br>  <br>  My God-son's name is Aleksei Jade Christopher and my God-daughter's name is Keely Eavan (EE-von) Jean.<br>  <br>  Also: Nobody introduces themself using their whole name! On a job application, you usually just do your first and last name w/ a middle initial...so that child will have 2! Big whoop...if they don't get the job it better be for some other reson then their name. The only problem Lex's mom had to deal with was his whole name not fitting on his SS card the first time they did it...simple enough fix: they changed the font!|`|UpRdvpmXaa	I personally like it. My fiance and I have decided when we have children they'll have two middle names. She has two middle names and I think they flow well together. You just have to work to make sure that the names flow together and that it doesn't sound to choppy because then it sounds to wordy.|`|dHnWtlbqaa	if the names flow together and sound nice with the last name, why not? its a personal choice and most times the kiddo is only going to put her first initial of her/his middle name so its not a big deal|`|Oliq3ZDnaa	I feel only if it is absolutely necessary should a child have 2 middle names. It's not a bad idea though, as long as you choose names that pair together, or were made for each other.|`|2IMF3okYaa	As a child i always wanted two middles names but then i was like whatever i think one name is nice and simple and no one needs any long drawn out name.|`|kfH2uFufaa	Cute names but honestly when you give your child/ren two middle names, it just sounds like you couldn't make up your mind picking a name.|`|g5LO3OW5aa	If the names go well together then it can be very cute!|`|JvtdOyNzaa	I can't stand it!<br>  It's ugly, tacky and annoying!!<br>  <br>  Hi, my name is Aubrey Geneva Miranda Carver...<br>  <br>  Ew!!!!!!|`|cHrTF5kBaa	I think it's obnoxious...haha.<br>  Don't ask why, it just always came off like that to me.|`|IEzkCljmaa	depends on the names match but i would be ok with it|`|XzV4bUeFaa	I guess it's ok but I wouldn't give a child 2 middles.  I think a first middle and last is more than enough.|`|H82j1jYWaa	I love second middle names!|`|CkecSp4Uaa	It strikes me as kind of Catholic.  Sorry if anyone is offended, it's not meant to be offensive but that's the first thing I think of.  Personally I'm not a fan of two middle names, but then again I'm not entirely sure I understand the concept of one middle name either.  It's a great way to add emphasis if a child is in trouble or you need to emphasize the seriousness of a situation but beyond that middle names don't seem to have much of a point.  If you want 2 middle names that's your choice and your right.  But I'll stick with one middle name.|`|d3BZlRyhaa	I like it... My niece's name is Ashley Sierra Jade <br>  I never knew you could till she was born (i was 7 when she was)<br>  Ever since then i've liked having 2 middle names :)|`|syrh8J6Vaa	I hate it!  I have never seen a name with two middle names that flows well.  They are too long and in my opinion look ridiculous.|`|u7UnUZXnaa	i think it's cute (: !
29944ccd64861970ae51bf4345a57f13aa	I'm not sure if this counts, but my brother and mother both told my husband to "do it" with his boots on, so that we would conceive a boy.<br>  <br>  LOL, yeah right!|`|S5n5Za78aa	geritol complete|`|ioTPGLRwaa	dont stress....i hate that one....it will happen when it time i hate that one too
7531af390093fd03c92a315b77b7dc84aa	You wouldn't feel nauseous yet. It's too soon. I have thought I was pregnant many times before and I was just imagining symptoms because I want to get pregnant as well!! Also, sometimes, your period symptoms are similar to pregnancy symptoms, they just disappear after your period starts!|`|sR3gcvubaa	Most people feel nothing, no implantation pains, until your period is missed.  Then you may start to feel nauseous, dizzy, etc. You could be one of those who feel all those little pains and twinges but chances are you want it so much you feel things you normally wouldn't.  I understand how it feels to want something and be so hopeful you try to attribute everything to that.  My first pregnancy took a long time to conceive so I felt that way for months.  And, truthfully, after I stopped obsessing about every little thing I got pregnant.  My second attempt to conceive was when my first was only a few months old so I didn 't have the time to obsess.  Now 10 years later I am trying again and feeling the old obsession come back.  Good Luck!|`|t8HPCzrOaa	implantation takes 12-14 days so its to earlier to get signs its take 3 days to ferlize the egg but 1 to 2 weeks for implantation|`|05iXos13aa	you can not tell so early just wait your partner should wait so that his sperm is built up so that your chances will increase at least 2 to 3 days in between because thats how i got pregnant it wouldn't hurt if he was still inside you after wards if you both fell asleep just pick a postion that will let the both of you are comfortable|`|7rIAd6gGaa	I can tell you that I knew I was pregnant the day I ovulated. It was my second baby (I'm 35 weeks now) so I knew what I felt last time, and I just knew it right away. I had the pains, and I was nauseous. It's possible. Good luck!!!|`|f50f6a665c054d5ffd525f5a31663073aa	to early to tell
HENBlJ17aa	Ahhhh hun i really sympathise with you, I've been with my fiance for 2 years, engaged for over 1 year and living with him for over 1 year too. We're trying for a baby and i've been worrying about telling my mum too. I think you should just sit down with her and just tell her, as they've said you will feel better straight away. Once your sat down with her it will come to you naturally, whatever you decide to do i hope it works out for the best good luck :)<br>  <br>  I joined YAHOO just so i could say this to the 18 year old who's just commented who thinks its ok to give you **** when you've got two kids of your own? Who are you to sit there and judge her? How old were you when you started popping them out? I think you should sit back and take a look at yourself before you go giving her a lecture on how shes going to support her baby, there is certainly alot of help where im from so im sure it's just the same over there in America!!! She came on here for help not to get ****<br>  <br>  Good luck again hun, Hope all goes well!<br>  <br>  Jess, 19 England x|`|S5zaw8F3aa	First of all are you kidding?  You are a child yourself.  When I was 14 I was playing with barbie dolls.  Secondly, I had my first child at 18 and it has been difficult so good luck only being 14.  How do you plan on supporting a baby?  Diapers and formula are very expensive.  Not to mention daycare for while you are still in school.  What are you in middle school/ or 9th grade?  That means at least another 3 years of daycare for school.  Then daycare for work so you can buy those diapers and formula.  When do you plan to get your homework done?  In between the midnight and 4 am feeding?  How about sleep?  Or any kind of a personal life or fun?  Thirdly, go to your mother first.  Be open and honest with her and pray to god she doesn't kick your butt for being well being a 14 year old I guess.... Good Luck....|`|6L9jJnchaa	You might as well tell them because they are going to be paying for everything.  Way to go.|`|2osuEr0naa	Oh wow. You're still in high school, or maybe middle school? You're young. <br>  <br>  I'm 19 years old and pregnant. The hardest thing for me was to tell my parents. Now they're divorced, so I had to do it twice, which was hard. I told my mom first, and I started to cry. I told her straight up, and was honest with her. I told her I really needed her right now, because it was the hardest thing for me. She cryed of course. My father took the news farley well. He was very supportive<br>  <br>  Your parents might be angry with you, yell at you, ground you, make your life a living hell for the first couple months, maybe weeks, But they really do get over it. My mother and father are very supportive. They're both excited. I'm expecting in June. :] <br>  <br>  Once you tell them you'll feel so much better trust me. Just get it over with it. I hope you're not planning on doing abortion. Do the adult thing. It's not always best to take the easy way out. I hope everything works out for you. Good luck. :]|`|22ff0e123ffb20f91023f4e47ce57b20aa	Well you could just tell them.  Sit down with them and tell them.  Maybe you could tell your mom first and have her help tell your dad.<br>  If you can't get the words out.  Just show them the test or the paper that says you are pregnant.  I just gave it to my mom and she told my dad.  good luck to you  I hope your family is supportive in what ever you decide to do.  Also remember education is your key to success|`|5jjGo6XTaa	well you deff got your self into a bad situation but now that you are and im assuming you plain on keeping the baby. i think first you need a plain on what you are gonna do stay in school work finding a baby sitter if you are going to rase this child or adotion you first need a plain this is y children should have babies cause im sure you have no idea about what you wanna do and how you are gonna do it and how much money it will take to rase a child how much effert it takes. you need a plain and dont count on no one but your self if you want this baby its yours to take care of not my tax money so time to grow up get a job and figure out how you can take care of this baby once you have thought it out then go to them either way theyre gonna freakl cause they kno you have no idea what it takes and they know that you now will lose out on you life . cause you will its never gonna be about you no more all about this child. and i think you should sit dfown with the father about the baby to. see what he has to say but fyi 90% of young fathers dont stick around 60% of adult fathers dont either. so dont count on him even if he says hell be there only count on you.|`|LwoeIHCBaa	Okay 14 are you kiddinq me ? but ohwheil i have been thinking about getting preanant But im only 13! But i dont know because ALOT of parents are DIFFRENT so i dont know, with my parents my dad i dont think he would really care because i even talked to him about this before i was even thinking about getting prego. But yeah e.mail me if you wanna know more because i have the sorta same problem.<br>  e.mail: srybecca@yahoo.com<br>  Hope to hear from you soon|`|ex53YwSuaa	Tell your mom first. That way, she'll protect you when your dad comes at you with an axe. Or a machine gun. Or a shovel.<br>  But if you'd like to tell your dad first, go ahead.<br>  You deserve whichever reaction he'll give, anyway.<br>  *sigh*...When will these kids stop having sex?!
AA10673927	If you've met this boy, are okay with him, and believe your daughter is smart enough to make good decisions, be responsible, and respect herself, then you should let them go. There are lots of people in a movie theatre, and if he is doing something she doesn't like, someone is sure to notice and help her.<br>  [:|`|I64JOuMKaa	come on she's your daughter<br>  you should know her well enough<br>  is she a smart kid where she knows she won't do anything with a guy?<br>  Maybe if you tell her if one of her friends is going then she can too , and the friend and your daughter can come to your house after to make sure that the friend was there..<br>  <br>  but anyways<br>  if you trust her let her go<br>  <br>  but whats the most that can happen at the movies?<br>  unless she's not going to the movies ..|`|9zwSclnLaa	You are her mother, you should make the choice.  If you feel okay about this then let her go, if you don't then don't.  That's what it is pretty much up to.  She is your daughter and you know her the best.<br>  <br>  IMO, I don't see why not.|`|EelbVaToaa	i see what you mean!!!  Do whatever you think is best for her.  <br>  <br>  They may say that they are going to the movies, but what if they don't?  It all depends in how much you trust your daughter.<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK|`|rhtOTju0aa	i would let her go. I'm sure she'll love you forever and it will show her that you trust her.|`|PKRZtwyHaa	21|`|1MEnCmwoaa	If it is just movies I think it is ok. Say she can go if you drive her and pick her up. Then you know where she is. She needs to get her independence sometime. Also, talk to her about sex so she knows what can happen. <br>  At that age there is no doubt they will do some things, even if it isn't full sex.|`|rcQsigIFaa	you shouldn't be looking through her jeans, notes, and on ichat.<br>  that's an invasion of privacy, and a good reason for her to hide stuff from you.|`|MiYtXlVwaa	go with your gut.<br>  If you disapprove she may just have to sneak and be with him or sneak and go out with him.<br>  Just make sure they are going to a movie and get details.|`|X2FrjG8Laa	ell it all depends on you but if you trust your daughter let her go young kids want to go out with there boyfriends to the movies|`|AA12260791	yes, trust that she will be responsible and let her br free, you will have to let go of her eventually|`|4IHe4rPYaa	YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS let her kiss her bf it wont hurt her and it makes her feel amazing|`|bX39kTu4aa	Yeah why not, She's 14.If you taught her well, you should see this as a chance for her to prove herself to you|`|oyINZiNDaa	lol well if your daughter acts like a hoe maybe you should have set a better example for her first off......don let her run wild i had a friend that was like that we were close then she started hangin with the wrong people doin drugs havin sex at 14 with old older guys like 20s pushin 30s and i tried to talk to her and then i tried talkin to her mom an her mom acts like the worlds this perfect existence an that her daughter don do nothin like that...so if she don see it she aint doin it...sad to say that girl died.....her mom finally opened her eyes on that one.....so maybe you need to have a talk with your daughter....and maybe you should chaperone this "date"|`|CdU35XPiaa	i would let her go, it's just the movies there's not much she can do wrong there, and if she decides to do anything it's her choice, and not letting her go to the movies isn't going to stop her from do anything any other times.|`|719YOdHLaa	well people can qo to the movies && leave to qo other places<br>  but i say qive her a chance cause when u say no trust me<br>  they will find a way so let her qo && enjoy herself make sure you know what time the movie ends && beqins hope i helped|`|IE4ygCBDaa	this is pathetic<br>  you are a mother<br>  and  you are asking in the web if you should let YOUR daughter<br>  go with her boyfriend<br>  <br>  sadsadsad|`|0G7Ehzbuaa	No, i wouldn't|`|Wz5ECTYPaa	id let her go but chances are shed abuse it.<br>  my sister did, they left the theater and she had sex with the kid.|`|KPzOHpoEaa	just because you havent caught her doesnt mean... well, you know.<br>  if this kid's had many girlfriends, i would not trust him, because he will continue to have many girlfriends, i used to have friends like him at that age and of course he seem snice, i'm a guy, it's not hard at all to seem nice to a mother, and hide your character completly. <br>  Now listen, a boy cannot play with things he can't handle, a 15 or 16 year old boy wants to go out with a girl, he wants to play the games of men, but he does not want to assume the responsibility of men, and our culture does not want him to either!<br>  The way it has always been up to the recent generations it has always been, that you are a boy, just a little boy, and then you go through a right of passage to become a man- you assume the responsibility of a man, and with it you receive a wife, the reward of being a man. it is very black and white, it goes directly from child to man, but now, we have labeled people who turn 11, or 14 etc 'adolesents' and they remain adolesents until they're 35, when can you start thinking about having a woman? when you've assumed the responsibility of manhood which i am sure he hasnt. he wants to play and have all the perks, but he doesnt want to pay and he doesnt want to work. DO NOT TRUST THIS KID. <br>  <br>  i hope this is of some direction|`|wdsGPJFiaa	if you have suspension that she is experienced in certain areas that she really shouldn't be at that age. then i would have to say no. do not let her go unless there is an adult with her (either his mother or you or your husband. not his father because her alone with him = his dad may not be good either)<br>  <br>  anyway. im saying this because i know when i was 15-16 ish i loved going to the movies, but instead of seeing a movie doing other things. such as kissing/making out and touching each other. i know shame on me. O.o<br>  <br>  but honestly at that age. that's when you start to think about these things. and you want to do them. then you end up regretting it later. sometimes.

I wish that there was an easy, comforting, answer but there isn't.<br>  <br>  Clearly, you need to see your doctor as soon as you can and discuss your concerns with him/her from both a physical and emotional perspective.  I also really feel you would benefit from some counseling to help you process your grief and to help you manage your anxiety and fear.|`|7b04258a9254c4fa8d300fdb896389c4aa	FIRST OF ALL, I AM SO SORRY THAT YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND ARE GOING THROUGH THIS.

IF THE SAME UNFORTUNATE THING IS TO HAPPEN AGAIN, OR LETS HOPE YOUR SECOND BABY IS HEALTHY, YOUR DOCTORS, WHO ARE GREAT PRACTITIONERS I'M SURE, WILL WORK OUT WHATS BEST FOR YOU AND YOUR LITTLE ONE.

I am so so sorry for your loss. I cannot tell you how sorry I am. You need to let your Dr. know right away that your pregnant again. Just because something tragic happened to you and your unborn baby doesn't mean that your going to experience that again. As for your uterus, I am sure that it is just fine. There are many women who get pregnant 3 months and even less after giving birth and everything goes just the way it is supposed to . This baby that your carrying is a blessing from God and because your son had skeletal dyspepsia doesn't mean that it will happen with this baby as well. Just take it easy and get as much rest as possible because you have been through so much and make sure to let your Dr. know right away so he can keep a good eye on you. Again, I am sorry for your loss, be strong and God bless.

Un enfant deja tres sociable, propre et eveillé se sentira parfaitement à sa place en petite section, et cela ne pourra etre qu'un plus pour lui. A contrario, un enfant qui est encore un peu "dans les jupes de sa mere" sera perdu et probablement en souffrance.

I got pregnant with my daughter using the pill and condoms (never late with a pill, and never broke a condom).  I LOVE my Mirena, and feel safer with it.  But considering I am happily married and already a mom, it wouldnt be a big deal if I got pregnant again, so we dont find the need to use condoms as back up.  I know people who have gotten pregnant on EVERY other form of birth control, except Mirena.  I really think they need to tell more girls about it as an option, rather than pushing the pill or shot on them just because it makes the doc more money.|`|7f0ddfb234f55429e30ae6a68000e8cbaa	Yes, and I love it, but then again, I'm also married and monogamous.  It's more effective than condoms, and a better long term solution if you aren't looking to become pregnant any time soon.  I chose it because I'm over 35 and a smoker, and the pill was dangerous for me under those conditions, not to mention that there is nothing fun about latex friction burn given that my hubby is, ahem, well... large.  It also doesn't cause weight gain like Depo-Provera or the pill does.  In the beginning, you have a lot of sporadic spotting, but nothing bad.  Eventually, my periods went away more or less altogether, and when I do have periods, they're shorter and lighter, usually just a couple of days.  Plus, my insurance covered it, so it only cost me the cost of the doctor's visit co-pay to have it placed.  Otherwise, I think it's a little pricey, but I still would have paid full price if I had to.  Kids are WAY more expensive!  And, for the gal who said that her cousin's became displaced fairly often, I suppose that's only the case for women who have had multiple pregnancies, whereas, we have no children, and I think those experiences are extremely rare.|`|u3Pz79r4aa	My sister-in-law got pregnant and miscarried while using the Mirena IUD. I don't think any form of birth control is 100%. But if you must use birth control, just do all the research first.|`|148cce69e49f68436c86fb3bd7882888aa	Not me, but my cousin said hers keeps falling out.

NjKAWqzlaa	Everything I ever read or was told by my doctors during my pregnancies was that you can continue lifting or doing any other physical activity that you were doing before you became pregnant as long as it doesn't cause you any pain or discomfort.  In other words, if you were used to lifting 30 pounds before you got pregnant, you can keep on doing it.  If you weren't, I would be careful, although 30 pounds isn't really that much, so it may not be a big deal.  The paint fumes and the ladders are another story, though.  I would watch any kind of chemical fumes and avoid anything that could cause you to fall.  Remember, as your belly grows, your balance will be affected.|`|f10ebdaf0188ca166507aae70c628222aa	ask your doctor what is safe, i wouldnt know.|`|408643caa32ae504e179efb9be1c8bd7aa	I'd call your doctor just to be sure.  The lifting doesn't worry me as much as the latex paint and ladders as long as it is weight that you are accustomed to lifting and not something that is a strain for you.  Fumes aren't good and your center of gravity really shifts during pregnancy making falls more likely.  I have coached gymnastics through 4 healthy pregnancies and that involved a good deal of lifting.|`|0JKDVazSaa	As long as you have been doing this activity since before you were pregnant and there are no complications with your pregnancy, you should be able to continue lifting activity for a little while.  Ladders are NEVER a good idea when you are pregnant.  As for the paint, you should wear a mask and only paint in well ventilated areas (even not pregnant). I wouldn't suggest painting on a regular basis while pregnant.  Getting the babies room ready is one thing.  For all these activities you should check with your OBGYN, as I am not a doctor.<br>  Regardless, congratulations and I wish you the best!

The spanking is completely ineffective if the child doesn't understand what he/she is being punished for!!!  there is always a way to teach (because discipline means "to teach") a child  without spanking, but if you choose to do it, make sure you talk to the child about the behavior that led you to spank.|`|21811360a2d321b491a20bd531c98b9baa	Spanking is appropriate when the child puts their life in danger,<br>  for example runs out in the street. <br>  <br>  I always feel it should be used only as a last resort, and applied with the palm of the hand on th butt.|`|48bbf37fba523b1419b88d0419065b27aa	it is when it is not an abusive type of spanking|`|85e1de8ca5468ccedf8951b95bd9ae93aa	Yes as long as you remember there is a difference between spanking and beating and you know the difference|`|AA11093156	Yes, as long as you don't go overboard. Smacking a child on the hand, timeouts, etc. are also acceptable forms of punishment.|`|AA11728843	"spanking" is, but whipping or beating isn't.  It is an age old discipline & is even advised in the Bible.  Now, people get in your business & call the authorities because other people can't control their anger & go overboard.  Or the kids have learned that all they have to do is tell the right person & mom will be in trouble...it is a crazy world.|`|AA12132808	Yes, but it really depends on the child. For example, you wouldn't spank a 15 year old. You probably shouldn't spank a 2 year old either. Also, it shouldn't be too harsh. But, keep in mind there are just as effective if not even more effective ways of dealing with children other than spanking. Try positive encouragement!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-violent_child_discipline" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-violent...</a>|`|fe88895f07fffd48f661381592d1a02aaa	spanking, on the bottom. not beating.|`|b002aba7031fb2fa1e748725146d6003aa	Yes it is an appropriate form of discipline.  Just make sure you are not disciplining out of anger.  It would also help if you have the right type of object to spank with.  Some people use belts, some use ping pong paddles, but biblically the proper item would be a "rod" -which in today's world would be something of about 15" in length, and about the circumferance of your pinky finger.   Consistency is also needed.  You can't expect a different child after just one spanking.  Spanking should be done any time your child is dis-obedient, and you should try to get your child to admit what they did, you should also re-assure your child that you love them.

I was lucky that I went so fast,b/c it did not yet spread to the baby yet when they did an ultrasound and a blood test..Do you have a fever?<br>  Have you been vomiting alot? Does your Urine kind of have a foul smell (this might sound gross,but the best way I can describe it is like it smells like Smoked sausage) that means that there is alot of protein in your urine...possible Kidney Infection.<br>  You are probably severly dehydrated and I would recommend seeing a doc as soon as possible and drink alot of water until you get to him today...

There isn't anything to make it go away.  Mine is specifically moderate to severe pain in my tail bone.  Sometimes it hurts so bad I feel like I broke it.  When it gets really bad, you can take tylenol, I take 2 extra strength before a walk. You can also use Ativ-on for backaches.  It works pretty good, temporaraily but doesn't last long if you are doing any kind of physical activity.  Mine is hurting right now as we speak, and I can't wait to deliver this baby so it'll go away.  I have actually just had to learn to live with it.  It is just one of those wonderful things that happens to us pregnant women.  Try not to do any heavy lifting, that won't make it any better.  This is my 2nd pregnancy and it didn't happen in my first, so I am sure it has a lot to do with lifting my 26 pound 1 1/2 year old several times a day.  Congrats on your pregnancy.

a110d17d2efa9551adeba5b30532c00eaa	Pregnancy Symptoms — Early Signs of Pregnancy <br>  Pregnancy symptoms differ from woman to woman and pregnancy to pregnancy; however, one of the most significant pregnancy symptoms is a delayed or missed menstrual cycle. Understanding pregnancy symptoms is important because each symptom may be related to something other than pregnancy. Some women experience pregnancy symptoms within a week of conception. For other women, symptoms may develop over a few weeks or may not be present at all. Below is a listing of some of the most common pregnancy symptoms. If you have been sexually active and experiencing any of the following symptoms it is important to take a pregnancy test. Find a Free Testing Center<br>  <br>  Implantation Bleeding:<br>  Implantation bleeding can be one of the earliest pregnancy symptoms. About 6-12 days after conception, the embryo implants itself into the uterine wall. Some women will experience spotting as well as some cramping. <br>  <br>  Other Explanations: Actual menstruation, altered menstruation, changes in birth control pill, infection, or abrasion from intercourse.<br>  <br>  Delay/Difference in Menstruation:<br>  A delayed or missed menstruation is the most common pregnancy symptom leading a woman to test for pregnancy. When you become pregnant, your next period should be missed. Many women can bleed while they are pregnant, but typically the bleeding will be shorter or lighter than a normal period. This symptom is commonly explained by other reasons. If you have been sexually active and have missed a period, it is recommended that you take a test: Find a Free Testing Center or Order my pregnancy test<br>  <br>  Other Explanations: Excessive weight gain/loss, fatigue, hormonal problems, tension, stress, ceasing to take the birth control pill, or breast-feeding.<br>  <br>  Swollen/Tender Breasts:<br>  Swollen or tender breasts is a pregnancy symptom which may begin as early as 1-2 weeks after conception. Women may notice changes in their breasts; they may be tender to the touch, sore, or swollen. <br>  <br>  Other Explanations: Hormonal imbalance, birth control pills, impending menstruation (PMS) can also cause your breasts to be swollen or tender.<br>  <br>  Fatigue/Tiredness:<br>  Feeling fatigued or more tired is a pregnancy symptom which can also start as early as the first week after conception. <br>  <br>  Other Explanations: Stress, exhaustion, depression, common cold or flu, or other illnesses can also leave you feeling tired or fatigued.<br>  <br>  Nausea/Morning Sickness:<br>  This well-known pregnancy symptom will often show up between 2-8 weeks after conception. Some women are fortunate to not deal with morning sickness at all, while others will feel nauseous throughout most of their pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Other Explanations: Food poisoning, stress, or other stomach disorders can also cause you to feel queasy.<br>  <br>  Backaches:<br>  Lower backaches may be a symptom that occurs early in pregnancy; however, it is common to experience a dull backache throughout an entire pregnancy. <br>  <br>  Other Explanations: Impending menstruation, stress, other back problems, and physical or mental strains.<br>  <br>  Headaches:<br>  The sudden rise of hormones in your body can cause you to have headaches early in pregnancy. <br>  <br>  Other Explanations: Dehydration, caffeine withdrawal, impending menstruation, eye strain, or other ailments can be the source of frequent or chronic headaches.<br>  <br>  Frequent Urination:<br>  Around 6-8 weeks after conception, you may find yourself making a few extra trips to the bathroom. <br>  <br>  Other Explanations: Urinary tract infection, diabetes, increasing liquid intake, or taking excessive diuretics.<br>  <br>  Darkening of Areolas:<br>  If you are pregnant, the skin around your nipples may get darker. <br>  <br>  Other Explanations: Hormonal imbalance unrelated to pregnancy or may be a leftover effect from a previous pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Food Cravings:<br>  While you may not have a strong desire to eat pickles and ice cream, many women will feel cravings for certain foods when they are pregnant. This can last throughout your entire pregnancy. <br>  <br>  Other Explanations: Poor diet, lack of a certain nutrient, stress, depression, or impending menstruation.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.americanpregnancy.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.americanpregnancy.com</a>|`|AA11626012	Early symptoms: nausea, vomiting and missed periods.<br>  <br>  Later symptoms: Weight gain, large belly and odd cravings.<br>  <br>  Much later symptom: Babies being expelled from your vagina.<br>  <br>  :)|`|cePjQ00Naa	nausea tired all the time, weight gain, fainting sometimes, missed period.|`|dTC2LMkgaa	Usually you have a missed period, morning sickness, tired more than usual, gaining weight that you didn't have before.

1fac77089c473742d1a895f8822f8d4caa	I would take a home pregnancy test or go to the doctor and get a blood test just in case. <br>  <br>  This is too little information for us to tell you if you are pregnant or not. Only a test or an ultrasound can truely tell you.|`|02a65e28ab8e1941b9cf8990f838e23faa	I also experienced the same.. I had slight cramps and a little blood for 2 days before my period came..  <br>  You have to wait, maybe it was due to some stress or other factors.|`|87e133072e76f5d786362f22c1a19c3caa	Cramps arn't really a sign of pregnancy just a common symptom of most woman... More obvious signs of pregnancy when your period is over 2 weeks late, your breasts are sore and enlarged, feeling nausitated... Best thing to do, as we don't really have much information from your question to give you a good answer, would to wait 2 weeks (As you are saying this is the time you normally get you period) as blood tests and urine tests don't always pick up the pregnancy if you are under two weeks pregnant, wait two weeks go to your doctor get a blood test to see if you are pregnant, if not it could be many things, perhaps your period is late from stress, change of diet or excersize, diarea, collic there are so many reasons..<br>  <br>  Sorry I couldn't help you more,  you didn't give us much information to work on.. Best of luck
C6uPTGyEaa	well hearts are beating at 8 weeks so if hes not seeing a hearbeat that cant be good. It doesnt mean that the baby is dead it just could be that its snuggled away from the cameras view since you have to do a vaginal ultrasound. The fact that your HCG levels are high is a good sign, but they can stay high even for several weeks after miscarriages. I had this high HCG level even after miscarried. <br>   My 2 miscarriages happened at 8 weeks, and 14 weeks. The first time i had what they called a fetal absorbtion. I went in for a regular checkup they couldnt find a heartbeat, I was having no signs or symptoms at all, they did an ultrasound and only found a placenta but no fetus. I then miscarried the Placenta about a week later. Had a D & C. The second was 14 weeks and again at the 10 week Doppler  there was no heartbeat, they did an vaginal ultrasound, but couldnt find anything, were going to wait a few more weeks since i had no signs or symptoms of natural spontaneous abortion. I was scheduled for a 16 week check up but suddenly miscarried terribly and explosively at the 14th week. I was told the fetus was not viable, meaning that it was missing genetic code or somthing like that. My 3 pregnancy went totally normal heartbeat at 10 weeks, everything good and great, 5th month i went into labor, and there was no stopping it, I gave birth to a stillborn boy, and again they told me he was missing genetic materials. They would not allow me to see him. I am now 37 weeks pregnant with a totally and completely healthy girl. Even though miscarriages are horrible and devestating you got to keep it in your mind somehow that they were for a reason. The baby wasnt ment to be, if you cared for your body and did everything right then there was a reason that it shouldnt be here and its not your or anyones fault.|`|64cf42bc52ec850f15dc4a39f2b95979aa	In this case, I do not know, but in mine, no heartbeat and bleeding began weeks later and I lost at 11 weeks! Then I had a d and c! Maybe they just can't see it yet! Do not loose hope! The blood results were good, so hang in there till tomorrrow and maybe the dr. can figure this out! Best wishes!|`|758eee9403e359fb7525bcf0e0e430e0aa	This has happened to me before on my second pregnancy. And it wasnt good. But not being able to hear the heartbeat is ok because you have a certain period that you have to wait to hear it so it all just depends. When I went through this the reason I had gone to the doctors was because I was bleeding and I had in fact miscarriaged. They did the same thing and it was positive that I had miscarriaged. Well you should'nt worry though because you arent bleeding and thats a good sign. If its high again and they do another ultrasound and you still cant hear it dont worry just go back in a week and have them retry it might just be too early to hear it. Good luck and I hope everything works out for you.|`|AA11895534	My friend went through this with her 2nd child.  Her doctor had actually told her that she miscarried, but in fact she didn't.  He is 5 now, don't give up hope.  You can still be pregnant.|`|AA11603712	If they're sure you're 9 wks and there's no heartbeat then it's probably a blighted ovum (there was no baby in the yoke sack).<br>  <br>  I had an ultrasound at what they thought was 8 wks and it didn't show a heartbeat. It turns out I was only 5 or 6 wks at the time. I had another ultrasound 2 wks later (at 7 1/2 wks) and they found the heartbeat! You never know how far along you are, so everything might be fine. I'm 37 wks now and everything is normal so far. Good luck!|`|12f36f2154992bff6fb646b24f99acb4aa	You could possibly still be pregnant, but no heartbeat isn't a good sign.  Wait to see what today's hcg level is.  If it is dropping, then you are having a miscarriage.  You may not pass the fetus, it may be absorbed into your body.  That happened to me during a twin pregnancy.  You will know more once the levels are done.
TPlYHiQuaa	Well first of all, I hope you are young asking this question.<br>  A period is a natural thing is all women. It is when you bleed from your vagina for about a week once a month. <br>  A pregnancy is when you have been having sex and not using protection. If you are pregnant then you have to have had at least one period and the guys sperm has to have gone into your vagina. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps, next time ask your mom.|`|7f501ad81dc5f9e7aecec5f06a57db5daa	Pregnancy is when your baby is inside your womb.  Period is the monthly cycle of bleeding. During pregnancy generally period will not be there.  When you are having periods, the possibility of getting pregnancy is there in case of unprotected sex.|`|BoT5zWhtaa	What?

770694da3c61dd707050829822e47277aa	Motrin Tablets is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). It may cause an increased risk of serious and sometimes fatal heart and blood vessel problems (eg, heart attack, stroke).  <br>  <br>  Motrin Tablets may cause an increased risk of serious and sometimes fatal stomach ulcers and bleeding. <br>  <br>  <br>  Caffeine easily passes from the mother to her unborn child through the placenta. Because the systems for breaking down and eliminating chemicals are not fully developed in the unborn child, blood levels of caffeine may remain elevated for longer periods in the unborn child compared to the mother. Higher amounts of caffeine could affect babies in the same way as it does adults. <br>  <br>  Some reports have stated that children born to mothers who consumed more than 500mg/day were more likely to have faster heart rates, tremors, increased breathing rate and spend more time awake in the days following birth. Also, caffeine has a diuretic effect, which results in fluid and calcium being drawn out of your system. This will prevent your child from getting some of the important nutrients and fluids it requires during growth. Further, coffee and tea, especially when taken with cream and sugar, are filling and satisfying but don’t provide you with the nutrients that are required during pregnancy. Caffeine may even prevent the absorption of vital things such as iron. Though mild caffeine consumption probably does not cause any serious birth defects, it is probably best to try and limit your caffeine intake throughout your pregnancy.|`|1ffc303db15fdc00d04d05f7b03f2f53aa	Small amounts of caffeine are okay, usually 2 cups or less per day.  Ibuprofen is not okay, only Tylenol.|`|408643caa32ae504e179efb9be1c8bd7aa	Pregnant women cannot take ibuprophen.  They can, however take tylenol.  Conversely, nursing women can take ibuprophen and NOT tylenol.  Pregnant women can drink coffee, but should limit daily caffeine intake to no more than 3 caffinated beverages a day at the most.|`|ZdBrT1aHaa	no women cannot take ibuprofen while pregnant she can tylonol but not extra strenght just regular tylonol. and i would say no to caffiene! maybe a little bit not too often but to be on the safe side no.|`|ep702QMmaa	you can only take tylenol, you can drink coffee but in moderation.|`|nMRNxsvAaa	My doctor told me tylenol was ok.

jQVKjLEWaa	You can have it at a resturant or any other type of place (a hall, clubhouse, someone else's house). Invite her closest female friends and relatives and tell them where she is registered, and the gender of the baby if it is not a secret. Plan a shower, usually about 3 or 4 hours long (typically day time) with food and drink, it doesn't have to be extravagant. Baby themed decor is always fun, and you may consider giving guests small, usually baby-related party favors. There are tons of ideas on the internet for baby-related games to play at the shower if you want to do any games. Have the guest of honor arrive (usually it's a suprise, but it doesn't have to be) and just enjoy eating/drinking, socializing, and watching her open gifts. Many baby showers are very low key...just like an informal gathering at someone's house, while others very extravagant. Anything you want to do is fine. It's just an opportunity to wish the mom to be well through a party, and give her all the essentials she'll need as a first time mom.|`|46tTmMT7aa	Some parks have little buildings you can have them in or rent a hall or something.|`|OkOCOnbTaa	some churches will let you use their basement, or you could rent a VFW hall or something like that. what you need is finger foods, maybe a small cake. you also want to have decorations and games.  some games you can play is how big is the belly(have everyone measure a string and guess how big around the mommy is) you can also do the baby game where nobody can say the word baby. give everyone a pacifier on a string and if they say baby someone else gets to take their pacifier, who ever has the most wins........hope this helps. you can also search the Internet for more games and shower gifts|`|66c9165a858d5cf5fc7fafe31f9840ceaa	If your weather is warm, outside is perfect!

408643caa32ae504e179efb9be1c8bd7aa	The mucus plug has been there all along!  What happens is that once your cervix begins to efface and dilate, the plug falls out.  Sometimes it comes out in one pretty good chunk, sometimes you'll notice pieces of it in the toilet for a day or two.  It's a sign of pre-labor.  Usually you'll go into labor within 2 weeks, though in my experience I once went into labor a few hours after starting to lose the plug and once it was 4 weeks.  Your vaginal discharge will get heavier as your pregnancy progresses but isn't really related to the plug.  If it has blood in it (or looks pink), it is called bloody show and is a sign that early labor is under way!|`|c4TUcIr9aa	Not sure when it starts to develop, but it does have a bit of discharge when it releases. My wife had a discharge with all 3 of her pregnancies. It discharges in the early part of the 9th month normally.|`|coUDc4jeaa	no it doesnt.. The only time a female developes a mucus plug is during pregnancy. cervical mucus does develop during ovulatiuon.

My advice is chart your temps to determine if ovulation occurs and if you have a long enough luteal phase, read the book "Taking Charge of Your Fertility", be healthy and take vitamins, relax and don't stress, you and your husband need to see the doctor to discuss your issues and desire to become pregnant, your husband should have a sperm analysis done first, after charting for a few months make sure you are timing intercourse accordingly.<br>  Depending on how long you have been trying your doctor may not do anything at this point.|`|iuUEB0heaa	I was really impressed with the "Pre" outer lubricant by Pre seed.

Sometimes they may be heavy and sometimes they may be really light.  <br>  As for the symptoms before you start your period, they can be different from month to month also.  <br>  If your bleeding then your not pregnant.|`|408643caa32ae504e179efb9be1c8bd7aa	You need to take another test.  Most of the signs of early pregnancy can also be signs of hormonal imbalance.  Bleeding in early pregnancy can be a sign of miscarriage.  If you have a positive test, call a doc and explain your bleeding.  If you have a negative test, call a doc and explain your symptoms.

I wouldn't worry but a test is the only real way of finding out.

Went in for an ultrasound to see if everything was gone and discovered a whole other sac with another baby in it. That child made it full term and is walking around today. :)<br>  <br>  The part that is confusing is that the hcg of any remaining twin should have been registering with the first few tests.<br>  <br>  You got me stumped.|`|037acf2c7fba142267c8fcbd772a233faa	If your levels are going up , your pregnancy is viable(living) Good luck and keep the faith!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|2e8f87fb68e6b0bde726afe087af5c43aa	it sounds like you have been blessed with a miracle baby and I hope in your case this is what as happened I have had 2 miscarriage and usually when the hcg levels start dropping they continue to drop I have never heard of them going back up you must still be pregnant  for it to be at a 100 it may be that you were pregnant with twins and one implanted before the other one  did and the test could not pick up the hcg level of the second baby for it was not implanted yet good luck here is a little on hcg levels there is alot here to read but I hope it will help you<br>  The hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (better known as hCG) is produced during pregnancy. It is made by cells that form the placenta, which nourishes the egg after it has been fertilized and becomes attached to the uterine wall. hCG can first be detected by a normal blood test about 11 days after conception and about 12 - 14 days by a urine test. In general the hCG level will double every 72 hours. The levels will reach their peak in the 8 - 11 weeks of pregnancy (the third month) and then will decline and level off for the remainder of the pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Key things to remember about hCG levels:<br>  About 85% of normal pregnancies will have the hCG level double every 48 - 72 hours. As you get further along into pregnancy and the hCG level gets higher, the time it takes to double can increase to about every 96 hours. <br>  Caution must be used in making too much of hCG numbers. A normal pregnancy may have low hCG levels and deliver a perfectly healthy baby. The results on an ultrasound after 5 - 6 weeks gestation are much more accurate than using hCG numbers. <br>  An hCG level of less than 5mIU/ml is considered negative for pregnancy, and anything above 25mIU/ml is considered positive for pregnancy. <br>  hCG is measured in milli-international units per milliliter (mIU/ml). <br>  A transvaginal ultrasound should be able to see at least a gestational sac once the hCG levels have reached between 1,000 - 2,000mIU/ml. Because levels can differentiate so much and conception dating can be wrong, a diagnosis should not be made by ultrasound findings until the level has reached at least 2,000. <br>  A single hCG reading is not enough information for most diagnoses. When there is a question regarding the health of the pregnancy, multiple testings of hCG done a couple of days apart give a more accurate look at assessing the situation. <br>  hCG levels should not be used to date a pregnancy since these numbers can vary so widely. <br>  There are two common types of hCG tests. A qualitative hCG test just looks to see if hCG is present in the blood. A quantitative hCG test (or beta hCG) measures the amount of hCG actually present in the blood. <br>  Guideline to hCG levels during pregnancy:<br>  hCG levels in weeks from LMP (gestational age)* :<br>  <br>  3 weeks LMP: 5 - 50 mIU/ml <br>  4 weeks LMP: 5 - 426 mIU/ml <br>  5 weeks LMP: 18 - 7,340 mIU/ml <br>  6 weeks LMP: 1,080 - 56,500 mIU/ml <br>  7 - 8 weeks LMP: 7, 650 - 229,000 mIU/ml <br>  9 - 12 weeks LMP: 25,700 - 288,000 mIU/ml <br>  13 - 16 weeks LMP: 13,300 - 254,000 mIU/ml <br>  17 - 24 weeks LMP: 4,060 - 165,400 mIU/ml <br>  25 - 40 weeks LMP: 3,640 - 117,000 mIU/ml <br>  Non-pregnant females: <5.0 mIU/ml <br>  Postmenopausal: <9.5 mIU/ml <br>  * These numbers are just a GUIDELINE-- every woman’s level of hCG can rise differently. It is not necessarily the level that matters but rather the change in the level.<br>  <br>  What can a low hCG level mean?<br>  A low hCG level can mean any number of things and should be re-tested within 48-72 hours to see how the level is changing. A low hCG level could indicate:<br>  <br>  Miscalculation of pregnancy dating <br>  Possible miscarriage or blighted ovum <br>  Ectopic pregnancy <br>  What can a high hCG level mean?<br>  A high level of hCG can also mean a number of things and should be re-tested within 48-72 hours to evaluate changes in the level. A high hCG level can indicate:<br>  <br>  Miscalculation of pregnancy dating <br>  Molar pregnancy <br>  Multiple pregnancy <br>  Should my hCG level be checked routinely?<br>  It is not common for doctors to normally re-check your hCG levels unless you are showing signs of a possible problem. A health care provider may re-check your levels if you are bleeding, having severe cramping or have a history of miscarriage.<br>  <br>  What can I expect of my hCG levels after a pregnancy loss?<br>  Most women can expect their levels to return to a non-pregnant range about 4 - 6 weeks after a pregnancy loss has occurred. This can differentiate by how the loss occurred (spontaneous miscarriage, D & C procedure, abortion, natural delivery) and how high the levels were at the time of the loss. Health care providers usually will continue to test hCG levels after a pregnancy loss to ensure they return back to <5.0<br>  <br>  Can anything interfere with my hCG levels? <br>  Nothing should interfere with an hCG level except medications that contain hCG. These medications are often used in fertility treatments, and your health care provider should advise you on how they may affect a test. All other medications such as antibiotics, pain relievers, contraception or other hormone medications should not have any effect on a test that measures hCG. Early Pregnancy Test normal hCG levels and hCG Information<br>               HCG is an abbreviation and the full name is: "Human Chorionic Gonadotropin", the "pregnancy hormone" which is being produced by the placenta as soon as implantation happens about one week after fertilization and ovulation. As soon as the embryo implants and the placenta attaches to the uterine lining, hCG enters the circulation as eventually is excreted into the urine.<br>  One single hCG value does not tell you much about the viability of the pregnancy and there is a wide range of normal hCG levels in pregnancy. A normal hCG rise over several days prior to 6 weeks of the pregnancy usually indicates a viable pregnancy. In general, the best indication of a healthy pregnancy other than a normal rise of hCG is a good fetal heartbeat after 6-7 weeks. <br>  There is a wide range of normal hCG levels and values and the values are different in blood serum or urine. <br>  Urine hCG levels are usually lower than serum (blood) hCG levels. <br>  <br>  *****Get discounted Pregnancy Tests from our sponsor HERE***** <br>  <br>  <br>  It's main function is to support the corpus luteum producing progesterone when conception occurs. hCG can be detected both in the urine and in the blood. In blood it's detected several days earlier than in the urine. <br>  See more hCG Q&As HERE<br>  Calculate your hCG levels HERE<br>  The blood hCG test measures the HCG quantitatively, which means you get a number for the test, and the units measured are usually mIU/mL. <br>  <br>  hCG under 5 mIU/ml <br>   hCG between 5-25 mIU/ml<br>   hCG over 25 mIU/ml <br>   <br>  Negative. Not pregnant<br>   "Equivocal". Maybe pregnant maybe not. Repeat test in a couple of days<br>   You are pregnant!<br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  Blood hCG testing is much more sensitive than a urine HPT. This means that the blood test can detect pregnancy several days earlier than the urine test, as early as 10 days after fertilization, 3-4 days after implantation. <br>  hCG is measured in milli-international units per milliliter (mIU/ml). <br>  Urine tests measure the urine HCG qualitatively, which means that the HPT results are either "positive" or "negative." Around the time of the first missed period (14+ days after ovulation), over 95% of HPTs are usually positive. <br>  About 85% of normal pregnancies will have the hCG level double every 48 - 72 hours. As you get further along into pregnancy and the hCG level gets higher, the time it takes to double can increase to about every 96 hours. <br>  Caution must be used in making too much of hCG numbers. A normal pregnancy may have low hCG levels and deliver a perfectly healthy baby. The results on an ultrasound after 5 - 6 weeks gestation are much more accurate than using hCG numbers. <br>  An hCG of less than 5 mIU/cc  is usually negative, over 25 mIU/cc usually positive, between 5 and 25 mIU/cc  it's "equivoval" which simply means we don't know. <br>  A transvaginal ultrasound should be able to see at least a gestational sac once the hCG levels have reached between 1,000 - 2,000mIU/ml. Because levels can differentiate so much and conception dating can be wrong, a diagnosis should not be made by ultrasound findings until the level has reached at least 2,000. <br>  A single hCG reading is not enough information for most diagnoses. When there is a question regarding the health of the pregnancy, multiple testings of hCG done a couple of days apart give a more accurate look at assessing the situation. <br>  hCG levels should not be used to date a pregnancy since these numbers can vary so widely. <br>  There are two common types of hCG tests. A qualitative hCG test just looks to see if hCG is present in the blood. A quantitative hCG test (or beta hCG) measures the amount of hCG actually present in the blood. <br>  Other than for the diagnosis of pregnancy, hCG is also often monitored over time for reasons such as monitoring after a miscarriage, monitoring an ectopic pregnancy, and after a condition called "H.mole." <br>  The first detection of hCG in the blood depends on when implantation happens. Extremely sensitive tests which are not available in a regular laboratory can detect the hCG even before implantation. But with regular laboratory hCG tests, hCG is usually found in sufficient levels as early as 2-3 days after implantation. <br>  Implantation happens as early as 6 days after ovulation/fertilization (usually about 9 days after ovulation), so blood hCG can be found as early as 8-9 days after ovulation/fertilization.<br>  Pregnant women usually attain blood serum concentrations of at least 10-50 mIU/cc in the 7-8 days following implantation. <br>  An equivocal test of  between 5 and 25 mIU/cc requires a repeat within 2-3 days. If if goes higher then that's a good sign, but if it goes lower or stays about the same then that's a sign that the pregnancy has failed <br>  HCG monitoring is useful to assess the pregnancy before the fetal heart is seen (before 6-7 weeks after LMP), ususally to rule out an ectopic pregnancy or an early miscarriage <br>  In an ectopic pregnancy, hCG increases at lower rates than in a normal pregnancy <br>  In a noviable pregnancy it also rises slower  <br>  At hCG levels above 1,000-1,500 mIU/ml, vaginal sonography usually identifies the presence of an intrauterine pregnancy <br>  Within the first 2-4 weeks after fertilization, hCG usually doubles every 48-72 hours <br>  An increase of 60% in 48 hours is still considered normal <br>  Below 1,200 mIU/ml, hCG usually doubles every 48-72 hours <br>  Between 1,200 and 6,000 mIU/ml serum, the hCG usually takes 72-96 hours to double <br>  Above 6,000 mIU/ml, the hCG often takes over four days to double <br>  More than two in three normal pregnancies have a doubling of the hCG every 72 hours <br>  There is a wide variation of normal hCG levels. An hCG that does not double every two to three days does not necessarily indicate a problem <br>  A maximum level is usually reached by the 10th or 11th week. <br>  After 10 weeks or so, hCG normally decreases <br>  Normal hCG values vary up to 20 times between different pregnancies <br>  A single hCG value doesn't give enough information about the viability of the pregnancy <br>  Pregnancies that will miscarry and ectopic (tubal) pregnancies are likely to show lower levels and slower rises, but often have normal levels initially <br>  Some normal pregnancies will have quite low levels of hCG -- and deliver perfect babies <br>  Once fetal activity has been detected by ultrasound in a normal patient population, chances of normal delivery are about 95% <br>  Normal levels of hCG can vary tremendously. After 5-6 weeks of pregnancy, sonogram findings are much more predictive of pregnancy outcome than are HCG levels. Once the fetal heart rate is seen, most doctors will monitor the fetal heart rate rather than drawing hCG <br>  After hCG injections (Profasi, Pregnyl) to trigger ovulation or to lengthen the luteal phase, trace amounts of hCG can remain in the body as long as 14 days or longer after the last hCG injection. This may give a false positive on a pregnancy test. <br>  Two consecutive quantitative hCG beta blood tests can determine whether the hCG is from an injection or pregnancy. If the hCG level increases by the second test, you are likely pregnant <br>  See more hCG Q&As HERE.<br>  <br>  <br>  Updated: 3/18/2007 3:49:00 PM|`|3acdd8aec4a5f567650bcf6d92c6a661aa	I can't remember the levels, but my sister had similar problems! Her doctor old her she had been pregnant with twins and lost one of them. The baby that survived is now almost 2! So it's possible that you are still pregnant! Good luck, and sorry I can't remember what her levels were!
r3KR0ajfaa	Sorry. No story yet. Can you give me nine months? Around/on March 8, I'll have an unassisted birth story. I'm really excited about it. If you want to read some unassisted birth stories, join the Yahoo group c-birth. There have been some amazing ones lately.<br>  <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/c-birth/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/c-birth/</a>|`|33275086185ca6d9894364b1f99c435faa	Although it wouldn't be my choice I think that if you have a VERY low risk pregnancy it would be ok... <br>  <br>  I had planned to have my daughter using an alternative birthing center with a midwife as my practitioner. I was very lucky to have such an amazing midwife and a midwife on her last day of internship when I went into labor! They were wonderful, and very supportive. They were also very well trained and able to see when things were going wrong. Thankfully the alternative birthing center that I used was attached to a hospital since after a 30 hour HARD labor I ended up having to have a c-section. Had I gone with less qualified midwives or tried it at home my daughter and I would be dead now... I guess that's why I am definately planning a hospital birth for this pregnancy with twins! <br>  <br>  Just so you know, I was devistated when things didn't go as planned, and I still wonder if things could have been different. It was not until this pregnancy that I have gotten beyond the feeling of being less of a woman for not being able to go naturally. This time around I am planning for my ideal experience, and will also know that things don't always go as planned. As long as I have 2 healthy baby boys at the end the birth was a sucess!|`|AA12073024	Unfortunately for me this is not an option for me.  I do personally know a dr. who did an unassisted birth; obviously she has some training, her husband was there with her as well.  Everything went fine and the baby was very healthy.  <br>  There IS more bacteria present in the hospital than in the home, as I learned after getting a rather nasty hospital infection.<br>  Women have been having unassisted births for THOUSANDS of years.  Women still have unassisted births all the time.<br>  Just see a dr. or a midwife to make sure that the pregnancy is normal and there are no complications beforehand.  <br>  You are doing the right thing by researching like you are!<br>  Good Luck!|`|GjeKJVo7aa	Sorry i dont have one. thought about it but decided not to in the end. maybe next time?<br>  TO KAT- Why are you letting the dactor tell you what to do with your body and your baby?! if the doctor isnt listening to you find one who does. Its very important that you feel able to follow your heart/instincts. Not being in control can be a factor in causing post natal depression. and just generally being unhappy about your birth experience:(|`|cebac9a9fdb5738e1c4f5532e30fff77aa	ok here goes my youngest daughter was born in the next door neighbours house no assistance just people running around panicking me just havinga baby on the floor before ambulance or midwife got there|`|7823a3ee0872a6ae329f9b447fd183a5aa	ok i dont have one. BUT, i can tell you i do have 3 kids and one on the way and the dr's wouldnt even consider it. apparently women are meant to have babies in hospitals hooked up to all kinds of different machines, cant walk around, no pain medication, if you yell they tell you to be quiet, i hate it!!! but there is something called hypnobirthing the mongan method you should try! i think it would be great for a home birth. its all about no drugs natural birthing and you being in charge of it. give it a try if you can.

BycuwSsmaa	Usually the moms or her best friend throws the shower. The registry is a gift list done at a store like babies r us, target, or walmart etc,. If you ask at the customer service desk they will show you how to use it. It's pretty cool, you pick out what you want in the store. People who want to get the baby a gift can see what you picked out on a store prinout or online. It's great becuase you can pick out what you two like most for baby. Things like bottles, bibs, cute clothes.|`|81b1023f127872bce7a554e429084022aa	Find a location, invite friends and family, get decorations and food or catering...and YES you get gifts, but they're for the baby! LOL hope this helps|`|aS8S5fLqaa	a friend is supposed to do it|`|BKyFxjeBaa	HER mother and FRIENDS throw the shower.

0K1OSeOkaa	The ONLY ways to really know if you are ovulating is by either <br>  <br>  1: An ovulation Prediction Kit<br>  2: having the doc check to be sure you are ovulating<br>  or the most natural and obvious way that is free and easy for you to figure out on your own is<br>  3: You shoud print out a BBT chart.  it is always good to chart your basal body temp which is taken every morning at the same time before you even sit up.  Besides this, on the chart is an area to note your cervical fluids and position.  If you note this every day you can see when you are approaching ovulation or when you have ovulated.  Your body tells you the best.  <br>  <br>  Right after your period you will be pretty much dry for a few days...then it will turn sticky and a little bit more will be present.  Then it will turn creamy like lotion and be a little thicker.  You are now approaching the fertile stage.  I start intercourse here so be sure I dont miss it.  Next you will probably notice a watery type of fluid (although not all women get the watery type).  You are now fertile.  Then, you will see an Egg White type of fluid.  It is clear usually, may have a slight tinge of pink or something to it.  It really resembles snot or eggwhites.  It stretches between your fingers just like egg whites or snot would.  When you notice this you are the most fertile.  After this goes away, you are in your not fertile stage again.  If you are trying to concieve, start intercourse BEFORE you see the watery or ew type of fluid.  Once you notice the ew type, it may be too late as by time the sperm reaches the egg, the egg may die off.  I cannot tell you when you have ovulated this month, but if y ou start this on a regular basis, you will know when you are going to ovulate or are ovulating in the months to come.  Some resources to look over and study are listed below..<br>  You can also down load a program such as hormonal forcaster which aids you, but i find it easier to understand if I chart it myself with pen and paper.  Plus I am sure that the right things are marked.  Good luck and much baby dust to you.|`|7024760d479bfe555dcdaaad8b2b2ed2aa	If your period was on 4/1 and now you got it again on 4/29, you are on a 28 days cycle which is normal to many women. As far your ovulation goes count from the 9th day from the start of your period to the 19th day. This is your ovulation time. If you do not want to conceive stay away from sex from the 8th to the 20th day from the start of your period.This has worked for me.|`|RZm0TJXUaa	The person 2 above me is wrong, just so you know. <br>  <br>  You are on a 28 day cycle, so since you had your period on April 29th, you count back 14 days from April 29th and that is when you ovulated. So you ovulated on the 15th of April. So if you dont wanna become pregnant, dont have sex on the 12th-19th and you will be fine.|`|aa3575c111d8a1873992b88a8bbb4641aa	around april 20th......14 days after April 6th.

OMyC0IJVaa	The corner has always gotten to my daughter the most. And I did have to hold her there quite a few times. The main thing is only 1 warning and stick to it. And whatever he throws I would take away and put up where he can see it but not have it for at least 1 day and night, even if it is a cup it will teach him not to throw it or he will loose it.  We have also taken 5 things instead of 1 away at a time again put it where he can see it, and stick to 1 day and 1 night, one time she had 20 things taken in one day (she has a lot of stuffed animals), it takes consistancy, it took her a good month to month and a half (she is incredibly stubborn but also a sweetheart) but she eventually got it. <br>  <br>  Hang in there! There were many times I cried as hard as she did, but dont give in or you will set yourself back a mile.|`|1e6ccc44c78c6b96e9e3df456cfe562faa	Do not let your child hit you, if you let him do it now he will do it later.

You don't play with mean kids, tell him.  This will stop.|`|IwH9RAHkaa	Join the club - We've got jackets!!  My newly two year old is really exhausting our patience as well.  Like you we have tried everything!  I have asked several people and the main response is to try to give him extra attention.  Do you have other children?  We have a five year old boy also and sometimes they play nicely together other times it's full on war.  We try to give the two year old individual time just for him.  Sometimes it works - it will mellow him out. <br>  We also enrolled him into swimming classes and gym classes  and the extra activities makes him to tired to be naughty and it gaurantees us a full nights sleep!  So try a gym class or swim class and see if that helps.<br>  <br>  We still stick to the time out so that at least it's consistant.  He knows where his naughty chair is! <br>  But be patient and just think that this phase will not last forever!! <br>  Try this website if you get a chance|`|PoK2uOS0aa	Try reading the book 1-2-3 Magic by Dr. Thomas Phelan.

Rather than trying to punish away misbehavior, think of discipline as a teaching tool. And keep in mind that there are two things your child needs in order to learn what you want her to: Ability and motivation.<br>  <br>  Say your 2-year-old refuses to pick up her toys when you ask her to, and you give her a time-out. What has she learned? To pick up her toys? To follow directions? In fact, she's probably learned neither. Instead of giving her a time-out, try approaching the situation as a teaching task — you're going to teach her how to pick up her toys when you ask. Start by making a game of following directions. Warmly say to her, "Come to me!" and give her a hug or kiss when she does. Once she gets the idea, move on to teaching her how to pick up her toys. Make it fun, too: "You walk the dolls over to the shelf, and I'll help them jump up into their places." Now she has both the ability and the motivation to complete the task.<br>  <br>  Teaching your child self-discipline requires ability and motivation on your part too. It's a process that takes know-how, time, and energy — but the payoff is well worth it.

joHLiIzIaa	Not unless you were actually trying to do it on purpose. That bag of water is very thick. You cannot rupture it with just your fingers. Almost all woman have sex throughout their entire pregnancy. It doesn't harm the baby!|`|322206d55c7830caeac75028ac7e109caa	It is possible, but you shouldn't be doing it.|`|408643caa32ae504e179efb9be1c8bd7aa	I think so, but it's not a good idea to TRY to rupture them since you could end up with a serious infection.

faf8a6a5ea3f6521ee896679afa79005aa	I am also 35 weeks pregnant and this week, I have noticed a heavier vaginal discharge with cervical mucus in it.  This thick, yellow blood-streaked mucus plug or very light vaginal bleeding is considered to be an early sign of impending labor and can occur a few weeks, days, or hours before contractions begin. I will see the doc on Tuesday to make sure everything is alright since he wants to induce me on April 20th.  Good luck!|`|86a28e8b246ea517e3f8eeaa896ece0baa	This is your mucus plug,and you should probably inform your doctor.Being that you are thirty five weeks pregnant I would say congratulations your cervix has begun to spreed which means you are dilating,which is why the mucus plug is dropping out.|`|22a8c1d5b8eeaebe67354dfd7c888438aa	i think discharge is common esp towards the end... if your worried talk to your midwife about it. otherwise since theres no blood i think its just normal for pregnant women. im 20 weeks and i have recently started to get some discharge too.. from the books ive read its seems common.. good luck!|`|408643caa32ae504e179efb9be1c8bd7aa	Discharge during pregnancy is completely normal as long as you do not have discomfort or blood and it isn't foul smelling.  It tends to get heavier as the pregnancy progresses.  Mucus plug is usually actual chunks, so you will notice a difference between that and discharge.<br>  <br>  Good luck, you don't have long now!|`|f3e9f8acbfeb5201739431ca47213695aa	Get ready. Your baby will be here within a week! That's what happened to me my first pregnancy. no blood, just mucus.
372ef480cc9ec2f1e0772af02121cb9eaa	At my 20 week ultrasound, I had the same thing.Mine was covering the cervix completely.  Don't worry about it because my dr told me that I still had alot of growing to do at that point and the placenta would probably move. I am almost 32 weeks now and I have to go back for another ultrasound to see if it has moved. If it has then that is great. The worse case would be you would have to have a c section. The condition is called PLACENTA PREVIA look it up and read about it.  That is what I did and got alot of my answers that way. As far as the baby moving... I also had the same thing and I called the dr and he told me to go in to the hospital to get monitored. I did. The baby was moving around ALOT I just couldn't feel them but could hear them on the monitor.. it was weird. But to be on the safe side I would call your dr. Good luck with everything.|`|408643caa32ae504e179efb9be1c8bd7aa	20 weeks is too early to get very worried about a low lying placenta.  Most of the time they move upwards as the pregnancy progresses.<br>  <br>  As far as the baby kicking:  Drink a sugary beverage (pop, koolaide, juice, etc.) and have a lie down.  The sugar should get the baby moving a bit.  If not, call your doctor.  Don't worry, though, at 20 weeks babies are still pretty tiny and if they get turned around to the back you will not feel them move at all.  I'd be a lot more concerned if you were 34 weeks and hadn't felt the baby move.  At 20 weeks most people are still only feeling the baby move every few days any way.|`|AA12195903	I had a low lying placenta when at my 20 week ultrasound with my first son as well.  The doctor told me that it is common especially in first pregnancy's.  He said it will fix its self later on and if it doesn't then the baby will be delivered by C-Section.  I had another ultrasound at 28 weeks and everything was where it was suppose to be.  so chances are you will be fine as well!!  As for the baby not kicking as much, That is common this early along.  They still sleep a lot and will get more active as he or she grows and there is less and less room in your womb.   Good luck and dont worry!|`|VVy042W7aa	go to the doctor!  my doc always said if I suspected something wasn't right, to call him.  Mother's intution.|`|AA12254559	A low lying placenta at this stage isn't really something to worry about. The placenta can move up as your uterus gets bigger, so I wouldn't worry right now. <br>  <br>  As far as the baby kicking, right now, it's possible to not feel it for a few days. Try this. Drink or eat something sweet like fruit or fruit juice and lay on your left side for between a half hour to an hour. The sugar will give the baby a boost, and with you laying down on your side, you are more able to feel it. If you don't feel anything after that time, call your doctor, but it is normal to not feel anything at this point for a few days.

A lady at my church constantly complained about how uncomfortable she was during her pregnancy and she didn't even look pregnant!  The rest of us rolled our eyes.  She finally out grew her regular size jeans 2 weeks before her due date and just wore sweats.  Disgusting!  Well, she ended up going a week over and never did look more than 4 months pregnant.  Her baby weighed 9 lbs. and was 21 inches long!  Afterward we all felt bad for rolling our eyes at her discomfort...she HAD to be uncomfortable with all that baby packed inside instead of hanging out front!<br>  <br>  All of that to say that your belly size is not necessarily indicative of the baby's size.  Check with your OB, but don't stress it!
408643caa32ae504e179efb9be1c8bd7aa	Did you have a D&C or pass the baby without medical assistance?  Especially if you did NOT have a D&C, I'd check with your OBgyn because you could still have tissue in the uterus that you are trying to pass and this could cause a severe infection.  If you are worried about pregnancy, just go get a home test so that you can know for sure.  If you continue to have bloody discharge, though, please call you doc.|`|217cc9d47e17d169d8e5d9dadf144762aa	It could just be the leftovers from the miscarriage.

d7d1ccf776323a9505b5b97b2ff42398aa	Hi! My daughter did exactly the same thing at that age! Basically she is exploring her tongue and lips as funny as it sounds. She is now able to actually feel and control those movements on her own accord and she will do it over and over. You could try to stop her from it but I doubt it will do much good and will only confuse her. <br>  <br>  The best way to treat the rash (which is very common and nothing to worry about), is to keep it as dry as possible. A bib can help prevent the rash from spreading to the neck area as well. Use a clean damp washcloth. Gently wipe the area and allow a minute for it to dry. Then apply a tiny amount of diaper rash cream to the rash area. The best cream to use is the plain old cheap stuff that you find at dollar general stores or your local grocery store. Johnson & Johnson 3-in-1 diaper rash cream worked good for me because my daughter had really sensitive skin. Target and Wal-Mart brands are just as good too and have the same ingredients. Try this and if it doesn't work then ask your pediatrician about it. My pharmacist really helped me a lot with tips on infant care and prevented unnecessary trips to the doctor. The rash cream might look funny for a day or two but it really does work and should clear up within two days.Hope I helped you.|`|52RxUbOiaa	Her gums just itch! You should try to stop her by givin' her a teething ring!!|`|MhAtJDDvaa	start using a teether. my son does the same thing. its not a rash its just from her sucking on it alot. its ok. just put a teether in the fridge and give it to her. you can also try a pacifier.

Maybe next time your friend will wear a condom and not be so stupid.|`|7x8zwD6vaa	Abortion is safe if you do it in the first month or so. 5 or so on is very dangerous because it's fully grown.

AA12073024	Castor oil can help induce labor... but there are a couple of cons to it.  The 1st side effect is diarrhea (which causes the second side effect: dehydration and may be the actual reason it works) neither condition is particularly lovely during labor. <br>  The most safe and natural way to induce labor is vaginal intercourse... the hormones that your body releases help trigger contractions and the chemicals in the semen also help induce labor (pig semen is what is in prostheglandin; the suppository used to medically induce labor... personally the natural way is much more appealing!)<br>  Besides, you don't want your baby born too early... even at 37 weeks, the lungs may not be completely developed, and you have have problems like not being able to breathe without machines, pneumonia, and or RSV.|`|be9f617f5a598e41354941dbb40d5e3eaa	no and I wouldn't take castrol oil while being pregnant either.|`|YQ3ZWhmeaa	I have heard of some who swear it worked. I have also heard that all it does is causes you severe cramps caused from the runs. Doesn't sound good to me. I had lots of sex to induce labor with my first. It made my stomache contract and 12 hours after here was my baby.|`|0bIFvqCLaa	hi,<br>  i answered your ? a while ago.... i did twice and yes it works and it is safe....<br>  but you have to be ready.<br>  you said you were dialated!!!<br>  so yes it will work...<br>  im 34 weeks now with number4 and by week 37 or 38 i will take it......<br>  read my first answer... for more detail....<br>  good luck|`|5VzWdQZLaa	I've heard of this being done...tried it myself, but I didn't want to take to much so I apparently took just enough to just run to the bathroom and not to the hospital! DUH!  I hear also that it can cause horrible cramping during labor in addition to contrations....Now who wants that?<br>  <br>  Best of luck sweetie.|`|d76655635211c4ce11cd9ca45c2e9c10aa	Why would you want to indice labor at 37 weeks already? If your doctor wanted you to deliver early then he or she would have packed you to the hospital already and have you induced.<br>  Be patient. Your little one will come soon enough. Enjoy your last 3 weeks of peace and quiet and without responsibilities. Because these will be the last 3 weeks you'll have for yourself (i.e. me, myself and just me!) for the next several dozens of years...|`|7GM6LH5oaa	I will be honest if the baby is ready it will come. I debated on taking it with my last baby and I was about 36.5 wks. Dying of pain but still waited 39 wks before I was induced and not a fun experience. My daughter still wasn't ready when I went in a 6 that morning so you could take it and have no results except spending a day or two in the bathroom. If you really want that cervix to open quickly, everytime you have a contraction hold on to something and squat, it will hurt but you will help that baby down with gravity and you will work those hips to stretch. Good luck to you~~~|`|PnxUgwI7aa	that is an old wives tale. plus it is very nasty|`|cCpK6jcHaa	castor oil has worked for some but look at this equation and yes this has happened before<br>  <br>  CASTOR OIL = DIARRHEA = SPRAYING THE DOCTOR  AND MAYBE OTHERS<br>  <br>  EMBARRASSING I WOULDN'T DO IT|`|hKi0XuRRaa	Yes, at night and was in labor the next morning, Not trying to get down to the nitty gritty here, but I also had sex that night a few times, make sure you have an orgasm, it helps trigger labor. I think it was the combo that put me into labor. <br>  <br>  Although, I would like to tell you, if your baby isn't ready yet, he/she won't come til he/she is ready.<br>  <br>  Congrats and Good Luck!|`|j1SiWOkKaa	no, but i have heard different stories about it...for some it has worked, and for others it hasn't...but it gave them all bad diarreah|`|xFP34JrPaa	When my Mom was pregnant with me, the doctor told her to put it in Coca-Cola and sip it slowly through a straw.

I also was told that I was not pregnant until i reached 7wks, but I new I was pregnant I just had to convince my doctor I was. That is when he sent me for a blood test and It came back positive. <br>  Good luck|`|AzmVX3phaa	your pg go see a doc so he can take a blood test ! i dont think that theres test that show a false positive but also u commented that after 45 min thats too long of  a wait try testing with a first response no cheap pg test|`|GW27wXDOaa	There are no false positives (unless you are taking hormones - hcg- to help conceive).  The only thing that changes a pregnancy test positive is hcg- a hormone secreted only when pregnant.  The differences betwee positive and negative could be different tests, or could be over testing- hcg builds up in your urine, and the more you urinate, the less the concentration.  Make a doc appt!  Congrats!

Also, you can't really know you're pregnant a week after you'v done your thing, so at 11 wks (d8td 4m ur LMP) u can bettr find out where u lie. But definitely get a different doctor.

Mostly how you are carryingthe baby. If you carry high it is supposed to be a boy and if you carry low it is suppoed to be a girl. There is also some thing about hertburn but I can't remember. Are you going to find out on an ultrasound? Good Luck and have a great pregnancy!!|`|AA12284594	All I know is that have someone look at you from your back and let them see if you look pregnant. If they can see different kinds of curves than what you had before pregnancy, then it is a girl. If it looks like it's all on the front of your body, then it is a boy. My mum told me this and she's delivered lots of babyz. but try having a doctor tell you. Best of Luck!
A6MFwe0Taa	Its definitely worth getting checked to see why you've been feeling sick for so long.<br>  <br>  As for the breastfeeding, its not too late to get a good lactation consultant or La Leche League leader to help get the baby latched on. Nursing from the breast will be much easier for you.<br>  <br>  Also, if your iron is low try Floradix iron + herbs. It is much easier on the stomach than the stuff docs usually give you and it works great. You can find it at a health food store/natural market.|`|2JkeD3Gaaa	Call your doctor or go to the hospital.

a19e78a9bb9de477a5b7313049dd2c65aa	It happened to my friend who recently got married.. They initially plan to enjoy their first 2yrs together before family planning. They avoided sex during her predicted fertile days (day 14-16) and had sex on day 18. Wham!  Before she know it, she is preggy with a baby girl..|`|5GcCl5rRaa	I had the same question I'll let you know what i get but so far ive gotten the answer yes. good luck|`|ri96In0vaa	I miscarried in April, ovulated right on schedule 2 weeks later and am now 16 weeks pregnant. And get this, I only have one ovary. The other was removed when I was 14 because of ovarian cysts. Another interesting fact, is that you can conceive days after you have sex. If the cervical mucous is just right the sperm can live for more than 5 days after you have sex. They just hang out in the fallopian tubes and wait for the egg to pop out. Also, there are studies that show that women may be more fertile than normal the first few months after a miscarriage. If you have an irregular cycle you can always buy an ovulation test kit at the store to determine when you ovulate if you want to know the exact day. Miscarriages aren't any fun, but the good news is you can get pregnant, so just relax, and get to baby-making. Good luck and may the stork be with you.|`|mTQ2HKYXaa	Well considering your body does not follow an exact schedule than it is possible. You can chart all you want but you body changes monthly. Nothing drastically but it can fluctuate. It is always possible. I had a miscarriage in April and my cycle is so crazy since then. Nothing yet, good luck.
kudupKRPaa	I love being a SAHM! Some days are hard and tiring but all in all it is great! I do not dis moms that work though! I know some of them would love to stay home but can not because of finances and some just love their jobs. Good for them but I am happy taking care of my children and their needs.|`|2fIkWVt4aa	I love being a SAHM...... I get to spend all my time with my kids when they are not in school. I get to see all the new accomplishments of my 2 year old son. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.a-mommys-world.com/smf" rel="nofollow">http://www.a-mommys-world.com/smf</a>|`|GeHZnTCJaa	I do love it, but it's not always easy and it's not always fun - but this is my work now and I would not prefer to go out to work, no.<br>  <br>  I was ready to take a career break to dedicate my time to bringing up our children and i work hard at it - i try to achieve a balance between keeping the house and interacting with the girls and ensuring they are doing purposeful activities and maintaining a certain social life for myself during the day with them or I'd go insane.<br>  <br>  I find the lack of financial independence hard, I find the endless houework tedious and depressing and I struggle with organisation but hey, it's all part of the job!!|`|U5cZsnPBaa	I want to be a SAHD.  I have dreams of the PTA, Soccer coaching, Gymastics, grocery and clothes shopping.  It beats pretending to work while asnwering these questions all day.|`|cdMxF65uaa	i am a sahm, and i love it!! i just have one son 8 months, and i just started a home daycare because i really need the extra money to make ends meet, but for the past 6 months it was all about him. even now that i have other kids to care for, HE is always with me at "work" and i get to spend all day with him, i'm not going to miss his first word, or first step etc...<br>  to me there is no greater satisfaction! and if i didn't have to do daycare i wouldn't ...don't get me wrong, i love my job i'm a school teacher by trade and i like working with kids-but it's still a job.|`|pkkXVXkyaa	You know I took the whole summer off, and was looking foward to going back to work next week, but I had this whole week with jus me and my 2 year old! Im not going back! EVER! I never thought I would want to stay home, but I do!|`|qgpwxkQMaa	i love being a sahm, it is the best job in the world.<br>  if i couldn't see my kids all the time or raise them the way i wanted to here at home with me, then there would be no point in me having any children.|`|PoK2uOS0aa	I love being a SAHM, but yes there are times I do miss the grown up interaction from working.

N9W5dbTIaa	Vent away! There's no reason for people to judge. People come here for help, to get questions answered and to hear what other people are going through. <br>  If you're talking about YA people being judgemental, I really don't see a reason why someone can't just answer the question and move on. You're doing the best you can with what you have and that should be enough!<br>  And if it's other people around you, none of their business. Grrrr sometimes I just hate people! :)|`|AA12253486	becuase that's what most people do look at a sitituation from the outside and judge with out knowing the whole story it's life don't worry about it. Just do your best. What your son thinks of you is all that should matter to you.|`|72cc6d9cc7f385aaf9fc6e65c2285c59aa	If you don't want people to be judgmental don't put yourself out on a public forum and ask people to offer their opinions. |`|8cfQwsC8aa	People just are when it comes to pregnancy.  Like we dont know the restraints and hard work involved.  Im in a relationship with my partner and think of myself as a young mum to be (24) although prob not as young as others but i have help from my mum.  Even the oldest, wisest person is gonna need some help at being a first time mum.  Its a whole new experiance and i think parents want to help anyway because its their grandchild and its an exciting time for them too.  My mum has spoilt my daughter rotten and she isnt even born yet. <br>  I think you are doing fine hun and hats off to you for working hard for your baby.  Your gonna be a great mum im sure.  |`|JckjSvaDaa	Haha it's OK to vent! Girls need to vent! its what we do! I'm sorry that people are judgmental. They should be supporting you. You know you made the mistake of having sex at a young age, without being married. People need to forgive and forget. I would recommend giving the child up for adoption, since it would be the bundle of joy's best interest, but it's your choice. It may be his best interest to stay with you!!! which is good to hear.  If you think you are ready to handle the baby, then God bless you. Blessings to you and the baby. :) |`|SZeq6Ruoaa	There are allot of young moms out there and some people believe that you should be married before you have a baby or that you need to be much older then 20. I on the other hand was 19 when i was pregnant with my son and was 20 when i delivered too. Im now 21 and i think its the maturity of the person who is about to become the mom that should matter most. My advice to people if your not living the life then why do you care so much. There's a pregnancy site  called i-am-pregnant.com take a look at it, its for moms of all ages however most are young on this site.. ranging from 14 to 30's you get to decorate your own page, and talk to many moms who are going threw the same thing as you. |`|t4XZ8Lxkaa	Don't worry about what other people think about you. I got pregnant my first time at 17. I left the guy before I found I was pregnant for sure and when I did he had a whole different story. He started telling everyone I slept with so and so and it wasn't his. He went as far as to wish death on the baby and allowed his new girl to call my baby a bastered. It pissed me off yes and I acted like a 17 year old would but he knew and I knew what happened. She was born and we had the DNA test done (which he paid for b/c he was the only one with doubts) and it came back of course the only way expected. He still hasn't done a thing for her and she is 27 months. I lived with my parents till she was one and was on medicaid with her. My parents helped and then I met this guy who is now my husband and we are expecting our lil girl any day now. I don't give a d*** what he thinks or anyone else thinks b/c she is loved and taken care of and the ONLY one missing out on her life is him. Good Luck you will do great and this baby will change your life |`|LWzrCu5caa	My only judgment is that the father should pay child support.   Even if you stick the money in the bank and save it for college,  it will help improve the life of his child.   <br>  <br>  I do not believe guys should get to play with pay.    |`|Ezkn5azdaa	I don't know why either. I do understand you. I am also single mom of two boys and expecting my third November 28 with a girl. I know a lot people look at me or anything. The only thing I am getting is medicaid has well. I had my first son was I was 20. He is 6 year old and I have a four year old. I am 27 year old and been do so well without any help. But I am in a new wonderful relationship. He not the father of this baby. But he wants to adopt all three of my kids and wants to be the father of all three. He going buy things for this baby.|`|sD15UEgeaa	It's in people's nature to judge, usually before knowing the facts. There is no reason why you won't be a great mother. Stereotyping and prejudice is something we are all surrounded by and need to just get used to! One of my good friends from college got pregnant at 18 and her boyfriend ran quicker than Usain Bolt, but she always says having a kid changed her life completely for the better. I hope your experience turns out to reflect hers!|`|UtvBfdR3aa	I have been in your shoes- I am also pregnant, not with the father and thinking about trying to get some government help.  They think they can be rude because of the anonimity of the internet- no consequences for being rude or mean.  They are getting out their own anger on you like they did on me when I asked some questions.<br>  <br>  It's not right.... but instead, just feel sorry for them that they are so miserable with themselves that they have to hurt someone else to make themselves feel better.|`|ca9dEvSAaa	I agree! I had some woman on here yelling at me about being on medi-cal! She doesnt' know me. Some people really need to grow up and realize if pregnancy happens on protection (broken condom) and we CHOSE NOT to abort we do need help until things get settled. I agree with you 100%! I'm sorry for the idiots who answered your question.<br>  <br>  |`|P1xlrvAaaa	People assume that they know every thing.You need to just go on and continue what your doing focus on school and your son.Don't worry about any one else or what they think bc it will drive you nuts.I personally feel that if you are or are not on public aid makes no difference.People see that that you are young and just start to presume to know your life story.Just worry about you and your child and forget about what any one else thinks.If the time should ever come that you do need a bit of public assistance take it and don't feel bad unless you abuse it!Good luck and congrats on baby!
ocwIcfzPaa	If there was an error, you need to get another one, read the instructions and do it again. |`|iAQKD2YBaa	I had the same question when I did my pregnancy test in August 2007. The second line was hardly visible, and guess what, I am about to celebrate my babies 6 month birthday at the end of October. To be absolutely certain, go to a doctor, they will do another test for you and also organizer a blood test as well. Good luck, hope the answer is what you want. |`|JGprkpxDaa	u could be, but if there was a error you should buy another one!! but for me...i took first response..and the test line was so faint you could barely see it..then i bought an ept and mine flashed pregnant but i too opened it and it was two lines also with one very very faint..and here i am now at 39 weeeks ready to pop!!<br>  <br>  it could have just been an invalid test, just buy another one..to be sure!!!|`|VtAiKvXiaa	like you say ,you could be. these things depend on time ,how far pregnant you think you are and how long you waite to get the correct test result. get another test to be sure or see your doctor.|`|5ZYoQWWlaa	LOL JUST TAKE ANOTHER TEST LOL
Hv6sGOt8aa	I am happy that you survived Roe vs. Wade. (it sucks!)  Anyway, in my opinion Bianca is a name that reminds of a confidant woman.|`|cSnrU8zHaa	honestly in my opinion, when i hear that name i think of a wealthy snotty person, although im sure thats not the case its just what comes to mind|`|F6aE4Pb0aa	well if youve ever seen the movie lars and the real girl with ryan gosling, he orders a "real doll" off the internet and names her bianca so i dont have positive associations with the name :))))|`|AA11489169	I picture EITHER a blonde snotty middle schooler OR a hot Latina woman|`|wC1zetqZaa	stuck up, spoiled, snotty, etc.|`|30IICrXgaa	a southerner|`|G1TesElYaa	stuck up, spoiled, think she's all that, brat|`|3HGBb7Qcaa	brown noser.. |`|mZi7R0Enaa	dark, exotic and sophisticated!|`|bzkSIJYnaa	I used to love this name!<br>  not so much anymore, it reminds me of a witch name...but i picture:<br>  <br>  a girl with a fair, smooth skin, of about 16.<br>  she has a skinny face, with prominant cheek bones.<br>  she has bright green eyes.<br>  she has black hair, and it's wavy and goes down to the middle of her torso.<br>  she is a bit mean and snobbish, but very smart. <br>  her parents are rich, and dont pay much attention to her.<br>  she is of French, Spanish, Italian, and Irish decent. <br>  <br>  |`|ZRQvrbtGaa	I may be biased, because I know a girl named Bianca who was kind of a slut and gothic. So that's what I immediatly associate with the name.<br>  <br>  But otherwise the characterisitcs that would pop in my mind are: Sophisticated, exotic, unique.|`|e4M4uQXNaa	Honestly, a totally stuck-up, haughty, btchy woman.

M5E3mDBJaa	My daughter used to do the "looking down" thing.  She held her head well, but her chin was almost always down to her chest.  She goes to physio therapy because she was a preemie and her therapist says this is pretty normal.  She gave us some exercises to do though.  One was to lay your baby on an angle and use a toy to coax baby to look up and down to strengthen the neck muscles.  You can also do this from side to side to see if your baby will keep the focus to or past the mid line.  By 3 months he should be able to focus from side to side ideally.  This is something you can mention to your pediatrician at your next visit.  But, I don't think it's much to worry about.  My physiotherapist also recommends a MINIMUM of 45 minutes of tummy time per day.  If they get mad that's actually a bit of a good thing because they start kicking their feet and picking their head up - it helps with muscle tone and these movements lead to rolling over etc.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|6b78493be9095e81afe291ca302d3ef1aa	Speaking for a mommy of 3 big headed boys lol it sounds normal. My sons have huge heads and took them awhile to lift their heads by themselves. My one son would try to pick his head up and the minute it was up plop it went back down lol. <br>  <br>  I think everything is okay but at the next doc appointment  just bring it up...|`|L89jDxo4aa	My brother was in a funny position in the womb as he was squashed as result of being a twin.<br>  He could hold his head up, but on one side seemed to hold it to one side. When he was one he started physio for this and it's fine now.
qgpwxkQMaa	there are lots of woman who actually miscarry and don't realize it because they think they are just having a more heavy period.<br>  its a possibility but no way to know for sure now.<br>  don't stress about it and keep trying you will succeed!<br>  good luck|`|AA10902123	nononononononononononononoo NO no NO no NO no NO no NO no NO no NO it was just a bad period. but dont worry someday youll have a baby maybe even sooner than u think keep trying and good luck.|`|i7EYX1Sjaa	It's always a possibility, Alot of pregnancies are lost in that first month after conception. However it is also just as likely that you just had a hormonal imbalance for any number of reasons that can cause the same symptoms even if you are very regular. Either way it sounds like you are okay.

EJOZ1pdLaa	He's an idiot. He should obviously be fine with going no matter if you were in labor, or had gas from a chili dog earlier. Don't worry about what the follow up to your argument is, it's basically written in stone that a husband will go to the hospital with his pregnant wife no matter what. Tell him to man up for once. Appearantly he's the one getting moody. |`|xCXmTVhAaa	Honestly Husbands don't know what we go through. He probably felt bad you were in pain and dosent know how to deal with it.

I am not sticking up for him tell him to chill and Just think of the benefits he gets from being there to see his own child born. And you are the one in pain not him.|`|yKZQS96paa	I never had braxton hicks towards the end of pregnancy, i only got some little ones at 30ish weeks, which didnt hurt, my tummy just went hard... but when i went into labour, i knew it was labour because the contractions were agony...you'll know the difference hun...the real thing is worse,<br>  anyways, as for your husband, i think its disgraceful him being like that with you at this time in your life. he should be supporting you!

It's obvious he doesn't listen to you.|`|wWcBW6dSaa	I don't wanna have kids with you, and I never will!|`|rpfYj8HGaa	I'm leaving you for your skinny no kid having sister!!|`|KnF1UNPLaa	your husband is being a jerk|`|SoxUsQ8Faa	wow you write a lot|`|L6e0M7DPaa	wow. that's really mean of him to be so selfish while your in pain. your the freaking pregnant one. he shouldn't complain. you have every right to... your carrying HIS child! he needs a serious reality check and just suck it up. you should show this reply to him.<br>  <br>  <br>  typical man.  <br>  <br>  <br>  you didn't do anything wrong. hope everything turns out great! :)|`|LkU8sXuJaa	yeah seriously, if he can't support you during ur pregnancy, then obviously he's no good. I would tell him to straiten up or leave. OR say " DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE HAVING A HUMAN BEING GROWING AND TRYING TO COME OUT OF YOU!!?? ITS NOT PLEASENT, SO GROW UP<br>  <br>  :)\<br>  ohh congrats on the baby |`|TvBGK1QLaa	Well that happened to me before during pregnancy to. except the next time I really went in labor which was 3 weeks before the due date. I called my sis to take me to the doc. and left him in the bed! I was really 6cm when I got their and up until this day he better be happy I called him...( I kinda still wish I didn't) since he probably would of told me I was over reacting if I told him that I though I may be in labor. |`|ZXhX78wsaa	Braxton Hicks contractions can begin as early as the second trimester, however they are most common in the third trimester. The muscles of your uterus tighten for approximately 30 to 60 seconds or as long as 2 minutes. Braxton Hicks are also called “practice contractions” because they will prepare you for the real thing and you can practice the breathing exercises you are learning in your childbirth classes. <br>  <br>  hopefully he will be a bit more understanding.<br>  <br>  Good luck hon!|`|agZS93lGaa	maybe he was just tired or in a bad mood. does he work all day or something? or is he always a jerk? if he's always like this maybe you should find a new support system like your best girlfriend or your mom or a sister. someone else you could call on if you need to make a trip to ER. you don't need him making you feel bad about something like this, i mean you are carrying his child. if my husband acted like that i would seriously kick him in his teeth.|`|w6VCE3vPaa	well he sounds like an asshole. tell him sorry you are concered about your babys health. if you are having contractions, its better to call the doc and go to the hospital than sit at home and do nothing about it. it doesnt sound to me like hes even ready to be a dad. if he is going to get mad because of a watsed hospital trip. you did the right thing. and he needs to open his eyes a little and not be so selfish. |`|bIhyeMJVaa	I can't understand this question.  use some punctuation |`|oojO4WAraa	He's an idiot.  If you are having contractions you need to go to the hosp. just to be sure the baby isn't coming.  Does he know how to deliver a baby?  Would he want you or the baby to die?  He's not a doctor and he has never been in labor.  Just ignore him and his stupidity.  When you need to go to the hospital speak up, if he won't take you find someone who will.  He will look like the jerk that he is.  Maybe you could have your mom or sister or girlfriend come stay until A) you have the baby, or B) he is sick of her and willing to man up and do what needs to be done.  He is an immature, stupid little jerk. |`|2dya7YeKaa	Sounds like emotions are running really high in your house.  Your husband is probably just stressed out and frustrated.  It is really really not cool that he had a problem with taking you to the hospital (HELLO you needed a prescription to stop it, I would hardly call that unnecessary) but I would guess that is not really what he is upset about.  Take a bit of time to cool off and then sit down with him and calmly discuss how you guys are feeling right now.  There is probably just something else bothering him.  Maybe he is scared about becoming a dad.  Maybe he is worried about the money involved (did he mention the wasted gas during this fight?).  Use "I" statements during this conversation, not "you" statements.  For instance:<br>  <br>  "I am upset that we fought last night.  Could we talk about it?"<br>  rather than:<br>  "YOU were being a total jerk last night what is YOUR problem?"<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|MLgknFlVaa	First off you are having contractions that are causing you to dilate. And hello if your dr is giving you meds it is to stop you from going into early labor. You do not take medication for braxton hicks contractions. Your husband is not understanding the situation. If my husband dared to get annoyed with me for going to the hospital I would make his life hell. He is not the one in pain and carrying the child all these months. You DID need to go to the hospital. They had to stop labor.|`|k2heQRKFaa	I dont think your overreacting at all esp. if this is your first baby its hard to tell b/h from real ones apart I would assume. I dont know either because im pregnant with my first right now. He sounds insensitive pregnancy isnt always by the book and things can happen. I say your body is probably getting ready for labor in the next few weeks. I read somewhere that you should wait until the contractions are 5min apart, but sometimes contractions can be irregular and still be dialating your cervix. so really its hard to tell the human body is a complicated thing. So i wish you luck. Tell your husband how you feel in laymans terms and how it is possible for you to go into labor at any time..|`|oqO6ff4caa	Is he usually one to say things like this? If he is you guys need to get couples counseling before the child gets old enough to be affected of the arguing and hurtfull sayings. If he isn't... I know it's tough and you are pry feeling crummy and wanting to just have the baby in a safe manor but he might be reallys stressed and you might be being more crainky lately (understandably so) but it sounds like this is your and his first so there's bound to be some stress. Try to talk to him after things cool down and say you are sorry for wanting to go but the dr told you you should if you were still having contractions. Tell him you love him and you don't want to fight. Hopefully he will recipricate.|`|ocRVlPx8aa	Just make sure when you are in labor to squeeze his balls honey when you are hurting!  I would want him to share some of that pain.  Also, I think at that point would be signing the divorce papers at the same time.  What a jerk!  And you want him to be a father?  I think not!  |`|OIuiZv3maa	He's probably just stressed and nervous about the baby. You need to tell him to chill out. And your right it is better to be safe than sorry. And it was wrong of him to take it out on you. Talk to him about it, maybe something is bothering him causing stress.|`|7c9e7e0e0560ef7bd7e83ad1adbdaff9aa	Your Pregnant and Hes stressed just apologize and tell him you love him and this is the best thing that can ever happen to you guys and you need him to be there for you (and he was that night)|`|AA11100500	The worst thing I have heard from my BF is "It can't be THAT bad"... <br>  <br>  He got smacked...<br>  <br>  <br>  39 weeks and 5 days. <br>  <br>  Just tell him they hurt!!! To leave you alone! |`|8w0786yeaa	OK, I'm sorry, but that was the longest damn run-on sentence ever!<br>  <br>  Second, your hubby is being an ***.  I went to the hospital once for something else...it took forever.  My hubby was completely supportive and he agreed that it's better to know for sure than be in doubt and have something go terribly wrong.  <br>  <br>  But, next time, you don't have to go to hospital right away when you start having contractions.  Usually, you have to either wait until your water breaks or the contracts are a certain time apart...someone help me out here...I can't remember the time frame since I've never been in labor.|`|AA12135528	You don't need to 'explain' it to him. I would think the well-being of his wife and unborn child would outweigh any petty issues he has. Would he like for you to drive yourself the next time and possibly get in an accident? <br>  <br>  You may seem like you're overreacting at times, or completely paranoid at others, but better safe than sorry.|`|ALDeXn6Uaa	not sure, however I would think things are looking up. maybe bad body language, but it's best to be optimistic and read alot of uplifting books like comic strips, cartoons, spiritual things like the bible and the quaran or the hebrew bible, etc, just a positive atmosphere for yourself in my opinion, but I am a man.|`|pO7VbBMzaa	Wow!  I think he was ticked cause he missed some beauty sleep.  I did the opposite, contractions, took a shower dried my hair.  Then i could barely move across a room.  They told me get there sooner next time.  He'll get over it and so should you.  Its one of those crazy baby night things.  You might even laugh later.

dd5d0f065b45c14a02d51f88fefe773eaa	According to this website (I used it to see how it compared to my doc and it was dead on) you conceived 9/30/2008 and you are due on 6/23/2009. So did you have sex with your husband and the "other guy" on the same day or within 2 days of each other??? If so the only way you will be able to determine who the father is would be to take a DNA test. You need to tell your husband the situation. He has a right to know!!!|`|avx7bLnKaa	it could be either your husband's or the other guys.... we don't know when you ovulated.... the only way you'll know is through a paternity test after the baby is born<br>  <br>  either tell your husband about the affair or don't but <br>  i wouldn't suggest an abortion... killing your baby to hide your affair will only cause more guilt, anger, worry, depression not to mention the baby is innocent of the whole affair...|`|u9sGH0AXaa	It's most likely your husbands.  The test probably would not have shown up positive that soon after the sex wth the homewrecker.  But, you will probably be asking this question the WHOLE pregnancy because of guilt.  Did you use protection with the other guy?  I wish you luck and hope everything works out for you, but I hope you learned a lesson.|`|EhAiyJmHaa	if you are 5 weeks, then the baby was conceived around mid or late september, but that is just my guess.. but the doctor may be wrong, you may not be that far along...  you say you had sex with your husband everyday after your period, and had sex with a different guy one time... the odds of it being his are not very likely... but once agian im just guessing...  not to lecture you, but cheating is NOT nice, which im sure you feel guilty enough already, especially being pregnant... but either way you should keep the baby, you would regret it if you didnt|`|aJjV5b95aa	According to how far a long you are and what you say about when you had sex with the other guy it should be you husbands. If it was the other guys you would be about 3 weeks not 5. Good luck!|`|vyurA7heaa	Gosh u guys made commitments(im sorry) But most likely its your husbands if the doctor says u are "5 weeks"|`|8w0786yeaa	That's probably the guy you cheated with...good going.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry, but I have a hard time sympathizing with cheaters.|`|lMy75bKuaa	It could go either way! Were you having intercourse with your husband everyday, including the same day you had sex with the other guy? Unfortunalty, due dates aren't measured by what day you had sex, but by the first day of your last period. So, if your last period was Sept. 16 it makes sense that you'd be 5 weeks! Your best bet is to inform your doctor and maybe he can help you figure out when you were ovulating approximately, and you can figure out who you were having sex with around that time!<br>  Good luck!|`|Q6YboW9Daa	The first day of my last period was Sept 18th.  I conceived the morning of the 30th.  So, if you have a normal period and ovulate at the expected time, it should be your husband's child because it should have been conceived right around the 1st of October or so.  However, there is no sure way to know because you may have ovulated late.  You'll have to get a paternity test to know for sure.  Best of luck.|`|wv4hPOuQaa	It sounds like it could possibly be from either your husband or the guy you cheated with.  Going by your dates and assuming you have a regular 28 day cycle, you would have been fertile between Sept 29 to the begining of October. Unfortunately you may have to wait until you can do a DNA test to find out for sure.|`|VJs1jZJ1aa	At the doctor, they count from the first day of your last period which is how they get the 5 weeks, so that doesnt mean anything (its not the fetus age). But according to the ovulation calendar that i use, you were most fertile between september 28-Oct 2. Which means it is a CLOSE CALL but the baby is MOST LIKELY your husbands. That is if your cycle is normal. |`|0SeYX8uiaa	Will I looked at a calendar and from your calculations the father of your child could be either one. Here's why,it takes three weeks to conceive and the last time you had sex with either one was a good three weeks or so. <br>  Did you tell your doctor? <br>  And you probably need to have a talk with your husband and the other guy.<br>  Good Luck! You need alot of luck.|`|6b78493be9095e81afe291ca302d3ef1aa	Well, you said you had sex with him on the 4th and took a pregnancy test on the 16th..... that is about 11 days from the time you would have conceived. But that would only make around 2 to 3 weeks preggo, so I think its safe to say that its not the other guys. |`|9M8WY2vJaa	Shame on you<br>  just hope it is your husbands<br>  and don't do it again|`|2lhTo6wZaa	sorry, but its most likely the guys baby you cheated with good luck and maybe close your legs next time?<br>  <br>  ha ha that was a scare, but seriously its probly your husbands|`|qej62zhDaa	I bet you wish you would have NEVER slipped up, huh? Sounds like its your husbands but I'd do the mail in DNA test... Good luck|`|kIyTB6Ypaa	Maury can clear everything up for you|`|sYEv8HPaaa	If you are at 5 weeks, then that baby is your husbands. Do the math.|`|84R16CjMaa	1st of all the dr said ur 5 wks because they count from ur last period not that the baby is actually 5 wks. did u have unprotected sex w the other guy??? if u did i'm sorry but that was so stupid and sadly theres a 50/50 chance this baby is ur husbands. the only way u can find out is by getting a paternity test when the babys born. it could be the other guys since "usually" not everyone is the same, but we ovulate 14 days after our last period which would make it sept 30, 14 days after ur last period. but then it depends if u really ovulated on the 30, then for like 3 or 4 days. so theres is a big chance u were ovulating on the 4th and when u had sex with the other guy u got pregnant. sorry but i did my research. i've had 3 miscarriages and tried to get pregnant right away so i did my homework and looked for when i had my best chances of getting pregnant. and sorry to tell u this but after calculating my days i got pregnant in 2 months, then in 1 month, which means it worked for me. but like i said we r all different so we ovulate at different times. and even if some say we can't get pregnant while having sex during our period, which i think is very nasty, we can be ovulating during that time and get pregnant. weird but the human body is one that never stops surprising us. just wait and see, u can actually order a paternity test online, swab the baby, the father, and u and send it back. if u can't find a good excuse to swab ur husband without him wondering u can also send in his toothbrush, hair brush, and plugged hairs, but it cost more. i know all this because my sister doesn't know who her daughters father is and after one killed himself, the one that found out, she had to test the other one. she never did it cuz she doesn't want him to know. another great idea would be to talk to ur husband and tell him the truth. my mom never told me that the man who raised me, and i love and see as my only father, wasn't my real dad. it still haunts me to this day, i'm 24. don't lie to ur kid, its not a good feeling to be lied with something like this. if ur man really loves u and believes u made and mistake and forgives u, he'll be a real man and love ur child like his own, whether he is or not. u won't be able to live with the thought of u not know who father ur child forever.  unless u have no conscience. good luck and stop cheating, and if u do it again at least make sure ur using protection. what if that other guy would infect u with AIDS or something then u would infect ur husband????????????????
yExG7Z5maa	The first thing NOT to do is to get angry. You must be so confused. My son (now 5) did that too when he was 3. We just had to keep reminding him to do it only in the toilet and rewarding him when he did it. (every single time, for a couple of weeks) I just had to be ontop of him about it. Asking him every 5 minutes if he had to go and we put stickers on a chart and the more he went to the bathroom that day IN THE BATHROOM, the more stickers he got. He was excited, because we got spider man stickers and that was his favorite character. You have to do something motivational. It maybe regression, curiosity, laziness or bordom or just him being a normal, healthy boy pushing limits! Whatever the case, I promise you its only a phase and he will get over it. But any negativity can cause negative feelings about using the rest room or even telling you if he actually has an accident. sounds to me like you need to give him a big squeeze and a kiss and have a little chat with him. Best of luck. You sound like a very concerned GREAT parent. |`|m95QBoOAaa	well its good to see that i am not the only one going through this, i think (hope) its a phase, my doc said its a control issue, like if i dont give in to what he wants he knows thats a way to get me back, my son, (turned 3 on oct 4th) got mad at me when he had to go to his room, and peed in his dresser drawer, he has also, whipped his pants down in parks when i told him time to go, and went into the restroom and instead of peeing in potty peed in my dryer! i did spank him for that one, and he hasnt done it again.  i tell him that it makes me very angry cause he is supposed to be a big boy and when he pees like that its baby act.  I also bought him boxer briefs to wear, and i took them there his favorites, when he dont pee where he is supposed to, you can also try to make him wear a diaper, i did that as well when i noticed him peeing everywhere, i think once they are out of diapers for good, and into undies to go back to a baby thing as in a diaper is discouraging. So maybe you can try one of the things i have done, (my son also has to clean his mess!)|`|uNJirnYoaa	WOW........i'm not a parent but i can tell you that's not good.  I have 3 younger sisters and 1 brother and none of them did this.  Its weird and odd, perhaps you should be asking a doctor or somebody that is certified to help you on this subject|`|6b78493be9095e81afe291ca302d3ef1aa	My oldest son did this also , but later found out he had a kidney infection. He could not hold his pee in long enough to make it into the bathroom so he would pee on the floor. He never complained about pain so I didn't think nothing was wrong. I made a appointment with the doc and ask them about it, they ran test turned out he had a kidney infection and needed to be treated asap.

GMIsOYYCaa	There's ways to be unique without giving your daughter a made-up name that nobody will be able to spell or pronounce. What about Calliope, Pandora, or Octavia? I guarantee your daughter will be the only one in her class with those names, and yet those names are *real* names.|`|B1mEwSXWaa	Well... my dear...<br>  Most definately .... RARE & unique !!! But please choose Zaylee & NOT Xayley (reminds me of "X-ray a little...-sorry-) Zaylee or Zayley is quite nice!!!<br>  Wish you a healthy baby!!! Greetings from Germany... Annette***|`|hXoUFWL1aa	that is just weird|`|AA11728843	How funny!  Steph is that you??  My niece is expecting a baby girl & plans to name her Zaylee Ray.  I think it is precious but a little hard to enunciate.|`|t1NmFX3Kaa	How about be normal and save the kid embarrassment by naming her Hailey or Kailey. <br>  <br>  <br>  It is not fun to have a different name.|`|G6p7QSedaa	How about No, those are horrible|`|OWONPvlsaa	That's not too bad. I like Braylee better but Zaylee's kinda cute too!|`|dQNzY8JIaa	Although they are very oringinal, they're also very hard to say/pronounce. People will be mispronouncing your child's name for they're whole life. <br>  So, For a girl: Katarina, Amethyst, Amme (A-ME), Myanne or Myana, Dandy, Danalee, Keeli, Kiwi (lol), Shona (SHOW-NA), Jaelle (JAY-ELL), Vae, Sharra, Lyra, Avaia, Guinevere, or Lisen<br>  For a boy: Jovan, Levi, Leven, Dilbert (lol),Soren, Tegid (TEA-GID), Tabor, Kaen, Cernan, Liranan, or Lancelot<br>  I hope you pick an more easily pronounced name! Good luck!|`|VcFAjLCNaa	But not extremely horrible, which Zaylee is, surely???<br>  <br>  Xavier is a wonderful name, and a real one (not a mad, made-up one).<br>  <br>  Fabien is also cool.

(zee o mar ee)<br>  <br>  Personally I don't like that name just putting it out there.|`|6BdwHnEXaa	i think it's cute!! And i also like Zyley...Xayley is cute too!!..Have u heard Ocie, or Exie??..they're very different and cute!..good luck!|`|4ZB9tqczaa	Zaylee is adorable! I've never seen it before and love that it's unique.|`|l2FxR9Fkaa	If its a girl and you want it to be different try Novalie or Burnadette|`|kKWUtAimaa	Those are awesome names!<br>  I like Zaylee the best.<br>  You should spell it Zailey or Zayley though.|`|w43vsJHFaa	i like Zaylee
0e0a0f1828f99f87ea3d5e5bc8cbd46daa	No it is not. It teaches absoultely nothing. |`|k1W70RHFaa	Uh huh. Positive reinforcement is more effective, though spanking is still effective. |`|PbZefItUaa	It depends on the child and the parent.... I have ten children and for some of them a time-out works best, others and tap of the hand or a tap on the butt is effective... <br>  If you spank a child and leave marks, then I think it is abuse and in-effective, a true spanking shouldn't leave welts or any type of marking at all!|`|kO0XkRleaa	Not really, it temporarily makes it easier for the parent but does nothing for the child except teach them that hitting people is ok and also it teaches them to fear their parents which is NOT the same thing as respect.|`|w6IQ42GSaa	I personally don't because I believe that spanking kids would lead them to spank other kids if they've been bad.  I prefer time outs and stern voice.<br>  <br>  |`|VuUz8NgKaa	Depends on the child, children respond differently to different forms of discipline.|`|2kOoZNmKaa	I have a 2 year old. And much as I dont believe that spanking should be the first option in instilling discipline, it is necessary when all other methods have failed - time outs etc.  It should also be done when you are not at your angriest (ideally) and the reason why your child was spanked should be clear to them.  After all the reason for spanking is to teach kids how to behave appropriately.  |`|XQiEWIEuaa	Yeah. Maybe it's dehumanizing, but I see children under 4 kind of like puppies. Since they haven't been around in life much, they don't know what's wrong or right. You can strongly say not to do a certain thing, or give them a timeout, but to a young child that is not real discipline. What a child learns from something like that is that they can misbehave and all they have to do is sit quietly for 10 minutes and everything is okay. Spanking creates a type of fear (I talk about spanking not in the abuse way, just one slap on the behind). People don't like the idea of causing fear in a child, but it's a cause and effect thing. A child thinks about doing something. Then they realize that the last time they did that, they got spanked. They realize, they probably shouldn't do that thing. Fear in a child is not a bad thing. It's like grounding a teenager. You can't spank a teenager, but usually the fear of getting grounded will be enough for a teenager to stay away from most troublemaking opportunities. You can't ground a toddler. Physical discipline in moderation is the only way to keep kids in line. I mean hell, it's worked for the last, entire length of humanity. It's only been these last 15-20 years where spanking has been frowned upon. I mean when I was a kid I knew other kids who still got the belt, and that was in the 80s.|`|5124bff875ee8fd01b232d68c31d814faa	Only one way of raising kid can never be effective. You have to use all the resources and ways possible(not an evil ones of course!) , combine them together and apply. It all depending on your own and your child's character too. You are the parent and you know best how your child is.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|BC9NnElmaa	Yes it is if use correctly, You will have to figure out what discipline is affective.I do from time to time spank my kids when it is needed.|`|Cy1e6xklaa	GO AWAY GO AWAY GO AWAY GO AWAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|RhjtkKxuaa	NO!!!!!!!!!  PLEASE just do some reasearch on the effects of spanking and you will form your own opinion....|`|rVbkzygWaa	it can be but i think for most it is over done .
ac4b51e4dd9a1ac339ede85a6869a7a1aa	I would go.  It should be beautiful, and as you said you have done the rides before, it means you will be able to appreciate it in a different way.  My sister went to the one in Orlando when she was pregnant and had a good time (not going on the rides).|`|Xc02z608aa	if my doctor said I could.|`|PJpRjSblaa	Afraid I went to Disneyland Paris when I was 5 months pregnant with my first child. You are not allowed to go on most of the rides and this is clearly stated on the signs.  <br>  The only ones you could go on were the tea cup ride which made me feel sick, it's a small small world, the pirates of the Caribbean and the ones you walk through such as the haunted house.<br>  I spent a huge amount of time waiting for the rest of my group to queue up and go on the rides.  I would also check the website for more details!!  I still had a good time but as I love going on rides I was actually really gutted!!  |`|I8TD9wj3aa	I would say you can go, but just remember that fast acceleration, jerky movements, upside down hanging... which occur in many of the rides can potentially harm your baby. Remember that all these things will higher your blood pressure as well!<br>  But there are a lot of shows that you can watch, and a whole lot of other stuff to keep you entertained, so why not!!<br>  Enjoy!|`|VtAiKvXiaa	if it were my baby and i was unsure , then i would not put it at risk ,by going on rides. don't you think if you are worried about it ,you may enjoy it better after the baby is born next year. its not all about what you want. some times its about what the better option is?|`|3nUoSgvYaa	As long as the rides arent jerky or that could hurt.<br>  ask your doctor or sometiomes on the rides it says on them if you can or canoot go on them if you are pregnant :)<br>  Hope I helped :D<br>  x
XecQnoPsaa	I agree, I would call your doctor and ask if you can stop taking that and take iron "naturally" through your diet, as that would help you have more energy and feel better. I would think that if you would vomit that some of the nutrients that you're supposed to be getting might leave too and you don't want to feel like crap for the rest of the day after you've taken it. Talk to your doctor and see what s/he recommends....that would be your best bet right there....|`|9131fb78c3f5eb773cdfc08a64d81eaeaa	Did your doctor say you're anemic? Usually if you are anemic you have low iron and you feel like crap! Extremely tired, even though you slept like 12 hours or something. Iron makes me vomit! Perhaps you should talk to your doctor about getting enough iron through dietary changes. Maybe that would help you feel better and you wouldn't have to  take the iron!
dDVAUA9saa	Something big that he's been wanting - new tricycle, outside play equipment.<br>  Or art supplies (easel, fingerpaint, etc.).|`|v0M64cWzaa	A play kitchen?

(decorations, new furniture, etc.)
9Gc18dVAaa	It will hopefully get better for you, the first three months and the last two are always the most uncomfortable for me.  Use lube, relax, try a position that dose not allow deep penetration as well. By my third pregnancy we did not even attempt traditional sex for the first three months, we just found other ways to  satisfy each  other:) TMI~sorry!  If you still have concerns be sure to talk to your doctor at your next visit.|`|M5bTo4tSaa	yes sex was so painful for me the entire time i was pregnant. i actually wanted to cry. i suffered from vaginal dryness while pregnant and after since i was breast feeding. i had sex maybe 5 times the while pregnant and i didn't have sex until my baby was 8 months old, but thats also because my doc thought i was traumatized by the birth. we tried it just hurt to bad. i had 3rd degree lacerations, it took 2 hours to stitch me up. they gave me estrogen cream but it didn't help. luckily my husband was understanding. he didn't have sex for about 16 months and we were newly weds. i hope this doesn't happen to you.|`|Puq19dPkaa	In the beginning of my pregnancy it was super uncomfortable and painful we actually didn't have sex for about 4 months until i was 20 weeks and saw my ultrasound. So i think my pain was just i was scared i was gonna hurt the baby. Once i saw she was healthy it never hurt again. So  the pain was just in my head pretty much. Im 41 weeks now and its never been better it does not hurt anymore. Just wish she would hurry up and get out|`|68ecd527cdfb0f4257f38ac027faac28aa	I am 38 weeks pregnant and sex has been uncomfortable and painful my entire pregnancy!|`|tjWYiVkPaa	You need to check with your dr. and see if you have placenta previa. it cause painful sex|`|yQWnMSc6aa	I'm exactly like that. It's just plain old uncomfortable. Especially when we start - it gets better as it goes along but it's just not as good. I'm not really sure why - I think it has to do with engorgement of the area. Nothing is wrong with me as far as I am concerned. The doctor said I'm fine and the baby is fine. I just hope I don't have to live with this. It started at around 10 weeks - I'm now 13 weeks.<br>  <br>  BTW: I stopped doing it on my back - that hurt the most. I now like the side or from behind.<br>  <br>  *I'm the same way - I had an ultrasound at 9 weeks and then at 12 weeks and I have a normal placenta. Most people with placenta previa will have bleeding.
v2kmdHtOaa	I'm 18 blessed with the most amazing little boy who will be 6 months on the 28th. I was 17 when I found out I was pregnant and me and the father had been together for two years and are still together; it will be three years august 4th. He was 19 when we found out now 20. My parents we suprised not upset because both of are mature and they knew that we could handle raising our baby without a problem. His parents were excited because two of his other siblings had just had a baby while another was expecting too. He is a great father he just gave our son his night night bath and is now feeding him, he works six a days a week to provide for our son and would give up watching football sundays to have daddy and me day anyday.<br>  <br>  If you are going to be a young mom, goodluck and congrats. It's hardwork but no more hardwork than if you 30. Ignore people that talk you have far too much to worry about now than those immature ones.

NbJbZXtGaa	Pump or breastfeed when you are engorged, and reduce the number of pumpings/brestfeedings by one every couple days until you are down to once a day, and then cut that one out. If you do not want to breastfeed at all, and do not have a pump, you can express milk by hand in the shower to relieve the engorgement. It may take some practice, but you can likely get enough out to bring you down to a comfortable state. Within 3-5 days the engorgement should be significantly reduced.|`|vue9NOhYaa	You need to be weaning gradually.  Did you stop cold turkey?  If so, you are not only in-pain/leaking, but at great risk for mastitis.<br>  <br>  If possible, put baby back on the breast, and start weaning again. Drop one feeding at a time, every 2-5 days.  This will allow your supply to decrease as demand decreases.<br>  <br>  If it's not possible to nurse baby (i.e., you have started chemotherapy and it would be dangerous to nurse), then use a pump and gradually wean from the pump in the same way. |`|ev8ZZYx2aa	Tight wrap them and you can also use scored cabbage leaves. Place the cabbage in the fridge then take out two leaves score them (break/bend open the veins) place them in your bra. Continue to wear them until the leaves start to wilt a little then throw it away and get some more out. The process can take a couple of days. No shower water running on your breast and you can take motrin for the pain.|`|TPsY1X6haa	Most people will tell you to just bind them.. like with a cloth ace bandage or maybe a couple of tight sports bras. It will seem like it will take forever but if you relieve the engorgement by pumping then you're body will automatically produce MORE milk. Some people say to put cabbage on them, I personally never tried this. With 2 children I just wore the tight sports bras and just waited (impatiently, lol) for them to dry up. And it is painful, but that is normal. |`|9dJpJBygaa	ignore it, it shouldnt last much longer. to get rid of it for me took about a week or 2, but it was probaly longer then it shoud of been bc i encoraged it every now & then. |`|NSlcW88waa	Agree with Pippin. Also scrape green cabbage leaves with fork, place in fridge then in tight sports bra. (sometimes old wives tales work!)Good Luck!
kn0PNBoYaa	I personally think you are right.  I mean breastfeeding is a completely natural thing, and wouldn't you rather your son think that breasts first job is feeding.... and he can worry about their second job of pleasure when he is old enough?  He is only 13 months after all, many parents will bathe with their kids at this age (not that I am saying that is right or wrong, just that breastfeeding in front of them is a lot less nudity).<br>  <br>  Your husband isn't being a jerk which I bet some people will say either.  He just likely comes from the generation that believes breastfeeding maybe the best thing for the child, but only up to 1 year old, and only in the privacy of the home.  Sort of like the people in a restaurant asking you to feed your baby in the bathroom instead of in the eating area.  It is what our culture used to be like (and still is like a lot of the time).<br>  <br>  I definitely think you are in the right.  It is natural, and your son is sooo young anyways.  There is no reason to feel ashamed.  You should be proud of yourself for being so open in a healthy way, and for realizing the important of the bonding time. with your 5 week old.|`|Ms08Y1Nlaa	A 13 month old is still very much a baby himself and would not think  twice about the other baby being fed. The only one having a problem is the dad who needs to get over it. Women have been breast feeding for millions of years with other children present. Only here in north america do we make big deal out of it.|`|59mPewhgaa	my son was 3y when i nursed my daughter and i didnt cover up- he is now six and rather than having this silly "boobies" attitude he just says brasts are there to feed your baby properly.<br>  <br>  i BF my daughter til she was 20 months.|`|f4Nv0yBdaa	i dont see anything wrong with it. your husbands just a guy thinking weird guy thoughts lol|`|E3glIl8Qaa	its fine. its natural. its your choice. |`|pXdkEMPhaa	Seeing you nurse should be fine. Some families bathe with their children up until three or four, why should that be any different?|`|8w0786yeaa	Meh, I think its a natural thing, but I don't see anything wrong with covering up either.  Your 13 year old isn't going to remember one way or the other.|`|JiMG2iYjaa	As long as you are being discreet about it, I don't see a problem with it.  God bless you, I wish I was able to breast feed my first child.|`|11LyjrgZaa	Yes I breastfeed my daughter, and my mother breastfeed all 10 of us, yet we were each covered up. Privacy.   <br>  Now my sister has a little one, and she just openly breastfeeds, and everyone gets embarrassed, and very awkward. She now either goes in a room while she breastfeeds or uses a blanket or a breastfeeding thing.|`|5jsOoWCLaa	Did you nurse your son? if so I am sure he knows what is going on.  Would you cover up her face if you were bottle feeding? They why if you are breast feeding in your own home? I can understand in public maybe because it is a personal moment, but in your home you should do what you feel is right. Maybe just leave the room and let your husband take care of your son when he is there. When he isn't how will he know?|`|ZcqibgJpaa	No, you should not be ashamed.<br>  <br>  Its really your personal choice.<br>  <br>  How does it make YOU feel to nurse your 5 week old in front of your 13 month old? If you feel comfortable about it, then proceed with it. However, it wouldn't hurt to cover up either. Like I said, its really your choice. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|voKnIZ6Waa	considering some people breastfeed their children til they are 13 months old i dont see a problem...<br>  <br>  also...its not like he's going to remember, and its your child. its not like you're taking your boobs out and waving it in his face for no apparent reason. <br>  <br>  i say its fine. |`|y5fCk3bYaa	Your son did it once too! He is not old enough to think it is weird or gross, and he won't remember what your breasts look like when he is older either.It is natural and it is fine for him to see. |`|P544Sbmqaa	Its natural and nothing wrong with the other child seeing it.  In fact, it might help the other child grow up knowing that breasts have other purposes than just sex.  |`|Ezkn5azdaa	You are you right. A 13 month old won't notice the difference and want you are doing. He would understand that. My oldest son was 2 when I was breastfeeding his baby brother and I breastfeed in front of him. He didn't care. He played like a toddler. I am pregnant with my third. my oldest son is 6 and my youngest 4 (he been interested touching my breast since I became pregnant). And I breastfeeding this one. I might do front of them and they wouldn't even care. |`|461411165b47f11271f6827674ccc7ddaa	I dont think you should be ashamed to breast feed your baby in front of anyone and definitely not a young toddler. however there is no need to blatantly flaunt your breast either. if you sit naked, although there is nothing wron with it, I can understand it might upset your husbands sensibilities if he has been prudishly brought up. If you just roll your top up and feed your baby I cant see what he is making a fuss about. Dont forget many babys are still breastfed at 13 months themselves!|`|msNXomjTaa	Breastfeed is a very natural thing, and you should feel no need to hide it from anyone!  There are people out there that have hangups - I have to admit, I was a bit startled the first time my ex breastfed our daughter in church, during the service, but...<br>  <br>  Look, the kid has to eat, and you should not have to hide, no matter where you are.  My ex never had a problem, whether it was out shopping, visiting museums, eating out - nowhere.  Our daughter grew up healthy and strong.  <br>  <br>  Besides, at 13 months, your son will not remember what he sees anyway.|`|8SjoUQmEaa	No offense, but I mean a 5 week old and a 13 month old. Geez woman keep your legs closed for a bit.|`|kjW1fmmPaa	Your husband seems to (sadly) share the views that much of North American society has.  I personally find it sexist and demeaning to women.<br>  <br>  Breastfeeding is completely natural and has so many benefits (complete nutrients, immunities passed on to your child, availability, and it's very convenient).  Your 13 month old son would not even know what he is looking at, and even when he is older (say 3 or 4) he would not think it is "wrong" to see you breastfeed unless your husband's views rub off on him.  Otherwise, he would be raised thinking it is natural and okay (which it is).<br>  <br>  And as someone else mentioned, lots of women are breastfeeding later and later, and some women in other societies breastfeed until the child weans himself (often not until age 5 or so).  <br>  <br>  You are completely in the right here.  Your husband's views are just strongly influenced by the society we live in, which I think is disappointing.  It is completely natural and normal, and seeing as your son is just over a year old, there is DEFINITELY nothing wrong with him seeing it - again, he will assume it is natural unless taught otherwise.  Good luck, keep breastfeeding, get some material from your doctor or the internet and try to convince your husband otherwise.
8fr7tMfYaa	It is best to wait at least 12 months before conceiving again to allow your body to heal and replenish what it lost during the first pregnancy.  I know people who have done it sooner, but it's not the healthiest thing.|`|F8KmTbqjaa	Just because your baby is like that now does not mean he will be forever!  They change as they grow and things like teething and growing pains can change their schedules and attitude drastically.  They say to wait at least a year before trying again so your body can recover.  If your healthy and ready though I would say go for it!  Even better if your husband/boyfriend are very supportive and helpful that will make having babies close together much easier!  Good Luck.|`|c8a188861f0a854648ff16ed2a2476a9aa	Nine years at the least.|`|kHk8rS5Xaa	depends on if you had c section or vaginal birth but generally i hear wait 12-18 months so your body can heal
e1533accbcc28c987a387cfc873f55edaa	Yes, it could very well be implantation bleeding. If it was implantation bleeding then you should be able to get an accurate test reading. Good Luck!!<br>  <a href="http://pregnancy411.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://pregnancy411.blogspot.com/</a>|`|9vpicx39aa	Sounds like a regular period to me..I mean a light period..with implantation..maybe?? But you still might be pregnant. It is possible to have a period and be pregnant. Take a test or ask for a blood test to find out.|`|AA10126006	implantation bleeding would probably be what you described but i think it only last for like 2 days. But then again if you have normal periods and didnt expect something like that and u think u might be pregnant then  you might be. I had a friend who had a really light period for 4 days and no symptoms and she turned out pregnant and that was her second pg. her first she has all normal symptoms. i guess everyone is different but you would just have to take a test in a week or a couple of days. hope this helps. oh the light pink and mucus is a big sign!!=)|`|snAPzgrTaa	While a rare minority will experience pregnancy symptoms sooner, typically the first pregnancy signs occur when your baby implants around 8-10 days after ovulation. Implantation causes an increase in progesterone levels, which can lead to higher temperatures giving you a tri-phasic chart. If you temperature remains high for fifteen or more days after ovulation, you may be pregnant. Some women will see a slight temperature drop at implantation. Implantation bleeding sometimes occurs and can be pink, red, or brown in color. You may also have lower abdominal cramps.<br>  Im not sure about it lasting a week it sound like it can be a light period or implantation. sorry hope this helps you
T7nsmFAZaa	I'm not sure when you tested, but it might have just been too early for you.  Buy another brand of test and try again.|`|hO3qUfOQaa	Best bet would to take a blood test|`|AA11149120	Go to the doctor and have bloodwork done to be sure.|`|ITp35Wyzaa	Unfortunately, this symptom isn’t unique to pregnancy. It can indicate that you are getting sick or that your period is about to start. Likewise, you can be pregnant without experiencing any of these symptoms.<br>  <br>  Moreover, stress can cause a period to delay too.<br>  <br>  However, I personally think that you might be pregnant.  <br>  <br>  Pregnancy signs include:<br>  1. Implantation Bleeding<br>  2. Delay/Difference in Menstruation<br>  3. Swollen/Tender Breasts<br>  4. Fatigue/Tiredness<br>  5. Nausea/Morning Sickness<br>  6. Backaches<br>  7. Headaches<br>  8. Frequent Urination<br>  9. Darkening of Areolas<br>  10. Food Cravings<br>  <br>  However if you want a confirmed answer on whether you are pregnant or not, there are two alternatives that you can seek.  The first alternative is to take a home pregnancy test kit one week or so after your missed period.  If you are really pregnant, the pregnancy stick will able to detect it due to your high hormones level.  Another alternative is to see and doctor and had blood test done.  After all, this will be a more accurate but expensive method to check out one’s pregnancy.|`|kvDCBGgKaa	Go to a doctor. Those home pregnancy tests may not be so accurate.|`|lfvXmv0oaa	I always get so irritated to see the am I pregnant question over and over......If you have had sex there is always a possiblity of being pregnant. No one on this message board can answer that for you. You have to go to a dr to confirm a positive or negative. If your pregnancy test came back negative, more than likely you arent pregnant. Sometimes our bodies just go through changes, just chill and stop getting yourself worked up about it. Go see a dr if you have had sex and think you could be pregnant.|`|JjH53pX4aa	You may be pregnant. Home pregnancy tests aren't always very accurate. Some people take 4 tests and the tests show 2 + and 2 -. So that ain't very accurate. I suggest you go see a gp. All the best! =)|`|hEmL2TZ9aa	You just said ur pregnency tets was negative so not pregnent for now at least.|`|pTnA2Pn1aa	More than likely you are not pregnant but sometimes (rarely) tests can be wrong. I do suggest that you make an apt. with your doctor our go to a public health facility (planned parenthood for example) no matter where you go HIPPA laws make a doctor keep everything confidential. <br>  In seeing a doctor they can rule out any possible hormonal problems or a miscarriage.<br>  I do pray that it all turns out right.|`|sfjaiIoGaa	Yep, your pregnant!
ZGXxP4vRaa	Well, it could be because of your hips getting so loose.  I'm not joking.  It's known that when your pregnant, your joints loosen up to make way for baby.  Some people have it worse then others.  When that happens, it can cause the lower back pain.  Usually it gets a little better with time.  I went to the chiropractor and he said my lower back was fine and it was my upper back that was out of place.  It doesn't hurt to go to a doctor or chiropractor to check into it.  I haven't heard of the pain being so bad that you would be crying, but let's face it, when we are pregnant, everything makes us cry. Good luck.  |`|TiUZlMm9aa	Pregnancy can be a time of overall discomfort. Some of the very first signs of early pregnancy, in fact, tend to be things like tenderness of the breasts, morning sickness, and muscle cramps. Pain in the lower back during early pregnancy is also very common. some studies suggest that more than half of moms-to-be will experience some degree of back pain during early pregnancy, in fact.<br>  <br>  Back pain in early pregnancy is generally because of the way that the hormone progesterone affects a woman’s body. The progesterone softens the ligaments and discs in a woman’s back that support her upper body. This pain will sometimes be accompanied by muscle spasms or cramps in the lower back as well. For some women, lower back pain during early pregnancy can also be caused by a urinary tract infection. <br>  <br>  The best treatment for lower back pain during early pregnancy tends to be exercise. A variety of exercises, such as pelvic rocking, mini-crunches, and walking are all excellent exercises that will help to relieve back pain during early pregnancy. <br>  <br>  Posture plays an important role in back pain during early pregnancy as well. While later on in pregnancy posture becomes even more important as a woman’s center of gravity changes, having correct posture can also help to relieve and even avoid lower back pain in early pregnancy. By making sure that you are sitting or standing straight, you can maintain good posture.<br>  <br>  Rest is another important component in helping with lower back pain during early pregnancy. Even if you have difficulty sleeping, as many women do during early pregnancy, you should still try to spend at least some time every day laying down. Often, lying on your side with a pillow between your legs can help to relieve some of your lower back pain.<br>  <br>  In addition, you should practice safe lifting techniques while you are pregnant. If at all possible, you should avoid any heavy lifting. If you must lift something, be sure to lift with your knees, rather than with your back.<br>  <br>  The good news is that, generally, lower back pain in early pregnancy tends to disappear by around the 20th week of pregnancy. If you have severe or chronic back pain, you should talk with your health care provider. She may be able to help determine what exactly is causing the pain, and how best to treat it.<br>  <br>  
LulrsgJsaa	I think your hormones are just going a little wonky. I don't really think you are pregnant. You should go see a doctor and have a scan done to be sure if you are or not and if you are you must let him know what is going on with your cycle. |`|o503YPrqaa	Well if you were pregnant you wouldn't have bleed that much I wouldn't think. But it is possible to have a few periods in the beginning of pregnancy. possible, but does not always happen. Don't stress out though or your body could fake a pregnancy or period! Good Luck! <br>  <br>  EDIT : the only way the bulge could be at the belly button because what person above me said is true. but unless you had an ectopic pregnancy, and the baby burst through the fallopian tube. That is rare. See the doctor if you feel bad pain.|`|I3PdIX0Kaa	Usually, if you have had your period, you are not pregnant.  The "internal bulge" is merely bloating.... you would not feel any bulge from a baby for about 3 months....<br>  <br>  Relax.  If you are TRYING to get pregnant, RELAX.  Stop taking so many pregnancy tests.  You are wasting money... don't take another pregnacy test until you've actually MISSED a period for more than two weeks....  <br>  <br>  Keep trying!!!!!  The fun is in the trying!!!|`|wi7Ern8Raa	There is no way to know if you are pregnant until your period is due -- if it doesn't come, take a test.  Otherwise, there is no way to know.  Whatever "bulge" you are feeling is not related to pregnancy (even if you are pregnant) -- your uterus does not reach your belly button until around 5 months of pregnancy.  Good luck.  |`|RmugmJDiaa	It could just be a change in your period since you stopped working out.  You might want to go to an OBGYN.  I have something similar happen to me and it turns out that I have lesions on my cervix that were the culprit.  Might be time for a pap.  Another bonus, when you go in they will ask if you think you might be pregnant and give you a blood test to ultimately determine.  Everyone's body is different.  |`|XAl6Ff3eaa	I had some friends who tried too hard to get pregnant. The stress of it all was the problem. They put too much pressure on getting pregnant and it took them months. They went to the Doctor and there was nothing physically wrong with either of them. Just too much stress. Stop taking a million tests & let it happen. Our periods are always changing and it may not even be related. Relax and it will work itself out!|`|FAguIRU2aa	Call your OBGYN person.  If you were pregnant the test would be conclusive. There may be something else thats up.  Some women has cysts that come and go in relation to their cycle on their ovaries.  Take the time to check this out, waiting can be a mistake.
ia0TzACCaa	Don't forget that in your toddler's mind, life is all about him. Make sure you make it all about him also.<br>  <br>  You have a new relationship to manage, and a new husband to attend to, but as a mom, your child is your first priority. (And your child was there first.)<br>  <br>  It's a good idea to have your child help plan and decorate his new room. When you move in, make sure you have a special "new house" party with your son as the star of the show. (And, move in in the morning so he has the whole day to adjust.)<br>  <br>  Make a big deal about going to bed in the new room. If he needs you more during the transition, be there more. Your husband (an adult) should understand more and be more flexible than your son (a baby).<br>  <br>  Take time and care with this, and it will pay off big in the long run.|`|1b40b411fde105efac034d33b5f3fdeeaa	I don't agree with leaving your toddler with grandma and grandad either, he will feel pushed out and resentful.<br>  i think that you will have to explain it all to him before it actually happens.<br>  Also i would use his current bedsheets etc in his new bed for a while, so he has a familiar smell and it may help him sleep at night too.<br>  <br>  Good luck- and remember not to be too hard on him if he misbehaves or struggles to adapt to the change, he WILL adapt eventually.|`|mc6YtaRbaa	I think most important is his room. You can get him involved in picking out decorations or paint color for it and just really make it his space so he has a place to feel safe. I don't think it will be a huge problem for him since he really likes your fiance. Just make it exciting for him. <br>  <br>  I wouldn't leave him out of the process and leave him with his Grandparents. That will make him feel left out and you will be adjusted and normal and he won't be in the same place.

7471TTQaaa	I told my daughter when she was 13. I was open and honest. <br>  <br>  NO counselors were involved. <br>  <br>  If there is a good relationship between mom and child, things will go okay. My daughter comes to me when she wants to talk or has any questions. She knows what rape is. She knows that not all men are like that and that her dad (my husband) is nothing like that and loves her very much, which is why he adopted her. <br>  <br>  This is a very very private and individual matter. There is no right way or wrong way. No outside person will be able to tell either one the best way to go about it. Only the mom will truly be able to know what is right to tell the child and how much and when. And even then it could be wrong, but it might not be. <br>  <br>  The child has to be mature enough to know what sex is. What love is. What rape is. To understand that they are not at fault by any means. And to understand that not all men are like that, just a small small part of the world's men are monsters. <br>  <br>  What works for one won't work for another. Going by other's experiences won't help the decision any. I've tried. The mom will know when it's right. She will know it's time and how much to tell. <br>  <br>  My heart goes out to her. I Just told my daughter who is 13 a few months ago. Both of us feel so much better that it's out there. The deep dark secret is finally out there and no longe rin hiding from her. She had a lot of unanswered questions and her curiosity answered when I told her. Thing made sense to her. It was a huge relief to both her and I to get it out there. I never dreamed it would go like this and have this feeling afterwards. <br>  <br>  She once in a while will ask me about him. He and i had dated before he raped me. I answer her honestly and not biased. I can do that now since it's been so long since then.|`|bdcfd8f3bf87fe07c1dc089309827013aa	Wow, that is a tough one, but a good one to ask since unfortunately we live in a sometimes cruel world.<br>  I would suggest that she talk to a professional (counselor) before actually saying anything.<br>  There has got to be an age that the child should know and understand.<br>  Also a counselor may help the mother as well, but best of all if it's told in that venue, the child will learn coping skills that she's going to need.<br>  I hope the best for your friend...|`|yAW4eiJYaa	im sorry for your friend to tell her daughter this but i think you should tell her sooner or later as it wil hurt her more finding out in a few years time and that her mum has being keeping it a secert from her all this time x|`|AA10459583	my husband was told flat out by his mom, that he would have never been born if his father would not have raped her.

Even now, with the shots, it might not do me/my baby any good especially if the baby has a different blood type that is not 0 neg. Luckily the father of this child is o neg!!!<br>  <br>  Take your doctors advice and get the shot asap.

I am so sorry. About your Rhogam shot, I have had four miscarriages and with three they immediately gave  me my shot and after one, the first one, I never received my shot. If you are concerned that you have developed antiodies that would impact your next pregnancy, ask your doctor to give you an antibody test to see if they are present. If anitbodies are present, the shot will correct the problem. And if there aren't, then the shot will just support you. Good luck!

Il existe certaiens traitements en fonction des causes de l'azoospermie : <br>  AVOIR UN ENFANT LORSQUE L'ON EST AZOOSPERMIQUE:<br>  <br>  * Trois solutions doivent être discutées :<br>  * 1/ La solution chirurgicale : Tenter une intervention chirurgicale qui cherchera à réparer un éventuel obstacle sur la voie génitale, vous permettant d'obtenir une grossesse naturellement : cette solution et les chances de grossesses qu'elle vous offre doit être discutée avec l'Andrologue. Ceci ne s'applique qu'aux problèmes " de tuyauterie "<br>  * Le même type d'intervention permettra aussi de recueillir des spermatozo?des avant l'obstacle qui empêche sur la voie génitale leur passage dans l'éjaculat (problème de " tuyauterie ") ou dans le testicule si on estime qu'il en produit encore un peu (problème de " fabrication ").<br>  * Si cette exploration chirurgicale retrouve des spermatozo?des, ils seront utilisés lors d'une Fécondation In Vitro avec micro-injection (ICSI), soit immédiatement lors de leur prélèvement, soit à distance de ce prélèvement après leur congélation.<br>  * Les chances de trouver lors de cette intervention chirurgicale des spermatozo?des sont dans tous les cas actuellement difficiles à évaluer, car nos connaissances dans ce domaine sont récentes et manquent de recul. Elles nous ont appris qu'il n'y a aucune certitude malgré les bilans clinique et biologique qui ont été faits. C'est donc votre choix que nous tenterons d'éclairer au mieux qui comptera.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  * 2/ Le recours au don de sperme : il s'agit du dernier recours en matière d'Assistance Médicale à la Procréation. Le don de sperme et le recours au don de sperme sont encadrés par les Lois du 29 juillet 1994, dites Lois Bioéthiques.

Cette azoospermie peut être soit excrétoire (c’est-à-dire due à une obstruction quelconque sur les canaux transportant le sperme) soit sécrétoire (c’est-à-dire due à un problème de formation des spermatozo?des) au niveau des tubes séminifères. C'est une cause de stérilité.<br>  <br>  L'origine de l'altération de la spermatogenèse peut être soit une affection testiculaire primitive congénitale ou acquise ; soit une insuffisance hypothalamo-hypophysaire acquise congénitale. Ses causes peuvent être un traitement anticancéreux, une orchiépididymite (inflammation des testicules et de l'épididyme), le syndrome de Klinefelter (présence d'un chromosome X supplémentaire), la cryptorchidie (testicule resté dans l'abdomen), la mucoviscidose (trop grande viscosité des sécrétions bronchiques et digestives).

Se sabe que los espermatozoides Y (ni?o) se mueven más rápido que los X (ni?a) pero durante menos tiempo. Teniendo en cuenta esta premisa y conociendo la fecha de ovulación, la probabilidad de gestar un ni?o aumenta cuando el coito fecundante se produce durante la ovulación y para una ni?a es mayor cuando el mismo se realiza de 2 a 4 días antes de la ovulación. Desde un punto de vista científico sólo hay certeza empleando técnicas de fertilización asistida como la selección espermática, que se utilizan con los animales de granja mediante la inseminación con semen tratado (centrifugación) para separar los espermatozoides con cromosomas X o Y. Puedes encontrar más información en nuestra nota sobre métodos científicos.<br>  <br>  A continuación te damos una lista de algunas creencias y ritos que se pueden poner en práctica para elegir el sexo de tu futuro bebé.<br>  <br>  Eligiendo el sexo del bebé con la dieta<br>  Para un ni?o<br>  ? Come carne roja.<br>  ? Ingiere alimentos ricos en sal.<br>  ? Ingiere bebidas cola.<br>  Para una ni?a<br>  ? Come pescado.<br>  ? Come chocolates.<br>  ? Ingiere dulces en general<br>   <br>  <br>  Eligiendo el sexo del bebé mediante las relaciones sexuales<br>  Para un ni?o<br>  ? Realizar posiciones que aumenten la penetración profunda.<br>  ? Permanecer recostada 30 minutos después del coito. <br>  ? Concentrar la estimulación en el placer del varón.<br>  ? El varón debe dormir a la izquierda.<br>  ? La mujer mirando el norte.<br>  ? Los testículos deben estar calientes.<br>  ? Que el hombre llegue primero al orgasmo.<br>  Para una ni?a<br>  ? La mujer sobre el varón.<br>  ? Iniciativa femenina para el juego.<br>  ? Concentrar la estimulación en el placer de la mujer .<br>  ? La mujer alcanza primero su orgasmo.<br>  ? Los testículos deben estar fríos.<br>  ? Que la mujer llegue primero al orgasmo.<br>   <br>  Eligiendo el sexo del bebé de acuerdo al momento del coito<br>  Para un ni?o<br>  ? Con luna cuarto menguante a la noche.<br>  ?

Los días pares del mes.|`|ob7qAKHXaa	Mira supuestamente si tienes relaciones el momento mas cercano a la ovulacion es VARON, y si tienes relacione el momento mas alejado a la ovulacion es MUJER, esto se debe a que los espermas de varon xy viven menos tiempo que el de la mujer.

I'm taking an Earth Science class and so far, I've discovered my: Carbon footprint, the effects of volcanoes, overpopulation, plate tectonics and the possibility of arsenic in the water.  Our environment is toxic.  Then, in my psychology class, we're learning about all the bad things parents can do to their children.  We are currently discussing EQ or emotional intelligence that would go along with your post.  The emotional responses are learned and the home front would be the child's first school..  It would probably really surprise you to know what goes on in some of these children's homes -the ones that post junk like that.  It's very sad, indeed.  However, at that age, a child is struggling with finding their identity.  Parents that have offered their children an authoritative environment will have higher self-respect and practice better choices.  Really it's mostly about the upbringing and yet you can raise your child to the BEST of your ability and they can still choose to go astray....<br>  <br>  Sex at a young age is bad, however, it's really low on the list as to ALL the reasons one should reconsider.|`|77c545515c0febec6e29d58e3419535faa	I totally agree.

It took one cycle--wasn't trying. I'll be 22 when the baby is born.|`|RUm5zdCYaa	I was 29 with my first, it took 7 months or 7 tries to get pregnant. Meaning each time I ovulated during a month we'd try during that time frame. The second, I was 33 and it took only 2 tries!! Fortunately for me, with my first, I realized when I ovulated so with my second I pretty much knew within say 24 hours of when we should try and I was right on. No more after that though.|`|hRRr5IF8aa	i was 20 it took 1 month after my wedding. but know i'm taking 4 yrs for my second child trying to consive. my first one was fast but know my second one taking forever.
DnF4WJLiaa	I had a tubal 9 years ago and last spring I had the same thing happen. We were actually hoping I WAS pregnant! :) But I took a pregnancy test and it was negative. After that my period came twice in one month, and was messed up for about 5 months after that. They gave me some hormone pills and it fixed it right up. So if you don't get yours next month then check with a doctor. But go ahead and take a pregnancy test now. They are fairly cheap nowadays and you get two to a box. The best thing they have to offer is peace of mind.|`|AA11021960	You could take a test just in case, but more often than not.. you may be entering premenopause.  You don't say how old you are, but when my sis was 32 she had much the same experience that you are describing and what it ended up being was premature menopause.  She was told that woman that have their tubes tied have a tendancy to begin menopause earlier.   Then I had asked my doc recently if that was true and he agreed, which is why hubby will be going through the big snip after we have this one.<br>  <br>  Like I said, you could take a test, but you prob aren't preg.  I would go see my gyn and see what's up!<br>  Hope this helped!!!|`|cnMXJMFUaa	From the way these boards have been on this particular subject last couple of days...YES!!!<br>  <br>  ETA ~ <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AnkDYWMWZAR5wgxhc8wpDYbsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20080311132335AAsxO5X">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|AA11441821	Yes, these things aren't 100% Take the test and then you'll know!!

And have been late many times, but still on baby. One time my OB put me on the pill for 3 months to regulate me. Are you under a lot of stress? That may be the reason your late. I doubt if your pregnant but you should see a doctor. I'm sure he/she will give you a test then you'll for sure|`|oRUkihqhaa	My mom had the same thing after she had my sister, and 4 years later she got pregnant with me!

0u8xToq6aa	could be kidney stones|`|9TVAofByaa	uti. i had it like 2 months ago. it sucks. it stings when you pee right?|`|EEvHBX1Aaa	I'm not sure if you should be feeling pains already because after you have sex, when your near ovulation it takes about a week for the baby to even be the size of a piece of dust. There is no way a pregnancy test could should an accurate result 3 weeks away from your period. If the pain continues I would call you doctor. You may be pregnant, I'm not sure, but to test I would wait atleast till your 4 days away from your period, if not to the day that your period is supposed to come. Normally, women dont even start experiencing symptoms till they are about 4 weeks or so. Just wait it out a while and see. Good Luck with everything, I hope this helps.|`|P8X4bGdKaa	fure sure|`|lkgGNQYgaa	there is always a chance wait for your missed period and test.

(ojo no se dejen llevar por sentimentalismos repentinos ) vayan y lo hablan los DOS con tus padres.<br>  Si decides tenerlo, no tenes porque ir SOLA A AFRONTAR UNA SITUACION QUE OBVIAMENTE ES DE LOS DOS.<br>  Y en caso de que decidan no tenerlo, tambien razonen bien lo que hacen.<br>  Son adultos, pero es un decisión dificil de tomar.O sea que tiene que ser DE A DOS.<br>  Y sin reproches ulteriores.Sea cual fuere la decisión que tomen.<br>  En cuanto a tus padres, bueno, ya estan afuera de esto desde que decidiste no cuidarte sabiendo que cabía la posibilidad de un embarazo en el mejor de los casos.<br>  Asi que decírselos no implicará  mas que algunos gritos, desmayos y llanto, que es lo que se da en la mayoría de los casos.<br>  Pero no lo hagas sola.Asi como no hiciste un ni?o sola, la decisión que tomes, la comunicas con el padre de la criatura al lado.<br>  Un beso grande y mucha suerte.<br>  Todo saldrá bien,|`|TxqqSuMdaa	DILES<br>  <br>  estoy embarazada...<br>  <br>  ya estas grande... aprende a afrontar tus actos<br>  <br>  lo q puedes hacer es venir y decirles un dia sin q se lo esperen, porq creeme es peor q los sentes en la sala, q llege tu novio hablar y le den muchas vueltas al asunto...<br>  <br>  diles asi de la nada...<br>  <br>  asi nisiquiera tienen tiempo de pensar en q t diran ni nada<br>  <br>  ANIMO<br>  <br>  y espero q nos cuentes|`|eJBsDfiPaa	dandoles una mezcla de te de hierbas con marihuana, un poco de valium y todo saldrá bien|`|66eccb110a2956aa72ce924e697792d4aa	la verdad...pero que te acompane tu galan,afronten las situacion  juntos  para que tus papas  vean  que el te apoya...ustedes  ya estan en buena edad  de  hacer vida juntos  y si se  aman  ps les deceo lo mejor de  este mundo...y pues tus papas  tendran que entender  que   no todo  es perfecto en la vida....mucha suerte de todo corazon!!!|`|A46P3vyDaa	Hablen los dos con ellos, ademas ya estas grande ya como quien dice terminaste tu carrera, y pues al parecer tu novio ya se puede hacer cargo,  yo sali embarazada de mi novio iba terminando la prepa el me lleva 11 a?os mi papa jamas acepto la relacion imaginate, la primer reaccion de mi mama fue apoyarme totalmente de mi papa fue un poco diferente primero keria ke abortara, despues ke tuviera al ni?o y ellos hacerce cargo de el que ellos me apoyarian en todo con la condicion de no tener contacto con mi novio y no acepte a final de cuentas mi papa accedio y acepto a mi ahora esposo, y jamas dejaron de hablarme ni se pusieron serios conmigo me apoytaron en toodo, se que se desepcionaron pero ahora andan loooocos con el bebe, mira no se como sean tus padrres pero comprendelos si se molestan o asi ya que vean a su nieto andaran loooocos ya veras, te recomiendo les hagas saber que no fue un error que solo fue algo que sucedio fuera de tiempo y que no arruinara tu vidam y de vdd no lo hara solo la cambiara pero la llenara de hermosas sonrisas lo juro, tambien hazles saber que quieren hacer lo mejor para el bebe y que estan dispuestos a enfrentar juntos todo lo que se venga,,, suerte|`|aa5f9b026213a9a3d6b78ffcb5fba118aa	primero que todo  dile a tus padres que se sienten que tu quieres hablar con ellos , sincerate con ellos ya  que debes de tenerles confianza a los mejor te entienden ya que si tu novio trabaja a lo mejor te ayuda  habla con ellos y diles la verdad nunca con la mentira siempre con la verdad ok bueno espero que esto te  resulte|`|b667127a23c18461d132509d2ba83908aa	Pues mira, se lo tienes que decir asi como nos lo estas diciendo a nosotros.<br>  Ya que de todos modos se van a enterar y su reaccion sera la misma digas como se lo digas, mientras tanto tu solo te estas mortificando y la verdad no tiene caso.<br>  Ya eres adulta y puedes emprendrer tu propia vida, y mas aun si tu y tu novio piensas hacer vida de matrimonio.<br>  En caso de que se llegaran a molestar no los culpes y maldigas, dejalos que reflexionen solos , por lo general el padre varon por muy necio que se ponga, cuando llega el nieto o nieta, es el mas encantado con el y el mas consentidor....|`|188a4116992883d179f190c2db663168aa	Sos una piba grande, si el pibe tiene un buen futuro todo bien ;)<br>  seguro que lo van a entender, ya sos mayor de edad...<br>  y si no querían un hijo se tendrían que haber cuidado...<br>  <br>  suerttee :)|`|1pSjluFCaa	Mira lo primero es tranquilizate, porque el estar estresada le hace da?o a tu bebe, no se cuanto de embarazo tengas pero ahora ya debes pensar por los dos, no solo por ti.<br>  Lo que te puedo decir es que siempre es mejor decir la verdad, es dificil porque no sabes como van areaccionar  las personas, pero creeme que ahora tienes que llenarte de valor por ese angelito que llevas. Primero habla con tu pareja y que juntos hablen con tus padres, si el susodicho no quiere comprometerse contigo, no debes caer en depresión porque debes entender que un bebe es una bendicion de Dios, mira hay miles de parejas que no pueden concebir un hijo y que darian todo por estar en tu lugar. Bien una pareja se apoya en las buenas y en las malas; creeme que si èl te ama  juntos van a salir adelante con su bebe. y de todas maneras si se niega, las personas que más te quieren son tus papas y tarde que temprano se van a enterar;  si dices la verdad vas a quitarte una piedra en la espalda y un nudo en el estomago, adelante no temas y ademas solo te falta el servicio social, estar embarazada no es estar enferma; Claro que ??Puedes??? salir adelante; hay miles de madres solteras que estudian, trabajan , son madre y padre en la familia. Esto es un reto que debes enfrentar con valentia, responsabilidad y honor. El mejor premio que vas a tener es ese chiquitin que forma parte de ti, no sabes las grandes experiencias que vas a tener, el primer abrazo, la primera vez que lo amamantes,  cuando lo veas caminando, el primer beso que te de, el dia que te diga madre o su primera palabra, los desvelos que te va hacer pasar. La verdad es que  el titulo  de madre no cualquiera lo tiene, creeme solo la que sabe sufrir sin recibir nada acambio.<br>  Tal vez te sientes mal porque a lo mejor no estan casados, a lo mejor te pones a pensar en que dira la gente, pero no debes hacer caso lo importante es que tu te sientas bien contigo misma, total te puedes casar en el momento en que los dos se decidan y se organicen.<br>  Bueno te dejo cuidate y cuida a tu bebe, dile la verdad a tus padres; no se merecen que les ocultes algo tan importante.<br>  Animo y suerte.|`|3U9TfoGvaa	n0 t3 pr30cup3s si ts papas de v3rdad qui3r3n lo m3j0r para ti te d3b3n d3 3nt3nd3r dil3s qu3 tu 3scogist3 3l padr3 d3  tus hij0s y que3 3stas agusto con 3l.<br>  no s0y experta en est0 pero espero que te sirva ok!!!!<br>  SUERTE!!!!!!!!!!!!!

4259a8b8fa5899f30c0e319fda9936fdaa	If you're concerned, get an evaluation.  Children who are 3 should be able to speak in sentences.  You can check out the developmental norms at ASHA (american speech and hearing association).  Asha.org.  They are a great resource and can also give you the name of a therapist who is close to you.  Good luck|`|AA11317628	I would talk to your pediatrician first.  There are other tests that they will want to run to see if there is something else going on before recommending speech therapy.  My step son will be 3 next month and he has trouble talking.  He had to go through vision and hearing tests, as well as some genetic tests to determine if there was a different problem.  He has recommended speech therapy and also having him around kids more often, such as a play group and Early Childhood classes.  We also have to make him say juice or drink if he wants something to drink, up if he wants to be held and other words or he does not get what he is pointing and grunting at.  There are times we have to hold out of drinks for 5-15 minutes but he eventually gives in and says it.  What it boils down to with my step son is that his biological mother didn't really talk to him so he never had the chance to pick up on words.  Now that his father and I have custody we are taking steps to correct the problem.|`|72cc6d9cc7f385aaf9fc6e65c2285c59aa	If she is able to talk but doesn't, then quit catering to her. Don't give her anything unless she asks for it. If she's incapable of saying words, get her checked out.|`|3F8f1SoQaa	yes. Please have your daughter evaluated by the local school system. she can get a diagnosis and speech therapy for free there. I really doubt that your daughter "doesn't want" to speak, I think it is a matter that she cannot as much as she wants to. You should google "childhood apraxia". I had no clue that kids could have apraxia. My son did not say much more than 10 words until he was 2.5 years old and had been in speech therapy for 3-4 months. He wanted to talk really bad, but could not make the words come out his mouth. he pointed and grunted and tried so hard to make me understand him and had horrible fits when I could not understand him.<br>  <br>  Does your daughter stuff her mouth full of food? does she drool a lot? can she lick her top lip? blow a kiss? stick her tongue out? move her tongue from  side to side? Can she puff her cheeks full of air? If she does do the first 2, and cannot do the others that is a good indicator that her lack of speech could be caused by an apraxia type disorder. It is sort of like an older adult who has lost the ability to speak...the words are in there, but their mouth won't cooperate. sign language is a big help to these children and thier families.<br>  <br>  If you are intersted I do have an article on developmental apraxia that  can e-mail you.It was a real eye opener for me. I just need for you to e-mail me your actual e-mail address and ske for it(YA does not allow for attachments)|`|K3ZYWBr4aa	I would talk to her doctor about it. Einstein didnt talk till he was 4 years old so I wouldnt worry about it. Some kids just dont feel like they need to talk. If shes getting what she wants by pointing and basic sign language why use words?
Ihfq3Ih5aa	My baby is boy the same, in fact ever since about 30 weeks, I'd only felt the majority of his kicks in the one place.<br>  I asked my doctor, it just turns out my baby is head down now, all good and comfy, and there is not a lot of room for his usual somersaults anymore.<br>  P.S, it's in the exact same spot you are feeling your kicks! So it's probably a safe bet your bubs is head down, in the LOA (Left Occipito Anterior) position, which is good!|`|hxM8AXVRaa	My daughter never moved from her position head down. Her heartbeat was always in the same spot and she kicked me in the same 2 places. It's fine, my dr told me some babies just stay where they are comfortable. Ask your dr if you still feel there is something wrong|`|m7L0Qt5Saa	This is perfectly normal especially in the last trimester when room is getting scarce. My son constantly kicked or beat ;-) in the exact same place only on the left side. BTW he turned out to be an excellent drummer, maybe he was practicing! LOL|`|dLLDwZaraa	She is running out of room to move around in there.  The shifting you feel may be her arms and legs moving but chances are she's probably in place and resting up for her arrival.  Congrats and good luck!!|`|72cc6d9cc7f385aaf9fc6e65c2285c59aa	She just likes that spot better. Also, that might just be a sensitive spot on you where you're able to feel it more. No worries!|`|hkyeMFuGaa	help me that is my same situation my little boy only kicks in the same area over and over again i thought it was normal.|`|itYMJ3EZaa	Maybe thats just where she's comfy at.|`|PVNHlI9Faa	Yes this is normal. As she begins to move around more and more you will feel kicks in other areas. Congrats 36 weeks here
ByoYmFsBaa	Lol, Megen. Calm down. It would take any of us by surprise.<br>  <br>  And for the record, I would have tried to "fix it" by saying I was upset at her avoidance of telling me, too.<br>  <br>  You're fine. A mother who would be so worried as to come on Yahoo Answers because she was so concerned about her reaction, is a good Mom. You haven't scarred her. If you feel it's important enough to bring up again, make sure that she doesn't think that it's your opinion that she's bad. She should have answered your question when you asked, and when she didn't you got mad. 'Case closed, let's not do it again, I love you, what should be have for dinner, Hug hug'.|`|VBBxZV0caa	You need to say you're sorry. Tell her you don't know why you got upset but you know you upset her too. Tell her your heart aches because you acted foolishly and you would like to be forgiven. Talk to your daughter like you would like to be talked to.<br>  My friend walked in on her sons while one had the others penis in his mouth. She was very shaken up and called the Dr. who said it was normal and to remind them that sex play is to be done alone.<br>  There are many days I could say I got a D in parenting, but sometimes we all screw up. Don't beat yourself up over it. I know how it feels to send your kids to bed, knowing you did something wrong and needed to sort the incident out. Your daughter will forget about the incident a lot sooner than you will. The one thing I know for sure is the importance of apologizing to your children when you know you were wrong. |`|AA11980483	Just make light of it if it ever comes up again and hope<br>  that their childish memories will forget this negative event.|`|kdu80NXzaa	Ask her if she was really upset by the way you screamed. Tell her you were wrong to shout and go crazy about it. Ask her if she wants to ask you any questions. I would tell her that you were upset because people don't really take their clothes off and play naked games with their friends. Tell her that she shouldn't take her clothes off if she doesn't feel comfortable doing it and also that she should tell you if someone tries to make her do this. Also explain that she shouldn't make another child take their clothes off because it might make them unhappy to do it. She will not be traumatized by this and will learn more as she gets older.  If she ever hears or sees something again that she doesn't understand then tell her that it is alright to come and talk to you and promise her that you won't go nuts again. I would also talk to the other child's mother, it sounds like one of them may have seen or heard something that they don't really understand.|`|lRzOCTbraa	Maybe you and the other girls mother should sit them both down together and have a good discussion about it. And remember parents make mistakes we are not perfect and it is ok to tell the two girls that you made a mistake by over reacting and it is ok to tell your child you are sorry. I know I have felt before like if I told my son I was sorry over something than he would think his behavior was right and i was wrong for yelling at him so then i didn't want to do it. but i have learned I can  say you should not have done that but i am sorry if i was too hard on you about it. And he always says it's ok mom. 
PD7NNqrmaa	sounds like boot camp daycare... he is 15 months old??? My niece was clumsy till she was 3.|`|gyzMxjAiaa	They are being unreasonable. In many states he is still classified as an Infant. They seem to have little understanding of normal child development. Find another program.|`|7oF2o4q5aa	It is a typical issue, especially when a child is big for his age, that people will expect more from them.  If you feel they are being too hard on him, you should find another daycare.  Obviously you need to be in some agreement with their methods.  If it is not hurting him physically and they are not teasing him or anything mentally then it will not hurt him to learn to be part of a group.  However, I have always had a problem with day cares and schools that are not willing to accept the difference in children.  It seems too militant to me.  Talk to them about your concerns or change day cares.  |`|Gem96NQyaa	I've been told that my sister and I both walked at 12 months, and my niece actually walked at 11 months and could manage flat surfaces just fine by 13 months, so it seems to me that 15 is a little late to still be unsteady on your feet.  But like you said, him being tall might have an effect (I doubt it's to do with muscles, though... probably more with balance).  Is he excessively clumsy?  That can be an indicator of inner ear problems.|`|a2134372f454ba425d7b423ac42d1ed2aa	Holding hands with an adult, yes; other children, no. My son started walking at 14 1/2 months, so stumbling at that age was normal for him. When did he begin to walk on his own? That would make a difference. My son is 17 months and still falls sometimes. They are expecting a lot for a 15 month to hold hands of other children for walks in my opinion. With the stumbling, it would really just depend on what month he began walking on his own. Like I said, with an adult he should be able to.|`|8370489228f0fd56a00b057b4dffeb8baa	When will my baby walk?<br>  If you listen to your mom, your MIL, your friends, your neighbors, they’ll all say a different thing.  That’s because babies walk by themselves when they’re good and ready, not when we think they should be ready.  Every baby is different.  Most babies walk somewhere between 9 and 16 months of age, some even later.  That’s a big spread of time for little tikes, so don’t worry if your baby is over a year old and hasn’t started training for a marathon.<br>  <br>  Genetics probably plays a sizable part in how soon a baby will walk, but so does fear.  If your little adventurer took a good tumble that scared him, he may put off flying solo for a couple more weeks.  Likewise, a nasty illness can tire a baby and will need to be overcome before he’s back up to speed.<br>  <br>  Undoubtedly, you’ll notice your baby on the move in some fashion.  He may scoot on his bottom, drag himself across the floor commando-style, cruise around holding on to the furniture or attached to anything that moves, like your leg.  The energy required for walking is huge, so it’s going to take time for him to build up stamina equal to his curiosity.  He’ll probably have periods for days where he’ll stand and stare into space without moving at all. You’ll eventually get tired of holding the camera for capturing the special moment… and then all of a sudden, one, two, three, “Look at me!”|`|AA12089906	He's so  young!!!  Geeez....there is no reason why he should be walking easily right now.  Some kids do it earlier, sure, but my daughter was like your son....95th percentile in height and very clumsy at first.  She too started walking at 15 months.<br>  You can't rush a developmental milestone like walking.  It simply isn't good for the child.  So when people try to rush a baby into something like that, he isn't going to fair well.  Besides the fact that it's wrong to have expectations about holding hands with other kids, whom he may not be able to keep up with.  <br>  Maybe you should look for another daycare.  Your son has to be treated with respect in that he needs time to develop both the physical skill of walking and the social skills of holding hands/keeping up with the other children.<br>  You aren't making excuses, but it sounds like your intuition is right and they are asking too much from him.  15 months old is still a baby, after all.|`|Jj0pdpWIaa	he is 15 months for crying out loud. Even at 2 they can be a little clumsy.If it were my child I would be pulling him out.I think they are expecting far,far to much.I am shaking my head.What is wrong with people today.Go for a walk with out crying.Well its going to happen.Remember he is not even at the terrible twos.I hate to say what I would be telling these daycare ladies.|`|Zv5ZyoEGaa	my brother didnt walk "properly"(without fumbling) till he was almost two and a half.<br>  and hes very tall aswell.<br>  i think maybe the daycare providers need to realise every child ages at their own pace.<br>  about the hand holding thing,<br>  they want the children to hold one anothers hands?<br>  i think that thats definately pushing it,<br>  when its hard to get toddlers to hold a prent/adults hand.<br>  maybe yuo should talk to your daycare?<br>  or find a new one?|`|w1vGhSLVaa	Depends on the child, there is nothing wrong with his development nor with theirs. Different kids walk at different ages.|`|eTesW0Eaaa	i think they might be expecting to much but maybe ur making excuses
ZmdIlkpQaa	Sure, my older kids, anyway.  For my younger kids, they basically don't listen to music without us hanging around, and while I like Ms. Winehouse's music, it's not something I would play for my 10 and 12 year old.<br>  <br>  I most assuredly would not play Eminem for my kids, not would I tolerate it being played in my house.  I think he's a misogynistic creep, and a thug, personally.|`|LbbawO7naa	Why not?<br>  Exposing kids to information on drugs is good for them.<br>  As long as you explain that they are bad, it actually helps them recognize how what ever Amy Winehouse did or was singing about was not OK.<br>  Other then that she has a good voice, and is one of the better main stream solo singers out there (there aren't many)|`|Zas9WXNwaa	Yes.  I just make sure I listen to it to, in case anything in the lyrics starts a line of questions from my kids... I just want to have a heads up about subjects that may be somewhat uncomfortable.  :)|`|LNnRSLdtaa	wtf why not<br>  |`|SLfEZIJraa	no she does coke<br>  |`|b788b1be1fa44d2860d89ba5403bece7aa	rofl|`|JRRsjByCaa	i dont listen to her but whatever floats your boat. ]ps i dont have kids].<br>  and shes the poster child for why people shouldn't do drugs. effin scary looking woman she is.|`|ewIELhBiaa	I wouldn't listen to Amy Winehouse let along make my kids listen to it. |`|73eb4728618b7c8e1b3a898b23e2f443aa	do you allow you children to listen to Billy Holiday?? same question. <br>  dont fight with your kids choices.|`|YsYYQGeiaa	did your parents allow you to listen to the beatles? they did drugs too|`|G0qsVfoUaa	Only when they are eating crackers...|`|M6yCVajaaa	Listening to her isn't the problem.....its how she looks. |`|MJoULhnHaa	im a child my parentslet me but i hate her and her stupid songs!|`|CoRWgbZPaa	Well it really depends on what type of parent you are. Me I let my children listen to pretty much everything.  My theory is that they will be exposed to it somehow.  Our world is so uncensored.  I refuse to allow anyone else to give my children their interpretation or opinion on what a song or artist may be representing. If I know what they are listening to than they feel free to be theirselves in front of me.  Just because and artist does drugs doesn't mean my kids will do drugs.  That is my job to make sure they don't.  My kids used to love her until her appearance on the Grammy's.  They were embarrassed for her.  I guess they make their own good decisions|`|BTWvxWDsaa	amy winehouse might not be a good role model, <br>  but her music shouldn't be judged as 'bad' just because of some of her own poor choices, like taking drugs, ect.<br>  <br>  her music is not really inappropriate, so i think it would be okay for children (teens more than likely) to listen to it.<br>  <br>  her style of music is actually pretty good and unique, and its something you never hear any more. (the instruments used in her songs, and her actual voice have a classical sound)<br>  <br>  anyway, its much more appropriate to listen to than some of the filthy rap and pop music out there. (not that all rap and pop music is inappropriate, some of it is good too)|`|edL2RR60aa	why not?<br>  shes a musician not a role model,<br>  if kids are gonna do drugs because there favourite singer does it, there obviously d!ckheads.<br>  amy is the best singer/songwriter around, it should have nothin to do with her personal life|`|Dm76I898aa	Well my kids are 5 & 2 no of course not. but if they were older id still say no.

So sick!|`|MPoN5bKeaa	I think she's a musical genius. What has her lifestyle got to do with her music anyhow? By the way I think she should be pitied not judged. Its sad that her life has turned out like that, Im sure she never wanted that.

Think about it would you not let your kids listen to the doors just because they smoked grass.|`|QGiHjbReaa	i mean its just a song and personally, i don't think her lyrics or lifestyle influence kids|`|sjPHZeljaa	I don't even allow myself to listen to Amy Winehouse.|`|3pFOHj8Oaa	No, mostly cause I don't like her music - not her lifestyle.|`|464OfrjEaa	yea but they can't watch the videos |`|mfOivbM2aa	Whine Not?|`|sa0LAH4laa	yes|`|k6XRVeJxaa	My mom doesnt mind me listening.

d8zxbKduaa	Speaking from experience...I had 3 babies 3 and under. Don't be in a hurry to potty train the 2 year old. Why spend 2 or 3 months trying to get them trained at 2, when if you try when they are 2 1/2 to 3, they will catch on much faster. Let them learn from the basics more than anything else. For example books, the pots and pans in the cupboards, the leaves and flowers, etc. Don't buy expensive learning tools. They are a waste. Kids get board with them. Limit t.v. time! If you spend a lot of time with them and win their hearts they will respect you more and listen to you so you won't have to use time out much. Rarely raise your voice. Speak your wishes to them firmly but calmly. If your always yelling, they lose respect. Be consistent! Do what you say your going to do. Have loads of fun with them. Sometimes just let the dishes go undone for awhile. I could go and on...|`|CfEQ1qaTaa	well your going to have to sit down a think of ways to discipline your children, have playtime and set up rules and make sure to enforce the rules. do not be leniant at all. i have to kids (about to be 3 in january) under the age of 5 (16 month old 3 yr old). my kids are very well behaved and know how to behave and listen very well and this is because i had sat downa nd made a schedule/routine of their day and i was cosistant with discipline. sure they get out of hand every now and then but what child doesnt i just stick them inthe corner for quiet alone time for a few minutes and then they are all better|`|BpbSqyvSaa	Good luck on this one, but u can do it. Find something that works for u as well as ur children.  If u  can keep them busy then u too can get stuff accomplished.  I know for bedtime in my house we have a snack, brush our teeth, read a book then its off to bed...doing this every nite tells them to go to bed its the end of the day and we are consistant w it. So whatever u do just stay consistant w ur kids and the schedule u guys have made.  And remember for the little ones they can play in a bucket ot quick oats and its not harmful.  If up a pail w oats and give em a shovel and they will play for an hr in it. Yes u will have a mess when ur finished, but one that can b vacuumed away in less than 1 min.  Have fun!!|`|5124bff875ee8fd01b232d68c31d814faa	It is very important to make them understand the fact that you will not be right at their side 24 hrs. a day and it's ok to be so. Let them see you from afar doing other things apart from taking care of them. Make sure you take care of their needs and just go about your routines taking care of your business at home and let them adjust to your lifestyle. That way they will learn to understand life as it is in the real world and will be confident and independent faster also will appreciate the quality time with mommy more. :)<br>  <br>  Good luck.
AA10167940	Blue eyes are a recessive gene so he has a better chance of having hazel eyes.  |`|nHpd4lRXaa	The baby will more than likely have Hazel eyes...the colour is much more dominant and common.|`|df378c28318ff6097f7f272b0367e6cbaa	I have blue and my husband has a deep green.  My son started out with blue eyes and now at three they have a green tint, I think they will continue to darken as he gets older.  My two year old daughter was born blue eyed as has stayed blue eyed.  I'll bet your kid is born with blue eyes and there is a 50/50 chance they will darken to green.|`|4ksa4lhWaa	Chances of blue eyes are rare even in your case.  If someone in his family has blue eyes then I would say yes chances are 50 - 50 but I would say green to brown.  <br>  <br>  I know i wanted my son to have blue eyes like me.  But my husband has brown and his whole family has brown so guess what he got brown.  Brown hair and brown eyes are the most popular.  They say by 2020 that most blue eyed and blond haird babies will be a sign of the past.  Its to bad !! |`|mGubEYTRaa	If you both had blue eyes then I'd say 100% your child would have blue eyes since that is the recessive gene.  But since the dad has hazel there is a small chance for brown eyes.|`|EeGgovyCaa	who knows, I have brown and my SO has bluish/gray eyes.<br>  <br>  both my babies have his color. Which I am so thankful for.|`|vc403uWPaa	You have blue eyes, which means since the blue gene is recessive that you only have two blue gene's. The dad, like myself, has greenish hazel eyes. So it really all depends on what his mum and dads eyes were, and what gene's they've given him. Obviously the green gene is the one that has dominated, but sometimes the green gene can be what's called co recessive to the blue gene. So the real answer is, it all depends on your baby's father. If he passes on a green gene, chances are it will have green eyes, if it passes on the blue gene, it'll have blue eyes, or if he passes on a brown gene it will def have brown eyes. Look to his parents for the answer. But you could just wait!|`|Drq7Qfk6aa	Most likely blue, because it's the stronger gene out of the 2.<br>  <br>  Although it is possible to be any colour.  Although rare, genetic throw backs are still possible!

Most babies are born with blue eyes that may or may not change anywhere up to 12-18 months. |`|QM6wiVtVaa	Could be either. Could be brown if one of your parents has brown eyes.

B5MDTdtPaa	im 40wks + 6 days<br>  <br>  yesterday i was having realy painful contractions and i really touhght it was the start of labour - they were incredibly painful coming at half hour intervals lasting about 30 seconds.....but then they jsut STOPPED! and today nothing! :( im in the same boat <br>  <br>  lucky you - they wont induce me until im exactly 42weeks! |`|sVn0Sy7taa	awww thats suxxxxx.  sounds like they'll talk about inducing you soon.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|r7q8LW7Aaa	Strangely enough - I was wondering earlier if you had went into labour! I remember you asking about the contractions.<br>  It sounds like it was just a false labour - I had one the night before last. Your body must be really close to it - have you had a membrane sweep? Rather than being induced, a sweep would probably be enough to put you into full labour now.|`|WQR0KEqZaa	hi, yes they prop was contractions and you may well have dilated a couple of Cm's i had this for a week and by time labour had started i was 5 cm dilated, labour wont be long if i was you go for a walk it might just start things up again.<br>  Anyway good luck your baby not to far .|`|ZNsNgpihaa	this is all part and parcel of early labour, don't worry things will pick up again, try walking, sex (if you feel like it) nipple stimuli and a warm bath, these are known to help women bring on labour.

fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	<a href="http://www.llli.org/llleaderweb/LV/LVAprMay02p27.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.llli.org/llleaderweb/LV/LVApr...</a><br>  Several health care professionals can assess and treat a restrictive lingual frenulum (tongue-tie), including oral surgeons, otorhinolaryngologists (also known as “ear, nose, and throat specialists” or ENTs), pediatric surgeons, and some pediatricians and general dentists. The mother can ask her health care provider to give her a referral to a specialist. There are several treatment options for a tongue-tie. The simplest and most commonly used in infants is the frenotomy, in which the frenulum is snipped with sterile scissors under a local anesthetic. Frenotomy involves very little bleeding and is a low-risk procedure. The baby can usually go directly to breast after the frenotomy, and mother may notice an immediate difference in the effectiveness and comfort of breastfeeding. Other infants may take a week or two to figure out how to use their newly freed tongue. If the baby seems to need help sucking properly after frenotomy, the mother may check with myofunctional therapists, speech and/or feeding therapists, or lactation consultants to see if they have experience working with this situation. |`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	You need to see an ENT but I would recommend waiting a bit longer.

You should get it fixed sooner rather than later because the earlier you do it the less traumatic it is for your child, it's just a tiny tiny snip when they're this little. Tongue tie is very common in my family and the procedure is very quick and easy.

Good luck!|`|AA10285288	Consult his Pediatrician who can recommend a surgeon if necessary.  And what do you mean where you can get it done privately?

There is skin under the tongue - if you look in the mirror and lift up your tongue you will see skin the is attached to the bottom of your Tong and to the the lower part of your mouth.

Like Christine Anne.....?|`|YSHOAkc1aa	A butch guy that happens to have a vjj.|`|2ad8efd099d1ebcee969022c42e93567aa	honestly the first thing that came to mind was redneck waitress.<br>  sounds like someone working Mel's dinner with Alice and saying "kiss my grits"<br>  when naming your kid, remember that they have to wear that name thru school where the wrong name can make them a target of abuse, thru work where a silly or "Exotic" name can turn off employers and thru life. as much as you may want to name your kid something special, unusual and or meaningful; nobody likes special, unusual and meaningful people. don't make your kid the plaid zebra.|`|4DAOhKFLaa	Sorry :( but it kind of sounds like "croissant" when you say it out loud. I personally don't like it, unless the first name is Chriss and middle name Anne.<br>  <br>  (Then again, my fiance wanted to name our unborn son Hannibal. So don't feel bad. At least your kid would be invited to birthday parties. Nobody would invite a kid named Hannibal to a birthday party.

lRzOCTbraa	Holy cow!! I have a six year old and I don't think they get aroused. I wouldn't make a big deal out of it because he just being curious and silly. I would sit him down and tell him that there is nothing wrong with being curious about his body but it is inappropriate to take pictures of his private parts. This would also be a good time to take to him about not touching anyone else body parts and not to let anyone touch his. Stress that he should always tell you if someone does touch him or takes pictures of him. This just looks like a good opportunity to have an important talk.|`|XlIERLQVaa	I really dont think you should talk to him about it. I dont think there is a posible way you could talk to him about it with out him being totally imbarased. He probably knows not to go anywhere else besides home and do that sort of thing.|`|V5ntCkNfaa	At least you didn't over react - that's probably the important thing!

He may not even remember doing it. If you find it again talk to him, but if this is his first time, ignore it.  He is just curious, that is all.  |`|L6xakeAtaa	Say this: 'sweety it's not good to video tape that part of your body ok...that part of your body is private, it's only for you and mommy and daddy to see right now, so don't put it on mommies phone okay, because other people might see it, and remember mommy said it's private right? So we don't want anybody else to see it. Do you understand sweety?..Okay, mommy loves you.|`|XvqZyOpYaa	Sounds like he doesn't know any better and is curious about his body a bit, but you should explain to him that when things like that happen to him that he can't record it with your phone and that he can look at it in private and ask any questions about it. I agree you shouldn't make him feel bad about it. |`|CubKN59Taa	You're the parent|`|17YHpmM0aa	uhhh....GOOD LUCK!!!|`|zHTBCneVaa	i will go with what sweet luw said
KYvlD9o9aa	it takes two sweety its both of your fault|`|dd8cb229ee241de8ca385f84ec4b33d7aa	Well both<br>  If you do not want to get pregnant, use birth control<br>  Since you told him, and he choice to have sex with out a condom it is his fault.<br>  It is yours, because you did not make him put on a condom<br>  <br>  He should get the blame as well, because he made a choice, like you to have unprotected sex.  He knows having sex without protection could lead to pregnancy.  He is to blame too<br>  <br>  Neither of you are not to blame.  <br>  |`|MtC3CWZraa	If you refused consent, he raped you and that makes it 100% his fault.  If this is the case and I was you, I wouldn’t still be with him. Marital rape is a real occurrence. <br>  <br>  If you consented, it’s both of your faults.  You’re as guilty as he.|`|AEZ0CpZnaa	you both are responsible for creating the baby growing inside you, as responsible parents you both should be looking forward to nurturing and loving this baby as best you both can, it really ain't about the blame game now, good luck x|`|dgRTkccBaa	You're both to blame. I think you both need to drop the argument and get over it.  It really doesn't matter any more, you'll just end up arguing in circles.|`|9EkFrApiaa	How old are you two?  It takes two to tango...you are both at fault.  Get over it-- you are going to have a baby and should be happy, not upset. |`|Yn6pM2Xyaa	its takes two to tango but its his fault because he didn't take responsibility for protection when you gave him ample warning.|`|AkUhaMm9aa	I think BOTH, you could have said no...and his fault too of course for pushing it...knowing it was a risk how irresponsible..<br>  <br>  my friend had the same problem..if she didnt sleep with him he will star getting mad and accusing her of cheating...and now of course he says its her fault..she had a nice baby girl..but things in her marriage are not so good.. you should talk to him and be honest with each other..you both have to admit your beautiful  mistake...and move on..if you want your marriage to get over this..<br>  you should get the IUD..it last 5 years..and they do it the same week after you give birth...|`|sIQzny5Taa	Obviously its his fault, but I don't understand how he could blame you. I mean you two ARE married, that's the point of most marriages to marry, raise a family...I don't understand how this pregnancy would be a bad thing. Just because it's unplanned doesn't mean it's any less of a miracle or blessing. Some married couples try for years and years to get pregnant, and you got pregnant by accident and are fighting over it? I wish my bf (soon to be husband) would say something stupid like that to me when we have another kid in the future.He refused to use a condom, but was determined not to have a kid....WHAT?! That makes NO sense! Did he ever take sex ed, does he not know how babies are made? I'm not trying to offend you or your husband, but honestly, does that make sense to you? Good luck I hope it gets resolved soon!|`|0iUxfCMcaa	Mostly his but it is still both of your faults. If you both didnt want children and he didnt listen to you about the birth control you could have told him no to sex until you got your next pills.<br>  <br>  Sounds like he needs to grow up alot if he wont talk to you just because you wouldnt give him sex. Whats he going to do for the 4-6wks after the baby is born?|`|2ZoUduoPaa	You are married.  You AND your husband had sex.  It's neither of yours' fault and at the same time, it's both or yours' fault.  Anytime two adults have consensual sex and become pregnant, it's not anyone's fault more than the others'.  <br>  I know you probably don't want to hear it, but hubby is right.  It's just as much yours as it is his.  <br>  <br>  Be happy, you're having a beautiful baby soon!!!|`|mgfHcckOaa	You have control over your body and what happens to it. Granted your husband wanted sex but you didn't have to have it. Personally, I think it's BOTH your faults but more so yours than his.|`|b34bca47be644e0ef6a339cf479e2cd8aa	I feel sorry for your baby.|`|AA10857340	I think it sounds like your in an abusive relationship.  If you didn't want to have sex or if you didn't want to get pregnant then you should have had the choice.  If you had sex willingly knowing that you could get pregnant and obviously he did you are both at "fault"   Anytime you have sex with or with out a condom or the pill you risk getting pregnant.  However 8 months into this you should not be having this discussion if you are it sounds like your husband does not want thsi baby.  You better watch for signs of abuse.  Verbal is abuse too look for verbal and physical.|`|ad47e66108ebe5b08193efaa9725a287aa	I do not think that that it is your fault alone or your husband's fault alone.  you are both to blame.  It takes two to make a baby and you both knew regardless of the situation what could happen.  He knew that you were not on birth control and yet he still wanted to have intercourse with you without protection.  You knew that you were not on birth control and yet you still had intercourse without protection.  This tells me that you two were obviously not that dead set against having a baby because you both knew what the consequences would be from your actions.  I think that it is silly that either of you are trying to blame each other.  You should both be so blessed that you are able to get pregnant as there is a lot of people out there who cannot.|`|NjVnvBBeaa	I'm sorry that it has to be someone's "fault." Babies are a blessing and I hope yours is treated as such.<br>  <br>  But you both made the decision to have unprotected sex. Who initiated it doesn't matter, unless he continued after you asked him to stop and told him no. That would, of course, be rape. But if you willingly participated and he knew you weren't on the pill, you are both the reason this pregnancy occured.|`|3wmiypiNaa	it's mostly your fault for letting that happen but it's also his fault for being that way to you. He's not respectful to your feelings it seems and you shouldn't have to live like that. He needs to understand how a good relationship works. If you both knew this could happen and he didn't want to use a condom both of ya'll should've known better. |`|L8peUnIPaa	I find this very petty. Regardless, you both had sex . No rape was involved, so you can go back to the saying, "It takes two to tango." You had a choice, he had a choice & for whatever reason, you both had sex, so its both your faults, but I hope this doesn't affect the parenting of this child. No offense<br>  OB/GYN RN & mom|`|ER2Ood5Iaa	I think its too late for the blame game.<br>  <br>  Sounds like he was behaving less responsibly then you. But in the end you both contributed.<br>  <br>  I'd move on.<br>  <br>  Even if you are in the right, arguing about it now will not achieve anything but pain.<br>  <br>  Soon you will have a wonderful child and you won't have any regrets.<br>  |`|kfCVRyVjaa	Errr - sounds like a wonderful marriage.......<br>  <br>  Its BOTH of your faults.  If you didn't want kids then either he should have padded up or you should have put your foot down about having sex until you had the pill again.<br>  <br>  Protected sex is the COUPLES reponsibility. Not individual.|`|1QyfWEE8aa	You allowed him to screw you, knowing full well that you weren't protected, however you didn't screw alone. You're both immature and are unable to make intelligent adult, life altering decisions. |`|gerSWMvBaa	both of you are at fault!<br>  You shouldn't have given in, and he shouldn't have pressured you.<br>  You need to stop playing the blame game though, or your child is going to have a terrible life.|`|8zdPI8Qsaa	Both of your faults, but it seems there are much more important things for yall to be thinking about now rather than dwelling on who's 'fault' this beautiful gift is... |`|wYNzqiEbaa	Wow you don't seem mature enough to be a mother. Seriously you both need to grow up. And maybe think about getting a divorce lawyer. Your husband sounds like a controlling ******|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	It doesn't matter that you didn't want to have sex. You had sex knowing that you weren't covered so you are both responsible. I mean come on. |`|rBAac9ksaa	obviously your fault. |`|dqSA7j7gaa	BOTH!|`|HqVoLzjcaa	Well, It takes 2, to get the job done!!!|`|6d1c56bb07d8433546ab2691bb56e09baa	Well, honestly, it's both yours and your husbands fault that you got pregnant.  You are both adults here and he knew that you were not on birth control, which you could have gotten refilled or spoke to your doctor to get 1 month until you could get a prescription for more.  He also could have used a condom even if he didn't want to so there was very little chance you could become pregnant.  <br>  <br>  Even if he wanted to have sex and you didn't, your husband should respect your wishes and not have made you.  You do not need to be a submissive wife for any reason.  You have that right to say no even if it is to your husband and he should respect you for it and not just act like a child and get mad at you and not talk to you because if it.  <br>  <br>  So, if the topic comes up again, tell your husband, you both are responsible for you becoming pregnant.  It takes 2 to have a baby!  It's not one persons fault at all least of all, the babys fault.  It didn't ask for anything and is not to be blamed at all.  |`|6frr3VM0aa	Im sorry that in your relationship fault is being upon anyone over a child.<br>  <br>  This is supposed to be a happy time, not a time where you're arguing over whose fault it is.<br>  <br>  But honestly...why did you allow him to have sex with you when you knew he wouldnt use a condom and you didnt have birthcontrol?<br>  <br>  Why did he initiate when HE knew that you didnt have birthcontrol, when he refused to wear a condom??<br>  <br>  Really, its both your faults...if you feel you need to place blame over the creation of a child. You both knew that you were unprotected chemically, and both of you knew he wasnt going to wear a condom. He's stubborn for initiating, and you're subborn for giving in.<br>  <br>  But really...stop worrying about silly things like this.<br>  <br>  You have much bigger fish to fry since you've only got about 3-4 weeks until your baby arrives.<br>  <br>  This is a joyous time...enjoy what is to come. Children are wonderful little blessings.|`|peMrRVwxaa	It takes 2 to tango.  If you ran out of your pills then you should have gone to the store and got something else to use for birth control.  There is a wide variety of female contraceptives now days.  It is also his fault for not putting a rain coat on his little guy.  It doesn't matter who initiated the sex, you both are separate people with 2 minds for decision making.  If you don't open your legs, he can't get it in.  Who cares if he won't talk to you for a while and gets mad, he'll get over it.|`|wh3FWpDtaa	Both.<br>  <br>  I am married and my wife has done that multiple times. I have never refused to use a condom though, but she hates it when I do.<br>  <br>  She also has sex for the sole reason of making me satisfied, but its not like I am mean to her or abuse her. Marriage is about compromise, bartering, and giving and taking. I do a lot for her and barter for sex in return, nothing else.<br>  <br>  It also makes me angry when she refuses me, because of all the things I do for her. All she has to do is get naked and open her legs, not a big deal.<br>  <br>  Birth control is a two way thing, you need to remember to refill it. I would take male birth control if there were such a thing, and if I did I would never forget to refill it.|`|CebrECkiaa	it's both your fault, it takes two. But I understand now that you add the second part. He sounds like a jerk! although you should have put your foot down. but in my honest opinion, it doesn't sound like a healthy relationship for you or your child. good luck|`|H726SKFNaa	It's his fault. I assume you are submissive to him on a regular basis, which means he makes the final decisions....which makes this his fault. You win. |`|fbadd74f7760c7144d4d163edb27a79eaa	blame the kid!
AUargJTaaa	not at all! I am not a mother, but I have heard FAR WORSE stories. Time for your mother and grandmother to find a hobby b/c they are trying to "help" too much.|`|TCpPdqcBaa	That's just terrible. You are NOT the worst mother ever!<br>  Working and going to school full time with a child is incredibly hard, and I give you props on that! I admire you!<br>  EVERYONE forgets things from time to time, whether it's putting extra diapers in the bag, or putting extra blankets in the bag, whatever it is, everyone forgets! Babies are also going to bump their head occasionally. They're going to fall down occasionally. It's part of being a kid, it just happens.<br>  And your grandmother said you were a bad mother because he threw his hat out of the stroller? Tell her that calling her granddaughter a terrible mother and ridiculing you over stupid stuff makes her not such a great grandmother. This is YOUR son, not theirs. They shouldn't be the ones deciding how to raise him, how to dress him, or anything like that. YOU and HIS FATHER should be the ones making those decisions!<br>  You are a young mother, and you are still learning the tricks of the trade. Don't worry, you are NOT a bad mom. It will get easier.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and God bless you and your son!|`|mZi7R0Enaa	I would be sick of it too and you are NOT, by any means, a bad mom. Your schedule is very busy, glad you are staying in school, and I am certain you must be exhausted. Please learn to take care of yourself first or you won't be any good for anyone else. Forgetting to bring the diaper bag and your child bumping his head are normal happenings in the life of every mom and child. The fact that you have written of your concern shows me what a *really great mom* you actually are. I say KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK, love yourself and do NOT let your relatives get you down. Best wishes!|`|ZeKnInbjaa	you sound like a typical new mom. don't worry...read a couple of books and talk to other moms about things you are not sure of. you don't sound like the worse mom to me...you sound like a mom who is doing her best! I bet your son will turn out great! trust me...I was there and I ended up getting away from the naysayers and my son is now on his way into LAW SCHOOL! (I wish I had ignored a lot of negative things people said to me when he was little and just followed my own heart...now everyone wants to sing him and me praises all day long):(|`|zHRWklEWaa	To answer you first question yo u sound like a fine mother. You son s not in any danger not i he wrapped in a plastic bubble.  I would tell your mother that while you respect her desire to help she needs to step back and let you raise your son. After you convey that respond <br>  "Interesting, whats for dinner"<br>  Thanks for the advice, whats for dinner"<br>  "i'll keep that in mind, whats for dinner"<br>  This gets the point across that you do not want her advice and that the topic is not up for discussion. It works particually well when it is nowhere near dinner time.|`|57DG5xC1aa	I think the fact that you're working AND going to school full time is awesome. You're making a better future for your son that way. Kids bump their heads, exploring is a part of being a kid. And you don't have eyes on the back of your head so it's completely ok that you didn't see him throw his hat. <br>  <br>  I think you're doing fine mom.|`|rmS3Ribaaa	Well you don't Really sound Like a horrible parent.<br>  Your mother and grand-mom Are just concerned with parenting way to much. Tell them to leave the parenting to you, the real parent of the child! I could understand if the kid was there's but your talking about your son! best of luck girl friend :D|`|aqvzWF17aa	No.  You are far from the worst Mom ever and should be proud that you are raising your son.  You are so young still at 20 and it's a lot of responsibility.  You can't change what other people do or say but you can change your reaction to it.  My in laws used to give LOTS of constructive advice.  I can't say I really thought they did a good job with their kids growing up (from what my husband has described) so the easiest way to keep the peace was just to smile and say "thank you so much for your thoughts."  I still would do what I thought was right, they got to voice their opinion so everyone is happy.  Your child will be growing so fast and these days will be long behind you soon.  Good luck.|`|R6hfqGuOaa	 I dont understand why your mom and Grandma are so mean so what if he your son threw his hat out of the stroller kids do that kind of stuff. I suppose talking to those people wouldn't do any good. At least your trying so i don't think your the worst mother ever.|`|dHjjLozcaa	no, your not the worst mom ever nor are you stupid. the worst mom ever beats her son. just do your best, and take their harsh criticism, maybe it will help you to be a better mommy for your son. :-)|`|tkkYIdIvaa	Tell your mom and grandmother that he's YOUR son and you can do what you think is best for him.

You're definitely not the worst mother ever.  No parent gets through raising their children without having little heart attacks when they see their child hurt.  Forgetting diapers is not the end of the world either.  Surprisingly enough, children survive it most of the time.  Nobody gets an instruction manual, and almost everyone has to figure it out for themselves.  I have a feeling your parents weren't perfect either.  <br>  <br>  I've known children raised by drug addicts and alcoholics.  They went through hell and neglect. Sometimes they even turn into healthy adults.  If they are all right, your child will be.  After all, you're not a drunk or a drug addict, and you care about your son.  |`|aPxUwv8kaa	My daughter is 20 with a 1 year old daughter. She's working full time and going to school full time.

I do get upset when there's something my daughter doesn';t do because she's being lazy.<br>  If the diaper is messy and I can tell it hasn't been changed in awhile, I get upset. Dirty face/hands...I get bent out of shape.If he's eating stuff off the floor that could hurt him, walking/crawling around, going where he wants, doing what he wants with no supervision, that's bad.<br>  Every baby bumps their head...that kind of thing can't be helped.<br>  As long as you are taking care of him to the best of your ability and not being lazy about it,  you're doing a good job.<br>  Spending time with him, playing, teaching him to talk, teaching him right from wrong are the more important things. just don't ignore him and let everyone else take responsibility for him, that's your job....first and foremost.<br>  As far as everyone wanting to control everything....let them know that when you aren't working or at school, you are the one that needs to take care of him.

Why would a mother tell their own child that they are horrible mom. Maybe you don't spend as much time with him as much as you like. Yes it is hard to take on a job and go to school. Just a suggestion why don't you take time when you get home to play a game with him and read him a book. Before you go to bed read a book and tell a story. Take a Saturday or Sunday and just spend time with him and stay away from you school work. They will not stay young for ever. You should get more organized. Make a list on how long you think it should take you to study a day and from that you can prepare for your study and have time with your child. Try to get more organized.

Try and talk to them or maybe you can get out on your own so you are not under their scrutiny|`|ZIzXc7j0aa	other people have opinions about everything ... my family told me i was a bad mom too because every time they see my son he isn't wearing socks ... he Hates socks! he kicks them off all the time and i understand him i hate socks too ... now i tell them to mind their own business.. you should do the same!!<br>  <br>  your not a bad mom and shame on the people who criticize|`|eOGBzIyJaa	well you do have to remember that it is a learning experience and you should take their advice up to a curtain point. and no you are definitely not a bad mother, there are just a few things you need to work on. being a mother is hard, and not all mothers are perfect. |`|q70Xur7Jaa	Your son, take care of him the best 'You Can'.<br>  don't let others interfere if it upsets you.<br>  Also things have changed since they raised their kids and they might have done it differently.

Look on-line for answers--read baby books...and you will be fine. Tell your mom to go to HELL|`|MOsStEbqaa	Don't let them in your life for awhile.

Don't listen to them. |`|13762a663ccece7c93c7dbaf42778b4aaa	Tell your mother and grandmother that "If I'm the worst mother ever, then by whose example is that?" Only a terrible mother would criticize their child's parenting as the "worst ever" in the face of a forgotten diaper, a bumped head, and a thrown hat. Then you got her mom looking down on you TOO? When you become a grandparent, try not to be like them. It seems to be genetic.<br>  <br>  My mother-in-law is like that, and I just brush her off. She was drunk most of the time when my wife was a little girl, and called my wife a little b****, so if she ever gets out of line, I'm armed with that knowledge, and will throw it in her face.|`|pG2YLyzxaa	Your mother and grandmother a being too harsh.  I'm sure that you are a great mother and you are doing the best you can.  I had my baby girl McKenna when I was 19, and everyone told me how to do this and that, because I was so young.  Eventually you have to ignore them because you know what is best for your baby.  They aren't perfect, and they should be encouraging you instead of criticizing you.  Keep your head up and do the best you can.  I wish you luck for the future, and just remember that you are a great mom and stay strong!  Have a great day!|`|wVxO27o7aa	i know how you feel. my family were exactly the same, they criticised everything i did and i got post natal depression with my 2nd child. forgetting things is normal and its not the end of the world, and children will always have accidents even if you watch them like a hawk, its part of growing up. you need to tell them to stop right now and slowly but surely take control. make the decisions and if they dont like it, they will have to choose either to not see you as much or to accept your decisions coz your the mum and you know best. their interfierance could ruin the relationship between you and your son. good luck and you sound like a great mumx|`|V1SM96RQaa	of course not! dont let your mom and grandmother make you feel like that. you can't be perfect! and tell them how they make you ffeel. hope it gets better.<br>  xoxo : )|`|FvPNRYCJaa	atleast your trying and you care<br>  you are deffinetely not the worst mom ever<br>  there has been way worse.|`|Op3jsGBBaa	nah...its just the first time, tell them to f**k off and you just try everyday to get a little better, get info, ask other moms or stuff like that|`|9Ptx7GPwaa	This may be difficult, especially if you live under the same roof as them. But have control. He is YOUR son, and it is your turn to raise a child. Have everything written down on a schedule, and take control of the situation. Give an opinion whenever they put their input, and tell them that you want to let him spend time with his dad, even if it's in your presence at first, so they feel more comfortable. Your baby has to interact with his father. There are so many babies without a father around, so take advantage, and make it possible for them to bond. You wanted to grow up fast; so now take responsibility for your actions. |`|GUakipOraa	hi, i am a 25 year old mother of a 14 month old son, he is a handful don't worry I am a stay at home mother and i forget things all the time! you have extra responsibilities with school and a job, and not to mention your son who is the most time consuming. Remember, nobody is perfect! just because your son threw his hat out of the stroller does NOT make you a bad mother, my son is constantly hitting his head on everything, what is going on is that you let everything your mom and grandma say bother you, listen to them when it is something that is important and let the other stuff go in one ear and out the other. <br>  Try living with your boyfriends parents and have them let your son get away with everything, my sons grandpa lets him play with the remote and when we go to a friends house he thinks it's ok to play with theirs. <br>  Me and his grandmother had a yelling match the other night because she didn't think that i should discipline my son for getting in the cat litter box. All i did was slap his hand, wash them and put him on the couch where i could see him while i cleaned up his mess. His grandma came out to comfort him and i told her not to and she said that i couldn't do that to a 14 month old, I told her that one way or the other he needed to know that it is not ok for him to play in cat **** and piss. I don't want my son to get a disease. <br>  Wow, I think i needed to vent, you are not the only person going thru critisim from someone you love just keep your head up and know that you are doing the best you can in the circumstance you are in. good luck and best wishes, look for the good in life and let the bad things slide. everything has a way of working itself out and one day you will find your voice and tell your family how you feel and they will understand better than you think, they have been where you are and they need to remember that it was not always easy.|`|WL84hfWPaa	Sorry that you are going through all of this.  It is hard enough to work and go to school full time and raise a small child.  You should pat yourself on the back for taking on such important responsibilities as you are.  Sometimes parents  continue to treat their grown children like they are still kids because they have a hard time seperating the fact you are no longer a child and cannot see you or want to treat you as the adult you are.  I can see that you are in a tough spot because you still need their help with all that you have on your plate.  Try not to take how they treat you or what they say personally because it is their problem they feel the need to make you feel worse about yourself not your problem.  Keep being the mom you are to your son and the only control you have is to not own the way they are making you feel.  It is hard to change people and the way they behave.  It sounds like you are still at the point that you possibly need their help in ways since you are trying hard to make your life better for you and your son, so think of it like this...allow them to help you under your terms, but realize once you finish school and your son gets older, all this will change and you will be able to rely on them less..giving you more control in the end.  Hang in there and do your best to ignore their cut-downs.  Best of Luck!
pXSKSS3daa	It's not stupid or silly.<br>  <br>  My son, at the end, would push his little bottom out so to get some relief I'd gently nudge him with my hand and he'd move. It's an amazing feeling, part of my pregnancy that I miss!|`|AA11112019	she will be able to feel it. when i was pregnant my baby girl would always push her foot out and i could see it so i would push it and she would push back|`|8gawYNoqaa	I remember once when I was about that far along she kept pushing and pushing up against my tummy. So I put my hand right where she kept pushing and the next time she did it I pushed back. She immediately pulled back and it was so sweet I could totally fee that it was her foot! So yes I do think you baby can feel you.|`|m7SEBUgQaa	yes, they can feel you i used to do the same thing with my finger and she would kick back like almost as if i were tickling her i would also lay on my back and set a remote on top of my belly button and she would kick at it cause she could feel it. it was great i miss those things i hope you have fun with her they don't stay little forever don't take it for granted love every second of her :)
YI31TqNNaa	yeah, all kinds of discharge are normal. unless it is maybe tainted red, cuz then that could mean you were losing your mucous plug. but your body is going through multiple changes now, and i noticed that my discharge changed over the course of my pregnancy (along with everything else!!)|`|iXSoX6Rnaa	Discharge is normal.
9P26sacKaa	No, you do not have to be active to go into labor.  In fact, walking and general activity are not guaranteed ways to start labor anyhow, as you know.  They are sometimes good at getting baby into a better position and putting pressure on your cervix from baby's end, due to gravity, so this might help a little, but it won't start contractions.  It might help your cervix get ready for labor, but it doesn't actually start labor. <br>  <br>  It would be good to be active every day, but with other children, you probably are pretty active without additional activities to think about.<br>  <br>  Getting closer to labor-time, it's best to rest and take care of yourself, getting a little bit of exercise but not over-doing it by any means.  When you're tired, rest.  You'll need all the energy you can get when you do have your baby.<br>  <br>  So no, resting is not likely to make your labor take longer to come, but walking and rocking do help get your cervix ready and might help baby get into a better position.  As for getting baby in a better position, I would check out Spinning Babies to get some information about malpositions and exercises to do that can help: <a href="http://www.spinningbabies.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.spinningbabies.com</a><br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|DLj3dqWjaa	<a href="http://www.ihatemisty.com?id=hu5jqvj76ufynuscx38hpz38romi5w" rel="nofollow">http://www.ihatemisty.com?id=hu5jqvj76uf...</a>|`|xwOwsZvEaa	keep going love it wont b long now try pineapple, curry, cod liver oil, yuk,|`|TDLmhGauaa	Your baby will get tired if left for 2 more weeks and then the hospital will have to induce you. My little sister was a very slow labour and in the end she was getting into some stress so they had to deliver her by cesearean. Not only do the hospital have a duty of care to you - their patient but they also owe your baby the best start in life. If you have not gone into full blown labour soon then demand with all of your right (like I had to with my step mother) to be taken in and put on relief - at the very least - before they decide whether to induce or not.<br>  Yes I am told a lot of activity does help but it always hard to say what the best methods are for jump starting your labour, maybe other mums can give you good ideas.|`|X9Dpyrg9aa	I know that everyone says to just keep walking, but i really believe that rest brings on labor. I was trying everything with my second one to go into labor and nothing was working and when I finally decided to give up and just relax she decided that she wanted to come out. I took a nice bath one night on the advice of my mother in law, and a few hours later my water broke.
LKIhUMCgaa	yes, at this point ur stomach should be moving up, so ur stomach will end up in ur rib cage, if the bra is holding the rib cage too tight and not letting it expand right for too long, ur stomach can end up hurting.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	It could be from the clothes but it's not 100%. I like wearing bras that are tighter and get the lines on my skin from that but it never causes me internal pain.
jb86k8BRaa	Okay, I learned this in my biology class...<br>  <br>  Firstly, it is Bb, not bB, it's always capitals first.<br>  <br>  Secondly, eye color does not have a genotype as simple as two alleles.  It is so complex and a combination of alleles and genes, it is considered polygenic inheritance.  Polygenic inheritance is when there are multiple genes at multiple loci(locations) Traits such as eye color, hair color, height, and skin tone do have genotypes but have more than two pairs of alleles so telling you your genotype would be a little impossible unless you see a genetic counselor.

No, I don't agree.  I DO have many children (5), and while I freely admit that I am far from perfect, I also freely claim to be a good mother.

2MKvrydWaa	it's just colutrum.i got mines at 15 weeks and all the way through my pregnancy i had the same thing happen to me.please don't scrub ur nipples b/c nipple stimulation isn't good to do during ur pregnancy b/c that is a way to bring labor on which is something u don't want right now.congrats on the beautiful baby:-)|`|jWssapl3aa	It's colostrum, no big deal. It's like the "pre-milk", if you will. PLEASE do not scrub your nipples, you'll regret it later. Not only does the nipple stimulation bring on false labor, but the constant scrubbing will dry out your nipples... then later, when you're breastfeeding, they will be sooooo sore. I almost quit breastfeeding altogether b/c of the pain. But luckily I got thru it thanks to some Lanolin. You definitely need to take it easy on your nipples! Lol|`|yCwPxulYaa	It is completely normal. You have a lot of hormonal things going on in your body right now.  You do not need to scrub it off.  You can gently wipe it off with water if you find in necessary but it is all part of being pregnant.|`|9X09kM4oaa	It sounds like colostrum, it happens to a lot of women.|`|wOOOYMa9aa	Your doctor can confirm this at your next prenatal visit but the white film you see is most likely colostrum.  Use warm water to wash it off gently in the shower.  I had that too during both my pregnancies.  Sometimes colostrum may eventually form a crust and you might experience dryness and sensitivity in that area.  You can use lanolin to prevent this dryness.  <br>  <br>  You will be going through a lot of changes for the duration of your pregnancy so its a good idea to register at an online pregnancy tracker.  Tracking your pregnancy will help you know what to expect, from changes in your body to the progression of your baby's development.  Here is a good site to register.  <br>  <a href="http://pregnancy.emedtv.com/pregnancy-week-by-week/pregnancy-week-by-week.html" rel="nofollow">http://pregnancy.emedtv.com/pregnancy-we...</a><br>  <br>  If you learn more about what to expect you will worry less- which is best for you and baby.  Congratulations and best of luck to you!|`|XHgfjikqaa	Sounds like you might have thrush...see your doctor.|`|XzV4bUeFaa	Yes you can have milk leakage during pregancy.

9ebe04169d04d9c952a946440b3ad139aa	Generally not, from what I've been told at work. You may be able to use the pool for part of your labour but you won't be able to get in the pool once you start on the antibiotics. Most women don't actually give birth in a pool anyway, if you stay in there for your whole labour, you just end up very wrinkly and sore! Most just use it for pain relief and relaxation in the earlier part of their labour so ask when you get to the hospital, you may be able to use it for a while at least.

kaqPSgTVaa	Your stomach doesn't get hard it's your uterus. Your uterus is usually at your belly button at 20 weeks so at about 20 weeks on is when your belly will feel harder. If you think you are pregnant and it's early on and your belly is hard it's most likely bloating and or constipation. It's not the baby yet. Not by a long shot. I'm 14 weeks Wednesday and by uterus is just barely above my pelvic bone.|`|BX4Ja1Rgaa	your stomach get hard only when you go into labor and im guessing that's not what you mean. and if i think what your thinking you began to feel the child inside you at about two mths its a little trick my mother in law showed me when i was preggy with my first. she felt my tummy and said yep you have a little bump inside your belly and that means you are pregnant. i though she was nuts but two weeks later i felt so sick that i went to a dr. and got the good news.|`|L7S24gkEaa	echoing the other answer at abut 20 weeks your uterus will be level with your belly button. <br>  i rememberat 12 - 13 weeks i started to be able to feel that the uterus was peeping up over the pelvic bone. if i layed on my front it felt a bit like a bubble  of air or something in the area that i used to get perio pains. really wierd feeing. but your stomach wont feel hard until the uterus is well up over the pelvic bone so maybe 14 - 15 weeks it will start to feel hard to you when you feel it from the outside|`|tcHkn0VIaa	I began to feel the tightening around 10 weeks because the uterus in pushing up on my other organs but it can be different for every woman|`|r6IRYVRnaa	Your stomach dose not get hard! mine didn't until i was 7 months maybe!! Well Good Luck

QQUZRXa3aa	i would keep it and deal with the consequences. if you had unprotected sex that results in a baby! you cant make the baby pay for your mistakes!|`|ctMLdGg9aa	have the baby and put it up for adoption.  don't kill the baby with abortion because you will probably regret it when your older.. or maybe you won't but i would.  and if you have the baby and put it up for adoption.. think about doing open adoption because i don't know what id do for that|`|6359becf9ea83832470afde520533f08aa	I would do what I think is best for me. I wouldn't care what anyone else would think. You think about you self first. I would think about what kind of life could I give this baby and that young. What steps should I take to not get pregnant.|`|yKS2UI87aa	Look for the best Adoption agency, have the baby, and feel better knowing you didn't kill a human and also provided a childless couple a baby, stay in school.|`|czTz8z7iaa	i would have the baby and raise him/her i could never have an abortion and i dont think i could ever give my baby up|`|tle3AGJraa	I would stop pretending to be pregnant with my friends and go on with my life.  I wouldn't have had sex at that age.|`|tLcOikV8aa	I would have the baby and then put it up for adoption|`|oKZ3GstXaa	abortion|`|ir0qEV3waa	one of the two...have the child and put up for adoption or abortion but seriously what were u thinking??? either one its ruined your life no matter what.. .putting a child up for adoption will destroy you mentally and having an abortion you regret it but know its for the best but it stays with you every single day. abortion can also mess with your body in alsorts of different ways mentally and physically it can also risk the chance of you having trouble conceiving in the future...im afraid its not a win win situation...somewhere along the lines you lose...|`|CvWeA4kaaa	First of all... everyone makes mistakes, don't feel bad about yourself. <br>  <br>  Second, Everyone's situation is so different. I don't believe in abortion, but thats just me. If you decide to keep it, you could still turn out to be a great mother despite your young age.... You'll just have to grown up a little faster. I think a lot of it will depend on you family support. Dont' make any decisions based on other's opinions, do what your think is best for YOU. I recommend talking with your family first, I'm sure they'll be upset but loving and supportive.|`|oNJxoVwiaa	id slit my friggin wrists.<br>  id not be able to handle that.<br>  theres a couple over in england, my Bio teacher went tehre over Break, and the youngest parents over tehre, made the enws.<br>  the girl was 14, the gu was 11.<br>  crazzzziee.|`|DwxVKeWWaa	Since I dont believe in abortion, I would probably let my parents know and maybe try to stay at a relative's in another town, have the baby and then give it up for adoption.|`|WFq9Tc9Aaa	I would be still wondering what happened, then I would realize that I was retarded.|`|HahRhoQYaa	well when i was 12 i wasnt having sex. i would go talk to someone you really trust.|`|p0prrzf2aa	i wouldn't be having sex at 12 years old in the 1st place|`|cj7sSPZEaa	That depends on why I was pregnant at 12.  Did I decide that I was going to have sex?  Adoption.  Was I forced to have sex against my will?  Abortion.|`|AA11661476	Hello.<br>  That is very very young to be pregnant.  My niece is 7 years old and I can not imagine that she would even think of sex at 12.  Her father and my sister would flip and so would I.  <br>  <br>  I was 17 and was pregnant and in a relationshp and my mother took me to get an abortion at 3 1/2 months pregnant because I was getting my p every month and not showing. <br>  It ruined my chances now at getting pregnant|`|3K7ffKn2aa	I would pray and thank God for my miracle b/c at 12 i was just getting my first kiss.  kids today man (shakes head) ...|`|a6e7SRYzaa	I wouldn't be seeing as I wasn't having sex at that age.|`|v0aKxF6iaa	i would never be in that position so idk what i would do

AA11612508	i am stay at home mom too, with older children thou..3 and 6. although i would havent it anyother way, its very boring sometimes. But i just stay on a schedule. that helps. Since your daughter is young you dont really have the school schedule etc to go by so i think i would be bored too. Just get into a routine. Showers in the morning, walk or park before lunch. eat lunch at home or eat out to change it up, then come home prep for dinner with lil girl, make dinner for daddy, then pj, family time, bed time for liil girl.<br>  <br>  that is how my life is, scheduled but keeps my busy. i have couple hours a day i am bored as hell but mostly i have tons to do..|`|Q05rrSX4aa	Are there any places you can take your daughter?  Like indoor playgrounds, mommy groups, take her swimming.  Bake with her, play games.  <br>  <br>  I wouldn't feel good about the online jobs, I have looked into a couple and they seem very fishy to me, most you have to pay to get started.  You could seel Avon or Mary Kay.|`|5baec14131fd7b822f3da2903a188129aa	enjoy this down time because you will not be bored once the new one arrives.  You'll wonder to yourself why you wished for something else to do.  I had the same feelings when it was just my son and me... (and prego with my daughter).  Now, they drive me crazy and I don't seem to get anything done.  My house used to be spotless when I only had one.  Now, I can't get anything done.|`|T7IuHYVzaa	You could work at a day care, or look for friends or relatives who need childcare and offer to look after their child in your home for a reasonable rate.|`|VGyOycs4aa	teach your kid things that will help her later in life. a sport perhaps. make her into some kind of child protege or put her in baby commercials|`|8ossSEMNaa	You could always start a hobby like scrapbooking or redecorating the house...those aren't necessarily cheap hobbies, but there are a lot of affordable options out there.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	well fill your day with fun! you have an adventurous 14 month old willing to explore and learn, play games go swimming go to the park, relax when she naps.
