w7Ffw6MYaa	Yes, in order to get messaging plans for half-price, you must have a MONTHLY PLAN ($24.99 or more).<br>  <br>  Pay-as-you-go plans DO NOT have the half-price messaging plan, therefore unlimited texting would be $20 per month. If you just want texting, you can pick the 20cents/min basic rate plan and only pay for minutes as you need them. So with no calling on pay-as-you-go and Unlimited messaging, it would be $20 per month.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|7YOKSvRTaa	you need to pay more $10 to get the unlimited messaging pack apart from your $24.99 monthly plan|`|AA10377650	My daughter has unlimited messaging only.

jKc7aDCwaa	1. The laser can tell an original disc from a copied one because of how much power it takes the laser to read it. Writable media like DVD-R's require more power to for the laser to bounce off the disc and read the binary pits (0 and 1's) as opposed to a nice factory pressed CD or DVD.  Another reason why some DVD players and consoles can read commercially pressed CD and DVDs and some recordable media but not RW's, RW's require even more power.<br>  <br>  2. I'm pretty sure this is the same for the Wii, but starting with the GameCube, Nintendo reads from their media from the outside in. Regular CDs and DVDs are read from the inside out. <br>  The Pros: It provides Nintendo with a unique copy protection method as most regular CD/DVD readers can't understand how to read the data backwards. If you can't read the disc, you can't dump it and burn a copy (which is why in order to dump a disc, you need to do it directly from the GC/Wii's drive or one of the "magic" drives that CAN read them.) Also, discs are read faster from their outer edges than their insides: "If the drive runs at constant speed, the outside edge moves fastest, and therefore can, if all the other bits are up to it, be faster or contain more information than inside edges." The big Con: the outside edges of a disc are more likely to get damaged than the insides. <br>  <br>  And to answer another person's thoughts about the legality of this on fair use backup clauses of the USA's DMCA: doesn't matter. Nintendo says you're not supposed to make legal backups, so you're not supposed to. Sony and Nintendo have the same clauses in their EULAs and have successfully litigated against common end users (read, regular folks) for making legal backups with no intention of piracy. You agree to Nintendo's EULA when you use the hardware and software.|`|ktbyKKK9aa	Ok. Well, I suppose that the DVD Disks used have alot of security put up so you can't do anything to the data on the disk.|`|5HfuI3MEaa	the disc reader is probably damaged, it happened to me a few times. i traded it in for a new one. back up ur memory on an SD card first.|`|d8h0pDExaa	they are copied|`|3yNmclJgaa	The Wii, a bit like the XBOX - searches the disc inserted for code which basically tells the console that 'this is a WII game inserted' - if it finds the bit of code.. it will read the game as normal.<br>  <br>  If you insert a backup - the Wii picks this up as a DVD-R or other disc and does not read it.<br>  <br>  This is where chips and softmodding come into it.<br>  By installing a chip, this tricks the part on the Wii that does the check for the genuine disc, making the Wii think that any WII game put in the drive is genuine.<br>  <br>  Softmodding just allows you to boot the game without a chip using a launcher application.|`|PnNAClgSaa	you cant do a copied Wii disk. You have to $$$ the game|`|uctxzjIIaa	Because console manufacturers are smart enough to include some copy-protection features ni their system, so you don't have everyone renting games for the system just to copy it and then keep the copy.<br>  <br>  Granted, this seems to violate part of the Copyright Act, but so far that issue hasn't been challenged in court.|`|tzFkYLGqaa	ha

If you currently have an existing AT&T phone, you could take the SIM out and put it in the Iphone and that would give you voice service.

Había entonces dos caminos para resolver el problema: hacer que la máquina funcione mejor, o que los mecanógrafos funcionen peor. El primero no ofrecía demasiadas soluciones.<br>  <br>  El insigne inventor decidió entonces complicar al máximo la disposición de las letras en el teclado (originalmente era alfabética), de forma tal que al escribir se perdiera el mayor tiempo posible y que los mecanógrafos no pudieran superar a la máquina. La distribución de las letras en el teclado hizo que las combinaciones silábicas más frecuentes debieran teclearse con el mismo dedo (la forma más lenta de hacerlo) y que la mano derecha se encargara de sólo el 40% del teclado, dejando el 60% para la mano izquierda, generalmente menos hábil (al menos, para el 90% de la población mundial, que es diestra).<br>  <br>  Al principio el teclado de la máquina de escribir que es de donde desciende el de la computadora, si que estaba distribuido en órden alfabético<br>  <br>  un saludo!|`|228ff8fc402414588b912da4f08839f0aa	Muy interesante tu pregunta.

Sucede que la Remington, que en aquella época fabricaba máquinas de coser, implantó el teclado QWERTY en sus primeras máquinas de escribir Lo que significa que más personas fueron obligadas a aprender ese sistema, y más compa?ías pasaron a fabricar estos teclados, hasta que se convirtió en el único modelo existente. Repito: el teclado de las máquinas y de los ordenadores fue dise?ado para que se mecanografiase más lentamente, y no más rápido, ?comprende? Intente cambiar las letras de lugar y no encontrará un comprador para su producto."|`|a30f51b962173ae36e254736df1e7b81aa	Antes de la invención de los ordenadores y máquinas de escribir eléctricas, se usaban máquinas mecánicas. Las primeras máquinas tenías las teclas ordenadas alfabéticamente, pero surgió un gran problema. Funcionaban por medio de martillos con el inverso de las letras grabadas en su cabeza, llamadas "tipo". Al golpear un "tipo" un papel a través de una cinta entintada dejeban escrita la letra. El "tipo" era accionado por la presión de una tecla que ponía en movimiento un juego de palancas dentro del aparato. Sin embargo, cuando se escribían dos letras cercanas, los tipios tendían a chocar entre ellos y se entrababan, sobre todo porque en poco tiempo las personas que las utilizaban llegaban a alcanzar bastante velocidad.<br>  <br>  Sholes intentó mejorar el dise?o de la máquina para eliminar este problema. La mejor solución que encontró fue alterar el orden de las teclas para separar los tipos que se usaban juntos con más frecuencia. Para esto estudió la frecuencia de aparición de pares de letras. El orden resultante es el qwerty que todos conocemos. No eliminó por completo el problema de los tipos trabados, pero sí lo redujo considerablemente<br>  <br>  he tardao un poco en ponertelo pero espero habertelo explicado bien|`|f0fa06b83fd2cd02860380dbc597d343aa	No lo se.

Go to the Verizon store -- play around with the phones (assuming you want a new phone) and decide which phone you want.  Then go online and sign up for a new contract at one of the online sites that give you an awesome deal, which often times the carriers are not able to match.  One catch, however, is that if you're a current Verizon customer these online sites can't give you the best deal.  If you run into this situation, you can always have the contract in your spouse's or some other relative's name (if possible).  A couple of sites that give you good deals are:<br>  <br>  www.letstalk.com<br>  www.wirefly.com<br>  <br>  Good luck!!|`|AA11814744	i have noticed with most providers that online there are more special deals. like more off for a phone or a better "promo" for the first some months or something of the sort.|`|d3ae155558b9cbe826b8103176ad795caa	First of all, I would avoid a Verizon dealer.  Those stores may or may not have the current selection.  In my area, I have seen them selling phones that the regular Verizon Wireless store stopped carrying more than a year ago.  Sometimes, these stores also sell refurbished phones.  Plus, here is the kicker, you frequently have to sign multiple contracts with a dealer, instead of just the one you sign with the actual company.  <br>  <br>  The best place to buy the phone is always in the store.  You can take advantage of the experience and knowledge of the staff, plus you get to actually see and feel the phone before you buy it.  It has been my experience that the prices in the store and on line tend to be the same, after the rebate that you have to do in store.  I personally don't mind waiting a couple of weeks to get my check back, but that is just me.  The convenience of actually getting to see the phones and play with the different models is worth a few weeks wait to me.|`|Z5IxPHSgaa	i say through the store because u can work out a better package with the sale person....u know if ur getting a new phone and it has a mail-in rebate see if u can get them to do it in the store u know towards a accessories bundle.or something....but as far as the plans ur stuck with the ones they have no haggling about those|`|KSsgEdlmaa	Go to the store and play with the phones to figure out which one you really like... then look to see if it's cheaper on Verizon's website (it probably will be). Do NOT order from a third-party site like Wirefly, etc. They have great deals but they're dependent on mail-in rebates. You may have to jump through hoops to get those rebates, and if you go to Verizon for help, they're gonna say "you bought from Wirefly, so talk to them about your rebate".

ZEwAalKPaa	As an Art student you very likely have a good eye for a picture and you may well be less than satisfied with the results you achieve with a ￡60 camera bought new.<br>  <br>  I would suggest that you use your money buying either a better quality second user model or take a look at the Canon Shop, where Canon sell refurbished and fully guaranteed cameras of their own make, on open auction, and you can get lucky (I got a Powershot A720is from them for just ￡42 in the wee hours a few weeks back.) or a site called clear r gear which is run by Jessops selling off ex display stock from their stores and end of range remainders etc.|`|5bd05c7fa78a69fcd566818bb048a2bfaa	I'm looking too, the two cameras that have stood out the most to me are the Canon Powershoot SX100 IS <a href="http://www.refurbdepot.com/productdetails2.cfm?Product_ID=6150&&refererid=PriceGrabber&site=pricegrabber.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.refurbdepot.com/productdetail...</a><br>  and the Canon PowerShot A590IS <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Canon-PowerShot-Digital-Optical-Stabilized/dp/B0011ZCDKS/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=photo&qid=1235341176&sr=1-1#moreAboutThisProduct" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Canon-PowerShot-Di...</a><br>  <br>  but whatever you do, don't buy any Nikon Coolpix cameras...the image comes out grainy and blurry. <br>  <br>  Best of luck finding a camera!|`|cc030d61dc9bcfd7d41ed6138df0d0b1aa	All of the major brands are good. Choose a brand that appeals to you. Then you have to think about getting a spare battery, what size memory card, if you want an extended warranty, how much you can afford, what size zoom, if you want manual controls, the size of the camera, finding a reliable place to purchase it, and the list goes on and on and on.......<br>  <br>  The first thing to realize is that almost any digital camera will take good pictures. If more people would read the manual more than once, they would be able to take better pictures. Usually, the person assumes it is the camera when it could be them not knowing exactly what to do. Just give yourself more photographic knowledge by doing more reading on the internet.<br>  <br>  I really believe buying a camera is an individual choice.<br>  The person needs to read alot of reviews on cameras so they can decide on the features that they really want and need.<br>  Go to the store and hold them so you can see if they feel comfortable in your hands.

I think the answer to this question will depend greatly on what you are doing outside your wii fit-- if you're eating a properly balanced diet, you'll be likely to lose weight MUCH faster!  Also, if you increase your water intake, you can lose weight faster.<br>  <br>  In terms of just the wii, i would def. recommend the aerobics games.  I like the "free step" one, because once you get it going, you can watch something else on tv for up to a half hour!  (This is my guilty pleasure, I love doing steps to jeopardy.. and it has paid off for tone in my legs!).<br>  <br>  Keep a good variety, and keep a healthy lifestyle outside the wii, and you will lose it quicker.  And remember, it is MUCH harder for someone who weighs what you do to lose weight than someone who weighs double of what you do.  So don't get discouraged if it takes time.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you!

xwSNEYICaa	Buy paper at Tom Nook's.  Make sure you know all of your neighbors (there should be 10 of them).  Write them a letter and attach a fruit or seashell to it.  About 24 hours later (or on the 2nd mail delivery) you will get a letter back with a gift attached.  Mail is delivered at 9am and 5pm everyday.  Sell these (except fruit - see below) at Tom Nooks.  Once an item is in your pocket, even for a second, it will be available in your catalog at Nooks.  You can send letters twice a day, if you have the time.  It usually takes me less than 5 mins to write all 10 letters, gather fruit, and send them.<br>  <br>  Important: You must write a complete sentence to get a letter with a gift back.  You can not just write "Hi" or "Thanks", it will not work.  I write things like "Thank you for the gift!" or " Thanks for being my friend!"  <br>  <br>   I would suggest using fruit at first, because some of them will send you non-native fruit back.  Non-native fruit is worth 500 bells each vs. 100 bells for native fruit. <br>  <br>   Don't sell the first of the non-native fruit you get.  Use your ax, chop down an existing tree, use your shovel, dig up the stump, then plant the non-native fruit.  In 3-4 days, you will get a non-native fruit tree (with 3 more fruit on them, they replenish every 3 days). Take those and plant them,  Within a week or two, you should have a lot of non-native trees that you can start selling the fruit.  I have so many Apple, Cherry, Peach, and Orange Trees that I can easily make 20,000 selling just the fruit.  My town's native fruit is the Pear.  <br>  <br>  After awhile, you can just plant the fruit wherever.  Trees will not grow on certain spots, so that's why I suggest chopping down a few trees at first, to guarantee that the trees will grow.<br>  <br>  This should get you many items added to your catalog, and an easy way to make money.  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|haLQ4bCnaa	I know of a website that will tell you virtually everything yo need to know about the game.

UAYzLyN4aa	There are many factors here. <br>  <br>  Most important is bone conduction. Your ears are inside your head, as of course are your mouth and nose and sinus cavities, all of which contribute to the sound of your voice. So, much of the sound you hear of your own voice is via bone conduction, not through the air. You don't get this at all from any sort of recording (unless you have a bone conduction microphone! which do exist). <br>  <br>  Very few people think their recorded voice is similar to how they hear themselves, and this bone conduction issue is the main reason. Also because of this, nobody else hears your voice the way you do. <br>  <br>  Next, there is the microphone. Without exception, consumer camcorders have very poor microphones. <br>  <br>  In professional sound recording studios it is common to pay $100 or more for microphones that are simply used for background vocals, and hundreds to thousands (yes, really, thousands) for a main vocal mic. Same for e.g. radio stations. <br>  <br>  And even with that, if you compare a number of high-end microphones, you'll find they all sound very different. There is no one "accurate" mic.  Take a look at <a href="http://www.coutant.org/contents.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.coutant.org/contents.html</a> - on the page for each mic there is a link, "hear the sound of this mic". They all sound different. Some make the announcer sound more "tinny", some give more bass, some more "forward", some more background. <br>  <br>  After we get a great mic we have to use it properly. If you look at video of performers in recording studios you'll probably notice they're pretty close to the mic... six inches at most, sometimes much less. Most microphones, particularly directional mics, have much reduced bass response when you get farther away.  (Those screens you see hanging in front of mics in studios have several purposes, but one is to provide a consistent distance reference for the artist, because distance affects the sound a lot.)  Are you ever six inches away from your camcorder mic? Let alone one inch? Probably not. In fact it would likely overload if you were that close. <br>  <br>  The speakers via which you hear the recorded sounds affect things a LOT, too. If you don't have audiophile-grade speakers you aren't really hearing what the recorded sound sounds like. <br>  <br>  Then there are mic preamps to consider, but that's beyond what most people are going to be able to change for camcorder recordings. And, of course, professional recordings are almost always processed heavily; this alters the tone as well. <br>  <br>  If you want to get an idea of how accurately (or not) your recorder is recording your own voice, check it on someone else's voice! Find a friend whose voice you know well - ideally, someone whose voice is not very dissimilar to yours - and ask them to let you record them reading something, like a paragraph from a book. Then play it back and compare the sound of the playback with how they themselves sounded. <br>  <br>  Your friend will probably balk at this because many people hate the sound of their own recorded voice - you could offer to "trade" by recording yourself, too, and letting them find out how much (or how little) the recording changes *your* voice. <br>  <br>  This at least will give you (and your friend) an accurate idea of how different the sound of your recorded vs. live voice is to other people. You really can't judge from the sound inside your head.|`|76cAAPfBaa	There's nothing scarier than hearing your actual voice!<br>  <br>  That's the way you REALLY sound to others....<br>  <br>  <br>  YOU hear your voice differently, because the bones in your skull conduct the vibrations directly to your ear drum.

kFHwzBG7aa	They're all the same.  HDMI is digital, so you don't have to worry about interference.|`|UinOWcMUaa	Expensive cables aren't worth it<br>  If you walk into your typical electronics store to buy an HDMI cable, you're likely to see prices upward of $50 with promises of better performance and faster speeds. Do you really need to spend that much money on a single HDMI cable? <br>  <br>  <br>  Absolutely not--those cables are a rip-off. You should never pay more than $10 for a standard six-foot HDMI cable. And despite what salesmen and manufacturers might tell you, there's no meaningful difference between the $10 cable and the $50 cable. Unless you see something obvious, such as dropouts or a flashing screen, the digital information transmitted by both cables is exactly the same--no cable can make the picture any better or any worse. We've used cables from many different companies in the past--such as Belkin, Accell, Monoprice, Monster, and SimplayHD--and have not run into any consistent issues with any brand of cable. With working cables and solid connections, we've seen no dropouts and "sparklies"--just consistent, dependable, high-quality audio and video. It's that simple.<br>  <br>  <br>  Save money -- buy simple !|`|A2jyJ89iaa	Just use the one that came with your HD receiver. It works great|`|dC7d5sy5aa	There is a difference between budget and expensive HDMI cables. The difference relates to the build quality and the materials used in construction. The question is whether this difference will mean anything to you in your set up. People are right when they say that digital is digital. You can never improve a digital signal by using an expensive cable. You can however degrade the signal using an inferior cable. You will see this degradation as sparkles on the screen (particularly dark scenes) and pixelation. As the total length between your source and the display device gets bigger the more critical the quality of the cable. Getting back to your question it sounds like you have an HDMI version 1.2 cable. The current version is 1.3. A 1.2 cable is only guaranteed to work up to 1080i (not 1080p which is your TV) However a 1.2 cable might work on a 1080p display over short distances. The only way to tell is to install the cable and see what the picture and sound look like. There are features (which your TV supports) that are currently being released like Dolby TrueHD extended color space and lipsync which you will need to upgrade your cable to 1.3 for. (You will also need to upgrade your source to take advantage of these features.) So the bottom line is if your cable is working now stick with it. When you want to upgrade any part of your system make sure that you buy a cable that is marked 1.3 (don't worry about a,b or C as they only relate to testing guidelines) with the official HDMI logo.|`|af3a28b07826dce8ecfc28a5eaa91e13aa	I dont think it matters much.

Usually amplifiers are rated for a minimum impedance (ohms) and anything higher will just not play as loud for a given volume setting.<br>  <br>  You are safe.|`|ofpmRvHpaa	It will probably damage the speakers.<br>  <br>  Many el-cheepo "home theater" systems are not designed to work with any outboard DVD players, speakers or subwoofers.  The ability to mix/match components is what you gave up with the $299 price tag.<br>  <br>  You will be hooking up normal speakers to a under-powered system and this will destroy the speakers.  (Yes - under-powering the speakers is what really destroys them, not over-powering them.)<br>  <br>  Hooking up "2 ohm" speakers to a normal AV Receiver is very close to a short-circuit and will over-heat the receiver and destroy the electronics.<br>  <br>  So dont do it.|`|akvrwpywaa	Hook up an 8 ohm what?  If you mean a sound source that expects 8-ohm speakers, then you might.  Just keep the volume dial very low (about 1/4 of normal), or else you're liable to blow out your speakers.

They both last as long as each other. In fact if you watch around 8 Hours each day on either type of TV your TV will last for 20 years. They are both liable to screen burns but they are very uncommon. The main difference is that LCD uses Liquid crystals to block out a constant back light where as Plasma uses gases pixels to create light. Plasma normally has better dynamic contrast. This basically means if you had the whitest white on one side of the TV and the blackest black on the other, if the TV had 15,000 contrast ratio it would have 15,000 different shades in each one. It also depends on the size of TV you are after. 42" upwards can be either LCD or plasma but smaller TV tend to be LCD because you wouldn't get a very good picture on a plasma due to the limit of gas and pixels. Good luck with getting a TV|`|W3H4fOdQaa	The black levels on Plasma TV's are generally better.  (on LCD's the black color is slightly more grey)  Another thing you have to consider is the lighting in the room.  Plasma TV's need a glass coating on the screen to hold in the plasma liquid.  Although they strive for anti-glare, this coating is more reflective than most LCD TV's.  Also from what I know, plasma TV's do not have response time issues... this makes them generally better for watching action sports.<br>  <br>  Summary:<br>  <br>  Plasma's superior for:  Black levels, fast moving images<br>  <br>  LCD's superior for:  rooms with windows / lamps behind the viewer, possibly the burn in issue discussed from others|`|7ZP74Y4maa	well my sister has a 56" plasma screen tv and its pretty amazing.  but its really difficult to take care of because leaving the tv with the same picture on the screen can cause it to permanently burn into the screen, so your constantly having to worry about whether or not something is staying on the tv screen for too long or not.  this is really annoying for video games bcuz alot of video games have things that just have to stay on the screen all the time.  Take Halo 3 for instance.  They have the bar that shows your life, the radar, the target reticle, and all the other data thats constantly on the screen. so any time you have to stop playing, say to bring your dog outside, you have to remember to turn the tv off before you go so it doesnt burn any part of the picture into the screen and then turn it back on when you come back. <br>  However, if you dont really play games and you mostly want it just to watch tv shows and movies, then its awesome.  bcuz for movies and shows, theres never really anything that would stay on the screen long enough to burn it and the picture for HD shows is great.  so it just depends on what your using it for.  but plasmas also last for only about half as long as other tvs so keep that in mind too...<br>  <br>  and by the way if you do end up buying a plasma, then try to find one with "Pixel Shift."  this makes the pixels across the tv screen shift into other spots every few minutes and makes it alot harder for something to burn into your screen<br>  <br>  hope this helps|`|EBT0kDQ8aa	Newer display technologies have resulted in better, modern televisions like the plasma television. The older cathode ray tube technology has been left behind in favor of an atomic technology in modern televisions. Our viewing experience has been enhanced by our ability to manipulate and control the behavior of atomic particles. This is the technology that is being used in a plasma television. A plasma is a gas that contains freely flowing ions and electrons. Photons are released and provide illumination when an electric charge is passed through this plasma.<br>  <br>  This illumination is used by the rest of the technology in plasma televisions to create the three primary colors and to display them as images. This modern television also varies the intensity of the illumination to produce color changes in the same way the cathode ray tube televisions use different intensities of particles to produce different colors.<br>  <br>  Most of the drawbacks of the conventional television are negated in the design of the plasma television. Size is no longer a restriction because the bulky cathode ray tube is not being used. The plasma television is also very thin so bulky boxes are not required. These days, most plasma televisions appear more or less like works of art hanging in your living room.|`|ERo2gNxUaa	The number 1 thing that people don't think about when purchasing a tv is where will it be used. If its gonna be in a dark room or where there is no glare then plasma, otherwise LCD is your best bet. Plasma is crisper than LCD. LCD tvs are more available with more companys making them and in more sizes. If you are going to be using them for viedo games, then get LCD because of the burn in issue with plasma tvs. But with normal viewing you wont have any burn in issues. If you plan on going really big, dont rule out DLP. That a high quality image but it entails a high price. Hope this helps.

I was reading all over the place about DSLR's for beginners. There's some main things you ought to know : What kind of photography you like best, and your price range. <br>  <br>  So you decided you want a nikon slr? Alright, well, they tend to have really good ergonomics (the feel in your hand). One thing i REALLY recommend before buying: is to go to a nearby electronics store and get a feel for how the camera fits in your hand. This may change your decision about nikon. <br>  <br>  Well, there is pretty much only one camera for a 1st level beginner from nikon. The Nikon D40. Not only is it very cheap, tonnes of reviews have given it the thumbs up. Although it is 6MP, the image quality is still amazing. Megapixels only matter if you're planning on printing large pictures. However, 6MP is great up until 8.5x11 prints. The camera, with a lens, is usually around 500$ which is mega cheap these days.<br>  <br>  IF however, you find you do not like the way nikon feels, some other recommendations i would make would include...<br>  Sony a300 (10MP, Live view, really cheap as well, i got mine for 430.)<br>  Canon XS (10MP, around 600)<br>  <br>  I hope you find whichever matches you most. Also, a REALLY great website to learn the basics about slr photography is <a href="http://www.digital-slr-guide.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.digital-slr-guide.com</a> . I highly recommend this site, as it contains info on prices, best slr's for beginners, and A LOT of really useful info.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|qR4xcTfaaa	You should seriously look in to the Nikon D80, its a 10.2 Mp CCD sensor and the price of it dropped by 30%. Because of its CCD sensor and since the D90 sensor is the same physical size as the D80 a CCD system would give much better pictures even in difficult situations (high ISO, shadow etc.).<br>  If you are looking for a CMOS sensor, I recommend not to go with Nikon just yet , the Canon 20D 30D 40D 50D Rebel XSi have a bigger sensor that reduce noise at higher ISO, it is also USER Friendly and less expensive.<br>  Check out these picture with Canon 20D By this very talented lady.<br>  <a href="http://members.fotki.com/Kkaplin/about/" rel="nofollow">http://members.fotki.com/Kkaplin/about/</a><br>  <br>  I recommend for you to start with a mid level lens, the lenses that come with the camera are low end;<br>  You must always remember - The LENS is the most important part of the picture so you should invest in mid to high end lenses.<br>  Starting with 24-85mm F2.8/4.0 is a very good serious amateur lens for wide angle, as for Tele Zoom I recommend the 80-200mm F2.8 ED even if you get it used from a good owner (new is almost $1000). with these 2 lenses you can not go wrong, the first lens also have a 1:2 Micro capability and since the D80 is a DX camera it will be 1:1.5.<br>  The range will be 35-117mm and 117-290mm since they are FX lenses (which also gives you the opportunity in the futur to upgrade to an FX camera and then 24mm will be 24mm etc) the GLASS in these lenses are the best of NIKON NIKKOR.<br>  The lenses quality of Canon is as high as Nikon's and some pros think they are even better. But as a beginner you can't go wrong with Nikon D80 CCD sensor.
w4I9oj2Maa	Wow...all those problems, and a 19 incher to boot.<br>  <br>  I don't think I'd put a penny into it...because then you just threw your money away, and I don't think you like doing that.<br>  <br>  I think I would reinvest my money into a good name brand combo like Samsung, Sony, Hitachi or LG.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?id=pcat17080&type=page&qp=cabcat0101000%23%230%23%236e~~q70726f63657373696e6774696d653a3e313930302d30312d3031~~ncabcat0101005%23%230%23%23h&list=y&nrp=15&usc=abcat0100000&sc=TVVideoSP" rel="nofollow">http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?...</a><br>  <br>  But avoid the NEW BRANDS !  Polaroid, Dynex, Insignia are cheap because they do not provide parts or service...OR they charge an exorbitant fee to fix it. THAT stops people from getting it serviced.

805d5aa14fdca671ed6b65dfbb2b1962aa	Component is definately better, its fully shielded, high bandwidth, and has controlled impedance. S-video is more convenient, composite is cheapest, and component is best quality.|`|dC7d5sy5aa	Here is a list of resolutions that various cables support.<br>  <br>  HDMI 1.3 (1080p, 1080i, 720p, 480p, 480i)<br>  HDMI 1.2 (1080i, 720p, 480p, 480i)<br>  Component (1080i, 720p, 480p, 480i)<br>  S-Video (480i)<br>  Composite (480i)<br>  Coaxial (480i)<br>  <br>  As you can see from the above component is better than S-video in terms of resolution.<br>  It looks like HDMI is the emerging standard for home entertainment connections.

1sTBCFoAaa	In terms of cords there are a few the boxes can use. If you are still using a composite cables then the colours should correspond accordingling WHITE-WHITE (Left/Right Audio), RED-RED (Left/Right Audio) and YELLOW-YELLOW (Video). There is also and RGB cable that some things use, mainly LCD TVs, This consists of Red, Green and Blue cables but these are mainly the LCD Tvs, But if you have got the red white and yellow cables then just match up the colours, If it doesnt work then reset the box or if it a Sky or Virgin media box then ring them and they will sort it out for you.
9Y20HrKlaa	Yes, it is all about the inputs. If you bu an LCD TV you are set. They will have all the right inputs. Your laptop most likely has ( unless it is a 3000 or 4000 $ laptop) has a VGA out on and a the TV would have a RGB (VGA) same wire. So that would be your Computer, as for your Xbox they use composite or HDMI and all 32'' LCD TV's have that. So yes you could because the has or then on port on them. You would just switch between inputs. You should get a god brand like LG or Samsung or Toshiba.|`|8r8eE0Q4aa	If it can accept 25 pin VGA input or S-Video input from laptop, you may. Make sure you select correct source.|`|OblSdMaaaa	Yes you can. Just make sure your TVMonitor has the proper inputs on it. <br>  <br>  I suggest buying an LCD TV, and ising it as a monitor, that way you don't have to run your cable via your computer.|`|1sTBCFoAaa	You can do. Some TVs, I know Samsung do but not too sure about others, have a thing called PIP. This stands for Picture In Pitcure. Our samsung has it. Basically if your using it as a monitor then you can go into the menu and select PIP. You can also choose whether the audio comes from the TV (Cable, Freeview etc) or the PC. BUT in order to get audio to come through the TV you need to have a 3.5mm socket next to (or labelled) PC audio. then you need a 3.5mm to 3.5mm cable to go from the headphone socket on your pc to the TV.
QouCpCv2aa	Of course, all Call of Duty games for Pc are able to play online|`|lYX3WOMoaa	Yep!
LzSj90pbaa	This is how you make the iphone prepaid.<br>  you sign up for a contract. since they have bad credit, you must leave a deposit. so $199 for the 8gb. + $400 for a deposit. You then cancel your contract. +$175. You then have to pay your first months bill +$69.98 + tax.<br>  you then buy a prepaid sim-$9.99 + tax.<br>  So $853 and some change is what it will cost.<br>  For that, you could get a nokia n96 and have twice the features of the iphone and money left over to pay 3 months worth of bills.|`|6OzEsanAaa	uh no such thing. lol <br>  <br>  because if you get the iphone prepaid you minus well get a cheaper phone because the iphone will just be ipod touch with a prepaid cell phone..they only sell that phone with a contract|`|YFBjsVIHaa	lol. um at&t doesnt have a prepaid i phone. if u want a prepaid i-phone, u need to buy an unlocked i-phone which would be really expensive.

Uc2mucm6aa	$400 would be a steal. The problem is that most people wont want the accessories. They may appeal to you but the large verety of games may not appeal everyone. Mabe the buyer doesnt like raceing games. I suggest selling the PS2 with popular games and the rest of the accessories sold sepperately. Give the option to the customer to attract more customers! Ebay, Amazon, and craigslist are great! Make sure you stay away from African emails off Ebay and Amazon.

AtnB994eaa	its no big deal<br>  but next time turn it off from the power button|`|lQGDV7MEaa	It was probably nothing. When a game freezes, and the only way to turn it off is the master switch in the back, the probability of it harming the system is significantly lower. <br>  It's only harmful if the hard disk is writing or reading data, in which case corruption could occur.<br>  <br>  I'm sure you've nothing to worry about. <br>  :]|`|aROiy2Gnaa	it might be a little hard on ur ps3 especially the hard drive but ps3's r made to be able to go through stuff like that|`|EfejPjIMaa	Using the switch on the back is a hard reset, like unplugging your computer without shutting it down first.  Not good for the system.  You should always reset your PS3 doing a soft reset, which is holding the power button on the front for 3 seconds.  <br>  <br>  Doing a soft reset is always much better than doing a hard reset.  You should never have to do a hard reset.  While once or twice will probably do no harm, repeatedly doing hard resets can cause major problems with your PS3.|`|59Rd381caa	Yeah something like that's been happening to me too because whenever I send someone a message while playing a game it freezes and I've had to turn it off with the power sensor near the disc injector. I would try turning that if I were you because it sounds like you didn't try that.<br>  <br>  Hopefully they'll come out with a patch or something...|`|785440e73a90380b1cea867ceab71780aa	Happens to me all the time. Instead of using the switch, press the power button (in front of disc thing) for 3 seconds. <br>  <br>  If may happen every now and then. It's fine.|`|wzBw06H3aa	Mine did the same thing during online game play.  After i restarted I got the error that my blue ray lens could not read disks so I had to send it in and get it fixed.  If it where to happen again try the controller first. If that wont allow you to shut it down then press and hold the power button on the front to see if you can re-start it.  The last thing you should try if all else fails is to flip the switch on the back.   Think of your ps3 as your home computer, if it freezes up you always wanna try alternate ways of restarting before you just flip the switch.  If you do this once or twice you should be alright but doing it repeatedly can be harmful.|`|Be6oUPd5aa	You technically hard booted your playstation which can be really bad for your hard drive. I would have tried holding down the power button on the system for a couple seconds first, this will be a much safer system shutdown. but sometimes you ust gotta do what you gotta do! =P|`|YI8V5e36aa	Next time it freezes DO NOT turn it off from the back... it can damage the ps3.... the best thing to do is hold the power button on the front until you hear a beep... or until it shuts down... <br>  <br>  Now how long were you playing?  Remember to always take breaks to prevent freezing...|`|1aqrRzqLaa	That is fine to turn it off that way. Whenever my PS3 freezes up and is pretty serious I never wait and just immediately turn it off using the power switch on the back.|`|k6CSa9caaa	I get this sometimes as well and find no harm in powering down via the back switch. Nothing happens if I try switching off with ps button when it crashes.|`|sQdgzYKVaa	No, you can turn it off from the back, I mean there wouldn't be a switch if you couldn't. Plus its a lot better than unplugging it.|`|RMGzjECmaa	its a glitch.<br>  <br>  happens to me when playin undercover. <br>  <br>  they are finding a patch to patch the glitch up.|`|AuQBlXdhaa	your ps3 will be fine, mine did same thing, but its good now|`|fVJbVkJbaa	If you hold the power button for 5 seconds... the system will reset. However, if that doesn't work either, the only option you have is to do a hard shutdown... which isn't exactly good for the hard drive, but once in a while, it isn't all that bad.
BxkBXsocaa	try resetting your player first, look up your operating manual to find out, u may have to press a combination of buttons to do that or there's a reset pin-hole that u can stick a paperclip to fix it... good luck!

66TmAKViaa	no, sadly, you can't. years ago you could. like, we have a local service called hargray, and you could go buy another phone company's phone, and they would activate it for you on the low. lol. BUT... these slick companies have since but "chips" in their phones, that may only be activated by their service. so be VERY careful as to which service/phone you buy... most cell companies have OUTRAGEOUS rates/plans. sprint has the most reasonable plans, and virgin mobile has a GREAT prepaid plan. so be sure you ask what company it's with before you waste your dough.|`|rt7hGNE2aa	now a days the answer is no. there used to be so many service providers and now there are like 4 and there are so many phones these days. u have to get a phone made by ur service provider, i work in phones so trust me and ebay isnt the best way to go either

VMVW3E7Aaa	Two possible solutions:<br>  <br>  1) with web cams it is very important to follow the correct order. Usually they tell you to install the software and drivers first (plus you may need to look for an updated version online - make sure to pick the right one for your operating system), THEN you plug in your camera. It won't work the other way around.<br>  <br>  2) if that makes the webcam work but not the mic, you need to go to your system's sound card mixer and specify your web cam's mic as the "recording" source.|`|lebSL2yaaa	The disk probably uploads the drivers needed to operate the mic.

The navigation on it is smooth, and very pretty. I got the CU500 because of the data capability. It is a 3G phone which means it can get up to 1Mb connection in certain areas. It's great for streaming videos, browsing online, and checking mail. Both phones have very good media players, though the W810i has pro Duo memory card, opposed to LG's micro SD memory card. Both are capable of the same amount of memory, though on the W810i's memory card is easier to load as you don't have to remove the battery.

TwIK4Ivlaa	It's better to store optical equipment like lenses, cameras in a desiccator. <br>  <br>  The best you can do at home is to buy a air-tight container big enough to keep your camera and keep some dry silica gel crystals on one side. It's better to buy 'self-indicating' silica gel crystals which are usually deep blue in colour when dry and loose this color when they have adsorbed moisture.<br>  <br>  These can even be heated few times to dry them again and re-used on cooling.<br>  <br>  The silica gel pouches which are commonly found with optical equipment and even in some containers are actually a big joke and most of them are already hydrated to the extent that they can't dry a film roll container.<br>  <br>  The best way to check a home made desiccator or a dry box is to see the colour of silica gel after 24 hours of packing everything in (including dry deep blue silica gel crystals). If the colour is slight blue but not totally white, then it's perfect. <br>  Another method to do so is to open the box and put your hand inside. If you feel it cooler inside then it's working. It feels cooler due to dryness inside. <br>  <br>  These are methods to store equipment for a long time. If you use your equipment regularly, there are very less chances of fungus/mold.|`|PrfajH0aaa	As a general rule. Keep your electronic equipment in dry and not damp spaces. A camera bag with packets of silica gel will suffice. Fungus accumulation is unlikely.

VMVW3E7Aaa	People so often ask: "Which one is a good camera to buy?"<br>  Here is my 10 cents on the subject:<br>  <br>  Point & Shoot cameras are wonderfully handy because of their small size.<br>  When light conditions are ideal, they even take really nice photos - all of them do.<br>  <br>  However, they all DO have limitations - they don't do very well in low light situations  (i.e. noisy photos, hard to avoid blur, etc). The little onboard flash is very harsh at close range, and doesn't reach very far.<br>  Many of them have no manual functions, so you are limited to only very basic photos, you can't compensate for unusual situations, or do many fun "tricks" and special effects.<br>  P&S's  also suffer from  frustrating shutterlag and many of them chew through batteries rather quickly.<br>  <br>  However, if you're ok with all those limitations, then go ahead and pick one, most of them (the same type and same price range) are rather similar. Personally I would pick either a Canon or a Nikon, and would certainly stay away from Kodak. <br>  <br>  A higher end P&S will give you more manual options and better quality.  Many of those even give you the option of adding a proper flash (which makes a big difference to your flash photos).<br>  <br>  Don't worry too much about megapixels…. there is a limit to how many pixels you can squash into a tiny P&S sensor before you actually LOSE quality rather than gain it.<br>  Don't worry about digital zoom, in fact, don't EVER use it. It simply crops away pixels, i.e. destroys information. The only real zoom is optical.<br>  <br>  Decide which features are important to you, and look for cameras that have that feature. <br>  Then go compare a few models on www.dpreview.com  .  <br>  <br>  The very best thing you can do for your success is to borrow some books and learn about  photography.  A bit of knowledge will make a much bigger difference to your photos than your choice of P&S camera can.<br>  <br>  For what it's worth - if I was in the market for a P&S camera right now, my choice would be a Canon Powershot  SX10 IS <a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=ModelInfoAct&fcategoryid=144&modelid=17630" rel="nofollow">http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/contro...</a>|`|AbRfd29Haa	I've never been a big fan of Fujifilm. The only cool thing they've done lately is build a high dynamic range sensor, but they don't use that in lower-end cameras, which is a shame. They've also been one of only two companies pushing xD cards, while everything else on the planet, other than Sony, is SD/SDHC... that may or may not matter to you. Their stabilization system works well (you want that in any long-zoom camera), but most reviewers were a little disappointed with the image quality (a bit soft, and noisier than average in low light). <br>  <br>  Is that a good deal for $250? Fairly good, I rekon. Assuming you're serious about the format (an EVF long-zoom camera that looks like a Baby SLR), I would also take a good look at the Nikon Coolpix L100 (not yet out, but similar price and features), the Nikon Coolpix P-series, and the Canon Powershot SX10 (a bit more expensive). Another to consider is the Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ28, also a similar type and bit more expensive.  I think the Fujifilm model is an ok camera... I think the Nikon, Panny, and Canon are a bit better. But not necessarily better-for-you... you need to add in what you want in the camera. Does one fit "you" better? Do you like AAs better than rechargeable Li-ions (I have five different cameras with five different rechargeable Li-ions, between digital and video... it gets a bit crowded around the charging station, and we're not even into phones and PDAs yet).<br>  <br>  If you can relax a little on the megapixels, you might find a much better deal in a slightly older model. Going to 8Mpixel or even 6Mpixel is highly unlikely to change your results. You might get a little more light sensitivity (fewer pixels on the same sized sensor can mean more light per pixel, but it also depends on how good the microlenses are on that sensor). <br>  <br>  Hey Shorty... you need to check your math... 0.3Mpixel (VGA) is not enough for a 4x6 print. Trust me.. back in the stone age of digital photography, I had a Canon PowerShot 350, which did a super job at 640x480. But you're still talking about pixels 1/10" x 1/10" on a 4x6  print... hardly microscopic. <br>  <br>  The minimal you want for any print is a match to a printer's resolution. Most printers are a minimum of 240dpi to 300dpi in real terms (they might say 2400dpi or something, but that's for individual droplets of ink, not fully formed dithered colors). So for a 4x6 print, you ought to have at least 2Mpixels. It works... I also owned a Canon Pro90IS, which was fine at 4x6, a bit wanting at 5x7. <br>  <br>  And I mean "minimum" here -- even that's insufficient for anyone but the most rank amature, for the simple reason that if you're even slightly serious about photography, the shot you take is the starting point, not the ending point. You may crop the photo, use in projects with other photos, etc. At today's sensor and memory prices, you aren't wasting money on more pixels. <br>  <br>  With that said, a good, large 6Mpixel sensor (like my Nikon D70's) will be better for most purposes than a overly tiny 10Mpixel sensor. Shorty is somewhat right about this... the pixels don't define sharpness... not entirely, anyway. But they are a necessary precondition. You need enough pixels, a sharp enough lens, good focus, no shake, etc. They're all interdependent... Leica's historically best lens used with a full 35m-sized 0.3Mpixel sensor is probably not visually better than that old Canon Powershot 350... there are simply not enough pixels to tell the difference.|`|xG5ZlJDqaa	Why 10 megapixels? If you don't need prints larger than 4 x 6", a VGA camera should do just fine (0.3 megapixel). Resolution is not based on megapixels, it's more on the lens, jpeg processing, noise performance, etc. Blurry pictures is caused by bad technique, and any professional can tell you that camera shake and subject motion is more likely to blur the image than a microscopic pixel. If you don't mind it being used, this is pratically a steal for a camera that sold $500 when it was introduced. <a href="http://www.adorama.com/US%20%20%20%20330058.html?searchinfo=canon%20G7&item_no=2" rel="nofollow">http://www.adorama.com/US%20%20%20%20330...</a>|`|i5OVORXgaa	Not a big fam of Fuji... they make good film, not cameras. I suggest you get the Canon Powershot S5.<br>  <br>  The difference between a DSLR and an Advanced Point and Shoot is that you can change the lenses on a DSLR, but you can not on an Advanced Point and Shoot.

XcF4L6KMaa	I would really sit down with the rep at the store, and find out exactly. Here is my experience with carriers and blackberry or smartphone types. They will make you purchase the data package seperately for each phone, to have unlimited data / internet on each phone. Also tethering the phone to a computer is another 30 a month for each line. Even if you have unlimited data on the phone, and by tethering, you still dont get unlimited internet via computer, they give you like 5mb a month only. And yes, you can load as many songs on your blackberry as your memory card (sold seperately) will hold.But ask the rep these questions, because they dont always explain thses things very well, and it can lead to huge cell bills.

AA10936992	ive been looking at the nokia e63 lately and man does it seem like a nice device for real.

AA12091477	I loved the first one and I think that the 2nd one is going to be even better. The only thing I can think of that they could do to make any kind of improvement is make it so the enemies don't have to take so many bullets to go down. Really that's it.<br>  <br>  I don't think having an open world enviroment would be such a good idea in a game like this. I just don't see something like that working.<br>  <br>  I agree with you that Uncharted is definatley one of the best games I have played in my life. For me it ranks up there with God Of War and Grand Theft Auto IV|`|pl2SocVKaa	i think it will improve in the weaker aspects of the first and there wasn't really too many but shooting can be improved yeah open world a little i had a tough time finding those treasures so they should make less of them but i think it will be better than any other adventure game out for a long time|`|1HtTxOOQaa	Uncharted 2 is gonna be great. The first one was one of the best game on the PS3. Uncharted 2 unlike Uncharted 1 will take place in different regions, so you won't see green environment everywhere. From the rumors heard so far, Uncharted 2 takes place in the Himalayan region so expect some snowy terrain. Also, the combat system will be more evolved than the first one. You can now  flip or lift furniture and can make use of them as cover. You can also scale walls with more freedom. <br>  <br>  Another notable feature of the game are the graphics. The game will post better graphics than any console game out yet (yes even better than Killzone 2). The new engine created by naughty dog seems to be really powerful. I can't wait for this game. I just hope Sony backs this game like it has done for Killzone 2. By the looks of it, this game is coming out later during this year and Sony has just announced that God Of War 3 might come out later this year as well. I can tell you one thing, no matter how much good looking UC2 might be, it can't go one on one against GOW3. We can just hope Sony spaces out the titles well so no one game will hog another games success.<br>  <br>  Also, check out the link for UC2 preview posted just a few hours back. Read it, it's awesome.|`|AuQBlXdhaa	i belileve it will be better than Drakes Fortune, but it will blow many games out of the water if it gets an online play type<br>  graphics will be solid and the campaign length will be a little longer than the first<br>  im gonna pick this one up when it comes out|`|1aqrRzqLaa	I think that it's going to be simply amazing! The first one was really good and Naughty Dog is promising that the sequel will only be better.|`|xwEPYEqSaa	Drake's Fortune us hands down the best PS3 game (yes better than LBP and MGS4) I hope they keep it the same, I don't like open world games, they take to long to beat.|`|cCC7KTrKaa	To start I would like to say without disrespecting anyone. . .Metal Gear Solid 4 is not only the best PS3 gameso far, it is one of the greatest games ever made.  It perfectly ties together a plot line that has been evolving for 20 years dating all the way back to Nintendo NES.  MGS4 is a masterpiece for reasons beyond amazing graphics and gameplay.  It is the culmination of one of the greatest stories in video game history.<br>  <br>  Having said my piece, Uncharted Drake's Fortune is a fantastic game.  It is definitely in my top 5 games this gen.  It was an early example of how amazing PS3 exclusives look.  The game is stunning to look at.  I also love the characters in the game and the great story.  Uncharted is what Tomb Raider wishes it could be.  The magic of Tomb Raider has been lost for some time but I feel like Drake's Fortune got everything right.<br>  <br>  I think Uncharted 2 will be excellent.  I just hope they don't make things too over the top.  I kind of felt that R2 wasn't quite as great as Resistance 1 because they "tried to hard".  I love this franchise and can't wait to see what trouble Nate will get into next.

jLTDqVHsaa	Wow, what happened to the old days of looking out the window?<br>  <br>  Anyway, this is just not a job that's conducive to a do-it-yourself setup.  You'd have to mount it securely (and put it somewhere that it fits, because 19" is gigantic for that small a space).  On top of that, you'd have to figure out the power connections and get them exactly right, making sure they're safely mounted with NO hazards.  Then, you'd have to consider what you're hooking up to this thing.  After all, what good is a TV without anything hooked up to it for viewing?<br>  <br>  This seems like a big job, highly impractical, and very expensive.<br>  <br>  This is why in-car screens, like DVD players, are much smaller than 19 inches.  19" is good for a small room, but is utter overkill for a van.  At that distance, everything is magnified and would look grainy.<br>  <br>  Professional installation is HIGHLY advised here if you want to try this.  The other option would be to leave the TV-viewing for home and just let the kids enjoy the view out the window, listen to music, read a book, or participate in other similarly enjoyable activities when it's time for family road trips.|`|usIma0vIaa	<a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search;_ylt=A0geu6KmgaJJm_UAxHRXNyoA?p=mount+a+19+inch+LCD+tv+in+car&y=Search&fr=yfp-t-501">http://search.yahoo.com/search;_ylt=A0ge...</a>
ggR5FFDjaa	To be honest no camera will work well for what you have asked.  No slim compact has a fast enough long lens for indoor sports.  You really need to get an entry level DSLR like the Canon Digital Rebel.  They are much more light sensitive than any compact.  You can find a used one pretty cheap, $3-400, plus lens.  <br>  <br>  A great pocket camera for a club would be the new Panasonic LX3, great wide fast lens.  I have one and really like it.
nhYABprkaa	try putting the camera in VTR or VCR mode (play video) then foward the tape a little like a few seconds.  Then try to record again, and play it back.<br>  <br>  For some reason, some cameras hide the beginning of a video, I have seen that many times.

There is a "home remedy" type thing called the towel trick. You turn off the 360. Then take a couple of towels and wrap them around it. Then wait a little bit,turn it back on,and PRAY LIKE THERE'S NO TOMORROW,then it might work. But there is the risk of the towels catching on fire,so you're better off sending it out then risk having a house in ashes.

7ajz1w2Raa	Blu-Ray is the standard for High Definition movies at home.  Basically it is like DVD, but only with a HD picture. The Blu-Ray players can play DVDs, but DVD players cannot play Blu-Ray discs.<br>  <br>  Unless you have a HDTV it is a waste of money to get Blu-Ray.  The players are expensive and new movies are 20-30 dollars.|`|0wTOMifKaa	It's DVD but with a higher capacity and it uses a "blue" laser to read it so it's 25Gig per layer per disk so a dual layer could hold upto 50Gb, and some companies are busy trying to crack it so you can put a lot of layers onto a disk.<br>  <br>  So because the disks hold more data, the movies are being put onto them in "High Definition" so better quality.<br>  <br>  They also usually have a lot higher resolution sound track instead of Dolby Digital which is upto 640kb/s but usually a lot lower you get sound tracks of around 2.5/3Mb/s so the sound is better.<br>  <br>  Basically you need a HD tv to gain any benefit at all from watching a bluray.  <br>  <br>  So you need a new player, new discs, and probably a new TV good for the makes of all of these :)  <br>  <br>  Also the newest bluray players are capable of updating over the internet usually, with firmware updates etc... so you can have picture in picture on the one disc with commentaires with the pictures of the actors or directors etc... in a small window whilst watching the movie and you can fade in or out the level of the commentary.<br>  <br>  So Nice but costs money and it means buying your DVD collectoin again on bluray disks.

I like how big the screen is and I like the touch pad. It's kind of like the touch pad on a laptop, where you can go up and down, or left and right, or try to do little circles.<br>  <br>  I like the wireless feature because I can either sync wirelessly with my laptop, play a game with someone else (provided they also have a zune), or send someone a song. <br>  <br>  I'm not familiar with what kind of games are on iPod but I like the ones on my zune (soduku, checkers, space battle, hexic, and Texas hold 'em). <br>  <br>  I also like being able to change the background. I know it's pretty silly compared to everything else, but it's nice to be able to do that.<br>  <br>  I enjoy the way the menu is set up. I'll admit it took me a minute to figure out all the intricacies but now that I know what I'm doing I really like it a lot.<br>  <br>  I think "better" depends on what exactly *you* want and the sort of things you're in to. If you're big on accessories then you may not like the zune (at least if the stores by you don't carry anything for zune). I think each brand has something different to it that the other can't do (like wireless with the zune (until you throw in an iPod Touch anyways) and iTouch with all of its features and shaking the player to shuffle songs on iPod Nano).|`|MJ5juxzpaa	nope zunes suck, ipods are better.

Pay for online gaming $50 a year<br>  3. Have to buy many add ons<br>  4. Buy a recharger for controllers.<br>  5. Cost more for HardDrive [60GB $100]<br>  6. Buy Wifi [$100]<br>  <br>  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>  <br>  If you buy the $199 Xbox 360, you will HAVE to buy the Hard drive which costs $100 which will be equal to the $299 one. If you want to play online also, you have to buy a Wifi Adapter for $100. After that, you have to buy a recharger for your controller which costs about $30-40 for only 1 controller.<br>  <br>  Xbox 360 also had this thing called "RROD" which will break your Xbox 360 and you have to send it to Microsoft for them to fix it. It takes about 3-4 weeks for them to fix it. The RROD happens in about 33% of all 360's and it happens from overheating, which means playing it too long. The PS3 only had 0.2% chance of breaking.<br>  <br>  <br>  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>  <br>  Exclusives that Xbox 360 lost to PS3:<br>  <br>  1) Lost Planet<br>  2) Bioshock<br>  3) Saint's Row 2<br>  4) Condemned 2<br>  5) Vampire Rain<br>  6) Haze<br>  7) FEAR<br>  8) Oblivion<br>  9) Two Worlds<br>  10) Sacred 2<br>  11) Overlord<br>  12) ArmA 2<br>  13) Blazing Angels: Squadrons of WWII<br>  14) Enchanted ARMS<br>  15) Eternal Sonata<br>  16) Enemy Territory: Quake War<br>  17) TimeShift<br>  18) Kingdom Under Fire 2<br>  19) Doom 4<br>  20) Omikron 2<br>  21) Postal 3<br>  22) Unreal Tournament<br>  23) Ninja Gaiden<br>  24) Dead Rising<br>  25) Left 4 Dead<br>  26) Mass Effect 1 & 2|`|YBb5EPFWaa	well,I don't really know that much about the ps3 and the Xbox 360 is mostly just sports games...WII ROCKS!!!|`|aNlojl9Baa	360 definitely...<br>  It's right in the middle between the wii and PS3 in terms of graphics<br>  It's also less than the PS3 but more than the Wii.<br>  Most of the games that come out for PS3 also come out on 360<br>  The 360 also has a superb gaming online community...<br>  I would definitely recommend it.|`|B0BNboXEaa	ps3 bro, believe me.  i no its costs a few more dollars than the 360 but like they say "you get what you pay for"<br>  <br>  btw u posted this in the playstation catagorie so chances are ull get more playtation answers x_x

2BgZMwOWaa	dont have the game but something you may want to check cause this happened when i bought cod game of the year addition. go to the playstation store and select view downloads. thats where my map pack was so you may try looking in there. The video game add-on is in the downloadable content. So i can say about 90% sure the game pack is in your downloads and just needs to be downloaded
CSuP72lOaa	Obviously the PS3 is having lots of trouble keeping up with the other consoles. Lack of solid games specifically for PS3 is a big blow to their sales numbers. Why pay so much for a PS3 when you can basically play all the same games on the 360 for less? Also the great service that is Xbox Live is a huge plus for the 360. However, this being said I dont think the PS3 will go away anytime soon..I do think however, if things don't change..Sony will have a big problem to try and solve...they need to lower the price...and get better titles that will draw people back to the PS3..even the die hard fan boys don't want a system with a limited number of games to play.|`|N9nJWYa5aa	It's unlikly as I believe Sony are already at the development and licensing stage for the PS4, due in or after 2012.|`|9AR6B4ELaa	yes, because the wii and 360 is smashing the ps3 lower and lower. eventhough the ps3 is more adanced, but its too expensive. sony created consoles which gets worse. the ps2 is better. so, i think next the xbox 360 will rule|`|fCl7qwD2aa	i think you talk a load of rubbish and don't know anything about gaming/playstation.<br>  Please, if your going to argue about which console is better, PS3 or 360, have a good reason, not just "oh ps3 to expensive has no games, online sucks" becasue well thats so old now and if you say that you havn't got 1 and know nothing about gaming or the playstation brand. <br>  PS beats xbox in everyway possible now. xbox just lack in the technology and reliable side of things.|`|1scZiKXEaa	The answer is an unequivocal yes, as with the next generation, the PS3 will be a generation behind. <br>  <br>  Did you mean to ask about Sony? There will almost definitely be a PS4, or something along those lines, because if the game division at Sony goes under, Sony won't last much longer.<br>  <br>  :)<br>  <br>  plesase vote for top anser|`|AA11229570	Not really, the ps3 is expected to have a $100 price cut on most of its models in April; which will most definitely boost sales.|`|BqPr9jDUaa	I have a ps3 so I hope not. I dont think PS3's online sucks... It does have a lack of games but I find it less glitcthy then the xbox.|`|ZNjmoGS8aa	I believe that the 360 is the best console out on the market today.  Even the Wii doesn't stand up to the hype it got when they first arrived on the scene. <br>  <br>  I think that if Sony goes back to the basics, it will remain competitive.|`|EpvHhbByaa	No, the PS3 is selling enough for the company to hold it's own. Exclusives is what drives the PS3. And the PS3 has A LOT of exclusives.<br>  Blue-ray also helps a little. Not much though.|`|YiUQacWRaa	I bought the ps3 i hate it 600 bucks down the toilet i hate the system i wish it drops out.|`|IaMhYoVoaa	defo|`|wuZuJhupaa	noooo!|`|Y4ATEWCdaa	yeah. no one even talks about the ps3 anymore.|`|UIXVz0LBaa	AGREE with you|`|nb9Ky2Draa	this isnt so open minded. look at killzone coming out for graphics. its processing power is much higher. thats numbers not opinion. blu-ray is the top hd disc, and microsoft bought the add on, it wasnt they didnt want to. the reason multi platform games dont look better is because they get ported from xbox to ps3, because xbox is way easier to code for because its a simpler code. but games made for ps3 do look extremely good. little big planet, metal gear solid 4, killzone all look fantastic. alot falls on the developers to not rush games for profit and cut corners as they have lately (cough ea cough). lately arguing about which system is better is like fighting about religion. but to answer your question, i feel if the time is taken to properly make the games, the ps3 still has alot of shelf life. no game has been made yet that runs the playstation at 100% usage, so i feel there is still a long road ahead of growth in games to take the system to its fullest potential.|`|csAEMObcaa	The answer is an unequivocal yes, as with the next generation, the PS3 will be a generation behind. <br>  <br>  Did you mean to ask about Sony?  There will almost definitely be a PS4, or something along those lines, because if the game division at Sony goes under, Sony won't last much longer.|`|xrA4DxRLaa	Of course it will, all the others did. The ps3 is really advanced, but people want more and more than just advanced anymore. I think it will in like a year or two.|`|856fbcd3e0d7654d5e752a929e8318e4aa	Don't you mean: "Do you think the PS will drop out of the console race next generation?"?|`|QsLJPJOMaa	No.<br>  <br>  Firstly, the PS3 is worth the extra money. It's the perfect entertainment system with Blu-Ray, Internet Browser and the ability to turn it into a Linux PC.<br>  <br>  Secondly, the PS3 is capable of more than the 360, in all areas. It falls down in the graphical quality as most of the games are manufactured on the 360, due to the fact that it is so much easier! But, if you look at PS3 exclusive games, such as Killzone 2, the visuals produced by the PS3 are superior.<br>  <br>  Thirdly, the reason why GTA IV and other games get exclusive DLC is because of Microsoft having the spending power to receive such privileges. I'm sure if Sony could compete with Microsoft in the finance area, the PS3 would receive the same content.<br>  <br>  I own all three of the consoles in question, and I can honestly say that the PS3 is the best. As a games console, yes the 360 is better; it has great online and lots of games. However, it also does break far too easily, and in the long run it is more costly with all the hardware that is readily available on the PS3 costing high prices to buy separately. The PS3 costs ￡80 more than the Elite 360 which, considering what comes in a PS3, is reasonable! And as aforementioned, the PS3 will suit people who wish to do more with their console, other than just play games.

x43Pj22Aaa	Yes.<br>  <br>  For VHS tapes and other analog video you first need to convert the video to digital.  A video transfer service is the easiest option for doing this.  StashSpace.Com is a good one: <a href="http://www.stashspace.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.stashspace.com</a> and will convert your tapes for $7 each.  You can get the files back on dataDVD, portable hard drive, or online.<br>  <br>  If you have digital tapes such as miniDV or digital8 you can easily import those videos directly into your computer using a firewire cable and your camcorder.  Just connect a firewire to dv out on the camcorder and a firewire port on your computer and using a video capture software to capture the video.  Windows Movie Maker comes on your computer and can do this or StashSpace.Com offers a free one called stahBox that can do this as well.  You can also send them your digital tapes.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|ruR7dODvaa	i dont know but what i do know is that walgreens can convert vhs videos onto a cd and from there you can extract the video from cd to your hard drive|`|bda90c576f1d500516702950d3dbb7ffaa	Yes, check out Dazzle's website.

Agt5JpTZaa	No, you don't have to put in your credit card number. There should be a button that says 'skip this step' or something like that. All it's doing is trying to get you to sign up and put your store credit on iTunes. You can upload a CD and put it on there, yeah. My mom has an iPhone and she did that with my David Archuleta CD lol. I'm not entirely sure if you can go to a website like jamglue or aimini and put it on there, but I'm sure you can. I know you can with a regular iPod. :]<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|Ex9uDEBQaa	you MUST put some sort of credit on your itunes account to register the ipod for use with itunes.

You don't need an itunes account, but if you have an itouch I suggest you get one because if you have an account you can right click on songs and choose "get album artwork" and it'll get it for you...it's way easier than finding them on google and you'll probably want to have them with an itouch.|`|AdhtCYQOaa	it'll ask you for a credit card number, but it won't necessarily charge you right away|`|7iugcRV6aa	You only have to add your credit card number if you want to buy something in the itunes store, or you can buy a gift card from a shop if you dont want to use cards.

BYHmKxpdaa	It's a good reciever.I have the R15, I don't really see the difference. How much are they charging you? You can talk them down. You will be signing a 2 year agreement to lease this reciever. If you have an HD Tv, then its worth it for the HD, I can get one for $100, but I want it free, lol. They WILL charge you 9.99 a month for HD service. A Tivo is not a regular DVR. Its a seperate service that you have to pay for and it is awesome. Directv used to have a Tivo DVR, but they stopped. Now in the second half of this year, they will be releasing a Tivo HD Dvr. With the Directv/Tivo DVR combo, you won't have to pay for Tivo service, it will be on your directv bill.|`|nQ7G1nBVaa	It is not  a TiVo based DVR.

Otherwise, there is no way to copy them onto your new laptop. If you do have a copy, you'll need to log into iTunes store with the account you purchased them from to validate your new laptop as belonging to the person who bought the songs (otherwise they will be locked and won't play).<br>  To put your music onto your iPod from the new laptop, you will have to import everything into iTunes and sync your iPod to it. It should be easy to do this as iTunes will ask if you'd like to swap the syncing mechanism to your new laptop rather than the old computer.<br>  Unfortunately all the music already on your iPod will be deleted if you do not have a copy of it on the computer, but it is the only way to get new music on!<br>  I hope this helps :)|`|4OAuRPwuaa	you have to register your ipod on your laptop.  you can only register your ipod on a few computers.<br>  to transfer your music from your ipod to itunes on your taptop you have to get a program like ipod rescue.

6GIrW5eWaa	It's sort of a wash in my mind. If you buy it at the store lets use 1600 points as an example. Lets say you go to walmart and pay 19.99 plus tax for it that brings it to 20.99 based on a 5% sales tax. If you buy them on live then you pay 20.00 bucks. You didn't have to drive to the store and use gas which in the end it's better to buy them on live than at the store. Now the reason they go point and not $$ is a little more complicated as you suggest and I believe that others might think this as well. If they sell you points you really don't have an actual value like money so when they charge 400 points for a video or a song addition on rockband or GH you just spent 400 points. but you they tied a dollar value to it you might think that's a little expensive maybe I will wait to get it. So you are correct in that it is complicated but I'm sure in the long run MS is making out.

HcZppReOaa	It'll be in this month or next month and it's supposed to be a big update.<br>  <br>  Here are rumoured details of the next update:<br>  <br>  Friends List: <br>  ? Voice Messaging is now available as an alternative to text after selecting a user on the friends list. Voice message recordings are capped at 30 seconds. <br>  ? Home Integration: Saved Playstation Home avatar photos can be selected as photo ID for Gamer Card/Friends List. <br>  ? Trophy number and Gamer Level are listed under Friend names for quick reference. <br>  <br>  Gamer Card & Trophies: <br>  ? Gamer Card layout has been changed to more closely resemble the Playstation Store aesthetic. <br>  ? Past Trophy information can be viewed in detail by selecting "Recent Trophy History" option. <br>  ? Newly aquired trophies auto-sync in the background <br>  ? Server infrastructure for Trophies has been optimized. Resulting in faster retrieval time for Gamer Card and Trophy information. <br>  <br>  In-Game XMB: <br>  ? Loading time for In-Game XMB has been drastically reduced, resulting in a more seemless in-game experience. <br>  ? "Theme settings" options while in-game is now available, allowing custom themes to be applied to the In-Game XMB. <br>  ? Internet Browser can now be accessed while in-game. <br>  ? Voice messaging and voice chat options can be used while in-game. <br>  ? Options that cannot be used in the XMB during game sessions are grayed out (but still selectable) to eliminate user accessibility confusion. <br>  <br>  Misc: <br>  ? Other slight UI tweaks and enhancements. <br>  <br>  Seems like there is still no word on cross-game invites, but I think the integration of Home (as small as it is) into the rest of the Playstation experience is still a step in the right direction.

If you do choose to continue with a goal of becoming a pro, you will will have already started a professional camera system.<br>  <br>  As your course work continues, you can continue buying additional lenses and build the system you will eventually be using as a pro.  Nikon and Canon are the only two systems that not only have all the equipment that pros will need during the life of their careers, but are supported by professional services which can supply loaner or demo cameras while either they are covering major events or their own cameras are in for cleaning and calibration.<br>  <br>  Good used 35 mm cameras with a standard zoom lens should cost under ￡100|`|dWK3NCIJaa	It depends. Do you need a d-slr or and film slr?I'm not much of a film fan so i have a canon 50D. There is a lot of complaints about the camera but personally i love it. It's better then the manufactural DSLRs and still not worthy enough to be called a professional DSLR. Is a reasonable price for what it can do and has a max. shutter speed of 1/8000 of a sec.<br>  <br>  There is to more things you have to think about for a d-slr. First, what type of photography do you want to focus on and second, do u want a full frame or a small format sensor.<br>  <br>  If you want to go in to sport or wildlife and want to freeze those images you would want a camera with a fast shutter speed. But if your looking for general pictures and mostly just landscape and wide angling images, a cheaper 3f/p sec. camera would be fine like the canon Rebel series. <br>  <br>  If you already have some experience with film SLRs you should go for a full frame sensor cuz it covers a lot more area and see more of the image then a small format sensor and also the full frames are 35mm so it captures any kind of image like how a film camera would. Full frame sensor how ever is only in professional cameras and are extremely expensive. I recommend the cheaper small frame sensor slrs because it still creates amazing images and also have a benefit of creating more of a telephoto effect the a full frame sensor.|`|TdjVHLOfaa	I have a standard canon camera which worked for me, I strongly recommend this type of SLR camera because once you know how to use it, there really easy to adapt to!!<br>  <br>  you want one that looks like this.... <a href="http://www.toffsworld.com/images/stories/home/canon_slr.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.toffsworld.com/images/stories...</a> ... this may be the digital one... but get one with one of these....<a href="http://images.digitalcamerainfo.com/images/upload/Image/new/reviews/Canon/EOS-50D/photos/Canon-EOS-50D-controls-375.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://images.digitalcamerainfo.com/imag...</a> sooo handy!!!<br>  <br>  :) enjoy your coursee!! if you have any questions about the course, feel free to ask me, im doing my second year of it now.. :)<br>  x

1c56d6640f8046a9cd43f450d0c344a0aa	Pro logic will only attempt to create a "pseudo-surround" experience. It cannot provide even close to Dolby digital unless the original source was created with pro logic in mind, which most sources aren't.<br>  <br>  Your problem lies in the way you have connected the XBOX 360. Red and white audio cables, as you mentioned, are STEREO cables. Therefore no, you will not get dolby 5.1 surround sound.<br>  <br>  You never posted the model number of the Harman Kardon receiver but unless it has optical or digital coaxial inputs, you will not be able to get surround sound from your XBOX and will at best be able to get Pro Logic.

pnHXnjpVaa	ok, i have the elite and the only thing i know that is different is the color and the memory capacity. iv never been told that it has better graphics and i dont notice. so depending on your money situation its like this..... Normal is for the people who like to have fun for a good price while the elite is really for the memory purposes but you could allways find a hard drive on the internet so just go with what you feel is right.|`|hQVteKFTaa	There is NO difference between the graphics of the 360 elite and the 360 premium.  What the elite does have that makes it better than the premium is a larger hard drive, and an HDMI port.  The HDMI will provide better resolution on Hi-Def tv's.  In my opinion it is better to go with the elite if only for the larger hard drive.  This is because with the new Xbox 360 firmware you can install games to your hard drive.|`|nbc9mR7kaa	The Xbox 360 Elite does not have better graphics than the normal Xbox 360 ..but what is does have Is alot of memory( 120 GB).. it may run smoother than the normal Xbox 360 though.. i have heard also that the Xbox 360 Elite lasts way longer than the Xbox 360|`|pVKSYgf3aa	yes, the only noticable differances is the hard drive space, and hdmi cables.  but also, it uses more solder to hold the gpu in place so that it prevents the red ring of death.  its just overall better quality|`|mqJBxknFaa	I thought the elite had better graphics but if you connect it with a HDMI cable then they seem to all deliver 1080p (top HD format). If done by scart they are still the same (I think)<br>   <br>  <br>  (PS3s are rubbish arent they)|`|VlmN3TLeaa	No they all look the same.<br>  But if u have the HDMI cable like I do bcuz it came with my Elite.<br>  It will look better on a HDTV.<br>  And the Elite lasts longer than the normal 360 bcuz the Elites are more durable..|`|q6uyloYdaa	There is no real graphical difference between the two types of 360's, but the Elite has the HD cables so if you have an HD TV it will look better. There really isn't any other difference besides the hard drive space. Go for the 360 Pro; it's cheaper and has all you need.

jLTDqVHsaa	I have the HV30.  It would be very difficult to find the HV10 (or even the HV20) now, because of the HV30.  The HV40 is on the way as well.<br>  <br>  The HV10, as described in that review, had some issues that had to be worked out in later versions.  The HV20 did a good job on that, and the HV30 further improved on the HV20.  With the huge improvements in later versions, I really don't see why anyone would want the HV10 unless you can get it at an incredibly good price.  It's pretty well outdated by now.<br>  <br>  As for easy loading to the computer, it's the same as the HV20 and HV30.  Just use a FireWire cable.  This works for standard-definition DV as well as HDV (for editing programs that support HDV).  It's very easy, as easy as any other DV-tape-based unit.<br>  <br>  If we were talking about the HV30, then yes, I would strongly recommend it.  All kinds of nice little helpful features to allow you to manually adjust your video if you want, including manual audio level control.  As for the video itself, quite good.  I've been very happy with it.  I am still hanging onto MiniDV tape, as it is still the best-quality video format of the consumer formats.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Hey, if you can really get an HV10 for just $35, and it works, then absolutely yes, go for it!  But just make sure that the deal is legit, and that the thing works.  This would be a big-time reduction from what it used to cost when it was new.<br>  <br>  As for a FireWire cable, there are a few names for it, including i.Link, DV, and IEEE 1394.  Different names, but it's the same cable.  There are also 4-pin and 6-pin varieties of plugs.  The 4-pin is small and rectangular, with a little indentation along one of the long sides.  The 6-pin is a little longer and looks like a long pentagon.  Just look up images of each to see them.  The camera will have a 4-pin port, and if your computer has a port, it should either be 4-pin or 6-pin.  Depending on which one your computer has, get the appropriate cable (4-to-4 or 4-to-6).  Keep in mind, this is NOT USB, it's something different.  FireWire and USB are not compatible with each other.<br>  <br>  Your computer may or may not have a FireWire port.  If it has neither a 4-pin nor 6-pin port, then you'll have to purchase and install a FireWire card, which isn't very expensive.  What kind of computer are you working with?  Perhaps I can help you evaluate your options.<br>  <br>  But yes, if you can really get it for $35, and the deal is legit, and you get it in good working condition, it'll be a great deal.<br>  <br>  However, I'm skeptical.  It seems that the $35 listings for the camera on that linked site are actually for batteries instead of the camera itself.  Here's the Amazon link from that page -- look at the top:<br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/B000RP25VA/ref=asc_df_B000RP25VA723693?ie=UTF8&condition=new&tag=cnet-ce-mp-20&creative=380345&creativeASIN=B000RP25VA&linkCode=asm" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/B...</a><br>  <br>  It appears that the CNET price listing there might have looked for "HV10" and pulled the price from the listings, but it had actually found listings for the battery instead.  Double-check me on that.  Ask if you have any further questions.
6S3P1XFPaa	HI Pip <br>     Also to add to the first answer . Panasonic are in the DVD Minus camp &   Philips are in the DVD Plus camp.<br>  They now can usually play both( & some record ) Plus is the simpler format . But Minus allows you to edit and then reuse that space on a DVD -RW.  But that Disc  has to be formatted in VR mode to allow editing, but then it will only allow play back in a similar dvd recorder after its been finalised  <br>    So if a Minus Disc(-RW) needs formatting, format it in VIDEO mode .Or to make certain use a PLUS R (+R) record once Discs . See if it needs finalising in the menu. Then it should play in all basic DVD players. <br>      Why do they have to make it so complicated ? Hope this makes sense .|`|pn79ISFeaa	As above but also Panasonic suport DVD RAM which Philips do not.|`|AEaWwjm4aa	Do you leave the Finailize the Disk?  once you burn a disk you need to close the session and finalize before it can be played on other dvd players. however once you finalize a disk, you cannot burn more information on it.
d1fee41232bb81bff138e747ce6187bdaa	What is your source of TV signal? Cable or satellite? If so, you need to run the component cable or HDMI cable out from the cable box to your home cinema receiver. The receiver will decode the signal and send the audio out to the speakers and you should have a video out to the TV from the cinema receiver.<br>  <br>  Never ever hook up anything to the TV audio output. It is not coded for surround sound. All you will get is 2 channel stereo. A TV doesn't have the means to read or transmit 5.1 surround output.

So far so good. I read all the reviews and thought for the price this was a good choice.<br>  It works with an sd card, it doesn't come with one so if you order the camera, order an sd card too. I got a 16G and recently ordered two 8 G as back ups plus I have a canon a570is digi so I can interchange. It works great out side. I turned the digital zoom off and only use the optical, if you zoom too much you need a tripod. <br>  <br>  It does not perform well inside with low light unless you are very close. There are a lot of settings but I haven't found one that really cures that problem. It's small and light weight. The software doesn't work with vista 64 bit but I have a card reader and I use pinnacle sudio11 ultimate. <br>  I bought the flash drive camcorder because my minidv is 5 years old and requires a firewire connection which my new laptop doesn't have and I just wanted a new one. I carry my fs100 and my A570IS in my purse all the time. (granddaughter does cute stuff).  It takes a decent still picture out doors. So far the battery is great. Canon also has excellent customer service. <br>  I think amazon has it for 249.00 about 30.00 less than what I paid. <br>  <br>  Like I said so far so good.

j5Apt8hWaa	The are both fine cameras ... I am curious about why you would want to shoot video of nearly 30 minutes.<br>   <br>  As a former videographer, I can tell you that over 90% of the video "takes" were in the range of from 10 to 90 seconds long.  That makes the video editors job so much easier, since they don't have to look though so much video just to find the shots they need to put together a ten to fifteen minute short or 30 spot.<br>  <br>  Since you are going to be both the shooter and editor, make it easy on yourself and block the shots before you start shooting and then keep each take shorter than a half an hour.|`|6489dd6288438d0ac1d6bd81b79f0d8daa	The Canon SD890 IS has better image quality than the TZ5, no question.<br>  <br>  But, in regards to each camera's video capability, the SD890 IS can record movies at a top resolution and frame rate of 640x480 @ 30fps. File sizes are approx. 2mb per second, so you can record around 8 minutes of video per every 1GB. Movie file sizes are limited to 4GB each, so if you use a 4GB card, you could record a movie almost 32 minutes in length (if you wanted to).<br>  <br>  You will need to use a high speed memory card. I recommend the very popular and reliable, Sandisk Extreme III SD (limited to 2GB)...or SDHC (available in capacities from 4GB)...format before use.<br>  <br>  The advantage of the TZ5, is that it can record video in high definition (1280 x 720 @ 30fps). File sizes are around 29mb per 10 seconds of video (approx. 173mb per minute). A 2GB card fills up in around 11 minutes...so, a 4GB card would be required if you want to shoot at least 15 minutes. You will DEFINITELY need to use a high speed memory card in order to shoot in HD. Once again, Sandisk's Extreme III is the card to beat. If you use a card that's not fast enough, the camera WILL struggle.<br>  <br>  If recording movies of such long lengths, always make sure the batteries are fully charged before use. However, you will most likely need to edit them anyway, because I really doubt if you could get a good movie from just ONE take. You can easily edit them in Movie Maker or similar program, though.<br>  <br>  good luck...|`|cc030d61dc9bcfd7d41ed6138df0d0b1aa	canon is better

OF4FiIKPaa	Yeah only because the output end of the connector (the one that connects directly to your 360) is only designed to fit your console.  You get what you pay for.  The higher end cables that are available are built better with more superior materials.  Meaning they will provide higher quality performance over the life of the product.  The higher the quality the better the experience.  I always say if you can afford it, buy it!  If I was you I would just go with brand name Microsoft parts.

U3wdBzhKaa	Your going to need the edge on becuase a picture message is data and in order to recieve data you need edge on. I'm not sure about wifi though, but I'll doubt it will work since you need cellular network (aka edge) to recieve text messages. Anyways I hoped his helped. Also with swirly mms it's one of tricky to use becuase you have to tell AT&T to activate mms on the sim card. I don't know how it will work with t mobile.

I would suggest looking up "IPod nano screen replacement" Because the videos are close to the same and there are hundreds of them. Ill try to explain a little though:<br>  First you need to pry off the back cover of the ipod and you will see 2 ribbons, take a small flathead screwdriver and pry the one to the hard drive off. Leave the one to the battery.<br>  After that, you will lift up on the hard drive and set your back cover aside, this should leave the front side open so you can just maneuver your center piece back on to the pad underneath it (Can be pretty tricky to line up)<br>  Then reconnectt the hard drive ribbon and flip the tab down, this will lock it in place.<br>  Then simply put yourhard driveve back in and snap the back back on.|`|wTfEYPsIaa	Does it need to be charge?

4Z0G5x52aa	You can install them, but you still need the disk. The purpose of installing it is to make the 360 not work as hard so you can play for longer amounts of time. Think about how much money video game companies would lose if everyone borrowed a game from a friend and had full access for free. If you still want to install it though (which I recommend) go to "My Xbox" on the Xbox Dashboard, and then hit 'game details' on the game. There will then be an option to install it onto the hard drive. It takes up around 8 GB though, so be careful.|`|m4Adh6tUaa	you still need the disk in the drive to play<br>  <br>  but it plays from hard drive not disc...disc doesnt spin<br>  <br>  but you have to play from your hard drive go to game library to install and play from HD

Then, fret the same string at the 12th fret.  The note should still be in tune.  If it's not, then you need to adjust the bridge saddle to compensate.<br>  <br>  If the note at the 12th fret is sharp, you need to effectively lengthen the string by moving the saddle away from the neck.<br>  <br>  If it's flat, you need to shorten it by moving the saddle toward the neck.<br>  <br>  Make sure that you retune the open string each time you adjust the saddle.  And don't bother trying this on strings that are very old.  After a long period of use, they don't vibrate uniformly anymore, and that makes it almost impossible to set the intonation.<br>  <br>  Greetings from Austin, TX<br>  <br>  Ken

r7tzSp9caa	Since all your songs were purchased from iTunes store, try "Transfer Purchases" option. See <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1329" rel="nofollow">http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1329</a><br>  <br>  If some of your songs were from other sources, you will need to utilize some iPod transfer program to help you. I personally used Tansee iPod Transfer <a href="http://gutensoft.com/Utilities/Tansee-iPod-Transfer.htm" rel="nofollow">http://gutensoft.com/Utilities/Tansee-iP...</a><br>  It will help you transfer all songs and videos (both purchased and non-purchased) on your iPod back to your other computer and iTunes completely and safely.|`|7QEcLWuzaa	Transfer iPod/iPhone/iTouch apps to computer or recover lost or missing music, backup and restore all of iPod/iPhone/iTouch content I recommend you Cucusoft iPhone/iTouch/iPod to Computer Transfer.

She gave me her old ipod nano and got an itouch. When I plugged the ipod into my computer, it said that there were songs that were on the ipod that were not on the computer. There was an option that said something about putting the ipod songs onto itunes. From the past, I remembered that my sister's songs were not my type, so I didn't select that option, I just deleted everything. If you do plug the ipod in and it deletes your songs, just re-sync the songs from your computer with the songs. The only other thing is to make an Itunes shop account and see if your songs are saved. This is all I can think of. Hope this helps!|`|yIlW7lmZaa	okay lets see if i remember <br>  <br>  first you hook up your ipod to your computer. <br>  then you go to my computer and your ipod should pop up. <br>  you open the folder. <br>  then you go to tools and folder options. <br>  then you click on view in the little box that appears. <br>  look for the box that says SHOW HIDDEN FILES AND FOLDERS. and click on it. <br>  then open up ipod control and double click on music. <br>  (there should be alot of files that say F00)<br>  all those files are your music. <br>  after that you just copy it to a folder were you would like to keep your music. you can leave the files with those names or you can rename them . <br>  <br>  hope this helps!! <br>  <br>  ?Adriana|`|HRbvhC6kaa	I used TouchCopy to do this - it copied all my iPod songs, videos and photos to my new iTunes library. It was really easy to use and it worked for purchased music and also for music I imported myself from CDs.|`|FTG6M0Luaa	You can just burn the song that you bought into a cd or send it in an email to yourself as an attachment or put in a USB and then transfer it to your other computer :)|`|5PSdWhXDaa	you can do this by using 3rd party ipod manager software or u can do it by manual music transfe from ipod to itunes and ipod to computer. in source i have given one artilce that guide u for ipod to itune transfer.

ac53eed0ec00a2d980be53069b559e62aa	$0<br>  <br>  how do I know?  I'm a GameStop employee.  did you buy it used?  you could get all of your money back.  did you buy it new?  sorry.  you'll either get another copy or store credit if they don't have another copy.  you can't just tell them you got it used either.  you want cash, you need your receipt.  but again, if you bought it new, you'll get nothing.  you could always trade it in, like it's been said, but you're not guaranteed those numbers you were told ($5-$7 dollars???  IT DEPENDS ON THE GAME!!!!!!!  could be more, could be less), and that is store credit.  you want cash, you'll only get 80% of the store credit they tell you it's worth.<br>  <br>  seriously, rent from now on.|`|aROiy2Gnaa	probably a little less than u bought it for|`|0AUTZt5Aaa	First of all, you should have rented it.<br>  <br>  They can't return it if it is open, and if you say it is defective, then like the answer above me said, they will test it and it will work so they won't.<br>  <br>  They will trade it in for $5-7 as a used game.|`|YM1Xjt8Jaa	Typically your Trade in stores buy it for half te sell it for. So you will get $10.50|`|b3b9eafde2a033943ecae8909779b52baa	No.|`|AuQBlXdhaa	no, you will get about $8|`|883997fad881ac64eae0f38b785bef3daa	Not likely at gamestop unless you say it was defective, then they will likely test it out in front of you. And call your dumb self out. Or, they will give you like 5 dollar exchange credit. Pretty bogus. Renting is more economically friendly.
F2znLWdWaa	Hacked PSP? hmm... Most likely, the only time you face this issue is with downloading psp games. Some games that are downloaded are in CSO. format instead of ISO. and that causes them to freeze. <br>  <br>  For example: I bought Bleach: heat the soul 5, then ripped it, & compressed it so i could keep it on my memory stick. but it doesn't support cso. So while i'm playing sometimes it freezes and the entire system reboots. all you have to do is change it to iso format.|`|sFz6v7Ohaa	You shouldn't have hacked your PSP. Reformat your PSP to Original Factory Setting, and do a system Update. That should fix it.|`|912889ffe6d1f7e7c946f67482ee58dcaa	7 hours of playing time?  Wow.<br>  <br>  The only thing I can come up with is you are accidentally holding the power switch.

So if I get this right, you bought a phone from an ebay seller, and when you got it, Verizon said the ESN was on their list of lost/stolen phones, you called the phone number and the person who answered said they had it reported as stolen? Sounds like you got scammed by someone selling stolen phones and you're SOL. You should contact Ebay or Paypal and see about getting your money back, and for sure you should be leaving negative feedback on a seller who sold you a stolen phone.
fEKCRmv8aa	I recently found out that unless have have the $10 package, messages to other Verizon customers IS NOT free.  With the $10 package you get unlimited messages to other verizon customers and an additional 500 to whoever
