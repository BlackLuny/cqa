ki3XY49daa	Totally normal I assure you.  Even though by now you're quite big with baby, you are still stretching and will continue to do so.  In fact, that sharp pain in your side will probably stick around til the end.  It's a pain in the ***, but when you're laying down and about to get up, roll very slowly to your back and sit up even slower.  You might still feel the pull, but it shouldn't be as bad.  Another thing you can do is counter pressure.  When you go to get up, press in on your side a little bit and it will also help you.  Trust me...I'm a pro at this.|`|SA1y0lm1aa	i had that with my second son...... it is from walking to fast .... you are getting to big to walk fast... i was a waitress and walked fast at work and the doc had to make me stop walking fast at 6 months because of the pain... and 7 to 8 months its time to waddle like the pregnant girl you are;) jk.... just walk a little slower you will still get where you need to go... if you don't its going to hurt hurt hurt.....the pain will stop in about 2 days if you slow down a lot..... but you have to stay slower till the end.....|`|AA11476951	I had the exact thing happen to me in Walmart a couple of weeks ago. As soon as I took a break it went away. This is completely normal as long as the pain goes away when you rest. If it won't stop or it gets really bad then you should worry.
2DXXEOrYaa	THIS IS HOW YOU CAN TELL IF YOUR HAVING CONTRACTIONS....<br>   When u feel your belly tighten up, feel your check, then your forehead. If your belly feels like your cheek, its not contractions, but if it feels more like your forehead, it IS contractions. Also your uterus will bunch up and harden, somewhat could be feeling like youve done a thosand situps.

fa0dd5777a3c1d7f167867babbfebd0baa	I start trying at 37 weeks. Besides walking and sex, I've heard that doing squats and walking up and down the stairs help out a lot. I try to squat every time I pick up our son's toys or while changing his diaper. I've been doing a lot of this and today I'm 38w6d pregnant. Hopefully I'll get some results soon or at least be dilated more than 2cm. That's where I was at on Monday at my appointment (: Good luck to you. We're almost there.|`|w3ob12X6aa	i was around 38 weeks when i was just so over it i just wanted her to come out , people told me so much stuff to do but someone told me to take a little of ''castor oil'' its a laxative some how it was suppose to make contractions start.. hah that was a big mistake because i was practically in the bathroom the whole night lol but really nothing i think works the baby will come when he or she wants and it will be when you least expect it. good luck|`|MqFeJiukaa	With my first I tried at 39 weeks, and 40 weeks and he came at 41 weeks.  I drank castor oil, walked and had sex.  I also had a membrane sweep at 38 weeks and nothing happened.  With my 2 week old I ate fresh pineapple a lot during the pregnancy just because I liked it.  I got a membrane sweep at 38 weeks and on the day I turned 39 weeks my water broke.  I never started contractions and had to be induced.  <br>  Babies come when they are ready it don't matter what you do.  At 37 weeks I was super tired of being pregnant.  I was 3cm and 50% effaced at my 37 weeks appt.  Just walk and try to be patient.  Good Luck.|`|CpiLHcTlaa	i tried pineapple and honestly... it tasted good.. and did NOTHING. I know those last few weeks suck... good luck! <br>  <br>  i knew a girl who went for a walk after having sex. she got pains and her water broke. she went to the hospital was dilated one cm got in an ambulance and got transferred (and hour long drive) she got there and was 10cm! they had to rush her to a bed so her daughter wasn't born in the ambulance! lucky girl it only took her like 10 minuets to push the baby out to!|`|ca9dEvSAaa	I am 39 weeks and 1 day. I have still not tried to induce my labor with anything. I do walk now, but I'm only 1cm dilated so I doubt that will help labor progress. Maybe just give me stronger muscules (I was previously on bed rest)|`|apSTH4TIaa	I start trying things around 38 weeks, but all my babies were late no matter how much walking, sex, spicy food, or squats I did.  A little thing the doctor gave me always does the trick its called MISO and its a gel insert that is placed by your cervix.  If you are ready to go into labor it kick starts it and thats it.  Way better than a pitocin induction (those are awful).  Good luck.|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	i guess go for it but i would wait till you are a week or 10 days closer to your day every day counts to right now

Good luck!|`|ca9dEvSAaa	I have gained 32lbs at 39 weeks 1 day.<br>  <br>  You don't gain 25 lbs in the first weeks of pregnancy. Regardless of if you are pregnant or not something is going on here. You should see a doctor, perhaps a thyroid problem.|`|FhlmiI7daa	Have you been put on any medications or have you just entered into puberty.  weight gain can be caused by a lot of things besides pregnancy|`|SA1y0lm1aa	yes take a test you might be very preg..... and if not you still need to see a doc about the hunger if you are not preg ......|`|2YfnzbRnaa	no,is just that you're eating like a pig!!! stop eating as much and watch how you'll start loosing the enormous amount of weight|`|QY4uvctMaa	To test if your overweight go on <a href="http://www.nhlbisupport.com/bmi/" rel="nofollow">http://www.nhlbisupport.com/bmi/</a><br>  <br>  Being pregnant will depend on if you are in a sexual relationship or not, if you are not then maybe you are eating to much fatty foods or maybe not doing enough exercise. <br>  <br>  If you are not in a sexual relationship, you do plenty of exercise and you eat healthily, then MAYBE but very unlikely you could have some sought of illness coming on.|`|gtDg845naa	If you have sex there is always a chance that you could be pregnant.

kouvKvjSaa	i dont have much family or friends either. your not that alone...i didnt have a baby shower either. it made me really sad too, but in the end, all that mattered was that i was having a beautiful baby. <br>  i felt really bad too and now im preg with #2 and i kinda feel the same way, but maybe i'll do something else, like just go out with my sister or something small. it sucks when you dont have family, or else your family is very torn.|`|1QYXNmwJaa	At times everyone at one point feels lonely. But you should be happy that your bringing in someone wonderful into this world. Being sad about something you dont have is a waste of time, instead you should cherish what you do have. Good Luck and i hope everything gets better with you.|`|58G7ZAJpaa	i have to say: at least you have your husband there.  There are women out there that have been walked out on, and STUCK taking care of their babies alone whether they want to or not.. or like myself : my husband is deployed, so I don't have the option of spending the time with him either.  Being military, and new to the area, my family is 1200 miles away, and his family is at least 2-3 hours away.  Friends are numbered few due to being new here, so I spend my days HAPPILY alone with my 3 year old.<br>  <br>  I had to start this pregnancy from scratch, but it's fun.  It's a new adventure, and exciting to get things for the baby.  Go to consignment shops.  People DONT have to bring you things, and you DON'T have to have a baby shower.<br>  <br>  We ALL feel lonely at times, but BE THANKFUL FOR WHAT YOU HAVE!!|`|xq7S9H5Raa	sometimes I fee lonely too.  If you have at least one person who is a faithful friend or family member you can always depend on them to talk about everything.
8d5f0adc83a9aec3f83894da97ca8d80aa	(((HUGS)))) that's very normal. I've had two babies and I worried like that with every single one. I think it's part of the process. It's such a fragile little life and it's all laying in your hands. That can be worrying. That's also part of motherhood I think. That feeling that something will happen to them hasn't left me yet, and my oldst is almost 14 now. <br>  <br>  just keep reminding yourself that everything will be fine. if you're healthy and you eat good and take your vitamins and you had no problems iwht the other two, there's no reason to think this one won't be perfectly normal too.|`|fmgPKOaraa	share this with your doctor and he will set up tests that may help to reassure you.  your hormones are running rampant and you are giving into unjustified fears.  why waste your time worrying about things that may never happen, when you could be using the time to love your husband and prepare for the baby you've made?<br>  <br>  now is the time for love and rejoicing, not stress and fear.  make a choice...|`|YNH2fmYWaa	everything will be fine.<br>  <br>  but you could be causing stress from thinking about this too much, which could be very harmful to the baby.  just know that you and your baby are going to be perfectly fine. <br>  <br>  try not to stress out! good luck|`|3ec4c66236d45c263eb7e7fd20363059aa	I am sure you and your baby will be fine,don't stress out to much, it will make you feel worse! Remember people are having babies late into there 40's and your still young!|`|EzOyBLztaa	I had a miscarriage at 12 weeks with my first baby (also my husband's first).  When I got pregnant again I was terrified that I would miscarry again.  I worried all throughout my pregnancy about EVERYTHING.  And it did me no good.  It's perfectly normal and understandable that you would worry but know that no amount of worrying is going to make it any better.  My doctor told me after my miscarriage that there was nothing I could have done to have prevented it.  So try, as hard as it may be, not to stress.  By the way, my husband is 43 and I was concerned about time and age too too.  Our little boy was born happy and healthy on February 5th.  So keep positive thoughts!  Good luck!!<br>  <br>  .|`|vygYFdsSaa	We all have worries despite our age. We can't really make ourselves stop worrying but just try not to focus on the negatives. Just be as positive as you can, do everything right and focus on making baby healthy. Congratulations on your third :)|`|kprKXEOSaa	You think your only value to your husband is as a baby machine?  Yes, there are things that could go wrong, but every couple faces that.  I'm sure he loves you for more than your ability to bear his child.<br>  <br>  Edit: Irrational fears are just a part of being pregnant.  I've had them with each of my 3 pregnancies.  I was certain last time that my husband was having an affair--he wasn't, and intellectually, I knew he wasn't, but I was just devastated that our marriage was ending--while at the same time I knew it really wasn't so and I knew it was just the hormones talking.  You're totally normal.  The only way I know of, to overcome the irrational, hormone-induced fears of pregnancy, is to give birth.  I wasn't trying to be rude.|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	u r 1 yr older than me is all <br>  you are just fine really <br>  36 isnt old in fact a lot of dr liek older moms because we dont need talking to like some younger moms like eating right etc I AM NOT SAYING YOUNG MOMS ARE BAD  LOL<br>  everything will be great My baby is due in May and I have no problems .

Generally the family will be standing near to the casket (whether it's open or closed it doesn't matter) and when you first arrive you basically get in a line to go up to them.  You give your sympathies to them (handshakes or hugs, or whatever is more comfortable for you) then you will walk to or past the casket.  Some people stop to say a prayer (usually there is something there to kneel on) or say their goodbyes, and then you move on.  Sometimes there will be a service, like a prayer service.  You are not required to stop at the casket if you do not want too, it's not considered bad manners not too, some people just can't.  No one will look down at you.<br>  <br>  Depending on where the funeral starts, usually it does from a church.  A service will be held (or just something small depending) and after the service everyone will follow the casket in the hearse to the graveyard for burial.  Another small service is usually done there.  Some people stay around for the casket to be lowered and covered but it's not usually required.  A lot of the time the family will have a gathering, sometimes at their home, sometimes at a hall to get together with family and friends.<br>  <br>  These are good questions to ask so that you know what is going on, it can be difficult to go to your first funeral.  Remember to wear something in dark colors, grey, black or dark blue, nothing too short, something nice.  <br>  <br>  I am very sorry to hear about your friend, my sympathies to you and to her family during this time of grieving.|`|V1hxvQukaa	i'm sorry. <br>  <br>  i went to my first funeral this year... it was for a senior at my school. <br>  <br>  the wake was really sad. a lot of crying... you could feel the sadness in the air. it was all about consoling the family and seeing the body (if you choose too, i couldn't really handle that).<br>  <br>  the funeral was better. that was more about people who were close to him talking about all the good times and where he is now. less sad, but still sad. <br>  <br>  just make sure you're with someone who can help you through everything, someone to talk to, and someone to cry with.|`|jh1pGSfWaa	i am so so so sorry for you <br>  at the wake they will talk about the good things and memories about your friend <br>  at the funeral she will be buried<br>  that's all i can explain maybe u could go say something about her at the wake it must b heartbreaking to hear your bestie is dead|`|H0sPCJQPaa	I am so sorry about your friend.<br>  I have had my share of loses and I know how you feel.<br>  <br>  I'm going to tell you one thing. It will be hard. Very hard.<br>  You will get through this with your friends and family by your side.<br>  You will have to be brave. Make sure you go in and see her. You will regret it if you don't.<br>  It's going to be really sad. She was young. Lot's of people upset.<br>  Maybe you would want to get her some flowers. I suggest them in her favorite colour. Like if her fave colour was purple get her purple flowers.<br>  The wake is when you go and visit the family. You say you are sorry to the family. You say some of your last good byes there.<br>  The funeral there would be a mass if she is catholic.  The funeral is where you say your last good byes. Then you will go to the graveyard if she is getting buried. <br>  Bring the flowers to the grave. Expect alot of tears and hugs.<br>  God takes people good people away because he has a job for them in heaven.<br>  <br>  Your friend is in a better place.<br>  God Bless and Good Luck<br>  <br>  ?|`|e907f296c0cad138cf4b71ab72a9a9eaaa	first off I am so sorry for the loss of your best friend. the funeral and the wake will be the toughest thing that you will ever have to go through and you will probably never forget the entire experience. the wake is where you and everyone who knew her or her family will show up to express their condolences. some people will laugh at memories of her others will cry uncontrollably and so will you. Her casket will more than likely be open and you'll get to see her one last time. the next day at the funeral more than likely inside of a church, the pastor, priest, or whatever will say a few things, people (usually family members) will have written a speech in her memory and after the ceremony people will follow the hurse to the cemetary. I hope that this helps you somewhat. Once again I am very sorry for your loss|`|pcUAErpQaa	Oh sure one of my family mem passed away. At the wake, you will meet you friend on her coffin. Will its around 1-2-3 hours and you must pray and sing. (I dont know cause we were singing a different language).  <br>     I'm so sorry that your friend passed away. I know what it feels like. :(<br>   <br>  At the funeral you must sing and pray then go to a church then to the cememtary. It takes a lot of hours.|`|XNnuqQQ1aa	I am so sorry for your loss.  I lost my boyfriend to an accident when I was 15.  Times will be difficult for you, but know that eventually time will heal.

It will be a very difficult time for you.  Make sure your Mom or someone that will be very emotionally supportive to you comes with you.  This is not the time to be alone.

I will keep you and your friends and families in my prayers.|`|xSEXFWJ9aa	I am so sorry to hear that my boyfriend was stabbed to death when I was 15 and trust me it is a very painful thing to go through.

vygYFdsSaa	Hi sweetie all of those remedies didn't work for me either. I have a couple of suggestions. My doctor initially recommended to me 25 mg Unisom sleep melts (its the same active ingredient as Benadryl so you could take Benadryl as well) taken with Vitamin B6. I tried this and it did work for a little while but it stopped working. I then was prescribed the anti-nausea medicine Phenergan which is working sooo well. Zofran is another medication she might prescribe you. Make sure you discuss it with your doc before you take anything though. Good luck, I know it sucks... :( How far along are you??|`|YwHl37Hgaa	Each woman is different where morning sickness cures are concerned. What works for one, may or may not work for another.

Not because I like lime, but they seemed to help the morning sickness. I felt sick before I had one, and during. But after about half the popsicle and laying on the couch for a few minutes I felt a lot better. I think it has to do with the citric acid?|`|vWb8fquvaa	Preggie pops were worthless for me! They only seemed to work when it was in my mouth, once gone, it all came back. Crackers did nothing for me either! <br>  <br>  This is going to sound weird but Jolly Ranchers worked best for me. They have to be the hard candy not the chewy ones. I would have to stick to one flavor for the day. if i switched back and forth between flavors it would make me sick. Peach were the best. <br>  <br>  Also Lemon Heads (the actual ones not the knock offs). They are gross but helped so much.<br>  <br>  Walking helped too. outside. I guess it was the fresh that make my stomach settle.<br>  <br>  Morning sickness is the worst! Sometimes ginger ale did the trick. You can take to your OB if its really bad. He can suggest Zofran or Vitamin B to help but get his/her direction before doing so!|`|TvYX1yXWaa	i had very very bad morning sickness and my doc told me to take vitamin b-6 and it helped so much.also a half of unisom to help you to sleep|`|c5AJGcYcaa	had it terrible as well, to the point instead of gaining weight i was losing it.

I did call my doctors office for meds, but my doc was out and the other one wanted to run some tests to make sure nothing else was going on.  Umm, hello?  We're pregnant!!!!!  We need something more!!!!  So, if you've tried everything, go to your doc.  Also, popsicles work ok, but the orange give me terrible heartburn.  Ice water also feels really good going down in the stomach.|`|7d3edabfdc27c4ba2c6cd571f70d965daa	I also had terrible All Day Sickness.  Whoever named it morning sickness was either a man, or crazy.  Like others before me have said, the only thing that was able to help me was medicine from my doctor.  Talk to yours. <br>  <br>  Good luck hun!  It sucks, but it's worth it later!|`|m5eIr6ASaa	I'm preggers with #3 and with all my kids I've to suffered with all day sickness, my doctor recommened unisom I swear by it, it has saved me.  Just to let you know it is a cat B medicine so its safe like tylenol, my 4 and 5 year olds are both smart healthy kids.<br>  <br>  Good Luck<br>  Jenn

tbeO3Lataa	Yes, what others are saying is true, you will not be as hungry. However, this is probably just temporary.<br>  <br>  I will warn you, however, that many women find they cannot tolerate certain foods after they have been pregnant. It will be worth it to have your little guy, though.|`|rjVALevtaa	Expect to be hungry pretty often if you're going to exclusively breastfeed. You actually need more calories for breastfeeding than you do for pregnancy. When I was breastfeeding I was hungry all the time.<br>  <br>  So to answer your question, expect your appetite to increase.|`|wBpennsMaa	I eat more breastfeeding than I did pregnant.|`|wkd5CMNaaa	You won't be as hungry thats for sure, in fact you will be so busy the first few weeks you will have to remind yourself when to eat!|`|sBHhnDwaaa	I'm not as hungry... But I still eat the same, plus an extra snack. Sometimes when he starts eating I have to get something to eat as well. Make sure you drink enough liquids!!
SRzswqTeaa	It kind of depends on the time you give birth (for the hospitals that I know of anyway).  It can also depend on if your baby needs to stay an additional night.  Most hospitals will not let you stay past 3 days, even if your baby is in the NICU.  One to two days is both common.  You can call your hospital and ask them what their policy is.  Usually, if you give birth at lets say 1 in the afternoon, you might go home the next morning.  If you give birth at maybe 11pm, you may or may not go home the next morning, depending on the hospital, how much room they have, and how you are doing.  If you give birth in the early morning, plan on staying that day, and leaving probably the following next morning.  Oh boy, I know.. this answer is as clear as mud!  Probably more than you asked for hu?  1-2 days for a normal vaginal delivery.  Some women will check out sooner if they are doing fine and refuse to stay!|`|i8Ch743Laa	I gave birth on 12:08 pm (daytime) on a Saturday,and went home at about 12:30 or 1 on Monday.|`|yrDqtazLaa	I was let out the third day after both.|`|jQDeTTVhaa	I had my daughter on wednesday and I went home friday morning|`|fHgbL046aa	I gave birth on February 12 and was released February 14 1993. 2 days is the norm. I live in Ontario Canada and that is what the hospitals have in place.|`|AA10015577	I was in there for 3 days by my choice.  I could have left at two days but I really enjoyed my hospital stay (I was the only one in OB).|`|46cbd785e6475e81fd1cbbaa46a93a81aa	I also live in ontario canada(sudbury to be exact) and its 24 hours everything goes ok......i had my son on the 13th went home the 14th....|`|WsUSAgLmaa	Usually 3 days...but some hospitals let you go home the next day if everything is fine. It also depends on what time of the day your baby is born!!|`|sBHhnDwaaa	Because he decided to hang out in Mommy until 11 pm (Friday), we had to stay until Sunday at lunch (36 hours). Its normally only 24.|`|crw44vnRaa	Two days. I was allowed to go home the day after delivery but I stayed longer to get breastfeeding all worked out.|`|8mchLCQhaa	I was ther for 3 days because I couldn't go to the bathroom so they made me stay a little while longer!|`|AA11661793	I had my daughter on a tuesday i went home thursday|`|HhaadKixaa	With the first child They hold you a little longer. I had my first on a Friday and was out by Sunday morning. The second I wanted to just get home and re-coop there so I went home the next morning. By the third child I begged the Doctor to let me stay so I could rest. Knowing I had two children under five waiting for me at home and craving for my attention seemed overwhelming right after birth. All my births were vaginal with no complications. If you want to stay longer and the hospital is treating you good. (It's always nice to have breakfast in bed)Just request to your doctor that you want to stay longer. If this is your first child though I'm sure they'll keep you there long enough for you to re-coop and you'll be ready to get home. Good Luck!|`|zBz10IiOaa	hi hun i was in there for 2 days and my blood pressure dropped real low but only because i am anemic and i lost alot of blood but my son was trasferd100 miles away from me to a childrens hospital and i left from the labor room strait to my son but they usualy just keep you 1-2 days good luck to you hun|`|yKS2UI87aa	I gave birth on a Sunday at 11:28 am and was released on Tues afternoon.

MHOxPs8Oaa	It should be gone by tomorrow, but just make sure to keep washing his face periodically.|`|OHfZFR31aa	Try using toner on a cotton ball/pad. Then put moisturizer or lip balm over it as it can dry out a child's skin.|`|KyFCYs0Yaa	I would try some rubbing alcohol on a q tip. I don't know if it will work, but it gets ink out of clothing...Even if it doesn't work, he will have a nice clean disinfected upper lip! :) Good Luck. Hope your pictures turn out nice!|`|HSe6n5Tlaa	Don't give them kool aid in the first place?  there is no reason to ever give it to a child.  give them 100% juice instead.  then you wouldn't have this unnecessary problem.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	stop buying the chemically laden foods.  the dye will eventually wear off.  change your appointment date.|`|PTdy6TWRaa	That's cute.

If you REALLY crave something (in most aspects) it means that your body is lacking whatever is in that food that you are craving.|`|sXCSVFBaaa	oh my gosh... corn bread with honey butter sounds delicious! Since I'm nearing the end of my pregnancy.... I've been wanting almost nothing but carbs. some days it's fatty carbs like doughnuts, some days I just want bread.

Kz5Fb0mPaa	Yes it makes me very mad. I have bad acid reflux and tend to get sick every morning. Some mornings I wake up early so I eat breakfast. It always ends up coming back up. It's funny you brought up this question because I was talking to my husband about this the other day. I told him, "What's the point in eating breakfast? It just comes back up. I might as well skip it and save me some time in the mornings!"<br>  <br>  How far along are you?? It should get better in the second trimester. That's when alot of weight can be gained and you can eat like crazy!!|`|eU5Eth2aaa	I agree!  What makes me the most upset is when I run and spend $10 on fast food or something and then throw it up!  What a waste of money...and food!<br>  <br>  Luckily I'm starting to get over the nausea!<br>  <br>  Btw...Our Avatars look like twinkies!

Yesterday i seriously considered starting a fist fight in the grocery store parking lot because some women blocked me in.  I just tried to relax.  Try looking at it like "oh, goodie i get to eat again".  Yea i know.  good luck.|`|OElyzFqoaa	Oh I know it sucks!  It feels like a huge waste of money on food!  Rahhhh especially when you're starving! <br>  Eating crackers before out of bed kinda helps.|`|9E91O09caa	First trimester I was notorious for this. It sucks.|`|4XfjUcvDaa	Yeah-I hate when that happens.  Its like you eat something and it tastes so good and then its gone!|`|YiDhb60Paa	all the time|`|eeaXYyCNaa	Yes.  I lost 15lbs in my first trimester because of that.  Which would be a good thing if i wasn't pregnant. Lol.  My doctor told me to try and eat some grits.  I don't know if you like them but, they are easy on the stomach.  And they seemed to be the ONLY thing i that i could keep down.|`|1s3nddaYaa	i did that when i was prego. only once though. i was eating a swiss swirl cake thingy. didn't even make it to the toilet. i havent ate one since and its been almost 2 years
dALaPuXhaa	15 weeks today, and have lost 3, but only because I've been eating better than before I was pregnant.|`|e33QAXShaa	With my 1st I hadn't gained anything, 2nd was twins I'd gained about 3lbs, 3rd had already gained about 10lbs I think it was, and this one I'd gained 3lbs by 16wks.|`|BARCjDhnaa	Not uncommon not to gain much it is in the later stages that the weight piles on.  If you are worride get check out but I just popped out at 26 weeks and upto then I had only gained 2 pounds.|`|zsWlV2GCaa	by 15 weeks i had gained like 15 pounds... my sister gained 70 lbs total during her first pregnancy. im now 23 weeks and have gained 20 lbs|`|445676ee4ba9ef6e5bd44f0f3b9d7501aa	I lost 5 pounds by 15 weeks due to morning sickness.|`|5LAqZUyVaa	@ 15 weeks i gained 10-11 pounds|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	i think i may have only gained like 2 pounds at that point|`|uuHPneEcaa	i don't even remember. I know now at 32w I have gained a average of 30+ pounds!<br>  <br>  I think at that time I was losing weight. I didn't even look pregnant. I was still a stick.. NOW on the other hand. I look like a beached whale. lol|`|AA10015577	I am 20 weeks and have gained 10 lbs.  I have been watching my carbs because I had gestational diabetes with my first and I am trying to stay healthy before/if it gets me.  Depending on your height/weight and if you are right weight, under or over there is a certain amount that you shouldn't gain past.  Good luck!|`|Kz5Fb0mPaa	At 15 weeks I had gained 10 lbs already! I'm 20.5 weeks now and my weight gain is still the same (I lost a few pounds due to acid relux but gained them back).<br>  <br>  Dont worry you will probably start gaining when you're more into your second trimester. I gained early cuz I started showing early!|`|8R2UMbNHaa	I actually lost weight before I gained any, and after that it wasn't until the second trimester.  I think that's normal that you haven't gained any because that baby is still very, very small.|`|vZwJyqc6aa	I had gained about 4 or 5 at that point. Almost 20 weeks now and gained about 9lbs.
BExscPOtaa	I experienced this too!!  I'm 19 weeks now, but when I was around 9 weeks I was full and achy because of gas and constipation!  I would bet that's what it is for you.  your bowels can cause major discomfort and bloating, and your digestive tract reeeeally slows down when you're preggo.  (especially in the 1st trimester.)  so I can pretty much guarantee it's not your uterus swelling huge right now or anything, but rather gas and bloating.  it happened to me too!|`|ruSkTHrgaa	I don't want to "scare" you but could you be having twins. I felt really "big"  and when i went for a scan i discovered that i wasn't as long pregnant as i had thought, it was twins i had 3 before and had not felt as bad with them at the same stage. Are there twins in the family, don't panic it may be hard work but it is fun "two" mine are 16,14,11, and 4 boy and girl good luck|`|62dfb7ea071ca9af65c41faf6cc6de0baa	I had already started to hsow by about 6 weeks! I have read and everyone keeps telling me that your body will fill out faster with subsequent pregnancies. With my first child you couldn't tell I was pregnant until I was 8 months. This one- I was barely even pregnant when my belly started to show a little. :)|`|dbafItLvaa	I've not experienced this, but I bet you're just bloated/retaining water.  I did feel a little swollen, though, by that point in this pregnancy, my second. Be sure to drink lots of water.  That may help the bloating.  Good luck!|`|h3CwzIoBaa	yes its very possible; you can start feeling a difference right away. just be alert to your systoms and keep regular doc. visits remember all pregancy's are different good luck ( :|`|ZbnxGIsnaa	Remember ever pregnancy is different dear.  Sometimes they can all be different and two may be the same and then in your case the third is different.  Having that bloated feeling is perfectly normal dear!!!  =)|`|rjVALevtaa	Sounds like you're bloated. That happened to me during my second pregnancy. My belly constantly felt full and was extended. I believe I was around 9-10 weeks as well.
zwctZ812aa	I miss my son, too! I have 7 hours until I'm off :-(  Makes me so sad because he is sick but I HAD to go to work today...I took yesterday off.  He has a cold and an ear infection and he is only 4 months old..poor baby! I know grandma is taking good care of him, but it's hard to leave my baby anytime..especially when he is sick and just wants to cuddle with mommy!|`|E5CnUdhsaa	i have 40 mins to go....shes at her dads this weekend and they just dropped by here so i can say bye to her. it makes me pine after her and i stare at my picture of her more lol when i go home ill be even worse and probably jump straight back on here to fill the gap :(|`|FLEXqVoiaa	Aww me too. I stayed home yesterday because the weather was really bad and I didn't want to drive in it. But then I wake up this morning and my son is sick! I didn't want to stay home since I missed work yesterday, but now I'm thinking about him non-stop. He's with my parents right now, and I've called them once an hour since I got to work to check up on him and make sure he's OK.|`|4Qb1FNH2aa	Daddy and I are separated and I think I prefer being at work if I have to be away from them. I find I don't know what to do with myself when my kids leave for the weekend! I keep expecting them to come and see me for something or to have to make meals (well, bigger meals...) and so on. At least at work there are periods where I am too busy to think about anything else! :)
hVVALFAPaa	Go in the shower and cry -- no one can hear you!<br>  <br>  When the kids were small, I would declare "Pajama Day!"<br>  <br>  We would close all of the windows and blinds, put on our PJs, spread blankets and pillows all over the floor, make a big bowl of popcorn, pop open a rootbeer (soda is usually forbidden in our house) and watch some ridiculously kid friendly movie-- or rather, they would and I would watch it with my eyes closed....|`|8DnIXwnyaa	I'm 27 weeks pregnant and have a 16 month old son.

I usually go downstairs (where the kids are not allowed) and either do laundry, or pretend to do laundry! <br>  Everyone needs a break sometimes. and even if you put your baby in the bed and let him cry, it will benefit him in the long run to have a mommy that isn't horribly stressed out!<br>  Good Luck!|`|532XA7lkaa	I give my son a favorite movie and snack he wouldn't usually get...like sprite and some candy....and then get him comfy and set up safely in the living room, then I retreat to the futon in the toy room, turn off the lights, leave the door cracked so I can hear, make sure all door are locked and I just lay down in the quiet or read a magazine.

Anyway you can get through this bad patch in your life maybe you could go to your GP and just talk to some1 other than your boyfriend. Or do you have a good friend you could talk to? I hope you would find the courage to get through this painful experience.|`|ebM6CxRQaa	Some immature guys DO act like this. It hits them they are going to be a parent and they get scared of the commitment. They will go out and party (even if they hadn't partied before) and stay out late... they try to make up for the time "they will lose being a dad" You know how some guys have strippers the night before their wedding to get in one last "excitement" before they are always tied down? Well some guys see pregnancy that way... I have 9 months to get it all in... They do no understand what we are going through physically or emotionally. ESPECIALLY because you are not showing it is still kind of surreal to him... I am not making exuces I think he is being a complete jerk. I just have seen some of my friends go through this and then the guy was completely different when the baby was born...<br>  <br>  You do deserve respect... and you must demand that. If he doesn't want to give it... give him his space. Concentrate on YOU and the BABY. Take care of yourself and try not to stress out. I am sorry you are going through this and I hope things get better|`|jd4MzIYtaa	I am really sorry hun but at that age men are not ready to be fathers, some grow up and others avoid the idea but hanging out with friends more and avoiding. I am 14 weeks along and my bf is 22. When we first found out he was terrified. I actually broke up with him and said i didnt need him. 2 days later he was at my house crying saying he wanted to be there and everything. Maybe he needs a wake up call. If that doesnt work then stay strong and get use to being a single mom, it sucks but you dont want a dead beat as a father, it will only bring you down...good luck and i am sorry for the way he has been treating you.|`|zmbeIbx7aa	Sounds to me like this is off to a bad start. Hopefully something will kick in with him and he will be the man you need him to be. I highly doubt it will be anytime soon though. It is ridiculous that he talks to you in such a way that is degrading to you. If a man ever talked to me like that he would never do it again. I don't know how hard it is to be by yourself going through the early stages of pregnancy by yourself but it seems like you are doing everything by yourself now anyways. Just never let a man put you down and make you feel bad about the way you look or who you are. Leave the loser.|`|pxrOzEcKaa	give him more time and see what happens|`|4AZp8Quwaa	What a ***hole. Lose the jerk. He has absolutely no consideration or respect for you. I don't mean to worry you, but he may be cheating on you. What could he possibly be doing out at 3 in the morning? Think of it this way, if he's constantly out spending his money on crap, then he is not going to be responsible when the baby gets here. What makes you think he would change? If he doesn't make a change now, then he never will. I know this probably hurts you a great deal, but by all means, please stand up for yourself. How dare he tell you to shut up. Next time he does that, put him in his place. Do you guys live together? Is it your place, if so, tell him to pack his sh*t and get out. He has a lot of growing up to do sweetie. My mom said my dad was like this before I was born, and she divorced him. My dad regrets his actions to this day. Your boyfriend is not cut out to be a father. You need to spend as much time as you can with family and people who really care about you. You don't need to be stressed like this when your pregnant. You can do it on your own, many women do. Be strong for you and your baby. It will all work out in the end.|`|7KYwQAxpaa	Unfortunately, sometimes we get into predicaments that are difficult to get out of. I know your scared and that's normal. Parenthood is a scary thing, especially when your contemplating doing it alone.. I'm telling you as an outside opinion, the way he treats you is wrong. I know you really want him to come around but how bad are you going to let it get?? Someone who tells you to shut the F up.... isn't someone you should be around while pregnant. You're already emotional enough as it is with the hormones. This guy sounds like he's suffering from Peter Pan Syndrome, he refuses to grow up! You're baby is better off with just Mommy....I think you already know that though. Sometimes in life it's the hardest thing to do the right thing, but life's lessons are always worth learning.|`|9f7da82548dac95c35d6ec34826ec681aa	Dont you care about yourself, even just a little bit?<br>  I mean, why do you think its ok for someone to use you like this?<br>  Not only that, you're allowing this 1st class prat to take your child down with you!<br>  Next time he goes out - before he leaves, agree a reasobale time that he's going to be back.  If he doesnt come back at that time, lock him out.  <br>  As for the job, give him a deadline.  I dont think he can sit at home without any money so Im assuming you're giving him the odd fiver here and there - dont do it anymore AND dont let him eat anything that you paid for. <br>  He might start getting the message.|`|GVsD724zaa	He is abusive. You may not want to leave him now, but you will need to.  Do it before it gets even harder. You will be a good mom but you have to stop crying all the time over being hurt. You do not need him, he needs you (who's jobless?).   The way he is talking to you is unacceptable and now you have a baby to worry about how it affects. This is a really bad show. Luckily, you are not married. I wish you luck, but this is really bad.|`|HhaadKixaa	Well he sounds like the typical young MALE. I'm sorry he's been treating you the way he has. People deal with stress in there life in different ways. Maybe he's just choosing to brush this situation under the rug and hope it goes away.. Wrong! You have a lil' one on the way and he sounds like he's acting like a child himself. You're a strong Woman  I'm sure and the fact that he doesn't even hold down a stable job is a big signal that you can basically do this on your own. Not that that's a recommendation but if he's not even bring-in in the income than what is his role going to be beside Dad. At this point he should want to provided for his expectant family. I would be strong and act like it doesn't faze you. The more you complain about it, it will just push him farther away. Men or in this case a man-child always want what they cant have. So play the independent role, like you don't need him. If he truly loves you he'll come around. Especially when the baby comes. He wont have a choice in supporting it financially. but lets hope he'll be there emotionally as well for the both of you... Good Luck!|`|Lr0eB6sSaa	talk to him and tell him when this baby comes things have to change tell him he really has to be around more and whats gonna happen when you cant work, and after you have bub ,<br>  id say you (your bf) has to work out what he is doing does he want this baby is he gonna help look after the baby and ask him whos  more important his friends or you and the baby<br>  i know its hard sweetie but his got to step up alittle <br>  congratz and i hope everything works out for you<br>  and good luck, hope i helped xx|`|Ri2I8Ofuaa	hey =) just like 2 say omg!!!!! im 19 and im goin thru the exact same thing =( i hardly eva see my bf n when i do its at like 2 am!!!! coz he says his m8s are more important :\ .....i try talkin to him but he neva wants to talk. i talk to my best m8 alot and that really helps to have some one there u can trust and lean on...i dnt no wot id do with out her. some times i get depressd to but thats probly down to hormones. im also around 10 weeks found out for sure on wednesday! u i dnt reli have an ansa for u but wanted u to no ur not alone =) chin up and just think about ur baby that always helps me xxxx|`|ahDUOe48aa	i know how you feel he is a jerk he should be working an you should be relaxing. an he isnt showing you any compassion coming in after 3. maybe he has another babymother out there, or girlfriend he is a acting real messed up. i would ignore him an give him attitude and just avoide him and leave without telling him and give him a taste of his medicine and see if he really cares|`|avkZGv1taa	Well--its hard to say... you might just be feeling especially upset due to hormones--but personally I would be pretty PO'd as well!  I can't stand it when people (guys or girls) think they can get away with not working when there partner is working their a** off!  It's really your decision whether or not you want to keep him around.  The first trimester is probably when you need his love and support the most!  That's when I was feeling my worst and needing comfort--I'm fine now, just huge!  You can get him some resources explaining the hormonal and physical changes your body is going through right now and maybe he will understand better how you are feeling.  I hate to be a downer--but I'd drop him... the last thing you need is a boyfriend (and babys father) who thinks his own social life is more important than your emotional and physical well-being.|`|drOXfPM6aa	I would leave him. If he is man enough he would take care of his responsiblities and get a job so you can stay home during your pregnancy. My partner and I are the same age and he works hard while I stay home. During the begginging he did go out more often but, I did not mind because I knew once the baby came there would be less time to go out. Honestly I would give him 2 weeks to get a job and if he does not leave.|`|fJ7OeopSaa	My relationship used to be exactly like this except it was once my daughter was born. the way he used to act made me very ill. I think he could be rebelling because once you have kids you generally don't go off with your mates all the time because you have to  be there for your family. This is the explanation my boyfriend gave me when we talked about the way he used to behave. It does not last forever but it is very stressful, you need to sit down and speak to him, tell him how he is making you feel. But from what you say it does not sound like he respects you or is likely to listen. If he truly wants to be with you, you need to give him a wake up call. Now that you are pregnant he probably thinks that he can do what he likes and you won't argue with him incase you are scared that you will split up. He is in a very powerful position, with my ex bf it seemed like when i cried and begged him not to go out/come home he enjoyed it because he was dominating the relationship, so try not to show you are upset. Maybe if you went and stayed with a friend or relative for  few days, it might make him think about what he is doing to you. If he is doing anything wrong, you knowing about it will not stop him, if he is going to do anything he will do it. You need to sort this out asap because the stress is not good for your pregancy. Remember that if you want to you can do this on your own, you don't need this stress. Try talking to him and if that does not work have a few days away from him, that way you will be able to think things through. But if nothing is resolved you need to get away from him. Good luck and hope this has helped x|`|fTd509Qzaa	he is a loser, was this pregnancy planned?  Seems like he wants nothng to do with it.  he doesn't have a job, how is he supposed to help you raise the baby?  Kick him to the curb if he can't man up and take responsibility.

Then it's gonna be all on you and that's not right. He's not doing right by you at all and im sorry your going through that. Best thing to do is to leave him alone.

Eventually he will start associating that no means get away from whatever i am at. When he learns right from wrong, then swatting his hands is a feasible punishment.|`|397b528338dbd9036ae6de0f84b8f817aa	by swatting his hand you are teaching him to hit when he doesnt like what someone is doing. a simple "no" and give him a toy to play with should work at his age.|`|tkSXjqhuaa	I did at 3 months. He's now 5 months.<br>  He pulls my hair sometimes, and I just gently take his hand away and say "noooo" in a tone.|`|XD42367paa	At this age, distraction works better in some cases. The time when I started saying no was when my kids were more mobile and starting to climb up onto things and steps and getting into things that weren't for them. I would say "no stairs" or no whatever, take them away, put them somewhere else and distract them. If they were bent on the steps or whatever, I just kept repeating the word and the action until they stopped. Some little ones are more persistent, but they will get it eventually, usually not without a lot of crying and broken hearted tears, ;-) but they will.|`|tLGbtmGsaa	I just say NOOOOO in a very stearn voice. My twins get it and they stop what they are doing.  When they know that they have done something wrong they usually start to cry or pull a lip. My heart melts and I feel so bad for telling them off that I just want to pick them and cuddle them.   I started to tell them No when they turned 12 months.|`|EeGgovyCaa	Swatting the hand isn't going to teach him anything, especially at that age. They don't know any better.<br>  <br>  sometimes even saying no isn't going to work, you need to redirect them. Take whats in their hand and give them a toy. Pull them away from things.|`|YCJz2DiWaa	I think swatting his hand is probably going to teach him that swatting is acceptable. <br>  He really shouldn't be getting into too much trouble seeing how he's only been in the world for 7.5 months, and needs guidance versus scolding.|`|dqSA7j7gaa	I am with you, i think if you keep it up...he will get it! He will understand I cannot do that! Im sure many people will say you are wrong....its YOUR kid. I am with you.|`|HqOkC2YHaa	I think you should wait till he's older. At 7.5 months old they can't really comprehand between right and wrong to him it could just be a game that the 2 of you are playing|`|nKXTjqQWaa	This is to early for discipline. Distract him with other things. He's looking at you like he don't get it becuase he don't.|`|P0Fjh59Eaa	If by discipline you count saying "No!" in a firm voice then i'd say about 6 months for all my kids. That's when they were scooting around the house learning to crawl. <br>  <br>  Course i baby proofed my house to the point of insanity with my younger children because my first child broke me in! If they can reach it, it's too low... period and should be moved. <br>  My 1 y/o son (17 mths), actually will go get a toy that he uses to stand on so he can get to things!! They are smart cookies. I tell him NO in a firm voice, take the toy that he stood on and put it where he can't have it back. he gets upset but he's learning (just like my other 3 kids) that if you misbehave or get into things you're not suppose to you lose something. Other times when he or my 3 yr old daughter get into things they aren't suppose to i redirect their attention. there is really no need to get physical w/discipline when it comes to babies reaching for things they truly don't understand will hurt them. <br>  <br>  My daughter was 2.5 before we started using time outs. she had to sit on her bed for at leat 1 min. which for a 2.5 yr old is a very long time. but she understands enough now to know better.<br>  my 1 y/o on the other hand is just exploring his world around him and he needs my guidance to understand what is okay and not okay instead of my constant hitting...which truly doesn't teach them anything at this age.<br>  <br>  honestly i've not spanked my children very much at all...that is reserved for the most offensive of behaviors, and even then sometimes i can come up w/a punishment that is far worse than a spanking. My oldest son (who is 13) for instance stole 2 checks out of my purse last year because he wanted to eat lunch at his school instead of the sack lunch i made him...i couldn't believe that the school actually took them, considering my signature was not on the checks, but as punishment for violating my privacy by going through my purse my husband dumped all his things onto his bedroom floor off his selves and out of his closet to show him how it feels to have your things messed with. AND then he went on a ride along w/a cop friend of ours to see what happens to people that steal. <br>  he's been fabulous since, something i doubt a spanking would have done esp at his age. he'd have just shurg it off.|`|L8dPZtxBaa	It is probably not best to swat his hand yet unless he is doing something to put himself or someone else in danger.  I believe in spanking a child.  But I also believe that their must be a good reason to do so.  My good reasons are if he is doing something to hurt himself of someone else.  When you pop a baby it just reinforces that it is okay to punish with harm.  When you use positive redirection and a reward system (even if the reward is just praise) it builds a loving respectful relationship.  Also, explain why you don't want him to do something.  Using I because statements is usually easier for babies to understand.  Ex..  I don't want you to touch that because you could get hurt. I hope this helps.|`|qKEKLOaEaa	I started using the word 'no' with my daughter at about 11 months. She doesn't quite get it yet, in fact half the time she laughs at me. However, I still say a firm no to her anytime she is doing something that she shouldn't be. At some point the meaning will sink in, you just have to be consistent about it. 7.5 months may be a little young, maybe wait until at least 10 months or so.|`|nFE6T6Hgaa	At his age I'd just redirect or distract him. Move whatever he is trying to get if you can or lock it. We have to put a chair next to our recliner or Jax (my 10 month old) will crawl back there and pull the lamp off and play with things he shouldn't. Now that he's a little older I say no and he cries but goes right back to doing it! I even tugged on his hair because he's a terrible hair puller and it hurts! He stopped doing that. I was Amazed!|`|4Qb1FNH2aa	Discipline and baby should not be in the same sentence, please listen to everyone who talked about distraction as the answer and then maybe (and I am not trying to be condescending, you are allowed to not know everything) get a book on babies and toddlers.|`|f4HsyUfQaa	I started when he was about 3 months old. he's almost 6 now, and does really well for a boy with autism.|`|oXIYHsDaaa	He's to young to understand why you are swatting his hand, at this point and for the next year in a bit at least the most important rule is "if it shouldn't be touched, it shouldn't be out" if there are things he shouldn't have then it's your job to make sure he can't get them plain and simple he doesn't have the cognitive ability to understand punishment. Kids are usually able to grasp time outs as discipline by the time they are 2 - 3 but all swatting his hand will ever teach him is that it's ok to swat people's hands, at least it's ok if you're the bigger person.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	he is too young to understand no- smakcing him for something he doesn't understand is wrong- i wouldn't smack my son who is 22 months- closer to 18 months is when he got the point of time out for about 1 minute. but it's not fair to have things out that he can't touch. you need to make your house baby proof<br>   we use to have a glass table with picture on it and such- when my son began pulling it we moved it to the basement which is an adult zone for us.

They aren't bad for you, just be sure to include a balance of other foods as well!|`|2ZOkyoSJaa	I think os, but I hope that if you start having weirder cravings (like for dirt, or chalk)  that you speak to your doctor. You may be lacking something in your diet.|`|xnhwmontaa	I do! LOL I craved them the other day!|`|XD42367paa	Me too! I craved them alot during my last pregnancy. I wonder though if you shouldn't ask your doc about pica. It's a condition that preggo women can get where they crave dirt or laundry detergent ( no lie, it really is!) and is an indication of missing some nutirents in your diet. While I don't think craving raw potato is bad, it might be that 'dirt' thing you're really after. <br>  <br>  I'd ask, just in case, particularly if your raw potato doesn't satisfy.|`|hVVALFAPaa	I am not a nutritionist, but I think it would be fine. <br>  <br>  Wash them well and make sure you do not eat them if they are green.<br>  <br>  BTW: have you ever eaten frozen packaged french fries?

3imLjQlHaa	Is your husband open to adoption? If your last pregnancy was difficult, maybe he is worried about if you were to get pregnant again that it would be a similar situation. Just explore your options. You could always volunteer to babysit friends' babies to get your fix!|`|vj3WSxzWaa	I went through the same thing,,my son is now 4 and a half and we are 8 months pregnant,,,just dont be pushy,,you have time,,,let your husband enjoy being a dad to one for a bit longer,,,bring it up every now and then,but not so much to where it is overwhelming to him,because you may turn him off to the idea totally in the end that way.<br>  And when you do bring it up,don't make it all about you,,make it about your family,,about you son having a sibling,and so on.<br>  Just take some time.<br>  Good Luck!|`|GKgmyEfnaa	You said yourself "We never planned on having any kids at all", but you have a son.  I won't pretend to understand you husband's thinking (or yours) but it's important that you respect his position.  He may change his mind in time - your son is only 2 and quite possibly a bit of a handful at times.  Perhaps wait until your son is older and your husband has developed a really strong bond with him before you raise the issue again.  Whatever you do - don't nag him.  He probably knows how you feel, but doesn't want to discuss the topic.  You first obligation is to love and respect your husband.  Do that and the likelihood of him agreeing to another child grows.  I hope you do have another child, but it has to be a child you both want.  There would be few things worse than your husband resenting the child's existence!|`|Tx991ij5aa	It's very important to get a clear understanding as to why your husband is so stern on the baby issue. Is it financial? Does he feel like he is already fulfilled with his parental situation as it is? Maybe he feels that he can't/isn't able to share the love? <br>  <br>  There is a reason. If there was never any discussion on children prior to conception of your son he may already be ovewhelmed with the family of 3. <br>  <br>  Understanding the desire that you have to conceive I too have the same issue, but with the reverse problem. We both would love to have children, but after 4 miscarriages we've decided against trying again too soon. Seems that each miscarriage sucks more and more life out of me/him. The stress factor is out of control when it comes to children.<br>  <br>  Sometimes its just best to have a hard conversation in order to make your feelings known and be considerate to his feelings.
m9f9xWCEaa	The only real option you have is to rush and get that pill (morning after, plan B, emergency contraceptive) AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. If it happened today, that is perfect. You can use it up to 72 hours after unprotected sex, but it works best when used right away. <br>  This is the only method that's out there right now. Call up your family doctor or local Planned Parenthood clinic. They will help you acquire Plan B.<br>  If you want to make sure that she doesn't get pregnant from this accident, act quickly. And look into additional methods of birth control (your gf probably should start using the pill).<br>  Good luck. Everything should be fine.|`|drOXfPM6aa	The only thing that works is Plan B. You can get is over the counter if you are 18 or older. If you are younger you could go to your schools heath office and they may have it there free.|`|xFnC8tZaaa	The only way to avoid pregnancy at all costs is to abstain completely!<br>  <br>  Your partner has 72 hours to get and take the morning after pill but even then it's not 100% guaranteed, but no method is.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|X0f444TOaa	Plan B - I had to buy it not too long ago and it cost me about $50.00 at CVS.  If you're not over 18, you'll need a perscription to buy it.|`|YAiKlPkMaa	Some women douche, that may help.|`|6e58ce6577be3f4549253fc7148b5e1caa	In order to prevent pregnancy right now your only thing to do is go get plan b.  Which can be purchase from Walgreen's for about $50.00.  But you have to be over the age of 18 to get it and it is only effective up to 72 hours after having unprotected sex.  If you are younger than that you will need to go to planned parenthood.  But there is nothing else you can do and if you wait passed the 72 hours and you do not want the baby abortion, keep the baby or adoption are the other options.|`|HPRlEWu1aa	plan b is a pill u can by  at any poharmacy if ure ver 18 .. if not ull have to get a prescribtion from either a doctor or a local planned parenthod may prescibe it to u, f they dont have it, but most wll have t in stock at the clinic. they work up to 72 hrs of unproteted sex|`|2l7lbcJWaa	The morning after pill (Plan B) is the only thing you can do.

SRzswqTeaa	If they check you and you are 5cm, they may do one of two things:  Hook you up to a monitor in the office , and see if you are having contractions, or ask you if you are having contractions 'now'.  Some doctors will send you  up to be monitored.  Some hospitals will STILL send you home at 5cm, if you are not contracting.  It depends on your doctor, and what the hospital policies are.  I've walked around 5cm for a couple of weeks - and with one of my pregnancies.. I was 4 cm when I walked into the hospital, had contractions 10 minutes apart for 3 hours, dilated to 5cm, contracted for two more hours with no progress and was SENT home!!  Had baby two weeks later :-)|`|rjVALevtaa	Nope. Anything past 4 cm is considered active labor. I doubt they would send you home. Also, it's unlikely that a woman dilated to 5 cm would only have occasion contractions.|`|crw44vnRaa	At 5 cm your considered in early stages of labor weather your contracting or not, but they MIGHT still send you home if they think your not progressing very fast. If that was the case I would stay close to the hospital and walk or do something to help pass the time, often times when you get back home is just when your body starts to get moving, and most dont live five minutes from the hospital.|`|e33QAXShaa	I was dilated to a 4 for several weeks, no contractions with my 1st and was sent home on brethine pills because I was only about 30wks. She was born at 37wks when my water broke.
5824744e4ab4fcfafc968e00935b02e5aa	my daughter is now 16 months but when she was around that age shes liked her bath time same time ever night but i tied her in one of those duck tubs and she HATES it . and when you go to rinse her hair she wants out . if water gets in her eyes|`|MvC6n3DWaa	This will probably pass. It sounds like you are doing everything right: checking the water temp, making part of a routine, providing toys and I am sure that you are being pleasant and interacting with him. Just proceed as you have and it may go away as quickly as it arrived.|`|EeGgovyCaa	Oh mine too. My DS likes the bath, my DD hates it and like yours she will scream the whole time. Like her, I make sure the temp is okay. Not too cold, not too hot. I give her toys to play with.<br>  <br>  She doesn't like it when I have to pour water on her head. when I have to rinse her hair. <br>  <br>  Only when her brother can be in the bath with her is when she's okay and will enjoy it.|`|66633d9122b3aa8042ed5b75071a98d0aa	My 9month baby girl started being afraid of the water, so I would put toys in to keep her busy. We have to carry her the whole time, so she knows we're holding her. I think its because they realize that its different then sitting and playing
q4WtQvSZaa	I'm no lawyer but I would guess that until the baby is born the mothers rights are the most important in law, so she gets to decide what procedures she wants to go through.  Once the baby is born then the baby becomes the most important, and so both parents have an equal say in what happens.|`|AA11845638	It's because the father doesn't have to pay child support to terminate a pregnancy.  Also, if this woman is single or isn't ready for the baby, this is her own decision on what to do.  This doesn't affect the father until after a baby is born.  As for adoption, if the woman is married, the husband needs a consent to say he's willing to take care of this baby with his wife.  If the woman is single, she'll need to file adoption papers on her own.<br>  <br>  In conclusion, both situation relates to money.|`|JYgJD0Rwaa	I agree completely. The father should have to sign over his parental rights to the child whether the mother decides on adoption or abortion. It makes no sense as to why the father does not have to be notified when the baby is about to be terminated, however he has to be notified when the child will be given away for a family to raise?<br>  Maybe because most men would refuse to sign over their rights to allow an abortion, which would reduce the number of abortions, which would lead to more people discussing how wrong it is, then people would realize that it is wrong and the laws may change..... you see where I'm going.|`|e44b7050fb792247b231f218559774e8aa	It makes 100% perfect sense. A women should have the complete choice of giving birth or getting an abortion since it is her body. <br>  <br>  After birth her body is no longer in play. So if a man wants to raise the child and she doesn't he should be given that option and is given that option. Adoption has nothing to do with a women's reproductive rights. <br>  <br>  A man should not be able to decide if a woman gives birth or not, but he should be able to disown it if she decides to give birth and he doesn't want it. That is a law that is lacking and needs to be changed.|`|Q0xm1Kodaa	I think that people think when a woman is pregnant that it is hers. She has to go through with all the changes in her body and after wards. But if she is willing to give the baby up than the father has a right to raise the baby. I don't think it is far. I understand that the woman has to go through all of it emotional and physically but i think that the father should have a choice. That's just me though.|`|AI2VoFP4aa	well youre actually not very accurate here. you dont need a paternal signature to give up a child if the fathers name is not on the birth certificate. all someone would have to do is say they dont know who the dad is.|`|Hx0a0Q8Uaa	In the state of California the only time a father's consent is need for adoption is when he is on the birth certificate or they are married.|`|i9M0U9Meaa	i agree, i think if a women gets an abortion they should have to have the fathers consent, unless of course it was rape or incest.|`|ikpKEqIlaa	Because whether it's the way you see it or not, when it's an abortion it's not involving an actual living baby.  Abortion is about a woman's right to choose what to do with her body.  It's about the woman, not a baby.  Adoption is about a baby, not the woman.  And I'm not so sure the father's signature is needed.  The woman could say she doesn't know who the father is, so unless a man comes forward claiming rights to the child, they don't search the Earth for the bio dad before baby can go for adoption.|`|nPHJndGOaa	I never once thought of that! You are absolutely right! I don't think that's fair at all. I think in a case which a couple is married, then it is ok to say both parents need to consent, but in cases where the father has no legal obligation to stick around and can skip town, I think it should be legal for the MOTHER to give up the baby.<br>  <br>  I know of situations where the mother kept the baby because the father wouldn't give up his rights, but also wouldn't take the baby. Where he does it JUST to make the womans life difficult.|`|cmnf6Oukaa	when a man has to push a giant baby out of his penis and get all the fun stuff along with pregnancy then he can give consent for an abortion.|`|f9lZK2aKaa	I agree, it does not make sense.<br>  God Bless!|`|qk9jBnSPaa	for adoption = Incase he wants to raise the baby himself|`|lA0PNkchaa	No it does not, but I think there are some ways to get around it.  Have you found an agency?|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	I agree...I guess they do it that way because unless they were to do an amio during pregnancy there is no way to know who the real dad is but after birth all it takes is a swab with spit on it. So basically if they required dad's signature for an abortion the mom could have any old man sign even if he really isn't the dad.|`|uuHPneEcaa	that is how things are. I think abortion is wrong so I am not going to get on that subject. (that is my opinion). I guess they need concent from the father when there is an adoption taking place because he may want the child u know.  but the abortion thing is its her body she can do whatever she wants to do with it. <br>  <br>  but that is a good question|`|6031158203543764081e8a70cf2cc2edaa	First, abortion is a pregnancy decision.  Only the person who is pregnant may make the decision.  Second, adoption is a parenting decision.  Because 2 people typically are considered the parents, you need both of them to waive their rights to the child once it does actually exist.  <br>  <br>  I'll break this down further.  A Woman who becomes pregnant must decide for herself whether to remain pregnant and give birth or whether to obtain an abortion.  Because it is Her body that will take the risks associated with pregnancy, it is solely her decision whether to undertake those risks.  This is why a Woman does not need permission to obtain an abortion.  If you force Women to obtain the consent of a man before an abortion, you are basically devaluing a Woman's body and her rights to her body.  Because no one else owns her body but herself, She is the only one who may make that decision.<br>  <br>  However, when she chooses to remain pregnant and take the risks of pregnancy and childbirth, she is also choosing to make herself and another a parent.  Both of these people, at that point, have to decide whether they want to be a parent or not.  This is why, if a Woman seeks an adoption, the man must be given a chance to decide whether he wants to take on the total responsibility of his child or if he wants to relinquish his own rights.  <br>  <br>  Basically, the only person who may choose an abortion is the only person who is pregnant because pregnancy only has risks to the person who is pregnant.  However, after a child is born, there are two people who are parents and both must be asked whether they agree to an adoption or not.  <br>  <br>  I hope this has helped.<br>  Peace,<br>  Jenn|`|1G3XPiq3aa	Because it's her body she's making that choice over, and because it's not easy to prove paternity while she's pregnant. <br>  <br>  If she has the baby regardless, then the father should be allowed to decide if the baby is adopted out to strangers or not. It's no longer anything to do with her if he wants to parent his child if she doesn't.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	she needs his approval for adoption incase he would prefer to raise baby himself or decides on open adoption. a father has no rights over an unborn unfortunately|`|0nIwKd5Uaa	If that's the only thing that doesn't make sense to you on female reproductive rights count yourself lucky.
c490676d02a8b133e7a6143969ba0116aa	No it's not a bad sign! I strongly advise you to do your best not to over think every twitch and toot or you'll drive yourself nuts! Your bloating and cramps were because the injections cause your ovaries to grow as big as grapefruits. That is bound to give you a little bloating and cramps! They are no longer being stimulated and so your symptoms have stopped. Plus, your retrieval can cause bloating and cramping and it can take a few days to subside. I have gone through 4 IVF cycles. My last one was the only pregnancy (Ended in a rare missed miscarriage). To be honest, for all cycles sometimes I felt nothing and sometimes had pregnancy symptoms. The progesterone you are on can mimic pregnancy symptoms. I really didn't start having pregnancy symptoms until I was 5 weeks. That's is when enough hCG is in your system to cause true symptoms. With that said, do not give any symptoms or non-symptoms a second thought!<br>  <br>  Hoping your embie(s) has snuggled in!

wkd5CMNaaa	I used a test from the Dollar Store. <br>  I think the clear blue digitals are shitty, because they are digital they require more HCG to show a positive. <br>  <br>  And personally, I don't believe in the whole meaning behind dreams thing, so Im not help there.|`|zBz10IiOaa	i used $ store and ept digital they both worked for me|`|6d6GHChPaa	I bought an EPT multi-test kit. Two were the +/- tests and one was digital. I took all 3 and got positives.|`|xnhwmontaa	I had the hospital test me with my urine it was negative. then the next day i went and got a first response.....popped up positive right away! Good Luck|`|AA12395149	I had a dream that I had a positive pregnancy test, and that morning, I did!<br>  <br>  The cheap pregnancy tests are just as good as the expensive ones.  The ones you can buy at the dollar store are similar to the one we use in the ER!  False negatives may be from user error.  Next time you try one, urinate in a cup, rather than on the stick.  Then, dip the end of the stick into the urine and hold it there for about 15 seconds.  Next, lie it on a flat surface and leave alone for the time it needs to develop (most need about 3 minutes).|`|yTuBS2hbaa	I paid a dollar for some off the wall brand at the Dollar Tree, and then I went to the Health Department and had them test me. I figured there was no point in wasting a lot of money if it might be a no. It was a yes.<br>  <br>  I've heard that about death dreams as well. I don't remember having any crazy dreams early on in the pregnancy, but as it progressed, they did get a bit crazier and more vivid. But I read that you seem to dream more when you're pregnant because you're actually awake more often to remember them. I had probably close to 5 or 6 very vivid and odd dreams the other night, and I remembered them cause I kept waking up, needing to pee. I am currently about 33 weeks along.|`|dR2bqUixaa	My mom believes the same thing. When I took my first pregnancy test I had a VERY faint positive where you could barely tell. So I took one the next morning, the first time I peed in the morning, and there it was... POSITIVE!!!! If I was you I would take anotherone in the morning and see if it has a positive. Good luck!|`|445676ee4ba9ef6e5bd44f0f3b9d7501aa	I used first response and clear blue digital.<br>  <br>  Alot about the accuracy has to deal with WHEN you are testing...most people test too early, or not doing it first thing in the morning like the directions suggest.<br>  <br>  I didn't have any weird dreams or anything.|`|EDiJe38Taa	Dollar Tree|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	walmart brand EPT|`|SRzswqTeaa	I buy my tests over the internet.  I like the Aimsticks.  They have a high HCG sensitivity ( of 20 mIU/ml and greater), so they can detect pregnancy pretty early.  (As long as baby has implanted of course!)  I also like the price!  Sure you have to pee in a cup or something and dip the stick, but at less than a buck a piece, you just can't beat that!  They do have the kind you can pee on the stick, but they are a bit more in price.  Good luck :-D

People will expect that you needed some time to adjust to a new baby before having it together enough to throw a party.  And if anyone wonders why you waited so long, tell them you wanted to wait for your son to be able to smile at all his new friends :P<br>  <br>  I hope your party is the welcome you pictured your son having!|`|BExscPOtaa	I would be so sad and bitter too!  I feel frustrated for you!  it's so sad that other people in his family couldn't get over their jealousy to be happy for you want to celebrate your baby.  too often people let their own selfishness and pity get in the way of everything, it's pathetic.  I know what's like to be on that side too!  it took my husband and I a year and a half to get pregnant each time, and it was heartbreaking to see all of our friends and family members expecting.  but it never stopped us from being happy for them and going to their baby showers!  I honestly don't know what you should do...I almost think if you DO decide to have a party soon, you should only invite close friends and family who have not caused you to feel this bitterness.  you don't need to bend over backwards for people like that...they need to come to you and apologize for making things awkward and hurtful.  anyway, to be honest...I think it is too late for any kind of party that would serve as anything like a baby shower in your mind...I don't think there's anything that can take that bitterness away now.  :(  I think you'll just have to find a way to somehow let it go, and fill the baby books with all of the things you and your husband did and bought for the baby.  A welcome baby party is still a great idea though!  I'm just saying I don't think it will take the place of a baby shower in your mind.  <br>  I'm still so sad for you though...and frustrated that people let their selfishness ruin everything for other people.  I'm sorry...and I hope you can somehow let it go so it doesn't eat away at you forever.  your baby won't care that he never got a shower...all he cares about is the love he gets from you guys now.  best wishes to you!!|`|obN6p3Cgaa	so sorry to hear about  this thing that is causing you to be so stress throw yourself that shower and just continue to pray and trust God when family fail God never fail us be strong for your baby blessings in abundant to you and your baby......|`|8DnIXwnyaa	What about making a trip home to your family and asking you mom if she would throw a little party for you guys so all your friends back home could meet your son.  Then you can show him off to the people who you are close to.  A party with people who you dont like isnt fun anyway.  <br>  <br>  Call it a Welcome party or something.
7SKVCPcSaa	Patrick. <br>  <br>  it sounds good AND its your husbands name! and you like it..<br>  <br>  so no more answers after this one... I've solved the riddle!|`|pxhS7ol6aa	Damien Brody. Definitely the best. And congratulations :]|`|KOcCenrEaa	2. Damien Riley|`|o9Ckf0h4aa	1 it is!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|01a19d2b8982bebcfca1b5520fa5d1e1aa	I liked Patrick the best before I read your notation, that it was your husbands name.    The syllables have a nice flow to them <br>  <br>  Damien Riley does too, but Im not keen on the Riley name.<br>  Both have a soft sound. <br>  <br>  Damien Brody.. has too much boldness, in the sound of saying Brody.. it overshadows the Damien name.   Like a THUD. <br>  Say it, & you'll see what I mean. The Damien is nearly forgotten, as Brody is so forceful.|`|61NKzPzMaa	Damien is a great name. I really love this name however I would spell it Damian.<br>  <br>  I like both Damien Patrick & Damien Riley. I prefer the name Patrick but I think Damien Riley flows better.|`|LU96bnCdaa	Patrick|`|GZn5VNlSaa	Damien Patrick!!!  lovely choice!!

2irmTjQ3aa	I do and I am 34 weeks. You can use whatever you like and there is no time limit, but make sure the water is warm and not hot.|`|p2Njf5gBaa	Yes,  I took bathes all the time towards the end of my pregnancy,  it was so relaxing and felt great on my back.  <br>  <br>  I have heard not too take too hot of bathes,,  but warm is just fine.  You can use any bubble bath you enjoy.  Something moisturizing with an enjoyable sent would be the most relaxing.|`|IFDfpbFJaa	I wouldn't get anything with too much fragrance in it. Be careful not to make the water too hot and also make sure your tub is clean so no nastyness or mildew gets inside you and causes an infection.|`|84b26tbzaa	use a mild bubble bath and you should be able to stay in the tub as long as you want just make sure the water is not too hot and please ask for help to get out of the tub if you need it|`|vWb8fquvaa	My OB says no. You need to talk to your doctor about this. Overheating the baby is the issue with baths. Unless you want to take a luke warm bath, which doesnt sound relaxing at all!|`|1z3C0R2Vaa	Yes it is safe just use mild  bubbles soap good luck..........)|`|7pl5QLqCaa	The thing that matters is the heat of the water. I was told hot tubs- 15 minutes MAX by my midwife... so I think it would be the same for a hot bath too... however, since baths cool naturally as long as you aren't adding hot water to the tub, as long as you are comfortable in the bath should be fine, especially if you have a normal small bathtub-- your belly will be sticking out of the water anyways!<br>  <br>  As for what to make bubbles with, I dunno, probably what you'd usually use should be fine.|`|rDw9N09iaa	you can take bubble baths as long as the water is warm and not hot. it really doesnt matter how long you stay in the tub though. and you can use like dish soap [lol], bubble bath, shampoo, etc. to make the bubbles.
BARCjDhnaa	Both it can be too soon or it could be your body wait a couple of days and test again the HGC levels increase every day and if it was late in your cycle when you got pregnant then it could just be that it is not high enough for the test to detect.|`|kjjAfcxBaa	its a mind trick trust me|`|VYxZ0gSkaa	Honestly there are many different answers to this question ; if you & him have had sex then it is possible that you (may) be pregnant [cause for the missed period] but another answer could just be that you are irregular (as am I) and will soon be getting your menstrual. But don't stress it - because the more you do the more your mind will play tricks on you.|`|ki0yOklRaa	i think your stressing over it too much and its causing your period to be late
1yC1tyeAaa	Phoebe.. Very original and uncommon! :) You definetly wouldn't find a bunch of Phoebes in a school! <br>  <br>  The most common spelling of Alison is Allison. I prefer spelling it as Allyson :)|`|VHHis05Naa	Spunky, I love it!<br>  <br>  I'd spell it Alison or Allison.|`|Z6NlNRLoaa	Phoebe isn't very pretty soundng, but Allison is fine.|`|qitXGd0qaa	I like it. I prefer Allison or Allyson- I like the name having 2 L's.|`|8uvb3Nroaa	Phoebe is cute. I would spell it "Allison" but it's a nice combination either way.|`|syrh8J6Vaa	I actually like it the other way around Allyson Phoebe|`|KOcCenrEaa	it's cute.<br>  <br>  I spell it like this Allyson.<br>  <br>  My cousin has the name and spells it like Allison.|`|7uznrLBXaa	Allison or Alison. Please, no "y"!  It's a bit trashy.  <br>  <br>  I've always liked the name Phoebe.  Not a favorite, but I do like it.  Plus, it flows nicely with Allison.  Good job!|`|I1ZAEmLsaa	well me personally dont like the name phoebe neither the otha one, but if u asking me spell like alison.<br>  why shud u make it complicated, u know.|`|EEzrCadFaa	I like Alyson. But not Pheobe. Maybe Alyson Pheobe?
ebM6CxRQaa	I had a migraine for over 36 hours. I couldn't sleep or do anything.. plus I have a real little one to take care of. I called my ob/gyn and they prescribed Fiorcet for me. It worked in 5 mins! I was hesitant to take it... but they assured me taking it occasionally was better than the stress I was putting on the baby being in that much pain. <br>  <br>  THINGS TO TRY OTHER THAN MEDS:<br>  * lights off warm bath...<br>  * take a nap<br>  * juice carrots<br>  ****Take a spoonful of magnesium**** Magnesiumm is actually a homeopathic remedy for headaches and really does work.|`|AA12395149	This is something that really needs to be discussed with your doctor or midwife.  Anything like bad head aches and migraines that you didn't have before you were pregnant could mean something bigger is going on, and you need to seek medical advice.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	this can be normal because of the hormones.  inform your OB.  swim, do yoga, get a massage, and see a chiropractor.  consider altering your diet to avoid trigger foods.|`|wkd5CMNaaa	Talk to your Dr. <br>  Tylenol, sleeping it off in a dark room, cold compress on the head. <br>  Stay hydrated and eat a healthy balanced diet.|`|AA10972821	I used to get this too, my doc said it could be because of the increased blood volume in the body. I used Tylenol and then switched to Excedrin for Tension headaches (NO ASPIRIN in it like other types of Excedrin) which helped A LOT!!|`|BARCjDhnaa	Can be totally normal but it is better to get checked out, you could have high blood pressure. Good luck|`|HPRlEWu1aa	u should talk to ur doc it could be nothing or it could be a beginning of something ...try taking tylenol for now, see if that helps, maybe ure dehydrated, or dont have enought viamins ur in ur body or it could just be the hormones and the blood volume going up ... talk to ur doc for more info|`|f57HWgj3aa	if it is causing you pain then you should go see a doctor.
mhwCzSYJaa	There's no easy way. Just sit her down and let it out. She loves you. She'll help you.|`|0nIwKd5Uaa	Gay sex, leaving for mexico. now teen pregnancy. I'm not sure but wouldn't this be trolling? I mean i doubt any of your questions have been honest.|`|d6df9c3bab13d4a609d4641b785de6b0aa	5 minutes ago you posted a question in the gay and lesbian section asking which is better..boys or girls..so I don't believe this question is real.|`|zQiYKgMLaa	Bluntly.<br>  <br>  Start crying.  When your mom asks you why you're crying, just say you messed up big and you're really scared and you have no idea what you're going to do.  When she asks what you mean, tell her you're pregnant.<br>  <br>  Go watch the movie Juno.|`|t0K6Haoyaa	well maybe you need to advise her to allow you to get put on birth control from now on. You need to be honest. Sit her down, and just be HONEST. It'll be rough at first, but a baby changes everything.|`|Q0xm1Kodaa	Grow up. Stop posting things like are girls better than boys and than posting something like this.|`|wKN7n2RKaa	Real or not, this may help someone.  As a mother of a daughter who became pregnant at age 14, I can say that it was rougher for her than me.  She had agonized about it for about a month before her boyfriend had me get together with them and his mother to talk.  <br>  <br>  You might think you know how she will react, but you may not be right.  The question I would have is, how well can you and she talk?  Waiting to talk will not make the issue go away, so the sooner the better.  You need medical care regardless of what your choice will be about this pregnancy.  I bet that she loves you, and wants what is best for you.  Since you felt adult enough to have sex, be adult enough now to talk with her.  If not her, then start with another responsible grown-up and ask for help.|`|GLDZz7aWaa	Well. The first thing to understand is that your mom is probably going to be somewhat shocked when you tell her, and is going to be very worried about you and about the kid and about how she and your dad are going to pay for the kid and whether to even consider an abortion. In short, she's going to freak out.<br>  <br>  This is NOT because she's really angry at you. It's because she's going to be shocked and because she's going to think of all the things that could go wrong. (Parents do this, because they care and because they know that we, as kids, aren't mature enough to have had to deal with these issues.)<br>  <br>  Some of the things that will probably come up:<br>  - Who is the father?<br>  - Are you SURE?<br>  - How long have you known?<br>  - How long have you been having sex?<br>  - Was it your idea or his or both?<br>  This is important because if it was his idea, and he's dated someone else before he dated you, he may have had sex with them too. This means you could be at risk for an STD, which sucks and could hurt your baby.<br>  <br>  - Are you going to keep it?<br>  This is something that you should think over for several days at least. Realise that unless you are a ridiculously mature kid - and you probably aren't the exception to the rule - you are not old enough to balance raising a kid with your schooling and maybe a job. Which means your parents will probably be doing most of the raising. This is NOT something you can really avoid if you keep the kid, because your parents have more experience than you and probably have a better idea of how to raise a kid and balance other responsibilities.<br>  <br>  When you tell your mom, there are several things you should do.<br>  <br>  First, do not spring it on your mom all sudden-like. Don't try to make light of the issue. This is not a joke and it is going to change your life, probably for the better, if you handle it right.<br>  <br>  So sit down with your mom in a quiet place and tell her that you need her help. You and [Baby's father] have been having sex for [however long] and you were careful but not careful enough. And now you're pregnant OR you think you're pregnant [depending on whether your period stopped or you have actually used a pregnancy test] and you need help and advice.<br>  <br>  Your mom is going to freak out at this point. That's okay. DON'T yell at her. DON'T try to give excuses ("we used a condom!" really isn't the right thing to say right now, although "I thought you couldn't get pregnant at my age" might be okay). DON'T try to argue with your mom if she says "Your boyfriend is no good, he did this!" (Your mom isn't right, because you and your boyfriend both did the deed. But right now, your mom is hurting because she suddenly has to imagine her little girl as an adult - and at age 14 that just isn't possible. Compare high school seniors to middle schoolers; they aren't the same and no amount of wishing will change that.)<br>  <br>  You should stay in school and you should tell your mom that you're going to do so. The best thing for you to do is to get an education so you can develop the skills and knowledge you'll need later. Also, if you don't, it is easy to start blaming the kid even though it isn't his/her fault. This is lame and a poor way for any child to grow up.<br>  <br>  And you should ask for advice. Your mom is still going to be freaking out for a while, and yelling and generally not being happy. This is NORMAL so just try to stay calm while she does so. (This will probably happen later when she tells your dad. But hopefully by that point your mom and you will have talked things over and she'll be on your side.)<br>  <br>  After your mom has calmed down a bit, she will probably start making plans. How much money your family has, whether or not you will keep the kid - if so, are there local parenting classes you can take in the evenings? Are you taking all the right vitamins? Have you seen the doctor recently (which you should, right away, if you're going to keep it)? - and if not, whether you're going to carry to term and then give the kid up for adoption, or if you're going to have an abortion.<br>  <br>  Whether the father is a part of your life or not is another problem. If he is mature enough to deal with it, you should try to stick with him and he should (ideally) try to stick with you. "Dealing with it" means telling his parents, talking to you and to your mom and dad, staying in school, staying out of trouble (out of jail etc). If he flakes - "Not my fault! Not my problem!" then he's a wuss and a coward and an immature jerk, but he's also NOT someone you want to keep in your life. Or your kid's life, should you decide to keep and raise it.<br>  <br>  The father's parents will also play a large role in raising the kid. (Ideally. God knows this may not happen; they may not care.) They may be able to help with hospital bills or with cost of living, but you should realize that they may not have much money. And if the father is your age, he probably doesn't have money either. It's a big enough "cost," as it were, to help raise a kid|`|sfauA3QUaa	14 is a young age to be pregnant and i understand the fear that you are feeling.. but just sit her down and talk to her about..u made a grown up decision so make the decision to be a grown up and talk about to her..face to face..all alone... or you could write a letter and tell her if you aren't that good at breaking news to people|`|46PSDx1raa	all you have to do is tell her. its going to be hard and shes probably going to get angry but the sooner you tell her the sooner you're less stressed out about having to tell her and stress can harm the baby.|`|Dujw71Muaa	Wow! Why would you have sex at that young of an age?! Good luck trying to support it... Just tell your mom exactly how you feel and she'll understand and still love you.|`|PrZPZVvqaa	you silly silly silly girl.<br>  just sit her down and tell her straight!<br>  dont leave it, yo need to tell her as soon as possible.|`|fTd509Qzaa	you are just going to have to come out with it.  The sooner the better|`|7XBoIgd6aa	Tell her that your pregnant and your scared.|`|ssXnhkn8aa	The best thing to do is probably sit her down while she isnt busy and she is in a good mood. Mothers tend to get very uneasied when they hear something like this. My cuz told her mom and she didnt freak out or anything she actually helped her. She knew her daughter was young and couldnt do this alone.<br>  Tell her you know you are young an this is probably the last thing she expected, but that you are coming to her for help bc you cant do this with out her. Tell her you love her and need her support.|`|CbYRI5h8aa	wow this must be orkward for you but you just need to be calm and handle it the right way! if your mum is the kind of person you can tlk to then just tell her about it she might jusy want you to be safe and may help you through it. or tlk to your school nurse in confidence ask her how to tell ur parents and ask her to tell ur parnetn heself. you need to make decisions about weather you keeping it or not and think about what you are goin got say! x|`|Z3mLmDaJaa	just tell her, trust me i know you will be relieved after telling her and u will feel good, dont keep it from her it will cause u stress and thats not good for you or the baby. trust me just say mum im pregnant i no from experience what its like. x good luck|`|y4jpTMsXaa	ok i cant say "i no how you feel" here but if i were u i would try and tell my mom sooner than later!! i no that its going to be hard but you have to tell her some how|`|pqw5OFRHaa	I don't know but i suggest you say it verbally before your tummy says it physically!|`|Elv6bwcQaa	get mommy drunk then tell her.<br>  or send a text.<br>  when you hear the huge scream ya know she got it.<br>  didn't she ever tell you to use a comdom.?!|`|szcAWdXKaa	Just tel her it will properly be hard but just sit her down and tell you she might be mad to begin with because your so young but shes your mother and just wants whats best for you...good luck:D|`|SZKEydttaa	just tell her im shur she will understand
VHHis05Naa	I would be annoyed.  Doesn't she have any of her own ideas?  I mean, one name the same would be one thing, but BOTH?   What a weirdo.|`|764563e236641925edbeefe032c813b3aa	No. That's like me being mad a somewhat who went out and bought the same brown shoes that I just bought. That's pretty ridiculous to me.|`|XD42367paa	I don't have friends who would name their kids Chaylon and Kaegan. <br>  <br>  I do have a daughter named Jessica and firends who named their daughter that too. No big whoop.|`|o9Ckf0h4aa	Don't bother! She'll just say she was going to say she was planning to use them first.|`|ORa2ZNAlaa	Yea. I would be mad! She basically copied you. Is she uncreative and can't think of her own names?|`|qitXGd0qaa	Well, its stupid but I don't think I'd be mad, just annoyed.|`|CF4wfTYNaa	well my mother's co worker asked her if he could name his daughter after me and really don't care i've never met her either we're 2-4 years apart. <br>  that may be because as a young kid i hated my name cause it was too big for me fill and it wasn't common , but now as an adult i am thankful i have the name i do.<br>  i just say give her the meaning so when the kids ask they'll feel like they're names have value.|`|3AfQ9UXYaa	Not really just a little annoyed.<br>  <br>  You named your kids that first so you don't have to worry about it looking like you copied the names from her.<br>  <br>  Your names sound(are spelled) better.<br>  <br>  Downside: It's a little creepy to steal BOTH names let alone one name from a friend.|`|J20qvyczaa	id be PO! cause its not a common name like "jessica" they are very uncommon and orginal. your bf has every right to be mad, if i were you i would be too ask her where she got the idea for the names from.|`|UFu0h8SKaa	yes very!  is she a bit of a stalker?

She KNOWS what your kids are already named, so why would shd do that?|`|de28048ab10e261734a9e1e41461c18aaa	i would be angry at them.. you shouldnt name all the kids the same unless they ask you first|`|I8lFqyyFaa	You probably are annoyed, considering that with those names, you expected them to be slightly unique.  You should consider it flattery, though.  Obviously she thinks you are brilliant with names, a creative intellect worth emulating, have precisely the style that most appeals to her, and she thinks your kids are lovely enough that she doesn't mind the association at all.  Explain that to your boyfriend, especially if he helped with the names.  And hope her babies are lovely enough that you don't mind the association any either.|`|7urRIYMbaa	i honestly would be a little ticked,yes.<br>  but then again, they really like your style.<br>  I think that those names are completley adorable<br>  btw.<br>  just let it go for now, bc theres nothing you can do <br>  about it.<br>  :]<br>  <br>  xoxo<br>  paige|`|ibj4lPkvaa	Yes, I'd be mad. That's so weird. Those aren't exactly common names.|`|nvaGq22Vaa	i would be! she's clearly jealous and uncreative. and her names are a little odd...|`|EEzrCadFaa	that is really stupid.|`|GgW0uGM1aa	ummm YA! id beat the **** outta da fool' she jus jelous of u and yo man havin abuncha babys.
Vi8RDbhUaa	You didn't really have to ask if she was advanced did you?  There is no reason to get her tested at this time. When she starts Kindergarten the school will do all the testing. It is likely that she will skip kindergarten and go into first grade. If she is as "socially" advanced as you say she is.  Good luck.|`|537fb036f0d7f523891b1281ae7d57d1aa	Depends, how is she on emailing and editing photos like the little girl in the microsoft commercial?|`|C2sZREuAaa	Maybe introduce to hear a musical instrument or sign her up for a soccer team.<br>  <br>  That way she can interact with children with out feeling her intelligence is in the way.|`|OHfZFR31aa	You can speak with the school district to see if she can skip kindergarten and go right into first grade. The school often has tests they can give to see if she's ready, or they can direct you to the right sources.<br>  <br>  Or start looking into schools that support gifted kids while letting them remain with other kids their own age who are also gifted.|`|fMilDRgLaa	Well, she is definitely more advanced than my four year old son. Reading and writing in cursive???  My little guy can just print the alphabet and has trouble with a couple letters still.  We are hoping to have him be able to read a few words by his 5th birthday,  I would talk to her pediatrician and it does sound like she is advanced a good bit.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	never compare.  relax and let your 4 yr old enjoy her childhood.|`|w9ssFyitaa	Oh my god yes she is writing in cursive and reading kids dont start that until 2ed and 3rd grade. she might just be a genious!!!|`|bCdik11yaa	that would be my guess. talk to her doctor at her next check up and ask them.

OBzIzElFaa	Please don't cut yourself!!! Anger is a natural, God given emotion. When you get so angry or upset, that you feel like cutting yourself, you need to start praying! God hears you and He will never leave you. If you feel that this may potentially turn into a problem or a habit, to deal w/ anger or problems in general, there are people you can talk to. I'm not sure how old you are, but if you are in school, try making an appointment to talk to the guidance counselor. If you feel you can talk to your parents, that would be good, too! If you attend church, you may talk to your youth pastor or the pastor of the church. Any adult that you can trust, will listen, give you advice or even try to help you. Yes, you can change this!! The next time you feel like cutting, go to someone or call someone you can talk to, to reassure you that everything will be o.k. I'm sure you are a beautiful girl. Cutting yourself isn't the answer. It will only leave scars and those scars will only leave you with bad memories.You are welcome to talk to me anytime- I'm always here to listen. I will be praying for you!!|`|w69QiAqOaa	maybe you're trying to release other emotions like anger? and you just heard of that way to deal with things?|`|5BMfmEgsaa	ya u can|`|GqiAxzSJaa	I have had friends who have cut to it isn't something good to get started doing. U can change expecially if this isn't u. Sometimes we get so caught up in our problems we do what is on our minds when we need relief, or a way out. Knowing u are a Christian u need to turn over the problems in your life to the lord, and let him take care of them. If u are having problems find someone to talk to a youth leader or close friend instead of self inflicting injuries. I have seen what happens to people who get out of control with cutting it is a very good ending. It is like smoking u get adicted to it.|`|A3zAXntxaa	I know where you're coming from, you probably just felt like you could relieve your anger, but cutting yourself. It's not gonna help you at all, it's just gonna give you nasty scars and painful scratches. You can change it anytime, if you're mad try getting on of those stress reliever balls. They can help a lot, and you might wanna talk to a councilor at school, they can help too. Good luck, and I hope everything works out for youu.|`|af2136bcacd19dc5b2bab9b0737163c9aa	yes you can stop! just don't do it especially if you say that's not you. maybe you did it because those two ppl you know who do it..and you're curious.. seriously that's really dangerous just stop it if you feel like you're developing a problem talk to an adult you trust
ubP7Lgxeaa	did she use protection? if she didn't it is possible because although she has not had her peroid yet she could of been getting that month. If it has been three weeks since she has had sex she can take an at home pregnancy test. these cost around $12 australian dollars and are available from most super markets and pharmacies. If you are worried go to the doctor with her she doesnt need to tell her parents untill she knows, if she has had un-protected sex it might also be wise for her to have a check for std while she is their. Some signs to look for are morning sickness, increased boob size...weight gain everywhere, unusual cravings and the need to go to the toileit a lot. GOODLUCK x|`|ozATw7s0aa	Pleasseee ssstopp talkingggg liiikeee thiss!!!<br>  <br>  Yes, she can.<br>  She needs to tell her parents, just in case.<br>  <br>  *shakes head*|`|cmoGATT9aa	yes, it's deffinently possible.<br>  a period happens after you ovulate (when the egg and potentual baby are released) if she were to have sex before her first period, it's possible for her to be pregnant. (though not likely) it's important for her to use protection just in case. chance of falling pregnant is not something she want's to be screwing around with.|`|tbMV3yOFaa	It is possible.  This is because the egg is released first then the period comes if the egg does not become a baby (fertilized).  It is unlikely but check for morning sickness, dizziness, breast tenderness, and cravings.  If it has been longer than that weight gain, and kicking!|`|3imLjQlHaa	Yes, girls who haven't started their period yet can get pregnant because they could possibly be ovulating without menstruating.<br>  <br>  You should advise her to use condoms.|`|8dpZpH0Saa	Yup its possible, thats why you never have sex without protection and arent ready to take on the responsiblity for a child.|`|Xkl1Ukpraa	Dude, No.|`|wTYfrDRNaa	yes because sperm can stay in the body for 10 or 9 days so just because she dosent have her period then dosent mean she cant get pregnant later on|`|RAEJAsa0aa	I do not think so but she should still take a pregnancy test just to be sure whether she is pregnant or not.|`|ZkPAWBqZaa	It is possible it's happened to people.|`|qYAc6Ougaa	yes

S6QpB8QZaa	I was just diagnosed with partial previa last friday. I am 14 weeks along. I also had the same problem with my son and I never did go on bedrest. I was just told no sex, no orgasms, and no lifting anything over 10 lbs. The doctor this time also told me no walking over 2 miles but it may be because I am only 14 weeks. I know it fixed itself with my son sometime between my 24 and 28 week ultrasound.|`|fTd509Qzaa	I had complete previa, my Dr. didn't put me on complete bedrest until I had a bleed, at 31 weeks.  Before that I was on pelvic rest.  So no sex and no strenuous activity.  If you are at home and don't have to do any thing, don't.  There isn't really a need yet to be on complete bed rest.  Your Dr. is probably telling you that it may correct itself.  I read that if you have it past 20 weeks, your chances of it correcting itself are very slim.  But your Dr. knows of the condition so you should be fine.  I had an ultrasound every month to keep an eye on it.<br>  Bottom line, no sex, heavy lifting, exercise, extended walking.  Just take it easy.  Do as little as possible.  Better to be at home, once you start bleeding, you have to stay in the hospital until the baby is born.  Very boring, BELIEVE ME!!<br>  Good Luck!
zmbeIbx7aa	Usually you make your ultrasound appointment there are the doctors after you last appointment but it is normally two weeks after your four weeks. Although they may do one at 20 weeks my friend didn't have hers until 24 weeks and I had three before 23 weeks. So it all depends on your doctor.|`|5deb28fe9fecaef7f55e1f593df11203aa	Im 18 weeks also and I have my ultrasound March 10 at 20 weeks....|`|ebM6CxRQaa	Probably 20 weeks...

vygYFdsSaa	I'm so sorry to hear about your miscarriage. It's actually easier to get pregnant post-miscarriage. I'd just have as much sex as you can LOL. Figure out the days you're ovulating (usually around day 14 of your cycle) and make sure to have sex during that time frame. Good luck|`|K542Db29aa	on your period! before your period! after your period!|`|eGfAXaV3aa	I'm sorry to hear about your loss...and although it is a painful experience to go through...there is always hope for the future. When I had my miscarriage the doctors told me to wait about three months (at this point your cycle should be more regular and the lining in your uterus should be thick enough to hold a fertilized egg.) With that said...just have sex all the time...i know there is only a small window of time to get pregnant every month...but the best way to make it happen is to just do it! (even during your period...i know ....gross) But seriously some women ovulate during their period (or around that time)...just listen to your body. When you feel like you want to have sex...(you know what I mean...lol...hot and bothered)...its likely that you are ovulating. Good luck and have fun! Oh and don't forget to take your prenatals.|`|I2UeqxKxaa	i had a misscarage last aug wen i was 14 weeks pregnant and i became pregnant again in november the first time i tried didnt think it would happen so quick good luck
a44ae0ff85131fac209cb7a6b624b0fdaa	Unfortunately the blood test is pretty accurate and if it came out negative, it is probably negative and just a period which is longer than normal. <br>  <br>  Are you charting while going through all of this? Having your temps on hand would really help you out - knowing if your bbt is still up and when you conceived. <br>  <br>  Try fertilityfriend if you aren't already :)
b8f0CfSsaa	As it is your hormones there is very little you can do, plus sudacream is very greasy so it can make spots worse in some women (it is better for dry skin)<br>  <br>  I had the same problem and once I passed the first trimester it stopped, it is because your hormones increase rapidly in the first few weeks.<br>  <br>  Try increasing your water intake a little, other than that there isn't much more you can do.|`|uuHPneEcaa	I have acne now too.. i am just going to wait until after I have the baby, then start trying to get rid of it. I don't think there is much u can do for it now. Its just ur hormones. Ur skin changes when ur pregnant.<br>  <br>  my forehead looks like.. a connect the dot picture.. and my skin was freaking clear.|`|wkd5CMNaaa	Often, there isn't much you can do, its part of pregnancy.  Talk to your Dr though, there are certain products, that contain certain ingredients, that you shouldn't use while pregnant.|`|532XA7lkaa	Clean and Clear Face Wash for oily skin....it is orange...and has salicylic acid in it.  This is the only thing that has helped me.  I have acne on my forehead...and I never get it!  With my first son I had this un-godly rash on my face...melasma I think it's called....and this time...I'm almost 16 weeks....I have acne!  Yuck to both!  Try that facewash though...it really healps me.  I also refrain from using any moisturizer because it can clog up pores.|`|FfGHHhqBaa	with my daughter i did not have this problem but now i an having a boy and i was told it could be due to testosterone that a woman is obviously not used to... my back is bad, my face not so much.|`|5LAqZUyVaa	go to this web site it is working for me i have the same thing i am about 15-16 weeks|`|OuXnOkZuaa	I get back acne aka bacne lol...in the winter..and I go tanning..it really helps clear everything up..However I am 14 weeks pregnant with twins and do not tan anymore.

mCDopsLEaa	absolutely. they move constantly.|`|s1utniuvaa	they can turn all around... one of my little ones was looking at us during an ultrasound and turned around facing my back right in the middle of the scan!|`|2624d3bf8e4e63e26e8d8d37caca1505aa	yes they move around all the time.|`|0nIwKd5Uaa	Yes between now and delivery the baby can turn 200 times.

Good Luck!!!|`|9E91O09caa	Yep.
F8iyUqJBaa	Because you are not ready yet.  Don't look to a due date to be an exact, it is a guesstimate.  When baby has fully developed the lungs it sends out a hormone that sends you into labor, it is the same hormone that brings in your milk and allows baby to bond.  Induction stops that hormone and produces artificial hormones that cause contractions to be faster and harder and it is very tough on baby, it deprives baby of blood and oxygen and if it takes to long they will often preform a c section because baby will be in distress from the lack of blood and oxygen.  They give you painkillers which are narcotics and a sister to Heroine, and yes, baby gets it.  Baby is usually born a little drugged and not wanting to nurse.<br>  Your body knows what to do and when to do it, baby will not forget to be born.  Please just be patient and please don't induce.|`|9P26sacKaa	You will dilate.  Our bodies are made to do this.  Most first time moms go into labor on an AVERAGE of 41 weeks and 1 day, with half going before this date and half going after, but most right around it.  <br>  <br>  Many moms don't go into labor on their own for 42-43 weeks with no problems for baby or mom.  They'll want to check your placenta and baby more often if this happens, but it doesn't necessarily mean anything other than your baby needs longer to gestate.  Some women and babies are just like this, with no problems with them whatsoever.<br>  <br>  As for having contractions that aren't dilating, there are a lot of things your cervix has to do to ready for birth.  It has to move forward, soften, shorten, and dilate.  Dilation is the last thing that has to happen.  If you're having contractions, they're working on your cervix in these other ways, all of which are important and might even be considered more important than dilation because dilation can't happen without these other things.  <br>  <br>  You should definitely look into the risks of induction and consider your other options as well before going in.  After all, you can get additional monitoring done, test to look at the placenta and baby to make sure they're doing well, and wait for either labor to start or there to be some medical indication for induction.  After all, just being past your due date is not a medical reason for induction.  It is an indication for patience.<br>  <br>  Please don't say you won't dilate.  You will dilate.  If you wouldn't dilate, induction wouldn't be an option.  No woman has ever not dilated.  It just doesn't work that way.  Our cervixes start working towards dilation when our babies send out the signal that they are ready to be born, and we dilate.  Having a negative outlook can actually have a negative effect on your labor, so it would help to be positive, believe in yourself and your baby, and if you really can't wait, you can consider natural labor induction techniques that won't harm baby.  Remember, induction is risky and makes you a high risk patient.  Induction raises risks of additional interventions, instrumental delivery, c-section, fetal distress, breathing problems for baby, and death to you or baby.  It's not usually something to be done for convenience when you're a bit past your due date.<br>  <br>  You will dilate when your baby and body are ready.  It will happen on its own, without help.  Your body is already working and doing what it needs to do to get ready.  You just need a little bit of patience.|`|64OsCr8laa	my aunt is experiencing this in a way she is 39 weeks and they dont a stress test and all she is having contractions and all but she is not dilated or anything either they are gonna go ahead and induce her tuesday morning 12 am ...i wish i had an answer i just wanted you to know your not the only one|`|AI2VoFP4aa	the baby could be too large and its stopping you from dilating. my baby is fairly large and at 40 wks im only 1 cm. i have been one since 38 wks. i wouldnt worry about it since youre being induced anyways. it could just be your body. but know that when they induce you if the meds cant make you dilate enough you will have a csection.|`|jCB7S6sfaa	I never dilated when i was pregnant even my last week of pregnancy.

s8VgyzE2aa	well two of my boys love scary movies, one is 14 and the other is turning 12 next month. I would never take them to the theater to see these movies, espeically friday the 13th and I wouldn't allow explicit sexual scenes either but they have seen the Saw movies, child's play and maybe a couple other rated R ones. They have also seen a lot of the PG-13 ones. I usually watch it first. Language in a movie doesn't bother me because my kids don't repeat it and they will hear language all over anyway. Violence doesn't bother me because my kids are old enough to know it's a movie and gosh I watched tons of scary movies as a kid and it never made me think to go kill someone. It's a movie.<br>  <br>  I am even ok with partial nudity, I mean my older two (14, twins) have seen boobie by mistake in a movie before, I didn't make a big deal. But heck, last summer my 11 yr old got a live view at the beach when the woman in the water next to us got caught in a massive wave and lost her top *shrug* not the end of the world, I think my son was more embaressed than the girl. <br>  <br>  The only thing I am not keen on is explicit sexual scenes. <br>  <br>  Everyone has different views and I'm sure I will get a ton of thumbs down but I only allow my kids to do what I know they can handle. My other 14 yr old (they are twins) doesn't like scary movies. He didn't come with us when I took them to see I am Legend. And I certainly would never take my 9 yr old to anything scary. he mainly sees G and PG and at home, some PG-13 like transformers.|`|p2Njf5gBaa	My parents where strict and protective, but when it came to scary movies and such,  we were never banned from watching them. <br>  <br>  I remember many a times laying around the living room and my mom would be fast forwarding over a nudity scene or telling us not watch.  <br>  <br>  I would rather my children were allowed to watch controversial things with me then with some strangers, over at a friends house, or sneaking around to do it.  <br>  <br>  forming a good bond with your children starts with being real with them.  you aren't going to be able to protect them from everything all the time. <br>  <br>  Its kinda like that same concept of how I would rather my child have their first beer with me, safely at home,  instead of them deciding to experiment with some friends out in a car somewhere.  I had my first drink with my parents, and that way they where able to teach me responsibility and how it was a privilege,  not a taboo thing that fun to do and sneak around to do while being a rebellious teenager.  I am proud to say that I have never drink en and driven, which is something almost all of my friends with strict parents against those things did.  I never felt the need to sneak around, so I never felt the need to make poor choices.|`|PDHCOrOSaa	When I was that age...well probably a bit older my mother would let me watch horror movies but only if it was just horror.  If there was even the slightest hint to a sex scene or if they used swear words especially the "F" word I couldn't watch it.  It seems like every scary movie now a days has to use sex and tons of swearing to be scary...stupid if you ask me.<br>  <br>  For example I watched:<br>  IT<br>  Pet Semetary<br>  Carrie<br>  Poltergeist<br>  Amity ville horror<br>  ( and I believe all of these I watched on cable tv so they more edited )|`|yV8fog7Paa	I have no clue why they would be allowed to watch it. I'm not even allowed to, haha. I wouldn't want to.|`|GGAgxzJNaa	If you asked them what the storyline was, they probably couldn't tell you.  I think they enjoy the thrill of seeing and hearing things they're not supposed to be seeing or hearing.<br>  Personally I don't think it's bad for kids to see a bit of nudity or moderate violence if it's important to the story.  But the gratuitous crap in movies like that is a whole different thing.|`|ro5vFj9Aaa	what you dont' understand is they hear worse stuff at school and they were there to see the movie and that is it. the ugly stuff was way too out of their range and did't resort to that. its what you hve inside that counts. didn't you like the movie? well its just letting them do something once ina while and sometimes movie goers forget when they were young but then again its been more now then before but so has life changed. i would let them go and councel them talk about it after waryds that is only way to get their goo dprespective.|`|f3SyOyMEaa	Any younger than 10-12 I wouldn't let them see anything that might disturb them. My kids are such different personalities that it would also depend on the kid.<br>  No sex scenes.  I still make my daughter who is almost 17 close her eyes when there's one on. Yes...I know, she knows, but I still hate it!<br>  She humors me though and does it! I have no doubt that she is rolling her eyes underneath that closed lid!|`|prqrQcd1aa	I don't allow my children to watch scary movies because they can't handle them yet. But I can tell you that i've been watching scary movies since I was a very small child. I am just desensitized from doing it so much as a child/teen, etc. that it doesn't bother me when i see that stuff.|`|a095159fe0597a1cbcdff915d247b333aa	I think it's because some parents cannot find or afford a babysitter and really want to see a movie.  So, they think their kids are too young to remember anything from the movie.|`|822da6b7b24693d516953606bfb56517aa	i think some parents think that if kids are exposed to these things early on, then they wont be tempted to experiment with them later on. crazy reasoning, but thats what my parents did. <br>  <br>  didnt work out how they planned AT ALL. lol|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	Killing people wearing a hockey mask is fun?|`|VuGPufs4aa	its a rotten world we live in best let them know . they will figure it out hopefully for the best. ya know ?|`|c490676d02a8b133e7a6143969ba0116aa	I don't get it either. I am a preschool teacher and amazed at the movies parents take their children to see. I had a parent take his 10, 7, 6, and 4 year old go see the latest Batman years ago and another family with a 4 year old to see The Dark Knight when it came out. My BFF's husband was going to take his 5 year old daughter to see The Dark Knight too and I said "That's too scary for her." He said "But it's PG-13." I said "She's 5!" He said "But I'll be there." WTH? He took her.<br>  <br>  I think there are just too many unthinking parents these days. They don't think what impact these movies will have on a child. I can tell you that they do. Those students of mine had a lot to say about those movies and I know they were/are scared. Also, these parents would rather have their children as their friends and are afraid for their children not to like them so they don't say "No."|`|ko3Larigaa	Because they arent keeping there kids sheltered my parents were young when they had us but she lets us watch scary movies now if it had extreme sex seens then we werent allowed to but if it was like the ones without sex seens. <br>  <br>  And at the same time I know parents that dont let there kids watch this <br>  <br>  Im 14 years old now and watching those movies kept me from making mistakes because I would see the teens that got pregnant so early and how hard it was. <br>  <br>  Keeping kids from things like that is just sheltering them and wont know much when they are older.<br>  <br>  Now I do think if you are letting a kid under like 4-6 watch movies with sex seens and really bloody movies well I dont know I think they are young but they might not even fully understnad the movie and some dont watch it.<br>  <br>  I am just giving reasons to both sides =)|`|zdWDkadraa	Personally I loved that kinda thing when I was in Elementary... always watched scary, gorey movies with my parents... my favourites were Stephan King's. My parents reasoning was that it wasn't real, and they didn't want to shelter us from the bad things in life. They wanted us to know all that's out there, but they did take the time to explain why some peopel did these things, and that they were very bad. I turned out perfectly fine, to be honest. Haven't murdered anyone yet!<br>  <br>  As for the theatures..I'm pretty sure the parents DON'T know/allow them. As the movies are rated R, a kid can't buy tickets and thus probably bought tickets to a different movie and then snuck in to see Freddy vs Jason. I know we always use to do that. It was the cool thing to do.|`|1d02fcff81d2bb070fc361fbe28e3606aa	I think they just want to go because their friends are seeing it and no one wants to admit that it scares the heck out of them.  Peer pressure ... that's all.  I still think it's wrong for parents to expose kids to these kinds of movies at that young of an age, but then again I also think it's wrong to buy toddler girls underwear that says "Eye Candy" on it which is what I saw being sold at one very well known national store recently.  A lot of parents these days are more interested in being their children's buddies instead of real parents.|`|eYpE4bp2aa	Because kids will always do what they are not allowed to do. I would not want my elementary-age child seeing a movie like that, but I also know that I can't shelter them forever.<br>  <br>  Nudity is natural. Vulgar language is nothing more than overly expressive and the world is a violent place. I was 13 when I saw the WTC destroyed on live TV. Nudity or violence really is not all that bad when compared to that.|`|4Uuehq2Faa	I would rather have my child watching love making than something so violent, you cant get scared by a sex scene, maybe embarressed and confused but violence can cause trauma in a child ( if they cant handle it)<br>  I'm not talking about a 5-6 yr old im talking about 10+ i dont have a problem because its easy to explain that sex is when a man and a woman love eachother, whereas violence is much harder to explain and much more fearful to learn that sex.|`|ntdGOZqGaa	I dont know why they would do that, I think everything should be age appropriate. My cousin is like that she lets her 7 year old watch awful movies and thinks that it is funny...even the ones where there is sex and stuff in it. We dont watch movies like that in our house unless our son is asleep.|`|c5AJGcYcaa	Do you remember what it was like to be young? (hang on im not being a smart a**) <br>  Remember how much fun it was to sneak into a Rated R movie without your parents knowing. <br>  Im sure these kids parents didn't know they were going.|`|angW1Lkfaa	this should answer your question<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/most_controversial/killer-kids.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/most_...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.miaminewtimes.com/2007-03-29/news/killer-kids/" rel="nofollow">http://www.miaminewtimes.com/2007-03-29/...</a>|`|hAXDWhiVaa	5 would be too young. but if my son were 11 or 12 i might consider it. scary movies are fine but the sex scenes and extreme violence is what would bother me.|`|HQgS2P4Baa	the parents are morons the kids watch it because there being socially and devepmently messed up dont do it i wouldnt never let my daughter even if her friends did|`|XFRpw88Zaa	The parents just don't care about their child's well being. So stop worrying about it and do what you think is the best thing for your kids.|`|tQVBDx5Paa	Because it is easier to just give in than to say no.  Lazy parents.  Period|`|DOoHDBTiaa	my mom didnt let me watch friday the 13th  lol.|`|55aba19c6c9d9f4e98e2303268e9a73faa	As far back as I can remember I have always loved horror movies. My mom didn't even let me watch stuff like power rangers or bewitched (Seriously!) Because she thought they were too violent and too pagan for a good little girl to watch.<br>  <br>  But I watched them anyway, as often as I could. If I could manage it, I would sneak out of bed late at night after my parents fell asleep, and I'd watch late night T.V. I saw my first Friday the 13th flick when I was 6, and I LOVED it. I didn't have nightmares or anything.<br>  <br>  Some kids are just drawn to horror and stuff even if they haven't been exposed to it. Now, if the parents actually take them to see those movies when they're so young, then I'd question their parenting skills.<br>  <br>  My parents never took me to see a movie that was rated higher than PG 13 until I was 16, and even then they still tried to monitor and censor what i watched. But then again, I started reading adult books at the age of 13 because I had gotten bored with the teen books. I was reading through stacks of them a day. <br>  <br>  But I guess what I'm saying is, maybe its not about letting them? I mean, my mom didn't let me watch the Freddy movies, I went behind her back. Same thing with books! She didn't let me read The Generals Daughter or 1984 or Count of Monte Cristo or A Strange New World~ I went behind her back and read them all by the time I was 14. Maybe its more "I'd rather know what they're watching/reading, than assume that what they're watching/reading is benign and finding out much later that its not." than it is "letting" them.<br>  <br>  <br>  As for what the kids get from it~ with my sisters it was trying to prove to their friends that they could handle such mature movies..(And admittedly, trying to fit in with my group of friends as well...). For me, I've always always always loved horror movies. The adrenaline rush you get from a good scare...its addicting. Like why do children adore rollercoasters? Same reason, the adrenaline rush.|`|b6EyFLgUaa	Personally I don't  care much about the sex scene. my daughter is 2 and no she doesn't watch sex scene but once shes older it will be discussed ( i was raised in a family where sex was very open and talked about, I saw porkeys at 8) What i do care about is the violence in those movies and the fear that comes with that. I think the most violent thing my daughter has ever seen ( granted shes two) is when my husband was playing a much loved video game from his child hood at the mall. She really couldn't see much. I watched saw when I was 17 and slept with my mom for a week i was so scared. The idea that something like that could happen to you is much scarier to me then the idea of having sex. My daughter will not be watching horror or violent movies until shes older. If there is sex, drugs or what not in it we will have a talk about it and move on from there. The violence cant be cleared from your mind with a simple talk. Id much rather have my daughter watch a sex scene them some one being sliced up.|`|iko1uqBnaa	I let my young children watch scary movies and the reason i do it is because it helps them to put a face on the things that go bump in the night and it gives me a way of explaining that they saw that person die in the movie so they don't have to be afraid and when they got older and started to understand movie magic I used it to explain that all those crazy scary things that go on in their heads at night in the dark aren't real and can only be done on movies. the scary movies didn't give them those fears every kid gets them with or without the movies the movies just help me explain those scary things away and now my kids can enjoy them for their entertainment value without the fear and nightmares. I'd like to add that I don't agree with the sexual content I do believe that if they see it too young they question it to young and it becomes natural too young then they have sex too young.So I don't allow that and I don't take them too the theaters we always watch it together at home so I can answer the questions and be there for them|`|m0axj5jZaa	well, its sometimes considered amusing, the American girls book a guide to girls body or something like that  and its had pictures of cartoon girls measuring their chest for bra sizes and how to se a tampon pics too, all cartoon of course for a learning process but the girls brought it and laughed about for the pics not the information. some parents dint even know that their children are going to see such a movie, depending on their age and allowance of freedom. some parents are the careless kind that don't care what a child does and wont even ask questions about what ever it is that they did.|`|ZLsWyPn8aa	I was allowed to watch tons and tons of rated R movies as a kid, and I turned out fine. Heh.|`|h50SIDZtaa	its just a movie.<br>  when i was 12 (like3 years ago) i watched scary movies alot<br>  its fun :)|`|XFZsbI9iaa	well, I'm 14 years old and honestly, kids are just in to scary movies these days.|`|Ybo6HS8Caa	I honestly do not know.  My kids are 5, 6, and 8, and there is no way I would let them watch that!  I was really mad awhile back when I found out that when my kids are over at their dads house, his girlfriend was letting them watch "Saw" as their bedtime movie.  What an idiot!  <br>  <br>  I think the only thing little kids get from those movies are a bunch of bad dreams and bad ideas.|`|TQW5E6olaa	I personally don't care for horror, so I won't be pushing Bella to see any.

M6c0hUefaa	She's immature and doesn't like the fact that her 'boyfriend' had a child with another girl, thus, trying to talk behind your back or make fun of your situation, but really, she's losing out because he's obviously not the best of guys if he won't even care for or see his child. Just let it roll off of your shoulders, she's probably not doing any better than you, most likely you're doing better than her. People are dumb, will always be dumb, so we have to learn to just deal with it.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	sorry, i don't care if i was a tri-zillioinaire, that deadbeat dad would be paying some child support; if he doesn't want a relationship, he will regret it, but at least i would make him take some of the responsibility by taking him to court, proving the baby is his, and getting paid; wouldn't care if it was fifty bucks as long as it is court ordered....jmho|`|0D4q4Q2Raa	Maybe Brayden's dad stretches the truth.|`|IFDfpbFJaa	Ohhh that's nasty of her! I don't know how i'd have tolerated that ! I'm sort of going through that with my ex and his new wife (they were together 10 months before getting married) who thinks I'm the biggest scum bag of the Earth due to his lies. I'd just brush it off and bank that away in my memory and not be so nice to her next time you run into each other on a more personal level (ie, her coming to your house with the boyfriend to pick up the child)    Women are caddy and mean....it amazes me how my ex's new wife thinks so low of me|`|YmEGCGtnaa	She is jealous of you, and immature like you said, as well as a typical petty highs chool girl. She is also very nosy---"who's baby sit hat?" please like that's any of her business anyway even if she knows.

You have a connection with her boyfriend, one that she doesn't have, and she doesn't like that. I'm sure it's hard being the bigger person but good job. <br>  <br>  On another note, why aren't you collecting child support from him? He's not helping out so make him. I cannot stand to see guys run from their responsibilites.<br>  <br>  ETA: Sorry, I just read your added details. If you don't want to handle/hassle with him then you certainly don't have to.|`|SjX72fPyaa	She's probably really bothered over the fact that you have that kind of connection with her boyfriend while she doesn't. So she's lashing out at you to try and make you feel low and worthless. She's being an immature little girl and good for you for being the bigger person in the situation! <br>  Honestly, I probably wouldn't have been able to resist throwing a comment of some sort back at her, even knowing that it wouldn't help the situation at all.|`|b1mVjqfSaa	Some people want to start drama b/c they have nothing better in life to do.<br>  <br>  I would have been dreading an altercation if I were in your situation too...but you held your own and didn't feed into her towards the end. <br>  <br>  Feel proud...you're a good mom Callie.

I thought you already took Bruce to court for child support?<br>  <br>  This girlfriend wouldn't bother me so bad, Id just brush it off my shoulders but what would bother me is the child support deal. Bruce laid down and had sex its not right for him to run from his responsibilities.<br>  <br>  Even if you did get child support from him you wouldn't really have such a "hassle" with him. As you wouldn't have no say in the matter the judge would make sure that its paid, or he goes to jail. Its as simple as that.<br>  <br>  Your young and doing everything you can do, it took TWO and its not right for you to do it all on YOUR on.|`|uNvF299Caa	You were amazing!  It's hard to walk away without saying anything.  <br>  <br>  She is ridiculous. I hate people like that. <br>  <br>  But I think you should get child support, he has to learn how to be responsible for his own actions.  And if I were you never say anything bad about the dad to your kid, you should be neutral, let your son figure for himself what kind of a person his dad is.|`|TJusfEnlaa	oh hunny u sound like u are having such a hard time. u sound very mature for 16. to be honest, i don't think i would have the guts to go into a store if my bf's ex (or whatever) was working there. <br>  babe i think u need to move away and cut all ties. i mean brayden's father obviously has nothing to do with him. <br>  they say a change is as good as a holiday!!|`|q84KT11saa	From the sounds of things they deserve one another.

It was rude and somewhat abusive of her to say things like that. I think you should have a court ordered DNA test and shut her up though! I also think you did the best thing by just not saying anything. her response didn't deserve and answer. A friend of my ex started drama recently and I honestly have no idea why, I am older 39 today! and I just blocked her form e-mailing me. So I have no idea why people get off on being rude or trying to intimidate others. They most assuredly think it isn't his, because you haven't pursued anything. Over time it will eat at them though.|`|QKh7voVKaa	yeah, you are a credible threat to her self centered little world where only she is important and only she matters. She, feeling threatened by your presence is trying the classic bullying antic of taking you down a peg to make herself feel better about her pathetic situation. (if she makes herself feel like she's above you by belittling you, she gives herself a bandaid fix) She very likely knows that a guy who will treat you so badly, will eventually treat her that badly to and move on, but doesn't want to admit it to herself. You can try having a talk to her,(without 'dad' there) it'll help her and you. leave baby with mum and CALMLY explain your not after her boyfriend or his money. That Brayden didn't ask to be born into such a complicated situation, but he is and you'd like to be on speaking terms with her. If you go to her with this she will be less threatened and most likely (even if you can't get Braydens dad to see him) the situation will be less volatile. You should try, I know it's hard, I had a similar situation. I ended up becoming friends with a fue girls this way (he will most likely move on). But Brayden will want a relationship with his dad eventually, no hurry you have time, but you should think about approaching the situation.

USrhxMW9aa	I would think that would be fine.  Seeing that people supplement with formula, you should be able to supplement with breast milk.  If anything the breast milk might help his digestion since it is natural.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	I don't know why you are using formula since you obviously have more than enough milk.  The problem is clearly with the baby getting the milk which is entirely fixable with a little help.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/newman/14more_more_bf_myths.html#6" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/newman/14more_mo...</a><br>  6. Breastmilk given with formula may cause problems for the baby.<br>  <br>  Not true! Most breastfeeding mothers do not need to use formula and when problems arise that seem to require artificial milk, often the problems can be resolved without resorting to formula. However, when the baby may require formula, there is no reason that breastmilk and formula cannot be given together.|`|QzOCkKGjaa	just use YOUR milk, ditch the formula.|`|vLOjcH7paa	I gave my son breastmilk by itself for the 1st 4 weeks of his life.

He was fine and his Pediatrician said it was ok to do! : )<br>  <br>  The breast milk is just so good for the babies...I pumped as long as I was able to.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!! : )|`|qBtTAgBqaa	If you're engorged, then you obviously have enough milk now. I'd just get rid of the formula and let baby nurse.|`|3hIr3Dllaa	Give him the breastmilk FIRST, then fill him up on the formula.  He'll be fine.
O3EtP4vOaa	I would recommend going to see a Reproductive Endocrinologist.  Having a period that is 41 days you are probably not ovulating or by the time the egg is released the egg may not be developed properly to be fertilized.  If you do not ovulate you will not have a period, but you may have break through bleeding, brownish discharge, or spotting when the lining of the uterus gets to thick.  If you are serious about concieving now then do not waste more time as the testing they will do take a month or so and then they have to get everything regulated so you can get preggers.  I personally know of really good doctors in Houston and the Chicago area if you around there email me and I can give you some names, it is very difficult to find a good doctor to help you with this.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you!|`|oqUlYXqtaa	it's hard to tell with irregular cycles when you ovulated, but an ovulation kit will be accurate and you ovulated the day that it was positive or a couple of days before that....it's also commin to have mid-cycle spotting with irregular periods, you can talk to your Doctors as they can give you meds to help you regulate your periods and make it easier for you.<br>  you can also ask doctors online for free, try fertilityties.com<br>  good luck!|`|Wzws8v8daa	sounds like you have irregular periods.  mine are irregular like that, and it turns out i'm not ovulating. my doctor told me that almost all women who have irregular periods are not ovulating.  you can take your temperature every morning and the day you ovulate your temperature will rise at least 0.5 degrees.  if you take your temp each morning and never see the rise, then you are not ovulating and you should go see a fertility specialist.|`|jOLtcXufaa	idk wat kinda OV test u are using but i know the kind i use always have 2 line, one dark one now, it is when they are BOTH dark that u are ovulation, i think its like this for most tests, check the instructions, but hey try anyways either way are u losing out ;)

BqqDJXkjaa	The first sign of the chicken pox is a runny nose and the spots themselves. A fever and rash in small children could be allergy or viral infection. Rashes can be serious - take her to the doctor.|`|AA10779494	Firs of all U feel feverish and unwell. It is usual to have one or two small watery pimples on your forehead and any other part of body. In the next day onwards you will develop severe fever and boils all over your body. If you are past 18, the symptoms are grave and serious. <br>  <br>  children during their early age will not develop serious troubles and probably will die out quickly in a mild manner. The older you are the severe the attack may be. I had the attack in 32 years and it was much severe. I could remember that it was all over my body including the tongue, inner surface of palms, genitals scalp etc. and it was one of the severe form of fever I remember even after 17 years. <br>  <br>  Also, it is likely to keep you bed ridden for so many days due to severe weakness following the recovery days. I suggest nutritious food may help U recover quicker.|`|NI8D46J0aa	I got chicken pox when I was 7, and remember it clearly. :)  I woke up in the middle of the night with a red bump on my stomach.  The next day I woke up and the red bumps were everywhere.  It could be 5th disease. Look up pictures of it online and see if it looks the same.  My son had it and I swore he had chicken pox.

e0eb82b689e1db392eb51c89982ed115aa	you have a lot of meat to chew in this question... wow. IF you tested a faint positive you likely are pregnant. Its VERY rare to get a false postitive no matter how faint or light the marks were. A fake pregnancy wont produce the needed hormone to give you the positive. I suggest going to the doctors and telling them exactly what you told us. Your spotting can be very normal in the first stage of pregnancy. Most women dont get the signs of pregnancy till 6 to 8 weeks into it. You probably had some implantation discomfort and mistook it for PMS or Pregnancy signs. Just relax, schedule an appointment soon and see if you really will be a momma in 8 1/2 months or so.|`|vygYFdsSaa	You should take another HPT and see if you get a definitive positive this time. Or just go to your doctor and get checked out.|`|AA11831450	I seriously doubt that you are pregnant with all the spotting, but it is possible. What you might want to consider is that some of the symptoms you are obsessing on are not symptoms that show up in the first month. If you are pregnant you will not "show" until around 4 months along, unless you just eat a lot more than normal. You shouldn't have any symptoms at all in the first month. You sound like you are trying to get pregnant.|`|1UrMbDZHaa	the best thing is to go to a clinic and take a blood test to see if youre pregnant.|`|hORVMOHKaa	get checked by your doctor|`|hNyedM9caa	Sometimes a woman can have all of the early symptoms and be totally convinced that they're pregnant and then it just kind of...disappears. It sounds weird, yes, but there's actually an article on wikipedia that I was reading just the other day. It's called a 'phantom' or 'false' pregnancy: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantom_pregnancy" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantom_pre...</a><br>  <br>  Are you currently trying to conceive? Because that may cause you to truly believe that you are, indeed, pregnant. I suggest going to see your doctor, get some tests done (much more accurate than a home pregnancy test in any case) and then see what happens.<br>  <br>  Good luck with everything! :)
o6RQnxnYaa	It sounds like you are putting yourselves under too much pressure. Relax and it will happen for you. Stressing yourself out only makes it hard if not possible to conceive.|`|Tx991ij5aa	There are so many factors that aren't considered when trying to conceive... Age? By the age of 30+ a womans chances of conception begins to decrease... Health? Diet? Regular periods don't necessarily mean they are "normal"... Of the two days that a woman is likely to conceive something as simple as stress can reduce/eliminate your chances of conception.<br>  <br>  I know it can be so frustrating trying to conceive and its especially hard when it seems like people just "pop up" pregnant without trying... I think thats the secret. Don't try so hard. Sex every other day (everyday if able) should produce a pregnancy unless there are fertility issues and if that is the case I would suggest a fertility center/clinic for consulation. <br>  <br>  Discuss the matter with an OB/GYN and see what S/he recommends.<br>  <br>  Good Luck to you.|`|frpCK0utaa	You are stressing over this far too much.

So much for well laid plans.  I guess what I'm trying to say is that when the time is right It'll Happen.

CdJtH0xdaa	Hooking up means to kiss, whether it's French kissing, or just lip-to-lip kissing. When I was in high school, my parents, who didn't know the modern meaning of the term "hooking up", would ask what I would be doing over the weekend, and I was like, "I'm getting together with some friends downtown", and they'd say, "Oh, who are you hooking up with", as in "getting together" with.

I think it is over used, and boys brag a lot and lie to each other about girls they have  crushes on and are afraid to ask out.  <br>  Girls who allow this have NO --Zero- No self respect and are pitiful no matter how cute they are or how much money they have.|`|AA12069058	It can mean all of those.

doHNEvf8aa	yeah my little girl loves it =]<br>  its a good place to put her when i need to make dinner or do something around the house. she is not only secure but occupied too.|`|AA11600455	ok now i want to buy one. once i get my credit card paid down enough that is.|`|IFDfpbFJaa	That looks really cute. It looks like it will help with leg muscles. I'd get one ! I'd have to look around at them all and research the brand though. I'm picky :)
jLI0IgWkaa	When the weather gets nicer out, take her to a local gymboree or similar program, where she'll get used to being around others.<br>  <br>  good luck .|`|huHOpRLLaa	you need to get her around other people first before u try to leave her with someone <br>  but if shes around ppl alot it should be easier to leave her<br>  but kids are usually always attached to there parents or whoever takes the most care of them<br>  so it will be hard at first and she will scream for you<br>  but u need to just leave <br>  and she'll get better with other ppl.<br>  good luck<br>  ; )|`|xRZ1PRZwaa	Hi! You should try to make arrangements for your child care provider as soon as possible. Once in place, you and your daughter should visit with the provider regularly so that your daughter becomes accustomed.<br>  <br>  Once some time has passed, spend a few minutes away, letting the provider spend some quiet time with your daughter. As time goes on, slowly work your way up until your daughter feels comfortable with, and knows the provider.<br>  <br>  You'll most likely be looking for a private, warm and caring helper rather than an institution for your daughter.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps - enjoy school!|`|3hIr3Dllaa	have someone you trust come over every day for like at hour at first.  Start by just taking a shower while the friend/family member/whatever sits her.  Eventually when you're ready, leave the house and go for a walk.  Start staying out longer, and have them introduce bottles to her.  Eventually she'll be able to handle you being gone for the amount of itme that you'll need to for class and studying|`|USrhxMW9aa	Have the people that may watch her, such as family and friends, come over and spend time with her.  Once she has become familiar with them you could leave for a little while, go walk around the block or something, and slowly up the time she would be left with them.  By the time you have to go back to school she should be fine.|`|vLOjcH7paa	Start with small increments of time and use people who are understanding with her "attachment" needs.<br>  She'll get there.<br>  I too have a 5 month old...and, I am his favorite person as well! : )<br>  <br>  Good Luck : )|`|qSM3xdejaa	you should have online school.

Tell her thats exactly how you feel.|`|MigBOiUPaa	wow tht sucks. =[ what i would is just stop talking to her and and act all sad all the time until shes like whats wrong? and u be like oh nothing its just tht i have no life i wish you would just let me do fun things since im almost an adult i wanna have fun but u wont let me so...=[<br>  <br>  or just start rebelling. do whatever you wanna do until she realizes she cant stop you.<br>  <br>  <br>  good luck|`|ro5vFj9Aaa	shes a bit overbearing. yes she is. but you k now when you get out on your own you will probably go nuts but i would thank her for your self so far. its time to let go and i know that i have 40'year old and hes still my baby but you can talk to her show her this. she has to give a little 11 curfew is great and take care.|`|UHfA9yHPaa	Well, if talking to her doesn't work then maybe you should just ignore the rules and do whatever.<br>  <br>  If she's not willing to negotiate, then you should just rebel for a day, go out and leave a note on the table saying "Went driving back at 5" or whatever, come back and say "see? No harm done. I'm still alive."|`|AA12020110	You might have an aunt or older person talk to her.  Or maybe even your Dad.  It is hard to let our young ones out of the nest.  But they will fly away if we don't let them explore life.  Is your mom depressed or going through the change of life?  Any of this can make a nice mom into a clingy anxious mom.  Be nice to her.  Show her you are not two.|`|H0sPCJQPaa	You are probably an only child, or the youngest.<br>  To her you are still the baby.<br>  You need to talk to her. and tell her YOU ARE NOT a baby. You want to grow up and she has to let you.|`|cmoGATT9aa	ugh, jeeze.<br>  leave!<br>  tell her to respect you as a adult (you're a year off it!... well i'm Australian anyway)<br>  or leave.|`|a7088b93654b850a7346f43ab3d3ba5daa	Unfortunately there is not a lot you can do, since you still live in her home.  Like all things, this too will pass.  You should plan to go away to college and live in a dorm when the time comes.  It is not that far off.  What will make things worse, much worse, if to follow advice like rebel or ignore the house rules.  That is surely not the way to gain her trust.|`|umEgRb7Vaa	Does she put you in diapers and feed you baby food? Then she isn't treating you like you are two. She's treating you like you are 12 or so.<br>  <br>  If you are 17 then you can move out in less than a year, so deal with it until then. You've gotten this far. A little more won't kill you.|`|JuWL7T0Haa	wow i feel sorry for you!  i couldn't of handled that.  stick it out until you graduate get urself a scholorship and go away to school and get away from her...wow that is just terrible...tell ur mom she is basically ruining your life...she isn't protecting you she is making you hate her|`|abELhjcoaa	show her, it can take some time, but showing some responsibility (even if you know you are responsible) goes a long way.<br>  <br>  and even if nothing works, theres not much time until college|`|Xkl1Ukpraa	Remind her how old she is and how young she was when she had you.|`|qRwykCMoaa	Yell at her and make her feel like crap.<br>  Honestly I think it might make her think.|`|55aba19c6c9d9f4e98e2303268e9a73faa	It sounds to me like she doesn't trust you, when you haven't given her a reason not to.<br>  <br>  In fact, I think you should ask her that. "Why don't you trust me? I've never given you a reason not to. You're making me feel very resentful and hateful of you, and I don't want our relationship to be like that."<br>  <br>  If she blows up, then she obviously has severe issues, and you may just have to either stick it out until you're 18 and can do whatever you want or you'll have to rebel against her.<br>  <br>  Normaly I don't advocate rebellion against ones parents, but sometimes they need a wake-up call. Mine certainly did.
MltrpgMkaa	it sounds like you have a good head on your shoulders and that you should go to the doctor on monday in the mean time if you don't have to work and can stay home sleep all day get up pee go back to bed if the other is true go to work come home go to bed there is no shame in being tired and the other person who said that she is 11 weeks cheer up hun it will be ok I threw up on the way to walmart and it took me 1 and 1/2 hours to get there it is just 10 miles away|`|myw1SEgzaa	Well, you should go to your doc and get a blood test done.  I'm 11 weeks, and I could sleep all day.  Well, in between throwing up.  I have been pretty bad since 7 weeks.  I don't know how people can get up and go to work feeling like this.  Well, if you have a lot of symptoms, then you must be having a good pregnancy!  That's what I keep hearing!  Good luck!|`|vWb8fquvaa	If you *think* you would be 8 weeks pregnant if you were and have taken a pregnancy test and it came up negative, you are not pregnant.<br>  <br>  And sure its common when your are pregnant but it is also common when you are sick or about to start your period.|`|MwmtKLedaa	Umm... hope you want a baby cuz it sounds like you're pregnant.  My period is the same way - really really irregular, so I didn't even realized I had missed it when I was pregnant.  I also noticed that I had put on a little weight, but it was evenly dispersed.  I had no morning sickness, but strange little things changed, like all of the sudden coffee, which I love, was way too strong a flavor and almost made me nauseous.  The tired thing is also a good cue.  I'm talking drop dead exhausted for no real reason.  Go get the official test. I hope the result is one that makes you happy, one way or the other.|`|AA11031068	I felt the exact way you are describing EVERYTHING.<br>  <br>  Go buy the First Response test and take it tomorrow morning with FMU. It may of been to early and you may not be as far along as you had suspected. Irregular periods will do that to you..<br>  <br>  Although: Sometimes irregular periods mean too that you have a severe hormone imbalance and hormone imbalances can produce the same symptoms as pregnancy. I have waisted many test sticks thanks to this problem. :)|`|OxxrqzCzaa	Well. for my daughter, I didn't know I was pregnant for like 3 months, but after I found out I realized I was falling asleep early all the time & his sister said I ate a lot at Thanksgiving & Christmas (before I knew I was pregnant).  Now she's 7 1/2 & I don't remember if I was getting my period or not at that time, why I didn't get tested sooner.  I have been sleeping A Lot for the past 3 weeks (like a lot of nights though I may not gobto bed until 3 AM & have sooo many thiughts running thru my hrad that it takes about an hour to fall asleep, but then I don't wake up until 2 Pm most days & once I was Still tired!  (Luckily my husband put my daughter on the bus most of those days, on the days he didn't I'd get up, put her on the bus & then go right back to sleep, even 1 day I only wanted to take an hour nap after putting her on the busv& then I started daydreaming, then fell back asleep.)).  Also, before I started sleeping a lot I started getting cravings & I still do sometimes & the past 3 nights I've been feeling movement in my stomach (I never felt my daughter move at all tho when she was in my stomach, possibly due to medication I was on at the time.  The thing is tho, my husband & I haven't been having sex often (we used to twice a day & I never got pregnant) & I've been getting my period every month, tho it's usually late (once maybe it came on time, once maybe a day late, usually 2 - 3 days late, once a week late) - but it used to be 5 days, now it's 3, once in a while 4, tho I do get a heavy day.  I'm 36 & my husband will be 41 in 13 days.
Ybo6HS8Caa	It could pass on to the kids, or the kids may decide that they don't wanna be anything like their mother, and become complete opposites of her.  It all depends on the personality of that child.|`|ntdGOZqGaa	I know how money can be and all but I think atleast once a year you need to put some money back and do something as a family. If its going to ride rollarcoasters or something. To me family time is very important and I think there is always a way it can be done you just have to save up for it. Plan ahead, if you want to take them to the beach then plan ahead for it so you can save up so they can go. I can see being to stressed out and that rubbing off on the kids, just try to take a deep breath and not let the kids know about the money since they are to young to know about that. Good luck|`|HFWLYMD6aa	Yes and no. I learnt some very wise money choices from my mother. But then sometimes i go a bit crazy. I'm always stressing about money.|`|ko3Larigaa	Thats how my parents are well some of it. we havent gone on vacation since my 9 year old sister was born. I usually go to bday parties and thing but still some I cant.<br>  <br>  It made me realize not to get pregnant at 16 like she did and to go to college and get a good job to make enouigh money so my kids can have fun. <br>  <br>  I love my mother and i love how even tho she was so young she was still there to take care of my older brother. <br>  <br>  Usually some of it gets passes on my mom was really neat and tidy and hated things messy but wasnt to good with money. On the other hand my dad was the complete opposite. But now hes gotten worse but thats a different story. If kids watch and realize they dont like how things are and they are respnsible they will turn out different if they are lazy irresponsible then they may turn out like parents because they wont wanna change

azE51WGRaa	I have heard that blue cohosh can be fatal, especially when taken too early. But since you're not anywhere near early and your midwife recommended it, I would try it. Your midwife wouldn't have suggested it unless the benefits (getting that baby out now like you need to) outweighed the risks. If you're still shaky on using it, you can try castor oil. It's derived from the castor plant, so it's all natural. (There are reports that it causes the baby to pass a bowel in the uterus but there has been no conclusive evidence of this). Just be prepared to have diarrhea and vomiting if you take the castor oil. Drink lots of fluids as you can get dehydrated easily with this method. If it does work, there is the possibility that you will have a fast labor, so be prepared for that possibility as well. Good luck and I hope you get the baby out soon without resorting to that awful pitocin (although sometimes it ultimately is unavoidable. I had to be induced by pitocin too.)|`|BqCTPJP8aa	it is safer to try castor oil... blue or black conosh has known to be poisonous, so i wouldnt risk it! try castor oil and if that doesnt work within a day or two u need to get pitocin... u need to get that baby out now!!!<br>  <br>  good luck and i hope i helped

Anyways, I personally would just have to know because I'm such a little planner/organizer.  Everyone is different though and it's really entirely up to you.  Best wishes! =)|`|7fPuUT3Daa	well ive always had to know the sex lol i liked buying the stuff and all that, but your Sooo Close now it would be a little more fun to wait. Best Luck.|`|cyTlkoAYaa	If you have the time and the money I say go for it!!! <br>  You will be better prepared like you said and you can tell everyone what you are having also....|`|c5AJGcYcaa	Go for it girl! <br>  <br>  Find one tho that you can get 3 or 4 D's! <br>  <br>  Good luck!!!|`|LfZk2NGBaa	I would wait it out.|`|lvGSEvjSaa	Well if you want to be prepared, with baby stuff. But if you can wait...I would wait...it would be exciting~!|`|1OSo4nofaa	wait, then it will be a huge surprise          that's how my parents found out, when we popped out|`|azE51WGRaa	If you really can't wait, then I say go for it! But in the meantime, maybe try some fun things to predict the gender. Here's some you can try:<br>  Tie a ring (preferably one that belongs to you. It doesn't have to be a wedding ring, just any ring) onto a string and hang it 1 in about your bare belly button. (You can have someone do this for you). If it swings in circles, it's a girl. If it swings back and forth, it's a boy.<br>  Try going to one of those chinese calendar sites, put in your age and the month you conceived, and see what it says. <br>  You may be able to tell what you're having by the way you're carrying your baby (the way your bump looks). If it's really up high, myth says you're having a girl. If it's down lower, then you're having a boy....<br>  Good luck and I hope you can try these out. They're not always accurate but they're fun and harmless =D|`|vdnn7tysaa	WAIT i really think it helps mentally with labor i and many others i have talked to it seems that when you don't know the sex labor can be shorter. basically because your in so much anticipation to find out. but none of this is proven. my husband and i chose not to find out and i loved having that surprise after all that waiting and pain and pushing. my family and friends were all convinced it was a boy (they were right) that they all bought boy clothes. i still got a lot of yellow and light green. but if they bought stuff they kept the receipts. hope i could help any. i really enjoyed the wait and we will wait next time too.
DnNkCF6Taa	I am Roman Catholic and my belief personally is that God is love, so whether a child or someone is gay, it wouldn't affect me at all.  I have some friends who are gay, and if I had a son or daughter that was gay I would support them 100%.|`|b6EyFLgUaa	I dont think it matters whos gay, as long as they are happy with they way they are living their lives. My foster brother growing up is gay and im very proud of him because he had the courage to step forward and admit it and now he is living a happy life. If my daughter told me she was gay i would support her, of course i would  be a little sad because she may never get to be pregnant but past that id be happy for her.|`|ko3Larigaa	If it was my kid I would prefer they knew someone gay but they are going to be who they want to be and like who they feel like liking.<br>  <br>  My guy friend is gay and I love him (of course as a friend) <br>  <br>  I am only 14 so you may not take what I say seriously but still.<br>  <br>  There still people either way and they are still like everyone else just a different sexual preference|`|GomqF0bfaa	I honestly wouldn't care what my son grew up to be as long as it wasn't hurting him physically or mentally. And love is love. I have friends that are gay and an uncle that is gay and I don't hold it against them at all.|`|pfJorlTIaa	Who cares either way? I know gay people.  Too each is own.  And as long as my children are happy, whatever....|`|TQW5E6olaa	Doesn't matter either way to me, it's about they are not who they sleep with.|`|M6c0hUefaa	Which would be better?...Well, I don't really care what anyone's sexual orientation is. I couldn't care less and no, it wouldn't hurt me. Yes, it would take getting used to, but I wouldn't love my child or friend/relative any less. No, it's not against my religion.|`|AA10953561	I know many gay people and it doesn't bother me in the least. If either of my daughters turn out to be gay I will love them just the same and I won't try to change them.<br>  <br>  For a lot of people it is about religion, and for others they just don't understand why so many members of the gay community "flaunt" their sexuality. I've had this talk with my family many times. My parents believe being gay is wrong because of their religious beliefs, as does my sister. My brothers are both disgusted by "Gay Pride" and don't know what to make of people who are so proud of what they consider to be a very private issue. <br>  <br>  In my opinion, you should be proud of who you are no matter what religion, ethnicity, or sexual orientation you are.|`|ZSSUfSXwaa	Well I know some people who are gay not friends, but actual neighbours whose children attend the same school as mine. (they're two women)<br>  Now as for my religion or personal views we encourage our children to grow up and form a family the way it's supposed to be, the "old fashioned way" if you wanna say that.<br>  I want my son to find a girl when he grows up and marry her and form a family, I would like my daughter to know what it is to love her husband and to have children... and it's what God intended for us.<br>  However I do not have anything against them, it is my personal belief that there must have been something in their childhood that marked them in order for them to be Gay. It is a tough subject to get into...<br>  <br>  Bottom line... I do not wish my children to be gay at all, we're raising them in a religion and environment where Marriage and Family are the desired goals.|`|R2OMEjrhaa	It really wouldn't matter to me. I would prefer that my daughter no be gay, but if that how she turns out that is fine. she will always be my daughter and I will accept her for who she is, not who I or any body else thinks that she should be. And as for friends I had a best friend in high school that was. And I had no problem with it. She was open about it, and we never had any problems.|`|rBq189W1aa	No biggie either way. <br>  <br>  So what if it's against somebody's religion? That makes about as much sense as being left-handed being against somebody's religion. If somebody feels they need to choose between their religion and their own child, maybe they need to rethink their religion.
HqOkC2YHaa	I make 6 oz bottles and it lasts me from 5-7 days depending on if she's going through a growth spurt or not. And she also eats Similac, not sure if the scoops are differant sizes for other brands<br>  <br>  edit: figured I'd share this but if you're feeding the advance with the omega 3 and 6 here's a 5$ off coupon from their site...not sure if you can use it in the states, but its worth a try. I buy my forumla at walmart and I buy the Go and Grow (the green step 2 can) and they let me use the 5$ off coupon on that also just because it's the same company and most people don't read that it has to be the exact one in the picture. I guess they just read the Similac in big writing and figure it's the same lol<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pharmacommunications.ca/swaccouponsE.php?csource=csparentsscan" rel="nofollow">http://www.pharmacommunications.ca/swacc...</a><br>  <br>  I printed off a whole bunch just incase they pull it off the web and the coupon is good until March 2010|`|8lcNupM2aa	By 5 months or so my son was up to 6 cans a month. By around 7 months he was up to 10 cans a month.  <br>  <br>  The bad thing about formula is a lot of it gets wasted. If they don't drink it all within a certain time frame you have to pour it out.<br>  <br>  I was breastfeeding my son at that age so I can't really give you a good estimate but just wanted to let you know what to expect later down the line.|`|484aa84c7353614d3c09a00144730894aa	if your trying to budget...breastfeed :) It's best anyway|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	I don't mean to be stupid but I can't find a record or a 900g or 31.7oz can size? <br>  <br>  The average formula fed baby takes 2-3oz per lbs of body weight per day, to a maximum of 32oz, and most babies stay near the max once they get there.  I can't find a yield for that can size.
vrt8bMzVaa	I'm on zoloft too I was at the breaking point before they got me stabilized for it.so if you think you might be having it get to a doctor soon it takes a while for the medication to get in your system,and it seems to just sneak up on you|`|m1RTNmqsaa	Im not sure.<br>  <br>  My little girl is just 2 weeks and sometimes the little things make me sad and cry. Ive also realized me and my fiance are constantly arguing.|`|F3dWvVy5aa	I had PPD severely before, not now, I am 7 months pregnant this time and really happy. But I swear get some meds if you can, sometimes the serotonin levels in your brain drop after a baby and you feel depressed. I'm glad you brought it up, at least you are aware something isn't right..You can change your future if your aren't happy also. they have daycare assistance and if you are just starting out in a job( going out to work is a lifesaver) they don't charge you a daycare fee, it will be free. Then after a few paychecks its based on a sliding scale fee.That is offered from your state welfare system type thing. Or if you can afford daycare on you own then get out of the house, go to work, it gives you your own money or even just go back to college.|`|uNvF299Caa	I had the baby blues. I had it till I could finally go back to work.  I think it's normal.  <br>  <br>  We love them. We would do anything for them.  But it's so hard to just basically not have a life anymore.  It was just hard to do anything, because they depend so much from us.<br>  <br>  Now my boy is 14 months. I'm back to school and working part time.  I don't feel the blues anymore.  He stays with the baby sitter in the morning, we spend the afternoons together and I work at night when he's in bed and my husband puts him to bed. :) <br>  <br>  How old is your baby?|`|1NIFJaThaa	I definately had the baby blues. My son is 2 mths now , the first couple of weeks I was a basket case. I cried for nearly every and anything and it didn't help that my family is in another country.

You can read up on <a href="http://first-time-mom-baby.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://first-time-mom-baby.blogspot.com/</a> for anything baby related as well.|`|3hIr3Dllaa	I'm on Zoloft to deal with my PPD|`|culQRXw2aa	Hi, It takes time to get use to the massive change in lifestyle that has occured. Sometimes it just seems so unfair that the mom gets lumped with all the responsibility of day to day ho hum stuff! I really no were you are coming from kinda feels like ground hog day over and over again but in the middle of this is your little one growing (at a very fast pace which we sometimes forget).<br>  <br>  Try and make time for you even if its a causal job or going out joining a mums group of people the same age and you get to be an adult for sometime and possiblty chat with others who are going through the same thing. I have continued with my work whilst caring for my two young kids. I feel down some days but the little ones if even they are been really difficult still manage to make me have a little smile on face every now and then and I feel proud of what I have achieved by the end of the day (its always the little things) <br>  <br>  Baby steps in time it gets better don't be so hard on your self. If you feel the symptoms becomimg worse please see your Dr who will refer you for some counselling all the best!
KSUPtqCaaa	Just a suggestion, but maybe you can get a twin sized mattress and place it on the floor in their room. Then just let them sleep together.<br>  <br>  If they have trouble falling asleep, or they wake up, you can lie in their bed with them until they fall back to sleep.|`|b6EyFLgUaa	Id move them both so that one doesn't feel like the favorite or anything. Id buy a big boy bed for the 2 year old ( thats what we did with our daughter to get her out of our bed) and let them both pick out new blankets for the beds. Then move them, make it a move that needs to stay put. Dont allow them back in your bed till after 6 in the morning.|`|uaHzhUeoaa	You should definitely move both kids at the same time, otherwise one of them will feel hurt and mistreated.  If you could do it gradually, that might be ideal. Like don't move them out entirely yet...maybe move their cribs to your room, then a little farther away each night.|`|CABw51hkaa	buy a small bed and have them sleep by your bed that way you have your space|`|W2wECodqaa	2 years old is a little too big let the 1 years old have the bed|`|Fd4lITkvaa	Move them both to there own bed together if that's an option. If they need someones company they can have each other. If you want to move them to separate beds still keep them sleeping in the same room. The No Cry Sleep Solution might be helpful. You can put a twin mattress in your room to start and get one of them to sleep on it. After he/she is use to sleeping on their own mattress you can move them to there own room.|`|VS78dqO9aa	Don't just do one!!!  Do both!  It's time.  And it wouldn't be fair if you do just one.  Start by trying to move them in their room after they fall asleep, then maybe trying to sleep in their room with them for a little bit.  then once they understand hey, no more sleeping with mom, then they are probably going to throw a fit, at that point follow SUPERNANNY rules.  Watch her show!  It's awesome.  I can't remember all the steps, but I'll be glad to email them to you, I have one recorded on my DVR!!!
PwhrTNZraa	No, baby is fine....I actually asked my Dr if my cold would affect my baby at all because I had it for so long (5weeks) and it was REALLY bad, I was even checked for pneumonia.  I coughed and coughed until I choked and threw up a few times so I was really unsure how straining all those muscles could "harm" anything, but my Dr said not to worry.<br>  <br>  This all started when I was about 12weeks along, I'm now 20weeks, have heard a very strong healthy heartbeat twice and seen a very healthy baby on ultrasound.  Don't feel silly!!  This is my second pregnancy and even I questioned it!!|`|p4R1c6fraa	You are not hurting the baby.You may get a burst blood vessel which is why the books talk about bloody noses when pregnant.I just got over a bad head cold and a couple days after it was better I had a prenatal visit.The heart beat was strong.You are so sweet to worry about your little angel.God bless you.17 weeks with m first too.|`|vWb8fquvaa	Be careful!!!! You may blow your baby out of your *** if you blow too hard!<br>  <br>  LOL seriously blowing your nose is perfectly safe!|`|GAxJNvxmaa	not at all! your baby is protected by the fluid :)|`|46cd2ca02c07674e58e26d9c11367762aa	Nope your baby is so protected in there, no amount of blowing your nose will hurt him or her. Your baby is floating around in a lot of fluid. That fluid can protect them from so many things. <br>  No worries.. blow your nose as much, or as hard as you want. Baby is sitting happy, hanging out.|`|3hIr3Dllaa	Are you serious?  <br>  <br>  OF COURSE NOT!!!!|`|p2Njf5gBaa	Nope,  your baby is safetly insulted in fluid and it won't hurt them at all. <br>  <br>  I had  a terrible cold when I was 8 months along,  I coughed constantly for a few days start,  I was so afraid I was shaking my baby too much,  so your question isn't silly.|`|IFDfpbFJaa	No, your baby is fine in there.

I almost didn't take my son because he calmed down but every-time I would rub his head he would scream bloody murder so I took him in and as I said he had a minor skull fracture so just watch him and see.|`|kH4Lb0ztaa	i think every mum everywhere has a story of how the baby fell of the bed or got dropped on the floor etc. i certainly have, i am sure he is just fine, but if you are seriously concerned take him to the local dr just to get him checked over, But honestly i am sure he is fine.|`|ZVUrLZpXaa	Did he fall on carpeting?If so,he will probably be ok.Hard wood floor or tile would leave a greater chance for injury.If he shows ANY unusual signs...sleeping more,eating less,etc...see a paediatrician immediately.|`|F3dWvVy5aa	Mine fell once. It scared me to death, it does happen especially if they figure out they call roll over even if by accident.. My doctor said everything was okay, you can call doctor if you like. That is what they are there for especially stuff like a newborn fall. I am sure your baby is fine though, they are tough little critters  :)|`|uNvF299Caa	Oh, I'm sorry!  <br>  <br>  If he looks like his usual self he should be just fine, if you are too worried you can take him to see his doctor.<br>  <br>  My niece fell when she was five months old, it's was a high cabinet, my sister freak out and took her to the doctor, but she was just fine.<br>  <br>  My husband said he let our baby on the couch while he was making a sandwich (he was 4 months), when he came back the baby was on the floor. But our couch is not that tall. I had warned him that we should never leave the baby without pillows around, because we never know when he learn something knew, he never listens.  At least he learned his lesson. <br>  <br>  It's ok. Don't worry.  We are all still learning.  :)|`|vLOjcH7paa	Don't panic!<br>  My hubby was watching our 5 month old the other day and he too fell, completely accidental. Our ped called our house like 5 times to ck on him...it's been a week and Thank God he is ok! : )<br>  Don't worry...call the ped, explain what happened, and see what he/she suggests.<br>  He told us to look for signs of high pitched crying, bumps or red marks, fussiness, etc.|`|rpjnAhIIaa	Not to me personally as i don't have kids of my own, but with what happened i am so sorry it breaks my heart, and accident's should'nt exist they such horrible things lol. <br>  <br>  but that's part of life i guess ;) ,  mistake's, accident's and consequences yep.|`|MFWEkkd9aa	Awww, poor little thing, as long as he is ok, I wouldn't worry about it too much, there is no point of thinking about what could've happened, but didn't, you'll just upset yourself even more :)<br>  <br>  Take care you, Lulu x|`|jLI0IgWkaa	so did mine, more than once, 10 years ago, and she's perfectly fine today.<br>  <br>  If he is fine now, just make sure he doesn't fall asleep within the next hour, and he'll for sure be fine.|`|oDWskgBOaa	awww poor thing my niece fell out of the chair when she was a few months old my sister was changing her and next thing she knew she was on the floor but she was fine just scared|`|aLAmvX5Naa	All babies fall of the bed/couch/something in the first 2 years of their life.

LOL Ok ok, I couldn't help myself...|`|azE51WGRaa	The baby is in your lower stomach. But as your uterus grows, it pushes all of your internal organs upwards to make room for the growing baby. This is probably the reason your upper stomach is harder.|`|lvGSEvjSaa	Well you won't really feel anything yet as of right now.... But the baby is sitting in your lower abdomen, but it will get bigger ans soon you will be able to feel the baby!|`|AA10953561	Your baby is lower than that. Actually, at this point your uterus is safely surrounded by your pelvis and hips and if you were to try to find it you wouldn't feel feel it because it's so low. It finally starts popping up into your lower abdomen around week 12 of pregnancy. What your cousin is probably feeling is your bloated tummy and intestines. You may not be noticing the bloat yet, but it does start pretty early. Your body is gearing your metabolism up to consume more nutrients at a faster pace in order to sustain both you and the baby for the next seven months. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps. Good luck and congratulations!|`|ntdGOZqGaa	The baby will be in the lower tummy area for a while until it gets bigger and takes up more room.

MqFeJiukaa	Sounds like pre labor.  Those are all signs labor is near.  Good Luck|`|dq7nvrfhaa	It sounds like you could be in the early stages of labor.Keep timing your contractions.Happy pushing hon!
z7bW8v9qaa	Early labor contractions aren't usually sharp.  They are kinda like hugs, a little warm at the back and the tightness moves from back to front, but not painful or sharp...  That said, everyone's labor is different.  <br>  As you know you have lots of the classic symptoms of being 40 weeks pregnant and ready to give birth.<br>  <br>  I started off with textbook contractions with my two youngest kiddos at 41 weeks.  I couldn't sleep the night before I went into labor.  I had energy and I felt really good all day.  With my second pregnancy I took my 2 yr old out to see friends I was sure we wouldn't get to see for a while.  We ran all the errands and finished up the "before the baby" stuff.  After a long day, I started having gentle contractions at dinner.  We went into the birthing center around midnight when they were 4 min apart.  I was already 4 cm, but not in a hurry, and going in too early slowed up my labor a bit, made the contractions space out again.  He wasn't born until 10 am.  With my third, I had an appt with my midwife and drove an hour both ways to see her by myself.  It was a loud music singing along feeling great kinda day, ya know?  She stripped my membrane (wish like hell she hadn't) and I had a contraction on the freeway on the way home.  When I got home I had contractions all evening.  They started out stronger than in previous labors, but got closer slowly.  They started 20 minutes apart and stayed that way for 4 hours or so, then 15 min, then 10.  Finally at 12 ish we started calling people.  (5 min apart)  The midwife, my mom and my sister got there at 1:30, when we told them it was time to come over (4 min apart).   He was born at 6 am.<br>  <br>  I had the textbook early labor contractions, but no loose stools.  I went more than usual those days- like going twice when I usually go once.  I was energetic, sleepless and very (um) sexually excited, even once labor was established.  No upset stomach either, although I did throw up with all of them.  So everyone is different...
46cd2ca02c07674e58e26d9c11367762aa	Theyll check any incisions you might have had. If you had a csection theyll check that, or if youve had an episiotomy theyll check that. Theyll also give you a pap test to make sure everything is healthy, and theyll check your stomach to make sure your uterus went back down into place. <br>  I would let your doctor know that you think you may be pregnant again, and Im sure he/she will order blood tests for you. <br>  Congrats on your new little one.|`|WPI0Z47saa	An internal exam to make sure you healed up ok. This is the smae if you had either a vaginal or c-section delivery.|`|AkHj5xeSaa	They'll do an internal exam and check to make sure your uterus is back in shape. If you think you're pregnant, just ask them to test you and I'm sure they will.|`|jYPeis3Saa	they usually don't do blood work, unless they feel its necessary for whatever reason.<br>  <br>  i didn't have any blood work done. just a vaginal check (which by the was was really weird since i had a c-section. i only dilated to 2 cm during my 20hr labor) , asked how i was feeling/doing and that was it. <br>  <br>  <br>  you actually should not have sex before the 6-8 week check up. your body needs time to heal, and by doing so you can cause an infection.|`|Hcj8k1bXaa	Usually it's just a quick pelvic exam to make sure everything has healed up properly, but you can defiantly request some blood work done.  At my six week I got my doc to do a pee test for me because I was worried that I was pregnant again too.  :)|`|ntdGOZqGaa	Well they will check and make sure that your uterus is going back to how it was before you got pregnant, they will most likely talk to you about birth control, and make sure you are healing the way you are suppose to. You can ask them to do a pregnancy test again. Good luck|`|vWb8fquvaa	Examine you, whether it be your incision from a c-section or your vagina to be sure you are healy properly if you had a vaginal birth. <br>  <br>  No blood work at my appt but you can always ask for it.|`|wNtW1hXLaa	hi! the 6-8 week check is just to chek in with you and see that everything is going along smoothly, check that your uterus is going down back to normal size, tears are healing, do a pap smear if you are due and a breast examination. As far as i know there are no bloods taken but you can request this yourself.|`|7fPuUT3Daa	Well they didn't do anything to me really, i went in and she asked if i was doing ok and what birth control method i wanted to use and checked my blood pressure, i might have peed in a cup for them but i dint remember. Well i hope you want to be  pregnant lol man i would have a heart attack thats too soon for me but hey what works for some dosent for others. Best Luck|`|LfZk2NGBaa	Normally it is to make sure you are healed and to give you the okay on sex again...looks like you jumped the gun on that one.
S0n3DinFaa	Find friends that are the 4 year olds age, have them over to play once in a while too!<br>  <br>  Ask your older son to include your 4 year old some times too.  If all else fails, you play with the little guy while the bigger boys do something else!!!|`|DnNkCF6Taa	There is another thought, there can be a time when your older son goes and stays over at his friend's house and your younger son has his friends over to yours.  That will give each of them a chance to shine in their perspective places and also ensure that while your younger son may not have the same outgoing nature, he wouldn't have to worry to compete for attention if his older brother was elsewhere.... not sure if that would help, but you could always give it a try... and as he talks with his friends more, that might make him more confident and willing to have the two groups mingle again as he knows that his own friends better.|`|VS78dqO9aa	find something else that the younger may enjoy better.  Helping in the kitchen.  He obviously doesn't want to play with them, is he actually upset or are you just over reacting?  Does he come to you upset? Or does it just bother you that notice your oldest child playing more?  Ask your 4 yr old what he wants to do?? Or maybe have two friends over, one from each of their classes, or maybe have a playdate just with him and have your oldest son gone with another friend or a day out with dad or something.  Then your youngest son has no choice but to get involved.  It'll just take time.  Don't push!|`|jLI0IgWkaa	teach him to stick up for himself. role play, and the first time around you be him, and let him act out your 6 yr old, and show him different techniques he can use to get what he wants, when he gets the hang of it switch role plays so he can practice his part, so he'll have confidence when speaking up for himself when friends come over.<br>  <br>  good luck .
WPI0Z47saa	After the first birthday.|`|pXSKSS3daa	Our son turned 11 months on the 4th and will be fully weaned onto cow's milk by Monday((I'm sure). There isn't anything "magic" about turning a year old, it's just best to wait until around that time(does not have to be the exact day) so your baby's system can tolerate it.<br>  <br>  I would start by introducing small amounts to your baby. Either with breastmilk/formula or by itself. Our son is on formula and normally would drink 5 oz. So the first couple of days we did 4 oz. formula and 1 oz. milk. The next two days we did 3 oz. formula and 2 oz. milk. Now we're at 2 oz. formula and 3 oz. milk. He's done well so far(no bad reactions such as constipation or diarrhea) and it doesn't seem to bother him at all.|`|Hcj8k1bXaa	LOL  I guess I'm a terrible mom.  I started introducing milk at about 9 and a half months and had her completely switched over by 11 months.  Same with a sippy cup, had her off the bottle and onto a cup at the same time.  She's perfectly healthy and suffering no ill affects. :)|`|AA11134717	I tried my baby on whole milk at around 10-11months and she liked it and her first birthday she was completely off formula.<br>  have you ever tried formula (lol) they will love something different i Promise.|`|QzOCkKGjaa	Make sure you use hormone free milk and wait as long as you can.....cow milk isn't that great for kids or adults....and after the 1 year mark.|`|3hIr3Dllaa	One year, not before|`|TYErFAAzaa	We started our youngest at about 11 months.  They say 1 but he didn't have any problems with his digestion or anything so.|`|q84KT11saa	One year, no sooner.|`|YsvpLwy6aa	one year old. never before. but i would get permission from your doctor first
g2GogSALaa	Kaya Jay and Noraline Sadie Jay are the best.<br>  <br>  Felish?<br>  That sounds like fetish....<br>  or some exotic dressing.<br>  Probably because it rhymes with relish.<br>  <br>  <br>  Yeahhh, I'm not a fan of those names, but if your sister really likes unique names, then she should go for it :]<br>  You should remind her to pick something somewhat sensible, or else the girl is going to grow up and be picked on or hating her name.|`|IFDfpbFJaa	I would express that you don't like the names and then let it go. it's her baby and her names. My sister is about to name her baby an awful name but she's dead set on it and there's nothing anyone can do to change her mind. It'll just make her pissy when you keep pressing it|`|ot0TqzSvaa	Kaya is cute, but not with Jay.<br>  Kaya Noraline Jay?? I dont mind that...<br>  <br>  Hervan is GROSS, Noraline isnt great, Felish is BAD, Oranne is too close to Orange, and Anthony is much too boyish.<br>  <br>  So, yeah, Kaya gets my vote!<br>  <br>  ? Bee|`|6SwaWSoyaa	I like Noraline Sadie. I would like Kate Noraline even better or Sadie Noraline. The rest are just stupid.|`|R2OMEjrhaa	I like Kaya the best but I am not a big fam of any of them. <br>  <br>  Allyson<br>  Autumn<br>  Hannah<br>  Madelyn<br>  Mya<br>  Mia<br>  Isabel<br>  Natalia<br>  Rileigh|`|HBgnkltfaa	Yikes!<br>  <br>  The best by far is Kaya Jay.  Kaia is a Norwegian variant of Katherine, and Kaya seems to be a Native American name.  It feels a little trendy, thanks to all the Kayla's and Kylie's, but at least it's legitimate and rather pretty.<br>  <br>  I like the sound of Noraline, but it's such an obvious mish-mash name that it's a bit bizarre.  Why not just Nora or Eleanora?  Or why not Caroline, Coraline, or Aveline?<br>  <br>  Other suggestions that are less odious:<br>  <br>  Haven instead of Hervan<br>  Ailis (AY-lish) or Eilis (EYE-lish) instead of Felish<br>  Orianna or Orianne instead of Oranne<br>  Amelie or Annelie (AH-nuh-lee) instead of Anthony|`|fJTjE8j8aa	i like kaya jay and noraline the best. It sounds like she is interested in really interesting and uncommon names, so how about:<br>  Ayla (hebrew for oak tree)<br>  Ayelet (hebrew for deer)<br>  Aviva (means spring)<br>  Genna (arabic for small bird)<br>  Rae (means lamb)<br>  <br>  while i was looking up names, i saw that kaya is a name which implies the child is smart, so i like it even more :)|`|Lo5yiBqzaa	yeah those are all hideous.  she needs to drop Jay, it's not needed and it sounds awful, unless she goes with Kaya Jay, that's not so bad.    two middles names is pointless.<br>  <br>  Oranne isn't pretty at all.  Oriana is close and much nicer.<br>  <br>  Hervan sounds like a redneck trying to say Heaven, haha.|`|O3EtP4vOaa	Let her name the child whatever she wants, when you have a child you get to pick the name.  Once the baby is born call it a nickname...<br>  <br>  Hervan Kate Jay - Kate<br>  Noraline Sadie Jay- Nora<br>  Felish Katy Jay - Katy (Felish????omg...)<br>  Oranne Katy Jay - Anne or Katy<br>  Kaya Jay - KJ or Ky<br>  Anthony Jay - Toni<br>  <br>  It's not so bad....|`|QLC16aRCaa	i like katy Jay because it's the most normal ones.... it looks like she pulled the other names out of her butt|`|NqMx7YOtaa	Noraline Sadie Jay..thats really pretty.<br>  <br>  <br>  Noraline Kacie Jay is cute too|`|AOkucu5haa	I hope your sister's kidding.<br>  <br>  In fact, I hope you're kidding.|`|4mSpN3Rxaa	i like kaitie jay but kaleigh jay sounds good!|`|F2wI6NGNaa	its none of your bussiness get your own life|`|GomqF0bfaa	I believe that even though you might think that these are horrible names, but your sister aparently really likes them. In my opinion, they really aren't that bad. My first choice is Katy Jay, then Noraline Sadie Jay, Anthony Jay, Kaya Jay, and the rest I really don't care for. I think that though you don't like them, your sister does and she's going to make her own choices.|`|o6tLojhlaa	hmmm... well she obviously wants jay so why not jay at the begining ro if she likes something unique how about something like...<br>  serena jay <br>  belle jay<br>  natasha jay<br>  summer jay<br>  april jay<br>  she also seems to like katy so why not just katy jay thats normal<br>  and also kaya jay isnt terrible but the rest are awful and if that poor kid gets some of those names they are screwed for when they get to school and kids are mean|`|2ajtEFvsaa	I really like Kaya jay its pretty. Or Tyler jay (for a girl), Bailey Jay is pretty too.<br>  <br>  I hope that I helped.<br>  (And don't listen to those negative comments I think its wonderful that you are helping)|`|Dd8FU6y6aa	oh my... your right... those names ARE terrible...  of those, i like Kaya Jay. i really detest the name Anthony for a girl... i like sadie as well... <br>  <br>  <br>  try sadie jay  or kaya jay|`|59f3fb5349cc37c5db705b9e5de40dd1aa	How about Seven? Seven Costanza.<br>  <br>  or Mug...there's a good strong name.|`|Wchi6Xd4aa	uhm wow? i would vote AGAINST anthony for a girl.... i like Noraline.|`|hORVMOHKaa	its her baby she can name it whatever she wants, have your own

I would smoke anything that I could get my hands on really since I was only 14 and couldn't be that picky since I couldn't get the cigarettes myself. The brand that I smoked most frequently was Camel.<br>  <br>  I drink alcoholic beverages and have been doing so since I was 13 years old (took my first shot at 13, first time drunk at 14, first drinking party at 15). I just love alcohol in general so I pretty much drink anything. My favorite beer is miller chill but I also like busch, I like mike's hard lemonade, I like green apple and raspberry smirnoff but I need to mix it with stuff, and I love malibu, I'm not a huge fan of jeiger but with the right combination of jeiger and red bull its an ok drink.<br>  <br>  I have never done any drugs and I don't ever plan on doing drugs.|`|3y0w1qIBaa	No, No, No and I am not planning.|`|rsYbDHWRaa	smoking - ew no. my dad and my uncle smoke and i hate it so much! plus they would shoot me if they ever found out i was doing it haha. <br>  <br>  drinking - ive done it a few times, but ive only been buzzed. i dont really like it, i think its kinda pointless. besides, my uncle was an alcoholic and from what ive seen, i have an extremely addictive personality so i dont want to chance developing an addiction too.<br>  the few times i have done it, ive only had smirnoff/bacardi vodka and a couple different brands of coolers. <br>  <br>  drugs - never! most people i know do weed, coke and ecstasy. where i live you pretty much just have to assume that everyone you meet has at least done weed until they tell you otherwise. i just think its stupid on so many levels, not to mention a complete waste of money and time.|`|dXDroPtfaa	No to drinking and drugs.<br>  <br>  I do hookha once in awhile.<br>  It depends on the restaurant I go to-for the flavour.|`|BBfIXcI0aa	I don't smoke or do drugs, but I'll drink every now and then - very rarely, responsibly, and in moderation.

7srXwLZcaa	Asking that question, nobody has the right to put their hands on another human being, think constructively, there are planty of other options that work much better.|`|rid4brOnaa	This is a rather tough question. Firstly, every child is different. Some need a spanking immediately because he/she won't listen to reason. Others may need a spanking after other methods stop working. <br>  <br>  Secondly, the severity of the spanking needed may differ from one child to the next. Children don't really learn to fear their parents, but they do learn to fear a spanking. <br>  <br>  Lastly, a spanking isn't the cure-all that parents would like it to be, but it does reinforce what the parents have been trying to teach their child. <br>  <br>  My list: Flagrant lying. Stealing. Skipping school. Physically bullying. Outright defiance. Cussing at a parent. Smoking. Drinking.|`|P5Iq6nufaa	Direct defiance and disobedience<br>  Serious backtalk, i.e., cursing at parents or another adult<br>  Lying<br>  Stealing<br>  <br>  Those are, in my opinion, the main things that would warrant a spanking.|`|VS78dqO9aa	I don't think it's a list of actual things, it's the reaction to discipline in getneral.  Every child is different, and every parent is different.  Everyone has to find their own way that works witht their own child..Although, many people should spank, because their method isn't work AT ALL!!!  They just think it does, and actually their kids are the brats that no one wants to invite for play dates....  But honestly I do, Warning 1-verbally Time out and then a spanking.  It works for my daughter, but would never work for my nephew.  He on the other hand doesn't respond to spankings, he just screams "don't hit me" and gets angry and makes the situation 10 times worse!|`|qPbKJeXzaa	I am surprised that modern parents don't have more parenting skills than previous generations.  My father was hit by his father, even with any object in his hand.  It taught my father to hate his father.  Fortunately, my father learned what NOT to do as a parent and he didn't hit me and I didn't hit my children.<br>  <br>  Hitting children causes them to be fearful, to lie in order to avoid being hit, to run away, and often teaches them to hit other children.<br>  <br>  Hitting children doesn't teach them any new appropriate behaviours.<br>  <br>  If you want to change the behaviour of your child, then you have to change your own. Are you aware that a child needs at least 4 positive events/comments/reinforcements to every negative one? And by negative I'm not talking about hitting, I'm talking about negative remarks and put-downs.|`|j0Jkq4z2aa	defiance, backtalk, cursing, disobedience, doing drugs, cheating, stealing, lying.....<br>  too many things too count|`|in7qi4oZaa	Cursing<br>  Talking Back<br>  Not following directions|`|DnNkCF6Taa	Lying, Cheating, Stealing, Doing Drugs, Drinking and Driving, Cursing at a Parent, Failing Classes... pretty much there a lot of things in my mind that may deserve a spanking, but I tend to use a lot of scolding, corner time, groundings as well, it depends on the degree of the behavior and how often it happens whether something deserves a scolding or a spanking... though the ones above are the ones that without a doubt always will earn a spanking, especially Lying.<br>  <br>  <br>  As far as how I say the behavior differs for a spanking to be earned, I tend to more often than not ask the child/young adult why they are misbehaving and trying to figure out what is going on.  That way I can see how things are going and say, well just so you know that is not acceptable behavior so why don't we try this instead, then if they turn around and do it again an hour later then a swat/little spanking if they are younger and bigger spanking if they are older.<br>  <br>  Though I tend to talk things out before I ever give any discipline, whether it be spanking or otherwise.<br>  <br>  *****As always there will be those that will say that there is no reason to spank a child and while that might help you with what you want as I believe you asked if your discipline is fair... it doesn't seem to have caused any issues for the generations it was used...if used by a loving parent that can do so calmly*****|`|6EXOZu6Vaa	i have little guys.<br>  lying<br>  my 6 year old is a monster so i spank him or put him in timeout for any of these things. he slaps my wife, steals from me and his mom, spits on us, and back talking and he learned some new words and he knows he will get it if he says any
p4R1c6fraa	You named all my early symptoms.My nipples are still killing me and I'm at 17 weeks.When I towel off after a shower,the towel hurts them.The boobs may catch up too.If you haven't taken a test yet then get on it.As soon as you know for sure then get to the doctor so you can start caring for the baby now.God bless.|`|ntdGOZqGaa	Well your tummy wouldnt be hard at 10-11 weeks pregnant that comes later and yes sore nipples instead of boobs is one of the signs. I'm 35 weeks pregnant and mine still kill me, I dont wear a bra unless I have to bc it hurts so bad. Good luck|`|vZwJyqc6aa	Sounds like you are pregnant! Take a test!|`|AA11831450	Congratulations! You definately sound pregnant. I assume you have stopped menstuating? Bumpy sore nipples are a sign. Take a test to be certain. Your Doc will put you on prenatal vitamins right away to help the baby so just in case, don't delay.|`|UfhE3k1baa	You should def. take a test. I am 8 weeks and my nipples hurt worse then my breasts themselves.
AA10953561	I think most doctors prefer a natural child birth no matter your size. It's simply easier to heal from a vaginal delivery versus a c-section. I started my pregnancy heavy and when I talked to my doctor about the chances of a c-section he said that he didn't see any reason that I'd need one. He did say that if the baby was in any danger they would of course immediately do a c-section, but he made it sound like a vaginal birth is exactly what he wants (and what I want too) for me.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps! Good luck!|`|jYPeis3Saa	i would htink anyone would prefer a natural birth. better for mom and baby.<br>  <br>  im overweight, and had a c-section, no because of my weight, but because my son had a knot in his cord, i didn't dilate past 2cm even after 20hrs. of labor and he was in distress. <br>  <br>  i tried really hard to have him naturally thought.|`|46cd2ca02c07674e58e26d9c11367762aa	Im not sure that they have a preference. I know heavier women on both sides of the spectrum. Some have had natural births, while others have had c sections. <br>  I have had all c sections, but I dont think that has anything to do with my size at all.|`|XrKviWgSaa	it has nothing to do with weight, if your pregnancy is at higher risk they will do a c section or if the baby is breech (head up) or if your pelvis is not wide enough for the baby to pass.|`|apSTH4TIaa	Most docs will shoot for the natural birth.  I was 250 pounds when i delivered my 4th baby so i am considered morbidly obese.  I delivered all 4 natural and with no pain meds.  Unless there is a medical reason for your c section then no.  Good luck.|`|aLAmvX5Naa	I didn't know it made a difference. One of my best friend's sister is around 300 lbs and had all 5 kids vaginally. I would guess they would try for a vaginal birth if possible.|`|m2aznd8xaa	i dont think weight is an issue. it depends on how your pregnancy has been going. if everything is normal and your not at risk for anything  than the dr will allow you to go into labor naturally. if you dont seem to progress after a certain amount of time during labor or if baby is in distress than a c section will be done. good luck
fs5mVI33aa	Its hard to explain to a 6 year old that Mommy has enough love for her and the new baby. Just make sure that when the new baby comes, you set aside some "mommy an me" time for you and your daughter, because the baby will take up a lot of your time an attention and your daughter may feel neglected. Try to get her involved in things like feeding the baby, bath time, and even changing diapers. You could start now by explaining to her that he can hear her in your womb. Encourage her to talk to him, maybe even read to him. My daughter was three when I had my oldest son and she fell in love with him the moment she saw him. She was always trying to be a little mommy, feeding burping changing diapers (only wet ones tho lol). The cutest thing ever was when she was sitting in his little infant car seat with him on her chest rocking him back forth an patting his back (like she saw me do in the rocking chair all the time.) As far as her thinking her little brother will hate her, just keep reassuring her that she is going to be the BEST big sister ever and that her little brother will love her as much as you do. And keep reassuring her that even tho brother will take up a lot of your time it doesnt mean you love her any less. 6 is young, but maybe not too young to try explain to her that new babies are a lot of work. Let her help you with anything that is baby related, like picking out clothes and other baby things. Let her know that this is not just your baby, but her baby as well (and dad's too of course). The best thing to do is listen to the things she has to say and just keep reassuring her that yes things are going to change, but that change is not a bad thing.|`|Zac11eYCaa	okay i no im only 15 and this might not help much but i was 4 when my mom had my brother and i didnt like him at all at first i was always acting up just to get more attention i even broke my arm and always told my mom that she was mine first and he had to share. i grew out of it though in about a month...so i think once he gets there she will be fine and relize u still care for her just as much as you did before|`|IFDfpbFJaa	Go to the bookstore and find some books about how to introduce another child into the family and some that you can read with her in the children's section about it. That works wonders. It's a great way to bond with her and to make her feel more calm about the baby. She'll love a bed time story about a baby brother. <br>  Good Luck!|`|jLI0IgWkaa	tell her that for the first year of his life the baby will for sure not hate her, especially if she is gentle with him, and always kind to him. and the more kind she is to him, the more he will love her. also tell her that as much as you love her now, you will continue loving her after the baby comes, and though you will need to spend time feeding the baby and bathing the baby, you will also make time for her. she can sit next to you, and play card games or board games with you, while you are feeding the baby.
Ybo6HS8Caa	Wear condoms ALWAYS, even if she's been on birth control for a year!  Birth control is not 100% effective, and if she is on the pill, there's always the chance that she might forget to take it one day, or if she is ever on an antibiotic it can lower the effectiveness of birth control.  Trust me on this, I have two kids, and was using birth control both times.<br>  <br>  Secondly, you should always use condoms because they will help protect you from STD's.  I do not care if she's a virgin, if you think she would never cheat, whatever.....protect yourself.|`|256cVXsmaa	wait about a month to make sure it is fully in her system.<br>  I would wear condoms anyways though because I got pregnant on birth control, it isn't 100% but it is rare to get pregnant on it.<br>  If you aren't going to use condoms just make sure you wait that first month.|`|fgbgPx0Taa	The best birth control is abstinence.  That means not having sex.  If you abstain, you can not possible get her pregnant, and you can not possibly get a Sexually Transmitted Disease (STD).  It is the ONLY fool-proof way to protect both yourself and her.  Neither of you should be having sex until you are older, and preferably married.|`|SLSX6QQsaa	Umm wear condoms if you insist on having sex. You are too young though, you are 14 years old!  You should consider becoming a born again virgin.  Seriously.  You should not be having sex until you are able to handle the consequences of what might happen.  First of all, I highly doubt you even know enough about STDs among other things.  And pregnancy, well, tell me...how will you raise a baby at 14, or even 15?  You can't do it.  I've never met even a 17 year old that could raise a child on their own paycheck.  Please reconsider your choice to have sex.  It's not a good idea.|`|UHfA9yHPaa	You shouldn't be having sex when you're 14 or 15 anyways|`|5LR1RZelaa	The pill only prevents pregnancy.  It does not prevent disease.  Keep using the condoms kid.|`|c5AJGcYcaa	For one I will say I can't believe you are 14 years old and having sex.... No offense but as a mother that is disgusting and disturbing in my mind.<br>  <br>  On the flip side i do have to congratulate your gf on getting onto the birth control. But yes you should still wear condoms there are scary std's out there. <br>  <br>  Click on this link and decide if you don't think you should wear condoms anymore<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.herpes-coldsores.com/std/pictures.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.herpes-coldsores.com/std/pict...</a>|`|um8s6agzaa	should wear condoms, it would be safer not only for a pregnancy but also for diseases<br>  <br>  aren'T you a bit young?|`|cv222GL1aa	birth control has been known to not work. it happens very rarely but I highly recommend that if you don't want a child you should still wear condoms|`|ohj5sRpsaa	WEAR CONDOMS!!!!! Please, it doesn't start becoming active until the first month. Trust me on this. Wear condoms for a month (at least!).<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Please take the time to give this information to your girlfriend, and take caution to read it yourself. It's VERY important that you stay safe if you want to engage in sexual intercourse. <br>  <br>  ? With ALL BCPs, you want to do your level best to take your pill as close to the same time every day as is possible, ideally within a window of a few hours: if you do that, every day, then you're a perfect pill user -- that doesn't mean you get a gold star (unless you want one, in which case, by all means, star yourself), but it does mean that unless you have any other misuse (such as other drug interactions, or vomiting pills up, etc.) you can rest assured you have the highest effectiveness in terms of pregnancy protection possible from your pill. To simplify that, what's important is not that you take the pill at the EXACT same time every day (as in, "Oh god! I usually take it at 10:32, and it's 11:03!"), but at the same time of day: for instance, always in the morning.<br>  <br>  ? With ALL BCPs, to be as safe as possible, and in the interest of advocating for you to have as much protection as possible, it is strongly advised, especially for adolescents (for effectiveness but also because STIs are such a higher risk) to back up the pill with condom use when using the pill as birth control.<br>  <br>  ? With ALL BCPs, to be as safe as possible if you are NOT going to back up with condoms, we strongly advise you to wait one full month before using ONLY the pill as birth control, even though for many women, whether they Sunday start or start on the first day of their periods, the pill may likely be fully effective within seven days, and for some, even sooner. But if you have gone without a backup method in those first seven days and had sex with only the pill, it is advised to call your healthcare provider and ask about emergency contraception. You may also want to consider doing so if you went without a backup in that first cycle.<br>  <br>  ? With ALL BCPs, a "missed" pill is one that was not taken within 24 hours of the last pill you took. A missed pill should always be taken as soon as you realize you have missed it, but there is likely no risk from one missed pill or a need for EC. A "late" pill varies more in definition amoung various sources, and to some degree from pill to pill, but with any type of pill, if you have taken a pill more than 12 hours late, you may want to consider using a backup method of birth control for the rest of your cycle.<br>  <br>  ? With ALL pills if you have missed more than one pill, you will need to take the pills you missed when you missed them (so long as it is not more than three, in which case, with most pills, you'll want to wait until the following Sunday, then just start a new pack entirely, but use a backup for that cycle), and we'd advise a backup method of birth control until your next pill pack begins. If you have missed several pills and have had sex in that cycle without a backup method, we advise emergency contraception. When in doubt, always contact your healthcare provider or pharmacist.<br>  <br>  ? With ALL pills,read your pill packet information. Pills -- how they're taken, when effectiveness is compromised, what side effects and risks are most prevalent, and the best ways to take them -- can ALL differ from pill to pill. So, be sure if you're on the pill, to read those inserts and to talk to your healthcare provider prescribing the pill for you and ask ANY questions you have: there's just no reason to fly blind with your birth control.|`|gayDcP57aa	yes wear a condom always birth control isnt alway affective|`|J4wTIhsoaa	wear condoms, protect yourself from STDs and back up on the birth control.|`|af2136bcacd19dc5b2bab9b0737163c9aa	nooo even the doc willl tell your gf the first month wear a condom!!!|`|M961DkIjaa	It takes at least a month to work.  And, dude, you're too young though.|`|6TGCrO80aa	I assume you mean birth control pill. Yes, you should still wear a condom to protect both from HIV/AIDS and other diseases. I'm sure you and your girlfriend are serious about contraception but even as adults it is hard to remember to take the pill everyday. If she forgets it even once there is a chance you might end up with an unwanted pregnancy. Because of these two reasons you should still use a condom.|`|83bTxYA0aa	well condoms protect you in a lot of different ways...<br>  they keep u from disese and babys<br>  so far idk wat im talking about !!!!!!!!!!!<br>  all I know is that sex is awesome... if you dont have sex ull explode<br>  I suggest doing her every 3-7 minutes!!! dont break the bed.. I did that once and my partner flew away|`|JxO7EFEVaa	little young to be having sex in my opinion but that wont stop you.  make sure you let her know how importatn it is to you that she take it correctly and consistently.  def wear a condom- thats mature thinking!|`|4jEwPvUBaa	Always wear condoms just for that extra protection from STI's and pregnancy too.|`|a7088b93654b850a7346f43ab3d3ba5daa	Condoms are the only thing that protects you against STDs.  You should wear them.
ntdGOZqGaa	Yea more then likely that was the placenta from the baby. I too had a miscarriage and mine kinda looked like a chunk of liver. Good luck and I'm sorry for your loss|`|fUK9y3Qkaa	Sounds like either the baby or placenta. Did you save it? If so go to the hospital and take it with you. They will do a U/S and make sure it all came out. Sooo sorry for your loss!!!|`|AA11831450	Ohhh, so similar to me. I had my baby pass away but my body was too weak to miscarry. Eventually they had to do a procedure to remove the fetus. My babe died at 7 weeks and I was 14 weeks along when they "aborted" the pregnancy. The whole ordeal was horrible, but after reading your story, I'm relieved that I didn't have to go thru the miscarraige on my own like you did. The danger for you is not passing all of the tissue. You will need to be checked and given some kind of a shot or a d&c to be sure all is passed. Sadly, what you passed was most likely the placenta and your babe. The placenta is quite a bit bigger at first, and the fetus very small - less than cashew sized, connected to the placenta by the umbilical tube. If you still have the tissue you passed you should take it with you to a hospital or clinic. <br>  I'm so, so sorry for your loss.|`|m2aznd8xaa	it was probably the fetus or placenta if you didnt get  it taken out by the dr.  definatly call your dr if your concerned. so sorry for your lose

mx3YK5rLaa	Do what you are doing, it's going to take a while and it won't be easy. Look at it this way: can you imagine trying to get yourself on a new routine of staying up all night and sleeping all day? It would take you quite sometime to get used to it and you would probably be pretty fussy and cranky in the process. Your newborn is used to solid darkness (from being in the womb) and not having any set sleeping pattern. It will take some time but it can be done.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	dont' keep the baby up during the day to try to get them to sleep at night, that is foolish; nbs need A LOT of sleep, at night AND during the day....just keep going as you have with the light on in daytime, or sunlight; indirect sunlight; and darkness at night.....if you try to keep baby from napping you will have an overtired/overstimulated baby that will have a hard time sleeping at all....just let her sleep when she wants, soon she will settle herself and find her own schedule; for now , you just have to hang in there and follow her lead....sleep when she sleeps if you have to, you will still be exhausted, but a little better....this is a brand new environment, with so many differences from being couped up in a uterus;  <br>  we can't expect them to come out knowing or learning much of anything off the bat...it takes time...patience, and love...|`|nBGjPwViaa	Mine did this, and I am really not sure there's anything you can do but wait it out.<br>  I think it took mine a while -- a couple months.|`|kSEO2w8Aaa	Your baby might be overly used to daytime sounds to feel comfortable sleeping.. i always sleep my baby in his own room and he was good from day one..|`|R2OMEjrhaa	For my daughter we would only let her take two naps during the day starting at about  a month old. She would take one at about 9-11 and then again about 3-5. Those where the only times whould would actually leave her alone and let her sleep. She would try to fall asleep other times but. we would pick her up and play with her. Turn the radio up, take her outside to get sunshine. We just did alot of thing, so if she did fall asleep she did really get that much out of it. it tokk about a 2 weeks but after that she began sleep from about 9 or so till about 6 or 7. She wwould wake up to nurse still at about 2, but would ususlly fall asleep while nursing.|`|uNvF299Caa	My baby did that for a couple of weeks in two different occasions.  I think it just takes time. <br>  <br>  I would say don't worry too much, keep doing what you are doing.  If you are too worried you can talk to your doctor or read more about it on sites like www.babycenter.com<br>  <br>  This link is a sleeping chart<br>  <a href="http://www.babycenter.com/0_how-much-sleep-does-your-child-need_7645.bc" rel="nofollow">http://www.babycenter.com/0_how-much-sle...</a><br>  <br>  I have read that you should just let your child sleep as much as she wants.  If she eating enough throughout the day and getting the necessary sleep, then you shouldn't really wake her up because she might stay awake at night.<br>  <br>  Each baby is different, though, what worked well for me, might not work at all for you.<br>  <br>  I would just let him sleep.  Now he is 14 months. He goes to bed at 8pm till 8am (some times 7 am)  He sometimes cries around midnight for a bottle, but not usually.  He will nap for 2 - 3 hours during lunch time. <br>  <br>  It's hard to stay awake with them, trying to put them to sleep.  Have you tried leaving the baby in the crib to see if she'll fall asleep on her own? Sometimes they don't want to sleep because you're there and they want to play.  If she is just complaining you can leave her in the crib, I would pick her up when she is really crying. <br>  <br>  I don't know if I helped. Good luck.

I hope your gf finds out and you never touch another child again!|`|O7DleXS4aa	MMBYEE!<br>  <br>  :D|`|xO1LQWbZaa	That sounds super difficult...  You sould ask her what she wants you to do.|`|1l4pii9Daa	What's with the peer pressure??  You deserve what's coming to you buddy!!|`|1UrMbDZHaa	youre really screwed if her parents are the type to get at the guy. which is a good chance. you can always be a typical loser and deny. my boyfriend is 6 years older than me but at least i graduated highschool before i got pregnant. its your responsibility. you know sex CAN cause a pregnancy. shouldve thought of that before hand. its going to be rough but the best thing is to tell your girlfriend and take care of this girl and your baby. otherwise if you make her mad...you make the parents mad...and you'll probably go to jail.|`|k4Ek3jAqaa	Ok is the girl 18? If so she's not a minor. Some states 16 is the legal age. That being said, what the h3ll were you thinking!? <br>  1.She's a minor (if she's under 18) <br>  2.You had to "convince" her <br>  3.You didn't wear a condom!? You don't even know this girl from the sounds of it <br>  4.You don't even know this girl so IF she is pregnant it could not even be yours <br>  These are things you need to ask. <br>  Has she taken a test? If at home tell her to schedule a Dr. app.<br>  Is she sure if she is that it is your child.<br>  What does she want to do? Chances are she might want to give it up for adoption or not even have it. So don't really freak out until you know more details. Good luck though.|`|rMuBHXg5aa	Since it was a one night stand, you obviously don't want a relationship with this girl. You still have to tell your girlfriend. Also, talk with the pregnant girl and find out what she wants to do. If she plans on having and keeping the baby, you should have a paternity test done to make sure it is yours. if it shows that you are the father then you have to step up and take reponsibility for what you done. The girl didn't do this all by herself and the baby certainly didn't ask to be made and it deserves a decent life. So, step up and be a man... you can support this mother and child without having to marry her. Marrying just to provide a name is just putting one mistake on top of another. Also, if your present girlfriend really loves you, she will understand that it happened before you two started dating and she will stand by you and be supportive of the mother and child.|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	Wow, hopefully you do go to jail. You're a douchebag. Hopefully your girlfriend finds out and gets rid of you if nothing else. What you should be doing is manning up and taking responsibilities for your actions. You are an adult so you should try to offer some support to the girl you impregnated and quit being so ridiculously selfish.<br>  <br>  Edit: What you said DOES make you a jerk. This girl was good enough for you to use but you are unwilling to face the consequences of your actions. If you are just out of college what are you, like 22? That would make her 16 or so with a 6 year age difference. That's gross.|`|2irmTjQ3aa	You can't do anything. If she wants to have an abortion then ok, but if she wants to keep the baby and if her parents press charges against you, then there is nothing you can do and yes you will go to jail.|`|syrh8J6Vaa	You peer pressured a minor into having sex.  That is above and beyond statutory rape.  If she tells what happened yes you should go to jail.  You should talk to her and see what she wants to do.|`|hq5cdDpwaa	sucks to be u. i don't know what to tell u to do. just be a man not a baby.|`|vrt8bMzVaa	get a lawyer|`|m2aznd8xaa	you should of thought of that before you hooked up with a minor. especially if you already got a girl..if your not happy with your gf you should of broken up and found someone else,your own age, your grown and should be able to control yourself when it comes to kids younger than you. nothing you can do now. whats done is done. and if you choose to brush this girl off  she might just get you in trouble with your gf, the cops and child support. so hope her parents aint strict. thats why i always tell my kids think of the consequences before you act out.
bb7b4M9Xaa	HI, when i was pregnant i asked the same questions. Yes, some seafoods are ok but some aren't! how do i know this? i asked the doctors at the hospital when i had went to one of my check ups. When your pregnant you here so many rumors like for example: Don't eat sushi, because the seaweed will cause a miscarriage" The doctor's told me that there was a load of bull & i personally think if that was the case there would be no chinese people ;). Some seafood's you should diffidently stay away from because they can harm your baby, like shark and a lot of other fish with High mercury.I ate dorry when i was pregnant.....mm mMM Stay away from seafood such as cold prawns and things like that because of the bacteria..it can cause a lot of bad things to happen. Never eat raw fish.<br>  hope this helped :):):):)|`|5qRKH9ozaa	The rule of thumb with fish/seafood is very specific and you can find the list of okay items on babyzone.com.  (I would list them, but I always forget and have to look it up each time.)  It's hard for some women to stay away but certainly not worth the risk to your baby! =)|`|IFDfpbFJaa	It is okay in moderation but don't eat anything raw. Some sushi is okay because it's cooked but not all of it .|`|21Lnhdfeaa	Generally, it's best to limit your intake.  But I would recommend talking to your doctor.  He can best advise you about what is and is not good for you specifically to eat.  He knows your history and your situation.  He'll give you the most informed answer.|`|p4R1c6fraa	I know that shrimp is alright maybe once a week but not more.Check the mercury levels in the fish you enjoy before eating.Many fish have levels of mercury that are very bad for us pregnant ladies and our babies.Also make sure the fish is prepared in the best most healthy way possible.You don't want anything under cooked.I even have my steak cooked med well to be sure it is safe.I wish you well and God bless.|`|2b89bf97bd46e907e67742dba26abd5daa	watch how much fish you eat because of Mercury, My doctor told me I cold have all the shellfish I wanted, and not to eat sushi at all.|`|an8O7r4kaa	most seafood you should stay away from cause there is mercury in it. just for safety i wouldn't eat any.|`|1z3C0R2Vaa	You can eat some not all happy nine months.........)

pZg05uygaa	There are a lot of indicators of ovulation but the two most reliable are a rise in your waking temperature and the presence of cervical mucus. If you want to learn more about how to do this, read Taking Charge of Your Fertility and look at the website sisterzeus.com. All you need is a thermometer, don't buy ovulation predictor kits, they are not as reliable and are expensive.|`|Wzws8v8daa	most women ovulate 2 weeks before your period comes. so if you get your period regularly, every 28 days or so, then you ovulate 2 weeks after your period, and 2 weeks before your next period.  however if your periods are irregular, then you may not be ovulating at all.  you can take your temperature every morning, and when you ovulate your temperature will raise at least 0.5 degrees.  if you never see the rise, then that means you're not ovulating and you should see a fertility doctor.|`|O3EtP4vOaa	There are several indicators that you are ovulating.  Your discharge (cervical mucus) should be clear egg white consistancy, you can do a BBT (basal body temp chart) and you will notice a  dip then increase in your body temp, the position and softness of the cervix (I have never been very successful at checking this one).  I would recommend getting a book call Takeing Charge of Your Fertility.  This book really helped me understand my body and cycles.

kiAQi91laa	There's nothing wrong with how you're reacting.  I know I enjoyed being pregnant and feeling the baby move in my tummy.  It felt as if we were a team and I wanted the pregnancy to last as long as possible---at 42 weeks my doctor gave me my first c-section.  I was sort of depressed because I had to share her with the world.  I was definitely going through postpartum depression.<br>  <br>  However, whenever I talk about how I felt during my first pregnancy with my husband or my daughter I start to cry too.  It's just you missed that special experience you had with your first pregnancy.<br>  <br>  My second pregnancy was a bit uncomfortable and now I'm expecting for the third time and I've been on bed rest for almost half of the pregnancy.  It really varies upon each one.<br>  <br>  Congratulations on your engagement and upcoming wedding!
VS78dqO9aa	well first, I think it's important that she tells her parents first if she hasn't....Not only to get medical attention, and mental support, but so her parents can make sure insurance is taken care of, if not, she'll need to get government help, then it's time to tell the boyfriend, and oh yeah HIS PARENTS also.  It's not something to be excited about...So don't be trying to get cute with it.  She is too young to be having a baby.  <br>  <br>  Just get him away from all of his friends, not at school, or if you have a trusted adult, sit down with them and tell him.  Don't' write it in a note, and tell him, he needs to be there to help and make the decisions unless he doesn't want to.  Then if he wants to, start making the biggest decisions in your life.  Are you ready to become parents, and grow up, and take responsibility, or be responsible and give your child up for adoption?  Either way, you're going to have to grow up now, because it's a big decision...Abortion is not an option!!!!<br>  <br>  And if he doens't!!!  You don't need a boy to survive in this world.  You can do as you please.  But be sure that he signs all of his rights away...|`|3ioUdPuZaa	Tell your friend that it will be OKAY...taking one simple day at a time, without overwhelming herself by thinking of too much at once, or too far ahead. All this does is create MORE unecessary fear, confusion and trauma. MILLIONS have managed through this crisis, and she WILL TOO.<br>  First, tell parents, THEN boyfriend and I wouldn't hurry to do the second because if he is also young, there will undoubtedly be some serious fears hit him quick and hard, too! She doesn't need to compound her problems by having an "out of control" young father-to-be on her hands too quickly!<br>  I have ALWAYS found that in times when TOUGH communication is necessary it is better to put it in a letter...maybe with a card that is somehow appropriate. Writing this tough situation down in a letter will help your friend by allowing her the ability to WORD the letter the way she REALLY wants to word it by editing it as she chooses and adding things that she might want to add. This keeps the "heat" of the situation OUT of the way until the parents or boyfriend have the time to fully FATHOM, THINK ABOUT, and come to a place of PEACE with the situation. And your friend can find a time to leave the letter when she will be "away" for a day or so. This gives her no unecessary pain or panic from the "initial shock" of the situation and things that might be said in anger that aren't really meant. There is NO reason I know of for this to have to be confrontational or hurting for anyone past just having the knowledge of the situation. So, in other words, your friend stays OUT of the way, while parents and later, boyfriend, HEAR the news and do their natural reactions WITHOUT her being there to be part of any argument or confrontation. People often react BADLY at first to a shocking or scary situation. It's natural. Parents have SO many hopes and dreams for their child, and when they hear the news, they will go through a LOT of various emotions before they just remember they love her, and that is ALL that really matters. The boyfriend will have to fathom his OWN future of having a child to raise, support and love...for the rest of his life! This is pretty strong medicine and he will also have various reactions (some of which may or may not be of a juvenile...me, me, me, nature) BUT TOO BAD, he's going to be a parent too! Its the real life stuff that makes you or breaks you as a person. If you TRY to do it right, it makes you better! But if you run from it, try to shove it off on someone elses shoulders or just feel sorry for yourself, ignoring ALL the others involved, it will break you...or him. <br>  After the intial shock has settled, HAVE YOUR FRIEND GET ALL THE PARENTING INFORMATION SHE CAN AND HAVE HER REALLY STUDY IT. There are parenting classes and although a lot of people think that it is dumb, there are some really important things to be learned. Be thankful that in today's world they are offered, because yesterdays parents had children with "no instruction booklet offered o available!"<br>  She will need a GOOD support system to MAKE SURE she finishes school and attends college. This HAS to happen or some day she will wake up and feel like a failure for not being able to support her child the way she should...you can never and SHOULD NEVER place your future on the hope of having a man around. TOO many WOMEN have ALREADY been there, done that....and failed! To quote the Army, "Be all that YOU can be." <br>  By support system I mean....PEOPLE who are going to be there for her to babysit while she goes to school and possibly work, and people she can call for help with most anything, including the times she may feel down. I HOPE her parents will be that support, but a lot of young girls find that they cannot depend on their parents. <br>  Find a support system of dependable and knowledgable people who will agree to help if needed...and ASK BEFORE she needs the help. <br>  Its a big load to carry for someone who should STILL be enjoying life to the fullest while she is still young...but it will work out as long as she is determined and never gives up. You can have a baby and STILL enjoy life, but she will need to understand ALL of the tough emotional times ahead. <br>  Babies are a gift from God, according to the Bible. NOT ONE is created without it being his "gift." So this is no accident. A child is NO ACCIDENT. I hope that abortion is NOT a part of the decision making. My reason is not just by virtue of my belief that every life, IS A LIFE THAT HAS A RIGHT TO LIFE, but is also based on many friends who I have known that have had abortions. <br>  EVERYONE of them says that there isn't a day they don't think about the child that they allowed a doctor to "take away."<br>  That is perhaps more DIFFICULT to live with than actually having the baby and raising it. <br>  My best to mother and child...you help her all you can!<br>  Blessings,<br>  Bunny7|`|AA10517807	the  sooner the better,when you are at that age i don't think there is a right way to say it ?|`|8MTN47C9aa	She should just come out and say it. There's really no easy way to break the news when you're 15 and pregnant. Good Luck! :)|`|S0n3DinFaa	I would start by talking to your Mom. Sure your Mom is going to be upset but after the shock wears off she will calm down!  After she calms down she cand help you tell your Dad and whoever else needs to be told.  In tough times you know your Mom can really be your best friend!  I would just sit her down and tell her you need to talk.  <br>  <br>  You did an adult thing by having sex now you have to act like an adult and take care of your responsibilities.  You need to do this now so you can start prenatal doctor appointments so your baby can be healthy!<br>  <br>  Be strong and do what you have to do!!!<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|ko3Larigaa	I would be able to tell my boyfriend so i dont know how to help but if came to my mom.... it would be a little harder Im only 14...<br>  <br>  Uhm I would sit down with the easiest person to talk to first and then have them talk and then tell he/she that she wants to tell her other parent that she is. <br>  <br>  And I dont know about this but I guess she can call him or see him and talk to him and tell him that she got pregnant dont make him stay tho give him that choice when guys feel pressure it usually pushes them away more... Just tell him and give him time eventually hell either stay with her and help or he will leave but bothering him about it and not leaving him alone may make him thinks its too much to handle|`|uaHzhUeoaa	Really, she just has to come out and say it. It'll be over quickly, and she won't have to do any planning ahead or anything. Just say "sweetie, (or mom & dad) I'm pregnant." Be prepared, they might act shocked or angry or just plain confused, but the truth is that the information will take some time to sink in. It's best for everybody to not beat around the bush or lie at all in this case.|`|hORVMOHKaa	put the positive pregnancy test in a gift bag and let them open it up =]|`|TQW5E6olaa	And simply as possible, tell mom first. She will be more understanding and helpful than the boyfriend.

I just answered a ques like this and told her to stick it out til she graduated but she was older than you...I would just start doing what you want to do when you want to do it...parents need to realize they can't completely control their kids lives...you need some freedom and you need to experience life and make your own mistakes!..Good luck|`|abELhjcoaa	sounds like a nightmare, but introduce some of your friends to your parents, they may feel comfortable if they know who youre with, and also keep the cellphone on incase they call, show them that they could trust you through being responsible|`|XGgPhaDbaa	Your parents are just trying to protect you and keep you from bad influences.<br>   I am an adult now but I remember feeling the same way you do when I was your age. But now I am glad they did what they did because I have seen my friends die from drunk driving, become drug addicts go to jail, and have to live off of welfare because they got pregnant and didn't finish school. If they did not have strict rules, I could have been one of those people.<br>  This won't last forever because you will be 18 soon.

It worked fine we have those baby bumper things on the bed sides none of them have fallen off of anything so I think your child will be safe. Keep the door open though and put a gate on your childs door room or the stairs,|`|22221968cc6e48e97db5387607cd0f8faa	put her in a toddler bed. there is no other way....at least no other safe way.|`|kjgonYlgaa	I moved my toddler to a big girl bed just before she figured out how to climb out.  I couldn't stand the thought off her falling.  I got a side rail type thing that fit under her mattress and flipped up to form a barricade, so she wouldn't fall out.  Then i got a baby gate for her door.  (Our room id right across the hall from hers).  I didn't want her to think that I was trying to trap her so I told her the gate was to keep the dog from going in and waking her up at night.  It worked beautifully.  And even now, three years later the dog still won't go in that room without an invitation.|`|rkSBHqtQaa	Have you tried a toddler bed? my two year old used to clim out of his crib at 18 months and thats when we decided it was time to switch him to a toddler bed. it was a smooth transition with him. maybe your two year old is ready for a toddler bed and by getting out of his crib hes trying to tell you.,|`|oHV95EFLaa	sounds like he's ready for a toddler bed! my 2 1/2 year old daughter has been in her bed for quite a while now. it's a struggle to try to teach them to stay and sleep in their bed but it's much safer then him trying to climb out of his crib|`|BqqDJXkjaa	I don't think you can, so it may be time for a big kid bed.|`|7fPuUT3Daa	well my son climbed out of his crib at 18 months and i had his crib as low as it would go, so that was it for me the next day i went and bought a super cute toddler bed from walmart, only 60$ VERY sturdy and nice, and used that it only took a couple of nights for him to get used to it but he liked it and he could get out in the morning. Hes now 23 months old and we just bought him a full size bed, he loves how much room he has. Best Luck|`|fjTVAbdBaa	That is how I know my kids are ready for a big boy/girl bed.

When your grandkids fail in life you will be part to blame because you didn't do anything to ensure that they suceed. In life...in any predicament....you're either part of the problem or part of the solution. Report them asap so that when your grandkids grow up they can say "thank you grandma for being the only one who gave a damn about us!"|`|S0n3DinFaa	I am not sure what state your in but in certain states there are grandparents rights.  If worse comes to worse you might need to call a child protective agency.  <br>  <br>  I would if possible volunteer to take the children as much as possible.  Tell their Mom you know she is under a lot of stress and you just want to help out!  If possible talk to your son and tell him what is going on and see if he will talk to the children's mother and let you have them until he is released!<br>  <br>   My heart goes out to you.. But you need to do whatever it takes to take care of your grandchildren.  They need to come first!<br>  <br>  Please let me know the outcome!<br>  <br>  Good Luck!<br>  Your in my prayers!|`|fjTVAbdBaa	your son is in jail and his baby (your grand child) mama does drugs, and is all around an unfit mother... correct?<br>  Call CPS, try to get custody of the child.|`|s9d8I0Uaaa	do not let her/him idk, near your grandchildren. its not safe. let the police know and they will know what to do.|`|V4U65uidaa	i am sorry to hear that your son is in jail  but do you go to english class???|`|71I16AGQaa	learn English plz|`|UdICTUnaaa	how long is your son going to be in jail? call child protective services if you think theres a serious problem|`|AA11351425	And your question is?

U1wAKo1Gaa	Don't worry about that baby starving to death, trust me, she will eat when she gets hungry....I promise you.  Just keep offering all the same healthy foods, snacks and drinks that you are already and she'll keep growing and growing and growing, even if she never drinks "milk" again.  Good luck!|`|Fd4lITkvaa	At this point if you want to wean from the breast she should be getting everything she needs from regular food, she doesn't need milk. At 11 months I had my son on 3 solid meals a day and several snacks. The first breastfeeding I cut out was a mid morning feeding. Next will be mid afternoon. I cut one feeding every few weeks. Start with meals that aren't related to sleep and start a new sleep routine that doesn't just involve nursing.<br>  <br>  If your baby isn't taking enough solid foods yet it's not time to wean. Formula isn't needed at 12 months so you are almost here anyway, breastmilk is also not needed although still beneficial.|`|EyKJ737daa	Sweetie, your baby will be just fine, she will not starve I promise you.  She will give in when she is hungry but she knows you will give in first so she just keeps screaming and going "hysterical" till you do!  Tricky little monkeys they are!  Is there a reason you need to do it so fast or do you want to do it gradually and make it a bit easier on you and your baby?  how many feeds a day (breast) does she normally have?  you might find though that she doesn't like formula, just like my youngest didn't.  She hated it and refused point blank to even touch a bottle! Drove me in sane but I wasn't in a hurry to ween her, it was more the day weening I had to do because she couldn't breastfeed from daycare! So I continued to give one feed in the morning after breakfast and then one feed at night before bed.  During the day I would give her cows milk which at 11 months you can already start giving especially in mashed potato etc. but I'm sure you would know by now if she had any allergy to cows milk.  If she is taking other fluids during the day then she will certainly not dehydrate and she is eating solids right? as you didn't mention that but at 11 months she'd be pretty much eating what ever is on offer at the dinner table?  You can always get milk into her in other ways too, like mash potato or mixed veggies if she will still eat them.  Even jarred food, you can still add a few mils here and there throughout the day.  But sweetie, she wont starve if she doesn't have milk.  Milk is for calcium and other vitamins and minerals, all of which are in cheese too so she'll be just fine.  Otherwise sweetie, drop the milk feeds during the day and just give her one at night or maybe get daddy to feed her while you disappear because while she sees or hears you, she will want you!  Good luck and all the very best of luck, they are stubborn when they want to be!

46cd2ca02c07674e58e26d9c11367762aa	First of all, you should talk to your parents. Its good to have support during such a huge event in your life. To tell your boyfriend, you should just take him aside and tell him. Tell him straight up what the situation is, and tell him what you want to do next. <br>  It is possible to go on and have a great life, and do all of the things you wanted to do, even with a baby. When a baby is born, your life will be different, but it wont end. Life will go on, and you can be as successful as you ever wanted to be. <br>  My sister was 16 and pregnant. She went through and had her son, and graduated. She went to college and got a degree. Shes very successful and happy. <br>  Youll get through this. Keep your chin up.|`|H5qJPekAaa	You can handle this. You should tell maybe one of your closets friends first and then have them help you tell your parents like in Juno. Also the next thing you should do is tell your parents. Explain to them that you were very carefull and you used a condom and was on the pill. But you don't know what went wrong. Maybe the condom broke but you just didn't relize. Also think about adaption if you think it will be too much for you to handle with school and everything. Yes you can go to school while pregnate. But make sure that you take care of your self with what you eat and take vitemines.|`|v6mQzSSbaa	Well I know a 13 year old whos pregnant......she told her mom|`|dcNmRPGPaa	you'll be fine.<br>  make your bf work.<br>  keep your grades up and don't call your baby a mess!

(i've been trying a lot of days and times.. nothing for sure yet, it stinks.. and i joked about the god and my baby part lol don't think much of it)|`|5qRKH9ozaa	It is possible...that doesn't mean that it will be easy, but it is definitely possible.  Keep that motivation for the sake of your child!  When it comes to telling folks, you just have to say the words to your parents and boyfriend.  <br>  <br>  There is no rule of thumb that says you have to tell anyone else or explain your situation to anyone else.  Tell those that are important to you that can love and support you.  I admire you for wanting to take responsibility for your actions.|`|86d6ceaf091a87fdb16c07d5c93ed356aa	Im sorry for your mistake; i really am. Im glad to hear that you still want to stay in school. But im sure that once you spill that your pregnant they will try to move you to another type of school. Where i go, they call it pace. It is for kids behind on their credits,working to help out their family or in your case; pregnant. <br>  <br>  But first, you need to tell your mother. Shes is the only person that will always love you and ill help you through this.<br>  <br>  :]|`|FHmtAMLZaa	just talk to your parents they might be a bit upset at 1st but will soon come round. i know from experience i fell pregnant at 15 and had my daughter at 16. i to was still in school and i returned to school 3months after she was born to do my leaving cert (im from ireland) its like A levels in uk. i then went on and done a collage course so it can be done. im glad you want to continue with you education. all the best to you.|`|86EM0euvaa	Talk about unlucky   (condom and pill)|`|7zMtmKJaaa	okay listen to me. I'm 16. I'm in the 11th grade. I got pregnant. I'm a good student. First thing to do is tell your boyfriend then tell your  parents. They will be upset but they will support you.<br>  Stay in school, you are almost graduating. In the summer take extra classes if you can if your in the type of school that can let you get off periods.<br>  You can live your life the way you wanted to still. I'm gonna go straight to college right after highschool. My parents are supporting me so much, I'm thankful.<br>  just tell your mom and dad 'Mom, Dad, i'm pregnant.' if not tell your mom first and she'll help you tell your dad. thats how i did it.<br>  <br>  Good luck <3|`|LqulvCsoaa	I'm proud of you for taking responsibility for your actions and that your not going to get an abortion. That is wonderful. But having sex out of wed-lock is a grave sin. I would greatly suggest that you go to parents for support. They could take care of the baby for you while your at school, support you w/ money, and provide constant care and love to you in your time of need. Your boyfriend might not be rdy for his task as dad though.However he responses do not get an abortion! You will be better off by bringing new lift into this world. Anyways, stay in school ignore the ruddnes of other people and try to stand tall. Be proud that you are bringing new life into this and not killing your own child.|`|jIJ3obFOaa	be honest.<br>  you have to be a grown up now, since you wanted to<br>  partake in a grown up act.<br>  <br>  so tell your mom. tell you boyfriend.<br>  you can still go to school up until you have the baby<br>  and then youll go on a 6-8 weeks leave when the baby is born<br>  and you can do homebound or take night school.<br>  <br>  it IS possible because i got pregnant one month b4 my 17th birthday<br>  im 18 now 19 in august and i am doing these things. i will accomplished my goals.<br>  <br>  your dreams are in hand reach you just have to trust your self and have enough drive to wanna do them.<br>  <br>  age doesnt mean a darn thing... at all. im a great mother and my daughter is the sweetest most brilliant 10 month old ive ever met and im not just sayin that because shes mine.. IM DOING THINGS RIGHT.<br>  <br>  you have to give yourself credit.. and still countiue with your life, although its gonna be hard... you can do it. dont listen to anyone that has something negative about it.<br>  <br>  good luck.|`|GHH1i6d3aa	Well make up your mind on whether or not you will be keeping it.  Then once you've decided, either go to a clinic and talk to a doctor about abortion, or tell your boyfriend and parents ASAP.  You should definitely try to finish school if your parents or boyfriend's parents can help take care of the baby.  After you graduate, you'll have to get a job and play it by ear.  You sound like a mature girl with a good head on her shoulders, so you'll probably be a great mom, even if it's challenging.|`|WREJnokXaa	yes it is possible , you need to tell your parents , you need to get a job, and tell your bf what anybody else has to say does not matter. you need to do what is right for your child. Life will not be easy but it will be okay go to the doctor and there are a lot of programs for teen mom's that you can be apart of that will help you and your baby....|`|go2SGvFxaa	im 16 and a few days off 8 months, i found out when i was 3 months too and i was on the pill. i didnt know what to do either my boyfriend kept telling me to get an abortion but i dont believe in them but he soon came around, i was soo scared to tell my parents but when i did they were suprisingly ok with it. its not that bad as you mite think it is seriously and trust me its going to be worth telling them in the long run|`|GrZTwERlaa	Hey Kate,<br>  <br>  Wow well first Congrats on your news! Shocking i know but also exciting.<br>  Tell your boyfriend about what has happened, you'll just have to come out straight with it. The next thing you need to do is book an appointment with your doctor, he will put you in contact with various support groups that can be help full being a young mum. I would say that they would be able to help you break the news to your parents.<br>  <br>  you do have options and there is alot of support out there......good luck|`|F8EMQzxfaa	just tell them straight out there is no good way to tell someone your pregnant at 16. I say if you can keep the baby. An yes you can finish school. Alot of girl get homeschooled so the can be home with their babies. That's what my mom did when she was 16. Good luck.|`|bIvZknnbaa	Yeah you can stay in school, take it from the guy whose school once had the most high school births in America.  They either have a relative take care of the baby during school hours, or they actually bring the baby to school.|`|X3QUVs0raa	tell ur bf to get a job first of all...|`|0L1hXyKoaa	Good luck
6hb04Ow0aa	Is it right? Of course it's right! People can name their kids anything they want (look at those celebrities who have kids called Diva Muffin and Audio Science). You've picked two perfectly normal names and personally I'm over the 'rule' you have to have a long name with a short name! I love Gabrielle and Gabriella, and I like how her middle name will have some meaning (like some people just use Rose or Grace or Marie because they go with everything). Nice choice : )|`|51cd856f9c2a18d1e26ffbefc3cea6d8aa	Gabriella is cute....<br>  <br>  you name that baby of your whatever you want to, me personally don't want to give my child too big of a name because it may be hard for them to learn (afterall i do have a fourteen letter long last name lol)|`|BG2BTDT3aa	best thing to do is scream out the name like your mad if it flows nicely it's the right choice!... but i like the name Katrina Gabrielle.. it flows instead of the other way around|`|05f0422d6b7494f2a7dcefa19ad4600caa	2 big names together is fine if you have a short last name.  Gabrielle Katrina sounds best together and its very nice.  Congrats.|`|vG7fljVzaa	Gabriella Katrina|`|1OSo4nofaa	Gabrielle|`|hORVMOHKaa	i like Gabriella better<br>  <br>  <br>  Gabriella Rose is cute!|`|XCgmsEsZaa	if you like it go for it<br>  i love the name Gabrielle and Katrina and those two together sounds good|`|H0sPCJQPaa	I love it<br>  I would love it more if it was <br>  Katrina Gabrielle.<br>  <br>  No Gabriella Katrina. The double Ah sound its tacky. :)|`|ot0TqzSvaa	I love Gabrielle Katrina.<br>  Gabi is one of my best friend's names, and i love it.<br>  Could also have the nickname Elle if you'd prefer.<br>  If you'd like suggestions.. What about Mariette for a girl?<br>  To me its as beautiful and feminine as Gabrielle, but a little less common... Idk, hope you like it.<br>  <br>  Dont do Gabriella Katrina because the double sound isnt good...<br>  <br>  And, it doesnt matter that the two names are long. They sound great together, and especially if the surname is short.<br>  <br>  Congrats and Good Luck<br>  ? Bee|`|4mSpN3Rxaa	Katrina Gabrielle|`|igMh0iL3aa	Gabrielle Katrina|`|KOcCenrEaa	Gabrielle Katrina sounds better.
BqqDJXkjaa	Try some alternate behaviour techniques -they often work better as they're easy to stick to<br>  ie everytime your son is naughty get a permanant marker and put a big X on the back of his hand. It should have the same effect as spanking.|`|O3EtP4vOaa	I always find that when they do something wrong I out them in time out and before they get up they have to explain to me why they are in time out and they can not get up until they apologize.  If they hit someone with something, or they were not playing fairly with a toy then that gets put on top of the fridge or in a cabinet for 1 week.  But if you make them explain and then explain why that was wrong and tell them that it hurt you or the other person and they apologize then it seem to realy help them grasp why they should not do and prevent it from happening again.  Time out always ends with a hug and I love you after the apology.<br>  <br>  Good luck.<br>  <br>  The only time I think spanking is okay is if they run out in the street or something extremely serious like that.  I also do not believe in yelling as my parents always yelled and I just tuned them out after awhile.|`|VHJ6Jp5qaa	spank him one time and he will be shocked and will probably stop!!! I have a 5 year old son and a 3 year old son and a 2 year old son and when they really get out of control and the corner doesn't work anymore well a good old fashioned spanking tends to do them some good!!!!|`|W16vRFTNaa	I have a similar problem with my 3 year old but its getting better now. I also did not want to spank him but, i see it as if i spank him now i will not have to discipline him when he is older. Also if wait it just gets worst|`|nBjQQ3yraa	Whatever you do you just need to be consistent.  If something he does is wrong one time it needs to be addressed everytime.  You need to stick  to your guns. If you say something mean it.|`|AA10779494	Why don't you leave him to grow with a bit of your work mixed with something to learn about and nice music to listen to?
HztriBPAaa	12 - 13 years old<br>   60 - 63 inches (5'0"-5'3")<br>   I was 5'1 at 13 and grew 2 more inches from what I have read girls usually only grow about 1-2 more inches after their first period. If you are worried about her talk to her doctor about it. Hope that helps.|`|aOCfLAJJaa	However tall her hormonal levels tell her to be.<br>  <br>  I'm 6'0" at 13, which is BEFORE a growth spurt. My parents are 5'7" and 5'2".|`|swxiulwtaa	Your daughters are REALLY short<br>  Maybe you should take her to a doctor|`|RsFxgN4Gaa	I'm not sure why you are worrying about this.<br>  <br>  I have 6 kids.... they are varying heights. <br>  <br>  My oldest is just over 6' tall. When he was 16 everyone thought he was 12, he hated it. But when he hit 18 he just grew a ton and went from around 5' 7" to over 6'. He was just a late bloomer so to speak.<br>  <br>  I have a 16 year old who is now about 5' 7" ... my daughter who is 15 is 5' 5" (same as me). <br>  <br>  I have a 13 year old who no believes he is 13, he looks like he's 8. He is maybe 4' 8".... maybe?<br>  <br>  Then my two youngest they are the same height yet 14 months apart. They were the same size clothes and shoes.<br>  <br>  Kids just grow how they are meant to grow. Some faster, some slower, but they will in the end be the height they were meant to be.<br>  <br>  How are people in your family height wise? Are they mostly tall, mostly short? That is going to be more of a judge of size than averages or looking at the classmates. Most of my family is short... I'm one of the taller ones at 5' 5" tall. My mom is 5' 1", my dad was 5' 3"... my grandma is only 4' 10" . We are just short, so chances are my kids won't be very tall.|`|c55O7jqXaa	Well what does her pediatrician say? I would take her in and have them check on that. Maybe she is just going to be small, maybe gonna be a late bloomer, or maybe she needs growth hormones. Going to the doctor to have it checked out would be your best bet. I was 5'1 at at age and I am only 5'4 at almost 40. My Daughter will be 7 this next month and she is 45 inches tall and she is only in the 25th percentile on her height.|`|BRT2teSqaa	That is abnormal if she has begun puberty.  If she hasn't begun yet, than she is just a late bloomer.  She will shoot up when puberty hits.  Most 13 year olds are about 5 feet or so.|`|UmX58lC0aa	why dont you look at the height of her class mates
1z3C0R2Vaa	tell her to see her doc and take no chances with her baby Good luck......)|`|p4R1c6fraa	If she is really concerned then she needs to call her doctor.That is why they make the big money.What did she do differently today?If she sat to long or lifted some weight she shouldn't have then she could have just aggravated her sciatic.I am a waitress and we carry big trays.I have back pain by the end of my shifts.I just take it slow and rest with my feet up at the end of the night.Tell her to keep her feet up and sleep on her left side at night.I hope she feels better.God bless.
IFDfpbFJaa	No. Precum is supposed to clear the urine left in the urethra....I wouldn't recommend having a guy pee in you everytime you have sex either..|`|gjVeJFRtaa	u dirty u need help|`|f1f028e1b87f4263abe46dd6cf2aa259aa	First off your friend is sick, but long as she isn't hurting anyone that's her right.  <br>  <br>  Second off I hope she doesn't get pregnant by a urinating 'boyfriend'.  Someone needs to teach her about about something called marriage.  <br>  <br>  Third I have a weird feeling this friend is YOU.|`|ij9N9r5waa	No it does not kill the sperm, however it can cause your friend to get a yeast infection, also can pass all kinds of STD's .  tell your friend to use birth control and her partner should were a condom and stop the internal water sports.|`|AA12020110	NO!  They need to be using two kinds of birth control.  Keep telling  her that.|`|1z3C0R2Vaa	Sorry cant ans this one is too big for me........)|`|zmfNXuwYaa	Urine is acidic but I doubt that's the reason. They should really see a specialist.<br>  <br>  Or maybe if they're trying to get pregnant, try having sex every once in a while without the urination. If she can't get pregnant after 6 months while trying WITHOUT the urination, then they should see a specialist.|`|vj3WSxzWaa	I dont know,,but,I am a little shocked,I have never in my life heard of a guy going pee inside a girl,,,that is really odd!<br>  Urine has a lot of bacteria,,so maybe it could be causing her fertility issues,,not sure.|`|2f6diQBiaa	Ummm...besides the fact that yes, it is interfering with her getting pregnant, it also carries a very high risk of her getting an infection. That's not the healthiest practice.|`|V7IdZplIaa	urine doesn't kill the sperm, but the extra fluid in the vag. will probably help to clear out some semen. so it would lessen the chances of getting pregnant but not prevent it.|`|OCk7I8JVaa	These people are better off not procreating, consider it Darwinian.|`|O3EtP4vOaa	ummmm...that is the most disgusting thing I have heard in a long time, if not ever.  Is she frequently on antibiotics for infections?|`|YsvpLwy6aa	SICK!|`|3fur16Rgaa	OMG! what is wrong woth her!
DXZK6eMNaa	Whenever you want, try not to be hung up about it.  Do what feels right for you, and be safe.|`|IU4uNH97aa	well i don't think you should lose your virginity just because its the average age to do so. Lose when your ready and have someone you at least care about but on average i would say most 16-18 years old will lose there virginity around that time. you want your first time to be memorable and a good experience I would suggest to you to wait a while.|`|XITPweLEaa	When you are ready for all the things that can go wrong. When you can walk into a store and buy contraceptives without embarrassment. When you can handle going to the Dr for a pelvic exam.|`|k4AbeiS8aa	umm well for me i wouldnt want to lose my virginitiy untill i was at least 18 but thats just me|`|HJI6PlRraa	I think there are several answers, and I do not think you are too young just for asking I think you are educating yourself and you are smart.. I do however think that there are a lot of consequences, stds, pregnancy, and there are certain side effects gynecologically to having sex young.  I think every kid should be edecated that you can get an std like herpes even if you are both virgins, if you are in love, if you are "ready"....and a lot of other things can go wrong.  Also I think that its smart to wait over 6 months and you should both be in love and not pressured in any way, I think most couples would agree there are a certain amount of months where everything seems perfect, and you need to have that 1st fight and make it through before you enter the sex phase of the relationship b/c once you do thats all you both will want to do, and if you don't have the relationship to back it up, it will fall apart and you will both get hurt....i don't know I hope that helps....wait as long as you can, there is no such thing as too long, but too many kids do it to early|`|idwYURxsaa	There is no normal age. This is something you have to decide on your own. When you are ready heart, mind, and soul. Not when someone else thinks that you should. Don't do anything that you aren't sure about. You want your first time to be memorable, and you should have control of how that memory is made, and when.|`|oAcJPS98aa	30!<br>  <br>  My daughter was 19-1/2 when she lost her virginity.  She also lost her womb to the man's child.  She placed her beautiful baby with a wonderful family. <br>  <br>  Think about the consequences before you change your status.  Love is blind but prenancy isn't!|`|D1KNxmh6aa	Lose it whenever you want, but don't feel pressured. Do it on your terms.|`|c5AJGcYcaa	Honestly hon if you have to ask that question you are not ready!|`|pzLDXL6gaa	Whenever you feel ready - there is no "normal" age.<br>  <br>  I think it should be when you want to and when you think you can handle the consequences (pregnancy, STDs, emotional stuff etc.)<br>  <br>  I think the average age is around 17.<br>  <br>  Harriet|`|ejQ3yg9Naa	When your in love and sure that he is too. When your old enough to realize what your doing and what it could lead to. Most people have regrets about it make sure you don't.
1z3C0R2Vaa	sound like your period is coming......|`|ntdGOZqGaa	You can make yourself have pregnancy symptoms if you think about being pregnant all the time. Its called a false pregnancy, you can trick yourself into thinking that you are. I would test just to rest your mind. Good luck|`|lvGSEvjSaa	Sometimes the tenderness could be to your menstrual cycle coming or you could be pregnant!! I would get checked if I were you!|`|jYPeis3Saa	your period could cause this too.<br>  <br>  PMS and pregnancy symptoms can mimic each other
UdICTUnaaa	its completely normal.... no need to worry about serial killing or anything like that... they just dont know any better, and they cant hit you, so they hit the dog, lol.... they dont understand that dogs have feelings and emotions like us... they just dont understand<br>  <br>  so whoever said get down to their level and tell them no, be nice.... that is the correct way to handle it... take his hand and pet the dog with it... and say... niiiiiiice doggy, we LOVE the doggy. my son is 19 months and he doesnt hit the dog unless hes mad at me. he usually says AWWW and puts his head down on her and tries to give her kisses all the time. shes so annoyed, lol|`|W16vRFTNaa	My son had the same problem our cat and our dog... but i just bought him a fish and when he tried to take it out of the bowl it died and i told him that he has to be nice to his animals or they will leave, by the way  i told him the fish left to live in the ocean because he was being mean and he was hurting the fish by taking it out of its home. Then i went and bought him a new fish but i told him that his old fish came home when he was sleeping because he said sorry to him and the cat and the dog. And he promised me that he would be nice to them from now on and he has.|`|3vhgTXZEaa	your 2year old is feeling like the dogs has taking his place and that he into the spot light share the teaching of what you know about dog and what can be to him|`|2E1NXWZmaa	Maybe he does it because he lacks empathy.  Children typically don't learn this emotion until they're about three years old.|`|IFDfpbFJaa	Yes! My son is 3 and still mean to the dog. I think he thinks of it as "it runs down hill" and the dog is littler than him. It scares me sometimes because being mean to animals is a sign of a serial killer but I don't know with him being this young. He just doesn't understand yet. I really hope it's just a phase.|`|HFWLYMD6aa	You Just gotta get down to the child's level and tell them in words they will understand that it is NOT ok to hurt the animals. Also you can try "we use our gentle hands with the animals."
6fiYhtACaa	Oh, yes. I've never felt so vulnerable as the day I had my son. I could take just about anything bad happening to me, but the thought of something happening to my son is the most harrowing thing that I can think of. But you can drive yourself crazy doing this so I try to think of the positives that have come out these crazy times. My husband and I have cut back in so many ways so that I could stay home with our son and I think we are all the better for it. We travel less, yet see our family more. We shut off half of our cable channels and spend more time together. I've stopped going to the mall and now scrapbook, sew, and try out new recipes. My husband no longer goes out as much as he used to and spends time at home after work. In some ways we have reevaluated what's really important in life and our lives are all the better for it. I guess my point is sometimes in needs to get darker before you see the light. Don't be afraid. The world needs children who have parents like you. Because you care, you will instill that in your children and make it a better place.|`|rJBm9peRaa	I think most parents and those seriously considering parenthood thinks about this.  I worry for my children and what they might have to go through in years to come.  But I think the world has always been a terrible and wonderful place and always will be with a multitude of challenges.  I like to think that my kids and all these new fresh minds might just help things out and make the world a better place instead of just suffering in it.  I really hope that will be true.|`|QKh7voVKaa	you sound like a lovely person, the fact that you care tells me you would raise your children to care about the world also, we need more people having babies that have a social conscience to grow up and change the world for the better. live and love no matter your religion. please have more children, you will be doing the world a favour.|`|W7J5udmHaa	I wount want a baby just now, financially ,job secure ,saving , 401,health coverage w/o medical, think logical not emotionally,I would wait to see if we will do alright first...|`|vLOjcH7paa	Live your life and love your family!: )|`|n6XYYyoLaa	i would like to think that our world will eventually evolve into a better world, and there has to be someone or someone(s) to help; if we didn't reproduce we wouldn't have a chance....|`|pXSKSS3daa	No, I don't.<br>  <br>  The world is crappy and if we all feared bringing children into it I doubt we'd have any. It's our job, as parents, to protect our children and raise them to the best of our abilities. I mean, if I sat here and worried about every little thing going on with the economy or my husband getting deployed suddenly then that is ALL I would be doing.<br>  <br>  So, for me, there is no point in doing so. We will be TTC within the next couple of months. We want another baby(a brother or sister for Noah) and that's all there is to it. I focus on MY family and that is what gets me through this "uncaring world".|`|YmEGCGtnaa	well i'm not trying tc but i know what you eman.. i feel this way all the time with my only baby girl...i know how dnagerous and cold this world can be, and babies are defenseless...and what if ppl dont have mercy on them? those terrorists didnt when they blew up those planes on 9/11...i'd say follow your heart...do what you feel is right. remember you can always have children alter if not now, i knew a girl once who was against having her own children b/c she said she "loved her unborn children too much to bring them into this world, and hoped if possible, she could have them in heaven" crazy sounding i know, but she was a devout christian who really believed that. 2 yrs later she got pregnant bc she had a change of heart and felt the courage to bring a baby into the world.|`|AA11434640	I definitely understand your concerns. I've thought about the same kinds of things, and honestly for awhile I was feeling quite guilty about the fact that I want to have children some day. Though I understand your worry, I don't think you should let this stop you. So long as you and your fiance raise your children the best you can, I'm sure they will have the intelligence and strength to deal with whatever this crazy world may throw at them.|`|01Mu3wUeaa	I think about that EVERY single day.I worry too much...even when things don't involve me.Sometimes I think it would have been best to have no kids at all.<br>  <br>  All I can do is hope that my kids will be the change the world needs.I can raise them to the best of my ability to help others out in the world and make it a better place.<br>  <br>  <br>  Things are going to change soon though 2012 won't be the ending...it will be the complete opposite.|`|IXBl5l5kaa	My mother always said this day in age it's a tough choice for a couple to make to have children.. the fear of raising them in this evil world.<br>  <br>  My husband and I knew we wanted children, and we knew that we would do our best to raise her in a Christian family with good values and morals. That is the best we can do, and what path she chooses in life is up to her. That part worries me, what if she does something against what we raised her by? <br>  <br>  I know the joy and happiness I get from having her with me trumps any fears I had or may have about raising her in the world today. I know for sure we want at least one more child. No matter what the situation, our faith in God is what helps us through the hard times, and trust me, we sure have had some hard times.

SWOeg0jFaa	I really don't know what I want to do, or rather I KNOW what I want but I don't know how to achieve it. <br>  I want to finish high school (I'm a freshman) with a pretty good GPA and get into a good school like NYU or a smaller Liberal Arts college and study either Journalism, Psychology, English, Nutrition or become a nurse. After University I plan on joining the Peace Corps, as that is really my major goal as of now. When I'm finished volunteering for the Peace Corps, I don't know exactly what I want to do. I know I want to help people in 3rd world countries and travel a lot though, so I have a few ideas in mind. If I became a nutritionist or nurse, I would find a job volunteering at a local health care office in a developing country and try to help the people there (specifically children) as well as spread awareness and possibly set up my own non-government organization. Either that or I would become an International English Teacher, meaning I would teach English in the International/American schools in foreign countries (that's what my parents do, right now we're living in India) or become a free-lance journalist.<br>  <br>  Lot's of ideas, I know.<br>  Sorry I couldn't narrow it down a little more, good luck!|`|XvPoezxpaa	By '11 I should have my AS in nursing.

vWb8fquvaa	I am so sorry for your loss. Going thru something like that is not easy and extremely painful. <br>  <br>  I understand your need to be pregnant again but I think you made the smart decision to start birth control<br>  <br>  You need allow yourself to grieve over Elijah. Replacing him will not be the answer in your given situation. You can always do something to help you bring closure, like planting a tree/plant in his honor at your home, or something of the like. <br>  <br>  Good luck to you. My heart goes out to you.|`|ih2RV0pJaa	Hey, I get where your coming from. I'm sorry to hear you miscarried. But I feel you should learn from this. How would Elijah have liked to hear that he was unplanned? I think you've been given a second chance. Now you can finish school & get a proper career, get married THEN have children.<br>  <br>  Your still so young. You have so much of your youth to go through. In good time you can try again when your old enough. You just have to look at the benefits of waiting. I'm sure in time you'll be fine.|`|LfZk2NGBaa	You miss your baby and that is normal. You need time to grieve his loss. From reading your question I see it as a way you are trying to numb the pain. I think that you should enjoy your youth, and remember everything happens for a reason.|`|61e4f06381a76252125e9bd95d73271daa	First of all...to Yummy.....if you are going to tell someone else to learn to spell, you should probably make sure that your post does not have any misspellings. It is spelled manAge. And while we are on the subject...since you brought it up....why not try to be grammatically correct as well. You know, proper capitalization etc? <br>  <br>  To the poster..I am sorry for your loss. Losing a child is indescribable. I also lost a child to miscarriage. I can understand your pain. Have you thought about seeking out a support group or if you go to church, talking to your pastor? You are grieving and need to find a way to deal with that grief before having another child. I am glad that you are trying to prevent any other pregnancies at this time, because I really believe that you need to take care of yourself at this point. Good luck, and again, my condolences for your loss.|`|UwwNpgntaa	awww im also 17 and pregnant but in just a few days im getting an abortion. i really want to have this baby and really sad that i have to give it up but i thought about how hard life would be for the baby and myself. my mom just finished her chemo a few months ago and is still looking for a job so she really wont b able to help if i decided to have the baby and my bf and i cnt really afford to have one rite now.. so for now just focus on school and have fun with your friends and think about how awesome it would be in the future to be able to give your kid everything he/she might need/want|`|uGinKU6Baa	You still have loads of time to become a Mother once again, perhaps think back to when you became pregnant and reflect on all of the things you could have possibly wanted to finish in your life such as high school, college and so forth and focus on completing them...there is always time to get pregnant after all of that..it takes a great deal of money to raise children comfortably..set yourself up in a way that would make your road to parenting easier..<br>  <br>  I can relate to the pain of losing a baby via miscarriage and life-birth..but don't make your life harder on yourself then need be.<br>  <br>  Wishing you all of the best,|`|XkWTsyJdaa	thats not abnormal to feel that way. before just thinking about this baby u lost, think about preserving the childhood u have left. u hav a whole life ahead of u for this baby, and to make the best possible life for this "elijah", doing well in school/ going to college and starting off life normally will make sure u can get a better job to support him or her. think of the baby's life before wat u want. im not saying ur being selfish at all.|`|TRrTunqvaa	well.. maybe, for some reason you had a miscarriage because you werent meant to have that baby at that time. everything happens for a reason. the more you talk about your feelings, the more comfortable you will feel|`|mx3YK5rLaa	Sure it's normal for any woman to want a child at any age. We are women and giving birth is a huge part of a woman's life. However, you are way too young to be thinking about having another child. Be responsible, stay on birth control, and have a baby when you you are more financially and emotionally ready. Just know that someday in your future you will be able to give your child the world because you got that college education, you found that good job, and you waited for the love of your life to help make your dream of having a child a reality.|`|1z3C0R2Vaa	Finish collage first and then get yourself a well paid job baby can come after that good luck......)|`|m2aznd8xaa	that is tough for such a young girl .im sorry for your loss. it very normal to feel this way after such trauma. just focus on school and getting a good job to be able to give your next child everything you want. just keep occupied and wait til your more settled. you have so much time later on to have many babies.maybe this was Gods will and it just wasnt the right time. everyone has a path.  so sorry for your loss.and just think positive. your still young with so much potential .so have fun your only young for so long and once thoses teen years are over there is no turning back   bless you.|`|y5sWmbtnaa	It is a normal feeling to have as a woman. You are in a hormonal stage and I  don't know the stats on it but I am pretty sure a lot of teens ages of 12-17 have that feeling. Just know that its most likely better to focus on your education and career and that way when you do have a baby you are successful. Its hard with a baby and only some people really make it far with kids at a young age...<br>  <br>  I am incredibly sorry about Elijah.<br>  <br>  I was pregnant at 19 and I was so excited to have her, even though I was single. At 19 weeks I had a bad feeling and went to the doctor where they ended up doing a sonogram, they told me she had a heart problem and a tumor from her head to her tail bone. I was devastated. But now I know she wasn't meant to be. She was just meant to open my eyes.
AiJeS6I1aa	You have a panic/stress reaction.  This is relatively common.  But, you will survive delivery... You don't really have to look during the birth, and even if you did, the blood won't be coming out of your arm.  And, not all deliveries are bloody.  <br>  <br>  I'm assuming that you don't have this reaction every time you have a period.  Blood from delivery and afterwards, even though it can be in a slightly larger volume, will be similar to a period, and your brain will be able to make sense of this as this is a natural experience for your body that you already tolerate.<br>  <br>  Try not to worry.  This releases stress hormones in your body that your baby receives... not good for their development.  Seriously... life is too long and hard to make a big deal out of the small stuff.|`|Xg3CtRGWaa	When you have blood drawn there may be a quick drop in blood pressure which can cause dizziness, which in turn causes sweats, nausea, etc. I lost a lot of blood during delivery but it was over the course of several very long hours, so i did not experience any sudden drop in blood pressure. So for that particular fear I hope you are reassured.|`|mx3YK5rLaa	Believe me, you will not care about the blood, nor will you even see it (not unless you pull a superwoman trick and lean up real far to look).|`|HFWLYMD6aa	Don't you usually fast before you give blood? So it would be that your energy levels are down. So if you've had food and drink before labour and birth, you may not be as fainty!|`|vLOjcH7paa	I had a c-section. I saw no blood and felt no pain...maybe your delivery will be easy for you as well.<br>  <br>  Good Luck! Ask your Dr about precautions they can take for you.|`|1NIFJaThaa	If you're having a c section you wont see the blood because of a screen dividing you and whats happening behind there.<br>  <br>  If you're having a natural delivery there isn't blood everywhere either, after you've had the baby the blood you'll see will be much like having a period. So if you  have had to deal with a period all these years you are worrying for nothing at all.<br>  <br>  Of the birth itself yes its not all a bed of roses, but you'll forget about it and even smile when you remember the excitement that surrounds your baby being on his way. Please try to live in the moment and hey he gotta get out doesn't he.<br>  <br>  To pass the time read <a href="http://first-time-mom-baby.blogspot.com/." rel="nofollow">http://first-time-mom-baby.blogspot.com/...</a> I found alot of info there.|`|uNvF299Caa	Mine was normal, but I had an epidural injection.  I didn't feel a thing.  The doctor said push, but I had no idea if I was because I couldn't feel anything.  <br>  <br>  You shouldn't be scared.  Many women have given birth and they are fine.  You'll be fine.  Do you trust your doctor? Do you trust the hospital?  I think these are very important for you to feel safe.  <br>  <br>  Make sure you talk to you partner.  Let him know how you feel.  Tell him things you are ok and things you are not ok with so if something happens and you can't make the decisions, you want him to be your voice.  Tell him to read about birth, and be prepared as well. Tell him that's important for you that he is prepared as well. <br>  <br>  My husband took his laptop and movies that I liked, he also prepared a CD of my favorite relaxing songs.  <br>  <br>  Giving birth is very different from giving blood.  I too get dizzy and pass out when I give blood, it's normal.  But when time comes you'll feel different.  Oh, and after around week 35, 36 you can't wait for that baby to get out of you.  It gets harder to sleep and to feel comfortable.  Just enjoy while you can.  Good luck!|`|p2Njf5gBaa	First of honey,<br>  every women is nervous and has fears about labor.  Especially your first time, simply because its something you have never done before. <br>  <br>  I remember thinking around 8 months,  OMG, what did I get myself into.  Their is no turning back now, this babies going to have to come out some way!  <br>  <br>  Well, to my surprise,  once you are in labor, you get so caught up in everything that you don't really have time to worry or stress.  <br>  <br>  I was induced, in labor for over 14 hours,  and ended up with a c-section,  but I still think back on it as a wonderful day,  I even though it was fun.  It was such a magical day, and the anticipation of meeting your baby makes it oh so worth it.  <br>  <br>  And you know what,  I never saw one drop of blood through my whole labor.  You will be just fine.  Your fears are justified,  but you will be surprised at how you handle your labor!   Trust me,  its not that bad.  <br>  Your natural instinct will kick in and you'll do great!   If it were that bad,  women wouldn't keep getting pregnant!!|`|M798dyZYaa	They will have IV's in you during your labor. They put them in the moment you get to the hospital, this way they can prevent things like this. It will be supplying you with antibiotics, fluids, etc, everything that can help you stay awake, focused, and healthy during delivery. IF you do happen to pass out, depending on what stage of the delivery you're in, they will most likely have one or two nurses helping wake you up and get you comfortable, while the doctor and a few others work with the baby. If you pass out while pushing, the doctor may resort to C-section, so make sure you talk that over with him/her before labor. <br>  <br>  I had a very similar issue, and this is what they did for me, and what they told me before delivery.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|HqOkC2YHaa	Honestly I was once sitting in your situations except for the dizziness and what not.<br>  <br>  But your adrenaline is going to kick in and you're just going to be happy to see your baby and it doesn't matter how, how long, or how much it hurts because you know in a couple of hours that baby will be in your arms!<br>  <br>  It might seem like a traumatic experience while you're going through it (the worst part is the contractions I went 9cm without the epidural...and trust me you want it lol) but in the end I only vaguely remember the birth of my daughter. Like I remember certain parts of it but I seemed to have blocked out all the bad parts lol<br>  <br>  so good luck, don't get too worked up over it!|`|8oAlBL91aa	I was going to say maybe it's because your scared of blood. Seriously don't look at it next time and see what happens you never know. <br>  <br>  Honestly I don't remember having to get blood work while I was in labor so you might not have to. You do however get an IV.|`|7SKVCPcSaa	before your birth inform all the doctors and nurses that you have that blood phobia (which a lot of people have. you're not alone!) and tell them that you don't want your baby until he has been washed off and cleaned up. and then you DO NOT want to see the placenta. and just ask them if they can avoid making you see blood as much as possible. explain to them that you KNOW you'll see some blood and that they aren't really miracle workers who can prevent any sight of blood at all, but they can at least try to do their best! <br>  <br>  if it is going to physically make you ill and unable to function then they HAVE to take that into consideration.<br>  <br>  good luck!<br>  <br>  <br>  oh, and you do know that after you give birth you bleed for a good 2 weeks, right?|`|wDJRyzE9aa	First congratulations on your soon-to-be-motherhood!  Its totally natural to be scared.  You can take comfort in knowing there are nearly 6 billion with a "B" people in this world and they were ALL born to someone who had never done it before once.<br>  <br>  Under normal circumstances, you do not really "lose a lot" of blood during delivery.  That which comes with the baby is a combination of fluid that surrounded the baby and some blood but the fact is it looks like more.  <br>  <br>  Think of it as taking a quart of milk in a jug and mixing it with 1 cup of coffee.  If you then spilled the whole container, it might seem like a lot of coffee but most of it was milk all along.  It's not the greatest analogy, but you get the idea.<br>  <br>  Every birth experience is different for each woman.  Try to devote about a half hour every day to practice breathing relaxation techniques.   If you do not know any, look for examples on the web.  Yoga or other meditation techniques are the best.  These techniques will help you to be calm and free your mind from the worry.  <br>  <br>  The birth of your baby will be something very special.  Don't worry.
TQW5E6olaa	That they're human, they make mistakes, that they get happy over silly things and that they're supportive of eachother, I really like that.|`|G9ywiLqvaa	there are a brilliant few here who are just so real.  the kind whom i won't hesitate making actual friends with in real life. :)<br>  <br>  they give fabulous advice one minute, and then ask an innocent question the next.  they accept the fact that they may know more than others sometimes, but they also accept the fact that they don't know everything.  they make mistakes, but they will always be there to give you genuine help when they know how.  <br>  <br>  and, they're the moms (and dads) who have a GREAT SENSE OF HUMOR!  they know that parenting is tough, but it's not the military.  we can all have fun and be crazy once in a while.  that's normal!<br>  <br>  i know you didn't ask, but the parents i don't like on here are those who think they're perfect.  that they have the best parenting skills.  please!  i'd like to see a book written about your greatness before i give you my time of day.  lol!|`|AA12145826	I love how *real* they all are. I know that sounds cliche but its nice that not everyone is pretending to be the world's greatest parent. We all have faults and most of the other moms I connect with share my same sense of humor. We feel free to laugh at some of our less than stellar moments because we all acknowledge that we've been there before (maybe not the same exact situation but what parent hasn't been publicly embarrassed by their child at some point).|`|nrqWwQBXaa	i love how nice and friendly they are?

I GOT ONE!<br>  <br>  I said 'i love you' to<br>  <br>  one of my friends,<br>  <br>  Ashleighlynne.<br>  <br>  idk where that came from.<br>  <br>  i think she's a beetch.<br>  <br>  WTF NO SHE"S NOT!!!!! SHES NICE!  :)<br>  <br>  sorry, that was my friend ava.... hehe. she's craaaazyyy.|`|fa571b1e23d4b992ac1d5df0e55b19a3aa	haha i say that to my friends all the time!<br>  Me: Can i have a pencil?<br>  Them: No,<br>  Me:Please?<br>  Them: Fine. here you go.<br>  Me:Thank you! I LOVE YOUUUU!<br>  <br>   I also said it to my exboyfriend to make the big baby happy|`|oA0e5nHqaa	not really..i hate saying that to riends..gross. maybe once as a joke like "haha ur so funny, i love you." i never say i love u unless i mean it|`|NYJgiVxraa	a cuople of my ex's.|`|kRaVa0Wraa	no. <br>  i say "i love you" to my friends too. and i do love them.<br>  im not iN love with them obviously, but i do love them :)|`|A3zAXntxaa	My aunt and my step-mom.<br>  <br>  I don't really know if I mean it, because I DO love them.<br>  But it just feels strange to say it. I dunno why?|`|YQrKQ5PAaa	I think I've said it to a few family members and not meant it. I mean, just because they're my family, does not mean I love them. I like to actually know a person and the like before loving them. If that makes sense... I just don't think sharing blood should automatically mean I love someone. I usually mean it, though.|`|H0sPCJQPaa	I say it to my friends who are girls.<br>  but I don't mean it as i LOve you love you<br>  <br>  I just mean it i love you as a friend get it?<br>  <br>  And In case you don't go back to my question.<br>  <br>  You know those pool things that you blow up? That in Bike form is a Blow up bike. And it worked in my dream eh ?|`|HQyVeaPPaa	my last boyfriend. i only said i love him because he said he loved me.<br>  but my ex before him is a whole nother story...<br>  i actually did love him :[|`|c55O7jqXaa	None. I don't say it if I don't mean it.
uPTJM3m9aa	lmao thats funny<br>  thats okay<br>  one time i had a dream that i had a blow up house and when you blew it up it was a real house lol<br>  when my mom woke me up and said get ready for school i said not until i get my blow up house haha<br>  how embarrassing. <br>  and i dont think i means any thing maybe you want a bike? <br>  ha idk|`|6hb04Ow0aa	It probably doesn't mean anything. Most of my dreams don't. But I don't know you, so it could mean something to you. There's a Dream Interpretation section on here somewhere, you'd probably get more answers there.|`|fWWYc2UZaa	you're right, thats funny.<br>  so wtf is a blow-up bike? :P|`|fa571b1e23d4b992ac1d5df0e55b19a3aa	It made me smile. Just imagining a blow up bike. haha<br>  <br>  And Sabrina.....you. got. told. BURN|`|k2M2Ah8Saa	i agree w/ 1st answer..<br>  what is a blow up bike???<br>  <br>  <br>  hahahah funny dream ;)|`|2zXou33aaa	LOL that really did make my day actually! blow up bikes? haha :) anyway, I don't think it means anything honestly. Just one of those random dreams we all get from time to time that make absolutely no sense whatsoever! hehe but thanx 4 the laugh :))|`|E7ViD8EWaa	It could mean there is a adventure in your near future?<br>  ...Perhaps involving blow up bikes? XD<br>  <br>  It totally made my day! Star!<br>  <br>  =]
130df77840211884c0142ac3fabd5beeaa	LOL yes...that show is funny. I think it would be kind of unfair to your daughters because the one named Quinn would be named after the pretty, bubbly one and Daria would be named after the sarcastic outcast. <br>  <br>  The little girl named Daria probably wonder was she was chosen to be named after her =\   So personally, I wouldn't do it!|`|SCY0bOr5aa	Ummm....Wow...My first thought was "Dairy Queen" I am sorry not trying to be rude.|`|6SwaWSoyaa	I love the name Daria it is so cute and pretty.<br>  I love the name Quinn.....but for a boy.<br>  I think you should do it, because it seems like you are referencing it to Dairy Queen. Lol However, is this not from a show?|`|IU4uNH97aa	isn't those girls that switch bodies ?<br>  but if it's not then i wouldn't know plus i don't think alot of people know about that so i think if you really wanted to name girls this then you should. I like the name Quinn not so much Daria because it makes me think of  diarrhea ...|`|7uznrLBXaa	Is that show even still on?  Wasn't it only for for a season or two? My first through was Dairy Queen, actually. <br>  <br>  Quinn is not a suitable name for a female.  Take it from someone whose parents gave her a male/unisex name :)|`|ot0TqzSvaa	isnt that the cartoon with Daria with the glasses and theyr really wierd?<br>  oh but i wouldnt worry about it, not many people would make that association. Theyr pretty alright names<br>  <br>  ? Bee|`|JVvnET59aa	No???|`|cy8jcW6laa	Lets just hope they don't come out dysfunctional like the characters in the cartoon!|`|n0WnEIopaa	DARIY QUEEN!!!!! MMM BLIZZARDS|`|MgpVJwS2aa	Ahh yes, that show Daria that use to be on MTV.<br>  :)|`|6hb04Ow0aa	Nope!
wnBkuzpzaa	Haha I just laughed my head off at Nias "scary dream" I don't even know why it was funny to me, but I giggled =)<br>  <br>  The wierdest dream i've ever had was I dreamed that I was going strawberry picking and all the sudden a rabbit popped up next to a plant and started crying. And so then I wanted to help it, but when I went to hug it, it turned into a soap bubble and I screamed and woke up. I'm not sure what that was about.|`|GHnkKwl3aa	The Orca Whale-Home Depot Dream. <br>  <br>  I think the name speaks volumes about how odd it was.<br>  <br>  By far THE most random dream I've ever had, but also the funniest.<br>  <br>  I was in Home Depot trying to buy a box of 16 ct. crayons so I walked through screaming "WHERE ARE THE FREAKING CRAYONS?!", then turned down an aisle and all the sudden was in one of those McDonald's playhouse tunnels at the top of the tube slide, slid down really quickly (I was apparently running from someone at that point), then when I got to the bottom of the slide I was in the middle of the woods and turned to my right and there was half a cabin, the part that was facing me was wall-less, so I walked up and looked out the window to this really shallow creek that had Orca whales jumping in it.<br>  <br>  LMAO|`|A3zAXntxaa	The weirdest dream I've ever had was when I was in New Mexico with my grandma and we had to stay at her friends house, it was like freaky, and I fell asleep thinking about what might come out of the closet in front of me. <br>  <br>  So yeah, I had a dream I was tied up and this girl with really stringy, ugly hair was in front of me, she had pig tails and like sweat falling from her head. I was like screaming for help and then she turned around and her nose was like 100000000000ft long and she was laughing trying to stab me in the eyes with it. It was by far the scariest dream I've ever had, and I know it sounds dumb and all, but it was so friggen scary.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The funniest:<br>  Well this chick was going around school starting rumors like how I committed suicide and how I'm apparently a lesbian, and I just had a dream that I killed her and I was pushing her head in the toilets, it's sounds bad, but it was pretty funny to me :D.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Sorry if that too long, ha|`|XCDd3hELaa	okay im not even kidding i have the WEIRDEST dreams ever.<br>  <br>  like a couple days ago,<br>  <br>  I had a dream that my friends and I were at my house and everyone but me was having a beer watching barney, well then we all went outside to go for a walk because apprently my friend wanted some flowers to give to her cousin because she was sick, so we were walking up in the mountains/hills looking for some flowers and i was all like dude im so thirsty, but we kept looking and we were following a trail, and on the trail was like a lemonade stand selling starbucks coffee and i was all like yum! i want some so i go over there and im all like heyy can i get a grand double chocolatle chip frappachino extra chocolate and chip and shes all like sure! and she whipped it up for me then she was alll like your total comes to 13.00 or something like that and i was like ohhhh sh*t. and i started freaking out and then found 12 dollars in my pocket and i couldnt find a dollar so i went and asked this guy who was sitting on a rock and he was smoking and i was all like dude i needa dollar do you think you could hit me up with one? and he was all like duddddeeeeeee relaxxxx i got one rrriiigggghhhttt here. so he gave me a dollar and i got my frap and i was all like that guy is cool so i went over there and asked him what his name was and he was like my names bob marly whats yours? and i had this weird convo about legalizing marijuana with bob marley...... it was funny though|`|9OdrWhRRaa	I went on a school trip. <br>  I was getting on the train with my class but then armed men came towards us and pointed the gun in our faces. Then my friend went forward and took her own life instead of ours.<br>  <br>  Weird!|`|Q08GpskDaa	Last week I had a dream I was a gold fish
9776485a7510046fa4388cd98356e6d6aa	I have been in a very stable relationship for 8 years and I didn't want children either we had his daughter from a previous relationship and that was good enough for me ...or so I thought.<br>  After all the long nights of partying and all the great stress free days I found myself longing for something .<br>  I made up all these excuses why I didn't want children .Everything from me not being responsible enough to me not wanting to ruin my body .<br>  While one day the b/f and I where doing the deed and he said he wishes I could be the mother of his children..... Well at that point my life changed.<br>  I decided I did want children after all and we tried and tried and finally it happened.<br>  IYou could change your mind in one defining moment in life.|`|O3EtP4vOaa	Some people just never want children, I know a few and I know a few who have changed their mind and then regretted ever having children.  Personally I always wanted to be a mom, but I have never ever wanted to get married.  I was 28 and with a guy for 3 years and all of the sudden I was like "I want to marry you???"  He was as surprised as I was.  He had always thought of himself getting married and when he met me he was fine with just being together forever and not needing the piece of paper legalizing us.  We have now been together for almost 6 yrs and are still trying for 5 yrs for a first baby, and we are happily married.<br>  <br>  Sometimes you do change your mind as you get older and things in life change, but just do what ever is right for you.  Never say never always keep an open mind and if you do not ever want a child then that is your business.|`|rFwGnZIJaa	I changed my mine but that doesn't mean you will. My aunt never wanted kids and still doesn't. She is over 40. She enjoys her life and her decision. I on the other hand didn't want kids because my brother is a very difficult child. I didn't want to have children to have them turn out like him. When I met my husband though, I knew I wanted to have a family with him. It's different for every woman. Don't feel like not having kids is a bad thing and don't let others make you feel that way. If you don't want kids then don't.|`|rBq189W1aa	Just nod your head and say, "Yeah, maybe I will."<br>  <br>  I don't see what the big deal is on either side of the discussion. Is this an argument you *have* to win *today*?|`|MeYILJeSaa	No, I don't necessarily think that's true.<br>  I mean, you COULD change your mind. <br>  But kids aren't for everyone. :)|`|qYZ2QFlbaa	not everyone wants kids, but you might, who knows, people change....|`|30iqJREVaa	That's OK, no one can tell you if or when to have kids|`|eg3ImKfHaa	I am 46. I had my son when I was 39 and my daughter when I was 40. They are now in 1st Grade and Kindergarten. <br>  <br>  I can honestly say that for **ME**, I often wish that I had started having children at a younger age. When I was your age, I thought that I NEVER wanted to have children. I spent my life on the pill and avoiding pregnancy like the plague. I was too involved in having fun, partying and doing whatever it was that **I** wanted to do. <br>  <br>  I had some gratifying relationships with the men in my life and, when that was unfulfilling, I rationalized that I had a dog to love unconditionally and thought that was best. No crying, screaming babies. No shoes to buy. When I wanted to go away, I boarded the dog and hit the road. <br>  <br>  It wasn't until I was in my mid 30's that I started to wonder if there wasn't something more. That's about the time I quit smoking pot and partying all the time...I decided I wanted to grow up. I had avoided any real responsibility or anything that was really meaningful in my life. I started to look at what other's had. What had I been missing? Why were they happy, when I was not? <br>  <br>  I am not saying that YOU or anyone else will become "happy" simply by having a child. In my own experience, it has been the single most gratifying and awesome thing I could have ever imagined. I do wish that I had started at a younger age, only so that I could have had more children and that I had more energy! <br>  <br>  I believe that I am a more patient and relaxed mother because of my age. I think that I may have resented the time it takes, had I had children in my 20's. Now, I am happy to go to the Kung Fu lessons, the school Christmas Programs, the class parties. I am blessed.<br>  <br>  Do whatever your heart says to do, just leave the option open.|`|DnNkCF6Taa	I think there is a chance at some point you might change your mind on kids, when you look down the road nd see a career and see that you might want them, or you can decide you would want to do more traveling than having kids and keep that going.  I don't think you change your mind about having kids, I think as you grow older your beliefs and feelings toward a lot of things change with time.|`|uhchod38aa	I never wanted kids either, until I had some. Never really liked children. Now I just don't like other people's children. That thing about the bio clock is a cliche, but it can also be true. Some women never will want children and there is nothing wrong with that. I'm not saying you're unnatural for not wanting them; but you're probably going to live for like another 60 years. How do you know what you'll want 15 or 20 years from now?|`|qWNSRq4xaa	I'm 34, and when I was your age I had no interest in children myself. But, just as you put it, out of nowhere I had this need to be a father and care for a child. It was this new purpose in life that I felt, and I have no idea where it came from. But now, two adorable little girls later and I couldn't imagine life without them. They are the coolest people I've ever met. The phrase unconditional love finally made sense to me when they arrived!|`|GomqF0bfaa	I know that you didn't want answers from someone who is 18 and under, but I figured I'd answer anyways since I went through the same thing.<br>  <br>  I honestly never wanted kids, ever, and neither did my fiance. But of course, even while being careful, I fell pregnant. It's the best thing that has ever happened to me, even though I said that I never wanted kids. Although I cannot go out like all my other friends do, I actually much rather hang out with my fiance and my baby boy.<br>  <br>  I think that it can be true in some circumstances. I have a few friends that are in their 40's that never wanted kids, and never did. I also have a friend who is 23 and has 2 children with another on the way. She always said that she wanted a huge family. I guess it all depends on what will happen in the future. Maybe one day you'll find love and actually want children with that person, or maybe you won't.|`|VS78dqO9aa	honeslty some people aren't just kid people.   BUt I know several people who said they didn't want kids, and whether they just changed their mind at some point in life, or it was an accident, they all love their children and wouldn't trade them for anything.  But people probably tell you that you will change your mind, simply because you are so young.  Me!!!  I have always known I want to be a mom.  It's the only thing I want to do.|`|UeffSgRuaa	kids arent ment for everyone.. if you dont want a kid than dont have one.. everyone has there own mines and thought about everything.. maybe in your life style you dont want to have kids.. its cool.. everyone is different.. well maybe if you have a brother or a sister and they have kids you can spoil them lol.. <br>  <br>  but if you dont want a kid.. make sure you are on some type of birth control. <br>  <br>  have a nice day.. oo btw i am 20|`|GwWDnvB8aa	I said I didn't want kids until I was married for a couple years--and suddenly, I realized I did want kids. Sometimes, we just need to grow up before we really realize what we want. Most people do end up realizing they want children. Some never change their minds, though.|`|hORVMOHKaa	i actually never wanted kids either, but as you predicted when i met my husband i all of sudden wanted to have kids. You may never want kids and thats fine, but also you might change your mind<br>  <br>  <br>  i know i look young but im 21|`|2GGgllKeaa	I am 14 and I am answering just because you said not to. So why wouldn't you want someone like me around lulllllllzzzzzz. :-D|`|3EiOobEVaa	Truthfully you might not change your mind. I thought that I didn't want children but I eventually changed my mind. But that would be up to you on if you change your mind.|`|98qMZZPlaa	I am 37 with 5 kids.  I'll try not to be bias.  Right now you are really young.  I think not wanting kids at your age is perfectly normal.  You still have another 10 years, really to decide.<br>  <br>  But, from experience, people i know who never wanted kids and are in their 40's now, in one way or another regret that decision.  An older friend of mine has no children and had been married for 25 years to a man she adored.  they loved their life together and "Did not want to spoil it with kids".. Her husband passed away last year.  She has been distraught for over a year now and does not know what to do with herself.  I totally can understand what she is going through.  My kids are my life and i go away on vacations just to show my children this beautifull world.  Without them, i think i would be bored.  Thats just my decision though.<br>  <br>  But at 20, i really wasnt even thinking of kids.  At the end of the day, that decision is yours to make, so best wishes with whatever it is you decide on.|`|bbe253b8bd16b56edbb017e1a281d44eaa	I feel that people should make that choice for themselves.Why bring another unwanted child into this world just for the benefit of saying I'm a mother? I am 23 years old soon to be 24 and have 2 wonderful baby boys...I never dreamed of having kids just always sort of knew I wanted to experience motherhood in my life.Now I wouldn't have it any other way...my boys are everything to me.Personally I think if I really thought I did not want children I would at least leave the option open until I reached the end of my childbearing years.Use birth control in the meantime that way nothing is permanent. For me I want lots of children b/c I believe a house is lonely and depressing without the laughter and happiness kids bring to it,I want to carry on our family name, and want to know that I'm capable of raising great people(the world could use some more good ones with all the bad ones out there in full abundance lol). Without my children I would not get to experience some of the things they have taught me and brought to my life.With this said I'm also a adamant believer that someone who feels they can not bring a child into a loving, stable environment should not have children.Its not something material that you can just get a refund on once you've used them....be wise about your choice and follow your heart~|`|FvhCUHjxaa	If you have never wanted kids then you've never wanted kids and that's perfectly okay. Were the same age and I'm on the other end, I've always wanted a large family and that isn't going to change anytime soon. Different strokes for different folks, don't let anybody change your mind if you don't want kids.|`|PfE6bg5iaa	hey lollipop,<br>  <br>  I'm about two years older than you, and I felt the exact same way that you do. I'm the oldest of 6 kids (ages currently between 2 and 15 yrs), and after seeing my mom go through pregnancy over and over again, so uncomfortable and tired, it just completely turned me off to the idea. And then the birth, ugh I'm not sure I could handle that kind of pain. Then after they are born, they cry all the time, you're up all night feeding them for the first couple months. I used to get so frustrated babysitting my little brothers and sisters because sometimes they just don't listen!<br>  <br>  Seriously, I just told people that I would adopt to shut them up! <br>  <br>  Even when I was with the right guy, whom I'm engaged to now after 6 years of dating. I really feel like something just clicked in me, within the last year, that suddenly made me want to have my own children and be a mom someday. It's the weirdest thing, especially since for so long I had no interest in it at all and couldn't even understand how anything could change my mind. I'm certainly not rushing into it, we don't want kids until we're in our late twenties.<br>  <br>  So it's very possible that the same is going to happen to you. But there's a lot of people out there that really just don't want kids -- nothing wrong with that, it's a life-style choice, and probably a more fun-filled life if you're into travel and such! Just know that this is something you have to be upfront with your partner about, because kids are very important to some people.<br>  <br>  So I think you should just keep an open-mind for now, don't get so stubborn about it that you don't allow yourself to change your mind but also know that there's nothing wrong with you if you never change your mind!<br>  <br>  Good luck :-)|`|NI8D46J0aa	You will be surprised at the things that will change as you get older.  I always babysat when I was younger and just always assumed I'd have kids. I always loved them. I can't say it will change for you for sure.  Right now, you are probably not at a place in your life where you can see yourself having kids, but 20 is still pretty young.  I had my first at 23 and can't imagine having her much earlier.   There are people who just never want kids and never have kids.  My aunt and uncle never did and were perfectly happy. That is just a personal choice you will have to make.|`|nBGjPwViaa	Just because most of us want kids doesn't mean we all are going to want that...<br>  My sister never wanted kids -- I have two.<br>  I think this is totally up to you.<br>  I completely respect each person's decision.<br>  If you change your mind later, fine.<br>  If you don't, fine.<br>  You ARE kinda young, though, so keep an open mind...<br>  You never really know what life is going to throw your way!!|`|syrh8J6Vaa	I had a child at 20 and another one at 21.  I swore I Would never want another one so i had my tubes tied.  Here I am at 30 wishing I had never done it and realize how childish I was.  Now I am going to have to go through surgery and pay $6,200.00 to try to have another baby.  You will not understand until you are older.  Things change, people change life changes.|`|6ITgXvBWaa	I was like you I never wanted kids, never liked to baby sit. Just never really liked kids in the first place. <br>  <br>  Then I got pregnant unexpectedly. Now Im a little more excited to have a baby that is my own. For a while I was still on the "I dont want kids" thing. But that has changed.
ua9GsHMjaa	Probably because kids in general don't like to wear clothes. If society didn't dictate that parents clothe their kids, we'd probably have a lot of naked kids running around. Even on the odd times I find myself at a textile beach or a public pool I always see at least one toddler who is having some issue with wearing a bathing suit. I can understand the pajama thing too. I hated going to sleepovers and having to wear one when I was a kid. I was raised in a nudist family, so pajamas were not widely used. While we didn't always go nude around the house, no one really wore PJs to bed, even in winter.|`|ppKQEhEMaa	Its not going to affect her health<br>  <br>  just like adults, some kids prefer sleeping in the nude too.|`|ntdGOZqGaa	My son is the same he is 2 1/2 years old and is always naked. He will keep clothes on out in public and when we get home in less then 3 mins he is butt naked running wild lol I dont have a problem with it I just make sure he has clothes on when company comes over. he is still little and its not like he is 5 and doing this. They all out grow it, and think about how it must feel it must feel good like a free feeling. Lucky them thats all I got to say lol|`|hPagd7N2aa	It's alright right now because it's still pretty hot during the night, but when it gets to winter she might decide by herself that it's too cold to sleep in the nude. If not make her wear them.|`|JZe5Hy77aa	simple almost all little kids go though this stage evetually|`|YtCAJb7Faa	my 2 year old son have this same problem and i don't know what to do|`|V4U65uidaa	my little sister when she was 3 years old she slept nude to so it's okay just leave her alone and talk to her about sleeping with PJ'S so its normal she slept with pajamas  when she was 4 or 5 years old
8C87ZfMwaa	VERY VERY VERY VERY RUDE!!!!!!<br>  <br>  I have had someone do this to me.  She was my best friend and pregnant and she also knew i was going to have another baby but wasn't ready at that stage.  <br>  Anyway, she called me up and told me she was going to use my baby name.  I spoke with her reasonably about her having to change her mind as it was the name i was going to use but she refused.  She said it was the only name her and her husband agreed on.<br>  We haven't spoken since, she ended up having her baby and using my name and that was nearly 2 years ago now.  I don't think people understand how much it hurts to have your baby name ripped from beneath you especially when you have wanted to use the name for so long.<br>  You need to confront them about it and if they still use the name it will cause all sorts of problems and fights.  It is not something you just get over.<br>  I really hope you conceive soon and your baby dreams come true.  I thankfully have never had any problems falling pregnant but have supported many friends through it.  Baby dust to you xxx :)|`|7DcNVvaRaa	Go ahead and and name your child whatever you want to.  So what if there are two Noah's in the family.  You broke the unspoken rule of telling others your favorite baby name and someone latched on to it.  She who is pregnant first gets to name their child whatever they want to.  <br>  <br>  However, just go ahead and tell them now that you still intend on naming your child Noah.|`|K1lRZmxXaa	I would tell her that you have had that named picked out since forever ago and you need to find another name because that is really rude and disrespectful that you are going to do that to me....use another name like evan, steven, or taylor!!!!|`|be40588ae7c28e63b468da0087e4f8f9aa	I am so sorry!  Babydust to you.<br>  <br>  I have read enough to know that the number ONE baby name rule is to NEVER share your baby name with someone who has the potential to steal it!!<br>  <br>  How far along is she? I imagine they will end up going with something else.|`|J4kSN7YVaa	She might think it would be "special" to use the name you love. Have a heart to heart about how it would be even more special if she could use Matthew and save the beloved Noah for you! <br>  <br>  Good luck with everything!! :-)|`|yKS2UI87aa	Wow, if you brother knew than I would tell him up front that you had already picked that name and have a little respect for you and choose a different name. Totally Rude on his part. Hopefully if you tell him he'll change his mind.|`|6hb04Ow0aa	How could they! They should know how hard falling pregnant is for you and that Noah is YOUR, you've been telling them for four years! I think you should tell your brother this- he should understand how important it is to you!|`|e1d737ecf0f11ed65f51b189ae2f0b03aa	That happened to both myself AND my daughter.<br>  <br>  Is it possible that she thinks she’s doing this for you?  She may think you won’t have a child and she’s being misguidedly sweet and giving you your Noah.<br>  <br>  After talking to her, if that isn’t the case then it’s time to bring in the big guns....the grandmas.  Older women understand the long term impact of one decision.  They need to impress on this girl that if she wants to be accepted in this family she better respect you!  Also your brother needs to man up and put his sis first this time.<br>  <br>  Regarding fertility....try some homeopathic routes.  I had a friend who kept miscarrying until she went to an irridologist, discovered she had parasites in her ovaries, did the cleansing treatment then had twins!  It can be as simple as that.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|cy8jcW6laa	That's a very sticky situation but in the first place, baby names that you love should NEVER be disclosed to anyone.  It should be kept private, especially to avoid instances like this.  You could confront her but, next time, if you have a name that you really would love for your unborn children, NEVER tell anyone! And good luck trying! When you do have your baby and whether or not its name is Noah, just know that the baby would be one exceptional being! :)|`|9Vs22JmGaa	say, "i think thats sort of ignorant of you to take my babys name i have had it planned it out for about 4 years, im not trying to be rude or anything, but you should just name him mathew"|`|sDZqabbxaa	Confront her.<br>  That's VERY disrespectful, and really rude.<br>  <br>  Cute name by the way!|`|wRHhpanmaa	I would confront her. It seems to me she was doing this to be spiteful.<br>  <br>  however, you must think that If she did it to be mean, there is no way you can actually stop her from naming her baby that, and she may go ahead and do it just to be rude, and rub it in.<br>  <br>  However I do agree either way it was a really rude thing she did.<br>  <br>  You can tell your brother how you feel and perhaps he can talk her into picking another name.<br>  <br>  or perhaps if she isn't that far along, hope and pray she has a girl!|`|CMuL7XpKaa	Are you due first? Tell her brother to use Matthew Nicholas|`|VUfT35UQaa	Tell her that you chose that name for your child, and you said so in the beginning! From the sounds of her, she isn't a nice person. If you can not conceive, there is always adoption - giving a child love and a home.|`|ot0TqzSvaa	Definately tell them not to use it.<br>  You'll regret it if you dont.<br>  <br>  Anyway, there are heaps of good names out there.<br>  Maybe suggest Nolan? its kinda similar.<br>  Try to get them to change their mind by offering other, similar, names.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps,<br>  ? Bee|`|KOcCenrEaa	voice your opinion or ask them to use Noah for a middle instead<br>  because you want to use it as a first.|`|mx3YK5rLaa	Uh, kick her a**!!!|`|GlzVQclpaa	Definately say something tell her how it really hurts you and that you have been trying to get pregnant for a long time and have had that name picked out for years. Whatever you do dont tell her she CANT name her baby that because then she will do it just to piss you off and show you that you can't control what they name their baby. The best thing to do is sit down and tell her how it hurts you and not try to tell her she CANT name her baby something.
AA11831450	Normal. I did do a lot of laundry in the morning which was not usual for me. I felt like I was walking like a duck that day too! My stomach started tightening and staying tight for a full minute. This happened every 4 minutes. I didn't think it was labour though because on TV the cab is flying and the lady is screaming at 4 minutes apart contractions...right! LOL. I had no pain so I just thought it was weird. Cute baby a couple hours later! I was 10 days late.|`|eV7rtxmuaa	I felt completely normal... then BANG... it hit me like a tone of bricks!|`|iko1uqBnaa	I have three little girls and each labor was different but I felt completely normal (for being pregnant) up until I went into labor, with the first one I started to get contractions that were different and stronger than the braxton hicks I had been having (you will be able to tell immediately) and they were very gradual to grow in strength and frequency my second I was induced so no help there but my third the nurses told me I wasn't in labor to them I was having braxton hicks but I knew better she was born in under 15 mins (from 3 centimeter to all the way out) the doc didn't have time to get there they didn't even get me in stirrups. you will know when it is happening|`|YmZbtFxtaa	I wasn't feeling to good. I just had this miserable feeling, then later on that night I starting having contractions. The baby usually comes when you least expect it. Just be patient and hang in there.
ZDMUW1YRaa	Alot of things are happening, is this your first pregnancy?  Well, rest assured that you are a week away from bieng 12 weeks which means your in the clear from miscarriage.  Now, the tightness is the ligaments and it's your uterus stretching  to prepare for baby.  The movement is your baby moving but you won't feel the full on kicks until 20 weeks for now it's called fluttering, it can be compared to the feelign of muscles twitching...that's definitely your baby movimg, you will feel it alot stronger at 20 weeks bur for now that's what you are feeling.  The tightness is stretching so no worries....|`|bb7b4M9Xaa	As your uterus is growing, expect a lot of pressure, tightening & even sometimes pain...it's totally normal...good luck! :)
wRHhpanmaa	They are both beautiful names...<br>  <br>  however if i had to choose i think Kimberly Noelle...it just flows better<br>  <br>  or Emmalin Noelle...that one is pretty too.|`|95Xn7PkJaa	I like Emmalin Claire better, but I don't like the spelling of Emmalin so much.  How about Emmalyn?|`|BG2BTDT3aa	Kimberly Noelle...

They are both beautiful names!<br>  <br>  <br>  :)|`|6hb04Ow0aa	Emmalin Claire but I'd spell it Emmaline personally, Emmalin looks kinda unfinished to me.|`|JVvnET59aa	I like Emmalin Claire!!

uhchod38aa	Your 3 are good. Here are more:<br>  <br>  1. Being able to sleep past 6 a.m. any dang morning.<br>  <br>  2. Being able to leave the house on a whim without first having to pack a diaper bag, snacks, drinks, toys, changes of clothes, and without having to calculate if the trip will interfere with meals or naptime.<br>  <br>  3. Being able to do common tasks like pay bills or do laundry while being "assisted" by small people. If you give up and wait for their bedtime, being able to stay awake long enough to get chores done...before they wake up at 6 a.m.<br>  <br>  4. Having extra money or a social life that does not revolve around your children. <br>  <br>  5. Being able to take vacation and actually relax. <br>  <br>  6. Anything involving fecal matter.<br>  <br>  7. Afternoon Delight. <br>  <br>  8. Not constantly having to be vigilant against unexpected danger. To this day, I don't know how she got on top of the icebox. Okay, I'm joking there. But no matter how careful and watchful you are, if there is a way for them to cause property damage or bodily injury, they will find it. <br>  <br>  9. Being able to go to a restaurant and enjoy a cup of coffee without your little angels trying to spit juice at one another because its funny. Or how about when your kid is screaming at the top of her lungs in the checkout lane at Wal-Mart because you won't buy her candy. The people without kids are staring at you like you must be a horrible mother for your child to be screaming like that. They are thinking, "If I had children, they would never act like that." Yeah right, dream on. <br>  <br>  10. Not having to hide the condoms. Otherwise one day you will find the floor littered with opened wrappers while the children are running up and down the stairs, trying to blow up your rubbers.|`|g9vw4ovGaa	Being able to poop in peace without little fingers under the door<br>  <br>  Being able to eat MY dinner, without my daughter running up with her mouth wide open.<br>  <br>  Not stepping on those little child protector plugs in the middle of the night, because she knows how to pull them out<br>  <br>  Not having those stupid child locks on the cabinets<br>  <br>  Not waking up way too early to find that my daughter has taken her diaper off in the middle of the night and decided to use the floor instead.<br>  <br>  Being able to take a shower, a real one, without having her cry until I open the curtain enough to where she can watch the entire time.<br>  Then in turn try's to shave her legs with a spoon, that was found stuck to the back of her leg.<br>  <br>  Oh I forgot about hididng MY toys, because now she knows how to open drawers and bring them out when ever we have company over.|`|b6EyFLgUaa	Never having to clean one more poopy diaper, IT WILL COME. No more crayon to clean off the walls, not finding that missing spoon stuck to the cat. Oh how the list could go on.<br>  <br>  EDIT-LOL it was a few times  but the most recent was ( and this is why it normally happens). My daughter eats at a little table in the living room because who ever built our house forgot a dinning room or that you needed a table to eat at ( yea odd i know) so she was eating at her table and I was in the kitchen cleaning off the stove after making her lunch. I came back in to the living room and she was eating her pudding with her fingers. Well thats a big no no so the pudding was taken away. I didnt even think about the missing spoon and where is might have gone. So after she was cleaning up and settled with her crayons I started to wonder. I then looked over at our cat who was acting very oddly and walked over to see what was wrong this poor guy ( hes kinda big, 14 years old and has a little head) he had my daughters spoon stuck to the side of his fur where he must have lied down on it. I was trying not to laugh but it was a funny sight.<br>  <br>  Again to do with the cat, my daughter likes to sit on him and ride him like a pony yelling "RIDE IT, RIDE IT". He tolerates it but im sure he cant wait till shes to old for that too.|`|VS78dqO9aa	Honestly, to be able to talk on the phone without the other person thinking i'm crazy for studdering so much becuase every 10 words out of of my mouth, I'm pausing to say something to my child...|`|TQW5E6olaa	1. I 2nd the "having a cleaner car"<br>  <br>  2. Being able to take a nap when I need it<br>  <br>  3.

The fun part is guessing how long i'll be gone and what kind of bag to take (short errand, afternoon, all day, etc)|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	a nap on the weekends<br>  to never question what i just stepped in on the floor<br>  the bathroom one is ditto for me|`|by7H31Djaa	Hmmm i would say being able to eat anything without my 16 month old running up to me waiting for his turn AND my hubby changing his mind about wanting it too. If i ask him is he wants something he'll so no and then once i have it he'll want some or a few too! Lol I can't think of anything else but im sure there's more though. My son hasn't started talking yet so i don't have the problem of him pointing embarrassing things out.<br>  <br>  EDIT: I got another one! Being able to get up and walk somewhere withou worrying about my son following me whining because he just remembered, after playing quietly, that he wants to be clingy. Lmao. Here a question i just asked that's how i thought to come back and add it. <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090308102400AA9LiC7">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a><br>  <br>  EDIT AGAIN: Oh ya how could i forget!!??

GxlkhRfoaa	Yes.   It can take some women's body 6 months to a year to get back on track after being on the pill.  Just be patient and don't stress.|`|AIskV0efaa	seems like your body is just trying to reajust itself back off the pill... good luck|`|VHJ6Jp5qaa	I am not sure i am with you i have been trying to conceive for almost 1 year now and never had trouble before
jzAfst8Taa	dont give up hope .and quit stressing about it..it will happen you just have to be patient..good luck an lots of baby dust|`|AIskV0efaa	yes, i think you are over stressing and when you over stress your body sends that to your brain as a bad sign. it tells your body your not ready yet. clam down relax and let it happen
pXSKSS3daa	At 7 months the normal range of formula intake is between 24 and 32 oz. Your daughter may be taking in a little more or a little less as this is average. However, if she's taking in less than 20 oz. then you'll want to try and increase that somehow.<br>  <br>  As far as starting Stage 2 there really is not a difference between that and Stage 1 aside from the size(and a bigger selection of flavors). So if your daughter still seems hungry after formula and a jar of Stage 1 then you can certainly try to move up to Stage 2. At that age my son had started self feeding, so you may want to try that as well.|`|skXP6ISPaa	everybody does things differently. i would say your baby could drink an 8 oz. bottle every 4 hours. and as far as food goes, try a  cereal and formula mix for breakfast, or you could do a fruit, a vegetable for lunch. some people like to start infants on meats for dinner,  but you don't have to, they smell awful. so maybe another fruit, it just depends on how hungry your baby is. but as always talk to your doctor about any changes in her diet and make sure she is getting enough nutrients from her formula. i hope i helped.|`|uNvF299Caa	Start giving her 6oz. If she cries, give her another 2 oz.  That's my advice. And I found some information on www.babycenter.com<br>  <br>  <br>  BABYCENTER.COM<br>  "Multiply your baby's weight times 2.5 ounces<br>  If your baby isn't eating any solids (if he's younger than 4 to 6 months, he shouldn't be), the rule of thumb is to offer him 2.5 ounces of formula per pound of body weight each day.<br>  <br>  So if your baby weighs 6 pounds, you'll give him about 15 ounces of formula in a 24-hour period. If he weighs 10 pounds, he should drink about 25 ounces in a 24-hour period."<br>  <br>  <br>  Consider your baby's age<br>  How much formula your baby needs depends not only on his weight but also on his age. Let his hunger guide you. As a general guideline:<br>  <br>  Most new babies want to eat every two to three hours. (Start with 1 or 2 ounces at each feeding for the first week, then work up to 2 to 4 ounces.) As your baby gets older — and his tummy gets bigger — he'll drink fewer bottles a day with more formula in each.<br>  <br>  In a couple of months, for example, he may be down to six to eight bottles of 4 to 6 ounces each every 24 hours. By 4 months, he'll probably drop to four or five bottles of 6 or 7 ounces each, and by his half birthday he'll typically be down to three or four bottles of 7 to 8 ounces each every day.<br>  <br>  He'll likely remain at that three- to four-bottle pace until his first birthday, when he can transition to whole cow's milk in a bottle or sippy cup, along with three solid meals and snacks.<br>  <br>  Although cow's milk is good for your child once he's the right age, don't overdo it. Drinking more than 16 to 24 ounces a day can reduce his appetite for other healthy foods and lead to iron-deficiency anemia.<br>  <br>  Signs that your baby's getting the right amount of formula<br>  Here are some signs that your baby's getting all the formula he needs:<br>  <br>  He seems relaxed and satisfied after a feeding.<br>  He has five to six wet diapers a day if you're using disposable diapers, or six to eight if you're using cloth diapers. (Disposables hold more liquid.)<br>  He continues to gain weight after his first two weeks. (Most babies lose between 5 and 9 percent of their birth weight and then regain it by the time they're about 2 weeks old.)<br>  It's possible to give your baby too much formula, and he'll let you know this, too. If after a feeding he vomits (spitting up is normal, vomiting isn't — see how to tell the difference), you may have overfed him.<br>  <br>  Another sign of overfeeding is if he seems to have tummy pain — he might draw his legs up and his tummy may be tense.<br>  <br>  If you're worried that your baby isn't eating enough or is eating too much, take a look at his weight gain and talk with his doctor. She can tell you whether your baby's intake is appropriate for his size and age, and she can advise you about any adjustments you may need to make.<br>  <br>  <br>  If your 6 month - 8 month old baby is just starting solids at this stage, start out slowly, preparing a tablespoon sized portion of whatever food you have chosen to begin with. Nurse or bottle feed first and then offer your little one solids! Milk is more important at this age.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Some parents begin offering their babies solid foods by using their (clean and washed) finger as a spoon! They say that this helps their babies take to solid foods because the "new" spoon and the "new" food all at once seem to confuse baby!<br>  <br>  Introducing solids<br>  More and more parents are opting to skip traditional baby food purees and choose Baby Led Weaning as a method for introducing solid foods. Baby Led Weaning means offering your baby (age appropriate) foods that soft-cooked and cut into small easily manageable pieces. These foods are then given to your baby to eat.  You do the cooking, the dicing and the offering of the foods and your baby does the rest. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.wholesomebabyfood.com/solidfood6to8montholdbaby.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.wholesomebabyfood.com/solidfo...</a><br>  There is a chart on this website on how much and what you can give!|`|n6XYYyoLaa	if she's doing fine with the jarred food i would say that the single ingredient stage 2s are fine bc they are the same except in a larger  portion that makes them more cost efficient, esp when you figure in that baby will need to eat it for about four days before moving on bc of allergic purposes.....you might put in a call to your doc for specific advice to your child, but mine was taking about thirty oz formula and two meals a day.....<br>  i wouldn't start her on any stage twos that she hasn't had all of but one ingredient max in case of an allergy, you will be able to look at the label and tell which food she hasn't had before....gl, hth
ca9dEvSAaa	Yeah, I started wearing pads because of the discharge about 3-4 weeks ago. As your pregnancy carries on you may even get leaky urine. (I did as well) IT SUCKS!|`|bbe253b8bd16b56edbb017e1a281d44eaa	A large amount of discharge can be normal for some pregnant women. Make sure its not foul smelling or a strange color...if so go to see your obgyn and explain to them you think you might have an infection that could harm your baby. If its just regular discharge try wearing a pantyliner to ease the amount of discomfort.Good luck~|`|9WKVmOs1aa	ugh i hate discharge too.<br>  and im not pregnant.<br>  its a constant thing, almost like a colorless period.<br>  sucks.<br>  it is ESP. normal fer u to be having issues with it as u are prego.<br>  its fine.<br>  maybe wear a pantiliner fer now.|`|RhHv5pYwaa	I'm 32 weeks and me and the bathroom have found another grow relationship because I send so much time in there.

It grosses me out. I've been having this lime/light green discharge. My doctor said it was normal and my pap came back normal. So yeah. I don't know. It sucks a lot though. It feels like I wet myself. I'm also 18 weeks. Maybe it has something to do with how many weeks you are? I don't know. All I know is, I want stop feeling like I'm "leaking".|`|m2aznd8xaa	yes its normal. your constantly bein cleansed so baby doesnt get infections also the hormones produce more mucus . wear pantie liners for when you cant get to a rest room right away.|`|dg6wd8ufaa	Yes I have alot, I mean A LOT of discharge also.

rTACLd3Saa	First of all I am so sorry for your loss.  I can't imagine what you all must be going through.  I wish you and your family all the strength to get through this difficult time.<br>  <br>  As for your question, my first thought was Tears in Heaven by Eric Clapton.  He actually wrote that song when his son fell out of an upstairs window and passed away.

YZEHQW15aa	I went through the same thing when I was pregnant.  Your skin gets drys out easier, plus it is more sensitive during pregnancy.  Also, you probably have a little water retention which would explain the calves and ankles being especially troublesome.  If you are retaining water your legs get a tingle sensation and if the swelling from the water retention goes up and down the streatching and contracting of the skin in those areas can cause a build of dead skin cells.  So use a good exfoliator and lotion daily!|`|IlSALGKMaa	Stay hydrated and lotion up.  Use head and shoulders if your head itches, that should help that.<br>  <br>  Also, I use lotion and my skin is SO dry EVERY WHERE. You can actually see the skin flaking off my breasts, because they're so dry. It's gross. lol I've been itchy since about 13 weeks and I'm 20 weeks now. I especially hate when my clothes touch my skin when I lay down... It makes it itch worse. Winter doesn't help either. Well, good luck and congrats.|`|04kOtcGgaa	i've had itchy legs since i got pregnant and i found that if i put cocoa butter on my legs with out drying them after i take a shower it get rid of the itch for a while. it's dry skin caused by the pregnancy.|`|bb7b4M9Xaa	Itching is normal in pregnancy but the dots you are talking about don't sound normal, get them checked out! :)|`|ZfMYPiNfaa	Don't worry, it's normal.
PtSeJXnEaa	no you should be ok.|`|M798dyZYaa	Yes. I got pregnant with my baby boy a similar way on Yaz. Except I was only one day off on my pills....<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|IjOEpqgOaa	Well, yes you can get pregnant from Precum. <br>  <br>  So it might be a slight chance-- But if you been on your birth control for a long time now. I wouldn't sweat it.  I think you're okay!<br>  <br>  <br>  Him urinating before sex doesn't change nothing either, for whoever told you that?<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|98yuFeekaa	you should get Plan as fast as you could<br>  there is know chance to take with pecum because you never knows|`|rFHTPpVNaa	You should be fine,but always use precaution.
w4njrW9Vaa	You should really try to  talk to him and find out exactly WHY he doesnt want to have another baby. Communicatioon is really important i think.  But these other woman are soooo right,  you need to make a choice that is best for you.  It isnt all up to him.  I had a friend in you situation and she chose to have her baby and her husband came around.  He changed how he felt once that baby was there for him to hold and see.  So maybe he is just feeling overwhelmed.  Try to talk and then weigh your options i guess.  Good luck.|`|RhHv5pYwaa	If you want to have more then one child then 20 months is a nice gap time frame. You have to do what's right for your family. But when you two lay down together you know what could come from it. So there should not be any reason why you shouldn't care for your unborn. Have your child|`|UwwNpgntaa	uhhh well your partner is duuumb. if he didnt want another kid then why the heck did he get you pregnant?? hes an ***|`|m2aznd8xaa	the decision isnt only his its your too. how do you feel about having another baby, there are options but the decision must be yours as well .|`|vWb8fquvaa	It's not your partners choice. <br>  <br>  No one can make this decision for you. Do what you feel is right|`|AA11831450	Help your partner pack, it shouldn't hurt the baby as long as you don't lift anything heavy. Don't be confused and scared. He should have married you with the first one, what is wrong with him?! You will be fine and so will your children. If the man is really a good man, he will marry you and love you and all the babies you make together. If he only wants the sex - kick his butt out! <br>  Congratulations - Count your blessings (2 that I know of)|`|gCfQY1L9aa	this sounds like my sister she is 17 and has a 4 month old and tonight just found out shes pregnant again. the father is an asshole. <br>  i think my sis is really leanin toward keeping this baby, ok well good luck with your decision. and no 1 can tell u wat 2 do its ur choice|`|ZzxxcFfsaa	first of all think about your options. you could have the baby and give it to a home. but you should really consider talking with your partner very carefully.|`|yKS2UI87aa	Wow, he sounds like a jerk (sorry) Picture if he had said that about your son, could you really kill him?? If you both decide you can't raise one more, than adoption is best.
IjOEpqgOaa	Oh its normal.<br>  <br>  My friend had her baby like 3wks ago. & I was jealous. I wanna have mine now! .. LOL!<br>  <br>  Plus 2 of my really good friends.. We all have the same due date.<br>  So we're all gonna see who pops first. & IT BETTER BE ME! Lol. but we all talked about how we would be jealous & what not.<br>  <br>  Its normal. Don't worry! I hate it. <br>  I'm 38wks. & i'm jealous of you cause your 39! LOL<br>  <br>  Congrats! You don't have too much longer babe!|`|Oq2B7I4faa	No,  I think it's normal.  It's just that you are at end of your pregnancy waiting for your newborn and others already have their baby.  I am same as you, I am 38 weeks right now and my sister in law was due one week after me and she already had her child couple days ago and I was little jealous  but than I realize that I am almost there too.|`|y5sWmbtnaa	Well I haven't felt that way but since i am on 35.5 weeks pregnant now I suppose I may get to that point. Just think about it this way. You may not have him or her yet but you have time to your self to relax still and she does not... :)|`|gXIA9yHJaa	that's a really good question. I hope you get the answer you were looking for.|`|ZDMUW1YRaa	It's perfectly normal, you are simply excited and you also need to chock it up to the fact that are 39 wks and 1 day YOU ARE DONE...want that baby out and  are very uncomfortable.  It's normal to feel jealous that she doesn't have to be 9 months pregnant, and it's normal to feel envy that your baby isn't hear yet.  Your hormones do control you now so don't put too much into it. Good luck mamma and congrats.|`|3YxowxIPaa	Well my son will be 2 months so here is more to add to your hormonal jealousy. Lol well o felt the same and up until I had to be induced at 37 weeks 6 days.  And now since I'm breastfeeding I am jealous of the bellies now.. Lol I had a pregnancy with no complaints really so I loved every moment of my belly and I even enjoyed labor and deliver even tho my epidural didn't work after 2 trys|`|UAXHmqgRaa	I know exactly what you talking about!!! I always felt the same way when I had my three babies. I also felt jealous when my sister in law had her babies, and complained about the little things that she didn't like and here I had two babies who were a horriable preg. and very complicated and they were both in the nicu. but ya i did feel the same way!|`|hPkSWRAkaa	I think it is normal..I was so jealous! But I also smiled every time I saw a new baby...thinking about how soon it would be that mine would be here! I think its more like anxious than jealous...|`|AZSIoSNoaa	I kinda do the same thing, but I don't think I am crazy for it. Just wishing my baby was already here. Good Luck, and God Bless|`|bb7b4M9Xaa	so normal!|`|aLAmvX5Naa	I promise you they are actually more jealous of you. You may wake up every 30 min to pee at night but at least your bladder only takes one minute to calm and you can go back to sleep. <br>  <br>  Focus on sleeping and relaxing, your baby will be here soon enough and then you can join the sleep-deprived group for a few months.|`|PLbmKNpvaa	I think it's pretty normal. I have two friends who have had their babies in the last 2 weeks, and I still have another 6 weeks to go. I get a little jealous, but I think it's because I am scared of the pain involved. They've already been through it and are done with that part, I'm still sitting around waiting for bubs to make an arrival!<br>  On top of that I just want to be able to hold him already. The waiting is killing me! Lol.
IFDfpbFJaa	My day care doesn't have a pin code or limited access...but we do have to sign my son out. I wish it were darker cause my kid doesn't get a nap at school because it's too bright. If you don't feel right then try going back and taking another look and then making your final decision. If it doesn't feel right then it doesn't feel right . Trust your instinct .|`|n6XYYyoLaa	if you didn't feel right, there's a reason, so i would keep looking...also, maybe make a list of things you want to see in a daycare, and take that along when u r scouting them...i would also suggest, once u find one that you like, that u drop in at diff times of day a few times unexpected and just see what is going on....gl, hth|`|pXSKSS3daa	Naptime-Normal. You can't MAKE kids sleep but you can "set the tone" for those that want to.<br>  <br>  Security-NOT normal. At the very least she should have had a sign in/out sheet. What happens if someone other than your husband or yourself pick your child up without you knowing? She won't know who it was. I worked at a daycare in NC and they didn't have a buzzer at the door but the director was always in the front office to where she could see who came in the front door(even after that there was another door leading to the rooms).<br>  <br>  If you didn't feel comfortable keep searching! I'm sure there is one out there that meets all your specific(and realistic) expectations. And good for you for checking them out beforehand.|`|ejQ3yg9Naa	The nap time thing is normal. But I would have a HUGE problem with the security. At the day care I worked for we had a code to get in the door, then you had to put in your child's code or your employment Id to get through the other door to where the class rooms were.|`|VmSKQ40Caa	If you don't like it, do not sign your child up for it.|`|uVbTJw9daa	Code-no there might be some high end places that have that, but for the most part no. A daycare should have a sign in and out sheet, that must be signed by the person when they are dropping off and picking up the child. If a person tries to pick up a child that is not on the approved list they CANNOT be allowed to take the child, no daycare would do this, they would be shut down. Parents will sometimes have a different person then usual pick up the child. In that case the parent need to inform the caregivers of the persons first and last name. Upon arrival the person needs to show ID or they will not be allowed to take the child, even if the child knows who they are. A parent or a person that reguarly picks up the child(such as  a grandparent) will not be ID every time they walk in the door. If Aunt Jane is on the list of approved people, but has never picked up the child then she to will be ID. There is always a specific nap period for the children in most daycares. The one I work at all children 18 months and up go to nap at the same time, and yes we make it dark. Though there is some leeway with the children under 2 since they are in a separate part of the building, if needed they can go to nap earlier, though this is a case by case basis. For the most part its a a set time. For the babies, we try to stick to a schedule that they work best with, if they need a nap they get one. Lights are off, its easier to sleep that way, would you want to sleep with all the lights on?<br>  Make sure any daycare you use is licensed by the state. They should have the license hanging somewere you can easily see it. Talk to the staff and if possible the other parents. The place should be clean and safe, take a good look around. Watch the inner action of the children with the staff and other children. There should be a good child to staff ratio-find out what it is in your state. If you do send your child there, don't be afraid to pop up at random times to pick her up. You child should be clean(not squaky clean since kids do get dirty) she should not be filthy by any means. You know your child best, if she is happy she will show it, if she is truly misrable she will show that to.<br>  In the end if you get a funny vibe and don't like it, don't send your child there.<br>  By the way not all of us childcare workers are evil, there are people who make us sound like a bunch of child abusers. In a large center with multiple staff that is far less likely to happen. There is no way all the caregivers would harm a child, with all the staff around the chances are far less. I would in no way allow that to go on, nor would most caregivers.Now a single person at home with a child, no witnessess. Anything could happen. I love kids and I love what I do, people don't do this job for the pay|`|rTACLd3Saa	I have a difficult time leaving my daughter with ANYONE, even my mom or sis... there is no way I would leave her in a place like that!  You are right to be concerned.  I'm fortunate enough to be a SAHM so I haven't had to deal with the daycare issue so I can't comment on what it should or should not be like.  But I definitely would not leave my daughter in a place like that.  Check out some other facilities in your area.  Mommy intuition is there for a reason and it's usually dead on.  Good luck!|`|uNvF299Caa	I know how you feel. I am not ready to leave at a daycare either. We found this amazing lady, who has a son about the same age and she does so much activity with them, I wish I could hang out with them.  She lets him sleep when he wants, she is so cool. Her son is also very nice and it's cheaper then day care.<br>  <br>  If you don't feel comfortable, don't leave your baby there. <br>  Ask your friends if they know someone who wants to baby sit your kid, look at the classifieds (but be careful).|`|yKS2UI87aa	If you are not happy and concerned keep looking. Double check with your state's licensed day care providers they will often have a report on any citations etc. Very eye opening for me as not everything can be seen on one visit.|`|7vgTHpKwaa	Than it shouldn't be a question someone taking care of your child is very important and a decision that shouldn't be taken lightly speak with your husband and maybe he will reconsider if you voice your concerns|`|PgzZNnLRaa	I personally would not be comfortable with a place like that.  Trust your instinct and keep looking.|`|U1wAKo1Gaa	trust your motherly instincts...find another sweetie|`|BWQzRrBfaa	Naptime is normal.  At our center, infants are on their own schedule, but toddlers and up have a set nap time.  Kids get very used to their schedule, and parents tell us that even on weekends the kids want to nap at the normal nap time.<br>  <br>  Security- I wouldn't be to worried about the doors not being locked, but I would make sure that there was some time of alarm on the doors.  For example, our doors do not stay locked, but every time any door leading outside opens there is a "Beep, Beep" heard through the center.  This way, all the staff can monitor if anybody comes in, or if any child trys to go out.<br>  <br>  Sign in- At our center, parents do not have to sign anything.  But, the staff records what time the child arrived and left.  Every child has an emergency card.  If someone new comes to pick up the child, they must show their ID.  If they are not on the card, the parents are called to make sure that it is okay for the child to leave.  Or, the parent may call and say, "Jimmy's Aunt Sally will be picking him up today.  Her name is Sally Jones."  We would thing make a note for the teacher that Sally Jones is allowed to pick up Jimmy.|`|C1spuRsZaa	I have worked in 4 day cares in both rich and poor neighborhoods...in my experience ALL day cares are horrible. They don't give NEAR enough individualized attention and sometimes are so mean to the kids.<br>  <br>  If at ALL possible, leave your child with a close friend or family member...even a baby-sitter! There is more attention and love to give that way.<br>  <br>  Because of my experiences in day cares I have VOWED on my life that when I have kids, even if it puts me in the poor house, I will NEVER put my kids in any type of day care. Not until they are at least 5 years old and can speak for themslves about their day and how they feel about the place. A LOT of day care workers lie or exaggerate the truth on how "GREAT!!!" the child's day was....
kiAQi91laa	The Assessment is an observation of parent and child engaging in  activities together in such a way that significant aspects of the parent-child relationship.  So how you handle situations such as soothing your baby when they cry, ensure health and safety for child, frequent diaper changes, and bonding/playtime will be evaluated.  The assessment is to ensure that situations such as child neglect, child abuse or destructive child behavior can be prevented.
XwjL8PZCaa	books, puzzles,  flash cards, just constant interaction really, talk to him non stop about everything! every time I go somewhere with my son we point out things we see and count them and things like that.  he knew all his colors by 2 including silver and gold I would always say things like look at the red stop sign, or the blue truck stuff like that, he also knew all of his shapes by 2.|`|SHfl8KOWaa	The best thing you can ever do for your babies is crank the stereo up pick them up and sing and dance with them.They will cherish the love and take in everything.|`|5ItOGyVHaa	flash cards. even the simple ones at the dollar store. point everything out to him in his day. the grocery store is a great place to learn. also reading. lots of reading.|`|DXZK6eMNaa	read to him<br>  sing to him<br>  interact with him|`|6AvVVzsnaa	I play with my baby and I also read to her.

HztriBPAaa	As long as you are getting all the protein and other nutrients you need through other foods like soy products it is perfectly ok not to eat meat. I would suggest talking with your ob to see if they can suggest a nutrition plan for you to follow if not set up an appointment with a registered nutritionist. Good look and Congrats!|`|apALY0sqaa	Honestly, if you have been a vegetarian for a while- you could do more harm than good by altering your diet. Introducing foods the body isn't used to or has no tolerance for can make you sick- and possibly the baby depending on how it affects you.<br>  <br>  Continue to eat as you do, bump up the beans and lentils for the extra protein, and see your dr as soon as you can. if it bothers you that much, your dr can direct you to a dietician (sp? sorry!) who can help you balance your diet so that you won't have to eat meat for the protein. I would suggest a good prenatal vitamin as well. <br>  <br>  And don't listen to your friend- especially if they a) haven't been pregnant b) aren't a vegetarian or c) aren't a doctor. No offense, but there are certain people who give bad advice, or just don't know what they are talking about- your friend sounds like one of those.<br>  <br>  Good Luck and enjoy your baby!!!!|`|FZPomFRKaa	yes i read it was safe to be a vegetarian while pregnant you may have to watch your diet a little more.and make sure you are eating a little healthier.you may also have to take an extra vitamin,but i know for sure you have to make sure you take your prenatals.|`|m2aznd8xaa	no you can keep eating what you eat your surviving aint you. just be sure to take your prenatals and visit dr gerularly. congrats|`|hF2TsZFwaa	You can be a vegetarian while you are pregnant, you just have to make sure you get all the nutrients that you and the baby are going to need to stay healthy. You may even want to take the prenatal vitamins. I have three, i am not a vegetarian, but i did not take the vitamins. They are just extra vitamins that help with the vitamins that your baby will absorb through you.|`|uGinKU6Baa	You can eat just as healthy as a non-vegan while pregnant..take your prenatals...drink lots of fruit juice and veggie juices and raw veggies..<br>  <br>  here are some recipes to help:<br>  <a href="http://www.babycenter.ca/pregnancy/nutrition/eatingwell/pregnantandvegetarian/" rel="nofollow">http://www.babycenter.ca/pregnancy/nutri...</a>|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Why would you have to eat meat? Vegetarians have very healthy diets so don't change anything. Make sure you are getting enough protein, but I"m sure you do that already. Do not eat meat if you are against it. That is not necessary.|`|24a78cc0007d10093367ee4cc375a0f6aa	It is possible to remain vegetarian while pregnant but it is not easy.  Many vegetarians (especially vegans) do not get enough protein and calcium and it becomes especially difficult while pregnant because the mother's protein and calcium needs are increased.  I'd suggest talking to your doctor about it, educate yourself on the topic and speak to a nutritionist.  This is not something you should take lightly.
PxawVQ7Xaa	If it's genuinely in the child's best interest, such as "don't touch the oven" then it is going to help the child, but people who say "Because I said so" or "I pay for the house" don't care about the child's best interest but only care about their own ego and need another outlet for their anger.|`|8j7FCEOraa	lol Because your the kid and they'ree the adult<br>  <br>  They have alot more years of experience and wisdom then you do. <br>  <br>  That's how its always been. Elders teach. Toddlers dont tell a society how to run.<br>  <br>  They CAN because it's LOGICAL. It would be ILLOGICAL for a child, to write the laws that society needs to run. It would be chaos. Secondly, children dont know the consequences of their actions like and Adult does.|`|m25lpepOaa	Parents tell children what to do because they have more life experience.|`|VS78dqO9aa	beacuse we are here to help you learn...

pXSKSS3daa	Lol, no, you're not a bad mommy.<br>  <br>  As much as I want Noah to start walking I also DON'T. Not for the reasons you stated but simply because I won't really view him as my little baby but as my little boy. I guarantee you I will sob the day he walks.<br>  <br>  I think letting nature run its course is the best way to go about it anyway. You're not pushing them and they are left to explore and figure things out for themselves. Noah has a push toy but he hardly uses it, which is probably more MY fault than his. I have tried walking with him while he's holding my hands but for now he's content with crawling.|`|HFWLYMD6aa	I don't think your a bad mum at all. But maybe you should see a doctor or physio about your back pain to get some management strategies and relief.|`|6fiYhtACaa	No, it does not. And she doesn't need to be around children her own age - they have nothing to offer each other developmentally. She is hitting her milestones so early because she is being socialized by adults and hasn't been dumped in some same-age ghetto of a daycare. No offense to working moms who have no choice but to bring their kids to daycare, but it drives me nuts when I hear mothers talking about socializing their little babies with other babies. It's ridiculous! I'm sure you are doing a wonderful job with her as evidenced by her growth and developmental prowess. Good job and try not to beat yourself up.|`|AA11142587	I dont think its bad for you not to show her, she will do it herself eventually anyways. But I think your reasoning is a bit strange??? You wont have to chase her, this is what a stroller is for. If you dont let her out of it in a store she will never fight to get out. Once you start letting her run in the stores then she will know what she wants. Get it? This is the lesson you should worry about teaching her, not the walking.|`|kRui5wGtaa	I definitely do not think that you are a bad mother for that! It IS something that she will develop naturally, on her own. I have even heard/read before that no matter how you go about it (using walkers, jumperoos, etc.) they are going to learn at their own pace and when they are ready regardless. I think that it is just a lot of mothers (and other family members) instincts to try to 'teach' them how to walk. You have your reasons and that is just that, YOUR reasons. Like you said, you aren't holding her down so that she CANNOT learn naturally.|`|8lcNupM2aa	No!! but you shouldn't do it for the reason that you can't bend down to be at her level.  I'll tell you right now that it will be any time now. Since you gave her the pushy thing she's going to take off on her own one day soon.<br>  <br>  My son got one a xmas (he was 9 months) and took off with it and it was only a few weeks later that he walked on his own.  He's 11 months now and he's walking really fast and I too have back problems, I have spinal stenosis and it is very hard to bend down w/ him.  I just let him do his own thing.  It's a bit harder outside but he's still leery about walking in his shoes on the concrete.<br>  <br>  You can't postpone the inevitable :)|`|n6XYYyoLaa	bad mommy?no<br>  strange reasoning? yes<br>  :0)
8C87ZfMwaa	All my labors have been different.  <br>  My first (37 weeks) started with menstrual cramps very regularly for about half an hour, followed by a bloody show and then a couple of very painful contractions and then a baby...very quickly.<br>  My second (36 weeks) i felt no cramps but got up to go to the toilet and thought i'd wet myself but my membranes had ruptured.  Started contracting about an hour later, not painful and then a couple of painful contractions and...baby<br>  My third (36 weeks) i was induced and i got slight cramps until they got very painful again and then baby!!<br>  I am due my fourth in May so we'll see what that brings....|`|bxH8zngPaa	Even though you were induced, it's the same feelings.  Labor can be different for everyone!  It may start with just your water breaking or it may start with severe contractions.  Since this is your 3rd child, labor shouldn't last that long.  Your labor is shortened with each child because your cervix has been opened before.  You will definitely know when you're in labor and yes the baby does still move but not a lot.  The reason for this is because the head is down.  Good luck!|`|q84KT11saa	I went through the same thing as you, only I have two kids.  My son was cake cause I was induced/epidural.  Didn't go through any real pain aside from the time between them breaking my water and getting the epidural (10mins).  My daughter I did the whole cramping, hardening stomach, sharp pain business.  Approx. 2 weeks before I actually had her.  The epidural didn't work, they still had to break my water, but I went naturally other then that.  It HURT A LOT! lol  Don't worry though, what your experiencing sounds completely normal.|`|3oSQQt6maa	My first pregnancy labor began in the morning, not bad but i felt a sharp back pain, and felt slight cramps through out the day. Then at midnight they got very strong. From the pain i didn't really feel the baby but he was moving i concentrated more on the pain.<br>  My second pregnany labor began all the sudden.<br>  I had no epidural or anything so i felt it all.........lol|`|Gabr19m7aa	if you aren't sure ask you doctor personally when i was pregnant with my first daughter i had little pains in my back and almost a soreness around the womb and i called my doctor concerned (as a first time mother would be) and he said that i wasn't ready to come to the hospital and said that i should try sex-induced labor and i did and almost an hour after sex i had extreme contractions and my husband brought me to the hospital as for my second pregnancy i was in the hospital on bed rest because i was pregnant with sextuplets so i had a c-section and i had one contraction before they brought me to the OR|`|y5sWmbtnaa	My labor was induced. first they inserted laminaria which are small tube like sticks of seaweed. They put them into my cerix (12 of them to be exact) and sent me home. The seaweed absorbed fluids and spread my cervix apart to 4 cm. The next day i got pitocin. <br>  Yes it felt like cramps but that is an understatement. They were the absolute most horrid cramps ever!!!!!!!!|`|yKS2UI87aa	My water starting breaking at 10 am not a big gush, just felt like I couldn't hold me pee. Went to friend's baby shower at 1 pm still no cramping/contractions, starting contracting at 6 pm called the on-call Dr. (of course it wasn't my regular Dr) told him contractions were every 7 min. but b/c I hadn't "gushed" he thought probably not. I even told him how far along I was & days past due. Oh well men whether they are a Dr. or not are still ignorant in some areas. lol. I don't remember if he was moving alot as he was my only and I was too busy timing contractions and freaking out. :o)

pzLDXL6gaa	It's not. People keep saying it's getting more and more common but actually rates have dropped significantly since the 1990s, save for a small spike in 2006. Check it out: <a href="http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0193727.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0193727.h...</a><br>  Other sites support this data.<br>  <br>  Of course, a long time ago we didn't have data, but do you really htink there were fewer teenage pregnancies in the late 1800s or early 1900s? Puberty was a bit later, but with no effective birth control, girls were getting pregnant extremely early. The difference was either they were married or they were very poor and nobody cared and they likely died.<br>  <br>  It happens because teenagers have hormones and urges and often can't use birth control. I don't think "abstinence only education" helps either.<br>  <br>  Harret|`|M798dyZYaa	As a teen mother, I have to wonder why you think you're any different. Suppose you're 16, if you aren't already. And you fall in love. You're on BC, you use condoms, you think it'll never happen to me. And guess what. It does. It can happen, no matter what color you are, if its your first time, how long it was, it doesn't matter. I got pregnant on BC and using condoms. Was it a mistake to have my baby girl? Not at all. I wouldn't have traded that for the world.|`|1487d1674981b6aea0adec310c43a272aa	Because we have lost our moral fiber to be responsible for our actions.  If a girl gets pregnant there are no consequence for it just rewards.  Free food, free place to live, free medical care, free college, free daycare, free car, i could keep going and going.<br>  <br>  She is not shunned for being a whore any more.  There is no scarlet A for her to wear.  Now she is paraded around.  <br>  <br>  Men just do the act and run.  Men do not stand up and take responsibility for the kids they have.  They just go on with their lives and make lots of babies they don't take care of.  <br>  <br>  Marriage is religious but it is also the responsibility of couples.  They will commit to this person to make a life for each other.  No matter how bad it may get that person is there to help you stand and get through it.  We don't have that responsibility anymore.  <br>  <br>  Our society gets rewards for irresponsibility.

Don't stress and if you can stop thinking about having a baby. It happens when you least expect it. I promise. I did the same thing only a year ago and when nothing happen we said forget it let's get extra jobs or look to going back to school. And we started enjoying love making instead of focusing so much that this was the right time. Only 3 weeks after stop thinking about having a baby. Joking around with my friend who thought she might be prego. Took a test now I'm 32 weeks. It will happen when it's meet. I know you spent a lot on that Monitor
veO1RXrCaa	Your life sucked so did my husbands.  He was basically homeless at 15, his Dad hated him, his Mom left at 6 or 7 and tried to kidnap him before she left.  He had it rough.  He is now one of the most kindest gentlest sometimes the most indulgent Dad ever.  He loves our son and can't wait for our new baby to be born.  Bad child hood does not equal crappy parenting or parents.  You need to do better then you got and that's that.  You don't want kids and others do so what's the issue?  I could not imagine my life without my son.  I don't want to imagine a life without the new one in my belly.|`|PfE6bg5iaa	It's really great that you found someone that you love and agrees with you on not wanting kids. It's also very sad that you had such a bad childhood and fear that you would pass on your illnesses to potential children. That's a tough call to make, and I don't have any problem with the lifestyle you've chosen. <br>  <br>  However, to answer your question -- people have kids because if they didn't, none of us would be here!<br>  <br>  No, I did not have a good childhood -- I was stuck taking care of my 4 younger brothers and sisters while my stepdad sat around infront of the TV all day and my mom worked fulltime at a deadend job. My stepdad was also abusive. So I do have the parenting skills, but I also hated being a kid, moved out and went away to college after graduating high school, and never moved back in.<br>  <br>  Children are still being born and put in foster care because people are immature and irresponsible. The media encourages young people to have sex and parents allow them too much freedom and alone time with their boyfriend or girlfriend. And then we don't develop the communication with our kids so they feel comfortable enough with us to ask for birth control. I'm not someone who believes that everyone should wait for marriage (hell I didn't), but there are far too many people out there that don't think of sex as something important, highly intimate, and to only be shared with someone you intend spending an indefinite amount of time with. <br>  <br>  But there are also many people out there (including myself, but only recently) who consider raising children to be joyful and rewarding.|`|01Mu3wUeaa	Is this question serious...or are you just another troll?|`|ejQ3yg9Naa	I wanted to have kids because I wanted to be a mother. I wanted to have OUR baby, feel it grow inside me, and then raise it together. I consider every second of every day all the things that could happen and go wrong, I worry more than I ever thought possible. But that's part of being a mother. It is by far the BEST decision I have ever made already. I would never ever take it back and I can't imagine anything better. <br>  <br>  And yes I had an amazing childhood with the very best parents, I hope I'm half the mother my own is.|`|dlTdrokfaa	Not everyone wants children, and those who do see the good in bringing another person into the world.  Those who do not want children usually see the bad in bringing another person into the world.  I have a child, I am happy.  Time, money and dedication yeah so what.  There is no feeling like being a parent.  It's amazing.  If you don't like it, don't squash it.  You have no clue what its like.|`|HFWLYMD6aa	I love children, i am a child care worker and will have my own in a few years time if finances are good. Most adults who have children know what it will require of them physically and mentally to raise their children.|`|GwWDnvB8aa	You are really asking two different questions: 1. why do people with stable lives who are ready want children; and 2. why do people who are unstable and not ready have children. <br>  <br>  People with unstable lives who are not ready to have children are a totally different issue. <br>  <br>  People with stable lives who are ready to parent do not have children who end up in foster care. It really doesn't matter if their children "have problems," as the parents are ready to take care of a child with problems. They are ready to devote the time and money to raising a child to adulthood. They don't need to imagine life without children, because that was their life until they chose to have or adopt children--and they found that life with children was what they wanted. <br>  <br>  Not all people who are successful at raising children have had good childhoods. But, they read books and magazines about parenting, they attend parenting classes, and they learn how to be a good parent. Sometimes, they make even better parents than those who had easy childhoods, because the work harder at it.|`|mbfMYmzWaa	It's just a natural instinct that alot of people are born with. It's an animal trait, and we're animals really. <br>  <br>  The only thing is- we've learned to live very differently from "animal" animals... so we don't need alot of our instincts. Even though we don't NEED them though, doesn't mean they're just going to dissapear, and alot of people can't ignore them- even when it's the rational thing to do. (not mentioning any names, but using a certian angela jolie lookalike as an example)<br>  <br>  I agree, and even though I'm far too young for a kid now anyway, have always planned- and still intend to adopt or foster rather than 'have' a kid. <br>  <br>  There are too many children who were sadly born due to human instinct and action rather than thought and rationalisation.|`|3ioUdPuZaa	People ARE beginning to consider these things and to actually use a thought process when deciding to have children. But a lot just don't. WHY? Because they don't take getting pregnant seriously until after they already are...because they want something VERY PERSONAL to have as a symbol of the love they share...because some people ABSOLUTELY LOVE children and can't get enough of them! Children have a way of opening the heart with just a simple little smile, or comment...they give us something important to say 'we did' in this world (if its done well, that is) and they keep us forever young, from our children to our grandchildren...and even when we AREN'T young anymore. They remind us of what it is like to be carefree and trusting, with not a care in the world and by loving a child and doing it WELL, we create a better US!<br>  I am sure there are LOTS of other reasons. I am sorry that your childhood was not good. I would GIVE you that important thing, if I could. But you sound very bitter, glim and sad, EVEN NOW. Life isn't suppose to be that way for you. We ALL have crosses to bear sometimes in our lives, and it is in finding our way toward happiness again that we DEFEAT these bad things. I dont think you have let the bad go and found your happiness yet. If you still have such thoughts then the people who let you down as a child, STILL HAVE POWER OVER YOUR LIFE and are still keeping you from living it the way God would want you to. <br>  Your thought process is a real but analytical one...and having a child, or falling madly in love is NOT a technical process!<br>  The best things in life are those things unseen and that CANNOT be analyzed...like love, faith and hope. <br>  Children, the Bible says and I believe, are a gift from God. The Bible tells us to "be like the little children." <br>  I personally witnessed a young woman seemingly like you who adopted a child. I didn't say much and it wasn't really BAD, but she just treated him as if he was a "machine" or something. He had stringent rules and if they were not followed, he had punishment that was always given, no matter what. I thought they were HARD on him in an unnatural way. They SEEMED to go overboard on a lot of things, like taking vitamins and THINKING he was sick (when I didn't really think so.) Both she and her husband were GOOD PEOPLE and thought that what they were doing was a GOOD THING.<br>  But their "parenting" left scars on their son...and bitterness. WHY? Perhaps because their was a missing element in their parenting. They forgot to throw away the rule book and JUST LOVE HIM!<br>  Years later, MUCH to their surprise the woman, who thought she was unable to have a child, GOT PREGNANT. When I saw here with her "natural" child, things were OH SO DIFFERENT!<br>  The rules were thrown away and love was truly there. I think God gives us not only the child as a gift, but also some unseen "something" that allows us to LOVE to the UMPTEENTH degree when we have our own children. I guess the lesson needed with this woman I knew was one only she could see by having her own child. Sad for the other, though, VERY SAD. <br>  Perhaps adoptive parents or parents who DO NOT have their own children need some extra parenting tips and guidelines to follow. Kids are important and if they are, then those adopting OR HAVING children should be seeking sound lessons on how to be a really GOOD parent!<br>  If you are a believer in God and Jesus as his son, read the Lord's Prayer and really think about what it says. You must forgive whoever has created this bitterness that entraps your life, or you will NEVER be able to be happy...and God wants you to be happy. <br>  Blessings<br>  Bunny7|`|HJI6PlRraa	No offense but I think you need a little counseling in terms of your childhood, not to say I don;t...but you say imagine how many accidents you would be without, well if you live life with no risk, why wake up, why get married, do you know how many end in divorce, do you know how many accidents happen every day to people going about their lives as normal, <br>  and think about all of the hugs all of the kisses, the joy of seeing their 1st smile, loving someone completely unconditionally, the fact that they open your eyes to the world again, you see how wonderful it really is, and the little things are amazing amazing again, and how dancing like a goofball in public or spinning until your dizzy is still fun <br>  <br>  I'm not saying kids are for everyone, I don';t think it should be as expected as it is, but if you can;t see the greatness in it for someone else you probably need to deal with issues from your childhood.  I had an alcoholic dad, and was verbally and a little physically abused, but I also has great times too, and also I plan to raise my child how I believe is right, I'm sure I'll make my own mistakes but they will be mine, not those of my parents recycling through me<br>  hope that helps|`|iLLoc003aa	I understand your point, but I wanted to have children so that I could be the mother I wish I had, and the childhood I wish I had. Money is not everything but love and affection are. My parents were divorced when I was like 1 or 2 and then my mother was murdered when I was 4. I was sent to live with my dad and step-mom and my step-mom was very resentful and mean. She treated me like garbage and was mentally and physically abusive. So because I had a bad and traumatic childhood does not mean I should not have children. I have been married for 9yrs this July, I have a 4yr old son and a 2yr old daughter and before having children, my husband and I were fosterparents. I am also a full time college student majoring in Psychology and minoring in Sociology. Once I complete my degree I plan to get my Master's and to work with children that have gone through what I have...and to show them first hand that not all is hopeless and that if they work hard and stay strong they can get out of it and make a life for themeselves...they don't have to grow up to be criminals, murderers, drug addicts or prostitutes..or even child abusers. I love my children more than anything or anyone in this world and I would do anything for them without having to even think about it. I plan on foster parenting again now that my children are a little older because I want them to grow up to be kind and caring adults. I want them to not be selfish and to work hard for what they want.
MHOxPs8Oaa	Just because you have breastfed doesn't mean you have much knowledge or support about it. They most likely hire people you know more than have just breastfed and somebody who isn't 5 months pregnant.|`|da0bd1389f2c6ba2fe645d6d1c4be705aa	um then u should get it|`|VS78dqO9aa	well technically i believe it's against the law for them to discriminate because you are pregnant.  But...on the other hand, they don't have to technically tell you they aren't hiring you becuase you are pregnant.  They can simply say someone else was more qualified or something.  But I would always give it a shot.  They may be able to work with you on it, and have someone who can fill in while you are on maternity leave.  Go in and knock their socks off...|`|HFWLYMD6aa	Be very careful because you are already pregnant they may pick another candidate over you for that reason. They will just say they were better suited to the position. Good Luck tho.|`|vJ2i0BDPaa	yeah you should give it a shot anythings possible.|`|VuUz8NgKaa	It is worth a try. Good luck.

How about Tyson Andrew or Tyson Michael.  I know Andrew and Michael are very common, but I personally like them with the name Tyson.  I actually had a friend give her baby a letter for a middle name because they couldn't decide a full name and i also had a friend give no middle name so there are always options.|`|XAKpDBQmaa	andrew jordan<br>  <br>  i think that sounds the best =)|`|GomqF0bfaa	Lukas is honestly my favorite. I actually love the spelling of it and think it's very unique.

I was going to name my first son Jayden :) My, you have exceptional taste ;) <br>  <br>  But in all seriousness, I must say my preference of all those names is Andrew Carter.

It is a gorgeous name... I wish it were mine, girls can also be named Chris.|`|61d7b5ef4db9616809632d1d2fb864c5aa	Christopher is the best name by far. I prefer Christopher Jayden.<br>  <br>  Anything but Tyson. It's a surname, not a first name. It's also the last name of Mike Tyson. Is that who you want to name your son after?|`|VGa5d2q7aa	i love this : Christopher Jayden<br>  or sorry if this will confuse you more , but i've always loved the name Christian.

How about Madison Grace, Madison Jade, Madison Claire, Madison Leigh, Madison Juliett, Madison Reese, Madison Joy, Madison Skye, Madison Anne, or Madison Faith. <br>  <br>  I like Sophie, but the middle names -- not so much. I guess Sophia Marie. How about Sophia Nichelle, Sophiaa Nicole, Sophia Mae, Sophia Charlotte(or Charlotte Sophia), Sophia Brianne, or Sophia Grace.<br>  <br>  Isabella is nice, though I prefer the others. I like Isabella Marie, and Isabella Nanette is just okay.

YWli1TUAaa	SOMETHING LIKE THAT ..I WAS 16 WEEKS WITH MY SON AND THAT'S WHEN MY URINE SHOW THAT I WAS
U1wAKo1Gaa	Varies from child to child, usually anywhere from 6 months to 2 years old the childs true eye color emerges.|`|HFWLYMD6aa	By 2 years or age a child's eye colour will be it's permanent colour.|`|OTlw9FbGaa	it can change up until they are about 2 years ... usually the eye color os present at 6 months, but can change overnight .... weird huh?|`|5fac1a74bb7ebd91b46b6f46581be168aa	normally the colour of your childs eyes at 9mths is the colour that will stay|`|YtCAJb7Faa	my son is 4 months and have big blue eyes, hope they don't change hahahha
Le1mibkIaa	You ovulate 2 weeks after the LAST day of your period so you would be ovulating on the 10 ( you can buy ovulation test though its just like a pregnancy test I bought mine at wal-mart)... I would start having sex now because sperm can live up 2 72 hours .... I tried getting pregnant and it took me 3 years I also took clomid it took me almost a year after starting clomid ... I had alot of female problems I had endometreosis and cyst .... I weent through alot and so did my husband I had alot of blood work dye shot in my tubes and he had sperm test done ... <br>  <br>  You can also try raising your bottom when you have sex so the sperm goes upwards and stay in that position for like 15 min ! <br>  <br>  Hope that helps some , Mommy of a week old baby girl|`|V8JoRHnnaa	i would say have sexx every other day soo that u dont miss the perfect day. i took clomid once and it delayed my ovulaion and i BDed according to my own calculation without knowing clomid would prolong and missed the days. soo my suggestion is to BD every other day.<br>  Baby Dust honey
1oKardRKaa	yes and i love it!!!!!!!!!!!! take it to ur advantage if you like it like dat.|`|aCrILRS9aa	nope|`|7WRMpSVXaa	yes,17 years and six kids later its great|`|9WKVmOs1aa	huh?|`|GKM1DvdTaa	its usually a call for attention over the baby|`|eibseECNaa	still single but i just wanted to say i like your kids names they are cool :D|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Me, not my husband. :)|`|SCY0bOr5aa	No, though I have always wished! ;-)
nNYkC9Pgaa	That happened with all three of my babies, and my latch was checked out to be correct. The best I could describe it was "callouses" because I always held them in the cradle hold, so their mouths always suckled it the same way.  Lansinoh was a lifesaver for me. I have heard that the wool nursing pads also work wonders with pain. I have added a link about the wool pads.|`|bGcUdRkyaa	yes everyone gets sore when breast feeding so your good get used to it mom!|`|qBtTAgBqaa	Nipple blanching (turning white) after a feeding occurs when the blood flow to the nipple is limited or cut off. Blanching is most often related to latch problems. Nipple blanching is often, but not always, associated with pain. Because women may describe shooting, burning breast/nipple pain, this can be mistakenly diagnosed as thrush. If the normal color returns after your baby has finished a feeding and there is no pain, then the blanching is not a problem.<br>  <br>  The most common reason for nipple blanching is that that baby is compressing the nipple while nursing. This can be due to: <br>  <br>  a shallow latch (the most common problem) <br>  improper sucking <br>  baby clamping down to slow a too-fast let-down <br>  tongue-tie <br>  baby clamping due to allergies <br>  clampdown bite reflex <br>  palate variations, etc. <br>  When blanching is due to baby's compression of the nipple, the nipple is white and often misformed (flattened, creased, pointed, etc.) immediately upon coming out of baby's mouth. There may be a white stripe across the nipple directly after nursing. Pain may not start until a few seconds to a few minutes after nursing, as the circulation returns to the nipple. If you are experiencing pain with the blanching, then finding and remedying the underlying cause will also eliminate the blanching.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/bf/concerns/mom/nipple-blanching.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/bf/concerns/mom/...</a><br>  <br>  Have you had a lactation consultant look at your latch?|`|AiJeS6I1aa	You may have a rare phenomenon called Raynauds Syndrome.  This is when the blood vessels in the extremeties (ie. fingers, toes, nipples) constrict and limit blood flow to the area in response to a specific stimulation.  In the fingers and toes, this stimulation is often cold temperatures and the extremeties turn all kinds of interesting colours like white, blue, purple as the circulation changes in them.  This is not harmful in and of itself.<br>  <br>  It is possible that this is what you are experiencing on your nipples and is nothing to be concerned about.|`|8lcNupM2aa	Yeah very normal. It will get easier as time goes on, believe me.<br>  <br>  There are products you can use on your nipples to help them from being getting dry or cracked, which can happen also. It's called Lanisoh. It helps quite a bit.<br>  <br>  Good luck and congrats on the new baby!|`|vLOjcH7paa	Try using those soothies when you are not feeding. They work Great! : )
dae1d378a16dab63f48240cfd27d72f3aa	Ya it's creepy!  <br>  <br>  I'm all for breast feeding,  I breast fed all of my babies until they were a year old. But this is crazy!!  <br>  <br>  Tell her it's time to quit, before he invites one of his school buddies home for "lunch"|`|IFDfpbFJaa	To each his own...I couldn't do it but if it works for her it works for her .|`|R2OMEjrhaa	Yea it was time to stop a couple years ago.Try to tell her that he is going to be starting school soon, and will get made fun of.He might mention it to classmates, and that would be that start of something that will follow him. Just try to make her see this.|`|3Hm5eJfVaa	Your a little judgmental just like some of the people who are answering your question. I doubt this is a true question but it is not totally unheard of. How about you mind your own flipping business and let her sister do whatever she wants with her kids. I don't believe it is your place to butt in and tell her to stop or that he's to old. It's really none of your concern and you shouldn't even be worried. You are not the mother. Your way out of line. Please get a life and mind your own business. I am not saying I agree with it but it's not my business or yours to judge her and tell her what you think is right.<br>  You ALL are just showing your stupidity by your dumb hateful answers.|`|O3EtP4vOaa	It is her way to hold on to her baby I guess.  I personally think it is not right but it's not my kid or yours so there is nothing we can do about it.  More people do it than you think. You can tell her how you feel but then leave it at that.|`|XwjL8PZCaa	I don't believe you! that is way to weird and even child molesterish! That can't be true!|`|BWQzRrBfaa	I think it is ridiculous, too.  My sister breastfed until her child was 4.  She did it so her alcoholic ex wouldn't get any type of custody though.  Get it?  If the child is dependent on the mother, the child must stay with the mother.  But, I don't agree with it.  We would be in the store and the child would start saying, "Mommy, I want booby!".  It was very embarrassing.  In my opinion, when the child can ask for it, it's time to stop.|`|azE51WGRaa	That child should have been weaned 4 years ago! Is the child going to school? What happens when they start kindergarden? I would suggest making your sister sit down with a psychiatrist or therpist (they're both pretty much the same thing. I just don't want you to think that I'm accusing your sister of being mentally ill or something...If I offended you, I'm sorry) to figure out why she still feels the need to breastfeed her 5 year old. good luck|`|4tWt7jEkaa	the issue does not lie with the child, its with the mother. children will always get away with what they can and so he knows no different. the mom needs to realize that isnt normal. her son has been getting the nutrients he needs from solid food for 4 years!|`|UeffSgRuaa	i didnt even know milk would develop for that long.. i hope she stops it soon all his kids in the class are going to be weirded out about it and maybe not like him or something or maybe they will ask there mothers to let them still do it.. idk weird|`|uGinKU6Baa	your nephew is getting all of his nutritional needs through table foods and vitamins...there isn't a need for him to still be breastfed..since there is clear signs of attachment perhaps she could supplement the feeding aspect with other Mother-Son bonding sessions...|`|7jXChfBNaa	seriously??? um yeah that is just freakin insane....and yes it is unacceptable. that is hard for me to believe.|`|1enIWBGnaa	Sounds like your sister is just plain LAZY!!!|`|hORVMOHKaa	thats weird and creepy|`|W16vRFTNaa	That is not good... i bet he has cavities. Most moms do not know the damage they are doing to their children when they breastfeed them too long. Breast milk has a lot of sugar and if they baby teeth have cavities so will his adult teeth that's not good. And i personally think its kinda creepy. You should go on you tube and look up breastfeeding at 8. Its a documentary about a woman who breast feeds her 8 year old and show it to her. Maybe that will help ?|`|VHJ6Jp5qaa	eeeeewwwwww thats pretty nasty when the kids can ask his mom for her boob!!! i breast fed and would have never dreamt doing it that long!!!|`|RBmnfAP3aa	OMG..i think after 1 1/2... 2 is too old..thats just wrong.|`|V4U65uidaa	if i were you i would go and ask your doctor about this proplem
AA12069058	Unfortunately, it sounds like her mom has lost her damn marbles. So sad ?|`|MXXOICquaa	some parents are just like that|`|XrKviWgSaa	okay i just turned 18 back in november, and i went and stayed at my boyfriends 2 hours away for pretty much the whole summer, every other weekend and every break from school, and i would only call my mom maybe once or twice while i was there. i would stay there for two days or two weeks and just call my mom every once in a while to let her know i was okay.|`|LwLddkXmaa	i think her mom couldv'e talked to her instead of going crazy because she gonna date sooner or later and her mom should know that but about the calling all the time and checking up on her is most likely because she care bout her daughter. BUUUUT i wouldnt do that to my children, id give em some space. thats just me. an 18 yr old speakin
4Jt0uBJMaa	Sorry your having such a hard time. Natural Family Planning is a great source for trying to conceive if it's at all possible.
4d38b5e779d34e18d56ef4285647b2efaa	No. The fetus is much to small to even to be see then. I'm not even sure if you'd be able to see the yolk sac and such.  You could have heard the echo of your heartbeat which is quite common. I wasn't able to see the heartbeat until 6w3d and I could hear it with a dopplar at 12w.  I heard it at an u/s at 8 w.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	No.|`|7uznrLBXaa	Absolutely not.  I'm not even sure if it's safe to have an ultrasound at 21 days.|`|65IAbgjfaa	No no no!|`|jYPeis3Saa	no<br>  most people dont even know they are pregnant at 21 days|`|AA11134717	no hun. that's to early.|`|AiJeS6I1aa	A 21 days post-conception, the heart starts to function as a group of cells who contract rhythmically together.  The heartbeat sounds that you are talking about come from the sounds of the heart valves as they flap open and closed as blood rushes through them.  At 21 days, this is not happening yet.<br>  <br>  On an ultrasound, you can see a small flicker (the heart beating) starting at 5-6 weeks GA (from LMP).  This flicker can be translated by the ultrasound machine into heartbeat sounds.  Before then, everything is too small.<br>  <br>  So, the final answer is: no.  Not at 21 days.
IU4uNH97aa	Oliver Cade is a legend before hes even born, seriously that sounds awesome hes like destined for greatness with that now ! It's very memorable and well age with him well , I'm not just saying that because my sons name is Oliver... Oliver Cade i don't know but i just love the way it sounds .<br>  <br>  Rowan is cute its unisex now but i still prefer it for a girl.|`|GHnkKwl3aa	They both are nice!<br>  <br>  I love Oliver Cade!!!|`|QWTLw9DEaa	I love Rowan, it's a great boy's name.<br>  Oliver is ok, I just can't help but think of a dog.<br>  But they both sound good with the last name.|`|95Xn7PkJaa	I don't like Rowan, but I love the name Oliver.<br>  <br>  Oliver Cade... it sounds great.  He could be a movie star, a rockstar, a lawyer, a doctor, anything.  The name sounds pretty much universal.|`|UbCzA2JVaa	They are very cute, yet they will age well.

eya1WDS4aa	no nothing could be wrong. Prenatals dont detemine if somthing is wrong with your child. I couldnt take a prenatal with my first child, i would throw it back up after about an 30 mins to an hour. My son came out fine. im now 6 months pregnant with my second and i cant take it again due to getting sick, and so far she is health.  because of a miscarriage i would say you should start taking them if you can.|`|ejQ3yg9Naa	I actually know a lot of people who didn't take them for lot's of different reasons and they had healthy babies. I don't recommend just not taking them but I doubt anything is wrong.|`|113FoyMFaa	The vitamins replenish YOUR nutrients.  It doesn't effect the baby.|`|gXIA9yHJaa	The vitamins are to help you stay healthy not for the baby.|`|gaNm48FJaa	Probably not, but I took prenatals with my first one and not so much with my second one and her teeth rotted out as soon as they came in, unlike my first child who has nice teeth.  I'm assuming it's because she didn't have the necessary vitamins from the prenatals to give her healthy teeth.|`|hF2TsZFwaa	No, I have three kids and they all turned out healthy. I did not take prenatal vitamins with any of them.|`|u4FUeppNaa	the vitamins are more so for you then they are the baby. babies will take the nutrients they need from you.|`|m2aznd8xaa	no just start taking them again prenatals are just a pre measure to make sure its getting all its essential vitamins that dont always come with the foods you choose to eat. just start up again its never to late to start up again and your little one should be just fine.  congrats
AA11831450	I don't think you can get pregnant while menstruating, but I'm not sure.|`|m2aznd8xaa	you can have more than one egg. your uterine lining thins but isnt completely gone. you can get preg anytime you have unprotected sex.period or not.|`|w4njrW9Vaa	the ability of sperm to survive inside a woman’s body is  why it is possible for a woman to get pregnant during her periods. Sperm can survive for an average of two or three days, inside a woman’s body under normal conditions. If they receive ideal circumstances, however, they may remain viable for up to five days. So if sperm are deposited early, such as during a woman’s period, they can hang around a few days, waiting until conditions are right for conception. A woman is most likely to become pregnant if sexual intercourse occurs just before or just after ovulation. So it really depends on your ovulation.  It is possible but chances are low.|`|RhHv5pYwaa	You can become pregnant because it's according to when you ovulate. After you find out that date it may be at the end or beginning of your period. Some people's periods are funny and last 3 day's one month and 8 day's the next month. It's funny.
aIZfiU6Kaa	You should certainly continue taking the antibiotic for as long as your GP has prescribed them for because of the small risk of infection during this procedure.<br>  <br>  The main purpose of a HSG is to check for the patency (clear passage) of the fallopian tube to rule out any blockages preventing pregnancy.<br>  <br>  It's quite common during this procedure for the dye (Iodine based) that is injected into the fallopian tube to clear away small blockages in the tube if there are any and therefore to increase the chances of becoming pregnant slightly.<br>  <br>  The antibiotics would not affect any chances of becoming pregnant, but it's recommended that you use contraception until after your next period, the reason for this is because of the very rare chance that you became pregnant around the time of the procedure.<br>  <br>  There is an alternative procedure now which does the same job as the X-ray but under ultrasound and an airated sugar solution instead of the dye, with this procedure you can resume 'normal services' straight away.|`|1z3C0R2Vaa	speak with your doc he will give you a better ans than us here on yahoo good luck......)|`|ZG2ZmcjDaa	Ask for the dye that is NOT Iodine based.<br>  Many have that as well.<br>  <br>  Also, I was told to start taking the antibiotic the day before procedure,<br>  and also to take 3 ibuprophen an hour before the procedure.<br>  <br>  I wonder if the antibiotic will make sperm-antibodies,<br>  because doesnt antibody think it's a foreign object and ...<br>  well I dont know just a thought.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  AND BRING A CAMERA TO TAKE A PICTURE OF THE XRAY!<br>  I took a video of my xray result,  because the picture had glare.<br>  But I figured when else will I get a picture like this?<br>  <br>  It hurt like so much for 15 seconds.<br>  Very worth it though,  my tubes were fine.|`|2f6diQBiaa	You need to take the antibiotic. It's standard procedure to reduce infection. An infection would interfere with fertility if you don't take it. Take it now as prescribed.<br>  <br>  Good luck and lots of baby dust!!!|`|O3EtP4vOaa	I think you need to take all of the antibiotic that the doctor prescribed you.  He gave it to you to prevent an infection from developing after the test.  If he knows you are TTC then he probably gave you an antibiotic that is safe durning pregnancy.  What kind did he give you?  You can have sex while taking the antibiotic but it could cause your husband to get prostatitis depending on what kind it is.  I would not try to concieve this cycle unless your doctor told you too.  How long ago was the test? You need to let the dye be absorbed into you system and flush out or it could interfer w/ the spermies I would think.|`|oqUlYXqtaa	many antibiotics won't have an impact on ttc but always best to ask your doctors as they'll know for sure.<br>  you can find other ladies who have done an HSG and ask doctors online for free, try fertilityties.com<br>  good luck!!|`|rpjnAhIIaa	lol i aint a doctor, but i advise you friend a doctor is the best person to ask,  not random people on yahoo answers,  we aint doctor's :)<br>  <br>  hope this solves something because its the logical thing to do!|`|AA11148696	The antibiotics should't interfere at all.  You are likely only taking them for a week and the doctors are aware that you are trying to concieve so they wouldn't prescribe anything that would be bad for you in those instances.  The HSG has been known to clear a path in the Fallopian tubes which can sometimes help with conception but it's really not the norm.  Your doctor will be able to give you a better idea once your results are in.  You should have sex as normal...your doctor would have advised you if it wasn't a good idea.  Good luck!

Hunny, I am 24 years old and married and my baby was planned and I'm still nervous about being a Mommy! We can only do our very best and hope that what we do is good enough. You sound very mature for your age and by the sounds of it you will do just fine. It is great that your boyfriend is still there, it's hard to find a guy who will stick around when times get tough so be proud of him too. Don't worry about the kids at school, walk with your head held high knowing that by you staying in school, you are headed in the right direction as far as giving your daughter a good life. Education is important and after high school you probably won't see most of those people again. Keep moving forward and stay strong for your little girl...you can always turn to your family and your boyfriend for support when things seem like they might be too hard to handle. You can do it girl! Congrats and good luck!|`|duinadV4aa	you no what when i read your story it remind me of my self i was 14 when i got pregnant and 15 when i had my son and if it wasn't for him i feel my life would have went down a total different path b cuz i had just lost my mother and didn't care to much about life at the time, but i was determine to show my son that his mother was very determine and will succeed no matter what i graduated before my class and went on to college for my AA degree in nursing and now where both very happy and healthy so girl keep your head on your shoulders and continue doing what you have to do for you and your baby, just put it in the lords hands and he'll work it all out|`|y5sWmbtnaa	You are amazing and reading your story made me tear up a little bit,<br>  I don't feel like you have anything to worry about. We are all nervous to become parents no matter what age and we all have bumps in the road like you do. You are awesome and you will be a great mommy to Desirae.|`|7qTw6OHsaa	You are very mature for caring so much about your baby and your future and i applaud you for that. You seem to have a good support system at home so i think that youll be fine. Your very lucky to have such a loving and supportive family. Best of Luck!!!|`|3oSQQt6maa	I was 18 when i had my son so i havent' been in your situation.<br>  I think it is very mature and responsible of you for being so young and very brave.<br>  That is great that your parents are being supportive. One mistake that is now a lesson learned.<br>  You will be a great mom if you are there for your baby and give her unconditional love and support.<br>  You will more than likely have to put your baby in a daycare or have someone care for her while you go to school.<br>  The best you can do is stay in school and acheive your goals to have and give your baby a bright future.<br>  You can do it, it's not the end of the world.<br>  Good luck and congrats!|`|90ht2JH2aa	Ignore the person being witchy and saying your daughter will feel horrible all her life.  I'm not pregnant young but i was born to a very young single mom, so I can tell you that although it can be hard sometimes to know that you were conceived accidentally, the fact that you love your baby enough to not abort her will more than make up for it.  I can only imagine the courage you have to take on this responsibility, and you're determination to keep going with school and your life is really impressive.  I'm in college and it can be hard enough on my own, but i'm sure you can make it.  Good luck to you and your beautiful baby girl.|`|QM9JFe58aa	Someone told me a few days ago, that no matter how old you are- you are still nervous about becoming a parent. I'm pregnant too. Things happen. God doesn't allow things to happen if he knew that you weren't able to get thru it. It seems like you have a good head on your shoulders. You have family and your boyfriend's support and that's all that matters. Everything will be fine. You had a choice and you chose to give your baby life and no one can say anything about that. You will be nervous but your life is not coming to an end. It's just starting. As far as people staring at you. Don't let them win. Success is the best revenge. Do this for yourself and your baby.|`|S3t69kh2aa	You sound like you have your priorities right.  If you keep trying to be a good mother, you will be.  Don't be ashamed any more and don't worry about the kids at school.  You are in a grown up world now and what they think is not important.  It is normal to have a lot of questions.  Try to do what is best for you and your baby every day.  Do not be afraid to ask for help.  Try to join a baby group of young mothers so you can exchange ideas and have some friends.  It is good to have friends that are going through the same stuff that you are.  Have you visited the hospital yet?  It is a good idea to go, you can get familiar with the procedures and the nurses are very helpful.  I wish you the very best.  Congratulations.|`|Xtk1NkLWaa	well im 15 n not pregnant <br>  <br>  but my sister was 1 month ago shes 17 she already had him <br>  [adorable] <br>  so yeah she was really sad that my parents didnt<br>  approve of it either but they couldnt do anything<br>  about it they didt allow her to abort<br>  <br>  its GREAT ur gonna keep on going to skool<br>  dont mind the way kids see u at skool<br>  they dont know wat ur going through <br>  <br>  also u have to be strong for wat i see also<br>  it seems ur gonna be a great moommy like<br>  my sis hope ur birth goes well|`|ca9dEvSAaa	Wow, If you hadn't said you were 14 years old, I wouldn't have thought so. You sound very mature. You are aware of the difficulty and ready to face that challenge. I'm 21 years old and pregnant/single.<br>  <br>  I think that with your attitude you will make it. Your child will respect you for working so hard to give her a better life. Don't ever give up honey, it will all be worth it in the end! *I'm proud of you for taking responsibility!|`|ZNRoRWDtaa	I think its great u want to finish school and go to collage its not easy being a parent at any age I wish you the best of luck
8JM2YBEVaa	The first thing I would have to ask is if you have had a history of high blood pressure with this pregnancy.  If so or even if not you may want to check your blood pressure.  I have had a history of high blood pressure with all 4 of my pregnancies and my Dr. always tells me to watch for dizziness, headache, seeing spots or constant pain in the upper right quadrant (near rib cage).  And he always says if I experience any or all of these to get to the hospital right away b/c it could be turning into pre-eclampsia.<br>  But it also sounds like it could be labor.  Contractions can sometimes not feel quite like contractions but back pain and stomach pain.  It varies from person to person.  <br>  Have you been checking the baby's movements also?  <br>  If anything, give your Dr's office an after hours call and see what they would suggest.  Going through 4 pregnancies now, I would assume they would just tell you to go to Labor and Delivery and have everything checked out.  They may want to do some blood work and urine testing just to make sure everything is ok, as well as monitor the baby.  <br>  I know a hospital isn't exactly the place you want to spend a Saturday night, but it's for both your and your baby's well being.<br>  Good luck to you and Congratulations!<br>  <br>  <br>  Just to add to this...pre-eclampsia can start at anytime during pregnancy and your blood pressure can be perfectly fine one day and the next it can be sky high without you really thinking twice it may be your blood pressure causing this : )|`|8lcNupM2aa	Make sure you're not dehydrated.  I also think you should call the hospital and tell a nurse what's going on they will probably want to monitor you.<br>  <br>  I had a lot of pregnancy discomforts, way more than I could ever list but constant pain that didn't let up accompanied by light-headedness was not one of them. I really think you should call.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Oq2B7I4faa	Hi, I am 38 weeks pregnant today.  Last week I had similar problems too.  My upper abdomen was hurting and also my lower back was in pain too.  Mine was hurting from few minutes Straight and then it stop and come back again.  Then on my next appointment I ask my doctor what was it about and she told me that since this is my second pregnancy my ligament are not tight and strong anymore, so when the baby is changing moving or changing position it will hurt you.  She also told me to drink lot of water.  May be you should ask your doctor too.|`|AA11831450	No, this is definately not normal pregnancy discomforts. The dizziness could be vagul reaction to standing or sitting. The nausea could be pregnancy related...I was nauseated into my 7th month. The crampy pain is what doesn't make sense. Does your doctor seem concerned? I am thinking bowel issues - things do get shoved around in there and you could have a strangulated gut. I would push the doctor for answers. Best Wishes
BRT2teSqaa	Paint balling for sure.|`|VS78dqO9aa	I like the paintballing idea, or lazer tag or something like that.  Or how about this???  Ask the child what he wants to do..  Unless of course it's a surprise!  Then I would go with that....the local arcade....and of course PIZZA and plenty of it.|`|S0n3DinFaa	For my grandson's 13th birthday party we had a  A murder mystery party!   It is "grown up enough to entertain kids this age and something they get very excited about.  The plot content can be made age appropriate!  It is a big challenge for kids this age and will keep they entertained throughout the entire party!  Very cheap and simple.<br>  <br>  If your not real creativity, like I am not then do what I did and buy a kit!<br>  <br>  here is the link we used to find the kit right for us!<br>  <a href="http://entertaining.about.com/od/murdermysteries/Murder_Mystery_Games.htm" rel="nofollow">http://entertaining.about.com/od/murderm...</a><br>  <br>  good luck and have fun!|`|b6EyFLgUaa	I agree with the paint balling, My husband at 18 loved it. Be warned there is going to be ALOT of brusing from that. I asked my husband and he said lazer tag, a prof course and said he loved it at that age. He also said Chuckie cheese maybe if they really like video games.|`|uaHzhUeoaa	He into video games? Thar ya go. *thumbs up*
1z3C0R2Vaa	very regular good luck........)|`|oqUlYXqtaa	yes those are regular ( a tiny bit on the shorter end when it's 26 days) but overall i think they can be considered regular,<br>  you can also ask fertility specialists online for free, try fertilityties.com<br>  good luck!|`|Wzws8v8daa	yep that's considered regular.  even if it flucuates each month, as long as it's between about 26 and 32 days, it's considered regular.|`|culQRXw2aa	very regular; if you are wanting to estimate you ovulation you would always caulte using the max length so you would be a 30 day on average.|`|4XVqIalFaa	yeah i think thats regular, usually its around 28 days, so i think your good =]|`|XrKviWgSaa	pretty regular i say you get it within 4 days each month
HkWTYhjDaa	I'm sorry for your loss. This was once happened to me in my first pregnancy. The week i missed my period i went to the doctor and i found out that i was pregnant and did u/s we only saw a sac, and told me to come back after 3 months. She gave me prenatal vitamins that i took until 12th week until i started to bleed, so i immediately went to the doctor to found out what was wrong, so she did another u/s to find out that i my sac is still empty, there was no baby inside. And she diagnosed me  with BLIGHTED OVUM. I only then realised that the doctor may already know my case from the start but didnT told me, and she did d&c to me. But don't lose hope. Goodluck.|`|m2aznd8xaa	im so sorry but it sound like you miscarried. little bleeding and spotting is okay but if there is only a sac and no baby then you miscarried. i had my first ultra sound at 6 weeks and you can see very well the little fetus in its sac.  ultrasounds are pretty accurate especially since you say they did see the sac.  i feel the dr didnt have much compassion and didnt quite explain thing to you.   if you had heavy bleeding with clots than you did miscarry . again im sorry you are going through all of this. no one should have toe xperiance this. God bless|`|vWb8fquvaa	At 6 weeks all could have been fine and something happened afterwards. It could be missed miscarriage where the baby stopped growing weeks before your body realized it. <br>  <br>  6 weeks is early, nothing could have progressed after the u/s, which can be the reason for a possible blighted ovum (6 weeks may be too early to diagnose something like that). Or you could have passed the baby already (clots) which is why the sac was empty.<br>  <br>  There are a lot of explanations.<br>  <br>  I am so sorry for your loss. This experience is heartbreaking. My heart goes out to you.
IXBl5l5kaa	Your nipples will change as you grow. Puberty still isn't over and you have about 5 more years of development hormonally and physically. My nipples look ed considerably different from when I was 16 to when i was 21. Then I got pregnant and they got a little bigger and protruded more, then I breastfed so they obviously stick out a bit more (with help from a breast shell). <br>  <br>  Weird, but I was always jealous of the way my mother's looked. I always thought they were your typical look but she just said that's how they have been since I was little.|`|c55O7jqXaa	<a href="http://www.motheringfromtheheart.com/nipletteinfo.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.motheringfromtheheart.com/nip...</a><br>  <br>  I know you aren't pregnant or breastfeeding, but this can be used by anyone for inverted or falt nipples to help them to correct overtime. It is painless and so much cheaper than a surgery. I would check with your doctor first.|`|nD5JH7T8aa	they sell an inexpensive plastic "shell" that will make them come out. it's normally used for pregnant girls that want to breastfeed, but u could use it whether u want to or not. they only cost about $15 to $16.<br>  <br>  $15.49  <a href="http://www.drugstore.com/qxp80945_333181_sespider/philips_avent_isis/comfort_breast_shell_set.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.drugstore.com/qxp80945_333181...</a>|`|52U22fiAaa	Mine stayed flat afer giving birth, but some women's nipples change after having kids, so you never know.|`|WQ1sjTPDaa	don't worry. its changed later|`|uCLenopbaa	mine used to be flat and i had to use a nipple shield to breastfeed.<br>  and now (not even 4 months later) they aren't flat. but i liked them when they were flat..|`|v6r8R6izaa	based on my mum's friends, the nipples will come out eventually after you give birth. Cause then you will breastfeed your child. But you have to be patience..good luck!!|`|Oq2B7I4faa	I used to have flat nipples too, but now they are regular.  Don't worry yours won't stay flat either.|`|AA10153923	I have one flat (inverted) nipple.<br>  My doctor told me to squeeze it out everyday, a couple times a day for a couple minutes .<br>  <br>  ITS WORKING!<br>  <br>  I am 20 ive always had that problem|`|256cVXsmaa	Mine were flat when I was your age and still just as flat. A tiny bump comes out when i'm cold but they are still noticeably different looking than other girls nipples.  It's annoying but I'm used it now lol.
qfkK4S66aa	He's nothing compared to you...|`|yV8fog7Paa	Come to earth again, there is no such thing as an ugly person.|`|nZPGdcKJaa	well what if YOU are ugly too? (there ARE some people out there who think you're ugly)<br>  <br>  and....your personality already IS ugly|`|BBfIXcI0aa	You can get over yourself. If you've found someone you really connect with and you're willing to give that up just because he doesn't fit your idea of the perfect man, you don't deserve him. <br>  <br>  Concentrate on the good things about him. Look at pictures of him when you aren't with him and pick out little things that are attractive. Does he have pretty eyes? Does he get a certain look on his face when he's making fun of someone subtly? Everyone has little things that make them special.|`|RAgWVuu4aa	You could give him a try (go on a date or two), or just stay friends. <br>  <br>  Also, don't believe people that say you're an ugly person; it's in our instincts to look for an attractive "mate." Nothing wrong with it; you can't help who you're attracted to or not.|`|c55O7jqXaa	Well you can either drop him or be friends and just know it won't move on past that and hope that he grows out of his Ugly Duckling Stage. He just might turn out to be a nice looking guy down the road.|`|NYJgiVxraa	hmm.. i say just b friends. because, in the sense you do not exactly <br>  "really like" this guy. you like this guy for who he is so that is an up, but if u feel that hes just.. yeah; i say the best bet is for good friendship.|`|C4a1nr3Eaa	Well it depends, Can you find I guy with a similar personality and better looks? If not, and you claim he's the perfect guy for you, ya just gotta stick with him. If I was in your situation I would keep him as the backup plan. Just go out and meet some guys and see if they are good looking with a similar personality. If not, you have him to fall back on! I'm pretty sure you can give the guy a good makeover! Hope this helps!|`|hXKooWj5aa	what can you do? your basically saying you not physically attracted to him and i may never be, you can either move on or force your self to be with him just for the other things you see in him.....its all up to you|`|FVPOxaeJaa	Think of all the bad things about him to make you stop liking him. Or you can just get used to his face.|`|lHlFxeaCaa	Make him wear a paper bag with a picture of your face on it.|`|TFizPrvuaa	just start talking to me duh! lol
xq7S9H5Raa	I hear that some doctors do analyze the tissues.  I would call the doctor first and find out.  Sorry for your loss.  Much success on your future pregnancy.|`|PwhrTNZraa	My personal opinion --  I would not.  Miscarriages are more common than most people think.  If you were to have a third, then I would consider it.  I have only experienced one miscarriage and it would break my heart to have another but I wouldn't save it and have it tested unless advised by my doctor.  Sorry for your loss :(<br>  <br>  Add::  I have a friend who had 4 miscarriages back to back and they NEVER suggested testing the tissue.  Instead they did testing on HER and discovered she had developed a clotting problem.  She already had 2 children with no complications during pregnancy, so when she got pregnant this last time they new how to treat her BODY so it would not reject the baby and she is currently sitting at 14weeks with a very healthy growing baby!  Turns out for her, it was her body that was causing her problems, it had nothing to do with the tissue.|`|bb7b4M9Xaa	Do whatever you think is right, after all it is your body...although do u think there is a possibility that you may not even have miscarried? i bled twice when i was pregnant. <br>  sorry for your losses|`|fUK9y3Qkaa	Yes! That way they can do some test on it to see what was the cause of the miscarry. Sorry for your loss!|`|D3RCNSGiaa	YES, and you need to make sure you get these blood tests done BEFORE going through this painful loss again...ANA, PT, MTHFR screen, Factor V (5).
CvsZVTUTaa	Hey Sweetheart.<br>  I get major cramps when my period is coming, or has gone, or is in the middle of.<br>  What I usually do is, if it's really bad, I'll stay in bed for the day.<br>  I'll take 2 midol every 8 hours. -- It's the best! Cramps are gone in 30 minutes.<br>  I also have a heating pad. I place it on the area where my cramps are. When you have cramps its your blood clotting/ getting clogged up. The heat will warm your blood and make it run smoothly. When using a heating pad my cramps are a thousand times better in 10 minutes.<br>  <br>  But since you are off the pill now, that could be different. Those are just ways to get those cramps away. I'm sure you hate them. :/<br>  I'd suggest to go see a doctor if this continues or if your period is irregular or different than usual.|`|jzAfst8Taa	you may possibly be getting ready for implantation|`|jJ5knSwAaa	your body can change alot as you get older and just because you never felt nothing b4 doesn mean you never will, just to be on the safe side though you could ask your doc to check for cysts on the ovaries or for any signs or uterine conditions.|`|GP1YfhKEaa	your getting your period|`|ziw77iuPaa	Maybe u should just wait it out!!!
mFf8CqAraa	In a nutshell: If his parental rights have been revoked, he has no legal rights.<br>  <br>  You started out with "what are MY options..." and then went on to say, "...my friend..." Whether or not the father is you, the best bet would be for the person to contact the mother and ask if they can be involved in her sons life as a "friend". You could ask if the child knows the situation and who his father is. <br>  <br>  It is difficult to have any type of meaningful contact with the child if the father still lives in a different state. Once the child turns 18, the father can contact him on his own but it would be best to figure out if the mother ever told the child who his real father is.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	If he has no parental rights he has no rights legally. He can always try to contact the mother and see if she's willing to let him see his son. If she's not he'll have to go to court.|`|01Mu3wUeaa	He needs to go to court for his information.<br>  <br>  His rights would not have been given up by default.Did she tell him this? What did they go to court for?<br>  <br>  He needs to go to court and file for visitation.He NEEDS to be in his child's life.He cannot just walk out when things are not going his way.|`|3rda58OCaa	He doesn't have any legal rights, but i would just talk to the mom.  If he is sincere and just wants to be a part of his life and not cause any problems i don't see why she would mind.  <br>  <br>  You didn't say exactly how long ago, but it would be cruel for him to try and fight his mom for custody years later when the little boy doesn't remember him.|`|ckDkNGL6aa	Why would he move out of state and not show for court if he didn't intend to give up the child?  That makes no sense.  It took him this long to even want to contact the child, so why refuse her right to give the child a better life?  If he really cares about this child's well-being, he should probably consider what confusion and chaos it would cause him by suddenly popping in out of nowhere.  I don't know what California laws are on this one.  If he is adamant about ruining this child's sense of security then I would recommend that he speak to a lawyer about what rights he may or may not have.
HM0cxcahaa	This guys sounds like a lazy loser hun, he is mulching off of you and now he has a competitor in his own child. <br>  <br>  Tell him to shape up or ship out! I think its time for the ultimatum, if he was a real man he would step up and do what he needs to, sounds like he is not very serious about anything in his life and quite happy to loaf....<br>  <br>  You will be ok without him, you have supported him and yourself for far too long, your baby needs you to be there for it now.|`|v8AYoQPeaa	he is so using u for money, he doesnt love u or the baby u 2 made together. lose him and lose him fast!|`|WgIZUcYfaa	In a nut shell,<br>  <br>  dump your boyfriend. He sounds like a huge loser. And yes, he is using you. <br>  <br>  Focus on you and your kid.<br>  <br>  And again, get rid of the loser.|`|3oSQQt6maa	I think you should take your vitamins, and stop stressing it is not healthy for the baby.<br>  Sorry to say but the guy sounds like a user. You shouldn't have to provide for him, it should be the other way around.<br>  It does sound like is using you and if he doesn't change then he would be a bad roll model for your future baby.|`|5fmPj6uEaa	looks like he has opted out so concentrate on eating properly and on preparing for the child, then you will know male or no male real precious love, treasure your baby and forget the loser he isn't special, you are and so is your baby.keep your head up my girl and be brave and all will be well.x.|`|v4sIlwKoaa	ok wow i had the same problem a couple of years ago minus the whole preganacy thing! He is sooo using you. please dumb his sorry butt! you can do soo much better! plus you will save alot of money by not providing all that crap for him! =0)|`|2tdokuWvaa	First, if he lied to you about having Strept when he really didnt and says he's happy but doesnt visit you, you know something's wrong. He doesnt sound too happy about the baby, and he probably does'nt want to take responsibility for the baby, but hey, you know him better than I do, so go and ask him whats up. Like many people who answered, he is probably using you though.|`|lAqV1OmRaa	I'm sorry, but this guy is an immature jerk. He is using you for money and if he cared, he would be trying to make money to support the baby and calling to check on you. Leave him! I know an asshole when I see one (or in thise case, hear about him)
uNvF299Caa	It depends.  They can start as early as 6 months or as late as 10 months and sometimes they don't even crawl, they skip to walking.  It's totally normal.  You shouldn't worry.  Just give her enough tummy time and make it fun. I found a couple of articles about it if you want to read more about it.  But don't worry, specially if your neighbor's baby is walking at 10 months and your kid can't even sit up straight.  Each baby will develop at their own time. Be patient and enjoy each little phase because it flies. :)|`|fToG0uSbaa	Well. I'm 28 weeks along, and i read a book about that. The normal age is 5 months. I'm not saying she's not normal.|`|AA11134717	my baby girl didn't start crawling til about 10 months|`|n6XYYyoLaa	there is a really wide range, and babies tend to concentrate on different skills at different times, so while baby a may be working hard to learn to crawl, baby b might be working on making certain sounds, clapping, pincher grasp  (sp?), waving, etc...if she's getting where she wants to go with scooting i wouldnt worry about it..my dd is 9 mos and doesn't crawl the traditional way, but she is fast! you can't lay her down and think she will be there a second later, she's gone!|`|X3XqO1smaa	all kids are different, my son is...well not a slow learner but he does stuff when he wants to do it, and not when i want him to do it. he didn't start crawling until he was like 10 months, and he didn't walk until he was 14 months, but then my nephew started crawling at 8 months and started walking at 11 months, but i do know this girl whose little boy was like a year and couldn't talk at all, or crawl or anything, she took him to the doctor and come to find out that he was having hearing problems but if your little one if making regular sounds and looks when you say her name then she should be fine, like i said it just all depends on the child. hope this helps

125baa5bf060d0a198bc94914f749bacaa	He's fine. Einstein didn't talk until he was 3 or something. "Normal" is anywhere from 18 mos to 2 years. And boys start later. In my experience they listen longer and then tie in with full sentences. Not to worry. Encourage him gently with positive reinforcement when he does talk and help him with pronouncing. When he wants something, expect him to ask for it with words even if you know what he wants. But don't harp at him or worry about it. He's doing really well for his age and is probably a very bright little guy. Congratulations.|`|yAVKWvDMaa	All kids are different. 5 words is actually in the range of normal, although it is at the lower end.  Kids usually concentrate on one area at a time.  If they start being mobile and are more active, they don't talk as much.  Also, boys are usually slower b/c they are more active.  My daughter could say 10 words by the time she was 1 but my son did this at 15 mons. <br>  <br>  Just don't give up and continue talking to him (not baby talk like baba for bottle), listening to him (so you can respond when he does talk), sing lots of songs, read lots of books and if you're still concerned, you can have him tested before he's 3 for free.|`|1enIWBGnaa	He should be talking up a storm.  Are you working with him on words?  Buy some flash cards; alphabet letters, numbers, shapes and colors.  You'll be surprised how fast he will pick up on things.  Just be sure he repeats everything plainly and clearly.  Also, when he asks for things - do NOT give him anything until he can ask plainly and clearly.|`|5ItOGyVHaa	at 18 months baby should have a few words down but by 2 years hey can say about 100 words and can understand thousands. you will notice a big surge in his vocabulary in the next few months. but talking and reading to him helps as the more he heard the more he will be able to imitate.|`|wjKmVCNnaa	This situation is better than my cousin's. He was 3 when he started to talk sentences. At five was when I could really understand him without trouble. <br>  <br>  Boys speak and develop slower than girls so that's nothing to worry about.|`|D5dtvqb1aa	I think kids learn things at different ages and you can help by reading and encouraging him to speak more often. I have seen lots of parents let their little ones just point to what they want and grunt without even encouraging them to say a word. When my 2nd one was learning to communicate I would tell her what it was she was getting. So if she pointed to a sippy cup with milk, I would say something like 'oh, you want a drink of your milk' and now she is just over 2 and can carry on a full conversation with you. Just takes time and repetition.|`|6ZjoX2Akaa	First of all, "babynumb" is wrong about boys talking later than girls. It depends on your child just like every other milestone. I have 2 boys. My oldest starting talking at 8 mos. and my youngest at 6 mos. My youngest was saying full sentences at 12 mos. Don't be too worried, he may just not want to talk. He may be more of child who studies things. My brother never said a word until he was 3, but when he did start talking he sounded like a 5 or 6 year old.|`|4tWt7jEkaa	children develop at their own pace. it is recommended toddler start saying anywhere from 5-10 words by the 2nd year. make sure you dont talk for him. ask him more question & make every situation a leaning/talking lesson. when you walk outside point to the sky & say "sky" etc... he will get it!|`|V4U65uidaa	every  baby learns thing at diffident times maybe give him a little more time   and if that doesn't help  then go to a speech  Doctor  well good luck!|`|GlzVQclpaa	All of my friends that have had boys, their kids talk later, girls tend to start talking a lot earlier go figure! I wouldn't worry a whole lot about it. But if your loosing sleep over it call the pediatrician.

I took m y daughter on a long plane ride when she was a  month old...<br>  <br>  Key things to remember when you are flying with an infant... get them a seat for themselves, especially if you are flying a long distance. It's too hard to hold your baby for several hours. <br>  <br>  make sure you bring plenty of formula for the trip , or if your breastfeeding bring something to cover up with. Feed on takeoff and landing to help clear your baby's ears since they can't do this themselves. <br>  <br>  Talk to your pedi about motion sickness in children, just in case you might have a child that suffers from  this...|`|vLOjcH7paa	Your baby should be ok - I did read that even on an airplane they should be strapped in a carseat.

Have a heart to heart with her after you do some research and have that research with you so she can read it too. Chances are she knows about the danger she is putting you in, but she just can't help herself. Smoking is soooo addictive, I know, I was a smoker for many years. Ask her to please stop smoking in the house for the sake of your health. If she doesn't, then ask her to buy an air filter for your bedroom, as well as a TV and stereo and whatever else you need in their to do homework, live, etc.,  so you don't have to be in the smokey environment. I think that would be only fair! Best wishes.|`|DnNkCF6Taa	I would do some research on the effects of second hand smoke and then ask your mom that with all the smoking that she does, how does she feel about you taking up smoking as well.   If she goes full against it tell her about second hand smoke, and her smoking in the house is effectively doing that to you.  If she doesn't care then I don't think you will be getting anywhere on this issue.|`|zzSEtUvBaa	Is your father around? If your parents are separated, can you live with him? How about grandparents?<br>  <br>  Try to get a good air purifier for your room and spend most of the time there if possible.<br>  <br>  Tell her that you wouldn't do anything that she wants you to do until she stops smoking in the house.|`|VS78dqO9aa	Talk to your father again... Make him understand again how much it is bothering you.  You shouldn't have to suffer.  Tell your mom, your going to tell your teacher if she doesn't' do something about it.  Is she a good mom other than this?  Doesn't sound like it.  Reminding you that you are a little girl just because your showing her the facts?  sounds like she's acting like a little girl.  Although, smokers are very defensive people.  I don't know why, but they are.  I think they know that they are hurting themselves, adn others, but are so addicted that they just don't want to admit it.|`|qWNSRq4xaa	Sounds like she's a self centered, ignorant, uncompassionate person. Find all kinds of terrible literature about second hand smoke related deaths and leave it everywhere. Ask her what she'll wear to your funeral. Tell her you don't mind if your college tuition money is spent on chemo. treatments. I smoke, and subjecting my girls to it seems incomprehensible. It's MY choice to smoke, not theirs.|`|ZjuoiLCeaa	well this is what i did...<br>  <br>  I told my mother that if it was okay for her to smoke that it was okay for me to. Of course she said it was different, but i told her she didn't quit or at least go outside i was going to start. This shocked her because i'm only 15, but she hasn't smoked in the house since.|`|01kEv36Faa	Wipe your tv screen with a papertowel .  I'm sure it will be black.

I spent all day in a sawdust-filled workshop and breathe vehicle fumes all the way home and had to sleep on smoke smelling sheets, but here's how I got by before I left... I stuck a towel on top and under the door way and kept it closed at all times, limiting my entries and exits to essential functions (bathroom, eating, earning my allowance by making cigarette runs, etc.) airing out the room even in the middle of the night (WARNING: not recommended on basement level apartment suites in seldom patrolled neighboorhoods)), pointing a fan out the door, airing the place out by opening the front door and the windows every opportunity I got, and if all else fails telling dad to quit his damn smoking or I'll get another cold and pass it on so we can both have colds  >: D|`|382b69da7c50fc8ccf68048ab522a879aa	That would be very frustrating for you. Yes, it is her house, yet what she is doing is not only selfish of her, but very bad for your health. Passive smoking may as well be you smoking too.<br>  It is hard for her to understand, but for a non smoker, the smell is very noticable, and disgusting!<br>  What she is doing should be illegal, I think anyway. If she wants to smoke, she should do it outside, nowhere else. You have the right to breathe in fresh, clean air.|`|rNvXWMOMaa	take all her cigarettes and throw them away,<br>  <br>  oh, you might get grounded big time for doing it,<br>  but you would of made your statement.
gP0gYbBaaa	no she didnt. but are moms ever fair?|`|fa571b1e23d4b992ac1d5df0e55b19a3aa	well, it was a little rude. But no reason for your mom to flip out. I mean, you could just delete the comment. No big deal.|`|FvhCUHjxaa	It was rude but you didn't deserved to get screamed at for it. I don't like my cousins either; all of my first cousins are either a. into drugs or drinking or b. in jail.|`|cmoGATT9aa	i guess she might have been a bit upset, they might have been her cousins, she was probably fond of them.<br>  though it does sound like she over reacted.<br>  my mother wants me to be best friends with my first cousin (my age) but i don't like her. she went off the hezay when i told her this. (her and her sister were all 'oh they can be BEST friends like we were when we were kids') <br>  anyway, maybe it's just best to act interested...
in7qi4oZaa	I see why you hit him. That was disturbing. You really do need to tell your husband and admit him to get therapy.|`|VS78dqO9aa	Yes I would tell his father.  Obviously it's time to have the birds and the bees talk.  He is most likely just curious.  I would suggest counsling also.  It never hurts.  But the father definately needs to speak with him, and explain why it's wrong, well illegal, and give him other options.  I know you don't want to think about it, but your son is obviously growing up and needs a release.|`|sB5dyaczaa	I would have spanked his butt hard and told him to go into the kitchen and NEVER let him out of my site. Yes tell the Father. Yes get him to a dr. He needs help. He might have sexual desires. And that could be a problem.

My jaw literally dropped when I read that.  Your child needs some help, I know teenage  boys get curious but wow! That's uhh .. that's different.  I mean, was he embarrassed??<br>  <br>  Uhh .. HOW'S YOUR DOGS BUTT????|`|vJ2i0BDPaa	Oh man i don't even know what to say about that. I think you should take him to a psychiatrist. Oh and whatever you do dont tell his father he'll be crushed and probably beat him the way you did.|`|AA11455587	If you know his father is going to be angry..don't tell him yet. it will scare your child. you have to be gentle because he is only 13 and he doesn't know much about anything. I think he did that because he was exploring..it's specific to his age. or maybe..his friends..had a certain influence. this is all about at this age: influence and curiosity. so you shouldn't be very mad about this.<br>  talk first to you boy and ask him if he knew what he was doing, ask him what were his intentions..and try to be patient and friendly..(don't forget that children can be easily scared at this age).<br>  If you don't manage to find out what's in his head after one conversation go to a psychiatrist. that shouldn't be a problem nowadays.<br>  remember: talk to your boy, be open-minded, be friendly, be nice and maybe he will speak out. if he doesn't..you know what to do.|`|2Hot9EJiaa	for the person that said, "don't tell his dad, because it would scare him"- don't take that advice. You need to tell his dad and immediately.  This is something that most likely could use some intervention from a psychologist, before it actually gets out of hand.  However, when you do talk to your son together with your husband, be gentle - yelling and screaming will accomplish nothing. This is VERY disturbing to me.  This behavior is not normal for anyone let alone a 13 year old boy.|`|IU4uNH97aa	seriously thats odd.<br>  <br>  I think you should make him tell his dad, my husband just told me if anything like that happens with our sons he wants to know so i think you should tell him. <br>  <br>  Maybe discuss what he was doing and try and tell him that masturbating is okay as long as its ALONE and in private. But be open minded to what he has to say and just let him talk and give the advice after.<br>  <br>  I don't really know what i would do from there but just try and talk to him. See from what he says about the situation to see how you can really handle this.
VYCLwKwNaa	You are one smart man!<br>  First, you can write a letter to the judge that awarded custody to your brother and ask that your mother not be allowed to call or come around. Judges have seen everything, so just say what is on your mind and why having her around is not good for you. <br>  <br>  If you have any kind of social worker or school counselor that you talk with, they can help you with this.<br>  <br>  If there is any kind of free legal services in your town, see if you can find a lawyer or a state "child welfare" or "family law" attorney to tell you how things work. The judge may even be able to tell you in what order you need to do things. <br>  <br>  If you don't feel comfortable talking with your brother in person, then write him a letter and tell him how you feel.<br>  Something like this, maybe....(you"ll notice that I used many of your own words from your question. You are a better writer than you think.)<br>  <br>  Dear (brother and sister-in-law's names),<br>  I can't thank you enough for taking me into your home. You have taken care of me and saved me from a terrible life. You are my family, and the only parents that I have. You really know me. I want to have a normal life, and seeing Mom is not good for me. I want to be with you forever. I want to change my name to yours. I know that it would cost some money and be a lot of trouble, but can we find a way that you could adopt me? I would really like that.<br>  Love,<br>  (you)|`|5pwlCgBwaa	just get the address to the court house and send them a letter of hat your mom does and how runk se always is and tell them that you don't want to see your mom cuz she is always wasted never sober. and they will have to send you to someone in the family that is more responsible for you. <br>  <br>  hope this works out for you|`|LIGYejglaa	Has she ever hit you?<br>  <br>  If so, you can file for a permanent restraining order, which is free.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <waves to my thumbs-down stalker>|`|BOia61xbaa	You have a lot on your plate.I'm sorry to read that because you sound very young. If you want your care givers to adopt you I would say do it casually and with your own words. Let them know that you think this is what is best for you. Explain to them and may be a judge or a social worker who handles your situation that being in contact with your mother is getting on the way of your happiness and that you want the stability of a permanent home. Be aware that even if you are adopted by your brother and his wife it doesn't mean your mother will be kept away from you with an iron wall. I don't know how reasonable she is but may be you can let you mother know that you are unhappy with her presence and that you've given her enough chances. As for the money and the time all I can tell you is that if a young brother of mine was feeling this angry and neglected I would not spare money or resources if that could help. If they have been taking care of you for years it is obvious that they care about you and they want to give you a home.|`|yKS2UI87aa	Just explain it to them like you have here. Maybe if they weren't into the idea of adopting you they could at least not make see her; say if they knew she was coming you could conveniently be somewhere else. Depending on how old you are you may be able to go back to court and modify her visitation if you older than 13 the judge takes your feelings into consideration. You don't need to talk to her if she is drunk whether on the phone or at your house go into your room and ignore her. If she can't stay sober to see you than it's for your own safety you don't see her.

vWb8fquvaa	The statistics regarding miscarriage vary widely depending on the source. Here are some of the basic numbers.<br>  <br>  Almost 20% of pregnancies end in miscarriage, with the majority occurring during the first 12 weeks.<br>  <br>  There is a 75% chance of miscarriage in weeks 1-2 of pregnancy, when you do not know you are pregnant.<br>  <br>  There is a 10% chance of miscarriage in weeks 3-6 and this number drops to 5% during weeks 6-12.<br>  <br>  During the second trimester the chance of miscarriage drops again to 3%. After you’ve reached 20 weeks gestation, it is no longer considered a miscarriage.<br>  <br>  For repeat miscarriage the statistic are as follows:<br>  <br>  If you have had a miscarriage during your first pregnancy, your chances of another miscarriage are 10-13%.<br>  <br>  If you have had one or more live births and one miscarriage your chance of another miscarriage is around 10%.<br>  <br>  There is a 40% chance of a repeat miscarriage if you have had two pregnancies and two miscarriages.<br>  <br>  The chance of multiple miscarriages is lower, at around 13%, if you have had one or more live births.<br>  <br>  If you have had three pregnancies and three miscarriages there is a 60% chance you will miscarry again. If you have had four miscarriages with no live births your chances of a healthy pregnancy drop to 0-5%.|`|hPkSWRAkaa	No, they are actually lower...unless you have some kind of medical problem that will make it difficult for you to carry full term. That said...I had two miscarriages..one in Dec 2006 and one in Dec 2007. But then I got pregnant in the end of Jan last year and now I have a 4 month old baby boy! I have also found that miscarriage is more common than most people know..meaning it happens to a lot of people..anyway..Good luck and congratulations!|`|xq7S9H5Raa	Unfortunately it is more common than you think.  I pray that your pregnancy is successful and you get to deliver a healthy baby boy or girl.  Best of Luck!  God Bless!

J38v75bvaa	its probably her period. she can always go get the morning after pill...just to make you both worry free|`|ejQ3yg9Naa	She got her period probably. And no I seriously doubt she's pregnant.|`|IjOEpqgOaa	Okay.<br>  <br>  1. NO chance that she could get pregnant! <br>  2. It didn't break<br>  3. Had to be her period coming on, since she started cramping.|`|vWb8fquvaa	Wow. Lack of sex education at its best.<br>  <br>  If you washed your hands then it is impossible to get her pregnant with your finger. Unless for some miraculous reason your fingers produce sperm.|`|y5sWmbtnaa	It may have been her hymen because even riding a bike can break it. Or could be her period.<br>  She won't get pregnant.|`|AA11197832	Come on you canNOT be serious.|`|gRWzLHVEaa	There is zero chance you could get her pregnant that way. Oxygen kills sperm and you also washed your hands ... Are you old enough to be having sexual relations? You should talk to a parent about proper methods of birth control if you think you may have sex. And I doubt that was her hymen. She has all the classic symptoms of menstruation.|`|w4njrW9Vaa	did you dry your hands??  i dont think sperm can live outside the body for very long so pregnancy is probably not an issue.  As far as her hymen, you would have to have been pretty rough with your fingers to cause that to happen.  You can go to SteadyHealth.com and ask this question.  That sight is pretty helpful.
AA11831450	Your probably ovulating from the left ovary...|`|8lcNupM2aa	You could have a cervical infection, which usually isn't that big of a deal but it can cause lots of pain.  However, since I've had my baby (11 months ago!) I have had really bad periods.. especially those first few. There was a lot more cramping than usual and they were a little bit heavier.  When you feel cramping like that it can also be you ovulating.. if you hear or feel a weird pop you'll know thats what it is.<br>  <br>  It's probably best to call your Dr. on Monday just to be safe even though you should have just seen the Dr. not long ago for your postpartum check up.<br>  <br>  Good luck and I'm pretty sure you'll be just fine.|`|bb7b4M9Xaa	I have had the same things, i think it's normal...im 14 weeks postpartum and its gone! x|`|DXZK6eMNaa	You just pushed a bowling ball out of your hoo-ha, give it some time to get back to normal.

WbaSpiYpaa	Sweetie, the chances of you having another stillborn is almost nil.  It won't happen.  They say that if  you have a miscarriage or stillborn you have over an 80% chance of having a perfect pregnancy next time.  Don't worry, you will be just fine.  <br>  <br>  I had a miscarriage a year ago, and now I'm pregnant again so I do know how you feel.  Right now I'm 30 weeks, and am still pretty scared something will happen to my little girl, but you have to have faith everything will be O.K.  Good Luck!|`|LfZk2NGBaa	I am sorry to hear of your loss.I have no idea what your chances are. But I would think they would be good that you will make it to full term if your doctor said it was a fluke.
P8CBDLiKaa	A second opinion is always a good idea when you are not sure of the diagnosis.|`|aLAmvX5Naa	I would definitely have a second ultrasound done, have 3 more if need be, until you are 110% sure in your heart that the doctors are right.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Have them recheck if you don't believe them but you would not be feeling flutters this early. it's actually most likely gas. It's physically impossible to feel the baby at 10 weeks. The earliest it's possible is 15.|`|giRRCXU4aa	By this time in your pregnancy they should definitely be able to see more than just a sac, so the possibility that you miscarried is definitely high. I had my first ultrasound at 6 weeks and they saw more than just the sac then. Good Luck to you.|`|cnDCq1tvaa	read this.|`|56YFjZxAaa	i know what your going through... I had a miscarriage in sept, and and found out today im pregnant... so im extremely scared. but to get to your question, with my first miscarriage i saw 4 different doctors and they all told me different things. the first one said i had miscarried and there was no baby. I went back two weeks later to get a d and c, they told me the baby was healthy.  i went for a check up 2 weeks later and they couldn't find a heart beat. they asked if i wanted a d and c, but i told them no because they didn't know what they were doing. I soon passed the baby and had to go to the er. It was the hardest thing to pass it, sometimes i wish i had a d and c, but i would have always wondered and never forgave myself... i hope this helps.
xtmFBjO9aa	Sure you could still be pregnant.  The brand of the tests do not make a difference.  With this pregnancy I used a dollar tree brand before my period and got a positive.  All women's levels are different.  No two pregnancies are identical.  Be patient and try not to stress so much.  Take an early morning test tomorrow if possible.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Take a test every 2 or 3 days if you still don't get your period. You can also go to your doctor and get a blood test done.
obN6p3Cgaa	No......|`|WA9Y8QAEaa	Okay :)
nZVmkZSBaa	Of course there is. :)|`|kc2Sa7ibaa	*facepalm*<br>  <br>  "I had unprotected sex three weeks ago" - There is your answer! Take a test. Of course there is a possibility. No-one on the other side of the world or country or whatever can help you.|`|Q08GpskDaa	You might be. Though you may just be late. If you don't get your period in the next few days you should take a pregnancy test, and if you are pregnant, figure out what you are going to do next.|`|3bhXzeBaaa	It is possible that you could be pregnant... but I can't really say... Women experience symptoms differently, sometimes they don't get symptoms at all... I suggest you take a test a week after your expected period if you haven't gotten it because that would be the perfect time to determine if you have a little baby in your tummy :) If your test comes out positive... congrats! If it comes out negative... make sure to play safe if you don't want to be a mommy yet :)|`|49LiABmvaa	there's always a possibility!<br>  take a test!!!|`|03a6Kb3Vaa	use a CONDOM!
pL8T1sAPaa	If your boyfriend is afraid of getting you pregnant, the best way to avoid getting you pregnant is to not have sex at all. If you and your boyfriend, like most people, do not like this, then the second best way is to use both a condom(or nuva, in your case) and birth control pills. If there is a legitimate scientific study, that says one is better than the other, than go with that. Tell him, I know you believe a condom is better, but a heard a study saying that this is actually more effective. On top of that I am also on birth control.<br>  <br>  If you think he doesn't want your child if you indeed have one, do not worry about that until and if that happens. You love him, he loves you, be happy.|`|s7f07TgTaa	Hopfully you will have better luck than me but I was on the nuva ring and I got pregnant after using it for 3 months|`|KRLadp79aa	He sounds selfish, as for that I'd suggest it'd be best if he got a vasectomy.|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	option one: just deal with it and let him have his condoms<br>  <br>  option two: tell him you wont have sex if he uses condoms and go without sex<br>  <br>  or you can try talking to him, if that dosent work just either accept it or dont have sex anymore, its compleetly understandable that he dosent want kids right now, there is nothing wrong with the way he is acting, he is being smart<br>  <br>  and having sex on birth control is not unprotected|`|pzLDXL6gaa	If he's paranoid then use condoms as well as the nuva ring to make him feel better. If you don't want condoms then either you'll have to convince him 99% is okay or find a new boyfriend. I think it's good that he's responsible. Are you sure it means if you did get pregnant he wouldn't want the child, or just that he wants to do everything possible to prevent it?<br>  <br>  Harriet|`|MzHwklzKaa	I've never known a man to voluntarily use condoms, and as soon as they hear their women is on birth control, they can't wait to toss them.<br>  <br>  So, if he's insisting, it's pretty important to him, and you need to respect that.<br>  <br>  You need to realize that not everything is about you.  Just because he's obsessed with birth control doesn't mean he doesn't love you.  It doesn't even mean he doesn't want your baby.  He just doesn't want a kid right now.|`|nZPGdcKJaa	respect the fact that he realizes that he is not ready for parenthood and is trying to avoid it<br>  there are certain things that a good/prepared couple needs in order to be successful parents.  One thing is to WANT a child.  He either thinks he is too young, not enough money, you guys aren't married, or he still has things to accomplish in his life first.<br>  Don't hold this against him<br>  just find a solution that makes you both happy|`|2e3741216767a389faecfd74b525fe41aa	He probably just wants a BJ.|`|Ps0tDYBAaa	to grow the **** up already.
9Yh62uDvaa	it's the age that defines them as a juvenile. are you thinking of juvenile delinquents?|`|MeYILJeSaa	Juvenile=young. <br>  You seem to be confused with your definitions. <br>  Juvenile is not a sickness...|`|AA10500537	not enough supervision
nD5JH7T8aa	it never hurts to try! i think it's great that u still want to nurse your son! it's so much better for him! <br>  <br>  you may need to pump since he is now used to the bottle, he may not take your breast. as for the taste, he will get used to it (after all, formula tastes disgusting!) lol<br>  <br>  if he doesnt seem to like the breast milk @ first, try mixing it 1/2 & 1/2 with his formula and gradually add more breast milk, so it wont b such a  change for him.<br>  <br>  and don't worry if his poop becomes more watery, that's just how breastfed babies are. (their bodies break down and absorb the nutrients in breast milk much more efficiently than formula, resulting in less waste). <br>  <br>  good luck!  =)|`|n6XYYyoLaa	it won't taste the same, but at that young i doubt he will care....if you can do it, go for it..|`|kaqPSgTVaa	You can try but he may not want it.|`|xRZ1PRZwaa	Hi! It's not too late at all. Your best bet is to work with your son to have him latch correctly. If you need help, there should be a lactation consultant available through your Public Health Unit or the hospital where you delivered.<br>  <br>  But, until you can get some support, keep trying. Even the baby suckling a bit will help your milk production to continue and improve.<br>  <br>  You're making milk, you have a baby - it's the perfect combo! Your milk supply will increase and continue the best if you actually nurse. Pumping may work for you, but not as well as nursing, and please know that pumping doesn't work for all women (it doesn't for me).<br>  <br>  I hope this is helpful - you can DEFINITELY do this! Good luck sweetie!|`|c55O7jqXaa	All you can do is try. It has only been 6 days so maybe you will luck out. Try to get him to latch on again if you can instead of pumping, but if he is already used to the bottle go ahead and try it.|`|kOoCya9Oaa	Why am I suddenly thirsty ?|`|QKh7voVKaa	you will be fine to switch to breast milk. It's only the first 3 or 4 days that you have colostrum, after that the milk you produce is the same throughout. you may need to gradually go from formula to breast as the amount of milk you make is directly related to how much baby drinks from you. good luck. I don't know why you needed formula to try and get baby to gain weight? Not criticizing just curious, were you producing enough milk, you may need to drink more fluids. It will taste fine to him.|`|bxH8zngPaa	As long as you are still producing milk, it's not too late to restart the breastfeeding process.  Mother's milk gives the baby nutrients that formula lacks.  Just be patient in case he turns his nose up at it.  I would start with the pumping to increase your milk production.  Once you've done that I would breast feed him normally and just supplement with the formula.  Breastfeeding is a wonderful time to bond with your baby and feel relaxed.  Good luck!|`|U1wAKo1Gaa	I can't comment on his "taste buds" but I can tell you that it is not too late to resume breast-feeding....Get a good quality pump and follow the same type schedule, routine, and pattern that your baby would .... fool your breasts into thinking your baby is nursing... and continue to do so until you and your baby are absolutely sure you are ready to stop.....<br>  <br>  YAAAAYYYY!!!  BFding is such a special time for mom and baby - your gonna love it just as I did - ENJOY|`|7Nh451AGaa	yes he will as long as you breast feed him when he shows signs of hungriness. yes it will taste the same as before you don't need to worry about this.|`|y1n0xbioaa	It is not yet too late if you want to breast feed him try it you will never know it will work for your child. All the best.|`|DXZK6eMNaa	no 18 day old baby will refuse the boob, go for it.  whats the worst that will happen?|`|a062cdf53535e2daebff62003f86699caa	no|`|z7bW8v9qaa	If you are still producing milk it is definitely not too late.  <br>  Pumping is not very efficient.  If you are pumping instead of nursing, you are going to lose your milk supply over a short time.  Your body makes milk because your baby takes it, but pumps don't remove as much milk as a baby, and so your body produces less and less each day.  In the early weeks, its easy to boost your supply, but its also easy to lose it altogether.<br>  Latch him on- that will be the tough part, and let him nurse as long as possible.  He may be tough to latch on properly and lazy from using a bottle, or he may take right back to it.  Its only been 4 days, but for him that's a lot of time.  He may have to relearn how to take the breast.  He may get angry/frustrated after the stored milk has been depleted, if he suckles longer it will probably trigger another letdown.  If not, switch sides and get him going.  Switching sides early in the nursing will help you quickly build a supply.  It does not, however, give him the high fat hindmilk, so he will need to nurse frequently.  If he gets frustrated because the easy milk is gone and you are not having additional let downs, then offer him 2 oz of formula after the nursing- only after he has nursed you out.  And be there to nurse him round the clock to rebuild your supply.  After a day or two, your supply will start to catch up and you can nurse him longer on each side.  The high-fat hindmilk that he needs to gain weight comes after the initial lower-fat foremilk has been nursed away.  <br>  If he's having issues gaining weight nursing it could be that he's trading sides too soon, giving up the fatty milk in favor of faster flowing milk on the other side.  It could be that his gut is not processing something in your milk (commonly dairy products can cause this- but then he would also have issues gaining weight on dairy formula as well).<br>  Track his number of wet diapers, make sure he's filling up and drowsing off and nurse nurse nurse.  In a short time he will no longer have a need for the formula.  <br>  <br>  Call the lactation consultant at the hospital where you gave birth or a La Leche League Leader if you need more help.  They are everywhere.

Y1Lb5f4Eaa	There's always a chance, no matter how little alcohol you drink that it will effect the baby. The sad truth is that one drink can effect one baby's brain development, and another woman can knock them back and not have a problem. It's really a flip of the coin. I actually can't remember if I drank anything before I knew I was pregnant (in those first 2-3 weeks before you start thinking, hey I'm a little late.) It's scary because I've been around people that have Fetal Alcohol and it's not their fault. There's a lot of really good information online through the CDC and such that you can look at. Now that you know you're pregnant I hope that you don't drink anymore and I wish you the best with your baby.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Most likely you are fine. Many women have this same issue. Your doctor will tell you the same thing.|`|1NWjta2jaa	If you consider a baby with an alcoholic mother being OK, than your baby is OK.|`|yKS2UI87aa	That actually happens more than you think. I had drank on a couple of occasions before I found out as well and my son is perfect. As long as you don't do it any more your baby should be fine. I used to work at a grocery store (small family ran, not chain) an every day customer was pregnant and she always came in and bought 3-4 24 oz cans of Coors (I always assumed it was for her hubby) I said why don't you get a 12 pack (they were on sale) for your hubby that way he'll get more and you save money. She said oh, no these are for me. Jaw now on floor. I very politely told her she shouldn't drink while preggy. She said her Dr. said a few drinks while she was pregnant wouldn't hurt. I had to explain a few meant like once a month, not a few a day. Duuuuuuhhhhh! Sound like you are on the right track.|`|5fmPj6uEaa	quit drinking and if smoking stop and then stop fretting it is unlikely you have done anything to baby and if you had the ultra sound etc would pick up on it. relax and be happy.|`|qZPXskOGaa	There iz a chance nuthin will be wrong.... i hpe not...
rTACLd3Saa	Aha! I can answer this one! I did tons of stroller research and I found the perfect one! It's the Valco Latitude. It is a 3 wheeler but not a jogger and it is only 17 lbs (most of the others are almost twice as heavy!) It folds very small and is super light. The front wheel swivels or locks out. It has a nice, roomy cargo basket underneath which is very sturdy and holds a ton of stuff. It comes with the attachment straps to add the carseat when baby is a newborn (which you won't need if your baby is already 1) but for the older babies the seat is super adjustable. Baby can sit almost completely upright to see the world or even lie completely flat for naps. It has a nice big canopy for sun shade and even comes with the wind/rain cover and cold weather boot included! All the other strollers I looked at that were in the same category ended up being much more expensive because the accessories are sold separately. I paid almost $300 for the whole thing and it was worth ever penny! It is able to be used up till 50 lbs too! So you should never have to buy another one down the road. Also I like to travel a lot and its super light for getting in and out of the trunk or on and off the plane etc. My daughter, Avary, and I (she's 10 1/2 months old now) flew from CT to Hawaii -with multiple stops -  for the first two weeks of Feb and it worked out great!  Everyone was commenting on how cool it was.  It even has a telescoping handle so if you are on the tall side it's still very comfortable to push. Very maneuverable, smart design, looks great! I can't say enough good about it! Check it out online at: <a href="http://www.babystrollershop.com/valco_latitude_single.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.babystrollershop.com/valco_la...</a><br>  or right on the Valco website at <a href="http://valcobaby.com/products/strollers.html?tx_productcatalog_pi1%5Buid%5D=5" rel="nofollow">http://valcobaby.com/products/strollers....</a><br>  Hope this helps you!

256cVXsmaa	Oh personally (I'm a bit of a psycho jealous insecure girlfriend according to my boyfriend) I would definitely confront him about it.  If they literally exchanged numbers than he is obviously planning on cheating.  You should confront him before he actually acts on these urges.  If I read what you read I would have blown up in his face and it probably would have been bad, you seem a lot more calm than me lol.  I would just talk to him about it, obviously something is bother him if he is looking for sex elsewhere.  If you don't stop it now he will continue to do stuff like this thinking he is getting away with it. I wouldn't tolerate it.  Just explain to him that it was logged on already and it wasn't like you were purposely snooping.<br>  <br>  EDIT: oops I re-read your question and I must have missed that you guys broke up previously before you read this.  So obviously he wrote this after you guys broke up?  Sorry than scratch what I have said.  I still would talk to him about it just because I would be in the heat of the moment if I were you but It isn't really right to be TO mad only because you did break up.  Sorry I am a bit sleepy and didn't really read your question thouroughly lol|`|apSTH4TIaa	I agree with Alison.  You are broke up.  Its not your business anymore what he does in the bedroom.  If you bring it up it is just going to make you sound like a jealous ex or something.  If he is making poor choices with his sex life that is up to him.  The only thing you are responsible for is making sure you steer clear of the drama for your baby's sake.  You don't want to get involved.  Besides who would you be helping-your ex? the married woman?  leave it alone because yes he would be mad.  Give him the same privacy you would expect.  Good luck.|`|kWXik6phaa	If you broke up...then leave it as your broken up. Don't meddle in his business the same way you wouldnt want him meddling in your private life. your having a kid together, great, but just remember that your broken up and respect that. I say don't tell. Leave it alone. All your going to do is come across as a jelous bitter ex and it wil make the situation worse in the long run|`|aXFe4vKAaa	U r lucky.....that U knew about d matter......<br>  But dont charge ur bf.........<br>  better u observe him & try to confirm about d matter......<br>  dont let him to know now that u r  concern about his planning ....<br>  <br>  <br>  .........................Best of luck

S3t69kh2aa	I breastfed my twins for 1 year and started them on sippy cups at 7 months.  By the time they were one, they were experts!  I never gave them a bottle.  Just keep offering the sippy cup and maybe just give a bottle at nap time and bed time.  Then stop the bottle at nap time, and finally stop the bottle at bed time.  Watch for signs of readiness, and pick your battles!  If she is not feeling well, she will want the bottle just for comfort.  Just try everyday to use the cups more and the bottle less without putting a lot of stress on either of you.  Good luck!|`|X3XqO1smaa	8 months is a good age to introduce the sippy cup and nuby is a great sippy cup, my son was off of the bottle completely by age 1 and so was my nephew, first we started putting his juice in his sippy, then we slowly started putting his milk in there, once he got use to the sippy, and some kids are different, it may take longer.|`|X8nw0UQEaa	I started my daughter at 11 months and gave her a month to get adjusted to it.  I started off with one of those cheap Nuby ones because they really aren't all that different from bottles.  I also threw away all her bottles so I wouldn't give in.  Eventually they'll start using the sippy cup, especially if they're thirsty enough! :)  Good luck!|`|BWQzRrBfaa	Nuby makes cups with three stage nipples.  The first stage is just like a bottle nipple (kind of like Avent nipple, but a little different).  The second stage is like a cross between a nipple and the Nuby cup nipple.  And the third stage is the regular Nuby nipple.  These things are awesome for transitioning to cups from bottles.|`|3oSQQt6maa	I started my son at 11 months and just took away the bottle, and never gave it back.<br>  Just keep insisting every now and then.|`|p2Njf5gBaa	I started offering the cup at 6 months,,,,, but he had no interest in drinking from it.  He just played with it, which is  part of discovery and learning. <br>  <br>  By 8 months he started drinking from it well.  I had to try some different sippys when starting out.  I know my son never cared for the nuby sippy cups....  her like the gerber sip and smile.   I think by 9 months you should try and have your baby start drinking from a cup more often.  But, all babies learn this skill at different times,  so if she isn't ready or using the sippy by 9 months,  don't fret, just keep offering and working on it with her.  <br>  <br>  Now at 13 months my son will drink out of any sippy,  so the all the extra cups I had to go through finding the right beginner cup are now getting some use and have come in handy.   <br>  <br>  As far as offering the juice in a bottle,  it was okay to once to see if it was the cup or the juice she didn't like,  but from now on I would discourage it.  Instead,  if she likes juice,  only offer it in a cup.  This will help encourage her to want to drink from the cup. <br>  <br>  Good luck!  :)|`|n6XYYyoLaa	welll i have about 12 varieties of sippies and she wouldn't take any....not even put it in her mouth!! then she got a really cheap, thin, plastic, no valve cup with a lid and holes from my sil at christmas....that's the only thing she will drink out of as far as sippy cups go! i started trying to get her to use them when she started solids at 5.5mos old, but she was almost seven at xmas....good luck...|`|ggfE4rlvaa	I was attempting you wean my daughter from nursing with a cup at about 10months. She took to the cup perfectly but, unfortunately wouldn't give up the boob lol. I think kids kinda decide on their when when they want to take them. Just keep trying and when her thirst starts to increase, she will drink from that sippy cup and be very happy about the better flow over a bottle lol.|`|JP2h62qiaa	I started my son off with a Nuk soft nipple sippy. It has a dark blue nipple similar to one on a bottle but it is shaped just like the sippy cup. It also has two handle on each side for baby to hold.<br>  It was an easier transition for him than hard plastic ones.|`|ntdGOZqGaa	6 months is when I had my son on a sippy durning the day he would get only a bottle before he went to bed and by the time he was 9 months completely off the bottle too.|`|01Mu3wUeaa	6 months.He easily adapts to things though so I didn't really have an issue there.

Also to the person that said that they would have told her something I laugh I would love for someone to tell me something like that about my kid I would be like here fine you take him BYE lol too funny what she would have thought if that happend I can be very vocal myself :)|`|45nSn7Rcaa	raise em right and there is no need to yell at them in public, but if for some reason you do have a need...what does it matter what others think...they think worse things if you ignore it and let your child have a fit all over the floor.|`|PxawVQ7Xaa	The funny thing they're trying to stop the child from making a scene and getting on people's nerves, when that's exactly what the parent is doing.|`|in7qi4oZaa	I believe that you can tell a child in a store to behave without screaming.|`|fNv2Re6baa	LOL, you musn't have kids. <br>  <br>  Sometimes kids need a good talking too and until you have kids, its hard to understand that you've gotten set them straight. If you only do that at home, it won't take them long to realise that they can get away with a lot more in public. <br>  <br>  You don' t know that the kid might have been hitting other shoppers, throwing grocery items around the isle or even being rude to their mother. If you don't tell a kid off, then they'll never learn that that's inappropriot. Yes, it's embarrasing for the kid and extremllly for the parent, however, try to see it from the mothers view. She could very well be managing a couple of kids, holding down a part-time job, doing the grocery shopping while she knows that when she goes home she has to hang out the washing, start dinner and vacuum.|`|BOia61xbaa	It is embarrassing for both the mom and the kid but anyone who stops to think about this is clearly not a parent. Yes, it is inappropriate and there are better ways to approach the situation but disciplining your uncooperative child while you're dealing with other things such as shopping, cooking, working, cleaning and driving at some point of the day you're going to run out of patience. Is it the best way? no, should you be judging other people whose lives you do not understand? no. Just move on and hope that when you have kids you get the patience of a saint and the stamina of an olympic champion, otherwise you'll yell some times too.|`|124377045ceac9826f76a176d439bd8faa	I think it is tacky to yell at kids in public, and counterproductive other places as well.<br>  <br>  I do agree with Kimberly that there is way too little spanking. Accordingly rather than yell I sometimes ask the stupid rhetorical question of whether they want a spanking--and if their behavior indicates the answer is yes--then they are told I owe them a spanking---which is redeemed once we get home.<br>  <br>  But those big scenes of parents yelling at a kid are just gross.|`|T3yDXW1Taa	yelling don't work<br>  <br>  as a 12 yr old i should know<br>  <br>  it just makes them upset...and sometimes suicidal...my friend slits her wrists because of verbal abuse<br>  <br>  physical abuse doesn't work either|`|ij5ivVUWaa	I tell my daughter to act right in public OR when we get home she will act next time around. But yelling is not the answer to everything.|`|sB5dyaczaa	My parents didn't care who was there, where we were, and what the people thought. If we acted up my parents didn't care. They pulled down our pants and spanked us right there right then.|`|VS78dqO9aa	What is wrong with this world today???<br>  <br>  Kids aren't getting spankings anymore.....|`|rBq189W1aa	I don't see a need for it.|`|on5NQxhkaa	I think you should speak firmly if they need to be displined. Its nice to see a parent take control of their kid when they are acting up. But it is super annoying when the parent is just sitting their screaming... I don't want to hear your child scream in public so what makes you think I want to hear YOU either? It's rude both ways.|`|DLJbkWPbaa	What ever happened to that old saying don't wash your dirty laundry in public... I tend to find yelling at kids a bit counter productive.|`|qtwhZnnVaa	I don't really get yelled at in public. My dad or mom just gives us, "the look." Then we know to knock it off or else.
HBgnkltfaa	Of those two, I prefer Jack Andrew.  Jamie feels a little bit too cutesy as a full given name; and since Jamie and Jordan are both unisex, the name skews a bit feminine.<br>  <br>  If you and your partner are having a hard time agreeing, how about a compromise?  James Andrew.  That way, the person who likes Jack Andrew still gets the traditional one-syllable first name and the favorite middle name.  And the person who likes Jamie Jordan could still call the son Jamie (as a nickname for James).|`|DhExpMlnaa	Jack Andrew Focker or Jamie Jordan Focker?<br>  Sorry, that's the first two syllables 'F' last name that came to my head.<br>  Personally, I like Jamie Jordan Focker.<br>  :]|`|OtqB24NVaa	Jack Andrew is the best<br>  <br>  Jamie is mostly used for girls these days but its unisex|`|9CAXUgOZaa	I like Jamie Andrew, to be honest. <br>  <br>  But I guess I'll go with Jamie Jordan, since I actually really like the name Jamie for boys, and the middle name hardly ever gets used.|`|gu1sEQN8aa	Definitley Jack Andrew, or even Andrew Jack.|`|y5sWmbtnaa	I dont like the double J unles of course you would call him JJ<br>  I suppose Jack Andrew (reminds me of president Andrew jackson)|`|y4ezT5y0aa	I prefer Jamie Jordan but then again my son is also called JJ. If he finds Jamie too cutesy when he's like 50 he can always call himself Jim or James. Good Luck x|`|18Weffunaa	I like Jamie Jordan better! orrr I like Jordan Andrew a lot too|`|6JOTtBSGaa	"Mother Of 5" You posted that on about 3 peoples things so far.. So from my heart my a s s.

cDVAEHgCaa	Well, I was planning to breastfeed, but due to difficulties, I had to use formula.  I had a can of Similac Advanced that I received as a sample in the mail, so I started my baby on that.  Then, when I got WIC, they gave me Enfamil Lipil.  That formula made my daughter constipated, gassy and fussy, so I did research on Enfamil Gentlease.  I decided to give it a try.  My daughter has been on it for 6 months and is doing quite well.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	she was on enfamil lipil; she got reflux realllly bad; so then for months she was on enfamil AR for reflux (has added rice starch to make it thicker and easier to keep down); now that she is 8 mos old she is back off the AR, that is the only time we have changed her formula except when she came home from the hospital, they weren't feeding her what i wanted, so we switched to the enfamil....we have never had any probs with the enfamil brands, i wouldn't want to try any others.....hth|`|pXSKSS3daa	Three.<br>  <br>  We started with Similac Advance(probably because it was given to us at the hospital), then went to Parent's Choice, and then to Parent's Choice Gentle. We then used that for about 4 months or so before switching back to regular Parent's Choice.|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	first i used the free cans of similic they sent me in the mail but i only used them when i was out because i breastfed <br>  and then when he started going to day care i switched because similic made him gassy and i was going to get WIC and the give u good start and so far no problems <br>  <br>  <br>  its only a couple more months hang in there|`|1tmX7xbRaa	i got really lucky. my daughter tolerated her formula very well and i never had to make changes. i am due with #2 in may and hope that it will be the same way. i do know a few people who have had to change their babies formula 3-4-5 times due to intolerance.|`|FplTPoAyaa	We had to change 3 times before settling on Nutramigen.  Luckily, it all happened while she was in the hospital and the doctors were right there, so when she had the reactions to the formula, she was in good hands (I am grateful for that).  Nutramigen is the most expensive formula on the market (that I am aware of) but she was able to tolerate it, and she did very well.  The good news for you is that your baby may very well outgrow his intolerance for milk.  My baby is now 14 months old and she drinks cow's milk.  She is a very healthy baby ! I hope your baby does well, too.  Good luck !|`|eRlNQxbNaa	I breastfed exclusively for the first three and a half months, but once we started him on formula we had to switch a few times.  First we had tried soy formula since I am not wild about giving a human baby milk meant for cow babies.  He got super duper constipated on that so we switched him to Isomil Advance, but I didn't like how much sugar was in that and he was spitting up quite frequently with that too.  Right now we are using Parent's Choice Organic which he tolerates very well.  I hope you find the right formula soon! I know how frustrating it can be... Good luck! :)|`|1dueLOdvaa	My oldest son only went through two formula's. He was on regular Enfamil Lipil in the beginning, but due to constipation he was switched to Enfamil Nutramagin and that's the one that worked for him.<br>  <br>  My youngest son was on Good Start to begin with then was switched to Enfamil Gentlease and then to Enfamil Lactofree due to colic.<br>  <br>  Ugh its a HUGE pain in the butt. I wish I could have breast fed, maybe it would've been easier.|`|EeGgovyCaa	the babies have had 4 different kind of formula. Luckily none of them bothered them. It was more of what we can afford this week. Short on money, we would get them the "Parent's Choice" brand. Need it quick but still don't have a lot of money, we'd get the "Baby" brand. <br>  <br>  Then sometimes as a gift from a family member, they would get us two cans of "Infamil" One that we can never afford.|`|5jjGo6XTaa	my daughter did the same thing i tried good start soy the blue can. try that is the regular kind makes him spit up and sick try soy kinds there is other soy formulas besides good start but thats what worked for me. also try to feed smaller amounts your child might just be getting to much.|`|48b2b41f5c4a3bc51bd8f89661550c98aa	My cousin and his wife changed their daughters formula 2 times.  They only changed it because they went on WIC and WIC no longer covers Enfimil formula.  With their son they changed it 2 times also.  They had to change it because he had acid reflux really bad.|`|2ZoUduoPaa	Each change was recommended and monitored by my pediatrician.<br>  We started on the breast, and that didn't work for us.  <br>  So our first formula was Similac Advance<br>  # 2.  Similac sensitive (because constant crying, though it may be lactose problem)<br>  # 3.  Similac Isomil (because of spitting up and gas problems)<br>  # 4.  Enfamil Nutramigen (because they thought she was colicky)<br>  Finally, when she wouldn't take the Enfamil Nutramigen, I put her back on the Isomil which she has seemed to be satisfied with.<br>  I have tried the Wal-Mart brand Parent's Choice formula equivalent to the Isomil, but she doesn't seem to care for it.<br>  <br>  After 4 formulas, we are finally happy.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Just to add:  I really wanted to breast feed.  But, if takes soy milk that was "meant for cow babies" to satisfy my little one, then I'm doing great because I'm providing for my little one!!!!!|`|XmO3nFSLaa	I feel you on this one...We went through 5, 2 kinds of regular, 2 kinds of soy, Lactosfree kind, then ending up with Sensitive RS. But my son still spit that up a lot more than normal...So finally at 10 months old I did what my mom said she had to do with me(went on whole milk at 5 months bc I was only 9 lbs, couldnt keep any formula down)  and switched him to whole milk!! That did the trick he has done great with it, only occasionally spitting it up. Good luck!! Hope this one works for you!<br>  <br>  Oh and you may want to try a different brand, my friend switched her child to Good start and that fixed her daughters issues....so if this doesnt work try a different brand!|`|b5eee7836be345dc0c629dc9caf5bd55aa	we tried good start at the hospital and the baby didn't eat more like like a tsp a feeding for the first 2 days. they switched her the night before we left to enfamil lipil and she has done really well on that. I know my friend who just had a baby switched 4 times and eventually ended up with prosobe which is about 50 dollars a can. holy cow. but whatever your baby will take is what you've got to do. just watch your little man while he's in transition from the last formula to this one<br>  <br>  good luck =]|`|MQp40L2gaa	I used similac right of the bat at first (after i had given breast feeding a try for 2 weeks) and then went to enfamil (we had coupons) then now im back to similac, and it seems to be working out great for my baby. But premature babys are different and there systems may need something different, so its better to contact your pediatrician or family dr. to find out what the best choice for him is.|`|Ifk1Mgdbaa	Isomil is soy so hopeful that will work for him,  my daughter was the same way but she would spit up chunks of mucus's with hers. and i'm allergic to milk to and when his older you might try 1% or 2% with him my daughter can't drink whole milk but she can 2%|`|IHZjwiNLaa	My son was spitting up everything he took in.

Its about $16.99 for a big can ( 25.75 oz) And he is now 9 months old and hasn't had any problems since we switched|`|r4E2zXL8aa	One. Similac Advance Early Shield.

You will not use enough force to harm the baby, and anyway - it would be really bad for the baby if the mom choked and died.|`|VJs1jZJ1aa	Thats so wierd you asked that. Im 33 weeks and i was wondering the same thing the other day. It was just a random thought, but its a good question. I googled it.. this is what i got:<br>  How to Perform a Modified Heimlich Maneuver on Pregnant Women<br>  Step1 Ask, "Are you choking?" Stay calm, and try to keep the victim calm as well. <br>  Step2 Point to a specific person and tell him to call 911. Instruct the person to tell the operator that someone is choking. Don't just call out for anyone to call 911, as bystanders may freeze or panic in emergency situations. <br>  Step3 Ask the victim whether she is pregnant, unless it is obvious. Using the standard Heimlich Maneuver can harm a fetus even in early stages of pregnancy, when the woman doesn't appear to be pregnant. <br>  Step4 Position yourself behind the choking woman. <br>  Step5 Lean the victim forward slightly and tilt her head downward, allowing gravity to help you dislodge the stuck food. <br>  Step6 Wrap your arms around the victim with your arms under her armpits. <br>  Step7 Make a fist with one hand. <br>  Step8 Place your fist with the thumb against the center of the victim's breastbone. <br>  Step9 Cover your fist with your other hand. <br>  Step10 Apply chest thrusts against the center of the woman's breastbone. Chest thrusts should be firm and move inward and downwards. <br>  Step11 Continue giving chest thrusts until the victim can breathe, medical help arrives or the woman loses consciousness. <br>  Step12 Cover the victim to keep her warm once the object is expelled, and stay with her until medical help arrives.|`|44ZMz0jfaa	Well I don't know the answer...but I felt it necessary to say to the person above me to SHOVE ITTTTT!!!!

It makes you feel like you have a rock in your gut and can be very sharp sometimes. The baby kicking the bottom is normal, she just hasn't flipped yet and to be honest it isn't time for her to flip. I mean, it is but its not too late for her to flip. Some babies don't flip around till the week they are ready to come out. You're doin great. When you have this pain try to just breath through it in shorter breaths because the more you expand your lungs the more it hurts. Don't hyperventilate though, that would not be good.|`|AI2VoFP4aa	sounds like contractions. at this point they should just be braxton hicks and therefore should not get closer together or worse. it just means your body is preparing for labor. and if the baby is kicking at the bottom i would be more worried about that, they have to be head down before they can come out vaginally|`|siWeuiTTaa	your almost there|`|j01zBZmZaa	Sorry, I don't think your little bambino is trying to come out just yet, that's just wishful thinking. I'm 34 weeks, and the baby is just running out of room to move around, so the pains are more intense for you now. Believe me, I feel your pain. Seems like my little man is trying to claw his way out. Babies are also more active at night, typically. When you're walking around it's as if you're rocking them to sleep. Once you're lying down they aren't quite as lulled and think it's play time! Good luck!|`|8IWwoV5baa	You might be having contractions already.  Or, it could be just stress pains from laying down at night.  And, the baby kicking doesn't necessarily mean that he/she is ready to come out.  Try soothing the baby, and talking to him/her.  Just your voice can make the baby calm down.  If things keep going on for more than say 3-5 days, I'd check with your doctor though.  You never know what might be going on, and it's always better to ask & maybe even find out it something small, rather than not ask & find out later on that something serious was happening, ya know?<br>  <br>  Good luck!<3|`|ym8q6wBnaa	I would say you dont have anything to worry about. Try shifting positions when the baby is kicking you. Since your almost at the end the baby is just becomming more active and so its just a bit more painful for you.

2B2fgmw9aa	They say in the fifth month....but continue to talk to your little one everyday...I know my hubby does!! Just wait until the little one gets bigger and more developed and you can lay your head on the belly and get kicks in response to your talking, lol|`|Kz5Fb0mPaa	I am thinking they can start hearing at 16-18 weeks; however, they do not recognize voices until around 20 weeks!<br>  <br>  I wouldnt let that stop you from talking to the baby. I started talking to mine as soon as I found out I was pregnant!!|`|5RvTXdmUaa	I think it's around 19-21 weeks. Can't hurt to do it now though, it's sweet that you care.<br>  Congrats to both of you|`|AI2VoFP4aa	look at babycenter.com it tells you every week what your baby is growing and how its developing,|`|c612db5f7eaf689dc523cb1c679189e1aa	I have heard 16weeks and i have heard 22weeks...im not totally positive but i know its in the second trimester at least
b3XSnPXBaa	Hi there, I'm now 9 weeks and about a week and half ago, I had the same thing, not nice but apparently normal.  It's just your tummy is a bit upset due to all the things going on.  I also have a very achy back.  Make sure you drink lots and lots of water to keep you hydrated and I'm sure you'll be fine till Monday.  Just keep an eye on things hun.  Since I've hit 9 weeks my symptoms have got 10 times worse, I can't believe the difference, I thought I was bad a week ago!  All in the name of a gorgeous baby at the end tho eh!  And we all worry, really, it's completely normal.  Look after yourself. x|`|8LBl7HgAaa	Hey! Im due October 24th too! yay! Congrats, I think that it's normal because my back is killing me too, I dont know about the diarrhea though, you should ask your doc.|`|44ZMz0jfaa	Back pain and diarrhea are normal I think.....idk...I would call your doc just to be safe!|`|HFRP1Qzgaa	yeah i got the same at the start of my pregnancy go 2 ur dr and they will tell u why oh and congrats x|`|1Dv1Hx0yaa	you should be fine... you need to call the doc I had the same thing right before I miscarried. But my best friend had this a lot with her 3rd and 4th children and the kids are fine. it just depends on your body. Keep taking fluids and eat more potassium (Bananas) that will help with the aches and pains a bit and baby tylenol to take the edge off. <br>  Also try a massage to help with the back and very possibly your nerves too. <br>  Best Luck.|`|d24da37e966f8d4ae102c19a841a1aecaa	ANYTHING THAT YOU WORRY ABOUT YOU SHOULD CALL YOUR DOCTOR AND AT LEAST TALK TO A NURSE THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO LET YOU KNOW IF YOU NEED TO BE SEEN OR WHAT YOU CAN DO OR TAKE FOR THE SYMPTOMS YOU ARE HAVING|`|YAiKlPkMaa	Yes, diarrhea is common and so is a lot of gas, I don't know why though.|`|QMxEjCpiaa	You might have come down with a virus or something. Have you gone to see your doctor? I would call him/her to make sure you are getting enough fluids. Dehydration is not good for you or the baby.
hUbETXKpaa	yes I'm sure that would be possible.often its not a case of either of you being infertile but it can be that two people aren't genetically suited.iv read that some DNA and blood types dont produce children as well.you may have conceived but lost the embryo in your menstrual cycle without even realising it this can happen when the developing embryo has a serious fault. have the tests that way when you meet a nice man you want to marry you can both make an educated decision on whether you want children rather than trying for 5 years with no luck. good luck for the future.|`|Ur9dwWRraa	Yes you can ask your GP for tests. I don't know why you have put the details about your daughter's birth as it's irrelavent to your fertility.
HOdblqIkaa	both arent the best but its really the fumes in the salon that can be dangerous. i dont think its too bad if you arent going there all the time. one of the ladies at the place i used to get mine done worked there for most of her pregnancy but she wore a face mask and sat the closest to the door and had a fan going at all times. it would probably take less time to get them filled then having them removed so i would say just get it done but be careful as to where you sit.|`|KYvlD9o9aa	Sweetheart, fills are fine. Try if you can, to make an appointment in advance so that you are not breathing all the fumes while waiting but it is perfectly fine. Pregnant women work doing nails while pregnant so the small amount of time it takes u to get a fill will do no damage. Do anything you can to feel beautiful while pregnant because for some people they start to feel fat and unattractive. Congrats on ur baby and get them nails done girl cuz i imagine they look bad after 9 weeks with no fill lol!!|`|fWAzJIEkaa	Hey!<br>  <br>  My friend had her nails done all throughout her pregnancy, and it was fine.She only had to have them removed just before giving birth, as the hospital dont want any nailpolish etc.<br>  I know i am going to have mine done, unless doctors states otherwise =) xx|`|dn2UCOkqaa	Fake nails AREN'T safe while pregnant. Whats wrong with your REAL ones!?????|`|RPoFBenJaa	omg just fill them. Just cover your nose. OR, what I did was found a salon that had one of those fan things that circulates the air. You could also ask them to crack a window or crack the door. I don't know where you live but its worth a shot. I had mine filled alllll  the way throughout my pregnancy and my TWO kids are fine.|`|AI2VoFP4aa	you arent supposed to be exposed to chemical fumes during pregnancy especially in the first trimester you could miscarry or cause brain damage in the fetus. after the first trimester they still dont recommend it because noone is sure how many of those chemicals can be absorbed through your skin and affect the baby through your blood stream.|`|fUK9y3Qkaa	It's the fumes you have to worry about. U dont want to inhale to much of that stuff ya know. U can go to like riteaid or walgreens and get some of those mask to put over your nose and mouth. And wear it while you get your nails done so u wont be taking in all that bad stuff.|`|faPKwClPaa	You're fine -- get 'em done!<br>  <br>  The only thing to watch for is the fumes.  They don't do anything or any harm to the fetus, they're just hard to handle for some pregnant women.  Some gag just standing near the door, others are fine.  So, just keep that in mind and maybe try to go early, you know, before the fumes get real bad.|`|b17cb0e70d1cd57271e4ba763c7fbc30aa	Its the fumes in those nail salons you have to worry about. I think the only way I'd go into one of those places pregnant if if I had a mask and the room was well ventilated, otherwise I wouldn't risk it.
MR9iBgafaa	There's no reason why you can't have it.  Any ultrasound, whether 2 or 3D can be harmful if used excessively.  This includes the ultrasound foetal dopplers at home (the non-ultrasound ones are fine).<br>  <br>  Even if you were to have a at-home ultrasound, it's supposed to be limited to once a week, purely because they don't know the possible side effects. There's nothing proven, but it's not proven safe either.<br>  <br>  I had a 3D scan when I was 20 weeks pregnant to discover the sex, and she's a perfectly healthy baby.|`|uuHPneEcaa	i did it. any type of radiation to the body isn't good. <br>  <br>  U can see the baby a lot clearer I think. but its totally up to u. we can't make that decision for u.. and I know that ur doctor won't recomind something that isn't good for ur baby.|`|AA11920812	There isn`t proof either way. I had one doctor err on the side of caution and asked me not to. Said they were harmful. My obgyn said there is no proof do whatever you want - but don`t go to some shady mobile home and get it done, lmao. He was a character ;P<br>  <br>  I had a friend who got one done at a mall somwhere. Her daughter turned out just fine :) I do know a couple hospitals here have them. However, you have to travel about 30 miles north to the next big city. And, have a perscription. Its hard to get one by a doc unless there is a need. But, if you have a cool doc he could manage it for you...if you are worried about the person not being an actual radiologist/sonographer. <--- Which is why most docs advise against them, the person using the equipment has not been educated or trained like a sonographer at the hospital. Therefore, making them unsafe.|`|fHgbL046aa	I have never heard that 3D scans could be harmful. If that is the case what about regular ultra sounds. Its totally up to you. If I could I would go for it. I would love to see what my baby looks like and the 3D scans are perfect.|`|gKW1ufGbaa	My doctor advises against them. I don't know why though. I'm guessing it's medical. I think they are freaky. The babies always look really weird. I wouldn't do it.|`|RR7UX4jkaa	There is no documented proof of that. Only theories|`|5RvTXdmUaa	If they were harmful, it wouldn't be legal to do them. Your doctor probably doesn't want you to have it done because if something showed up as being wrong with the baby, it could cause un-necessary panic and worry. Because the people doing these scans are sometimes not as well trained. But 3d scans are not proven to cause any damage and are relatively safe. I'm having one done in 2 weeks and am very excited. I think it's a great opportunity to bond with your little one. !!<br>  Have fun.|`|POs5TeUDaa	im 22 weeks and im at high risk. during my 17th week - 21 week i had a bunch of ultrasounds done due to complications, 21st week was the worst, i had ultrasounds 3 times a week and i had the doppler (or whatever u call it to listen to the heart beat) done for almost a full day because i was hospitalized ):. <br>  <br>  anyway, i asked the doctors and she said they're sound waves so they're harmless. its only dangerous if u do it on a daily basis, like everyday for hours straight, etc..|`|7fPuUT3Daa	Well i didn't do it with my son and im not going to with my current pregnancy(22 weeks)  i think they take away some of the surprise. I stick with the normal 2d just so they can see if all is well. but if your worried i wouldn't do it. if there is ever anything wrong you would prob jump to blame that. Best Luck|`|2B2fgmw9aa	There's no proof either way about the 3d scans. I had to have one done on my baby's heart a couple weeks ago and they took some pics of her face and it was the weirdest thing!! But she looks like me already!

LTTips1vaa	First off everyone is different and you could very easily delivery vaginally.  Second by inducing labor this increases you risk for cesarean birth.   Cesarean births are considered higher risk of danger due to being a surgery and longer recovery period plus longer hospital stay.  We went to 41wks with my first and 41.3 with second.  Basically im saying there is no rush.  The doc knows what to watch for signs of trouble (infant heart rate, high blood pressure, sugars in the urine, etc).<br>  <br>  Instead of thinking about scheduled cesarean you should be thinking about ways to help progress your labor. Start walking for 20-30 min daily, have sex, spicy foods, etc.|`|HM0cxcahaa	Depends what country you are in, most doctors only do c sections in my country when there is an emergency or a confirmed health problem, remember you are one set of genes from your mum and one set from your dad so it may not happen to you.<br>  <br>  Usually doctors dont induce until you are 41 weeks pregnant as your dates are only indicative... <br>  <br>  Talk to you doc none the less, but a C section is harder to recover from.|`|y5sWmbtnaa	I advise thinking carefully about this choice. your doctor will do it most likely as cesarean can be elected.<br>  How ever it limits your chance of a vaginal birth should you decide you didn't like the c-section and want to birth vaginally next time. The healing process is rougher and I know that breast feeding can make the contractions you have after birth more painful as your uterus has be cut open.|`|Ihfq3Ih5aa	If there is no valid medical concern in YOUR pregnancy, not your mothers, not your grandmothers, YOUR pregnancy, then the chances of having one 'just because', are pretty much nil.|`|AA12047432	I don't think your dr. will schedule you for a cesarian just because you want one but he might just induce you ask it won't hurt to ask.|`|ra7sU4mMaa	I live in the state of Virginia in the united states, and they give you the option of how you want to deliver your  baby as long as you can pay for it or your insurance will pay. waterbirth c section  vaginal. My sister had hers by c section by choice just because she was afraid of how it was gonna feel coming out. It all really depends talk to your midwife and see what is right for you . If you can afford it they wont complain or at least that is what i learned over the years . I am not sure about other states though.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Doctor's usually won't let you choose elective C-Section unless medically necessary. It's a major surgery and comes with many many possible complications. Your mother's experiences usually mean nothing. Complications are not genetic most of the time.|`|xtmFBjO9aa	I dont think they will schedule a cesarean unless there are certain definate indicators that vaginal labor would harm either you or the baby.  Cant hurt to ask though.  The worst that can happen is he tell you no.

Good luck!|`|Do0pmMcfaa	wat|`|gvLjbVFJaa	There isn't much that you can do at that age, aside from making sure that he isn't wet and has a bottle on hand.

Do a blood test if you want to be 100% sure.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/1178393/family_history_can_be_a_guide_to_your.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.associatedcontent.com/article...</a>|`|8259f37f3bb63217d47d975af43b7855aa	They are very accurate.    You can test as early as 4 days before your period is due.  I found out I was pregnant, but I miscarried.  It's been a year, and  I'm ready to try again.  You can also order online.  The place I ordered mine through only charged .60 per test for 10 tests which totalled $6.00, plus $1.99 for S&H.  That's better than paying the $1 plus tax at the store.  The .60 pg tests are for the strip test, then it's .90 for the cassettes, which are the ones in the dollar store I think.   But yes, if the Control Line shows up, then the test is working properly.<br>  <br>  By the way, you can get a false positive.  See the link below.  It can be caused from the container you collect your urine in not being clean, blood in your urine due to a bladder infection, and some prescription drugs can cause a false positive as well.|`|yM9rg43Yaa	You have to remember one thing about pregnancy tests...you can never have a false positive, only a false negative. If you tested negative and you think you may be pregnant try again in 3-5 days. If you tested positive then you are. Pregnancy tests from the dollar store are fine.|`|EwvZCLkjaa	about as accurate as most other tests<br>  it turns out there is not much of a difference besides price between most pregnancy tests, i say get like three to be sure though|`|Agw4pXAnaa	I haven't ever used one from there, but I've used the generic Wal-Mart brand and the name brands, all works well.  I think you would be find to use one from there.|`|LTTips1vaa	They are all 99.9% accurate no matter where you buy them!|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Very! I tested 4 days before my period was due and got an accurate result. The test also detects the lowest amount that an over the counter test allows. They are also FDA approved. If they weren't they would not be allowed to sell them. All pregnancy tests, no matter how cheap, are accurate. The only differences are packaging, cost, and how much hormone they can detect. Most tests now a days will allow a woman to test accurately by the day her period is due.|`|xtmFBjO9aa	Those tests are just as accurate as the expensive ones.  I bought like 4 and took one 6 days prior to my period.

There already is a legal driving age.. its 16.<br>  <br>  I dont think it should be lowered.. there's no reason for young kids to be driving.

Driving does often include fast decision making skills, as well as the hand/eye and leg coordination to operate the vehicle.<br>  <br>  If anything, I think the age should be raised to 18.

When you're not coughing, do you find yourself clearing your throat a lot?  I am 18 weeks, and asked my OB about my cough (same as yours--gets worse at night).

The only thing that I can suggest is try a different one and to be on the safe side I was told to take childrens cough meds. If that doesn't work on Monday call your dr and ask for a prescription. Also try sucking on a mint or something of the sort. Hope you feel better!!! Oh and avoid all dairy!

The milk can contribute to chest mucus build up... Therefore intensifying your cough!|`|FUkZSoVGaa	try mixing some HOT tea with lemon and honey.  it worked for me when I was pregnant.  :)|`|khSCs1rbaa	This method works for my 6 yo son who coughed a lot esp during sleep time. I told a few friends whose kids had the same problems & it worked for them too<br>  <br>  Rub Vicks Vapour Rub on soles of your feet & then put on thick socks before going to bed. I hope this will work for you & good luck|`|GZRHJBT7aa	try eating some chocolate. like a hershey bar or something like that. chocolate has something in it that cures coughs. But whatever you do, do not drink milk. That makes it worse. The caffeine in chocolate is very low so don't worry about that. It is fine in moderation. You could also try honey and lemon. Also try decaf. hot tea. and just keep hydrating. drink lots of water.
285e8b302bc60e4817f5d45c744bdcfeaa	It Could be one of two things. The first could be that you are so early, that the scan isn't picking the embryo up. Secondly, you could of had an early miscarriage which is very common. The sharp pain and back pain could be associated with the miscarriage. I would give your doctor a call, and see if she wants a follow up.|`|jzAfst8Taa	you could be having an etopic pregnancy which could be dangerous you need to go back to the doctor
7RUqEJzLaa	A week before I get really mood and well I guess you can say my boobs get really, really sore. Then 2 days before I get it I have sharp pains in my stomach from time to time.|`|Lftu0e4Daa	I tend to get a little crampy 1-2 days before and my face begins to breakout a little bit like a week before. It sucks but since I monitor my periods, i know when around they should be coming and I take extra care of my skin around that time.|`|6AvVVzsnaa	Cramps.|`|rsYbDHWRaa	well for me, about a week before i get really moody and easily irritated and crave chocolate. then the day before i feel extremely nauseous and get cramps. <br>  <br>  but everyones different, so this might not apply to you.|`|hPagd7N2aa	Nothing happens to me. It just happens, I don't get angry easily or anything. I don't even get stomach cramps majority of the time and that's before and during it. Strange....|`|kc2Sa7ibaa	A week before I get mine I get angry and cry at nothing and get bad stomach cramps. lol|`|WSwkPljYaa	I get cramps the day before I get mine.
s4LWmcTjaa	As Des said, talk is cheap.  When you can match your walk with your talk, you've got it down good :)<br>  <br>  It's so much easier to know the solution to the problems in your mind.  In your mind, you control the outcome.  In real life, you don't have the control over that.  That's just life.  It's always harder to apply it to yourself than it is to advise others on how to handle situations of their own.<br>  <br>  What I get out of giving someone else advice is that I have given the best help that I can to encourage another person.  If I can help or at least say something encouraging, I find satisfaction in that.<br>  <br>  *I also find a lot of truth in Maureen's answer.  Good point :)|`|cAtWxJG1aa	because talk is cheap -- and it's easier to see when someone else is making a mistake than when we ourselves are.|`|7SCjPftKaa	Of course it's easier to give advice. Emotionally, we are detached from the situation so we are able to give a balanced and unbiased solution. We might know that, for instance, a woman's husband beats her and we would thus advise her to run away. But, as we are not the woman herself, we will choose to override the fact that she is desperately in love with her husband, when it would be far more difficult for her herself to do this. <br>  <br>  We, as advice givers, don't know every single complexity of the situation, either, so it may appear more simple. <br>  <br>  For the person in the situation, it is more often than not a struggle between the heart and the head. For the answerer, it's based on hard fact. <br>  <br>  I don't know what everyone else gets out of answering questions, but I know that I enjoy the satisfaction of weighing up a situation and making a solid judgment on what should be done. I like the idea of people who need help listening to my opinion and acting on it, and I always hope that it will help them or that they may find some comfort in it. I also find that I have learnt an awful lot from joining yahoo answers because I always research any information that I am not completely sure on. Sometimes I research answers that I wouldn't have known at all before and so I, too, benefit.|`|faPKwClPaa	Absolutely, if only for the old adage of, "Easier said than done."  <br>  <br>  It takes nothing to (for example) tell someone they need to work on their marriage.  However, the actual work that goes into that (counseling, introspection, admitting faults, etc.) is emotionally, physically, and sometimes financially exhausting.|`|1tmX7xbRaa	because things are always easier said then done. i can give my opinion and my thoughts a million times over to other people but when it actually comes to applying it to my own life it's very difficult. the most simple explanation is it's easier said then done.|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	You give advice from experiences and information that you already have.<br>  <br>  You solve your own problems by going out and researching and experiencing that which you don't yet know, with an unknowable outcome.|`|6VbNJOtfaa	That is so true!  I would take anyones problems and solve them in a day, but mine (and most are small probs) seem to be mind boggling to me and beyond my control.  I attribute this to being outside of the situation.  I can tell you all day that you should leave your man because he is no good, but at the same time try to work things out with my man (who is just as no good) over and over again.  Being on the outside makes the problem seem simple.  No emotions are involved, just rationality.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	well for as young as i am id say ive been there and worn the t shirt on a few things so i like to pass my wisdom on lol alot of stuff ie single parenting baby daddy drama i can relate too. ive leatned alot from that alone and think its nice to help people in similar situations...so they dont feel alone etc. i think alot of people like to give advice on things but struggle with there own so i guess its just easier to be in denial for some people? and people that have been through it in a way can see the bigger picture. when you have a problem its easy to brush it under the carpet and shrug things off...so hering someones opinion can often give you a wake up call.!|`|wphLaVs6aa	I think we put up obstacles for ourselves so solving our own problems is harder than it needs to be. I can come up with a hundred reasons why I can't do something, but usually, all of the reasons are just excuses.|`|prqrQcd1aa	Good point.. I am able to give advice some times due to the fact that i've solved my own problems that are contained with in the question...other times people are just looking for advice so I give it to the best of my ability.. Isn't that what we all do (mainly).|`|pT7jrsAgaa	I believe it's because in our own situation we are usually too close to see the an easy solution to our problems vs seeing someone elses and saying, "Well this is what I would do in that situation.".|`|7wsYl1Gjaa	Yes.  It's because it's alot easier said than done.  By giving other people advice we feel that we are wise or something, especially if the advice works.|`|AA12225723	We have to live with our own problems but when giving advice you can leave it behind, thats another persons problems.|`|jsdDgIuRaa	Short answer: yes it is|`|z0ro3VkJaa	Much much easier.<br>  <br>  I coach speed skating, because I know all about what makes someone fast. However, the kids I coach are as fast or faster than I ever was, because knowing the answer doesn't mean I can do it.<br>  <br>  I have answered questions about relationships matter of factly in ways people found helpful, despite suffering from the exact same problems myself. Knowing the answer doesn't mean I can do it myself.<br>  <br>  It is really easy to answer, because the question is right there. They tell you their problem, you tell them your solution. However, in our own lives, we usually delude ourselves as to what exactly the problem is, and can't apply the solution properly.|`|zERIAYmQaa	It is much easier to give advise because you can look at the whole situation without becomming emotionally involved. When the problem is yours your FEELINGS can cloud up your logic.|`|w3jR1OIMaa	It's easier to give advice because people think they know every thing and don't want to face the truth plus giving advice makes you feel wise not in a funny old way but in a good way.|`|LwbwMFX9aa	i dont really take anyones advice ( except one time ) i know what needs to be done as a parent

All'inizio rimarranno un pò spiazzati, perchè gli amici pretendono di saper sempre tutto dei propri amici ma se ti vogliono bene non cambierà nulla, continueranno a vederti e a comportarsi con te come hanno sempre fatto e poi se sono dei veri amici chi ti dice che una piccola lampadina non si sia accesa nella loro mente e non ti abbiano detto nulla per discrezione?

Consuming too much water can put babies at risk of a potentially life-threatening condition known as water intoxication. Drinking water lowers your sodium in your brain. If an infants sodium gets to low it can cause seizures. The only reason to give a child water that is under 6 months of age would be for constipation.

bf8lx9gxaa	I'm pretty positive you're pregnant. Sometimes pregnancy tests can't detect pregnancy right away. The only sure way is to go to the doctor for a blood test. I know you really want to see a positive on a home pregnancy test because that's so much more exciting. But if you keep getting negatives, I'd just go to the doctor.

AA10315542	I am sorry for your loss.  The same thing happened to me, I had a D&C on Oct 31 last year.  My doctor wanted me to wait 3 months to conceive again but I was pregnant after about a month and a half.  <br>  <br>  As for sex, my doc told me to wait 10-14 days.<br>  <br>  Good luck on your next try.|`|VHHis05Naa	I would wait a cycle.   Wait until you get your period and then go from there.  Your body needs rest from this.  I conceived my daughter two cycles after my miscarriage.   I did not have a D&C, though, so it may be different.<br>  <br>  Wanted to add and can't believe I forgot, I'm so sorry for your loss.  :(|`|cj7sSPZEaa	Wait at least until you have a normal cycle again to have sex or to try and conceive again to give your body time to heal.  Get the ok from your doctor first, though.  Ask about it at your follow up appointment.    I am sorry for your loss.|`|1Dv1Hx0yaa	u should have been scheduled for a follow up for a week later. if they didn't schedule one you need to call. usually after the follow up (about a week) you can have sex again, but i suggest using a condom just in case your cervix isn't completely closed, this will avoid infection or possible pregnancy too soon after such a traumatic experience. let your body heal a few months before trying again. Just my advice from the same experience. Take care and good luck.|`|RR7UX4jkaa	LISTEN!<br>  My wife m/c at 9 weeks and after everything passed ,she conceived again only 2 weeks after m/c and she is now 14 weeks!!!!<br>  Yep just 2 weeks<br>  Some docs say wait and other say it doesn't matter<br>  We still made love and just figured if it happens it happens and it did and doc say baby is healthy and heart beat looks good. remember with pregnancy anything is possible.|`|f9lZK2aKaa	I am very sorry to hear of your loss, you are in my prayers. I would call the doctor and ask the nurse any questions you may have. Believe me, I think I have made my OB's nurse blush over the phone. lol Seriously better ask for your own peace of mind. You will make a wonderful mom.<br>  God Bless!
mqvxIgRdaa	ok i have some ideas that worked for me. Have a play group once a week where kids come over other peoples house one week a month its your turn the others you free without the 2 yr old and while the 11month old is asleep you can shower read a book take a nap,idea#2_ your husband might be at work but I dont care work is like play compared to 2 kids at home make him watchthem atleast 3 times aweek while you go out to get your nails done or even for a drive/walk.idea#3_tell the 2 year old to take a shower with you while the baby is asleep idea#4 have family or friends take care of them just for a while your husband really needs to help out|`|Ifk1Mgdbaa	close your eyes take a deep breath and blow it out  you are just like most moms over whemled with everyday life, you need to talk to your husband and demand a my day, where he is the only one to take care of the kids, and you need to go to bathroom, close the door, light some candles turn on some soft music, fill the tub with warm water and bubbles and relax,  my friend gave me this when i got over whemled and didn't know what to do, <br>  <br>  A Mothers Prayer<br>  <br>  Dear Lord, its such a hectic day,<br>  With little time to stop and pray,<br>  For life's been anything but calm,<br>  Since you called me to be a mom,<br>  <br>  Running errands, matching blocks,<br>  Cooking,cleaning and finding shoes,<br>  And all those things that young ones lose,<br>  <br>  Fitting lids on bottled bugs,<br>  A stack of last weeks mail to read,<br>  So where's the quiet time I need?<br>  <br>  Yes, as I got to bed each night,<br>  My heart is filled with true love's light,<br>  As I take one last peek, I see,<br>  <br>  This treasure you have given to me,<br>  God's own sweet blessing sleeping there,<br>  The answer to a mother's prayer.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  take a minute go to your kids, look at them and remember that smile, the laugh and know that one day the will be all grown up and won't need you as much, but they will still need you,  and from a mom with a 11 year old and a 3 year old your going to miss it promise|`|n6XYYyoLaa	do u have anyone, friend, fam, neighbor, anyone that can give you and hour or two break? i would suggest going to a psychiatrist even if you have to take them with you....happy babies need happy moms and dads; and you shouldn't have to feel this way, it doesn't appear the zoloft is working for you.....good luck! i know you hub is tired, but he can watch them for ten or fifteen mins while you take a shower, that is not unreasonable in the least! if you have to hire a babysitter to go to the doc, but go!!|`|vOomJtbsaa	Awww my heart goes out to you!  You really need to see someone immediately about this, even if it means hiring a sitter for a few hours to do so.  Zoloft may just not be working for you and it may be making you all the more drowsy.  Give yourself a 10 minute break if you can, bring the babies into the bathroom with you, let them play on their play mat or bouncer or even on a blanket on the floor with a few toys while you soak in a hot tub.  That way you have a moment to just refresh yourself.  Is there anyone you can call on to help you, friends or family?!  If you must, pay a sitter to come over while you nap for a few hours a couple times a week.  But you do need to be seen by a therapist/psychiatrist so that you can get some help to pull you out of this.... it may not just be PPD, it could be a chemical imbalance, or many other issues.  Talk to someone about and right now, remember this too shall pass!  Good luck sweetie!|`|3RFu4W38aa	I understand how you feel, to a degree. I agree that you certainly need someone's help. You should try sitting your husband down and explaining how you are feeling and ask him to take a bigger role with the children; parenting isn't a one-man job. Also, look into state programs or other programs in your area to get help, and make sure you get that follow-up appointment. Your doctor needs to know if the meds are working or not.|`|FLpMShKNaa	Poor thing. You have just got to get some help NOW, no matter what. Its sounds like you love your children, but you are hanging by a really narrow thread-the fact you have had awful thoughts causes concern for you and your babies. Please, Please, contact your doctor right away. Ask a friend or relative to help, or implore husband to take a personal day, your long term well being is much more important than anything else. This is clearly a cry for help, go get it for the sake of your family.|`|XmO3nFSLaa	PRAY!! God can help with anything you are going through...HE never gives you more than you can handle....Ask your husband to watch your kids one night soon when he gets off and you go relax in the tub....Find someone who can watch them for you, like once a week if you need to....The number 1 thing is get them on a schedule to nap at the same time everyday and those 2 hours can be all for you to shower, relax whatever you need to do...that is the best idea of all...Talk to your husband, tell him you are overwhelmed and need a break, then he will know he needs to keep them while you regroup....maybe even 30 mins a day after he gets home you can sit in your room and relax...it might help...Say some prayers and talk to you husband!!|`|ntdGOZqGaa	You need to take the time out to go see a doctor. And it sounds like you do need a break, but when you feel like you are going to pull your hair out just walk out of the room for 5 mins then come back in and deal with the kids when you are more calm and not so stressed. Trust me all women go through that at one point or another maybe go in your room put a pillow over your mouth and scream lol I'm not making fun but it has helped me a time or two lol just take deep breaths and try not to let yourself get to that point again. Dont be afraid to ask for help, its better to get help or ask for it before something happens and you will regret it. good luck

In fact, it would probably be safer for him to eat apple slices instead of holding the whole thing.  Just watch him closely.|`|jwIdq5qkaa	Take a very sharp knife and cut the core out until you get somethign that will cut the core out. Its not good for him to eat core and seeds and all.|`|LaUouVtfaa	No, is he eats too many apple cores it's dangerous because there is cyanide in them.|`|XmO3nFSLaa	you should cut the core out before giving it to him or take it once he has reached the core...not something he should eat!<br>  All kids do it here and there but he really shouldnt do it everytime!|`|nkSRIq0Iaa	HAHA, I have the same problem. My daughter loveloveloves bananas, peel and all.<br>  <br>  It's kind of dangerous though, because he can choke on the core/seeds. Highly unlikely, but possible. Also I just googled, and it said that the seeds carry trace amounts of poisons but less than is legally allowed in municipal drinking water.<br>  <br>  If you are concerned about him eating the whole apple, buy an apple corer. They're cheap and easy to use. Even though we all know peace of mind is priceless!|`|MAh2yKFnaa	it is fine so far as eating something the seeds will likely end up in a potty or diaper the core will be digested. I think as long as you are there being sure he doesn't choke he is fine.|`|TIrftbTWaa	i did that all the time when i was little and im fine...animals do it too.<br>   you have nothing to worry about.|`|0nZrPxPeaa	Definitely remove the core.

1enIWBGnaa	Most toddlers will start saying simple words, like 'mom', at age 12-months.  It sounds like this is your opportunity to get him talking even more.  Buy some flash cards; alphabet letters, numbers, shapes and colors - work with him on these and make him repeat each plainly and clearly.  Also, go to your nearest library and get him 'turned onto books'.  Read a book to him, point to a simple word (the, and, or...) and every time you come to the word - make him say it.  As he becomes more familiar with words then make him repeat more.  The more you help him now - the easier it will be when he begins school.|`|yAVKWvDMaa	Some kids talk earlier than that.

And, if you have a conscience, that feeling never goes away entirely.|`|AA11317789	There are a few different methods.<br>  <br>  In very early stages of pregnancy, the abortion pills can be taken, known as a medical abortion, and they will expel the embryo.<br>  <br>  There is aspiration abortion, in which the fetus is sucked away from the uterine wall with a sort of vacuum.<br>  <br>  However, the ones in the pictures you posted look like later-stage abortions that were done using D & C (dilation and cutterage) and in this method they... oh my.. reach in and literally dismember the fetus and pull it out in pieces. They will then usually reassemble the parts to make sure they got it all. <br>  <br>  Late stage abortions like that are far less common in the States nowadays, although the first two methods I mentioned are still widely practiced.<br>  <br>  The last method I can think of is partial-birth abortion. This is done in the last stages of pregnancy for god knows what reasons.. I can't imagine. The doctor kills the baby either in utero using a saline solution, a heart stopping drug or he will deliver all of the baby except for the head and use forceps to pithe the brain. I believe George Bush has outlawed this practice. <br>  <br>  Here are a couple of good videos that tell you more about the methods used: <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=us_y9GP_-DA" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=us_y9GP_-...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBOAPleF1t0" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBOAPleF1...</a><br>  <br>  There are some others that this guy does.|`|AA12041097	They do a D&C, which is dilation and curretage (sp?), which is basically scraping out the uterus with a medical instrument rather like a spade.  D&Cs are also done for other medical reasons.  Or they vacuum it out.  It would depend on the number of weeks into your pregnancy.  They do *not* use anything like a coat hanger!  No one should ever try self aborting with anything.|`|t7OPDZDXaa	there's a movie/documentary called Silent Scream. Maybe google that or see if you can watch it on youtube
HpWCjBv6aa	She was right - you were her only real friend.  The other friends who tell you to "stop changing her" or stop telling her to stop cutting (wtf!) are not real friends, they are losers, and she is slowly following in their footsteps.<br>  <br>  Sit her down and talk to her.  Explain that you're not trying to change her, but you just have her best interests at heart.  She is obviously really important to you, but you need to explain that you are not interested in drugs and alcohol, and especially not sex at your age, and if she can't respect that (and at the very least, not talk about that around you) then you just can't be in her life right now.|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	You did the absolute right thing!!!<br>  <br>  I am being emphatic because, she was basically asking you to approve of her bad behavior.|`|BrNhLZroaa	i dont think you did anything wrong.. and its true you were apparently her only real friend since none of the other ppl she called friends didnt care about her or that she was hurting herself. so maybe shell eventually realize that you were only looking out for her and if not then oh well she lost a good friend. i wouldnt worry about it.. you did nothing bad or mean to her.|`|AA12069058	No sweetie, you are right.

Good Luck?|`|XrKviWgSaa	in my mind you did nothing wrong, you were trying to look out for your friend because you knew that this new guy would just get her into trouble and you do not want to see your friend the way she is because you know its not who she really is.|`|jgebtbdIaa	You did absolutely nothing wrong, all she needed was the comfort that you should have givin her saying that you were always gunna be there. It was a good thing that you tried to get her into a different path, rather than keeping her on the one she was heading on. If you guys have been best friends for 5-6 years... you guys are gunna be getting into arguements like this, its just the way life goes. You basically showed her that you cared, by telling her not to do the things she was getting into, and to me, thats a good friend... its like you were watching out for her. She should be grateful for what you tried to do.. and if not, then tough for her cuz all you did was care!

I'm wondering if you have sat down and really spoken to her. Bed wetting can be due to a medical condition or a sign that something is wrong. Have you spoken with her doctor?

I just want to give you some suggestions because 12 can be a difficult age with puberty about to set in and all. My niece wet the bed for many years and she said it was cause she was afraid to go to the bathroom at night and come to find out she was being abused sexually. I don't want to scare you but just dig deep into all the possibilities. If she is just doing it to do it, she will stop. Buy her those goodnites diapers for big kids and if they don't have her size, buy her some depends diapers. She won't like that very much and will most likely stop. Good luck.|`|wXaGIPSPaa	If your preteen is still wetting his bed at night, don't despair. Plenty of his classmates are doing the same. Bed wetting, or enuresis, is a common problem and about 3% of all 14 year olds wet the bed at night. It is much more common in boys, but does happen with girls also. <br>  Bed wetting can be divided into two main types: <br>  Primary Nocturnal Enuresis - which refers to persistent involuntary nighttime urination where the child has never had a dry night. <br>  Secondary Nocturnal Enuresis - which refers to an onset of nighttime bed wetting after a dry period of at least six months. <br>  Three of the most common reasons for primary nocturnal enuresis are: <br>  Genetic predisposition - 75% of children who wet the bed have parents who had the same problem as a child. <br>  Deep sleeping - studies suggest that children who wet the bed are very hard to wake up and have a hard time waking to an alarm clock. <br>  Reduced production of vasopressin - an anti-diuretic hormone that directs the kidney to concentrate the body's urine so your bladder doesn't overfill.<br>  Two of the most common reasons for secondary nocturnal enuresis are: <br>  Urinary tract infection. <br>  Stressful situations at home or school. A bed wetting preteen is not lazy. They are not undisciplined. They have a problem and will need the help of a physician. Even though most preteens will grow out of this condition in time, it will benefit your child to get this help, as during this time their self-esteem is being affected. <br>  Tips <br>  Don't make a big deal out of a wet bed. Show your preteen how to strip the sheets and do a load of wash herself. <br>  Never punish your preteen for wetting the bed. <br>  If you were a bed wetter, share your experiences with your preteen. <br>  Keep this between your preteen and yourself. Sharing this problem with other family members or friends will only serve to embarrass your preteen. (you dont want her to have low self esteem, look for love in the wrong places, turn to drugs or alcohol )<br>  Find positive things to focus your conversations on. Don't let the only communication you have with your preteenager be about bed wetting.<br>  <br>  So...take her to the doctor for a complete physical to find out if the cause is medical. <br>  There are alot of devices that work well for deep sleepers. My friend has an alarm that goes off to wake her son so he can go to the restroom.  <br>  Please tell her you are so sorry for not understanding her pain. SHe is surely deep inside ashamed.  She obviously cant control her problem ...no child wants to be hit, made fun of etc.  She needs more lpatience and tenderness right now. The teen age years are very hard ones esp for girls.  <br>  If you can go to the library and get the book queenbees and wanna bees. It will really help you understand her world.<br>  Good luck hon, this will get better.|`|3BGfiCGjaa	If it's true that you have punished her for it and made other children make fun of her, then you should be ashamed of yourself! This child clearly has a problem either with bladder or the need for attention. Either way something is troubling her and you need to handle this like a responsible and caring parent! Talk to her, listen to her, consult a doctor etc!|`|9hPYHRngaa	UR NOT HORRIBLE!!! but u shouldnt do some of those things butt u should sit down and have an honest conversation with her and just ask her as calmly as u can to plz stop and explain to her how much trouble it is causing u and it is not normal. also if u dont give her that much attention just try to give her a little more but let her know its not all about her|`|FBl2Dp3eaa	Do not make the kids make fun of her and sleeping in the same wet pajamas and sheets is unsanitary.She probably because she sleeps hard,has a bladder disorder,or many other reasons.My advice is make her go to the batheroom before bed.|`|UFvn0kZ2aa	Wow, you're one dumb b--tch! She's not doing it for attention! You don't know if she has a bladder problem, or something wrong with her kidneys! Take her to the doctor if she keeps doing this, because there might be something wrong! You need some parenting classes, because you suck as a parent! I hope you die b--tch!|`|k754aqjPaa	well i totally think she is just asking for attention! But the question is why doe she want this kind of attention, and why she is going about it this way. I definetly think that she should get some help with a guidence  counselor|`|XgyHPhMzaa	you need to take her to a doctor, if she is ok try talking to her, my oldest daugther did it for a few years and we took one day at a time. WE NEVER PUNISHED HER
xtmFBjO9aa	If the contractions are unbearable just go in regardless... Better safe than sorry.|`|JBsilBYXaa	You are in true labour when the pains gather in intensity and frequency and become regular.  Also if you go for a walk or have a bath or lie down then don't go away but should get worse.  Though the heat from a bath may make them feel slightly better.|`|y5sWmbtnaa	Well I have been in labor before and the other day i went to the hospital thinking i was in labor and I wasn't ... so that being said All I can say its hard to tell! Contractions will get stronger and closer together though in real labor.|`|ImOgCILSaa	i went in last night for false labor. 4 hours of contractions being really close and stronger<br>  <br>  then i got turned away so who knows
285e8b302bc60e4817f5d45c744bdcfeaa	Wow Girl, This was long!!! But i guess I'll start 1 by 1.<br>  <br>  1. YES, you can still be pregnant. Hormone strengths vary widely in the first few days of pregnancy. So its possible that your hormones are low, or that you ovulated maybe a day or so later than normal. If i were you, I'd wait about a day or two (Monday morning) and re-test. That way you give your body chance to build up the hormone.<br>  <br>  2. If your not pregnant, the symptoms could be stress-induced. Alot of times when were TTC, we interpret every little thing as a pregnancy symptom. Now somtimes, they are, and alot of the times they arn't. I would say just realx, and dont fret about it. If it didn't happen this month, then HEY, theres always a next month!! Try to be positive.<br>  <br>  3. 2/20 is approx. 15 days after the start of your LMP, so thats more than likely ovulatuion cramps that your feeling. Some women get them and others dont. So no, it would be too early for pregnancy symptoms.<br>  <br>  4. The pains from one side of your body indicate which side the egg was released from. So this month, your right ovary released an egg. As far as the panting, our hormones fluxuate which cause changes in energy levels, moods, appetites etc. So your probably getting your short of breath and fatigue from that. I don't think anything else is wrong. Are you healthy? (Decent weight, and active)<br>  <br>  5. When i found out I was pregnant, some of the symtpoms I had were the cramps, fatigue, moodiness, stretchy cm, excessive headaches and a metallic taste. The cramps were horrible, actually worse than my normal cramps. I later came to find out it was a twin pregnancy. The fatigue was rediculous, i mean i got tired at every little step. Lets not even talk about me being able to brethe lol.<br>  <br>  If any other questions feel free to let me know.|`|umdKUxSDaa	i think your pregnant, this is so what happened to me, in october when i was pregnant allthough mine did end in a miscarriage at 8w6d :[|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Some women are not able to get positives until a week after their expected period was due. Try taking another test in a few more days and keep testing unless you get your period. If you still get negatives see your doctor about the symptoms. Only she can diagnose you.|`|yp9rEMSraa	First off you are not boring us....all of us are on here to help if we can and be there for you....There are some women that feel that they are prego the day after they conceive (my mom was one of them)....she felt different and kind of sick....there are women that have cramping from implantation.....they also have cramping before they find out they are actually prego...my friend thought she was having period cramps and actually she was prego...If you are prego I really don't think anything is wrong with the baby and i think that you are going to have a healthy pregnancy...when you get pregnancy your uterus stretches causing cramping for some women....if you are worried about it in a couple of weeks i would go see you doctor or talk to him on the phone and tell him what you are feeling....the cramping and pricking pains also could be gas...sorry but it could lol had this in december....it was lovely going to the doctor thinking i was prego and it turned out pms and gas lol....I really think that if you are feeling these things that you might be prego...im not a doctor though....i would test again with the first morning pee and maybe wait a few more days....i would spend the money and get a first response prego test too...they are suppose to be the best in detecting pregnancy.....Best of luck this month and baby dust to you
hPkSWRAkaa	If your baby is breastfed normal stools are yellow mustard colored and sometimes seedy, green, and thinner than formula fed babies. If your baby is formula fed they are thicker and I'm not sure of the color. How different was it from other stools? If it was a slight change I wouldn't worry but if it is the total opposite or quite a bit different I might worry. Has this ever happened before? If not and you are breastfeeding it may be something different you ate. My son is breastfed and his stools vary.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	No. My daughter's poops were sometimes multicolored, blue, green, and brown (ocassionally even a little dark yellow). It's normal and due to her body adjusting to life outside the uterus. Be prepared when you start feeding her solid foods to get this more often.|`|Y1npBMS0aa	i dont think so, i think it is normal. <br>  <br>  but im only 15 ( although i watch shows on babies).<br>  but if i had a baby i wouldnt take a 15 year olds advice.<br>  <br>  except i would call the pediatrician.|`|1PAFN8avaa	You should worry if she continues to have watery stools. Babies have a harder time retaining water than adults so if she continues to have watery stools, it could lead to dehydration. Try giving her pedyalite to hydrate her. But definately call a pediatrician first.
kPl8TTzNaa	None of the above. <br>  <br>  <br>  Amelia Ruby or Rose Amelia would be gorgeous.<br>  <br>  <br>  Lucy is pretty but I prefer it as a nickname.<br>  Elizabeth is filler.<br>  Lily is overused.<br>  Rose is filler and overused as a middle.<br>  Lily Rose is the most overused combination, second to Emily Rose.<br>  Ella is more of a nickname.<br>  May is fine, spelled correctly.<br>  Peyton is a masculine boy's name.<br>  Lee is filler.

TlFnIei0aa	It should, if it's not bothering him it should be going through his digestive system.
ApyrV5J9aa	I can assure you that there is no such thing as a pill to make you look pregnant. There would be no medically necessary reason to have such a pill-it would serve no purpose. Either she is pregnant and wishing to hide that fact or perhaps she has some other medical issues going on. Once again, she did NOT take a pill to make herself look pregnant. Don't know who "she" is, but she is lying to you. Good luck!|`|VnRECJJxaa	i never heard of a pseudo pregnant pill<br>  <br>  and preg bellies can be a bit pointed depending on how the baby's sitting in there|`|4XfjUcvDaa	Never heard of that.|`|DxDfa3E7aa	Sorry, honey, she is fooling you. There's no such thing. If she looks pregnant, she possibly is, whoever this "she" is.
gT90cCP0aa	Nope. Piercings are not hereditary.|`|OMbXazFFaa	I don't mean to be rude, but are you serious? How much do you know about biology or physiology? It is not possible for your baby to experience and physical deformities on themselves that you inflict on yourself. The only harm you can do to your baby while in-utero is chemical in nature, like if you smoke or drink. So pierce away. Just don't pierce your nether region. LOL.|`|hVBes2B1aa	no your dumb, none of this is true. nothing that you do to your body superficially can or will affect your baby|`|Yw349A75aa	Nope, that's impossible. Probably just an old wives' tale (like if you play with the bottom of a baby's feet, they'll turn out mentally retarded...yes people have said this).|`|i0pjnfvIaa	None of it is true.|`|b4V4KGkYaa	that's not possible|`|xxSGhywoaa	OH yes Veryy.  Also, if you get a tattoo on your left thigh it will have a birthmark on itself somewhere of the design in which you got a tattoo of.|`|cj7sSPZEaa	No that's not true.

I don't know who told you that but that is honestly the silliest thing I have ever heard. However, you might get an infection, so getting piercings or tattoos is not really worth the risk while pregnant.|`|PURdbiIraa	no that sounds crazy stupid not for nothing|`|LEypSiRpaa	Deep down, do you really think that it is possible for that to happen? To me it sounds just like superstition. I'm not 100% positive that it's not possible. However, I'm going to say no. It's not possible.|`|q51cevqLaa	That is the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard.  Of course it isn't true.|`|4XfjUcvDaa	I have never heard of that.  But I don't think its recommend to get any piercings while being pregnant,|`|wkd5CMNaaa	Who told you this? They must be smoking crack.|`|7z6BWoESaa	I don't have any statistics or anything but I will tell you that while I was pregnant with my son, my partner at the time was very abusive and he punched me in my left ear, and split the top of my ear open it needed stitches, (I left him by the way) so believe it or not my son, now 15 has a scar on his left ear that looks just like my scar he was born with it! so stranger things have happened ya know? after that I believe it may be possible|`|txv7TIgiaa	that is bull ****|`|yUAMqWtnaa	no it's just a myth but don't quote me on that !|`|DxDfa3E7aa	I've heard of that too. Let's just say I've seen my fair share of women with piercings having babies that are scar-free, save for their bellybutton. I knew one woman that had seven holes in each ear, a nose ring, two lip rings, a bellybutton ring, and others I can't mention in mixed company while she was pregnant. Her baby girl didn't have a mark on her.|`|FNdsPNrJaa	Thats silly. And Entirely NOT possible. Your baby is completely separate from you. Its like saying just because your friend goes with you to the tattoo parlor and sits next to you while you get a tattoo means that she will automatically get it :P....would you think that getting a tat would make your baby have a tat? O.o I hope not lol!|`|483e49b9ba8ea322e76bb65dc8f82a66aa	Someone is full of it and trying to scare you into not getting a piercing, I got my nose pierced while pregnant, do you seriously think my kid will be born with a hole in its nose? That is really the silliest thing ever lol.|`|Jhpiy5lFaa	changes of physical appearances done to yourself after you were born is not going to affect your offspring, for example, if you cut your arm off, your baby isn't going to come out with one arm.|`|AA11633383	No this is not true.  However since piercing can potentially lead to infection and/or other complications you might want to consider waiting until after giving birth just to be on the safe side.  An infection COULD endanger your baby.|`|46PSDx1raa	No its not true but if you get an infection from the piercing it can be harmful to the baby and you won't be able to take most medications because they can affect the baby.|`|AI2VoFP4aa	no its not true wow thats probably the dumbest thing ive ever heard. you really shouldnt be getting piercings or tattoos during pregnancy, risk of infection and uncontrollable bleeding could do alot of harm.|`|WsEFCpemaa	Do you think it is true?<br>  <br>  That is crazy. No it is not true. But it is Ridiculous.|`|wHOQXToHaa	No it's not true, however, you are putting your baby at greater risk of infection with an internal piercing like that while pregnant.|`|9E91O09caa	I've also heard if you dye your hair purple while you're pregnant, your babies hair will be purple too!<br>  <br>  ...weird.<br>  <br>  No!|`|fTd509Qzaa	if what ever happened to you happened to your baby in utero, there would be a lot of unhealthy babies.<br>  This is crazy!!|`|Z3mLmDaJaa	obv not, how would that happen, somebody has joked with you my mum used to tell me things like that when i was small :/ i will be shocked if thats true!|`|DwkUUQqhaa	I've never heard of this, and it sounds extremely false to me, although I'm not denying it could be true.
cnK4X2sZaa	i hear your supposed to wait 6 weeks but call your doctor first and if he/she says its ok, than i think go for it!!! please for me? its been at least a month and all i have are my crazy dreams...so please for the other sisters out there that aren't getting any. do it! lol....only b/c you say your up for it and your not bleeding anymore.<br>  have fun and yeah take it easy!|`|q51cevqLaa	I know your doctor said to wait.  But, honestly, if you feel like it, use a condom, go for it.  Just take it easy!  C sections are totally different than vaginal.  Personally, I felt fine after my c section within a few days.  Now, I didn't have sex because that was about the LAST thing I ever wanted to do again!  :)  But I did have sex before the recommended 8 week check.|`|wHOQXToHaa	I was in the same situation with my first! 3 weeks after my csection I was so horny & wanted to start back up again with sex!! (I never dialated either...)  I was too scared to bc I didn't want to mess up anything with my scar or incision, so we found ways around it till it was closer to my postpartum checkup. Good luck! :)|`|JXB5pI7Aaa	Honestly, 10 days after my c-section my lower abdomen still had stitches, tape and it looked like I'd been in a boxing ring with Mike Tyson.<br>  <br>  I personally wouldn't recommend it, but you're going to do whatever you feel is best for you.|`|AI2VoFP4aa	i would call the dr and ask. if youre going to do it regardless go ahead but it doesnt sound like a good idea they usually dont recommend it till after the 6 wk postpartum check up so if you do you will probably start bleeding again at the least|`|7z6BWoESaa	I would not try it, I couldnt have sex for almost 3 months after my C sections because it was so very painful, I would hope you wouldnt have to wait that long since you are so horny now, but I would wait longer than 10 days|`|4XfjUcvDaa	From what I was told you are suppose to wait 6 weeks.  How anyone waits that long, who knows.|`|nAwQiPt2aa	no no no it can open up are you crazy|`|fTd509Qzaa	just because you have a c section doesn't mean that you don't have to follow the rules, still no sex for 6 weeks after having a baby.  it has to do with pushing air into you, it's a bad thing and can be very serious.  <br>  There is a reason there are rules you have to follow after having a baby|`|46PSDx1raa	I don't see why you wouldn't be able to, just be super careful and I'd suggest the missionary position so you don't loosen your stitches.|`|txv7TIgiaa	i say no that could be dangerous and you might regret it you have waited this long another week can't hurt exspecially if you doctor says to wait...|`|iPQqPkhTaa	i would say no. unless he is doing ALL the work and won't put any unnecessary weight on you. burst stitches would suck.|`|8PIGQp16aa	its your body...but i wouldn't|`|rmxOjAPBaa	i really think u should wait! u never know what might happen!|`|01vMpHkWaa	lol then call your doctor if you dont want to wait<br>  <br>  <br>  you shoudl really take his/her advice and not ours|`|HSUfe3m7aa	I had sex 6 days and 10 days after my c-sections. Make sure he's on top (less pressure) and that the bleeding has stopped (cervix closed). Dr's are worried about uterine infection and incision issues.<br>  Use a condom and take it slow.|`|WPI0Z47saa	My doctor told me it was fine and to just give it 2 weeks. She said with a c-section you don't have to wait as long since there was no trauma to you vagina but to be careful with your incision. You should be fine but take it easy.|`|wLBsgNKAaa	No.  No sex for 6 to 8 weeks.  If you want to do something, give him oral and let him stimulate your breasts.  No nookie, please.|`|j7Mxfr1yaa	no you can still introduce infection .........just because you have quit bleeding doesn't mean your done healing don't be stupid ......wait|`|qfNK5aDEaa	If I was in your situation and never dilated then girl I would be having sex right now..
hZco463faa	HR DEPT???   you dont need no stinkin hr dept....<br>  <br>  You dont have to do anything,  It is a right.  You just let your employer know how much time you plan on taking and then you take it.  FMLA just protects you from your employer doing anything to deny you your rights.  <br>  <br>  There is no paper work what-so-ever required by law.  Anypaper work given to you to be filled out by an employer can actually be deemed harassment.<br>  <br>  you just need to personally brush up on what your rights are (how long you can take off for the birth of a child).  By LAW your employer should have an FMLA poster posted conspicuosly somewhere within your place of employment.<br>  <br>  BTW congrats<br>  <br>  wow....2 thumbs down.  I am sorry.

0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	In what way is the vehicle unsuitable? Do you mean actually not safe and using it for your purposes would be illegal? Or, do you mean it doesn't have new things that clients would prefer? If it's a question of safety and having your client's well-being in mind go to your boss' managers and inform them of the situation. Encouraging you to break laws is against the law itself and this person should be reprimanded if not fired for engaging in unlawful business practices and endangering the lives of others. Go armed with an involved report on the status of the bus; engine, seating, transmission, heating, cooling systems, tires and everything else. Have at least two mechanics look over the vehicle and report their findings and estimate the cost of making the bus suitable. <br>  If this is something about the cosmetics of the vehicle and all systems are go, than your clients have to make the decision about whether what the center offers outweighs riding in an older bus that isn't as state of the art as newer models. <br>  Another option is to take a tally of the clients who say they will definitely stop attending if this bus is used; calculate the money the company will be losing if this happens and present that figure to your boss. Maybe the cost of fixing or purchasing a newer vehicle will be less than what you stand to lose if clients leave.|`|f7a3aa193e6ef1599fd1586194b788e4aa	Maybe your boss will reconsider when he loses customers.

My husband will be the first to tell you that I am (to him) the sexiest woman alive :)  God bless him, huh?<br>  <br>  Most days I see myself as a curvaceous woman whose body has born miracles.  As part of that, there also come "battle scars" from pregnancy.  Stretch marks, saggy skin, a larger butt, lol.  All these things from having babies are just things I wear proudly as a mom.  This body carried babies for goodness sake!  It's going to have a little wear and tear :)  But overall, yes I do still think of myself as attractive, even if I *am* carrying an extra 15 lbs that I didn't have pre-baby.|`|faPKwClPaa	I do!<br>  <br>  And funny enough, the craziness of having to take care of a baby required me to chop off my long, blond (processed) locks and opt for a shorter haircut.

I never would have made that step without the birth of our son.|`|lkhCeAdJaa	As far as thinking my body is sexy compared to the Hollywood type body image that is usually defined as 'sexy'.....no.  <br>  But I believe sexy is a state of mind.  I do feel sexy as far as confidence in my ability to look nice, make my husband happy and do a great job at everything I do.  <br>  Not to say I am perfect, juts that when I do something I have confidence knowing I will be doing my best.<br>  THAT to me is the total definition of sexy!<br>  <br>  It also helps that my husband is totally ravished with me ALL the time;-)|`|jG8b3Mz0aa	Oh how my views on my body have changed. I've finally come to terms with my stretch marks. I have waved the white flag at them and realize they are a part of me until the day I die. <br>  <br>  Do I honestly still think of myself as sexy? Hmm good question, I know I had my "hot" days but sexy, not too sure. I'll ask my husband when he gets home from work, if I fall under the category sexy with stretch marks and love handles.<br>  <br>  Seriously yes I have a lot of self confidence and I still love being me with life altering changes on the bod!|`|1s3nddaYaa	nope, i hate my body. i was 134 when i got prego, and got to 188. and havent lost the wieght. im 184. the only good thing is my boobs. i hate everything else. tryin my hardest to lose some weight. even 10 pounds. cu zi dont look like i weigh what i weigh. but to me 184 is a big number weather i look 184 or not|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	no i dont really i hate the way i look i feel so fat and depressed because i look like sh!t|`|wphLaVs6aa	I still feel sexy and attractive when I actually have time to think about it! My view of my body has changed considerably, but for the better. I look at it with respect for everything it's done over the past year and a half (pregnancy, labor, delivery, breastfeeding, recovery, weight loss). And I also think I look pretty damn good for having had a really large baby 11 months ago!|`|8oAlBL91aa	Oh heck no I don't find myself sexy anymore. My husband says he likes me the way I am but I think he only says that lol. <br>  <br>  I'm 22 and do you believe I'm getting wrinkles already!!!! I have battle scars from my first and now preggo with the second is giving me stretch marks in places I didn't even think was stretching (my bum lol), having a boy so getting those nice little hairs on my belly that's not so bad as having saggy boobs haha. Gosh with my first I had nice perky ones now that I'm pregnant the girls are always looking at the ground. <br>  <br>  <br>  Yep I'm a mess lol. BUT it is all part of who I am and my family still loves me and I'm not trying to impress anyone so a few extra pounds never hurt anyone right. Now pass the cupcakes lol.|`|DRb4Qlypaa	I think I am sexier now that I am pregnant! I don't know how it will be after I have the baby. My hubby is more attracted to me too.Maybe it is just the increased sex drive or maybe I am just happier, but being a mommy and having your body produce a miracle (whether or not the miracle is currently in production) is very beautiful!|`|1tmX7xbRaa	no i don't think of myself that way. i really don't like what i see most times and that tends to cause problems between hubby and i mainly because he sees someone who's pretty (or sexy or whatever) but i don't and i now have a lot more self image issues then i did before.|`|AA12145826	Sexy? Probably not in the traditional sense of the word, but I do think that motherhood has made me more beautiful & "womanly". I'm not struttin' like I used to (can't do that with this other butt attached to mine, I might hurt someone! LoL), but I think I carry myself in a different way, yes. <br>  <br>  I do believe I'm a goddess though....after all I created, carried, and gave birth to another life (and its still alive today despite all my mistakes?! LoL).|`|prqrQcd1aa	Not "right" after having them...cuz i thought i looked like hell quite honestly.<br>  But now after 17 months, and exercising and eating correctly...yeah i do feel kinda sexy.. I'm almost down to the weight i was when i graduated from high school. I may not be the same exact figure..but hey, i've not got too much to complain about honestly!|`|WirFwirLaa	I think I look alright but I definately would feel 'sexier' if I could lose some more weight! I'm starting to exercise more often and I joined weight watchers so hopefully one of theses days soon I'll feel sexy!|`|sw2R5A9iaa	of course -the changes to my body are beautiful.|`|bMyq2nOTaa	Yes, I do, and I have 4 children; our youngest is 4 months. :) My husband thinks so, too!<br>  <br>  My body is a bit different than before I had kids, sure, but not *that* different. I'm still petite, and still have a pretty good body... More importantly, I look like I'm in my early 20's, rather than 31, and that helps, when I'm feeling blue.<br>  <br>  I'm not being vain... Just answering the question. :)<br>  <br>  *edited* Hello, thumbs downers... Jealous or something? :)|`|6VbNJOtfaa	I do feel very sexy; mostly because I have a new appreciation for my body and what it is capable of.  I would say that I am sexier now than I was before I had my son.  Although to be honest I did just dye my hair the other day because the boy is giving me gray hairs!  And before I lost the weight I did not feel this good.<br>  <br>  It is such an accomplishment to be a mother; I think that feeling sexy has a lot to do with being happy with your life and being fulfilled.  My son is the best idea I have ever had, and it shows!|`|MpZxNvcDaa	nope! <br>  <br>  I have tried everything I could do get rid of my giggle! My daughter is going on 3 now! It's depressing and degrading! especially being a single mom. No man wants to be with a women who's body who looks like crap, and if they do they are just doing to it, well you know why!|`|hjLzSGV0aa	i would say so<br>  <br>  i lost over 60 pounds after i gave birth<br>  the only thing i dont like is the stretch marks i try to hide em sooo badddddd|`|4iXL4C6paa	I was just thinking this same question, I gained a whole lot of weight with our last child but I still think Im pretty hot lol...and my husband loves the extra curves|`|jsdDgIuRaa	No I hate my body now
jwIdq5qkaa	I asked my pharmasist when I was on the pill about the antibiotics. IN most cases it doesn't decrease that much, it depends on the woman. She may now be ovulating and that be the white discharge. If she's late take a test. All she can really do. Does she know when she ovulates? Because you have a discharge when you do, so I'd check that out. www.webmd.com will help her calculate it or www.fertilityfriend.com|`|7F0zA7ARaa	depends on if you had sex during ovulation. if she was ovulating during the time you had sex then she would be more likely to get pregnant. use the website below to find out if she was fertile that week.|`|AA11920812	Well, that discharge could be a number of things. For instance a yeast infection or some other STD. Doesn`t alone indicate pregnancy. The pill alone isn`t full proof, but chances are reduced for sure. And, a discharge doesn`t mean much. If she says she is experiencing pregnancy symptoms that means her body is producing HCG and will show up on a pregancy test. That test would be accurate.<br>  <br>  My guess, is no she isn`t.|`|vEv2YwWdaa	Why would you have unprotected sex?  The pill is horrible.  It is to easily messed up.  If you miss a pill, take something else.  She needs to not only use birth control but you need to wear a condom.  It would be really sad to bring a baby in the world b/c you made a bad choice.  Hopefully she is not.  She needs to take a test.  Do not have unprotected sex unless you are ready for a baby.|`|RR7UX4jkaa	The chances of her being preg are 1 in 100<br>  dude don't worry<br>  trust me<br>  your both just scared|`|EXhVHMAlaa	Um. probably not.  But take a test the week of her missed/not missed period to make sure.|`|OMbXazFFaa	Whether or not the antibiotic will affect her BC depends on the type of BC she's on. Certain BC (estrogen/progesterone combo) are more likely to be affected by antibiotics. I've had some close calls myself when I was taking combo pills, but I also used a backup method. If she did not use backup, it could be likely that she's pregnant.If she's on a progesterone only pill, it won't be affected by the antibiotics, but missing a pill is never good no matter what kind she's on. There's only one way to find out. For future reference, if she's on a combo pill (estrogen/progesterone) use a backup method if a pill is missed and/or if she's taking antibiotics. This is usually done for the rest of the month. Even if she's on the progesterone only BC you still need a backup method for the next 24-48 hrs after the missed pill. You can never be too careful. Good luck.|`|UiAakleZaa	Many women experience yeast infections after taking antibiotics especially if it's for a UTI. Have her visit her OBGYN and ask for a test for a yeast infection. Also trying things like eating yogurt (good bacteria) while taking antibiotics can lessen the chance of getting a yeast infection. Try not to have unprotected sex until she clears up the infection as their is a small risk that she can pass it on to you. A treated yeast infection can clear up in anywhere from a day to a week.|`|f9lZK2aKaa	not likely, but YES, ANY antibiotic will decrease the effectiveness of birth control pills. If you were not aware of that before I am glad to share this info with you. <br>  God Bless!<br>  P.S. the discharge could be from an infection. Watch for odor and pain, these are infection indicators.|`|EI2zWFUsaa	it's unlikely that she's pregnant.  However the antibiotic may have caused her to have a yeast infection which could be causing the discharge.  Best of luck!|`|ec7s9I0iaa	could be thrush anti bionics's can do this
AA11554322	this is really tough.  i have no clue what id do, but i am a new mom and the most valuable time with your child is the first few years, you could always docollege on line, evev if you wwent to college ( i am assuming it is close by) you would have to commutr b/ you coulnt just leave your baby. when you get older and start looking for a job you could always explain that you received a scholorship but needed to  take responsibility (an employer would see that as a great character trait)<br>  good luck and enjoy baby|`|jCB7S6sfaa	i think you should go.Its a good oppurtunity.I had my son when i was 16 and i graduate this year and im attending college in the fall just so i can get my degree in nursing as fast as i can to support my son better in 4 years then instead of 10 years.you should really think about your future for your baby and your family and whats best.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!|`|RRChsxSKaa	I think that you should put off school for a little while unless you can take classes online that allow you to be with your child... you are the only parent he'll have for now and you should be there for him. You also need not worry about what your mom thinks or future husband thinks about you not going... if they love you they should accept your choices.|`|FEYVq0puaa	How far along are you? Is the baby going to be born before classes start? <br>  <br>  I think it would be good idea to delay the acceptance for one semester if that is possible. Your baby will need you a lot as a newborn.|`|VHHis05Naa	I don't think you really have a choice here.  You are going to be a mother and you need to be there for your baby.  I could see you being able to go part-time with a ton of support, but full-time?  No way.  Can you see if the scholarship will hold for part-time?  I doubt it will, but it's worth a try?  Maybe look for scholarships out there for young mothers?|`|1tmX7xbRaa	well if your baby is going to be 3 months by the time your semester starts i don't think there would be any harm in going to school. would you still get the scholarship if you went part time? is that even an option? really it's your personal choice on what to do. with my experience most people who put off going to school due to having kids (like me) they don't tend to go back. if you are risking loosing your scholarship then i would go to school. i think it would benefit you and your son in the long run to have the education then to not.
AA10973752	yes its possible im 17 and pregnant with twins and they don't run in any of our families at all.....|`|b17cb0e70d1cd57271e4ba763c7fbc30aa	You mean pregnant. And yes its possible, but rare unless twins run in your family.|`|0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	Yes, of course there's a chance. Other factors that increase the likelihood of a twin pregnancy are: age (women over 35 are more likely to conceive twins); use of fertility treatments; having more than a single egg released from the ovaries each month.|`|uuHPneEcaa	i am sure of it..but I think its more common if it runs on either side of the family. in my family it skips a generation. So either my brother or sister or one of my cousins will have a set of twins.|`|7cDT7h9oaa	Yes you can. Though it is more common in families that twins run in, it is still possible.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Yes, but the odds are low.
3Zad0UuWaa	I mean, there is always that possibilty. But dont sweat it. Its not that big of a deal, kids will be kids. Just let her know that it is nasty/wrong to do that.|`|01vMpHkWaa	oh my...i would just have her drink lots of OJ and take vitamins to assure she doesnt get sick|`|c3474cd1d5137c5d6298fa6134dcf3c8aa	Ewww! Aren't kids great? Well, unfortunately yes, she could have caught something. She can't catch an STD because by definition they are only transmitted through sex, but it is quite possible she could catch a cold or flu from the cup. On the bright side there is no guarantee that the person who had owned the cup previously was sick. Maybe you will luck out and she will be fine.|`|7fPuUT3Daa	O thats fine, i dont know if your child goes to daycare or anything but day care is ALOT worse. Kids put everything in there mouth and touch everything. Its ono biggie honestly yes i can see why it bothers you but dont freak out.|`|Mp5qliEhaa	teach your kid to stay out of trash|`|0MunIx8raa	Let's just hope not.  If she were to catch anything it would probably just be a common cold or something.  I really wouldn't worry too much about it. It is gross, but kids do strange things.  My son once while we were in the store found chewed gum somewhere and while I wasn't looking he got it and popped it in his mouth.  I think it was on the buggy or something.  A few minutes later I realized he was chewing something so I asked him what it was...OH MY SIDE!  I thought I was going to have a stroke right there and then.  I of course made him spit it out and went immediately to the mouthwash aisle and opened up some and made him swish it in the bathroom.  I was mortified.|`|r4E2zXL8aa	yes she could of caught something! watch your kid a little better!|`|TIrftbTWaa	yes she could catch a cold are some thing. but nothing to life threatening
vHxauOyeaa	Let me start this over: <br>  If your toddler ingested battery acid... you would find them crying nonstop because their esophagus would be burned. They would lose airway control and have to be intubated. <br>  If it made it down to their stomach they would be scratching or grabbing at it probably and crying again nonstop. <br>  <br>  If there is any black in the battery it is the carbon rod. <br>  They would have had to get through the corrosive acid to get to the rod. This sounds implausible without burns. Something isn't right about all of this, but they would have visible burns in their mouth and be in constant pain.<br>  <br>  No Problem, the best thing is to keep calm... so the other answers obviously weren't helping. <br>  I am an EMT in NYC and NYS  ... under National Certification. <br>  <br>  Thanks for listening.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	take them to the hospital to get checked out|`|z74wSbQoaa	I would call the pediatrician for their advice.|`|3EQsrBxCaa	i would just call the doctor's office right away - they could at least give you symptoms to watch for if they don't feel it's an urgent case.|`|TJOHxhEUaa	Take them to the doctor and explain.  Do it now.|`|8q82dLS8aa	uhh...911<br>  <br>  duh|`|jvHIqtp2aa	Battery acid is not usually good for kids, I would assume she would have burned the inside of her mouth if she actually ingested it, though I am surprised you are not calling the poison control center and coming on Y/A instead.|`|911f168b7fa0b89caa5732f8b9174286aa	potentially very harmful .  get  her checked  out. its worth  the effort and if its a wasted  journey and a loss of time then it still worth knowing you did the right thing. do not wait  pop along to a doctor now or local  casualty unit and inform  them of incident.|`|r7q8LW7Aaa	Call the hospital NOW.<br>  My daughter once swallowed a battery, it needs immediate attention.|`|jwIdq5qkaa	Contact your Poison Control office immediately. If you cant get an answer take both to ER.|`|5b5b8e8087fb0045161251b9ffd1a88baa	call poison control|`|Wb1ydezNaa	take her to the er right now!!!|`|aZxA4SQjaa	stop wasting time, take her to the doctor!|`|1dVoVp1gaa	911!!!!! those are deadly|`|Uagg9UsFaa	Call poison control and then call your doctor for an appointment or if they say that it needs to be treated right away, then take them to the hospital (not the emergancy room, it's not that fast)|`|0B28ekgEaa	If they ingested it, you should be very concerned. It could make them very VERY sick. You should take them to a hospital just to be sure. You shouldn't risk it. I hope they didn't actually ingest any of it.|`|e7KoyoWsaa	call poison control immediately.  This is not a question to be asking the general public, the health and safety of your children are at stake.  Don't mess around, act immediately like a good parent.|`|4onF5FSTaa	TAKE THEM TO THE DOCTOR IMMEDIATELY<br>  THIS IS POTENTIALLY DEADLY SERIOUS<br>  Just get them checked over because you can never be to careful.<br>  Sakura x|`|nxG8MSLNaa	Take your kids to the hospital straight away, if they have swallowed the inside of a battery it is highly toxic and could seriously harm your children. Don't mess around with this!|`|jHmepKRMaa	Sounds like it was a carbon alkali battery not fatal but can make them sick. If you waited this long for advice your should have one shoved<br>  up your feces disposer.|`|LaUouVtfaa	You shouldn't even need to ask this, take them to the emergency room, NOW!|`|YC4Zh8pIaa	Go to the hospital now! That stuff could be highly toxic!|`|56O0inIeaa	definitely take them to see a doctor immediately.|`|FhrCLLzFaa	Yes you should be concerned.<br>  Call a doctor!|`|GYyhP8Aeaa	call a docter, posion control|`|qcIfCt5haa	see a doctor! or call the posion control|`|elfIbUCmaa	What are you doing asking on here??<br>  You should've called your doctor!<br>  Take her now!|`|d2FJBJ8baa	instead of asking on here you should of called 911|`|Mp5qliEhaa	they gonna get sick|`|sYUUKa7yaa	Go get a docker don't ask us|`|qbwcAk9faa	If your kids are not ill, then do not worry.  By inside of a battery, I suppose you mean battery acid; which trust me, your kids would not have ingested without you knowing.  Clean up all of the battery stuff if you havn't already, and your good to go.  : )|`|L8zZ3eZKaa	The acid inside batteries is very strong, pH 0 or something I think, go to the doctors to be sure. It is highly toxic, in fact I think your not supposed to throw them away in normal trash as they contain such bad chemicals.|`|AA10674018	take them to the doctor/ if not open e-merg rm|`|RFRLLeUAaa	Call poison control|`|twCu2tFfaa	poison controll|`|P6URKl8xaa	I would call the doctor or take them in ASAP !|`|1cS29KiJaa	ooohhhhh......ouch. i feel bad for them.
imBF9Z19aa	Yeah because your body is going through a metabolic change your hormones and body are going to change, when I started working out the first couple of months, along with the eating changes, my period was either late or didn't come at all. Due to all the changes your body has to get used to it's new chemistry, I am in nursing, the only time you really need to worry is if you miss 2 periods in a row, most doctors will tell you to wait until the second month to do a pregnancy test if you think you are.|`|QMxEjCpiaa	Don't know if it's common or not, but if you can afford really healthy food and Chantix, you might be able to afford $1 to buy a pregnancy test at the dollar store or even make an appointment with your OB.|`|OwQsCR4Saa	I think you answered your own question.  <br>  <br>  It appears your diet and lifestyle has changed which is a major reason why your period will fluctuate.  Give it time, it will adjust.|`|OMbXazFFaa	Exercise, especially excessive, can greatly impact your period. I used to experience this when I was a lot younger and a lot more active. It happens more often from running. Stress can cause late periods too. I've def experienced that enough times. It scares the crap out of me every couple of months. Then I realize I haven't missed any pills and I'm fine. Just take it easy with the exercise and give your body a chance to catch up to your new routine.<br>  <br>  There don't appear to be any side effects from the medication you mentioned. Check out the links attached. Good luck!

Not sure of the validity of that, but I do know many women who have gotten pregnant because they thought it was "safe" since they were breastfeeding, hadn't had a period, or were using in-effective methods of birth control (none of which prevent pregnancy). <br>  Its a pretty good chance you're going to end up pregnant by using this method. <br>  Congratulations on the baby and best wishes!|`|87c4dc247307dc8488ec68840bd5a910aa	chance are pretty good.  There is some sperm that leaks out before ejaculation actually occurs, so if you don't want to be having another baby I would be using some birth control.

And it's a lot hard to be sure if you're pregnant as your body doesn't always go back to your cycle right away. A friend of mine got pregnant 2 months after a pregnancy because of a simular setup. if you're concerned use condoms, protection is a good idea at this point as it's better to have a year to recover before you get pregnant again. My friend took twice as long to recover the 2nd time

UgIOVl1jaa	I can't comment on the US but rather on my experience in Australia.  I have private cover & that enables me to have a private Ob, hospital, midwife etc.  The good side of that is my Ob has an ultrasound in his room & does a scan every four weeks until the third trimester then every two weeks etc.  The bad side is they only schedule each patient for 15minute sessions and when you spend half of that having the scan done it does not leave enough time to ask the questions you've accumulated over the last four weeks & I always leave feeling rushed out the door & my questions not all answered!  Also, because I'm private it's very expensive, each Ob appointment is $80 along with a one off payment due at 24weeks of $1850 & of that I get only $100 back on Medicare & that's just for my Ob! I guess every country has their good points & bad points in the health care system.  Best wishes for your pregnancy :)|`|YupMCYHlaa	Well first of all, congratulations and the very best of luck to you!<br>  <br>  In most countries, the health care system is made up of private individual doctors, small clinics, and hospitals that are all independent, for profit, set up to provide people with health care.  In the US, the entire health care system is owned by a handful of big insurance companies.  The insurance companies own the HBOs, the hospitals, the clinics, and the doctors work for them. The purpose of the health care system in the US is to generate profits for the insurance industry.  The purpose of health care systems in other developed countries is to provide health care!<br>  <br>  The decisions made in our system are made by the bean-counters, not the doctor.  He works for them.  The tell him how long he may spend with each patient, what tests he may order, what services he may offer or suggest.  It's all based on how much you cost them vs the cost of denying you the service.  If you manage to get a baby out of it, well good for you, but that's a by-product of the process, not the primary product.<br>  <br>  Most Americans say in survey after survey that they'd favor a 'single payer' plan, like Canada has.  Where the doctors, hospitals, clinics, labs, etc. are all private and for-profit, but the govt. handles the insurance.  Everyone is insured in the same big pool, and the insurance companies don't have an incentive to cherry-pick only the healthiest people to insure, and they don't spend their money weaseling out of expensive but necessary procedures.<br>  <br>  But every politician who suggests a universal health care package, it always has to do with having the govt. buy insurance from the existing health insurance industry, at their going rate.  GHW Bush had a plan, Bill Clinton did, and in the last election both Obama and Hillary did, and they all had this feature.  They were all more govt. subsidies to the big health companies than to provide health care and empower individuals to have a say in their own care.<br>  <br>  Of course this is because money has become the most important thing in our political system, and the health insurance companies kick in a lot of money to political campaigns on both sides.<br>  <br>  So it looks like things will need to get a lot worse before they get better. 8^<|`|1tmX7xbRaa	you are 100% right. Dr's care about money not people. it's VERY rare to find a Dr who actually gives you the time of day which really gets me when we pay so much for this medical care. it's crazy!|`|pKE76Wifaa	Try this|`|QRXtkYrzaa	I totally agree with you.  This is a main reason that when I finally do conceive that I will probably opt for a home waterbirth with a midwife.  I do not feel that hospitals make decisions for their patients anymore as much as they do for monetary and legal reasons.<br>  <br>  Midwives are much better about answering questions (generally) than doctors, and even if they don't have as much medical training, I feel that the way they approach pregnancy and birth means there's a less chance of medical problems happening anyway. (as in, hospital-related stress, making women have unwanted c-sections and other interventions like episiotomies.)<br>  <br>  If you're really unhappy with your doctor, you should look for another or even look into midwifery.  Even if you still want to give birth in a hospital, you can still use a midwife for that.|`|bc70ab753e4a475fa0acef22552ded1caa	You have hit the nail on the head sweetie. It is so hard to get anything done at a doctors appointment without receiving some kind of text book answer. I really don't think the patients concerns are at hand but rather the doctors and the hospitals. Force the issues that you need answered I always say take a list of questions with you so you don't forget or get rushed into not answering them. If you can try to be scheduled as one of the first or one of the last patients that your Doctor will see on the day of you appointment so you can more easily get the attention you need. <br>     I really think we need a better surveying or reporting system in place for our health care system to hold doctors accountable for there behavior and to insure that really issues and guidelines are being followed. I mean you can contact the better business bureau for so many professionals why not doctors. I mean Just had carpet put down and I was called to complete a survey on the installers and how happy I was with the service why should some one care more about my carpet then my health care. Best to you.
2QPUs8lBaa	Oh oh oh! I love the name Blair! I completely forgot about that name! Crap... now i have to add that to my list! hahha!

It kinds reminds me of the blair witch thing. (lame movie by the way)<br>  my cousin had a baby and she named her Makayla Imani. Maybe you can use michaela as a first name and find a mddle name that will sound good|`|1ICati34aa	what is with people and name combos these days?<br>  anyways, it sounds okay, but something doesnt sound right. i think its where you pronounce the accent (heavier sounds- BlAIr miCHAEla) thats funny-sounding buts only a little so overall its a pretty name|`|UIILEn0Uaa	oh thats awesome!<br>  <br>  The only thing I would do is add an 'e' at the end of Blair, it makes it look more girly (while sounding the same)<br>  <br>  Blaire Michaela<br>  <br>  VERY lovely!<br>  It's cute - and strong.|`|PCszwdo8aa	I luv Blair ( + an E) = Blaire its great, but michaela is alright, instead i prefer Mia|`|DNbksEtZaa	I love Blair it's modern but still a pretty name although I don't think Blair Michaela sounds good together.|`|cNjtT4Hyaa	Howbout Michaela Blaire?|`|nc8YKqm4aa	not bad :P She could switch the two around, too either way that's a good name. :)|`|RpK7CoSHaa	love it! especially without the e|`|DRJpjmfXaa	I like Michaela Blair much better!|`|hR3VoAgzaa	i dont like blair. it sounds too snobby. but i like michaela|`|nEwfjLMJaa	Cute!

oCTG5IVvaa	Hello!<br>  <br>  I was feeling little things and not sure if it was baby, im 18 weeks 4 days now and i'm sure its the baby now! <br>  Your description of twitching sensation is spot on, as is the other answer of "goldfish" flopping/twitching for me!!<br>  Yay it's so exciting!<br>  Occasionally it feels like a really big kick and other times it feels like little movements, most of the time i have to sit there and concentrate to be able to feel it - don't notice when i'm busy at work.<br>  My boyfriend hasn't caught it yet but i'm sure he'd feel the big kicks.<br>  Good Luck with the pregnancy, you must be due around same time as me!!<br>  x x x|`|a37f465fb3af30fb69356b87ea42c178aa	My first pregnancy at 14 weeks I felt like I had butterflies in my lower tummy! It was such a lovely feeling. Then as the weeks progressed (at about 19 weeks) they got much stronger and felt like my tummy was twitching - like you described! So it sounds to me that is your baby saying hello to you!! How exciting!! Enjoy your pregnancy and your baby moving around!! xoxoxo|`|3R12SXmAaa	Well it sounds like the baby is already moving. They say the first movements feel like gas or like butterflies fluttering. Good Luck.|`|hf0bEHRKaa	Im 17 weeks pregnant and my baby feels like gas or butterflies in my stomach. You will soon know its the bany when he/she starts kicking!|`|K0Oh0p6Daa	It feels funny and sometimes creepy. I knw I irst started feeling movements at like 3 months with my first kid|`|YxFDiEaCaa	A flutter|`|VJnmHFR0aa	for me it was like a trickily sensation, like when you have a stomach bug|`|a98nJlnEaa	mine felt like a bunch of gas bubbles|`|u7iVZWReaa	yes sounds like its the baby, how wonderful! Ive had three babies and they all felt like fluttery movements which progressed to full blown kicking!! you will also feel jumping every now and then and thats whn it has hiccups! <br>  <br>  all the best<br>  xx|`|iugjADAaaa	Mine feels like she is playing soccer lol x|`|256cVXsmaa	Yea those are definitely the first movements, sometimes there undetectable but if you really pay attention you will notice something different going on in there.  It's exciting when you no that they really are your little ones movements!!! You should start feeling it stronger any day now!  When I was about 19 weeks my mother started feeling the tiny kicks, but than again it happens at different paces for everyone.  Good luck|`|Xrwvu5Uraa	yes!! you described it perfectly. at first it felt like something twitching deep inside me (sorry for that)...but as it got stronger and more frequent it felt like my belly twitching. congrats =)|`|5fmPj6uEaa	the same almost like the kisses of butterflies then real sensations at around three months and in the case of my son by the time i gave birth he was having sessions of spar boxing Tao Kendo and full football matches, the day before he was born I had two docs and half a dozen students and 2 nurses around me gawping at the funny shapes he got my tummy to go into! Great fun! for them.lol|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	It could most definitely be the baby! A lot of women say the first movements they felt were butterfly-like movements. I thought it felt more like a goldfish swimming and flopping around in there.|`|hoX7hoINaa	Mine felt like the carbonation in a soda, when all the bubbles float up.|`|0uhRgfcsaa	thats your baby movin =]<br>  congrats!
D22c6c7Saa	i think its totally normal it is programed into you by society from a very young age to want to be a mother by giving girls dolls and things like that i think almost every girl has names for her kids already picked out and even if they dont want kids they have names picked out just in case lol...|`|pMCMWtYaaa	i really wanted a baby at 18... then i think at late 19 i stoped wanting one.... and that lasted till late 24 and i just turned 25 and i have baby mania. my husband had a vasctomy when he was married to his first wife... and right now the ecomy is so **** he is not working and looking hard for a job, we can't afford to hae the reversal right now... there for not ready, but i keep after him every day i cant stop thinking about it or talking about it, since its something we both want we been working our buts off at a better life and as soon as i can i will be ttc|`|AA11111828	Yes this is really normal. I Wanted children at when i was a little girl but I always know that I wanted to be married. Now im married with two children and one on the way in january. God is the greatest!|`|m8DGpBKiaa	i wanted a baby since when i was a kid at 15 i fell pregnent im 17 know baby girl has 13 months shes the love of my life. would like to have another baby but first waiting to settile down|`|MWvCj3J3aa	yes its normal but get one of those care dolls that mimic a real baby instead. you will change ur mind|`|VvYT0XHiaa	Hi, From my point of view yes that is fine, I started picking names out at 16 lol I fell pregnant at 17 and had my son at 18 and im 19 now. Just because you really want a baby doesn't mean you have to have one, you might just be planning ahead. My son is 16 months old now and im planning on trying for another one fairly soon.

Test!|`|mqGMkUXZaa	I hope you're not pregnant.  First, you should master the English language before you even think about reproducing.  Please use birth control for the sake of humanity.|`|0iYoPLGIaa	the last part of this didn't make sense to me... but if you meant Feb 14th then it may be too early. If you meant January then definately could have tested long ago!|`|wWkfASTNaa	How long are your cycles?! I had 32 day cycles, so I would have been testing a week or two ago LOL Take a test! GL|`|AztPvbauaa	take a test|`|jr5EgB2Taa	No, asking "Do you think I am pregnant?" on Y! A is bizzare, asking if it is a good time to test isn't, since a lot of women don't know.  You can test as soon as you miss a period.  Your body begins production of the hormone that is detected by tests after being pregnant only 3 days after implantation.  You are well past that.<br>  Good luck!|`|SSM3u4l4aa	Yes you can test and you will get an accurate result. Best of luck. <br>  Take the test!!
s01IhkOPaa	I would both you and your husband sit down with each set of parents and tell them.  I know you're nervous, but reassure them that you have a plan for finishing school, and let them know how excited you are.  They may surprise you and be really happy for you.  After all, you're having a baby, not running from the law!  :)  No matter what their initial reaction, things will work out fine in the end, and nine months from now, you'll all be happy and busy with the baby!  Congratulations and good luck to you!|`|Xrwvu5Uraa	well first and foremost, congrats on your pregnancy. I was 20 when I found out I was pregnant and not married, and very afraid to tell my parents. The guilt was eating at me and I had to. It's not something you can or should for that matter hide from your parents. I think you and your husband should sit down with each set of parents and explain to them your situation. You have nine plus months to get some extra money and maybe another job and you could get your own place. I wish you the best of luck and hope everything goes well!!!|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	get your husband to tell them =)|`|33361f975202a28024124ac0b9d8b821aa	How dare they ask you to 'wait 3 or 4 years' before you have a baby!  Sorry that just rubs me the wrong way...<br>  <br>  Anyways I probably wouldn't tell them with the cutesy frame/ultrasound pic, especially if you think they are not going to take it well.  Save that as a gift for when they've accepted it and simmered down a bit.  I think you need to sit them down and just be very direct.  If they're upset, they're upset...that's their problem.  You are married adults and free to make your own choices about starting your family.  They'll come around eventually.<br>  <br>  Good luck and congrats.|`|62vCoDPjaa	dont worry, you guys are like me and my husband, we got married in april last year, and found out in late aug that we were gonna have a baby..we really wanted to wait until my husband finished college, since i am already done. but thinks happen for a reason, and im sure the grandparents to be will be excited, enough to forget about the things that they frown at|`|PXnn6LoPaa	I can understand your worry, especially since you don't have your own place.  I would just let them know right up front that you and your husband promise this will not cost THEM any  more money, that you will pay for everything, and that you will not take advantage of them as babysitters.  Those are the only two reasons I can think they would be upset with you.  Let them know it wasn't planned and that you have no intention to mooch.  Those frames with the ultrasounds will absolutely MELT THEIR HEARTS!  CONGRATULATIONS!!!|`|hoX7hoINaa	My husband and I had the same issue, except it was about 9 months before we got pregnant. We just told each set of parents that they were going to be grandparents in March and they were very excited! I think putting it right out in front that a grand baby is on the way lightens the mood, especially if you'd think they won't approve. We got married at 19, pregnant at 20.|`|qE6BlyCFaa	wow we have like the same story...<br>  <br>  except im 20...we found out i was pregnant the month after we got married..and were very scared as well to tell everyone because of the school thing too<br>  <br>  everyone was very excited and gave us all their support...sooo dont worry!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  gooodluckk=]|`|AA10529334	Its gonna be just fine. They will adjust to the idea and its good you are close to the parents and in-laws - you can get their help  after to finish your education. ( babysitting etc)|`|QPKgc1xJaa	Congratulations<br>  If everybody waited until the "right time" to have children there wouldn't be any people left on the planet.|`|KJgODBKwaa	tell you are married and i am sure you can still finish school do not worry about and next time use condoms =)|`|0iYoPLGIaa	At least you are married. You can explain to them you are happy and that you do plan to finish school. They shouldn't be too disapointed because at least you are married. You can tell them you know it may not be the best timing but since it's happening you might as well make the best of it. Even if they are a little upset in the beginning they will get over it in time and any respect that may have been lost will come back once they accept it.|`|MQ83HGD5aa	They are going to be excited. My inlaws bugged the hell out of us for years to have a baby. Here we are 7 years later pregnant with our first! Even if they don't like the idea at first they'll warm up to it once they see your belly growing. Yes, I do think it's early and you should've enjoyed being married longer but it is what it is. It's your life, you are an adult and marrried. What happens is between the two of you and no one else. Good luck.|`|SSM3u4l4aa	Even if they react badly at first they will come around. You are an adult, you are married- in short you are an adult. If you are self sufficient and not relying on any of your in laws then they really don't have any reason to be mad. <br>  Tell them and let the chips fall where they may. They will come around in a day or so if they don't jump for joy immediately. Best of luck!|`|f4df9712869843dd814c1e02d77242eaaa	well, i don't see why they should be upset....i understand the problem, but i don't think them getting upset would accomplish anything, so maybe they won't.  and i think the ideas the two of you came up with to tell them are cute. maybe write a little poem that says something like "i know the time isn't perfect, but i picked a great family to love, and can't wait till we all can finally meet."...anyway, congratulations, and i hope everything turns out great. :)  God Bless.|`|zbq1SoXgaa	You can't plant a tree and not eat its fruit!The child you are caring is the fruit of your love,and every family will be happy to see the it coming.<br>  You have to trust in human beings ,children change the way we think-and they bring only joy and a huge responsibility.<br>  Don't ever tell them that you are sorry for this,but just"the fruit of our love is growing inside me"|`|K0tpQoHRaa	well just stress the fact that babies bring joy and happiness to a house hold and that you believe that you will make a great parent good luck @ that!!!!|`|1NVLdMyDaa	hum you gotta tell them sooner or later becuase you cant wait forever because when your stomach starts to show you gonna have to tell sooner or later|`|iugjADAaaa	Okay, first Congrats. Don't be afraid to tell them that you are with child, just tell them with courage x<br>  Hope everything works out bbe x|`|zNSDHpV6aa	WOW you will be ok and they will love that baby it here now good luck to you and just tell them they will be ok|`|jr5EgB2Taa	First, I will say Congratulations!  No matter how the news is taken, you are going to be fine.  Sure, they may have "concerns" but be strong enough to stand your ground.  Their "concerns" like you live with them, school, etc. can be addressed with the two of you creating a time line of when you are going to finish school, who is in line to help, and creating a budget.  You have already shown you are responsible (you got married!).  Having a plan should circumvent problems.  <br>  Worse case scenario, all six of you can talk with a counselor.  But really, I have had two of my own and had to borrow money from time to time  The joy of having grandchildren has always overshadowed any burden of our situation.<br>  Don't be nervous, you are creating a miracle!  You are married, you are strong, and you are finishing school.  You can do it!
SSM3u4l4aa	It is a wonderful poem! <br>  <br>  There is a little problem though. A spelling error.. <br>  <br>  "We can wait for you to meet our baby"<br>  Did you mean for it to say "We can't wait for you to meet our baby"|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	Aww, that's adorable! Congrats to you and your family!|`|IoWoDxG8aa	Ha ha! That is really cute!|`|JIrud5INaa	Thats so cute!

Good Luck xx
cj7sSPZEaa	Yes you can.  It depends on when you ovulate and every woman ovulates at  different times during her cycle and every cycle is different.  There is no safe time when it is impossible to get pregnant during your cycle.|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	Yes, you can. It's possible, but not probable. Here's an article about it: <a href="http://www.babyhopes.com/articles/pregnantduringperiod.html." rel="nofollow">http://www.babyhopes.com/articles/pregna...</a> It's pretty informative. :]|`|AA12113249	you can, but is unlikely.<br>  i wouldn't ever have sex without protection, if you don't want a baby.<br>  <br>  also, why would you want to have sex then anyway? gross.|`|b3fcaed1380d38d593a8cb71556b4d96aa	It's always possible if you have unprotected sex, but it is far less likely if you have sex during your period.|`|6701f7106e5be82f05306047c5a9c5e8aa	YES !!!|`|dR2bqUixaa	YES!!!|`|k0B8err5aa	Yes you can! (edit: for everyone saying "no" do your research! you very well can get pregnant!)|`|0tr1cR3Gaa	u can it depend if an egg is there or not
rlLf5m0xaa	not necessarily, its usually before your period starts that you have a better chance of getting pregnant,if you are worried, go to the doctor and get checked out!
ZHttz4SPaa	 you  cant get pregnant on the 15th day of your cycle. its impossible.|`|IjYTf3wyaa	Chances of being pregnant? 50/50 - Toss up on any given day around your ovulation.<br>  Chances of being not so smart about your actions -100%|`|n7D0coF2aa	just wait till your due for ur perisods and check its the best way  to know<br>  <br>  chances are 50 / 50 for now|`|tZU9k9zNaa	If you have a normal 28-33 day cycle, theres a good chance you could of gotten pregnant.Sperm lives till about 5 days so even if you ovulated on the 20th,you can still get pregnant.|`|IuSfCtN9aa	100% Congratulations! You are now going to be happy!|`|unLISuSaaa	wait, you want to be pregnant right?<br>  otherwise that was a silly thing to do :O|`|5uqRdBjnaa	pretty darn high chance of pregnancy |`|b7a563d8bc083214d4c4bf87c19f07c1aa	Sounds like about the right timing.  They make tests that would probably show you if you were pregnant right now.  remember even a very faint line indicates pregnancy.  However a negative at this point wouldn't be trustable so it's best to wait a few days.|`|Bwf4olwDaa	Why do you have unprotected sex?? <br>  <br>  And not once but 3 times?? <br>  <br>  God im 17 and have always been MAJORLY carefull|`|VNbflpk1aa	VERY HIGH CHANCE UR PREGNANT<br>  GOD HELP U!<br>  DONT GET AN ABORTION!|`|hBwfZgDNaa	Thats very risky my dear.  If your ready to have a baby anytime soon just keep it up :)
AA10186411	Theres a good chance it wouldn't have picked up the hormone yet since you just ovulated a week ago.  What type of x-ray did you have?  If you thought you were anyway, you should have told the tech so they could properly shield you. Keep in mind though, if it was something like your ankle, or neck (something not close to your uterus) the chances that radiation even got to your uterus is unlikely.|`|P5sWHFg2aa	Well I've been in the same situation I had an x-ray and I really thought I was pregnant so the ER doctor had me take a urine test and it did come back NEGATIVE! Well I think it was 1 week later and I took a home pregnancy test again and it came back POSITIVE!!!                 NEVER RELY 100% ON A URINE TEST  REQUEST A BLOOD  TEST OR TELL THEM NOT TO DO THE X-RAY|`|EatvN0RUaa	That's weird usually they do a blood test to make 100% sure..... Urine test are about 99% which is good but not like a blood test.|`|AA12071850	pretty accurate. |`|FBimkRz2aa	They are nolt always right. It depends on what brand you got...|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	The important thing is: do you think you're pregnant? If you test at the wrong time, it won't detect any hormone levels in your urine. If there's any chance that you could be pregnant, then you probably should have refused the x-ray. <br>  <br>  That said, most pregnancy tests the doctors use are the same that you can buy in the drugstore. I'm not sure how sensitive they are - the more expensive ones can register hormone in your urine about five days before your missed period. BUt I'm guessing they just use the cheapie ones that would most likely only detect hCg after you've missed a period.
vx4xwsa3aa	everybody grows at different rates, and since you have only gained 7 pounds, any roundness is strictly baby, and not you!!! honestly, they say that women in subsequent pregnancies show sooner, i dont think they are right... some women do, but most women in subsequent pregnancies have more pooches than baby belly... it doesnt start getting really hard until later... i think first time women start having bellies sooner, well most of them do... some ppl dont show until very late in pregnancy, but really, where is the fun in that?!?! i cant wait until i REALLY start to show, so everybody knows it! and they dont just assume im fat! lol..|`|dR2bqUixaa	I'm almost 18 weeks and just now started showing.
