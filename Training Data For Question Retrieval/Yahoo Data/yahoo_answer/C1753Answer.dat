He is a cruel, vicious man who was not kept in prison nearly long enough.  I sincerely hope the NFL grows a set and does not allow this criminal to play football in a professional setting again.  I still think this man should have done to him what he did to his dogs.  No one this cruel should be allowed to profit, ever.|`|i4QYyUsRaa	underDOG,  kinda ironic he'd be called a dog after he cruelly murdered so many of them for fun.  But yeah, if swome sleazeball can make a buck off Vick, they'll hire him. Blacks still love him and like always, claim he was just arrested because of racism.|`|g4Lqrc3caa	underdog? really that was your best word choice?<br>  <br>  <br>  anyway, I don't think he'll ever play again. Not only would it be totally sh1tty of the NFL but they'd get too much sh1t for it. Think about the hell that would come from all of the animal rights groups alone.|`|R49w1Dr7aa	There are too many animal lovers, especially dogs lovers, to ever care about him again. Sure he might play ball again but he will also get booed a lot. He will always be a villain in my eyes.

Perhaps our politicians and bankers should all try living a month on that, then we'll see what they call 'fair'.<br>  <br>  I think though, that for a man accustomed to his way of life, then ￡80,000 a year is more than enough.  I can't see how he'd need more than that, what with all the savings he must have.|`|xZwwb3kVaa	He would get zilch from me as he probably has millions stashed away somewhere in a Foreign Bank   knowing and reading about that robber, and as regards a Pension well does he need it. ? I hardly think so !!, Anyway he is not old enough yet, so I hope they manage to lose it , somewhere in the depths of his Bank he messed up.|`|AA11366224	You appreciate that he has a lifestyle to support.  ￡695,000 pa just isn't enough darling.<br>  <br>  The government should have taken over all the investment accounts (through the Bank of England) and let RBS go bankrupt.  Then Fred would have had to join the queue with the rest of the creditors.|`|AA12121752	If the bank had been allowed to fail he would have got ￡20,000 per annum - considering the results of his stewardship of the bank that's about right.  He has made over ￡30 million already.|`|4p6jmaO8aa	As his contract no doubt states, he must receive a pension of ￡693,000-a-year for life. I haven't of course seen the contract, but I'm willing to bet it doesn't specify what kind of pounds sterling he should receive. It could be Bank of England sterling, but on the other hand it could be Monopoly pounds sterling! If the people who wrote up/signed the contract were careless enough not to specify which kind of pounds sterling, then I'm afraid the contract is ambiguous - it is up to the pension fund administrators to interpret the "pounds sterling" in whatever way they wish!|`|G8zAPz8Maa	I think his pension is quite fair and my prospects are therefore quite good. I mean he only destroyed a bank but Ive bankrupted an entire country - Imagine how much I am due for a such a bigger disaster !|`|AA12349988	I dont know the figures but he should be able to claim what he put into his pension pot up until the moment he had to resign.<br>  <br>  That isn't his money.|`|w0ZqjJBtaa	He should have to live on the state pension. At the moment he's laughing all the way from the bank.|`|oDz0FQpEaa	Maybe he should try to live on basic state pension like a lot of the OAP's in this country. He would see how lucky he gets it then!|`|ddc45a1e7882ab207d8b341977142faaaa	Same as my state pension of ￡91 per week and I'm not a failure|`|CqAK1uiNaa	1 penny, its what he is worth as a balls up artist.|`|9GbPZUTXaa	Let him have the lot, but up his tax rate to 99.9%. At least we might get it back that way.|`|9bd02e0eb04ac62bc729b2533dc4555eaa	I believe he would have been entitled to ￡20,000 pa before the bailout - that seems more than adequate for someone who thinks they're entitled to retire at 50 having taken a major bank to the very edge of bankruptcy.<br>  You can visit this blog and record your vote in a poll for how much you think he should get:<br>  <a href="http://www.thecreditcruncher.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.thecreditcruncher.com</a>|`|iBH7NTl3aa	Well he's only 50 now so when he reaches 65 he should get the state pension, but he'll still need to pay his national insurance until then! the thieving ******* parasite!|`|gYgXn2weaa	He should get sweet FA as he is responsible for the state of the bank.

AA11014910	If they are playing by the rules there should be an open discussion/debate before any motions are made. This is the time to make your views known. If this is going through a committee then straight to a floor vote without input from the "rank and file" your leaders are railroading these sort of things through. Bring it up at the next meeting and don't be shy! Do, however, make your points clearly and concisely so everyone knows exactly your point. Then, if the members still out vote you at least you know you gave it your best shot. Democracy is a messy business-not as attractive as watching sausage being made.

Perhaps that is where Palestinians picked up terrorism as a technique.<br>  When will they realise that America's irrational and totally disproportionate financial support and military assistance since 1947 (over $120 BILLION in direct "aid") has enabled Israel to become the regional bully that all of its leaders, since 1930s, have suggested, by their statements, it would become?<br>  It seems only hours ago, though it is a few weeks, that Israel's proponents were saying that Israel had not used phosphorous shells, and that those who suggested it had were liars, as were the UN and other aid organisations. Then, they decided that the reports might be right, but that their use had been within the legitimate terms of the Geneva convention. Now they are just saying that "it serves them right". I wonder how "right" they might feel it was if a stray bit of phosphorous landed on the bare chest of their own child, and they could do nothing to extinguish it, but had to watch the agony of their child until that phosporous had burned itself out?<br>  <br>  I will repeat what I have said several times in this forum.<br>  It would seem that war crimes have been committed, and, if they have, there is an international mechanism for such crimes investigation and prosecution. That process should be allowed to happen.<br>  There is fault an BOTH sides. <br>  It is vital to the long term viability of the region that Israelis and Palestinians learn how to live alongside one another in peace. They can only succeed in that after they have engaged in talks with each other, and coming out with simplistic statements like "we do not talk to terrorists" is the surest way there is to ensure that peace is never achieved.<br>  America must excercise its influence in positive ways that stop seeing it giving such hugely disproportionate aid to Israel.

These innocent little children are not militants or part of Hamas, they just want to live in peace like everyone else.

Who are you kidding ? Only yourself I think .|`|zGkqGZzYaa	One thing you are overlooking is Weapons are manufactured by just about every country in the world and are shipped to both sides of most warring factions. You point the finger at the USA, when in fact the USA didn't pull the trigger.<br>  War is Hell and, as you seem to aptly leave out is that rockets being fired on peaceful civilian sections of Israel. So, in response to the rockets it is a fitting response to send a message to the few extremists that this action will not be tolerated under any circumstances. At some point in time this action taken by the fanatics to wage war on civilians can only be answered by any means possible.<br>  Irreguardless what you may or may not think of the actions taken and what weapons were used you don't know anything about war.<br>  Quoting statistics on issues you read about doesn't come close to qualifing you to even pose a question as to WHY certian steps were taken and who ordered them and the reasons behind them.<br>  You are sorely misinformed, because you don't understand these people hate us everything about us and will only be happy if we as a people are completely destroyed. Period. This will not satisfy them. THEY BELIEVE ALL ARE INFIDELS.Only they are right in there belief system.|`|wQwufvKNaa	BECAUSE THEY CAN GET AWAY WITH IT.|`|AA11222206	conventional weapons I guess do not generate as much pain and agony as white phosphorus.  Obviously some people derive great pleasure from watching people writhing in agony as their flesh and bones slowly melt before their eyes.   They enjoy hearing the shrieks of children. They obviously enjoy looking at the results of their labor - piles of flesh burnt black and unrecognizable.  Ay Vey!  Is this what 'civilization' has come to?  No animal in the wilderness does such horrendous things to it's own kind.  Yet mankind pretends to hold a position superior to them.  Indeed!  If they only knew the depth of depravity to which mankind will descend to 'win' in a conflict, they would want nothing to do with us.  Humans need to learn a little compassion from the beasts.
HUDSwT3baa	I think he is lying since he has been released he knows that he can say whatever he likes now.<br>  But his capture he brought upon himself, he left the UK, and travaled to a terrorist haven with a motive.

There are too many other examples of such things, and if you go on any redneck website you will encounter loads of American fascists who are proud of having officials keen to torture members of what they see as inferior races.  Come on, they allow gang rape in their own prisons on their own people.  Uncivilised lot.  We also have examples of the Army using torture and in SAS training you are tortured to get you used to it.

My friend who is the best drummer I know did a performance at his 18th, and what song did he choose? Yup, it's just a shame that on the actual track, the drum part takes a good two minutes to actually come in, so we were standing there for quite a while. In fact, all drummers I know are obssessed with that advert. <br>  <br>  Other than that, I remember a Peugeot advert that was on years ago, with a Bhangra Knights song in it, that was also quite awesome. There's an Indian guy trying to mould his car into the shape of the certain model of car and then at the end he's in it with all his mates.|`|bJnqYE6maa	The most repulsive ads I EVER saw were the Hardee's commercials from a few years back...  The guy wipes chili off his blue jeans with a french fry and eats it.  Mark McGuire eating his pickle slice looks like he's eating a bugger..  Just lots and lots of really gross footage of people eating with smacking sounds.  It was so bad that I sent an email to Hardee's and told them their commercials turned me off from ever eating the food.    That guy eating chili off his pants leg is so nasty I can't stand it.|`|i4bjQbPcaa	I hate that one for the air freshner for your bathroom with the boy who demands to go to his friend's house for a poo!

I think it is for baby milk.  I hate the Cadbury's one too.|`|w0ZqjJBtaa	I DETEST the one with the two children whose eyebrows move to the music and the one where the sweet keeps shouting "BRING ON THE TRUMPETS". I turn over every time.|`|Kw8YW2Yjaa	I like the cravendale milk one and the PG tips one.<br>  I hate the cadbrys one (it was on paul o grady show today lol)|`|m125JazMaa	I like the new kitkat ones! boop!<br>  my bad.<br>  Also the Hovis advert that skips through the different time lines.<br>  The new co-op one is way too long!
