Las mejores universidades colombianas, la Nacional (en Bogotá y todas sus sedes en el país), la del Valle, líder en Medicina en Colombia y Suramérica, la de Antioquia, la Industrial de Santander, todos estos centros educativos estatales, los mejores del país, al que solo un peque?o porcentaje de colombianos puede acceder, (porque exigen exámenes de conocimiento y aptitud) tienen algo en común: son abierta y firmemente opositores al gobierno de terror de Uribe Vélez. Dentro de cualquiera de estas prestigiosas universidades Uribe tiene PéSIMA imágen y no es asunto de movimientos estudiantiles, el fervor antiuribista va desde los decanos, pasando por los profesores, hasta nosotros, los estudiantes.       Escritores, como Gabriel García Márquez, Fernando Vallejo, artistas plásticos, músicos, politólogos, sociólogos, actores de teatro, científicos, todo ese porcentaje relativamente peque?o de colombianos con acceso a una educación MUY SUPERIOR son opositores radicales al gobierno de Uribe.

Was there a time in our country's history where tax cuts, such as those proposed by John McCain, have actually created jobs?  I understand the theory behind it, but is there evidence from the real world that this has actually happened?

The amount of virulent bashing of Obama I've seen on these boards before and since the election is really astounding. He is the president-elect! the country voted for him, and now everyone will have to accept him. regardless of whether or not you like the man or agree with his policies, there is no cause to bash him for reasons like he hasn't brought the troops home yet, or the dow plunged again. (both of which i have seen on here) you don't have to like the man, or agree with his policies, but he has been elected, and it's time to put up or get out. he is not hitler, he is not the gestapo, he is not a socialist. give him a little time to prove himself before you defile him. personally i am so thankful he has been elected, i think it was the only thing that could repair our standing in the world at all, but regardless of whether or not you agree with me nobody has any right to bash him about things he has no control over. if you disagree with his policies, thats different. but can't we all give the man a chance?

Then, yesterday, we had ANOTHER bomb threat, and our principle is so ticked off it's not even funny. Because both bomb threats were found written on restroom walls, no one is allowed to use the bathroom or go to their lockers during class periods unless they are escorted there by a teacher. Usually, we can go to the bathroom or our lockers whenever we want. We will be doing this for a few weeks. They have not caught the person who wrote either bomb threat.

For the past two months, a major American magazine and an allied news service have been engaged in a legal battle with the United States Navy over records that they believe show that John McCain once was involved in an automobile accident that injured or, perhaps, killed another individual.      Vanity Fair magazine and the National Security News Service claim to have knowledge "developed from first-hand sources" of a car crash that involved then-Lt. McCain at the main gate of a Virginia naval base in 1964, according to legal filings. The incident has been largely, if not entirely, kept from the public. And in documents suing the Navy to release pertinent information, lawyers for the NS News Service allege that a cover-up may be at play.       http://www.oliverwillis.com/2008/10/28/m...

20081105074517AAuZFbN	Politics & Government;Elections	Did John McCain really want to be president?	He didn't seem like he had his heart into the campaign. Like my old coaches said, he didn't put 110% into his effort. I know Sarah Palin really wanted to win, but she's delusional and "way above her paygrade."      I'm dubious about whether he was legitimately running to win, but I'm not going to get into that. I felt sorry for him in the end, because he looked way too tired, old and battered looking to become the president. I think he needs to retire and enjoy life.

20090227171921AAW7cJI	Politics & Government;Government	What do you think of this? Welcome to the barnyard, How true, please let me know your thoughts, thank you.?	The Little Red Hen called all of her Democrat neighbors together and said, 'If we plant this wheat, we shall have bread to eat. Who will help me plant it?'       'Not I,' said the cow.    'Not I,' said the duck.    'Not I,' said the pig.    'Not I,' said the goose.           'Then I will do it by myself,' said the little red hen, and so she did.   The wheat grew very tall and ripened into golden grain.           'Who will help me reap my wheat?' asked the little red hen.           'Not I,' said the duck..    'Out of my classification,' said the pig.    'I'd lose my seniority,' said the cow.    'I'd lose my unemployment compensation,' said the goose.           'Then I will do it by myself,' said the little red hen, and so she did.           At last it came time to bake the bread.    'Who will help me bake the bread?' asked the little red hen.           'That would be overtime for me,' said the cow.           'I'd lose my welfare benefits,' said the duck.           'I'm a dropout and never learned how,' said the pig.           'If I'm to be the only helper, that's discrimination,' said the goose.           'Then I will do it by myself,' said the little red hen.           She baked five loaves and held them up for all of her neighbors to see.  They wanted some and, in fact, demanded a share. But the little red hen said, 'No, I shall eat all five loaves.'           'Excess profits!' cried the cow. (Nancy Pelosi)           'Capitalist leech!' screamed the duck. (Barbara Boxer)           'I demand equal rights!' yelled the goose. (Jesse Jackson)           The pig just grunted in disdain. (Ted Kennedy)           And they all painted 'Unfair!' picket signs and marched around and around the little red hen, shouting obscenities.           Then the farmer (Obama) came. He said to the little red hen, 'You must not be so greedy.'           'But I earned the bread,' said the little red hen.       'Exactly,' said Barack the farmer. 'That is what makes our free enterprise system so wonderful. Anyone in the barnyard can earn as much as he wants. But under our modern government regulations, the productive workers must divide the fruits of their labor with those who are lazy and idle.'           And they all lived happily ever after, including the little red hen, who smiled and clucked, 'I am grateful, for now I truly understand.'           But her neighbors became quite disappointed in her. She never again baked bread because she joined the 'party' and got her bread free. And all the Democrats smiled. 'Fairness' had been established.           Individual initiative had died, but nobody noticed; perhaps no one cared...so long as there was free bread that 'the rich' were paying for.           EPILOGUE            Bill Clinton is getting $12 million for his memoirs.           Hillary got $8 million for hers.

ROMA - "Berlusconi contro Sky: Iva raddoppiata per le pay tv". E' questo il titolo della prima notizia del sito di Sky che ha affidato oggi alla voce di Ilaria D'Amico il primo degli interventi in difesa della tv satellitare dopo il varo del pacchetto anti crisi del governo che prevede il raddoppio dell'Iva dal 10 al 20%. Una "manovra scombinata con in più qualche perla quale l'aumento Iva sugli abbonamenti Sky", che costerà alle famiglie tra i 40 e gli 80 euro in più l'anno, a seconda dell'abbonamento secondo Adusbef e Federconsumatori. La conduttrice di Sky Calcio Show ha spiegato con molta enfasi ai telespettatori l'impatto della decisione del Governo auspicando un ripensamento da parte del Parlamento. "Si tratta - ha detto - del raddoppio di una tassa per 4 milioni 600 mila famiglie italiane che hanno liberamente deciso di abbonarsi a Sky.

20090227172120AA3GwcI	Politics & Government;Immigration	Why not have an international agreement that all countries accept a minimum foreign born population of 25%?	The proof that a foreign born population of at least 25 % can work: Australia is 22 % foreign born (#1 in world), Canada is 20 % foreign born (#2 in world), while only 13 % of the U.S. is foreign born.  I'm born in Canada, so I know Canada's economy has expanded to absorb  the world's 2nd highest rate of immigration.  I'm talking about all classes of workers, not a brain drain.      According to free trade economics, free migration would raise the world's productivity, and that increase in productivity will pay for increased wages and social spending.  Based on that, the world's workers should have some rights to migrate.      If migration restrictions made economic sense, you people would want some for Americans within the U.S., but you don't? The same fundamentals must apply to national and international migration. How can it be otherwise? Illegal Immigration is just another free trade debate. Free trade is hard for most people to understand, so I use extrapolation to explain it. If trade barriers are good, then why not have more of them? Start off stopping trade between all states in America. Then stop all trade between different cities in each state. You could even stop labor from crossing bridges within cities. You could then stop all trade between all communities. By extrapolating, you approach a point of absurdity, which proves that trade barriers, including immigration barriers, hurt the economy overall. The logic is for the supply of labor to meet the demand, to sell labor at world market rates.      According to the those at Yahoo Answers calling for increased restrictions on immigration, including illegal immigration, immigration is restricted to protect the economy.  That's a complete contradiction both with free trade economics and free migration within your own country.  Two mutually exclusive viewpoints cannot both be right.  If social programs bother you so much, get rid of them instead of stopping migration, and don't forget immigrant laborers contribute indirectly by displacing Americans up the wage scale.  Don't expect Lou Dobbs to tell you that on his misleading show.      I've answered enough of your illegal immigration answers to know that the vision many of you have of everyone in the world just stuck where they are born is not an economic rationale because it goes against free trade economics.        The worst offender is Japan with practically no immigration, and I've read many articles calling for U.S. immigration going from 900 000/year to 300 000/year on the basis that only 3 groups should immigrate:  the political refugees, families reunifying, and the highly skilled sought by head hunters.  That leaves out 90something % of Canadians even though they are indistinguishable from Americans??? That also means 90something % of the U.S. voters responsible for such legislation would never qualify to immigrate to their own country!  Makes no sense.      I searched; this question has not been posted before.  Stick to the fundamentals, and don't cherry pick the issue or else you might end up quacking like a duck like Lou Dobbs.  Heheheh      The U.S. has 300 million people migrating freely, so the evidence is job and housing markets can self-regulate where labor goes.

I'm planning to join the army as persian interpreter(09L) which is in high demand so I'm definitely gonna deploy soon after AIT.OK so lets say I first get stationed in somewhere in America with my chosen unit and the unit deploys at a certain time.when I come back,will they send me to another unit that is deploying soon because of the army's needs or will I still stay with my unit even though it will redeploy a year after coming back from deployment?my plan is to join around fall '10.   the reason that I'm asking this Q is that I've already spent 8 years of my life in iran so I'm not really interested in going back to the middle east(afghanistan) for 3-4 years  together.but don't forget,I wanna serve my country but still like to stay in USA as much as possible because of what I've been through.   Thanks folks.

I’m writing an essay about a constitution and I can’t grasp the concept of why the USA is a federal state but not the UK?      The dictionary says this about federal:  fed·eral / ?

I’m reading something that says Parliament in the Uk could suspend devolving powers such as for Scotland and it’s a reason why the UK isn’t a federal state.  The book says, for a federal system to be established a written constitution  would be necessary, limiting powers of the Westminster parliament and preventing it from taking back the devolved powers into it’s own hands.        In a federal state, wouldn’t the central government also be able to do that? What does the central government do in a federal state, if the states are supposed to be controlled by it, but the book says it can’t do the same thing as Westminster parliament?       If parliament can suspend powers, then  doesn’t that make the UK the defintion of federal, where parliament is the central government? If Parliament is sovereign, then doesn’t that make it the central government in a federal state?       I’m tired and trying to read a lot before a tutorial tomorrow and I need to know the difference?       Could somebody explain the difference in an easy to understand way, so I can grasp the subject?

20090227174258AACA6rx	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Do they have the right to charge this bill?	My story is that LA Times have been calling endlessly for my sister since last month, accusing her of subscribing to their newspaper. This is unusual because my sister lives in Northern California, whereas I live in Southern California., and she doesn't read the newspaper or have ever subscribed to one. I asked my sister about this, and she said she never subscribed to it. The bill that they sent didn't show the cycle for the month of January (which was the month they've been calling) but the bill shows for the period of February. I assumed it was a bill to continue the newspaper. On top of that, they misspelled our last name greatly. I confronted the lady on the phone, saying my sister doesn't live around here, she said they ship the newspaper internationally, too; which did not make any sense to me at all. I asked her to spell my sister's last name, which was incorrect. She said that it's a typo on their part, and that my sister did subscribe. She was rude and said "I don't know why you don't want to pay your own bill. I'll call back later for her." Even though I repeatedly told her my sister doesn't live down here, and she hung up on me. My question is, do they have the right to charge a bill to an unexpected person, whose last name is spelled completely wrong, and to a person who didn't even subscribed to it? I would think that my sister would be able to spell her last name correctly. I don't know what to do. The reason I haven't given in to this and just pay it because it's the moral of the issue. But if I have to, I'll pay it just so they can leave us alone.

20061102102512AAMjI6z	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	Revised: Need help and legal advice. Heres the whole story...?	To the new people and the ones who answered this question before:    In October, I was at a concert. My friend talked me into snorting adderall (her prescription drug), telling me that it would give me a high. Normally, I wouldn't go along with it EVER but seeing that we were all drinking and having a good time, for some stupid reason, I went along with it. I have never done anything illegal in my life and being 27, I thought I would make a better judgement call than this but I didnt. Undercover police officers were watching us and took us to their HQ in the concert parking lot. We were issued COUNTY ordinance citations (fine of $426.50) and we were let go, free to go back to the concert grounds. According to them, we got off really easy and I know that we did. What we did was commit a felony. So I am thankful for that. But I obviously regret that night and have definately learned my lesson. My court date is coming up and I need help. More to come... Please wait for more info below

I remember one famous incident from about a decade ago when a man stumbled upon his friend molesting a girl in the restroom of a Vegas Casino.      The man walked right back out and went back to the tables.  His friend then came to him and told him that he killed her and the both of them continued with their day and did nothing.      That guy faced no legal penalties for this; but of course faced lots of protests and public scrutiny.      So, legally you don't have to do anything when you witness a crime?

20090225073111AADrKFv	Politics & Government;Politics	What do you think of Ron Paul's reintroduction of the 'Sunlight rule' to make bills reasonably avail b4 votes?	"The night before the stimulus bill was set to be voted on, the finalized copy was posted online. Leaving Congress less than 24 hours to read through and understand over 1,000 pages of legislation -- legislation that would have a huge impact on the American people. This “rush to the roll call” is common, and critics – including Congressman Ron Paul (R-TX) – believe the process doesn’t give legislators enough time to fully understand everything that they were supposed to vote on.       To curb this type of rush voting, Paul has reintroduced legislation known as the Sunlight Rule.       The proposed rule “prohibits any piece of legislation from being brought before the House of Representatives unless it has been available to Members and staff in both print and electronic versions for at least ten days.”      It also sets up guidelines for conference reports and manger’s amendments that make changes to a bill be made available 72 hours before being set to a vote in both print and electronic versions.        Finally, this rule would also give the people direct involvement in its enforcement. In a statement issued by Ron Paul he writes that it would allow “a citizen to move for censure of any House Member who votes for a bill brought to the floor in violation of this act.”

Un juez de Murcia retira la custodia de sus hijas a una lesbiana    .......................   Reuters - lunes, 23 de julio, 17.26MADRID (Reuters) - Un juez de Murcia ha desatado la polémica por una sentencia en la que retira la custodia de sus hijas a una mujer por ser lesbiana, provocando la apertura de expediente al magistrado tras las quejas presentadas por distintos grupos.      El juez de Primera Instancia Fernando Ferrín argumentó su decisión en que la homosexualidad de uno de los progenitores influye negativamente en la educación y crecimiento de las hijas y que el ambiente gay aumenta el riesgo de que los hijos también lo sean.      "La madre tendrá que elegir entre sus hijas o la nueva pareja", dijo el auto del 6 de junio, reproducido por varios medios de comunicación.      Colectivos de gays solicitaron que se actúe contra el juez porque consideran que su sentencia vulnera la Constitución espa?ola.   ( http://es.noticias.yahoo.com/rtrs/200707...

20090225072744AAzRujk	Politics & Government;Other - Politics & Government	Why do America's presidents (the evil ones) not trample this country as much as others?	From studying American history for years, I've learned that the rich elitists, who bribe governors and presidents and the CIA and FBI into doing what they want them to do, trample other countries into poverty and leave only dictators who do what these elite bribers want (which is to allow the bribers to have a mine, farm, or oil drilling facility there, manned by employees who are only given enough wages to survive day by day, or only given poor food and shelter (shelter as in a tarp or something ridiculously cruel like that). The elitists also use the president to use the military for them.      What I have trouble understanding is, why haven't they been able to crush America, or why don't they use their full power to? I know about the plot by elitists to install a puppet dictator over America in F.D.R.'s place or to have F.D.R. fill that role, but it didn't come true supposedly because the general that they went to for help with this turned on them (but why did they need the general - why didn't they just bribe F.D.R.?, it's not like they needed the general to get F.D.R. to push for war with Japan, he even let Pearl Harbor be bombed). I know the F.B.I. used sneaky means to sabotage the civil rights movement, and the C.I.A. did the same to American communists and socialists in the early days, and later used Tim McVeigh to tarnish the image of the growing American (Military) Patriot (AMP's) groups, but why do they give in? If they have indirect control over our military, why haven't they oppressed America in the same way they did to Haiti and various South American countries? Ironically, it's not as if Russia cares if American's are oppressed, unlike they care about the C.I.A. oppressing others like Cuba or other countries where communists and socialists try to come to power to prevent America from enslaving them. So, why do the elitists abstain from pulling every dirty trick they can pull off in the book to throw down the genuine conservatives?      Could it be one or more of these reasons?:      1) Fear of the conservatives in the military realizing the coup, and turning on them?      2) Fear of conservative citizens using their guns to shoot them, and home-made bombs being used against them?      3) Fear of being fully exposed as monsters, and having no average citizen of any country to love them or write well of them or work for them ever again (like losing their main support base for emotional and high-skilled work).      4) Fear of the God of the Christians becoming angry at "noticing" what the Christians are upset about, and responding by directly fighting against the elitists like he did to the Egyptians when they oppressed Israel?      5) ?

(Chorus)      Still more majestic shalt thou rise,   More dreadful from each foreign stroke,   As the loud blast that tears the skies   Serves but to root thy native oak.      (Chorus)      Thee haughty tyrants ne'er shall tame;   All their attempts to bend thee down   Will but arouse thy generous flame,   But work their woe and thy renown.      (Chorus)      To thee belongs the rural reign;   Thy cities shall with commerce shine;   All thine shall be the subject main,   And every shore it circles, thine.      (Chorus)      The Muses, still with freedom found,   Shall to thy happy coasts repair.   Blest isle! with matchless beauty crowned,   And manly hearts to guard the fair.

My brother is in a "public safety center" because his wife had him arrested for breaking the phone in their house... and she claims that he "grabbed her arms" ONE time but the cops don't have any pictures of where he supposedly hurt her arms. He has a squeaky clean record because he is not an abusive person and would never deliberately hurt anyone, but because she is pressing charges against him for "battery" and for something having to do with the phone, he is sitting in jail right now. He is such a good person and honestly doesn't deserve to be in there with people who beat their wives until they were bloodied up and were threatening to kill them.    My question is, if you have any experience with this can you tell me how long they might make him stay in there? He has a hearing today and I've only been able to talk to him for a minute when he called me, and I'm just wondering what the usual sentence is for things like this or if they will possibly let him go without any sentence or jail time. If you have any advice or knowledge on this, PLEASE tell me because I am really worried about him. Thank you so much for any help or advice you have.

I am looking to go into the police at around 19-20 years old. I know that a reprimand stays on police records until you are 21 so will this effect my chances of getting into the police force?      Also... are reprimands completely deleted from records when I reach 21 or will employers still be able to see this later on in life using an enhanced check?

El  Estado niega esto a los cubanos por el sólo hecho de ser cubanos.

20071124173220AA3tk2U	Politics & Government;Politics	Es este el tipo de "lider" que necesita venezuela?	aqui esta el porque de la agresionde la "asambleista" iris varela al periodista, aqui esta lo que escribio acerca del asunto de su hijo, era necesaria  la golpiza, el avasallamiento, el abuso.  las amenazas de este chusma personaje de la "revolucion " bollivariana?Lean el libro de Azocar y después juzgan. Ahí les mando el texto para que vean que en nada ofende la memoria de su hijo muerto.      " En el Hospital Central de San Cristóbal hay una historia que tiene que ver con la vida de Iris Varela y que puede ser clave para entender su comportamiento, su agresividad, su odio visceral contra algunos sectores políticos de la oposición y su resentimiento. El relato, confirmado por algunos médicos y enfermeras que prefieren mantenerse en el anonimato, refiere que María Iris fue llevada a la sala de partos en el a?o 1992 con un embarazo complicadísimo que, pese al gran esfuerzo de los médicos que estaban de guardia, terminó en tragedia. "Los médicos y las enfermeras hicieron todo cuanto estuvo a su alcance para salvar al bebé. Me consta que se hizo todo cuanto fue posible, pero el parto fue tan difícil y tan complicado, que el ni?o no pudo salvarse. Aguantó dos semanas y luego falleció", dijo una médico tachirense.       La médico contó que María Iris logró dar a luz, pero el bebé nació con demasiadas complicaciones, algunas de ellas congénitas. Lo mantuvieron en terapia intensiva durante quince días, pero los esfuerzos resultaron en vano. María Iris entró en cólera cuando los galenos le informaron que el ni?o había muerto.       Aquella noche inundó de maldiciones la sala de partos del Hospital Central de San Cristóbal yjuró que se vengaría de todos los que estaban allí presentes. "Tratamos de explicarle que las condiciones del ni?o eran muy dificiles, que las posibilidades de que el ni?o viviera eran mínimas, pero ella no escuchó. Toda la noche profirió maldiciones contra cada uno de nosotros. Nos mentó la madre como mil veces y cuando abandonó el hospital al día siguiente, juró que la pagaríamos con nuestra propia sangre".

Porque siguen diciendo que el liberalismo les permite hablar de lo que quieren, entrar y salir cuando quieren de su pais, etc, etc. Y que la izquierda se ha encargado de torturar, matar, reprimir, etc, etc.      Amen de que esto no es verdad (quiero ver como entran y salen cuando quieren en EEUU siendo latinoamericanos), y de que el pais del "sue?o Americano" se paso todo el siglo XX y ahora en el principio del nuevo siglo invadiendo paises y matando gente inocente, me gustaria ver si entienden una cosa.      Les voy a aclarar como a ni?os de 6 a?os: El socialismo es una ideologia que procura que, en lugar de que el trabajador tenga que generar valor (plusvalor) para un empresario que indefectiblemente tiene mas poder y que cada vez tendra mas poder que la clase trabajadora, este sea due?o de todo el sistema productivo y los recursos se repartan en forma aproximadamente equitativa de modo que las necesidades basicas esten cubiertas.      ?Entienden que no hay nada de violencia ni represion en eso?

20071030113023AAfFnp0	Politics & Government;Elections	?Porque no dar en concesión el Metro de Bogotá para obtener los recursos para su construcción y operación?	Hablando del tema, después de las elecciones, sobre si es real o no la posibilidad de construir el metro para Bogotá, y de la posición del gobierno de que no existen los recursos para este proyecto, es importante, mirar que otras opciones de financiación se podrían encontrar para comenzar su construcción.    Solo oímos decir que no hay plata, o que pensar en el metro es  creer en propuestas falsas,  poco viables  y/o utópicas.  Pero por ejemplo, dar en  concesión su construcción y operación por cierto periodo de tiempo, no podría ser una respuesta. Si se han dado otras obras vitales, como el aeropuerto, ?porque no el metro de Bogotá?    Si se sabe que ha existido el interés de varios  grupos económicos  extranjeros (como el poco conocido consorcio japonés que nadie parece recordar, que proponía construir y operar un metro en Bogotá por cerca de 20 a?os, sin que  le costara un peso al distrito o a la nación), ?Por qué no hacerlo?
