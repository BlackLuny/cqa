So it seems that the starter stud indented (embedded?) my earlobe on the right ear (this lobe has always been thicker than the other).  I had no problems removing the old earrings or inserting the new ones in either ear.  Is this a problem?  Will it return to normal now that the pressure is relieved?      I was planning on continuing to sleep in the starter studs because i read somewhere that their post is thicker than other post-earrings (they look the same but i can believe it's only a tiny bit different).        Is there nothing to worry about?  The new earrings felt weird at first, but i guessed that was because they were new and possibly heavier than the starter studs.

I like the fit of guy's ones, the girls ones don't fit me quite right.      Also, I wear a medium in Hanes tees. What would the equivalent of that size be in the tees you're suggesting? It's okay if you have no Idea...I'll figure it out if you don't know.       Thank you!   Moe

And then I started wearing beads, you know like those small necklace beads that are commonly worn.Well they went out of fashion at school since last year, I started wearing them for like a week or so, then everybody else started again.    And now, I barley just got my hair done a dark auburn.Nobody else had it that color there, and now there's a girl with the same hair color, except for the highlights I had.      My last question I asked WHY they were copying me.I got rude answers.But I don't really care obiously their immature people.I didn't say I was great or anything, I'm just saying that for some reason I influence some people to wear or do certain things and then it goes on and on and it becomes a fad.    HOW do I stop people from doing that?I mean I flat out got told by a girl that she was going to do the exact same hair color as me, I do get flattered.But i want something thats MINE.

I want my hair to look like this:       http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j131/T...       I have thee right hair type and length.  Without any product,  my hair is just lays flat on my head and then curls out around the ears...it looks pretty bad.  since it is so flat to my head and curls out, it looks like a bell.       What I do is put Garnier Fructis Surf Hair product in my hair (a lot of it) and then mess it up for a while. This makes it less flat to my head and makes strands of hair.        Then I pull the hair around my ears out in front, and then push the hair on top back-ish (just so it curves backward).  This seems to get the best shape.        Anyway, this takes a bit of time.  Is there another better product I can get from a walmart or something.

20090131172249AAO84if	Beauty & Style;Makeup	How do you put on eyeliner!?!?!?	I usually put on dark brown crayon under my eyes, and liquid liner (black) on top of my eyes. Im fine with how i putit on top of my eyes, but I HATE how I do it under my eyes. My mom doesnt know how, and none of my friends really wear makeup. All of the girls at my school that do wear makeup put on WAY too much of it, and wouldnt be able to give me much  good advice. I see women and girls everyday wearing eyeliner that looks nice and subtle, but you can still tell that theyre wearing it. (which i like) I just want a more subtle look that is easy to put on.      (Just to let you know, im really pressed for time in the morning, and I dont really like to wear a lot of  makeup at all, I just look like I havent slept for days if I dont . Just a thought)

20090131180655AAApoj6	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	I just bought a pair of light cream/winter white pants froom Ann Taylor.  What color?	shoes should I wear with them.  For example if I am wearing a red, green or blue top what color shoes should I wear?  Wouldn't black or brown shoes look weird?

A few friends of mine are throwing a costume party for valentines day with the theme of "man am i glad I'm not a _________".  So basically, you dress up as whatever you are really happy your not.  Well me and a bunch of the guys were all hanging out and joking about what we should be when someone had the wise idea that he was glad he wasn't a woman.  We decided one of us had to do it, and I drew the short straw.       Basically, I need suggestions on what I should wear- clothes wise, make up wise, and how to fill out feminine clothing... we've decided that I'm going to actually try to look like a girl/young woman (I am 18 after all) rather than try to look like a guy in drag, so I need some actual advice, not just to put on a skirt and go.

Literally this entire week, I've thought about him half the day. I picture us being together, and I start to hope that he likes me back, you know?      And I can't really make it a possibility, because I do see him pretty much a lot, but i can't talk to him. (he's working at a pizza place, and my dad's office is next to that place. so i only see him for like a split second) And when I do go into that store, my brother's with me. (he's my older brother's friend, so they talk somewhat. and i only see him when we're ordering food from there, which is not often) so i can't talk to him/flirt much at all. (brother is WAY overprotective)      so how do i do it? i just want to forget all about him, because i know there's no way we can actually be together.

During the 1960's some African American women never straightened their hair because of the black power movement and how straightening black natural hair was looked down upon? Why are there more and more black women straightening their hair with harmful chemicals to make themselves look like they have white hair? (The reason I called it white hair is because I don't believe in the so-called good hair bad hair phrase.)      Who says and thinks that straightening hair makes a black woman look better? cause obviously somebody's saying it or else it wouldn't be happening as often.       I am a black man by the way

So my older sister and brother got gauges a couple of years ago, and yes, ill admit i did think they were wierd. I mean holes in your ears that are visible. But as time went on I started to like them. My sister would were ones where you couldnt see through them but my brother on the other hand wore ones where you can see through his ears. The thing i dislike about them is that, you have to take them out for work. which Isn't the pretties thing you see.  To get to my point I got them them done not to long ago(obviously) and I didn't know if people would like them. And my friends sure didnt. Theyire not even that big, they're a 10. and i could close them up if I wanted too. (im ranting on again)  Anywho;  my real question is,  Do guys like girls with gauges/plugs?  or  Does anyone in general like them on another person?

I'm open to any drugstore brand ,except for Pantene, Dove, and Suave/V05.  I'm familiar with ALL the brands + names (its kinda of sickly :/), but if you posted both, that'd be great!      Oh, it doesn't have to be clarifying.  Just something that'll clean well (aka, can clean through all the sand!), but I assume that's clarifying.  I'd really like something that would moisturize.

20090226085918AABbMQC	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Other - Skin & Body	What's the normal healing process for an inner-conch piercing?	I got my inner conch piercing 5 days ago (right ear).        I already have left-side rook piercing, right-side tragus piercing, couple of lobes and a helix, so I pretty much thought I knew what to expect.        I'm also pretty good with piercings - they normally heal quickly, with little pain (if any), and with no problems after that - the only exception being my rook, which took a little longer than the others, but expected that).       Now, however - ooowwwww! My conch is killing me! It's swollen, tender, and causing pain in one side of my head - feel like I'm being a baby, but sort of after reassurance that this is kind of normal?!? And if not - what can I do to make it stop..?!      There's no sign of infection - and I really trust my piercist so it's not like I went somewhere dodgy - just can't understand why yesterday, it was fine - and today, I'm in ear agony?!?       The only thing I can think of it's that I've put too much salt in my saline solution, which has irritated it? Never had this problem before - are these piercings renowned for being a bit of a b**ch to heal?       Any suggestions - from people with something relevant to say, without meaning to sound nasty! - would be appreciated.        Thanks for your help!       J

I love stores like Urban Outfitters.Forever 21.Hollister.Abercrombie&Fitch...yeah you get it.   and i love things that are sexy but not skanky.   and really like things that are classy!   and just really cute and fun!   i love patterns.   i hate neon colors...   yeah and just something that you would imagine that's flattering to a thin figure with a small bust.      thanks.:)
