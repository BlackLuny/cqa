It looks like an oem build....go with the best single graphics card you can afford...do not double up on sub-par cards thinking that they will deliver great performance, cause they will not.

The case is what holds all of the parts, including the CD drive, and has the power button and usb ports etc.  Inside the case, everything is connected to the motherboard.<br>  <br>  And yes, you can get plenty for much less than that.  Motherboards can range from less than $100 to around $350 for a really good one.  Cases can be as cheap as $50 and go way up from there.  But you can get a nice motherboard (you'll probably also need a new CPU) for under $500.

Only thing, you'll have to keep funds on that card to use checkout.|`|ILK3FlD1aa	Ah, yes I remeber the days of not having a credit card.  The best solution is to register a paypal account.  It's accepted by pretty much all online transactions, it's free to sign up, and you don't have to give out your bank info online.  All you do is set up your paypal account, and add it as a biller to your online banking, then just send as much money as you need into your paypal account from your online banking.  It's sort of like an online Tim card (you wouldn't know what that is unless you're Canadian).

8gnp5Kkjaa	Vista has a built-in email program called Windows Mail.  You have to set up your email account in there if it is a POP account.  (For example if your ISP is Verizon and you have an email address of suchandsuch@verizon.net then you can set up that email address in Windows Mail.)<br>  <br>  Obviously if you have a Hotmail, Yahoo, Gmail, or other web-based email account then you can just go to the respective site, log in, and check your mail without having to set anything up.<br>  <br>  To set up an account in Windows Mail you need to know your ISPs incoming (POP3) and outgoing (SMTP) server names as well as your username and password.  Once you have that information then start Windows Mail and if the setup wizard does not begin automatically then do the following:<br>  <br>  1. Click the Tools menu and then click Accounts.<br>  2. In the window that appears, click the Add button on the right.<br>  3. Select Email Account from the list and click Next.<br>  4. Type your name in the Display Name field and click Next.<br>  5. Type your email address in the box and click Next.<br>  6. This window needs you to enter the incoming and outgoing server names that you should have gotten from your ISP.  After you've done that, click Next.<br>  7. Enter your email username (which is usually just the first part of your email address before the @ symbol) and your password in this window and then click Next.<br>  8. Now you click Finish and you're done.

Higher resolution would ensure clarity when enlarged. It's because you have more dots per inch and so less space between the dots when the pic is bigger.|`|GpgECd1Iaa	If it's line art, then yes, 300 DPI will print MUCH better than 72 DPI - you can definitely try that yourself. The quality of line art won't be affected by DPI increase - only bitmaps will, if there are any. <br>  <br>  When you increase resolution (DPI) in Photoshop, it keeps the same image size IN INCHES, but increases number of pixels PER INCH. So that 5x10 inch image at 72 DPI, for example, will take  360x720 pixels, while the same 5x10 image at 300 DPI will take 1500x3000 PIXELS. <br>  <br>  The quality won't be necessarily noticeable in Photoshop line art, but it makes huge different in printing, because modern printers have much higher resolution than any computer screen.<br>  <br>  Printer operates with paper of concrete size - in inches/centimeters, so the more pixels it has available for that image, the sharper it will look.

(might be overheating or something).<br>  <br>  If you don't see the same lockup behavior with another monitor, then the issue is with your Aquos.

isadV8SHaa	It depends on what operating system you are running.  You need a 64-bit operating system to be able to recognize that much memory.  And even if it did recognize it, you would see almost no difference over the 3Gigs that you have.  3Gig is plenty.<br>  <br>  reply to additional details:<br>  The 8Gig max listed is the maximum that the hardware will recognize.  You still won't see much over your 3 because of the 32 bit OS.<br>  <br>  The scanner you ran shows that your memory slots are full.  You have two slots available, and each of them has a memory bank installed in it.

Il testo ufficiale della licenza è disponibile all'URL <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html</a> , mentre all'URL <a href="http://www.softwarelibero.it/gnudoc/gpl.it.txt" rel="nofollow">http://www.softwarelibero.it/gnudoc/gpl....</a> è disponibile la traduzione non ufficiale in italiano.<br>  <br>  Viene spesso indicata con l'acronimo GNU GPL o (quando non c'è il rischio di confondersi con un'altra "General Public License") semplicemente GPL. Per evitare un errore alquanto comune, si tenga presente che GPL non significa Gnu Public License.<br>  <br>  La GNU GPL è stata scritta da Richard Stallman e Eben Moglen nel 1989 la versione 1.0 e nel 1991 la versione 2.0, per distribuire i programmi creati dal Progetto GNU. è basata su una licenza simile usata per le prime versioni di GNU Emacs. Contrapponendosi alle licenze per software proprietario, la GNU GPL permette all'utente libertà di utilizzo, copia, modifica e distribuzione; a partire dalla sua creazione è diventata una delle licenze per software libero più usate. Attualmente è in corso di definizione da parte della FSF la terza versione della GPL.<br>  <br>  Termini della licenza<br>  <br>  Quanto segue è un riassunto dei termini della licenza. L'unica descrizione legalmente precisa, in ogni caso, è quella del testo della licenza stessa.<br>  <br>  Il testo della GNU GPL è disponibile per chiunque riceva una copia di un software coperto da questa licenza. I licenziatari (da qui in poi indicati come "utenti") che accettano le sue condizioni hanno la possibilità di modificare il software, di copiarlo e ridistribuirlo con o senza modifiche, sia gratuitamente sia a pagamento. Quest'ultimo punto distingue la GNU GPL dalle licenze che proibiscono la ridistribuzione commerciale.<br>  <br>  Se l'utente distribuisce copie del software, deve rendere disponibile il codice sorgente a ogni acquirente, incluse tutte le modifiche eventualmente effettuate (questa caratteristica è detta copyleft). Nella pratica, i programmi sotto GNU GPL vengono spesso distribuiti allegando il loro codice sorgente, anche se la licenza non lo richiede. Ci sono casi in cui viene distribuito solo il codice sorgente, lasciando all'utente il compito di compilarlo.<br>  <br>  L'utente è tenuto a rendere disponibile il codice sorgente solo alle persone che hanno ricevuto da lui la copia del programma o, in alternativa, accompagnare il software con una offerta scritta di rendere disponibile il sorgente su richiesta e per il solo costo della copia. Questo significa, ad esempio, che è possibile creare versioni private di un software sotto GNU GPL, a patto che tale versione non venga distribuita a qualcun altro. Questo accade quando l'utente crea delle modifiche private al software ma non lo distribuisce: in questo caso non è tenuto a rendere pubbliche le modifiche.<br>  <br>  Dato che il software è protetto da copyright, l'utente non ha altro diritto di modifica o ridistribuzione al di fuori dalle condizioni di copyleft. In ogni caso, l'utente deve accettare i termini della GNU GPL solo se desidera esercitare diritti normalmente non contemplati dalla legge sul copyright, come la ridistribuzione. Al contrario, se qualcuno distribuisce un software (in particolare, versioni modificate) senza rendere disponibile il codice sorgente o violando in altro modo la licenza, può essere denunciato dall'autore originale secondo le stesse leggi sul copyright. è un intelligente cavillo legale, ed è per questo che la GNU GPL è stata descritta come un "copyright hack". La licenza specifica anche che il diritto illimitato di ridistribuzione non è garantito, in quanto potrebbero essere trovate delle debolezze legali (o "bug") all'interno della definizione di copyleft.<br>  <br>  <br>  Detentori del Copyright<br>  <br>  La Free Software Foundation (FSF) detiene i diritti di copyright per il testo della GNU GPL, ma non detiene i diritti del software rilasciato con questa licenza. A meno che venga emessa una specifica nota di copyright da parte della FSF, l'autore del software detiene i diritti di copyright per il suo lavoro, ed è responsabile di perseguire ogni violazione della licenza riguardante il suo software.<br>  <br>  In caso di violazione della licenza il detentore del copyright è l'unico che può richiederne il rispetto nei termini di legge ed è l'unico che può chiedere aiuto alla FSF per la protezione di tale software, quest'ultima può intervenire solo se è il detentore del copyright a richiederne il suo aiuto. La FSF, normalmente, mette a disposizione i suoi legali per proteggere il software coperto da una licenza GNU, chiedendo in un primo tempo il rispetto della licenza e solo se tale richiesta non viene accettata si arriva al tribunale.<br>  <br>  A differenza dei software con essa distribuiti, la GNU GPL non è liberamente modificabile: copiarla e distribuirla è permesso, ma modificarla è vietato.

Call the manufacturer and see if they sell it for a reasonable price.  (Not the recovery CD, the Windows installation CD.)<br>  <br>  If not, now may be the time to think of switching to Linux - it's free, and you can download an image and burn a CD any time you want, for the cost of a blank CD (about 14 cents).  Ubuntu is a nice distribution, and Puppy will run on just about anything.  (It's the same Linux, the difference is in the desktop and what else comes already bundled, although you can always download everything yourself - 99.9% of linux programs are free.)<br>  <br>  80GB is plenty of room for a Linux installation, and it runs well even on older computers.

Once the download is complete you have to sync them into iTunes and then while you connect the iPod it will automatically synchronise the music videos(this will happen only if you have enabled "Automatically update songs and playlists " option in iTunes preferences, If u have enabled :"Manually manage songs and playlists" and "automatically sync videos into the iPod" option then you may have to manually drag the music video file on the iPod icon in iTunes source list)<br>  <br>  Its also important to confirm the video file type which you would like to sync into the iPod as iPod only supports m4v or mp4 video formats.<br>  <br>  Thats all I have..<br>  <br>  Good Luck

It sounds like a firewall issue; check the "sharing" system prefs, click the "firewall" tab, check to make sure that the firewall is turned off, then try logging on again.

I never tried it, but it's in the book "HTML & XHTML: The Definitive Guide, 4th Edition" by Bill Kennedy, Chuck Musciano.  I looked it up in ebook form because I have access to some ebooks with my ACM membership.

After executing the mailto form, the user is left looking at the form, as if nothing had happened. (Use JavaScript to overcome this dilemma with an onSubmit or onClick event handler.) Section 12.3.3<br>      *<br>  <br>        Your data may arrive in a form that is difficult, if not impossible, to read, unless you use a readable enctype, such as text/plain.<br>      *<br>  <br>        You will lose whatever security protections that may have been provided by the server with the form. <br>  <br>  """<br>  <br>  I assume you know how to write forms otherwise, though.

AA10066136	term Web server can mean one of two things:<br>  <br>  A computer that is responsible for accepting HTTP requests from clients, which are known as Web browsers, and serving them Web pages, which are usually HTML documents and linked objects (images, etc.). <br>  A computer program that provides the functionality described in the first sense of the term. <br>  <br>  <br>  Common features<br>  Although Web server programs differ in detail, they all share some basic common features.<br>  <br>  HTTP responses to HTTP requests: every Web server program operates by accepting HTTP requests from the network, and providing an HTTP response to the requester. The HTTP response typically consists of an HTML document, but can also be a raw text file, an image, or some other type of document; if something bad is found in client request or while trying to serve the request, a Web server has to send an error response which may include some custom HTML or text messages to better explain the problem to end users. <br>  Logging: usually Web servers have also the capability of logging some detailed information, about client requests and server responses, to log files; this allows the Webmaster to collect statistics by running log analyzers on log files. <br>  In practice many Web servers implement the following features too.<br>  <br>  Configurability of available features by configuration files or even by an external user interface. <br>  Authentication, optional authorization request (request of user name and password) before allowing access to some or all kind of resources. <br>  Handling of not only static content (file content recorded in server's filesystem(s)) but of dynamic content too by supporting one or more related interfaces (SSI, CGI, SCGI, FastCGI, PHP, ASP, ASP .NET, Server API such as NSAPI, ISAPI, etc.). <br>  Module support, in order to allow the extension of server capabilities by adding or modifying software modules which are linked to the server software or that are dynamically loaded (on demand) by the core server. <br>  HTTPS support (by SSL or TLS) in order to allow secure (encrypted) connections to the server on the standard port 443 instead of usual port 80. <br>  Content compression (i.e. by gzip encoding) to reduce the size of the responses (to lower bandwidth usage, etc.). <br>  Virtual Host to serve many web sites using one IP address. <br>  Large file support to be able to serve files whose size is greater than 2 GB on 32 bit OS. <br>  Bandwidth throttling to limit the speed of responses in order to not saturate the network and to be able to serve more clients. <br>  [edit]<br>  Origin of returned content<br>  The origin of the content sent by server is called:<br>  <br>  static if it comes from an existing file lying on a filesystem; <br>  dynamic if it is dynamically generated by some other program or script or API called by the Web server. <br>  Serving static content is usually much faster (from 2 to 100 times) than serving dynamic content, especially if the latter involves data pulled from a database.<br>  <br>  [edit]<br>  Path translation<br>  Web servers usually translate the path component of a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) into a local file system resource. The URL path specified by the client is relative to the Web server's root directory.<br>  <br>  Consider the following URL as it would be requested by a client:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.example.com/path/file.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.example.com/path/file.html</a><br>  The client's Web browser will translate it into a connection to www.example.com with the following HTTP 1.1 request:<br>  <br>  GET /path/file.html HTTP/1.1<br>  Host: www.example.com<br>  The Web server on www.example.com will append the given path to the path of its root directory. On Unix machines, this is commonly /var/www/htdocs. The result is the local file system resource:<br>  <br>  /var/www/htdocs/path/file.html<br>  The Web server will then read the file, if it exists, and send a response to the client's Web browser. The response will describe the content of the file and contain the file itself.<br>  <br>  [edit]<br>  Concurrency<br>  Web servers (programs) often use concurrent programming techniques, sometime even in combination with finite state machines and non-blocking I/O, to increase the responsiveness and the scalability of the server when providing pages to multiple clients simultaneously.<br>  <br>  These techniques are useful not only to reduce response latencies in the common cases (i.e. disk I/O waits, non cached accesses, etc.) but also to fully deploy some hardware capabilities, such as:<br>  <br>  multi-microprocessors (multi-CPUs); <br>  multi-core microprocessors; <br>  multi-disks (many disk I/O subsystems, see Disk storage); <br>  etc. <br>  [edit]<br>  Server Models<br>  A webserver program, as any other server, can be implemented by using one of these server models:<br>  <br>  single process, finite state machine and non blocking or even asynchronous I/O; <br>  multi process, finite state machine and non blocking or even asynchronous I/O; <br>  single process, forking a new process for each request; <br>  multi process, with adaptive pre-forking of processes; <br>  single process, multithreaded; <br>  multi process, multithreaded. <br>  The following sub-chapters summarize pros and contras of the main various models.<br>  <br>  [edit]<br>  Finite state machine servers<br>  To minimize the context switches and to maximize the scalability, many small webservers are implemented as a single process (or at most as a process per CPU) and a finite state machine. Every task is split into two or more small steps that are executed as needed (typically on demand); by keeping the internal state of each connection and by using non-blocking I/O or asynchronous I/O, it is possible to implement ultra fast web servers, at least for serving static content.<br>  <br>  [edit]<br>  Threaded-based servers<br>  Many web servers are multithreaded. This means that inside each server's process, there are two or more threads, each one able to execute its own task independently from the others.<br>  <br>  When a user visits a web site, a web server will use a thread to serve the page to that user. If another user visits the site while the previous user is still being served, the web server can serve the second visitor by using a different thread. Thus, the second user does not have to wait for the first visitor to be served. This is very important because not all users have the same speed Internet connection. A slow user should not delay all other visitors from downloading a web page.<br>  <br>  Threads are often used to serve dynamic content.<br>  <br>  For better performance, threads used by web servers and other Internet services are typically pooled and reused to eliminate even the small overhead associated with creating a thread.<br>  <br>  [edit]<br>  Process-based servers<br>  For reliability and security reasons, some web servers using multiple processes (rather than multiple threads within a single process) still remain in production use, such as Apache 1.3.<br>  <br>  A pool of processes are used, and reused, until a certain threshold of requests have been served by a process before it is replaced by a new one.<br>  <br>  Because threads share a main process context, a crashing thread may more easily crash the whole application, and a buffer overflow can have more disastrous consequences.<br>  <br>  Moreover, a memory leak in system libraries which are out of the control of the application programmer cannot be dealt with using threads, but are appropriately dealt with using a pool of processes with a limited life time (because OS automatically frees all the allocated memory, requested by a process, when the process dies).<br>  <br>  Another problem relates to the wide variety of third party libraries which might be used by an application (a PHP extension library for instance) which might not be thread safe.<br>  <br>  Using multiple processes also allows to deal with situations which can benefit from privilege separation techniques to achieve better security and to work around some OS limits which very often are per-process.<br>  <br>  [edit]<br>  Mixed model servers<br>  To leverage the advantages of finite state machines, threads and processes, many webservers implement a mixture of all these programming techniques, trying to use the best model for each task (i.e. for serving static or dynamic content, etc.).<br>  <br>  [edit]<br>  Load Limits<br>  A web server (program) has defined load limits, because it can handle only a limited number of concurrent client connections (usually between 2 and 60,000, by default between 500 and 1,000) per IP address (and IP port) and it can serve only a certain maximum number of requests per second depending on:<br>  <br>  its own settings; <br>  the HTTP request type; <br>  content origin (static or dynamic); <br>  the fact that the served content is or is not cached; <br>  the hardware and software limits of the OS where it is working. <br>  When a web server is near to or over its limits, it becomes overloaded and thus unresponsive.<br>  <br>  [edit]<br>  Overload Causes<br>  At any time web servers can be overloaded because of:<br>  <br>  too much legal web traffic (i.e. thousands or even millions of clients hitting the web site in a short interval of time); <br>  illegal DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks; <br>  Internet slowdowns, so that client requests are served more slowly and the number of connections increases so much that server limits are reached; <br>  web servers (computers) partial unavailability, this can happen because of required / urgent maintenance or upgrade, HW or SW failures, back-end (i.e. DB) failures, etc.; in these cases the remaining web servers get too much traffic and of course they become overloaded. <br>  [edit]<br>  Overload Symptoms<br>  The symptoms of an overloaded Web server are:<br>  <br>  requests are served with noticeably (long) delays (from 1 second to a few hundreds of seconds); <br>  500, 503 HTTP errors are returned to clients (sometimes also unrelated 404 error may be returned); <br>  TCP connections are refused or reset before any content is sent to clients. <br>  [edit]<br>  Anti Overload Techniques<br>  To partially overcome above load limits and to prevent the overload scenario, most popular Web sites use common techniques like:<br>  <br>  deploying Web cache techniques; <br>  using different domain names to serve different (static and dynamic) content by separate Web servers, i.e.: <br>  <a href="http://images.example.com" rel="nofollow">http://images.example.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.example.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.example.com</a><br>  using many Web servers (programs) per computer, each one bound to its own network card and IP address; <br>  using many Web servers (computers) that are grouped together so that they act or are seen as one big Web server, see also: Load balancer; <br>  adding more HW resources (i.e. RAM, disks) to each computer; <br>  tuning OS parameters for HW capabilities and usage; <br>  using more efficient computer programs for web servers, etc.; <br>  using other workarounds, specially if dynamic content is involved. <br>  [edit]<br>  Historical note<br>   <br>  This NeXTcube used by Berners-Lee at CERN became the first Web server.In 1989 Tim Berners-Lee proposed to his employer CERN (European center for nuclear research) a new project, which had the goal of easing the exchange of information between scientists by using a hypertext system. As a result of the implementation of this project, Berners-Lee wrote two programs: a browser called WorldWideWeb and the world's first Web server, which ran on NeXTSTEP. Today, this machine is on exhibition at CERN's public museum, Microcosm.<br>  <br>  [edit]<br>  Software<br>  The four top most common Web or HTTP server programs are:<br>  <br>  Apache HTTP Server from the Apache Software Foundation. <br>  Internet Information Services (IIS) from Microsoft. <br>  Sun Java System Web Server from Sun Microsystems, formerly Sun ONE Web Server, iPlanet Web Server, and Netscape Enterprise Server. <br>  Zeus Web Server from Zeus Technology. <br>  There are thousands of different Web server programs available, many of them are specialized for some uses and can be tailored to satisfy specific needs.<br>  <br>  See Category:Web server software for a longer list of HTTP server programs.<br>  <br>  [edit]<br>  Statistics<br>  The most popular Web servers, used for public Web sites, are tracked by Netcraft Web Server Survey, with details given by Netcraft Web Server Reports.<br>  <br>  The Apache HTTP Server Project is an effort to develop and maintain an open-source HTTP server for modern operating systems including UNIX and Windows NT. The goal of this project is to provide a secure, efficient and extensible server that provides HTTP services in sync with the current HTTP standards.<br>  <br>  Apache has been the most popular Web server on the Internet since April of 1996. The November 2005 Netcraft Web Server Survey found that more than 70% of the Web sites on the Internet are using Apache, thus making it more widely used than all other Web servers combined. The Apache HTTP Server is a project of the Apache Software Foundation<br>  <br>  Another site provide statistics is SecuritySpace: [1] and they also provide a detail break down for each version of Web server: [2]|`|6adf3b8e07988bb94ace992c9a4d29f5aa	A computer that delivers (serves up) Web pages. Every Web server has an IP address and possibly a domain name. For example, if you enter the URL <a href="http://www.pcwebopedia.com/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.pcwebopedia.com/index.html</a> in your browser, this sends a request to the server whose domain name is pcwebopedia.com. The server then fetches the page named index.html and sends it to your browser. <br>  Any computer can be turned into a Web server by installing server software and connecting the machine to the Internet. There are many Web server software applications, including public domain software from NCSA and Apache, and commercial packages from Microsoft, Netscape and others.

The only way for you to speed up performance on your drive is by............ DEFRAGGING. Try using 3rd party software for defragging, it might help you out more.  Also load less stuff during startup, it'll make your computer as a whole, faster.|`|AA11976371	Check whether "Enable write caching on the disk" is enabled in Device Manager (System properties->Hardware->Device Manager). If it is not enabled, enable it. This does not actually increase the speed of writing, but due to caching, it looks so, such that your computer performance seems to be better.

Imagine a water pipe.  <br>  <br>  Bandwidth is the size of the pipe.  The bigger the pipe, the more water flows through (the bigger the bandwidth, the more data flows through).  <br>  <br>  Frequency is the water pressure.  High pressure-- lots of water (high frequency, lots of data) Low pressure-- a trickle of water (low frequency, a trickle of data).|`|6adf3b8e07988bb94ace992c9a4d29f5aa	1) In electronic communication, bandwidth is the width of the range (or band) of frequencies that an electronic signal uses on a given transmission medium. In this usage, bandwidth is expressed in terms of the difference between the highest-frequency signal component and the lowest-frequency signal component. Since the frequency of a signal is measured in hertz (the number of cycles of change per second), a given bandwidth is the difference in hertz between the highest frequency the signal uses and the lowest frequency it uses. A typical voice signal has a bandwidth of approximately three kilohertz (3 kHz); an analog television (TV) broadcast video signal has a bandwidth of six megahertz (6 MHz) -- some 2,000 times as wide as the voice signal.<br>  <br>  2) In computer networks, bandwidth is often used as a synonym for data transfer rate - the amount of data that can be carried from one point to another in a given time period (usually a second). This kind of bandwidth is usually expressed in bits (of data) per second (bps). Occasionally, it's expressed as bytes per second (Bps). A modem that works at 57,600 bps has twice the bandwidth of a modem that works at 28,800 bps. In general, a link with a high bandwidth is one that may be able to carry enough information to sustain the succession of images in a video presentation.<br>  <br>  It should be remembered that a real communications path usually consists of a succession of links, each with its own bandwidth. If one of these is much slower than the rest, it is said to be a bandwidth bottleneck.|`|AA12275270	frequancy = 1/bandwidth

Both of the models will have the similar specifications like hard drive, DVD burner. The advantage of the x60s over the x60 is that it will be thinner and lighter. The only disadvantage to the x60s will be using a ultra low voltage processors either a choice of single or dual cores which means less power or speed on your laptop.

Go to Edit<br>  4. then Find<br>  <br>  type in "mp3" and let's hope thats the song you're looking for.<br>  <br>  5. take note of the code around the mp3 file.<br>  <br>  it should look something like <br>  <embed allowScriptAccess="never" allowNetworking="internal" enableJavaScript="false" src="http://www.....com\thesong.mp3"       embed style="FILTER: xray" align="top" name="RAOCXplayer" name="RAOCXplayer"  type="audio/mpeg" width="320" height="45" autostart="false"><br>  <br>  Edit: What you want to do is copy this code that's between the brackets (including brackets) and just paste it into your code. make sure to open the argument with "<" and close it with ">". Something you will see a close tag which looks like "</embed>" This would close the embed tag. You don't need it all the time but sometimes you do and you will see different tags like the embed tag. For example, every html document opens with <html> and close with </html>.<br>  <br>  This is what you use to "embed" songs and even videos onto your page. All you really need to make any song play with a simple player is just <embed src ="file location">. You don't need the rest of that stuff. It will give you a simple player to use with easy controls. The code above will give you a black themed Windows player with controls. <br>  <br>  Keep in mind that some songs may be playing from a playlist which is just a text document with the location of numerous songs. The file extension would be .m3u. If you find this, just open it with Notepad and see if you can use the information in that m3u file. Most likely you can but it may not be worth the trouble.

From a warez or "free software" site, it probably isn't (why do you think the programs are free in the first place?)<br>  <br>  "Free software" is not to be confused with "Open Source" software which is safe from a malicious attack perspective.

Getting your web site noticed by Google, Yahoo! and MSN will require some time and effort. <br>  <br>  First of all, I visited your web site and noticed, along with the fact that you misspelled video, that you don't seem to have a theme for your site. What key words are you focusing on? If you advertised; what would your advertisement be? Come visit this new site I just built? And if you spend money on advertising how would you make that money back?<br>  <br>  People search on key words. What key words do you think would best fit your site? Your navigation includes links that go directly to other sites; not your own pages. That will increase the other sites incoming links and reduce your own; another factor moving your site down in the search rankings. <br>  <br>  You also don't own a domain name. The search engines don't give much weight to sub-domain sites; unless they contain a great deal of relevant information about a particular subject.<br>  <br>  My suggestion:<br>  <br>  Decide on focused subjects and build content-filled sites, with their own domains, for each subject. Submit those sites to as many search engines and directories as possible and work on building link partners.

But to experience it completely, you need a better hardware. It's visually very rich than XP and offers more slick, user friendly interface.<br>  <br>  There are other features like RSS feeds, Image Viewer, Windows Easy Transfer, Widgets & New Games which enhances the home user experience.<br>  <br>  It depends mainly on your use of the computer, as a normal Internet user or as a Programmer. For programmers, there wont be much of difference in switching to Vista, but for a Home/Internet user it would be a good Operating System to buy.

Son nom provient de l'arroba, unité de mesure de poids et de capacité autrefois en usage en Espagne et au Portugal (entre 11,5 et 15 kg selon les régions) et qui était désignée par le même symbole @.<br>  <br>  Ce terme vient de l'arabe ????? (?ar-rub?, ? le quart ?)(un quart de quintal, soit 25 livres, poids équivalent à 11,502 kg (12,5 kg en Aragon).). Il servait aussi comme unité de volume pour les liquides, mais la quantité qu'il représentait variait selon les provinces.<br>  <br>  Arroba est attesté en Espagne depuis 1088. @ n'est pas une unité de mesure, mais la notation abrégée d'une unité de mesure. [La même référence] indique que @ abrège arrobe au moins depuis 1775. Le signe lui-même, qui à l'origine ne signifie pas arrobe, est "une graphie onciale". Cette graphie "se développe entre le IIIe et le IVe siècle" (après JC).<br>  <br>  D'après une étymologie populaire, arobase proviendrait de la contraction du terme typographique ? a rond bas ? (bas pour bas-de-casse, caractère minuscule).<br>  <br>  Une hypothèse prétend qu'il s'agit d'une ancienne ligature latine pour ad (? près de ?, ? à ?, ? chez ?), la boucle rappelant celle d'un d en onciale.

(...).<br>  à défaut de certitudes, voici deux propositions d'explications étymologiques qui ont cours en ce moment : arrobas viendrait d'un rapprochement ou d'une confusion avec le symbole d'une unité de poids espagnole, arroba, dont le nom fran?ais est arrobe (avec un ou deux r), et dont l'origine est l'arabe [ar-roub]; ou arobas serait la déformation de a rond bas (de casse), c'est-à-dire a minuscule entouré d'un rond.<br>  Quoi qu'il en soit, ce petit signe séparateur est aussi doté d'autres désignations évocatrices ou  fantaisistes : escargot, arabesque, a roulé, a arrondi, a-rondi, même...

AA11645722	Okay here is the deal with the 64 bit.  When you buy a retail version, you get the 32 bit DVD in the package, but if you want the 64 bit, you have to contact Microsoft and have them send it to you (+ shipping & handling).  So I would assume the system works the same with the upgrade, once your upgrade get here, contact Microsoft and request the 64 bit version, here is the link:<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/windowsvista/editions/64bit.mspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/product...</a> <br>  As for needing it, like others have said, you probably want to wait a while because of compatibility issues, but I would recommend you get the disk now, and then use it later, like in a couple of years.|`|457003f9cdfd554414dcf5df8155b783aa	Vista comes in both 32-bit as well as 64-bit. Now why they are giving you 32-bit... I have no clue... but there is a 64-bit version that exists. <br>  <br>  32-bit is anyway a good choice as of now as we do not have many software that work on 64-bit systems. It will take atleast couple of years more for all software to be 64-bit compatible. <br>  <br>  As of now, I recommend you to upgrade to 32-bit Vista only. You can install the 64-bit version later. As of now, there is no way you can "upgrade" from 32-bit to 64-bit Vista. Maybe, a few months down the line, Microsoft will come up with some upgrade tool for this....|`|8b4b6840361a7edbe559bf49dd3b8d75aa	Eh I'd wait till HP releases drivers for your laptop before upgrading. But yes the 64-bit version is out. All manufacturers are giving the basic levels of vista since they are less memory intensive. Also your laptop might have a hard time with the graphics requirements.

C1hRc4jnaa	ok first things first reboot the PC and tap F8 to go to safe mode and check to make sure the KB is working properly here if it is then there is some software running in the background that is interfering with your KB functioning properly. if it isnt then check the device manager (right click on my computer and go down to properties and left click and then if pre XP click the tab for device manager and if XP then click the hardware tab and then the device manager button) to make sure that the KB is listed and no matter how many times its listed right click on each one and go down to remove device and then reboot the computer and see if this resolves the problem. now if ythe KB worked properly in safe mode then you need to think of when it quit working and what software you installed directly prior to it stopping and uninstall it. one of these steps should resolve the problem.|`|FfegJhAwaa	If the other answers don't work, you keyboard layout might be wrong. <br>  (See the following 2 links for details)|`|SRJuQS0paa	I have seen this happen frequently with USB Keyboards.

AA10368906	Personally, Windows XP isn't bad and I don't care about Vista. I've sworn off Windows Operating Systems for my personal use.<br>  <br>  If you feel adventurous, you could try:<br>  1. install Ubuntu linux. It's well developed, fairly easy to use and there's a considerable amount of open source software available.<br>  <br>  2. Check out an Apple MacBook. Apple OS X is a nice operating system and comes bundled with a lot of great software. <br>  <br>  Either way, switching to a new operating system has a bit of a learning curve, but within a few days you should be operating comfortably.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|BoT5zWhtaa	You might as well get Vista, you're going to be using it eventually anyway. You're just postponing the inevitable.|`|xMxAju6vaa	Yes you can. All you need to do is reinstall the OS of choice onto the hard drive. If you have an existing machine that you are no longer going to use you could use the OS "key" from that machine and install it on your laptop. However you would need to make sure you remove the OS from the original machine to ensure compliance with the EULA (End User Licence Agreement).<br>  Just make sure that you have a full version, not an upgrade before you install the OS of your choice, or if you only have the upgrade, make sure you have an original CD from a product that can be upgraded. i.e. If you were to format your new laptop hard drive and start installing XP Pro from an upgrade CD it will ask you to insert a CD which qualifies for the upgrade, this can be Win 98, me, XP home etc.<br>  <br>  Hope it's not to confusing!|`|7e591d31d8de976c201ccf67adfb38abaa	Do you think a computer that has heavy components  will waste  time using XP for weaker computers

efec93ebae12bf39df3689cb4fcfdd52aa	I get asked this a lot at work.  The original CD that came with the web cam will not work.  What you need are the new drivers for the webcam.  You need to go to the manufacturers website.  For example, if it is a Microsoft web cam, go to www.microsoft.com.  They should have a list of available drivers and hopefully some new ones to work with your Windows Vista!|`|2RJZys3qaa	I would suggest Installing windows XP or any other operating software.

If they don't work, I'd suggest getting a new drive. Honestly, my experience is that many DVD drives just don't last that long. That may not be the case for higher-end models, but it's true for under $75 models. <br>  <br>  The good news is, drives are cheap. Search online for models with good reviews and low cost.  Pop a new one in and start enjoying your audio/VCD/DVD all over again!<br>  <br>  EDIT: If it's only 2 months old, and a laptop, I'd say talk to the manufacturer NOW!  Don't even play around with it; get a replacement from them.  It's too new to have those problems. Or at least contact the mfg's customer service for assistance.|`|04aa134862179858a53bb970e0001f8caa	How old is the drive? If its an older device and just started acting funky, then I would suggest replacing it.<br>  <br>  If its a new device on an older system. You might have a resource conflict. Aside from that its possible that the device is bad out of the box. It really could be any number of things, but without your system details its hard to diagnose.

If you are taking digital photos, always take them at the highest resolution you can, then you can decrease  the resolution of copies on your pc, while keeping the original hi-res photo saved for future use.|`|KxFfD9nhaa	I don't know if you can increase a file without  getting lossy results.

The quality is dependant on the resolution of the picture...(the amount of pixels per inch)... so if you are scaling up a an image with a low resolution... there may not be enough pixel information to retain it's quality.<br>  <br>  3. What are you using the image for? If this is for print, you may need a much higher resolution. And your scaling options may be comprimised.<br>  <br>  4. Use software such as adobe photoshop, or other imaging software... (you can download trial versions, if this is a one time thing... and you dont have) these can be found at adobe.com<br>  There are also free image editors...

I am hoping that they are working on improving the technology.|`|05f135eb5c00c9813c91e82aba63e29caa	I have Vonage and like it a lot. A *lot* cheaper than a land line. We went from about a $60 per month phone bill to less than $20 per month (I have the 500 minute per month plan for $15, which is more than enough minutes), and there's no extra charge for long-distance. Since we mostly use our cell phones, it's a good alternative to having a traditional land line. Sound quality has been very good. Lots of good features, like having voicemail automatically forwarded to your e-mail address as an MP3 file. Only complaint is that if your cable goes out, your phone service goes out, but it doesn't happen that often, and even if it does go out, then messages just get saved to voicemail. Oh, and you do have to buy special broadband phones; you can't use existing landline-type phones.|`|tgcRDxaxaa	i use vonage its just like a NORMAL HOME PHONE  i love it its only 29.99 a month  there softphone is great too its like a cellphone size portable that you carry with you and its like having your home phone in any wireless hotspots<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.vonage.com/get1monthfree/" rel="nofollow">http://www.vonage.com/get1monthfree/</a><br>  VONAGE - LEADING THE INTERNET PHONE REVOLUTION|`|zKhygeBhaa	If you have a friends far away it is a good deal.

Once upon a time it was a good anti-virus, but it is now just bloated, ineffective, and easily disabled by many viruses out there.<br>  <br>  For a cheap (see: free) and decent solution i would reccomend AVG Free ( <a href="http://free.grisoft.com)" rel="nofollow">http://free.grisoft.com)</a> or for one of the best antiviruses you can get i would reccommend BitDefender (www.bitdefender.com) A good Anti-Virus with the addition an anti-spyware progam such as AVG anti-spyware or Windows Defender is a good start. These along with having at least Windows XP that is fully updated and with firewall enabled you will be fine.<br>  <br>  You asked if Norton will warn you when someone tries to hack in? That would be the firewall portion of nortons, you will find this in the Norton Internet Security pack or higher, however as I said before, Windows Firewall is adequate with proper anti-virus and anti-spyware packages.|`|VlQ015qkaa	I'm going to come out good and clear about Norton.

otYhRC1faa	seguramente es muy pesado o esta en formato avi, sera mejor que lo conviertas a mpeg para que lo puedas subir|`|0VV1VkV6aa	Puede que la pagina a la que intentas subirlo este saturada o en dado caso fuera de servicio,o lo mas provable esque el video exceda el limite de MB que permite la page,checa eso.|`|7dGs0u4xaa	Mira lo que pasa con eso es que en algunas paginas de esas para subir vídeos tiene 1 limite que cuenta la duración del vídeo y también el peso del vídeo (kb) te recomiendo que investigues en el lugar que kieres subir tu vídeo investigar a que nivel de calidad aceptan los vídeos (por ejemplo 5 mega bytes)y ya que sepas eso y tu veas que tu vídeo es mayor en el movie maker cuando vas a finalizar el vídeo ponle el tama?o exacto le pones le 5 mega bytes y listo!! lo mas seguro lo podrás subir el vídeo Espero que te sirva mi respuesta hasta luego!!

Cuando te salga otra vez el mensaje, en el depurador dice qué archivo (módulo) es el que originó el problema. En mi caso lo originaba el Adobe Flash (flash9.ocx) asi que lo desinstale y lo volví a instalar de la página de Adobe y todo bien.

Line is used to connect your ADSL line and LAN to connect a computer to the network, so if you have 1 PORT, you can think of this port as connecting your computer to that IP.

uw3J8M0waa	If you are currently a paid Internet subscriber, you are entitled to a "homepage" which often contains simple navigation and editing tools. And if you use the Netscape browser, the built-in Composer feature is a superior HTML authoring tool. You can easily generate a full-blown website as a Homepage. Nevertheless, the "homepage" URL is likely to be "http://homepage.earthlink.com/subscribe... name" and that URL can easily be overwritten via a redirection service, i.e., "mydomain.com" which allows you to link any registered domain name to "mask" another website. For example, should you type in "domainname.com", you will be immediately transported to the homepage and the hompage URL of <a href="http://homepage.earthlink.com/subscriber..." rel="nofollow">http://homepage.earthlink.com/subscriber...</a> name will be masked by the domainname.com. And the charge for the redirection service [even at godaddy.com] is normally FREE. Here's a demonstration: Type in the URL window: "www.pizzanextdoor.com" which will bring up their pizza website. Take note of the domain name. Then type in the URL window: "http://home.pacbell.net/vten/1a/pizzame... and you will see that this is the original homepage which is unmasked without the domain name!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|yPvUWq15aa	If you want to learn HTML, then the best Editor<br>  is NoteTab Lite.

99086a2ce29186b01401c24a692255ccaa	Hallo....<br>  <br>  Also ich mache das mit der Mitfahrzentrale nun schon seit 4 Jahren. Ich fahre quer durch ganz Deutschland, jede Woche woanders hin. Ich habe schon die unterschiedlichsten Erfahrungen gemacht. Klar, es passiert schon mal, dass einer nicht kommt, ?rgerlich, aber was soll′s. Jedenfalls trifft man soooo viele nette Leute, h?rt kuriose, lustige, traurige Geschichten und es sind wirklich nur Leute, die günstig von A nach B kommen wollen. Die meisten nach Hause oder zur Arbeit! <br>  Ich pers?nlich stelle meine Angebote oder Suche immer in www.mitfahrgelegenheit rein, denn da fallen weder Kosten für den Fahrer, noch für den Mitfahrer an. Au?erdem brauch man nicht st?ndig ins I-net zu gehen um Mails abzufragen. Ich kann dir nur dazu raten, es zu versuchen:<br>  1.- man kann sich Benzinkosten teilen (Ja, bei den Preisen...) <br>  2.- tut man was für die Umwelt (anstatt 4 Autos f?hrt dann nur noch 1)<br>  3.- lernt man viele Leute kennen (wird die Fahrt nich so langweilig)<br>  <br>  Also...Let′s go...<br>  Grü?e Cindy!!!|`|06f40b6ad5cbc1f51b07b79f6a5b0a1daa	Mitfahrzentrale.de sowies dessen Mitbewerber sich grunds?tzlich nur ein "Marktplatz" auf dem sich Anbieter und Nachfrager treffen. ?hnlich wie ebay.<br>  Der Vorteil gro?er, bekannter Seite wie Mitfahrzentrale.de ist die einfach und schnelle suche nach bestimmten Angeboten / Gesuchen.<br>  <br>  Gefahr kann immer bestehen, wenn man bei einem Fremden ins Auto steigt. Der absolute Gro?teil der Leute ist zwar ganz normal, aber das hilft einem nicht, wenn man grad einen dubiosen erwischt. Ein paar Tipps:<br>  <br>  1.) Handel den Betrag immer vorher aus und sag gleich Bescheid wieviel Gep?ck etc. du mitnimmst. Frag dabei auch gleich nach wieviele Leute evtl. mitfahren.<br>  <br>  2.) Lass dir eine Handynummer geben, über die du denjenigen kontaktieren kannst. Unseri?se Leute geben sowas net gern raus.<br>  <br>  3.) Sag jemandem Bescheid wann du losf?hrst und gib dem auch die Handy-Nummer deines Fahrers, melde dich ab und an und sag bescheid wo du grade bist.|`|2968c76846d630e592054c9c8681083faa	Ich habe bestimmt schon 100 Fahrten über diese Seite Organisiert.

Die seite stellt ja somit auch nur eine Platform bereit, sie übernehmen keine Haft oder Ersatz, k?nnen sie ja auch garnicht. Also ein einfach entsprechenende Peron aunrufen und Dir ein Bild über diese machen. Inzwischen gibt es auch schon viele die eine professionelle Mitfahrgelegenheit daraus gemacht haben.

fGa86ABsaa	I would suggest calling the Tech Support line for your ISP, and following all of their instructions EXACTLY. Usually, as long as you are patient and listen to everything, this will solve your problem.|`|a675cc6e46f800d7220e032751ca14c3aa	You should contact your ISP and ask them to help you out. Resetting your modem usually does not delete the username and password...so calling your ISP will make sure there isnt a problem on their end either.

eF4QafmGaa	"La plupart de nos perceptions excitent en nous, quand elles excitent quelque chose, ce qu’il faut pour les annuler ou tenter de les annuler. Tant?t par un acte, réflexe ou non, – tant?t par une sorte d’indifférence, acquise ou non, nous les abolissons ou tentons de les abolir. Il existe en nous à leur égard une tendance constante à revenir au plus t?t à l’état où nous étions avant qu’elles se soient imposées ou proposées à nous : il semble que la grande affaire de notre vie soit de remettre au zéro je ne sais quel index de notre sensibilité, et de nous rendre par le plus court un certain maximum de liberté ou de disponibilité de notre sens.<br>   <br>  Ces effets de nos modifications perceptibles qui tendent à en finir avec elles sont aussi divers qu’elles-mêmes sont diverses. On peut toutefois les assembler sous un nom commun, et dire : l’ensemble des effets à tendance finie constitue l’ordre des choses pratiques. <br>   <br>  Mais il est d’autres effets de nos perceptions qui sont tout opposés à ceux-ci : ils excitent en nous le désir, le besoin, les changements d’état qui tendent à conserver, ou à retrouver, ou à reproduire les perceptions initiales.<br>   <br>  Si un homme a faim, cette faim lui fera faire ce qu’il faut pour être au plus t?t annulée ; mais si l’aliment lui est délicieux, ce délice voudra en lui durer, se perpétuer ou rena?tre. La faim nous presse d’abréger une sensation ; le délice, d’en développer une autre ; et ces deux tendances se feront assez indé-pendantes pour que l’homme apprenne bient?t à raffiner sur sa nourriture et à manger sans avoir faim.<br>   <br>  Ce que j’ai dit de la faim s’étend aisément au besoin de l’amour ; et d’ail-leurs à toutes les espèces de sensation, à tous les modes de la sensibilité dans lesquels l’action consciente peut intervenir pour restituer, prolonger ou accro?tre ce que l’action réflexe toute seule semble faite pour abolir.<br>   <br>  La vue, le toucher, l’odorat, l’ou?e, le mouvoir, le parler nous induisent de temps à autre à nous attarder dans les impressions qu’ils nous causent, à les conserver on à les renouveler.<br>   <br>  L’ensemble de ces effets à tendance infinie que je viens d’isoler, pourrait constituer l’ordre des choses esthétiques.<br>   <br>  Pour justifier ce mot d’infini et lui donner un sens précis, il suffit de rappe-ler que, dans cet ordre, la satisfaction fait rena?tre le besoin, la réponse régénère la demande, la présence engendre l’absence, et la possession le désir.<br>   <br>  Tandis que dans l’ordre que j’ai appelé pratique, le but atteint fait éva-nouir toutes les conditions sensibles de l’acte, (dont la durée elle-même est comme résorbée, ou ne laisse guère qu’un souvenir abstrait et sans force), il en est tout contrairement dans l’ordre esthétique.<br>   <br>  Dans cet ? univers de sensibilité ?, la sensation et son attente sont en quelque manière réciproques, et se recherchent, l’une l’autre indéfiniment, comme dans ? l’univers des couleurs ?, des complémentaires se succèdent et s’échangent l’une contre l’autre, à partir d’une forte impression de la rétine.<br>   <br>  Cette sorte d’oscillation ne cesse point d’elle-même elle ne s’épuise ou n’est interrompue que par quelque circonstance étrangère – comme la fatigue – qui l’extermine, abolissant ou différant la reprise.<br>   <br>  La fatigue (par exemple) s’accompagne d’une diminution de sensibilité à l’égard de la chose qui fut d’abord un délice ou un désir : il faut changer d’objet.<br>   <br>  Le changement se fait souhaitable en soi : la variété se fait demander com-me complémentaire de la durée de notre sensation et comme remède à une satiété qui résulte de l’épuisement des ressources finies de notre organisme, sollicité par une tendance infinie, locale, particulière ; nous serions donc un système d’intersection de fonctions – système dont les interruptions de chaque activité partielle seraient une condition.<br>   <br>  Pour pouvoir désirer encore, il faut désirer autre chose ; et le besoin de changement s’introduit comme indice du désir de désir, ou désir de quoi que ce soit qui se fasse convoiter.<br>   <br>  Mais si l’événement ne se produit pas, si le milieu où nous vivons ne nous offre pas assez promptement un objet digne d’un développement infini, notre sensibilité s’excite à produire soi-même des images de ce qu’elle souhaite, comme la soif engendre des idées de boissons merveilleusement fra?ches... <br>   <br>  Ces considérations très simples permettent de séparer ou de définir assez nettement ce domaine issu de nos perceptions et entièrement constitué par les relations internes et les variations propres de notre sensibilité que j’ai nommé l’ordre des choses esthétiques. Mais l’ordre des tendances finies, l’ordre pratique, qui est l’ordre de l’action, se combine de bien des manières avec celui-ci. En particulier, ce que nous appelons une ? ?uvre d’art ? est le résultat d’une action dont le but fini est de provoquer chez quelqu’un des développements infinis. D’où l’on peut déduire que l’artiste est un être double, car il compose les lois et les moyens du monde de l’action en vue d’un effet à produire l’univers de la résonance sensible. Quantité de tentatives ont été faites pour réduire les deux tendances à l’une d’entre elles : l’Esthétique n’a point d’autre objet. Mais le problème demeure entier."|`|fad58433898dbf22dbc94ad7b6f63176aa	Non ne t'inquiète pas, malgrès les nombreuses personnes qui t'oublient, les personnes qui t'aiment le plus, elles, ne t'oublieront jamais..|`|mHbo9rLTaa	On dirait bien !|`|WAPMqNTAaa	de quoi tu parles?[présente toi]|`|FIEoY86gaa	Si au moins tu remettais ta question

It is a bit of a pain, but definitely not impossible. Go to Control Panel- Add/remove programs, select mcafee from the list, and hit add/remove. Now thats gone, and you can install what you want. I don't really recommend Norton though, in fact I like mcafee better, but my favorite anti-virus is called AVG, because its free and works just as well, and doesn't slow your system down like the other ones do. <br>  <br>  here's the link:<br>  <a href="http://free.grisoft.com/doc/avg-anti-virus-free/lng/us/tpl/v5" rel="nofollow">http://free.grisoft.com/doc/avg-anti-vir...</a>

You make it out, similar to a cheque, to the person you are sending the money to.  Only they can redeem it.  A personal cheque is a cheque that you write from your own personal chequebook.  They are risky because there is always the risk of bouncing the cheque--not having the money in your account to cover the amount when it gets cashed.

ee14e206dbb372dcb6ac973cd2828e69aa	Two places you might look. First go to Start, All Programs, then Startup. If you see the program on this list you can right click on it and select delete. If that does not work or apply, your other choice would be to go to Start, Run and type in msconfig. It will start a program call the System Configuration Utility. In it you will see a tab that says Startup. There will be a list of programs with a check box next to each name. If the Screen Reader program is listed, just uncheck the box in front of it. Then restart your computer and the program should not appear unless you start it. This answer may not be definitive.
0c5Xupi5aa	Never heard of such a thing, I would think combining Photoshop with a program like 3DS Max would be your best shot anyways.  Though it may take alot longer to learn, you get better quality and your not confined to a program.<br>  <br>  I also have never heard of any programs that do this, so if your heart is set on making them in a program you might be let down.
0c5Xupi5aa	Try not previewing it... Your code might be removing it, since the code generators only are designed for a normal page, there are things a music profile has that a regular one doesn't.

fE7zhp3Caa	Is the noise coming out the speakers or is it the monitor itself?  I've heard monitors with bad capacitors squeal, but usually they start doing that after they've been on for a while and with no regard to what's on the screen.  Do you have an LCD (flat panel) monitor or a CRT (the big heavy tube, like a TV)?  Generally CRTs make more radio noise than LCDs because of the large electromagnets, electron guns, and phosphors inside (noise called EMI or Electromagnetic Interference).<br>  <br>  I've encountered one computer that made noise through the speakers when the monitor displayed lots of bright colors, especially white.  That computer had a damaged sound card preamp that was somehow picking up interference from the video signal when it wasn't dropping out all together.<br>  <br>  If the sound is coming from the speakers, check your connection, try another speaker set, or move them away from the monitor.  It's possible the set you have now have bad shielding and are picking up noise from the monitor.  If that doesn't help, try the same monitor on another computer and another monitor on yours.  If the problem goes with the monitor, you might have a problem with the monitor.  If the problem stays with your computer, you might have a hardware problem with the sound card, in which case you would need to replace it.|`|UK0HFbCyaa	uh...while you wait for them to break down their answers to a simpler term....you COULD just turn off the volume (unless you're on youtube or listening to music or something)|`|72ceef08dd94efe9498acd08b5e73217aa	If it is a rapid clicking noise, that is normal. That is head reading/writing data to your hard drive. Since you said this only happens when opening files and programs, then it is most likely your hard drive.<br>  <br>  If it is an erie noise like what your TV makes, then it is probably your monitor. cheap resistors/capacitors in your monitor tend to make noise when displaying bright colors due to their high demand for energy, thus when you go from a dark background to a high-contrast IE window, your monitor pulls more power and makes some of the ICs whine. As long as you don't smell anything or it gets louder, you should be fine.|`|3dB43nhuaa	sounds like your hard drive is ready to die. Its spinning fast and the disk motor or bearing might be going. you may want to run a back up and then have it check save all your important files not programs. back them up on a dvd or cd or external hard drive. dose that nosie happen when you try to run any program. you don't want that hard drive to die and chance on losing all your data.

KWHCL567aa	I do not recommend that you have more than one anti virus product installed and running on your computer at a time.  The reason for this is that if both products have their automatic (Real-Time) protection switched on, then those products which do not encrypt the virus strings within them can cause other anti virus products to cause "false alarms".  It can also lead to a clash as both products fight for access to files which are opened again this is the resident/automatic protection. In general terms, the two programs may conflict and cause:<br>  <br>  1) False Alarms: When the anti virus software tells you that your PC has a virus when it actually doesn't. <br>  <br>  2) System Performance Problems: Your system may lock up due to both products attempting to access the same file at the same time.<br>  <br>  In your case, I would highly recommend you stick with NOD32 and uninstall Avira.|`|bvILUDnJaa	Running two antivirus or internet security products on the same computer can cause system instability and degraded performance.

We'll see we're trying to get mod(X,Y) such that<br>  <br>  mod(3,19) = 1<br>  <br>  Simply ensure that X and Y are cast as integers, and have an integer value for "result."  Then you can say<br>  <br>  quotient = Y / X<br>  EXAMPLE:<br>  quotient = 19 / 3 = 6<br>  <br>  Because quotient is an integer, it will disregard any remainder.  Now find <br>  product = X * quotient<br>  product = 3 * 6 = 18<br>  <br>  To find our modulus, we simply subtract product from Y<br>  <br>  modulus = Y - product<br>  modulus = 19 - 18 = 1<br>  <br>  I leave it to you to take the algorithm here and make the actual code out of it.  :)|`|AB2IttyMaa	Doesn't "&" already do that?<br>  <br>  If not, you could write something like:<br>  <br>  multiply integer a by 1 then subtract from b<br>  multiply integer a by 2 then subtract from b<br>  etc...do this in a loop until you find the largest integer where the difference is less than a<br>  that difference is the modulus of a and b<br>  <br>  8mod25<br>  <br>  25 - 8*1 = 17<br>  25 - 8*2 = 9<br>  25 - 8*3 = 1<br>  <br>  8mod25 = 1<br>  <br>  Then you just have to put this into C++ or Java sytax.|`|AqmEwewoaa	int modFunction(int a, int b){return a%b;}|`|AA12092556	sorry, do you know VB?<br>  <br>  i'm not sure exactly what you want to do......

AA12337687	Ok as a digital photography teacher I will do my best to help you understand this.<br>  <br>  Before you take photographs you set the image size on your camera.  If you do not know where this option is look up image size in the index and point by point follow the instructions.  The reason you would want a large image size would be for printing and I personally think you should always choose the largest image size because you can resize it for email later if you do but if you choose the smallest email you will not be able to increase the quality to print, it will only be suitable for email.<br>  <br>  Like most people photoshop would be my favourite option to resize but you can use another program...one way to make a photo smaller for email would be to reduce the amount of pixels (pixels are the little dots that make up each picture, if you close up on your photograph using the microscope option you will see these dots but not from a distance)<br>  <br>  So basically if you open your photo in another image editing program and your photo is 1600 pixels in width and 1200 pixels in length you can reduce the pixels to 375 in width (or length if that is larger) and your program will proportionately reduce the length.  If you do not have an image editing program, check out <a href="http://www.phixr.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.phixr.com/</a> <br>  <br>  You can also use winzip to compact your photo for email, this program will keep the quality which you would lose in reducing pixels.<br>  <br>  Good luck and Happy New Year!|`|23dcf800999c046e1e514875e5784b6baa	go to paint >>open the file>>>go to image tab>>>stretch/skew|`|31b2fff67e25d93f6df6c26ed652a192aa	crop|`|800f63ebc30d69438ec50a3a5acd3e73aa	Easy Thumbnails is a good tool to use.

Mas uma dica que eu costumo dar para quem quer ouvir músicas em MP3 em aparelhos que tocam esse formato é sempre colocar o formato padr?o do MP3 que é:<br>  <br>  Taxa de bits: 128 kbps<br>  Canais: 2 (estéreo)<br>  Qualidade: 44100 Hz (44.1 kHz)<br>  Taxa de bits constante (CBR)<br>  <br>  Acho que isso já vai ajudar.|`|c23d55c0d71b88f2d2058b1137b63edeaa	esses arquivos que VOCê baíxou devem estar num formato que o MP3 PLAYER n?o reconhece ... se informe pelo MANUAL de INSTRU??ES do aparelho e baíxe arquivos das MESMAS MúSICAS ; mas se CERTIFIQUE que esses estejam num formato que possa ser REPRODUZIDO pelo seu MP3 .|`|Cj6C5SbSaa	Você deve ter colocado músicas que n?o est?o em formato MP3. Nem todas as músicas do PC tem formato MP3. Existe um formato chamado WMA tambem muito utilizado. E provavelmente é este, se você copiou musicas de CD para o computador usando o Media Player.<br>  <br>  Pode ser tambem porque suas musicas tem um birtrate maior ou menor do que o aparelho pode suportar.<br>  <br>  Solu??o: Se for a primceira causa, converta as musicas para MP3 pois pois só assim será possível que seu MP3 leia corretamente.<br>  <br>  Se for a segunda, reconverta a MP3 para um birtrate menor.|`|O2x0Zbhwaa	Voce deve estar tentando coloca WMA no seu MP3Player...<br>  <br>  <br>  S?o parecidos, mas n?o s?o a mesma coisa.|`|Rmmq9EIsaa	Deve ser problema no mp3...pq eu já passei músicas do pc para o mp3 e deu certo tah =D|`|zhJIuJTRaa	n?o sei.<br>  para mim nunca deu errado.
