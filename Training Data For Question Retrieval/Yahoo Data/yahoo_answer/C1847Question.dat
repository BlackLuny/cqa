20080110152937AAgBnKI	Computers & Internet;Internet;Google	Como es que todo lo que uno publica u opina bajo un seudónimo aparece en GOOGLE????	No entiendo porqué tienen que aparecer tus ventas en Mercado Libre, a su vez aparecen en otros Mercados de otros países, las respuestas que obtenés, las preguntas que hacés, la calificación que tenés.   Si participaste en alguna página con un nickname salen tus comentarios    No hay forma de sacar eso de google a quién le importa lo que vendo, lo que preguntas, lo que opinás, salvo que uno sí quiera tener una página un blog o lo que sea y corre por tu cuenta.   Me parece horrible y de muy mal gusto, mostrar lo que yo pregunto y opino.

20090223125311AAxNJxB	Computers & Internet;Software	What are the main improvements of vista?	Ok, so i hear all the time from bill gates and his crew about all these supposed improvements of vista that are "revolutionary" and "innovative" but in reality all i see from vista's is an operating system that used more RAM to accomplish the same tasks (Eg a game i recently bought takes 1gb of ram for XP but 1.5 for vista), an OS that takes around 16gb along to install and an OS with several compatibility issues and malfunctions. I know there has to be an advantage to vista but i just cant see any major ones.      Having said this i found out today that XP could only utilize up to 3 gb of RAM whereas vista could use more, this IS an improvement but not one (at least not in my books) that warrants the high price tag and the supposed 4 years of work one into making it!       Don't get me wrong, i do prefer the new look of vista to XP but the additional memory it takes along with the extra RAM needed for just general things seems to be a step backwards if its all towards making it look nice.       Thanks, will.

I have to possible solutions to do this, but I need to know which one is more reliable. I am NOT looking for a cheaper option.      Case 1:   Run a separate RJ45 network cable from each one of those 10 computers, to the 16 port hub that is on the other room where the other 5 are currently connected to. (10 wires running)      Case 2:   Attach those 10 computers to a hub in the same room, and then, run a RJ45 network cable from that hub to the 16 port hub in the other room.

I bought a gateway laptop when I started college 2.5 years ago and I had all this antivirus/spyware software and I was like, yeah this baby's gonna last. Well the wall charger jack started to fall apart which drained my battery and eventually caused a power failure and a multitude of other problems before I even had tiem to replace the "worn out" parts. Geek squad told me it would take a lot of money and new parts and still might not pull through and I wud be better off just getting a new laptop. Apparently the power failure fried my hard drive and nothing can be salvaged which is quite annoying since i'm not that up to date on backing up my info and the damn thing was only 3 years old.       1st of all, do u agree with geek sqaud, there's nothing i can do?      If so, help me choose a new laptop that's not going to crap out on me next year. I want a really small one to do school work on and store pics and music on and check my e-mail. that's all. I can't imagine i'd be doing much gaming but i don't want the graphics to suck either. I'd like to spend around $700 but if I have to spend more to ensure longevity, I'm willing.       Any advice would be soooo greatly appreciated. Thanks, comp geniuses!!!

The data I am trying to display are the skill levels of various players of a game (speed, strength, etc).  There is another attribute that I want to display on the chart, each players win-to-loss ratio.  However rather than creating an extra spider-leg for this ratio, I want it to be represented by color. Example, those with the highest win ratio have red lines, those with moderate win ratios are orange, and those with the poorest win ratios are yellow.      How do I make it so that the color of each player's line varies with his/her win ratio?      Here is an example of a generic spider chart.    http://www.dupontelastomers.com/images/n...       A radar chart is the same thing, but the shapes are filled in between the lines. I have already figured out how to make a spider chart, my problem is the color part.

20090223152411AAyyfNF	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	Generics in java problem? (10 points for best answer :))?	Imagine I have a class ArrayList , with an inner class Itr  that implements Iterator .      public class ArrayList {       private E[] stuff;       .......       private class Itr  implements Iterator {           public E next(){               E next = get(index);               return next;           }       }   }      Now, there are two problems.      First, I want to ensure that the E in Itr matches the E in ArrayList. However, this does not work, for obvious reasons:      private class Itr  ....      however, neither does this:      private class Itr ...      My second problem is with the next() method. Because I have not ensured that E in Itr is at least a subclass of E in ArrayList, the first line of the method gives a compile error, with this weird message:      "Incompatible types.   Found: E   Required: E"      Now, I've tried putting as the method header "public ArrayList.this.E next()", but that doesn't work.      Perhaps this is just some newby mistake, but it's really driving me nuts! Any advice?
20090223144352AAgI1xg	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	I need help with vista startup (and stuff)?	Ok, here we go. I'm working in m friends Acer computer, which runs Vista Home Premium. She had the whole blue screen thing going on, which I have seemed to fix. But, he had been running around with no virus protection for about three years. When I finally sat down and installed some, it found a trillion different things. I then installed spybot, which had a hay day. The computer then continually flashed the cmd at me at start up. It kept saying, "c:\windows\system32\ntdll.dll" is corrupt. I uninstalled spybot, and decided it was time for a wipe. I reformatted, and all that good stuff, and then, out of the blue (Literally), the computer crashed. I hadn't even gotten to the desktop. Windows came back and said that I should install windows service pack 1. So after finally getting in and settling, windows bugged me for updates. So I started them, but the computer kept freezing. Then the computer restarted, and tried to do the updates again. But then it crashes, and sends me straight to recovery! I'm in a loop. I was lucky to get back in and type this question! D: Windows checked for a problem, and guess what it said was the root of it? "c:\windows\system32\ntdll.dll" So Ive reformatted, and this problem hasn't gone away. I do not have a vista disk. The computer seems to have a problem booting up and installing updates, and I'm simply not sure what to do any more.      I'm pretty sure everything that happened is here, but so much has happened, I could have left something out.      I'm sure I reformatted correctly, I've done it many times.   Do you really think I should reformat again? I'm just afraid its a virus in the registry. I'm going to ask him, whenever he decides to come home, if he had the problem in the very beginning. I'm just starting to think the computer came with this problem.

You know, stuff like that.   But ever since this computer....I've neglected all of the above listed. Meaning I don't play video games as much, talk with my family as much, watch any TV, I never EVER get my homework done when it needs to be. I've even tried leaving my computer to go do those things, but when I tried, I got bored very fast and within 10 minutes, my butt was back and seated in front of the computer. All the things I felt were fun and interesting...just don't interest me anymore! Everything except this is boring now, and I hate how I'm wasting my life away like this.    Can someone please help me? Tell me how to stop going on the computer as much, and spend time doing the things I really love.
20090223143010AASM1Gb	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	How to program this...?	Sorry I deleted this by accident.   I have a lot of hosted images open in Firefox in different tabs. In each tab, the address bar reads something like  http://something.com/image001_small.jpg,  except the number after image is different for each tab. I usually have to highlight and delete the "_small" to open the full sized image, and repeat this for each tab. I want a program that does this automatically, ie delete "_small" from the address, open the modified address, move to the next tab, and repeat.      edit: Sorry, I forgot to mention that I got these links open in the tabs with DownThemAll in the first place.      In response to David G:   How do you export all the URLs from different tabs into a single text file?

20090223135423AA2sKGv	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	Ideas for a photoshop project?	Directions: You are to compose an artificial scene using a total of SIX (6) separate photographs. You must choose ONE of the six photographs to serve as the background or setting for the scene. The remainder of the 5 photos must be placed throughout to create the rest of the scene. To effectively compose the scene, you must use a variety of selection tools (magnetic lasso, lasso, magic wand, color range, quick masking, etc). Additionally, each image must appear on its own layer, which should be renamed.       Requirements:   -Must use all six photographs   -Each photo must be on its own layer   -Min. of two (2) different layer blend modes   -Initial background size minimum of 600px x 400px   -All images resized (transformed) to fit appropriately   -Theme/Content must be school appropriate    -Each layer must be renamed   -Min. of one (1) Mask Used   -Min. of two (2) colorized objects (using selections)         Any ideas?

20090223141101AASNJ4u	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	Java - If...Else and Boolean Statement Help?	My assignment:   Your job for this assignment is to create a simple program that determines if a string is an email address. Roughly speaking, an email address is a string that contains exactly one occurrence of the symbol "@", does not start with a ".", and has certain other restrictions on the kinds of symbols allowed. To simplify matters, we'll assume our own slightly simplified rules: a string is a legal email address if:      * it does not begin with a "." or an "@";   * has exactly one occurence of @;   * it is made up only of numbers, letters, dots, or @.      Your job for this assignment is to write a single class application called EMail (file name: EMail.java),   which reads in a single string from the keyboard; if the string is a legal address according to this definition, your program should print   Legal email address? true   if the string isn't legal, your program should print   Legal email address? false      Some tips:      1) You may want to use a (static) method in the Character class called isLetterOrDigit, which returns boolean. Thus      Character.isLetterOrDigit('a')      returns true, but      Character.isLetterOrDigit('@')      returns false.      2) You will want to use a Scanner object to read in the String. A good way to start is to use the Scanner to read in a String from the keyboard, and then print the letters in that String to the console, in a column. Once this works you can go further.         So far what I have:   public class EMail{          public static void main(String[] args){       Scanner emailscan = new Scanner(System.in);       if (Character.isLetterOrDigit('.','@'));)      System.out.println("Legal email address? false");    else      System.out.println("Legal email address? true");     }   }         I know I need to fit charAt(1); in there somehow. My book talks a lot about numbers and math but nothing about characters, words, boolean statements, etc. Help please! Even if you just redirect me to a helpful website or forum. Thank you.
