20090220032824AAKoUO5	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	How will i know if my best friend is gay and in love with me?	im a guy and in 3rd year highschool. I have a bestfriend who is just sooooooooo handsome and good looking. we've been best friends since prep level and still friends until now. We are really close and very touchy too. When our eyes meet, we gaze into each other's eyes until someone looks away or asks why. We do everything together and I would even pay for everything when were together just because I want to be with him. I honestly go crazy if i dont get to talk/chat/see him. HE is really good looking and alot of girls are doing extraordinary feats to add him in friendster, chat with him or simply see him but he doenst have a girlfriend. He is kinda emo-ish but on a very small level.Aside from the fact that he is not that talkative but only i can make him talk for long. I really love his laugh. I pretty much make a fool out of myself just to see that beautiful smile and laugh. My other classmates have told me that he sometimes looks at me when im not looking. The look that says i love you. That kind of look. When we watch movies, he would sometimes hold my hand if theres a scary part(this could mean that he is either trying to stop me from covering my eyes or just wants to hold my hand) and leans on my shoulder. Its very sweet. I have this strange feeling when he is beside me and he hold my hand. I pretty much go to some school events that are not mandatory just to see him. He is the type of guy who looks like a girl. emo-hair thin body. He doesn't act like a gay-girlish person who flaunts but he acts like a shy girl. Really looks like a girl. I treat him as one. I really love him and i dont know if he feels the same way for me. Im pretty kinda defiantly maybe sure that he is gay for me. I even think he sometimes begs me to kiss him cause he looks at me when our faces are JUST TOOOO close. I also feel the strong amount of WANT AND NEED to simply press my lips against his.u know guys. there was recently an event that happened in my class. one of my friends who is really gay told they guy he was gay for. That guy said that he wasnt gay and now the whole class knows it and their friendship is now destroyed. i wont let that happened to me.   but i did ask him one night if he loved me as a friend. he said yes. He is very discrete with his feelings but I love him. Its exactly like the "story" behind the song. Hate that I love you by Rhianna. How do i know if He is gay?

20090220033700AA7ZDfJ	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Psychics, is this the one?	Let's call my friend "T". When I was in his class, T always tried to make me laugh. I asked my parents for a new video game system and they said "no", then I told T about it and someone heard. They started to make fun of me and T cracked on them for me. He told me that he'll give me some of his games. Also, he always tries to see who I'm texting. He even asked me if I had a girlfriend but I said "no".      On Friday, we hanged out. We hanged out from 3PM to 8PM, just me and him. He took me to his house but said that I couldn't go in because his sister was there and she is really, really mean. He was concerned that I was gonna get sick so he gave me one of his hats. He also payed my way for the bus and bought me headphones. Then, he told me that he entered a competition to win the game system that I wanted.      He is very concerned about me. He tells me to put on my hood in the cold. He got mad because I took off from school. He seems very concerned about my well being.      Also, when me and him were walking, I almost slipped because of the ice. He told me to watch out before I embarrass myself. Then he said "Never mind, I'll never let you fall but if you do...I'll fall down with you...."         Do you think he likes me?
20090220033434AAvf5kl	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Does this quote make any sense to you?	"God wants you to be attractive so you can be with someone but doing things intentionally for the admiration of others is not Christlike"  I am malformed and was given this book by my former church.  I personally think the quote is bullsh** cause the bible says "beauty is fleeting but a woman that fears the lord shall be praised.  The bible also says a kind and gentle heart are more precious in God's sight.

After all, some say the earth if 7,000 years old, others say it is 14,000 years old, still others can do the math to it being 15 billion years old.........and since this is supposedly God's word, obviously, it is need to know info.........or is it suppose to be taken as a metaphor.......and if so, how can i tell what is to be taken as a metaphor, and what is to be taken literally?  or is it just, whatever i can't rationalize, i take metaphorically, or whatever i don't want to do, i take metaphorically?      so, what are the NEED TO BELIEVE parts?

I feel like crap, had a disagreement with a close best friend. He said some hard things spur of the moment, which hurt me. It was all a big misunderstanding. We've communicated by email a little since, and things seem ok. But I'm afraid to lose him, he means a lot to me. I just want things to be the way they were, and expressed this to him. if he lived near by I'd visit him with some flowers, hug him and it would be easier to communicate with him. However, this isn't the case. Any ideas how I can show him by a song on you tube for example, that he means the world to me, that I am genuine in our friendship, that I'm sorry about our disagreement, I want to forget about it and continue the way we have always been.

20090220035401AAELLFU	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	How to go about telling parents, as a 13 year old, you want to take a break from christianity?	My parents are practising catholics, my dad was brought up to be one, and my mum is recently converted and very into it. They brought me up to be catholic too, but it just doesn't feel right for me, nothing clicks. I want to explain to them that i want to find out about other belief systems, experiment and see what works for me. I'm worried they will flip out.      I do believe there is  some form of higher power, such as a god, but i do not think it is how the christian faith portrays him, in fact i do not know if there is any faith that thinks of their god the same way i think of mine.      My outlook is this, if i be the best person i can be, then whoever god is, he will be pleased, and even if there is no god, it is a fulfilling way to live.      Any advice of how to broach this subject, made more complicated by being embroiled in the church activity, my parents,especially my mother, being very involved in the church, and knowing the priest better then most.      thank you so much.       ps, the reason i say take a break is that, i want to sort everything out in my head, then find a faith that beleives what i beleive, and i don't know, i might go back to another form of christianity; I just want to make sure, i'm not doing it just for the sake that i've been brought up to be christian. I am very interested in the "new" age stuff, i can see auras and am developing my intuition. Before all the jesting starts, i would like to say that both my eyes and mind are fine, and if you can't think of anything worth reading to type, then don't.      thanks again.

Hi there; I've recently downloaded a Kelly Howell's mp3 to improve my positive thinking. Its efficacy it's supposedly based on two points: brain waves of music that correct the electrical behavior of the brain and subliminal messages (positive messages spoken so low that only your subconscious mind can hear them) that are designed to improve your attitude.      So, people, what do you think about this? Have u ever tried it? U know something on this 'brainwave' subject?      I can personally get to accept that it may be good for my health, but... who the hack is Kelly Howell? Should I trust her to whisper subliminal messages to my brain? Maybe instead of positive thoughts she is uttering: 'Buy my whole set of products right now, baby!' XD Yep, it's hard for me to trust something I can't check... Is there any audio program that lets me analyze the subliminal messages in my purchase?      Thank u people.

In other words, Nurses can clean poopy diapers, etc, and not get upset, but any talk of faith is disgusting?      And the more I think of it, I can come up with several instances in my own life and the lives of friends and relatives where Christians who weren't out to evangelize but merely identified themselves as Christians received hostile treatment from Nurses as well as Doctors.

Good evening to everybody…      I can say that I am so glad of being here and finished this course. The experience of studying at the USA has been wonderful to me and to all of the students.      Nowadays, English has become not just an important language, but also and indispensable key to success. Because of that, I would like to thank my parents for encouraging me and giving me the opportunity to study English.      I would like to thank also my classmates. I know I have not been with them since the beginning, but the time I spent with them was amazing. More than classmates, we were friends sharing and learning together.      Now, in the name of all of my classmates I would like to say thanks to our teacher Sumy, for being always there disposed to teach us in the best way and the most important, for always believing in us.      Finally I have to thanks to the USA, the teacher Greg, and all the people who work there. Because they are doing a very important job, they are helping students to grow up and to increase their opportunities to compete successfully in life.      To finish with my speech I would like to say some words which I came across a few days ago; I think they are completely true and we all have to apply them into our life: “Success does not come to you…you go to it.”

I'm 15 male and I've know that i want straight for years now, I like girls I've loved girls and I also like guys, I like guys more than girls though. So I've come to the conclusion that I'm Bi. I've told my best friend whom I had my greatest crush on but since her and i can be together cuz i moved so we're est friend now, she knows and supports me i've told some friends, and my sister my sister is cool with it we don't talk much about it though, but a couple of days ago she told me that i should tell my parents and i don't know what to do, my dad is really really christian and i have heard from him a gizillion times how gays go to hell how God doesn't forgive gays how men cannot love other men its impossible and i've heard him say an array of insults toward men who are not 100% straight. my mom is more reserved in that account but since shes my dad's wife then you know. But my dad also has gay friends that i personally know so that confuses me because i don't know what to make of his opinion towards other-that-straight-men. and he is really explosive when hes mad. i just want to stop hiding and be myself, i want to tell them but i feel really hesitant about it. I also should add that when i was inside the "closet" that was the most excruciating experiences of my life, i used to cry really often i would make scratches on my skin not enought to draw blood but enought to leave scars that have lasted to this day, and i took a razor blade a couple of times too, nothing suicidal just wanting to feel physical pain instead of just emotional but im better now thank God, i guess that only shows that im no good under emotional pressure. So to the question what should i do, should i tell them? Any advise or help is welcome,(just dont go and tell me to look for God to make me straight because i'm possesed by demons) also i want to go to some place where they talk to gay, bi, lesbian, teens i really want to meet others like me so help on that is welcome also :)      THNX in advance   Javy

I am an ex baptised witness Not dis-fellowshiped  just drifted away twice (brought up in the truth)       Jehovah has a right to destroy who ever he wants because life is a gift, however is it loving to not resurrect the children and babies of those who died in the flood. does this mean that their is no hope for these youngsters? essentially they were written off?  if this is the case and i don't feel close/or love Jehovah then really does he care about me?  does that mean he has written me off as well ...i am confused about Jehovah i don't know how i feel about him anymore ..he frightens me a lot when considering his decisive actions re Sodom and the flood and the impending Armageddon..my question i guess is... is my existence therefore pointless? living day to day knowing  whats going to happen , living a life that really doesn't belong to me if you think about it? I believe the truth absolutely and would love to have a chance to really LIVE without my weaknesses and the terrible suffering i see locally and worldwide i don't think i love him or anyone for that matter.  in essence a very nonspiritual person.      i worry that in trying to go back again that this is purely selfish and of course doomed to failure and a return to the world. because of the wrong motivation. should i accept that i am really just not a spiritual person and should accept this (saw a comment similar to this that made me think when a sister directed this to a very sneaky crappy apostate pretending to be something else on another yahoo answer ) ) ...the truth is just not in me and that its really a coincidence that i had contact with the truth because i was brought up in it . Those kids were judged not worthy therefore logically mean that their are people no matter how much they wish they felt different are likewise judged not to be a spiritual person.      I don't question whether he will make the right judgement. i know he will and its his prerogative i am just wondering whether its prudent to endure the torment of leading a pointless life (this is tormenting  believe me ..knowing the truth and not acting on it)  ,. I use to have feeling for him and i thought i had close relationship for a few years I was baptised etc raised a family etc but  he upsets me from time to time and i know this is my fault not his (i remember Abraham but he was a servant and close to him ) I just not sure about him and whether i want to 'serve him' is it possible to just not like him or everything about him.. just part of him      b4 you recommend the local cong..i have already and nearly became physical ..don't want that again(my fault very angry and emotional person been through a lot) and live in a very very small town where i don't really identify with the culture at all. i am from another country and big city etc  so looking forward to well reasoned thoughts from JWs that actually care..if you are a JW detractor or an apostate do me a favor don't waste my time i have suffered enough get it?

20090220001730AAq5zlw	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	If our body is just a vessel to our soul, do you think our sexual orientation is just a vessel to our love?	I just had this thought while I was sitting in the toilet. Aren't toilets amazing for giving inspirations!      But I was just wondering about it, since the nature and discussions about body and soul is somewhat similar to sexual orientation and love.      The love is the most important thing of all, and sexual orientation is just something to achieve a bigger and better love. Like our soul, which should be more important than our body.      We strive to gain better soul, and the way to achieve it is always different from each person, because the vessel which we are born with are different than each other. And we should optimize our soul with the vessel we got.

20090203122735AAU7tW0	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Are “What if you’re wrong?” questions more appropriately aimed at religious people?	I mean, religious people are all metaphorically standing around a sealed box, perpetually arguing amongst themselves, some of them jumping up and down like demented apes, each of them claiming that their and only their beliefs as to the contents of the box are the truth. Rational people are the ones who ignore the ceaseless yammering of religious people, walk up to the box and pry open the lid to see for themselves what’s in the box. Rational people want to find out the truth; religious people don’t care for the truth but are content to just hope their wild assumptions are true, so it’s more appropriate that religious people are asked, “What if you’re wrong?” isn’t it? Because it’s all but completely guaranteed that they are wrong, right?
20090220001613AANXYAQ	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Religious folks say do not judge god.  do you believe you judge god or not?	Don't forget a judgment can be negative or positive?   I bet a dollar to a dime most of you will now say ("Well it's ok if you only judge god for the good things")  Does that sound about correct.  But either way negative or positive they are judgments,        BTW  who is it who says we are not suppose to judge god in a negative way,  Is the reasoning because we are so much like nothingness compared to him.  What is Wrong in believing god exists but really don't like how he does things?  And give your opinion about the things you don't like?   Many folks would hate other folks for doing the same things god does, or doesn't do.      So let's say i believe in god but really don't like what he does, if there is a heaven will i still be elgible,  or  is it not only you have to believe in god but you have to love him also to get into heaven?
20090203124146AAA4F0q	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Are agnostics ignorant?	I keep hearing people saying they're agnostics, but then when they posit why, it is clear they're atheists.      The atheist proposition clearly leaves open the "possibility" that there is a God.  Agnosticism, however, is 50/50.  An Agnostic would believe that there is just as much chance that there is a God, as there is that there isn't a God.      A TAP (temporary agnostic in practice) believes that we don't currently have a good enough understanding of the Universe to deduce a logical conclusion about this (which is ignorant).  A PAP (permanent agnostic in practice) believes that mankind WILL NEVER KNOW, and therefore, out of principle, leaves open the possibility of a God, AS MUCH as he/she would leave open the possibility that there isn't one.

20090220010853AAXFvMo	Society & Culture;Holidays;Ramadan	Ramadan: Why can't Muslims understand even logical proof of Jesus' divinity from the Koran and Bible?	PROOF OF THE DIVINITY OF CHRIST From the Koran and the Bible       God began by choosing a chaste woman, Mary (Maryam). To qualify her, He  necessarily exalted her in advance ABOVE ALL THE WOMEN OF CREATION, for birth is the women's GREATEST pride and, yet Mary would EXTRA-ORDINARILY give the birth that is the GREATEST of all times. See Luke 1:28, 30:34, 41-44, 48-49, and 54-55. Also says Qur'an 3:42, "....O Mary! Allah has CHOSEN thee, and PURIFIED thee, and PREFERRED thee ABOVE ALL THE WOMEN OF CREATION".         After that, God settled His soul (Ruh) inside His word (Kalimat) which he had put in the womb of Mary, who had been spiritually qualified as we have seen earlier. That was how  Mary conceived Jesus. That was to enable the divine attribute have human features through her for the humans to understand Him better (Hence only Jesus is Biblicaly and Qur'anically declared as GOD's WORD and GOD's RUH (Spirit): John 1:1, 14:8:23, Phl. 2:5-8; and the Qur'an 4:171, 2:252 etc. (By implication, Jesus' flesh is not actually biological but God's Word; similarly, his life is not actually human's but from God's own as we will see more later).       Therefore, even after his humanly birth, Jesus was declared as much superior to angels and, in fact, God said, "Let ALL God's angels WORSHIP him (Jesus)" (Heb. 1:6; 1Pet. 3:22; Mat. 4:11), as was Adam, of course, in Qur'an 2:30-34.       Thus, apparently, Jesus was a human, the rationality and aim of his humanized birth. See Rom. 8:3-6; Heb. 2:16-18. Also, says Allah according to Qur'an 6:9, "Had We appointed an ANGEL our messenger, We ASSUREDLY had made him LIKE A MAN SO THAT HE MIGHT SPEAK TO (associate with) MEN...."       Muslims often cite John 5:30-31; Mark 13:32-33 and John 1428 etc as disproofs of Christ's divinity. But, logically, these verses, rather than disprove Jesus' divinity, expressed the anticipated and expected demonstrations of the character that was Jesus-in-exemplary-typical-human-nature and , therefore , in accordance with God's programme as stated in the Qur'an 6:9 and:-       (1) Phil. 2:6, "Who (Jesus) being in very nature God, did NOT consider equality with God something to grasp, 7 But made himself NOTHING, taking the very nature of a SERVANT, being made in human likeness 8, and found in appearance as a MAN, he HUMBLED himself and became OBEDIENT to the death, even death in the cross"       (2) Heb. 2:16, "For surely it is NOT ANGELS that he (Jesus) helps, but Abraham's descendants. 17 FOR THIS REASON HE (GOD) HAD TO MAKE HIM (JESUS) LIKE HIS BROTHERS IN EVERY WAY in order that......" (Compare Qur'an 6:9)       (3) Rom. 8:3, "(Jesus)....in the LIKENESS OF A SINFUL MAN.........."   So, in the light of these verses, it should be clear that Jesus' humanized acts did not mean that he was actually a human being (John 8:23) but were the divinely designs that were to make Jesus not unnecessarily scare the humans but, rather be their SOURCE OF INSPIRATIONS.       In other words, if Jesus were to act God-the-father again even when haven purposely transformed into a man, the transformation would logically be nonsense.   The Holy Bible reveals relationship between Adam and Jesus thus, "The FIRST  Adam became a LIVING SOUL, the LAST Adam (Jesus) a QUICKENING SPIRIT", 1 Cor. 15:45. Therefore, to understand the nature of Jesus more, we must go back to the Adam's case.       Thus, when God breathed life into Adam (Qur'an 38:73-78 and Gen. 2:7), he (God) declared him His (God's) own IMAGE/LIKENESS (Gen. 2:7) or His VICEROY (Qur'an 2:30). Also, according to Qur'an 28:37-38, 15:39-44; 17:61-62; 7:11-13 and 2:34, Allah instructed ALL the angels to WORSHIP Adam on the ground that He (Allah) had breathed something of His SpIRIT into Adam for a soul (see Heb. 1:2-6, for the same instruction in respect of Jesus). In fact, according to these Qur'anic verses, Satan's curse and demotion are God's reaction to his (Satan's) refusal to prostrate himself before Adam.       Therefore, Biblically and Qur'anically Adam, whose flesh was made from just the sand (Gen. 2:7, Qur'an 28:72), was notwithstanding such GLORIOUS initially. And, logically, the glorious qualification came from what God breathed in him.       However, Adam did not pass Satanic test but sinned (that shows some relative weakness in him), thereby lost his INITIAL STATUS and therefore was ordered out of MOST EXALTED DWELLING, the Garden of Eden(Qur'an 7:19-24, Gen. 3:1-24). But Jesus passed all the Satanic tests (Mt.4:1-11, Heb. 4:15; Qur'an 19:19), which logically implies comparative superiority in him.       Therefore, the fact that SOIL is the comparative parent of Adam, who, again, could not pass Satanic test, sinned and was  demoted; and Mary, the SUPERIOR among all women, is the comparative parent of Jesus, who, again, passed all the Satanic tests, did not sin and therefore was NEVER demoted, given that both Adam and Jesus got their souls unbiologically from God directly; it follows that whatever type of soul God gave Adam was
20090220041417AAoLlCC	Society & Culture;Holidays;Ramadan	Ramadan: What will Muslims say about this comparison I made some years back (3)?	Example of INDIVIDUALITY   Because Mark and Luke (as in the case above) did not collaborate but rather independently wrote, INDIVIDUALITY became obvious in their judgments. Thus while one of them ‘conservatorially’ regarded regarded the original (Jewish) Jericho as the (actual) Jericho, the other ‘modernly’ regarded the administrative (Roman) Jericho as (currently) the Jericho.   Other Examples   i. Mark (1:6) says, “John’s food was ONLY locust and honey”, while Mathew (11:18) says, “John came NEITHER eating nor drinking.   Here, while Mark considered the ‘exact aspect’ of John’s feeding, Mathew on the other hand considered the ‘comparative’ or ‘metaphorical’ aspect .   ii. According to John (19:17) Jesus bore his cross up to the Golgotha. But according to Luke (23:26), one Simon was later on forced to carry the cross to follow Jesus. ‘A clear contradiction!! ‘, Muslims would exclaim. But the fact is that the then Jerusalem was a large and walled city and Golgotha was a place just outside Jerusalem. Normally, Jesus most have bore his cross from the Pilate’s Court to as far as outside the Jerusalem Wall and within the premises of the Golgotha before the Simon, who was not even an accused, was nevertheless forced to just take over form the apparently too fatigued Jesus to the exact crucifixion spot.   Therefore, while John ignored the ‘negligible’ contribution of Simon, Luke on the other hand, recognized it, perhaps for historical record.   Naturally, ‘INDIVIDUALITY’ and ‘CONDITIONALITY’ variously manifest any time a historical event is independently reported by different individuals and or when there is a difference of condition.   These types of situations are what Muslims simplistically referred to as contradictions in the Bible.   It should be noted, however, that the contradictions and inconsistencies in the Qur’an can not be explained in terms of ‘CONDITIONALTY’ and ‘INDIVIDUALITY’ because the Qur’an as a whole was supposedly uttered by one person (God). Of course if there exist contradictions in the direct words of God in the Bible, they likewise can not be explained in that ways. But there is non in actual sense.    May the Almighty Yahweh open the eyes of my Muslim friends to see the light of Christ

While the religious one prayed day in, day out, and was constantly on his knees in communion with his Lord, the atheist never even looked twice at a church.      However, the atheist's life was good, he had a well-paying job and a beautiful wife, and his children were healthy and good- natured, whereas the pious man's job was strenuous and his wages were low, his wife was getting fatter every day and his kids wouldn't give him the time of the day.      So one day, deep in prayer as usual, he raised his eyes towards heaven and asked:      "Oh God, I honour you every day, I ask your advice for every problem and confess to you my every sin. Yet my neighbour, who doesn't even believe in you and certainly never prays, seems blessed with every happiness, while I go poor and suffer many an indignity. Why is this?"      And a great voice was heard from above: "BECAUSE HE DOESN'T BOTHER ME ALL THE TIME!"

So according to religion god created the devil to give man the option of free will.      So man has to choose between a god, whom is undoubtedly evil (read the old testament), and the devil, who is supposedly even more evil. God also knows everything that is going to happen, and apparently designed it that way, including every littlest detail on each one of us. So he must know who is going to be good and who is going to be evil.      Sorry, but I must have missed something... how is that a choice?      Doesn't this mean only atheists have free will, and that overwhelmingly, nearly all atheists (more so than christians, if we go by crime statistics, altruism, science, philanthropism etc.) CHOOSE to be good?      And how does this jive with the christian tripe that you must be religious to be moral?      Isn't it more true that you can NOT be moral if you are religious because you do not have free will?

The standard definition of pedophilia is having sex with a child, since according to Islamic sources Mohammed had sex with a nine year old Aisha, then that term properly applies to him, true or false?      If false, please let me know if it is false because he did not, in your opinion, consummate his marriage with Aisha when she was nine regardless of what the Islamic sources say, or if it is false because you have an alternative definition for pedophilia. If the latter, please provide your alternative definition.

On January 16th at 1:10am my cousin Latoya Barnes died in the hospital with lung cancer at the age of 26. Before she died she was telling us that she wanted to go home, she was perfering to heaven as home. She knew she was dying and getting weak so she was saying she was ready to go home. She also was mentioning her mother's name who had died when she was at the age of 22. She was for some reasoning asking "where did Frances go", which is the name of her mother. It was really weird because her mother frances had died when she was the age of 4 or 5. So I'm guessing that Frances, her mother also my aunt was coming to get her. I would like to know what can I do to be able to talk to my cousin Latoya once to tell her bye and also would want to have a conversation with my aunt who I never had a chance to see.

20090220022917AA6Vx5q	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	A question to this answerer.?	"The Quran was written by man too!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Some of it was oral translated from generation to generation and hopefull their memories were good enought to resit it perfect.   Get over it, the Quran is corrupted.   The 3 oldest versions that are in Museusm around the world are differnt to each other.   The Quran also has condradictios, and heaps of them.   Its Corrupted.   Where is Mohaamd mentioned in the bible prophesies.   A prophet great as him should have been mentions regulary.   Jesus was prophesies over 100 time to come.   Mohammad NOTHING!   Or was all those passages corrupted too, or is it that he is the false prophets Jesus mentioned not to follow.      Mohammad perfomed no miracles, even minor biblical prophets did it.Mohammad was just a regular man who could speak weel and copied the ideas of the bible and Toanak and gave himself the credit.   The Qurans prophesies are terrible, and the bible is a much more greater resource.      Mathew, Mark, and John were witnesses to Jesus.   The gospels writters also had the holy spirit inspire them to write it perfectly.   The holy spirit even helped Paul to not condradict the gospels in his letters.   The apostiles even performed miracles while Mohaamd didnt.   This is why Mohaamd created the Quran, he hated the idolarity in Mecca, and the idea of the trinity and son of God theme, so he started his own sect.   Prove me wrong!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"      Every single one of the points you've raised apart from he hated the idolatry in Makkah is wrong.      1. About the original manuscripts EVERY SINGLE ONE IS IDENTICAL. THIS IS CERTIFIED BY TOP SCHOLARS, TOP HISTORIANS AND EVEN ATHIEST HISTORIANS ADMIT THIS. YOU HAVE NOT BEEN TO ANY MUSEUMS, BROTHER, IT IS AGAINST THE TEN COMMANDMENTS TO LIE.      2."The Quran also has condradictios, and heaps of them.   Its Corrupted."      Then the Holy Quran itself poses a chalange for you. Produce your evidence?      "[004:082] Do they not then meditate on the Quran? And if it were from any other than Allah, they would have found in it many a discrepancy."      By the way, pulling out red-herrings is illogical. Find a so-called contradiction and you will even find an answer you yourself will be happy with. There really are none, even athiests admit this. (Mature ones)      Also Were is our beloved prophet Muhamed(pbuh) mentioned in the Bible? My friend there are books just on the phrophecy, forget a prophecy  IT EVEN MENTIONS HIS NAME!      Prophet Muhammed(peace be on him) prophecised in ancient manuscripts -  http://www.answering-christianity.com/pr...       Read it;) It even says his name!      Also prohpet Muhammed(pbuh) also did miracles, Jesus (peace be on him) did great miracles, however, as a muslim i do not want to say become a muslim or islam is right , or even say anything about the miracles (google and there's loads). We have one LIVING miracle, the holy Quran. This is what Jesus(pbuh) said to his disciples when they ASKED HIM FOR A MIRACLE!      He told them they are a wicked and aduteress generation Mark 16:4.      Also, if you also think Muhammed(pbuh) wrote the Holy Quran firstl,y how can ONE MAN, who is unletterd write a holy scripture with no contradictions, with miraculous science, a beuty to the ear, whilst the current Bible, and i say current is written by 40 different authors / 45 if your catholic and contains 50,000!(real figure aproxx) ?      Here is chalange to the arab-christians, no one has been able to even get a Surah like theHoly Quran!      “Or do they say, ‘He (Muhammad) has forged it?’  Say, ‘Bring then a chapter like unto it, and call upon whomsoever you can, besides God, if you are truthful!’” (Quran 10:38)      “Or do they say, ‘He (Muhammad) forged it.’  Say, ‘Bring you then ten forged chapters like unto it, and call whomsoever you can, other than God (to your help), if you speak the truth.’” (Quran 11:13)      “Say (to the people), ‘If all of humankind and jinns were together to produce the like of this Quran, they could not produce the like thereof, even if they helped one another.’” (Quran 17:88)      “Or do they say, ‘He (Muhammad) has forged it?’  Nay!  They believe not!  Let them then produce a recital like unto it if they are truthful.” (Quran 52:33-34)      Hope i answerd ok, if any doubts remain visit - answering-christianity.com      I am not forcing any religion, just clearing misconceptions

In my mind, I still don't believe it but it's now starting to confuse me.   If the title is illegitimate or a scam, can people still add it on legal papers/works like driver's license, etc.?

20090220022935AAv7uqH	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	How do i know if my bestfriend is gay for me?	im a guy and in 3rd year highschool. I have a bestfriend who is just sooooooooo handsome and good looking. we've been best friends since prep level and still friends until now. We are really close and very touchy too. When our eyes meet, we gaze into each other's eyes until someone looks away or asks why. We do everything together and I would even pay for everything when were together just because I want to be with him. I honestly go crazy if i dont get to talk/chat/see him. HE is really good looking and alot of girls are doing extraordinary feats to add him in friendster, chat with him or simply see him but he doenst have a girlfriend. He is kinda emo-ish but on a very small level.Aside from the fact that he is not that talkative but only i can make him talk for long. I really love his laugh. I pretty much make a fool out of myself just to see that beautiful smile and laugh. My other classmates have told me that he sometimes looks at me when im not looking. The look that says i love you. That kind of look. When we watch movies, he would sometimes hold my hand if theres a scary part(this could mean that he is either trying to stop me from covering my eyes or just wants to hold my hand) and leans on my shoulder. Its very sweet. I have this strange feeling when he is beside me and he hold my hand. I pretty much go to some school events that are not mandatory just to see him. He is the type of guy who looks like a girl. emo-hair thin body. He doesn't act like a gay-girlish person who flaunts but he acts like a shy girl. Really looks like a girl. I treat him as one. I really love him and i dont know if he feels the same way for me. Im pretty kinda defiantly maybe sure that he is gay for me. I even think he sometimes begs me to kiss him cause he looks at me when our faces are JUST TOOOO close. I also feel the strong amount of WANT AND NEED to simply press my lips against his. I love him. How do i know if He is gay?

20090220031710AA6aWe8	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	What do you think this means?  (if anything)?	So I have been more or less talking to this woman for a while.  We have both gotten out of long term relationships so she says she isn't ready to date someone else yet.  (her ex was very needy and controlling).  I have been more or less living with her for a few months for reasons other than I just want to live with her.  I told her a lil while ago that I was in fact in love with her.  Her response is just to smile and give me a hug or kiss me or something...which is fine since I really didn't expect her to be ready yet.  She is more of a physical person than a verbal one, and I understand how she is.  Any-who she is off visiting her kids and so I try to give her as much time with them as possible (they are both teenagers, from her previous marriage), but since she has been gone she has texted how she misses me and should have brought me with.  Then yesterday she texted that she wanted to make love to me, which is completely out of the norm for her since she doesn't talk that way.  Anyways am I just overreacting in that this could mean she is starting to get more feelings for me?  Or does that mean nothing?  Normally she would just say let's **** or something like that but this was so different.  Opinions?  Thanks a lot!

20090219235327AAgh8XR	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	A question about Jesus Christ?	I read the old testament and I had a question about the Jesus character from the new testament.  I was told by my world religions teacher that according to most Christians Jesus was both divine and mortal and went so far as to say "I am the son of God."  But, just recently, I was told that he also said "I am the son of god and all of you (people) are my brothers and sisters."  I'm paraphrasing what I was told because I'm not even sure whether or not it's in the new testament.        So my question is:  If Jesus was divine because of his familial relationship with god and we are all his brothers and sisters then aren't we equally divine?  If he the statement was metaphorical, then on what authority can we say "He was telling the truth the first time, the second bit is just a metaphor for humanity"?       If I'm wrong on the quotation please tell me.  If I'm not, please elucidate this puzzling situation.  If both, I'm always happy to learn!

20090220050453AAtJYFP	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Is this experience something close to OBE(out of body experience)?	Don't read further if you are not going to make a relevant and serious answer.       I've been sporadically experiencing sleep paralysis for months now. I freaked out when i first experienced it o.0 and then i made a research and found out that it's some kind of a gate to what they called OBE. One afternoon i took a nap, i woke up with my body paralyed. I'm suddenly wide awake so you can just imagine the horror..o.0 then there was this loud buzzing in my ears. It felt like some strong force is sucking me out of my body. I remember i felt like i was glued to my body and something was forcing me to come out, i also felt as if im something rubbery, jelly like..i cant find the exact words. Then on my right arm, there was that shining silver lining coming out of it and i realized that it's a part of me. It's MY HAND..o.0 I wasnt able to go out of my body coz there's something holding me back. Maybe it's the fear? I stayed like that for what seemed like a long time staring at that silver lining. Then i willed myself to wake up so i jerked awake and went down to the living room and slept there instead so i'll have company. I was a bit shaken..lol. I know that the experience is real. I even told myself that 'this is real' and if ever i doubt in the future if the experience is real, i'd remember myself telling myself that what happened is real. No, im not doing drugs or drinking liquor..o.0 And this afternoon again, i experienced that sucking out of body feeling again and cant move but i didnt see the silver lining...Anyone have similar experience? and was that really something close to OBE?

In the words of Frederick the Great: "The Marshal of Natzmer, who was a Jansenist Protestant,  made a long discourse in which he deplored the Protestant religion, ready to be extinguished by the dissension of the two single princes of Germany who were its protectors."

20090220050209AABpajT	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Creationists, do you deny evolution because it hurts your ego?	I was reading some Creationist's question, and something occurred to me.      Does it make you feel more special to think that humans are superheroes anointed by some mystical sky fairy? Would it offend your delicate egos to admit that perhaps we are just another variety of animal with exceptionally good table manners? Is that what this is about?      Because proof obviously doesn't sway you. Even watching evolution before your very eyes doesn't sway you.      Is this about your own sense of inflated self-importance?

20090219231249AAjTMlW	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Is this the way you are suppose to translate the bible about how every pastors marriage is evil?	Romans 1:20-30. as in God is talking about heterosexuals in verse 20-25, and in verse 26 for this cause of sin in the flesh homosexuality is formed as God further gave them over to vile affections. Also as a result of the pastors love for the world and the lust of the flesh, like adam and Eve verse 29-30 happens. as cain killed able, because of their parents sin of the flesh.       how am I wrong? Where am I wrong, show me I am wrong instead of running aways PASTORS.  Your marriage is garbage and you are all worldly children loving the world praising the world and your dying marriage. As when it is in heaven it will be as if you HAD NONE. 1 cor 7:29. Many pastors think they will see their loved ones in heaven.          yes the Lord says you can breed for him and heaven and build his worship up with marriage, but he says you can not live forever, and your time is short. Personally I do not see how a marriage is a gift from God with you pastors, your are nothing but dying children, as you think God is the God of the dead and God would give you dying things.         is there even any pastors on this?

20090219225119AAUQs1m	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Do you like the Catholic faith?	Do you? I'm a Catholic, but lately I feel like they are kind of brainwashing people. Like one time awhile ago my mom went to church and this priest said "So and so robbed a bank may he suffer God's just hand and be casted to the valley of sorrow" (aka hell). Also I think this whole marraige anullment thing is bull, if you were cheated on you should be able to divorce without paying anyone.      Also, I feel like if I am not a Catholic anymore I'm not a Christian. Like they keep saying I'll go to hell if I don't go to church every sunday. And at CCD class some kid said he was thinking about becoming a Protestant, our teacher held him after class and yelled at him for saying that.      The point is I think they are just trying to get their way in politics and finances. Don't get me wrong, I know of a few good Catholic communities, but mine seems like they take the meaning of strict practicing beyond its intentions.

20090220062315AAJ0xd2	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	How do we deal with all this difference in our society?	Daily I come into contact with so many people. Many of them, I'm just different from and personally might think differently from, want different things in life than they do, see the world differently, might focus on different thing than they focus on, just a whole wide range of differences; our personalities might be different, different life goals, different interests...      it's complicated because they'll see me and we'll both smile and nod heads exchanging communion, but then they'll strike up a convo and think of me a certain way, like oh he's a boy coming in here to eat, he's a surfer judging by the long blonde hair or in the entertainment business, he's a bit rushy,..boy next door, etc....meanwhile I'm thinking about my masters degree, I'm no boy I'm 27...I'm not rushy at all I just have a commanding personality and can be a perfectionist, I'm not there to eat, I'm there to type on my laptop and catch up, and the whole sufer or entertainent thing, I'm like dude, I'm from NJ,...and look, you've got me all wrong.      It's like...or the people who expect me to be low key, self conscious, or just timid, and then I surprise them all by being dominant and what not.         I just feel like so many people have clashing ideas, and views on who YOU are as a person, who they are, how the world works...and it's frustrating because I hate having other people try to define me, and what not, especially when its wrong, insulting or falls short...and there's just so much difference.      Like my friends at certain retail stores....think a certain way, want to go party....have no further life aspirations, I do...and we can't talk about that b/c they don't care about that, etc.         There's just so much difference in the world, and what people expect. Another example, I see these stuck up pompous men from europe sometimes walk around, and they see me all well dressed and pushing around a cart buying things, and they just look at me all evil, and start whispering to their wives and being condescending, and I'm thinking WHAT!? it's like okay, this is america.....things are different here, maybe they're not used to seeing young people with money? Who knows.      There's SO much world difference, culture difference, lifestyle difference, religious difference, expecation difference.      EVEN us Americans are guilty of it.      Even Americans pre-judge, and hate on others for certain things, and we have our society norms,....         it all bothers me because it all gets in the way of you being able to enjoy your life and be YOU.      So how do we deal with all this difference and not let it control or ruin us?          * 14 hours ago       * - 3 days left to answer.      Additional Details   I put this in the psychology section because believe me, it can be very psychologically disturbing, the way people can be out there, and how they perceive reality and each other, so flawed...etc.      For example, I have my own self identity, and my own mind, education, skills, what i think of life and myself,and I try my best to make it work for me.......ONLY..to have other people try to ruin that, by defining me in their own ways, ..which are many times so off the mark,...and insulting to me as a human being....and it just leads me to just get angry.
20090220062106AAFkvPm	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Why do some people like it when you're down, and hate it when you're doing great?	Whenever I used to be all meek, and scared, didn't feel good about myself, and all of that, people used to more or less like me. For whatever reason. either that, or they just thought i was a nobody pushover, and that's that. simple..      Then I was like, no. Oh no, I have far too much self-respect to get treated like THAT. So then I put on a huge act. I got confident, almost cocky, and fixed myself up really nice, so I was really good looking, and just kinda like blinked my eyes repeatedly like helllllooo, pay attention..im hereeeree, i want this i want that, i want that,...      and I basically kept smiling at people and if they looked at me weird, I just winked at them and said love you bye bye!      I basically just let them know by my behavior, that I'm not taking anyone's sh9t, I'm going to have what i want, you're going to give me what I want, if not, i'm just going to bs, twirl my hair, be fake, and annoying, and that's that, and if I continue to not get what I want, I'll go to the manager, and start a dramatic production.         My attitude I've chosen because I got sick and tired of being the weak pushover type, so I finally decided to be the cocky b9tch, and for whatever reason, people loathe that. I can see why, but I also realized that they hate that I'm looking good, feeling good and doing good. Hate it, absolutely hate it.      Sometimes I'm not even attitudey at all. I just dress up and am confident and what not,      and people can't stand it.         Aside from the little act I've tried,..I just noticed in general that people like it when you're down, they really do, like they're in constant competition with you, and they hate it when you're up.      Why do people love seeing you down, suffering, and dressed down, looking sloppy,....and hate it, when you look like a celerbity, and everything's going great in your life?      F8ck those people. Do they really enjoy seeing others fail?      Well then I have every right to be a b9tch then don't I?      If that's humanity in general, all competitive, cocky, arrogant, and annoying,         then can we get a huge big unanimous...         F * C K Y O U A L L?????????????????         lol. yes, you, and you and you.          * 16 hours ago       * - 3 days left to answer.      Additional Details   It would seem to me that most people are insecure, and they want money, power...looks, whatever, they just want it, and hate others for having it because THEY want it all to themselves like selfish pr9cks. ( i honestly can't believe how unrealistic and selfish people get with their wants and needs, I really can't.)      So when they see others that have what they want...they get all hateful and have to tear them apart,      but the day they get that, they'll likely act just as bad as the people they hate now.      It's all a huge hypocricy. It's a huge mind f8ck.         It's because people are petty, hateful, spiteful, jealous, all sorts of stuff,....            so what should I do? Keep rubbing it in their faces and tell them to F*CK OFF, or ...well..I think that's my only choice.      What do you all think?

I don't know if people mistake this for arrogance or disinterest or what, but thats not the case. It's more-so just shyness, maybe lack of self-esteem at times but not always. I have a facebook account, and although I am always nice to people and talked to alot of people at my high school reunion, they never  add me as a friend. I always have to make the first move. I don't get why I am not one of those people who people are drawn too. I am 6 feet tall and I work out, and I get alot of un-solicited compliments on my looks from women, though mostly older women. People my age never want to let their guard down. It can be really confusing.

Well, cloning illegal in several different countries, but there are tons of secret labs, etc that the goverment doesn't know about. Right?         I think that Chris Angel fits under the category of "Anti Christ" but no HE IS NOT THE ANTI CHRIST.      But, do you think that the anti Christ will  be a powerful clone who looks like a man, filled with hate but be beautiful to the human eye?            I think that is how it will be ...    Anyone agree ?
20090220055252AA54fO5	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Do you ever get accused of being an asshole?	I'm a generally nice, well rounded individual. Sometimes though i am very misunderstood. I have a good deal of friends and whatnot, but sometimes when i meet my friends other friends, they think i'm some giant asshole. Its could be farther from the truth. I don't act like one, nor do i want to. Even my friends can't understand it. I have had people who never had a conversation with me, hate my guts. For no apparent reason at all. This doesn't Happen all the time, but it happens enough. The other day I was at a party at my buddies college and someone spilled a whole drink on my pants. I was pissed, but i didn't make a scene. I asked a girl who lived in the next door apt. if i could dry my pants of with her blow drier. She said yeah and I went over and did it. Now i guess according to my friend i was a belligerent asshole, who demanded to dry myself off and made the girl feel uncomfortable. (i'm not one of those people who gets drunk and forgets things, or doesn't know how i'm acting. I'm 100% focused, just drunk.) I clearly remember asking her nicely. Why is everyone so sensitive.

So I assumed I was a Liberal Democrat. So I said I am a Liberal Christian Democrat, and now People say Liberals can not be christians.      Honestly, I do not even know what a Liberal Dem or Conservative Republican is      So, What exactly Am I? Please Help.      This is where I stand      I am a christian   I am a 9/11 Truther (I have critical thinking skills)   Anyone who thinks 9/11 was done by osama is a braindead moron   I am anti-war   I am anti-nwo   I vote for people like Ron Paul, Chuck Baldwin (Anti Nwo. Pro liberties)   I have no stance on abortion or homosexuality. I am not for or against, because I just dont know where to stand on these issues.      I am a proud future Draft Dodger, I believe all should dodge.      Draft Dodgers are Hero's. I look upto them.      I believe In Civil Liberties and Gun rights.      I am Anti NAU   I dont know to much about this, but i think all the countries of the world should abolish there militaries and there governments, and everybody should have the option to own a gun. (Hitler, Stalin agrees gun control works) Also everybody at 18 in the world should pledge to never goto warand they abolish the SSS as well. I assume there will never be a war ever again, Again i dont know to much about this.      I believe in law enforcement, Law and Order.      I do not support the troops.      I do not support the government      I believe Everyone is Capable of every crime, and we do not necessarily have free will.      I believe the U.S. Military Needs to get out of our schools!      If people absolutely must join the military, which nobody should right now, because of these 2 illegal wars, then they need to raise the minimum age to 21 At least, Maybe higher.      I believe people who support bush and what the damage he did to my nation, are stupid and hate liberty.      I know the truth, that wars are staged for profits of the elites.   I know about the New World Order.      I believe Iraq and Afghanistan are both illegal wars and should have never happened, and they need to end now.      I think the 40,000 deserters should be given amnesty and are and the 200 in canada are right and the ivaw.org are right

I know someone that has been a Christian all of their life, and they are in their mid 40's now and they had an affair with a co-worker who they now plan on staying with and eventually marrying if everything works out. They do love this person, but should've gotten divorced first before doing this. The guy didn't feel loved anymore and was at his breaking point and knew what he did was wrong, and he asks for forgiveness and prays to God everyday and hopes he will be forgiven.  Does anyone know how the Bible feels about adultery? I know it says it's wrong, but if he is saved and asks for forgiveness can he be forgiven?

20090220072508AAgHk89	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	According to the Bible, were ALL Nephilim truly destroyed by God?	Before you embarrass yourselves further by saying "Yes!", DO take the time to read this; it's all straight from your Bible:      THE NEPHILIM, OR “GIANTS” OF GEN.6, ETC.      Source: The Companion Bible being the Authorized Version of 1611        The progeny of the fallen angels with the daughters of Adam are called in Gen.6, “Nephilim”, which means “fallen ones” (from “nephal”, to fall). What these beings were can be gathered only from Scripture. They were evidently great in size, as well as great in wickedness. They were superhuman, abnormal beings; and their destruction was necessary for the preservation of the Human race, and out of faithfulness of Jehova’s word (Gen. 3:5).     This is why the Flood was brought “upon the world of the ungodly” (II Pet.2:5) as prophesied by Enoch (Jude 4).     But we read of the “Nephilim” again in Numbers 13:33: “there we saw the Nephilim, the sons of Anak, which came of the “Nephilim”. How, it may be asked, could this be, if they were all destroyed in the Flood? The answer is contained in Gen.6:4, where we read: “There were Nephilim in the Earth in those days (i.e. in the days of Noah); and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became the mighty men (Heb. “Gibbor”, the heroes) which were of old, men of renown” (lit. men of the name”, i.e. who got a name and were renowned for their ungodliness).     So that “after that”, i.e. after the Flood, there was a second irruption of these fallen angels, evidently smaller in number and more limited in area, for they were for the most part confined to Canaan, and were in fact known as ”the nations of Canaan”. It was for the destruction of these,  that the sword of Israel was necessary, as the Flood had been before.     As to the date of this second irruption, it was evidently soon after it became known that the seed was to come from Abraham; for, when he came out from Haran (Gen.12:6) and entered Canaan, the significant fact is stated: “The Canaanite was then (i.e. already) in the land.” And in Gen.14:5 they were already known as “Rephaim” and ”Emim” , and had established themselves at Ashteroth, Karnaim, and Shaveh Kiriathaim.     In Gen.15:18-21 they are enumerated and named among Canaanite peoples: “Kennites, and the Kinezzites, and the Rephaims, and the Amorites, and the Girgashites, and the Jebusites” (Gen.15:19-21; cp. Ex.3,8,17; Ex.23:23; Deut.7; Deut.20:17; Josh.12:8).     These were to be cut off, driven out, and utterly destroyed (Duet.20:17, Josh.3:10). But Israel failed in this (Josh.13:13,15:63,16:10,17:18; Judg.1:19,20,28,29,30-36;2:1-5;3:1-7); and we know not how many got away to other countries to escape the general destruction. If this were recognized it would go far to solve many problems connected with Anthropology.        Indeed, and it would go far towards answering many questions that I have always had about my origins and myself.      * Lord Sesshomaru *

Although I think the sacrifice part may be correct. My cat has gone missing and my severed pet rabbits head was stuffed through my letterbox. I was suspicious that it might be a friend winding me up, so I shot his dog. I think I may have made a mistake because other people in the neighbor hood have had their pets disappear lately also.

LGBT?	ok so this isn't really a question relating to gay, straight or whatever more of a relationship question. I am only 20 and am in my first proper same sex relationship.... a bit of background      When I met my gf i had only just moved out of home and was fighting a lot with my mum and that was one of the main reasons I left home. And in a space of 3 months lost a friend to suicide, lost my close aunty to cancer and my grandad passed away. I got myself into some pretty horrible situations and wasn't choosing the best options for myself and hanging out with people i really shouldn't and was generally not in a very good space with myself (started on depression pills).      So Just before i met my current gf I had started a friendship with this amazing girl.... we would talk for hours, sit and just have coffee for ages and every time I looked at her(even thinking about her now) it would make my stomach do somersaults. I dont think I have experienced a connection with someone that strong ever before... but after a little while she told me that she couldn't offer me anymore than friendship and I was very heart broken.       Than literally only a month or not even that later I met my current gf out and ever since than (8months ago) we have not spent more that 3 nights apart since the night we met.       So my problem is that I am worried that I am settling... please dont get my wrong I love and care for my gf deeply but she doesn't give me goosebumps and we are very different and I find my mind wandering back to this other girl... my current gf and I fight a lot and I know she loves me but Im afraid that when we started our relationship I jumped into it because I needed someone.... I think i needed too feel like someone needed me... I dont want to hurt my girl but I dont know what to do... I know she doesn't mean to do it but sometimes she is very mean to me and has hit me twice but i know she loves me. I tried to end the relationship a couple months back but she told me she would kill herself if i did... and I have lost a close friend to suicide not that long ago and I dont think she would do it but even the thought of it makes me sick to my stomach.... please help... should i stay or go?
20090220054332AACPQnG	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Can satanists, wiccans or pagans be really considered true atheists or is their so called "atheism" a joke?	Can satanists, wiccans or pagans be really considered true atheists or is their so called "atheism" a joke?   Atheism is supposedly not belief in a deity & not having any religion of any kind--correct? So if wiccans, pagans or satanists have a religion then for them to come on a forum or somewhere else similar & claim to be an atheist is being a walking contradiction to atheism or at the very least calling their "religion" a lie--correct? Because by saying such things is claiming to be one thing or the other like an atheist or wiccan or pagan or satanist, but by saying & being one thing & the other, they are saying/being one or both things under false pretenses--correct, because after all atheism supposedly isn't a belief in a religious sense correct? So if satanists, wiccans or pagans say they are atheists then they are being liars--correct?

Occassionally it is fun, but only once in a while  I don't like drinking too much, and to me going to a loud, noisy bar is not my idea of fun. you can't hear anybody and it gets expensive after a while (last time i was out i think i spent like $60) . the bad thing is I am 24 and all my peers go out all the time. it's hard to find someone who doesn't want to do that if we hang out on a saturday night      my question is where are all the people like me on fri/sat nights if they are not in the clubs?

Yet pedophilia was widespread in those times especially amongst all those middle eastern people and the egyptians. Why didn't god bother to have a punishment laid out in the mosaic law, even just a mention of how pedophiles were to be killed? It seems that pedophilia is not that big of a deal to god.

20090220072621AATqaEy	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Are college rugby guys actually gay?	I went to a game with some friends and the freshmen had to run around the field perimeter naked. Then we went to the bar afterward and they have the rookies naked serving drinks to other players who were slapping their butts, and there weren't any women there... So are most rugby guys gay?  But just hide behind 'manliness' to stay on the down-low?

20090220001656AAWKAvM	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	I'm in a conundrum. Catholic or Atheist?	IF there is a God who requires that we worship him in a specific way, then the proper religion must be either CHRISTIANITY or ISLAM, because only these two religions claim exclusivity.      Between CHRISTIANITY and ISLAM, Christianity is obviously the correct choice due to the Christian world having better education, better health care, and more respect for life.      Within Christianity, there are three major denominations: CATHOLICISM, PROTESTANTISM and ORTHODOXY. I've spent the last 6 years studying patristic writings and other epistles from the most earliest of Christians and its very obvious that the 1st century Christians believed in CATHOLIC/ORTHODOX beliefs, such as the real presence of Jesus in the Eucharist, the communion of saints, confession, the veneration of the blessed mother Mary, and other such doctrines.      Furthermore, I've come to see that between the ORTHODOX and the CATHOLICS, only the CATHOLIC Church has come close to fulfilling the "Great Commission" given to Christians by Jesus, to "spread the good news to all corners of the earth".      As you can see, assuming that there is a God who desires to be worshipped in a specific way, ONLY CATHOLICISM MAKES SENSE.      BUT.....         ALL OF THIS goes on the assumption that God exists.      If God does exist, then I should be a CATHOLIC. If God does not exist, then I should be an ATHEIST.      SO PLEASE HELP ME! DOES GOD EXIST OR NOT? SHOULD I BE CATHOLIC OR ATHEIST?

20090220073738AACO4aB	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	How will i know if my best friend is gay and in love with me?	im a guy and in 3rd year highschool. I have a bestfriend who is just sooooooooo handsome and good looking. we've been best friends since prep level and still friends until now. We are really close and very touchy too. When our eyes meet, we gaze into each other's eyes until someone looks away or asks why. We do everything together and I would even pay for everything when were together just because I want to be with him. I honestly go crazy if i dont get to talk/chat/see him. HE is really good looking and alot of girls are doing extraordinary feats to add him in friendster, chat with him or simply see him but he doenst have a girlfriend. He is kinda emo-ish but on a very small level.Aside from the fact that he is not that talkative but only i can make him talk for long. I really love his laugh. I pretty much make a fool out of myself just to see that beautiful smile and laugh. My other classmates have told me that he sometimes looks at me when im not looking. The look that says i love you. That kind of look. When we watch movies, he would sometimes hold my hand if theres a scary part(this could mean that he is either trying to stop me from covering my eyes or just wants to hold my hand) and leans on my shoulder. Its very sweet. I have this strange feeling when he is beside me and he hold my hand. I pretty much go to some school events that are not mandatory just to see him. He is the type of guy who looks like a girl. emo-hair thin body. He doesn't act like a gay-girlish person who flaunts but he acts like a shy girl. Really looks like a girl. I treat him as one. I really love him and i dont know if he feels the same way for me. Im pretty kinda defiantly maybe sure that he is gay for me. I even think he sometimes begs me to kiss him cause he looks at me when our faces are JUST TOOOO close. I also feel the strong amount of WANT AND NEED to simply press my lips against his.u know guys. there was recently an event that happened in my class. one of my friends who is really gay told they guy he was gay for. That guy said that he wasnt gay and now the whole class knows it and their friendship is now destroyed. i wont let that happened to me.   but i did ask him one night if he loved me as a friend. he said yes. I love him. How do i know if He is gay?
20090220072029AA185oi	Society & Culture;Royalty	Does the sponging ROYAL FAMILY encourage this sponging society of Great Britain?	the Royal family costs us millions. And people who are BRAIN WASHED into thinking, and saying that they bring in more are deluded. We get less tourists than France, who have no rotal family, not to mention about 100 other countries. Sure we have amazing buildings, and people would still come to see OUR castles, but I;d rather we didn't pay millions and millions a year to a bunch of spongey inbreds, so that we can reclaim the crown jewels, the art, the castles, land and buildings and they beclong to UK PLC rather than one disgusting (Queen aside) family, a huge family at that - the peripheral momebers of which (I'm, talking Prince Andrew here) use tax payer money to charter private jets to play golf with pals      Surely they encourage the sponging of other families across the country

""Today I went to the store and the bag of dog food was too heavy to lift so this man comes over and lifts it for me."      I think including the color is prejudice.

According to a review of more than 1,000 publications about girls and education, girls are treated unfairly by their teachers, their male peers, the school curriculum, and standardized tests (American Association of University Women, 1992).  Among the conclusions of the reviewers were these (Chira, 1992a):   1.Teachers pay less attention to girls than boys   2.Girls are subjected to increasing sexual harassment-unwelcome verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature-from male classmates.  Many teachers continue to tolerate such behavior.   3.School textbooks still stereotype or ignore women.  Students learn almost nothing in school about problems such as discrimination and sexual abuse.   4.Some standardized tests, such as the SAT, are biased against girls, hurting their chances of getting into college and getting scholarships.

20090220020317AA0PQnm	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Is the Bible all right or all wrong?	In the event of a very bad mistake, proved by historical texts, how can people say that the Bible was divinely inspired?   The Book of Daniel speaks of the madness of Nabuchodonosor, who took part in black magic in order to give precedence to his favourite goddess S?n when he took over Babylon. The manuscripts of the Dead Sea also speak of Nabuchodonosor and his goddess S?n.   However, both were mistaken, as it has been scientifically proved that this king was Nabonide, Nabuchodonosor's son in law, many years later, as written by the officials of Babylon on clay tablets.   Examples of historically wrong comments in the Bible are frequent, not deliberate mistakes, just HUMAN mistakes.   How can Jews and Christians base their whole lives on a few "reporters" of  palestinian antiquity?   The Bible can't be right "most of the time", that doesn't make sense ! Why would God make mistakes?

20090220022411AA8Mmu5	Society & Culture;Languages	Can you check the grammar for me?	After last year’s “getting some soy sauce” and “doing push-ups,” Web users in China have found a new catchphrase for 2009: “playing hidden cat,” or what the English-speaking world calls “hide and seek.” (In Chinese, “playing hidden cat” pronounced “duo maomao.”)       The story behind this new phrase comes from Jinning in southwest China’s Yunnan province, where a 24-year-old prisoner died from a severe brain injury four days after being sent to the hospital. Local police said the brain injury occurred when the prisoner “bumped into a wall after being kicked by another prisoner while playing hidden cat.” (Report in Chinese.)       According to the local Chinese-language media reports, the deceased young man, Li Qiaoming, was arrested on Feb. 8 for illegal logging activity and sent to a detention center. He was due home to get married on Feb. 16, but never returned.       The dead man’s family does not accept the cause of death given by the local police. Li’s father told the local press that he went to the detention house and asked to meet his son several times, but was rejected. The detention center and local police in Puning did not answer questions.

The (drunk) girl beside her said "What you saying Hi to him for, he's UGLY!!!" That has happened 1-3 times and is a cause for concern.

We have given in to the temptation to have sex, unfortunately, and we keep try to stop having sex, but all our efforts have been in vain, especially ever since we moved in together (for financial reasons).      However, the longer we go on having sex, the more I feel that the sin is keeping me from being closer to God. Both my fiance and I agree that we should stop having sex until the wedding (a little less than 4 months away). However, it is very difficult for us... does anyone have any advice to help us out with this?

To me it seems like they are tolerating his "affair" while waiting for him to meet his future wife. In fact, sometimes I suspect that at the events they do not invite her to that they are having him meet latino young ladies. Is this a typical attitude?

My simple complaint about the matter sure does heat people up!! They obviously do not like to hear someone questioning school taxes AT ALL. Do you think it is because they have kids and don't want me making their taxes go up more if childless adults didn't have to pay it anymore? If that is the case it seems like they are happy that I am sharing the bill with them, because they sure do come up with alot of condescending words for me about how "you went to school as a kid" and "investing in the future" and other rhetorical crap. Maybe they feel they are trying to nip a problem in the bud, dunno. I love people, don't get me wrong, but MAN they sure can be selfish. To me, forcing childless homeowners to pay school taxes is socialism. To have to help pay to raise someone else's pride and joy is cruel. People who have kids should pay their own way. On top of it all, they hate it if I were to tell their kids how to behave, but they sure don't mind taking money from me for their education. Double standard??

20090220012615AAK3UN6	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What's up with the 10 commandments?	I just watched Religulous (good movie by the way, watch it if you haven't) and a good point was brought up.  If God is all knowing and all just, why didn't he include every (or at least more) heinous crime in the famous 10 Commandments?  I mean things like rape, child molestation and assault?  Don't you think he should have been able to foresee and help guard against such travesty?        Seriously, when you look at the list he comes off looking a little petty and quite juvenile.  The first four involve worshiping him.  And just in case you are one of those who's afraid of another man taking your wife, he doubled up on those commandments just in case you happened to miss one.      I think if I asked a young child (with no prior knowledge of God or the commandments) to come up with a list of rules they could put into law, it would look very similar to the ones Moses supposedly etched in stone.  Of course they probably wouldn't include adultery and lying, but I have a good feeling they would want people to pay a lot of attention to them and not want people to kill each other.  I'm just saying, it's no big thing these commandments.

They spent a couple of days and nights on the farm of what would be considered a very poor family.   On their return from their trip, the father asked his son, “How was the trip?”      “It was great, Dad’”   “Did you see how poor people live?” the father asked.   “Oh yes, “said the son.   “So, tell me, what you learned from the trip?” asked the father.      The son answered: “I saw that we have one dog and they had four.”   “We have a pool that reaches to the middle of our garden and they have a river that has no end.”   “We have imported lanterns in our garden and they have the stars at night.”   “Our patio reaches to the front yard and they have the whole horizon.”   “We have a small piece of land to live on and they have fields that go beyond our sight.”   “We have servants who serve us, but they serve others.”   “We buy our food, but they grow theirs.”   “We have walls around our property to protect us; they have friends to protect them.”   The boy’s father was speechless.   Then his son added, “Thanks, Dad, for showing me how poor we are.”      Isn’t perspective a wonderful thing? Makes you wonder what would happen if we all gave thanks for everything we have, instead of worrying about what we don’t have.   Appreciate every single thing you have, especially your friends!

Cant they understand that they have caused more harm in the world than ever so many 11/9?    For me it seems like americans just cant understand. Americans asked after 11/9, why did they do this to us? Isnt that a proof of the unlimited ignorance and arrogance of the most powerful nation in the world???      Its like I go in to my neighbours house to torture and kill his wife and children and later on when I meet him he hits me in the face.      How could you do this to me? We are neighbours for Christ sake!!! Maybe he is envy cause he doesnt have as god salary as I have or as nice car, he envy my lifestyle and he doesnt allow my freedom. Well atleast I helped him with problem of supporting his familymembers    and have them as a burden. Now he is free to develope.      This is how I see on america, a country that thinks that power give the right to kill and torture, a country that values american citizens thousand times more then arabs and muslims outside US, its good that a country value its citizens high, but it doesnt mean that you can go on and kill others or that they are inferior to you.

I feel as though I have sucked in all of british culture, can speak english know their slang etc. But I dont have a lot of nigerian culture. I can say some words and phrases and I can understand most things and some/most of the slang there and I am learning about the culture but i want to be more 'fluent'. I have told them about it but still they dont always speak the language all the time or are not bothered to tell me about the culture all the time. Instead, they will speak the language and teach me but after a couple of days stop. What should I do?

20090220061628AAe2nC5	Society & Culture;Etiquette	Is this in poor taste?	I returned to work from maternity leave this week, and I pump 2 - 3 times daily.  In order to insure that no one with a master key walks into my office while I'm pumping, I put a sign on the door, and close the blinds.  When I had my first son two years ago, my sign had a picture of my son, and a note underneath saying, "I'm preparing Bernard's lunch.  Please do not disturb".  Everyone one loved it.  This time around for my 2nd son, my sign has a picture of someone milking a cow, and says, "I'm busy.  Do not disturb."  Most people in my building have thought it was funny, but someone said it was in bad taste.  I didn't want to do the same thing as I  had with my first son, because students would see the sign, and keep knocking at the door wanting to come in because they thought I had my baby in the office with me and wanted to see him.  This time I've not had that problem because they just think I'm busy and don't get the picture of the cow being milked at all.      Do you all think I should change my do not disturb sign, and if so, what do you think it should be?

20090220010030AAIGArH	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Is the Bible the 'word of God" (Current one)?	My brothers , sisters, and elders in humanity, and or faith, i greet you all with the islamic greeting, aslamunalykum, peace be on you.      The topic of my question is 'is the bible the word of god'. I want to do justice on this topic, and i want mature answers. Simply saying offensive things about the Holy Quran is not needed. I will convey this question with utmost respect. I too believe the Torah,Pslams, and New testement is God's word. However, the one's you all posses today are not the same as original given to the prophets. This discussion in on the Bible. Let me start firstly.      Personally, you are putting your selves as easy bait for the athiests christian brothers and sisters.      The current Bible is taken from a manuscripts THREE HUNDRED YEARS AFTER IT WAS REVEALED(NEW TESTEMENT).      Here is what the people who issued the revised standard version have said ;      "THE KING JAMES VERSION (alternative description of AV) HAS WITH GOOD REASON BEEN TERMED 'THE NOBLEST MONUMENT OF ENGLISH PROSE.’ ITS REVISERS IN 1881 EXPRESSED ADMIRATION FOR 'ITS SIMPLICITY, ITS DIGNITY, ITS POWER, ITS HAPPY TURNS OF EXPRESSION ... THE MUSIC OF ITS CADENCES, AND THE FELICITIES OF ITS RHYTHM.’ IT ENTERED, AS NO OTHER BOOK HAS, INTO THE MAKING OF THE PERSONAL CHARACTER AND THE PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS OF THE ENGLISH-SPEAKING PEOPLES. WE OWE TO IT AN INCALCULABLE DEBT."       Can you, dear reader, imagine a more magnificent tribute being paid to the "Book of Books" than the above? I, for one, cannot. Let the believing Christian, now steel himself for the un-kindest blow of all from his own beloved Lawyers of Religion; for in the very same breath they say:      "YET THE KING JAMES VERSION HAS GRAVE DEFECTS." And, "THAT THESE DEFECTS ARE SO MANY AND SO SERIOUS AS TO CALL FOR REVISION . . ." This is straight from the horse's mouth, i.e. the orthodox Christian scholars of "the highest eminence." Another galaxy of Doctors of Divinity are now required to produce an encyclopaedia explaining the cause of those GRAVE AND SERIOUS DEFECTS in their Holy Writ and their reasons for eliminating them.       It is also reported the current BIBLE BY CHRISTIAN STUDENTS PROBABLY HAS OVER 50,000 CONTRADICTIONS.      want the article?     http://www.jamaat.net/bible/AwakeArticle...       EVEN if you cancel them down, you will be left with alot of errors. And one error even one means its not from God. The next question you ask is is the Holy Quran free from error? Yes. It opens a chalange for EVERYONE to find a SINGLE contradiction. Many of you will now go and find red herrings, but every single one of them is fully answerd. There is not one contradiction and even those genuine athiests ADMIT THIS. This is not about the Holy Quran but here's a quote;      [004:082] Do they not then meditate on the Quran? And if it were from any other than Allah, they would have found in it many a discrepancy.            Jesus(pbuh) according to the Bible said to preach the gospel, yet the writers who wrote it, most never even met Jesus(pbuh), and lived alot longer after he died. Logically tell me if they wrote those articles letters, extracts whatever you may call, and Jesus(pbuh) lived over hundreds of years  before and preached the gospel, logic tells me he preached ANOTHER GOSPEL. the real and genuine one. Not the one written up hundreds of years after. Jesus(pbuh) according to the Bible is reported to say preach the gospel. Also there is not one chapter named " Jesus " but " Mark" Mathew" ect, and even they are thought not to have written it.         Read this article : http://www.jamaat.net/bible/Bible4-6.htm...       I have not done justice but have raised some points from this article.       I'd live to leave you with these verses from the Holy Quran ;      "When truth is hurtled against falsehood, falsehood persihes, for falsehood by its nature;bound to perish" - Surah 17:81      Please do visit the link, i am not trying to put this down your throats, this is a religion and spiritualy forum discussions are indeed allowed.      Please post mature answers, i hope no one has taken any offence, i have given christian sources for most of my points.

These were posted by a Christian a few minutes ago in an answer, and I found them all to be a little silly:      “As a scientist, I look at the world around me, and observe engineering mechanisms of such remarkable complexity that I am drawn to the conclusion of intelligent design being behind such complex order.”—ANDREW MCINTOSH, MATHEMATICIAN, WALES, UNITED KINGDOM      “The complexity of nature clearly points to a Creator. Every biological and physical system, once understood, shows incredible complexity.”—JOHN K. G. KRAMER, BIOCHEMIST, CANADA      “The order of the living world is plainly evident. It was set up by a superior Power that I personally call God. It is here that faith agrees with scientific truth. Far from contradicting it, it completes it, providing a simpler understanding of our universe.”—JEAN DORST, BIOLOGIST, FRANCE         Thoughts?
20090220071919AAqBfqI	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians, What do you think is a friendship?	Do you think it as having person be with you but not as a couple; but allow a kiss sometimes or do think it as person who is always there for you and helping you become the best version of yourself?     I am speaking in wisdom, a great wisdom; that all people have but do not want to use it because they are afraid of what might happen.  If you think a friendship is like dating; but you are not really dating; then what is the point in having a friend and call it a friendship when you are actually dating.  But if you think a friendship is to help each other; then you can him or her friend, pal, buddy or whatever and act as friends, think as friends, trust as friends or sometimes like a brother or sister.         A friendship is to help one another, make each one a better version; so they become a better person in the world.  If we don't then we make vices and hide under them; because we are scared to face the truth and then we use the vices to try to pull ourselves out of our mess; but make a bigger mess.  Oh how I long to meet my great friends in heaven; all the Church Fathers and saints; who have help me grow in wisdom.  No one on earth has helped me grow in wisdom; but the Church Fathers and holy Spirit. I say to you, learn what a friendship is, do the Will of our Heavenly Father in heaven; because then you too will grow in wisdom.
20090220070527AAjt9q1	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	If the Crucifixion was such an important event, why didn't the Apostles show up?	John was there... and Christ just calmly made arrangements with John for his mom's retirement. (doesn't sound much like he was suffering for the sins of the world to me)      And the ones who were going to preach on Christ's behalf did not even show up for the "most important event in the history of mankind?" All Christ had to say is "be there... this is important." But he said no such thing.      Personally, I think that the apostles were going out to preach the Kingdom Gospel about "treasure hid in a field," and not the gospel that came along after Christ was gone! (click on my avatar if you want more context)      So why didn't Christ ask his own Apostles to show up... if this was such an important event in the history of mankind?

(continued)      have more genetic diversity or less genetic diversity?      "For the autosomal regions included (47,038 bp) the {pi}-values are 0.105% for Africans, 0.070% for Asians, 0.069% for Europeans, and 0.097% for between Africans and Eurasians.

I've an argument that say more genetic diversity means an older and thus more "primitive" group, like, for instance, chimps have more genetic diversity than humans, and gorillas have more genetic diversity than chimps, and orangutans have more genetic diversity than gorillas.      So, I was wondering is it better to have more or less genetic diversity in a population?

20090220072159AAY2TfY	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Question Regarding Perceived Life Span Limit Imposed By God?	hey guys,      I was hoping that someone would be able to clear up an issue I have in regards to the Bible, namely that in Genesis 6 : 3       'And the LORD said, My Spirit shall always strive with man, for that he also is flesh; yet his days shall be one hundred and twenty years'       Simply put, GOD has imposed a maximum lifespan of 120 years for all man, for arguments sake lets assume that this rule only applied for further descendants of man and hence forth the current 'generation of man' is exempt from this imposition. Why is it that on numerous occasion man clearly exceeds this limit???   My first attempt at reasoning this apparent inconsistency was Noah's seed was somehow exempt due to his covenant with GOD, i.e.   Genesis 6:18   'But with thee I establish my covenant; and thou shalf come into the ark, thou and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee'      however upon reading this passage, I can not but conclude that the covenant merely existed between GOD and Noah, and hence forth does not apply to the seed of Noah      So my question is, why are descendants of Noah and by extension man allowed to break GOD's seemingly inconsequential Rule ??      Thanks in Advance,      David

I don't share religious views with my former in-laws but I don't have a problem with them taking my kids to church when they're visiting.  A while back the kids visited for a few weeks and my oldest was baptised without my permission.  He was only 7 at the time so he really had no idea what was going on.  He did it because grandma wanted him to and grandpa encouraged it because he knew I'm not christian and would be upset.  I don't have issue with the fact that my son was baptised, I'm upset that they didn't ask me first and their motives were biased.        In an area like this, not being Christian I really don't know the protocols.  Shouldn't a parent of a young child be involved in baptism decisions?
