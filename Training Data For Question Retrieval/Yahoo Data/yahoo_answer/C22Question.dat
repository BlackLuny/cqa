For example he has a theory that $7 tax break per week is good for the economy because it will be spent rather than invested. And since 2/3 of economy is consumer spending, then stimulating consumer spending must be good for the economy.       Whereas any competent economist (of which there are none in Obama's team) will tell you that $7 invested into capital goods is better for the economic growth and jobs creation by far.

I am asking for the purposes of Employment law.       I am in a new state, lets say Indiana. I am set to get a job at a good company. I indicated to them I had a misdemeanor, as new state classifies Felony and Misdemeanor. Indeed, my crime is not even a misdemeanor under Indiana law. I signed a release with the company that will investigate my -ARREST- record with my County in Indiana Sheriff's Office, and I even wonder if they are keeping it as that county in Indiana.      The interviewer mentioned he knew about my crime, as I did disclose, so I would not lose my job. He asked if I did time for it. The answer was 'No.' I was placed on Probation, and completed it successfully.      Out of NJ with no crime differentiation except Degrees, Mine was 3rd degree. This, and the fact I did not do time, are why I submitted it as Misdemeanor to the company, and also the Sheriffs office checking my arrest record.      So, my question is: Due to the tolerance of my Interviewer, and under Indiana State Law, have I successfully become a member of the company that I will be able to make good money and OT at?      Thanks...

I've been working as an AM at the same company for 4 years, I was there when the company first started and was a huge factor in helping to build the company to what it is now. As i've been there from the start, I have one of the largest lucrative client bases in the company. We recently were appointed a new Manager, who has begun to restructure the way we work.      I have always worked my database well, & have earned a sustained large amount of profit on a monthly basis for the company (￡10K+ pcm and and am up on the year by a considerble amount) I have a strong relationship with the majority of my clients, kept the database warm and rejenerate new business from it every month.       2 weeks ago, we were presented with a strict new working protocol with very little flexibilty, and were told that if we didn't stick to certain guidelines and that if leads within the database didn't meet with the new criteria by the end of this month, part of our client base would be re-allocated.       In a meeting, I mentioned that even though I was unhappy with the protocol I would re-structure the way I worked, but due to the size of my client base I would need more time. I was told by my boss that he would think about it and he would come back to me....this was 2 weeks ago, and since then I have asked him 3x whether he had made any decisions..to which he keeps putting me off, telling me he'll talk to me tomorrow, and then ignoring me.      I have been so stressed out over the situation, I've worked hours overtime trying to get everything converted, missed lunches & I'm loosing weight (which I do when i'm stressed) I'm doing everything I can to ensure that I dont loose clients..but with 4 years worth of work to deal with, and a really busy, demanding working day - without being given more time, the task is an impossibility..what happens if we get to the end of the month and I start loosing clients? (this is likely to have an effect on my income)       The company has grown too fast too quickly and it seems that they feel they could generate more business by spreading my clients around. I feel that I am in a vulnerble position and have gone from feeling secure and loving my career, to feeling insecure, and paranoid. I am going to get in touch with my union rep soon - but would be really interested in your thoughts or advice...

The specter of social unrest was raised at the U.S. Army War College in November in a monograph [click on Policypointers’ pdf link to see the report] titled “Known Unknowns: Unconventional ‘Strategic Shocks’ in Defense Strategy Development.” The military must be prepared, the document warned, for a “violent, strategic dislocation inside the United States,” which could be provoked by “unforeseen economic collapse,” “purposeful domestic resistance,” “pervasive public health emergencies” or “loss of functioning political and legal order.” The “widespread civil violence,” the document said, “would force the defense establishment to reorient priorities in extremis to defend basic domestic order and human security.”      “An American government and defense establishment lulled into complacency by a long-secure domestic order would be forced to rapidly divest some or most external security commitments in order to address rapidly expanding human insecurity at home,” it went on.      “Under the most extreme circumstances, this might include use of military force against hostile groups inside the United States. Further, DoD [the Department of Defense] would be, by necessity, an essential enabling hub for the continuity of political authority in a multi-state or nationwide civil conflict or disturbance,”   http://www.policypointers.org/Page/View/...

I look at all of their policies and decide what I agree with or don't.

In 1835, Jackson managed to reduce the federal debt to only $33,733.05, the lowest it had been since the first fiscal year of 1791.[18] President Jackson is the only president in United States history to have paid off the national debt. However, this accomplishment was short lived. A severe depression from 1837 to 1844 caused a ten-fold increase in national debt within its first year.[19]      He then worked to rescind the charter of America's central bank because:       * It concentrated the nation's financial strength in a single institution.       * It exposed the government to control by foreign interests.       * It served mainly to make the rich richer.       * It exercised too much control over members of Congress.       * It favored northeastern states over southern and western states.       http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Jack...

20090219142935AArGS98	Politics & Government;Politics	Are American liberals only against war if a Republican is in the White House?	The criminal US war in Iraq has not ended with the inauguration of President Barack Obama, and there are growing indications that it will continue even as his administration escalates the war in Afghanistan.   The architects and commanders of the military “surge” remain at their posts, from Bush’s defense secretary, Robert Gates, to Centcom chief Gen. David Petraeus and Gen. Raymond Odierno, the head of US occupation forces in Iraq. Increasingly, these military figures are making known their opposition to even the limited withdrawal proposed by Obama.   The latest to publicly voice an opinion is Lt. Gen. Frank Helmick, in charge of US training of Iraqi security forces, who told the Financial Times Monday that it would take until the end of 2011 to give these forces “a sustainable ground capability to fight the insurgency.” This follows open pressure by Petraeus and Odierno for Obama to drop his campaign pledge to withdraw US “combat troops” from Iraq within 16 months.   This plan always envisioned tens of thousands of US troops staying behind to conduct counter-insurgency operations and protect US interests in the country. The generals are reportedly urging Obama to merely reclassify large numbers of those now categorized as combat troops and keep them in Iraq as well.   It is clear that, in one form or another, the war and occupation in Iraq will go on.    http://www.wsws.org/articles/2009/feb200...     http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...    Was all this anti war talk only anti Bush and is everything OK now a Democrat is carrying out the same policies?   Thoughts, opinions?

Now my government tells me that I need to fund my neighbor who bought a house twice the size of mine; who has two 30K cars, several HD TV's mortage because he lived well above his means.  It seems to me that he was the smart one and I was the fool for paying my mortgage on time.

Agents stationed in Riverside reported being ordered to arrest at least 150 suspected illegal immigrants in January and that they were told two such arrests must lead to prosecutions, said Lombardo Amaya, president of Local 2554 of the National Border Patrol Council.      "They were told if you don't produce this, we will have to change your weekends off," Amaya said, adding that he hopes to discuss the matter Monday with the sector chief who oversees the station. "Sometimes, like in politics, this agency is about looking good."      "You don't want to encourage agents to go out and look for something that isn't there because that is when you start to get into trouble," Bonner said.

Hi I live in California and I got this ticket as I was exiting my school street. My light was green and I was going the speed limit (30mph) and I saw a cop car at the right side of the intersection. He was stopped but slowly inching forward as if he wanted to go.    He didn't have his lights on or anything and I thought maybe he's just in a hurry. As soon as I pass and I'm in the middle of the intersection I heard firefighter sirens and as I looked at the cop in my rear view mirror he proceeded straight but there was another cop behind him that made a right turn and pulled up behind me. Sure enough he turned on his lights and pulled me over. He asked why didn't I yield and I told him that I didn't hear anything until I was already in the middle of the intersection but he didn't buy it.      Anyways sorry for the long story, do you guys think that I have any chance of contesting this ticket? The cop was nice about it but unfortunately didn't buy my story (which is true I assure you).   I'm 21 years old and I have only had one ticket in the past, when I was 16 just 3 months after getting license for speeding. Since then I haven't had one citation, not even a parking ticket. Do you guys think I have a chance of fighting this or that the judge could atleast buy my story and lessen the fine, especially if I point out my driving record?      Thanks!

My husband is a Navy Corpsman - an EMT basically. He has had advanced nursing courses, Anatomy and Physiology, etc... But the college here (which is actually a whole 5 miles from base and "claims" to be military friendly, won't give him any credit for any of these advanced classes! They say they will only give him elective credit and make him take the high level stuff over again! Even though his degree doesn't require any general electives (just the normal humanities stuff in Psych and Soc). Is this the norm or are we being screwed?! If it is the norm, why in the world are we all psyched up that his college career will be easier because of his training! We can't even get the military to pay for his advanced medical training, and now they aren't giving him any credit for the classes he's already had! Can anyone please give us some advice here? Thank you!

20090220095838AA5zkN9	Politics & Government;Politics	If you borrow money from a bank / credit card, are you responsible for repayment?	I asked a question earlier this morning about this same issues.  Some one listed a bunch of points that said that I was wrong.  Here are their comments and my responses.  Who is right?       FH: It is about the banks being deceitful in their practices to get the homeowners those loans.      It will be bad if the banks seize the properties. First off, these people will have nowhere to go.      BOB: What a bunch of BS. These people can go rent a apartment. Which is what they should have done in the first place.       If the person is too ignorant to understand the terms of the loan, they should have done the following:   1) Hire a lawyer review the papers   2) Have the lawyer or bank explain the loan in plain english   3) If they do not understand the loan terms, they do not sign the loan papers.   4 hours ago      FH: Secondly, the people who live in the homes around the foreclosed will see a dramatic decrease in their property value, over the decrease that has already shown over the past years.      BOB: The value of the home is only relative unless you go to sell it. Taxes are collected on the relative value. If the value of the neighborhood goes down, you can get your taxes lowered by showing this.       If and only if you want to sell in a depressed market do you lose value in the home. Over 90% of the people are making payments on time. It is the bottom 10% of society that is dragging the economy in the toilet.   4 hours ago      FH: These people were victims of falsified securities from the banks, who knew what they were doing, and therefore these people need someone to stand up for them.      BOB: If you are too ignorant to understand what is going on, you deserve what happens to you. That is why we have Lawyers to go through these things and advise the client. Most people don't want to spend the money on an attorney. So whose fault is it that someone is ignorant?   4 hours ago      FH: Also, some of these people are people who nearly or did pay off their homes, and the banks got them to refinance knowing that the subprime mortgage market would spill over, and now these people are upside down.      BOB: Incorrect. The bank offers loan products. These people went to the bank and said I WANT TO BORROW $100,000 to pay off my credit cards, car loans, make repairs to my house, etc.       The bank gave them money in exchange for the person putting their house as collatteral. If you don't know what that is, look it up in a dictionary.       The person failed to pay the loan under the terms. So who agreed to the terms of the loan. The person who WENT to the bank and asked for a loan and willingly signed the papers.  The bank did not force them to sign the loan papers.     4 hours ago

My brothers ex-girlfriend filed a protection order on him earlier this week, a move I fully supported for the safety of my nephews, as my brother has a serious drinking problem and is now in rehab.  Well, now that she has this order, she is making life basically H*ll unbearable for my mom and I.  She has made it so that my mom can not see her grandchildren without supervision, for reasons that she can't even explain.  Now she is claiming that she can contact my brother but my brother can't contact her.  I told her that I have had a protection order before and that is not how it works.  Neither parties is to have any further contact with each other.  She now wants me to pass on messages to him, which I refuse to do.  She wants to call him, but we won't give out his information.  He feels that he is not in a place right now that he is healthy enough to have contact with his boys and he definitely does not want anything to do with his ex.  She has turned into someone I no longer know anymore.  Have the laws changed since I obtained a protection order?  Can a victim now contact the defendant of a protection order?  On the order, she states that the only way for him to contact her, is through an attorney.  Just trying to help my brother find the right advice, even though he wants no further contact with her, and is thinking of filing his own order against her.  It's turned into a huge fatal attraction deal.  And it totally sucks!!!!!

20090220095219AAP7dFS	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Legal question: Custody of a child, what do you think is going to be the outcome?	My husbands seven year old son (my stepson) came to live with us this last August, his mom just wanted my husbands help while she finished school so in two years she wanted their son to go back and live with her again. My husband says he never agreed to this and has proof of that and she still handed their son over. They are going to battle this out in court, both of them have attorneys and I think both have legitimate enough reasons as to why their son should live with either of them (my husband wasnt very involved in his sons life until a couple years ago). My stepsons mom isn't by any means an unfit mother and if we ask him where he wants to live he says with her. My husband is at work a lot but involved when he is home. I just wonder what is more than likely going to happen, what the judge is going to come up with, things like that.

I got into a very bad situation as it seems to me, because I have never had any problems with a law, except one speeding ticket couple years ago. I currently live in FL, first I had DL from Florida, then I had to move to Georgia, where I got my Georgia DL, then I got back to Florida and kept my Georgia DL. My license tag has always been from Florida,  I never changed it. I got pulled over yesterday by the policeman. Since I 'm not American citizen, he called immigration on me and told me that my DL expired two years ago, which was the reason why he stopped he (but my GA DL expires in 2016 and should be in their system). So the Immigration guys (if they were really Immigration, but not just regular cops who pretended to be Homeland Security), asked for my Immigration papers, not even introducing themselves. Well, I gave them my DL and Work Authorization, they both were fine and valid. After they checked everything, they gave it all back to me and said that I had to go get FL driver's license and show up in the court. My work Authorization is gonna expire in about a month, without the new one, they won't give me a new DL, but the court date is before, than I can get my work authorization renewed in order to get a new DL. I'm afraid, that if I go to the court with my old GA DL, because I won't be able to get FL DL without a new Work Authorization from Immigration, they'll put me in jail or make me pay some huge fine for having violated the law. Any suggestions about what's gonna happen to me next?

While I DID cross the line, it was only for about 10 feet, and to get to the turn lane. I have seen countless people do it, and there was no oncoming traffic, meaning it was perfectly safe. I also did it when there was already space in the left turn lane, meaning I wouldn't be parked with my butt in traffic.      I know that you are allowed to run red lights that have been stuck at red, as long as it's safe. I know that you're (in one of those famous catch-22s) allowed to go faster than the speed limit if it's the flow of traffic, although that's a different issue entirely.   The point is, I know that if a maneuver is safe, it is usually not brought up.   Is this purely colloquial, and the officers I see going 50 in 40 zones (with the flow of traffic) are breaking the law? When the police ignore people changing lanes without a blinker, but safely, they're breaking the law?      I'm not thinking 100% best right now, so I apologize if my examples suck, but I'd appreciate any help.      Thanks guys,   Justin.

Why Rush is Wrong    The party of Buckley and Reagan is now bereft and     dominated by the politics of Limbaugh. A conservative's lament.     by David Frum          Excerpt:    "On the one side, the president of the United States: soft-spoken and conciliatory, never angry, always invoking the recession and its victims. This president invokes the language of "responsibility," and in his own life seems to epitomize that ideal: He is  physically honed and disciplined, his worst vice an occasional cigarette. He is at the same time an apparently devoted husband  and father. Unsurprisingly, women voters trust and admire him.       And for the leader of the Republicans? A man who is aggressive and bombastic, cutting and sarcastic, who dismisses the  concerned citizens in network news focus groups as "losers." With his private plane and his cigars, his history of drug dependency  and his personal bulk, not to mention his tangled marital history, Rush is a walking stereotype of self-indulgence—exactly the image  that Barack Obama most wants to affix to our philosophy and our party. And we're cooperating! Those images of crowds of  CPACers cheering Rush's every rancorous word—we'll be seeing them rebroadcast for a long time.       Rush knows what he is doing. The worse conservatives do, the more important Rush becomes as leader of the ardent remnant. The better conservatives succeed, the more we become a broad national overning coalition, the more Rush will be sidelined.       But do the rest of us understand what we are doing to ourselves by accepting this leadership?  Rush is to the modern GOP what Jesse Jackson was to the Democratic party in the 1980s.       Before responding please note David Frum is not known to be a Democrat.
20090203085933AAjN8pH	Politics & Government;Politics	Is it change you can believe in when the US continues with "extraordinary renditions" and secret CIA prisons?	Analysis of the executive orders US President Barack Obama signed on January 22 shows that the Untied States will continue to be heavily involved in illegal practices including kidnapping, secret detention and torture. The orders ostensibly ended torture and a network of secret Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) prison camps.  The Los Angeles Times published a report on the executive orders, however, showing that they allow the continued use of "extraordinary rendition" by the CIA, whereby the US secretly abducts individuals it claims are terrorists, sending them to nations that practice torture.  Obama is not only contemplating preserving rendition; he foresees using it more than the Bush administration. The Los Angeles Times cites unnamed US intelligence officials who say, "The rendition program might be poised to play an expanded role going forward because it was the main remaining mechanismaside from Predator missile strikesfor taking suspected terrorists off the street"  Obama's preservation of the criminal elements of the war on terrorism, albeit with somewhat different packaging, should come as no surprise. Torture, extraordinary rendition, military tribunals, secret prisonsthese are in fact the consensus policies of the US ruling elite, defended by the Democratic Party as well as the Republicans. All these measures were communicated to, and approved by, leading Democrats in Congress during the Bush administration. The Democrats did nothing to reverse these policies after their sweeping victory in the congressional elections of 2006, and they will do no more now.  http://www.wsws.org/articles/2009/feb200...

Some people of conscience have stood up to aver that the occasional user should not be villified or incarcerated.  Organizations like LEAP (Law Enforcement Against Prohibition) and others - URLs below - are stimulating the social conscience of reasonable, rational, intelligent  citizens.  They are saying loud and clear that NOW is the time to stand up, tell the cowards in power that the failed, moronic policies of the past must  be changed.  (I have not presented the 'other' side of the issue because there's so much government propaganda out there, we all know what they say..)      Do you think it's time for change?  Do you believe that those in power positions who have their own draconian, self-righteous political and social agendas should hold the citizen taxpayers hostage to their own egos, fears, and misinformed beliefs?      DO YOU THINK IT'S TIME TO CHANGE THE LAWS AND LEGALIZE THE USE OF MARIJUANA?  WHY/WHY NOT?              http://www.leap.cc/cms/index.php     http://org2.democracyinaction.org/o/5663...        http://stopthedrugwar.org/     https://www.decriminalizemarijuana.org/     http://stopthedrugwar.org/chronicle/573

An Obama administration official said the total plan commits up to $275 billion for housing, including $50 billion from funds already committed in the country's financial sector bailout. It aims to help up to 9 million American families.       I paid off my home in 5 years.  I'm thinking of taking out a half million dollar mortgage on it and NOT PAYING it so Obama helps ME too.

"Less than half the money dedicated to highways, school construction and other infrastructure projects in a massive economic stimulus package unveiled by House Democrats is likely to be spent within the next two years, according to congressional budget analysts, meaning most of the spending would come too late to lift the nation out of recession.      A report by the Congressional Budget Office found that only about $136 billion of the $355 billion that House leaders want to allocate to infrastructure and other so-called discretionary programs would be spent by Oct. 1, 2010. The rest would come in future years, long after the CBO and other economists predict the recession will have ended."

I guess he encourages North  Korea to test its long range missile's range to see if it can hit the United States.

North Korea last week scrapped all agreements with South Korea, a move analysts said was in response to Seoul's tough policies toward Pyongyang as well as designed to grab the attention of U.S. President Barack Obama.

During the Depression years of hunger, the New Deal ordered the slaughter of 6 million pigs. The theory (see President Roosevelt's May 14, 1935, speech on the Agricultural Adjustment Act) was, believe it or not, that one cause of the Depression—in 1935, people were selling apples on the streets; 20.1 percent were unemployed—was a "problem of overproduction."       Government, FDR said, could keep production and consumption "in reasonable balance" so that farmers could charge "reasonable prices," as government intuited them.       Last week Congress was importuned to have the government pay for the slaughter of dairy cattle in order to raise milk prices.       Cows should die in Wisconsin so that mothers in Watts will pay a higher price—one that government deems "reasonable"—for milk for their children?

"The American people are watching," Obama told a gathering of mayors at the White House. "They need this plan to work. They expect to see the money that they've earned — they've worked so hard to earn — spent in its intended purposes without waste, without inefficiency, without fraud."         Personally I think its awesome.

By then, I'll be smack in the middle of A-school for the other rating.      What is required in order to switch ratings, besides the obvious answer of cleaning up my credit?

Also working on increasing acceptability income for trade schools that work through Virginia Employment Commission to teach other more trades.       Acceptance trade approval for VEC person would have to make under $7,000/yr for them to study a trade. Dont you think we need raised to atleast to $24,000 or even $27,000 a year or lower?(i recently found this out)      We then should take the Stimulas Package away until later when America can get back on good grounds with jobs. I dont care about the people to that certain extent we need jobs not give people free handouts! We also dont need reward people that doesnt wanna work either.

20090203091724AAOcIzg	Politics & Government;Military	If I was dropped from rolls (DFR), how can this affect my chance of staying in the ARMY?	I say this because I got dropped from rolls.My unit is currently deployed (they return back in a couple of days.) And I should be turning myself in soon. But where do I go? Back to my unit that's deployed still? Or back to my unit's base in the US? I know the decision whether or not I can stay with my unit is all up to my unit commander to decide. But who will do that if he is still deployed? Who will determine my faith on whether or not I should stay in my unit? Or get kick-out with a BCD? Or spend jail time, or something like that? Who will determine all of this? And what if I'm already accused of desertion? What would that do to me? My PSG, My LT, & even my Company Commander believes that I intended on being a deserter. And I have lost their trust and faith in me. So, where does that leave me? I probably screw up already. I'll probably get kick-out, huh? So, I should just go to any military installation rather than my unit's base, right? And deal with my case there, right? Please, I'm so really eager for some answers here!!!

20090410155106AA7XWPa	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Grandparents Rights.. Just how much can they do?	So I was wondering, I have a one year old son. My mother is married to an abusive man, he is currently in prison for beating the crap out of her, he broke bones in her face and chest. He also has a history of doing these things, and worse. Its not the first time. She is still with him, because he said he has found God, and is sorry and all that. So when he gets out in Aug. 2010, she's going to let him move into her house again with her and her 3 young children. I've told her that when that happens I will no longer let her visit my son alone. I don't want to let her bring him around this man knowing that he can be dangerous. She can't protect her own three children, how is she going to protect mine, if he decides to beat her again? So she pulls the 'Grandparents Rights' card, and says she'll take me to court. I did not say she can't see her grandson at all, I told her she [and the kids] are welcome to my home, but I don't want her to bring her husband around, I won't have anything to do with a person like that. What I want to know is, what can she really do? Do I have the right to protect my son? After all I am not denying her visitations with my son, I just don't want her to take him for day trips alone. What do you think?

Forcing many America to go out and buy smaller, more fuel efficient cars.       Since we are driving better fuel efficient cars, the government ever hungry for it's rightfully entitled tax revenue, is not collecting as much tax money on gas sales.      So what is their solution? Tax you by the mile. Which means BIG BROTHER will once again INVADE your like and track everywhere you go. probably by inserting a GPS unit in your car.

20090220073507AAhbICd	Politics & Government;Politics	Given the political climate and economy, do you think 35K for goody bags at the Oscars is excessive?	I'm tired of liberal Hollywood people crying out for "the poor and needy" when they are hypocrites.  I just heard Wolfgang Puck interviewed this morning about the fabulous meals, then I heard about $35,000 spent on fancy goody bags for the attendees to take home.   Considering the fancy dresses, limos and whatnot, I guess this group will probably spend millions on this one evening?  People worship them and they are already rich from their high paid Hollywood "jobs" and yet here is more public excess.     I would have been happy if they all agreed to donate 35K to feed the hungry or back to the CA ailing budget, as most of them seem to live in CA.  It's just very frustrating to see excesses like this when so many are needy and in trouble.  In consideration of our economy, I think other things could have been done.  I have no problem with them getting awards, but this bothers me greatly.  Then, to top it off, when they accept their awards, there will probably be lofty speeches about taking care of everyone and in support of Obama.   What they spend on goody bags (which contain expensive SPA gift certificates and the like) would support one CA needy family for a year, I'm sure.     So, what do you think of it all?

20090220074409AApYjR7	Politics & Government;Politics	Do we need someone like this in UK?	Prime Minister Kevin Rudd - Australia       Muslims who want to live under Islamic Sharia law were told on Wednesday to get out of Australia , as the government targeted radicals in a bid to head off potential terror attacks..          Separately, Rudd angered some Australian Muslims on Wednesday by saying he supported spy agencies monitoring the nation's mosques. Quote:       'IMMIGRANTS, NOT AUSTRALIANS, MUST ADAPT. Take It Or Leave It. I am tired of this nation worrying about whether we are offending some individual or their culture. Since the terrorist attacks on Bali , we have experienced a surge in patriotism by the majority of Australians. '       'This culture has been developed over two centuries of struggles, trials and victories by millions of men and women who have sought freedom'       'We speak mainly ENGLISH, not Spanish, Lebanese, Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Russian, or any other language. Therefore, if you wish to become part of our society . Learn the language!'       'Most Australians believe in God. This is not some Christian, right wing, political push, but a fact, because Christian men and women, on Christian principles, founded this nation, and this is clearly documented. It is certainly appropriate to display it on the walls of our schools. If God offends you, then I suggest you consider another part of the world as your new home, because God is part of our culture.'       'We will accept your beliefs, and will not question why. All we ask is that you accept ours, and live in harmony and peaceful enjoyment with us.'       'This is OUR COUNTRY, OUR LAND, and OUR LIFESTYLE, and we will allow you every opportunity to enjoy all this. But once you are done complaining, whining, and griping about Our Flag, Our Pledge, Our Christian beliefs, or Our Way of Life, I highly encourage you take advantage of one other great Australian freedom, 'THE RIGHT TO LEAVE'.'         'If you aren't happy here then LEAVE. We didn't force you to come here. You asked to be here. So accept the country YOU accepted.'          Maybe if we circulate this amongst ourselves, WE will find the courage to start speaking and voicing the same truths.
