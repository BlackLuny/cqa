LkDgsxGbaa	I have been a waitress for 25 years and I have worked at every type of restaurant possible.  4 years ago I came across a cafe in Central Texas and I noticed that the servers seemed very happy, so I applied.  After I was hired I realized why the servers were so happy.  The clientele, for the most part, are very friendly and are usually low maintenance.  The money is fantastic for the hours that you work.  The bosses are a couple that have been together for more than 30 years and they know how to take care of their staff.  I don't have to deal with high drama from my co-workers and the staff are all highly qualified with many years of experience.  Everyone pitches in and helps and there is none of the silly bickering about whose duty is whose, that I have found in all my other jobs.  I work 3-4 hour shifts and I make anywhere from $50 to $200 dollars a shift, which isn't bad for 4 hours of work.  The servers only tip out a very small percentage to the bussers and that is it.  I'm not required to supplement the income of all the other positions, which chain restaurants require.  2 months ago our cafe was named one of the top restaurants in the December issue of Texas Monthly and it has received numerous other honors.  Not only is it a great place to work, it also is a place I can feel proud to be a part of.  Waiting tables can be enjoyable and I'm very happy you have found a place that you love.  No one should dread going to work everyday.|`|AA10443060	i work in a small town steak house run by the V.F.W.  love it!!

Absolutely not, the best pie makers are those special little places that exist in every town or city where a person or persons have experience, us high quality materials with those magical qualities that some bakers seem to sprinkle onto everything they make.

cobNiiLraa	Ya... I'm not saying that sugar is actually "Good" for you, but at least sugar is a NATURAL product (meaning, it comes from the earth)...<br>  <br>  whereas... did you know that MOST pop today is sweetened with High Fructose Corn Syrup (which is man-made, and NOT a natural product).<br>  <br>  High Fructose Corn Syrup is actually banned in Europe.  I don't really know why for sure, I've just heard that it is.  It makes you wonder why though... doesn't it??<br>  <br>  You can still get Coke sweetened with real cane sugar in a bottle from Mexico.  Also makes you wonder why they still use sugar in Mexico, but not here in the U.S.?? <br>  <br>  People used to think Coke was good for a person's health.  Not that it ever really was though...<br>  <br>  Coke even used to actually contain "Cocaine" back in the early days of the drink...<br>  <br>  You can read more about it at this link:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coca-Cola" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coca-Cola</a>|`|AA10412319	to much sugar, the calories and the caffeine|`|MtoIxY6Qaa	it has looots of caffine, and too much caffine can cause diabetes or heart disease. =)|`|XbRc9Hdaaa	It's really acidic.

I have looked at their part of the Young's website and it seems nothing special.  I imagine you could get all sorts of special offers like two for one on main courses etc.  The word nice probably sums this pub up, it will be nice but will not make you wish to go back unless you like non-descript food at cheap prices served in a non-descript place.

That it is $1 per person deposit to hold the room, she said if it is for children they may not charge the deposit.|`|gaXUIduMaa	The private rooms are free unless you are trying to reserve a room for 50 and only have a party of 5 or you do not intend to order food.|`|AA11100368	youre going to have to ask the individual resturant but probably nothing but the cost of a buffet/person if you give them enough notice
