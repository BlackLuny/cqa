20090202103836AA9ZyQa	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Should I read the book "Les Misérables"?	I've heard it's a fantastic book and one of the best. I always have trouble finding books I'm interested in. I'm good at reading, so I'm not worried that I won't understand the story. I was just astounded when I saw the length and size of the text of the book in Barnes and Nobel. Is there anyone that has read this that can give me some good insight? Thanks!
20090202104030AAwO5zS	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Great Expectations theme?	I'm writing an essay about the theme of appearance vs. reality in Great Expectations.  I already have a few ideas:    1. appearance:  Mrs. Havisham is Pip's benefactor      reality:  the convict, Magwitch, is the benefactor    2. appearance:  Estella was meant for Pip      reality:  she wasn't, and she didn't love him    3. appearance:  Estella is beautiful and charming      reality:  beneath the surface, she is cold-hearted, apathetic, and incapable of love    4. appearance:  Magwitch is rough, dirty, and uneducated      reality:  he is a kind, caring, successful man    On my last test, my teacher asked us to provide two examples to support this.  I used the first two, and my teacher said they both fit into the same category.  I think she would feel the same way about the third and fourth (that they should be one support paragraph).    I need one more example that fits this theme.  Any ideas?

I am working on a preservation project and I am currently looking at glass plate negatives. I'm having an issue figuring out what type they are. I believe they are dry-plate glass negatives due to the uniformity in size, but I cannot tell the emulsion/gelatin side from the photograph side because there are two plates of glass, instead of just one.

20090202105058AAeZUwM	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Help with details on this story?	Ok, I'm beginning to write a novel that came to me in a day dream about a boy who was on the beach with a girl at night. He still had on his shirt, and she goes, "You should take off your shirt, you aren't fat or anything." and he says, "It's not like that. There's something I need to show you."   So he takes off his shirt and shows her the autopsy scars going across his chest.   I have several options as to how this story can go.   One, he was born without a heart. And somehow, his blood still flows. If I choose this option, what's to make this sound believable?   Two, there is a prophecy out about a heartless one. (Him being the one) and therefore, a scientist took him away and injected him with a drug that keeps your heart faintly beating when he was a young boy, enabling surgery to take place so they can cruelly study him.   Or three, some other route to make something IMPACT the way the REST of the story goes, and therefore affect the outcome of what is to happen to the two characters.   Ideas? Suggestions? Thoughts?   I'm open(:

20090202105053AAnBqSE	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Does anyone know this futuristic short story?	It's so blurry in my head cause I read it a long time ago in class!   But it was supposed to be written by this 19th century writer, who wrote about a civilization that lived under the surface of the earth because it was so polluted, and they used these round 'mirrors' to communicate with each other. They lived in really simplistic rooms, not much decorated nor colorful, just basics.    The only thing I remember is this man, who visited his mother (who was pretty old) and then he decided to go over to the surface of the earth to find something, but was a really dangerous quest.   I hope I didn't get the facts wrong, but if anyone remembers this or the author, I'd really appreciate it!

Tutta grazia e tutta sfumature,    nello splendore dei suoi sedici anni,    ha candore e civetterie innocenti    propri di una bambina.       I suoi occhi, che sono occhi d'un angelo,    sanno tuttavia, senza pensarvi,    risvegliare lo strano desiderio    di un bacio immateriale.       E la sua mano, piccola a tal punto    da non poter tenere un colibrì,    imprigiona il cuore che lei ha preso    di nascosto, e non fa sperare fuga.       L'intelligenza, in lei, giunge in soccorso    alla nobile anima; lei è pura    e spirituale: quello che ha detto    doveva proprio dirlo!       Se pure la stoltezza la diverte    e la fa ridere senza pietà,    ella sarebbe, se fosse una musa,    clemente fino a diventare amica,       fino all'amore - chi lo sa? può darsi,    nei confronti di un poeta innamorato    che mendicasse sotto la finestra,    audace, un degno premio       per la sua canzone, bella o brutta,    ma testimoniando onestamente,    senza note false né sciocchezze,    il dolce male che si soffre amando.

20080928145421AAXlSHI	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Is this story introduction good?	Its based in Burkina Faso, and about a boy and his tribe on the run, when they go to war with the goverment. If they are found, they will be exiled to Ghana. Its geared towards 13-16 year olds. And it is pretty intense. Here is what I have SO FAR for Chapter One, tell me if its any good: BTW, I am 13 years old.      Chapter One.      Nothing at all ever happened out of the ordinary in my village. Thank you very much. People came and went as they pleased, kept to themselves, and always prided each other when they had a rice bowl full of gossip to spread while they conversed over a repast at Temple every week. Laughing over many old stories, throwing their hands up this way and that, and chuckling until the red-sun fell from the sky and decided to hide between the mountain tops. I for one, since the day I was born, had been claimed “Out Of The Ordinary”, by the village Shaman, who told the inhabitants I would bring our tribe people bad luck, and dishonor to our name.   Infact, I do not ever recall being called my own name, or being addressed directly. My name had been granted to me: “Morowa’s son”. Morowa being my mother, who just happened to be the prestigious wife of the village chief, who had said many times “Had sinned and been cursed with me as a son.” Many have kissed her feet, and hadn’t stopped chanting she is the most beautiful in all of Burkina Faso. But I see otherwise. She is nothing but a snake, who curls up in my dreams, hissing and striking with her deadly venom, never giving me a moments rest.      I remember the one day when I wasn’t the only one for miles who was out of ordinary, the one day, when everyone seized their speech, peered their heads out of their tall shrubs, and stopped whatever they were doing. The day, when I saw from my bedroom window, a knobby old cart, pulled by a knobby old ox, and who held a knobby old man, rumble up the village pathway, bouncing and turning over the many ruts and bumps that burdened the road to our homes. I however, pushed open the small window made of thin sticks, and examined the strange man, who had appeared to arrive unannounced. He was terribly old, with small brown teeth, long skinny lags, and the most wrinkled face I had ever seen in my fourteen years of life. A long weathered sign bumped and batted from the back of the cart, held on by an old rotted piece of rope:         F O R T U N E T E L L I N G      See what your fortune has in store for you.      I hadn’t ever heard of that strange word ‘fortune’, and looking back now, I wish I hadn’t ever come across those seven letters. I would soon learn my ‘fortune’ wouldn’t turn out to be a happy fairy-tale. If I was given three words to describe it, that would be easy.   Bewildering. Terrifying. Scary.

20090202122641AAVg8H2	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Does Anyone Know The Title of This Book?	I read this book many years ago, when a daughter of a friend borrowed it from her school's library.  She was in her early teens then, so I'm guessing it is geared for readers that age.  I've asked her, but she doesn't really remember it.      The book's protagonist is a young male and each chapter deals with his life on different "planes", though not airplanes.  I guess "dimensions" is a better term but the book definitely called them "planes".        Memory is a bit hazy, but I think in one chapter he went to work with his father and in another he is or was getting married.      I get the feeling that the book is about how your life can be very different depending on the surrounding circumstances.        It sounded like something Bradbury would write, but I know it's not his work.      Any help would be appreciated as it's been driving me crazy for a while now.

20090205101112AA1KCub	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Can you recite any Shakespeare by heart?	If so, what passage and why?      I know this, which is from the character Ariel in "The Tempest"      Full fathom five thy father lies;   Of his bones are coral made;   Those are pearls that were his eyes;   Nothing of him that doth fade   But doth suffer a sea-change   Into something rich and strange.   Sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell.   Hark! now I hear them, - Ding-dong, bell.      The reason I know this one is because when I was in high school we read "The Tempest" in English and we had to choose a passage to memroize and recite to the class. I chose this one because I like the magical, mysterious quality to it.      I don't know why, but for some reason I have never forgotten it.

Hiya,   I use paintshop pro x for fixing old photographs that then go onto a genealogy(family history) site. Up until now I've had no problems with any of it. But now, I'm noticing a number of pics that I've put up on the genie site are all 'black', no pic whatsoever, just a black rectangle/square. I make sure the format is jpg so it can't be that, I make sure the pics aren't too big etc. The photos are usually quite old and in need of repair, ie; getting rid of water marks, stains, scratches etc, so I usually just do a 'noise removal' first, sometimes some 'smudging', and softening. What could be causing the pics to turn out black,. They aren't black on my computer, only on the genie site.    Any help or advice greatly appreciated.

20090202025630AAzw9q1	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Um saral de filosófia.............?	Citando a express?o de Dostoiévski. A grande falácia aqui é o postulado de que Deus determina a moral, que obviamente é falso, n?o se sustenta, uma vez que existem ateus morais e crist?os amorais.         Aos que têm dificuldade nessa quest?o, sugiro o mesmo experimento mental , e que muitos simplesmente se recusam a fazer, talvez por medo de encararem uma mudan?a de paradigma. Consiste no seguinte: mesmo acreditando em Deus, imagine-se num universo em que ele n?o exista. Como seria aferida sua moral? Pense nas coisas que você n?o faz porque dizem que Deus reprova, como as citadas no texto: homicídio, roubo, estupro, agress?o. Você se sentiria livre para fazê-las?      Em caso negativo, é sinal de que existem outros meios de decidir a instancia moral de cada ato, e n?o é à toa que existem hojes tantas teorias morais n?o religiosas.       Em caso positivo... bem, para o bem da sociedade, é melhor que você mantenha sua religi?o. Nesse aspecto concordo com o Sant'Ana que a religi?o é uma boa ferramenta de dometica??o, ou seja, é útil, mas utilidade n?o implica veracidade. A idéia do Papai Noel também pode ser útil, no sentido de ajudar a manter as crian?as comportadas - domesticá-las - mas isso n?o a torna necessariamente verdadeira. Do mesmo modo, do fato de a religi?o dar base moral para as pessoas que nele acreditam n?o se segue necessariamente que Deus existe

Recuerdo cuando me inscrib en un taller de dibujo y el profesor me dijo que no serva para esto. Eso fue a los 18 a?os. Aunque en la Universidad estudi Historia del Arte, me siento vaca. Intent varias veces hacer el exmen en la Academia de Bellas Artes y nunca me presentaba el da de la evaluacin. Ahora tengo 26 a?os, mi esposo me regala siempre juagos de acuarelas y leos, pinceles, etc. Pero tengo miedo. Es un dilema, me siento vaca y a la vez tengo miedo de enfrentarme al dibujo y a la pintura. A veces lloro mucho... Me pueden ayudar?    Saludos
