Tiph3lQcaa	I may be jaded, but I believe that a fixed wing aircraft (even for fighter missions) is inherently safer than a helicopter, where too many things can go wrong that will end up in the sudden onset of trajectory - type flight. I prefer fighters.|`|VCzsfVM5aa	i would love to fly a raptor.  helicopter pilot is very good skill though, requires the use of both legs and arms as welll as reading all your gauges.  But given a chance to fly a raptor i would choose fighter pilot.|`|C93Z5CYJaa	Fighter pilot, because you pull more G's Sort of like riding a roller coaster on steroids. But it depends on your personal opinion and what you would rather do, watch things blow up or go REALLY REALLY REALLY fast.|`|AA10721549	everyone here who join the armed forces academy here wants to be a jet pilot. (yes academy produces ALL pilots for the armed forces here and yes we have entire helicopter fleet under Air force command)<br>  <br>  However this is sorted with respect to the AF needs (usually to what AF needed two years ago) so basically one year a group of twelve students with familiar names happen to be headed towards trasports (cheap way to airlines) the other year's batch ends up as copilots for Hips for the Afghan mission.<br>  <br>  i wanted to fly a MiG23. due to modernisation of our air force these were grounded while i was in the 4th semester. i wanted to fly Su 25. those were grounded while i was in 6th semester.<br>  <br>  Modernisation went well, so following the grounding of Su 22 Fitters the MiG21 happened to be the top notch fighter of our airforce again in year 2000 AD. (Yeah they called this modernisation)<br>  <br>  I happened to start the helicopter training anyway, giving way to jets to the "better" ones.<br>  Today i would not change this career.<br>  <br>  i managed to join a highly proffesional team with excellent commanders who had been able to take the training and real operations to the fullest, and who kept the SAR squadron as their child.<br>  <br>  What I can tell you is that helicopter flying is MORE demanding and needs MORE independent and MORE self responsible people.<br>  You will fly in poor weather, with no choice of overflying it, YOU will need to take decisions to cancel the flight...<br>  Most of all this is the way to serve the people (which in my country is the only way how to make army reciprocate to its taxpayers) - flying SAR/HEMS is a most rewarding job (in my eyes) You will know once you give a child another chance to spend its life.<br>  best regards.|`|XsZsk55Jaa	Helicopter hands down.  150 knots at 200 feet is exhilarating compared to 1,000 knots at 40,000 feet where it seems you're not even moving.  6 Gs hurts, it's not fun.  If you want to fire a gun, rockets, and blow stuff up I suspect your best opportunity would be in an Apache.

mWZ9BXIdaa	Wft...No idea how too much oil and overwork gears in the gearbox. The gearbox is a completly separate component with it's own oil.<br>  <br>  Over filling the oil can cause the engine to breath a bit heavily as the crank webs churn the oil and you slight risk blowing the main bearing seals. But put simply the car will be fine, it's not a big deal.|`|F5PUol8vaa	I really doubt you put wayyyy too much oil. It would take a lot of extra oil to do any damage. I'm wondering if you are sure you added too much or if it was ok and then something else went wrong and leaked something in the crankcase causing the overfill condition. Double check the oil level before you drive any more, note exactly where it is on the stick, then after a short drive, let it cool and check the oil level again. If it is again overfilled, you have another problem and need to get that fixed.|`|QbJB1G0qaa	did it once. way too much would cause engine to run poorly. too much can hurt seals. if it is running fine now don't worry. drive on|`|fRWNOoRfaa	too much oil over works the gears in the gearbox but better more than less|`|zOIgzIy4aa	you might have lucked out. overfilling it like that you have a chance of blowing a gasket or a seal.|`|dtXzOGoKaa	I'm think you have answered your own question xx

ooTfG1e9aa	Not knowing the type of vehicle you have, the problem is most likely in the blend door or the heater control valve. Either type of system is used to regulate the heat from the heater core. <br>  <br>  The blend door routes incoming air through the heater core for heat or diverts the incoming air around the heater core for vent or a/c. The door actuator, either vacuum or electric motor, is probably damaged and the door is stuck in the heat mode.<br>  <br>  If you have a heater control valve, it regulates the flow of water through the heater core. The valve may have failed and be stuck open. These valves are typically vacuum or cable operated.|`|1JLGChvZaa	have you checked the coolent level in the radiator header tank, only do this when the engine is cold, sometimes the cooling system can get an airlock causing the problems you are experiencing there is a proper procedure to cure this problem, you could get hurt by hot water ,so its best to take your car to a garage to get it sorted.|`|JjiX0ghYaa	i dont know if your car has elec.or manual.likely door for heater core is stuck shut|`|8DN2jyRsaa	perhaps a problem with the heater matrix?|`|G6t2O9Kmaa	If there is a delay after you change your vent setting (windscreen or front vents) then it is electric and has an electrical problem.

ejbSFv0caa	Well in the UK we can go to the site below for comparisons of Insurance Groups.  That can give you some idea of how your particualr cars would cost over here.<br>  <br>  There may be a similar site in the US?<br>  <br>  Not knowing the two cars well enough , but guessing I would expect the Lexus to be a higher cost.  The charges are based upon how much it costs to repair your vehicle so a cheap model will cost a lot less|`|M79W3Ct9aa	All right all right.  You asked for our opinion.<br> <br> I think the Lexus will be SLIGHTLY higher at first.  After time passes I think the premium will go lower to what you pay now, provided you don't get tickets with the car or anything.  <br> <br> The IS series is known for performance so it will be a little higher like all other performance cars.  However,  mature drivers are the ones who usually drive these cars and the maturity combined with all the safety features you would typically find in a Lexus leads me to the SLIGHTLY higher premium that will eventually go down.   <br> <br> You gonna tell us who was closest to being right or something and give 'em best answer?|`|5XYlHv6Paa	I would call your insurer, it will take 5 minutes.<br>  <br>  However, just because a car costs more money, does not mean it costs more to insure. Lexuses are extremely safe, and safety features take a lot of $ off the insurance price.<br>  <br>  My 07 BMW cost $105 to insure, and my 08 jeep is $120.|`|sDKCX43caa	Yes it will be higher. It will not have had any depreciation taken off it.|`|55a7c9ee13be4af0516d03c798a92a60aa	dont know but you could just cal your insurance company and find out easy
Tiph3lQcaa	Certainly. There are many kinds of autopilots. Some just hold altitude and heading, while others make certain flight regimes easier to handle for the pilot. The B52 had both kinds. You could use the first type to lighten the load during long nav legs. But there was also an autopilot to alter the back pressure on the flight controls for low level terrain following or for aerial refueling.|`|zlPAVkUBaa	I can tell you that they whine if it doesn't work, so you can come to your own conclusion.<br>  <br>  Many of their flights are long, so I can't blame them. But, that's why they get the free leather jacket and extra money!<br>  <br>  ADDED: A moron? You take life too seriously Skypilot. I used to fly with C130 Blackbird crews on long flights, and many of the zippersuits were my friends. I tweaked the TF RADAR they used so WE could do low level drops. If you or any of the other people here can't see a little humor in my writings, then I'm sorry for you all. If I didn't admire what they do when flying the iron, I wouldn't still be doing it after 34 years.<br>  <br>  What really gets me is that you were in the military and can't take a little ribbing. It's a good thing you weren't part of maintenance, you'd never have survived. We constantly hit on each other any way we can. It's the only way to keep sane doing the work we do with the few people we have anymore. <br>  <br>  There's one thing I certainly don't do though, give thumbs downs. That would take a real moronic I.Q.<br>  <br>  ADDED: Fine, nuff said. I worked 141s for 11 years as well.|`|AGQI3NuXaa	As opposed to ground pilots??|`|379b18fddd29f1b64385008f275bdd61aa	All pilots use autopilot when it is appropriate. It is necessary especially on long trips to reduce pilot fatigue.|`|fbxqLErlaa	Of course they do.<br>  Look up info on the B-2 bomber.  That plane has autopilot.  Can navigate to and from the target.  Pilot and Mission Commander monitor the systems.  That's not to say it is easy to fly the B-2. but given the duration of some of the missions, upwards of 30 hours and one mission lasting 50 hours, auto pilot is a real blessing.

If you do not have a lift kit on your truck, i would take it to a tire/suspension/4x4 shop and tell them to "crank/tighten the torsion bars" about an inch (it will not be expensive at all). This will raise the front end of your truck, making it level and not lean forward like all stock trucks do. Doing this will allow you to fit bigger tires without them rubbing when you turn. It is safe as long as it isn't much more than an inch. You will have to get an alignment job done afterward but that is usually a given when getting new tires anyway, so no worries. I am not familiar with 20-inch rim tire sizes, but any tire manufacturer's website you go to will give you a chart that tells you the diameter of any tire size.

And sometimes your deck may have limited capabilites to do the same....so you can check there....<br>  <br>  or if neither don't, then you may have to purchase an aftermarket Crossover to block the signals you don't want to go to the subwoofer.|`|F4ydk8R5aa	On the amp there will be a switch labeled    LPF FULL HPF.

He may have a discount in place that saves a few bucks a year if there aren't any drivers in his car with less then 10 years experience or something.

The statistics about teenage drivers aren’t good. According to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS), 16-year-olds get into accidents almost six times more often than drivers between the age of 30 and 59. No wonder car insurance premiums are so high for this age group. It has always been difficult if you are aged between of 16 - 25 to insure your car affordably, and although car insurance companies are beginning to recognize the need to supply this ever expanding market, it can still prove to be hard to find a reasonably priced car insurance premium.<br>  <br>  For instance, young drivers will often own older or less maintained vehicle compared to other drivers, which means they are more likely to break down and potentially cause an accident. Teenage drivers are also more likely to have accidents which can either injure themselves or the other party.<br>  <br>  However, parents should be aware if the fact that there are several ways that can help lower car insurance costs for your teen. In order for teen drivers and car insurance to work well together, parents need to know the factors that will help contribute to paying less for their son or daughter’s auto insurance in the future.<br>  <br>  The first thing that insurance providers look into when giving a car insurance quote is the driving record of the person. Teenagers that have a good driving record may merit consideration. What that means is that you can help keep your teen focused on safe driving by having him or her pay a portion of the auto insurance premium. Also, be sure to let your teen know the consequences of getting traffic tickets.<br>  <br>  Before you purchase your car it is also worth researching which insurance group it will fall in, so that you can ensure you will be able to get the cheapest possible insurance.<br>  <br>  Finally, by using Insurance4lessdirect.com you can rest assured that we will strive to find you the cheapest car insurance premium that will provide you and your teenager with the best cover.<br>  <br>  Did you know: If you’re adding your teen driver to your auto insurance policy, be sure to take advantage of the auto insurance discount for good students, available in many states.<br>  <br>  Go to: www.insurance4lessdirect.com

The one's in the rear are larger and produce more sound, but you're sitting in the front so you won't even notice the difference. Depending on if you get component speakers or seperate speakers and tweeters, I'd say to get the fronts first. After getting all the speakers, I'd purchase a two channel amplifier and connect the left side speakers and the right side speakers together so the sound is clearer and a lot louder.|`|1bac1f023cf59bb53f7122da6fe9d755aa	Front

FgRUdQOBaa	Amtrak was formed because the private freight railroads dropped their passenger service. <br>  Passenger trains do not make a profit, they actually cost money for the railroads to operate. <br>  The Federal Government realized there were a lot of people that wanted to travel but did not want to travel by highway so Amtrak was formed to operare passenger trains on freight lines. <br>  It is not a very good system because it is underfunded and in some cases mismanaged but it is better than no system at all and we can hope for an improvement in the future. <br>  There are lots of people that would ride if there were more routes and trains available. <br>  <br>  Good luck on your merit badge!|`|AA10164889	The automobile, trucking, and oil industries spent the whole 20th Century trying to put the railroads out of business.  Through powerful psychological marketing and lots of political influence, they managed to make providing rail passenger service a losing proposition for the privately owned railroads by the late 1960s and early 1970s.<br>  <br>  All rail passenger service was about to go away in the United States, but some astute legislators realized that the system that was profitable for the automobile, trucking, and oil businesses was also very inefficient, destructive to the environment, and harmful to the freedoms of the middle class and the poor.<br>  <br>  So on May 1, 1971, congress formed the National Railroad Passenger Corporation to operate passenger trains under the name Amtrak.  NRPC is a hybrid corporation that receives taxpayer support, just as the US Postal Service does.<br>  <br>  Now that the economy and the auto industry are in crisis, and oil prices indicate that private ownership of vehicles will decline over the years to come, it appears the determination of those who formed Amtrak will pay big dividends in the future.<br>  <br>  Lots of information on the history of Amtrak is available on the internet.  Just do an internet search on "amtrak history."

zlPAVkUBaa	If you do get liability only, which isn't a bad choice to keep the price down,please keep this in mind...<br>  <br>  Many people go with the lowest limits. That may be cheaper, but if you cause an accident, say with a very expensive car and someone goes to the hospital, your insurance better cover that type of event.<br>  <br>  To give you an example, Georgia's minimum liability is 25,50,25. The last amount is for property damage. Say you are responsible for totaling a new Lexus or Mercedes that costs $45K, your insurance will pay the $25K, and you have to pay the rest.<br>  <br>  I know insurance is pretty much a national scam and prices are ridiculous, just make sure you cover yourself.|`|kjAWsDwLaa	We can't answer that question here, and I wish people would stop asking.  You'll have to call several agents/companies, or use their web sites, to get accurate figures.<br>  <br>  Besides, you cleverly forgot to tell us your actual age, gender or location--not very helpful!|`|JkTGq2BJaa	You can call 10 different insurance companies and get 10 different quotes so i would recommend shopping around. If you pay cash for  her car than you can carry only liability, but if there is a loan you by law have to put full coverage. it doesn't matter what you driving record is, what they look at is her age, experience, and what she will be driving and for how many miles she will be driving.|`|9fHm7zb8aa	Liability insurance is indeed much cheaper. If you and your parents agree that you are a very safe and cautious driver, then it will be a good option in saving money.<br>  <br>  With liability insurance, the permiums tend to depend more on the driver and less on the car. This is because liability insurance only pays for the damage you cause to other vehicles, so the rates are calculated based on who you are and how much damage you can cause with your vehicle. Just remember - if you destroy your own car, you're probably going to be carless. :)<br>  <br>  To be sure, you should call up insurance companies and get quotes. It doesn't hurt to ask and only takes a few minutes. You'll get exact answers and be able to compare.<br>  <br>  As for the cars - they all seem to be good choices for a first car. I'd personally go with the 200 sunfire or 2000 cavalier. Older cars tend to have more miles and are more prone to breakdown.|`|VrPTLsecaa	Your friend is right. 3rd party liability is basic and required, but that's all. Even though American cars are junk, I wouldn't reccomend driving any of those without some form of coverage for yourself. Unless you're prepared to walk away with nothing in the event you crash your car, I would get collision AND comprehensive so you're covered if your car is stolen or broken into. <br>  <br>  Now keep in mind that if you get into an accident and it's the OTHER GUY'S fault, you will be covered for the repair whether you have collision or not. <br>  <br>  Anyways, food for thought...
M79W3Ct9aa	Audi's are pretty expensive to maintain.  Reliability problems of the past has mainly been because of electrical issues, much like the VW counterparts, and really wasn't taken care of until the new ones (2006 and up).  Very strong engines.  Nice cars to drive.  Very nice interior.  Pretty quick, though not the quickest cars available.<br> <br> I'm told the Audi dealers are worth a 4 or 5 on a 1 to 10 scale (10 being best).  What exactly does the warranty cover?  What dealer is this?  Used?  Audi?  <br> <br> In any case, I would only buy an Audi if the full service history was available.  These cars require "love and dedication" to stay running right and I consider it a big risk if you don't know the history on what's been taken care of on the car and what hasn't.|`|qQYz7srqaa	A good friend of mine drives a similar A4 from 1999 and has had no problems whatsoever.

If you dont have the base timing set properly the computer will keep trying to adjust it.  There is a mode the computer has to be to set the base timing.  Same goes for base idle speed.  I have had may of these trucks where someone did it wrong or thought they were just giving it a little tweak.

So...be careful there....|`|IC9gvmJ1aa	jammers work this way: the radar reads from your license plate or grille to get an accurate reading from where they are to your moving car. What a radar jammer does is block the front of the car from visual site of a radar detector. Many police cruisers have older models of radar detectors, because they still cost above $600 for cheap ones and up to $4000 for great ones. But there are many flaws with jammers. First of all, you need to install it into the car where it isn't visable, but still detectable by yourself so you know when a cop is near, and if it is working or not. Many cruisers as well have higher technology that can actually read your speedometer and prove you were speeding. Some actually can tell with a monitor that you have a jammer in your car, and if it's illegal, that fine is way up there. You can't find a decent working jammer for under a grand though, so good luck with it.

eIfQLsnvaa	Oil has a few properties and a few purposes. One purpose of oil is to protect the engine by providing a film in which the metal can move freely with little to no friction. One property is viscocity. Viscocity is the ability of a fliuid to flow. In oils, it is measured in its weight. The first number is how heavy it is in cold conditions, and the second is how heavy it is in hotter conditions. So when your car is cold or is in colder weather the oil acts as a 5 or 10 weight oil. When its hotter or in hotter climates or conditions it acts as as 30, 40, or 50 weight depending on what weight oil you put in the car. Typically 10w30 is used because its right in the middle. So, if you put a 10w30 in when it asks for 5w30 it shouldnt hurt it your car any.|`|Wi6FivSjaa	just check the chart in your owners manual. just use 5w30 in the winter and 10w 30 in the summer .|`|F5PUol8vaa	The 5W has to do with viscosity or flow rate at colder temperatures and the 30 is the viscosity at operating temperatures. 10W30 oils work fine down to below freezing. If your weather is colder than that, the 5W would be a better choice. Check your owner's manual for a guide to choosing the proper oil viscosity. <br>  Some vehicles make specific recommendations and those should be adhered to for best performance. An example is Ford products. If the owner's manual says 5W20, that is what should be used. <br>  My personal recommendation; use synthetic oil.|`|8AQw9xqBaa	Short run it should be fine.  Its a question of temperatures.  Your owners manual should have a chart that shows what oil to use depending on the temperatures you expect to be operating in.  The 5w is going to flow better at low temps.  If you are up north you should likely stick with the 5w in the winter.  If you are down south and got a high mileage engine the 10w may even be the better choice.|`|yzZchHHTaa	5W-30 is a little thinner at colder temps to help lube and protect motor.  Most older cars used 10W-30 until 5W30 came out on the market.

I would try to look for another source of financing, the dealer should be the last resort. They will probably charge you around 7-8% interest.

They will act all nice and helpful and try to get you to sign a contract under their terms.  The sooner the better for them. <br>  <br>  You need to do what you are doing now and get information from people that know the process and have nothing to sell and nothing to gain from helping you.

Alot of them will try to give you alot of bs and try to change the numbers on you enough that you get confused quickly and agree to any terms just to get it over with.<br>  <br>  As far as I remember auto loans are simple interest so the longer the term of the loan the smaller the payment.  That is what they try to get you with up front.  What they are hoping you don't realize is that you are paying interest alot longer than you should be and that is more money for them.  Also make sure you have the ability to pay the loan off early without additional charges or penalties.  Plan on reading the fine print that most assuredly will be there.<br>  <br>  I would put down more than less with the limit being not cutting yourself short.  The good thing right now is dealers are hurting for money cuz they can't sell cars so you will have more leverage.  Some people will laugh at this but I would go so far as to get a quote and make sure you can take it with you and look it over/have someone else look it over too.  They don't want you to leave the showroom without signing a contract and they will tell you anything sometimes to hurry you into doing it.<br>  <br>  If their one-word answer to you being able to look the contract over for a couple days is "no", my one-word answer would be "bye!".  Don't ever believe any salesman in any business that tries to tell you "we can't do that" or "that's not how it is done".  IF they want the business bad enough they Will do it.

qWmwI9PBaa	It is not your brake light switch.  If it was, your brake lights would be on all the time, even when the car is turned off, and parked.  You said that the brake lights come on when you turn on your lights.  You obviously have a short in the wiring.  <br>  <br>  If you want to try to fix this yourself, The first place to look is at the rear of the car.  Look for chaffed wires around the tail lights, moving the wires around while looking checking to see if the brake lights go out while moving them.  Work your way forward until you find the short and them repair the damage.  When you do this, make sure you use butt connectors and heat shrink tubing around the repair.  Before you crimp the connectors slide the heat shrink tubing on the wires first.  After the connectors are crimped down, slide the tubing over the connector and use a heat source (torch, lighter, heat gun, etc.) to shrink the tubing to create a seal to prevent corrosion.  Once you have this taken care of, place wire loom over the wires to prevent them from chaffing again.|`|T6y2zIO1aa	Try lifting up on the brake pedal with your foot while in park.

d9157449b4296a78a2d93140eae05e2baa	Well, the cheapest hybrid car available would probably be a used model, such as the discontinued Honda Insight (introduced in the US as the 2000 model year) or the older NHW11 sedan version of the Toyota Prius (2001-2003 model years). (BTW: Toyota had the first commercially available hybrid car, the Toyota Prius, introduced in Japan in 1997 for the 1998 model year, but Honda beat Toyota to the US market with the Insight in 1999 for the 2000 model year.) Used hybrids do not qualify for the US Federal income tax credit, though.<br>  <br>  The hybrid tax credit was signed into law with the Energy Policy Act of 2005.  The hybrid or alternative fueled vehicle has to have been purchased (or financed) new, and not used or previously owned. They cannot be leased (the leasing company is the owner so they get the credit, not you). Also, they have to be predominantly used in the US.<br>  <br>  How much of a US Federal Income tax credit you'll get will depend on what model of hybrid you purchased, and the date of the purchase.<br>  <br>  See:<br>  <a href="http://www.irs.gov/businesses/corporations/article/0,,id=203122,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.irs.gov/businesses/corporatio...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=157557,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,i...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=157632,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,i...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/tax_hybrid.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/tax_hybri...</a><br>  <br>  How much of a US Federal Income tax credit you'll get will depend on what model of hybrid you purchased, and the date of the purchase.<br>  <br>  If looking to purchase new now, hybrids with starting MSRP under about US$30,000:<br>  Toyota Prius:  $22,000  (tax credit expired)<br>  Honda Civic Hybrid:  $23,650 (tax credit expired)<br>  Nissan Altima Hybrid:  $26,650 ($2,350 tax credit -> $24,300)<br>  Chevrolet Malibu Hybrid:  $26,225 ($1,550 tax credit? -> $24,675)<br>  Saturn Aura Hybrid:  $26,910 ($1,550 tax credit? -> $25,360)<br>  Toyota Camry Hybrid: $26,150 (tax credit expired)<br>  Ford Escape Hybrid: $29,645 ($3,000 tax credit for 2WD -> $26,645)<br>  Mazda Tribute Hybrid: $29,845 ($3,000 tax credit for 2WD -> $26,845)<br>  Mercury Mariner Hybrid: $30,090 ($3,000 tax credit for 2WD -> $27,090)<br>  Saturn Vue Green Line (Hybrid): $28,850 ($1550 tax credit? -> $27,300)<br>  There are other hybrid vehicles, but I believe that their starting prices are higher...  (Of the above, I think all are currently built in the US except for the Toyota Prius and the Honda Civic Hybrid which are built in Japan. (Nissan Altima in TN, Toyota Camry Hybrid in KY...)<br>  <br>  You may have some more inexpensive new options when the 2010 models come out later this year (like the newly redesigned Honda Insight (tax credit expired), and the Ford Fusion/Mercury Milan Hybrid ($3400 tax credit)).<br>  <br>  <br>  The hybrid vehicle income tax credit has a sunset/phaseout provision, based on the date after the calendar quarter that a manufacturer sells 60,000 hybrids since the start of the credit (Jan. 1, 2006). There is a letter-writing campaign to remove the sunset/phaseout provision on the hybrid vehicle tax credit: <a href="https://secure3.convio.net/ucs/site/Advocacy?cmd=display&page=UserAction&id=600" rel="nofollow">https://secure3.convio.net/ucs/site/Advo...</a> )<br>  <br>  If you are an individual claiming the credit, you will need to fill out IRS Form 8910 Alternative Motor Vehicle Credit. (You will also have to do an AMT calculation as well, which means that you'll also have to file Form 6251 Alternative Minimum Tax -- Individuals, and that this AMT may reduce or even eliminate this credit on you!) This will then go on your Form 1040.<br>  <br>  If for a business, you will need IRS Form 3800, General Business Credit.<br>  <br>  You can only take the credit in the tax (calendar) year that you purchase the new hybrid. You cannot roll over any unused credit to another year.<br>  <br>  Just be aware that the hybrid models often have many features as standard that would normally only be found in a higher trim line of the regular model (for example, the Toyota Camry Hybrid matches well with the Toyota Camry XLE trim), so be sure to do an apples to apples comparison. For such a comparison, I suggest using the state of Colorado's alternative fuel vehicle tax credit information, where the state has already computed the incremental price difference of adding the hybrid drivetrain to various models (as the amount of available state income tax credit is based on this incremental difference), see Income 9 " Alternative Fuel Income Tax Credits" here:  <a href="http://www.colorado.gov/cs/Satellite/Revenue/REVX/1193047059436" rel="nofollow">http://www.colorado.gov/cs/Satellite/Rev...</a><br>  <br>  Your individual state may also offer state tax credits or deductions as well, so you should also check in with your individual state.<br>  <a href="http://www.eere.energy.gov/afdc/progs/tech_matrx.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.eere.energy.gov/afdc/progs/te...</a><br>  <a href="http://go.ucsusa.org/hybridcenter/incentives.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://go.ucsusa.org/hybridcenter/incent...</a>|`|TYGgRjqDaa	I believe the tax credits are for the lower sales hybrids, so if you were to buy a Prius you wouldn't get a credit.  I could be wrong since things are changing so fast.  Try going to irs.gov or just calling them.

Take a test light, ground the clamp end, and touch both sides of all the fuses.  If one lights up only on one side, it is blown.  When you replace it, make sure you replace it with the same amperage fuse.  If you do, and it blows again, you have a short in the wiring somewhere.  DO NOT try to fix it by using a larger fuse.  This could cause a fire, and could possibly be fatal.  <br>  <br>  If all the fuses are good disassemble the dash and look for broken wires.  Repair any damaged wires, and take preventive measures to keep it from breaking again.|`|dZmR9W6maa	did they all die at the same time? if so then yes its a fuse. if they all went out individually over a long period of time then the problem is the bulbs|`|W0ijrDcuaa	yeah more than likely its a fuse look for the one that says courtesy lights

That means, you have to file all the medical bills with YOUR policy first.  <br>  <br>  No one is going to be in a hurry to settle this, unless the other driver had "minimum coverage" - in which case, the MOST you will get from their insurance, is $25,000 - and the medical bills will get paid FIRST. <br>  <br>  Otherwise, you're going to have to prove how much of the injury was pre-existing, and how much was aggravated by the accident - a REALLY tough thing to do.<br>  <br>  I'm not one to rush ahead and hire a lawyer, but I think you're going to need a lawyer on this.

YnG0Tjxjaa	Check your oil level. It could also be the valves hitting the head of your engine. If it has a lot of miles, which I am assuming it has a good amount, it is a normal case for engine ticking. You could also try putting an octane booster in your gas tank the next time you refuel. Lower octane gas tends to cause detonation in worn engines. Increasing the octane may reduce the ticking and pinging you are hearing. If it doesn't go away after that, you may need to see an engine specialist.|`|zOIgzIy4aa	it,s probably valve lifters. if you hear it after you shut it down then that,s just the engine cooling down and that,s natural.|`|bLjGM9yNaa	Check your oil level and when the oil was last changed.<br>        If your still not sure. Speak to a mechanic.<br>  <br>        Good Luck|`|T6y2zIO1aa	If you notice the ticking after you shut the engine off it is the sound of the engine cooling down and is normal. If you hear ticking while you are driving the car it could be a pulley, worn serpentine belt or a worn hydraulic valve lifter among other things.|`|333a8b96e50ca7be29e4122a1437a3d4aa	Lifters, low on oil, exhaust manifold gasket, fan hitting something, and probably a dozen other things.|`|MnmNl6Hiaa	lots of things any thing from simple change your oil to a lifter stick to a rod knock or maybe a bad pullie
