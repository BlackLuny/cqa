Carol T says her thing off air and is sacked because unlike Ross she wouldn`t say sorry. So her offence is worse because she wouldn`t say sorry. I didn`t realise that Stalin`s thought Police were now in charge at the BBC.

20090205090030AAnuvcm	News & Events;Current Events	What do you think of the website Bailout Bill.com that gives out 50,000 dollars a day to those in need?	New York, Feb 5 (ANI): As the world continues to fight financial crisis, a new website has come forward to help recession-hit people by giving out 50,000 dollars a day to those in need.      Hundreds of people braved the chilly weather in New York and spent hours in line near Times Square hoping for a generous handout from Bailout Bill booth.      While the gesture was a publicity stunt for Bailoutbooth.com, a new video classifieds site, the recipients were happy to tell tales of their financial woes for cash, reports the New York Daily News.      All they had to do was speak up their heart-wrenching stories about layoffs, illnesses and general bad luck and Bill decided how much they deserved.      While most people got 50 dollars or 100 dollars, a lucky few got up to 3,000 dollars for a total of 50,000 dollars each day. (ANI)

20090205090527AADe8TQ	News & Events;Current Events	WHY!!!!! IS THERE A SHORTAGE OF GRIT?	I could understand a shortage if say the snow had come late in say May or early, say September. But, and perhaps I am being naive here. The sun passes into the Southern Hemisphere, autumn equinox in lateSeptember and remains there until the Spring Equinox in late March. Now not being az road engineer or anyhting like that, my simple brain works on the understanding that if days consist of more night than day then there is a chance that the surface of the earth during the short daylight might not gain enough heat to counteract the cold from the dark period. Therefore I would eb stockpiling up salt from say mid July onwards and keeping my reserves fully stocked until mid to late March. Do we have idiots running our councils?

Let′s suppose we introduce into a computer ,which is only a machine without any emotions and morals,the set of initial data and then ask the question.    Initial Data:    1.In Europe and USA there are immigrants from China, Russia, Africa, India ...    But more than 90% of all the terrorist attacks in Europe and USA are perpetrated by immigrants who belong to one ethnic group: ARABS.   And the religion this ethnic group confesses is ISLAM.   So, Arabs of Islamic faith ,who make up for less than 15% of the immigrants in Europe and USA, commit more than 90% of all the terrorist attacks.    2.In order to perpetrate such an attack, an Arab Muslim must first ENTER Europe or USA. A Question: what to do to stop the terrorist attacks perpetrated by Arabs of Islamic faith against Europeans and Americans in Europe and America and to stop the islamization of Europe?      How do you think,what will the answer of the computer be?

You always here about J3ws, Gypsies homsexuals, communists etc.. being kiled by the Nazis in WW2, but were any Islamic or coloured people murdered by the Nazis in WW2?      I know that the immigration rate of Muslims in Europe pre 1945 was nothing like the immigration as it is now, but Im sure quite a few Arabs lived in places like France, Netherlands and even their were even Muslims in Eastern European nations like Bosnia, Albania and Russia etc..      So did the Nazis kill, gas or murder any Muslims or Black Europeans in WW2, like they did to the J3ws?      I also know that some Muslims supported Hitler in WW2, but that doesnt make sense to me because i'm sure many Nazis also hated Muslims and Coloured people just like every other person who wasnt "Aryan"?
