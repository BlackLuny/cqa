20090227102450AAnEgtW	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	How to tell my parents about my older boyfriend?	I don't know how to tell my parents about my boyfriend. Weve been together for two and a half years now and I'm sick of hiding it from them. I'm 16 and hes 19. I spend every day with him and I'm tired of lying to them. I told my mom I was seeing a boy for about a week . And he was suppose to come to dinner with my mom and I but he chickened out. His parents know about me I'm at there house everyday and sleep over on Saturdays. The worst they can do is tell me I can't be with him and i don't want that to happen. How can I talk to them about this without them getting mad at me?

20090227111651AApUO5H	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	My 14 month old had her chicken pox vaccine three days ago...?	She had four different shots, two in each thigh. I only remember that one of them was the chicken pox vaccine...   Well since then she has had problems walking unless she is under Motrin. She has been on Motrin constantly since the shots, and I am no big fan of keeping a child drugged, or even drugging them in the first place, but it is the only way I can keep her from hurting.      So today, day three. She woke up a little grumpy...wasn't jabbering as much as usual, and was running a low grade fever (101.7) and now, it is 1:17 and she has pretty much gone lethargic and is asleep now, but her temperature has increased and it is scaring me because she is not her normal ever- happy self. Should I ride this out? Does anyone else have experience with vaccine reactions?

Please help...I am 10 weeks and 2 days pregnant and have had absolutely no spotting or anything this whole entire time. Last night I didn't sleep well and my whole side was hurting once when I woke up to go to the bathroom but it was better when I woke up in the morning.       I was a little worried so I used my doppler and found the baby's heartbeat - same as it has been all week long (171 bpm). But just now when I wiped there was a tiny spot of pink in the cm. I wiped again and there was nothing. What could this be?       I couldn't be losing the baby when I heard the heartbeat this morning could I? Should I try the doppler again and see if I can still find the heartbeat? I didn't want to overuse the doppler but I am worried...
20090309182352AAEj78Z	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Finding out the Sex of the Baby?	So, my husband and I have been discussing children. We plan on starting ttc around February 2010. We are and have always been in agreement about not finding out the sex of our first child until he or she is born. However, I know exactly what a baby's sex is by looking at the ultrasound (obviously something sticking out for a boy, and three little lines for a girl). My husband is like, well we can look at the ultrasound and we can't print the pictures.    I am like WHAT...we Absolutely are looking and taking them home with us. So, my question is, how can we look and take pictures home to show everyone without seeing what the sex is?

I'm afraid I was raped in my sleep, but i figured I would have woke up! What if they come again? What other possibilities are there? I'm scared? I'm only 15!

20090309183111AAq5kRK	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Anyone have implantation bleeding 1 day after missed period? If so when did you test positive?	Just curious..I missed my period today and have slight cramping the day before it, the day of it, and now today. I normally never cramp that long and NOT get it. Also, I think I might have ovulated later than expected causing miscalcuations leading me to have unprotexted sex with my husband thinking we were safe lol. We'd be happy either way but just now i noticed light blood when wiping, and not even anything major. Normally its extremely heavy at first then gets light around day 5 of my period. This is so unexpected.   So question is how many of you had implantation bleeding about 1 day after your missed period and if so when did you test positive??
20090309184053AAZGEN2	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Should I call my doctor and try to move up my appointment?	I went to the doctor today. My fluid level was at 6 which is very low according to my doctor and the tech doing my ultrasound. I am 37 weeks pregnant today. The doctor wants me to wait until thursday and have a non-stress test and then wait until Monday and have another ultrasound to check fluid levels before he will schedule my induction for next week. I'm worried because I was told by the doctor and tech that he can't move around because he has no fluid to move into and that low fluid will prevent his lungs from maturing further. should I have been firmer with them and said that I wanted the non-stress test immediately to make sure he is ok? His weight is estimated at 6lbs. 10 ounces right now so he is big enough but his lungs may not be mature.

I was so sick at work today that I thought I would throw up-and I have not thrown up since I was nine-I thought I couldn't anymore.

20090309191302AAgpayf	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	All these meds while pregnant?	Hello, I am 36 weeks pregnant and just came down with a horrible flu. I am already on some different meds and now the Dr. has put me on a bunch more. I am wondering if all these meds, especially mixed together, are ok to be taking? The pharmasist says yes, and the Dr. put me on it all but it just seems like So much. What do you think? I take:   Levothyroxin (for my thyriod)   Zofran (for extreme nausea)   Nifedapine (to stop my pre-term labor)   and now   Relenza ( a really weird diskhaler med)   Tylenol   Cefprozil (antibiotic for my ear infection)   and Acidophilus
20090309191313AAY0TEZ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Pregnancy possibility?? Please answer!?	I had my last period on Feb. 4th. My periods are anywhere from 28-42 days. Very irregular.      I've been having sex pretty consistently since my last period with my boyfriend, however we ALWAYS use a condom (I've never had sex without one) and he pulls out before ejaculation.      About 2 weeks ago, I went to the gyn to get my exam and to get on birth control I was ovulating I know, and they ran a pregnancy test and it was negative.      I'm due for my period this week I'm sure, and I have my tried and true symptom of tender/swollen breasts and very mild cramping.       What do you think the chances are of me being pregnant with using a condom and pulling out, and do you think I'm experiencing PMS symptoms or early pregnancy?      I have the pill in stock, so as SOON as I start my period I'm getting on the pill. I'll take a HPT if I don't get my period this week or next, I was just wanting your faithful opinions. Thank you.

Okay, so this is basically two questions about my 7 1/2 month old:   1) She is sleeping 10 1/2 hours at night and has 2 naps of about 1 - 1 1/2 hours each....is this enough sleep??   2) I breastfeed 4 times per day and feed her solids 3 times per day. I basically do the breastfeeding seperate from her meals, so she is eating 7 times per day or about every 2 hours. Is this too much? Should I be breastfeeding right before meals or vice versa, or is it better to space them out a bit? It seems like I am constantly feeding her!!

20090309205501AAn0gN0	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Need a few opinions of baby bowel movements?	Ok, my lil girl is about 14 weeks. She turned 3 months the first. I have noticed a change in her dirty diapers in the last few weeks. There are fewer wet ones and only one poopy one a day. I know this is normal, because she is getting older. However, my problem lies in the fact that she hasn't had a poopy diaper since Friday. I called her pediatrician this morning and she suggested using Karo syrup, which I reluctantly done. I worry about giving her anything to stimulate a bm because I don't want her system to become dependent on it. Ok, well after I gave her the syrup she started screaming like she was in pain. She is fine now, but when I called the pediatric hotline the lady there told me that she probably wasn't constipated. So, in your opinion could she have been constipated or not?

20090309204157AAcoRCd	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	I am so sick of having my son be compared to other babies!?	Does any one have any suggestions on how I can handle these situations?      I try not to compare my son to other babies his age, because I know that every baby develops at a different rate. Yet my MIL always compares him to his girl cousin who is 3 months older than him and another girl cousin who is a month younger than him. The other day, my MIL asked us if he knew how to talk. I said no. She then went on to say that her niece's daughter already knows how to say Thank you and that we should teach our son how to talk since he is almost 1. He's 11 months right now. My husband pointed out to her that the other baby was older by 3 months, and for babies, those 3 months make a big difference. Still she wouldn't listen. She kept saying we should teach our son to talk and not babble. She said that my husband already knew how to talk when he was 1. This is not the first time she has compared my son to one of his cousins and insisted that we teach him what they know.       I listen to her, because I know she means well, but I feel like she's making it out to be a competition between the babies in the family by always comparing my son to others and insisting that he be like them as soon as possible. I just don't know how to handle this anymore. She's had 8 kids, she does understand that all babies develop at different rates, yet I feel like she is expecting too much out of my son. Now that I think about it, could it be because my son is her first true grandson? She has other grandsons too but their dad is her step-son only.
20090309202910AAHyN8m	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Ladies! please lots of answers! I need your thoughts! Could this be pregnancy?	So, im really confused. When i ovulated in january(around the 12th) i had unprotected sex 3 or 4 times. i got what i thought was my period on the 31st, normal flow, although it lasted for 2 days instead of 6! So soon after that ended my breasts have been feeling like they're on fire. now it is march 9th, 38 days since my last "period", and my breasts are still burning. So im late this month, but the last time i had unprotected sex was january! so could i be pregnant? but if i am, why didn't i miss my period last month? has anyone had this experience? thank you for all your advice:)
20090309203146AAYFvdI	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Is this normal movement?	I have kind of already asked this question, but every time it happens, it still bothers me.  I am 25 weeks pregnant.  Some days my baby will seem to move a lot.  Then it seems that she will entirely stop for an entire day.  Like yesterday, I might have felt a twitch once or twice, and at one time I think she pushed up against my bladder, but nothing else all day.  It didn't seem to matter what I did, she wouldn't move.  Today she has done a little moving.  But I can't help but wonder if she is ok in there.  My doc told me not to even pay attention to her movements until the 28 week.  Did anyone else experience this?  It seems to happen about the same every week.

So at 7 1/2 months, if a baby can tell you're smiling from across the room, is that a good indication that their eyesight will be good? Or does it mean very little?       Can it get worse as they get older?       And if they inherit bad eyesight, will it necessarily be as bad as the parents? For example- my eyesight before corrective lenses is in the 3000's/20 (yes, i literally cannot see the computer screen in front of me without leaning in only a few inches from it) will baby's eyesight be THAT bad, or could it be less severe?

20090309202545AABspIg	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	I feel horrible about this....?	When my daughter was 3 mos she stopped wanting to sleep in her crib.  Being that I breastfeed her(and I was against CIO!) my husband and I had no problems bringing her into bed with us.  She is 9 months now and we are pretty used to her waking up 2-3 times a night to feed and go back to bed.  However, the last 3 nights after she has fed, she would stay up and "play" for 1 to 2 hrs after.  This has not only affected my husbands sleep (he works 2 jobs to support us), but I fear it is unhealthy for her patterns are all off and she is cranky and irritable.  I tried CIO with her in her crib last night and she went to sleep after crying for 15-20 mins.  I did go in every 5 min to comfort her.  But the next morning she seemed sad and mad at me, and I feel soo guilty.  But I let her CIO again tonight and same thing, she fell asleep after 20 mins of crying.  I feel like if I don't break this habit of hers she will not get enought sleep and it will affect her health.  She barely takes afternoon naps as it is.   My brain tells me that she has to learn to comfort herself at night and go back to sleep for her own good.  But my heart  is breaking, doing this to her.  I just want to know if anyone else went thru this and what did you do in this situation?  I'm so sad right now.

I've just been to health food store this time for raspberry leaf tablets.  I've heard they only help with recovery is this much true??....  I drank raspberry leaf tea last time and my son was still 10 days overdue.  I DO NOT want to be induced again I have taken previous advice for bringing labour on and nothing seems to be working.  I am beginning to think that I just carry my babies a little longer than the average josephine.  Ultimately I would like to avoid having to be induced my little bub got stuck last time as he was soooo big and he wasnt even breathing when they finally got him out several unsuccessful attempts.  Have spoken with a g/friend who is a midwife and she said that there isnt really anything you can do to get a baby out.  I was bed bound at 28 weeks last time as I have a short cervix and had I kept up my normal routine I would of had a pre term baby go figure stil able to carry a baby for 41 weeks....  Any suggestions ideas or even experiences would help ease my concern.. Thanks

We just had our second child 3 months ago and because of our issues, we're on a waiting list to start counselling. I don't know if we'll even make it that far.      We're currently sleeping separately. Part of me wants to leave him, but I don't want to make that decision and it turn out to be the biggest mistake of my life. Any time I try to talk to him, he brushes me off.       I honestly think I'm suffering post-partum depression, and I don't feel like I can turn to him for help. I'm afraid to even say anythig to hom, for fear that he'll brush me off. But at the same time, I want help, and feel like he's where I can start.      I'm in tears over this the last few days, crying as I type this.      How can I approach him and ask him for help?

When I found out I was pregnant I called an adoption agency because I figured I should give my daughter up for adoption because that's what my friends and family said. I got paired up with an older couple and I have gotten to know them. They are really excited about my baby and talk about how her all the time. The thing is I am having second thought about giving my daughter to them, my parents said they support which ever choice I make. I tried talking to the couple about my feelings and they got very angry and keep saying "why are you doing this to us???" I didn't know what to say so I said "fine you can have her" they were just so pushy. Now they are being nice again and keep referring to my daughter as their daughter. They say it would be selfish if i were to keep her. I want to keep her, but they kept guilting me! What can I do?   Thanks   ~LuAnne

I've been very nauseous, tired, hungry, my sense of smell is a little heightened, my breasts are a lil sore, so I figured maybe I'm pregnant again?? But I have taken 4 tests within the last week and 1/2 and they all showed up not pregnant. Which either way wouldn't bother me, but I just want an answer. With the whole nauseous thing, as soon as I get into a car I get car sick instantly, and if I move around a lot I feel sick. I just want to know if it is possible for the hormone not to even show up at all, when you take a home pregnancy test, and another thing, my periods have been very light, for like the past 4 months or something....... If anyone has any thoughts I would greatly appreciate any possible explanation!!!!!

I have 2 sisters and at the beginning of this school year the eldest went to college out of state. I don't see her often anymore we unused to always be together and I miss her a lot, everyday I wish she was here. Recently I've been trying to stop being dependent on my other sister. She will be gone the year after next, and I'm scared of her leaving me and feeling the same pain again. Maybe even worse for she protects me from everything bad, I depend on her more than anybody in the world. I would die, or kill for her without regret together my sisters make up my whole world. All day today I was thinking of them both. I was so out of it, but of course nobody really noticed because I don't have friends at my school really. I freaked out today more than ever. I don't know why I don't know what happened, but I just needed my eldest sister to protect me and my other big sister to comfort me like when I was little. I couldn't think I was just freaking out and being driven insane by them not being there.  I even cried in the bathroom stall wanting them to be there and to give them a billion hugs. Just to have them there. I know it sounds strange, but is this bad? I also cried a bit thinking of them and writing poems about them as I was supposed to be watching a video in health. Am I going to be alright? Is this going to keep happening? I can't live with this pain everyday!!!

He said it looks like the baby had died and he prescribed me some pills that he said "will flush my system, press reset on my body, and ill start my period and I could try again next month"   But I have had no cramping, no spotting, no bleeding! NOTHING!   I have a blood test scheduled for in the morning, even if its neg i hear that some people didnt get BFP until there period was 3 weeks late or later!!

Anything bit of information will be greatly appreciated! Thank you so much! :)
20090309214912AAlhKnJ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	I think my baby is overweight?	My 6 month old daughter is about 22 pounds. She skipped past clothes sized 6-9 months and is wearing 9-12 and 12 month clothes. She is only eating formula (6 oz every 5 hours), rice cereal and she is just starting stage 1 foods. Is this normal (the weight and size skipping)?
20090309211524AAg5Hv8	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	My baby lost weight.....?	I took my baby in for his 6 months appt.  Everything was fine except he didn't grow as much as expected.  He went from the 80% in wt at 2 months to 60% at 4 months to 24% at 6 months.  He only gained 13 oz between his 4 and 6 month check up.  I have started offering him a bottle when he is done nursing and discovered I wasn't producing enough for him.  I started taking him to the breastfeeding clinic at the hospital every week to have him weighed.  The first week he was 16lb 13oz.  exactly a week later on the same scale he was 16lbs 10.5 oz.  The nurse said that babies his age should be gaining .5-1 oz a day still.  I am taking him back in on Thursday to weigh him again.  Any thoughts moms?  Thanks
20090309211510AAuHyTK	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Does your baby prefer one gender over the other?	My son seems to get stranger anxiety around guys only. When we visited my in-law's, his Uncles tried to play with him but he ran away from them and tried to hide from them. Then one of his girl cousin comes over and he starts following her around. He rarely ever sees any of them. The other day my sister visited me and she brought along three of her girl friends. He went up to them and started doing his happy feet dance. I find it so cute, yet odd, that he seems to prefer females over males. My brother-in-law said that it's probably because I have so many sisters and they all spoil him. Not only that but he spends most of his time with me.       Still, I wonder, can 11 month old babies tell that there are different genders? I mean, they don't even know that gender exists. So how is it that he is scared of male "strangers" but not female "strangers"? Do they compare appearances to their parents and go from there? I know it can't be the long hair because half of my brother-in-law's have long hair. One has hair longer than mine! And he is scared of all of them.
20090309231932AApYEDa	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	What should you do if your child is being a bully?	my husband and i went to do some shopping. i have two daughters. their names are libby and tanya. libby is twelve and tanya is ten. since we are out, libby is in charge. our daughters are pretty close and tanya is usually an obedient little sister. on that day, tanya was outside playing with a little boy named bobby, who is six. they got into a fight. tanya pressed bobby`s head down the toilet. that is not normal behaviour for my younger daughter. bobby has an older sister called rachael, who is the same age as libby. as soon as that incident happened, rachael told libby about it because they are good friends. then libby helped rachael press tanya`s head down the toilet. that is not normal behaviour for libby either. she is usually so protective of her little sister. what should we do about it?

I met my husband 2 yrs ago and now they live with me. His son is always lying and telling people that my husband kidnapped him from his mother. He hates living with us and wants to go back with his mother. He hates me and always treats me like crap. He is now telling people that I treat him like a slave (because he has to do chores) and tells people that his dad is a drunk just because his dad likes to have a couple of beers after work. He is saying these things because he wants to go back with his mom. I have this kid going to see a shrink , and the shrink thinks he is crazy and wants to put him on pills but my husband doesn't want to. My husband has him so spoiled , even after all the mean things he has said. My husband never tells him anything, and lets him get away with everything. I tied to be friends with this kid but he hates me. What can I do to make this kid stop saying all those lies? how can I get my husband to see the truth? I have told my husband that I want a divorce because I can't take it anymore.

20090309210921AArVW6b	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Does anyone know about bulging softspot (fontanel) on an infant?	We have a 5 month old and he has had a bulging soft-spot(fontanel) for a week as of March 8, 2009. We took him to the er when we first noticed it and they did a full blood work up, a urine test, a cat scan, and a chest Xray. That all came back fine so they said that they would do a lumbar puncture(spinal tap) to rule out meningitis. That to came back fine, and they said to watch him. That it was a viral infection. We also called the Dr. a few days later because it was still bulging and he to said to keep watching him because he was a happy baby. Well here it is a week and a day later and its still bulged and sometimes still has a low fever. The bulge rises and falls and so does the fever. Personally we don't think its normal. After 3 other kids we have never seen a viral infection show this way. Any advice is helpful!!!!

20090227114040AAktNF0	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Question for working moms?	Do you think that you let your children get away with a little more than you should because you are at work all day?  When my 17 month old is clingy and pouty when I come home I will stop what I am doing to spend a little more time with her one on one, same with my 12 year old.  Instead of pushing an issue I tend to slack off some because I am exhausted already so I see no need for another battle.  Do you stick to your guns or do you tend to slack off some too?  A good example would be last night I got home around 6 ish, and my 12 year old was on her horse and I know that I needed to start dinner and laundry but she wanted me to sit out there with her and watch, so of course I did, and then when I made it inside the 17 month old was so in the missed mommie phase that I layed with her on the couch for about another hour, (lol still no dinner), so I finally started diner around 8 which yes I know put the schedule way off for bedtimes etc, but I feel that the time was better spent.  My hubby on the other hand thinks the kids will become used to manipulating mom.

So I have a 30 year old sister who I haven't seen since 2006 but she has contacted me throught text or phone. Well, she contacted me about 2 weeks ago because my mom gave her my phone number and also told her I was pregnant(I know I was dumb for not telling my mom to not tell her). Any who my sister called me and wanted to come and stay for 3 days before the baby is born or after or whatever. Which is fine I guess,the only problem is she would be staying with us(she has a ride down here and back. Doesn't have her own car and a bit ago she got a DWI PLUS she ran from the cops and got put in jail). My guy and I live in a 1 bedroom apartment. It is 860 sq feet and it is pretty tiny for having people stay over. Well she wants to come over and stay. I guess thats fine but I told her that when I am at the hospital she is not allowed to stay here when I am not here. No, I really don't trust her,she's my sister yes but I haven't seen her in 3 years and she expects me to allow her to stay at my place when I am not around. I told her if I am not there she is not allowed there. And I told her after I have the baby I don't want alot of people over and I basically just want it to be me, my baby and my fiance. I mean I don't want people around when right when I go home. It's nice to have time with just the baby and the parents isn't it? She didn't like what I told her and basically said "FINE I WON'T EVEN COME THEN!"               How do I handle this situation? And my mom also wants to come and stay 2 weeks after I give birth. I understand but I just want to be alone with my baby at that time. How do I tell her I really appreciate the thought of her coming and staying with me 2 weeks but I really rather not have her there? I would thought after 1 month or 2 go up to visit her with the baby.

20090310013113AAFibJz	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Why do people cut themselves?	Would this be an accurate reason?      Because sometimes people are so overwhelmed with an emotional pain that it feels like they will never heal, so they cut themselves to have a physical pain, which eases the emotional pain. Because they can watch their mental scars heal in a physical sense.       I used to cut. And yeah it was dumb, but sometimes I feel the need to do it again. Anyway, I have to give a speech on this topic to my class, and this is my premise.

20090227120030AA1c3oi	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Baby sleeping too much? Should we be waking her up after a while?	My daughter is 8 months old, and I am concern that she is sleeping too much. I do not know if she is teething or not, but it does seem like she is more clingy then she usually is. When I put her down she cries (with tears) and I sit and talk with her, and when I do, she will stop crying, and play.    Anyways, one day (single mother working full time) I brought her to the sitters like usually. That night she went to bed around 8-9ish. I had to wake her up at 6:30 so I can go to work, she slept on the ride there, about 20minutes. When we got at the sitters, I guess she went to bed around 8am and woke up at 1pm! Then she slept on the car ride home (5ish pm) and went to bed that night around 9. That is a lot, she has never slept that long since she was a new born. Has anyone experienced this, and could it be something wrong? (again the babysitter noticed that she has been sleeping a lot lately)      Also, would you let your baby sleep 5 hours during the day like that, or would you wake them up?          Oh and that morning before the sitters I feed her a bottle around 7, then when she woke up at 1 the sitter gave her a container of baby food and 4ozs of formula. So she was hungry when she woke up.         And (sorry I know a lot) if I should have the baby sitter wake my daughter up after a certain amount of hours of nap time, how can I ask her without being rude?      (my daughter also doesn't have any teeth yet)         THANKS!!!

20090227120307AAqnyvI	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Mothers of multiples and preemies, who was your main support?	I had quintuplets 3 weeks ago, here are their names and birth weights:   Abigail Rae: 2lbs 8oz.   Natasha Sophia: 2lbs 1oz.   Mary Frances: 1lb 13oz.   Christopher Mason: 3lbs 4oz.   Samuel Nicholas: 2lbs 9oz.      Last week Abigail had a surgery on her left eye and Christopher had spinal fluid drainage surgery. Mary had pneumonia and almost passed when she was a week old. Sammy and Natasha also came down with RSV. It's crazy I feel like I am all alone. I have family and my husband but I feel like I am the only one who feels this way, like it's my fault they are suffering like this. Probably because I was pregnant with them and I gave birth to them prematurely. I feel so helpless, my babies are so helpless. I just have a had a horrible day too. I just got back from the hospital to take a nap but I can't. I had to drive 45min to the hospital at 3:30 this morning after I got a call that Mary was not doing well. I can't sleep with all this on my chest and although my husband is  at the hospital with them I felt so bad leaving like I was abandoning them. I just really needed to get this off my chest. Thanks for reading and please share your stories!
20090227120427AAii5YW	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Stay at home mums (or working mums for that matter), what's your worst domestic 'faux pas'?	For me, mistake number one was leaving the cd writer pen (permanent) within reach of the toddler. Of course, she drew all over her wall, chest of drawers and carpet. Thankfully, we were about to re-paint the walls, and I managed to get it off the drawers with nail polish remover - but the carpet took hours and hours of scrubbing. When I FINALLY removed it all (with very sore aching arms), I decided to dry the carpet with my hairdryer and burnt the damn thing. Needed a new carpet.   So what's your disaster story?

She's refusing to nurse unless it's at night time, or when she's really tired right before a nap. I don't know if it's a distraction thing or teething but either way she won't nurse. She'll suck for about 5 seconds and pull off. At night, and right before her nap she'll get a full feeding in, thats the only time she'll nurse. I stopped solids recently due to constipation issues so I've just been nursing her. I'm scared that she's going to lose weight. Anyone have any advice about this issue? I don't get much milk out when I pump so I can't give her a bottle cause I don't get a lot of milk out.

20090309235927AAsaFyb	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Potty training question?	My daughter is 28 months old.  I have been trying to potty train her for a few months now.  She goes on the potty maybe 2 or 3 times a week at daycare but has not gone on the potty at home even once yet.  She will sit there for a few minutes and stare at me.  Then jump down, flush the toilet, close the lid and run to the sink wanting to wash her hands.      To her it seems that the reward is getting to wash her hands.  I've tried to tell her she will get another reward like cookies if she goes pee pee or poo poo in the potty, but all she cares about is getting to wash her hands.  I don't feel it is right (for sanitary reasons) to tell her she can't wash her hands unless she goes on the potty, since she has been touching things near and on the potty.        I know she is ready to use the potty because she just yesterday I walked into her room to wake her up from her nap and she had taken her pants and pull up off and gotten her wipes and was wiping the poopy off of her tooshy herself.  I don't know why she won't go on the potty though.      I am at a loss for what kind of incentive to give her to get her to do more than just sit on the potty.  Does anyone have any ideas as to why she is willing to try at daycare but not at home?

20090227121836AAQsLEw	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Stay at Home Mommy's...please help!!!?	How much does your husband help you on the weekends and after work?      I primarily take care of the baby and house and I do most of the cooking.  Even though to some this may be quite old fashioned since I am home and don't work I really don't mind.  My husband has a very physical job and works ten hours a day.  He usually helps clean up after dinner and makes bottles or packs the diaper bag when I ask.  However, sometimes when I ask him for help he tells me he was just about to do something else or gives me an attitude.      Can you tell me a little bit about what it's like at your house?      This is a genuine question, please keep your negative comments to yourself.  Thanks for your answer!

20090310002638AAHlS5q	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	In what cases do you think abortions are ok to have?	My sister is 29 and pregnant and wants to get an abortion because her boyfriend doesn't want it, and it isn't convenient for her with her full time career. I told her I might like to adopt her baby and she said she doesn't want to put herself through 9 months of pregnancy....I actually had my only baby when I was 14, my daughter is a teenager herself now and we're very close, she's very sweet and beautiful and I've always been devoted to her, even though it was challanging to have her at such a young age.

20090310010043AAXve52	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	My mother does not act nice to my daughter, what can I do?	I had my baby when I was 14, she is 15 now. She's my only child and she's my whole world, she's beautiful and very sweet and we're incredibly close. But my mother will always blame any troubles I have onto my baby, she always says that I should have not gone through with the pregnancy. Recently she's told me in front of my daughter that I would have more money now and a good husband if I hadn't had my baby. (I'm still single and I have enough money for myself and my child but I'm not rich, and I'm fine like this). She wanted me to be a surgeon or a lawyer which I haven't done, and she blames it on my baby. She also recently hit my daughter when I wasn't looking because she accidentally dropped one of her figurines she collects. What should I do? I live near her and she visits me and I have to see her at family gatherings but she always brings something up around my daughter which hurts her feelings. I've told her to stop but it doesn't seem to work. What approach should I take and how can I make my child not feel sad about any of this?
20090309234618AAkO6nl	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Ovulation and pregnancy question?	Hello there and thank you ahead of time. Here it goes. Normally I have 30-32 cycle, averaging 30days and I assume I ovulate on day 15. So up until two months ago, I would have my period around the 23rd of each month with the exception of maybe 22 of each month.      January had it on the 25th. February the 21st. Well this month I had unprotected three times with my boyfriend of six years on the 4 and 5th of this month, March. Im supected to ovulate on the 7th or 8th based on my last months early cycle on the 21st. Now Im pretty sure I ovulated on starting on the 7th of March until the 8th. I had moderate period like cramps in my right side, than my lower stomach and back, as well as my thighs. I swore I was going to have a period. So I assume they were ovulation pains. Well my question is could I get pregnant? Again I had sex the 4 and 5th of March. Oh and I should mention that once a few months ago I did kind of discover I normally ovulate on the 8th or 9th due to me seeing stretchy egg white discharge as well as being real horny(sorry if too much information:)), but that was when I always had my period on the 23rd with a average 15 day luteal phase.      Again thank you!

20090310013755AAa8jSO	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	If I'm a twin and my husband had twin brothers - what is the chance of US having twins?	I'm a twin. My parents thought we were identical but as we grew up we changed ALOT in looks. I follow more my Mum, my sister my Dad's family. Different weight, slightly in height etc etc. Same blood type though. So not sure if identical but could possibly be fraternal twins.      My mother-in-law had twins that passed away before full term pregnancy was established. Not sure if fraternal or identical either so not sure if I am helping much!      Can anybody give me an idea of what our odds would be of carrying twins? I'm currently 5 weeks pregnant.      Sorry if not enough information given.

Well technically later today (3:53am right now) I REALLY have to pee. I want to use FMU. Should I pee now? Or should I hold it until I wake up? And, If I pee now will my chances of having diluted urine be higher or the same? I did drink A mtn dew a few hours ago and have went to the bathroom since then.      My lmp was 2/1. Should have started no later than 3/3.
20090310021814AA6ApHE	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	What are the right reasons to have a baby?	Recently, my husband and I have been discussing adding another baby to the family. We already have 2 daughters who are 8 and 9 years old.   I don't know if I really want to have another baby or I just think I want another one! How do I know what the right decision is?      Here are the reasons why having another baby would be good:   1. My children would enjoy a new brother/sister.   2. My husband and I are not getting any younger. The clock is ticking.   3. I'd like to try for a little boy. Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't mind if it was a girl either.   4. We are financially stable and capable of adding another family member.   5. I miss holding a baby in my arms.   Here are the reasons why I wouldn't want to have another baby:   1. My 2 daughters are now at the age where they don't need Mama every minute and I'm enjoying having a bit of my own life back.   2. I don't miss changing dirty diapers, temper tantrums, and making sure no one is getting into things that they shouldn't be.   3. I'm scared to be pregnant again and go through labor, etc. It is really stressful.   4. I'm worried about the huge age gap that there would be between my daughters and another baby. The new baby wouldn't have a sibling to play with.   5. I enjoy just having "my 2 girls" and I don't know if I am ready for a change.       How do I know which list is the right one? How did you know that adding a baby to the family was a good decision?   Thanks!
