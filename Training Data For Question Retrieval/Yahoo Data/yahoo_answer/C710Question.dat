20090128183351AAL5m78	Family & Relationships;Weddings	WEDDING PLANNER! HELP! ?	My fiance and I are planning our wedding in March 2010. I obviously have a ton of planning to do. I have an amazing Mother who if she could would do the entire wedding herself. She is down to earth, young at heart, and very talented in decorating. Although, this is MY wedding and I need some HELP! I was wondering if anyone knew about any GOOD wedding websites. I am REALLY looking to find bridesmaid dresses, tuxes for the groomsmen, as well as shoes, jewelry, etc. for them! I don't really need a website for a wedding dress but I would love one offering any other help! Thanks so much! =]
20090128183533AAUQ8mD	Family & Relationships;Family	My mom got a loan for me and is holding it over my head now?	Well she hasn't gotten it yet. Its a oan of about 1000 that I need just until I get some money in and then Im paying it right off, and its for a car I am buying from my brother in law. She got it because I am now an unemployed college student so she volunteered to get it for me so that I would be able to buy the car.       Well now every step I make that she doesn't like she uses the loan and the car as something to hold over my head. Telling me if I don't do this she won't do it. She is also getting the car in her name (her idea) until i pay it off then everything switches over to my name. This was all her idea I was going to find another car and never even considered buying this car. Now she is even threatening to take the plates off it before it is even bought or registered with plates on it...      This whole thing is making her a little nutty.how do i get around this and make her realize what a nutcase she is being without offending her or making her even more nutty?

20090128183828AA1De1H	Family & Relationships;Friends	FRIEND SAID SHE DIDNT LIKE ME!!!!!!!! IM HURT I FEEL BETRAYED SHE ACTED LIKE WE WERE FRIENDS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!?	I was with my friend kenia in the library, I saw a guy there that i had seen when i was doing my laundry at the laundrymat and i told her about it she said he was an asshole, i started talking **** about him (i dislike guys that are assholes!!! and then basically i asked her if he thought he was cute and i forgot what she said ANYWAY we were just talking about that guy and then i was hyper i couldnt start laughing, there was this teacher there who's name was deleria and i told her that it sounded like diarreah when this teacher said it out loud,we both laughed,but then i couldnt stop laughing and she said see this is why i dont like you. I was like what? and i was like seriously you dont like me? and she said no and i said you dont like me as a friend and she said duh! no i dont like you as a friend! I was shocked cuz i considered her being a good friend of mine and i was there for her when she needed a ******* friend! and i never have insulted her or betrayed her at all and then after that i just kept quiet and my feelings were hurt :( i dont understand why she would say that she never showed signs that she didnt like me:( i told my friend about this and she thinks someone told her something about me and maybe thats why she said she doesnt like me, when we were leaving i asked to borrow her phone and she said NO! then she like just gave it to me and just said that i needed to go outside for signal and then after that we just said bye... i dont understand did she really mean it or did she just say it out of anger? I think she probably got annoyed because i couldnt stop laughing and i was making fun of that guy and the teacher ????

20090128183814AAzOroU	Family & Relationships;Weddings	How should I care for my emerald engagement ring?	My now fiance just proposed with this beautiful emerald engagement ring    http://zales.imageg.net/graphics/product...    It has hearts in the setting on both sides below the emeralds and 2 surrounding diamonds, and the words Past Present Future are engraved on the inside with little diamonds set inbetween them. the ring is absolutely gorgeous, emeralds are my favorite stone and I am very sentimental so this was the perfect ring for me. I just have no clue how to take care of it. I heard that emeralds can chip, so how can I prevent this? Can I expect it to last a lifetime if I care for it properly? Any help on care and tips (professional or everyday use) would be greatly appreciated, I don't have much jewelry because of a nickel allergy and I want to make this last.

20090128183841AASMGi9	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Woman I am interested in dating other men. Best approach?	We had our first date last week. It was great. We even had sex! We are meeting again this Sunday. However, she is also dating other men. She likes me a lot and wants to just see how things are as we slowly move forward. I dont want to be controling or jealous. I understand where she is coming from, but it is kinda hard to think right now some other dude may be balls deep in her. Most people might think then she doesnt care for me so why waste my time. She is well worth my time (smart, rich, good looking, ect, ect, ect... basically my dream girl). So, I am thinking if she calls tonight (she said she would be out late and she might call) I should just was your dinner nice? then leave it at that. If she doesnt call, just not bring it up at all tomorrow? what is the best approach? thanks!
20090128183837AAVHesY	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why not take all laws related to marriage and call in something else, leave marriage to the churchs?	P.S. Why do some many liberals dislike this idea, while their counterpart seems to think I am a liberal?   To all of you that are confused, I support liberty and freedom and you can take your ideas of legislating morality and attempting to control and manipulate society through bigger government and put it where the sun don't shine. We don't need more government we need less.      "As government expands, liberty contracts." RR

20090128184143AA5IJgh	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What do I do if he doesn't feel the same way?	My boyfriend and I have been together in a committed serious relationship for a year and a half. We are currently on a break because we are in a rut and are taking some time to think about things. I have been doing a lot of reflecting and have realized that I would really like to give it a second chance. I would like our relationship to mature into the next level and prove that it really was just a "rough patch" we were going through.    After a week long break we are meeting at a restaurant to talk. What if I tell him all about how I want to give it a shot, I want us to communicate more and that I want our relationship to mature and grow to the next level... and he says he feels the opposite and doesn't think anything will change and that a break up is the only answer?? I don't know how to convey my point any more or make it more clear without it seeming like I am begging. What should I do?

20090128184613AAmFgMq	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I give her another chance?	I don't expect anyone who hasn't gone through something similar to fully understand everything, but here goes.  I started dating my ex about a year and a half ago.  It wasn't one of those relationships that built up over time, but was fast and hard if you know what I mean.  Five months in we hit a bit of a rough patch which I have to take half the blame for.  I was crazy in love with her.  I got suspicious of her and one of her guy friends and I think my paranoia was rubbing her the wrong way.  Of course, after a month of that I found out she was cheating on me with that guy, so I guess I had some basis to be paranoid.  We hardly talked for 8 months after that.  That's a little background on everything and although it killed me at the time, it's kinda dulled now.      The thing is, now that I've stopped being angry and paranoid around her and have my life back on track (yeah she meant that much to me), she's been trying to get back in contact.  Emails and phone calls and such - she doesn't have my new cell number.  Sometimes we talk on messenger.  Last week she told me "I miss you so f***ing much" on messenger.  She's a shy girl and doesn't usually say something like that.  She says she wants to talk more and hang out.      Btw, she has a boyfriend now and it's not the guy she cheated on me with.        I'm kinda reluctant to spend more time with her.  I don't hate her, actually she's my favourite gal in the whole world.  I've been living without her for a year pretty much.  I still like who she is, I even dropped off an bday gift for her two weeks ago.  It was nothing big of course.  She always tried to make me feel guilty about the nights I didn't sleep over at her place, about how cold and lonely she was and how she was going to find another man.  Well, it was funny at the time.  So I gave her a teddy bear as a gift with a note saying "for the nights I can't be there".      I think maybe that's what prompted her to really want to get back together.  My mind's saying I want to have her back - as a friend - and that I've been without my best friend for too long.  For lack of a better way to describe it:  my "heart" won't let it happen.  I avoid her.  I only email her to respond to her emails.  I only message her when she sends me one first.  Cuz I know the pain of being ignored when I know she's there and she doesn't want to talk to me.  So I let her lead.      Lol, I've never wanted something so much and at the same time do everything not to get it.  So, how do I giver her another chance?

20090406135106AAUirJj	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why was he holding back when kissing me?	No I don't have bad breathe and I am actually pretty experienced at it. I went out with a guy a few times and noticed he was very stiff and kind of holding back when kissing me. He also was kissing me too gently. We  both had a great time. But what is up with that?
20090128150427AASKHj9	Family & Relationships;Friends	How wrong do YOU think this is?	This girl I know, we're not exactly friends, more acquaintance's. Now shes liked this boy for a very, very, VERY long time. Now this boy confuses her a LOT. He's always sending her mixed messages. Here's where I come into it: all of a sudden, he started talking to ME...in fact, we talk a lot. I noticed that the girl started talking to me too...she never ever called me prior to this, she called me up the other day and asked me if i talked to the guy. i knew what she was doing...but honestly i don't like him that way. however, i think he does. he told me that he doesn't like the other girl...and instead he flirts wit me. what should i do??      should i continue talking to me? would that be wrong of me??

20090128145626AAiweIo	Family & Relationships;Friends	Does he like me or just trying to be a better friend?	I know i just asked this but didnt get that many awnsers ;P      in gym we go in groups and do some excersises well me and this guy i like were fooling around and still doing the move we were supposed to be doing and were high 5ing each other at the same time. while we were doing that he told me that i had really nice and soft hands. then he told me during the next excercise that i really looked good in my gym clothes...    then as usual he talked to me on the bus back home but he was a little more open to me about himself than usual.   For the bus thing could it be that we were just talking to each other and the other people we talk to were gone? or could it be that he likes me and for the gym thing does he like me??? its hard to tell when your the person the guy is doing it to even tho i awnser a lot of questions with the same thing... almost    thank-you ?
20090128200727AARKhvb	Family & Relationships;Family	My step daughter has her first bf,?	i have found out that he has been having sex since the 8th. grade.   she is obsessed with him. she wants to spend every minute she can with him, which i understand, but my concern is him talking her into something she's not ready for. she says , she doesn't want sex and is pretty level headed. i trust her but , he's got me worried. i love her so much and only want to protect her from doing anything that could ruin her life. how should i handle this, without being to controlling?   i don't want to run her away from talking to me....
20090128153234AAHUxZY	Family & Relationships;Friends	Is this considered rude or am i overreacting?	Every Friday night me and my friends have a sleepover.  It was also the night of the dance, so only two of my friends were coming that night.  So one of my friends and i are in our PJ's watching a movie when my other friend comes, but she also brought 3 guys with her.  I had never met any of them.  Isn't it kind of rude to invite people over to someone elses house and not even tell the person.
20090128145920AAjgL23	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What would you do if your spouse does not spend enough time with the kids?	Ok what I mean is what would u do if your spouse feels that work is enough and on their off day which is 3x a week do not take any responsibility to spend atleast 30min let alone 10min to spend time with their toddler son/or daughter  (in this case its only one child)so you can have a break atleast to eat or breath (I'm only asking for 10min!). But instead they go to the room and close the door and stay in front of the computer for 3-4 hours,or talk on the phone, or stay in the bathroom for 1hr with the laptop (I kno wierd) and only come out when its time to eat lunch or dinner. Also you and your family keep trying to convey the message to your spouse repeatedly but polietly that they should spend more time with their kid, but they pull the same old phrase "O I work and bring money to the house I shouldn't have to work at home also"...I myself is a bit confused in what to do?

20090128151208AAR5YD9	Family & Relationships;Friends	Is this normal???!?!?	I have this friend who i have known since grade one. We are now in grade 8. Through all of that time, we have fought,lost each other,then  came back to each other, and continued to do that few more times. It is the strangest thing though. We didn't talk for a year, i  hung out with her, and it felt totally normal. During that time, i always felt like she was there. We have our up's and down's , but we are always friends still, which i am very thankful for. I hate to say it, but we have both tried to push each other out of our lives, but when i try to push her out, she wont let me, and the other way around. For example, we went from fighting, to hugging at a dance, to crying with each other in the bathroom. It is the strangest thing, but i love it. Is this normal?

Hi I am getting married next year, I have my venue and photographer booked so far - I like to do things in advance so I do not get stressed near the time      problem is I have no idea about wedding cars, whats the cheapest, what looks best, the current trends etc      could anyone like to share their transport choices for their wedding and why to help me get a grasp of what to do for mine      and when did you make a booking?

20090128203000AAHQ4mF	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I like a guy online? help?	okay so just some background information- i was in a long-distance relationship with a guy i met online for about 9 months. i was completely in love with him but we had to end our relationship. no, he wasn't some old guy, because i met him in real life and he was exactly who he was on the internet (my age, funny, nice, matching to his pictures, etc)   anyways, i promised myself i wouldnt fall for anyone online again.. not because its dangerous (im not stupid), but because it's just so hard.   but 2 weeks ago i was playing this game and somehow me and this guy ending up joking around and stuff... so i added him on AIM and asked him to exchange pictures (him first). we decided to hold up signs with a message for each other so we know the other person is for real. he sent me his picture and he had the sign up, so he IS real, i don't doubt that at all.   the only thing i'm afraid of is, i really, really like him already. he lives closer to me than my first long-distance boyfriend did (im in canada, my first bf lives in hawaii, but my new guy lives in maryland)   should i try to go to the next step, like ask to talk on the phone or something?   please no comments about how dumb internet love is, i know it's dumb, but sometimes these things happen by mistake.   thanks in advance

20090128200415AAdnCfN	Family & Relationships;Weddings	How would you feel if your stepsister did this?	I've been engaged since November of 2007.  My wedding is in June of 2010.  My stepsister just got engaged a month ago and she booked her wedding 3 and a half weeks before mine.      I have only met her once, but my Dad thinks that my fiancee and I are going to be able to pick up, travel out of state, get a hotel, pay for airfare, and give a gift to her 3 and a half weeks before my own wedding.      I'm really not trying to be selfish, but i'm my Dad's only child, and this is his 3rd wife's daughter that he has only known for a year.  She already has her real Father and a former stepfather that she's known since she was 5 years old.  My Dad has not seen me since he married his 3rd wife (October of 2007), yet he has seen her multiple times over the past year and a half and seems more involved in her wedding planning than my own.      Also, he insisted to me from day one (before he even met my stepmother) that he was going to pay for my entire wedding.  I told him this wasn't necessary to pay for the entire thing, but of course help would be appreciated.  Now, my stepsister booking hers ahead of mine, he's saying that he's not sure what he'll be able to contribute.  Again, she has 2 other fathers...why is my Dad getting so involved with thinking about her costs??   Also, because my stepmother doesn't believe my Dad should be helping me out as much with this, he's been sneaking me money behind her back to put towards the wedding.      I'm so confused and hurt.  My Mom, while she hasn't said anything to him yet, is pissed with the whole situation.  What should I do?  Of course my fiancee and I are being proactive and covering our own behinds...but how do we "graciously" decline going to this wedding so soon before ours when we are going to be financially strapped for money and time.  Again, i've only met her once...i really don't owe her much of anything (no offense to her) and also, am I going to be obligated now to invite her and her fiancee, plus my other two step siblings to my wedding out of respect that I was invited to hers??  HELP!!!

20090128203945AAQPZFE	Family & Relationships;Friends	I need help about my best friend... i don't know what to say or do.?	okay, so my best friend has this boyfriend, they've been dating for two years now, off and on. like sometimes they'll break up for two days or about a week. it's never longer then a week. but the thing is, he's the biggest asshole ever. He'll scream and yell at her for no reason when he's drunk and he already said he'd never give up drinking. When she tried asking him to stop he called her names and such. She can't act like herself around him or else he'll call her "childish" or "immature" even though she's not. I've tried talking to her about it and she says she knows about it all and she realizes it already but she loves him and she can't picture herself without him or with anyone else.. and he doesn't have a job, no license or anything. && he doesn't plan to go to college. She wants to but he told her that she's not allowed, that she has to stay home with the kids. and she'd be such a great mom, she wants to give them everything and such. but i don't see how she can without him having a good job or having him let her get one. i don't want her ruining her life... :[ i'm worried about her.. what do you think?

They had jobs( a long long long time ago) but they quit because they weren't on the same shift. So they stayed at home. They still dress a like, do their hair a like, and just do everything together. All they do is sit at home and talk about the Lord. They never have been independent. They can't drive, have no kids, no husband; they sit at home and babysit and get a check once a month and in the mean time they beg for whatever else they need. Is it some kind of mental problem for this(twins who lives as one) it's like they never grew up.

Well, I called insurance & if he had only called before the visits (they happened during his summer visitation and I knew nothing of when they were taking place) and gotten the authorization the first 10 visits would have been zero out of pocket.  Now, since he opted NOT to file with insurance he says I have to pay 50% of the cash payment amount or he'll take me to court again.  He has a LOT more money than I do & it's no big deal for him to drop several hundred dollars. While I sure do want to do all we can to help our daughter, sticking me with over $500 when there should have been NO co-pay seems WRONG.     If he takes me to court over this, any ideas what they'll say?

20090128163903AAd3ytN	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I forgave my wife for having an affair and getting pregnant too?	My wife has been through enough. She cried as I held her tight in my arms and forgave her for fooling around on me.       She said she loves me and was very sorry and that she was not thinking at the time and now she realizes how much I do love her and how much she loves me.      I don't say that the affair was right, but it helped her realize where she stands in our marriage and this has been one big family thing for the last two days. I shared it with yahoo answers and there were lots of good response and thanks for all the great answers as well.       We will celebrate our 25th Anniversary next month and she also stated she wants an abortion as soon as possible and then she also decided to have her tubes tied.      Does anybody disagree with what I decided to do and my wife or do feel I was too easy here?

20090128172130AAYihNo	Family & Relationships;Friends	My Friends are Making me Feel Depressed? ?	I have been so depressed lately because I am constantly surrounded by two people who say they are my friends. The issue is that one of them is very self centered, inconsiderate of other people's times, and could possibly be a user. For example I invited her to my b-day party, she said she was going, the day of the party she never showed up so I called her to see where she was at and she said she didn't want to go anymore because she wanted to sleep. She does that crap every single time you go anywhere with her. She calls my friend in the middle of the night to help her with math problems because before than she had to nap and is now wide awake unconcerned of whether or not she is waking my friend up. Also she gets mad when ever my friend can't give her a ride home or gives her any food. Also when she found out a guy had sex with my friend, she said "why would he want to do you? wow I thought I would be the first person."     The other friend of mine I have known for a 11 years and I now realized that she will only talk to me when ever the first chick I mentioned and another chick isn't around. While she stands around me she always complains on where the other chicks are at and usually just about any small conversation we have, she calls me stupid.     I really want to get away from both of them but they are part of the group of friends that I have. So I would have to deal with it either way and I think it would get worse if I tell them that I don't want to be friends with them anymore. I really don't want to deal with it anymore and I feel so sad because I feel like they see me as a person that is below them. I can't be around someone who isn't treating me as an equal. I have no idea on what I should even concider doing. Please help?
20090225151551AA7G1xb	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How would you feel if your mother was very insensitive and judging?	my mother is my world, i treat her with respect, loyalty and show her love all the time, but she can be down right nasty, ignorant and so insensitive to me at times it makes me wonder "why do i bother" for example, im 24 have 2 kids and a partner for 7 years and if my boys are getting on my nerves i will say it to her and she always replys "well i had you and i know what its like" problem is she didnt have me because my grandparents practically raised me as she is an alcoholic and was drinkin alot, shes off now nearly 5 years since my first son was born, he will be 5 soon. So she tells me to get over it and its my own fault my kids are spoilt, yeah they may be spoilt but its not anyones fault, its the way they are, and they are not "bold spoilt" just demanding at times, but it hurts so bad that she is always blaming me and if somewhat looking down at me as a parent. Im practically on my own as my partner works so much and its just me and my kids all day, even at night my kids sleep with me and he sleeps in the spare bed as there is no room!! but we are ok with this as it will pass!!!! "we hope" LOL, my mum does not go out at night yet she wont babysit,and when i do ask her it is like once every month or even two months she always says im ALWAYS ASKING HER, and im BRINGING THIS ON HER "AGAIN" i just dont get it and im so so hurt, i try my best with her, like at christmas i brought my kids down because she wanted us to help her put up the xmas decorations, i said yes because its a lonely time for her,shes not with anyone and im her only child, so i came down round 6 pm,bought us a chinese take away and by 9 pm she was sh*tty and complaining the kids need to go to bed cause she couldnt handle them.AAAAAAHHHHHHHHH im so god dam frustrated with her.  Sorry i know its a long question, but i could go on forever. Thank you so much for your time and effort to answer, i really appreciate it. And my mum is a good kind person at heart, i just cant take much more of this attitude. by the way she is bipolar which is a big thing but she is taking medication. god blessXXxxXXxx
20090225151554AAtZ0jd	Family & Relationships;Friends	How to befriend someone "unconventional"?	Well there is this person who works in the parking structure I park in.  She works in the booth at the front where you pay.  Anyway, I go through her line every time I park in that structure, and she seems really nice.  We usually make small talk about the weather or I asked her about the company hiring, and sometimes we talk about how it must suck to sit in that cold little booth all day.        Anyway, after talking to her a few times off and on she seems like someone I'd like to get to know a little better.s  Is that weird?  Is there a way I can ask/mention that without it being weird?  As far as I know she doesn't even know my name (I know her's b/c it's on a sign on the booth, though).  What would I say?  I can't really have a long convo there anyway b/c there is usually a line of cars behind me... would it be weird to slip her a note with my ticket stub that just says "you seem cool if you want to talk sometime this is my name and email" or would that be super weird?      Thanks in advance for the advice! :)
20090128181842AA3FwsK	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Should I stay or Should I go??????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!?	OKay so this may be a little long but I hope you can take it all in. When I was pregnant with my husband and I's first child he left and went out all the time with his friends pretty much throughout my whole pregnancy, he was always gone and I always begged him to stay and he always left anyways. Well needless to say I stayed because I was pregnant and only 18 (we were not married at this point). Okay then about 2 years ago we split up because he was taking a lot of narcotic pills all the time to get high and I couldn't take it so I left him. Well 3 weeks after I left him I went to my cousins lake house for the 4th of July, while I was down there I slept with someone. He found out by someone else when I got back, which is fine whatever, but he was really upset which is also understandable. We got back together in August and the following March we got married, I was really happy at this point and everything was going very well. Then we moved to California, which I was not happy about leaving my family but I did it for him and his job. Now that I am here for about 8 months now I still dont really like it...I hate it!~ If you were married to someone that hated where you lived would you move back for them? Also the past few weeks he has started taking the pills and stuff lately and I am afraid he may be doing drugs, he has been leaving and hanging out with these losers of people and I sit at home with a 2 and a 3 year old all day, cooking, cleaning, doing laundry, making sure the kids are fed, making sure the dogs are taken care of....you name it I do it, he does nothing! Another thing is I dont know if I can do this anymore, he also tells me I shouldn't go back to school(im suppose to start school in July and he is telling me not to, Im 22 I have had two kids, did not have time before now I do!). Im just curious, should I leave him? He also calls me a whore and a slut everytime we get into fights over the 4th of July thing, which I never talked to the guy again because in my heart I knew it was wrong...please no ignorant comments I know what I did and I am reminded of it almost everday!!! please dont. So what do you guys think? Should I go on with my life or just keep dealing with the same crap?

20090225150247AAyTf7k	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is my ex-boyfriend as big of an asshole as I think he is?	-He constantly pressured me to go "further" with him even when I told him that I wasn't ready. He would just get angry. He said that it would make our relationship more "mature".   -He broke up with me a week after I agreed to go further with him. I did purely out of pressure and was stupid for letting him manipulate me like that.   -He broke up with me over the phone at 11 at night. The conversation was 27 seconds, until I called him back and yelled at him for 20 minutes for being an insensitive jerk.   -He broke up with me the same day his ex-girlfriend(and best friend) broke up with her boyfriend. He claims it was just a "coincidence". I think not...      Needless to say I am extremely hurt. I know I am so much better off without him. I'm not hurting because I'm not with him, I'm hurting because I feel so stupid for letting him do all of that. I'm pissed that he was the one that broke it off, I should have done it. I am ashamed that I let him do this to me. I haven't seen him since the break up, but I will sooner or later and I will want to probably strangle him when I do.       I'm really struggling here... I have a right to be pissed, right? What do I do when I have to deal with him? Any advice?      We are both 17, by the way.

20090128170636AA9K3EO	Family & Relationships;Family	Why does my mom does these kinds of things?	i am 18 years old going on 19. my brother is almost 21. my mom had a beautiful three bedroom apartment for dirt cheap. my brother has being a pain in the butt trying his best to drive everyone out of the house which he did. she pays the rent for the apartment an all for him. pays the pills and plus feeds him. she always makes excuses for him and stuff. she is afraid to kick him out i guess but it was so easy for her to kick me out because i was always out with my boyfriend and she use to complain that i don't wash dishes or do any house chores which i did all the time. whenever i ask her money or anything like that she would tell me something else; either she is always broke and stuff like that but when it comes for my other siblings, she always have money and stuff to give them. i never disrespected her ever in my life but my other siblings especially my older brother disrespects her all the tim; yelling and being rude to her all the time but i am the one who gets treatd the worse out of all. i am tired of her crap. i dont talk to her that much because i wasnt brought up with her. she left me at a young age to go and have good life. she left 3 quarters of my life to be honest. i hate talking to her sometimes because she alwasy tells her husband everything about her other children and he holds that against her or us. when it soms to me it is always a different story. i am not jealous; i just look at her differently.       sorry this is long. i just need some advice!!!      thanks!!

I am learning to deal with that, but i was wondering... how can I learn to trust guys that I dont know? My sister, for instance, brought home a new male friend today without warning me first... and I panicked. I literally went up to my room, shut the door, and barricaded it with my chair. I didnt leave my room until her 'friend' was gone. I just didnt feel safe around him. Is this normal? Will I ever be able to trust strange guys again?

20090225150222AAlyuf2	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	One of my best friends is going through a messy divorce and custody battle.?	And because I called her soon to be ex-husband an ****** to a so called mutual friend, turned around and told him that I said it.  Now he says he is taking me to court for slander and talking about him plus he told his soon to be ex-wife that if he found out that she had their 2 year old daughter around me, he would take her to Social Services and make sure she didn't get her.  I've heard and I've seen the mental abuse he has caused this woman and to me this is another threat and blackmail to get what he wants.  I've watched this little girl since she was born off and on when they wanted to do something and I've never said anything in front of her, even though she just turned two.  Do I need to be concerned about being dragged into court for this?

20090225151351AAifg1F	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Am I just a friend? Does he like me or not?	There's this guy I like, we're really close friends. I *think* he may have asked me out to a study date before. I KNOW for a fact he likes someone else and I've been encouraging him to confess to her. And he's really unsure about confessing to her...he feels that the girl he likes and he should just be friends. He believes that the girl he likes already knew that he liked her two years ago but the girl hasn't said anything. He explained that everytime he sees her now, he gets an awkward feeling. He says sometimes he feels really dizzy. He's already liked her for two years. But...He always gets me to sit next to him, for a group assignment he'll ask me to be his partner first. He sometimes glances at me across a classroom and I look at him back. We share lots of common interests and he recommends a lot of songs to me too and he does some favours for me sometimes. He is going to start art lessons with me after finding out what extra curricular I have after school. During exams, we studied pretty much 24/7 together on MSN. We talk very often. He reminds me of things I have to do and knows what classes I have next. But he's really dense and doesn't know that I like him, but his really good friend already knows. We're hanging out in a group of nine on the weekend instead of going to the Semi dance. Before deciding to hang out, he asked me twice if I was going to the Semi dance. I'm really, REALLY confused at this moment and need advice as well as to know whether I'm just considered as a really good friend. I've tried to forget about him...but I seem him five days a week...What should I do?

I'm sometimes way too sweet, and she gets annoyed by that..Am I too sensitive? All I care about is her, and I want her to be happy..Sometimes I get paranoid that we'll break up because of my sensitivity, and that annoys her, because she assures me she won't break up with me for that stupid reason..We've been going out for more than 2 months now..it's like she doesn't care about my feelings anymore, and it hurts..

Anyway my bf is so wonderful and good to me as I am him and we both want to make each other happy constantly. Before me and bf got together a friend of mine told his best friend how I felt about him and he said that he is not looking for a relationship because he just got a huge promotion and he wouldnt have time to make much commitment but that he thinks the world of me. Me and his best friend has actually planned to have sex a few weeks before I got with my bf but cancelled it because he knew how much my bf felt about me. He also told my friend that even if he was looking for a relationship he wouldnt step on his best friends turf.   Now that I am with my bf I am happy but at the same time I cant stop thinking about his best friend. He told my bf that he likes me for him and that he is happy for us. I spoke to my bf on the phone today and I could hear his best friend in the back gorund asking if I was gonna come to a party and when my bfsaid he is working over time his best friend said "yep so he can spend it on you". He was constantly in the background talking to me but not talking to me.      What should I do? I feel that I am falling in love with him. I cry over the fact that we are probably never going to be together. I can't stop thinking about him.    How do you think he feels about me?

20090128190804AApXEfX	Family & Relationships;Friends	Question about an X-friend... And to ladies... Never get drunk around creepy men!?	I have been living with my fiance for about almost three years now. One day, out of the blue, a friend of his (and this is a guy) that he has known since grade school emailed him and told him he's coming back from the navy and would like to visit him.. well, us. So the guy comes over one day, and he's kind of hitting on me but I ignore it. He tells all sorts of stupid jokes, and I just laughed at them to be nice.      Anyway, he was visiting for just a week when he told my man that he hasn't anywhere to stay anymore, the people he was staying with before didn't have anymore room. Well my fiance has a big heart, and was nice enough to let him stay at our house for a while. The three of us went out a lot, like three friends just having fun and stuff, and we all went to me and my fiance's friends house down the street.      Well this is screwed up, but sometimes those people can be real pains in the neck, but they are definitely safe and fun company, so we also had a bottle of vodka with us, and sometimes when I don't want to hear their crap (on their bad days) I'd do anything to shut them out, which would usually be read a book. But this time I had a bottle of vodka in my hand, and I just started drinking it down. I wanted to relax, and I just wanted to enjoy myself there and was tired of fighting with them on their bad days. Good thing is I did become more outgoing with them and we had a blast... for a while. Bad thing is I eventually became so drunk, that I must've fallen and blacked out, because next thing I know, I wake up, and there is a creep (my fiances friend) lying right behind me, though I didn't know it was him right away, licking my ears and moving his hips on my back side. (All of my clothes were still on thank Jesus!)      When I became fully aware, I forcefully shoved him off of me and said "what the ****" are you doing?" He told me crap like when I was drunk I was hitting on him and saying that I wished that my boyfriend could be like him and all this crap. I told him I no memory of such a thing, and if I did say that stuff it was the alcohol. But this idiot proceeded to tell me that alcohol brings out your true feelings and yada yada yada.  I explained that I couldn't possibly have feelings for him, that I love my fiance and I didn't know him from Adam!      He just continued his stupidity, I mean what kind of guy would think a woman belongs to him, because she was drunk off her ***, and said things she would never normally say? he kept trying to ask me to either go out to his tent and have sex with him, or go to a motel and lie to my fiance saying that I went to a friends house. I told him HELL NO, I would never do that and he just became angrier and angrier everyday, not just with me, but with my fiance, trying to tell me that my man was no good for me and that I deserved better, But I just kept refusing his crap and told him there are lots of girls in this town who are single and you could get to know them and stuff, but he just wouldn't listen to that.      Eventually, his anger started to scare us, he would disappear and go on these "walks to calm down" leaving  threatening letters on our computer in microsoft word for me and my fiance to see. They would basically explain in so many words that someone should be dead, or that he feels like he should be back in the nut house because the voices he used to hear are coming back (yes, he was in a nut house for that crap before).      So I kicked him out. My fiance wanted him to leave too, but didn't have the heart to say so because my man has such a big sweet heart and doesn't like to hurt people's feelings. So one day, this guy's anger pretty much blew over the top and he started accusing me and my fiance of going through his backpack and taking his stuff out. Well, my anger began boiling up so I told him basically that he had no right accusing us, that he had been treating us, including his own best friend from childhood like **** and I said that he needs to find somewhere else to stay, because we were no longer going to allow him to be here.      Well, he packed all of his stuff and left. We were gone at the time, so he deleted like everything that we had installed into our computer and deleted both of us off of his myspace friends list. A week later, a friend of ours which is also a friend of his called us saying that he left some things there, and he needed them back, but he wasn't going to come back over to get them, so she said for us to give them to her, to give to him. So we did that. A month after that, he came back, acting like he was still our friend and nothing happened, like no hard feelings yada yada yada, and even said he was "helping" us by deleting stuff off our hardrive.      After that, we stopped hearing from him for a long time, but weird things occasionally would happen, and I'm not sure but I think I can connect them to him.       One time in the mid early morning around 5:00am, I woke up to the sound of someone trying to get into my fia
20090128193314AAEtbyz	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Question about an X-friend. And I'm sorry this is so long, it's a really big thing I need to get off my chest.?	I have been living with my fiance for about almost three years now. One day, out of the blue, a friend of his (and this is a guy) that he has known since grade school emailed him and told him he's coming back from the navy and would like to visit him.. well, us. So the guy comes over one day, and he's kind of hitting on me but I ignore it. He tells all sorts of stupid jokes, and I just laughed at them to be nice.      Anyway, he was visiting for just a week when he told my man that he hasn't anywhere to stay anymore, the people he was staying with before didn't have anymore room. Well my fiance has a big heart, and was nice enough to let him stay at our house for a while. The three of us went out a lot, like three friends just having fun and stuff, and we all went to me and my fiance's friends house down the street.      Well this is screwed up, but sometimes those people can be real pains in the neck, but they are definitely safe and fun company, so we also had a bottle of vodka with us, and sometimes when I don't want to hear their crap (on their bad days) I'd do anything to shut them out, which would usually be read a book. But this time I had a bottle of vodka in my hand, and I just started drinking it down. I wanted to relax, and I just wanted to enjoy myself there and was tired of fighting with them on their bad days. Good thing is I did become more outgoing with them and we had a blast... for a while. Bad thing is I eventually became so drunk, that I must've fallen and blacked out, because next thing I know, I wake up, and there is a creep (my fiances friend) lying right behind me, though I didn't know it was him right away, licking my ears and moving his hips on my back side. (All of my clothes were still on thank Jesus!)      When I became fully aware, I forcefully shoved him off of me and said "what the ****" are you doing?" He told me crap like when I was drunk I was hitting on him and saying that I wished that my boyfriend could be like him and all this crap.

20090128184139AAcrXyr	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	If these hubbys were so concerned with wives spending time ?	the neighbor down the street...shouldnt they stay home.?      Last night I went to friend Courtney.s and had some wine....we were thinking of all kinds of ways to keep ourselves warm. A nice neighbor came by(JC,,,,hot looking too) and merely told us that on chilly nights he prefers some hot chocolate and a nice fire place.   Our husbands were no where around.....Anyway after JC offered his suggestion on keeping warm....we were apparently overheard saying how nice it would be to have some of that JC to keep us warm.      Evidently the husbands found out and are all bent out of shape. saying "anyone can make hot chocolate"...then my husband tells my friend that she could snuggle up to a warm body...his or the husbands.      Should I slap him?
20090128192615AATKM2d	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is my boyfriend emotionally abusing me?	I confronted my bf on the phone about his change of personality last night and he was understanding and then suddenly freaked out at me and hung up. He called back later to say sorry and promised that he would change.    He has made this promise twice before...he says he changed because of stressful situations...Anyways...he used to be really nice, romantic, and plain perfect.    Well, we have been together for around 8 months now and the past four months he has gotten worse and worse by the month.   He complained about how I dressed/did my hair etc and I changed that for him and he seems fine with that now...but he calls me stupid a lot and breaks his promises constantly...I have been paying for everything lately although I'm way younger. Last week he bought cheap Costco sushi and brought it home for me and his sister and him to eat...then he suddenly freaked out at us and was like, "I pay for everything!" and his sister walked off and I was just silent and then he was complaining that he did everything too and I was throwing away something and he was like, "you can't even eat right!" and I hadn't eaten all day so I was really hungry too(it was night).   We were laying in bed after watching a movie (he stopped going to movie theaters with me too) and afterwards I was nice and like, "wow. scary, right?" and he suddenly freaked out at me for getting to close to him when I sleep and for a ton of other things(like I liked laying on top of him for a minute sometimes to be nice--I'm really petite so...)and he always smiled and he freaked out and was like, "your knees hurt!"...but he never told me that before...and he was yelling at me for stuff like when he dropped me off at 7-11 to buy a juice and (english is his second language)and was supposedly in illegal parking..but I saw him pull his car out so I thought he was reparking since there were a ton of empty spots and then I bought him candies as a surprise and was in line and the guy at the counter was talking with his customers...so it took a bit longer and he runs into the store and screams at me to hurry up to the point that the guy in front of me has me go ahead of him....and then afterwards he yelled at me that he was in illegal parking and that I was slow etc.   Anyways, he always asks me to give him bjs/massages...and after i start is always like, "I didnt make you do this" but i like doing so because he's nice to me then...   When he makes me cry he tells me, "stop crying or you'll have more wrinkles!" (i'm 18 and have thick EYELIDS...not wrinkles...he's chinese so he hardly has creases in his eyelids).   Anyways, I'm always scared that I'll make him mad...he even gets mad at me when I goof around and grab his butt or something and he will freak out, yell at me, and storm out of the room.   He always tells me stuff like, "You're so annoying! You're just like your mom! You're always like this! Stop crying!"    and if I'm feeling good about myself he'll touch my pimples (I'm still not grown out of them :() and be like, "I didn't SAY anything."   and his compliments (except on occasion) tend to be like, "wow. you're so beautiful! What did you put on your face?" :(   Anyways...I'm just wondering if this is considered an emotionally abusive relationship...   Thanks^^

I know this guy through my family from years ago, we were friends until two years ago, we were both in relationships, soon after that I had a car accident and my world fell around me (I was a dancer) I gradually started to gain lost of weight, I mean 70lb (35kg)      anyway he got in touch with me again and we have been talking again, and he wants to meet, he says he loves me, and I'm this huge girl with a scar on her face, I wasn't even slim to start with, I want to meet him, But I don't think rejection will help (since I'm recovering from depression caused by the accident) I told him what happened, told him I gained weight, he said he doesn't care, he saw (My face) on the cam as well, But then again the weight is not on my face, Please tell me what to do?

Were super close. We might as well be married. I'm totally devoted to her and to show her that I text her and tell her "I love you, Sweet dreams" every night. I mix it up a little bit and throw some stuff in there but I always say those two things in some form or another. If your man did that, would it bother you? I'm not sure if I'm annoying or not.

My boyfriend and I have been together for awhile now and in all this time I ALWAYS have to drive to see him which is about a 30 to 40 minute drive. He will never come see me. He lives alone and I live with some ppl but I dont think that should matter because all he would have to do is pick me up. For awhile I had no license and risked getting pulled and my car towed but he has always had a license he is just too busy smokin and sleeping. Honestly, I have guy FRIENDS who talk to me more than he does. I don't know what it is. Then when I don't respond to his text msgs right away because I am at work, he thinks that I don't like him and he thinks that he is a worthless person and I am just like geez I was with a student (I work at a college). Anyway, what is a nice way to end this gently? Should I end this or try to work things out? Help!!

20090128185934AAJEhcN	Family & Relationships;Friends	I am really considering cutting this friend off from my life. Do you think this will be a good thing.?	Ok. So me and this girl, Jill, we've been friends for some time. I have known her since 7th grade. We get a long great and we joke a lot, but we both have issues. More her than me. It was fine up until 10th grade, when she really started to act up. We would fight a lot, and because of that we would end up in the VP's office, A LOT. She would do me more harm than good, like we would both bring the worst out of each other. She would always apologize, and I accept for the mistakes that she has made. Which is good, apologizing is great. But she did it A LOT, and sometimes I would say to myself "Enough is Enough!". But I gave her a chance, and wanted to see if she would change. The following summer, Jill told me that she was going to another school. So I didn't here from her in like a couple of months (I really don't remember) I ran into her at Friendly's and we exchanged cell phone  's, and we texted from there.  From then it was a much calmer relationship because we weren't seeing each others faces 24/7 at school. Up until like around a few months ago, it was fine, we met up at football games (I graduated H.S. '08, she has to stay til 21). Her parent's divorced and she was very upset about it, so I said "You know, I am with you every step" because I went through the same thing. It worked for a little bit, but now that she is seeing this boyfriend, she's like completely ignoring what I am advising her to do. Like she starts these things, and I am fed up with her apologies. I deleted all of her facebook pages, and deleted her from my contacts. Ive had enough of her. Do you think this is a right thing to do, to drop her as a friend? I don't need this. I have better friends who are not as psychotic as her.
20090128190122AAwa3mP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Am I A Stubborn Dumbass With This Girl?	I work for my family. We hire this girl to work summers with us when I'm 19 and she is 14. She is awesome, I have no problems spending hours and hours with her. I immediately liked her. She also seemed to really like me. For the three summers we worked together she hit on me. My family would even joke how much she had a crush on me. The last summer we work together she tells me she loves me, begs me to stay in contact when I go away to college. I refuse, partially cause I felt it inappropriate due to the fact she worked for me as well as age. Also cause I never had a relationship before and I was scared.      Six months later I get the hint that I broke her heart I apologize in a well meaning but girly letter. I don't know what I was trying to do at the time, apologize or get with her, as she was still underage at the time. I know I felt really bad thinking I broke her heart. Instead she gets mad at me and tells me to never talk to her again. I TRY and play it off like a joke, tell her co workers it was a joke and tell my mom who owns the company it was a joke. Apparently she wasn't heartbroken cause of me, instead her BF dumped her.      So anyway I get my freaking heart broken, drop a ton of weight, cry, and generally drift into even greater depression that my life already is in before this. I have problems sleeping, concentrating, eating, and just dealing with life, I am constantly in a haze. But to mask the fact that I actually like her and she hurt me I start being more social, and more involved in life. I put on a fake face of confidence. I try to keep my life busy so I can forget about her. It is almost two years later and I still have problems.      Apparently she forgave me in the six months after this happened. She no longer works for my family but in the two summers I have worked for them, she has come into my place of work a lot, called my store wondering when I am working, and I get a lot of hang up phone calls. She doesn't say anything to me, she is generally very quiet and gives off the impression of being intimidated by me. I ignore her. But her episodes of basically stalking me makes me spiral downward back into my eating disorder and body image disorder that I had struggled with many years before.      I guess she still wants to be with me but due to my own ego/ being a baby I refuse to even acknowledge her and thus that she hurt me.

20090128184538AAWyrYJ	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Am I wrong to be livid?	My husband and I are newlyweds, and not to mention young but we are soulmates and best friends. He's 22, and I am only 21. We made an agreement not to drink more than once a week since we both were alcoholics before we met and alcohol just brings drama into our relationship.. Not to mention the love of my life died 4 years ago from drinking and driving..      My husband went to his boss's birthday party for a total of 3 hours, and in that 3 hour period consumed 4-5 beers. Usually 2 beers gets him drunk because he's just as much a light weight as I am. I offered him to drive him there & pick him up but he said no.. He came home after the 3 hours, and mentioned that he was hot because of the alcohol. Which means he still had to consume enough right before he left to of been driving under the influence. He's a horrible driver as it is, but to drive drunk?       His excuse was he felt 'fine to drive and have driven worse off'.. I asked him if it would of been someone else who had felt 'fine' while behind the wheel and had a completely accidentally car wreck with me, how would he feel, he replied it was a stupid question because he never hurt anyone...

There are these to girls that I like, one goes to the same school as I do but she's new and one of my friends overheard that she is not a virgin but she looks astonishing, the other girl goes to a different school I've only heard that she might not be a virgin from one of my friends but I can't imagine her being that way and I really like her smile. Why do I like them, I don't want to have sex with them because I had no Idea of their vcards until after I started to like them, but what made them stand out.
20090128190923AAMpGuq	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What can I do to prove I have a heart?	When I am dating potential new members of my harem I have difficulty convincing the ladies that just because I am plastic doesn't mean I am heartless.

20090128185300AACbMnD	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Ok what would you say if your husband or wife said that they didn't like you shaking hands with the opp. sex?	Ok this may be a little confusing...but what if your spouse told you that he/or she did not like you shaking hands (as a greeting) to the opposite sex or giving hi-five b/c they really didn't like the contact but then they go right on in and simply do the opposite?
20090128192901AArWDtZ	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is it normal for a young man to not trust women his own age?	I really don't trust women who are around my age because the overwhelming majority of them are annoying, desperate, and likes to play games. Don't ask how old I am because it's really none of your business.    Don't think I'm gay because I don't trust women. I don't trust men either. I don't trust anyone.    Is it normal for a young man to not trust women his own age or even give them a change for a relationship?

20090128192348AA7qjAc	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girl and young women 14 to 21, why does it seem like so many of you do not practice safe sex?	Of course, this is an assumption I am basing upon what I have read on yahoo, so I don't mean to be judgemental, and I know this is not true for everyone, but I have to be honest --  I have been answering questions on yahoo for well over a year, and I am shocked at the number of questions that revolve around young girls becoming pregnant or contracting an STD simply because they didn't practice safe sex. I just don't understand this. What is it that could make someone become so careless -- we're taking about something that can change your life forever whether it be a baby or disease. I am not that old, still in my thirties, so I can still remember what peer pressure feels like, and how much boys can play on your emotions, but for the life of me, I just don't understand the lack of responsibility. Is it the lack of resources to get access to condoms, do you think these things can't happen to you so you don't worry about it? I really want to know, as I am the mother of three girls ( 8, 7, 2), and I want to make sure that I do everything I can to enable my girls to feel comfortable enough to come to me when they are frightened or in trouble. I would be mortified if I thought my daughters felt more comfortable talking to words on a computer screen versus talking to me. I mean, I understand that these things can be uncomfortable -- I remember the embarassment of asking questions and the fear of what my parents might do or what punishment would come my way, or if my boyfriend would reject me if I told him no. But I was more afraid of the alternative by not being responsible.

20090128190801AAFsZWT	Family & Relationships;Family	How to get revenge on my mom!!!!?	My mom is always punishing me for no reason. i mean i get punished all the time and i am a 15 year old lame with no friends. I don't do bad things. I wish i could but i'm just too scared. It's weird because the people who do bad things don't get punished for just small stupid stuff. Okay well i was bringing my mom a knife from the kitchen to her room i said something to my brother from behind his door when he was in his room. He opened the door and threatened to beat me held my knife tightly. We both knew that nothing was going to happen it was just like a joke between us. And my mom knew this! My brother laughed and left the room my mom said. "Just because of that! I am going to delete all of your Angel recordings off of the DVR!" We have a DVR with our Comcast. ANd i had like 6 recordings i never saw that i was waiting to watch during the weekend! I went downstairs about a half an hour later and my mom was down there i tried to ask her to please stop and i'm sorry. She told me she had already deleted all of them and if i said anything else she would block the show completely! That's the thing, me and my mom don't have conversations when she says something and i try to explain my side she tells me i'm arguing and when i ask her what she's talking about she just takes something away from me as punishment! If you know what ANGEL is you will know it has nothing to do with knives. It is about a vampire with a soul David Boreanaz plays Angel. The show ended about 4 years ago. I still watch it, because i didn't watch the show when it was actually on the air normally. My mom has never actually seen the show in her life and knows nothing about it. but 'assumes' it's about knives????? And my brother never gets his stuff deleted!! This isn't the first time she has done something like this to me! I think it's because I like different things that might seem weird to my family when my brother doesn't watch that stuff. She said if i say anything else she will delete Paranormal State. Which is totally different it is a show with real people who go around helping people who report having hauntings in their houses. She also has never seen this! She feels that its bad but she doesn't think any of the shows my brother watches it bad even though most of them really are like The Wire (about gangs and stuff) and other stuff. I want to get her back. I can't delete her recordings because she'll know exactly what i did and probably ban me from the DVR and the TV all together. What should i do to get her back????? Don't tell me not to do this because i am going to! but i am asking for some good ideas. Because if i get answers telling me not ot do it i'll probably end up doing something worse than any of you could have ever thought of. so please help. And if possible some revenge on my brother too....

20090128184412AAtaXGh	Family & Relationships;Family	Do you think they're overreacting?	Ok, my parents are unbelievable. They say I'm being the ridiculous one but to me it's the other way around! Here's the situation: Lately I've been coming downstairs or upstairs, arriving in the room, whatever, and my parents have been asking, "What was that sound?" and I always ask, "What sound?" and they say, "The sound that we heard when you were coming into the room, it sounding like you made it?" and then they say some deal about how it sounded like something broke and I say that I don't know what they're talking about. Now there are a bunch of sounds that I could think of that I caused before coming into the room. Often closing a door, or dropping my phone, or just running down the hall / steps. But those would all be normal things that they shouldn't even have to ask about! So after a while I ask them why are they being so suspicious of these sounds all the time and they freak out and say that I'm saying they're accusing me of something, and then they get into this whole big argument with me, all the while I'm trying to tell them that we shouldn't even be having this conversation in the first place because it's just a stupid subject.      So that's the case, now nearly the same thing just happened a couple minutes ago before I came here to type this question. My brother and I went in the basement to find a pair of headphones we had left down there earlier and when we come back up our parents ask, "Now what was THAT sound?" and they had asked this earlier today about something stupid, so we're obviously kinda mad and we ask them why they're being so stupid about it and they start the argument AGAIN, and get this, during the argument we told them over and over again that we had no idea what sound they were talking about, at least not one that they should be freaking out about (The only sound we could think of was running up the stairs or closing the door) and they say exactly the following, "We are your parents, and were not asking you if you heard something, we're TELLING you that you heard something! It's impossible for you not to have heard that sound! So just tell us what it was!" That is STUPID! And now they're not letting my brother spend the night at his friends house and it's just the stupidest thing in the world!      So what do you think? Are they overreacting?

I of course looked at her and he looked at me and smiled, and I smiled too, without even knowing. The smile gave me butterflies and made me happy, which makes me think she is interested because a regular smile would not have made me go crazy because I love a girl that smiles. But a couple days earlier, she was walking towards me but she had her head looking the other direction when I was looking at her. What does that mean? Is she interested?

She stares at me during class sometimes and quickly looks away when I look over. The problem is that now that she has been unable to go out with me two times because of other plans, I feel it is hard to talk with her now. I don't know what to say, and she wont talk to me because she fells too nervous and shy. What should I do??

20090128185415AArliPb	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	She is starting to play mind games, what do I do?	I've always noticed (well at least with me) that women are very interested and smitten at first during a relationship, but as the relationship continues I've noticed the mind games coming on. You know the mind games women play with the phone, email, the infamous waiting game. I hate it cuz I start to lose respect for her and my feelings for her eventually fade.      Its counter productive to do this in a relationship, so what do I do? Why do women start doing this? One girl told me that mind games are a type of flirtation and I should take it as a compliment! If that is so should I play them right back with her? Since its a type of flirtation? Do women like it?

20090128191249AA2zrc1	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should we makeup or breakup?	My boyfriend and I have been going out for two months but he broke up with me this morning because he felt that we never get to see each other. Both of our parents are overprotective so we rarely ever get to go out. We both have the same bus stop, so we used to always walk home together. His brother's friend (who's a girl) wondered why were weren't walking together as usual. When I told her she tried to get us back together. And I think she succeeded. His brother told him to hug me and he did, so I think he wants to get back together. The problem is, I'm not sure if I want to. I have conflicted feelings towards him. Part of me wants to be with him, but the other part just wants to move on. I really don't want to be in an up and down, bipolar relationship. He breaks up with me and then wants to make up with me all in the same day. I already see that a lot with my parents. Yet, I think I still might like him. I don't know what to do!!!

We are 25. Yes we got married young but we didn't rush into it and we talked about it for a long time before we actually did it. We were even engaged for a year and a half before we got married. My husband and I have had people living with us for the past 8 months and this has caused a lot of strain in our relationship. We no longer spend alone time together and we don't have sex because it is awkward. Now my husband has told me that he is questioning our relationship because he feels like he has missed out on things by getting married so young. He says that he knows it is not my fault and that I didn't do anything wrong but he feels like he is resenting me because of it. He says he still loves me but he can't shake this feeling and he doesn't know what to do.  I love my husband more than anything in the world and do not want to lose him... please help!!

20090128185716AASdJoC	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	33 years old (my first relationship) and after 12 years with my wife, she's asked for a "temporary" separation?	Ok, I'll be completely honest.  I lost my job in October and as much as I've looked, I haven't been able to find another.  Willingly, I gave my truck back (repossessed) to the bank, as I think this was the best option.  I was an alcoholic, which I'm working on.  My wife said she wanted a trial separation after 12 years living together, 6 married.  So, I completely understand why she kicked me out and is upset with me.  My question is about how she's handling this.  When she asked me to leave, I thought she needed space and we'd be apart for 2-3 weeks.  She asked me to leave on Nov 14.  Since then we've seen each other a couple of times, but she hasn't wanted to talk about the problems (she's not completely innocent).  Since we went to dinner on 12/31, all I'm getting is short responses via text, she won't answer my calls.  I've asked if it's over or if she needs time, but she won't tell me.  I've told her she's not being fair, she won't answer.  I'll be devastated if it's over, but at least I'll be able to move on.  I know the separation is my fault, but I'm getting angry at the lack of communication and after 12 years, I think she owes me the courtesy.  I've never been violent, I've made some bad decisions.  Also, she is my first relationship, so I've never been in this situation before.  What do I do?

I'd known the girl for the better part of 4 years and suddenly she gets a new, more popular friend, and now she finds a way to ditch me? They kept putting words in my mouth, and saying truly absurd things. I'm concerned if anyone else has gone through this? What is this a jealousy thing?

20090128185626AAYpVR6	Family & Relationships;Family	How can i confront my teacher?	i hate my chemistry teacher. im a sophomore (16) and only 4'8", no im not a midget. but im the shortest kid in my class and she seems to always pick on me. She acts like she's not trying to be mean about it but i feel like she only wants to embarrass me in class by using me as examples. like today she got the tallest guy and girl come up in front with the shortest guy and girl. she asked us to stand next to each other so when the shortest girl stood by me she was taller than me and my teacher kinda smirked and almost whispered that even our shortest girl is taller than me making the whole class laugh. She ended up making us do some dumb presentation on how energy and wavelengths flow by using the tops of our heads as the peak. Which technically doesnt make sense cause its now how tall or short the wave is but how long/short horizontally so i think she just wanted to humiliate me. Ive been dealing with this kinda stuff all year and want it to stop, so how? Should i try to arrange a meeting with her? oh and her procedure of how we line up to leave the room is tallest to shortest so im always last. i just think she dislikes me cause im short and shes kinda tall maybe 5'9" and maybe she had a bad incident with a short person. all i know is she is discriminating me and i think she could actually be fired, right? suggestions.

20090128191318AAP4nyO	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Acting weird?? (PLEASE READ)?	So a guy who I've been friends w/ for 2 yrs and I tried dating for about 6 wks about 6 months ago and it was kinda crazy. He and I both go to the same college, so we're in our 20s. I haven't seen him since we quit talking, but he did call me once out of the blue for no reason. The other night he came into a restaurant on our campus and he had his new girlfriend w/ him. I was sitting w/ some friends and I didn't even look at him. He and the girl ordered and then he left her at the counter to pace around the center of the restaurant. My roommate kinda watched what he did, but I didn't want him to see me looking so I just kept talking to my friends. He continued to pace and look at the ceiling and he even kept opening and closing his phone (the gf is still at the counter by herself). He finally opened up his phone and texted "Hey! :-)" to me while he was only about 3 ft away!! I just looked up and said hey. Like I had much of a choice at this point. Then he comes up to my booth and talks like old times. He talked for a good couple of minutes. Finally, the gf comes up and tries to hand him his coke. He doesn't even look at her. He just keeps talking to me. After she did that about three times I kinda looked at her and he finally took the cup, but kept talking. I couldn't believe he treated her that way. It was pretty rude on his part. But why in the world would any guy act so weird?? It was like he didn't know what do do with himself. Couldn't he have just said hey to be nice and go on? My friends suggested that he hasn't exactly gotten over me. I wish I was over him bc I know I deserve better, but I still feel for him (only God knows why). It was one of those things that you liked up the moment you saw them and didn't even really know the kinda things (he admitted that too). So, what do you think?? I still feel funny just when I see him. What's his deal?

20090128192359AASOrch	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What should i do if my Friends husband is cheating and she's been manipulated by him?	How do you break the spell put on a woman by her manipulating husband? The story; she begged me to help find out if her husband was cheating again. I found out by accident he was cheating via he sent a text to another one of my girlfriends. The texts said, "When we hugged I don't want 2 let go. When u kissed my cheek, i wanted that on my lips. ***** I apologise 4 starteling u. I just thought I wish I could. When yall came 2 the house over the holidays, i wanted 2 tell u then. I have some pretty strong feelings 4 u.", she responded "you need to go home to your wife!", I got this text forwarded to her and now I'm the bad guy. She says he does that in front of her to alot of her friends. I have been on the giving and receiving end of this and neither has a desirable outcome. Can they save the marriage or should I try some type exorcism to get her back to self respect and values?
20090128192520AADQ73n	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Do you think my wife is an alcoholic?	I have been married for about 2.5 years.  During most of that time, if my wife drinks, it's about 1-2 glasses of wine with dinner.        However, about once a year she will have some type of serious binge with hard liquor usually resulting in a huge argument and talks of splitting up.  This has happened 4 times, including 2 times before we were married, over a 3.5 year period.      One time about 1.5 years ago, I found out she was getting up in the middle of the night and sneaking drinks (hard liquor).  I assume it happened multiple times, but I only know for sure of the one time.  We talked about it, and she agreed to only drink beer and wine and claimed her system didn't handle liquor well.  I trusted her, and did not see any evidence of that behavior continuing.      Tonight when I talked to her on my way home from work, I sensed something was wrong as her speech was a bit slurred.  She said she was just tired.  When I got home she was VERY soundly asleep and didn't wake up when I came in, or when I gently nudged her.      There was no other evidence to suggest she had gone back on her old habits, but I don't want to constantly be suspicious and mistrustful.      We also have 2 small children, and while I know she would never intentionally do anything to harm them, if she is drinking when I'm not around, that potentially puts them in harms way.      Any ideas, thoughts, suggestions?  As I see answers, I may add details so please check back if you have time.      Thanks.

We have gone out in the past and have since we have broken up a year ago have come to be bestfriends and we tell each other everything but I started liking her again and I havent told anyone and about 4 months ago she broke up with her boyfriend. I have asked her if she has a crush anyone and she tells me no, that she is sick of all the guys in our grade but then she will put on myspace surveys that she kind of has a crush on a guy. I asked her to our school dance a few days ago just as friends and she said yes and i told her as long as none of us winds up getting a girlfriend or boyfriend that we could go together and she told me that she doubts she will because she is sick of all the guys at our school and in our grade? She also gives me mixed signals and acts like she likes me but then tells me she doesnt like any of the guys in our grade but then says on the surveys she does and tells other people she kind of has a crush on someone and i dont want to ask her because i dont want to ruin our friendship if she doesnt like me back so can you help me tell if she likes me? Is there a way i can find out without asking her?

I love going to Youth Group, but she is sadly in my friend group which is almost all of the ninth graders (there's only 7 9th graders) and then there are two other girls. I don't know what to do. Please  help!   BTW:   Example of her annoying-ness   I got a pair of yellow skinny jeans, and she decides, after seeing them, that she should go to the same exact store and buy the same exact ones, (she looks MUCH better in them, believe me) and insists we wear them everywhere together.   Please respect this question and not downplay it juvenileile drama. Thanks.
20090128201008AAx9Z1y	Family & Relationships;Family	I think I was molested by my brother in law last night.?	I was at my brother's house with my sister and her husband (my brother in law). Everyone was drinking (I wasn't, I'm 16), so we had to stay over because nobody was fit to drive. We were sleeping on the floor, my sister was next to her husband and I was on the other side of him. We're close, so I didn't think it was weird. I woke up in the middle of the night and his hand was down my pants, messing around. Not going inside, just messing around. I kind of maneuvered out of the way. I'm pretty sure he was asleep, and maybe he thought I was my sister? I just feel gross now. I haven't told anybody because I don't want to get him in trouble or anything. But I just feel so weird about it now. Was I molested or do you think it was an accident?
20090128194431AAe3jeK	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Maternity Gown vs Regular Gown?	I've had a look at maternity gowns and don't really care for them too much. My question is has anyone ever tried buying a regular gown in a few sizes larger and just had it altered to fit your new pregnancy curves??? Were you successful at this and did it work?      My pre-pregnancy size was 3/4...I've got a bit of a belly but am still petite in size...

20090128195353AA9JlQA	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Having some issues with color! Helppp!! ?	Okay so here goes. Originally my colors were light green, deep pink, and a turqoise. I was having issues trying to get the three considerably bold colors to come together so i decided to eliminate the turqoise and put in champagne. I took my sister shopping for her matron of honor gown and we found a beautiful gown in the color called "mermaid" which is like a turqoise. So now it looks like I need to incorporate the turqoise again.      Should I take out the pink and use champagne roses as my flowers and have champagne, turqoise and light green?? Or should I have it turqoise, champagne and the deep pink.       I want to have white table cloths with champagne colored overlays on them so I am worried about it looking busy.       Please Please help!!

20090128201658AAC83xP	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My husband and I rarely make love anymore, how can I make him want me like he used to?	My husband and I have been married just over a year.... we rarely make love anymore. I realize I just had our baby a month and a half ago and my body could be a turn off for him.. i am not that much bigger than i was before.. i am a small woman. He says he has low libido because of stress and finances have caused us much stress the passed 6 months but I wonder if there is anything I can do to make it like it was before. Any input would be great?
20090128200829AA6IUfb	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	GUYS: He is thinking about me after this much time?	I just want some male opinions. I have a guy contacting me and it has been about 6 months since we have talked. He told me that he misses me. We were very emotionally involved, but never physical...       My question... do you think he just misses me as a friend? If I am not interested in someone and haven't talked to them in 6 months, I don't contact them and tell them I miss them. I just don't care.       Next question... if you are still thinking about a girl after 6 months of no communication do you think that shows he has strong feelings for me? How much do you think he cares?

20090128202209AAVEfJF	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girl hellp please answer... Easy 10 points?	OK so long story short ive liked this girl since september and found out that she likes me. But she said she wasnt ready for a bf yet.  i was dissappointed, but w.e. so weve been talking ever since. it annoys me when we talk on aim and she takes over 5 minutes to answer,,, and then has 1 word answers anyway. But i still talked to her. TOnight i wasnt in a good mood. So i took longer to answer her. on average prolly 3 miinutes. She says why arent u talking to me? and she says well if ur going through some stupid emo stage and wanna get over it alone then w.e (i am in no way emo). i really wanna punch her in the face, but im not like that. I dont know what to do. Im prolly already in the friend zone anyway, but i cant get over her

20090128201710AA6LIEt	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Some pretty detailed sex questions ?	The following questions are pretty graphic and personal, you don't have to read them but i would appreciate some serious answers to satisfy my raging curiosity, thanks.      So i have been friends with this girl for a while, and she has had sex lots of times with a couple different guys, but i have never had sex.  Ive done everything except sex, like oral and what not.  Ive been waiting to have sex with some one for a long time and now she wants to with me, and we have a complicated relationship and all but its nothing shallow what we're doing so don't worry about that part.   First of all, for the last few months i have been getting a lot of oral sex and i have been masturbating quite a bit more than i used to.  I think it's because of this that when i am getting to the point of climax, i barely feel anything, my penis has lost a lot of its sensitivity and i was wondering if there was a way i could correct this as fast as possible, or whatever it takes.   Not only that, but even though i feel less of the sensation before ejaculating, i seem to finish a bit earlier than i would like. Any fixes for this as well?   And for lasting longer, and being harder, would it be better for me to not masturbate or anything like that during the time leading up to the day I'm going to have sex? Which is most likely in about 10 or 12 days.   Just want to make sure i last as long as possible, and perform best as possible.   Thanks a bunch, serious answers only please.   And go into as much detail as possible, and feel free to add anything that might be helpful or some little tips for the things i mentioned.   Thanks again.

Say you been dating your man for 11 months. you move in with him. and everything goes great.  THEN, he takes classes at say Phoenix University and this is all that consumes his life.  He doesnt hang out with you. He turns you down for sex. and he doesn't take me out on dates, except to carls jr.

20090128201635AAzt1mi	Family & Relationships;Friends	Both of my besties are fighting; they want me to pick between them! Help?	Ok, so my two best friends are hating right now. ( Each other ) So they split and are starting to make there own little " Cliques " and they both keep asking me to be in theirs. I like them equally ( a lot ) but I don't know what to do! Is there any chance this has happened to any of you, or you have some advice???
20090128200243AA6jQdH	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Serious guy advice needed!?	Okay so this is kind of like a two question in one thing. I'm having some recent problems with my ex and I'm having some other problems with my new potential crush...    About my ex, we started going out about a month ago and dated for    1) about 3 weeks until we both decided we would break it off. He asked to be friends and I was like okay whatever. His friend like passed by me a few days later and called me a *****. Long story short, big fight and me an my ex haven't talked since. I hate having such tension between us what should I do?      2) I kinda like two different guys right now. One is one of my most recent really close guy friends. The two of us met this year and instantly became really close. We don't talk much out side of school but we hug in the hallways and we walk together from one of our classes. He's been kind of avoiding me lately, not waiting after class and walking away when I start talking to our mutual friends. Advice? Guy number two is this guy that I had kind of a friendly rivalry with last year. He kind of teases me sometimes about little things but I tease right back. I'm a very aggressive kind of girl so I'm not afraid to get in peoples faces even when I'm joking around. I recently became really popular in my school and he asked me randomly yesterday if it was true that since I became popular I became easy with my guy friends. I got in his face and said something along the lines of you know me well enough to know I'm the furthest thing from easy but instead of moving his face away and breaking the awkwardness he moved closer and said yeah I can't be to sure. Do you guys think he likes me? Sorry to ramble. basically 10 points for best advice.

20090128202411AAmz7Z0	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I have a girl problem. Help?	There's three girls i'm kinda looking at.    couple things about me:   I'm 18   I'm fairly well known throughout my high school   I'm very sociable, and have no problem talking to anyone about anything   i have a beard. ladies, advice on that? keep it, shave it?   i smoke marijuana on occasion (about twice a month), but would quit in a heartbeat if asked by the right lady   i recently got out of a relationship (i have another question based on that, check my profile)      the girls:   1. She's in my college english class (i'm in running start) and very cute, and she's my age. she says hi every morning. we don't flirt, but it's pleasant conversation. she does live a considerable distance from me (about 45 minutes of driving THERE, not to mention back again) but i am willing to do that if she turns up to be worth it. Don't think she smokes (so i would quit for her), and i haven't brought up that i have.      2. Girl who goes to my high school. I know she drinks, highly doubtful that she smokes, but she is still cool. we smile at each other a lot, and have a pretty good conversation system in place. my age, cute, fun loving, good friends with all the people i'm friends with. She told one of her friends that she thinks i'm cool, obviously not thinking i'd hear it from her friend. she blushed when i told her i knew, but in a good way.      3. not really a dating option, but would be a nice one time thing. here's the catch: she's 14. wouldn't be hard to get, but i don't think i want to be that guy. I'd bed her, then leave her. i think that's the agreement we both have, as she is self described as "easy".       i only bring up #3 because i just got out of a relationship (on good terms, i still talk to my ex) and don't know how i feel about another one so soon. i wouldn't mind a hook up, and would have a good time (she's the most attractive out of the three).      any ideas?
20090128200458AALEvrW	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Lacking affection with my bf?	I love my bf and been with him for 4 years now. in the beginning he was affectionate and he kissed me all the time, but stop after we were a couple. he claimed he dont like to kiss.  i've missed it for years because i'm a kisser and love romance and affection. other than that he's a great guy, but i cant live without this. i recently told him this is a major problem and he claimed he will work on it, but i kinda know he wont change, but i feel like i need to give him a slight chance.  Problem is I have this friend who i am soooo attracted too and we hooked up years ago, but it was what it was and now I just think about kissing all the time. We dont like each other like that. we been able to do what we do and continue on with our lives.  I dont want to have sex with him, i just want the affection part of it.  i know it sounds crazy but something so little to him is just so important to me.  however, i'm really thinking about making out with my friend and i know people dont agree with me about cheating but i lack this so much in my relationship and people dont just say break up with him because  from the outside people feel like its so easy to do.  Am i wrong for doing this????

20090128194109AAakAcZ	Family & Relationships;Weddings	My future daughter in-law is upset.She wants to wear a white wedding gown but her Mother terribly put her down?	She wants to wear a white dress and her Mother told her that everyone would laugh at her (a lot more was said) and that she will not approve of the wedding, and may not even attend, if she wears it.  I feel badly because I was with her when she purchased it and I didn't realize it was still a big deal these days.  This is her first marriage but she has a little boy, which is why her Mother disapproves of her wearing white.  We are hispanic but I'm from the modern world and she is from the old world.  Please help, I'm just curious, is it really still taboo or wrong of her to wear a white gown even in our modern days?
20090128201627AADDL4p	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Adult Only Receptions are Selfish ?	Can anyone please give me a reason why Adult Only Receptions are not selfish.    I can't wrap my head around this. I believe it will almost always create an issue with at least one family since they will have to find and pay for a sitter. (Not that this is a tremendous amount of work, but it is an inconvenience.)    What is the motivation behind them?    I have seen invites that so eloquently word this request, but I still see it as "Leave all the whiny, dirty brats at home, so the rest of us can get drunk in peace."    And I don't buy the idea that it's to protect the children from the dangers of alcohol. I've been to several weddings with children and alcohol, and each child went home unscathed.     Please give me a legitimate reason as to why these receptions are not selfish.
20090128195402AAGVRLl	Family & Relationships;Friends	Extreme best Friend Problems please help!?	O.k. sorry if this is long!          My best friend of 8 years had a b/f for 6 months.  Decided she wanted a baby. (don't ask me why)  Ended up getting pregnant 2 months later!!!  She was happy with him until the baby arrived.  All of a sudden he doesn't want to help her at all with the child.  He clams he will only help when his son is old enough to do father and son activity's.   He started to become over protective of her, never letting her out of the house!  Not even to see her family.  If she would try to stand up for herself  he would hit her!!  Once i found out about this i went down to spend the week with her to make sure she was o.k.    He then told her she was not aloud to go to the store with me.  So i stood up for her and told him that she didn't deserve this and he needs to back the f*** off!  Well i went home and she calls me crying saying he just told me that he has a crush on you!  WTF is that about?  He has a child with my best friend and likes me?  Well a couple months go by and i get another call from her. She said, "I'm pregnant again". And that he wanted baby #2.  Shes currently 4 months pregnant.  And is afraid to leave him because she thinks no one else will want her with 2 kids.  Is also afraid he will hurt her.  I've already told her to call someone about it and she won't.      Please give me some advice to tell her!   I've told her plenty but she is to afraid...
20090128195916AA1wP50	Family & Relationships;Friends	I don't get it. Why do they always do this to me?	Ok, so I have two groups of friends (not really groups). One has 3 and they are kind of the "bad" girls. But even though they smoke, drink, and ditch school, they're really not bad people. And the other 'group' has two people, they are the smarter, book worms types. Let's just call first group Group A and 2nd Group B.  I like Group A better. They're just more interesting and I have more fun with them. I can connect with them more. I love Group B, but they get boring after awhile.  One person from Group A is everyone friend (jsyk)  One day, someone from Group A told me that everyone in Group A doesn't like the two girls in Group B. But they all like me. So I'm kinda in the middle with my other friend.  But, even though they say they like me and they're my friends, they ALWAYS leave me behind. Like, when I'm hanging out with Group B, they ignore me. I don't know if it's because of the other 2 girls in Group B they don't like or what but it's starting to piss me off.  I love Group B, like I said, I love them to death. But I don't really like hanging out with them.    Anyway, my problem is, is Group A my friends or not? They say they are, but they always leave me behind.     And Group B already knows Group A don't like them, they're fine with it and they're fine with me hanging out with them.    Sorry if this got confusing :]

20090128193520AALrGwe	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why am I so stupid? I'm confused about all this....?	So, I met this boy one day at my bff's birthday party. I met him there and we talked a little and I was thinking he was having the slightest of liking to me since he kept looking my way and stuff, but I could have been wrong.       Now that was a year (or two now since its a new year) since then, and when i started school in august i saw he was in my class! I didn't like him then, but I started growing a crush on him.      Then when I knew I liked him, his friends (not very loyal obviously) came and told me and asked me for him. But he didn't know they did until one day he heard one of his friends ask me (i kept telling his friends no, since i don't like it when a friend asks for their friend...total turn off for me...lol) and he got sorta ticked. Then he just sighed and asked me himself, and i said no..... Yeah I know I was stupid. But I honestly was scared...for what? I have no idea.      So I have this friend, people confuse her, and I together because we look a like, same with my crush so we call each other triplets for fun since he's like a brother. Like seriously. Don't laugh. haha. Anyways, so my friend one day told me on the phone that they were passing notes and stuff and in the note she said that she was sorry i said no, and told me he said it was fine and asked her out....      Yeah. She said no. But then I was told that he had a gf after that... I saw him too so i knew she wasn't lying.       Gosh I'm so confused. But now he broke up with the gf and i think he is liking me again cause now he wants my attention again and all that stuff. He makes me laugh too =]      I mean I like him....but then again I don't...       Am I crazy or just being stupid?      What do you think I should do?
20090128201628AABCeb2	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do you ask a girl out?	I'm a 17 year old guy and i've fallen in love with my friend. I fell in love with her the second i saw her 3 years ago. She is the most beautiful girl I've ever seen and she's really smart. Whenever I see her I get weak at the knees & get butterflies in my stomach. She takes my breath away and whenever i see her i feel like i have to use all my strength to keep myself from kissing her. I lose all rational thought when I see her. We're in math class together and i can't keep my eyes off of her. Seeing her is the best part of my day. I've tried to ask her out but i freeze up every time. I've tried to ask her out everyday for the last 3 years. I've even tried doing it over the phone but I just freeze up when I try to ask her. I'm trying so hard to ask her but I just can't do it and its driving me crazy. She would be the perfect girlfriend/wife. I love everything about her & when ever i see her i always get lost in her eyes. I just cant resist that look in her eyes. and it so cute when she plays with her hair. I think she might like me but i'm not sure she keeps telling me that i'm really smart and she tells all of her friends and her parents that too. and sometimes she teases me and she just asked me if i would come to her soccer games. and we've been studying together every week for math. and she said that she likes how i'm always there for her. I really want to be with her. I would b a good bf. I would adore her and shower her with kisses all the time. Her kiss has to be like heaven. I've fallen in love with her and I want to marry her. My life would be perfect if i had her. Meeting her was the best thing that has ever happened to me. I think about her day & night and i keep daydreaming about her in class. not being able to ask her out is driving me crazy. And whats even worse is that she is going out of state for college. I know I have to ask her but I can't get the words to come out. Not knowing if she wants me is unbearable but I can't get myself to just ask her. I just can't stop thinking about her. I know that she is my true love and soul mate I just know it. I have to have her. I wish she knew how much I love her. It's just so hard to ask her out and I need to know how. How do you ask a girl out?

20090128201421AAb3gR7	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Situation getting ugly?	my husband used to share every little things about his dealing with the ex-wife because they have children. i understand that, but lately I notice that my husband is not sharing things anymore  and is giving more than enough support to the ex-wife ...his reasoning is,  he is doing this for the kids. helping the kids is fine with me but to act as her confidante is another thing.  Does he need to do that to still be there for her for the sake of the childen even though they are already divorced and we are already married? does he wants to show  that he still cares for her (again for the sake of kids) and thought that i will not notice it since i'm showing to much understanding on the situation?  Are divorced men really think  this way or should act like that? Should i be jealous or am over thinking things? Don't you think that he is being unfair? what should you do if you are in this situation?

20090128200745AAN61hu	Family & Relationships;Friends	My friend has a very big crush on..History class (and i'm not talking about our teacher)?	Since my friend started grade 9 she's been completely inlove with hisotry class anything pre 2000. I mean, she was always into the 80's and stuff but now she spends tons of extra time doing grade 10 (we're rgade 9) history assignements for fun and watching the Grate Gadspe.    We go to the oldest Highschool in Toronto so there are all these old photos, colages, and invitations framed up on one of the walls when we passed by them she started getting oddly excited about how old they were she kept raving on and on about how old our shcool was and how cool it was that people who'd served in the first world war had gone to school here and all these different things.    During fourth period she randomly walks out of the classroom and i find her just reading (smiling as she does) the old frames-she's obviously read them all about 50 times each.    she's a chearleader, a party girl, probably one of the prettiest girls at school she wears all american apparel, has a senior boyfriend and a monroe piercing. I mean is this weird?    The thing that worries me is that if feel like she isn't happy when she isn't around those things, like.. she feels as if she should have been born in those times and now a part of her is missing because she's stuck in the 24th century. How can i make her feel better?

All the time its pathetic. Even at my job i'll be like thinking of naked girls while working.

20090128202146AAuOqbU	Family & Relationships;Friends	My friend opened my UPS package after being told not to...?	My friend came over to babysit and there was a package on my front porch. She had my daughter call me at work to ask if it was ok that she open it, to which I said no. When I got home, I saw that my friend had opened it anyway. It was a gift so I was really ticked off. She pretty much said sorry... and that I shouldn't sweat the small stuff. Why ask my permission if she was going to do it anyway? It could have easily been a gift for her or for my daughter that was there and the surprise would have been ruined. Who is right?

20090128195511AAlzaMm	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My boyfriend slapped me?	I've been with my boyfriend for 4 1/2 years. Our relationship has always been up and down. He has cheated on me couple of times and I've forgiven him. Just last Sep we broke up and got back together in late Nov. Things were going good trying to work things out and just on Friday we got into a very bad fight and he slapped me. I was in shocked and I still can't believe that happened since the reason of the argument was not worth it. He tried calling me the day after but he was very hungry and left me some nasty messages. I think he does feel bad but he blames me for it. He has apologize but I don't think he really feels bad. He also told his Mom which I am closed to and she won't call me back. I am really sad about the situation. He is telling he can't be with me anymore because of all this. He cares for me but he can't. I truly love this guy and I'm welling to go to therapy but he does not want to. I don't know what else I can do. I told him that I would be able to forgive him and try to move on, but he doesn't seem like he wants to be with me. I'm confused! I thought he was supposed to keep calling and apologizing but he is not doing it.

20090128200421AA5wOKk	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Is avoidance the best solution?	Ok, so this random guy went up and said hi to me on the 2nd week of school. Then we talked a bit more and such and I guess we became good friends? After some time, he'd always follow me to my locker or escort me to classes. He always pays attention to me... whether it'd be my facial expressions or what I'm looking at. He always compliments me and always look into my eyes when we're talking. I've been freaked out by what he's been doing so I've tried to avoid him. Like if he's free during this time and so am I, I would head to the library and study there. Or, I'd stay in the bathroom for a bit, walk around and talk to my friends. I even told him that I just wanted us to be friends and nothing more but I think he didn't take it the way I thought he would. He would always mention that he never met anyone like me and would go on to ask if we should see a movie together or something. Lots of ppl care for me and notice weird things that are going on in my life. Every single person who has ever showed concern said I should avoid the guy before things get worse. I'm doing my best to avoid him and because I met someone like him, I want to transfer schools.

20090128202149AAHSb3S	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I need some advice for my ex ?	I posted this question once but didn't get the answer i was looking for ..      Okay , so my exboyfriend is confused on what he wants .. he keeps coming back after he realizes that I'm the best girl for him and he'll never find a girl like me. & he when he comes back he tells me if I was the girl I was when he first met me he would be so happy and I'm actually starting to be who I was I'm more happier and I'm not talking to my ex as much , but I feel like its a competition like whoever calls or texts first loses ya know ? I feel like I want to be more confident and less needy and I think I'm doing a good job at it but I don't know I feel like he doesn't care and he hasn't called or texted. should I keep on going the way I'm going and show him I don't need him ? or what ? shouldn't this be driving him crazy ?      & I know most of you will be like forget it but I don't like to leave things and me and him love eachother a lot I've just been so worried lately about everything and I haven't been myself that's why we broke up in the beginning ...
20090128202148AAo7H2y	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Saying goodbye to someone you love?	K well my and my gf were forced to break up in the summer cause her parents found out we had sex. Yeah short we havent seen eachother since and its really hard. I can tell she has feelings for me, but she says shes just doing what her parents want her to. Which sucks but i can see why. We didnt have a normal break up, her parents ripped us apart after being friends for almsot 3 years, and a couple for one.    Its been over 8 months, and i still have feelings for her. I honestly dont know what to do. no matter what i try, my feelings for her dont go away. Even with no talking, its seems to be worse. I'm really lost on what to do and where to go from here. i'm 18 but she still has till may till she turns 18 so her parents are using that. Everything happened when we were both 17.    K so, i feel we have a loose end. We never got to say goodbye in person. She said her parents gave her a chance to, but she said it woudl hurt to much to have to say goodbye. But because of that, i cant loose her. I've tried to tell her that if she meets me one time, i'll never bother her again, but everytime she says she cant cause she doesnt want to get in trouble even thought she talks to me everyday through text and AIM. So i dont get it. But there cant be closure till we meet in person, talk and say goodbye. But she just wont do it.    Can i get any advice? Idk what to ask but whatever you feel right to say? And dont say just forget her and move on, cause that isnt gunna work. I've tried for 8 months

20090128193339AAmca0S	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does she like me? Or is she pretending? Not sure with this one...?	So there's this girl I know from college. Was out with her on the weekend. I like her quite a bit. Pretty sure she likes me. We have a bit in common. She's always smiling around me. Even when she doesn't really have to. She broke up with her ex because he had no control with his life because his parents ran his life. When I said I didn't, she seemed pretty happy about that. She always seems to have a good time around me. But one thing bothers me. When I try and talk to her on msn, or texting, she doesn't reply back. Or when she does, its very short and then she logs off or never replies back. Could it be she's just busy and doesn't want to talk on msn or text? Or is she annoyed and doesn't want to talk to me? I'm confused as I said. How should I go about by this?

I still liked him, I just couldn't really date anyone at the time..       Well, now he always acts weird around me,       Like, he will say me name, then grab my hand.      Or, he'll start talking about this girl he likes..      Then, he'll randomly tickle me..      And, when he walks off, and I am sitting down..he will play with my hair..      And, then he tried the "move" on me, but then he saw my expression..       So, he quickly explained that he was joking..      Also, sometimes he will randomly hug mee.       Well, I was wondering what does it mean?       I mean, it always seems like he likes me, but he tells me he likes this girl named Kendall..       Okay, thanks :)       *P.S. I don't really like him anymore, I like this guy named Noah.       I was wondering if there was a casual way to bring up Noah, without being obvious..

I pray that she will one day treat me with the same kind of respect that I treat her! My exhubby left me for the woman he is with now. I dont hold her responsible for his actions.

20090128202818AAYIyeZ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What do teenage guys think of girls with love handles?	I'm hourglass shaped so I have some love handles. They are small and you can only see them on the sides (not the back or my stomach.) They seem bigger when I wear jeans and it makes me a bit uncomfortable, especially if my shirt is shorter. I am taller than a lot of girls my age, and my weight varies but is normally around the 130s (the healthy range) and my waist is very thin which makes my hips look even bigger... Do teen guys care if a girl has love handles? It seems like all the guys at my school go for either the bone thin girls, or the crazy athletic ones with almost no figure.

I mean really, if i read one more question about some teen not knowing who to take to the dance, im gonna hit the fan. I think when you enter the Dating & Relationshi category, and before you enter you should pick your age, ex. 13-18, 20-30, 40+. Or you could enter and view it like normal. But i feel we need some categorization in this section of Y answers. That would make it a lot more easier. Don't you guys think, whats your opinion?

When I tell my parents I need cloth....... they take me to hollister, ae and a&f. When I want to have a ps3, my parents says they are too expensive and not good for you. I am like why you pay so much for piano, tutors lessons and pay for the trips in basketball teams but not a game system. Plus my parents are so noisy when it comes to making friends. They invite them over, and if they look like thugs bye bye the go. Even when it comes to girlfriends, for example a girl happened to have belly ring and my parents are like she is not well mannered enough. I am so over the fact that my parents are so strict, so WAY TOO WELL MANNERED. I want to have a family that likes to party.

I wrote on my binder the following from Pink's song, 'Bad Influence'      "I can't help it I like to party, it's genetic!   It's electrifying, wind me up and watch me go   Where she stops, nobody knows   A good excuse to be a bad influence on you"      My assistant Principal saw my binder and took it away, papers and all, saying it was 'Highly Inappropriate'   I didn't think it was that bad, I mean the rest of the song describes sex and boozing, and I made it a point not to put that on there. Now he's threatening me with 3 days in school suspension. I have NEVER had ISS or out of School suspension, and never gotten in major trouble, yet he continues to say my records say I've had this 'obscenity' problem before. Do I fight it or take the ISS?

20090128193444AAig5lR	Family & Relationships;Friends	Adult friend trouble?	I shared intimate details of my life with a friend ie) bad arguments with my husband-verbal abuse.  I told her my husband never did this in front of others.  She decided she and her kids should not come to my home anymore.  I was so devestated because I would never allow them to enter into a dangerous situation and I told her this.  She missed my daughter's birthday because she wouldnt come here.  All my other friends knew of the fighting and they remained my friends and didn't feel they were in danger.  I couldn't conceive of a 1/2 hearted limited friendship with her.  I told her I wanted to respect her opinions  but she has been overprotective with her kids in the past (she doesn't let the watch disney movies, play with barbies, paint her nails) I told her I think this may be influencing her opinion and it was irrational.  She insulted me and we ended our friendship.  I feel she violated my trust because I shared my personal life and she used it against me.  I don't understand how she could feel danger if my husband yells at me in the privacy of my home??  Who is to blame?

20090128194351AAR7JCD	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What do you think the possibilities are that an ex couple wanting to have sex again that feelings might linger?	I was with my ex fiance for a year and a half  ALOT of things went down that turned a good thing majorly bad as in I was pregnant and we was happy, we was going to get married and all was good  till I lost the baby.... Then things went downhill from there as in I hit major depression and we argued badly.. Sometimes we could go weeks and not argue, but when we did things was said that still hurt the other...So he broke it off with me and at the time was really pissy about it  and told me to move on with my life and all that. Then out of the blue he emailed me at the first of January apologizing for hurting me. We talked on the phone then for 5 hours and was laughing and cutting up like we used to do before all the arguing started... Then 2 weeks passed and he emailed me again and wanted me to call him cause he heard my mom was hurt in a accident. Out of the blue in both conversations sex has came up and we both agreed that that was ONE thing we never was bad at... so night before last when we was talking for 2 hours we decided that over this weekend we would hook up for sex... What are the possibilites that there is still feelings there on his side as well.. I mean he could have sex with anyone and im not easy .. so it wasn't that....Does it seem like there may be more there then just hey I wanna hook up for a lil romp with him contacting me 2 times now???

SO TODAY, the girl that i talked crap about last year and we were cool after (and i thought we were friends), decides its funny to tell me that we have assigned seats so that I cant sit near her and my other friends. I knew it was total bullshit. so, i decided to brush it off.      so then i get to lunch, and she thinks shes SO cool and says "oh my god, why are you here?! i dont want to be near you today. you're so annoying, go and leave me and my friends alone." even though theyre MY friends too, but her 2 bestfriends were at that lunch. But everyone says nothing because they don't want to get involved. so i said "Who the hell do you think you are. Yeah, because i see everyone else backing you up right. If i were i'd shut the hell up" and she said "Do you hear something? Sounds like a cow."

20090128195926AAgXDTp	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should I do? I really like him but he's my best friends ex!!?	Ok so there is this guy that I reallly like but no one knows that I like him because it would be a disaster if they did. Why?? Because he's one of my good friends ex. They have been on again off again for about the last 6 months and she always comes to me for advice. They look great together as a couple but I just cant stand it. Whenever I see him in the halls at school I just want to run up to him and admit how much I like him but it would be a total disaster. Yet I feel kind of tortured because I'm giving my friend advice on how to keep him when I really want to be with him. I'm in high school (oh the drama yes I know) but what should I do?? She really trusts me and I could never hurt her but whenever I'm next to him I feel like we would be perfect for eachother, like 2 puzzle pieces. What should I do?

20090128200236AAc2UhO	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I like a girl alot but not sure she likes me back. Help?	We are at least friends I know that but I'd like to ask her out but I'm afraid of rejection! So here is what our friendshipish type thing goes.         We've known eachother for about 6 months. She was new at school about 2 years ago. My crush started when I got to know her better, she's really nice we have similar personalities we both love to laugh at ourselves and on top of all of this she is extremely pretty. We write emails and text eachother everyday since Christmas Break when she willingly gave me her email adress. We would have gone to see "Twilight" together as friends but her parents didn't know me then so we didn't plus she was sick. I burn her CDs from time to time to because we swap music. I really like her and this isn't because I want to be popular or anything (I haven't been for a long time) but Im in 8th grade and want to tell her I really like her before highschool because we are going to 2 different ones. But I'm extremely scared of rejection because my friend asked her out and got rejected. (He was kinda a creeper though) We both laugh alot when we are around eachother and I get along with all her friends.  Anyway I'd love to have some insight from a girl, If possible! But even a boys advice would be great! Thanks

Not once did I ever trust anyone up to that point and decided to put my heart in his hands. Granted It ended but now I'm positive I'm with my second love. And I've always loved him but now feel even more emotional and vunerable. It's crazy to rap my mind around this feeling...

I'm not like having a serious problem or anything its just   I'm Bisexual, and so is my best friend, lets call her Jill.   So me and Jill are went to the movies with my best guy friend who has been friends with me since about before kindergarten. So, This guy was probably up there in my most trusted section of my mind, It was also really awkward because 2 years before there was this rumor going around that he liked me! even his best friend told me! and you know it took me awhile to figure out that I liked him. So at the end, we told him about our orientation, he told us we were mistaken, and that was that. But this year, he started bullying Jill and calling her horrible names because she sat next to him in a couple of his classes. He's stopped (new seating chart...) But he isn't the person who would do that! Well I don't know him anymore. Now that we're in the same classes he just ignores me. Thats all fine and dandy but we had a lot in common and I really miss our friendship now...   I have no idea what to do!!

20090128201411AAgAm2A	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is it better to confront him?	ok this is going to take a big explanation! basically have been seeing this guy for a while he was really super keen to begin with, asked me to his xmas party after our first date, to his family birthday dinner after that and called me regulary. He gave me a beautiful bracelet for my bday and then a card that said "will you be mine".. i didnt ever end up responding to the card simply because i didnt read it properly at the time. but basically after that we both went on seperate three week holidays and he called me exactly every second night as well as messages.       but since ive been back he hasnt made any effort to see me? Ive called him and message him and he's responded and called me back but hasnt initiated much. i just have a really bad feeling about it and think i should ring him ask to see him and then just ask him whats going on. that way if im right i wont make a fool of myself continuing to pursue him and if im wrong i can stop stressing.?       will this make me seem crazy? do you think this is an ok idea? basically what i want to say is just something like "I just want to know waht you want and where i stand with you"? i think this is a fair enough question? what do you think?

20090128201336AALTwdM	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	He calls me a complainer and acts like I'M the ****** but he stares at me all day...?	Let's try to make this short as I have to get back to midterms.    The one thing he seems to always point out to anyone he's talking to about me [and whenever I'm near the perimeter] is that I complain a lot. Which can be true sometimes, but since he first started pointing that out, it was like "EPIPHANY" and so I started to think more optimistically...drawing away from whining.    Anyways, since that first time, all he does during clas is stare, stare, stare. Yeah, he's cute...but he can be kinda obnoxious sometimes...but he is nice if you get to know him. But whenever I'm, say, checking the clock, I can see him staring right at me the entire time.    Anyways, I guess my question is, is he attracted to me or something? I don't know...10 points anyways to whoever decides to answer this =]

20090128201913AA0g9zk	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Question about how to tell him to wait for, well, sex.?	Okay, I am a freshman and my boyfriend is a junior.   We've been going out ever since I met him at the beginning of the school year. We've made out and the usual bf/gf stuff,  but lately he has been talking about how it will be our first time, if you know what I mean.      Just to let you know, I really want to save myself for marriage, but I don't know how to break it to him.      And that sucks because I don't know what's going to happen to us after he graduates next year :(      And I asked him, and he doesn't either- I think it's too far ahead to decide on now...      At points he is so romantic that I say to myself 'No no no I really DO want to lose it to this guy.' but then I think about it again later on and say to myself 'but what if he just leaves and it was lost to a jerk' [not that I don't trust him, but people talk like that happens a lot...]    and then I think of how wonderful it would be to have my first time with the guy who marries me. That would be beautiful, and I'm sure he'd be happy not worrying about who I've slept with...         So how do I tell him? I love our relationship so badly, but I'm afraid telling him 'I want to wait for marriage.' will scare him off, like I asking him HIMSELF to marry me. . .      Help!     >.<

I used to talk to this black dude alot..we hung out..whatever..anyways, we got to talking about sex..blah blah..Well, he informs me that there is no way he is going down..not even in the shower. No matter how clean the girl is. I thought maybe he was a fluke. Nope. He proceeds to inform me that most black dudes won't do this. Well, I did my own asking around. And sure enough..Most don't..Any thoughts on why? This is strange! I can't imagine my man expecting me to do the dirty on him and him not giving me some lickin'..wtf? Any ideas?
20090128205705AAJ2iA4	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I just don't know what to do....10 points.?	I know I love my boyfriend but I don't feel love for him anymore........we have been together now for 9 months and I have been crazy for him since we met. I never felt so much for someone as I had for him, but now we have gone through a lot of bad times and even more since we moved in together back in October 2008. And especially he is not taking care of himself (like he doesn't care about his looks anymore) He is Korean and he is tall 6ft and he has gained 20lb...which whatever is fine..but he doesn't get a hair cut often and he doesn't shave and his facial hair doesn't grow in nice. But thats not the reason I don't love him obviously....but I just don't feel that attracted to him anymore as well. He has made me cry a lot in this relationship and has called me some mean names and stuff...like every relationship but I think I have been hurt too much by him (emotionally) that I lost everything for him now.I am in the bedroom now because i can't stand to sit next to him in the living room...its that bad!!! What am I going to do??? Like I know if we break up and he leaves I will miss him and feel sad and lonely...but right now..I can't be with him...HELP!!!!      Sorry sooo long...

20090128202916AAmFs7X	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does this girl like me?	Ok so, I met this girl about a year ago while I was in 7th grade and she was in 8th. I talked to her on the bus and around the school but that was about it because we didn't have any class together. Over the summer I asked her out and she said no. Now I got rid of my glasses, got a better hairstyle, and dress a lot better. Now she's 15 and I'm 14. Occasionally we see a movie together and on Sunday she asked me if I wanted to see one and I said yes. She changed her mind and said if I wanted to come to her house and hang out and watch a movie and I said yes. While we were watching the movie, we sat on a couch and over time just got closer and closer until her head was on my shoulders and my elbow was touching her breast and she didn't do anything about it. So after I had dinner with her parents and hung out for a little bit more I left. Also during the movie, she got a text from a guy saying 'I luv ya'. I'm also wondering if she has a boyfriend or if he's just a friend. Does she like me?
20090128203915AAmEtcI	Family & Relationships;Friends	What if  your ex-best friend keeps on trying to be friends with you?	She still thinks I'm her best friend I'm trying to avoid her but she still keeps on following me. I mean she's so mean and stuff, whenever I start talking or hanging out with her other ex-friend she always kept glaring at us(which is starting to creep me out) She's totally not the kind of friend I'm looking for, she doesn't even take care of herself, she doesn't brush her hair, she stuffs things(food, loose paper, you name it) in her desk and me and this other friend of us cleans it. She's nice the first time but when you get deep deep down her, she's different. Now I'm REALLY REALLY, trying avoid her, but she keeps on coming back like two different poles of a magnet. What should I do know?

20090128205710AADQPJj	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do you ask a girl out?	I'm a 17 year old guy and i've fallen in love with my friend. I fell in love with her the second i saw her 3 years ago. She is the most beautiful girl I've ever seen and she's really smart. Whenever I see her I get weak at the knees & get butterflies in my stomach. She takes my breath away and whenever i see her i feel like i have to use all my strength to keep myself from kissing her. I lose all rational thought when I see her. We're in math class together and i can't keep my eyes off of her. Seeing her is the best part of my day. I've tried to ask her out but i freeze up every time. I've tried to ask her out everyday for the last 3 years. I've even tried doing it over the phone but I just freeze up when I try to ask her. I'm trying so hard to ask her but I just can't do it and its driving me crazy. She would be the perfect girlfriend/wife. I love everything about her & when ever i see her i always get lost in her eyes. I just cant resist that look in her eyes. and it so cute when she plays with her hair. I think she might like me but i'm not sure she keeps telling me that i'm really smart and she tells all of her friends and her parents that too. and sometimes she teases me and she just asked me if i would come to her soccer games. and we've been studying together every week for math. and she said that she likes how i'm always there for her. I really want to be with her. I would b a good bf. I would adore her and shower her with kisses all the time. Her kiss has to be like heaven. I've fallen in love with her and I want to marry her. My life would be perfect if i had her. Meeting her was the best thing that has ever happened to me. I think about her day & night and i keep daydreaming about her in class. not being able to ask her out is driving me crazy. And whats even worse is that she is going out of state for college. I know I have to ask her but I can't get the words to come out. Not knowing if she wants me is unbearable but I can't get myself to just ask her. I just can't stop thinking about her. I know that she is my true love and soul mate I just know it. I have to have her. I wish she knew how much I love her. It's just so hard to ask her out and I need to know how. How do you ask a girl out?

20090128203429AAaR5nD	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Does sampling caterers and bakers food cost money?	I know this might sound like a really stupid question... but I can't find the answer! When you are planning a wedding and you need to sample the caterer's food and the baker's wedding cakes, do you have to pay money to do this, or is it free? I could see it either way because if you don't pay to sample then that's like getting free food if you don't choose them, but if you do pay then THEY would be making YOU pay in order to try to get YOUR business, so that doesn't make sense to me! Help please! Thanks!

20090128203244AARBAmH	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What is Love? How does it feel?	I just recently got out of a 3 year relationship. I knew him since I was born so him and I grew up together. He recently died which caused our [breakup] or else we would still be together. He died September 11, 2008. I still cry myself to sleep every single night. My friend's all tell me it's time to move on and quit crying and lately I've felt this is true. That Jeff [My deceased boyfriend] would want me to move on, He would want me to be happy again. Right? So why do I feel so bad? I've dated 3 guys since his death and every single guy I have broke up with for the same reason. I start comparing them to Jeff and I break up with them because their just not JEFF!!! I was in love with Jeff I still am in love with Jeff and I know he'll always hold that space in my heart that no one will ever be able to fill. Well; I just recently got a new boyfriend on the 22nd of January thing's are going great right now but; the last 3 only lasted about a week. I am afraid I will start pushing him away as well and he really cares for me, I care a lot for him, and he treats me with respect. I don't want to start remembering the past and comparing him to Jeff as well and end up breaking his heart. Telling me to move on from Jeff won't work I will always love him. But; lately I can't even really say I love my family it's like I lost the meaning of love like the only person I love is Jeff i'm not even sure I love myself. I've completely lost thought of who I am or where I stand in life. I don't want to feel this. I wan't to be happy again but; it's just too hard. I miss him so much :'( I cry every single night which puts me to sleep, I wake up every morning trying to call his cell phone to tell him Good Morning and tell him how much I love him but; I get his voicemail, I go around my house searching for him and after not finding him realizing he is actually gone that it is not at all a dream. I wan't it to be dream! I wish it was a dream. What is all this I am feeling. I don't want to hurt! I want to be okay but; I have also lost 2 brother's and a best friend so this is very difficult on me. Please help!!!

20090128205540AABK3QA	Family & Relationships;Friends	Should I go to the Valentine's Ball if I'm the ugly step sister?	Okay, so the story goes like this. (I'm going to avoid using real names)      Usually, a group of four of us hang out all the time, there's 2 girls and 2 guys. A couple of weeks ago, we decided that we'd go to this Valentine's Ball, we paid and everything. It's really formal with an orchestra and everything, no DJ.      It was assumed that everyone would dance with each other as friends.   But, everyone knew that Boy A liked Girl A. He asked her to the dance, and she said no, it's a group. Then, Boy B confessed that he really likes Girl A and wants to take her to the dance too. She said maybe.       Now, I happen to be Girl B. I feel like they're both going to try to win Girl A, and I'm the pity dance partner/punishment for the guy who loses. It's like they feel bad that no one wants to dance with me, so they will. I told them that I don't need pity and I'm not charity, they shouldn't feel obliged to have to dance with me. I agreed to pay for the ticket and they can use it to take some other girl, because there's no way I'm going.      They're all telling me I'm over reacting and that everything will be fine. They also said to stop being jealous.      I don't know if I did overreact. I really don't want to go and have them feel bad for me and dance with me because of that. So what would you guys do? Would you go or not? What would you say to them?      Thanks.

I have plenty of reasons why I want to, but I want to know if there is anything else that I should to do convince the judge that I am better of with my mom.

20090128202931AAr5IR8	Family & Relationships;Friends	I've Lost All My Friends?	I just lost 2 of the people who i used to think were some of my best friends. I really tried being cool with them. One of my friends "Steve" and I used to be pretty close. At least I thought. But he was in a little clique and I could never fit in. No matter if i changed my personality, the way that I dressed, acted, everything. I invited him places, I really thought we were cool. Now on our last day of class together, I got tired because he always ignored me when he was with his other friends. Even though I thought I was friends with them too. And the last thing he said to me was an insult about my weight which pissed me off even more. And now that I'm just starting to get over it. My friend "Jon" stopped being friends with me too. He just deleted me off his myspace. So I thought It mightve been a mistake, and so i tried to add him again, but he denied it. I just asked him why, but i havent gotten a reply yet.

20090128202958AAGCcHD	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What do i, i'm clueless?	so i have been single for a while and so far i've been okay with it. i'm in college full time and i work and i don't really have time to think about dating. but there is this one boy in our group of friends who is more of an acquaintance and ive always had a silly crush on him. he's really good friends with my roommate and all of our mutual friends, so hes here a lot, but i never thought he really noticed me. well yesterday he texted her asking if she thought it would be okay to ask me out on a date on friday...and she told him yes but i'm not supposed to know until he asks me. my question after this whole deal is, do you think if i go out on a date with him it's going to make hanging out in our usual large group awkward? should i go or just tell him i would rather be friends? it's stupid but i've only been with 2 guys and both were really long and dramatically involved relationships that lasted years, and i never went on a "date" with either of them so i'm not really sure what to expect.

20090128203153AAwqXEc	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I start talking to this pretty girl in class?	Okay so there is this pretty girl in my class that I am interested in & I've never met or spoken to her but I would like to meet her & get to know her.  But I'm too shy to say anything & I wouldn't know what to say.  She once complimented me once & said I was cute but I had to be shy & just say "thanks" with a smile.  How can I talk to this girl & start conversation?
20090128203202AA7ZFyL	Family & Relationships;Friends	Ok this is a friend help question that I need answered?	Ok. Well here's the story. When I was in elementary school I was with a group of friends I usually hanged out with. But now in middle school my friends are starting to change (not saying i'm not) and getting new friends. I'd say that majority of my friends from my old school were unpopular, antisocial, and even sometimes called themselves nerds. The same goes for my cousin who is the same age and goes to the same school. She started getting new friends and then when one of her old friends talked to her she thought my cousin was too cool for her. I have to admit the preps at middle school are a ot better than the preps at my old school and i would like to hang out with them. They like me too as even though I hang out with the unpopular people I am actually in their  really cool. However, I don't hang out with them because I don't want to become to cool for my friends or make my friends feel forgotten and I feel like if I do hang out with the more popular people i might do both. What should I do? I want to socialize and make more friends but i want to keep my old ones too. What should I do to do both?

20090128203308AAUhc1i	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Did I Give Off The Wrong Impression To The Guy I Like?	Today after class with the guy I like he was taping his poster up on the wall (we had to do them as projects, all of the class had already left the room except him, the teacher, and I). The tape is on the teacher's desk right next to mine, and he was setting it up on my desk, since I sit close to her desk. He was doing the poster on top of my book, and I stood there for a minute or two waiting for him to finish so I could pick up my book and leave. Eventually I just asked if I could grab it, and he moved his stuff out of my way. I said thanks, smiled, and left. Also, earlier into the class he said the drawing on my poster was really good.      Was he doing this on purpose to keep me there longer, or did he not notice? And is this a big deal (giving off the wrong impression) or am I just obsessing over this too much?
20090128203324AADgZV1	Family & Relationships;Friends	What Should They Do? Please Answer?	Okay There ia a Group of Friends. Their names are Daise, Elion , Alexis , Sam , and Sabrina. Sam and Daise were Realy Great Close Friends . but for some reson they all of a sudden got distant , So Sabrina And Sam just hanged out togehter. Later When ppl were geting called out to adition for solo's in a musical , Sam walked in on Alexis who was trying out for the part she wanted , but it didn't bother her. Once Sam was done she met up with Daise and Alexis in art while Elion and Sabrina were trying out. Sam said "Hey Alexis so your trying out for Alice? I thought you were gonna try out for Rosa-" Alexis Cut her off and said "I did try out for Rosa but the teacher made me try out for Alice-" Sam new what she ment. Sabrina & Elion also wanted that part but she didn't want to tell them because she was afraid they might get mad. Then Dasie came up and told Alexis not to tell Sam becuase ever sinc what happend Sohpmore year during the cristmas party , Sam promissed Daise to keep a secret that Sabrina wanted to know but Sam also promissed Sabrina that she would tell her. Daise also said that Sam almost ruined their friendship but truthfully Sabrina didn't realy like Daise. Daise never forgave Sam for that , and they didn't talk for a while. (Skips to persent)  Now Daise is talking to Sam again but still has that distance felling but she told Sam that she's not Alexis's friend anymore becuase she hates her new boyfriend ,and Daise & Alexis have been really good friends from the start. Alexis told Sam that she won't break up with her boyfriend because she loves him , so Sam and Alexis are wondering what to do. So please please help they are really sad.      p.s   on Sam's website , when Daise was mad at her , she commented realy mean and rudely and she has done this to Sam a cuople of times so what should they do?

What Love To Give             What love to give      To the one this heart seeks      So great is the love that it rivals      The bodily pains I live thru every day      Few realize that ungiven love is a daily agony      That no medicine can touch or heal      For this love is in the lonely lonely heart      Wanting to give, but none to receive      The lonely heart with limited unknown days      Knowing the so painful unrequited love       Will be borne until a lonely accepted death      That is my future until that fateful day      The day when all of my pains finally end.
20090128203917AAyZKxA	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I have a bad problem. ?	I am 14 years old. I am very smart, talented, outgoing, charming and clever. I can't seem to show it, though. I am always clumsy, I'm getting acne, and I say stupid things all the time. None of the other kids are having the same problems as me.   The real problem though, is, that I have too much passion. I need a girlfriend so I have somebody to tell these things to, and to let out my passion for. It just builds up and I can't stop thinking about girls, but because of how clumsy and stupid I am sometimes, none of the girls at school pay any attention. I like this girl who is absolutely disgusted by me, and tries to avoid me by all means.    I know there's going to be some nasty comments, and I am already feeling terrible about this, so your job is done already. And I'll have you know that you don't need to post a bad comment because I already know you have no life and live just to try and make yourself feel bigger. Before you try to leave nasty comments here, ask around about your own stupid problems.    But I seriously need some sort of guidance, some kind word or something to do to lift my spirits. Anything?
20090128203939AAWQAaH	Family & Relationships;Family	Should I avoid my family?	I'm 22 years old. I live across the country from my parents now. I came out that I was gay to them when I was 16. They were very much in the Mormon (LDS) church. They shunned me for being gay, and completely spoke down to me after that point. Before I came out, I was their perfect child. They then kicked me out for being gay when I was 17. It's been 5 years. I've went back from crying, to having a ragging fury towards them. Now, I'm over it. I'm used to not having a family. Well my mother and I have been talking off an on for the last year, every like 3 months. SHE never asks how I'm doing, only talks about what's going on with her and everything. One email she said. "She was sorry she treated me so badly" So I think she realizes that she really did treat me like dirt. BUT, she still has strong convictions with the church who related gay people with rapists and murders.       So she wants to "patch" things up. My thoughts are, I was treated like dirt for 2 years, and thrown out of my house for being gay. And understand. I NEVER once threw in their face that I was gay, never talked about boys, or did really any "gay" things. So there was no reason to attack me.    And she has now admitted treating me badly but still doesn't accept me.    Should I really try and patch things up? I dunno. I just feel like if I did, I would still hurt because she still thinks i"m a horrible person and would never accept my bf. Also, I feel like it would be just a matter of time before shed want to throw religion in my face. Also its been 5 years.... 1/4 of my life, that I haven't had them. I feel like getting back with the family would have no plus, cause they would still not recognize me for who I am inside. Just judge me for what I do in the privacy of my own bedroom.       What are your thoughts?      I would love to hear from both sides, religious, or other gay people.    People who think I should and people who think I shouldn't.       Thanks!!!
