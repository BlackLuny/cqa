20081209055149AAUOtqI	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Toddlers and sharing – Advice please?!?	My son is 2 yrs old and has just been moved up to the 2 yr old room at daycare over the past few weeks. Let’s just say that’s he’s struggling with the concept of having “rules” and structure compared to his 1 yr old room which was basically free play.       I spoke with his new teacher yesterday and let me first say that I’m well aware this will take time for him to adjust. But I’d like to try to do things at home or do something that can maybe help my son adapt a bit better.       Twice a day the kids do table time. They take a basket of toys and put them in the center of the table and they all SHARE the toys together. Well my son wasn’t too happy with that sharing concept and threw a total hissy because he had to share. (I can only imagine what the older kids must think when he goes crazy! LOL!)       My son is an only child at home so he doesn’t really have to share with anyone there. We know other couples with some kids, but not really any that are the same age as our son. There is one little boy but he’s not in daycare and he stays with his grandmother so he’s not exactly one that’s had practice in the sharing department either.       What can I do to help with teaching how to share? What types of things do you say to your child when trying to explain what sharing is all about? Also, any activities or lessons we could do to help out would be appreciated too.       Thanks for your help!

20090309183547AAHXstm	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Other moms with milk intolerant children?	So I'm starting to think maybe my son is lactose intolerant, or has a milk protein allergy.   He was weaned onto whole milk at 10.5 months and had the yellow loose stools which I was told by the doctor was normal for the first 2 weeks or so while he got used to it. But he's now 13 months and still has the pale yellow stools and its not really formed, its usually all smushed up.   He doesn't have a rash or anything like that and never seems to be in pain. I've started giving him enfagrow for 12 months and up and he's now starting to get a little colour back, and his poop is looking normal. Now enfagrow does say on the package lactose free, but its made from whole milk powder. Is there a way a doctor could diagnose this through a blood test? I don't want to go in just for a guess from him. (My doctor is very good BTW)      From you moms that have children with an intolerance to lactose or milk protein, what were your child symptoms?

20090309182556AAqYSDZ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Spotting but no AF... Do you think Pregnant or AF is going to come?	Hi.  I did a post earlier today:    http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...       I have read how some people experience a pinkish/brownish spotting when their normal period usually happens (but then find out they are preg).     I was just wondering because I have never experienced this before with my periods…Sunday I woke up took a preg test = negative but then after I wiped there was a little pink/brown color on the tp so I thought okay Im going to start my period.  Throughout the day AF did not come and only a couple of times when I went to the bathroom and wiped there was a pink/brown color on the tp.  Today (Monday)  woke peed nothing so I wiped one more time to make sure and there was a little pink/brownish color on the tp so I put a liner on since I was going to work.  All day long NOTHING expect a couple of times when I went to the restroom there was very little when I wiped.     What do you think?   At one point today I had some blood when I wiped so I figured I really did start my period.  But the rest of the day no more red/blood just the pinkish color (very faint).        Normally when AF comes I bleed very lightly in the am and then start later or just start right away BUT never had two days of spotting when I use the restroom.       Any idea if this is just a strange month and it is my period or possibly pregnant?? Any one else have this happen?   Thank you very much for any input.

I have allergies which trigger me to have problems with my asthma. I know that I cannot oxygenate the baby if I cannot oxygenate myself. Low oxygen can have some pretty serious consequences on the fetus. Benadrly stops the allergy to dust which means I do not have asthma attacks. Benadryl is a category B drug did anyone take benadryl during pregnancy?

I also just took a pregnancy test about 3 days ago(negitive).   Could this discharge be a typical period sign or a pregnancy sign? I've read both but could someone fill me in on which way to go?
20090309182107AA5Iie5	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Help please so confused about weaning!?	My son is 10 months old now and my mum has been telling me to take him off formula and to start giving him cow's milk. The only problem here is that he is a bit lazy when it comes to feeding himself, i still give him two 8oz bottles and 1 6oz bottles a day but I feed it to him like a newborn. He has a sippy cup (with a straw) which he drinks water out of no problem but he really seems to struggle with the tipping the bottle up motion, and when I try to help him he just lets go and expects me to do it for him. I just feel really confused because I don't know how I am going to get him to drink 8oz of milk thru a sippy cup - he just seems to have a little bit then is off again. At this age is it still essential they receieve a certain amount of milk? He eats like a trooper so I guess I am not too concerned about him eating enough... I'm just toally confused about this milk/formula/sippy cup business!   Noah's mummy I hope u can help me here because I read your question the other day about Noah being almost completely transitioned to cows milk and I think he is just a little bit older then Jake (he was born May 08)

I might bore some people but I would like serious answers.I am the youngest of 6.Only me and my brother J have the same father (yes my family is a class act). I've been living with my oldest brother R and his wife for almost 5 years.They have raised me and I don't want to leave their home.For years they have had custody of me and recently they offered to adopt me to make sure I never leave.This is what I want.At first I thought I would change my last name for my brother R's last name.I grew up with my nephews and my niece,I sort of think of them as my younger siblings and I want to share their name.Plus,I hate my father's *** and I don't want to pass on his name along with his crappy genes.I told my brother J about this and he didn't like it.We have the same last name and now he feels offended by my idea of changing it.

(:      lol so tell me what you think of this <3      It’s time to go.   Time to leave.   Time to run.   And now you grieve.      And now I sit, at the dark kitchen table.   Wondering if I’ve done it again.   Wondering if I’ve cut myself short.   Wondering if I’ve lost a good friend.      But what were you to me?   Only a boy. A young, careless crush.   You were nothing of substance.   You didn’t care much.      Of course, I could be wrong. In fact, I    Very well may be. But I can’t be bothered with you.   I can barely be bothered with me.      You say that you “like me”. But what does that mean?   We try to be grown…but we’re still so na?ve.      Yes, it’s reached that hour, butterflies in my gut.   You open up, and I slam my door shut.      Couldn’t let you get too close, could I?   Couldn’t let you go too deep, could I?   No, for what would become of me, if we ever parted?   You’d be taking a piece of me with you. And I don’t think I can    Lose another piece of me. Soon, I will be nothing.      So for now we wait indefinitely. Now which road shall we take?   We sit at kitchen tables, and think of our mistakes.

20090309191538AAabwOK	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Flexeril and pregnancy?	Hi everyone. I was wondering what the most amount of flexeril you have taken for muscle spasms and/or sciatica during pregnancy. I am prescribed 5mg every 8 hours as needed. I am in a severe amount of pain, and wanted to know if it would be safe to take 2. I have put a call into my OB, but since its after hours who knows when they will call me back.       Im not asking for medical advice...just experiences! Thank you everyone :)

I only ask because someone earlier posted a picture and to me, it looked like a boy, but I learned that the girl parts are swollen when in the womb. I'd be really upset if I named the baby and bought him a whole bunch of blue stuff and then he was a girl! Thanks for your input.      (And this is a view from the bottom up.

20090309192018AAWQ8pW	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Is she pregnant? Help us!?	Okay well I'm 16 and my sister she is 14 and she is so young but in love or was in love and she got pressure to have a minute sex with the guy which she has now dump. She has been upset for days and it breaks my heart seeing how worry she is, she has been crying so much and staying up late to make a wish at 11:11. ( I know some of you guys would laugh at that)  She is just so upset, with the fact she has to dump her loser boyfriend that pressure her to have sex and not just once but sadly twice. Yes, get over it we kind of figure she is really stupid for not thinking. Well she told me everything that has happen, she had sex two days after her period was over and five days before it came during this month. Her period came on the fifth of last month and now it hasnt come yet, I told her maybe it is because she is stressed out but she seems to not be able to relax because she is probably thinking about the consequences if she is pregnant what will happen. Shes been telling me she wants to die and run away because she can not take the stress anymore. We are both too embarrass to and can not buy a pregnant test. We cant tell out parents either. She usually has yeast infection but just today she has a lot of yellow stuff on her underwear more then usually. What do you think? I think that the yellow stuff since there is more then usual her body is just cleaning and her period is going to start soon. What are the chances that she is pregnant? The guys brother and I are like bestfriends and I have him talk to his brother and the guy said that he is 100% sure he did not ejaculate but he is only 95% sure that he pre- ***. Yes, I know young kids these days are helpless, lol! (that includes myself)   Please tell me what you think! It will mean a lot to me since she is my sister!!   THANKS!

20090309194418AAjdu5X	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Does this sound like labour is coming?	When I woke this morning I had mucusy discharge with a brownish tinge (TMI - sorry).  It wasn't red. But it was quite a bit.      I had very random tightening period like cramps in my belly throughout the day.  It is now evening and they are more frequent, but not strong enough to be able to time them and they are quite mild.        My EDD is Saturday.      Also, do you think it's a bit too much at this point to go for a long walk tomorrow?  I'm debating to walk or drive to the Dr.  It's probably a 30 minute walk at a slow pace - all down hill.  My husband will pick me up.      I want him out now.

20090309184758AAFDAoF	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Could this be Braxton Hicks contractions?	I am 30.5 weeks pregnant and every once in a while (once every 2 weeks or so), but more frequently over the past week or so I have been noticing my lower stomach (like in my gut area) feeling like it's tightening up and getting hard (on the inside).  Also, sometimes when that happens I feel a slight cramp...like a very light menstrual cramp.  It never lasts long, only a few seconds.  Is this Braxton Hicks contractions or could this be gas or the way the baby is rolling around?  Also I have an anterior placenta....not sure if that makes much of a difference or not.  With my first pregnancy I don't remember feeling anything like this and I was induced so the contractions came on fast and strong.  Thanks for all your help!  :)
20090309194039AAiuaIy	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Does these sound like signs of postpartum depression?	I'm just starting to wonder because of what may have been a sign and a fight that I may have started. Tomorrow my daughter will be seven days old and we came home Friday.      #1. Just the other day '80s movie "Beetlejuice" was on and it made me sad seeing the couple die. That movie has always made me laugh my but off. I still feel kind of sad and I've seen it 100 times.      #2. Just earlier, me and my husband had a fight and I cried (but we made up). I was feeling sad and upset he wanted to go to a friend's to get his PS3 and then them come back and he spend the night so he can work on his car tomorrow. I felt and said I wanted me, him and the baby to have alone time. He says we do, but I feel it's only 3-6 hrs and basically all we do is sit around the house together and take care of her since we don't have a car which he brings up every time he wants friends to come over. What keyed the fight is another one of his friends made a comment that ticked me off but wasn't rude and I took my anger out on him and yelled. He kind of lives with us since he can't afford much, so he went upstairs to get his things and go to his apartment a few blocks away. Me and my husband fought over what I said and how I want to be a happy family like how some times where when my parents were married (they divorced). I think mentioning my parents may have been an excuse since I feel he is putting his friends ahead of me.      Does any of this sound like postpartum depression? Its been awhile since we had a big fight and like I said "Beetlejuice" has always made me laugh.

This is my second baby and he is measuring really big (36 week US said he is already 8 pounds, but every single one I have had done, except for the 6 week one, has said he is measuring 2-3 weeks big)....anyway, him being so big I never thought I would make it to full term. So last week at my 36 week appt I was 1.5cm, cervix was really soft and thinning and he is at Zero Station already. I have been having so much pressure down there I can bearly sit or walk. Then on Friday I lost my Mucus Plug, I have been having loser bowel movements, and feeling somewhat nauses once in awhile....along with getting lots of BH contractions.    I know women can have most those symptoms for weeks before going into labor.....but what is getting me is that he is at zero station all ready!! Has anyone ever had there baby that low 4-5 weeks before due date and not go into labor way before due date. It just seems like with him being so big maybe he is ready to come out....he is defiently down there ready!

20090309192613AAOavRJ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Why do parents do this?	They add more time/punishment when a child begs/pleads after being grounded.        It's not easy to just "take the punishment" and kids (like me) get emotional, and cry.  You'd cry to if you got TV taken away and couldn't go out.        Yea I know we usually deserve what we get, but don't parents understand where we're coming from?  Do they feel bad too?  I think if the child is good for a few days, then the grounding should be lifted.  Sometimes getting yelled at is enough punishment in itself.

We didnt mean to we usually use a condom but this time we were a little drunk...i mean really drunk... and forgot to use one probably only for a couple of minutes before realizing that we hadnt been so we correceted the problem and proceeded. so what i want to know is there any chance at all that she will get pregnant? cuz honestly im only 18 and want to be sure that i dont have possibly a little kid in the oven. because I am not ready for that. Ive heard from sex ed class that semen is immediatley released on to the head of the penis as soon as it is erect. So knowing that and that we only had unprotected sex for a short period. Should we buy some "morning after" pills or is this something i should not fret about? please give me any words of wisdom on the subject( other than to wrap the tool, because we usually do and this time happened to be a simple mistake).

In the beggining I wouldn't mind bc I do love him but after 5 months its like "really kid don't u have parents of your own to feed you or can u make yourself a bowl of cereal" we've even had to hide our snack foods and cans of pop in our room bc 1 they either go "missing" after only a couple of days or 2 he again won't stop begging untill we give him some.  My husband is getting really irritated with him especially after looking forward to eating a certain thing all day he comes home to find it either half eaten or missing.  I feel really bad and I don't know ehose side to be on I love my nephew but he's not some little kid starving on the street he's got his own parents to feed him, and the begging thing is really annoying and an improper way of getting what u want.

Before she had the baby, my whole family decided to take a vacation. We live in Northern Ohio, And we plan on traveling by car to Southern Tennessee. Now my brothers girlfriend wants to go, and by then her baby would almost be around 2 months old, well a month and half. We plan on staying down there for almost a week. And we were trying to tell her that it wouldn't be very fun or very safe if she went with the baby. Please give me your advice about this. Would it be safe to take a baby on an almost 10 hour trip. or not?         just to add to this, she does NOT get along with the family. She picks fights with the my family, and my family fights back with her.      Plus, we're gonna contently doing outdoor activties, not exactly a proper environment for a new born.      The other baby that is involved with the family (15months) is staying with his grandma, because the mother of that child doesn't want to take him on that long of a car ride.
20090309193703AAvcZAf	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Are nurses trained to shape a baby's head after birth?	A father witnessed the nurses shaping his baby's head while they were cleaning the afterbirth. Is this normal? Before they took the baby home, they found out he is hearing impaired and worry that this may have had something to do with it. The doctor's stated that this happens with 1out of every 1,000 births and could not offer any other explanations. Recently, the baby successfully underwent bilateral cochlear implants but what the father witnessed is still weighing heavy on his mind. Is there anything he can do to find out if his worries are valid?

I did have unprotected sex between then and the supposed start but he did not *** inside of me. I have had bad fatigue for the past couple of days, but I have also been sick with either a cold or the flu. No vomitting, no sickness, just really tired and probably due to Sudafed PE. I started having a brown discharge on the 9th and then last night it stopped. If I wipe inside, though, there seems to still be brown discharge but not coming out. This has been going on for 3 days now, and it's not normal for me. Is it pregnancy or is it something else? I did test but it came out negative and one was questionable since it was barely there and showed up an hour after testing

My son will be 12 mo. 2 weeks approx. when my daughter is born in May. My husband is currently deployed so I need a stroller where I can lug them out comfortably and one that can fit in the trunk of my 05 honda civic (sedan) suggestions??      also the single i have we bought on sale at walmart, it was great for all of 2 weeks before the plastic pieces began to bend and now i hate taking it anywhere, so i need something durable, ill pay a little more...will not pay more than 300 though, in fact less than that is ideal, i know quality costs, but i can't spend more than i can afford.

I don't believe that I am pregnant due to a negative test result and a recent trip to the gynecologist ( pap smear & urine sample). However I have many of the symptoms, including I haven't had a period in 2 and a half months, my breast are incredibly sore, odd abdominal pains, and increased appetite. I'm convinced it may be one of two things considering I have been very stressed lately, due to midterms and the recent loss of a friend, I have also recently stopped taking birth control 2 and a half months ago. Not quite sure, need a second opinion. Thanks!

I have been on the pill for about 6 months already, and have missed a pill atleast once, without even doubling up, and had never experienced spotting. Just last week i had missed a pill then doubled up the next day, and i have been experiencing spotting for 8 days now. It is a light brown colour, and goes from light to heavy, changing all the time. I was wondering if this is normal and if i should talk to a doctor, seeing as it has never happened. and when should i expect it to stop? im on my period at the end of this week.       thanks!

20070523121719AACCZnF	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Is it possible for me to be pregnant 5 weeks after a d&c?	I had a d&c 5 weeks ago following a missed miscarriage at 7+6 weeks. 3 weeks after the d&c i had lots of EWCM and had intercourse. It has been just under 2 weeks since then, and i have had slight spotting last night and today. I have had moments of nausea, but only very slight. Is it possible to be pregnant so soon after a d&c? I also have PCOS, so my cycles are very irregular... my previous pregnancy was from clomid.
20070524170515AAN6Msf	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	IUGR - anyone heard of a healthy baby when IUGR detected at 18 weeks?	Somewhere between 12 and 18 weeks the growth of my fetus slowed down.  It is now behind by 3-4 weeks (various measurements).   Two of my doctors do not see much hope but a third doctor only tells me that the baby is moving, has plenty of amnionic fluid and a good heartrate - so we are monitoring and waiting.   I've been through the tests to rule many causes out - right now we think my placenta is not working the way it should.  Has anyone every heard of a healthy baby that was so far behind so early in pregnancy?  I keep hoping that whatever caused the problem has/will resolve and my baby will live.     IUGR - intrauterine growth restriction/retardation  -- means the fetus is very behind in growth (below the 10th percentile)considering the length of gestation.  Many causes include poor maternal nutrition, maternal drug/alchohol use, chromosonal probs, genetics, birth defects, viral infection, uterus shape or placenta probs.

Too early to get check up or not?
20070525090023AASp2lL	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Might be pregnant, not sure when to take test because of recent irregular periods!?	I generally have a very regular cycle of 28 days.  My March period was a week late (stress over traveling internationally), my April period was at my "normal" time, and my May period was 10 days late (stress over traveling home!), and so I have no idea when to expect my next period.  If it goes back to normal, would that be closer to the date when I SHOULD have gotten it last month, or closer to when I did get it last month?      My concern is that I could potentially be pregnant - my boyfriend and I use the withdrawl method, and he pulled out late and did come inside me a bit about a week and a half ago.  Were my period to be back on the "normal" schedule, it would have been around the time I was ovulating.  I'm trying not to get caught up in thinking I'm having pregnancy symptoms, but of course I feel like I am.  Does anyone have experience with a few irregular periods? Do they stablize closer to the before-regular time, or does the late-time become the new regular time?

Let me remind you that we never had sex before. Well we have been dating for 10 months and no problems with my parents. But today my dad comes in my room while me and my GF where just laying in my bed with the door open talking and he sits at my computer chair and he goes off telling us that we have no right laying in my bed and that "it looks wrong". He did this before with my sister too when she was 20 and she was living with us. So my gf got really upset and started crying when he left, he pretty much yelled and the thing is my mom does not care what me and my gf does because she trust me. I thought he did, guess not- this came out of the blue- 10 months me and my gf did this- could could of just told me...

My fiance  and I had unprotected sex 10 days after the start of my last period he ejaculated in me and then the condom broke the next day and we did not know until after he pulled out that it was broken, that would have been 11 days after my period, and then we had unproteced sex again due to drinking this would have been day 12. He ejaculated all three times . I am now on day 14 and I am almost sure that I have ovulated last night or sometime today as I know my body pretty well and usually when I have pain in the middle I ovulate that day.what are my odds of being pregnant ?

20080810011737AAKFBNa	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Sono cambiata ma...?????????????????????	Buongiorno answerini!!!!!!   Ieri sono andata a comprare il mio primo reggiseno e ora sn felicissimaa!!!   Vi spiego..   Ho quasi 15 anni ed il mio problema   grande è la paura di nn essere accettata dagli altri per come sono io.. di conseguenza risulto antipatica agli altri e non ho molti amici.. la cosa   grande ke mi da la paura d nn essere accettata è il fatto ke io mi vedo brutta.. so ke il giudizio degli altri non deve contare niente ma se nn imparo a piacermi da sola cm possono gli altri accettare me?   Così ho deciso di cambiare.   Ho messo le lenti a contatto anzichè quegli orribili occhiali, ho comprato vestiti che più mi piacevano e mi sn tagliata i capelli.. mi piacevo!!! Però c'era una cs di me che nn andava: il seno. Ho sempre portato la fascia ma adesso iniziava a diventarmi stretta e mi teneva caldissimo quindi ieri sn andata a vedere un pò di reggiseni.. ne ho provato uno (seconda scarsa) e mi ANDAVAAA!!! Sono felice =) (non ritenetemi stupida dai, è una soddisfazione personale!)   Però ora ho un pò di timore.. perchè ancora nn mi ha vista nessuno così diciamo "nuova". QUando tra poki gg la gente tornerà dalle vacanze inizierò a riuscire cn i miei amici..ma.. come prenderanno il mio cambiamentoooo????   Come posso comportarmi per rendermi il   normale e naturale possibile??   Vi prego si accettano consigli   (no prese x il cu*o grazie!)   10 punti!!!!
