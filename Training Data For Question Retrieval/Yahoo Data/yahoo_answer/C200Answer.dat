ay8tXLD2aa	The "heritage" collection isn't really what I would call "practical" but it's a head turner.  (Although, not always with people looking and saying "oohhhhhh look at that beautiful pram!" the way my MIL thinks....quite often people are looking and thinking "Uhhhh, why on EARTH would you spend a thousand quid on one of THOSE!?" LOL).<br>  <br>  But, Silvercross is a top top name in prams; good quality, well made, etc.  If you are looking for something a bit more "old fashioned" style, their "Sleepover" line is really good:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.silvercross.co.uk/sleepover_deluxe_classic_chassis.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.silvercross.co.uk/sleepover_d...</a><br>  <br>  They are more practical, and they are a travel system - carry cot, pushchair, car seat.  My SIL had one and loved it.  Very comfortable for her baby and very durable.  Large shopping basket underneath. <br>  But, still pretty near impossible to take on a bus and folds up quite large if you have a small car.|`|YwdsP4c2aa	Only if you've got a nanny and never need to take it on the bus or in a car|`|MHOxPs8Oaa	Wow I'm glad people don't use those here. They are ugly, but no I don't think they are practical. If that's the word you meant.|`|B1GjfOUdaa	They are not practical but they are good warm pram.  I used mine to walk for miles and lost weight very quickly.|`|dgRTkccBaa	Not at all, my mom had one back in the day (I'm over 30) and it was useful because she walked everywhere (we lived in Brooklyn) but if we went anywhere in the car it was left home and she took the umbrella stroller.   Those prams are very beautiful, very expensive and completely impractical today.  They're large and hard to maneuver and don't fold down very well.  You can't take it on the bus or the subway, it's a waste of money for the average person.  Silver Cross is an excellent brand, but i would go with one of the travel systems instead, much more useful and practical.|`|NOz2FRlraa	Not really. They don't fold so it'd be impossible to fit in a car or on public transport. You can get prams that convert to a pushchair which would last baby longer...such as the MyChoice range in Mothercare or the Pliko Pramette from Mamas and Papas. Other manufacturers make pushchairs where you can attach a carry cot to make a pram. These types of things would be far more practical.|`|019e9ad03907f75846fcc35e167f393faa	These type of pram are excellent if you live near shops etc ,Obviously they are a little impractical for use on buses or in a car but they allow baby to be warm and comfortable and are easy to push you will also find people will naturally gravitate towards you just to look at the pram and baby they also can carry more shopping safely than the modern pushchair type .Are they practical? not so much ,Are they the best ? yes|`|dXVA1wHDaa	The big hard bodied one?  No.<br>  <br>  They are huge, not convenient if you use public transport or want to put it in your car.  If you live somewhere you don't need to do this, then maybe.  But even for things like going out shopping, it'd be really awkward.  I had a hard bodied pram then changed to a much neater Silver Cross, similar to this one: <a href="http://www.mothercare.com/gp/product/B001U83CUG/sr=1-8/qid=1236441825/ref=sr_1_8/277-0453518-2111010?ie=UTF8&m=A2LBKNDJ2KZUGQ&n=44352031&mcb=core" rel="nofollow">http://www.mothercare.com/gp/product/B00...</a><br>  <br>  but not the whole pram system, just a buggy.  It's much easier to handle.
1SxVIZd7aa	i think its pretty cool he likes old music. Most kids dont get into oldies until they are a bit older. I would encourage him! dont say its werid!|`|zqxP5exvaa	There is nothing bad with that. Hey people say kids should listen to Mozart.....is it any different, ezcept Mozart is from centuries ago? It's a good thing that he likes music. Just be thankful it isn't rap he likes. When my brother was that age, he loved all music. It is a good thing when he gets to the age when he can play an intrument at school.<br>  <br>  Passion for music can come at all ages. So what if it is from a while ago. It's still music isn't it? Just watch out for some music that might not be appropriate.|`|J38v75bvaa	yea...that just means that when he gets older he will have a wide range in music. that's a very good thing. when i was little i use to tell people i was born in 1956...no 1986. i loved everything 50s...i still do. not obsessed with it just love the way pics look and how elegant the people were back then.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	I grew up on that music and it was before my time.<br>  Course it is normal.<br>  Only downfall for him is they don't release new songs<br>  <br>  <br>  25 and considered "Old" Lovely|`|Y9Sj56D5aa	when i was younger about 20yrs ago i knew this kid younger then me who love the beatles, at the time i couldn't stand them now when i hear them i'm like cool .|`|8tLS1XDWaa	Yes, this is normal... but its not normal for him to have an ipod... wow I am getting soo old..|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	I dont like the beatles ..my son does. taste in music is subjective..not something thats normal or not.I cant stand the country music my daughter likes ..but its her taste and thats ok|`|b328a9d35b4d38f11fb5ea37fe0b727aaa	Does your child have other issues, like difficulty with social skills or difficulty making eye contact? Does he seem to get jokes?<br>  <br>  Yes, it is only old people here. Are you the 9 year old?
HTN7g3B1aa	i found out at seventeen weeks that mine is a boy. it just depends on how willing they are or aren't to show off for the camera.<br>  <br>  good luck :)|`|EH6ExoV6aa	No is not too early but I would recommend to wait till your next appointment when your 21 weeks it more accurate. Insurance only covers one ultrasound so think it thru. I had mine at 18 weeks and she told me it's a boy but I have doubts I'm having a 3D done on Monday to confirm before I get all boy crazy. The baby was moving too much and I could not see anything down there too blurry.<br>  Edit <br>  Then I wish you Luck and congrats.|`|930a625eb301aae633a9b9d8e18e0752aa	You'll have a good chance of finding out any time now. As long as baby is willing to share that info lol.|`|AA12192295	They can sometimes tell the sex at 17 weeks but your next appointment will probably be just a regular prenatal appointment and they will probably schedule your ultrasound appointment for closer to 20 weeks. I'm 13 weeks tomorrow and my next appointment is on march 26 and they told me that for the 20 week scan, its special and you have to set an appointment for that because thats when they check everything, its not just to take a quick look. They will probably have you make an appointment with an ultrasound technician. My doctor told me that doctors don't usually do the 20 week scan. So they probably wont even try to look at your appointment.<br>  <br>  Then you might get to find out the sex.. I've heard of them finding out at 16 weeks.. but if they do tell you, you might want to have another check around 20 weeks just to be sure. good Luck! I cant wait to find out!
zQAWuMN4aa	Wow, Macy, you've got a lot of good ones on there. I still like the last one the best. I mean the shopping cart looks really cool too. I wanna know what you get & how your baby likes it.<br>  <br>  The first item listed we had at the daycare I worked at. The kids seemed to love it. It plays music & I think makes a sound when you open & shut the door. I think she'd like that too. Gosh how I wish I could get one of those....Hmmm, rob a bank-yes!  Just kidding.|`|mVD3TQkFaa	I got my nephew the laugh and learning center #1 on your list for Christmas. He was 11 months at Xmas time. He loves it and I love it too. It is so much fun to play with and it has a learning them which I love it really has taught him some things along with being fun. He is about 14 months now and still loves to play with it.|`|8jlOGOAeaa	I like number 1 or number 4.<br>  <br>  While they are a bit more expensive, you will get more play out of them. The push walkers are fun now, but as a Mommy of a 2 year old, I know that usually once a child starts walking, they have no desire to push something in front of them..not very often anyway.<br>  <br>  But, things that make noise...well..they don't go out of style for a while...LOL|`|AA10361076	I think the stroller would be your best bet. She can use it to help her  learn to walk and then when she gets a little bigger she can use it with her babies. multi-use is always better!!!|`|n86nMfbtaa	I really like the first or third one! Something that's fun but can help her learn to walk sounds ideal... and those seemed best fit.|`|tQVBDx5Paa	Either one of the walkers would be good....it is a toss up.  My 18 month old likes babies and kitchen stuff....|`|p2Njf5gBaa	I would go with 1 or 2.  <br>  <br>  I know my son loves to go through things, infant most babies do, so the little door toy could be a lot of fun. <br>  <br>  The second toy looks like fun as well.  Babies love parts to things and their is a lot to play with.  <br>  <br>  As far as the stroller thing, its cute, but, their really isn't much to it for amusement.  I have found that babies don't care to use the walker type toys to learn to walk with.  They either move way too fast, or barely move at all.|`|Ojgqd4xNaa	The door.  My mom, got this for my niece when she was like 10 months old.  She's not 2.5, with a 19 month old sister, and they still play with it all the time.  So even though it's more money then the other toys, it's worth it.  Plus it's really cute, you can also get a kitchen to go with it, and kids love playing with doors for some reason!|`|zPYyGw8oaa	I heard great things about the learning home and crawling jungle...I have been itching to get these for my 9 month old son :) Take a look on craigslist, someone in your area may be selling one used. They are just as good, all you have to do is sanitize it and make sure it is in good condition. You usually get them for 70% cheaper|`|gJrHBtp1aa	Out of those options I would get the stroller walker thing. I do have to say I wish I had $75 to just splurge on my baby at a whim. hehe everything I do I have to budget for :(|`|heDtLdz5aa	i like the shopping cart walker or the stroller..if she is almost walking then this would be a great tool for her to learn...|`|VudhjHi2aa	Crawl & Cruise Musical Jungle I have and My Son still likes it he is 12m now and my sister has it too her 9m old loves is and so does her 2yr old. BUT It gets in the way it is SO big so if you got the room it's great. But if not I would go with the Shop and learn or the stroller. Kids at the age love to push thing around.<br>  <br>  <br>  {{All time best in my home}}}<br>  The link below is a toy my sister got my son and she has not been able to top this gift. I know it might look a lil boyish but it's Mickey Mouse every kid loves Mickey. This is by far the best gift he has ever got. He loves to put the blocks in the side and when he does is makes sounds and then he can get them out under the seat and push all the buttons to hear the music and see the Propellers rotate with lights and the propellers are rubber and he can stop it with his had without getting hurt. He just LOVES it.<br>  He Now is getting on and sitting on it himself and he just thinks he is so cool. He has had this gift since X-mas and not a day has gone by that he has not played with it.<br>  Good Luck!!<br>  <br>  <br>  {{ME too.. I want to know what you get and How she likes is}}
n86nMfbtaa	I love the name Shi as it's unique but he won't have to deal with everyone mispronouncing it for his whole life (like me!)<br>  <br>  And I reeeally love the girls name. Amelia is so pretty (:|`|wzn1tDiCaa	i like those names very unique. i personally want my child to have a unique name too. if it was a girl i would name it treasure. She would be the treasure of my life, it is pretty and unique. you might like it too.|`|pberHIRPaa	The girls name is gorgeous, but I'm not a big fan of the boy name. However, it is your child so don't worry about my opinion.|`|BTXblFnVaa	Amelia Isabella is lovely! I love Finley too (and I prefer that spelling). It's nice that you are honouring his brothers.|`|0bSb9evZaa	Why not Shai instead of Shi? That way, people won't say shee<br>  <br>  EDIT: my brothers called Shai and they never mispronounce his name :)|`|2pNHOCONaa	i think the kid would have trouble writing down his/her name on his/her paper in kindergarten XD|`|HXILtO0Gaa	Finnley's cool|`|H1OpsNCPaa	They're cute.<br>  I like 'em ( :<br>  xx|`|kLK2peV1aa	boys got a real long name!!!! I'd hate righting that on my calc homework everynight. but i like em.|`|VHHis05Naa	Yikes, the boys name is terrible.|`|OtqB24NVaa	I like the  girls name...very pretty<br>  <br>  the boys name, I like but its very  long. When you have 2 last names, then 2 middle names, it starts to become a little to much<br>  <br>  How about LaKeith Finnley Wilhight-Brown|`|CecQFtDvaa	i love your names <br>  but for the girls name<br>  i would do isabella amelia williams-brown<br>  good luck|`|Lo5yiBqzaa	The girls name is beautiful but the boys name is way too long.  I like Finnley Shi.|`|nxeQFPEfaa	How come one is Williams-Brown and the other is Wilhight-Brown??<br>  I don't get it.|`|Co9I2OMSaa	Long, but cute!
MHOxPs8Oaa	Yeah, why wouldn't I?|`|VHHis05Naa	Do you know the parents?  Have you met them?  Are they trustworthy people?   I'd probably let my daughter go as long as I knew the parents and got an okay vibe from them.  I'd make sure she had all our phone numbers.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	It sounds trustworthy enough and if you know the parents, I would let her go. <br>  <br>  However, has she gone to one before? Does she have special attachment to a particular bedtime routine? If she's never been away, expect to get a phone call late at night for you to pick her up, which is normal. :) Although she could be so distracted by her friends and the fun stuff going on she won't even miss you and will have a great time.|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	Yes, if I knew the mom or dad, and confirmed everything which was included in the invitation. Make sure you talk to the parent ahead of time.<br>  I wouldn't let her go to a stranger's house, though, no matter how good of friends she was with the girl. For a few hours for a birthday party or something, that would be ok.|`|5nfqY9T7aa	Yes, but if I felt unsure about it, I'd call the mom of the girl who is hosting the party to ease my mind.|`|GIlTkQu6aa	yea why not. if a boy is there than no but i think your being a little too over protective|`|Q8wDjvZ1aa	i don't see a difference, as long as you don't have plans, if the invite came on monday of 3 months in advance.  if you are concerned about anything, call the parents, talk to them, when you drop her off go inside with her ('help her carry her bags' and set up her bed' ) then you get to see exactly what kind of place it is if you are not familiar.   but it doesn't sound like that's the problem?  so to me it would depend if you have already made plans which it doesn't sound like to me.|`|dwok9z8faa	yes. i don't see anything wrong with that. u know wat they are going to do- activity wise, and you have the names and numbers of parents in case you need to get ahold of them|`|cYRZpGkqaa	Of course. She's certainly old enough fr a slumber party, and with several adult chaperones, everything should work out fine. Just make sure to call the parents to confirm.|`|MbMrbpHvaa	uhm yeah what difference would an extra week make its not like it takes days and days of preparing for a slumber party.|`|zH1sg3Xraa	No. I would not allow a fourth grader to sleep at an overnight sleepover. This is way too young for this type of activity.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	Yeah I would. If she knows the kid well.|`|Z3Mv1pxaaa	yes|`|n30k2fy9aa	yes, sure, why not?|`|jwGkGaiCaa	Well it all depends really.<br>  Is it just a slumber party or is it like a birthday slumber party.<br>  <br>  If its just an invite for a sleepover I'd say the notice is fine, if you already have plans for the weekend just say she can't go. <br>  <br>  But if it's for a birthday or something with a gift it's a little short notice because you may not have the time to go out and get something if it's a busy week or you have other plans.|`|ohSqBO4Taa	If I know the family, and trusted them I would let her go.  I know that sometimes the invites don't get sent out in a timely fashion these days (it's happened to my daughter sometimes, and I must admit, I'm guilty of it too).  As long as you know the family and you trust them, you should let her go.|`|Mr9McLtiaa	Being social is important for a young girls development.  But- My sister was molested at one of these sleep overs. After that my mother never let us go anywhere!  This was frustrating for me but she was just trying to protect me.  I'm sorry to scare u but thats the world we live in.  Allow her to the party, allowing her to sleep over is risky.  Then again living ur life in fear is no fun either.<br>  Im sure all will work out fine, Im sure you can judge if there is potential danger or not.<br>  U knw mothers have this 6th sense so make sure u listen to it.|`|bZZAYIv6aa	Yes, I would let her.  Sometimes parenting can keep you so busy that you cant make plans too far in advance or you find yourself unable to commit to obligations, so maybe they just didn't have time to plan it in advance.|`|9jKRodXJaa	yes,let her have fun,shes just a kid! is less than a weeks notice really that big of a deal? especially if they laid out the party plans really nicely, and offered phone numbers also.|`|pZ4VxGrtaa	Sure :) i bet she'll have fun.<br>  If you feel uneasy, call the girls mom & chat with her about what will be going on. My mom was always paranoid about me going off so she'd talk to friends moms and feel better. Good luck!|`|313f9383392249a5b1386591a7133716aa	I would first have to meet the parents. After meeting the parents I then would decide from there.|`|bImlg171aa	uh, yeah! There is no reason not too...when I was little, I was invited to sleepovers on the night they were happening. There's nothing wrong with a sleepover. Really.|`|aac9e99cfbd47367e4f29a390df5846caa	Sure, but I would call the parents to talk to them about it. and she would have to get every thing done by then.|`|5RK2PBRraa	Of course, chill. gosh|`|foJm2Yftaa	I would, but first I would make sure its safe! %Lol%|`|1VdgsZPoaa	Yes, I don't see why not.|`|fAN8snFdaa	yea for sure.. <br>  do you know/like the kid and/or parents?<br>  <br>  should be harmless for a 4th grader|`|53pargZ3aa	why wouldnt you let her go?|`|4Ug9FdFdaa	i would need numbers i can contact her <br>  and i would want to meet the parents|`|rPoKRm8gaa	Ya....its a couple days notice.....are you that busy?|`|Urs6AQQvaa	I would let her go as long as you met the parents who are throwing the party... Get to know them... Proceed with caution but try not to be too protective... you gotta throw some trust around sometimes so if you trust her let her go... just make sure you meet the person's parents to see if they meet your standards which ever they may be ya know =]<br>  Good Lucks to ya|`|X8b2zP2vaa	Yes, because when you were a kid wouldn't you want to go. Even though she's only in the fourth grade you have to let her grow up! How is she going to learn if she doesn't experience it?!|`|0cac022104202e9c73b3363feb1905abaa	if you feel uncomfortable letting her go the whole night <br>  maybe you can let her stay until 9 or 10. That's what i would do...|`|T33Za7jiaa	I would, but go with caution.<br>  Have constant contact with the parents.<br>  Make sure it's a safe environment for you child to be in.|`|kLK2peV1aa	not a parent, but i would. unless of course guys are staying the night too.|`|SqFBiwT9aa	if you trust the parents th whome shes going to then yes! dont leave her out from everyone else
Fkl6gV8Qaa	Are you a US citizen? Is your aunt in Egypt or the US? There are many things that you could do to get back to the US. You said you are visiting Egypt, you didn't say how long your dad planned on being there. The best thing to is have someone there that you love and trust sit down with you and him and tell him if you aren't going to be able to get back before he notices.|`|6mBpkt3Daa	hmm tough one.. dont worry, ur aunt will help u back :)|`|uQc4UA2Caa	i would ask ur aunt and b.f's parents to buy u a ticket back, leave without ur dad knowing and tell him once u have left and are back. tell him his parents and him are supporting u and he doesnt have to worry about u. explain then that u were scared and wanted to do whats best for your baby|`|98WKYtfwaa	If you're only visiting with him, when does he expect you to be travelling back to America? How far along are you? You should get back to America as soon as you can and then you can live with your aunt or your boyfriend or something. He can support you both as he's 18 and legal to work.|`|2JKt3Nkqaa	When you go back home go and live with your boyfriends parents and maybe text your dad saying your pregnant when you get back and explain this to your boyfriends parents because they sound nice and I think they would help you.<br>  God bless you and your baby and good luck!|`|AA11348933	Have your Aunt help you.  It sounds like a tricky situation.  The important thing is to get back to the US first.  Then maybe you can stay with your boyfriend's family.  You can get emancipated from your father.|`|pkCpNGzcaa	If you tell your Dad the truth than he may be mad but he will also love the baby and he wouldn't compromise your health if the baby were to be unhealthy just to show that he is mad that you are pregnant. Tell him the truth and then get on the first plane home and go see a doctor. Good luck!|`|Ueix2Q7Taa	That's a hard one. I know in america you could get emmancipated and then he couldn't say anything about you leaving but I don't how it works in egypt. Sorry.|`|6ArhO4qvaa	IM NOT TOUCHING THIS ONE <br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK THOUGH
TV1Fvhfxaa	Do what she likes.|`|Ze9KepaWaa	It is perfectly ok to play with any toys that you find enjoyable. Having fun does not have an age requirement, and nobody should put you down for playing with dolls. <br>  On the other hand, it is very important for any teenager to start participating in adult activities and conversations. Observing and learning the way adults interact is important, as you will soon be one yourself. Not to say adults can't like dolls. But you should try to expand your horizons a little bit if you want to be taken srsly.<br>  And lastly, nobody said you had to participate in adult activities that you don't find fun. There are so many things to do in this world, there has to be something mature that you like doing. Find one, and try to build up experience in that field.|`|TaFrxxJXaa	never follow the crowd.<br>  <br>  stick out don't blend in.|`|W6S6WpsNaa	You do what you like to do, don't follow the crowd.  Be yourself!|`|IwvszgPdaa	just be youself and do what you want to do. dont follow the crowd, youve got plenty of time to act grown up. having said that you should be careful about who you tell that you play with dolls. some will see it as babyish and tease the hell out of you. its cruel but thats just what some kids are like|`|0cac022104202e9c73b3363feb1905abaa	Never follow the crowd do what you like to do and don't try to act grown up because you really wont fool anyone so just act your age it will make things easier|`|MFwWifGIaa	Girls shouldn't be playing with dolls past like 4th grade at most. You need to move on. Life's not make believe. You have to experience it|`|I9inol7aaa	do what you like and be youself. it's better being a leader than a follower|`|SEzIkGNiaa	Do what she likes.  Thats what I do.  I don't follow the "crowd", cause most of them are immature.|`|QP8LdPLeaa	to me i have always find that teenagers are not even mature in the first place, because they always want to be somebody they're not, they want to do this and that ALL because their peers are doing it so they feel they HAVE to do it. they get pregnant all the time, they jump into situations without thinking. they have sex when they don't even KNOW what it is.....i could go on.<br>  <br>  my definition of a mature teenager is concentrating on your studies, make your parents proud and hold their trust and stop paying attention to peer pressure.
3MDY29gnaa	well if your actually "ready" then go for it! Only you know when the time is right. If your ready to start then go for it! You can start trying now but that doresnt mean you will get pregnant on the first try (but you never know. <br>  Check out this site <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.babycenter.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.babycenter.com</a><br>  Make an account and make sure you click *ttc*type in your LMP and personal info and buy ovulation kits (opk's) and that will help you find out when your ovulating. Hope i helped a little. <br>  Good luck|`|dtZ3tmoRaa	I would go ahead and start trying now because it can take a few months to actually conceive. Why not get a jump start on it??|`|EtFJdgn9aa	Try now - if it fails..then that'll surely be a sign that you need to wait and then that'll give him time to get the op done!|`|PQw92IGHaa	If you guys are both ready for a baby, you should begin trying.  Make sure that it would be totally okay if you got pregnant the first month off the pill because it could happen.   I understand the university issue and you have to weigh out if you will be able to be pregnant and handle your classes.  If you waited a few months, you guys could conceive and have your baby right after you took your final exam.   Remember you have nine months till your baby is born and you will be able to attend class/take tests during that time.<br>  <br>  Also, don't stress about him having an operation.  They told my sister-in-law that her husband would never be able to get her pregnant without an operation and she was pregnant 2 months after getting off the pill!   Good Luck!|`|a7364c50b7e6712ee3c77218a3232b45aa	If it was me I'd be a bit sceptical about how he can't wait to be a stay-at-home Dad before you're even pregnant....easy ride springs to mind.|`|lXaAFIHfaa	Let me just say that any man who feels fulfilled by being a stay at home dad is not a real man. A real man feels the need to provide for his family and should be allowed to do so even if that means he makes less than you. From what I have seen, sooner or later you will both come to resent the other.
cRAGyQE1aa	I had 4 negative pregnancy tests ( 3 urine sample tests and a bloodtest) with my 2nd child but my instinct told me I was pregnant.This was only confirmed by a scan after my 4th test.I was 5 weeks and 3 days pregnant according to the scan.|`|77d7d84d5a4a1152b83fd0114e664134aa	you are not pregnant|`|zNSDHpV6aa	just wait and see blood dont lie
X9JSlC6Iaa	Go to the doctor and get a blood test taken. Wow stupid teens.|`|lgXSmCQRaa	Well this is under teens, it does take a while for your period to settle. Im 20 and mine is still irregular. So just be safe.|`|QP8LdPLeaa	goodness, how many times am i going to see silly questions like these? you could be pregnant if your period is THAT late. go see a doctor or take a pregnancy test.|`|IwvszgPdaa	im guessing you are teenager due to the category this is under. your periods can still be irregular im afraid. worrying can affect your periods too. if you are very worried then go to see the doctor. in the mean time, make sure you practice safe sex then you will have no need to worry about missed periods in the future|`|N2KmE3rVaa	It could be due 2 stress.|`|ByWRzuuraa	I wouldnt worry, during one time i didnt have my period for like 3 months,  these things happen i was worried too but im still a virgin so i couldnt be pregnant!!!<br>  <br>  x|`|OsHJ9Mcqaa	I had this same problem, in fact i had mine on the 3rd jan 09 and only just come on last week (5th march). its may be the stress from school or whatever, go to the doctor have them check it out.<br>  I went there and his test came back negative (i had previously done 3 home tests all - ), he told me if it wasnt there in a week go back to him, luckily i came on the day i was due to go back.<br>  <br>  Sometimes its normal to miss a period, but just to be on the safe side go and get it checked.|`|LQ7rROMSaa	Well, if you are 17, you really need to learn how to type and spell words.<br>  <br>  It's normal to have an irregular period. We're girls, our bodies are changing. It's nothing really to get too worried about. My periods aren't always the perfect 28. I miss at least one month a year. Like I said, our bodies are changing, growing. Periods are obviously a sign of womanhood. Irregular periods are normal. However, if you feel like something really is wrong, you should go check it out with your doctor. It might not be pregnancy, it might not be simply irregular periods. It could be something more, but you won't exactly know until you get professional help.|`|1k8vonhzaa	dont worry , i missed my period for 3 months! and thats long lol! I didnt worry but if you arn't eating properly it can affect your periods or if you are stressed or upset all the time then you can miss it. If the tests say negative then you have nothing to worry about because your not pregnant.|`|trxEyVRLaa	17 to 18 is kinda young... :L<br>  I'm almost 16 and I feel way too young, as do ALL of my friends.<br>  <br>  In your teen years - even if you're near the end of them, your cycle is still sorting itself out so yeas, you will miss some still, and yes they will become irregular and then it'll sort itself out again - it'll happen a coupl of times in your teen years|`|rwAHB8APaa	don't worry if it said your not then your not but have you been feeling unwell because when im ill i miss a period
6lSbmXunaa	Left. Cheating is disrespectful. I would much rather the guy respect me and admit that he doesn't love me anymore than playing games. That way we can both move on.|`|jZsST62saa	left.<br>  i think that's the way it should be. either way the girl is going to get hurt. why not do it in a way where she will get hurt less. cheating just disrespectful.|`|s2E6EKwgaa	that's an easy answer of course i rather be left it would be to hard to be cheated on or also i could get my vengeance and cheat on her also :) anyways either way sucks so yea.....|`|T6PzMyPBaa	left.<br>  at least they'll have enough respect for you to tell you how they feel rather than go behind your back with someone else.|`|IwvszgPdaa	thats a no brainer. definitely left than cheated on. i dont think anyone would want to be cheated on|`|N2KmE3rVaa	Left.|`|AXEqOEloaa	He could leave!|`|P3A7hkFvaa	rather be left for sure. that can heal in time|`|E7ViD8EWaa	Cheated on.<br>  <br>  Then I could yell at them and then dump them! <br>  That would make me feel better than being left.<br>  <br>  =]|`|yIdwMPsoaa	left for sure<br>  <br>  cheating sucks|`|ads40ROCaa	Every single one of my ex's cheated. Then months in left because they "couldn't bear to hurt me."<br>  The sad thing is I knew they were cheating and as much as it hurt me, I didn't leave them.<br>  <br>  Now, I just wish they would have left me instead of dragging me through this.<br>  <br>  Finally I've found an amazing boyfriend who after 15 months would rather die then cheat on me or leave me. This time, it's genuine too.|`|rHufcHwHaa	left--when you're cheated on, it just means that the person doesn't respect you enough to let you know they want to go.  either way it's going to hurt, but at least when you get dumped, you won't sit around imagining what it was like when he cheated on you (or she!).|`|QP8LdPLeaa	i don't see why a person wouldn't just LEAVE but have to cheat. if you don't love somebody anymore then what is cheating going to do, besides make the pain worse? just man up and let her go. i rather be left then to be betrayed.|`|8f892b4972d7cb015a31e859e2be573caa	Left, because cheated = I'm not good enough.
AA12033653	I felt the baby move before I found out the babies sex.  I felt her move at about 17 weeks and found out it was a girl at 22 weeks.  <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|GxlkhRfoaa	I found out the sex of our baby at 16 weeks.  Which is early.  And I started feelin movement I think around 19 weeks.|`|iwYu32N2aa	I felt movement first at like 18-19 weeks and found out sex when i was 21 weeks.|`|98WKYtfwaa	It's different for everyone about feeling the movements.<br>  <br>  I personally felt movement from 15weeks, i found out the sex at 18weeks.<br>  <br>  It depends on the sonographer when you find out the sex, sometimes they tell you at 16weeks, most won't tell you until you're about 18-20weeks along due to the chance of them getting it wrong if they tell you early.|`|dRo89MsYaa	it really depends on the person. sometimes you feel movement first and sometimes you find out the sex first. i felt movement first and i'm finding out the baby's sex hopefully on the 16th, but you know how that goes :P|`|WuVW9uCAaa	i felt movement first and then ill find out what im having on the 11th<br>  good luck oh and i felt the baby move at 13-14 wks ill be 4 months when i know what im having|`|uJJPFJoyaa	Depends, your baby will be moving during the early weeks of the first trimester but you will not be able to feel them because she/he is so small. As for determining the sex the doctor will have to determine that between 16-18 weeks, around that time some women can feel slight movement also. I didn't feel movement until I was 20 weeks and I didn't find out the sex until I was 18 weeks.|`|68l1TeDjaa	i felt my baby move first. the doctors will tell you the best time to find out the sex of the baby is about 5 months. you will more than likely feel the baby first.<br>  <br>  the first ultrasound at figuring out what i was having was about 4 1/2 months, and they said it was a boy, well when i switched doctors at about 5 1/2 months, they said it was a girl, and it was very evident. she is 3 months old now.|`|5QDouy4Uaa	well if you are a thinner person you will most likely feel movement first. but if your heavier set then maybe not. Although it still depends on the person. I was 108# pre pregnancy and felt movement around 18 weeks (I felt flutter before then but felt distinct kicks and pokes around then) and found out the sex of my baby at 20-21 weeks|`|1w41ReD7aa	It can go either way.<br>  This is my first baby & I'm going to those 3d/4d places on the 23rd to find out the sex of the baby. I am 13 weeks on monday, & I have been feeling movements in my tummy but its all gas, so it just depends on the person I believe, like I look like iam 4 months pregnant already! My pre pregnancy weight was 115 now I am 137, with a BELLY! So it all depends on the women, goodluck & congradulations.|`|0VUZacRTaa	movement then the sex of the baby. i felt my baby move around 17 weeks and went for my sonogram to find out the sex around 20 weeks|`|ZvkX9uNraa	I felt my first kicks the day I turned 18 weeks pregnant and the next day I found out that it was a girl.|`|MQ83HGD5aa	I found out around 20 weeks and that is about the same time I felt movement.|`|EmhBDHMtaa	movement for me came first..you should find out what the baby is around your 20week|`|zNSDHpV6aa	move come at 16 to 20 weeks and the sex of the baby come at a 16 weeks to so about the same but<br>   i felt my baby move at 13 weeks with my second child my frist child i was 16 weeks|`|EH6ExoV6aa	Found out gender first at 18 weeks started to feel him at 20 weeks. it depends on the baby and the doctor I guess everyone is different.
EH6ExoV6aa	give it one more month cause I grew alot from 16 to 20 weeks. I am currently 25 weeks and you can definitely tell I'm pregnant. I weigh 145 currently so I've gained about 10lbs.|`|kIblsxJQaa	wont be long now.|`|GxlkhRfoaa	I noticed the different very early on.  At like 9 weeks.  But other ppl being able to notice I'd say I was 17 weeks.|`|Bg6txvxqaa	You should start showing in another couple of weeks, I started ballooning at about 15 weeks but really started showing at about 19 weeks.<br>  <br>  Some women don't start to show until they're about 30 weeks though so don't panic if you don't have a bump by then!<br>  <br>  All the best!|`|dg6wd8ufaa	I would say in a month or 2... But its hard to tell for sure because some women don't show at all until 7th month. I am 16 weeks and 1 day with my first and i am showing a little already!|`|rfkVin6Iaa	Your stomach will become harder and after about a month and a half it will be noticable if your wearing a fitted shirt.|`|WuVW9uCAaa	in about a month or so|`|nxVGEKeUaa	you should start to show any day now, pregnancy is unique for each woman and each baby. I have three with my first one i was almost 6  months before I started to show, with my last I was about 4. Typically you start to show around 20 weeks. congrats and come back and tell us what you are having|`|59fdLKz0aa	it depends on how much weight you gain, really. When I was pregnant with my fourth I was a little over weight. As I began to eat a bit better and exercise, the muscles toned and the baby 'used up' some of the extra poundage. <br>  <br>  So, it depends on how much you gained. This is a question for your doctor to answer anyway. All you want to know is if the baby is the right size for the developmental stage.|`|eMSP740Taa	ummm..about week 20 you should see a nice size baby bump..Aww...I remember my first pregnancy...I couldn't wait til i showed either!!

xqgE4CrBaa	She sounds good! Try ballet twice or three times a week for this year. It will build her endurance and technique by a tenfold. After a year or two, add jazz or more ballet. You may want to reduce your ballet classes by a bit then. When it's time for kindergarten, she will have a wider variety of choices. I would also recommend a few days of ballet, and maybe some jazz, tap or modern. Good luck!<br>  <br>  To Halo Mom: It seems that that this girl is a talented little girl. Are you jealous? It sure seems that way... anyways, I sort of agree that that is a bit much for a 2 year old, but this is her mom's choice, and many little girls become more talented if they start early. I started gymnastics at age 2, and I started competing at age 6. I quit a level 6 and an age 8 because I wanted to do more dance and performing arts (something I also started when I was 2). It's every mom's choice.<br>  <br>  To Sweet-grass: I love jazz dancing too! Although ballet is much more important to dance training.|`|gyzMxjAiaa	Is your question about dance, or do you want to  know what we think about what that mother is doing to her child? I think it borders on child abuse and someone needs to make that mother understand the potential physical and emotional damage she is doing to her child. No reputable gymnastics coach would allow that for an 8 year old, much less one who is 2.|`|mvKbfkhGaa	My daughter does gymnastics but i don't want her to get into all of the really hard stuff until shes older...shes 3 now. You could tell her to try jazz, lyrical (idk about this one), or maybe hip-hop...I would ddefinitelygo with jazz, my other daughter does it and she is also 3 (they are twins) and she loves it.....And i don't mean to be rude but i think the mom may be pushing her a little too hard because if they are going almost everyday for 4 hours that's a lot of work...especially on a 2 year old girl....my daughter is 3 and she goes for 2 hours per WEEK.....|`|dd8cb229ee241de8ca385f84ec4b33d7aa	That is crazy<br>  <br>  You should tell her that Shawn Johnston started Gymnastics at age 6, ten years later with her coach and talent, she was in the olympics<br>  <br>  A 2 year old, needs to be two|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	my kids like jazz dancing..me too

AA10196172	Sperm can live in the uterus 2 to 3 - possibly 5 - days waiting for the egg. You had unprotected sex (and a full deposit, I assume) on day 10, and could be ovulating according to the calendar anytime between day 11 and day 16.<br>  <br>  Even without a full deposit, there can sometimes be sperm in pre-c*m. There's only one way to find out, and you are doing it.<br>  <br>  The 27th covered  3 or 4 of 6 possible days. You might have covered 1 of the 2 remaining days too.  Based on that, it should not be a surprise if you are pregnant.<br>  <br>  All you can do now is wait for your period. If it is overdue, then you can take a test. Until then, if you look for symptoms, and you are worried, your mind may start imagining them.<br>  <br>  OTOH, people actually trying to get pregnant don't always "catch" when the timing is right.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|a1ymHaWAaa	yes you could be pregnant|`|1EHmi2Y1aa	Go to the store and buy a pregnancy test! Or go to your nearest Planned Parenthood for a test.|`|68l1TeDjaa	you could be. those are the best times really to get pregnant, and if the condom broke on last day of period, you could very well be pregnant. me and boyfriend had sex for the first time on the last day of period, and i got pregnant. got a 3 month old girl now. i would just wait till your period comes, and if it dont at least a week after your supposed to start then get a test. i knew i was pregnant without even taking a test, so a month later i took one and i was pregnant.<br>  <br>  and dont be scared. be happy. its so joyous, specially when it starts moving. i miss being pregnant. it was the best time of my life.|`|10a75ee0424e1f57ac73550ada2b49deaa	Ever heard about pregnancy tests sold in any drugstore? According to the dates you mention it may be possible that you haven't even conceived, meaning that some little spermatozoids are about to finish their Formula 1 race. Even if you have conceived the product at this stage is a glomerublast, not even an embryo. So that cannot cause you the pain. However, however some other villain may be lurking in the dark. And the fact that the pain is ON ONE SIDE tends to confirm this. It MAY repeat MAY be endometriosis and the formation of an ovarian cyst in an advanced stage. (Note: this is NOT cancer and is not malign, but needs removal) Have an ecograph done AND THEY WILL TELL YOU.|`|6TuxC5BLaa	Could be but might be just ovulating have you tested it at home yet, if not then try first.|`|kmOx8Hu6aa	Sounds to me like youre ovulating....<br>  <br>  When I ovulate, I cramp like Im getting my period, but its only on one side of my abdomen. Considering you ovulate 2 weeks before youre due to get your period AND youre experiencing these pains, Im guessing thats what it is ;) <br>  <br>  Stop stressing, and have PROTECTED sex if you dont want a baby! Much easier to prevent pregnancy than to deal with it if it happens :)|`|A9MDoFooaa	if you have had unprotected sex then yes of course you may be pregnant.<br>  but to have cramps when you press on your tummy is not a good indicator to pregnancy! are you constipated? sounds more likely.<br>  <br>  if its not and you experience any serious pain in the area or it does not reduce - do not wait to get medical help in case of ectopic pregnancy<br>  <br>  good luck|`|8pl3ShtBaa	You could be pregnant.

But its fine I was sick my last trimester as well|`|BzCYQlcuaa	like yellow spitty puke? i have this to and my doctor said its stomach acid. but i would check with your doctor too!|`|5nfqY9T7aa	If your stomach is empty it's normal for your throw up to be yellow-ish.|`|uTEr67Bhaa	It is normal for some women as they experience the morning sickness all over again.  The yellow is bile and means that you have nothing on your stomach.  You should consult your doctor  to make sure that there is nothing else that it could be and try eating some saltines to calm your stomach.|`|4CMx1uzXaa	I am not sure. I think sickness can last all through a pregnancy- well thats what I have heard anyways. Yellow would mean bile- are you eating and drinking enough?|`|WuVW9uCAaa	thats all bile then u need to eat something or call ur doc|`|ZfvoW3m7aa	I'm not sure about pregnancy, but I do know that if you're vomit is yellow and you haven't eaten anything yellow, it could be a problem with your liver.  There may be too much bilburin in your system.  You could also be jaundiced.|`|RFzKP7MGaa	im sure anything pregnant women do is normal, i mean what CANT be normal for someone in that condition
EmhBDHMtaa	your about 7weeks|`|rfkVin6Iaa	7 weeks|`|G1j3Ja5Iaa	my last period was jan. 2 and im 9 weeks and 2 days today. so that would put you in your 7th week of pregnancy and your due date is October 24, 2009. now, remember, this is not exact. you might have ovulated late or early, so to find out exactly, you need an ultrasound. but these are usually pretty accurate and the doctor should give you a due date close to this..give or take a couple days. congrats!|`|ZvkX9uNraa	Last menstral period is not always an accurate way to determine how far along you are. If I went based on my LMP I would be 3 weeks farther along than I really am. The best way to tell is when they measure the baby on ultrasound.|`|uTEr67Bhaa	I have that you are 7 weeks pregnant.|`|WuVW9uCAaa	u would be due oct 24th ur almost 2 months
nxVGEKeUaa	I do feel you on this one, Cause it did seem like she kinda stole your shine, But at the same time try no to focus on that, Okay.. Just rejoice in your own baby with you and your husband. Spoil him/her rotten and don't let that with your sister stand in the way of the happiness that you felt when you found out you were pregnant. DO NOT HAVE A JOINT BABY SHOWER!!!!! that is like a wedding and it's the moms-to-be special day and all attention should be on you. And when she has hers the attention will be on her.  As far as your parents I think that they will love each one the same. And they will miss yours more because they will see hers all the time. So be happy for your sister just let her know that your pregnancy is your and her pregnancy is hers|`|58f00eb827abff12eac8ed561f2ced1aaa	I can understand why you feel slighted. BUT this is your baby #1!! First baby is -always- a big deal, honey! S he had been a mom for the past 10 years and you're a new mommy now. She will  have a lot of advice to give you about parenting, so make sure that you take it. You're 10 weeks and she is only 4 weeks so your babys will be more than a month apart! Your parents (and your husbands) will be THRILLED about your first bundle of joy. You have to understand that grandparents wont ever love one baby more than another. They will love them all equally. Dont be jealous, it will only stress you out. You just focus on your wonderful, happy news and dont let ANYTHING rain on your parade! Be kind to your sister and happy for her. Even though youre annoyed, think about this, you -inspired- her to want to have another child! Look to her for advice and comfort. My sister in law has TWO babies, one is 2, the other will be one. My husband's cousin has a 3 year old and a newborn and his other cousin has a 4 year old so we have TONS of babies in the family and Im sure that after we have ours in october, someone else wont be far behind but that means that our babys will have close relationships with cousins and we can all share in the hand-me-downs and fun of being parents together. Babies are a joy, regardless of age difference or anything. This is your FIRST so its your time to shine. Shine with dignity and grace. Good luck and congrats!!!|`|PyvVuFTOaa	Hmm . . . .|`|3505983107c631451310c5009361ae76aa	i can see where your coming from but try to be happy for her too. think about how much company both you're kids will have growing up. it might end up been better having someone else close to the same age as your baby. and i doubt your parents will favour one more than the other why would they. congrats and hope the rest of your pregnancy goes well|`|cNt0TDllaa	I understand my sister basically done the same thing she  already had a daughter and when I got pregnant with my first baby she had to get pregnant to they are like 7 weeks apart. Few years later I had my second child and guess what she got pregnant too they are 5 weeks apart. Your parents are going to be close to your child because its there first grandchild from you. Good Luck!|`|Tb8El1zuaa	Wow, quit being a baby. Be happy for your sister|`|DYJOpfvraa	She may have stole your spotlight and thunder momentarily but think about this- you will be having your first child which is so special and everyone around both of you will notice that. The reaction you sister will get will be of joy as well but it will not be the same, specially since she already has a child.<br>  When you finally have your child you will probably not care whether your nephew/niece has more attention because you will be too busy loving your child and enjoying every new milestone he/she reaches.<br>  <br>  I can see how frustrating it can be but try not to let it get to you otherwise you will not enjoy your pregnancy and more importantly motherhood.<br>  <br>  Best wishes!|`|AXEqOEloaa	I can understand your frustration but being pregnant is not about the attention, you are now blessed with something you tried so long for so you and your man deserve to be happy and not worry about what anyone else says or does.  As for the shower you need to have your own, and as for your parents I bet they spoil them all equally. Congratulations!|`|JkBbdg72aa	Well first off congradulation!!  I agree, I think your sister could be jealous of you being in the spot light. Don't let those thoughts take away any of the joy you are feeling in your pregnancy. Chances are that if she did it for that reason, and didn't think it through, she isn't really going to be prepared for another child. I also don't think it will make a difference with your parents favoring her child more. Good luck|`|ArkvdaPoaa	LOL, I think your pregnancy hormones are kicking in.  I am pretty sure that when your sister did that she probably had good intentions.  You should look at the good that comes out of this.  Your baby will have a playmate, and you and your sister could bond over things that both your babies do since they will be the same age.  And trust me your parents will love your child as much as they are going to love your sisters.|`|313f9383392249a5b1386591a7133716aa	You have issues if you are mad at your sister for something like this. Instead of being upset you should be happy for her. The coolest thing is the two of you will have a child around the same age. I think that is awesome. It sounds to me like you may be jealous of her. You should never be jealous of anyone. God does not want you to be jealous, but be happy for them. Get a grip and grow up. Just thinking that your parents may favor your sister's child over yours is selfish and wrong. To me you sound like a spoiled brat who is worried you will not be the center of attention.|`|uTEr67Bhaa	You really should try to enjoy being pregnant at the same time.  My sister and I are pregnant and only 5 weeks apart.  She was trying to conceive and I wasn't.  I found out I was pregnant and then not long after she found out.  It just seems like there is more for us to talk about and it seems like we are closer.  This is our 2nd for the both of us.  She is all the way in England (military) and I am here in the states.  My mom is so excited about both of us I don't think in any way she will favor one over the other.  I am 26 and my sister is 30.  Try to enjoy it.  It is a great thing for both of you.  This is your first so let it be a great thing that you have someone that you can share the experience with.  Just think of how close your kids are going to be.
AA10381258	From my understanding, your LMP is based on the first day of your last period. From then, you typically ovulate 10 - 14 days later, since your period lasts about 7 days. So your LMP dating usually is 10-14 days before your actual conception. You are right on track.|`|e93d483d323b7ea0e774d586db75f7d8aa	The ultrasound is more accurate than you LMP.|`|fAGTOJRZaa	Usually doctors go by early ultrasounds if they change the due date. I have a 49 day cycle but when I went to my first appointment they gave me a due date of July 5th (which was based on a 28 day cycle). If I would have based my due date off of a 49 day cycle it would have been the middle to end of July. When I had my ultrasound at 8 weeks (I thought at the time it was 10 weeks) they moved my due date all the way back to August 2nd. I couldn't believe they moved me so far back but they said early ultrasounds are the most accurate because babies haven't started growing at their own pace yet. She said in later ultrasounds babies grow at all different rates so it's harder to tell if they're just a little small or further behind.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|BsDv3k5iaa	My ultrasound measurement when I was 5 weeks pregnant was right on!!  I had my baby a day after my due date!

my4GD7YVaa	I would probably just stop and do a different bedtime routine, like read a book and take a bath or something like that.  It sounds like she may be self weening herself, which some babies do.  She is at an age where she doesn't really need breastmilk anymore, so I wouldn't be worried about this.  Im sorry that you have been bitten, but maybe its her way of telling you she doesn't need it anymore.|`|Yq3a6UAXaa	i know it's comforting for you and her to nurse until she falls asleep, but if i were you i would start a new bedtime routine and stick with it now!! otherwise the longer you wait the harder it will be :)|`|UuqnsLEfaa	You've caused a bit of a nursing "strike" because of your strong reaction -or at least to her it was strong.<br>  <br>  If you wanted to use this to force weaning or change your bedtime routine you certainly could but its not in the best interest of either of you to wean.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/bf/older-baby/biting.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/bf/older-baby/bi...</a><br>  If baby bites, it's not a good idea to scream or yell on purpose as a method to stop biting -- there are better ways to teach baby not to bite. Sometimes, of course, it's impossible not to yell in pain if baby catches you by surprise and/or bites hard. Sometimes yelling does stop baby from biting again; however, some babies think it's so funny that they continue to bite for the reaction, and other babies are so scared that they go on a nursing strike. The chance that this method will stop baby biting is simply not worth the problems it can cause. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.breastfeed-essentials.com/nursingstrike.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.breastfeed-essentials.com/nur...</a><br>  A nursing strike usually lasts just a few days but may persist for a week or two. Even though a lot of mothers do choose to wean during a strike, most babies can be coaxed back to the breast with some patience and determination. It may take some detective work to find the cause. All of the following are known to occasionally result in a strike: teething, illness, sores in the baby's mouth, a change in the taste of the milk, apprehension as a result of the mother's reaction to being bitten, prolonged separation between mother and baby, the frequent use of bottles or the pacifier, low milk supply, etc. Some lactation experts believe that a nursing strike can many times precede the baby's mastery of a developmental skill such as crawling, standing, or walking. And sometimes the cause is never known.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.llli.org/NB/NBNovDec92p173.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.llli.org/NB/NBNovDec92p173.ht...</a><br>  Possible Causes of a Nursing Strike<br>  <br>  Sometimes the cause of a nursing strike is obvious, but other times the mother may never discover the reason. Some common causes for a baby to refuse to nurse include:<br>  <br>      * mouth pain from teething, an injury, a cold sore, or a fungus infection, such as thrush,<br>      * an ear infection, which may cause pressure or pain while nursing,<br>      * pain while being held in the nursing position, perhaps due to an immunization or an injury,<br>      * a cold or stuffy nose that makes breathing difficult while nursing,<br>      * too many bottles, overuse of a pacifier, or frequent thumbsucking, which >may lead to a reduced milk supply,<br>      * regular distractions and interruptions while nursing,<br>      * an unusually long separation from mother. <br>  <br>  There may be situations or actions on the mother's part that contribute to a baby's refusal to nurse:<br>  <br>      * a strong reaction to a baby's bite,<br>      * a major change in routine, such as moving or traveling,<br>      * limiting and/or rigidly scheduling feedings,<br>      * talking in a loud voice or arguing with other family members while nursing,<br>      * overstimulation, stress, or tension from an overly full schedule or an upset in the home,<br>      * repeatedly putting off the baby when she wants to nurse or letting her cry. <br>  <br>  [...]<br>  <br>  No matter what its cause, a nursing strike is upsetting for everyone. The baby may be unhappy and difficult to calm. The mother may feel frustrated and upset and worry that her baby is rejecting her. She also may feel guilty, believing that her baby's refusal to nurse means she has done something wrong.<br>  <br>  Anne Monroe from North Carolina, whose daughter Meghan went on a five-day nursing strike at eight months, "felt terrible grief and rejection during the strike." Victoria Schnaufer from Pennsylvania, who weathered a ten-day nursing strike with her son Jonathan, says, "Until Jonathan went through a nursing strike at eleven months, I had no idea how emotionally stressful and physically draining this challenging breastfeeding situation could be. By the third or fourth day I was extremely frustrated and was becoming angry."<br>  <br>  Carol Strait found her mind racing when two-and-a-half month old Christie began refusing the breast. "A thousand thoughts ran through my mind—I must be eating the wrong foods, maybe she was teething, I was probably too nervous (what nursing mother wouldn't be nervous when her new baby suddenly refused to nurse?), perhaps she was weaning herself—and even the irrational thought that she didn't like me!"<br>  <br>  There are also physical considerations. As the baby misses feedings, the mother will soon become uncomfortable as her breasts fill up with milk. If her breasts become engorged, she will be at risk for a plugged duct or breast infection. And the baby still needs nourishment. Worries about how to feed the baby can add to the mother's upset.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Tips for surviving a strike to nurse again:<br>  <a href="http://www.drjaygordon.com/development/bf/striketips.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.drjaygordon.com/development/b...</a><br>  <br>  Nursing Strikes<br>  <a href="http://www.llli.org/NB/NBstrikes.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.llli.org/NB/NBstrikes.html</a>|`|F8iyUqJBaa	You don't have to stop.  What you might want to do is just nurse her on one side and then put her down.  My son does the same thing (almost 14 months).  When he does bite I say no more milk and just rock him to sleep.  He screams but then falls asleep.  I've heard people say to use nipple shields, but I just go natural<br>  She wont resent you, she is likely strong willed like my son and is just having a power struggle with you.|`|uMIvRRjoaa	Does she have her molars yet? Could be those are coming in and hurting her. As for the rest- it's only the end if you want it to be. If she's biting when you switch sides- don't switch sides! There's no reason to do so if she's content on the one side. <br>  Other tips<br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/bf/older-baby/biting.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/bf/older-baby/bi...</a><br>  <br>  Biting is not self weaning- that usually doesn't occur until 18 mos+ and happens gradually, not suddenly.

Sometimes our bodies are slow at producing the hcg causing us to get negatives for quite some time.  I was 5 weeks late for my period with my son when I finally got a positive.

7IkY8Wplaa	If your period is irregular, than most likely you are not ovulating on a regular schedule. It is very possible that after a miscarriage, it may take some time for the hormones in your body to become regular again.<br>  <br>  If your cycless are no longer every 28 days, than you are not ovulating exactly 14 days from the first day of your period. If your cycle is shorter than you may be ovulating earlier, if your cycle is longer, you may be ovulating later.|`|acj9mB9Paa	Your ovulation effects when your period comes.  Many people think it is the other way around.  But before you get your first period, you have your first ovulation.  The hormones from you ovulating is what starts the path to your period coming.  The time from your ovulation to your period is always the same.  It is called a luteal phase.  So if it is 14 days this month, it will be 14 days next month.  The time from your period to your ovulation can vary wildly.  Stress, travels, sickness any number of things can effect when you ovulate.  If you ovulate twice with no period it is REALLY time to see a doctor.  It usually means something is pretty wrong.  <br>  <br>  How do you actually know you are ovulating?  With the little test strips?  They are NOT definitive!  You can have a surge that causes you to be very close to ovulating, but just not quite enough to put you over the edge and it can show up in the strips as you having ovulated.  You need to take your basil body temperature to be sure, and even that is not 100%, but it is WAY closer to accurate than the test strips!  There is a book called "Taking Charge of Your Fertility" by Toni Weschler that you should read if you are TTC (or even if you are trying to AVOID pregnancy!).  SHe has all of this info and WAY more.  She shows you exactly how to track your fertility symptoms naturally and in the MOST accurate way possible!  Good luck and e-mail me if you need any more info!
e7aeb2cff39c63298f29417537101f03aa	Everyone is different with pcos. Some women have pain 24-7 some have bleeding for months. Others don't have a period or pain. Usually when you have a big cyst you may not ovulate. but yes it should go away on it own. Keep in mind we all get cysts each month its just most don't grow big. Small ones are not a problem. I skip a lot sometimes i don't get pain if i have skipped. Sometimes i do. Periods are different each month never know whats going to happen. If the cysts r not going by next cycle [if your doctor gives you a scan] Your doctor can give you something. I think BC pills help reduce the size of cysts. But usually they will go away on there own.

I personally enjoyed:<br>  <br>  One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest by Ken Kesey<br>  To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee<br>  and<br>  Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck<br>  <br>  As for science fiction.  I think you will like the Maximum Ride series by James Patterson [there is 4 in the series and they all start with Maximum Ride].  Also, check out My Sister's Keeper by Jodi Picoult, she is an amazing author.<br>  <br>  I like Angels Baby by Lauren Baratz-Logstead and of course The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants by Anne Brashares are young adult fiction classics.|`|jY31JaCeaa	read some books by Jodi Piccoult.

cadaf08b5e2b5ca7fea1ef6cb7035c53aa	Make up loads of spaghetti or casseroles, or stews and put them away in doubled zip lock baggies. Make sure the food is cold going in.  This is a space saver, and doesn't require a large outlay for glass freezer containers.   You won't have to do batch cooking forever, it's just handy the first few months.   You just want to cuddle and sleep between feedings.   <br>  <br>  If you want a bunch of great recipes feel free to email me,  alisongiggles@yahoo.ca   I have some supper tasty baby friendly ones that you can do in batches and freeze for later.    Like: Summer chicken and rice, hearty old fashioned stew, South Asian almond chicken. <br>  <br>  If you stay away from strong spices and limit your garlic/onion/pepper intake, baby will enjoy the flavour of your milk more.   Strong spices can make the milk bitter.  Season with fruit, and add some mango chutney, lemon, honey and almonds to sauted chicken, strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, green grapes, mandarins or any combo of fruit you enjoy, although I don't know if bananas would work here.  Add rice or noodles.  Salad on the side and you have a lovely freezable meal.  The sweet nature of the dish makes for yummy mummy.<br>  <br>  Congratulations!! :D|`|AA10381258	Honestly, I'm considering making some lasagna, chili, mac n cheese, stuff like that to freeze in individual portions so I can have a few really good meals quickly after my little girl arrives. Then there's also good snacks like cottage cheese, nuts, fruits and veggies, crackers. And for a quick meal, toasted cheese and tomato soup, a small stir fry, omelettes. There may be frozen convenience food in my future also, though I hope not.|`|3zZ6nyuRaa	well if you like tuna i have a great quick recipe. boil your favorite kind of noodles( i use the spirals). In a separate pot warm together 1 can of condensed cream of chicken soup, half of the empy can full of water, 1 small can of tuna and 1 tsp. garlic powder. salt and pepper to taste. strain noodles and combine both pots. Thats it. Super quick and easy, Ohhh and very yummy|`|xTsbN9YXaa	get gerber baby food and u say stock not stalk cause stalk is like a stalker....|`|WoolWKA9aa	Lasagne is always a good freeze ahead food.  You can portion it out, freeze it, and just heat up what you need.  I did this last weekend.  <br>  I actually made up some meatballs last weekend and froze them too.  I figured all I need is a little sauce and I have a meal.  Also, take your friends up on bringing food.  They will be a God-sent when you have that baby.  <br>  I plan to go to the store and stoke up on some of the Michelinas too so that when my hubby goes back to work, I will have something quick for lunch to heat up.  Those are pretty cheap.  May not be the healthiest, but I am sure I will be so tired at that point, I wont really care :-)|`|CkIeCNS4aa	I assume you're talking about meals for yourself.<br>  Go to the Campbell's Soup website - <a href="http://campbellskitchen.com/" rel="nofollow">http://campbellskitchen.com/</a><br>  <br>  They have tons of recipes using minimal ingredients.  Plus most of the recipes give options for ingredients you can add or not.  Everything I've tried has turned out really great.  Also, they're great for preparing ahead and freezing and then reheating.

When you be on a diet having a baby your constantly losing weight and there's not going to be room in the tummy when your losing weight. So if your pregnant don't be on a diet eat healthy like bananas, yogurt, juice or walk. Then you can eat a lil chips and candy but not too much.

You should be ready for the hospital just in case the contractions become stronger or your water breaks.  As for the tickets, I am not sure what to tell you, if you ebay them and you don't give birth you are going to beat yourself up over that.  :) Good Luck!!|`|no5cuRbtaa	just make sure that everything is ready, that your bag is packed etc... but don't go to hospital yet.  you can call there and the midwife will tell you the same thing.  you'll know the real contractions when they arrive - but you're probably in the first stage of labour.  good luck!!!

fAGTOJRZaa	Just before I took my pregnancy test I was having cramps so I thought for sure my period was coming. It never even occurred to me that I could be pregnant because it felt like a regular period. For a few days before I tested I was really tired and warm (I would wake up sweating). Finally I realized I hadn't gotten my period and tested and sure enough I was pregnant. I didn't have sore breasts, just my nipples were sore and I have been breaking out like crazy since I found out, my face AND my back!<br>  <br>  Good luck and baby dust your way!!<br>  <br>  If you do find out your pregnant go to the Whattoexpect.com. They have awesome message boards and you can talk to women who are at the same point in their pregnancy as you.|`|58f00eb827abff12eac8ed561f2ced1aaa	I cramped for the first several weeks (im 6 1/2 weeks now) If you miss your period, take a home preg. test!

obN6p3Cgaa	Tough decision........|`|F8iyUqJBaa	Good for you not believing in abortion.  I know it's horrible what that man did to you, but the baby should never be blamed by death.  You are wonderful to carry that baby and give it up for adoption.  Some people I've known have even decided to keep the baby realizing that it is also theirs, but adoption is just as good in this situation.  Don't worry about your boyfriend, you do what is right for you and your baby.  If you even think about an abortion go to you local pregnancy crisis center (not planned parenthood) and request an ultrasound.  Once you see that baby playing and moving around, you'll know you are playing with life and nothing less|`|SlBsJ3NRaa	Any guy who would say a rape is the victims fault doesn't deserve a boyfriend/girlfriend. I would  make my choice but leave the guy whatever choice I make. If you don't believe in abortion, give it up for adoption.

This is YOUR decision and if he can't understand what you want then he isn't a good guy for you to be with.  Get an abortion if and only if that is what you want and what you feel is right.

(this happened to me when i was 21)  You really need to do a adoption or keep the child. Don't let your bf tell you what to do. If you don't want to have an abortion DON"T. Please don't kill your child like I did It was the worst experience of my life!  I have 3 kids now and I'm 32 and I still wish I didn't do that.|`|rGjKC8Bcaa	Don't get an abortion. Give the baby it's chance in life. Your boyfriend is being a total jerk. Abortion is wrong and some people are trying to stop it. It's not your fault that your pregnant. Do good for the world and help populate it with just that one child.|`|Mw0eSZdTaa	Your decision to abort/ birth the baby will stick with you for the rest of your life. Boyfriends come and go (and yours sounds like a jackass btw).<br>  <br>  You sound pretty sane, be strong and make your own decision on what you want to do.|`|6ArhO4qvaa	YOU CAN DO AN OPEN ADOPTION THAT WAY YOU CAN STILL HAVE A RELATION SHIP WITH YOUR CHILD|`|08965f2b98bcd6a91a1ca8d6f7fc5944aa	I don't know why some people are saying things like "If you don't believe in abortions, then just have a miscarriage" - don't they realise that an abortion is just a medically-induced miscarriage, and that, even if you wanted to, it's actually very difficult to deliberately miscarry without putting your own life in serious danger! A medical abortion is the only safe way to end a pregnancy, if that was what you wanted to do.<br>  <br>  My advice would be, first of all, that your boyfriend is an idiot and you would be better off without him. Whatever you decide, him being so unsupportive is not going to help you get through this. He's not going to change, is he?! I know you probably care about him a lot, and it's difficult to end a relationship you've invested a lot in, but I'm not sure he really cares about you if he's being so insensitive. There is someone else out there who can treat you with the respect and love you deserve; your current boyfriend doesn't sound like he's worth wasting your time on.<br>  <br>  The second piece of advice is that you have to make whatever decision you feel you can live with. If you feel so strongly about abortion, then you are likely to find it difficult to cope if you decide to take that option. The "morals" of abortion are not the issue here - this is about you and if you won't be able to live with yourself if you have an abortion then you probably shouldn't have one. Even people who are pro-abortion often find it hard to deal with the emotional consequences of their abortions.<br>  <br>  However, and this is a big one, you have to think about how you might feel when you've carried the baby to full term. I have been through this with my son; I was considering giving him up for adoption but as soon as there was a "real baby" I couldn't go through with it. You have to think now about whether you could actually manage to raise this child if you find you can't give it up. This is likely to be particularly difficult given the circumstances under which it was conceived. Do you think you would be able to cope with a living reminder of your ordeal? Of course, there are women who are raped who go on to keep their children and manage perfectly well, but you need to have a good hard look at yourself and think about how well you would cope. Would your family be supportive if you decide to keep it?<br>  <br>  Whatever you do, don't let your boyfriend bully you into anything. Even if you don't split up with him now, he's clearly not going to be able to support you emotionally after the abortion. Whatever you decide, do it for yourself, not for him. If he won't support your choice then you really are better off without him.|`|ki3XY49daa	It is not a decision made lightly, that is for sure.  You have to take all things in to account before you make your decision.  If you do not believe that abortion is an answer, then you have two options open to you.  You can either carry the baby full term and keep it, or you can carry it full term and give it up for adoption.  Which choice you make depends on what you think you can live with.  I can't imagine having to make a choice like that.  You don't have much time to decide, but you must think about it seriously before you make your choice.  As far as the boyfriend is concerned, he has made it known where you stand with him and I think that he should be the least of your concerns.  I would reevaluate that relationship too.|`|AfmivW9zaa	Oh dont give in! please keep that baby alive.  That baby is still a part of you, give it up for adoption but please dont kill an innocent life. that baby didnt do anything to deserve to be killed. so good for you to be against abortions, so give it up for adoption, if your boyfriend isnt supporting you through this, hes not gonna be around for long. good luck sweetie.<br>  <br>  everyone deserves a chance at life.|`|JyUyQ42daa	Contact LDS Social Services.

I was scared my first pregnancy cause i was 20 yrs old not sure that i would be able to handle a baby, abortion came into mind but I couldnt do that! Now i have a beautiful 3 year old daughter and i cant imagine my life without her. I know you were hurt and this was forced upon you but just think that there is a reason you got pregnant. I believe everything happens for a reason and almost always something good comes from the bad. If i was in your situation i would stay pregnant and when your baby is born decide if he/she would be better off adopted. Dont end an Innocent life just cause a man wants you to! This is your body your life and that babies life. He has no say! that is just what i believe. Just really think about what you are doing and I wish you all the best. Sorry this happened to you! Good Luck!

EEWftDzRaa	I can't tell you exactly what do because every baby is different I can only share my experience. And I would also like to add that by you deciding to add cereal doesnt make you selfish or a bad parent. I really hate to see that you are asking for advice and there are people that want to make you feel guilty about adding a little cereal to your babies bottle. As a parent you know whats best for your baby and what it takes to keep them happy.<br>  My son is 5 weeks today. When he was born he was 22 inches and 8 lbs 6 oz. He was up to 3 to 4 oz of formula every 3 hours at 5 days old. I want to also add I had him at 41 weeks, which may explain his size and appetite. As he got older his appetite increases and he would be hungry at every 1.5 hours. As you can imagine we got no sleep. I decided to ignore the feeding recommendation which was up to 4oz for babies up to 4weeks, and he now has 5-6 oz a feeding every 3.5 to 4 hours and at night we do put single grain rice formula in his bottle. I have notice this reduces the spit up and he will sleep 6-7 hours. And yes he is five weeks.<br>   <br>   Now, about sleeping thru the night, 6 is probably as good as it gets for now. The older they get, the more they eat, the longer they sleep. <br>  <br>  Also, there is no "correct" amount of cereal to put in the bottle. Since my son was 4 weeks when we started with the cereal i only put a little in a 4 oz bottle just to introduce him to it (maybe a quarter scoop). the formula usually looks watery but i added just enough to have it at the same consistency of whole milk. After about 2 days i added a little more and now he has half a scoop in a 6 oz bottle (about the consistency of coffee creamer).<br>  <br>  Hope this helps, dont be afraid to follow your motherly instincts.|`|p2Njf5gBaa	This one hurts. I know sleep deprivation and the desire to get a good night's sleep very well. But this one just isn't true.<br>  <br>  Sleep patterns are developmental phenomenon, they don't have much to do with hunger patterns. Kids wake up hungry, but they don't wake up because they are hungry.<br>  <br>  Cereals started as an important part of a child's diet back when the infant formula companies couldn't get an absorbable form of iron into the formula.  They then fortified rice cereal with iron and introduced the rice cereal early into the diet as a way to make sure the kids got the iron.  Chances are pretty good that the eventual increase in sleeping at night that happens around six to eight weeks of age coincided with the introduction of the cereal, but not because of it.<br>  <br>  Now, all the infant formulas are fortified with iron and of course, breastmilk has an abundant and easily absorbable supply of iron in it, so we really don't need an extra source.  If you take away the iron in the cereals, it's just starch. <br>  <br>  And if you buy this idea that rice cereal "sits" in the stomach, then we have to talk about that too.  Nothing "sits" in the stomach (even when kids eat pennies and stuff, that stuff passes).  It's a metabolically active organ always working to digest its contents.<br>  <br>  And at least one study has recently showed that early introduction of rice cereal (prior to 4 months of age) is a risk factor for the development of diabetes.<br>  <br>  Different types of food take longer to digest.  Starch, which is what rice cereal is, is really easily digested.  Starches are used as quick sources of energy.  If we stayed asleep for however long our bellies are full (which I don't believe either or we would never sleep for 6-8 hours a night) then starch would be a poor choice.  We would need to load our kids up with a Big Mac or something to get them to sleep longer since fat is the slowest food type to be digested.<br>  <br>  That's a long explanation to say that I don't really think the cereals are necessary-- they aren't a good source of nutrition and they don't make kids sleep and may, with the new info on the link to diabetes, be actually be harmful.   The AAP says 6 months without solids...we are learning that the rush to solids foods is NOT a good idea.|`|qBtTAgBqaa	Your baby should only be getting formula or breastmilk until 4-6months. There is MORE nutritional value in a bottle of formula then there is in that cereal. If your baby went 6 hours without feeding, that might do more harm then good. At two months it's normal to feed every 3-4 hours. So by giving him that cereal, he could be missing a feeding he really needs.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.drgreene.com/21_861.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.drgreene.com/21_861.html</a><br>  You’ve heard about it from friends, parents, and in-laws. You’ve seen it in Internet chat rooms and discussion boards:<br>  <br>  “You’re so tired! You should put some cereal in your daughter’s bottle – then she’ll sleep through the night.” <br>  <br>  “He’ll nap better.” <br>  <br>  “Your son looks too skinny. You’re not feeding him enough. Add some cereal to the bottle – that’ll do the trick.” <br>  <br>  “He still acts hungry? Try putting some cereal in the bottle. He’ll be much less fussy.” <br>  <br>  “Spoon feeding is a hassle. Put it off as long as you can. Cereal in the bottle is quick, convenient, makes them sleep longer and cry less – what more could you want?” <br>  <br>  Your pediatrician says this is not wise (except as a treatment for reflux). Dietitians and nutritionists concur. Introducing solids before 4 months might cause food allergies. Your well-wishers discount these recommendations because cereal in the bottle worked wonders for their children! <br>  <br>  Throughout most of human history children were exclusively breast fed for the early months. During the previous generation or two, when bottle-feeding became very popular, rice cereal was often put into the bottle at a very early age. What were the results? <br>  <br>  Most children seemed to thrive. A small number of children, though, did not tolerate the addition, because their sucking and swallowing actions were not yet fully coordinated. They inhaled small amounts of the rice cereal into their lungs, which led to pulmonary problems. <br>  <br>  I’m much more concerned about a subtler issue. Babies are born with a wonderful mechanism for knowing how much food they need. During the early months, they take their cues from the volume of what they drink. Adding cereal derails this mechanism. It forces them to take in deceptively large amounts of calories. It teaches them to overeat. <br>  <br>  By starting with a spoon, resting between bites, and stopping when your child lets you know he’s full, you will be laying an excellent foundation for good eating habits throughout his life. <br>  <br>  A major study looking for the causes of obesity found that short-circuiting young children’s self-regulation of how much they eat is a major cause of later obesity.1 Cereal in the bottle does just that. <br>  <br>  Babies that are fed this way may appear to be unaffected – but those few weeks of added convenience may result in a lifetime of struggles with weight. This common practice may have contributed to our being the most obese generation in history. <br>  <br>  And it doesn’t even work. Scientists at the Cleveland Clinic studied the effect of cereal on sleep and found that adding the cereal did nothing at all to speed up the age of sleeping through the night. That first uninterrupted 6-hour stretch of sleep came no earlier in those who took cereal early.2<br>  <br>  People swear otherwise. I suspect the reason is that kids do fall asleep a bit more quickly, and some babies may even go a bit longer between feedings. There is no scientific evidence, though, to support the claim that cereal in the bottle will help an infant increase total sleep or decrease crying.3<br>  <br>  Drawing on the wisdom of experience and the latest scientific knowledge, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends against adding cereal to the bottle. It may be tempting after your 16th straight sleep-deprived night to cut a bigger hole in the feeding nipple to add rice cereal. But it won’t offer lasting help, and it may be giving your baby a lasting gift that both of you will regret.|`|my4GD7YVaa	i know you want to sleep,but you aren't really supposed to give your baby rice cereal until four months.  Also really the only purpose for it at that time is to start getting them used to eating solids.  <br>  Also, a baby that young is not supposed to sleep more than 6 hours at night. I know its hard because you want to sleep, but its just how things are.  My daughter is almost 7 months and still doesn't sleep longer than 6 hours at night.|`|AA11918778	rice cereal should not be given to a baby under 4 months old.

Its common to have this dream pre-period when your baby making chemistry is in full swing. You're not ready to have a baby, and it's obvious you know that, because you're dreaming about the pregnancy not that actual act of motherhood. Also, since you're still young and pubescent, your mind may be molding to fit in with what you're body is experiencing with the blossoming of all these new hormones. Pregnancy dreams are not about sex (hence the absences of a male figure) rather the growth of the female form. This isn't a dream of premonition, simply the fact you're healthy and are on a normal path toward maturation. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps! :)|`|TiDAjndPaa	if you've been thinking about it alot lately, that could make you have dreams about it, but obviously you aren't REALLY pregnant. Freud would have a good explanation, but they threw his theories out the window a while ago.

Be glad your dad is around to fight off boys otherwise you'll end up pregnant..<br>  Kidding.<br>  <br>  Dreams are your mind's way of processing information. Like others have said, you probably read, saw or heard about pregnancy recently. And dreams often don't really portray what it was you see. For instance if someone has a dream that their husband cheated on them with their sister... the dreamer should take a minute before even getting out of bed and think "what qualities does my sister have that would attract my husband" not "oh my god my husband is sleeping with my sister."<br>  Basically think of how your pregnancy dream makes you feel. Does it make you feel happy and loved? Does it make you fear something? Does it make you feel complete, scared, worried? Take any and all feelings you have in the dream and think about situations going on right now. <br>  For instance you say you haven't had your monthly cycle since November.. maybe your body is hinting at you that, if you ever do want kids, becoming a healthy weight to go through womanhood is the place to start.<br>  <br>  Or.. you could of just had a dream.
sYNyNFOWaa	I do believe it is highly selfish and no thought or consideration has gone into the future that the child will have. I also think it's highly unethical how much older women are allowed to have that artificial insemination process done. <br>  Life has enough twists and turns in it already. Why take away a child's quality of life because of another persons own selfish desires.<br>  No-one wants too bury their parents at a young age, and no-one wants too leave behind a disabled child with the possibility that there will be no-one there to care for them properly when they are gone.<br>  Which I believe people who are feeling maternal in their older years should be encouraged too foster or adopt children.|`|AA11148769	It depends on the situation (and I don't mean to offend anyone, kay?).  If a woman put off having children to "further her career", and when she's in her 40's and decides that she's now ready to have a baby, then yes, I believe that that is very selfish.  It puts not only the mother in jepordy, but the baby also!  The chances of having a Down's Syndrome baby skyrocket!  <br>  <br>  On the other hand, if a woman doesn't meet her husband until she's in her late 30's, early 40's, (not because she's "forwarding her career", but because she genuinely didn't meet the love of her life until then), then I can understand that.  <br>  <br>  There's so many other options too when you are older - like adopting for instance.  I can't understand why anyone would want to have a baby when they are in their 40's or 50's.  Let's face it, pregnancy is hell, kids are hard to keep up with (even for me, and I'm an in-shape little mommy in my early 20's and have lots of energy).  Not to mention that they'll be in their 60's when their child turns 18 and most likely won't see their grandchildren grow up.  <br>  <br>  I don't know - it's all up to the individual.|`|SM3bgzeWaa	Do you think it's stupid for a 16 year old to have a child?  You know the risks for poverty are increased.<br>  <br>  Do you think it's stupid for a single parent to have a child?  You know the risks for the child not finishing school are increased.<br>  <br>  Do you think it's stupid for a couple who are having marital problems to have a child?  You know the odds that the child will become the victom of divorce and therefore be at risk for all sorts of emotional issues.<br>  <br>  Do you think it's stupid for a couple who live in Mississippi to have a child?  I believe the obesity rates are very high there.  The child would be at greater risk for obesity and possibly diabetes and all sorts of other health issues.<br>  <br>  ............and so on...and so on.....and so on.<br>  <br>  Do you know the exact circumstances of the lady with the autistic child?  Was it a planned pregnancy or a surprise?  Would you judgement be different in either situation?  <br>  <br>  Finally, don't pass judgement on others.  You don't know everything.  The older you get, the more you will realize this fact.|`|Q8wDjvZ1aa	there are tons of risk factors for children born to women who wait until they are older to have babies.  in my opinion the worst of those is leaving your kids without a parent.  my mom was an 'afterthought' baby, younger than her siblings by a min of 14 yrs. my grandmother was in her 40's.   my mom's mom died when my mom was 19 because she was in her 60's and had failing health.  while other people had their mom at their college grad, and wedding, and see the birth of their children, my mom missed having her mom there for those things.   i think the bad far outweighs the good in this situation, but it still seems to be a rising trend today because women want a career first and baby second.|`|tBtOTiQDaa	no, if she wan'ts a kid  then she can have it,<br>  did you know that its safe for women to have children from 20 to menopause? (shock. horror.)<br>  no, there is no "hieghtened chance" of autism, or DS, or whatever, and even if there is, then so what? is a child not a child? a blessing that is to be loved?|`|r7Lnsergaa	Well, that would be a very sad situation.

I think it is stupid. <br>  <br>  If you have kids after that age where the risk are higher then you are being an idiot.|`|gyYXV3Bxaa	No I don't.  Just because the risks increase doesn't mean they will happen.  <br>  <br>  I think it's selfish for people under 18 years old with no job to get pregnant.  What kind of life are they going to provide for the child?|`|tDU347knaa	I think you're thinking of Down Syndrome. Women over the age of 35 have an increased risk of giving birth to a child with Down Syndrome.<br>  <br>  As for autism, the older the age of the father at the time of birth, the higher the chances of the offspring to have autism. In fathers who were 40 years or older, the risk for autism was almost six times higher than in the offspring of fathers who were younger than 30 years of age.|`|6PhSENcXaa	My sister and two of my sister in law had children in the mid to late 40's and none to the kids were autistic.  My sister had 3 in her 40's and my sister in law had 2 in her 40's none of them had autism.  My neighbor's daughter who is 20 years has two children now and both of them are autistic.  Age that have a baby has nothing to do with autism. I looked into it because of my brother's son having autism not knowing much about it. His son is the 24 year that I talk about below.<br>  <br>  My nephew who is 24 years old and has autism and he is working full time and has his own apartment.  He is living a great life and is very happy. He met a girl who loves him to no end, she's 25 years old and things have been going great with the both of them.  So just because a person has autism doesn't mean its the end of the world for them.  I know of about 36 women who have had babies in their late 40's early 50 and none of those children have autism...|`|OI3bf4yjaa	Yes, I think it's  very selfish and idiotic. Especially when they have been TOLD that there is a risk of autism. I guess they only hear what they want to hear.. and that's wanting to have a baby. It's sad.|`|fvuEtkROaa	After the age of 35, there is a marked increase in Down syndrome, too.   I would not want to chance it if I already had a healthy child.|`|bC5XeVEIaa	Honestly, I believe that any woman who has a child to fill some personal void in her heart without considering the life that the child will be forced to endure is selfish.

But, you need to get things done on your own.  I started using a baby bjorn when my baby was about that age because our house was a disaster and nothing was getting done.  It is true that if you hold your baby ALL the time she'll most likely become attached to you and be hard to please.  Now, there really isn't much wrong with that unless you are having to send her to a daycare or babysitter in the future. <br>  <br>  Bottom line, don't feel guilty and get your stuff done!  As long as she isn't crying and in distress, I'm sure she's just fine|`|AA11598254	Yes I do!!  I have a 2 year old and a 9 week old when I was pregnant I was worried that my 2 year old wouldn't get as much attention but it turns out that he takes most of my attention.  My poor 9 week old gets maybe an hour or two a day of "Mommy and Jake time"  I really stinks, and some days I feel like a bad mom.  I just take comfort in the fact that the time I do spend with the baby is Quality bonding time.  Relax you have to take care of yourself to. If Mommy isn't happy baby isn't happy so take a bath pay your bills eat something with two hands!|`|F6lZHRkVaa	Well think of this way: your baby needs to learn independence. You're teaching your child that it's okay for her to be by herself for short amounts of time. The fact that she can still see you is good reinforcement for her - she'll spend these first few months knowing that mommy keeps a watchful eye over her but that it's okay to move around by herself. <br>  <br>  I laid my baby on the floor regularly from birth and would let him stare at his toys while I straightened up or cleaned the room around him. He started crawling at 4 months and walked at 7 months. Had I held him 24/7, he wouldn't have had the opportunity to do these things.<br>  <br>  So take a deep breath and relax. You're giving your child the opportunity to learn on their own. And it's okay to put her on the floor sometimes too and just sit back and watch what she does. It's going to help raise an independent child who isn't afraid of the world - and that's always a plus.|`|Cx5Zo7IIaa	I don't feel bad when I have to put my daughter down and go do something but I also have a sling that I put her in frequently so she can be "held" by mommy and i can still get things done. I make dinner with her "papoosed" on my back every night.
YVasdve0aa	At this age she won't get attached too much.  We didn't want a pacifier either but when our son was colicky we changed our tune.  He used one for the first 11 weeks and then we took it away.  We used it sparingly.  A baby's natural way to calm themselves is to suck on something.  So at this age it isn't a bad idea.  You can also introduce her to sucking her own thumb.  This will help later.  When she wakes in the middle of the night she can calm herself faster than if she was searching for a pacifier.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	I'd give her a pacifier. You might as well - at the point that she's sucking on your finger all the time, a pacifier is just a finger which isn't attached to you and which you can sterilise.<br>  <br>  Some kids just like to suck.|`|SjX72fPyaa	That was all that could calm my daughter until we could get her home to give her a pacifier. Some babies are just suckers. Mine was, she was sucking her thumb immediately after she was born lol. I don't think it would be much of a problem to give her a pacifier if its just to get her to sleep. <br>  We did that with Aisling and she never needed her pacifier during the day and now shes 5 months and she spits hers out at night now too.

s8VgyzE2aa	Your situation is not normal to be honest, I mean seriously, where did these little kids get these pictures? Not a lot of parental supervision going on somewhere. <br>  <br>  In most cases children that age are not going to seeing pictures like that. I have 4 boys and none of them have ever come across someone who showed them things like that at such a young age. <br>  <br>  In any case, discussing sex isn't something you just do one day. You start when they are young talking about things with age appropriate details. You start with the differences between boys and girls, you talk about how the body changes during puberty, etc... you follow your child's cues and ask if they have any questions and you answer all questions honestly with age appropriate details. <br>  <br>  You don't go and explain oral sex to a 7 yr old just in case some other kid shows them a photo of it because that is very unlikely. And if anyone ever did, I would be on the phone with the school, bus company, other parent, whoever dropped the ball because at age 7 someone did.<br>  <br>  EDIT: And unlike others are suggesting, you don't wait until they ask questions, that's ridiculous. Once they start asking questions it means they've already heard about it. You want to be the biggest influence. You start the conversations by asking them what they know and then adding what you would like to discuss in age appropriate details. The parent has to open the lines of communication first so the child will feel comfortable asking them questions at some point and discussing these issues. If you just sit back and wait until they come to you, it won't happen, that is when kids will go to friends and others because they won't have that open line of communication already built with you. <br>  <br>  And remember there is no magic age, discussing sex isn't just about intercourse and oral sex and all that, it's about discussing puberty and changing you go through, love and relationships, etc...|`|SnQvsOPwaa	Answer the questions as they come up like you did. At ten they should have a general knowledge but not detailed. I think the important thing is that your kids know what they learn from friends and such is wrong and they need to come to you to clarify what they have heard.|`|397b528338dbd9036ae6de0f84b8f817aa	us girls are trouble makers I guess. I would be talking to these girls' mothers and maybe even social services. Alot of times that kind of acting out is a sign of sexual abuse.<br>  <br>  I explained sex and how a women gets pregnant as much as I had to to my 7 year old step daughter when I was pregnant and she had a million questions|`|prqrQcd1aa	I don't think that it should be based on age honestly. I think it should be done on a "as needed" basis in cases like your own.. otherwise, it should happen when the child is showing the first signs of puberty!|`|Cx5Zo7IIaa	You have to have age appropriate responses to their questions, as they mature your answers will have more depth to them and then having the bid talk with them at 12 or 13 won't be any big deal just more details they didn't know before. <br>  Where is your kid getting exposed tp this stuff? I would go talk to that child's parents and tell them I don't appreciatee my child being told about this that way, it's for a parents to explain not for a child to explain to another child.|`|P544Sbmqaa	I think by the time they start school they should atleast know basic things like proper anatomical names, the difference between good/bad touch, and the basics of how babies are made and what sex is.  <br>  <br>  I have this stance because I know that if I dont, someone else will.  I would far rather they hear these things from me and know from early on that they can talk about it.  If for no other reason, so that I know the information they are getting is accurate. <br>  <br>  I encourage you to go look through the men's and women's health sections here on answers.  They are FULL of kids (mostly tweens and teens, but often there are many that are younger) asking questions and passing around false information and myths as truths.  If nothing else, I want my child to know the facts.<br>  <br>  As they get older, they will be ready for more, I mean, obviously keep it age appropriate.  However, I do think a child in school should know the very basics.|`|qwExCj0Yaa	sorry but that's sorta how it happens these days, at least in public schools. I am 16 and I found out about sex when I was around 8, from a kid at school who was also a girl, not sure why that is. I'd say an appropriate age would be before they hit puberty, so you can emphasize using a condom. Other than that it is up to you.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	When my little one asked me where babies come from, I explain to her.<br>  No point pussyfooting around it.|`|Y3DR1EBUaa	I think if u dont tell them that is what leads to EXPLORING later, i think at 10  may be right but also it depends on there maturity|`|AA11537580	I would be more concerned about that little girl!<br>  where did she get her information, was she abused?|`|2JKt3Nkqaa	10-12 but I learnt by my worst teacher in year 4 :(|`|KlWWh3fgaa	I plan on having talks like this as soon as my daughter can understand what I'm talking about, like 3/4 .... it shouldn't be just one big embarrassing talk. It should consist of little talks from day one (obviously not day one, but you know what I mean) ... They deserve to be awear of the human body, and should be awear of whats right and wrong like :: good touching & bad touching. 5 is a good age to stat. Continue with them, and help him be more comfortable & awear of what he has been told & what he has been shown. I'd start with you 7 year old too ...
J3H3C5ksaa	There are three options.<br>  <br>  One, go with it.<br>  <br>  Two, rebel.<br>  <br>  Three, sit down & tell them. <br>  <br>  I suggest two or three. Although sometimes two is more effective.<br>  That's what I did. Except my parents wouldn't allow me out with my friends 'cause of COURSE I'll get murdered & raped, with a group of ten and during the day and with a cell phone. Of course. Lol. I stopped eating & gave them the silent treatment & went out anyways.<br>  <br>  So, they were really pissed, but finally let me go, but after my grounding. =P<br>  <br>  Maybe sit yours down and say, "Mom, Dad, I love you & I know you love me, but I'd appreciate it if you didn't know everything about me. <br>  Or force everything out of me. I know you're tryring to protect me, but <br>  I'm fourteen & responsible. I'd like it if you trusted me."|`|e2cf497fb8528f8c556d43e9580066c5aa	I thought my parents were over protective. <br>  Maybe you've behaved in ways that made them the way they are. <br>  If you were a good girl from the beginning, then you should stand up for yourself and speak up. <br>  If you were a bad girl in the past, act mature and responsible in a way that would prove to your parents that you are a reliable kid. <br>  My parents are strict about curfews, where I'm going, and what I'm doing with whom, but in the end, whatever I do, my parents ALWAYS trust me. They know I wouldn't do anything stupid.|`|TaFrxxJXaa	wow. I would talk to a school counselur b/c  I think that can actually be a form of abuse. I feel like I've heard it called that before.|`|jY31JaCeaa	that sounds REALLy awful.  I'm sorry.  Maybe you could write them a letter saying how you really feel.|`|0VkZ70f2aa	holy shitttt! move out NOW! you'll never learn in the real world|`|q3mLfg2yaa	my parents do the same thing and tell me I'm a failure every time i don't tell them something.  they don't let me do anything! what i do is enjoy myself and be myself at school.  all of my friends than question why I'm so happy at school and i ignore them. you need to get help talk to someone.  talking makes me feel better. maybe it will do the same for you.  good luck!<br>  <br>  btw I'm 14 and go to the most prestigious school in my state|`|4CMx1uzXaa	This is borderlining on abuse.... get out of there and speak to a trusted adult. <br>  This really pisses me off with some parents- they think they have total control over their children- just when are they gonna realise it does much more harm than good! <br>  <br>  No its not right whatsoever and dont feel as if you are being a nuisance because you havethe right- and freedom of speech. <br>  If they dont like it tell them to shove it.|`|MPiOoulraa	Ok this is not normal. Your parents are way to protective. They shouldn't know everything about you personal life and they're threatening you this is not ok.|`|28QPS6V9aa	Well if they can read everything that you type they will be able to read this question so it should get the ball rolling. Just talk with them about it and ask them for a little more space.|`|2SScKK2Gaa	It is not okay for them to do this.|`|RFzKP7MGaa	all i can say is stand up for yourself, if you dont it will oonly get worse|`|Or6mIS96aa	My parents do the same thing!!!!! they think you still need them ugh|`|RNkQ9qPQaa	Sounds to me like you are a child on the verge of becoming mature enough to handle your own affairs. The only thing wrong with that is the responsibilities that go with the word mature. The include but are not limitted to: Rent, Food, Clothing, Heat, Shelter, Water, Computer, Transportation, Medical expenses, Recreational Monies, etc etc etc. As long as your parents are providing all of these for you then they have the right and duty to be in charge of you life. Give it a few years and you will appreciate what they are doing for you. I do mean, " Doing for you" not " Doing to you, as you seem to see it ". Some young people would love to have someone who cared enough to do these things for them. Give it a few years, Maturity will finally take over your way of thinking.|`|htBI9XNpaa	i think the computer issue is about right, because they just want to protect you from the weirdos out there, you hear of so many horror stories. you need to make a compromise with them that you will give them the password etc but only if the promise to only look at it if they feel there could be a problem. can i ask what is so secret in your emails and if you cant have emails the how have you got a yahoo account without them knowing?????|`|KlkUj6uFaa	You're parents definitely sound way over protective, but do you give them any reasons not to trust you? If you don't, trying being serious one day and ask them both for a chat, and try to explain in a mature way how it makes you feel. No guarantees it will work, but atleast they'd know how it affects you.
E6obQSpraa	Hi there,<br>  <br>  Im not sure it means the level of hormone is increasing, but you wont ovulate till approx 12 - 24 hrs after the control line matches the test line, or it is darker in colour.  You need to ignore any tests which are faint, as that is still negative.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps hun xxxxxx|`|oHNrktxTaa	Yes, It means that your hormone levels are slightly increasing as you get closer to ovulation.<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK:)))|`|ObngKaoWaa	not necessarily,until u dont get a line as dark or darker than the test,u dont have a lhj surge.just to be sure though,keep testing everyday preferable twice a day,once after 10am and once before 10pm.and ofcourse,u can start BD as soon as u want.better doin it everyday than missing out on the big "O" (ovulation).
r7q8LW7Aaa	It sounds normal, and it will only ever come out when you squeeze it until your real milk comes in. Do you mean the skin seems cracked? Are they dry? If not, then it's completely normal. If they are dry, some vaseline or lanolin cream will help.|`|mXB6vy6xaa	I'm not a woman, but I am a father and also a Medical Anthropologist.<br>  A few years ago I conducted a research project on Breastfeeding pros and cons.  <br>  Every woman's body is unique to that individual, but the basic structure and bodily processes are the same unless you have a medical condition, and that changes everything.  Your OB GYN is the one who can make that call, but from what you described I don't think you have anything to worry about.<br>  Also, just about every hospital now days has a Lactation Nurse on staff to assist anyone who needs help with breastfeeding, and they are a valuable resource you should take advantage of.<br>  Good Luck.|`|9b579e5d0c20c6295a54289ea1d57053aa	Normal breasts look like they have cracks inthe nipples. This is where the milk is going to come out. You may have crusty milk on them already and once the baby is sucking on them it will come out like regulat milk. I had this too where you could squeeze it out. Just leave it alone and all will be fine. Our boobs are wonderful things aren't they!|`|PbBWJGsTaa	That's exactly what it's supposed to look like.  You'll be fine.|`|8d89b255ad0cc448257f013c1fb8f3a8aa	That's what mine look like! It kind of looks like cracks, which hurt really bad at first, but the pain eventually goes away, and for me the "cracks" are still there.
3X0t8JrXaa	Sounds like you're doing well...at 14 weeks the whole morning sickness (on average) is gone or leaving.  As far as that nerve jumping...lol...thats the baby.  As the weeks go on you'll feel more defined movements where you'll be like "whoa baby!"...kicks will become way more obvious...happened for me close to 19 weeks.|`|VmqOq8Qjaa	yes, it differs from person to person and how you are built  as a woman(skinny or well rounded) I feel it every so often as well and I'm 17 going on 18 weeks :)|`|9b579e5d0c20c6295a54289ea1d57053aa	Yes this is all fine. Every woman is different so your experience may differ then someone else's but your are like mine. I have 2 boys and both pregnancies I did not have any sickness. I was blessed!!! The only thing that was consistant with both is that towards the end my feet and ancles swelled up so bad I could hardly walk. I had to get hubby to rub my feet every night. So make sure you have a foot rubber lined up to run your aching feet and ancles...lol. Good luck with your pregnancy and all this is nornal. The little twitches you are feeling are probably your baby. You won't feel it every day until the baby gets bigger but this is your baby moving around. Isn't it a wonderful feeling. Soon you'll be getting kicks and jabs and saumer saults in there, so what out!|`|3505983107c631451310c5009361ae76aa	ya if it feels like little flutters in your stomach its probably the baby. it wouldn't be very big yet so it would be hard to feel it move all the time so it is ok that you only feel it every few days. give it another few weeks and you will feel it all the time :) congrats and good luck|`|AA10458750	oh enjoy being 14 weeks....it was such a lovely time for me, so much energy, being able to sleep most the night, relaxed...you are feeling "flutters" this is not gas, it's the baby moving but it will take another month for you to really feel anything.|`|mFEevGRXaa	if you are only 14 weeks i am guessing that it isn't your baby moving. some people mistake gas as baby movement, believe me you will know when it moves, its the greatest feeling!!

el8yX5q3aa	Who says it is normal?  Just because character and the inability to control immediate gratification does not mean normal.  It means immature and not being taught that having sex too early can lead to many unplanned pregnancies..more expense for everyone who has to raise them (meaning welfare)..teen age fathers not learning responsiblity to pay for their child..it means more STDS and that can lead to death.<br>  <br>  What is normal about that?   Only a child can ask this question...one without the ability to think for themselves and looking for an excuse to have sex and make sense of it.<br>  <br>  With sex comes responsibility.  Not for just you but the other person...caring about them and their feelings....and their emotions.  Sex is emotional...and many people get hurt by thinking sex is love.  IT IS NOT!  Responsibility for having sex is not just using birth control or having condoms.....it is a personal thing...an inner growth of who you are and who you are with.  It is NOT RECREATIONAL....<br>  <br>  It is normal when you are adults....and understand life experience and consequences....not when you are a teen and use it to satisfy your hormones.<br>  <br>  If children were taught to pay attention to honoring those they are with and respecting them...and stick to studying we wouldn't be so dumbed down in America /or have so many unplanned pregnancies with single mom's.  The boys get off of the responsibility of a newborn....so they don't care.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	The statistics are that it's normal at age 18 to have your first full sexual experience, before then and after then it's abnormal.   So, technically it's a teenager but in working practice it's an adult.|`|1KGXts5Daa	for this particular question, you should replace the word "normal" with "typical".<br>  <br>  if you were to do so, then yes - it is typical for people to begin sexual contact in their teens (by majority) and therefore, "atypical" (the minority of individuals) to begin sexual contact at age 20 or above.<br>  <br>  however, both are considered "normal" behavior in western culture (on the whole, allowing for certain dissent amongst sub-sets of population) assuming that there are no issues having to do with legal consent, etc.|`|ggFUW3Kvaa	no, it means they have good morales<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AmrKWD1CKDXdqfgZTnf8crjsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090307052857AAa1i9n">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|5nfqY9T7aa	Sex is normal and natural, but so is abstinence.

I feel like i will get more out of life by waiting. <br>  <br>  So i say virgins are normal :)|`|HolJ834Haa	absolutely not. <br>  not normal at all you see..<br>  people such as teenager love sexual activities as they are tend to go something out of ordinary like having sex...<br>  and parents; who are supposed to prevent this issue are likely to blessed their children with doing that.. which are so wrong.<br>  the virgins are strong and holy; although their attitude didn't shows any of it...<br>  at least they could hold their lust..|`|orGvWwhBaa	Everybody should do it when they are good and ready.

AuTmKSjVaa	Following an evening of high flirtation and an abhorrent amount of gin, Lucy my housemaid has found herself in the family way. However, my wife and I will bring the infant up as our own, and have decided to name the child "Mistake" or is this a bit obvious? 'Mishap' maybe?<br>  We did consider the name 'Balls', as we wanted a catchy sort of name.<br>  Do you think 'Balls' creates that effect?|`|tZt7fUYYaa	I named her Lily Anne Amani Smith.

D:<br>  <br>  My mother wants me to name my first born son Gunther so she can call him Gunny. I hate that name with a passion.<br>  <br>  The names I've been debating are Zane, Seth, Damian, Konan, Karin (pronounced like 'car in'), Hannah, Rain, and Lyric. I know that's kind of a lot to choose from, but the name will of course depend on whether or not my first child is a boy or a girl so that narrows it down. And I'm still only 16, so I'll have plenty of time pick an exact one. :D<br>  <br>  Why? Well, Keely is the name of a good friend of mine actually. I'm considering it in honour of her. <br>  <br>  No real reason as to why I'm considering the rest. I just happen to really like them. :D|`|SjX72fPyaa	I've already had my first child and I named her Aisling. <br>  I've loved the name for years and I've always wanted my children to have Irish names since I am Irish. <br>  Oh and because it means Vision, Dream<br>  <br>  And for my first boy I would want to name him Connor. Just another Irish name that I've always loved. My boyfriend prefers Aiden for a boy though. Which I like as well :) And its also Irish so that works with what I originally wanted ;)<br>  Connor means Wolf Lover and Aiden means Little Fire|`|8pup9oWhaa	I've never wanted to give my children names that I consider to be boring or common. I want my children to be the only kids in their class with that name. But that doesnt mean I like odd, made up names.<br>  <br>  For our daughter, we named her Nora Marie. Its a very old fashioned name, and alot of people say to me "thats my grandmothers name" I love it when people say this.<br>  Nora's name means "light", and when I found that out when I was still pregnant, I knew that was the kind of name I wanted for my daughter. She really is the light of my life!<br>  Marie is my middle name, and my mums middle name, it goes well with Nora, and reminds me of my mum when I say Nora's full name.|`|ROJans2Taa	I named my first Brianna, mainly because it was the only name me and my husband could agree on, if it had been completely my choice, she would have been Savannah, only because Ive loved that name since I was 10|`|8kaDm2D8aa	i wanted a name that ment "princess," but i wanted something different.  so, i found the name zaria.  her middle names are olivia & nicole, those are both of her aunts names.|`|wsCBo2Zkaa	I have two names for a boy and a girl.

The young doctor looking after Steve Martin's women was a confident young female doctor called Megan.  Steve's character smirked when he found out the name of this doctor because it was such a new age name to him, and because of her obvious youth and inexperience, but was later inspired by her abilities so he ended up picking this name for his newborn daughter.  <br>  <br>  Years later we were onto a long road of fertility problems, I remember dreaming about having a little baby girl called Megan.  Quite a few times actually, and it reminded me of that movie.  I guess it was a premonition because soon I fell pregnant and discovered I was having a girl.  <br>  <br>  There was absolutely no debate between my husband and I over what name to give this baby girl.|`|EuB8C9Ojaa	I always wanted to have a boy named Dexter and a girl named dee dee :) <br>  Weirdly enough, my wife doesn't like the idea so we thought to give him the name Michael - Michaels tend to be very sociable ad I like to call him , Mike, Mikey, Mikezilla.

As for the girl, I would call her Selena - cause it speaks mystery and smexyness|`|3cpa6ZX5aa	I'm currently expecting my 6th and he is going to be called Tristan Jared after Jared Padalecki (Jared is Jared Tristan so my son is his name backwards). I have twin sons named Dean & Sam (i love the TV Show Supernatural) and my 3 daughters are called Anne, Jane & Catherine after all 6 of Henry VIII's wives. I'm named after his daughter with Anne Boleyn, Elizabeth. I love anything to do with Henry VIII and Supernatural so that's why i named my children after them all!|`|6nn7f41Faa	We named her Zoe Delenda Jade. My husband didn't want children, so as he became more attached to the pregnancy, I decided that I would let him have the first and middle name. He had always loved the name Zoe and decided that if he ever did have daughter, that would be her name. So she became Zoe. Delenda came from the title of an album by his favourite band that was released the same day we had the positive test. I always loved the name Jade, so I threw that in there too.|`|z6IekuwSaa	My hubs and I made a deal, I name if it's a boy he names if it's a girl.<br>  We had a girl. He chose Abigail Nicole. He chose it because he had remembered me saying I liked the name at some point in our relationship and he wanted to name her after me so he gave her my middle name. I didn't have the heart to tell him I didn't like it because it was so sweet. But now that we have her, she is soooo an Abigail and I love the name and the effort my hubs put into deciding her name|`|PCxDTT0paa	My husband and I decided on Liam Chevy..<br>  <br>  Liam due to the fact it is not all too common and unique-it's a good name to grow old with..<br>  <br>  Chevy due to my husband says he knows we have a little football player and his nickname could be "Big Block Chevy"|`|gQEtEtLQaa	If I ever have a son, I'd like to call him Tristan.

I was told to give her iron supplements three times a day, but after doing a lot of research I decided not to. The side effects of the iron seemed too severe since her iron levels were not very low, and she has a very delicate tummy!<br>  <br>  Instead I decided to give her a combination of iron-rich and vitamin C-rich foods. She does not eat a lot, but she does like to feed herself little bits here and there whenever I eat, so I just made sure all of the little bits had iron or vitamin C. She insists on feeding herself - even things you need a spoon for!<br>  <br>  Sierra had just started eating solid foods the week she turned 6 months, just over a month before this happened. She was barely eating at the time we were going through all of this. She was eating about 1 tablespoon of food per day total when we started, and by the time we finished she was up to almost 2 tablespoons per day.<br>  <br>  Her diet consists of cheerios, avocado, all kinds of fresh veggie chunks & fresh fruit chunks, fried potatoes, fried tofu chunks, iron-fortified oatmeal (now with molasses), homemade rice cereal cookies, and soy yogurt. But it is still mostly breastmilk since she still nurses every two hours.<br>  <br>  Well, we got her re-tested after 5 weeks (aged 8 months, 2 weeks). She is no longer anemic - I just found out. I am so happy!! Ironically, I almost caved and went and bought iron drops Saturday because she took a one hour nap two days in a row (she normally takes no more than a 10 or 15 minute nap) and I was convinced it was the anemia! Anyway, her levels are now normal. Her new level is 10.4 (10.2 is normal). I am amazed that we could get it up that much in such a short time with diet alone, considering how little she eats. I am going to continue giving her foods high in iron and vitamin C since I would like her numbers to be higher and she likes what she eats. Besides, I think a healthy diet in the first few years is exceptionally important and she has one healthy diet - I wish I ate so well!<br>  <br>  I am so happy that it worked out without the iron drops! And I know Sierra would be too, if she had known about them! <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.babyreference.com/BeyondBreastmilk.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.babyreference.com/BeyondBreas...</a><br>  There is generally NO reason to feed<br>  grains early<br>  ????No reason to feed sweet fruit sauces and<br>  the like<br>  ????Only dark colored veggies, beans or meat<br>  and fish can hold a candle to breastmilk’s<br>  nutrition<br>  ????Eggs are wonderful, and yolks only or<br>  complete egg can be tried before age one<br>  in a non-allergic family<br>  <br>  ????Salmon is great: zinc, iron, selenium,<br>  retinol, omega 3’s, high-quality<br>  protein (fish allergies are more common<br>  in adults)<br>  ????A diet of broccoli, carrots, peas,<br>  walnutbutter & eggs or meat might<br>  not pale too badly in comparison to<br>  breastmilk nutritionally<br>  <br>  ????Salmon is great: zinc, iron, selenium,<br>  retinol, omega 3’s, high-quality<br>  protein (fish allergies are more common<br>  in adults)<br>  ????A diet of broccoli, carrots, peas,<br>  walnutbutter & eggs or meat might<br>  not pale too badly in comparison to<br>  breastmilk nutritionally|`|AA11615232	Well i dont have any kids or anythingg..<br>  but im the oldest out of 5 kids and i have a cousin thats 2.<br>  <br>  The cereal is necessary.  Its got some of the things that the baby needs. Cheerios are good too.. but babies cant really eat as much of those as they could baby cereal.  <br>  What my mom and my aunt have done to have the kids eat it, is add some formula.  My aunt would always premix formula and keep it in her fridge.  Her son would eat it that way.  Another thing you could do is add baby fruits or vegetables.<br>  Another idea is getting some of the gerber, or some other brand, dehydrated fruit pieces to put in it.<br>  Good Luck! (:|`|Z7V7AbBQaa	I was told by a dietitian when my daughter was anemic that instead of Cheerios (1 cup is 45% for iron)  to give her Nutrios by Heinz since 1 cup has 100% for the recommended daily amount of iron. I was also told that when giving foods high in iron to give a food or juice with vitamin C (an apple juice with added vitamin c is what my daughter liked best) to help improve the iron absorption.<br>  <a href="http://www.heinzbaby.com/english/products/toddler_foods.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.heinzbaby.com/english/product...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.heinzbaby.com/nutrition_facts/toddler/toddler_cereal_nu_trios.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.heinzbaby.com/nutrition_facts...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/cheerios" rel="nofollow">http://www.answers.com/topic/cheerios</a>|`|hu3u5ap3aa	Is there another hypoallergenic formula that you could find than has a higher level of iron in it? Have you tried the multigrain baby cereal  and add baby jar fruit that she likes to it? Have you started her on any green veggies yet? They usually have a little more iron levels in them. You also said that you are still breastfeeding her. Have you increased your iron to help increase the levels in your milk? <br>  <br>  Best of luck and keep up with her nutrios, there are little bite size baby puffs I called them that were either fruit or veggie that are high in iron too.<br>  <br>  Keep trying and don't give up!|`|r7q8LW7Aaa	Well I wonder how people got on before baby cereals were invented? They used the adult stuff - or found iron from other sources. Your baby doesn't need specifically baby cereals, but try to increase other iron-rich foods. You already know about red meats and cereals (and Cheerios are great for iron - so is weetabix), perhaps increase the leafy green veg if she'll eat it? If you mix it with something sweeter it may be more appealing to her.<br>  As you say, she is only just under normal levels, so it's not a huge problem. Is she a very sleepy baby? Very pale? If not, then she's getting by fine without the added iron.|`|z6IekuwSaa	My Doc told me the same thing, since they don't absorb iron well. I mix mine with avocados and breastmilk. I dunno if that'll work. I know what you mean about breastmilk, I'm soooo stingy with it lol. I only like to use it in her bottle!|`|ndO6MiQaaa	to b honest id start giving her beans in patatoes she is old enough to eat all meals she needs iorn to keep her strong also try porridge|`|AA12198742	I do not have children but what about putting some Total or a cereal that is high in iron in the blender with milk and a bit of fruit juice to make it like an enriched smoothie?  If your little one likes oj or apple juice, those might be good options to try... Also there are vitamin enriched drinks like Ensure (that's the adult one- I don't remember what the children's one is called). Check with the ped to see if those options might work instead.|`|Ka52nbhNaa	I would ask the doctor if there are other ways for her to get iron - Enfamil makes vitamin drops to help with Vitamin D and some also contain iron . . . this might be a good option.  They are called Tri Vi Sol with iron:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.enfamil.com/app/iwp/enfamil/productDetail.do?dm=enf&id=/Consumer_Home2/Enf_Products/ForInfants/EnfamilTriViSol2&iwpst=B2C&ls=0&csred=1&r=3413898748" rel="nofollow">http://www.enfamil.com/app/iwp/enfamil/p...</a><br>  <br>  My twins will only eat their cereal if I mix it with formula and a bit of apple juice.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|ay8tXLD2aa	Yes, I would think that Cheerios are an okay cereal.  You could also try something like Weetabix as it is also iron fortified. She may even like to self feed Shreddies that are soggy!?  Chicken and beef have high levels of iron, but iron is best absorbed when it is eaten with vitamin C.  So try chicken and sweet potatoes, for instance. It will help her absorb the iron better. <br>  <br>  In the UK, 3 out of 5 babies between 6months and one year are iron deficient.  Not that it makes it okay, but just so you know you aren't alone!  I would go with something like the above, and then have her iron levels tested again in a month and see how she's getting on.|`|my4GD7YVaa	are you mixing the cereal with breastmilk or just water??  This can make a huge difference. My daughter won't have anything to do with cereal unless its warm and mixed with booby juice, as we call it : )<br>  I think if you doc tells you that you need the cereal, then it is necessary. I know its really hard when they don't want to eat something, but you just have to keep giving it to them. if you try to give her the cereal and she won't take it, so you give her what she wants... she is going to learn that all she has to do is push it away or whatever and you willl give her what she really wants.<br>  I know this stuff is frustrating, but I would just keep trying and trying, eventually she will give in. Its for her own good!|`|bfc067ab537555ada57edd464a8dfb97aa	Try adding carrots to the cereal. <br>  My baby never ate cereal with fruit.

16b3340f6b3002b4cd5a1b38e48064f1aa	well does the child look seriously overweight?  How tall is she?  I have 7 yr. old twin boys (almost 8) and the "skinnier" one of them is 48" tall and weighs 54lbs, the other one is pretty average: 60lbs and couple inches taller.  They both only wear a size 7-8 in tops at Children's Place, and still a size 6 in pants.  That's really strange that a kid who's 60-62lbs needs a size 12!<br>  <br>  either way, it's not a good idea for you to try to tell them there's a problem with the kid's weight.  Asthma is a reason to be careful about physical activity, but she doesn't need to be sedentary.  I would just encourage the kid to be healthy when you're babysitting.  Try to only serve healthy snacks, don't let her eat all day.  Take her for a nice long walk|`|CsIwiZRoaa	wait is she like fat or something?  i mean 60 pounds doesnt sound it but i guess she is short. i was a childs size 12 in 8th grade so im sure she is growing way too fast or eating wrong. but shes six, so shell grow out of her baby fat i guess|`|LbDoNsQqaa	that is really freaky a child at 6 in size 12 maybe the kid likes calcium like miwk (sorry i love the word miwk not milk milk sounds boring)any how yeah the kid probably has a growth disorder like dwarfs only the other way round|`|aOCfLAJJaa	Size 12?

nQyJFOMZaa	I think it is different for all women.. I gained about 30lbs while pregnant. But when I got pregnant I was about 20lbs more than I usually weigh. I lost about 22lbs when my son was 3 weeks old so all but 7lbs of my pregnancy weight. Now he is 5 months old and I still haven't lost another ounce (he is still exclusively breastfed) I have tried eating healthy and exercise nothing seems to work. I hope that the weight comes off when I wean him.|`|YVasdve0aa	Breastfeeding burn calories so yes it helps but it really depends on what you are eating also.  I will say that with a first pregnancy most people regain their figure relatively quickly as compared to a second pregnancy.  With each pregnancy you gain more body fat and your stomach gets stretched out more.  There is also a slight drop in metabolism with each pregnancy too.  This makes it harder to loose weight after each child.  On the plus side, it may take longer to get it back off but eventually if you stick to it you will regain the figure you want.|`|6Ak0kDtKaa	i am breastfeeding and pumping (2x more then my baby needs) and after 3 months i have still not lost weight. I was disappointed. I think its becuase breasfteeding makes me hungry so i dont think it makes a differents (from my personal experience). But i will continue breastfeeding becuase its best for the child.|`|r7q8LW7Aaa	Breastfeeding stimulates the release of oxytocin which causes the uterus to contract - so it's a form of exercise! It burns up to 700-800 calories a day so yes it does help you lose weight. Weight loss usually is different after each child, regardless of feeding differences.|`|3I3Thz6waa	I gained 26lbs when I was pregnant, and by week 2 post partum I had lost 20 pounds. Now as for those pesky  last 6 pounds, they have been virtually impossible to budge, and I breastfeed. I'm now 12 weeks post partum and still haven't been able to lose weight even with increased activity. I'm eating well to maintain the nutrition and quantity of my milk supply and I just haven't been able to lose more. Even though I'm 6 pounds away from my pre-pregnancy weight, my body looks NOTHING like it did before I was pregnant. My stomach is no longer flat, I have a little pouch that won't go away! and my hips and upper arms are so much fuller. I highly doubt the 6 pounds would actually make that big of a difference in my appearance. It looks like I need to lose A LOT more than 6 pounds to even remotely look like what I did before I was pregnant.|`|AiJeS6I1aa	My good friend had so much difficulty losing weight after her baby (her 1st).  She breastfed exclusively for the first 6 months, then continued as a supplement until 2 years.  She feels that she did not start to lose weight until about a year after the birth, associate with a significant decrease in breastfeeding.<br>  <br>  However, she has always struggled with her weight.  Also, she started a serious diet and exercise program at this time.  I think that she would have had the same weight pattern if she had breastfed or bottle fed.<br>  <br>  On a good note, she now looks and feels fantastic!  She is more fit than she has ever been.  She runs 2-3 times per week and does precision figure skating.  She watches what she eats.  It has not been easy for her.|`|soFzO7C2aa	ABSOLUTELY! I am in a parenting class at a university around here and in my parenting class it was shown you can lose weight not only faster but all the baby weight you gained and more. Plus, breast feeding creates an intimate bond with you and you baby and increases their immune system with antibodies. Breast fed babies are more likely to have learning disorders as well.|`|2lpDlLLsaa	It sure does help, I am almost back to pre-pregnancy weight and my baby is 6 weeks!|`|8d89b255ad0cc448257f013c1fb8f3a8aa	I don't have anything to compare it to, but I've lost all but about 10 lbs. of the 40 I gained during pregnancy and my daughter's almost 3 weeks old. The first 2 weeks I was just breastfeeding and basically lying around, recuperating, then I started taking walks every day. So it seems to me like breastfeeding must be helping, but I'm not sure, this is my first baby!|`|V8wUAVdyaa	ooooh yeah.  I had Noah 7 weeks ago and I'm only 2 pounds away from my pre-pregnancy weight!  I'm guessing its the breastfeeding thats doing it because I haven't dieted or excercized at all.

6nn7f41Faa	Each sperm is "coded" with an X or Y chromosome. Each egg is "coded" with an X chromosome. When the sperm fertilizes the egg, it becomes either XX or XY. XX is a girl and XY is a boy. The gender is decided at conception, and there is nothing that can change that (with the exception of gender reassignment surgery and hormones).<br>  <br>  Oh, and the "parts" begin to grow before 16 weeks. They actually begin to develop around week 11. We found out at 14 weeks that our son was a boy.|`|l79QIWszaa	Everyone is right about the sperm having decided the gender of the baby.  But it can't always be told what gender the baby is via ultrasound.  Sometimes girls grow boys parts and other times the umbilical cord can look like a penis.  I think it's just better not to find out!  I'd be devestated to take my baby boy home in pink clothing!!!|`|Mwb5UkPBaa	It's a boy from the moment it's conceived. It's a girl from the moment it's conceived. Even before they have the part they are still the sex they were at conception(being conceived.) The father actually determines what sex the baby is when his sperm cell hits an egg with either an X or Y chromosome.|`|hOGckhAuaa	gender is decided at conception|`|58f00eb827abff12eac8ed561f2ced1aaa	the fetus's genes knows at conception weather or not it will be a boy or girl. It's in the DNA right away.|`|ROJans2Taa	the sperm decides so as soon as you conceive it;s already pre determined, it all depends if the girl sperm or boy sperm made it in the egg first|`|98WKYtfwaa	The females egg is X and men have X sperm and Y sperm, if the Y sperm reaches the egg it will be a boy, if the X sperm reaches the egg it'll be a girl.<br>  <br>  The sperm determines the sex of the baby, and as soon as conception has happened the baby already has its gender, the genitals just take a bit of time to develop, then seeing them on the screen is hard at such an early stage, most sonographers wait until you're 18-20weeks gestation before telling you the sex of your baby because they have less chance of getting it wrong.|`|i8Ch743Laa	Yes,it depends on what chromosomes that the cell has,it's got an X or a Y chromosome. Long story. I know that that crap about sixteen weeks,totally false. I found out I was having a boy with my last pregnancy at 13 weeks,and he was a boy.|`|ZA3N1wE4aa	Gender is determined at the moment of conception. As soon as the sperm meets the egg, gender is determined and will stay the way it is.|`|0vpDDM8aaa	its the chromosomes that decide that...and the chromosomes are pretty much there from day one :o)

vGxipYJnaa	Some people smoke their whole lives and die of non-smoking related causes.. so it's not exactly a death sentence but it isn't healthy.<br>  <br>  A lot of moms and dads drink beer or wine and that's mostly okay in moderation. I think you should talk to them about smoking and tell them all of the things you know about it. Maybe they're not sure of all the dangers.|`|OI3bf4yjaa	As much as you're going to hate hearing this... there is really no way to make them quit. It is their body, their life.. so they can choose what they wanna do with it. If you're that concerned and worried for them, just sit down and talk to them. I remember being a teenager and my father used to smoke and drink ALOT, and I was scared for his health. I remember sitting down with him and telling him that I love him too much to see him put his own body through hell. You don't necessarily have to say that exact same thing to your parents, but it can be along the lines of it. You love them, of course you don't want to see them do this to themselves! Try writing them a letter or a poem... I'm sure once they realize how much it hurts you to see them do this, they'll ATLEAST stop doing it infront of you, or even try and cut back. And death is never certain! My dad has been smoking for over 70 years, and he's still here today.. thank God!<br>   I do wish you the best of luck|`|aCUHzMrmaa	Have you asked them?  Tell them you care about them and dont want anything to happen.  I've known people that smoked every day of their life and lived to be old, then i've known others that had health problems and stuff like that.  It really is their choice to do that so you cant stop them, but just try and talk to them.|`|jdXhRGpcaa	you have to just talk to them i know its hard but i got my mom to stop and they might die around 40-50 it all depends some people live to 90 and smoke 3 packs a day sense 14 so you cant really tell|`|sbtVDHG8aa	im 13 and i smoke a half a pack a day. my cigs are expensive tho so im planning to quit<br>  <br>  mine<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090306170756AALExeK">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>
kaqPSgTVaa	You are most likely not pregnant. It's very rare to bleed a normal flow in pregnancy. Take a test to make yourself feel better but it's unlikely.
GMsiKRQVaa	Sorry girl, you are pregnant.<br>  <br>  Stress can cause a period to be late, or non-existent. <br>  <br>  But a positive result, is very hard to be wrong about that.<br>  <br>  Seek a more accurate test and start to make your plans.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|cj7sSPZEaa	Stress doesn't cause a positive test, pregnancy does.|`|VmqOq8Qjaa	first off have you had sex?|`|a12cbnR4aa	You are pregnant. It may have been too early to test positive at the doctors office. If you have had two positive hpt then you are most likely pregnant. It is extremely rare to have a false positive hpt.|`|nISYAHkfaa	Nope, you're pregnant if you had a positive test and have been missing your period. There's pretty much no other explanation.|`|H2IhRXIIaa	Your pregnant|`|duinadV4aa	your pregnant girl good luck|`|AA10381258	Pregnancy tests measure a hormone called hcg that is only present during pregnancy. With two positive tests, you are positively pregnant. Stress will cause a late period, but not pregnancy hormones. It sounds like the first test at your doctors office was taken too early to detect the hcg, but the levels rise throughout your pregnancy, thus the two positives later. Time to head back to the doctors office.|`|iPsFTNivaa	Sorry dear.  It sounds like you just might be pregnant.  Neither a pap, or stress, will cause a positive pregnancy test.  And cramps are a common symptom with early pregnancy.  You need to talk with your mom and go see your doctor to confirm the pregnancy.  Best of luck!|`|3505983107c631451310c5009361ae76aa	well stress can have something to do with your period been late but it wouldn't make a test come out positive so more than likely you are pregnant. if you want to be a 100% go to your doctor for a blood test and this will tell you for definite. good luck|`|cNt0TDllaa	I don't think stress could cause the tests to show positive cause they read your hormone level. So I think you are pregnant.|`|mFEevGRXaa	2 positive tests!! then yes you are pregnant.  a positive test is usually not wrong.  good luck!|`|WGXdfh22aa	stress wouldnt cause a pregnancy test to come out positive. it sounds like you could be pregnant.|`|61wXpXVxaa	no hun ur pregnant|`|Zvk9qyqqaa	your pregnant babe

F6lZHRkVaa	It's more harmful in the first trimester. But overall, an occasional glass of wine doesn't hurt, and when I say occasionally I mean like one glass every couple of months throughout pregnancy. Ask your doctor about this. In cases of FAS, the mothers usually drank multiple alcoholic drinks every day. It takes a lot to harm a fetus, they've very protected in there. Even the whole 'crackbaby' phenom was overblown. Talk to your doctor before having a drink while pregnant.|`|58f00eb827abff12eac8ed561f2ced1aaa	right away...sometimes even right before she gets pregnant.

YCuXeEvdaa	I have a twin brother we are both 13 we both enjoy burping farting competitions you see boys are more comfortable with tough conditions, I know burping and farting will not kill you but the smell of a fart or burp is pretty strong.<br>  I admit it we are not mature and most of guys are not but you should say thanks to God he is doing drugs or smoking or something like that'|`|CdJtH0xdaa	That is a generalization; not all boys think burping and farting is funny. That's like me saying why do all girls care about how they look, when in fact not all girls care about how they look.<br>  Anyway, the reason they do find it funny is because they're thriteen-years-old. They don't know how to act mature, as they're still very young. After a few years, they'll eventually stop burping and farting, and they'll stop laughing at it. Until then, you just have to roll with it. You can't expect much more from young teenagers.<br>   <br>  Good luck to you|`|C1spuRsZaa	Are you kidding?<br>  <br>  I'm a 24 year old female and I think farting and burping is hilarious. They are natural bodily functions that shouldn't be looked down on. Women can be so uptight about things that are so natural!!! I'm not saying fart in front of your boss or burp in front of your fiancee<br>  's parents.....but, omg...lighten up and be a little free at heart....life is too short to be like "omg, like, farting and burping is sooooo totally disgusting!!!" *flips hair*|`|wJv71qjTaa	They aren't mature yet. I have a 16 year old brother who still thinks its funny. They don't grow out of it.|`|sKTmxnx1aa	I don't know!  My dad and brothers think it's hilarious, but I just think it's disgusting!  I mean come on, it smells!|`|aRCKguzDaa	idk. me and my friends made a theory that boys arent mature until there 51. then they become inmature again at 52 :)|`|TaFrxxJXaa	idk but its so STUPID. <br>  <br>  And f-ing annoying...lol|`|yIdwMPsoaa	they not mature yet, give them time;)<br>  <br>  people in my class that r 15-16 still find it funny soh|`|qpmGLd7laa	I've never thought it was funny, just disgusting.|`|r7q8LW7Aaa	They never grow out of it - my husband is 30 and still sniggers at farts and burps.<br>  Boys never grow up, they just get older.|`|VlmRTuhgaa	Boys will be boys.

My boobs didn't feel any different during pregnancy except towards the last couple of months when they began to grow and feel firmer.|`|58f00eb827abff12eac8ed561f2ced1aaa	well, sucking on breasts generally makes them tender. I seriously doubt that she is pregnant. If you're worried, do a home preg test.|`|XRLbqtUbaa	Nipples are sensitive and it could be u sucking on them that made her sore...not necessarily pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Mine became sensitive after a few months, but for everyone symptoms r different.|`|VmqOq8Qjaa	Pregnancy boobs are very tender, but many of the symptoms of pregnancy are the same as a woman starting her period.|`|3505983107c631451310c5009361ae76aa	when your pregnant your boobs get soar and feel very tender. but in your case just sounds like you were a bit rough with her :)|`|vY0ScgeXaa	hard to tell<br>  <br>  they should feel augmented and swelling or something

1VdgsZPoaa	Just be there, if she wants to talk let her come to you and be open.  Discuss it with her, share your feelings and don't hold back.  Don't be afraid to cry.  If she doesn't want to talk, don't make her.  Just be there to hold her if she needs someone to hold her, or give her space if that is what she wants.<br>  <br>  I lost a baby at 9 weeks and I know how it is, it's tough and it was my partner I wanted more then ever.  So just be there for her :)|`|HhXQnSznaa	Make sure you are there for her because she'll need you more than ever.|`|aCUHzMrmaa	Go to counseling|`|FiUprYsvaa	Just be there and comfort her.|`|DnNkCF6Taa	You need to go to counseling but not only that but you should be with her and spend time with her.

I had to go to councelling and my I needed my family so much more at that time.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	I am sorry to hear about your loss.  for me what helped me when i miscarried - you dont say how far along your gf was - time.  i had to allow myself time to heal and grieve.  i lost a baby.  a baby that had a future in my mind, that i pictured holding and loving.  it wasn't easy.  any of the times i miscarried.  it lessened over the passage of time.  even after 2 healthy kids and years between me and my last miscarriage there are still times when i feel the emotions from it.  not as strong or as long as when it first happened, but the sadness for what wasn't is still there.<br>  there is no right or wrong way to grieve.  what feels right for you and her is right for you guys.  <br>  good luck!|`|MAicuZUGaa	there isn't anything to do, it's just a sad time. sometimes, crappy things just happen.

You can support her in whatever she decides to do and everyone needs to butt out and let her make her own decision.|`|T3OGT4Ntaa	At this stage it sounds like she's not even giving the guy the chance to do anything to help.

Why should she have to bear all the responsibility?<br>  <br>  He, being in a relationship and having a career makes no difference. He was an equal partner in the making of the baby and he should take half of the responsibility.<br>  <br>  The other factor is that in the eyes of the law he probably has a legal right to know that he is going to be the father of a baby.<br>  <br>  I have seen cases where a father-to-be has successfully sued the mother who had the foetus aborted.<br>  <br>  There is a lot to be considered her and I don't think that your lovely friend should be burying her head in the sand but whatever it takes, she should be letting him know. He has a right to know.
tSEA42Uraa	I absolutely hate matching names, or names starting with the same letter. It shows that the parents think of their children as a part of a cute little set, instead of individual people that will grow up some day. If it's a tradition, use middle names with the same letter.<br>  <br>  I'd prefer it as Kacio and Talia, pronounced the same as Kalia, just with a T.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  ~Emily-Maria|`|6m6LjAVNaa	Smooth No!<br>  Annoying.cheesy.trendy,totally made up--- Yes!<br>  Names that always must be explained because of "different" spellings are because they are made up in hopes of being unique ,are not at all!!<br>  There is no reason to give a child this type of handicap for their whole lives,there is no good reason to misspell or improperly use names for children!<br>  A child can be talented and known if their names are simple even like Samuel or Robert or Daniel or Raymond for boys or for girls Stephanie or Robyn or Cassandra or Natalie or Alyssa but name a child something off the wall like Rattlesnake or Ocean or Orchid they are just known as the kid with that crappy name!<br>  Please reconsider it is important,kids deserve real names,gender appropriate and correctly spelled ,why make life harder than it already is? Good luck!|`|qXq0nmBzaa	1) "K" names are NEVER smooth--they always sound harsh<br>  2) You know your choices are less than optimal if you need to provide a phonics lesson right off the bat<br>  3) they appear to be someone's idea of yoo-neek in that they almost-kinda' sound Arabic but really aren't.<br>  4) matchy names pose so many problems for sibs: people don't take the time to tell which is which. Their names become a "whatever" situation.<br>  <br>  So, NO, these are the opposite of smooth names.<br>  <br>  Sorry if this is blunt but it's meant to be constructive.|`|pZ7B7VFcaa	oooh i love Kalia <br>  <br>  dont know about Kacio but Kalia is great name <br>  <br>  also can br pronounced Kal-yah|`|iyEYXiq8aa	Sorry I don't like them because they aren't my style but they flow well.|`|v6r8R6izaa	I also think that a name start with a "K" always meant to replace "C".<br>  I named my baby girl Clelia coz it will be weird (I think) if I name her Klelia.

rhPCJfeuaa	Well not so much my mother.  Definitely my MIL.  We were extremely close during the many years her son and I dated.  I was the daughter she never had.  we got along great even after her son and I got married.  She was awesome during the 5 years we tried for a child, too.  But everything changed when I had my first child, my daughter.  She suddenly became very competitive with me to do things with my daughter before I could experience them.  She picked on my parenting style and would make comments to her son about it.  My daughter was a really bad sleeper when she was an infant.  Lots of belly issues that eventually got diagnosed as an allergy to milk protein.  Probably went undiagnosed for silent acid reflux, which my son had as an infant.  I didn't believe in the CIO method.  I thought it cruel.  she offered to hire someone to keep me out of my daughter's room.  I told her that no agency would charge enough to have to deal with the hurting I would put on someone if they didn't let me near my child.  It has been like this for 5 years.  she also doesn't treat my 2 yr old son the same as my daughter.  It's subtle, but noticeable, and they will eventually realize it and possibly resent each other.  My husband doesn't understand why she has become like this.  she'll comment that I'm too easy on them and that we should let them cry, and then turn around and complain when I discipline.  I am very strict, so everyone thinks she's lost her mind.  she never lets my daughter cry.<br>  <br>  I think they need to feel more important than they are and need to make us feel less confident by offering their "help."  <br>  <br>  Just try to ignore her and do your thing.  If you think it would help (it might since she's your mom) try sitting down with her and telling her how you feel.  That you need her support not her second guessing of your every move as a mother.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!  I feel your frustration!|`|F6lZHRkVaa	My mom is the same way. During my pregnancy it bothered me so much I uninvited her to witness the birth. We didn't talk for the first month after my baby was born.<br>  <br>  But now, I've learned to just accept it. My mom has always been a know-it-all, it just seems to hurt more when she's a know-it-all where it concerns my parenting. But I shrug it off. I love her, and I love that she loves her grandson. So I let her words go in one ear and out the other.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	You need to sit down with her and have a talk about. I appreciate your advise but can you only give it when I ask. But of course phrased much nicer.|`|1tmX7xbRaa	well actually my mom has become rather detached from me lately...we used to be really close (she was my best friend) and now it's almost like me (and my kids who she always wanted to see) don't exist so on the mom front i don't feel that way HOWEVER <br>  my father drives me crazy!!!! he was never the type of guy to take care of kids (even when me and my brother were small he pawned us off on our grandmother) but now that my kids are here he calls me minimum twice a day and is always telling me how to do things asking me if im watching the babies... and im like no the dog is! but anyway i get what you are saying i just feel this way about my dad. there are times where he irritates me so badly that i am on the phone with my husband in tears ready to pull our my hair (or rip off his head). it's like i think i got the hang of it. i know what you are saying.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	Hey, I hear you sister.<br>  I live nearly half way across the country from my mother and she still manages to do that.<br>  Few days ago she called just to see if I was up to date on my daughters baby shots.<br>  I was like "Mom. She is 5. Of course I am up to date on BABY shots"<br>  And she goes "Well, you would lose your head if it wasn't screwed on" I actually hung up on her.<br>  One day she told me, she wished I had never moved away, and I was like aww how sweet, till she followed it with, "At least then I could keep an eye and make sure your taking care of that baby"<br>  Don't get me wrong, I love her but sometimes I wanna ring her neck|`|j2mRop0laa	She sounds like my mom. I actually think my mom was living through me and wishing she could make up for things from my own childhood- and also having extreme fantasies (such as telling me to wait on my children hand and foot).<br>  My oldest is ten and my mother is still at it. If my daughter so much as makes a grunt, my mom will say "You better get her a drink, a pillow and a vitamin. You better take her temperature. You better close that window/door, turn off the fan, lower the lights and do effing jumping jacks." <br>  She drives me insane. I have developed something called rudeness. Have you heard of it? lol<br>  Just roll your eyes and walk away.
ZDMUW1YRaa	All pregnancies are different, you are still definitely pregnant, you are ust lucky! no yucky symptoms, in my book What to Expect when your expecting many woman are concerned about lack of feelign pregnant and the book assures you taht you dont always have typical symptoms and that it's nothign to worry about.  I don't feel pregnant either besides food cravings. But i'm definitely pregnant.  Don't worry it will be okay.  Check wtih your Ob sbout the meds.  Or look up the drug class catagory that your pills are under A and B are safe, C shows some harm to fetus but no definitive studies have been completeld, D is bad for the fetus adn I think the only other one is X which is detrimental|`|i8Ch743Laa	It's totally normal to have no symptoms yet. I would talk to the dr about the meds for eczema,but I know my dr put me on a cream to put on it when it pops out,and I was told it shouldn't have any effect.|`|R8qooymyaa	I didnt have any symptoms at all apart from a positive test!!! and im 5 weeks :) x|`|QHGCq9hKaa	You shouldnt wait until you start to get the symptoms of pregnancy before you take your test. Your medications might not be good for the baby. You should take a home pregnancy test atleast. <br>  I didnt have any symptoms at first. I just new I was "late". <br>  Turned out I was 9 weeks
DDYwnut6aa	In a healthy, fertile couple, there is a 20-25% chance of conception each cycle - and that is with perfect ovulation/intercourse timing.  It can take up to and beyond a year for such a couple to successfully conceive.  Most doctors will want you to try for at least 1 year (charting and being sure you're having intercourse when you are most fertile) before investigating for problems in either partner.  (6 months if you're over 35.)  <br>  <br>  If you go to <a href="http://www.fertilityfriend.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.fertilityfriend.com</a> you will find a free online charting course that will teach you about your body's fertility signs and how to chart your cycles to maximize your chances.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you!|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	Most women get pregnant within a year of trying.  If you haven't had any success after trying for a year, you and your partner should both be checked by your doctors for fertility problems.|`|7e9bce7df6b13d448cd20f1bff3d3cf3aa	As long as it takes is the answer I'm afraid!!<br>  <br>  Healthy eating, not smoking, cutting down on drinking and less stress will all increase your chances of pregnancy however, if you feel that there might be 'something wrong' visit your GP who can do tests to see if there really is a problem or you both just have to be patient.<br>  <br>  Good luck, hope all works out for you.|`|3MDY29gnaa	It takes most healthy couples at least a year. If it doesnt happen visit your doctor for some test. Ttc can be a stressfuk time so stay relaxed. It wont always happen the first time. Dont have sex a chore with your DH enjoy it! Good Luck.|`|kLK2peV1aa	uh. sperm dies after three days of not being fertilized and visual signs will come by week five or six (slight signs) within the second or third month you should notice it.|`|zjH9MDYyaa	some people try for over a year before they get pregnant just relax and God will bless you when the time is right|`|KCduHtlqaa	You can find out as early as 4 weeks that you are pregnant. Age plays a huge factor also in how easy it is to get pregnant. If you suspect that something may be wrong with either of the parents you can see a fertility doctor. You may also talk to your gynecologist about what steps you need to take.
FkGh0LuWaa	10 sounds like a perfect amount.|`|SlBsJ3NRaa	Usually they say to invite as many children as the childs age, so you don't overwhelm the kid or yourself. But, if you have help, I'm sure 10 would be fine. Sounds like fun!|`|FkPP6NVeaa	If you having your party at home than 10 is too many unless you have a really big house and 2-3 babysitters. 3 year olds need a lot of attention. <br>  <br>  But if your party is in the gym or facility, you can invite as many kids as you want (or they allow).<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|8XcRFF6Taa	Are you having the parents drop the kids off?  I know I wouldn't just drop my 3 year old off at someones house for a birthday party.....  If the parents are attending I think 10 is fine, it's not like you will have to watch them:)  Have fun!|`|nDEVWjCEaa	10 kids sound just right, thats what i had at my sons 3rd birthday i found it was just enough kids...anymore andyou will be pulling your hair out...trust me|`|iraiRVT1aa	10 or less just right|`|l9WAo7kFaa	General rule of thumb for birthday parties is 1 plus their age. So for your 3 year olds birthday party I would invite 4 children. Children around 3 years old don't usually play with each other, they play beside each other.<br>  <br>  But as always, it is up to the parents.<br>  <br>  Cheers|`|KyFCYs0Yaa	Are you going to have other adults there to help you supervise the kids? If you are I think 10 is a good number. I wouldn't want more than that though! 3 year olds can be really active!<br>  Have fun and good luck!

CdJtH0xdaa	I remember when I was eleven, my parents told me not to tell my friends that my cousin got arrested for marijuana possesion, but I told them anyway. I also remember telling my friend that I liked his ex-girlfriend, who he hated. I don't ever recall saying B to any of my friends, but I'm sure that if I heard something like that, I'd definitely tell my friend. He/she deserves to know. So, in conclusion, I would say that now, as a responsible nineteen-year-old married father, I would probably only tell my close friend letter B, as I feel that if a close friend were saying mean things to him/her, he/she deserves to know. I'm married, so I would never have to tell a close friend who I like, and I'm old enough to obey my parents' wishes. So, I've told my friends A and C, but now, I'd only tell my friends B. I could have easily said that before, but I thought I'd give you my life story. ;-)|`|yV8fog7Paa	a) no, but I have a few times.<br>  b) depends, I would chew out the person first.<br>  c) uh?|`|xlEHzmxTaa	a) a family problem, even if you were told by your parents not to<br>  I used to,but none of them seem to care anymore,so I dont<br>  b) if someone you knew, another close friend, was saying something nasty about them and told you not to tell them<br>  If I think they should know then I do<br>  c) Who you fancy, even if it was someone they would not approve of, or you could never get<br>  Yeah,if he's white.

I guess it depends on why my parents didn't want me to, but I still probably would.<br>  <br>  b) It depends on what they say.  If they said something like "she's so fat and ugly" I wouldn't tell, simply because that would make them feel bad.  If it was something that my friend couldn't do much about, I wouldn't tell. <br>  <br>  c) I don't really tell anyone who I like.  It just makes things hard.  I go to a different school than my two best friends, so they wouldn't know them anyway.  But my close friends at my school aren't exactly the best friends.  If you say you like someone it will come up every single time you see them, talk to them, or have something that relates to them. So, no, I probably wouldn't.|`|p3GZERIsaa	A.

For instance a boy problem would be to a friend who has had quite a few boyfriends.<br>  <br>  a) It would have to be a close friend who I knew i could trust but my sister and I are very close so I would confide in her more than likely.<br>  <br>  b) If it was serious or I knew it wasnt true, I would make my friend aware that someone had said that, but I wouldnt tell them who said it.<br>  <br>  c) Yes definaltly.

For the last guy I liked ( and still do like) It took me a while to tell my friends, not because I thought they would laugh or dissaprove, but because I wanted to have something to keep to myself!!! :)|`|SWOeg0jFaa	a) depending on what the family problem was, maybe.<br>  b) probably, but it really depends on the situation.<br>  c) yes I would<br>  <br>  <br>  but don't worry, I sometimes find it hard to tell my friends stuff.

I pick out the outfits (generally based on that morning's weather report) and dress them, so that kind of sticks it in my mind since I've thought about it.  Now, ask me what they wore yesterday and its very unlikely I'll remember.|`|397b528338dbd9036ae6de0f84b8f817aa	my 14 month old, yes.  but Im the one to get her dressed so its not too hard. the 8 year old, forget it.

When we go out, I try to snap a pic with my cell phone.  That way, if he gets lost, I have a current pic of him and what he's wearing.  And nothing is wrong with you.  In the hustle and bustle of everyday life, these things can be overlooked.  Just try to remember...or take a pic!|`|sr7jX2wYaa	You aren't  alone  by any means, Especially if you have  a teenager , They can change clothes  going out the door, & who  has a clue what they have in  their  locker, or  backpack. I like you  wondered  the  same thing  when  my kids  were  young. But as the  other answerer  said, I think if  it came  down to  it needing to  remember  our  motherly instincts would kick in & we  would  know  what they were  wearing  when  they left*|`|AA12145826	I'm with you, I don't always remember, but the one time I needed to remember what she was wearing (she decided to hide in the store one day) I remembered down to the color of her shoes & socks!

ELmRq1zJaa	Congrats...I fell I can really relate I too had twin girls at 37 weeks and they too came home right away.  I'm soo happy to hear that your girls are healthy and doing well...now for the bad new and reality.  YOu can't put newborns on a schedule.  I tried myself.  I amied for every 3-4 hours, but sometimes they wanted to eat at 2 or 2 and 1/2 hours.  It's easier to feed them when they seem hungrey than to deal with the crying.  You will start to clue into their signs of hunger vs fussiness so try to watch your babies body language before you decide to do anything.  The sad thing with twins is that while one may decide that being on a schedule suits them just fine the other may not be as accomadating.  There have been several night that I have been up every hour or soo becuase first one baby will want to eat and then the other.  I try to wake both at the same time to feed them but somtimes they are just to tired to eat.  Most doctors and nurses told me I should be feeding them 8-12 times a day which breaks down to 2-3 hours.  Now here is something else I too breast feed it does take longer with two, my routine takes about 1 hour from start to finish sometimes an 1 and 15 minuetse depending on how well they feed, so be prepared to have a major lack of sleep.  Also I found that I was not able to produce enough milk, so I had to start supplementing with little bits of formul very early on.  I was able to produce up to 4 ounce of milk from each breast at times and even with stock piling what I could save it wasn't enough so don't be surpised if you strickly breast feed that they may seem hungrier more often cause they are not getting enough.  My suggestion is do what works for you.  If you want to try a schedule you better go for 2-3 hour stretches, that seems the most realistic.  Good luck and enjoy your little darlings.|`|d6GvS2Dpaa	I know you don't want to hear this, but it is too early to get them on a schedule.  Feed them on demand and then in a few weeks, they will fall into a schedule all on their own.  It's going to be rough, but there is little you can do about when they get hungry at this point in time.  I know you have your hands full.  Now is the time to call in the troops if you haven't already.  Good luck and congrats on your twins!!<br>  <br>  Geez - I was just trying to be helpful.|`|fAN8snFdaa	Depending on their sizes, and how they gain weight.. <br>  <br>  I fed mine 4 hourly for the first few weeks.. then dropped a nite feed.. to make my life easier I fed both at the same time - which means I often had to wake one in the nite to feed..<br>  <br>  Their routine will change in a few weeks.. then again a few weeks after that .. well mine did ;)<br>  Basically do whatever works for YOU and your lovely babies.. and dont change to do what other people say if it is all going well :)
xLXVSrn6aa	I'm 15 too, I feel the same way about girls my age mostly, and some  guys too. I feel like nowadays the girls I am surrounded by are such imbecilic creatures. They only think of the now, their looks, celebrities, and all of that other mainstream rubbish. They are so stereotype-obsessed these days, and they completely judge everything; whether they admit to it or not. It's hard for me to find anyone to relate too. I like to talk to someone who is intelligent, not using "omg" in regular conversation, someone who isn't constantly texting, or someone who isn't constantly picking apart others. It's hard to find a teenage girl who isn't obsessed with mainstream culture, and being "typical" or "normal." I completely feel you on your issue!|`|CdJtH0xdaa	You're a rare fifteen-year-old, so I applaud you. To answer your question, you are too "old" for your age, but everybody is different, so it's nothing to be ashamed of. Also, the reason girls don't act older than they are is because they're fifteen-years-old. You're only young once, so they want to make the best of it.|`|H2joxeJpaa	no i dont feel so..<br>  every1 is different...<br>  build up confidence in urself my dear..<br>  put a smile on ur face..<br>  talk to urself and feel proud tht u r unique...<br>  i do it too...<br>  nd every2 has his own interests and so do u...<br>  things will b fine wen u get a bit more older<br>  wen u ll b 16 or 17 den u ll also do this...<br>  hair growth and stuff..<br>  u don need to worry my dear..<br>  contact me further for ne questions<br>  i think i can help...<br>  take care|`|6hhdHKVWaa	wow the next president of usa|`|zll28kQ1aa	No! your a person that will do very well in life!|`|HVRNoPuoaa	Are you a "Aquarius" born ? this is  typical characteristics of people born in this sign.Nothing to worry at all, this period in  life you feel you can change the world  and have a vision for a better "Universe" you feel people are silly to discuss about  hair extensions and makeup when there are people in other parts where they are unable to have 3 square meals a day! Reading psychology and philosophy  is good but don't take every word of what you read  and the source from where the info came. Be critical in your thinking<br>  <br>  Try doing some outdoor sports activity, If  interested do some volunteering work for a good cause that will give you some personal satisfaction and some meaning to life.<br>  If you are religious  spend some time at the place of your worship, finally try to understand your friends by asking their point of view of  what they feel about their hair as more important that any of the thing you feel is important, you may learn a new perspective to View life.|`|f6JWEBdDaa	Sounds to me like you've just matured faster than your fellow teens! I don't normally even read, much less answer the questions posted by teens...but yours caught my eye, and I just wanted to say....more power to you!! <br>  <br>  Most teens girls, as I've seen it, are still 5 year olds in a young woman's body, so congrats to you for breaking out of that mold and wanting to do all you can to help your fellow man! <br>  <br>  Stay strong...and best of luck to you in all you pursue! :-)|`|iisbgn17aa	Yes, you are too old for your age, but it isnt necessarily a bad thing. I'm fifteen too & just trust me that not all girls our age are vapid. I'm interested in being a psychologist too cause I love that type of human behavior study stuff lol, but I also act like a complete 5-year-old sometimes. I mean, you get to be a kid for only about 18 years and then you have 70 years of being a grown-up, so why not live it up while you can? Act silly, run around, its whats expected so no need to feel ashamed of acting immature. Its okay though if you dont, cause thats not who you are. You may want to try sometime though :) I kind of wish I liked to talk to adults like you, cause I dont really like to. But dont judge other girls your age, I know its hard but everyone wears a mask and behind the masks are real people with real emotions who are human just like everyone else. <br>  <br>  Love Sienna<3|`|s2JvJ5alaa	My friend Jordynn is exactly like you.<br>  You're just mature for your age. It's your personality. It's not a bad thing.<br>  You should just embrace who you are and try and find friends who share your common interests. They're out there, trust me.|`|SaeUxO6Gaa	15 year old girls that aren't completely vapid are indeed rare.  Don't sweat it though, in a couple short years you'll be with like minded people in college while those girls wait on your tables and bag your groceries.|`|jeCvLt9saa	it's great to be mature<br>  but trust me you don't want to regret not living your teenage years when you're 30|`|RNi6gytSaa	Yes you are too old for your age, your throwing your teen year's away, this is when you get to go out and shop, party, have fun etc.. and your just basically throwing it away. Just think of ALL the years you will have to talk about that stuff when u are an adult.<br>  <br>  I guess it's alright that you do that cuz you are INTO that kinda stuff, but maybe think into the future will you regret not having fun?|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	You sound like a keeper.  Nobody likes silly girls|`|WBbJQNDoaa	It's because their only 15 years old.|`|AA12212403	Thank you and congratulations.<br>  You need some new friends who care about the world and not trivial matters.<br>  Is there a debate team at your school?  If not, ask a great teacher and see if you can start one.<br>  It's OK to have older friends.<br>  My kids were like that (they are 18 and 21) and get along with people about 4 or 5 years older than they are and have since they were about your age.<br>  Keep up the great work, don't worry so much.  Be yourself and be proud of who you are.<br>  I'm proud of you and I don't even know you.<br>  Good to know that some teens out there still have brains and don't follow the crowd.

lfMJPZ67aa	I know just what you are saying. When I had children I decided that if I was going to become a parent then I would be their for them to raise them. There is no point in having children if some-one else e.g.nannies- strangers are bringing them up. You might as well have brought a dog. I take great pride in cleaning my own home and looking after my own children. I think that is why so many children grow up with no respect for them selves or any one else. Their own parents don't even give them the time of day, they are more concerned how much money they can make and they think if they throw some money at their kids every now and then it makes up for them not being there for them. It doesn't. They end up growing up spoilt little up starts. You could just say to them that: At least you are there for your child and you don't have strangers bring them up. And your child is more important than money. Most of them have more than likely missed out on their child's mile stones like their first steps and words. They have missed out on a lot of great memories where you have not. Don't ever feel you are beneath them if any thing they are beneath you. Your child will grow up a far better person than their children and your child will know you love them for what you do for them.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	I would simple say. I am happy where I am so why should you care.<br>  <br>  or if I was in a funny mood, I would say, at least I don't have to sleep with the boss to get a promo in my job|`|bc50adcd7a4cda84a5f4451579fa7554aa	ask them why they find it so funny and let them know you don't find it funny at all. they are probably doing this because they went to college for what they wanted and feel superior to you. ok so once you tell them that you find it offensive then tell them you no longer want to associate with the same people you will be teaching your children are rude and beneath them. i honestly tell my kids that they are better than the ones that flaunt money and act superior to them. we have taught ours that although money  is a great thing it is how we live our lives that make us who we are no the type of paycheck that is brought home. i would say that your "friends" are not real friends and they just use you for their entertainment. friends are never to make us feel low or unwanted but to keep us upbeat and happy. sounds like they lost the site of being human beings when they began to get great paychecks.|`|rhPCJfeuaa	If you're ready for some hurt feelings, I would just say at least I am raising my children with my morals and seeing their every milestone.  I do what I do so I don't have to miss everything like you guys do.  Most people that are so good at dishing it out to others are NOT good at taking the comments.  For them to be putting you down, they are secretly jealous of your time with your child and are feeling insecure about their role as a parent.  But, be ready for a heated exchange here.  You will be hitting a raw nerve that will bring it all to a head.  And, if there is a stunned silence when you speak, take that opportunity to say, "What??  I've heard you all make comments about my situation on numerous occasions.  You think it's ok to make fun of me, but not anyone call you out??"<br>  <br>  Good luck!!  This will either make of break this group of friends for you so you will truly know where you stand with them.  Better to know they are your true friends than to wonder if you are just the punching bag.
o6autbWqaa	just act natural.<br>  stop trying to act your age.<br>  it should just come naturally.<br>  im 16, & i just act how i act.<br>  its fun to act like a child now & then.|`|QHuCVermaa	Ok, try getting a bag to carry around to hold your stuff, if you have somthing immiture to say wait till its just you and your friend, but dont not act like yourself trhen you'll be a fake, mabey do you make up more different and hair. use bigger words but not so big and coonfussing that you dont know what your talking about, idk if this will help but hopefull :)|`|AA10904201	Wow, you sound like you are really self conscious.<br>  This is not really about acting your age, its about you being paranoid and too self conscious about yourself.<br>  <br>  Here are some tricks.<br>  If you really feel fidgety and don't know what to do with your hands when you are walking, then carry something. I know this might sound stupid, but even holding a pen can make a difference. Or your locker keys even.<br>  <br>  About the bag, it all depends on what bag you have. If its a backpack, then I would wear it on my two shoulders because its better for your back, but if you want to use your hands doing something, I would recommend carrying it on one shoulder and holding it in place with your hand.<br>  When your sitting at a table put your bag on your lap and hold it there, or a writing pad or something. Or else keep a drink on the table and sip on it.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps. I don't know the exact circumstances of your problem, so it might sound irrelevant.<br>  There is no need to be self conscious like this. Other things can help like martial arts, if your sporty. It gives you a lot of self confidence. Hope these tips work!!!<br>  <br>  Good luck!!x|`|trxEyVRLaa	I have that exact same problem i'm 15 and feel 10.. :L Thank goodness i'm not alone :) People just accept my immaturity :P Mwahaha...<br>  But yeah, it's annoying me too - I'm trying to dress more grown up - it feels nice to feel grown up but it doens' tfeel like me...|`|SJTkW5VNaa	do NOT try to act like you peers.

z6IekuwSaa	Nipple Shields are generally used to get the baby on the breast, but I don't see any flaw in your logic. I have to use nipple shields b/c my daughter is tongue tied when I actually do nurse and she has no prob at all with bottles, so yes I think that may help. Maybe try the ones that have the opening so her nose still touches your breast and gets that skin to skin in case that's what is deterring her. Good Luck!|`|ZP6fNAZdaa	Playtex makes a bottle called Vent Air, they use an extremely well formulated nipple that is most like a natural mothers nipple. :) They have been granted "Most Like Mother" :) I would try this out with your baby, Most babies can't really tell the difference, infact, they will switch off and on with bottle & breast :)<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.
uIAOcAMZaa	Pretty much all the names you do, for the same reasons (well, excepting Caleb and the like for boys. I love names like that). I also hate the mealy-mouthed sound of Joshua and the horrible dead-animal associations that go with Hunter. <br>  <br>  The rest of my list is almost too long to get into, but let's see: Avery, Sydney, Morgan, Taylor, Bailey, Madison (all boy's names), Katelyn/Kaitlyn (way too trendy), and Gracie (nickname). <br>  <br>  For boys: Carter, Landon, Cameron, Mason, Jackson (all surnames), and Aiden (misspelled).|`|i3FgiLENaa	I hate Emma, Ella, emily, Taylor (for a girl), Jana, Riley, Nevaeh is the worst name ever!!, aaliyah sucks too, and I don't like brianna or brianne.<br>  <br>  Boys, aww I love Christian! Oh well, I don't like any of the Hebrew names either especially caleb, elliot, any of the adens, Auden is acttually a nice name but it's way too overused!! I don't like Ethan, Daniel, Brady is ok, and I like Cooper but only for a dog!!|`|6nn7f41Faa	I hate the name Neveah. It sounds trashy and is WAY overused these days.<br>  <br>  I know a Christian who is an athiest, actually. He's in the process of changing his name. <br>  <br>  I also hate all the -ayden names.

Really awful<br>  <br>  Chase - Hideous name.<br>  <br>  Caden - Ugly name.<br>  <br>  Cooper - Awful. Why would anyone do that to their son?<br>  <br>  Kaden - Trashy ugly spelling of the ugly name Caden.<br>  <br>  Girls:<br>  Madison - Masculine BOYS name. SON of Maude/Matthew's SON.

Kylie, Mikayla, Jayden and all the other -den's lol.<br>  <br>  Others are still trendy but not as bad as the Kayley, Kaylee, Kailey, and Kaylie's out there, because at the very least, they aren't continually mauled and twisted around by bad 'kre8tive' misspellings.  I still dislike them though because they're just tired and boring and feel stuffy because of that - Alexis, Madison, Brianna, Brooke, Jocelyn, Kyle, Eric, Ryan.<br>  <br>  I have to say though, I really do like some of those names you hate lol.  Cooper is one of my favorites, and so is Gabriel.  <br>  <br>  Also, about the faith thing, I can see what you're saying, but I don't think a name has to define everything that you are.  An atheist or agnostic Christian (I mean a person named Christian, that is) most likely won't feel a daily internal conflict over his/her religious beliefs and his/her name lol.<br>  <br>  Anyway, my name tastes run toward the more classic and unusual, but I like 'modern' names too.  Favorites include Violet, Drake, Alexander, Eliza, Scarlett, Isla, Archer, James, Rachel, Charlotte, Quinn, Luke, Nate, and Chase =D.
0JmFm3ioaa	Trisha<br>  the closest to the second pronunciation I have ever heard was Teresa (Ter-ee-sa)|`|86oPkfzOaa	I would pronounce it tri-shuh, like Patricia without the Pa.|`|rHufcHwHaa	I personally have always heard it pronounced like "Tri-sha" but you can pronounce it however you want.  Just bear in mind that you will be correcting the majority of the people that you come into contact with--or if you're planning on naming your daughter this, she will be correcting everyone.  It may be more hassle than it's worth, but it's your decision and as long as you're happy with the name, that's all that matters.|`|zThIaO0Qaa	trisha is the way to pronounce it if you want it pronounced differently then you have to change the spelling to tricia<br>  y? <br>  because alicia has a cia that can be pronounced sha but also see-a<br>  trisha has sha that can only be pronounced that way because it doesn't have the -cia|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	If i saw the name i would immediately pronounce it Trisha.

Think of Patricia: It's not Puh-tree-see-uh. It's Puh-trisha.<br>  <br>  If you like Tricia with the second pronunciation better, that's great. Just know that, with the same spelling, people will constantly call her Trisha, and she'll be correcting them all her life. It's kind of like if someone named their kids S-h-i-t-h-e-a-d pronounced "Shy-theed", or A-s-s-h-o-l-e pronounced "Uh-show-lee".

Your uterus is swelling which makes you have the urge to go. Unless you are in pain or have other symptoms of a bladder infection then it's likely just one of the many pregnancy side affects.

lJ5Ao2aIaa	Most parents move their child from a rear-facing to a forward-facing position when he reaches 12 months and 20 pounds, this is the minimum age and weight requirement for facing forward. Experts say that the longer you keep your child in a rear-facing position, the safer he'll be (that's because, in a frontal collision, the stress on a forward-facing child's neck can injure his spine).|`|pXSKSS3daa	I've been researching this as Noah will soon be 1 and is 22-23 lbs. already.

The veins (I got them on my hips) were one of the first symptoms. In fact all of your symptoms point strongly toward pregnancy to me. It doesn't sound like simple pms.

Now I am almost 8 weeks along.<br>  <br>  My husband has commented on my breasts having bluish veins, but they don't feel heavy or tender or anything. The first time I was pregnant, they were really really itchy! <br>  <br>  If you can, wait a few days and then use an early pregnancy test. Lots of baby dust to you!|`|8fbe337e2b372d5b39e76d1d6d5f91edaa	you should go to the doctor if you want a clear answer. cause ive heard of cases where a home pregnancy test said negative, and they were actually prego. otheres ppl have had even normal periods through out pregnancy and still gave birth to a healthy baby. her doctor told her she wasnt prego a few times but then she got it checked again and she was. just get it profestionally checked out. thats always the best solution. and remember, you know your body better than any one else.|`|O4M6BEDJaa	I would wait a couple more day and take another test but try taking it in the morning, the first morning urine actually has more of the hormones in it then if you take it at night.

In my opinion a fever is a signal that something is going on. I would take her to the doctor to be on the safe side.

Connected with fruitfulness and prosperity. According to Irish legend, áine was the daughter of Fer I (Man of the Yew) and queen of the fairies of South Munster. Irish folklore held that she lived at a place now called Knockany (Cnoc áine, "áine's Hill") and was "the best-hearted woman who ever lived – lucky in love and in money." Anglicized versions include: Anya, Anna, Hannah. According to Ireland's Central Statistics Office, áine has been among the top 50 most popular names registered to baby girls in Ireland every year since they began publishing the report in 1998.  <br>  <br>  <br>  Aoife (EE-fe) From the Old Irish Aífe, a goddess name meaning 'beautiful, radiant, joyful'. In a tale of apprenticeship of the Ulster hero Cú Chulainn, Aífe was the fiercest woman warrior in the world. After she was defeated by the hero, she bore him his only son, Connlach. Aoife Dearg ("Red Aoife") was a daughter of a king of Connacht who had her marriage arranged by St. Patrick himself. In 2003 Aoife was the third most popular Irish girl name. In fact, it has been among the top four most popular names registered to baby girls in Ireland every year since Ireland's Central Statistics Office began publishing the report in 1998.  Anglicized versions include: Eva and Ava. <br>  <br>  <br>  Bébhinn (BAY-vin) From the Old Irish béan, meaning 'woman, lady' + binn, meaning 'sweet, melodious'. This Irish baby girl name was shared by many early queens and saints, including a 12th-century abbess of Derry. Brian Boru's mother was called Bébhinn and he named his daughter for her. In legend, the golden-haired giantess Bébhinn sought sanctuary with Finn mac Cunhaill so she would not have to marry the giant "Hugh The Splendid." Anglicized versions include: Bevin, Bevan. <br>  <br>  <br>  Caitríona - (ka-TREE-na) This is the Irish version of the name Cathleen. Devotion to St. Catherine came to Ireland with Christianity. Revered for her courage and purity, Cathleen, became such a popular Irish girl name that W. B. Yeats chose it for the heroine of his 1899 play The Countess Cathleen which was inspired by an Irish folktale. In a time of famine the Devil offers food to the starving poor in exchange for their souls. But Cathleen convinces Satan to take her soul instead. When she dies the Devil comes to collect her soul but God intervenes and carries Cathleen to heaven, saying that "such a sacrificial act cannot justly lead to evil consequences." Anglicized versions include: Catherine, Kathleen. Nicknames include: Caít (KAYT), Caítín (kay-TEEN), Caítlín (kayt-LEEN), and Tríona. <br>  <br>  <br>  Caoilainn - (KAY-leen) Derived from the Old Irish name Cáelfind: cáel, meaning 'slender' + finn, meaning 'bright, fair, pure'. Saint Cáelfinf of Kerry has her feast day February 3. Several saints were named Caoilainn and one was described as "a pious lady who quickly won the esteem and affection of her sister nuns by her exactness to every duty, as also by her sweet temper, gentle, confiding disposition and unaffected piety." <br>  <br>  <br>  Cessair - (KAH-seer) According to old Irish legends, Cessair was the grandaughter of Noah who led the first settlers to Ireland. The story says that she came to Ireland with fifty women and three men whom Noah refused to allow onto the ark. Except for Finian, Cessair and the other settlers died in the Great Flood. <br>  <br>  <br>  Ciara - (KEE-ra) The feminine form of Ciarán, from the Irish ciar, meaning 'dark' and implies 'dark hair and brown eyes'. Saint Ciara was a distinguished seventh-century figure who established a monastery at Kilkeary in County Tipperary. In 2003 Ciara was the third most popular Irish girl name. In fact, it has been among the top five most popular Irish baby girl names every year since Ireland's Central Statistics Office began publishing the report in 1998.  Anglicized versions are: Keera, Keira, and Kira. <br>  <br>  <br>  Cliona - (KLEE-a-na) From the Old Irish girl name Clídna. According to Old Irish legends, Clídna was the name of one of the three beautiful daughters of the poet Manannán mac Lir. A fairy named Clídna was the guardian spirit of the MacCarthy's. Clídna had three magical birds that could sing the sick to sleep and heal them. In the tale of "Clídna's Wave" she falls in love with a mortal, "Keevan of the Curling Locks," and leaves Tir-na-n'Og ("Land of Eternal Youth") with him. But when he goes off to hunt, leaving her on the beach, she is swept to sea by a great wave, leaving her lover desolate. The Modern Irish form, Clíodhna, is a very popular baby girl name in Ireland today. <br>  <br>   <br>  Dervil - (DER-uh-vil) From the Old Irish girls' name Derbáil, probably derived from der, meaning 'daughter' + Fál, an ancient name for Ireland. So the meaning of this Irish baby girl name would be 'daughter of Ireland'. Many ancient Celtic and|`|8zsvjLUUaa	Aisling , Deirdre , Niamh , Erin , Orla, Nora , Ailis , Alana , Clodagh , Eilis, Fiona , Enya , Maeve , Nuala , Shannon , Roisin , Tara , Una.<br>  These are all cool irish names =]|`|FjqJs7gMaa	Heritage:  belongs to one by reason of birth ?<br>  You have had your name for years already.

Put things in front of them and see if they will grab it, they will giggle, etc. The routine doesn't really change though, they eat about the same.

gzklmnp3aa	This doesn't sound like implantation bleeding at all. It's probably ovulation bleeding as the bleeding often doesn't occur until after you've actually ovulated. Also, implantation bleeding tends to continue for 3 or 4 days whereas ovulation bleeding usually doesn't go for more than two. So I'd say no, you're not falling pregnant.|`|ZbnxGIsnaa	Sounds like bit heavier then implantation spotting, but it's possible.  Sounds like you cervix is irritated to me and that's why it's bleeding.  The bleeding can happen from a simple hormone change or having sex where it's tapping it.|`|6Q698g4Paa	This definetely could be implantation bleeding. Same thing happened to me. The brown spotting is dried blood.
7PXFXcKfaa	oh my goodness ... what a terrible situation. I hate to think what could happen when she starts to roll around ...<br>  <br>  First of all - i am NOT anti co - sleeping - i think it can be wonderful when done safely and properly ... check out www.askdrsears.com for some great general information on co sleeping ...<br>  <br>  What your husband is doing is NOT safe co - sleeping ... <br>  <br>  1 - the baby should never sleep on her tummy due to SIDS.<br>  2 - the baby should never sleep on a sofa - its too soft.<br>  3 - baby should sleep beside mummy - not on the middle. MEn dont have the wake up intuition.. <br>  4. the baby should sleep on her back on a flat mattress with no pillows or bedding - nowhere she can fall off.<br>  <br>  So what the worst case scenario? well honestly - death by suffocation or SIDS - i know you know, and im not trying to scare you, but does HE know? <br>  <br>  First of all ... why not look at some cosleeping webpages together? Show him the base facts and how to do it safely and it might be enough to alter his ways and sleep more safely? If he realizes you just want him to make small changes, he wont rebel as much against you as if your telling him to stop. You know how stubborn these men - folks can be! <br>  <br>  If this plan is unsuccessful - you two should go to the doctor together. Explain your dilemma in the room with your husband there - ask him to explain the dangers to your husband, as he wont listen to you.<br>  Voice your concerns about your own, and the babies wellbeing to the doctor, as well as the effect this is having on your marriage. <br>  <br>  Hes not taking you seriously at the moment - however you may find that if the doc says its not ok, he will listen. <br>  <br>  The most important thing at the moment is the wellbeing of your child. You have to decide what extremes you are willing to go to in order to protect her. <br>  <br>  One more point - perhaps the root of this problem ... parents make many choices regarding their children from the get go - one of which is how to sleep. There are many more, much more serious and important decisions which will follow and which you will naturally expect to be a part of (just as you expect to be a part of this one, however tragically you are being ignored.)<br>   <br>  At this point he is not including you in the decision making process ... whats to say he is going to include you in any future ones? what happens if you disagree about something more serious in the future - like violent means of discipline? Is he just going to go forward and do what he likes then too, regardless of your opinion?<br>  <br>  And what kind of message is this complete disregard of you, and your opinions on childrearing going to have on your daughter?<br>  <br>  alarm bells should be ringing.|`|8kaDm2D8aa	maybe just take her off him when he falls asleep & put her in the crib/bassinet.|`|d6GvS2Dpaa	Go to the next doctor's appointment together and bring this up at the doctor's office.  Sometimes men can be stubborn and maybe the opionin and urging of the doctor will make him change his mind.  Good luck and I hope that your daughter remains safe.|`|7XBoIgd6aa	You could try getting a protective co-sleeper.|`|m6FPXCeuaa	well its okay to take naps but the baby needs to sleep in the crib at night time!|`|PuuFMRcFaa	Make an appointment with your pediatrician, and tell your husband it is imperative that he join you.  Explain everything you posted to your Dr. and he/she will undoubtedly tell your husband what he is doing is indeed unsafe.  My hubby is a police officer and has answered MANY calls where mom or dad rolled onto baby while sleeping only to find that baby has been suffocated when they wake up.  It is a sad scenario that is easily avoided.  Your husband wants to show his love but needs to be informed by a professional that it is more loving to be safe and let baby sleep in her/his crib.  Best of luck to you and I hope you can convince him...the stories I hear are just so sad.|`|z6IekuwSaa	It is soooo cute that he is sooo affectionate towards your baby. I have co-slept and never had any problems, but it sounds as he had. Maybe you can ask him to stop until she's a few months older or just take her to her crib after he falls asleep since you said he's a heavy sleeper|`|AA11918778	It is possible to co-sleep safely first of all , but he needs to change the way he is holding her while you sleep if he wants to do this.  Look up methods for safe co-sleeping.  Also you could try a compromise and get one of the bassinets that actually attach to the bed - so she is "right there" but is on her back (sleeping on tummy is a big no no regardless of where she sleeps) and these allow the benefits of co-sleeping and having her close without the risks since he is apparently too sound of a sleeper to make that work.  <br>  <br>  Otherwise stand up to him! It's your child and if he is endangering her then he needs to know you are not going to tolerate it period.  He can either compromise or else.|`|KSUPtqCaaa	I hate to sound melodramatic, but this is a serious issue of life and death. While I think that "kangaroo care", as it is called, is important in bonding with issues - falling asleep with an infant on your chest is dangerous.<br>  <br>  I have treated babies who have succumbed to asphyxiation as a result of this. I feel very strongly about it.<br>  <br>  Suggest getting a co-sleeper or bassinet that rests next to the bed, talk to your doctor; and if he doesn't stop, take the baby and go someplace else. I am not kidding, this can and does end in tragedy to many families every year!<br>  <br>  You need to put your foot down.<br>  <br>  Cheers!|`|T9fek24eaa	I would lay down the law and not ask, but tell him he is not going to sleep with her anymore and when he goes to lay down with her, I would walk over and take her away from him. That would piss me off to no end and I could see many of many knock down drag out fights about it, especially with him being disrespectful to you and blatantly telling you he will not stop. Sometimes as mothers, when we know what is best, we have to put our foot down and fight tooth and nail for it, for our childrens best interest.

Although it's always best to handle it diplomatically, because that woman probably walked away thinking, "Not only is her father some sort of poor Mexican witch doctor, this woman is is also crazy." <br>  <br>  I think all racist comments are a great chance to teach. I would have taken the time to explain to her very clearly that she should have invited everyone anyway and stated on the invites that they are not to bring a gift if she was afraid people couldn't afford a gift. I'd have let her know that it's selfish on her part to expect gifts for a birthday party. I'd have told her that birthdays are not about gifts, but about her daughter's friends celebrating with her on her special day. And then I would have let her know that the girl's father was a doctor and owner of his clinic. And walked away.<br>  <br>  **Charlie don't be an idiot. Most people in this whole country are poor, it's not just Mexicans.|`|j2mRop0laa	I hate those gymnastics moms. My girls are in gymnastics and those cheer/gym moms are freaking jealous of everyone and try to cover it up by acting like they are high and mighty. <br>  <br>  Sounds like a high school clique mentality. <br>  I would make that situation very uncomfortable for her by bringing your husband to one of the practices and starting up a convo with her by casually asking her what her husband does. I bet he isn't a doctor.<br>  <br>  I hate bigots.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	This really confused me, but the other women was very rude about the Mexican thing. But I am sorry a lot of your questions doesn't make sense|`|7f40a0efee482e94e2baa04fac426e33aa	I thought kids invited other kids to birthday parties for the fun of having all their friends there.Not to get more gifts.I feel you was in the right. I too probably would of lost my temper with her.And if the parents of the kid having a birthday has so much money why would care if someone buys something for her kid or not?<br>  <br>  <br>  Some people are just backwards and make no damn since.And that's kind of a a shame knowing those kids are going to end up thinking and acting the same As their messed up parents|`|prqrQcd1aa	Wow! I think you could have handled yourself a little more appropriately, but when you are told something like that, and people are making assumptions about if you have money or not because of your race...then yeah, I could see myself doing something similar with no regrets at the time (but maybe later on, especially if my daughter was there and heard me cussing) <br>  I thought birthday parties were to have fun in celebrating another year of life for the child...not about getting presents. This would just show me how much this "woman" is hung up on materialistic things, and also how racist she is! Maybe she just said that because she didn't want to make her self seem bad for not inviting your daughter because she looks part mexican?? I don't know but either way that is one horrible mother, and teaching your children stuff like that isn't very "high and mighty" either!
nDEVWjCEaa	im on both ends of the stick... my son ( who is 6) was a great sleeper  he would sleep in til 10 ( not lying) but my daugher  ( who is 2) on the other hand  is up ( not quite as early as yours)   at between 7-7:30.. thats early after having my son sleep til 10 and I am someone that loves my sleep.  My husband and I take turns on the weekends   he sleeps in on saturdays and I get sundays..It works for us.<br>  She still naps in the afternoons for 2 hrs.. and is in bed ( most nights) by 8:30|`|ETsUQa0kaa	Some do that. My daughter (10) still likes getting up early. My other daughter (11) loves to sleep in. It depends on the child.
X9Dpyrg9aa	I'm not 100% sure, but from what I understand they will admit you if you are 4cm dilated or more, so they would probably exam you and either keep you or send you home based on that.|`|J3yUXKiyaa	Call your doc's office and consult with them. <br>  <br>  Most people feel their contractions, but a few don't, or even just feel a few...it's called a silent labour.  A good friend of mine had this with her first two - so she'll be on high alert again when she gets close to her due date with her third in May.<br>  <br>  She all of a sudden just winds up being doubled over in horrible pain, but no regular contraction pain, and the next thing you know, she's delivering within an hour of being admitted.<br>  <br>  Probably not the case, but just give a shout anyhow.|`|chmuDZObaa	I don't think they'll admit you on pelvic pain alone.  You probably will need to have either regular contractions or your water break.  Good luck.|`|AA12074512	most people on the internet are not doctors how can thy know whats wrong with you..you my need to stay in the hospital ..only your doctor can tell you that..|`|mx3gFmIKaa	If this is your first baby, and you are 4cm that is considered active labor and they would admit you for it.  If the contractions are irregular they will send you home unless the baby is in fetal distress which is when the heartrate dips down during a contraction and either dips too low, or doesn't recover quickly enough then you'd be admitted.
chmuDZObaa	There are prostaglandins in sperm that help soften the cervix which makes it efface and dilate.  Orgasms will cause the uterus to contract and may jump start contractions.  So, to answer your question, both can help bring on labor but in different ways!|`|s2F6pK9Xaa	Yup- if you have an O. It makes the uterus contract.|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	um i dont see y not i think the sperm helps soften you up . i think an orgams brings on labor Hell do both hehe|`|psObSiFqaa	its not necessarily males sperm that induces labor, its more the fact that youd be having sex. im not sure if masterbation can, but i know if you go for a walk or do some (small) exercises it'll induce labor. good luck!
GIlTkQu6aa	calm is key.<br>  yelling will NEVER work. your son is probably going through a rough time at school or he misses his dad. a 10 year old boy usally want to play catch or somthing with his dad.<br>  you are a great mom and you are in control. there are many tools on the tool shelf;  grounding, yelling, (dont yell) time outs, ect<br>  choose one and be consistant. threatan him and be firm "stop or else you wont have tv for a week!" if you choose to spank, then only spank him on the rear. i might suggest weekly or monthly parenting classes (im not calling you a bad parent, but they can give you ideas for your kids.) also weekly family meetings help too. check this out i think it will help. <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Keep-Relationships-Healthy-Within-Your-Family" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Keep-Relationship...</a><br>  good luck<br>  ps feel free to e-mail me: skimboarding29@yahoo.com or gmail.com|`|d57099e9d0551bf1846f1f00f5fd9648aa	It sounds like he sure knows how to push your buttons. You need to calm down and take control of your family.  Every child will obey and follow rules when the parent is calm and in control. He needs to know that every single time he misbehaves there will be a consequence. When you get worked up and overwhelmed he is in control and this is why he is not behaving.  I know you think you are "making him mind" but you're not.  Yelling at him is not disciplining him.  Discipline means that you teach him that when he doesn't do right, something will happen as a result.  FOr a 10 year old boy it should be things like - no video games that night, or he doesn't get to watch TV. If you are consistent then he will absolutely start to change his behaviour, but you have to be strong, calm down and follow through CALMLY, no yelling, every single time. WHen he started yelling at his sister the other day, did he know you were going into your other child's room?  If you had asked him to be quiet while you went into the room, and then he disobeyed and started yelling at his sister, you yelling at him taught him nothing.  But if you came out and told him that you were disappointed he chose not to listen and be quiet for a few moments while you went into the bedroom, and that since he made that choice, he also chose to give up his video games, it would decrease the lieklihood that he would do that again.<br>  And by the way, I would bet that your son doesn't see himself as having it "pretty good" if his dad isn't around. He is at the exact age where a boy absolutely needs to have dad around.  I think you need to look at that and if dad is unavailable look at some other male role model for him such as a grandpa or uncle getting more involved.<br>  Good luck|`|DnNkCF6Taa	The truth of the matter is that you need to calm down and try to not yell or scream at your son.  And while I understand that you can get upset by him, the truth is that is if you try to cool down and be calm and then handle the situations it would be better.  As far as discipline, there are things as far as corner time, spankings, and things of that nature while I know you have tried would help.  The idea is that every time either one of them acts up there needs to be a consequence for it.  You will get much farther with consistency and smaller discipline than you would with big discipline and screaming.<br>  <br>  The fact is that when you scream back at them, you are at their own level and you need to rise above it and yes take control of the household.  To sit down with them and say things are going to change, here are going to be the rules in the house, and these are the punishments for breaking the rules.  Yes I know he is a strong willed boy but if every single time he did something he was grounded, given corner time or spanked he would stop doing it.  <br>  <br>  For example I am probably not the only person in the United States that has a tendency to speed when on the highway.  If I knew that every single time I sped, I got a ticket, I wouldn't speed anymore.   Though due to the fact that I have always sped and pretty much has never seen a cop when I have done so, means that I feel that I can get away with it.<br>  <br>  I know that sounds strange, but the idea is you need to be consistent with your discipline.  I mean that they need to know where the line is, and every time that line is crossed this is what is going to happen.  Then in that consistency they have safety, because they know what is going to happen next.  They know mama is not going to yell at them, they might get spanked but they knew they were going to before they acted out and broke the rule mama said was a spanking offense.  <br>  <br>  Really what you need to do is to talk with them and tell them these are the new rules, and this is how we are going to take things from now on.  Don't do it when everyone is yelling but do it at dinner or sometime when there is peace.  For example if you were to say every time someone screamed unless it was for help they were going to get a spanking, and your son screamed at the point, don't get upset or yell, just take him aside and spank him.  <br>  <br>  So what I am trying to say is you need to be the calm one, and try to cool down, look at it as a step forward.  As far as being a failure, you are trying and only those that fail are those that give up.  And while you have come to this site for advise, I applaud you in doing so.  Because it means a lot to want help and then to ask for it.  <br>  <br>  If you ever need anything in this manner or need help with how to handle a given situation, or just need someone to vent to, feel free to email me at PenguinBoss925@yahoo.com .  I may be a total stranger, but if you need help I can help you be the calm in the day.
dc5579dda31633fb3c2d8612ff7583cdaa	The only way is to ignore it though it is hard. Remember your values and stick with that. You know what is right and wrong. In high school you will learn who your real friends are also. Keep them close to you. In the long run the people in high school that seem so popular really will not amount to much in REAL life.|`|b2ZwhOqsaa	well, just dont talk bad about anyone.. and when someone talks bad about someone else, just listen, dont talk. I wouldnt even bother telling them that you don;t wanna hear bad things about ppl, because then they will just start saying rude things about you. there will be a lot of drama, but if you can stay out of it as much as possible, you'll be fine. just remember your above it all!|`|EMYImof1aa	there is NO drama in high school, that's all made up to make movies interesting :] if there is any "drama" it's easily avoidable if you want it to be, don't be a slut or cheat on your bf, and don't make friends with those kind of people. easy as pie, just focus on doing well in school and enjoying your youth!|`|93r3nCM1aa	You really can't. In high school, drama comes and FINDS you. It's unavoidable.|`|eS9nPWqBaa	Mind your own business.<br>  <br>  Don't gossip.<br>  <br>  HS was the best time of my life...everyone loved me...I didn't love everyone.|`|AmqQ9it5aa	Hang out with like minded people who stray away from that stuff.|`|kBp9IzQqaa	You ignore it.|`|BBfIXcI0aa	Be open to experiencing new things. Don't judge people - no matter how far away from your life they seem, you never know who you'll hit it off with if you give everyone a chance. (However, don't take it personally if people judge you - it's inevitable sometimes.) Be a good friend from the moment friendships start, and avoid talking behind peoples' back. If you follow these guidelines, you'll never be a part of the drama, much less need to survive it.|`|d8685cdfce57268f3ec5dca715629f2caa	Don't get involved with a lot of people. You only need a few good friends. Drama happens when people try to be popular and they start making hundreds of friends and then they take that to myspace and al that crap. <br>  <br>  Just be a normal kid and screw popularity. It is like being a celebrity, look how they get hounded and made look bad and what not! Pure drama.

The best advice i can give you is if someone is bring drama to you they are not true friends and try to ignore the drama as best as you can. Try to hang with friends that don't bring drama. <br>  <br>  Best of luck and wishes.|`|ixyNeBhWaa	Be equal.  If they harrase you... secretly take their pictures and photoshop them, then late after school post the fliers up everywhere.<br>  Dont tell anyone that you made the pictures, not even your friends, some people will just rat you out to see if you can fight.  Its better to get even in a secret way.  This way they will learn to shut their mouths because they never know who they are ******* with lol!!!!<br>  <br>  Or you could dress up all in gothic clothing and punch someone in the nose the first day of high school so that everyone knows not to mess with you.  J/K  dont do that.  Do the picture one  ^_^  YEAH!!!|`|r8WlqZFXaa	Im year 10 now and to be honest there isn't that much drama!

Don't worry about it, it's really not as they make out on the movies :)|`|nPHJndGOaa	Just do it. Avoid what you can. That's the best you can do. There will always be drama. You will gain and lose friends. But, it's only 4 years, and even though it will suck then, afterwards, you look back and realize how much you miss it.|`|8484b98b7322a891688e78db30e42f20aa	Meh.

IGNORE it.|`|MMaATnAiaa	just be cool|`|08dcc3409c097acc6249e2b54c0f780faa	My advice :stay away from it :)|`|5zz1TQAkaa	i started highschool this year and I'm loving every minute of it. You just need to get involved in things and as you get involved in things you love you will meet other people who love what love and hopefully they become your friends. It's not nearly as horrible as hollywood makes it out to be. If you start to sense that there might be drama coming up with your friends just remove yourself from the situaton. Trust me just get involved with clubs and other activities and the next four years of your school life will be awesome. P.S. If you play a instrument don't be afarid to join band, I'm in band and so are all my best friends and trust me people won't think you're a band nerd if you are in band.|`|tPJ08oa5aa	Start the year by hanging around people you know--no need to rush into making friends until you are used to your new surroundings, new locker, subjects... There really isn't as much drama as there is made out to be, though. I wouldn't worry too much. Just be yourself, study hard, be friendly, don't get into trouble, you get the idea. Soon enough high school will just be run of the mill and you won't think anything of it. Try to enjoy it too--I'm a junior this year and, for the most part, loving it. It really does fly by. Biggest thing: Don't worry, high school isn't a soap opera, just the next new stage of your life!|`|3tyGltFcaa	First of all completely ignore the first comment.  You shouldnt have sex in high school, theres a big chance of a std and getting pregnant.  Im sure at your school you will see a lot of pregnant girls dont act stupid.  Find a few friends or keep the ones you already have who are good people and stay with them and ignore whats going on and PLAY SPORT OR JOIN SOME ACTIVITY it will help a lot trust me.  Thats how I survived it.|`|pAwIizRNaa	1 drama causer-boys.<br>  lol. so if you can stay away from them, youre good.<br>  uhm. if you talk about ppl, they will ALWAYS find oout. no matter what. just be nice, dont talk about ppl, and dont get involved in other ppls buisness and problems. and thats pretty much all you can do. there will still always be ppl who start drama w/ you over stupid stuff. theres no avioding it. some ppl could be jealous. just try to ignore it and have fun, and youll be fine [:|`|S1H8B23Iaa	There is no avoiding it. everyone has to deal with it at one point in thier life and going through it in highschool in my opinion is probably the best.  its almost like a right of passage into adulthood. put up with it now, learn and grow from it. it will help you mature in a way you will only understand as you get older.<br>  <br>  Trust me and hang in there.|`|hXVpP16saa	Join clubs, talk to people, design your locker (make it sweet)  Try to make high school as best as you can because the real drama comes from college. I know I sound like a parent but honestly just try to stay alive.<br>  <br>  Best of Luck,<br>  Button|`|YdzrlOTOaa	hahaha. wow. i wish i'd knew the answer to this 4 years ago.<br>  <br>  stay away from dramatic people.<br>  <br>  join clubs.<br>  <br>  get known.<br>  <br>  =]<br>  <br>  live.<br>  <br>  and it doesn't matter what people say, besides it's only high school.|`|KOZXzbsQaa	Jus dont worry about it; you shouldnt worry about what peolpe say about you;; yeah high school can bee horribale i should know!:<br>  but just be Your self|`|fQSAZwLmaa	Sorry but their is NO WAY to avoid all the crap that you will undergo. . .|`|XHkruFkqaa	Basically  just ignore it!

It is a bit ethnic-sounding, but there is nothing wrong with that.|`|f27c7ae986058c646a62a0a9855a77f3aa	Im sorry but i hate it...|`|qXq0nmBzaa	My sister's ex is a professional auto painter and does restorations of vintage cars. He has always called Pontiac Firebirds "Frieda". That's my only reason for not being fond of the name and it's so personal that I doubt you'd ever run into it. <br>  <br>  Frieda means "peace" so I'd probably use Mira (Bulgarian, Macedonian, Slovene for "peace") or Irene (English, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Scandinavian, Finnish, German, Greek Mythology [Latinized] for "peace").<br>  <br>  Otherwise, the name is very pretty and flows well.|`|AOkucu5haa	Freida may be doable on it's own, but Freida coupled with Vanetta is overkill.|`|zThIaO0Qaa	i like carter...|`|iyEYXiq8aa	I don't like it|`|J4kSN7YVaa	very unusual|`|xoRrq3enaa	SAVE humanity and do not name her freida >_____> Soudns like she's fried food|`|D2Vkk5WDaa	The only part I like of it is Carter....sorry :( It's just not my style.|`|VJQAE4FRaa	odd and scary please you couldn't thought of a better name

8g7hshqEaa	I had the EXACT same problem when i was pregnant with my daughter.<br>  <br>  One night i wiped after i peed and i noticed there was the smallest little dot of blood on the paper. i freaked. i wiped again and there was no more. i had just recently heard at the time of someone i knew getting a UTI, so i got a cup & peed in it and my pee was pink. I called my doctor first thing the next morning. They told me to come in and they tested my urine and it tested positive. They put me on macrobid. I took it as directed and when i finished it off i was sure i was over the UTI. A couple of days later i wiped and again noticed a tiny spot of blood. Peed in a nother cup, urine was again, pink. Called the doctor - same drill, more macrobid. I ended up going through this a third time and getting more macrobid. The 4th time i went in for a UTI i saw my doctor and he put me on keflex. After i finished the keflex i never had another UTI. I was worried though that all those antibiotics would have an affect on my baby. However, about 4 or so months after i finally got over my uti - I had a beautiful healthy 9lbs 2.5oz baby girl. She is healthy as can be. Some people on here told me when i asked about my fear with the antibiotics and my baby said that she may be immune to all antibiotics - not true. My daughter came down with strep-throat last month & her doctor put her on antibiotics and she responded just fine to them. You'll be fine, i promise. Just concentrate on beating that UTI because they are such a pain esp while pregnant. Hope i helped you! Good luck|`|iwYu32N2aa	if it were bad for you or baby, the doc wouldn't give them to you. If you are concerned talk to your OB about it.|`|H2IhRXIIaa	I was put on the same stuff twice....and it helped ALOT! It can be worse for the baby if you dont taken them, cause the infection can spread to the sack the baby is in a cause preterm labor..and thats not good.|`|TJ4q7X8Vaa	I had a kidney infection during pregnancy that I treated with the antibiotics. My doctor assured me that it was safe for the baby. My daughter was born perfectly healthy. They wouldn't prescribe it if it wasn't safe to take while pregnant. To help prevent them try drinking more water and cranberry juice and go when you need to; don't hold it.|`|ybDrwqFbaa	Remember that anything in your blood stream and stomach will end up in your baby.<br>  Almost any medications you take can seriously damage your child's brain.<br>  The best thing to do is ask your doctor they are the professionals in this|`|FmSWPS7Paa	i have a history of uti in and out of pregnancy. macrobid is safe. i wouldnt worry|`|fOL95e7paa	they wouldnt give it to you if it wasnt safe
pvH3oHRfaa	I have similar nightmares and horrible thoughts. But I don't think it's something you should leave alone. If you suffered with PPD, it sounds like it's still lingering. You should go and speak with a doctor.<br>  <br>  I suffer from anxiety and agoraphobia, and have done for many years, but my anxieties did escalate after the birth of my daughter. I often have obsessive thoughts about what would happen if... what if... My current obsession is worrying about standing on her head. I know it sounds awful, I just find it difficult not to worry about it constantly. Even though in the back of my mind, reason says it won't ever happen.<br>  <br>  I have learnt to cope with my problems whilst avoiding medication, however, if I felt it was getting out of control, I would ask my doctor to help me out a bit. Sometimes just talking it out with someone can help.<br>  <br>  I would advise you to go and seek some help from a professional. I assure you that you are not alone in what you are feeling, but don't ignore it, and make sure you confide in friends and your partner. <br>  <br>  Best of luck|`|nmu6coapaa	I had a dream the other night that my son was lying in his bath, under the water and his eyes were closed! Everyone wanted to lift him out but I said to leave him, he was just sleeping! I spent the whole next day freaking out about it! It was horrible|`|OKarH9Zsaa	If you think you still have the depression you really ned to see your doctor.  Honestly I have never had dreams like that.|`|UghJ0XROaa	I have had dreams like that about my 2 year old, she is in her terrible two's and i get frustrated and have to walk away from her so i don't lose my temper. Well in my nightmares i have flipped out on her and woke up in tears. It might be out of a subconscious fear of not being able to deal with her. If you had really done that to and it did result in SBS she would not be alert and you would be able to tell.<br>  <br>  <br>  I don't think you dreaming about doing it, means you want to do it. It's anxiety of not being able to cope being projected into your dream world. Look at it this way, in your waking moments at any part of the day, have you ever thought about seriously hurtin her?|`|1MEnCmwoaa	The only thing I can say is to tell your Dr or see a therapist. <br>  I don't think it is normal to think this way even if it is in your dreams. Dreams are part of our subconscious. <br>  If you don't even know for sure if you have done this then definitely contact a Dr. Also, tell your husband or boyfriend or whoever. <br>  It isn't something to be ashamed of, it is just something some people need help with.|`|r7q8LW7Aaa	I had the most awful dream once - I was forced to chose between my children as to which would live and which would die... I woke up in tears.<br>  I think it's normal to have some nightmares, and even to dream that you have done something wrong - but they're only dreams and it doesn't mean you actually want to do these things!<br>  You should ask your doctor about the possibility of PPD still hanging around, but the fact that you recognise your feelings is a great step towards feeling better.|`|jwIdq5qkaa	You may still have PPD. I would ask the doctor if there was anything he could do to help. If there is a med that can help you sleep or something. I don't think you would hurt you daughter intentionally but when your asleep I don't think you control you actions or your dreams for that matter. I hope you will be able to sleep better soon.|`|tx8OTfFUaa	How awful for you.  Your level of anxiety has overwhelmed your sense of self.  Have you spoken to your Dr about this possible PPD?  If you had shaken her, she would show signs.  Constant crying would be one of those signs...<br>  <br>  I think a call to your Dr followed up by a visit asap is in order.  If you truly don't know whether you shook your daughter, then it's help time. <br>  <br>  I had terrible PPD after my son was born that included harming myself.  I literally felt like I was slowly losing my mind.  This only lasted about 3 months though.  I really think you need to talk to someone about this.|`|e5CuEiPfaa	This is not your fault. You can't help your dreams. But if I were you, I would be giving my dr a call ASAP. I had PPD too and I know how it is. I never had nightmares like that, though. I was on a med once that made me hallucinate so it may be a medicine you are taking. Just talk to your dr. Hope you get everything figured out.|`|JgZwvXXJaa	No I am sure you are not the only one, I personally have not but if it continues and bothers you maybe talk to your doctor they are just dreams as long as you do not act on them I think you are ok|`|b34bca47be644e0ef6a339cf479e2cd8aa	I am sure you would know  if you harmed your little one.   Since you are having a hard time separating reality from dreams I think you should consult a dr before you do hurt her.|`|P0Fjh59Eaa	Hon, it's not uncommon but i would suggest you seek out some help.<br>  <br>  it's not healthy to have dreams like this, or even random thoughts like this.<br>  When i was pregnant w/my last child, i used to have these HORRID daydreams of people busting into my home during a home invasion and kidnapping me and my children. my day dreams got so vivid and graphic as to what these monsters did to my children and me that it made me sick to the point of vomiting. I couldn't not think about it, i used to actually shake my head to try and get myself focused on something else! <br>  <br>  I had to talk to my doc about it because i was losing sleep over it, i was scared to sleep...because i didn't want my day dreams to follow into my dreams at night. i have 4 kids and it would kill me if anything happened to them, and i just didn't understand WHY i would sit and daydream about such awful stuff.<br>  My doc told me to speak w/a councilor because she didn't feel my reaction to them was a danger (since i genuinely hated having them, and was scared of why)<br>  turns out that for some reason my fears over my husband being deployed to AFG for most of my last pregnancy triggered all these fears of being assaulted or my children being assaulted while he was gone and that i felt powerless about protecting them due to my being pregnant.<br>  <br>  as soon as my son was born, the thoughts disappeared, but it was quite scary. i would definitely get some professional help hon. it's your best bet to help deal w/your dreams and fears.|`|rAxoAvSZaa	SEE YOUR DOCTOR. PPD is nothing to mess with. It would be one thing if you were only have the nightmares sporadically. But having them every night combined with the anxiety means you need to be on medication. This is not a judgement, I actually did my thesis on PPD and truly medication is the best way for controlling the symptoms until you get can yourself back together. Please, for the sake of your child. They've shown that children are affected by your mood so if you're constantly anxious and upset then that will affect your childs mood and behaviors.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	These nightmares are a function of your anxiety over your daughter.  They are *not* signs of a deep-seated desire to harm your child - they are just the opposite.  You are so scared that something will happen to your daughter that you have terrible thoughts about it, in which sometimes you are the one doing it.<br>  <br>  I am so sorry you are going through this.  I suspect your PPD is not completely over.  You might want to consult a doctor about this anxiety.<br>  <br>  But please know, you are not in danger of harming your child - this is NOT what these dreams are about.|`|OLW0Irbhaa	If you are feeling this concerned then it's definitely valid and worth a trip to the doctor.  Especially given your history of PPD.  It's imperative that you take the steps to heal yourself and maintain a healthy relationship with your daughter.
qXq0nmBzaa	Jacqueline Kennedy had the same issue with her son John. She didn't want him called Jack like his father and she didn't like Johnny. For those old enough to remember, she called him John-John to reinforce the name John to the press. As he got older, the press dropped the childish John-John in favor of John.<br>  <br>  Doubling up on your girls' names would be annoying but, as a parent, you DO set the tone. An earlier posting suggested always introducing the girls by their full names. That's an excellent start. <br>  <br>  Teaching your children the ? gentle ? art of correction will also help. Screaming at someone for mispronouncing or misusing a name is counterproductive. However, a parent or child can always say, "I'm sorry (or excuse me) but my name is ..."<br>  <br>  When the children are enrolled in school, simply request (NO demands!) that the teacher use the child's full name without nns. It won't take long before you'll rarely ever hear a nn.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you and congratulations on your name choices.|`|9ko5WUFkaa	The only way is to actually name them Jackie or Vicky.  There is no way you can force people to use the full name and people, especially kids, will always find a way to shorten a longer name, and sometimes a short one.  You might be able to get family and friends to call them by their full name but not everyone will.  And also, as they got older they might prefer to be called Jackie or Vickie so you still lose.|`|tSEA42Uraa	Well, you could have your daughters introduce themselves as, "Hi! I'm Jacqueline." or, "Hi! I'm Victoria." People will be less likely to use a nickname if they see that the child calls themselves by the full name.<br>  <br>  Next, once she gets in school, she can just say when she's introducing herself, "I'd prefer to be called by my full first name, and not a nickname. Thank you!" Until then, you can introduce them to others by their full name, and perhaps mention that you'd like them to not have a nickname.<br>  <br>  Another possibility is this: Whenever you don't refer to them as Jacqueline or Victoria, call them a nickname that's name-indiscriminate; such as Honey, Sweetie, Baby, or something like that. Once "outsiders" enter the picture, they might feel unsure, and then just refer to them by their full name, because of their uncertainty.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  ~Emily-Maria<br>  <br>  PS: When I was younger in school, I'd say as I introduced myself, "I'd prefer to be called Em." Your daughters could do the same, just in reverse :)|`|9b25119676cb60c00708b15f0c12ac6eaa	I understand exactly what you mean, because I love the name Giselle, but I hate the nickname Gigi. You as the parents have to emphasize that you want the child to be called by their full first name, which means every time a stranger, family member or friends attempts to call them by a nickname, correct them and tell them you would appreciate if they call the child by their proper name, and teach the child to do the same thing.|`|CLdn18wIaa	Trust me. Those girls will called Jackie & Vicky forever more. I dont like nicknames either. I have a son called Jody. I love the unusualness of it. And that it is saved from the horrible name of Joe by the Dee part.<br>  <br>  But now..guess what...he has started high school. And I heard the other day one of his friends calling him.'Hey Joe...Joe!!"<br>  <br>  What can you do.? I love the name Michael, but not Mike. And for girls, Elisabeth, but I wouldnt dare... I absolutely hate the name Liz.<br>  <br>  My name is Florence, and I will not tolerate being called Flo  but what a pain to have to correct people. <br>  <br>  Nicknames are always going to happen. Too bad though.|`|a1731418e68343f01ae82b7c12846cf2aa	You can't.  You can try to correct them when they're infants and small children, but people, especially in laws and parents, will call the baby as they wish.|`|3LEPfzVhaa	You call them by their proper names, and if people nickname them, they are nicknamed. Your daughters would rather have a name they prefer than one they are truly stuck with.|`|LWEfc0UOaa	it's more likely that they would WANT to be called Jackie or Vicky, because kids don't like old fashioned names and they want something more cool|`|rnOJn2UCaa	There are no guarentees, but the best way to handle the situation is to "power phrase" to people whom call her by a nickname. For an example when somebody is talking to you about your child and uses a nickname when you reply you use a sentence stating her full name e.g. "Yes Victoria, she .................".However you may find your daughter prefers her nickname, and over time you may be fighting a lossing battle.|`|7ih6Tx3Waa	Well, one way is to only let them have posh friends...<br>  <br>  Nicknames are a simple fact of life, and people will play hell with grammar to give you one regardless of how short your name already is.<br>  <br>  The names Victoria and Jacqueline are easily the biggest targets for re-styling, simply because of their 'Royal' nature. They sound 'posh'. Kids don't like 'posh'.<br>  <br>  I know plenty of girls named Victoria and ALL of them go by Vicky in both speech and writing. It's not a bad thing, and Vicky isn't a bad name.<br>  <br>  If you want same suggestions of names that are barely ever 'dolled up' then I will suggest a few nice ones:<br>  <br>  Jade<br>  Sarah<br>  Chloe<br>  Colette<br>  Clare / Claire<br>  Anne<br>  <br>  And a regional one:<br>  <br>  Niamh (Irish, pronounced Neeve)|`|WCvciOQCaa	No matter what you name your daughter, people will always find a nickname. Whether the nickname is related to her actual name or not. But you can always try...when she's little, and can't speak for herself, tell people that you prefer that they call her by her full name. As she gets older, it's really up to her!|`|dtANV3pNaa	Well I don't really know how to answer your question but I know that no matter what your name is you will still have a nickname It's really hard to have a name that won't have a nickname.<br>  <br>  Example:<br>  Lucy= LuLu, I love Lucy, Lucy Juicy, and a lot more<br>  Jackie=Jack, Jack o Lantern, Jackie Wakie<br>  Kevin= Kevin Seen Eleven<br>  <br>   Well I won't give you all the details but still hope you understand my answer|`|yKKESX5jaa	I don't think you can, because as your daughter gets older, she will choose what she would like to be called.  <br>  <br>  The best you can do is call her by this name at home, and reinforce why she should see it as a positive name.|`|qImMwhUHaa	When someone tried to nick name my children I would simply say "his name is Israel ....or Isaiah". I didn't name them Ize or Izzy...it irritates me but now all my family know what to call them. Now that they speak well they just tell the person, "that's not my name, my name is ....".|`|dc04cc16355f7402c67d1515087137a0aa	The parents must call her that, she has to write her name at school like that, sign her up for clubs and such with that name.<br>  But it might not be that other people use a nick name for her, she might not like the name.|`|6BdI1xnPaa	Jacqueline is going to be difficult!!<br>  <br>  Victoria - I have two friends with this name and neither was shortened!! But that's cause there mothers the whole time we were growing up corrected people!!!<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|sPWzvWehaa	You can ask people to call her by her first name.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	You can't.<br>  <br>  It's not your name. It's your daughter's. She'll decide what people call her once she gets past the age of about four.<br>  <br>  And, for goodness sake, you want your child to be called Jacqueline and nobody's allowed to shorten it? Are you deliberately trying to make her life hell?|`|dcd11iUwaa	i guess theres no way to stop it at school.<br>  if you hear people calling them nicknames you can correct them and hopefully they will stop.|`|8HQwcstIaa	Correct the problem before it becomes one.  For instance, when someone refers to your child as Jackie or Vicky, say, "Thanks, but we do call her Jacqueline/Victoria."<br>  <br>  My name is Stephanie, and people always try to call me Steph.  I simply correct them by saying, "Stephanie, please."  You child will learn to do the same.  It throws people for a second, as they didn't mean to offend or anything by calling me Steph (and they didn't), but then they smile, nod, and change the subject.|`|zThIaO0Qaa	u cant because when the child gets older she will decide what she wants to be called and more than likely it will be jackie and vickie besides ppl like to say names that arent a mouthful thats why most long names are shortened into something easier to say so leave it alone you can call em what you want but you cant make someone else do something|`|NBOBMQwdaa	When you introduce them, introduce them as Jaqueline and Victoria. Also, if you call your girls their full names from birth, it will just stick with them.<br>  <br>  I also dislike the nickname Vicky. If you think it is inevitable that they will get called nicknames, try Tori.|`|wTjNJEr1aa	well first of all, you have to call them by their actual names, and when you introduce them to new people, introduce them by their full names<br>  for example: "Hi, these are my daughters Jacqueline and Victoria."
4259a8b8fa5899f30c0e319fda9936fdaa	My family lives on the other side of the state from where I live.  When my daughter turned 1, i had a party here where we live.  I didn't send any invites to the out-of-town family, instead, I emailed a bunch of pictures of her eating cake with a "guess who turned 1!" heading.|`|9ko5WUFkaa	No.  Having a first birthday party is really more for the parents than the child.  It's not like your kid will even know it's his/her birthday or ever remember it.  First birthday parties seem kind of silly really, and so inviting distant friends and family that you are not in regular contact with does seem like just a grab for presents.  Don't invite them...<br>  <br>  Anyway, it's your party and you shouldn't feel you have to invite everyone you know out of some sort of social obligation - just invite the family and friends you are close to.|`|5GPDrBPLaa	Hmmm...you could send them an invitation just so they receive it.  Even though I know my relatives can't make it, I still send them an invitation for sentimental value.  Maybe you can follow up with an email or call to let them know you don't expect their attendance, but sending an invite anyway??|`|IuOxDlzCaa	if you dont mind who comes then just invite who you want and then its down to them to decide. on the contrary if you feel you need to invite people then dont.. you want it to be a nice day with people you like and your child likes.|`|vB9tjK9oaa	I think it is fine to send out invites for a first party - I think that a first birthday party is a big deal. I know when my daughter turned one a few months ago I wasn't sure what to do either, we had a huge party that I started planning about 4 months ahead of time, but I didn't send invites to family members who I knew would not be able to come because they lived far away, I also didn't know what to do because I didn't want them to think we wanted gifts, but if you want to send them invites and you think they might be able to come then go for it - most of my family sent gifts anyways because they knew she was turning one, so I probably could have sent them an invitation.|`|94a46d94405353b1f3f1de9ec8eeca2aaa	I would send them the invites, but if you are concerned they will take it as a plea for money and gifts, let them know verbally that you do not expect them to send presents.|`|9MIPAboSaa	Yes|`|AjqO1aJgaa	I wouldn't expect anyone to travel to a first birthday party - I'd just invite people who live locally. I'd tell the distant relatives that that's what you are doing and say that they are very welcome if they are in the area, though.|`|mbhAPC2naa	Yes, because they are still your family.
QKGuNLb4aa	yep it sux!!!! it makes me so mad when people start talking about being pregnant and not wanting it...especially when they know i am ttc, i mean come on that is just plane RUDE. if it were me though i would have to tell the "friend" a few things.... <br>  you could also offer to adopt her unwanted blessing.|`|z6BtwSE8aa	I feel exactly the same way you do. Next month it will be 2 years since I went off birth control, and nothing. I see all these women that don't want a baby or shouldn't be having one that get pregnant and I think, why is she being given this gift that she doesn't even want, but I that want it more that anything can't have it? Also see these women that have 17 and 18 kids and wonder why I can't have just one. It seems like everyday someone else I know is pregnant, but of course, not me. And it really makes mad sometimes when people say, "oh don't think about it so much", "it will happen when you stop stressing about it". How can I stop thinking about it when it's the one I thing I want the most?<br>  <br>  You know something else that annoys me? Women that are on here TTC for their 3rd or 4th child and talk about how depressed they are because they are having a hard time with it. Seriously, don't you realize you have been blessed already? You already have what a lot of us want and can't seem to get. I would be happy if I could have just one baby. Ok rant over haha.|`|bKK2fPiVaa	I feel the same way.  People who don't want kids or "aren't trying" get pregnant from LOOKING at sperm.  Those of us who really truly want a family have to go through all the trials, up and downs and emotional roller coasters.  It's not easy but my only consolation is that I really WANT my child whenever God graces me! I can tell that child when they are older how much I wanted them and everything I did to bring them into the world.|`|ObngKaoWaa	aww honey,i'm sorry, i know it is unfair.i feel bad for the baby,the fact that she is drinking a smoking cud really affect the baby badly.abortion is too scary in my eyes so god help this child!! and sweety dont be so upset,god willing,it will happen for u soon!!!
M8qLP7MLaa	Chase Austin if it's a boy. I really like the name Chase.

cf59b7a86d3c85c41cac7a7189fbda41aa	Well if your cramping is bad you really should see your doctor as soon as you can. Any abdominal pain needs to be taken seriously, it could be signs your are going into preterm labor. I had a misscarriage at 10 weeks and it started with bleeding and clots then i had massive cramps and ended up having a misscarriage. So dont waste time on wondering you need to see your doctor. Hope all is well, good luck to you!|`|TvYX1yXWaa	yes its normal i had cramping to at the beginning of my pregnancy|`|U4bpcK7Caa	Oh yes it is completely normal now if the pain is just unbearable or if the cramping comes with spotting/bleeding go see a doctor as soon as you can. I have had 3 miscarriages and those three came with cramping and spotting I never made it past week 7...But I am now 13 weeks pregnant and I do cramp but everything is just great right now|`|65c3a43eeb4a3522546497113c17b8fbaa	Yes, it's normal.

C4ibOR7Laa	i know what you mean<br>  before i found out i was pregnant, i was 6 DPO and i had some light pink spotting, i bought this really rubbish test for ￡1 and took it, not even in the morning, it had a seriously faint line, the next morning i used a first response, and it was completely negative, i couldn't believe it, i took it our the plastic thing and held it against the window and everything lol there was just no line there at all, i still knew i was pregnant though, so i waited till the morning of my period and used the other first response(i got a box of 2) and there was a faint line on it then. im now 17weeks pregnant, but i know what your saying about first response|`|ADjrKpcdaa	I'm the same at the moment my period is due on 10th march and i did a pregnancy test on Thurs evening which had a faint line then did another one the next morning and got a negative.

CdJtH0xdaa	That is very rude of her to do, especially when there are people in the room who weren't invited. In fact, she shouldn't really have been talking about the party, because there are obviously people who weren't invited. Thus, it was rude of her not just to be talking about the party in front of you, but she shouldn't have been talking about the party at all. If you WANTED to say something, you should have said something such as, "You shouldn't be talking about a party that people aren't invited to." Something that would have hinted that you weren't invited, and obviously annoyed with her talking about the party would have been good. But, I think it was good that you ignored her and didn't say anything. You do have a right to be pissed off, because that was a really mean and careless thing for her to say. Anyway, best of luck to you.|`|1s3nddaYaa	are you all friends? or ex lovers? she just might be one of those girls trying to find popularity.  but if she doesn't know you then no you have no reason to be mad. but if you do know here and you two talk and hang out, then ask her what he problem is or explain why she doesn't want you there. if she doesn't want you there, then she is to wrapped up into being a snobby person and you can find someone better to hang out with.|`|7SCjPftKaa	Are you even friends with her?

nISYAHkfaa	As others have said here, your doctor will prescribe the right kind of antibiotic, and you can take Tylenol for the pain . . . <br>  <br>  In addition, sucking on hard candies can help (but be careful not to cause your mouth to blister by sucking on too many, lol). Don't do sugarless candies, since some artificial sweeteners could be harmful to baby.

You should definitely talk to him if you think it was an inappropriate punishment.  Do you both usually handle punishments, or does one of you usually handle it?  Not that it makes a difference really, but if your husband is usually the one to hand out punishments he may have just done so without considering that he would need to discuss it with you first.  Any time you're uncomfortable with something he did, you should talk about it, so it doesn't happen again or so that you guys have a better idea of how to handle things in a joint manner.|`|e8yt5PrGaa	yes u need to and that was too harsh for a 3rd  grader. actually its abuse in the united states and in Canada ..and most European Nations <br>  <br>  However there is a great deal of wisdom in what Jim says below ..so if you want an alternative opinion then i kindly refer you to his ..

Leaving marks is child abuse.  You need to protect your son.|`|a8e2130188e45facab4c16a4a764104caa	Did he write the words on the desk or just on paper?<br>  What is an 8 year old lad doing knowing and using swear words?<br>  <br>  If a kid is "sent home" because of truly unacceptable behavior [and without reasonable cause], then parents need to make sure the child finds being sent home to be a very unpleasant event.<br>  <br>  IMO, an 8 year old is somewhat young for the belt though maybe not too young. Of course there is a considerable difference of getting the belt on the seat of the trousers and getting it on the bare.<br>  <br>  How long after he got the belting did you come home and see the red "markes" on his "buttock"? And what about his other buttock?<br>  <br>  Perhaps you could have spoke some comforting words to your son OR at least have let him talk about what he got (and why). <br>  <br>  What issue do you want to bring up with his father (your husband)? A few "red marks" isn't all that much even if still showing for a little while. Bruising would be a concern though ... probably excessive number of licks or excessively severe.<br>  <br>  Of course husband and wife should be able to calmly talk about anything, any concern. And mother should talk with father about the "altercation", about how "hard" the spanking was; about how much their son's backside had been hurting, and for how long, etc. And about WHY he had that "altercation" at school and about what they can do to HELP him change his behavior in the future.<br>  .<br>  BUT, what was the "altercation" all about anyway?  That could be an "extenuating" circumstance.<br>  <br>  I did and do question the use of the belt at 8 years of age; but I also think with just one side of the "story" we don't have enough information to know whether it was abuse (bruising,  welts, etc.) or whether it was just a few "red marks" that would disappear within an hour or less.  We do not know whether the misbehavior was a repetitive thing, whether he had been cautioned, etc. before. We were not told if it was belt on trousers or on bare. We are not told if it is a loving and affectionate family. AND, having been sent home from school (if for justifiable reasons), instead of the belt, he could have been required to just sit unamused at least until normal school dismissal time, and then did his "homework".<br>  <br>  We just were not provided with adequate information; so I would tend to side with the father in that case. The mother did say that he was spanked "quite hard". She didn't see it happen, she didn't hear it happen, she doesn't say anything about bruising, etc. And was it 3 "quite hard" licks of the belt on the trousers, or was it 30 "quite hard" licks on the bare. One might have been needed to "get his attention"; the other certainly would be very excessive and abusive.<br>  .<br>  I'll accept the 10 points; but Andrew seems to still be owed a spanking.<br>  .|`|smFfcmYuaa	If your kid stops acting out then let it be. If your kid keeps acting out even though your husband beats him then obviously that's not the solution.<br>  <br>  By the way, getting sent home from school is a reward not a punishment. What a ******* moron principal.|`|cMksTuRhaa	You need to let him know that you are against this type of punishment and you both need to sit down and discuss how you will discipline your son in the future.  You need to set up rules for your son and for yourselves.|`|8TMM0uTnaa	Uh..yeah....belts usually leave red marks.  <br>  <br>  And maybe if your son hadn't been acting like a little idiot at school, he wouldn't have had to get spanked.   There's an ineffective parent in that household, but it's not your husband...|`|rNvXWMOMaa	Bring up the issue for God's sake.,<br>  No one should be beat with a belt.<br>  I'm not against spankings as long as it is with the palm of the<br>  hand on the buttocks.|`|bZZAYIv6aa	Yes speak with him.<br>  I believe in spanking, but not when your angry.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	A belt is not a spanking. <br>  Its abuse|`|a1uoxczTaa	personally, i would end up beating my husband with a belt if that happened to my child... but that is just me|`|AaZCmTGUaa	I would talk to him because if something minor like this incident at school evokes a reaction like that in your husband I am wondering what he is going to do if your son really does something wrong. <br>  <br>  Besides, punishment should not leave marks on one's body. There are other, just as effective, forms of punishment. Taking away privileges has worked with my son since he was about three years old. <br>  <br>  The only time severe punishment in form of spanking (or beating, which is the correct term for your husband's reaction) is appropriate when something worse than red marks or a bruise could happen due to irresponsible behavior.|`|98qMZZPlaa	Sorry~~  Dont care what anyone else says, Your son deserved it!

Don't question your husbands authority.  If you let the boy get away with it, he would just think it would be alright to do such things|`|DnNkCF6Taa	I would say as a man who believes in spanking personally, as far as using a belt on a 3rd grader I would say to bring it up with your husband.  But to do so away from your son, that way to still be an united front.  But I would agree that your son should have been spanked, not for the fact of what he did but because he lied to his father.  Though I would say if you feel strongly about spanking you need to talk to your husband and talk it out with him, and get some idea where it is and is not acceptable, at least try to approach it calmly.  Then when you guys do decide on it, then you should stick with it.<br>  <br>  This is a tough question as you will get some people who will say that any kind of spanking is abuse and some that will say that spanking is fine and they agree with what is done.  Personally I believe spanking should be involved in the parenting of children , but not a belt at a young age. <br>  <br>  But there is a simple guide to if you should bring it up with your husband or not.  If it is as simple as you feel you should ask the question if it was right, it is really a conversation you should have with your husband after the fact.  As there is going to be no concise answer you can find here, as how you raise your children while getting advice from others is really you and your husband's decision.  So I would say, yes go ahead and talk it out, because you have to know that it would probably come up again, and it is better to talk it out now before it becomes a set pattern.|`|Urs6AQQvaa	Spankings should be discussed between the both of you. Personally if my husband spanked my children with a belt and left Welp marks I would bring it up to him. Don't get offesive or anything just have a regular conversation on why he did it and why he didn't discuss wih you on how to discipline him... Belts I think are a bit too old fashioned, meaning that now a days aren't a good idea of discipline since it is sempt to be a form of child abuse... especially if your son went to school and told or showed the teacher that can get Defax out there faster that you could bet.  Anyways, you really should talk to your husband about it... it's good communication
P0Fjh59Eaa	Well...actually babies do have a "blue-ish" tent to their eyes when they are born. it can take up to 2 yrs before a child's eye color remains one color. <br>  <br>  2 of my 4 children have grey-blue eyes (like me), 2 have green eyes (like my husband), my youngest child's eyes didn't turn to green till just a few months ago and he's not yet 2 yrs old so they can still change.<br>  <br>  and yes, even black babies can have blue eyes. i went to school w/a boy in high school that had the most beautiful blue eyes, and his sister had greenish brown eyes.  so it is possible.<br>  <br>  see-<br>  <a href="http://teamsugar.com/group/72541/blog/1983237" rel="nofollow">http://teamsugar.com/group/72541/blog/19...</a><br>  <br>  that baby has naturally blue eyes. it does occur in blacks and other races which usually have light to dark brown eyes. it's rare, but it happens.<br>  for instance, Venessa Williams and her brother both have light eyes.|`|3K7ffKn2aa	She's wrong, not all babies  have blue eyes at birth. I have seen many babies with brown eyes (white and black).<br>  <br>  And your wrong not all black babies eyes change colors if they are blue at birth. I know a guy who is black and has deep blue eyes. <br>  <br>  Blue eyes are just a recessive trait and both parents would have to have that gene for it to appear. But many babies do have blueish eyes at birth.|`|F44b2np9aa	My eyes were nearly black (very dark brown) when I was born, and I am white. All my kids had brown eyes when they were born and both myself and my husband are white - but with dark hair and eyes. Over the years my eyes have actually become lighter in color. It is said your eyes change color seven times in your life!|`|7AtxrHQnaa	I was born with brown eyes, so was one of my daughters.  My other 2 kids were born with blue but they stayed blue.  So, no not all babies are born with blue eyes.|`|h7i9Ngu9aa	not at all my baby was born with dark brown eyes and both me and her father are white and we also were born with brown eyes|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Lots of white babies do have blue eyes at birth, but my son didn't, his were dark gray, almost black.|`|pvH3oHRfaa	Most white babies are born with blue eyes yes. But most black, asian and mixed race babies are born with brown.<br>  <br>  It can take months for a babies true colour to come through, and they can keep changing for years.<br>  <br>  So you're both sort of right!
CdJtH0xdaa	It is YOUR baby; not your parents'. You can do what you want with the baby, and your parents and your little sister cannot tell you otherwise. If your parents don't want another baby in the house, I would suggest trying to live with your sister. You just have to tell your parents that you are planning to live with your sister. Also, if you want to press charges against the person who raped you, I would suggest you do it. He is the father of your unborn child, so he should have a right to pay child support if you want to keep the child. Good luck to you.|`|1V3eQRu5aa	I don't mean to be rude, but in the last few hours you have asked this question like four/five times, and tons of people have given helpful, detailed, thoughtful answers which you could read.<br>  <br>  If people are answering your question wrong, then you should tell us how you want the answer to read, and what it needs to include.<br>  <br>  Also, ask at different times of day, then you will be answered by a wider range of people. For example, in the evening, older more experienced people may have come back from work who can relate to your parents' issues, or with professional opinions regarding pregnancy, and law, etc.. Or at midday, teenageers who might relate to you could answer.|`|aDQgLEbuaa	I just got this great advice, don't ever let yourself become the victim, ever.  Definitely press charges against this guy, if you don't he might do it to another girl.  Then the cycle will just repeat itself, do something now...and I'm sorry about what happened.|`|sKTmxnx1aa	Yes! Definitely press charges against him! Don't let him get away with doing something that horrible! And honey, if you want to keep the baby, than you keep it! No one has the right to force you to get an abortion if you don't want it! Talk to your parents. Tell them that there are people who get abortions and never recover from the guilt of what they have done. Tell them that you know you can take care of the baby well, and if they don't listen, stay with your sister. Hope this helps, and good luck!

It is an ugly occupational surname.  It also rhymes with Pooper.  Rouri looks ethnic and/or made-up.  Greyson is very tryndee right now.<br>  <br>  Are you pronouncing Violette, vee-oh-LETTE?  If not, the spelling should be Violet (pronounced VYE-uh-leht).  This will reduce confusion.<br>  <br>  Dakota is a pseudo-American Indian name and sounds lower-class.  Meyer is a surname and I hate surnames for girls' first names.  Emmeline sounds too Southern.  <br>  <br>  Why not try Violet Elyse?  I think it has a nice flow, and it would be wonderful to have a niece named for you.  =)|`|dK6YGyNyaa	My favourites are Violette Emma (but I'd spell it Violet) and Thomas Cooper.|`|Yw8X1aXsaa	i like all of the except the last 2 boy names and dakota reese. my favorite two are Erica Emmeline and Wilson Emmett|`|TrBoPj92aa	my sister had a baby last night! she called him aaron =) he's so cute and he's a tiny little preemie weighed 3lbs 9oz !!<br>  <br>  good luck to your sister i think <br>  <br>  dakota elyse<br>  +<br>  willson cooper|`|qz0DXpauaa	Girl - Erica<br>  Boy - Mitchel<br>  the other names are horrible<br>  xx|`|EnYKNyPxaa	dakota reese and rouri greyson|`|pNagjehGaa	For a girl I like <br>  Meyer Elyse (not just cause it's named after you! :o)<br>  <br>  And for a boy, I like Mitchel Alex, but I'd reverse it so its Alex Mitchel, flows better. <br>  <br>  Rouri Greyson is sure different though.|`|3AXlgGgUaa	EEEEEEEK.<br>  <br>  Your sister's taste in girls name is just awful!<br>  <br>  And what kind of name is Rouri? lol<br>  <br>  Violette is just about passable.<br>  <br>  My fav boy name is...Thomas i guess. <br>  <br>  Can't have "Hey, Wilson!" and Mitch.|`|iqku0QOQaa	Wow i actually adore all those names! <br>  My fav girls would have to be Dakota Reese and boys Thomas Cooper.<br>  I love the name Elyse too, lucky! :) x|`|ZDjmDuuyaa	Thomas cooper  (just like that) sorry couldn't resist.|`|6VFDoSrjaa	Let her decide because if, at some later date the child hated the name, you'll get blamed.|`|6lL4hwM6aa	Violette Emma and Mitchel Alex|`|fAN8snFdaa	Dakota Reece <br>  Thomas Cooper OR Wilson Emmet|`|4b5IQWcFaa	i like<br>  <br>  erica emmeline<br>  dakota reese<br>  elsye meyer<br>  violette emma<br>  <br>  <br>  thomas cooper<br>  mitchel alex|`|mSJwKrQIaa	I like All of the names on here! But some more than others. Heres a list of ratings and opinions. ;) :<br>  <br>  Dakota Reese Tenner - (9/10) Stylish and completely adorable! The names work perfectly together, and their very nice with the last name. <br>  Meyer Elyse Tenner - (10/10) My favourite for the girls. It would have been PERFECT, but Meyer Tenner sounds too matchy. (: I love this name though! Original, sweet and beautiful.<br>  Violette Emma Tenner - (7/10) I don't particularly like the name Violette -(But thats just me.) But when put together with Emma, it works quite nicely for a cute, sweet and feminine name. <br>  Erica Emmeline Tenner - (9/10) I love the name Erica. It's adorable and quirky. Together with Emmeline, it makes it totally gorgeus. xD<br>  <br>  Wilson Emmet Tenner - (10/10) I love this name, i think it's cute but handsome. The names flow very nicely together. The only problem i would have, would be that the fathers name is Will. There initials would be the same (with mail, it's slightly annoying..) and if anyone tried to call them both Will, it might get slightly confusing.<br>  Thomas Cooper Tenner - (8/10) I love the names Thomas and Cooper, especially together. But Cooper Tenner and Thomas Tenner sound too 'Rhymey'. (: Other than that; The name is perfect.<br>  Rouri Greyson Tenner - (10/10) This would have to be my favourite for the boys. (; Rouri is ADORABLE! Greyson is original and sweet and together it is amazingly cute and masculine at the same time.<br>  Mitchel Alex Tenner - (10/10) I love the name Mitchel anyway, it's original, not too common, and it's attractive, but not too hard (masculine). Together with Alex and Tenner, it's great.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped.

The best advice I can give you is don't be selfish.  You are in no position to raise a baby, you're a child and cannot provide for this baby.  Unless your parents or his parents want to take responsibility for raising this child, put the child up for adoption or have an abortion.  If you're going to have an abortion, I suggest you do it as soon as possible.|`|GuFwv7Vzaa	Well, firs i think you should talk to you ex boyfriend and see what is his position on the pregnancy thing... Then talk to some psychologist and ask him some advices...

This is a choice that must be addressed ASAP!  You will be surprised at the outcome, but don't wait!  Tell your parents NOW!!!!!!|`|olZSUi2paa	My 15 year old sister got pregnant last year. We never knew till she was 8 months pregnant, so tell them soon!|`|6Q698g4Paa	Not sure specifically what kind of advice you are looking for. <br>  <br>  I won't lecture you on having sex let alone being pregnant at 14 although it is extremely young.<br>  <br>  You must tell your parents asap. Waiting any longer will only make things worse. The rest of the decisions are up to you and only you can make them. Do you want to be a mother at 14/15? What is best for your baby? You raising him/her or adoption.<br>  <br>  The only advice I can really give you is that YOU have to make all decisions moving forward. If you let others make them you will probably regret it later down the road.|`|m7KsIg6Raa	You are to young to have sex so suffer the consequences, you should of used a condom or something your life is basicly over now u have to stay home from school cause u have to look over this little new lifeunless u decide to have an abortion of something, but u chose to have sex. the good thing is you seem very calm about it which is a good way to start in telling  your parents. But i wouldn't have an abortion do adoption or something, do not kill the worlds furture leader.
ZDMUW1YRaa	I am in the same situation,  what city do you live in?  First of all to get medicaid you need to apply through the public social services office in your city.  BUT...you need to find a fee neighborhood clinic, what they do is give you something called presumptive medicare, basically its for 2 months or so to cover prenatal care until your application gets approved or denied.  have her fill out an app and turn it in to social services office make sure she gets a reciept for turning that in because if for some reason your presumptive medical expires and medical has not made a decision that reciept will extend it another 2 weeks.  presumptive medical is available same day for pregnant women, find a fee neighborhood clinic, you will walk out iwth medical for a month or two until you cna go through the application process through social services.  I would also apply for WIC and see if you qualify for food stamps and cash aid since she lost her job.  I'm sorry you have to live on such a tight salry, it will get better. Luckliy your income, depending on your family size can qualify you for state assistance.|`|ZA3N1wE4aa	Yes, absolutely.<br>  <br>  She'll need to call the Health Department and they should be able to direct her to the right places to go to get on Medicaid. Even if you two were to marry and your income stayed at $12,000 a year, she still should be able to get medicaid.|`|7SKVCPcSaa	well having no job is a sure fired way to get it! so she shoudl be good to go.|`|Bw1h5xAcaa	Yes, she will definitely qualify. If you aren't living with her, they won't look at your income, only hers. And if she's unemployed then obviously she has no real substantial income and she will qualify for maternity medicaid. She needs to call her county's human services department to find out how to apply.|`|SaeUxO6Gaa	To be perfectly frank, I wouldn't recommend going through with the pregnancy under those circumstances.
DTe1dumFaa	IT may be amniotic fluid but ...<br>  Take care as you may have a severe yeast infection. Sometimes these have no odour and don't even itch. You can feel like you are leaking a lot of fluid when it is a thrush type of infection.  These infections can behave very differently in preganant women. <br>  If you leaved an infection untreated that could also send you into preterm labour so either way you need to get yourelf to  doctor straigh away!<br>  A simple paper dip in test at the doctor's clinic or hospital will tell them whether this is amniotic flud or not.<br>  I am very surprised at your doctor's irresponsible answer - you should consider changing doctors...|`|ZbnxGIsnaa	My suggestion for you is to put a pad on and if you soak through it in less then an hour I'd call your OB and tell them what's happen. <br>  <br>  Hopefully this doesn't embarrass you, but when I was at that stage.  The baby pushes really hard on your pubic region you can actually pee without realizing it.  Oh yes!  That's right!  Little tinkles.  =)  Normally the pee as a sweet smell and I think the amniotic fluid has a almost chemically smell.  I'm pretty sure!<br>  <br>  Edit:  What does the fluid look like?<br>  Amniotic fluid can be clear, pink, brown, or green. It also has an unusual smell that some people compare to Comet cleanser. If the fluid looks yellowish and smells of ammonia, you're probably experiencing urine leakage. This frequently happens to women toward the end of pregnancy.|`|FmSWPS7Paa	YOU SHOULD BE AT THE HOSPITAL. any time your leaking that means your membranes ruputured. and its slowly leaking out. your putting your baby at risk of infection. i would go to the hospital asap!<br>  does it come out when your sitting standing? sneezing or coughing?|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	You could be leaking amniotic fluid and it is common actually towards the end and usually the baby's head "plugs up" the leak.  I am surprised though that she doesn't want to examine you.  The good news is that amniotic fluid is constantly being produced so you wouldn't have to worry about fluid levels as long as the trickle doesn't become more like a gush.
z6IekuwSaa	I think it's just a phase. <br>  However, do keep an eye on it along with other symptoms. My nephew did this and it was one of the symptoms he had of autism. Some other common ones are constant diaper rash and lots of ear infections. <br>  I don't think he is autistic, but I did want to give you a couple other symptoms to look for, just in case. Because early intervention in autism produces the best outcome.|`|gJrHBtp1aa	My son went through that for about 3-4 months. I think it was a combination of teething and growing pains. There's still a few nights he'll wake up screaming. See if he has any teeth popping through, if so give him some motrin before going to bed.|`|hl5cZxO2aa	This happens in most of the cases in infants. Infants cannot speak. So  they cry. We cannot understand the reason for this. Baby might have pains due to teeth at this age. Problem of no clear motion, indigestion of mather's milk, Some insect might have biteen to him.<br>  Stomach problem, might have eat some thing on floor. Many reasons<br>  Best is to consult pediatric doctor in such case if you feel the problem measure.

I follow Hindu religion and Indian culture alot more so as I was raised by my mother alone who is Indian and I feel comfortable with who I am. But its other people who sometimes treat me like an outsider that really gets on my nerves. Referring to me as white even though I am mixed race, I know I am very fair skinned, green eyes ect.... but that doesn't change my race or my identity. As far as your baby's future please do not be concerned all you can do is raise s/he to know who they are and be proud of it its other people who need to sort their opinions out.|`|8kaDm2D8aa	i'm white & my bf is black, we have a 7month old daughter.  she will know both sides of her family.  i agree w/the 1st guy, it's society.  when they see my daughter they will see a black woman, not 1/2 white & 1/2 black.  i think it goes back to the 1 drop law.  just instill good morals & values in your child & they will be just fine.|`|7b5d7721387ea9716cf48828f5d4cc1caa	The first guy put it perfectly.

Some of it depends where you live too.  If you live in more of a city area its more readily accepted.|`|f4c35d4729f3cfcc287328ffc6b7f9a8aa	I think it's because they may not identify easily with one side's heritage or the other.  You know, how people say "I'm Irish" or "I'm Italian" when actually they're usually a mix unless they're still in the old country.  <br>  <br>  Having said that, my daughter's boyfriend is bi-racial, and he says he's black, because that's what people see when they look at him, so he goes with it.  :)  I think it's whatever you want to be in this day and age.  Good luck with baby!
r7q8LW7Aaa	It's not recommended any more as it can cross the placenta, causing baby to poop, which could be inhaled during labour causing infection.<br>  i tried it with my first before I was warned of the dangers. I was a week overdue and desperate. I was very VERY sick (both ends, sorry TMI) and hardly slept that night as I felt so awful. I'm glad I never went into labour then, I would have been too exhausted and sick to handle it.<br>  I strongly recommend against it.|`|ZA3N1wE4aa	It's very dangerous for your baby. It can cause the baby to inhale/ingest meconium (baby poop, basically) and that can be very harmful. <br>  <br>  I know it's tempting and I really feel for you (I've had kidney stones, too), but it's not worth the risk. You're almost there. You can wait just a few more days.|`|FmSWPS7Paa	its heard to work but it makes you poop lots n have a stomach ache. it might also harm your baby.

Anyway, I tried it, did NOTHING, not even give me diarrhea. It's worthless and tastes disgusting. The girls that say they went into labor from it were already going into labor. Don't waste your time.<br>  <br>  EDIT - alright bitches, give me thumbs down if you'd like, but I speak the truth.|`|lGBifqziaa	i wouldn't recommend that as it can harm the baby and i heard it causes big time diarrhea and that could be dangerous in labour. for me the best thing was sex with my partner  my labour started 2 hours later. in the meantime relax and have a lot of nice warm baths .|`|AA12138902	for that labor for me its hard to get in cause around me there is so simple life so, but for sure do any thing you need know it well what are you doing then you could clear about the good point I guess .|`|wENdWT5kaa	The only thing it will do is make you sit on the toilet with diarrhea and cramping. It could also pass to your baby which then will cause him/her to have a bowel movement in utero which will jeopardize the babies health. <br>  <br>  So, no Castor oil is a BAD idea.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	I suggest that evening primrose oil caplets would be just as effective - place them near your cervix before a nap to ripen it.   For me I was taking them orally until the midwife suggested otherwise and I was in labor in about 24 hours.

I really like the fact that it can be plugged in, as well as taking batteries if you want so it's portable. It hasn't once picked up peoples phones like they can at times, and I have dropped it numerous times and still goes.|`|fLxJHlbNaa	There are many monitors on the market today and some really hi-tech, so needless to say they would be expensive. The Safey First Crystal Clear Monitor is affordable for most household budgets and has a good reputation.  The monitor offers crystal-clear reception.
Ql09WZa8aa	Scientifically, the woman should not orgasm as the orgasm releases acids which kills the sperms carrying the boy's genes. <br>  <br>  Loically, I believe what God wants will happen and all this is a matter os statistics nothing proven, cause if there was anything proves really you would find the percentage of boys to girls much higher than this...<br>  Good Luck|`|ZbnxGIsnaa	Your wife doesn't need to orgasm in order to get pregnant, but it does help.

OCk7I8JVaa	are you on clomid? because that sounds like side effects from clomid too.|`|QFNvYVtyaa	Pregnancy symptoms differ from woman to woman and pregnancy to pregnancy; however, one of the most significant pregnancy symptoms is a delayed or missed menstrual cycle. Understanding the signs and symptoms of pregnancy is important because each symptom may be related to something other than pregnancy. Some women experience signs or symptoms of pregnancy within a week of conception. For other women, pregnancy symptoms may develop over a few weeks or may not be present at all. Below is a listing of some of the most common pregnancy signs symptoms. If you have been sexually active and experiencing any of the following symptoms it is important to take a pregnancy test.<br>  <br>  <br>  Implantation bleeding can be one of the earliest pregnancy symptoms. About 6-12 days after conception, the embryo implants itself into the uterine wall. Some women will experience spotting as well as some cramping. <br>  <br>  Other Explanations: Actual menstruation, altered menstruation, changes in birth control pill, infection, or abrasion from intercourse.<br>  <br>  <br>  A delayed or missed menstruation is the most common pregnancy symptom leading a woman to test for pregnancy. When you become pregnant, your next period should be missed. Many women can bleed while they are pregnant, but typically the bleeding will be shorter or lighter than a normal period.<br>  <br>  Other Explanations: Excessive weight gain/loss, fatigue, hormonal problems, tension, stress, ceasing to take the birth control pill, or breast-feeding.<br>  <br>  Swollen/Tender Breasts:<br>  Swollen or tender breasts is a pregnancy symptom which may begin as early as 1-2 weeks after conception. Women may notice changes in their breasts; they may be tender to the touch, sore, or swollen. <br>  <br>  Other Explanations: Hormonal imbalance, birth control pills, impending menstruation (PMS) can also cause your breasts to be swollen or tender.<br>  <br>  Fatigue/Tiredness:<br>  Feeling fatigued or more tired is a pregnancy symptom which can also start as early as the first week after conception. <br>  <br>  Other Explanations: Stress, exhaustion, depression, common cold or flu, or other illnesses can also leave you feeling tired or fatigued.<br>  <br>  Nausea/Morning Sickness:<br>  This well-known pregnancy symptom will often show up between 2-8 weeks after conception. Some women are fortunate to not deal with morning sickness at all, while others will feel nauseous throughout most of their pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Other Explanations: Food poisoning, stress, or other stomach disorders can also cause you to feel queasy.<br>  <br>  Backaches:<br>  Lower backaches may be a symptom that occurs early in pregnancy; however, it is common to experience a dull backache throughout an entire pregnancy. <br>  <br>  Other Explanations: Impending menstruation, stress, other back problems, and physical or mental strains.<br>  <br>  Headaches:<br>  The sudden rise of hormones in your body can cause you to have headaches early in pregnancy. <br>  <br>  Other Explanations: Dehydration, caffeine withdrawal, impending menstruation, eye strain, or other ailments can be the source of frequent or chronic headaches.<br>  <br>  Frequent Urination:<br>  Around 6-8 weeks after conception, you may find yourself making a few extra trips to the bathroom. <br>  <br>  Other Explanations: Urinary tract infection, diabetes, increasing liquid intake, or taking excessive diuretics.<br>  <br>  Darkening of Areolas:<br>  If you are pregnant, the skin around your nipples may get darker. <br>  <br>  Other Explanations: Hormonal imbalance unrelated to pregnancy or may be a leftover effect from a previous pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Food Cravings:<br>  <br>  While you may not have a strong desire to eat pickles and ice cream, many women will feel cravings for certain foods when they are pregnant. This can last throughout your entire pregnancy. <br>  <br>  Other Explanations: Poor diet, lack of a certain nutrient, stress, depression, or impending menstruation.
AA11659150	I would say that you can take one as soon as about 4 days before your expected period, BUT you might not get a positive yet (even if it is).  If you do miss your period, then you definitely need to take one.  A blood test can be done by your doctor sooner though, if you are really suspicious.  GL<br>  <br>  I got a positive test at about 5 wks preg (or about one wk late on my period).|`|uuHPneEcaa	u can take a pregnancy test (first responce) 5 days before ur period (as soon as u wake up). I took my test when I was 5days late and it was positive.<br>  <br>  its too soon to tell right now.|`|F8iyUqJBaa	Well if you've conceived you don't need to take a test, but it's usually a good idea to wait until after you've missed your period to test.|`|GpdYgi4Zaa	no. you should wait til AF comes (when your due next) if you miss that than take a test about a week or a week and a half after you miss it. Right now it would be way to early to test positive.|`|GLJkGgloaa	For me it was 10 days.<br>  First Response Pregnancy test.<br>  Two lines showed up right away.|`|78FXygtoaa	id wait atleast another week.|`|PFJ7ZbVZaa	I took a test a week before I was supposed to even get my period and I got a positive test.  I was about 2-3 weeks pregnant at that time.  It all depends on the hormone levels in your urine.  The best time to take a home pregnancy test is with your first morning urine.  There's more hormones in that urine than any other time of the day.|`|KyhnSRrJaa	It's most accurate if you wait until the day you're supposed to get your period.  I took mine the day before my period, and it did come back positive though.  Just stick to close to the time when your period is supposed to come.|`|1RWI4vX0aa	End of next week you would have more positive idea if you are pregnant or not.<br>  <br>  Wait for a while.|`|AA12168271	no you dummy it takes at least 6weeks|`|fTd509Qzaa	you have to wait till you miss your period

I've seen the Pooh one and it's really wobbly and doesn't seem safe, car seat included.<br>  <br>  Having said that, I know how it is to really want a particular something, especially if this is your first child.

A friend of mine has a Winnie the Pooh stroller and doesn't like it.  All car seats that are sold now meet all safety standards so you don't have to spend a lot of money.  You can use the other $100 for other baby necessities (like clothes, diapers, formula-if you are formula feeding, etc).  You also want one that can be used with a boy or girl in case you have another baby so you don't have to spend money on strollers again.|`|pqzKlNudaa	Get the cheapest one 100 dollars they are the same.|`|LcHBkYFJaa	$ 100|`|zCZDiCbwaa	save ur self a 100 and buy other accesories ..

Just playing devil's advocate, perhaps, but maybe your daughter doesn't despise her time there as much as you think... at 5 years old, Im sure it is very difficult for her to leave your house, since she spends most of her time there.  But I would guess that once she is in CA for the summer, she probably enjoys her time with her dad too--if she really was acting miserable all summer, he would probably recognize that and want what is best for her.  Try to keep your daughter's interests at heart too--it is important for her to have a relationship with her dad, even if summer is the only time that is possible...|`|v0z5Nyypaa	It's about 12 or 13.  Ask  lawyer in your state.  Many will give advice over the phone.|`|2pBCA1woaa	i think you mean 16
OvpkQfG1aa	You do understand that you don't ovulate the same day every cycle, don't you? And it's usually not on day 14. The only way to know when you ovulated almost down to the day is to do basal body temping and observe your thermal shift. Your luteal phase (days AFTER ovulation) is what is consistent.<br>  <br>  You can bleed after having an anovulatory (no ovulation) cycle. It's technically not a period, but it is vaginal bleeding.|`|QFNvYVtyaa	It is hard to predict when the next menstrual period will return after a D&C, a gynecological procedure often used to remove tissue from the uterus after a miscarriage. During pregnancy, your body produces a hormone called hCG, which suppress the pituitary gland's production of other hormones that normally stimulate ovulation (release of an egg). The hCG level drops after the pregnancy tissue is removed during the D&C. It must drop to zero before your cycles resume. Although the length of time it takes for this to occur depends predominantly on the value of hCG present before the miscarriage, hCG suppression of the pituitary gland usually subsides within two weeks. Rarely, a small amount of placental tissue is left behind at the time of the D&C. In this case, a woman may experience persistent bleeding along with a delay in the fall of hCG levels and the return to normal cycles.<br>  <br>  Once the hCG levels fall, your pituitary gland begins secreting the stimulatory hormones LH and FSH, and ovulation resumes. If the hCG levels were low at the time of the D&C, normal ovulation can return about two to three weeks after the D&C. Alternatively, if the fall in hCG is delayed, the first ovulation may occur three to six weeks later. As ovulation occurs two weeks before the menstrual period, you can, in fact, get pregnant before your first post-D&C menstrual period. If you do not ovulate, and your menses were irregular before the pregnancy, all bets are off. <br>  <br>  Is it safe to get pregnant immediately? <br>  <br>  That depends. Pregnancy without an intervening menstrual period can make managing the pregnancy more difficult, as your obstetrician will need to follow you more closely to accurately determine your due date. Additionally, after a D&C, there can be a low-grade inflammatory response in the uterus that may interfere with pregnancy, making the risk of repeat miscarriage a bit higher in the first post-D&C cycle. <br>  <br>  If you have had miscarriages before, it is important that you and your physician try to determine the cause before you attempt to get pregnant again. Many women are discouraged after a miscarriage and rush to try again, without taking the necessary steps to avoid a subsequent miscarriage. In their haste to conceive again, these women condemn themselves to more suffering and potentially another pregnancy loss. The most difficult part of managing recurrent pregnancy loss is to address the emotional aspects that often interfere with completion of a comprehensive evaluation and treatment plan.|`|44ccf078ecbbb80711e26204438034abaa	Yep.<br>  <br>  You won't ovulate till your HCG drops down below 5 again... and that is whenever it happens it happens. No way to perdict it short of OPK kits. So either chart with basal, cervical mucus and cervix positions or use OPK's. If you don't do either of those you really wont' know when you O'ed which can take 2 to 6 weeks after a D&C. You will know in hindsight if you know how long your luteal phase is. But aside from that nothing is going to tell you cause your body was thrown all out of wack with the D&C|`|e33QAXShaa	I don't know about aftera D&C but I m/c in Sept and it threw my cycles off by at least a week. We totally avoided each other the week+ I was supposed to be fertile at the end of October and I ended up pregnant again. Since the baby has been measuring a week ahead each time we're guessing I O'd a week or so early.
FLOjzbKEaa	yes you will.  my neighbor has only 1 fallopian tube and now has 2 beautiful kids.  so definitely you will get pregnant, keep trying.  Good luck|`|uuHPneEcaa	i am sure its possible, but the chances are probably harder to concieve. I wish u the best of luck.<br>  <br>  Pregnancy is possible with only one fallopian tube — as long as you have one or both ovaries, you still ovulate, and the remaining fallopian tube is healthy.|`|cen8SIssaa	well i honestly dont know your exact chances but i have heard that going untreated with chlamydia can cause damage to your reproductive organs. and if you only have one fallopian tube that might lower your chances as well.<br>  <br>  when you are ready to have children tell your doctor and they can help you get your body "baby ready" as best possible and also if that doesnt work, im sure they can try some other possibilities. <br>  <br>  so i dont think its going to be impossible for you, just maybe a little harder.<br>  <br>  Great luck to you!|`|ygGr1nX7aa	Yes, you only need one.  If one fallopian is no longer passable, it just means that you will only be fertile every other month.|`|0iUxfCMcaa	i had an eptopic and had to have my one tube removed. i got pregnant within three months after having the tube removed and am now 30wks :)|`|F8iyUqJBaa	You certainly can.  There are two tubes and two ovaries.  They take turns every other month dropping eggs.  If you have only one now then every other month you have that chance.|`|K8le7LRkaa	Yes you can get pregnant with one fallopian tube.  I don't know how the chlamydia would affect it though.|`|dR2bqUixaa	As long as you got that treated then you can have a baby. One fallopian tube is better than none. Good luck!|`|fQLeIAh1aa	my friends mom has 1 tube and 1 overie and conceived 5 kids.  she had no probs.|`|fTd509Qzaa	it only takes one.  The Dr. will have better odds for you
gkXLT9Z9aa	false positives are verrry rare. congrats mommy!<br>  <br>  the spotting is probably implantation bleeding or just spootting common to pregnancy.|`|qH1YcQ2kaa	it could be implantation bleeding<br>  unless you are bleeding a lot, i wouldn't worry about it<br>  some women even have light periods the first couple of months
XTuhGaL1aa	We as parents just want our kids to be normal and average so any comment with the words "so small, so big, so chubby, so this and so that" are going to irk us. I know that it sometimes bothers me when people comment on how tall and chubby my daugher is. She is 10 months old, 23 lbs and 30'' long so people are usually stunned when I tell them she is 10 months old. No two babies are alike and as long as you are feeding them and caring for them as best you can, don't even think twice about it!|`|b6EyFLgUaa	My daughter is ALWAYS told that shes so little and petite. Alot of people think that shes only 1- shes 2. Ive learned to take it as a compliment. Shes healthy and happy. Perfect size for her age and a great little eater. There is nothing I can or would do to make her bigger and that's the way it is. If people think shes littler it may because alot of kids are over fed these days ( most of the kids in my town are in the 90 percentile according to her doctor, I was shocked to learn she was in the 50 percentile). I live in a rather small town, 65 percent of our 2000 population is over the age of 65. SO there isnt a whole lot of little kids.|`|hl5WdXnbaa	I can understand you getting a bit defencive as a Mommy,  my youngest  son has always been tall and big for his age...not over weight but foot ball player big. I am not always sure if people mentioning his height mean it in a nice way or not. Most people are not trying to be rude, especially if they are commenting about their cute hair and  eyes. I believe what you feel is normal, but try not to stress over it.|`|387493774383e79967205158ff9bb074aa	I'd just be happy that my kids weren't Texas sized, lol.<br>  These people probably don't mean it in a bad way, I wouldn't let it bother me.<br>  Most people just make an observation without thinking that it may offend you.<br>  For example, I'm really pale, and people tell me that all the time.<br>  I don't take offense. People tend to blurt out silly things.<br>  If they thought it was offensive they probably wouldn't say it.|`|BKbEE9qZaa	I get the same thing and I agree it can be upsetting.

My daughter is extremely tall for her age (28 lb and 33 1/2 inches long, 15 months old) and she appears to be very skinny because of her height.  So some people feel its their business to comment on her size.........one lady even told me to feed her a pizza or something!  I was like wtf b*tch!  She also has very little hair so strangers 90% of the time think she is a boy!  I always get the "You should peirce her ears or put a head band on her".  Its so annoying but I just smile and think in my head what an idiot!|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	Well, just let it flow off your back. We had the opposite - a large, husky child, so we got all those related kind of comments! At three, my son looked like he was six - and THAT caused more problems than having a child looking younger.<br>  Just enjoy them, whatever size they are!|`|AkFag8tNaa	I feel ya. Even though my husband and I are both thin and were skinny kids, people still make a big deal out of the youngest one being so thin (does he eat, etc....) yeah, I don't like it either.|`|e8yt5PrGaa	It would irk me ..but the very best thing to do is to look them straight in the eye and say AND YOURE POINT IS ?|`|jIk2ttH1aa	I dont' think people mean it as an insult.<br>  I think it just means that they are cute and little and endearing to look at :).<br>  Especially if they add on more compliments about other features.<br>  <br>  <br>  I had the opposite issue, that I had to learn to deal with.  My cutie son is very tall.  When he was 2 people would talk to him like he was 4 and expect more from him.  Or they would say "oh he's so tall". I bet he'll play basketball, blah, blah.  And yes he is also a handsome little guy and people always remarked on that also.  He's gonna be a 'movie star'.  I just never felt comfortable with people saying what he was going to be....<br>  But I know it was more me that would get a little defensive than others meaning anything by it.<br>  <br>  Best wishes!|`|Q8wDjvZ1aa	just think of it this way, they will only be so  'little' for a short time, and most parents miss that stage so much. you will at least get it for a little longer than most. so you are lucky.     when people make comments i think it's normal for mothers to feel very protective of their children, so yo ucan simply say, well the doctor says they are healthy, and i get to enjoy my babies as babies for a little longer so i am very lucky'.|`|3WWHWsHOaa	I have a 10 year old who wears a size 5 and a 6 yr old who wears a size 3T. I have dealt with those exact same comments 1000's of times. I usually let it go but on a bad day I will comment back. It is truly irritating. As though any of chose how big our children are. I didnt wake up one day and say "I think I want to have the smallest 10 yr old in the school".|`|y6g0RnuAaa	No, I get annoyed too. Every freaking time we go to the grocery store we will be in the checkout line, minding our own business and someone just has to ask "how old is he?" I say "10.5 months" and this comment always follows "Wow, he's HUGE! He's gonna be a linebacker!" These stupid comments have been since he was about 4 months old. It IS annoying but I think they are just making conversation to paly with the baby.|`|VudhjHi2aa	I have to go with {{Ava's Mommy}} on this one. Anything with "SO: at the beginning or end tens to hurt just a bit.<br>  <br>  But really what does it matter. They don't know me or my child and as long as I know that My child is fine and I am doing my best then it is not worth my time to say anything back.<br>  <br>  I just smile and walk away.|`|z5EDtgtyaa	I would let it go. they aren't trying to be rude they are just taken by surprise  by their sizes and their ages. sometimes people forget that not everyone is the same.  my daughter doesn't look 31/2 she looks 2 and my god son doesn't look 4 he looks 6.|`|8oAlBL91aa	I understand how you feel. Everybody is always shocked when I say my son is 6 because he is just so tiny.|`|W8UZebRWaa	I think your being ok. My son has reddish blonde hair and EVERYONE says something about it. It gets annoying but I figure at least they are saying good things instead of bad things!|`|s8VgyzE2aa	Well honestly it is a bit rude for people to say those things, it's insensitive at the very least considering how do they know your child doesn't have some illness that makes them that way. Its just not appropriate for people to say things like that. <br>  <br>  I have gotten some comments like that in the past as my kids have always been petite as well, especially my twins. If someone said to me "they are 4? wow they look so small" I would say "yes they are actually 4, and thanks for your concern" and I would be giving a look to let them know they over stepped bounds.
z4glbCinaa	I have pcos and have been ttc for almost 4 years.  Clomid so far hasn't worked for me, I am about to start my 4th round in a few days,  My doctor says if it still doesn't work we will try something different.  I don't have hypothyroidism but is runs strongly in my family, my brother, aunt, uncle and grandma all have it.
7XPzv058aa	Ok.....<br>  A college class was told they had to write a short story in as few words as possible. The story had to contain the following themes.<br>  <br>  1.Religion<br>  2.Sexuality<br>  3.Mystery<br>  <br>  Below is the only A+ paper in the entire class.<br>  <br>  "Good God, Im pregnent! I wonder whose it is."|`|6wLkpi0raa	How about some good quotes:<br>  "Veni, Vidi, Velcro' - I came, I saw, I stuck around."<br>  "9 out of 10 doctors agree that 1 out of 10 doctors is an idiot."<br>  "666A, 666B - Tenants of the beast."<br>  "Above all else: Sky."<br>  "Forecast for tonight: Dark."<br>  <br>  You should check out the source for more funny stuff like that.|`|KZkUH7wQaa	about 10 years ago at our high school football homecoming game, I was walking in front of the whole class.  I started to walk down the stairs and missed a step.  I fell *thump thump thump thump thump* down every single stair to the bottom of the bleachers.  All while holding on to the hand bar...head and chin bobbing as I hit each step.  I thought maybe only a few caught it. I looked up and everyone was looking at me, lol.  Couldn't do anything but wave :)<br>  <br>  Or how about a joke...How do you get a tissue to dance?<br>  <br>  ...<br>  ...<br>  ...<br>  ..<br>  ...<br>  ...<br>  ...<br>  ...<br>  Put a little boogey in it :)<br>  <br>  Hope you feel better soon!|`|kCfOh2ZRaa	My (blonde) friend once said to me when i was talking about different games that were coming out;<br>  "I'm going to buy an xbox so i can play the wii fit."|`|klkt1LvSaa	Okay so one time I had a dream that I was a T-Rex and I had a big head and tiny arms and everytime I would walk I would  tip over and I couldn't get back up because of my little arms lol this is a ture story<br>  <br>  Okay another time I was walking into the grocery store with my mom and i was walking in the out door and i smacked me in the head and then i had a big bruse and it was all green and purple onmy head and the worst thing about it was that my crush was right in front of me comeing out the out door when i was walking in it and now him and his friends always pick onmy in school..DANGET!! lol that was a true story too :)|`|QP8LdPLeaa	well i was in the library one time and when you're on a computer, your sort like in this individual circle, like i have two people on each side of me, so i had to really be quiet. so i came on yahoo answers and i was reading this woman's embarrassing story. i read the lines that she stepped off a bus and fell into a ditch because she was drunk. i burst out laughing but then i had to hold it in because the library was so quiet. but that's what made it worse, when you know you're not suppose to make noise in a very silent environment, you can't help it.|`|Baxqbf4oaa	Lol I have two, both true.<br>  <br>  1. So, for lunch one day Me and two of my friends went to Tim Hortons (Coffee shop place in canada) And got hot chocolates. When we got back to school I still wasn't finished mine and my teacher didn't let me drink it in class, so I had to put it in my locker. After School I took it out and there was a roll up the rim thing on the cup, So my teacher and best friend were there and said "Roll it up!" so I was rolling it up and it said "please play again",so My teacher (trying to be funny) ripped the cup out of my hand, not realizing it was 3 quarters full and spillet it all over herself. Hahahahaha.<br>  <br>  2. Me and My best friend were looking for some necklaces in a store, and we saw some very up high and we couldn't reach them. She is alot shorter than me so we decided that I'll try to lift her up high to get it. So I held on to her and I was like "1...2....3....BLAST OFFF!!" and I like threw her up and as I was holding her saying that a lady that worked there came up to us and said "May I help you..?" it was so embarrasing! Hahahaha<br>  <br>  Feel better! :) Just think of the people in Africa who are starving!|`|LPhML0wpaa	:D sweet deal.<br>  WELL, one time me and my friend were in home ec (retarded) and we were about to write e HUGE *** test we didnt study for...so we decided to escape and well we decided to do 007 moves towards the door lol all doing summer salts(or w.e)... well we were almost to the door and we both turned around to to look at the teacher to make sure she wasn't looking and when we turned back my gym teacher was standing there giving us a look all O_O and me and my friend are all... err, LOOK AT HOW NICE THESE...TILES ARE! all pretending to look at the tiles and the gym teacher burst out laughing and we got caught and ended up having to do our tests in front of the office.<br>  <br>  ANOTHER is i walked into the washroom to see my friend washing her hands soo.. me being evil i start yelling HALEY YOU SICK FRICK! USE SOAP THATS NASTY! shes all I DID! and im all DONT YOU LIE! THATS SICK! UGHH! GROSS! so i did that every time someone new walked in and there all giving her disgusting looks hahaha. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  LAST ONE is there was this huge *** june bug on our campfire thing so my sister takes an axe and hits it square in the mid section and its guts went all over her leg and i swear she screamed bloody murder and started jumping up and down ahahaha|`|lFaYviUwaa	go 2 freewebs.com/eddwardthebooble - very silly but will make you laugh instantly!|`|vuEyUbsgaa	aaawww dont be depressed thats not good
zPYyGw8oaa	Spit up is usually within a few minuted of eating and is a creamy looking consistency just like the milk...no smell really no force.<br>  vomit is anytime and may have small white "flakes or chunks" with a clearish base...usually smells sour and may or may not have force.|`|o2YHnKXiaa	There is a huge difference between spit up and vomit.<br>  "Spitting up" or regurgitation is a normal occurrence in the first few months of life. As the stomach expands and the muscle that controls the opening into the stomach strengthens, your baby will spit up less. Spitting up is generally less than one-fourth of what the baby just ingested and drips down the front of the baby or you. Vomiting on the other hand is when the baby spits up more than half of the amount they just ate for several feedings in a row. Vomiting is also associated with more force so the vomitus is a distance from the baby and is referred to as projectile vomiting.
ZbnxGIsnaa	Woo hoo for AF.  Can't believe I'm cheering with you!  Haha.<br>  <br>  I am glad that she came for her visit and you'll have a new month to start from.  That is a good feeling.  Remember when I had that weird spotting thing for 2 months straight and SWORE I was pregnant and kept getting negatives?  I felt so helpless and was so relieved when I started my period!  You feel on top again!   Good luck to you and I bet we will be wishing you a congratulations this next month!  *huggles*|`|WBw9lDG8aa	that's good too hear yayyya|`|yp9rEMSraa	Im glad you got you AF..Clomid is another hope!!!

With my second, i was 108 and 5'1 and  people could tell when i had 5 months.|`|bGRexKPyaa	I'm was 5ft and 100 pounds pre-pregnancy and I had the flattest abs ever...<br>  <br>  I started showing at about 4 months..

pO0s0bhHaa	Rosalie is a pretty and very feminine name.  I like it.<br>  <br>  What would you use for a middle name?|`|QMAqzpKEaa	I really like that name. I have a friend called Rosalyn. That is nice too.But Rosalee combines Rosa ( Spanish/South American name ) and Lee so it's all the more unique. It sounds like a Rose and I like Roses. They are very pretty and romantic flowers.|`|2f6d591b87634e2c1909160eb45e94a1aa	old lady name ?<br>  <br>  All the more reason to use it!!  <br>  <br>  The last thing you want is to be one of the five billion "Heather/Kirsten/Krysal/Christii/Nikii" out there! <br>  <br>  Everyone will be envious that she has a unique name, but it will still be easy to spell.<br>  <br>  I LOVE old lady names. They are due for a comeback.|`|5vtVsqx6aa	I really like it and I've never seen or read Twilight.  Rosalie is really cute.<br>  <br>  Variations could be Rosalyn, Rosalind, Rosaline - those are all beautiful as well, in my opinion!|`|s2F6pK9Xaa	It's cute. I like Rosie a lot.|`|2pQUMKb2aa	i think it's cute|`|cErLq7f3aa	i love it|`|AA10463356	Rosalie is a classic name.  It comes and goes but never goes completely out of fashion.  Personally I like Rose the best.  It's simple and dignified but pretty.  Rose was Katharine Hepburn's name in The African Queen.  Humphrey Bogart called her Rosie.  It doesn't get better than that.|`|qTKSvULiaa	I think that Rosalie is a very unique name. i love it. i think uncommon names are better because then you have like 2 Aly's or something in the same class.|`|iAnJ8P3Uaa	I only like it if the nick name is Rose or Rosie...not the full name:)<br>  <br>  Plus, my oldest daughter and i saw the twilight movie together and loved it!! my other 4 are too young.|`|b4f7d3de97fe85e5b75ea87f6852017faa	I think it's too cutesy and precious. Rosalia and Rosa are nicer, in my opinion.<br>  <br>  It's definitely not bad, though.|`|R1NSqNi3aa	I think it's a lovely name and Rosie is really cute<br>  Good luck :)|`|8JgFKfpUaa	rosalie is pretty!!!<br>  :)<br>  it shows grace and beauty!!!<br>  plus it reminds me of roses!!!<br>  and im sure she will love it too!!!|`|uaHzhUeoaa	^_^ My vote........<br>  Rosie. Take a guess why.|`|h36gR2Fnaa	Love it. It a cute name. Not an old lady name. Go with it :]
yziXww8Kaa	My 3 year old has been sick for about 2 weeks now. She had a strep throat with the worst cough she's ever gotten. Today was her 3 year physical, and she doing a lil better. But yeah there is definitely something going around because almost all the toddlers/ infant I know are sick. I took my daughter to the ER last weekend because I was concerned about her cough/running nose developing into pneumonia, she had a fever of 104.3. But thank God everything turned out ok.|`|1JDpqlO1aa	My daughter has that little cold that is going around, she is 5.  We are just hoping the other 4 don't get it considering 3 are 8 months old (which is no fun at all, 3 sick infants) and the other immune system is on the fritz thanks to juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia.<br>  <br>  Of course Mommy doesn't want it because she is 6 months pregnant and daddy doesn't want it cause he has to take care of us!!!  :)|`|K1kZlWY8aa	My 2 year old daughter has a bit of a cough at the moment. I'm not sure if it's because of the bush fire smoke though...(we live in Victoria, Australia).|`|ybexjS2Paa	Me, both of them. Older son is getting better, but the daughter has just started coughing, sniffling, tearing no fever though. I'm also sick so you can imagine how great we all feel right now ;)|`|AA11212578	My two had stomach virus about 2-3 weeks ago and then a cold (cold wasn't that bad, though).<br>  <br>  My wife and I both have had stomach cramps the past 2-3 days and are not looking forward to the kids getting it....|`|xVEqBjDVaa	My 4 year olds had the sniffles, and my 18 year old had the flu the other day, i'm hoping they dont get it! Ah!|`|rqKRZOCVaa	I'm in the same boat!! fever around 103, vomiting and diarrea  I hate having a sick kid!|`|G0qeQOhoaa	My 12 month old is recovering from a bout with Croup. Not fun! And definitely scary! They hd to give him steriods|`|lGSUToFQaa	well my son has a cough and my daughter has strep throat so i sent her to my parents house and i'm hoping he doesn't get it too<br>  <br>  sorry to hear about your son, i hope he gets better soon|`|58b352907ba2def5e2248c3df2e55128aa	My son was sick all last week and half of this week. He had the flu and a double ear infection. He is over the flu now but still on antibiotics for the ear infection. I felt so bad for him because all he did was cry for a week. I hope your little man feels better soon.|`|FUOLr64jaa	Austin just got over the worst stomach bug!!  He vomited for 2 days straight and then had diarrhea for 3 more!  And then because of all the diarrhea he developed a horrible diaper rash.  He never had a fever though.  I hope little Jacob gets to feeling better!!|`|4iXL4C6paa	All 3 of my children are just getting over very high fevers and stomach viruses...and my baby boy is getting over bronchitis.....it is just that time of the season and when one gets it, they all get it.|`|J2glFOkhaa	My 4 year old had a 103 fever this weekend, and he's been very sick all week with a cough and stuffed nose. It is horrible. he is feeling a bit better now, so I hope that it's finally going away|`|kmQqbxpQaa	My son had a 103 fever this past weekend and since then has had diarrhea this past week!
nwuL7M7saa	Boo Radley. He was always interesting to me.|`|6EenztwDaa	Scout, Atticus or Boo<br>  but I would say Scout because I was alot like her when I was little<br>  and also Boo Radley is really interesting because in the book they dont know alot about him|`|vKEYa8aeaa	ive read that book probably 8 times, no lie haha. with how many times ive read it, it would be super easy for me to do a project on any of the characters. but i think i would pick boo radley since he was such a mystery until the end of the book. with boo, you get to focus not only on what is the TRUTH about his character, but also on all the things that people said and thought about him before he was even really introduced in the climax of the story.|`|6gtgiCS7aa	I don't remember who Bob Ewell was, but why not choose Atticus Finch or Tom Robinson? I think there are so many facets to Atticus: father, lawyer, neighbor/community memvber, role model ...|`|pcjOQDymaa	Bob Ewell.<br>  he's an interesting character or do<br>  Boo radley|`|nkZdtXXhaa	Do Boo Radley.|`|kRaVa0Wraa	SCOUT<br>  is soo cute and awesome. :)|`|LSkeAPBIaa	well what kind of project is it? id do mine on tom robinson. he symbolizes the title. he also symbolizes the cruelty /racism. in the book it says that mockingbirds are innocence and all they do is make beautiful music. they are good. "it is a sin to kill a mockingbird." tom robinson and his fate  is that mockingbird. you could do a lot of stuff on that if it is a paper.|`|XhirXRkpaa	I think you should do it on Scout, Atticus, or Boo.  They are definitely the three most interesting characters in the book.  If you need a lot of information, choose them in this order:  Scout, Atticus, Boo.  Scout develops the most as a character, and she is a part of all the major events.|`|ba7a9d89b85e1c8a26e92c2727576399aa	i would do more on scout or atticus.<br>  they are the 2 main characters.|`|IZtd0kBiaa	atticus or jem|`|9zwSclnLaa	Boo Radley (check my name).<br>  <br>  I always liked him cause he is so mysterious.|`|L3hVnjaFaa	Scout|`|H0sPCJQPaa	Do Boo Radley his name sounds cool<br>  <br>  or do whoever is easiest/|`|UIILEn0Uaa	I actually did my project on <br>  Dill!<br>  <br>  I loved Dill, because of the 'realationship' between him and Scout..<br>  and how he was very involved with the Boo Radley thing,<br>  I know hes not on ur list, but he was still fun to do a project on.|`|uWUln8fpaa	I don't like Bob Ewell. So I would personally pick Atticus. He is my favorite. (But then again Gregory Peck is one of my favorites.) To Kill a Mockingbird is one of my all time favorite books and movies.
wRHhpanmaa	why not all three? It is not uncommon for a child to have 2 middle names. My son is Matthew (after my dearest friend who passed away) Alexander (after my husband) and Nikolai (my sister and I picked boy names when we were small, she picked Malakai and I promised I would have Nikolai)<br>  <br>  My daughter is Margie (after her great grandmother on her father's side) Sarah (my husband always wanted his daughter to be named sarah) Makaylyn (we found it together and thought it would make a great middle name)<br>  <br>  My sister in law is Lucy (after her aunt on her dad's side) Candace (after her grandmother) Marie (after her moms middle name)<br>  <br>  so why not just name her Kara Elaine Alexandra ______<br>  <br>  it is cute and feminine and will mean so much more.|`|qj6pv3fUaa	You could always give your daughter two middle names and use all of the names. Elaina is gorgeous if it's pronounced how I think it is (Elaine-ah). Kara and Elaina would be my tops for first names.<br>  <br>  Kara Elaina Alexandra<br>  Elaina Kara Alexandra<br>  <br>  I think the top one sounds and flows better. Neat idea with the initials. If my fiance and I did that, we'd get Doco or Codo! I'm sure the kid would love us!|`|Az4uH0H2aa	I don't know... these are all really great names. I personally love the name Alexandra, I was thinking of naming my daughter that. Kara is ah-dorable, and I love how you put your initials together. How about Kara Alexandra? So cute...|`|8MHBFCM6aa	Kara Alexandra sounds really cute. If you're not opposed to giving 2 middle names, you could name her Kara Alexandra Elaina. I like when people give their children names that have special significance.  Congratulations!|`|Pa2WNH4vaa	well i like alezandra,because it's a really cute name and you can call her like alex or alexis there all cute but i like this one the best|`|fQVM8OHmaa	I would choose Kara or Elaina because they are both beautiful names and they are unique.  Good luck and congratts:)|`|gWufVQfSaa	i like Elaina. <br>  i like the nickname Lainey for it too.<br>  :D|`|Zzg0vd0Jaa	Elaina, I have always loved the name Elaine and I think adding that A at the end is a cute twist!|`|AW0072SFaa	i think kara is the best. its a cute name and has a Very significant meaning behind it|`|AA11251510	elaina its pretty|`|BqCtKeA2aa	Kara sounds cute but id choose Alexandra. Ive always liked that name.|`|Lo5yiBqzaa	Kara Elaine sounds good.|`|upVQxbmwaa	i like all of them.<br>  but i like Elaina the best.|`|eDmdkUO3aa	Elaina, because I like this name best.|`|dd8cb229ee241de8ca385f84ec4b33d7aa	Kara is cool, how it's both your intials<br>  <br>  I would do that or one of these<br>  <br>  Alexandera Eliane or Eliana Alexis|`|4S6V4sb4aa	Kara-  It's Irish meaning Sweet Melody.. i think that would make a great name for your little girl..|`|z2SODuR9aa	Alexandra Elaina i think goes perfect together!..it'll have something meaningful from both yours and your husbands loved ones!|`|04F4149yaa	2 is so common. 1 or 3. But I just LOVE number 3.<br>  <br>  ELAINA.|`|50c6a30e3a0dd958fb1a8658f3199941aa	I would chose the third, but I would spell it Elena.|`|zxnvdSS3aa	Alexandria|`|F7tyzrMzaa	I absolutely adore the name Kara. And I think that has the best meaning behind it as you are combining something from you and your husband, whereas the other names are either from your side of the family or your husbands.|`|bMvAmMTaaa	i like the name Elaina, it's always nice to have the grandparents name in there somewhere. my partners grandma's name is Ann, so we gave our daughter Ann as a middle name, she was so happy :-)|`|mbfXOPRXaa	I like Elaine and Elaina.  Kara is also cute.

PCK5bJt3aa	I answered a local ad on craigslist, we met in a public place and our girls got along great.

58f00eb827abff12eac8ed561f2ced1aaa	well, first of all, congrats!!! You can take any over the counter pernatal vitamin. Buy a big bottle at walmart. I also take calcium since I dont drink milk., Make sure it has plenty of folic acid. You will need to make an appointment to see a doctor to confirm your pregnancy with a blood test. Early care is VERY important, so dont delay! And yes, you can have all of the sex you want. Your baby is protected in your uterus, inside a yolk sac, which acts as a cushion. As long as you dont have any pain during sex, you're fine. Good luck to you!|`|AA12275027	you need to ask the doctor about the nasal spray, for now you must stop using it until you get the clear.  materna is a good prenatal vitamin.  yes those are all pregnancy symptoms.  it's fine to have sex|`|fAGTOJRZaa	I buy a generic brand of over the counter vitamins from Walmart. I also supplement them with Expecta DHA supplements. I'm not sure about nasal sprays but I know you can take benadryl when you're pregnant for allergies.<br>  <br>  If you google a due date calculator you will find something that will help you figure out your due date.<br>  <br>  One piece of advice: sign up on whattoexpect.com. They have monthly message boards and you will have TONS of women in the same stage of pregnancy as you who are more than willing to answer any questions.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|duinadV4aa	yes those are all pregnancy symptoms start taking prenatal vitamins my doc gave me mine i would make a appt soon as possible also you can get them from wal-mart to|`|VmqOq8Qjaa	Yes, prenatals, claritin is ok, about 5-6 weeks.|`|nISYAHkfaa	Sex is fine during pregnancy, unless you have a high-risk pregnancy (seeing a doctor will help determine this). Yes, they're all symptoms of pregnancy. Just pick up a prenatal vitamin--that's what it'll be called on the package. Ask your doctor which medicines are okay to take, some doctors are more cautious than others. Finally, no, I don't know how far along you could be . .  but if you go to a doctor and have a blood test done, the hormone levels will give you a good idea. =) Also, having an ultrasound can help tell you how far along you are as well.<br>  <br>  You need to see a doctor soon, so don't delay, make an appointment ASAP!|`|hcVsGFbraa	These are all pregnancy symptoms.  Don't know how many weeks prob. about4-6.  Don't use the nasal allergy spray.  You should go to the doctor for vitamins and they will give you a list of medication you're allowed to take.  Yes you can have sex when you're pregnant as much or as little as you want.|`|AA11977483	Theses are all normal pregnancy symptoms,you should be taking folic acid everyday,not sure about vitamins or sprays, maybe check that out with the doctor, i would think you are about 5 weeks pregnant.All the best.x And sex is fine unless you have any bleeding,|`|CyWJ6O31aa	Pick up an over the counter prenatal with lots of folic acid.  You can take benadryl or claritin according to my doctor, but check with yours before you take anything.  According to a due date calculator you are 5 weeks pregnant.|`|XBy7am73aa	Hi you are prob only few weeks pregnant. You need to take folic acid, but more importantly see your doc. sex is fine however much|`|O5KOwhovaa	Go see a doctor.<br>  <br>  <br>  No one can diagnose you over Yahoo Answers.|`|7rIAd6gGaa	First off, congratulations. The symptoms you are describing are pregnancy symptoms. And if you got a positive test, you definitely are pregnant. You can only get a positive if hcg is present in your urine, and that's only produced during pregnancy.<br>  <br>  As for the vitamins, you can take any over-the-counter prenatal vitamin. You just want to make sure they have at least 100% folic acid (also sometimes called folate). I get mine at GNC. They have all the vitamins and minerals I need, and they're not too expensive. But you can find them at just about any supermarket, Walmart, pharmacy, etc.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't use the nasal spray. My doctors have always told me the only thing you can take during pregnancy is tylenol. You could always ask your doctor though. You should call them soon anyway to schedule your first visit. <br>  <br>  If your last period was at the end of January, you are probably about 5 weeks pregnant. When you go to the doctor, they will be able to tell you though.<br>  <br>  Congrats again, and good luck!!|`|taQFWXuHaa	well, you need prenatal vitamins now and well yes those are some signs of pregnancy... well not all of them but some of those are like frequent urination, tender breasts, feeling sick as in nauseated. As for the anti Allergy  nasal spray... as your doctor bc certain meds are very harmful to the fetus. and well honestly only your doctor can tell you how many weeks you are but im guessing around 5 weeks and counting. <br>  And as for the sex, as long as your not in pain and your doctor does not ban you from it you are fine. Have all the sex you want and i have heard that the fetus can benefit from the mothers orgasms. I guess when you orgasm your body releases some kind of hormone that helps the baby but dont quote me on that im no doctor just check out some websites parents.com is a great and babycenter.com is too. GOOD  LUCK!!!|`|uNzFexpRaa	If you had a positive pregnancy test then the likelihood is that yes you are pregnant - u will need to start taking Folic Acid to help prevent against Spinabifida. If you go to your GP they will most likely prescribe this to you but i found going to a pharmacy or even a supermarket is the cheaper option - they are exactly the same as what the dr prescribes but you dont pay the prescription prices...if that makes sense? <br>  <br>  Im sure in a normal healthy pregnancy sex is fine, ive read it a million times that its ok, im a high risk pregnancy and been advised against it (dammit!!!) <br>  <br>  As for how many weeks you are you can sign up to a lot of pregnancy websites like www.babycentre.co.uk (my favourite) and enter the first day of your last period information in and it will calculate how far gone they estimate you are and an estimated date of delivery (EDD) HOWEVER!!! Dont take these as bang on gospal - From my last period i should be clocking on nearly 12 weeks pregnant but my dating scan last week showed i was only 9 +2 (now 10 +3) they sonographer works this by measuring the babies crown to rump length (in mm) and that gives a more accurate time! <br>  <br>  Hope this has helped at all|`|teVScZERaa	umm okay yeah you definitely sound pregnant.  and you need to go to a doctor, not ask people online.  if you dont have insurance and thats why you havent gone, you need to go to your local health department and get an official test, then they will tell you everything you need to do.  you can get on the medical card through them which will cover pretty much everything throughout your pregnancy.  you need to see a doctor as soon as possible though.  you need to be put on prenatal vitamins which the doctor can probably prescribe for next to nothing.  mine are $4 at walmart.<br>  <br>  YOU NEED TO SEE A DOCTOR, ASAP.|`|QbiOa0YQaa	here's what i came up with<br>  Your baby will be born on or around Thursday, November 5, 2009.<br>  <br>  You are about 5 weeks pregnant.

mw7UGMGjaa	3 days of working out is for maintaining your current look.  Work out 5-6 days a week.  You need to add some cardio. in there.  Muscle tone will never show if there is fat on top of it, even if you are skinny.  You can not localize muscle tone, make sure everything is even and at a good pace.  If you bulk up to quick you could get stretch marks, or more serious issues.  Eat a good diet.  I know you are young and your metabolism is prob. great.

x3EPqezJaa	Yes, sort of. Ants are designed to regurgitate some of what they've eaten in order to feed it to other ants who do not leave the hive. So they throw up every time they return to the hive. Also, they carry food back for others. But on the other hand, ants don't ever eat "too much." They know when to stop eating.<br>  <br>  That's a really great question! The true mark of an intelligent mind is knowing what questions to ask.|`|ETsUQa0kaa	I have no clue about the answer! But here's a couple funny things my 2 year old says...<br>  <br>  Ok, so he has older cousins that play school with him and one day I went downstairs into his playroom and found him on a big stool saying "Today's activity is going to be arts". <br>  <br>  Also, his older cousin has an iPod that has the app "Atomic Fart". One day he asked her "Hey, Anna. Can I do farts?". He loves iPods.<br>  <br>  Ok, LOL this one is funny. He loves playing house so he asked his cousins and aunt to play it with him. His cousins were the mommy & daddy and his aunt was the grandma. A little while after that we went to the mall and his aunt went walking a little ahead of him. A couple minutes later his realized it and was running down the aisles of the mall screaming "Granny! Granny! Wait Up, Granny! Granny! Granny!" to his aunt.<br>  <br>  Lastly, once he was going to the bathroom in a little potty seat and asked "Hey, Mama. Can I go in the closet?".|`|Az4uH0H2aa	Lmao! Tell your son that my friend who runs a nature camp and knows a LOT about bugs can't even answer this one. My guess is that no, ants can't really get sick so they probably can't throw up. But they can poop..... The other day my 4-year-old daughter and I went to the ATM at the bank. We pulled up next to it and she shouted "I want a cheesburger please!" Haha kids can be soo funny.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	no ants dont puke they have different digestive tracts
Jucak0HLaa	It might be,I went through the same thing my 8th grade year.Ask your mom to bring you to your doctor,and see what he/she thinks.Most likely,they will recommend someone for you to see that can help you the most.It's hard to deal with,I know,and you don't deserve it.|`|TaFrxxJXaa	besides the problem with the two guys, you sound just like me. I'm in highschool though and about to turn 15...<br>  I feel just like that all the time :(|`|CsIwiZRoaa	yeah you probably are a little bit. if you can afford it i would suggest therapy. i mean you obviously dont need it but it does help, trust me. i can relate to you so well. i was you in middle school but it does get better. im in high school now and happier than ever. the boys probably wont pay attention to you cuz usually high school is bigger than middle school. hcances are you wont see them. stop worrying. think about the things that make you happy and focus on that. pray and ask god to help you. become close with your mom or dad too because they love you
AZRj3vaLaa	you cant realy ever recover from pcos.<br>  i took provera to jump start my period, af came,and then i started clomid to ovulate. but you cant take that medicine forever.<br>  the only way that people recover from pcos is losing weight.<br>  but there are alot of people who are already thin that have pcos.<br>  i was just recently diagnosed with pcos after not being able to concieve<br>  for about 14 months.<br>  <br>  i have accepted it and i will not let it define me!

I know it sux, I do the same thing (and this is part of why I didn't get pregnant for years!)  <br>  <br>  How many days is your cycle? (NOT YOUR PERIOD!!!......From the first day of your period to the first day of your NEXT period).  I am asking to make sure you are figuring your days right.

7c9a6ac2b60c434d81159b0728373573aa	We used a ast flow silicone nipple. I used the drop-ins for a while too and found that once I started to thicken the bottles my son didn't like the fatter nipple. What I did was buy the fast flow and shove the nipple brush part of the bottle brush through the nipple to enlarge the hole. I also found that if you mix the bottle with out the cereal first then add the cereal 1tsp at a time and mix after each tsp you add it's less chunky. Makes a longer process but it worked for me.  Good luck and hope he gets better. My son grew out of it at just over a year. We had a GI specialist and different meds and 3 different formulas.

DN6XtoViaa	when your pregnant your uterus will keep streaching to acomidate the baby.. this causes cramping. <br>  <br>  it could really go either way for you at this point.. as cramping is a good indication of both.<br>  <br>  hope you are though! good luck|`|A0tWlG94aa	i'm not too sure...because a couple of days ago i had the same sort of cramping too but mine ended up as my period....<br>  <br>  but good luck anyways... everyone is different<br>  xx
3zZ6nyuRaa	yes i did. what happens is that all of your glands in your body are on overdrive and producing more of....well, everything. I constantly had a stuffy nose and cold like symptoms because of this. And since you cannot take any meds, I found that the only thing that helped was a cold-air humidifier.|`|zNSDHpV6aa	i do and iam 17 weeks today and i still have it today|`|AA12192295	yep. My nose will either be all stuffed up or supper runny. Now at 12 weeks, I'm starting to get nose bleeds as well. The sinus head aches are the worst. Try getting a humidifier.|`|QeALCWbqaa	yes
BzCYQlcuaa	yes i new!!! i was really sleepy. i remember sitting on the couch and i was like how come i feel like crap,i just felt different and sick. i was not actually puking but i was had nausea. so i took a test and it was negative! i was like guess i have the flew. then i went for test at the doctor and it was negative. i went back 2 weeks later and was like listen I AM PREGNANT! i don't care what your test says! and sure enough they <br>  re tested and i was pregnant! so they did a ultra sound right there and i was 6 weeks!!!!! so yes you will know! well i did. i just new!|`|H2IhRXIIaa	Little bumps around my nipples..they got bigger.|`|uJJPFJoyaa	I felt very sick, I had really bad nausea, headaches and constipation for about 2 weeks until I went to my doctor, that's when I found out I was 8wks (at that time).|`|uTEr67Bhaa	I was extremely moody.

nIFV6kSOaa	depends on the state some have limits like Oregon who says only 8 children can live in the same household counting bio, step, foster and adopted.|`|ETcBRko3aa	Hahahaha.....many people foster for money, that is a true fact. <br>  <br>  Figure you are licensed for 4 children at $400 a piece (and more if they have special needs), you are talking about $1600 a month.  It does not sound like a lot if you have four children, BUT BUT BUT, they don't spend the money on the children.  They spend it on themselves, so $1600 is alot.<br>  <br>  I was ALWAYS in homes that had more than 1 child.  One place I stayed had 5 foster kids.  At that home, I ran around in sneakers that were falling apart and were taped together.  The money was not spent on my needs.<br>  <br>  Also, remember once a child is placed, sometimes the workers are "gone" for months at a time.  The object is to place the kid...not find "the best placement" for the child's needs.  It's all about numbers.<br>  <br>  The statisics show that most people who foster children are lower middle or lower class families.  They are already struggling with monetary issues.....<br>  <br>  Foster kids come with free medical care (Medicaid), free school breakfast and lunch.....and they are worth $300-$900 a piece.<br>  <br>  Of course this also depends where you live, but don't be fooled into thinking that alot of people don't see this as $$ in their pocket.|`|XyU6oEVPaa	<a href="http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/socwork/nrcfcpp/downloads/foster-care-maintenance-payments.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/socwork/nrcfc...</a><br>  <br>  Some states pay significantly more for foster children than yours.  Yes, there are many people who do foster care for income, and they are not going hungry.|`|AA12127693	When you have your homestudy done - it will be then that you will find out how many children you are licensed for.  Depending on the # of bedrooms / sizes will depend on how many children "can" be placed with you.  We were licensed for 3 children - but never took more than two at a time (our first placement).  Our stipend for foster care was about 1/2 of what yours is - so I don't know how people do it for the money either.|`|MzHwklzKaa	My brother just bought a house that had been remodeled in a strange manner.  It was all chopped up and had weirdly shaped, tiny rooms.  He talked to the neighbors and found out the previous owner was a foster mother.  She had done the interior like that so she could pack more kids into the house. She slept in the living room so she could have another check-OH WAIT, I mean foster kid.<br>  <br>  Where did she get the money to remodel?<br>  You guessed it, the foster care stipend!<br>  <br>  Shoes?<br>  Clothes?<br>  School supplies?<br>  Don't be silly!<br>  <br>  The neighbors had plenty of things to say about that woman, and none of it nice.  It got so bad, they all pitched in and helped the kids themselves.  They said the social workers couldn't be reached half the time, and when they did reach them, they were told flat out that there was no where else for the kids to go.  That short of abuse, those kids had a roof and meals, and should consider themselves lucky!

If you insist on shoes, then go to a reputable brand recommended by the American Podiatric Medical Association and include the receipt just in case they don't fit.

vcRm8ps8aa	yes, that means you would have had sex around the 14 day mark. However long your periods are (unless they are irregular) people still ovulate on day 14. This is correct, aslong as all is well. Some women don't ovulate until day 21 or even later because of fertility problems. So it is unlikely they will concieve, as they have put all thier efforts into day 14 and they think it is pointless trying later on in thier cycle. This is why people should have sex every other day from the day they come off thier period. But if you had sex when you were ovulating then there is a really good chance. The statistics say that on a perfect cycle with correctly timed intercourse there is only a 25% chance. But i think the success rates for perfectly timed intercourse are higher, hence why so many babies are in the world!<br>  <br>  Everywhere you look these days there is a pram pusher.|`|oqUlYXqtaa	there's a good chance you timed intercourse well, the only way to say 100% is through ovulation kits to make sure you truly ovulated, but it sound like you did, good luck!<br>  you can also ask doctors online for free, try fertilityties.com<br>  good luck!|`|u2enNfTJaa	You've timed intercourse well with probable ovulation so fingers crossed that it will work! Don't get your hopes too high though as there are no guarantees. Good luck!
ki3XY49daa	1) I always had my bags packed by 36 wks and kept in the trunk of the car.  I wanted to make sure my dumbass husband wouldn't forget it when we left for the hospital.<br>  <br>  2) It depends on how good the technician is.  It mostly depends on your baby's position in utero.  If the baby is facing your spine, you won't see the baby's face.  You might get lucky tho. :)<br>  <br>  3) You deal with it the best you can.  It's all about pecking order.  The fact is that the newborn will require much less attention in the first couple of months, so it won't be too bad.  Once the newborn is more alert, you just juggle with which child needs something more.  It will be a little overwhelming at first, but those instincts take over and you'll see how awesome a multi-tasker you really are!!<br>  <br>  4) One of my labors was drug free and epidural free.  I didn't have time to get drugs.  I started labor and delivered in less than two hours.  Without drugs, it's like time stops and the pain doesn't.  But, it's faster usually because the drugs can alter the contractions, thus prolonging labor.  If you choose to go drug free, prepare yourself, because it is quite painful.<br>  <br>  I am finally getting my juice back.  I'm in my 14th week with my 5th child.

I would say if you go all the way to your 40th week or even be induced, that's better, so you'll know when to pack. I'm going to say pack a FEW things around your 38th week.<br>  <br>  2.) Yes, there should be, it's not going to be perfect in black and white but you will see a good outline if she's not hiding.<br>  <br>  3.) I have a two year old girl and having a newborn baby boy in June and it helps to have alot of help from your family, it helps that your two year old is very good baby and understand his sister is coming and he'll probably even want to help like my little girl, she loves kids. So just take it easy and it's going to be hard not get to frusterated. <br>  <br>  4.)

3I3Thz6waa	Oh honey, don't give up hope! I know exactly how you feel though, and I was once in your place. I've had irregular periods my whole life, they would come so sporadically, like every 3 months or so, then would come regular for two months then stop, then come again three months later (so you can imagine how impossible it was to track my ovulation)... I grew up convincing myself that I was not going to be able to have children because of this. I went to gynecologists when I was younger, but they all just said that my period would eventually adjust itself and didn't give me much thought until I got married and mentioned that I was trying to conceive for 6 months. The doctor saw that I was a little over weight, that I had irregular periods and had a zit on my face and then just assumed I had PCOS. I had no idea what this was, and it sounded scary. So the doctor ordered a pelvic ultrasound and blood work. My blood work came back normal, and my pelvic ultrasound showed that I had two bumps on each ovary. At that point I thought my childhood nightmare was finally coming true.<br>  <br>     The doctor told me that I would need help getting pregnant and referred me to a fertility doctor. I still have the referral slip in my wallet as a reminder....I found out I was pregnant a week after I was told to go to the fertility doctor. I'm telling you this to let you know that it can happen, and it does happen, and hopefully it will happen to you. You CAN get pregnant. My best friend was also diagnosed with PCOS and she was able to get pregnant after 9 months of trying. It is not impossible. Now, it might take a little longer because we ovulate differently and such. I never monitored my ovulation because I never really could, it was WAY too irregular. But my friend bought the clear blue ovulation monitor and used it the whole 9 months, and she said it just helped her get a better understanding of her body and the signs it sends out when she's ovulating. She also took her temperature everyday, she was hard core! <br>  <br>  To answer your questions directly, you can get rid of the cysts with diet and exercise. If you're overweight, losing weight will completely get rid of PCOS in some women. So maybe try that? My doctor was going to put me on a carb-free diet (which helps with the regulation of our insulin levels since PCOS causes waked out blood sugar levels and makes us retain weight easily, so basically, carbs are our enemy!). but even if you still have the cysts they will NOT stop you from ovulating!   <br>  <br>  The best of luck with everything. I hope I've helped a little. I know how upsetting it is to find out you have something you think would prevent you from having children. Maybe you can consult with a fertility doctor to further ease your mind. What I was going to do (if I luckily hadn't gotten pregnant) was do the carb-free diet for about six months and see where I was from there. If my condition wasn't getting any better then I was going to go to a fertility doctor and maybe inquire about metformin (regulates blood sugar levels) or even clomid (which makes you ovulate). it's up to you for which path you want to take. <br>  <br>  Good luck!!|`|acj9mB9Paa	Do you know how to track your fertility symptoms?  Even if you do not ovulate often (which can happen with pcos) you can still figure out when you DO ovulate!  There is a book called "Taking Charge of Your Fertility" by Toni Weschler that you should read.  It teaches you exactly how to track your fertility to have the BEST chance at conceiving.  It took me eight years to have my first, and after reading this book, three months for my second!  Good luck!|`|cJRFbZUaaa	Check out the website below.  It's for a research centre in Vancouver that focuses on PCOS issues.  The director calls PCOS "anovulatory androgen excess" because she believes the problem is the hormonal imbalance that causes the cysts, not the cysts themselves.  Hope this helps.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cemcor.ubc.ca/taxonomy/term/17" rel="nofollow">http://www.cemcor.ubc.ca/taxonomy/term/1...</a>
v0z5Nyypaa	Don't lose hope!  Try taking the test again in a few days.  If your HCG levels aren't high enough, the tests won't pick up on it.  I know it's difficult to wait, but it might still be a little early.  I had to wait until 5 days after my missed period for the test to come out positive.  By the way-children are a gift from God, so don't give up.  Good luck!|`|FqOewVGcaa	keep your faith you will be pregnant soon.|`|H0fXySX9aa	it could be to early or you ovulated later with my second i got a positive a week after my period was due i got told i ovulated later|`|d1APITmkaa	Just wait. my girlfriend was pregnant for 7 weeks and we didn't now because she had her period 4 weeks in. just wait a few more weeks and test yourself again.|`|pqzKlNudaa	It can be is too early or you are not pregnant u have to wait and see if u get ur period on March 3 and if u dont then take the test again.|`|hCpqhn27aa	Stop making babies.

xR3IOC3Raa	It'd be better with more information, but the odds are the baby will have brown hair and eyes like you.  <br>  <br>  There is also a strong chance of it having hazel eyes.  Most babies are born with blue eyes, but they change as the babies grow, and blue is the recsessive trait for eyes, so there is a very small chance your baby will have blue eyes when it is older, but the red hair is still a slight possibility.|`|X6as2nOAaa	I kind of think the baby might have red hair because I see that a lot but im not positive so don't quote me on it. I think the baby will have brown eyes though this is just a guess.|`|hitgP4Hoaa	well my mother is brown with blue eyes dad: Brown with Blue eyes<br>  Me: red hair blue eyes<br>  My Bfs dad: brown with green eyes Mother: Brown Blue eyes<br>  My Bfs: Brown with green eyes<br>  AND my lil man Fab mad curly brown hair and blue eyes lol<br>  <br>  Best of look with everything hun.|`|7XBoIgd6aa	Blue eyes are a dominant trait red hair is not so brown or black hair with blue eyes...most likely
q9k2zEAUaa	That would be SO awesome! You have one big imagination. :D<br>  Hmm.<br>  If I were to "start all over":<br>  I'd make friends with better friends.<br>  I'd go to a more suitable and better school (you did say if I had the money).<br>  I'd learn more about badminton, soccer, and ALL the other sports.<br>  I'd learn more about the guitar, piano, the drums and ALL the other instruments.<br>  I'd study more and pay attention in school.<br>  I'd act mature even if I was young. But, of course still have fun.<br>  And<br>  I'd do everything to focus more in school than in boyfriends and stuff.|`|uZTLlAH9aa	If I could start all over, I'd go back to 7th grade and bring my grades up.

So, I just closed up and didn't talk to anyone and I ended up losing some of the best years and oppurtunities.  I'm better now and soo much happier, but it's disappointing that I wasted all that time. I would be open to making friends with everyone, playing all the sports I can, and go to a different middle school, but I would pretty much do everything the same.

c490676d02a8b133e7a6143969ba0116aa	It's not that high! FSH can really fluctuate from month to month and it can drop. When mine was first tested it was 12. Three months later it was 14. I freaked out! Believe it or not, I did an IVF cycle that month and got some pretty good eggs. I was successful at lowering my FSH by taking wheat grass shots. My FSH dropped to 8 after taking wheat grass for 3 months. I was also doing acupuncture and daily gentle exercise. I do know many other woman who lowered their FSH by taking the wheat grass. If you can choke it down go for it!<br>  <br>  With that Estradiol number I would guess it is a cyst that could be active. I have had several that have gone away without BCP's or aspiration. I'm sure yours will too. I never had them before starting fertility treatments.<br>  <br>  As for your cycles becoming shorter, mine were all over the map after failed cycles. I used to get AF on CD28 and ovulated on CD14 like clockwork. Not anymore!<br>  <br>  Put your feet up and take a deep breath! Much luck!|`|2f6diQBiaa	Your numbers sound good, so try not to freak out. These numbers don't seem to indicate PCOS, and a 7 is still considered good egg reserves. I don't think you are losing your fertility. You may have a cyst, especially given your Estradiol and the fact that you've had them before, and this may be affecting your numbers. <br>  <br>  It sounds like Clomid may be hyperstimulating your ovaries and that's why you are getting these cysts. You may want to consider a different medication, like Femara.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!!
8kaDm2D8aa	UMM, YEAH.  i brought a back pack.  i packed a nightgown, which i didn't use.  slippers, a phone charger, baby clothes, shampoo, conditoner, soap, nursing bra, giant pads, granny panties, hair scrunchie.  thats bout it.|`|2ZoUduoPaa	I had a larger duffle bag, toiletry train case, babies larger diaper bag, and an extra tote bag and all were packed to the gills.  I wish I had packed more.  I went in expecting a perfectly normal vaginal delivery and ended up having a c-section.  I was a day short on clothes for me and hubby.  I'm very thankful I always pack extra undies anytime I'm away from home over night.<br>  I don't think you've packed too much.  Just make sure you have all the basics, and maybe on extra "jammies".  I wish I had packed an extra comfy gown to sleep in.  <br>  <br>  Good luck to you.  How much longer?|`|K1kZlWY8aa	Well, I have the list somewhere...ok, I'll tell you all I packed, lol. <br>  I had a duffel bag, with:<br>  -Three changes of clothes<br>  -Socks<br>  -Nightgowns<br>  -Dressing Gown<br>  -Lip balm<br>  -Toiletries<br>  -Ipod<br>  -Bras, pads, etc.<br>  -Baby clothes, nappies, etc.<br>  <br>  My fiance also brought some things. I ended up being in labour for 23 hours, and stayed in hospital for three days, so I had just enough things and my fiance brought me one more change of clothes for when I went home. <br>  I don't think it matters how BIG the suitcase is, it's what is IN it. Make sure you are not overpacked, but at the same time have enough.

05qXrY4iaa	Hi there, <br>  <br>  I had same problem with my oldest girl, she was formula feed from about 2 1/2 months and around 3 months she started throwing too much after and in between feeds. I took her to the doctor and he told us to keep her inclined after a feed and sleeping with a pillow. Also took off the formula and send her an special one easier to digest. we never had to give her any sort of medication and she was fine by the time she was a year old. <br>  <br>  I would suggest speak with your doctor and try some positions to help her. Always remember that you are doing your best to help your little one and that she will get better!<br>  <br>  Good luck,|`|be8b9be707d55fa32115a4088d3ac4c3aa	Have you tried putting cereal in her milk or leaving her upright for 30 min after every feeding. This is what I was told to do by my sons doctor. He was diagnosed at 4weeks with reflux and he is 7weeks now. He has been so much better since a started doing this. YOu can also elevate her crib so she is never laying flat. This helps reflux with out medicine. I hope she gets some relief soon. Good luck.
4Qb1FNH2aa	Breastfeeding is best as it helps mother and baby bond, it also provides all the nutrients a child requires as well as getting them ready for the type of food the mother east in some case, spices, for example, obviously in very small amounts. <br>  <br>  (I swear, that sort of thing really travels the body! Some babies whose mothers eat a lot of spices are born with a slight spicy smell, for example). <br>  <br>  Breast milk also provides a whole host of immune system boosters such as natural anti-oxidents. It can help reduce the risks of diabetes, obesity, cancer and some childhood illnesses/syndromes that I can't remember at the moment.<br>  <br>  Formula does not hurt, though, it is just not as good. It is like something prepared by a chef compared to something a so-so cook made at home, yes, they are both food, but...|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	"Breast is best" but formula isn't a bad option if breastfeeding can't happen for whatever reason. As long as the baby gets fed, it doesn't really matter at the end of the day.|`|895XRbnJaa	doctors and pediatricians recommend breastfeeding because it is natural, baby most likely wont be obese, the baby wont get sick as often, the baby can digest it easier... and the list can go on and on just google "why is breastfeeding better?"|`|1MEnCmwoaa	Breastfeeding is the most natural healthy thing for baby. It builds immunities and they get all the nutrition naturally from the mom plus they get the extra bonding with the parent.<br>  Formula is ok though, some babies have health issues and are unable to breastfeed. My daughter was not able to, i pumped for a while though.<br>  Also, breastfeeding is not for everyone, some women don't like it or can't get a good supply because of whatever reason. It is hard for women who work full time. <br>  but the breast is definitely better.|`|lJ5Ao2aIaa	Breast feeding is the best cause it improves baby's immunity. Otherwise if you don't have that option, formula is also great nutrition-wise !

If your periods aren't regular there is a reason why and you should know that reason.  If your health or activities are such that you aren't regular there is a reason.

It does sound like preemclampsia.  I would say don't worry until they say worry.  You are far enough along that the only thing they would do at this point is induce you for labor or ask you to go on bedrest.  At this point in your pregnancy if they induce you, (if you were like me) this probably won't hurt your feeling too bad.  Once you have the baby all of these symptoms will disappear.  Best wishes!

Everyone needs it repeating and takes ten minutes to right it down.  I don't really understand why you have hyphenated her first name unless you are going to say it every time you speak to her and I would find that rather cumbersome too.

FoY5fgVwaa	That is odd that you just started nursing your 6 week old...did she start off on the bottle and now you are deciding to breastfeed?  In any case, it's a great decision to breastfeed! A nipple shield can be purchased at your local Walmart or given for free at your local ob unit at the hospital you gave birth in for your flat nipple.  She obviously may be used to the nipple from the bottle, as it is hard for a breastfeeding baby to go from boob to bottle.  You can also talk to a lactation consultant at your hospital.  There are many different positions to try when nursing, and your baby's mouth should be open wide, not just sucking your nipple but the area around your nipple as well.  Are you still producing any milk at 6 weeks?  That may also be a problem if she can't get anything out of them.  I nursed my daughter for 16 months, and at first there was a lot of trial and error, but all in all, went very well.  I also have large nipples, but they are not flat.  I do know people who have flat and inverted nipples and the nipple shield worked well for them.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped!|`|CVdcrY3kaa	I have very flat, rather large nipples. The only way I was able to get my baby to latch on was by doing this...<br>  <br>  I would take my thumb and my pointer finger and pinch the very edge of my areola, as I was doing that I would put the baby to my breast (get him/her to open up wide) I would have to fix my daughter's bottom lip repeatedly until it was out, and then she would be latched on properly. <br>  <br>  Stick with it!!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  *Wanted to tell you that I used this technique with the "c" hold wouldnt' work for me. If you can get the "c" hold to work, go for it!! My nipples were just too flat for it to work for my daughter.|`|GbxE1oOpaa	First for your sore nipples get some lanolin oil this will make a world of difference and help them heal.<br>  Second get a "nipple shield" you place this over your  nipple and feed the baby until your nipple is drawn out and then after a minute you can remove it and let her eat without it. My baby had problems latching on as well and what helped me was making sure her nose was aligned with my nipple which caused her to raise her head up to it and then when she opened wide point toward the roof of babys mouth and quickly pulled her on. She also had problems sucking and what helped correct this was a soothie pacifier.|`|QWN8KNCPaa	for the sore nipples get cabbage leaves, put them in fridge & in between feeds put them on your breasts right nipple may be a bit inverted it shouln't stop you breast feeding tho, when latching baby on make sure her mouth has whole nipple in if it doesnt feel comfortable keep trying until it does lots of patients require, few tears will be shed once you get the knack of it tho it's a wonderful expierence breastfed my daughter for 19 months!!!!|`|acj9mB9Paa	When you first try to feed, tickle his lips with your nipple and this should cause him to open his mouth very wide.  What I used to do was hold my breast with my hand shaped like a "C" and flatten the areola to get as much of the area into his mouth as possible.  If he still won't open wide enough you may be able to pull his little chin down with your finger to get him to open wider.  Are you on W.I.C.?  If you are and are still having trouble go to their office and ask for some help, they will be HAPPY to help you!!!  If not, call up to the hospital you had him at and see if they have a lactation nurse.  Maybe they could help you!  Good luck and keep trying!  It is SO worth it! I breast fed for 21 months!
vOFdHvlvaa	I babysat a lil boy who was breastfed who didn't like to take a bottle, but when i was watchin him he needed to have one (obviously lol) and i would hafta stroke his cheek to get him to but the bottle in his mouth, and then i'd hafta fight him a lil to ge thim to stat suckin, lol, he was 5 months old and stong lil boy, once he would start suckin he was usually fine unless something distracted him, then i'd hafta start all over again, but if i was patient enough he'd eventually take the bottle.  I'd have ur husband try to give her a bottle once a day (to her used to it so that ur mom can feed her when u go out) and it hasta be some besides u since u breastfed she really won't take a bottle from u.<br>  I dunno if this will work, but sometimes just the more u try the more likely they will eventually take it.  <br>  I'd say that for ur daughter any bottle that is most like the breast (lol not sure what one that is, since i use Dr. Brown's bottles for my son) and then stick with that bottle so that she can just get used to that one.<br>  Hope this helps and good luck, :D.<br>  <br>  This bottle might help:<br>  <a href="http://pregnancy.about.com/od/babyproducts/tp/tpbottles.htm" rel="nofollow">http://pregnancy.about.com/od/babyproduc...</a><br>  It says that it's a good one for goin back and forth between bottle and breast, not sure if it is, but maybe u could ask other who have used it and see what they think.<br>  <br>  This one might help too:<br>  <a href="http://www.bizrate.com/babyfeeding/products__keyword--adiri+breast+bottle.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bizrate.com/babyfeeding/produ...</a><br>  It's says it's the only nipple truly shaped like mother's breast, not sure if it's true or not, but i figured it wouldn't hurt for u to look at it and make up ur own mind about it.|`|IysNjfSDaa	My mom breast feed all her three children adn never used a bottle when my dad would feed us he would warm up pumped breast milk in a bowl and feed it to us using a baby spoon or a medicine dropper because we wouldn't take a bottle|`|deIzFnV8aa	We had the same problem with DD at the same age and still have not totally conquered it. Some things we have found helpful:<br>  <br>  Feed in a dim room to help calm her down, possibly aslo play soothing music or sing.  We find that a dim light that baby likes to look (like christmas lights or a colored night light) at is the ideal combo of quiet and distracting, if that makes sense.<br>  <br>  Have your mom sit in the same chair you use to nurse. Some people suggest giving her something that smells like you to wear, though that never really worked for us.<br>  <br>  if you haven't moved to a medium flow nipple yet, you couldl consider doing so. If your daughter has become an efficient nurser the slower flow might frustrate her.<br>  <br>  Don't nurse her right after she refuses the bottle, or she will learn her crying will get her what she wants.  wait 10 minutes and do something distracting in between.<br>  <br>  You can try feeding her right after a nap while she is still half asleep - a lot of babies will automatically start sucking w/o realizing what they are doing really.<br>  <br>  good luck!
GGH0HVdvaa	When I was 13, one day after school my boyfriend walked me home. We got to my house and went through the side gate to go in through the side garage door. We stopped just outside that door and he pulled me to him to give me a weird, awkward, and not at all pleasant kiss. I just pretended to like it and assumed all first kisses were terrible.

0xgHBEEFaa	This could be classed as Spotting... Which could mean you are pregnant. If you have had unprotected sex within the last couple of months, you should get checked. I hope that helps. XxxX|`|68l1TeDjaa	you could be about to start. it could also be a sign of pregnancy. but dont forget stress can make  you miss a period. just ask your doctor. buy a test if your not sure.
8pl3ShtBaa	Well your symptoms are just right for implantation bleeding, but i would say that you should go get another HPT and take it right away in the morning, it is a better indicator. Your hormone levels are higher in your first urine.<br>  <br>  Good Luck
deIzFnV8aa	What  may be happening is that your son might be getting to be more efficient at both nursing and digesting. Many babies do this sometime between 2-3 months. It is normal for babies to almost halve the time they spend eating compared to when they were newborns, even though they actually eat more now. Can you tell if he is taking big, gulping swallows?  I might try feeding him on only one side until he drains that breast, then offering the other if he still wants more. You accomplish two things by this - you make sure he gets the creamy hindmilk, and you have some way of measuring how much he is eating.  For example, if he eats for like 5 minutes and seems to have pretty much drained the breast, you can be pretty sure he just nursing really efficiently.<br>  <br>  BF babies also often start pooping less often as their digestive systems mature.  They can digest breast milk very efficiently, so it is common for them to poop only once a day or even only every few days.<br>  <br>  As long as your baby continues to have a normal number of wet diapers, and as long as he suddenly isn't clamoring to eat much more often, I wouldn't worry.|`|X6as2nOAaa	If he is not pooping at all contact a doctor, if it has just been a couple of days that happens all of the time.|`|UUysEV0yaa	As they get older they get more effiecient at feeding. Meaning it takes them less time to suck the same amount.<br>  <br>  If you are worried, keep a diary for a day, writing down when he feeds/length of feed, number of wet and pooey nappies etc, length of sleep. See your child care nurse or make an appt with your doctor.<br>  <br>  Im sure he is fine, lots of babies go through phases like this. But I can understand if you are worried as its your first.|`|IfKTQME0aa	He is probably getting more efficient at getting milk which means he doesn't have to feed that long anymore.  Also around this time poops will diminish in an EBF infant.  Some will only go once every two days or sometimes even a week or longer (my daughter would poop every four days after about 6 wks old).  As long as he isn't constipated when he poops he is fine.  Gaining weight and wet diapers are the way to really know if they are doing ok.  I was new to BFing and was so scared when my daughter only nursed 3 minutes in the morning.  I rented The Baby Weigh scale from the hospital pharmacy to see just how many ounces she was getting and sometimes in the morning she was getting 8 - 10 ounces with feeding 3 min per side!  I was shocked.  At around 3 months sometimes your milk supply will slow down and if it does don't get discouraged just keep nursing (and pumping if you do) and it will correct itself in a few days.  Good luck.|`|Ifk1Mgdbaa	try formula feedings i know you problem hate to do this but he may not be getting enough breast milk your breast produce milk on how much the baby eats and if his not eating alot form them they will dry up also try to pump milk from breast and give that to him from bottle the more you pump the more milk will come in|`|dfo5eKcbaa	Call the babies doctor he might want to see him or her if it goes on for more then 3 days then i would worry
uNzFexpRaa	Sounds highly likely that your pregnant but ya know the best way to tell??? Go to your GP and/or do a HPT. When did you do the test that was negative?

690279cb7caa51056d2e306c73dae94faa	Wow, it sounds you and I are in the same boat except mine is an overbearing mother-in-law.  We live with her so it makes it harder to get away.  She is like a fierce wolf.  Lately, I had to tell her to hand back my baby because she refused to.  I've had to become more aggressive for my little girl because I want her to know that I am her mother.  I hear saying that mommy loves you...oh I mean grammy.  You just have to be stricter with her if you want results.  Let her that if she crosses the line/boundary that you will limit the time she can have with him.  You need to step up to your mother and tell that you think she is taking him away from you.  Let her know that this is a big fear and that she is doing it right before your eyes.|`|R4WX5twzaa	It does sound like your mother is being too clingey with your son. The hardest people in the world to stand up to are the people you love, but you are his mother, and you decide what is best for your son, not YOUR mother. It sounds like you've already tried to speak to her nicely about this. Just say to her:<br>  <br>  "Mom, you know I love you, and I don't mean to hurt you when I say this, but I am [your son's name]'s mother, not you, and I feel like you're running me over to get to my son. I don't want you to have him all night at [your sister's name]'s wedding. He is my son and I want to spend time with him. I feel like you're taking him away from me. If you would like, you may babysit him every Saturday night/every-other Saturday night while [your husband's name] and I spend some time together/go out to dinner/go to a movie/etc. I love that you want to be a part of his life, and I'm sure he loves having you in his life, but I just need you to back off a little." <br>  <br>  Or something along those lines. Good luck!
Xs0fhFJnaa	I suspect I have more chance of winning the lottery than you do of being pregnant, and I don't even play it!<br>  <br>  Seriously - it's highly, highly unlikely. Far more likely to be a bit of cervical blood from your smear.<br>  <br>  You shouldn't mess about with all that morning after pill rubbish - they mess up your cycle for months and contain residual toxins. Some studies warn that they can be carcinogenic in the long term. The morning after is designed to be used in emergencies, but for heaven's sake, you're not going to get pregnant if you're on the pill and you didn't even have intercourse! Why on earth would you pollute your body with extra chemicals and synthetic hormones unnecessarily? Relax and have fun. If you're using the pill and condoms you'll be fine.|`|hT0frTVZaa	Its the pap smear probably, they should have warned you that you spot after it because they're scraping yourr cervix, that's normal.|`|WnlzScIyaa	You are fine, if you are on birth control and the condom didn't break, then there is no way that you can be pregnant. I was the same way. You are probably just spotting because the pap smear irritated your cervix. Just make sure you stay on birth control and always use a condom, and you won't have any problems! And also try not to take plan b unless you know you had an accident, it is not good for you and can harm you.  Don't freak out though! Trust me my husband and I were just like you in high school, we always used a condom, I was on birth control, and he pulled out! I walways freaked out still! But now that we are married I can't seem to get pregnant!|`|n86nMfbtaa	It's the Pap. I had a Pap Smear and had light bleeding afterwards, which I was told was normal. Your breats might be sore due to your period coming soon. And Plan B has no effects after the following week you take it. You should be fine!|`|rHufcHwHaa	Plan B will definitely mess with your system.  I took it once and I had 3 periods in the next two months...that's why they don't encourage people to use it as a form of birth control.<br>  <br>  I'm not saying you were wrong to take it--you weren't at all, so I hope I don't come off that way.  I wouldn't worry too much, but if you are, you can always take a pregnancy test to ease your fears.  Good luck!|`|giKCTfnfaa	chances of you being pregnant are really, really slim if you are on birth control and using condoms.  there's no need to worry.<br>  <br>  plan b can mess up your periods for a couple of months.   pms and early pregnancy have the same symptoms so your nipple tenderness isn't a good indicator of pregnancy. <br>  <br>  there can be some bleeding following  a pap but it's usually right after the  pap not a couple of days.|`|F0kjf1j8aa	ok first of all do not take plan b if it is not necessary, if you are on birth control and he uses a condom, you really don't need it, plan b can screw up your periods especially if you don't need it, but it can screw up you periods any way. I really do not think your pregnant, wait till thurs then take a test if  your worried, also if you give your boyfriend a hand job that's one of the safest things you can do and you have a better  chance of getting struck by lighting then getting pregnant that way|`|R4WX5twzaa	Sounds like someone's a little paranoid. You took Plan B because you gave your boyfriend a handjob? <br>  <br>  Okay, so you've been on birth control for over a year and you always use a condom. I'm going to assume that you take the pill, and that you take it correctly every single day and you don't miss pills. You use a condom when you have sex and it has never broken.<br>  <br>  The chance of you being pregnant right now are about 0%.|`|AA11348933	Oh, for heavens sake.  You've been on birth control for a year and you used a condom and it didn't break.  It would be highly unlikely that you're pregnant.|`|AA12192295	your probably spotting from the pap, it happens. Also Plan be can screw up your period for months, it did for me.
58f00eb827abff12eac8ed561f2ced1aaa	only if you WERE pregnant and you already miscarried but you still have high enough hormone levels to read a positive. I know its hard to believe but if you are positive, make an appointment asap. They will do a blood test to confirm. blood is more accurate. Good luck and congrats!|`|cj7sSPZEaa	Yes it is, but the chances are slim.  <br>  <br>  Reading the test outside the time frame given, chemical interference, certain medications, and evaporation lines all can cause a false positive.|`|nISYAHkfaa	It's very very very very VERY unlikely to have a false positive.<br>  <br>  So go see a doctor.|`|dg6wd8ufaa	Nope... It is EXTREMELY RARE. If it is positive go see a doctor asap!
nISYAHkfaa	"He is immature for not wanting a family."<br>  <br>  No, he is smart for wanting to get his life on track first. Get it right.<br>  <br>  "His job he has now is fine."<br>  <br>  But his dreams and ambitions are MUCH BETTER. And you need to grow up and realize this.<br>  <br>  You did lie by not telling him about missing a few days of your pills until you were pregnant.<br>  <br>  You sound really immature just by the way you are talking about this. Grow up, chicky babe. Not everybody wants a family right away. It sounds like YOU are the one who needs to do some major work before starting a family. Your boyfriend has a plan, you need to straighten up and get one too before pointing fingers. How do you plan on helping support your family? What dreams do you have aside from wanting babies? How can you NOT rely on your boyfriend to take care of you (because frankly, it's not his job and with your attitude, I think he's smart for balking!)? You'd better start figuring these things out and fast, because your boyfriend is smart not to stay with someone who doesn't respect that he's an autonomous person with dreams and hopes of his own.<br>  <br>  Spoiled brats these days . . .|`|AA10953561	While I agree that family is a wonderful thing, it isn't up to you to convince another person who definitely doesn't seem ready to have a family that it is the best thing for him. It's his life, not yours that you're trying to manipulate. He has a right to want to go to college and get a degree. He has a right to live the life he wants. I'm not saying he shouldn't help you out and support the child you two made together, but it seems like you're trying to force this on him when it's obvious he didn't want it in the first place. <br>  <br>  You can't make decisions for other people, especially decisions that change their entire lives. Having a child isn't something that should be done just because you think it's a good thing. You say this is unplanned, and I'll take your word for it, but you can't make him want this. He had plans and goals and you're telling him that his plans and goals aren't important. <br>  <br>  I don't know what to tell you. Have the baby but if he decides to not stick around then you're on your own. That's something you should have thought about before having sex with him (birth control or not).|`|AA11220327	you cant convince him that it is the best thing that has happened, because it isnt. From any mans point of view, that is being sneaky, and trapping him into having children that he is not ready for. It was very irresponsible to not use extra protection if you knowingly missed pills, not to mention very mean and unfair to him. men should have as much say as women in deciding when or if they want to have children. Your options at this point are to either not continue with the pregnancy, consider adoption, or have the baby and keep it knowing that you will be on your own. I know that is not ideal,  but it is do-able.|`|uJJPFJoyaa	That's great that he has a job, but in order to raise a family you need more than that in order to comfortably raise a family. The goal in getting into and completing college is one of them. You saying "college" isn't an answer to everything is incorrect, that degree will be a key for him to get a much better, high paying succesfull career. 19 is a bit too early to be thinking about a family, you should have been more careful with your decision, right now I bet he feels betrayed & that he is being pushed into something that he is not ready for. He might just leave you for that. Good Luck.|`|ZvkX9uNraa	You should never have to convince or beg the father of your child to want them. There is nothing that you can say or do to make that happen. If he does not want this baby, let him go. You can raise your baby without him. Your child is better off not having a man in their life that is going to resent them for ruining his life.|`|CHGTbgOmaa	maybe having a family is wonderful to you. not that you would know because your nineteen.  but your boyfriend might want to go to college. i cant think of any guy i know who would rather raise a family at nineteen instead of going to college. if youve been dating for a few months you are not ready to have a family with him. he isnt immature for not wanting a family. but you should want him to go to colelge if you want whats best for your baby. if you got pregnant on purpose your the immature one here.|`|n86nMfbtaa	it's not necessarily the "best" thing unless you have the money to raise a baby... and the time. are you in school or do you work? there are a lot more factors in having a baby than just... having it. take it from me, i'm eighteen and pregnant. LUCKILY, i have a decent paying cashier job and know how to manage my money. i have bought every single BIG item by myself (crib, stroller, carseat, etc) for the baby... so, the rest will be no problem. now i have to put off college and struggle paying for diapers and formula, etc. oh, and i need a babysitter while i'm at work! no, it's not the best thing. <br>  <br>  however, on your part, it's not fair that he abandon you for being pregnant. he needs to take responsibility for his child. it's not the child's fault you forgot your pills.<br>  <br>  you can't convince him this is the best thing... but you can TRY convincing him the baby needs a father.|`|nBGjPwViaa	You were dishonest.<br>  You're not mature enough for marriage.<br>  Grow up.|`|giKCTfnfaa	he needs to understand even if you had taken your birth control properly, it's still not 100%.  if he wanted 100% protection, he should have been using a condom with spermicide while you were on the pill.  granted, 19 is still young to have children but it's not like you both are still in high school.  and having a child doesn't mean you can't go to college.  many people who have a family go to college.  most of my mom's side of the family didn't go to college until after their children were born.  if he leaves, then nail his butt for child support!

If they won't say, just be sure to look nice when they are most likely to make it. Normally, you can always tell when somebody is hiding something big. Lol. <br>  <br>  If I'm having one, I'm giong to probably have it at around 30 weeks, just because my doctor said I'm at an extremely high risk of delivering early due to several factors.

CX8ly9Xbaa	i think that if you have one child together and he loves him then in the end he will love this baby too...i am 22 weeks pregnant and my boyfriend doesn't want to keep it either so i know how your feeling but if he really loves you he will be happy with whatever choice you make and stand by you|`|pkCpNGzcaa	It is really up to you whether or not to keep the baby. I believe that once the baby is out in the world he will love it to death. It may take a month or two, but he will love it. But remember, you are the mom and you are the one that is pregnant, it's really up to you. He may not feel a connection with the baby right now, but you do, so I say keep and he will love it eventually.|`|SYMwnH3jaa	It's a possibility but even if he doesn't you don't need him to raise a child.  My mother raised four children basically on her because my father was a dead beat dad if you know what I mean.  So I wish you the best, and I hope it helps|`|F0kjf1j8aa	he may just be nervous about the baby, guys just act different then us,if you want the baby keep the baby and be happy, one day he may change his mind or maybe he won't, either way love this baby and everything will be fine, good luck to you|`|SZfLNbHFaa	i think when he first hears this baby cry, or sees its smile, he will regret not wanting him/her:-)

She goes by her middle name, which is Renee. <br>  <br>  sooo yeah.. It is a really really pretty name, but kids these days...|`|NOz2NIMTaa	No way! Babmi sound's like a street walker's name! If you name your daughter that, she's gonna really get teased. Before you name her, concider what bullies might say!|`|OTnkoPSdaa	I like the name Bambi!!! Its cute and fun!!! For a middle name that starts with R, I would name her Rosalie!!! :)|`|R1cey1Evaa	It is cute for a deer. anyways. <br>  <br>  Bambi:<br>  Rebecca<br>  Rachel<br>  Raine|`|AOkucu5haa	Stripper.|`|5ajVBIN8aa	Bambi???!!! NO WAY!!! this girl might have alot of bullying because of her name.. if you love her, forget this name..|`|Lo5yiBqzaa	Bambi is a stripper or porn star name.  Sorry, I don't like it.|`|AXEqOEloaa	No, No and No!|`|7f2xnVeJaa	Bambi's mother was shot.|`|BqCtKeA2aa	no way! bambi is a deer!
oTlwONCbaa	very normal some people start their periods in 4th grade some start theirs when they are around 20 all in between that is perfectly normal|`|H0sPCJQPaa	Yep|`|Sm9cq8KKaa	Yup. My mom's friend got hers at 17, her other friend got it at 9, I got it at 10, she got it at 11. There is a wide range of normal.|`|N2KmE3rVaa	Sure it could be normal but now a days people r getting it while they're young. I got mine wen i was 11.|`|jU5wdiCuaa	yes its very normal|`|jY31JaCeaa	a little late, but better late than never!|`|0xgHBEEFaa	Yes that's perfectly normal. Some people start very young. I.e. 9-10 and some start when they are in their late teens early adulthood. So you are perfectly normal. XxxX|`|zNSDHpV6aa	yep
bc9inzicaa	My nephews and niece were formula fed and the way my sisters and I prepared their bottles were just to pour 2 oz of water per scoop of powder into a regular bottle.  Cap the bottle and shake the mixture (hard) until well mixed.  Immediately feed and toss what the baby did not finish.  <br>  <br>  I have five nephews and a niece who all turned out perfectly fine!  <br>  <br>  They had no problems with gas, but what you could do, if you are worried about air/gas, is then pour the mixed formula into a drop-in Playtex bottle and squeeze out the air.<br>  <br>  :)|`|qrfJ0ffiaa	I'm in the UK an all our formula is 1 scoop of formula to 1 oz of water. It should have guidelines on the back of the box/tin/packet of formula. As for the mixing, I just used to shake the bottle until dissolved, don't think I ever counted, I just shook. I used Avent bottles. Also dont leave the mixture to settle, there really is no need and the longer formula is left the more bacteria will form, mix and serve straight away!<br>  <br>  I think youre looking into this far too much!! Lol.|`|X6as2nOAaa	You are thinking about this way too much. Similac for every 2 oz of water one scoop is of formula. Shake the bottle a couple of times so that you cannot see the formula at the bottom of the bottle, I shake it about 5 times. The bubbles will go out you don't need to let it sit there for that long, I would say you can feed the baby right after shaking it, if you feel you need to wait then go get a bottle with the drop in so you can push the air out yourself.|`|ibWLdXlJaa	I actually have a variety of bottles now that he's a bit older. We were using the Gerber bottles and we didn't have any problems with them. There are Dr. Brown bottles that are supposed to be really good. Your best bet would be not to use a spoon to mix it and just shake it. Don't let it sit out either. If you do have problems there are Mylicon drops you can give her directly or in her bottles. Good luck.|`|y6g0RnuAaa	I have a Dr Brown's mixing pitcher that makes mixing and making bottles a breeze- and no bubbles! I will post a link in a minute- it has a spinning stirrer in it.<br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dr-Browns-Formula-Mixing-Pitcher/dp/B0010L98DI" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Dr-Browns-Formula-...</a><br>  <br>  I bought it at a babiesrus store.|`|5M5vt5Rnaa	I swear by Dr. Browns.<br>  <br>  I also bought the Dr. Browns mixing pitcher which is meant to properly mix the powder and water so there is no clumps.|`|be3e5b583c027426a0f22b62804479f0aa	Dr. Brown's pitcher for mixing - THE BEST<br>  Born Free bottles - NO BUBBLES - a little expensive, but definitely worth it.|`|PvMmElhzaa	A good bottle I found useful was the Playtex Drop-In systems. Never had a problem with my daughter and that bottle, although I put breastmilk in them, it's still the same and eliminated bubbles and trapped air.<br>  I personally wouldn't let the powder and water sit there for 15-20 minutes because everything tends to separate and such and you get better texture by shaking it up.<br>  I would shake it until there are no lumps in the bottle.|`|lJ5Ao2aIaa	The best bottle I have used is AVENT. Their bottles take out all the bubbles. I also shake the bottle hard before giving it to my baby and it doesn;t need 15-20 mins!! just look and you will notice the bubbles disappear after a while... give it maximum 5 minutes... if u r using a different bottle than AVENT you can shake the bottle hard then open in for a couple of seconds to let the air out.|`|hpR1BOYjaa	My favorite bottle was Avent.  No bubbles, no fifteen million parts to it.<br>  <br>  How many times?  I just shook it up a few times with my finger on the nipple.  <br>  <br>  Bubbles are going to get in whether you wait or not because air is moving in and out of the bottle.  I wouldn't let it sit - you could be risking germs to grow.|`|2ZoUduoPaa	Since powder formula mix is much cheaper, I use it too.  I also was have problems with all the bubbles.  Letting it sit in the bottle a while wasn't convenient for us, because my little one is very impatient.  When she's ready for a bottle, she wants it 10 mins ago. LOL<br>  <br>  I found it easiest to mix a big batch.  I averaged about what she would drink in a day's time, and would mix it in a pourable container, by shaking well.  I would mix (x) amount of formula to the correct amount of water.  I would do this before bedtime, that way it could sit in the fridge for a while, and bubbles would go away.  Readied formula can sit in the fridge anywhere from 48-72 hours safely.  But for precautions, I only mix what I know she'll drink within a day to 2 days time.
58f00eb827abff12eac8ed561f2ced1aaa	if you're 3 weeks late, have you,  tested yet? If not, get a test, honey!! Morning sickness is a funny thing, its not really "morning" sickness. It can happen morning, noon, night, while your asleep, all day or just a few  minutes. Take a test and if its negative, wait a few days and retest. If you have missed a period and dont get a positive, you should see the doctor to see what;s going on. They can do a blood test to get more accurate results. Good luck!|`|a12cbnR4aa	I am 7 weeks and usually just get nauseous after I eat breakfast. I've never thrown up though. Every woman is different through her pregnancy. You may be a lucky one that doesn't get sick. I didn't start feeling sick until about 6 weeks.|`|ZbnxGIsnaa	Well, with my son I was deathly ill.  I couldn't eat nor drink anything.  I just constantly felt ill.  It feels like you've been spinning a lot.  You know what I mean?  Motion sickness?<br>  <br>  Yes, it can hit anytime of the day.  Why not visit an OB and have an ultrasound done to see if you are pregnant.  If it makes you feel any better I got my first positive when I was 5 weeks late with my son.  Best of luck to you!
a9b3850496c6d2e026d3e06d78b32ecfaa	Our son is 12 and I nurse in front of him all the time...it is normal. He says it is normal- it is the way you feed a baby and we have taught him this. If I had to cover up every time I nursed our newborn, you'd never see the newborn. It's all biology and it's healthy. <br>  <br>  Likewise, I have pumped in front of my kids. If you are in the kitchen and I am pumping, you are going to see it and I don't care who you are. <br>  <br>  As a society, we need to get over "hiding" breasts for feeding. Silly really when all mammals nurse to feed.<br>  <br>  Good luck re-lactating...that is such hard work! I hope you are successful at it.|`|CVdcrY3kaa	First off, it's awesome that you're relactating! I had to relactate in order to breastfeed my daughter, and it was a long road - but totally worth it! I think it's perfectly normal/healthy for you to do this in front of your other children, if they ask - just explain it to them. They're old enough to understand that you're doing what is best for their sibling and it's not weird or disgusting.|`|930a625eb301aae633a9b9d8e18e0752aa	Sure, what a better way to learn about this? I was very open about breastfeeding and pumping my daughter in front of my older children, and the novelty wore off rather quickly. I breastfed my daughter until about a month ago, and she's 2. If you don't make a huge deal out of it either will they. Kids only know things like this are odd if they are told, or given reason to think it is. If you play it off as normal, so will they.|`|AA11348933	What better way to teach them that nursing is the normal way to feed a child.  There is nothing shameful in what you are doing and to have to go to the back room every time you need to pump/feed your baby would be too hard to keep an eye on your older children.<br>  <br>  Good luck with the relactation.  Great for you for doing that for your child!|`|uMIvRRjoaa	Heck yah! This is a great way to instill in them that breastfeeding is normal, and breasts are not only for "sexual" purposes. I used to nurse my dd in front of my niece- I think the last time my daughter was around 30 months and my niece was 6-7 yo. ;-)|`|MeYILJeSaa	Oh yeah, that would be fine. <br>  Iza, you're an idiot. Breasts are meant to serve as nourishment for children, I don't understand what your big hang-up is.|`|8XcRFF6Taa	As long as they are your children, it's fine.  Breastfeeding is the way babies are supposed to be fed.  There isn't anything wrong or disturbing about it.... I nursed and pumped in front of my 4yr old son.  He knows that babies need Mommy's milk, not a big deal(if he was older I would still do it in front of him, it isn't necessary to inconvenience you every time your baby is hungry):)  <br>  <br>  If you are trying to get your milk back, than sorry to say but it is necessary to be pumping at least ever 2-3 hours durring the day.  Once you have gotten your supply back you can slow down on the pumping, lol, I know it's hard!  Good luck|`|AA11019513	I dont see a problem with it. All they know is that thats how the baby is fed. I breastfed my son in front of his brother. And pumped as well. All he did was sat there and watched me. He was only 13 months old at the time, but him sitting there while his baby brother nursed or while i pumped, he felt involved.  I even breastfed in front of my friends 5 year old son, and we had a conversation the whole time about why the baby did not use a bottle, and if the baby was eating milk or water!LOL!  I think that being in your own home, its ok to do it in front of the children.  Like i said before, yea my son was still little when his baby brother came along, but he was facinated by watching me pump. He even tried to use it!LOL!!!!! I used the time of pumping and feeding to bond with both of the boys, and not just the baby..|`|z6IekuwSaa	I have pumped and nursed in front of my relatives that are young. It is a great way to show them that it is normal, and this is how to feed a child. Also it is great to open the dialog and tell them how milk is made, even cow's milk works the same way. Great learning experience! And great job for you on relactating, it's hard, Good Luck hun!|`|ZnN7KTinaa	I do.|`|1485ed10658f5fff9f00587d44259041aa	While I would NEVER do this in front of a room full of relatives or anything, I freely nurse and pump in my own home in front of my husband and my 6 year old son.  He was breastfed, so it's not like he hasn't seen my  breasts before.  I also think it's rather healthy to see breasts used for what they are meant to be used for instead of seeing them objectified for sexual reasons on TV.<br>  <br>  It's kind of funny, I am a teacher of 7-8 year olds, and many of them don't know that babies feed from their mother's breasts.  When I teach about mammals drinking their mother's milk, many of them say "humans don't" but then the few that have been exposed to this just smile and nod their heads yes.  They aren't scarred by the sight of seeing a woman breast feed, and they aren't eager to share it.  It's something they clearly see as natural.  <br>  <br>  My son doesn't think anything of it.  While my husband and baby sleep in the morning, my son and I get ready for school.  I pump my baby's breakfast while I do my make-up and my son eats his breakfast.  He isn't grossed out at all.  And he also doesn't run around school saying he's seen boobs or anything.  I think it is better if you do it in front of your kids rather than hide it.  It is nothing to be ashamed of.  <br>  <br>  Good luck with relactating, you are truly a dedicated mommy!

ZbnxGIsnaa	Yes, it is a sign of pregnancy.  Here are some other things to notice with breast changes during pregnancy..<br>  <br>  Why are my breasts so sore now that I'm pregnant?<br>  <br>  Hormonal changes during pregnancy cause increased blood flow and changes in the breast tissue, which may make your breasts feel swollen, sore, tingly, and unusually sensitive to touch. Some women describe the sensation as an exaggerated version of how their breasts feel before their period.<br>  <br>  Breast tenderness is one of the earliest signs of pregnancy. It usually starts around 4 to 6 weeks and lasts through the first trimester.<br>  <br>  <br>      * Your nipples. In addition to achiness and tingling, your nipples may be protruding more than usual (your high-beams are on.) And, although they might look luscious, they probably don't feel that way. In fact, they may be incredibly, perhaps agonizingly tender.<br>      * Your areolas. If you're like most women, your areola (the dark area around the nipple) has become darker, possibly spotted, and just plain bigger, a phenomenon that will continue as the months pass. Your areola will also be sporting Montgomery tubercles, little goose bumps (actually sweat glands) that supply lubrication to the area.<br>      * Your breasts. You'll also notice a complex highway of blue veins just below the skin's surface, which carry nutrients and fluids from mother to baby. The good news: Your breasts may continue to grow, but they'll probably stop hurting after the first trimester. Even better news: Your breasts will (almost) return to their former glory (or petite beauty) in the months after birth.|`|Ya2j2ENaaa	It's a sign of pregnancy, but it could be other things too.  If you're not pregnant then I recommend using ovulation tests to see when you are ovulating.  I have irregular periods so I was concerned and the very first time we used the tests to try to conceive - we did!!  They're really easy to use and can be found in any grocery/drug store.  :)<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|N1IqgXfvaa	When i fell pregnant last time, my breast were very painfully sore about 1 week before my period was due. I get this normally but no where near as bad as it was. <br>  Wanting a child so bad can play tricks on your body though and cause phantom symptoms also. <br>  <br>  Good Luck hun :), we are trying again after a recent miscarriage.
jY31JaCeaa	Yes it's normal.  Your 13!!  just one year over 12!  I had my first boyfriend when i was 15.  Wait till high school to date|`|N2KmE3rVaa	Thats totally normal, this year was the first year ALL of my guy friends started noticing me and i think i am ugly. Oh and im 13 2, i finally decided it was ime 2 live a little and go out with one of my BESTEST guy friends ever. I am now EXTREMELY happy with my decision. And i love my boyfriend.<br>  But u dont want ALL or ever a few of your guy friends 2 like u cuz if u dont like then back or think they would be a good boyfriend cuz of their playeryness then u dont want them 2 ask u out.<br>  But 2 answer your question again, its totally normal.|`|jcVJM8FNaa	Hey guurrrl(:<br>  <br>  I'm 13 too, and just like you, I always think the same thing=/ Like you, I'm not ugly and I do have a lot of both-gender friends.

Doesn't mean we're ugly(: In highschool, you will probably be asked out because everyone is maturing and dating, so right now, for middle school, don't worry (:<br>  <br>  <br>  Hit me up: SRPeace90@yahoo.com <br>  <br>  If you have any questions(:|`|TaFrxxJXaa	normal. don't worry about it. I look at it as, most 13 year old guys aren't looking for a real relationship or love. Girls seek the attention from guys like they see in movies, the flowers, the kisses, every small touch sends your heart flying. 13 year old guys just want to be able to tell their friends they have a girl friend. they aren't mature enough. :)|`|CdJtH0xdaa	Oh please. Most thirteen-years-olds have never had dates. Seriously, it's not that big a deal. There are college kids who haven't had dates. Honestly, stop worrying about getting a boyfriend and just live life.

I am 16 and have never had a boyfriend, or been asked out.  You have the rest of your life to be "asked out".|`|5vjUWV4Iaa	Sounds like me i didn't get asked out for the first time till high school and i was 15 <br>  so the guys are just to stupid and immature at 13 just wait and thank god your single because guys are a whole bunch a drama and it just causes problems. <br>  just wait till the time is right
hoX7hoINaa	She could have the flu or something causing her period to be late (sickness will do that). If she hasn't tested, she can now. Results are better once a week late. Use clear blue easy digital to be the most accurate. If you buy at walmart, typical price can be between $7-$15, but its worth the price when you need to know. I spent I believe $15 on the clear blue and got 2 tests in the box.|`|3505983107c631451310c5009361ae76aa	well if her period is a week late then if she tests now it should give an accurate answer. they don't cost much to buy and you can get them in a number of places.|`|1HDvbLdWaa	morning sickness does not show up that soon.<br>  so thats not it.<br>  and usually when you have sex right before your period you will most likely not get pregnant, thats the worst time to have sex and try and have a baby lol.<br>  so im sure she doesnt have to worry,<br>  but if you want to be sure, then go ahead and buy a test, it'll work right now|`|peQGGFPYaa	Yes a pregnancy test would work at this point since she is now late for her period. If you go to the pharmacy like walgreens  its usually upwards of 7 dollars depending on what brand you get. Or you can go to a planned parenthood.|`|62dfb7ea071ca9af65c41faf6cc6de0baa	You can pick up a pregnancy test for under $10 at any drug store. Pregnancy tests are designed to detect the Hcg hormone by the time you miss you period. So if she's already late- it should give you an accurate reading.|`|6h8oPROtaa	Just go and get one just to find out if she is or not|`|uNzFexpRaa	Wait a week or two more for her period to come and if it doesn't grab a pregnancy test- each womans body is different so yes there is a chance that she could be pregnant but to be honest i dont think the morning sickness etc would start as soon as within a week of unprotected sex. Im 10 weeks pregnant and started with severe morning sickness at about my 5th week of pregnancy. Just hang on in there and like i said wait and see!!<br>  <br>  Note for the future tho - If you dont want children yourselves at the moment then if the result is negative then use contraception! Don't use excuses like 'we dont like condoms etc' there are many different forms of birth control out there!
CdJtH0xdaa	Blood tests do not hurt. You barely feel the needle. In all honesty, they are more uncomfortable, because they wrap a huge strip of rubber around your upper arm to get the vein to pop up, and that's annoying as hell. Otherwise, blood tests are painless. You might get a bruise afterward, which might freak you out, but there is nothing wrong. Just a little warning.|`|RQvLrKMXaa	You will feel a stick and some pressure, but nothing that cannot be tolerated.  Not to worry.|`|dd8cb229ee241de8ca385f84ec4b33d7aa	If the person knows what they are doing, you will hardly feel it<br>  <br>  I had blood test, that hurt<br>  <br>  Most, you do not feel it<br>  <br>  It you get one that hurts, that is not normal|`|jKkbfm59aa	ask them for numbing medication it will help some<br>  you can just kinda feel in going through just some pressure but its really quick and then the thing that kind of hurts is the band on your arm that makes the blood come out easier while they are doing it make sure you look away and dont look at all it grossed me out when i looked and by the end i was almost like faint/about to throw up so dont look, and also make sure you are relaxed and try not to get all nervous and stuff cause if you do you will think it will hurt a lot therefore you will think that it will hurt more|`|qpmGLd7laa	The most you'll feel is a slight pinch, but it's nothing severe.  Don't worry.  Don't watch the needle go in, and don't strain your arm or anything.  If you think it's bad, well, you'll think it's bad.|`|H90uflbFaa	really its that that bad, its just like getting a shot. its feel like a small pinch and its over before you know it.|`|Z4QbQt3Xaa	It's just a little pinprick; don't be such a baby!<br>  Don't watch, that just builds up apprehension.|`|ozWi3TJlaa	I have an especially strong fear of needles, but when I'm actually in the chair with my heart racing it's never as bad as I anticipated.  I think the fear is actually worse than the actual needle.  It honestly doesn't hurt that much and it's over pretty quickly.  Relax, hold someone's hand if you need to, and don't watch if you don't want to...you'll be just fine.  Afterward, treat yourself to an ice cream or something else you like.  Then, you'll associate the blood test with a reward and next time will be easier.|`|hGY08GjRaa	It feels like a pinch. It's not that bad, and it's over pretty quickly.. it won't kill ya.  Alot depends on how "easy" it is for them (some people's veins are easier to find and get to than others.) and how "good" the nurse/etc is who is doing the insertion. <br>  <br>  It helps if you look away when you know they're actually inserting the needle. I always do. I have gotten LOTS of shots and blood tests in my life.. I donate blood every 3 months, which means laying down  with a huge needle in my arm for about 20 minutes.  <br>  <br>  Just don't look at it, stay calm, and you'll be find. It doesn't hurt that much.|`|AA12163365	Depends on how good you are with needles. If you're fine with them than it probably won't hurt that much but if you're like me and are terrified of needles then it will hurt a lot but it goes away quickly. It also depends on the person extracting the blood and if they know what they're doing.|`|N2KmE3rVaa	It doesn't hurt, i've had 6 and im 13.<br>  Sure i can feel the needle go in but it doesn't hurt a lot. As long as u dont look at the blood then u'll be fine. And it all depends how much blood they need 2 take out. IF they take out a large tube then u can feel your arm go a little numb cuz they're taking out a lot if blood.|`|tht0DrHsaa	It doesn't hurt as bad as it sounds.  You will be fine.  How are you getting a blood test done on Sunday?|`|g4UAzGuMaa	just a pinch just dont look at the needle when they put it in ur arm and it is a lil bit nicer that way|`|gP0gYbBaaa	i've never had one/ just look away, thats wat i heard|`|upVQxbmwaa	they pinch. but not to much. if your getting your blood drawn, then you might feel woozy and tired, if its just a small blood extract it wont be bad. if they know what their doing and using the right needle, then you will be fine, its just the initial poke, that feels like a tight pinch, but once that happens your home free, and you get a lollipop.|`|gaGeR55maa	Not at all ... it is really a pinch but make sure you drink water my sister and I had to go recently and she didn't drink any water and wound up passing out. And another suggestion is don't look, whenever I watch something like that I personally get nauseous so I usually just put my arm out adn close my eyes and its over before you know it.|`|shjSYd2jaa	well i have never actually had A blood test, but i have an IV before. i would say they would hurt about the same, an it didn't really hurt, like you i am young.|`|wJv71qjTaa	I am 13 and I got a blood test recently.

fE5zMOfJaa	An epidural is a piece of cake compared to childbirth!  That's why people get them!<br>  For some women childbirth is more painful than it is to other women!  My mom slept through her labor w/ me & she hadn't taken any meds!  But when I was in labor w/ my son believe me....it hurt like heck!<br>  It's good just to go into labor w/ an open mind.  Don't be dead set on getting an epidural but also don't feel bad if you get one!|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	lol yes it hurts thats y they offer an epi. i didnt have an epi <br>  natural birth hurts like hell and i was so sooo tired after words 18 hrs of labor|`|F8iyUqJBaa	It depends on where you birth.  If you choose to go to a hospital, they are not designed for natural birth.  they lay you on a bed and attach cords and tubes to you and don't let you move.  Moving is essential in a natural birth.  When you are home or at a birthing center you are able to move around and let your body do what it need.  The most wonderful birth is a water birth.  It takes all the pain away.  The two things that cause pain are fear and anxiety.  Both are brought on in a hospital.  When you are in a setting that is familiar, such as home it's not there as much, especially with good support such as a husband or even just the midwife.  The painkillers that are given in the hospital are narcotics and sisters to Heroine.  Also laying on your back is the WORST way to give birth, but it is convenient for the doctors so that's why you end up that way.|`|0iUxfCMcaa	all depends on how she handles pain. personally the shot doesnt hurt its just like any other shot. the natural labor part all depends on the pregnancy, the baby's size and how the mother handles pain. i had three delivers all differently. first was emergency csection second was vbac with the epidoral third was vbac with no pain meds and the funny thing is the third one was the less painful to recover from lol. but the epidural does stop all pain u just feel pressure.|`|6gtgiCS7aa	It is so painful the only way to deal with it is to forget it. I had a stillbirth at 5.5 months of pregnancy and I had NEVER had such pain in my life. Literally, I felt like I was being torn apart. Part of me was closing while the part right beside it was opening. Terrible. Ouch. I threatened the nurse and had to apologize ... and I asked her why my mother had four kids (I am the fourth).|`|r7q8LW7Aaa	LESS painful???????<br>  Wow, that's just crazy.<br>  honestly, I had a natural. On a scale of one to ten... i'd say about a twenty.<br>  I found it horrendously painful BUT a lot of people have a higher pain threshold and some people can cope with a natural birth. Mine was simply too fast to have any drugs but believe me, I wanted them!|`|KGppArcfaa	My friend who has 2 kids had an epidural with the first, and nothing with the second. She said natural was very painful and she was screaming, but she liked it better, and if she has more kids, she'll do it natural again.<br>  For me, im glad I had an epidural, it took the pain away so that I could really focus on my daughters birth. I had a wonderful experience and Im glad the pain didnt get in the way of enjoying it.|`|Agke8iBGaa	I had a natural birth and yes it hurt like he--.<br>  But it was worth it.<br>  But after a few hours you don't even remember the pain because you are so consumed with that tiny life that your mind is so focused on them and not on your pain.<br>  Plus your body forgets it soon enough anyway. <br>  Days later you will not remember how bad it hurt.<br>  <br>  Congratulations to your friend!|`|bGRexKPyaa	The shot doesnt hurt. IDK why people say it does.<br>  <br>  They now insert just the tip of the needle, squirt a little in...(just to numb it a little) Then stick the rest in. Its a small needle its just long to control the positioning..<br>  <br>  <br>  GET THE EPIDERAL!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|kziIf0r6aa	Tell your friend its like trying to squeeze a watermelon out of a hole the size of a grape|`|hpR1BOYjaa	Well... if natural birth was less painful, then wouldn't we all not have an epidural?  The argument makes no sense.|`|OTXFuGFMaa	let her know that it feels like a civil war era cannon being fired directly into her vagina.
ytE1q20taa	Well I asked my mum to buy me a pregnancy test, so that kinda told her in it's self, and I didn't get a chance to tell my fiance, we both still live with our parents and I wanted to tell him to his face not over the phone so had to wait about a week, but I did tell a friend, I told her not to say anything as I wanted to tell him face to face but as soon as we hung up the phone she called him up and told him. ***** took away the 'special moment' where I tell him we are having our first child, I'll never get that moment back. Make sure your boyfriend is the first person you tell, believe me, from experience, it's really gutting having him call you up 10 minutes after you told your friend and tell you she told him.<br>  Good luck which ever way you tell them.<br>  (I was and still am 18 btw)|`|HvoOeTVuaa	First, learn how to speak correctly and spell correctly.

Okay so it's not like your 16 or something. You have to strait out tell them. Little advice: act really broken the day you tell them.

Hope this helps. :)|`|SdEtY9GQaa	Tell your boyfriend first. if he is true to you he will ask you to marry you.

Everyone goes through things (even PK's do).  I will pray that God gives you wisdom about how to tell your boyfriend and parents.
C55pji5Qaa	Yes,but it is very important that it is under control during your pregnancy.It may make it harder to get pregnant,as in my case, because it was preventing me from ovulating every month. It is possible but you must take it very seriously the moment you conceive!
ZbnxGIsnaa	It depends on what test they use.  I think you should go back when you've officially missed your period.  ACTUALLY.<br>  <br>  Take a home pregnancy test first before you go see your OB and see if it comes back positive or negative and then go from there.  Remember until you have enough hcg in your system it will come back negative at home and at the doctor's office.  Don't let them make you feel bad though!<br>  <br>  They rely TOO much on those tests and they can be wrong from time to time.  Best of luck to you!|`|DDYwnut6aa	A urine test - well that's about as accurate as the over the counter tests.  I would schedule an appt. with my OB/GYN and tell him/her about the ER visit and go from there.  A blood test would be the best way to find out.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you!|`|7IkY8Wplaa	If they do a blood test and send it out to a place like Labcorp or Quest, they can detect a pregnancy level of 5 or more.<br>  <br>  If they do a urine test, it can detect between 25-50 minimum.<br>  <br>  If they do it in the office, with blood, it depends on how accurate their assay is. I work at a fertility clinic and our lab can detect as low as 1.<br>  <br>  BUT this test would only come out positive if it's taken at least 2 weeks after ovulation. If you haven't missed your period yet, any pregnancy test may be negative. Better to wait until next week, instead of paying good money for an early (and possibly false negative) test.|`|AA10408209	You most likey aren't pregnant but urine test I believe take some time to actually work. However, I took a test a few days before my period was due  since I was experiencing some odd symptoms and it worked for me. After the HPT came out positive, I made an appointment with the doctor and had them do a blood test to make sure that I was pregnant too. <br>  <br>  I don't think that you are pregnant and what made you think that you were if you're only experiencing stomach problems. That could be a number of things and I hope that you find out exactly what is wrong.<br>  <br>  Good luck and take care :)|`|3MDY29gnaa	Their urine test are basically the same as the ones you would buy from the store. Not 100%. But if you would have took a blood test it would have been around 99% accurate. I would still say to wait it out until your Missed AF and then it AF still isn't here then go in for blod test. Good Luck. <br>  Hope i helped a little!

elx4NP4xaa	I think your mom might you are hanging around with the wrong  crowd. She might think your friends are a bad influence on you, It's not you its your friends. I don't think this had to do with the movie at all. Next time just explain to her that your friends are cool and you just want to see them not the movie.  Apologize to your mom for calling her a b@@@.|`|GOfxZ5Utaa	i agree with jake. i hate parents who treat their kids like babies. like i'm 17 but when i was 15 my mom told me i wasn't allowed to have a bf till i was 16. i called her far worse things than a b**. i really love my bf alot and we've been dating even when i was 15. i wasn't going to be controlled by some B** telling me who i was going to date! it's the United States i can date who i want and you should see any movie you want! for real. and who says your mom has to know. just like jake says everyone here who answered this are parents who don't know how to raise kids and these kids who get controlled against their will end up hating their parents. like i'm almost 18 and i told my mom for years if she won't trust and won't give me a chance with things and all that then i will leave. i have the money. i can go i'll move with my bf. there tell her that it will work|`|ernuOyycaa	what i would do is call up one of your friends to give you a ride. who cares what your mom thinks. like my parents are never home ever it's just me and i get to go out with my friends anytime i want. just do that call up a friend. these other people who answered you question are all moms or dads or both who don't know sh** about what it's like in high school. i know what you saying. if you already said you were going they will think your a flake. just go anyway gosh.|`|t3kmknEMaa	i agree just get a friend to take u and tell you mom to stop with this or you are going to leave. i want to see friends of mine and my mom is nice enough to let me. if she didn't then yeah she i would do the same thing. you really need to tell her to get a grip! i'm getting mad just from reading that. just do what ashley says if you keep telling your mom that you are going to leave when you get older it should work. the thing is ashley sounds like she is being serious though lol. like i remember that one time there was going to be a party at someones house and everyone had a good time my mom messed it up by showing up demanding me to leave and embarrassing me so i told her no and then everyone stood up for me and told her to leave then she called the cops. that got me angry. i wont furget that. so my advice is if you go anyway just be careful cuz she might call the cops on you to take you home but think of it this way. once your 18 she can't do that anymore. don't listen to these F** up parents who are answering. in two years you can do what ever and in the matter a fact go and to the movies anyway with a friend to drive you and have a good time like everyone else. your no where near immature. well hope this helps|`|p2Njf5gBaa	Losing your temper and yelling at her and calling her a B*tch only showed her that you aren't acting mature.  <br>  <br>  Perhaps if you really wanted to go, you could have shown her how responsible you are by doing some chores around the house and offering to help her do somethings around the house.|`|MHOxPs8Oaa	When you quit acting like a baby maybe she will stop treating you like one.

Wait till you go to high school, it's gonna feel even more awkward for you because there are going to be alcohol and drug scene, and you might not be into that.

Ka52nbhNaa	Ok - slow down and take this one step at a time.<br>  <br>  You are probably NOT pregnant as you had your period the next day and it is unlikely that you were ovulating when this terrible thing happened.  You need to find $10.00 or even less if you live near a dollar store to get a home pregnancy test.<br>  <br>  Try to breathe and relax - I know it is hard . . . but you need to take it one step at a time - the stress of thinking OMG, I am pregnant what do I do . . . is a few steps ahead of where you are at the moment.  <br>  <br>  First confirm whether or not you are pregnant.  If you are then go to your local planned parenthood, they will help you figure out the next steps to take whether it be abortion, adoption, counseling and keeping your child etc . . . but I truly believe in my heart that you are unlikely pregnant.  Your calculations are probably off with the short month and stress.<br>  <br>  I also recommend talking to another adult, counselor, clergy, etc . . . to help you get through this.<br>  <br>  Best wishes!|`|x7WphuY5aa	why don't you look around for adoption there is a lot of people out there that cant have there own child and would love to have on and they would pay for all the dr bills and i think you should have posted this els where because we are all trying to conceive and you want to kill so maybe think next time about where you post thing|`|oHNrktxTaa	O honey, my heart goes out to you. I am so sorry that something like this has happened to you. There still may be a chance that you aren't pregnant & your period can be late due to all the emotional & physical stress.

I don't see how she would throw you out of the house. This apparently is NOT your fault! Unfortunately, these things happen if not careful. <br>  To help put your mind on ease, I would take a HPT (home pregnancy test) & test first thing in the morning. I know this may be hard for you & since you do have insurance, I would call and make an appointment with your OBGYN & get yourself checked out.<br>  It is important to make sure everything is OK & be tested for any STD's/diseases. <br>  I will say a prayer for you.....please take care of yourself.<br>  <br>  All the best:)|`|3fb331848975bd349a4c74bd71d9dccfaa	Are you sure you're pregnant?

fAGTOJRZaa	Your doctor knows what she's doing so call her and talk to her about it. I've been going through a root canal and they were going to prescribe me an antibiotic. My midwife said the risk of the medicine is much lower than the risk of the infection to the baby. Infections can cause birth defects so you're better off getting better and beating the infection. Your doctor is the best person to talk with about this. She approved all my medicines and she even talked with my dentist about one that she didn't approve of and they found an alternative.|`|HP1pToMOaa	That dosage seems to be the standard.

I am in the UK so maybe they treat it differently here but i have strep b and they don't treat it until you are in labour. When hey do treat it they put you on antibiotics in labour so that it isnt passed on to your baby but as far as i know there is no point in taking the penicillin now because if you are a carrier you are a carrier for life. <br>  <br>  I think you would be better asking your midwife. But for sure both times i had my babies i had the anti biotics at labour. <br>  <br>  If you look up on google strep b you will see that is what is says there too.|`|cc7a9e602a34331d1b8fc3083e410395aa	did your doc know tht u were pregnant when he gave you them? if so it should be fine if not then just phone the pharmacy for advice they will know!|`|3505983107c631451310c5009361ae76aa	if your worried about taking it call your doctor and explain your worries and they will advise you whats best to do|`|zbhGJFIPaa	i have strep b and i had nothing through out both my pregnancies i was just put on antibiotics in labour because that's when you can pass it on to the baby !! It can cause problems to your baby but i'm sure if you speak to your midwife she can clarify if you are ok to take the med prescribed. I'm sure its ok but i would check if your worried !! I wish you all the  luck in the world for you and your lil one !!|`|61wXpXVxaa	It is alot but it would be safe for you to use because the doctor would have known when prescribing it that you were pregnant, it may be alot but strep b can as well take tolls on babies health so follow his directions to a tee.

Target carries a line of toys called "Parents" and they have these really cool rubber blocks with the letters on them.  My son also loves his big plastic Tonka truck, it was only $12 at Fred Meyer.

CdJtH0xdaa	It's completely all right to feel this way. There is nothing wrong with being gay, or bisexual. What I don't think is okay is to jump to conclusions just yet, as you are a young teenager going through puberty, so you haven't found yourself yet. All teenagers go through identity crises, some like yours, and some not as personal as yours, but ALL teenagers go through an identity crisis, so you shouldn't feel ashamed if you feel this way. <br>  <br>  If you do strongly feel as though you're gay/bisexual, then you just have to tell someone close to you, such as a close friend, or even an adult figure you trust. Honestly, you shouldn't jump right into telling your parents. It's better to get it off your chest before telling your parents. <br>  <br>  Good luck to you my friend! I wish you the best of luck! =)|`|8N3PRy3Raa	wow erm well you go with what you think is best so what if ur gay nothing wrong with it you are still a human and if your not ready to open well then wait till the time is right seeing as your 13 have you tried getting to know people if you dnt think ur gay try finding some girls that r atracktive still your parents will support you even if you had one friend or if you was to skinny or too fat but they will support you because they r ur parents if you dont want to open try opening to people that are gay... still nothing wrong with it your always gone to be a normal person i use to get like this to girls when i was 13 but now i am straight and yes i do regret kissing and doing stuff with girls but i cant change it because thats the way i was...... But still you go with what you like hun<br>  I hoped this help u hun and you do what you want because your the person who controls you no one else dont let people be mean loads of people will understand<br>  I hope you do what ur heart tells you to do<br>  rock on hun<br>  xxxx|`|S7QnjI7eaa	Your only 13, your body is changing in every way, my friend had a crush on my other friend for a year( both girls) she is not 16 and has been going out with a boy for 1 and a half years don't worry about it  x|`|DiuDO1Weaa	hun your 13 it is called exploring no your not 100% gay if you still get attracteed to some girls!|`|QJf2XNaTaa	Just accept yourself. Once you've accepted that your different, it'll make others feel the same. E0mail me if you need to talk. You could be bi???|`|N2KmE3rVaa	Just come out as Bi. It will give u less bull sh*t. And u do like some girls so i think that would work out 4 u.|`|TaFrxxJXaa	you're gay.<br>  thats not a rude answer.<br>  the straight up truth.<br>  *pun ^ inteneded*|`|7XBoIgd6aa	It sounds like your bi that or just exploring either way it's fine. Good luck|`|7PFtHzchaa	you might be BIsexual.<br>  it means you like both sexes.<br>  its normal. and is greatly accepted in todays society, but there are also many people who will not accept you for it unfortunately.<br>  When you come out, come out to people who will love you no matter what sex you are.<br>  this may sound negative; but its just honesty:<br>  being such a young boy && liking other boys, you will get called names and made fun of... but if you're friends with a lot of girls, your friends will be very supportive. girls are more acceptive of gay/ bisexual people then boys are.<br>  <br>  i hope this helped you, good luck.!|`|tz5HHJouaa	You could be gay, bisexual, pansexual, or even straight. It is completely normal to have feelings for the same sex as a teenager. Maybe these feelings will go away; maybe they won't. Only time will tell. Just know that being gay is complete normal and natural.|`|chkGHzREaa	Hey since your still attracted to girls your straight. Its just when you go through puberty and begin to mature you'll experience mixed feelings. Same thing happend to me but it stopped and I'm not attracted to guys anymore. Just watch yourself and don't do it too much!|`|I9inol7aaa	i am straigth and will if u want to be gay than don't mind what people say and if you don't want to be gay than go to counsaling and get help.|`|tJoxT0EXaa	you're not gay. you're curious. <br>  <br>  quit watching porn, by the way.|`|tecPZUq2aa	You Cant Possibly Know If You Are Gay At 13.<br>  <br>  <br>  13 Is Nothing, You Don't Really Know Yourself, Explore, Take Your Time.<br>  <br>  If You Ask This Same Question In 10 Years I Would Probably Say Your Are Gay.<br>  <br>  But Not Now, No Way.<br>  <br>  Good Luck! X|`|GGH0HVdvaa	Well it sounds like you're gay, don't worry, there's nothing wrong with it.<br>  <br>  You're a little young yet to publicly declare your sexuality, usually kids wait until a little later in their teens before they come out. Whenever you feel ready is when you should do it. Best of luck to you hon. Don't ever let anyone make you feel inferior just because you're different than them.<br>  <br>  <br>  **EDIT**<br>  <br>  Packers girl, telling someone "don't be gay" is like telling a person to stop being tall. You cant change the way a person was born, and it's not weird or gross. You need to open your eyes and stop assuming that just because someone is different than you that they are gross. Grow up.|`|qv493CGiaa	My friend was exactly the same. When we were 13 he told everyone he was bi and from that day on to now 2/nearly 3 years later he still gets bullied about it. And act. regrets telling people b/c those feelings for guys have gone away. <br>  You won't act. know for sure if your gay/bi or straight until you've finished puberty, so it could just be your hormones.|`|492681182d7c9b1f14276670369e851baa	You are only 13 and you don't have to "come out" or do anything if you don't want to.  Think about it - would you expect a straight boy to suddenly announce to his parents "mum, dad.  I think about girls all the time"?<br>  <br>  Just have fun being a teenager.|`|D8gFfDwuaa	well u may not think u r 100% gay because u r only 13 years old and it's still A young age. <br>  <br>  good luck|`|jY31JaCeaa	your gay.
XTuhGaL1aa	Oh I know what you mean! My daughter is 10 months old and I still freak out when she gags and often do the finger sweep to take the food out. However, gagging is going to be all apart of her learning to eat different textures of foods. <br>  <br>  I feed my daughter Heinz baby food and the Stage 1 and 2 foods are fine but when I started her on Stage 3 she gagged because the texture and taste are so different. I gave it a rest and tried again after a week, still gagging but not as much. Usually they will gag a bit, but if she does it repeatedly, I will give it a rest and try it for another day. After trying, she is now pretty good with the Stage 3 foods.<br>  <br>  The best advice I can give you is to feed her the foods she gaggs on when someone else is there with you. I noticed I would get more nervous if I was feeding her alone. Take a infant cpr course to build your confidence in case (God forbid!) she does actually choke. For now, look it up online, print out the instructions and pictures.<br>  <br>  The difference between choking and gagging:<br>  "There is a substantial difference between choking and gagging. Many children gag as they learn to control their tongues and swallowing mechanisms. Gagging happens with alarming frequency for many children, although once a month is frequent - not once a day or week. Choking is a situation where an obstruction has entered the airway and can not be easily dislodged. Choking is life-threatening as air supply is being cut-off and knowing how to handle the situation can save your child's life as there is often no time to wait for paramedics to arrive in a severe situation."<br>  <br>  Infant CPR:<br>  <a href="http://www.babycenter.com/0_infant-first-aid-for-choking-and-cpr-an-illustrated-guide_9298.bc" rel="nofollow">http://www.babycenter.com/0_infant-first...</a>|`|ROJans2Taa	I worry about the "silent gagging" if they are making noise then generally they can breathe, if it's that silent gasping I freak, my son has yet to do it,  but my daughter a few times "choked" I had to reach in and physically remove whatever from her throat, it usually happened when she would cram to much in. best luck|`|PDHCOrOSaa	My daughter is 14 months old and I still freak out about food.  I cut it up really small and my boyfriend is a child care worker who is very trained in CPR and I took a class at the red cross to get certified but I'm scared that if she choked my memory would go blank.<br>  <br>  ANYWAY she obviously had to eat.  Just make sure you cut the food up small enough to not get lodged in her throat and plus ( and I'm sure you already know ) nothing like raisins, peanuts, and what not that they wouldn't be able to cough up on there own if it got lodged.<br>  <br>  And remember if the baby is coughing she is not choking.....and yes babies have a terrific gag reflux but it tends to send us mommies into cardiac arrest LOL.<br>  <br>  I"ll give you a list of some foods I think you should try where it would probably be okay:<br>  Banana chunks,<br>  peach chunks,<br>  cheerios,<br>  toast (small )<br>  noodles cut up.<br>  american cheese broken apart or cut up<br>  and maybe some rice?<br>  <br>  Good luck.
JbC50Xiqaa	YES! It's your baby honey! YES, enjoy it :) You may be unsure now but within a few days, you'll notice the bubbles turning into taps, then taps turning into kicks :)<br>  <br>  I just felt bubbles last week and now I'm feeling kicks, especially when I'm laying down :)<br>  <br>  Isn't it wonderful?|`|f8epBxFOaa	it was probably your baby i am 17 weeks and i can feel my baby move every time after i eat and it doesn't really feel like air bubbles to me it feels like a quick little poke from the inside.<br>  <br>  it is so special to feel your baby for the first time congratulations!|`|QoenvlFuaa	That is exactly how a good friend of mine described feeling her baby move for the first time! It's not how I described what I felt, but it's different for each person. Congrats on feeling your little one move!|`|vbwnLB8Gaa	Yes! How wonderful! I felt my 1st child move at 17 weeks!!|`|tkqV2CI5aa	It was more than likely. This one is my second and i felt him at 16 weeks. also below my belly button and if it's down that far, the doctor had told me it's more likely a boy, and when we done the ultra sound, it was! =) So if you lay on your back with your head propt up at night and put your hand on your tummy, give the baby a minute and you may feel a kick.|`|JvbvGtrBaa	yah i believe they make all kinds of a movements that feel different. <br>  i've felt the tap a few times a before as well. <br>  i went to one of those 3d sonagrams and while he was kicking she was recording and i could feel it too, now i kinda know what it feels like when kicks and turns, and changes positions...<br>  it can range from like a heavy tumble in your tummy to those taps your talking about?!<br>  i've felt mine for weeeeeeekkkkssss now. i believe i felt the first movements around 8 weeks. <br>  but my baby huge is for his developement<br>  17 weeks and 7 ounces!|`|AA10693194	yeppers! Hun I'm pretty sure that was your baby!!! I am 13 weeks with mine and I feel moving already.not strong movements of course but that's what they are! <br>  now that you know the feeling a bit. eat something one night before bed and lay on your back and you will be sure to feel baby!|`|AA12124588	Awwwww :)<br>  That popcorn you have felt will be getting busier & stronger everyday.<br>  You'll be real amazed when the lil one kicks your bladder ;)|`|3vzxSKLcaa	Yes!

Congrats :)|`|iwYu32N2aa	It was most likely the baby. I felt mine at 18-19 weeks|`|YP3rEESUaa	more than likely it was baby moving around, your right around the time when most women start feeling baby's first movements.  congrats =)

50lIaC8zaa	My daughter was like this, luckily over the past week or so she has got alot better and how only half wakes maybe once or twice for her dummy but will then go right back to sleep.<br>  <br>  I don't really know why my LO did it, i think alot of it was teething though. She use to go to bed fine then 2 hrs or so later she would wake crying and want to get up (although she was still tired) and then would refuse to go back to bed for a couple of hours. She would then keep stirring through the night, it was very tiring.<br>  <br>  The only thing i can think of other than teething is that some babies can get fussy when they are reaching a milestone and learning to do something new, i think my LO definitely gets more irritable when  shes trying to master something. Hopefully your LO will go back to sleeping through soon. xx|`|UFqacgoiaa	Yes, Ana went through the same stage and I found myself sympathizing much more with the people who complain consistent about how their children won't sleep. I still don't know why it happened but it was brief. I gave her some apple juice in a bottle, and once or twice even soft carrots and this settled her although I don't think she was hungry. Cutting down on naps as someone suggested seemed to only make the problem worse because she was crankier. Anyway, good luck and I hope this period is as brief for you as it was for me.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	Are you still trying to give her as many sleeps during the daytime as she was having when she was tiny?

I know it's not fun but once she shows you her new thing, like right now it may be cruising or even walking, it will get a lot better.

Daniel
JnLoHaoAaa	I wore decent clothes but didn't put much into my hair or make-up. After squeezing 7 pounds out of my vagina I just didn't give a hoot.|`|7c9a6ac2b60c434d81159b0728373573aa	I think my son was 3 weeks old before I put on real girl clothes. And didn't even dream of make up and hair until at least then. My son was born C-Section on December 11th and my husband tried to go out for New Years Eve. Even them It was a pony tail, jeans and a top nothing fancy.Trust me babe when are elbow deep into Poopy diapers and spit up make up hair and girl clothes are the last on your list.|`|o2YHnKXiaa	No I didn't dress up period LOL. I was so tired still and I just didn't mind who saw me looking at my worst LOL. I dressed the baby in a cute outfit though when I brought him home.|`|DLDweOcYaa	No I didn't.  Just wanted to get home!|`|281bc9a14a2a3c5832ce389a1258dda1aa	No I did not I wore a sweat suit you never know what size you stomach will be when you leave. Not everyone looks six months pregnant after birth but just in case I didn't bring any of my regular clothes but for both of my sons I was able to wear pregnancy clothes when I left the hospital. I was discharged this last time from the hospital on Thursday and we went to the mall Saturday to get the baby's picture taken and I wore a regular pair of jeans. Good Luck...oh and no I am not an ity bity person just wanted to give you the flip side since everyone gave you horror stories about how big your belly will be. It didn't happen to me and you may be a lucky one as well!! :)|`|q7sgWqZ3aa	I didn't get time to pack my hospital bag and all that because I ended up going to the ER in an emergency. Long story short, I ended up having my baby earlier then expected, way early.  When I left the hospital I left in a pair of sweatpants and one of my boyfriends shirts. My hair was up because I had a hair band around my wrist when I came in to the hospital( I was transferred to another hospital).<br>  <br>  I had no make up. I haven't been able to bring my baby girl home yet, she's still in the NICU but she's going home in a cute outfit!|`|AA10893102	If you truly want to breastfeed successfully, don't rely on "I have heard..." <br>  <br>  Get a good breastfeeding book. STUDY it, especially if you don't know anyone else who breastfed. Anyone who says that breastfeeding comes naturally is lying to you, or they have never done it. Trust me.<br>  <br>  And no, dressing up will be the last thing on your mind, trust me. I don't think I even thought about make up for about two weeks. I would recommend getting a lot of the glamourmom breastfeeding tank tops. You can get them at motherhood maternity, and they are the most convenient thing to wear while breastfeeding.|`|lnPNfdKLaa	I just wore jeans and a tee, comfy all the way! You should deffo get BIG knickers tho coz you will bleed a lot and the pads are massive lol!! TMI maybe, but they are only a step down from nappies lol!!<br>  Take a cute outfit for baby tho, i'm sure you'll be taking plenty pics!<br>  xxx<br>  good luck!|`|1SGl03Zlaa	I wore comfy maternity clothes, nothing fancy.  I did put on some makeup before I left the hospital because I knew there would be lots of visitors when I got home taking pictures so I wanted to look somewhat nice.|`|AA11784984	The best thing to do is bring comfortable clothes to go home in. You can be pretty sore after birth.|`|2AHH3F2caa	when i left the hospital iwas in PJ's.... if they woulda let me i would went home in a johnny shirt...... lol|`|heDtLdz5aa	nope..not at all...i dressed the baby in a cute outfit though..a cute sleeper..brought him home on halloween..|`|3I3Thz6waa	I put on something pretty but comfortable. I needed to feel good about myself. I wore my favorite maternity outfit. Given it was loose on me at that point, but that's what made it comfortable.<br>  As for the hair and makeup, yes, I did my hair and makeup almost every day in the hospital (after I was allowed to move, I had a c-section and for the first day was bed ridden) I did it for myself, because it made me feel better and helped my spirits thus helped me recover. I know a lot of other people wouldn't bother, it just depends on what makes you feel good about yourself. I have very long  curly hair (it's down to the middle of my back) and I feel miserable if my hair is frizzy or looks bad, it makes me feel bad about myself. So I always make sure my hair looks good because it effects my mood so much!|`|ay8tXLD2aa	Oh good heavens no!  You'll still look 6 months pregnant, so you'll go home in maternity clothes. You will be exhausted, have more than enough to do, and it will be weeks before you manage to shower, get dressed nicely, do your hair and your makeup ALL in the same day!|`|2lpDlLLsaa	I didn't dress up,I just made sure to be comfy. I did dress my baby up though. He looked adorable, all the nurses came out too see him and say goodbye. Your plan sounds like a good one, just don't forget earrings and lipstick/gloss, they go a long way.|`|UMpJHr4Raa	of course not! i was in pjs. that is a day where you are just ready to get out of there and go home.|`|xarKlp0Oaa	I didn't get dressed up and you probably won't either because there will be too much going on.|`|8oAlBL91aa	I didn't dress up I just wore (this sucks...) maternity jeans home and a sweater. I did shower and dry my hair and put on a little makeup since I knew we would be doing pictures and I didn't want to look like a bumb. But honestly you won't even care when it comes down to it you'll just be so concerned with getting home.|`|SjX72fPyaa	I wore pajama pants and a tank top and put my hair into a ponytail lol
CdJtH0xdaa	No, you're not being a bad daughter. You have a plan for the future, and you have a right to go to college. Best of luck to you.|`|QDC5Q64Taa	i agree with you completely. i wouldn't want to give up my life either. and he should realize that your chances at the future you want would change drastically if he made you move.|`|aDQgLEbuaa	No you're not a bad daughter.  It's your time now, you're a young adult and it's time to start making your own life.  I don't think you're doing anything wrong.|`|QJf2XNaTaa	There are some good schools in India i'm sure, and your grandmother needs your family. Blood is thicker than water, and even though you may feel this way now, how will you feel when she is actually dead...|`|g7wQij2Oaa	you're not a bad daughter at all for doing that.<br>  just go visit a few times. they can't expect you to move your whole life. your grandma should understand.<br>  <br>  :)|`|3ERx4opSaa	well you should at least visit her once or twice before she passes on, but your still not doing anything wrong.|`|ls8KNu9uaa	I understand where this is going through.<br>  <br>  Ask yourself, what are your biggest priorities in life. What would matter most to you? <br>  <br>  It wouldn't make you a bad or good daughter in any decision that you would make. For as long as, you have to help your family understand why that is your decision.<br>  <br>  Conflicts may arise, but just remember your goal. <br>  <br>  Help your family understand how important the decision is for you.|`|LQ7rROMSaa	No, you are not a bad daughter. Your parents can't expect you to drop everything and leave. I know your grandmother is dying, and I am very sorry for that, but you still need to live your own life. Talk to your parents about it; they should understand. But you should promise to visit them in India and call them to see how everything is going.|`|4nZZbrKgaa	no your not a bad daughter. this is your life so you need to do what you want to so you can have a good life. plus if you make a mistake thats just part of life. biggest suggestion is dont regret whatever you choose!!! Good luck.|`|YipD1QKFaa	I don't think you're a bad daughter for feeling conflicted over this, at all.  It's totally understandable.<br>  <br>  Sit down with your parents and explain how much you love your grandmother, but also how you feel about leaving your home, and your school.<br>  <br>  Maybe you could work something out where you spend your summers in India with your family, and the school year back in the states.<br>  <br>  I know it seems horrible right now to have to uproot and move across the world, but it may not be the worst thing ever to have to move, if it comes down to that.  There are great schools in India, you'd be exposed to a different culture, and you'd get to connect with your roots.  I can also imagine that colleges would look just as highly on someone who lived in a foreign country for four years and they would someone who went to a top prep school.  <br>  <br>  That may not be what you want to hear, and I'm sorry.<br>  <br>  I really suggest sitting down with your parents and being completely honest.  You never know what you may be able to work out.
AA11784984	I would let a 13 year old sit for my kids as long and I knew she was responsible. Maybe stay with her the first few times she sat with my kids. <br>  She could try that or maybe there is a mom who lives nearby that just needs some extra help around the house. <br>  She could help out with the the elderly people in her neighborhood.<br>  She could try selling some old things (clothes and such) on ebay or craigslist too.|`|FVPOxaeJaa	Umm....I would trust teens to babysit my kids. They invite people over to your house and they talk on the phone.|`|Cz6DDI6laa	im not a mom but im 13 and i babysit and everything <br>  <br>  also if u have a small store she could stack the shelves <br>  something like that<br>  <br>  odd jobs|`|bWmOaK33aa	Babysitting is ok for a 13 year old if the kid is no younger than four I think.
AA10976951	I was living by myself at your age and had been babysitting other kids since I was 10...but I didn't have the best mother either...at your age though I would let you stay home by yourself so long as I trusted you.|`|c26378b0778c0dc5452f0b109171dba5aa	as long as you know the do's and don'ts should not be a problem. But in today's world I can't blame them, anything can happen with no notice. So be nice and stay with Nan tonight. It could be a life saver.|`|e8yt5PrGaa	if you have proven to be responsible and you have someone to check up on you and to contact in emergencies yes ..<br>  <br>  i would also caution you that if you are tempted to get up to mis chief while we are gone and that you will pay dearly but if you behave then alright we would allow it|`|f2ZNJy48aa	Well, it's whatever you feel comfortable with. If you think you might get lonely, or, well, a little scared, go to your brother's house or sleepover at a friend's house, or even invite a friend to sleepover at your house if that's okay with your parents. Everybody is ready to stay home by themselves at different times and ages. If you do stay by yourself and you don't want to go to sleep, watch a movie. Make sure it's not a scary movie. Watch a nice, happy movie. Good luck!|`|5pSieqQbaa	wat a baby u should be happy that ur parents actually care about you. anyways ya ur old enough but there is the question of responsibility and maturity level that adds up. u never know wat a teen can do when their parents aren't home.|`|a1uoxczTaa	if you are trustworthy and responsibly enough, then it should be ok.|`|Bb9k6XI1aa	yes,if you are responseable.|`|ndO6MiQaaa	in this day and age no one should b on there own its to dangrous its safer bin wit someone|`|nC9EqWvuaa	If you arent scared or something FER SURE! I know how you feel I'm 14 and my family wont let me stay home alone. Heck, 12 year olds stay home alone. I think its unfair. Ya you should be able to but if your parents wont let you theres not much you can do about it. I'm goin' through the same thing and I hate it, I think i should be but some people are jus to old fashioned or close minded. My families excuse is they would never forgive themselves if something happened to me bla bla bla but people rarely show up at our place and come on where are the vampires at. People over react. Keep fighting for it, I'll be.
oVwGit7qaa	personally, i think the truth. Yes, sometimes you dont want to get hurt, but lying can always back fire on your. It mainly depends on the lie or truth. If you personally, thought that someone isnt that pretty, you dont just go up to her and say i dont think you are pretty etc. You would only say something if she asks and says, "How do i look" you dont say ugly, because personally that is the meanest thing to say, you say "i love that dress or whatever, just compliment her on her clothes or whatever, dont lie exactly but dont be blunt and rude. But most other reasons, honesty is the best policy, because eventually that person will thank you for being honest, where as if you lie, that person could be very mad at you, and you could lose your best friend.|`|ud0gPY3baa	I think the truth is better too. Because eventually, after it hurts, the person will stop crying (or being sad), and when you lie you will feel regret and it will be like living a lie. So when the person finds out you lied it not only hurts the other sperson, but it hurts you. So I agree with you. ( :<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!|`|R4WX5twzaa	I would rather be unhappy about knowing the truth than be happy about being kept in the dark. Honesty is the best policy.|`|H90uflbFaa	a lie that draws a smile|`|jY31JaCeaa	a lie|`|sKTmxnx1aa	I prefer that people don't lie.

e1ae2fbad2e2e19da95432269bb0ccd0aa	Yeah its pretty much the same way at my house.  My husband will take them out of the house with messy faces and non matching clothes.  I don't understand how hard it is to put them in matching clothes or dress them for the weather.  I have to say that guys are pretty much raised to use the excuse that they are just guys and that's why they do what they do.  My husband knows that he cant use that excuse in our house; however, I have learned to not be so uptight about certain things.  I've learned that one morning of the kids having cake for breakfast isn't going to hurt them, or if my husband lets our 3 year old dress himself and he looks ridiculous, its ok.. While my husband can irritate the heck out of me when it comes to our kids, he has taught me to relax more and just let them be kids and not be so uptight about certain things.|`|1s3nddaYaa	my  b.f plays he doesn't know what he is doing card. i cant stand it.|`|3dSCbIcEaa	I like this question bc i have asjed myself the same thing since becoming a mother.  Once my ex was outside in the yard at about 9:00 on a cold winter night, taking the battery out of our sons powerwheel.  He left the door wide open, our son barefoot.  I was sick as death, and layed up in bed.  I got up to check on our son and he was outside, barefoot, in the cold. I SCREAMED at my ex. He was like "im sorry, i dont know the things u know."  Just like that.  Isnt it common sense? IDK  <br>  Another example is our 2 yr olds sleeping schedule- I got him on a perfect routine at about 5months.  Bath, book, bed.  He would go to sleep fine, and sleep fine all night. When our daughter was born my husband took over the night routine so i could focus on the newborn.  He turned it into no bath, no book, and falling asleep on the couch watching tv.  Now our son refuses to sleep in his room and i dont know what to do.<br>  You need to be careful when allowing your hubby to help.  Sometimes its easier to do it on your own.  Good Luck!|`|m2aznd8xaa	my husband is great with the kids he does cook decent meals for them if he has too.he does dress them funny and cant fix there hair .i have two girls. but other than that he does know what he is doing. he takes them out if i need a break.etc. he is a great dad to his girls.  men sometimes dont use there commen sense it true. but its a proven fact men only use half of there brain and women use both but i still dont think that is an excuse. my husband put himself in my kids shoes when he is in charge. somtimes i do have to remind him to take snacks for them or sweaters but other than that he knows his stuff.|`|4CMx1uzXaa	That is no excuse. Men just dont see the importance of such things e.g. healthy diet etc. They never want to face reality somehow. <br>  <br>  I grew up without a dad and I turnt out great.|`|1VdgsZPoaa	My husband never plays the "dad doesn't know what he's doing" card.  Mostly because I lay things out for him.  My husband knows that kids don't eat crap from breakfast and that you shouldn't send your daughter out in a skirt when it's cold.<br>  <br>  I think that he needs someone to show him the ropes.  Cause, it's not just lacking in common sense, it is completely silly.  Specially since it is his own daughter.|`|8SOjngS0aa	People are always blaming the dads for being 'stupid'. It has nothing to do with gender, everyone makes bad decisions. Your husband just isn't the brightest crayon in the box when it comes to taking care of kids. My dad is amazing, he's the best dad in the world I think, it's nothing to do with 'fathers' in general. Besides, I don't see anything wrong with an occasional pudding cup for breakfast, as long as it doesn't become a habit :)|`|EtTddxAqaa	well I have 3 kids and have been married 10 years to an awesome guy. He doesnt do a lot with or for the kids though.<br>  <br>  He usually always makes me get up and feed them, give them baths, Brush their hair, take them to appointments and get them from and go to school. I thought well he is a dad let him do what he wants but a few weeks ago the trash was not put out and I said "why is the trash still in the house, garbage day was yesterday?" he says this';<br>  "I am the dad you are the mom you do it"<br>  I was so furious, I went off on him. <br>  <br>  I am sorry I cannot help with your husband because I need help with my own, I completely agree with you though that they should not use that line; we could totally use the line;<br>  "I am the mom I am the one who gave birth to the kids I shoudnt have to do all the crap" But we don't use that line becuase we have more comman sense right? wrong, guys have comman sense they just dont know how to use it correctly like we do. (:<br>  we always constantly do things for our kids while the men sit back and we should go on strike haha just kidding. <br>  <br>  I dont know what men are thinking sometimes with the whole "lets eat raw crap and get the kids sick" what the heck is going on. ):<br>  Raw is so disgusting...I cannot believe men can think that is healthy, I am the same way as you. I would have been so mad and you responded just fine. (:<br>  good job and keep me posted.|`|I2iXz32paa	Doesn't sound like a lack of common sense as much as a difference in opinion on how a child should be raised.<br>  <br>  But I agree, guys use the "Hey I'm a man/dad/guy" excuse to get away with a lot of stuff with kids but some of it isn't so bad. Sometimes it's really helpful to kids to know that there is someone to turn to who isn't serious, who it's okay to be a kid around and not worry about getting in trouble.<br>  <br>  Kids need the protection of responsible adults too, they need to have that guardian to watch over them because sometimes kids to really stupid things or just can't make the informed choice.<br>  <br>  As far as the pie dough eating goes, just remind her that eating pie dough isn't good for you and tell her to remember when she felt sick next time she wants to eat something like that. Learning by trying is a pretty good way to get the point across.<br>  <br>  Its good for kids to have some time to goof off, days where they have miss-matched clothing, messy hair, where they can climb trees and be sticky. Kids that don't get to be so stuck up and boring, they get to be adults who don't know how to have fun unless it involves drugs or socially manipulating people. Nothing is better for self confidence than knowing that appearance doesn't really matter that much.<br>  <br>  So let her dad be a goof from time to time, she'll have someone she can do some less structured things around and still have you as the reliable parent. This of course means that you might end up as the "Bad guy" or evil step-mom when she hits her teen years but you'll likely just have to make dear old dad stand with you during the hard times.<br>  <br>  As a different note, that's kinda hillarious...pie dough and pudding beats my uncle's bowl of cereal (Which he'd share with me): a mixing bowl of cereal with a ladle for a spoon.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|SRsFkNBBaa	i am in almost the position you are in-my stepson is 13, and i am "virtually" the only mother figure. i don't think it is reserved for only dads, mothers can be that way also. that is actually the reason i am virtually the only mother my stepson has. his mother is a "friend" not a mother. she has no common sense. will send him home in 10 below zero with a t-shirt, will oversleep on a schoolday, if we go out of the norm and allow him to stay over night, he will arrive late. thinks a bag of cheetos and a mountain dew is a good choice for dinner.<br>  men & women are different in every way anyway-the guys usually pay more attention to the "fun, physical side of things. whereas usually we women tend to think of the emotional side, and the protectors as far as health & comfort. thats the way it has always been, and always will be.<br>  when i was in the situation you have just been through, i ignore it. it will not hurt the child, to not be fed properly for breakfast or sleep with tangled hair. its what they were talking about and doing while these things were "not-occuring" that is important. the time spent to gether and the talks that ensued.-|`|tht0DrHsaa	I am very lucky my husband is very good about that stuff.  Some men play that card just so they don't have to do it.  One thing that you can do is make sure you tell him what to feed her.  Also lay her clothes out the night before so he knows what to put on her.  Little things like that. That is what I do for my husband it just makes it easier for me and him.  Then I don't have to worry about it.|`|zqfs7A6Caa	I thought this was going to be a question for fathers about how they raise their children. Well, I am a father and although my wife has to do the majority of the child-rearing (she is a stay-at-home mom), from day one I have taken as active a role as possible in raising our son.<br>  <br>  I I have seen fathers on television (AFV) trying to change diapers or feed the baby. I don't find it funny, it is actually quite sad. I can understand a stepfather who has never had a child of his own being a bit clumsy in the beginning. However, being a novice at child rearing is no excuse for not learning how to raise a happy healthy child.<br>  <br>  Anyone capable of changing the tire on a car can learn to change the diaper on a baby. Anyone who can remember to put on a jacket on himself when it is chilly outside can also remember to make a child put on a coat (and pants) when it is cold. <br>  <br>  If a man cannot remember to brush his daughters hair, how does he remember to do the things required for his occupation? The job of being a father should be the most important job in his life. Earning a salary to provide a roof over her head is part of that, but so is making sure she is getting adequate nutrition. Your six-year old probably knew that pie dough was not a healthy breakfast. Most adults would have known about the slight risk from consuming raw egg products, and not fed that to a child. <br>  <br>  "I'm a Dad" is no excuse. Dads can/should be caring parents too.|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	An occasional unhealthy meal or forgotten hair care doesn't mean that he lacks common sense, it just means that he's more relaxed about things than you are.  Same goes for letting a child choose their own clothes & learn from their own mistakes sometimes.  It's just a different approach to parenting.  <br>  <br>  I think that *he* might think that he does things like this because he is a man and, in his experience, men tend to parent like that, in a more relaxed way.  In fact, if his daily exposure to 'how women parent' has mainly been 'how you parent' for the past two years, and he sees himself parenting differently, he might logically draw the conclusion that this is a gender based difference.  <br>  <br>  It isn't, though.  I let the kids make clothing/coat/dressing for the weather mistakes, too.  I also let them eat junk sometimes.  And, we never brush hair before bed (why?  it just gets messy while they sleep...).  <br>  <br>  It's a difference in parenting styles and it sounds like you both could learn a little bit from each other.  And, like you both need to take the time to understand each other's parenting style & goals and develop respect for each other as parents.  Your future parenting years will be much more enriching for your relationship and much more productive for the children if you can do this.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	Thank you Maureen.
CTmWS6dMaa	I like it. It's a good name. Classic and wholesome.|`|qj6pv3fUaa	One of my best friends is called Thomas and then my cousin and uncle are also called Thomas.

I was taking my dog for a walk when I was 17, I was born a girl and am a woman, I may be 6' tall with perhaps a characteture shape of what a woman should look like, but I am by no means manly.<br>  <br>  "You're too fat to f***!" I was chubby and not fat then, I was 16, he was drunk downtown in the middle of the day, a$$hole.<br>  <br>  Or my least favorite from a roommate of mine "You're too fat to even bend over and reach the floor!"   Well, I have news for you, you hairy ankled Sasquatched legged pea brain, you are too messed up to ever have a fulfilling relationship with anyone let alone find peace if you think it's okay to talk to me like that.<br>  <br>  During those times I was pretty near my ideal weight, for a long time it made me feel pretty bad and like perhaps I was obese - and being young and naive it influenced how I ate so that it contributed to my present obesity (100+ over).   But, if I had a little confidence that I was just fine and they were the ones with a problem it would have not been any big deal, I know now that they were messed up, not me - still it made me doubt myself.

2B2fgmw9aa	Your baby will continue to move around doing flips ion your belly for the next couple months, so I wouldn't be worried about it being breech. As for it kicking in your lower abdomen, that is totally normal! Just wait until it starts tap dancing on your bladder and you think you have to pee every 2 seconds!!!

CdJtH0xdaa	That's terrible! I am sorry that this has happened to your friend, and I'm sorry you have to deal with this situation!<br>  You need to keep pestering the police, because they have to do something. Even if it is "another teen runaway", they can't just shrug it off, because that "teen runaway" could get injured, raped, killed, and so on. That's ridiculous! Some police force your town has.<br>  Anyway, there really is nothing you and your friend can do but CONSTANTLY pester the police, because they're being ridiculous right now. Keep sending texts, and every time you receive a text from the missing friend, you NEED to bring it to the police.<br>  In the meantime, you need to just wait. There really is nothing else you can do. Does your friend usually walk her dogs in one place? If so, you could try to find her through there, but if she doesn't walk her dogs in one place, it's tough. You really have to just wait it out.<br>  I wish you the best of luck with this, and I hope your friend is returned and safe and sound. Good luck! =)|`|VlmRTuhgaa	Walk right into the police department and start a temper-tantrum! Yell at them with your life if they don't do something you're going to sue their asses so hard.

(:<br>  <br>  Yasmine <3|`|7p9qgkSFaa	Yeah, I think that is a little creepy. You should ask your sister if she is really ready for the blessing of marriage. You have the right to be creeped out, this guy was your teacher and now he is going to be family! Have you seen the movie Mr. Woodcock? That is exactly what this is about. Same situation. Well, I do hope you feel more comfortable with it soon because if they don't break up then you are stuck with him.|`|QJf2XNaTaa	Your somewhat right for being weirded out. My dad is a teacher, and I used to go to a school he taught at...

m2aznd8xaa	well seems like yur in a tough spot kid. all you can do is prove everyone wrong. good for you onwanting to attend college and your right when your gone you will be missed.  just hang in there and move out when you get the chance. i went through to same thing growing up. i grew up with brothers they stayed out all night smoked pot,snuck girls in there rooms and in the morning i got in trouble for all the messes they left out from the night before. i was 17 not allowed to got out. only sit out front. not allowed to do anything at all. so at 19 i moved out. im now 30 married 10 years with two girls who i have a very open relationship with i teat them equal and just tell them that there best is good enough for me. they are my world. so just know all this will only make you a better person in the long run and just stay in school make thast money. i have a great relationship with my family now that i dont live with them anymore.  good luck to you hun.|`|8VotkEXHaa	that really sucks.  The good news is that your almost at the age to move out.  :) I don't really know what else to say other that I feel so sorry for you.  Is there no way you can sit your mom down and have a nice calm talk?|`|NDpO8hX4aa	ur parents know ur sister is the one who is the evil one but i think they r trying to do something im not sure, but in my case as a mother. i get very frustrated with my 13yr old because her 7 yr old sister is a terror and i blame the older sister because the young one acts like that because the older sister doesnt play with her or do anything with her but push her away, so the younger sister makes messes brakes her things colors on her stuff brakes her jewely, anything she can do to piss her older sister off.. the younger sister only does this to get the older sisters attention. i get pissed and blame things on my older daughter because she will not be nice or interact with her little sister.  so my suggestion to u is to go about things in a different matter--- invite ur sister to go somewhere, paint nails together,, play a game make an effort to do somethig together daily, when she is around dont push her away invite her eventualy she will get bored and stop being evil and do her own thing...trust me this will work aqnd ur parents will be off ur ***.  do everything the opposite of what u have been doing, even give ur sis compliments.|`|b6EyFLgUaa	Im so sorry. I know a little of what your going through. My sister was spoiled rotten growing up, and she still is. Really there isnt a whole lot you can do. I know that sounds unfair but it is. Id stop cleaning for your sister, if you baby sit her, dont do that either shes 12 she can be home alone. Distance yourself from the situation. It wont be easy but you will be 18 in a year and then you can move out. If your close with your dad maybe see if he would allow you to move out ( i dont know if you have a job or could afford that). If your parents are abusive towards you call the police so its in record.<br>  <br>  EDIT-Your parents will miss you and that's a good thing. Maybe get some college applications to place you do want to go that are out of the state or country ( just so you know if you live in USA college will be more expensive out of your home state) Show them your serious about leaving and give them the proof. I agree on the part time job or extra activities. Do you have a car or a license. If not is there public transportation where you live?|`|wiAVa1H5aa	She's your sister and she's that age, you are only responsible for your own actions - so if you retaliate you are going to pay for that.   Just stay neutral, little sisters usually are so enthralled by older sibs they are either after them in a mean way or after them in a adoring worshipful manner.   Just think, you'll be out of there soon and her behavior will be very obvious to everyone.|`|Yn6pM2Xyaa	well two things about this... one is you are 17 thankfully and soon will be going on to college or moving out and starting your own life that there is a end date that is in sight and that should help on those crumby days when your sister is not being very nice... second thing, maybe its time to ask to have a private chat with your mother at a time when you are not in trouble and just talk to her about how you feel and how you would like your mom to help you have a more peaceful life in the home.  you can't make your parents treat your sister a certain way, like to stop letting her get away with things but you can ask them to make sure that you have a more enjoyable time in the family home instead of being verbally assaulted by your sister.  its a tough situation because there might be a lot more going on behind closed doors than you know about that factor into the situation but its worth a shot to talk to them, it really doesnt sound like it could get worse.<br>  <br>  Edit: saw your update on talking to parents.. meh!  sorry.  another thought is that perhaps you need to find constructive things to do outside of the home to get away from the situation and help you feel like you have a fulfilling life.  perhaps a part time job or maybe join a club for sports or hobbies or find a personal interest like photography or such that you can turn to when your sister is sucking.

It will be ok... and if you cant manage it then maybe do adoption but i think you will love your child.<br>  <br>  i am sorry... it must be really hard and your not a bad person.|`|yqs1g1liaa	tough call.<br>  <br>  Maybe once it's born you'll feel differently. You might even develop a love for the baby.You have to respect the fact that your wife has been carrying this baby for 6 months- and of course she's not gonna just want to give a baby up thats shes developed a loved for.<br>  <br>  just accept it. then again, im 16- what would i know!?|`|HtXYyZPqaa	If you're going by the test to show birth defects. The one for down syndrome is normally incorrect. Unless your wife has seen a perinatologist to confirm your baby has d/s characteristics then don't worry. EVERY BABY IS A BLESSING SO, STOP BEING SO DAMN SHALLOW.|`|4s1PX9cmaa	they are people too. and while that might be cliche, its true. just because they think differently than you doesn't mean that  they aren't just as smart.<br>  <br>  and personally, your wife should leave you. because obviously she is WAY too good for you.|`|2lpDlLLsaa	What you need to do is stop being so selfish and love your child.|`|pvjEOGtOaa	wow u sound like a soon to be horrible father no matter what.|`|72e6eb5b57ed9d0fb87b09c2df0e05c5aa	You may be in a sort of shock and are probably not thinking straight. Ask your wife's doctor or your own doctor for some referral to speak to a counselor to come to grips with this.  I would speak to another doctor, her doctor seems to have an old fashioned look on Downs syndrome. Do you really want him to be put up for adoption, what if no one wants him and then he lives his life in the orphanage or going out to foster homes to people who might not take good care of him or abuse him. There are good people in foster care but what if he falls into the wrong hands.  You need to speak to someone- doctor, priest, or some other counselor. Good luck, to all three of you!|`|uajL2TPbaa	WOW I cant believe people these days. I have a child that just turned 9 years old that is mentally retarted as the dr say, but he is an angle is my eyes. There is nothing wrong with having a child with devolpmental disorders. My theory is GOD sent him here with a purpose. I am not saying it is easy raising him because it is difinately not! For 2 years or better my family and I had to learn "his" language and gestures. We have been to Dr after Dr that has said there is nothing we can do for him. But everyday he surpises us with new things. I have faught the school systems locally for my child. I think God everyday for my child because so many times we have been told you wont have him another 6-9 months, I quit taking him to this dr. Just pray about the situation, God has a purpose for everything He does. I wish you the best please contact me if I can be of any help God bless you and your family
KPYQwyeraa	being pregnant can cause that to happen however you didnt mention if you already have  children and why that's relevant to the question is because woman in some cases myself included lactate long after they give birth for example i gave birth to my daughter 8 years ago in july and i still lactate <br>  ~cat|`|ObngKaoWaa	its normal.i have two kids and didnt have much milk both times but even now when my older is 6 and younger is 3,i still have milk.|`|Jy9KORHDaa	Did you just have a baby? I wouldn't worry too much because it is natural for a woman's body to produce milk, every time you leak your body may be making more milk>|`|cadaf08b5e2b5ca7fea1ef6cb7035c53aa	Unless you are pregnant, or have recently delivered, you should see your doctor about anything coming out of your breasts.|`|dISHCaqhaa	That is normal if you have child already.|`|EDUjPIKUaa	usually it means that your pregnant.|`|e0c6e0a09a1614011f0e8e8993ccd1b2aa	If u already have child thats normal|`|bHQpwVlXaa	Your pregnant :) :D
5axGfFofaa	I had seen your responses on other questions (about monitor) and I knew we had a similar cycle.  I was hoping you got a BFP this weekend!!!  Well, I am sorry AF is hear and as hurtful as ever.  I think you should BD on every high and every peak day.  This is what we did in Dec when I got pregnant ( unfortunate m/c # 2).  This month, we BD on last high and 1st peak day and I did get a BFP this week (not trusting it until the first 13 weeks are over)  It will happen for you soon...the monitor brochure says if it does not happen in 6 months consult and MD (if you used monitor accurately every month) so be rest assured knowing it does increase your odds.  I would tell you to relax...but I know how pointless that is to hear!!  You sound like a very kind person and you will be a great mommy one day.   Best wishes and lots of prayers for you.|`|H0gcoMkGaa	you seem 2 be doin everthing right ,maybe u & ur hubby need 2 just relax!!!!|`|2X7NVUb9aa	Wow...I could have written this!  My husband and I are in the exact same situation!  We've been married and ttc for a year and a half as well.  Both been in for numerous tests and everything keeps coming back fine, which is great...but then what's the hold up?!  Every month when my AF arrives it just breaks my heart.  I try to stay positive and hopeful all month then come crashing down when I get AF.  It's such a crazy rollercoaster!!  <br>  <br>  And I totally agree!  I feel like everyone around me is either pregnant or giving birth.  And we started trying BEFORE them!  Of course I'm happy for everyone and only wish them the best...but I can't help but feel like "why not me?"  <br>  <br>  Some things we've tried so far:<br>  * clomid for three months but nothing happened except I had some crazy hot flashes!  <br>  * progesterone cream for 3 months which tended to delay my AF which got me all excited...<br>  * charting my temp (your temp increases after you ovulate) but I didn't see any change over 2 months<br>  * paying closer attention to my CM.  There is definitely a couple days where the CM looks like egg white and from what I read this is the best sperm carrier.  If you chart your CM for a few months your best bet is to try to hit the day before it arrives, wait 2 days, and try again.<br>  * and I do opk's every month to see what my peak fertile day is.<br>  <br>  I wish all the best to you!  If you'd like to email more just send me a note.  Baby dust to you!!|`|IOsrDhrJaa	Okay, you answered my very first question on yahoo and I didnt think I would be able to answer any of yours...so now I am happy I can help.<br>  <br>  My very good friends Samantha and her fiance have a three month old and were TTC for ONE FRICKEN MONTH!!!! They had sex every day three times a day for 30 days.<br>  <br>  YEAH. I know it is a lot but if they can do it you can too. They both smoke pot so...Im guessing you are really healthy. Also, try to keep romance it the sex, when you are having sex just to have a baby, it puts extra stress on both of you and somehow prolongs the process. Used to happen every time when I wasnt TTC and I was LOOKING FORWARD to having my period.<br>  <br>  BABY DUST BABY DUST BABY DUST BABY DUST BABY DUST!!!!! *!*!*!*!0*!*!*!*!*0*!*!*!|`|NWv9hOFYaa	How about BD every other day. That's what I plan to do this month.<br>  Good luck|`|Y2WMKpHjaa	Thanks and i would suggest to BD a few days before the high through a few days after your peak till it says low on the Monitor. <br>  <br>  I think that you are just getting the right timing down yet dear, that may be the problem. <br>  <br>  just think you always have this month to fix your timing. <br>  <br>  sorry that AF has showed up =( <br>  <br>  i know how hard it can be, <br>  <br>  I would also just keep the progesterone in check after you ovulate and get it checked and if you need to go and get some suppositories and see if that helps with that. <br>  <br>  my mom did that cause she was having progesterone problems and she carried my brother full term and he just turned 16 in january of this year. <br>  <br>  granted my mom had a total of 6 miscarriages and four live births. <br>  <br>  i wish you and your hubby the best of luck and baby dust to you !
jPxkg7vKaa	Are you doubling your medication on your own, without the Doctor's advice? Because that in itself is dangerous. Too much Synthroid can make you tachycardic (rapid pulse/bounding heartbeat). <br>  <br>  Uncontrolled hypothyroidism is more likely to produce birth defects in an unborn child than controlled hypothyroidism. If you and your doctor have a plan on how to treat your condition and are putting it in to action, your child is less likely to be born with the defect. <br>  <br>  Don't believe everything you read, especially if it's on the internet. Doctors have long discredited information found on the web because of the unnecessary panic it creates and because of the large amount of people self-diagnosing and self-treating symptoms and "conditions" they don't really have. <br>  <br>  I'd talk to your doctor about your long term plans for treating this problem and maintaining a healthy lifestyle during your pregnancy. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|wiAVa1H5aa	Next time you are pregnant you need to get checked as soon as you get pregnant, actually increase your synthroid dose before pregnancy.   Becuase you do not have a functioning thyroid gland any pregnancy you have is considered high risk and should be monitored as soon as you are pregnant.<br>  <br>  As for this pregnancy, you had normal T3/T4 levels before you were pregnant, your TSH levels were low I assume (high means not enough thyroid hormone), that means you had subclinical hypothyroidism for a little bit of time and it's unlikely the T3/T4 levels were low for long.  The doc may be basing the response on TSH levels, which can indicate a problem but not necessarily.   Subclinical hypothyroidism is associated with a IQ lowering of 4 points, the same amount you can stand to gain by nursing.   In the future plan your pregnancies with a high risk pregnancy specialist.|`|2b89bf97bd46e907e67742dba26abd5daa	I have severe hypothyroid, it's not that bad, you can have worse things, like when you had cancer, they are just going to up your synthroid, I'm at 88mcg, and I know they are going to up me again, I've never heard anything about it causing low IQ, I'm 14 weeks pregnant and I haven't had any problems I'm not high risk at all don't worry just follow doctors orders, good luck and have a happy healthy pregnancy!!
umca7pwoaa	This is happening to me right now, i'm at the end of my second trimester. I just started using one of those Neutragena Acne Facial Bars. I haven't used it long enough to know if it's going to work...it's aggravating and I wish I had something proven I could tell you.|`|an8O7r4kaa	i feel your pain my face is horrible too and im about as far along. lol all you can do is pray that these months go by fast.|`|AA10458750	Just another wonderful side effect of pregnancy....and men wonder why we're so irritable. Truth be told, your skin will be a mess throoughout the whole thing....but....they don't recommend salicyic acid( it's in the aspirin family) but you can use benzoyl peroxide. There is some people who say don't use Pro-Active etc...but a regualr benzoyl peroxide cleanser is fine & Dr. approved. You can buy the equate brand at wal-mart for super cheap and it really helps! Also, mashing a banana & honey plus a dash of milk and using as a face mask 1x a week help soften up your skin and heal it faster.|`|3505983107c631451310c5009361ae76aa	i got really bad acne at the start but that's due to our hormones going mad. its finally started to clear up and im 24 weeks now. i just started to user a cleanser toner and moisturiser every day which helped a bit. other than that there isn't much you can do. its only acne don't let it ruin your life. i still went to work every day and got on with things like normal. no point been miserable from some spots. hope you feel ok soon and congrats on your pregnancy|`|mxWlNykzaa	your ugly and you feel ugly during the biggining .. my boses used to say ... i thought pregnant women were soo beautiful how come your not ? lol it was horrible but in the middle you become more confident .. and you get soo cute i swear i made them change there mind .. they wanted there wives to be pregnant i dunno how it works but its does .. you get soo shiny and soft and just fulll lol <br>  dont worry about it now . just think of whats ahead lol goood luck sweety it will get better|`|aAYjs8Bxaa	Acne is common during pregnancy, cause of the hormones, but I dont think it should be so severe. Talk to your OB about your options.|`|nZVTHKNwaa	I had beautiful skin with my first pregnancy, but now with my second I feel like I'm in high school again! I'm also really breaking out around my mouth and chin area and occasionally I'll get a surprise on my cheeks. Isn't it just wonderful? I know it can be embarassing, but what you don't want to do is clog your skin pores up with makeup that it only makes it worse. Also, there are certain restrictions pregnant women should be aware of when using face cleansers. I would check with your doctor to see which face cleanser he recommends is the safest and go from there. Just realize that this is such a small price you have to pay for the baby shortly coming into your life! Best of luck!|`|sRKsQEr1aa	Awwww that happens to everyone when they are prego i think prego people r soo cute -no homo- even if there face breaks out hon haha its natural and happens to everyone.

Can I have a ride to work? Thanks...|`|28QPS6V9aa	I think for a man to be willing to stay home with his kids says a lot about his character. It says he's a good father with a big heart and he doesn't let his pride get in his way. Not many men have the patience to be a stay at home dad. You sound like you have a good guy.|`|H0fXySX9aa	i think its great that a dad can be a stay at home dad<br>  most women stay at home instead of men but men are just as capable of looking after kids as us women|`|O5KOwhovaa	If it works for them, then great.|`|IEbAHp0gaa	I am totally for dads staying at home and taking care of their kids, why not.<br>  <br>  In your circumstances it makes sense for you to go and be the bread winner and for him to stay at home and take care of the child, I mean you will have to take out time and be with your kid too but you will manage that you're strong person.<br>  <br>  If I was in his shoes myself, I would do the same, what's the point in having your male ego come in the way and stop things, you make moe money than him, it's a sensible choice both of you have made.<br>  <br>  Plus you are right, leaving your kid at a day care centre is worse than having the dad take care himself.<br>  <br>  Good luck with the baby, all the best.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	As a teen and 20-something my vision was my husband would stay at home and I'd have the career.  I think he neither should be commended or condemned, it's the same thing that moms across the world do and sometimes dad should be the one to stay home.|`|cj7sSPZEaa	My husband stays at home with the kids while I go to work and this works for us because I like getting out of the house and going to work.  Ideally we would both be working, and this was our plan, but nothing ever works out the way you want it to.  He doesn't keep the house clean and he doesn't do everything I would like him to do with the kids, but he keeps them fed and safe.  It is hard work staying at home with kids and it is good for him to take responsibility.
3fb331848975bd349a4c74bd71d9dccfaa	Your body follows its own calendar, not the one we follow.  It is a coincidence that your period happens to fall on the 7th each month and it just means that you've got roughly 31 day cycles.  I'd test in a few days with first morning urine.  Good luck!
cJRFbZUaaa	The pain might be worse in the evening if you are overdoing it during the day.  So take it easier to see if it helps.  You can also try different sleep positions to see what is most comfortable.  I found applying a hot pad and then an ice pack to the pain helpful before going to bed.  I also found that the ligament pain comes and goes, as the body gets used being stretched out down there, so hang in there, it'll be over soon!
j0xfBk5Caa	I think I remember reading in another of your questions or answers that you look really young. I still encounter people like this and I am 31, I believe it is because I look quite young. I'm very petite, about the size of a normal 12 year old, and I think it throws people off to see me walking around with my three year old. Don't even ask about the glares I get when my eleven year old is out with me too! When I was pregnant with my last I had a woman approach me and actually hand me a pamphlet for a local adoption agency! When my son and eldest daughter were young I got "the talk" all the time, " Oh honey there are SOOO many people desperate to have a baby and you are so young, you should give your baby to someone who can't have one so you can live your own life!" Uh WTF? I am living my life freak, by raising my kids and making a family. Unfortunately people don't always see it that way. They see as as irresponsible sluts who can't keep their legs shut. I mean what on earth could a young person offer a child right?<br>  <br>  People can be ignorant, opinions are like a**holes, everyone has one and they just LOOOOVE to voice 'em.<br>  <br>  ETA<br>  <br>  You want numbers Tofu? I'll have to estimate the numbers with my first two, it's been a while.<br>  <br>  So with my son I can distinctly remember 4 people. A nurse in the NICU who offered to adopt him. A lady at a mall food court who said her daughter would love to adopt such a nice looking newborn, then gave me her phone number. Some guy on a bus who told me him and his wife wanted to adopt and told me what agency they were working with then tried to hand me a social workers card and the public health nurse who came out after he was released from the NICU to help show me how to care for him. For the record the public health nurse goes to ALL homes with a newborn to screen for certain genetic conditions and provide support. There were more people who made subtle comments about how adoption would be better than me raising him.<br>  <br>  With my first daughter I remember two people who came up to me in public. One was a couple who oohed and ahhed over her before telling me, in great detail, about their fertility struggles and how lucky I was that I could have babies, then went on to tell me how I could have more and if I was overwhelmed by being a young, single mom they would love to adopt her. I was in Safeway, buying nursing pads! I wasn't single, her dad was grabbing vitamin D drops at the pharmacy. The other was a girl not much older than I was at a pool when my girl was 7 months old. In the change room she told me her mom wanted another baby but couldn't have one, she tried to give me her email address because "That baby looks like I did when I was little so she would like totally fit into my family and my mom would love to have her!"<br>  <br>  With my youngest it wasn't as bad. I mean if you really look at me I'm obviously not a teenager anymore, just the same size as one. I did have an old lady at a church craft sale inform me about the numerous couples who were trying to adopt and were members of the church. I politely informed her that I was more than capable of raising my child and had no desire to give her away. The lady told me that I was a sinner since I had no ring and that babies needed two parents I would surely ruin her life. <br>  <br>  So yeah, it never happens. Must just be that me and the original poster come off like such sh*tty people right?|`|3X4i5Whvaa	Agencies and attorneys are telling paps to be 'pro-active" in their search for a baby. They teach them how to do this. So this obnoxious aggressive behaviour is part of the new adoption quest.<br>  <br>  Any young mother is likely to be targeted. I think this behavior should be illegal... as it is soliciting.<br>  <br>  And it is frightening. Who knows how far some people will go? <br>  There have been some women who have stalked pregnant women, even killed them and taken their infants.|`|S5Lsbh0taa	I'd look at them like they just landed from Mars...and ask them 'are you for real?" Honesty I wouldn't never do something like that and I'm an adoptive parent. Even before we were placed with a child I never even got jealous seeing a young teenage girl with a baby and thought "She should give up that baby for adoption." After all the baby is her's, and i know some great very young mothers. Some were mother at 20yrs old or a little younger. I was married at 20yrs old began planning a family then. So why would 23 be to young? Wow you  must have very cute kids.<br>  <br>  It isn't normal behaviour, least not in my town....If they feel the need to do that then they need to professional help-fast.|`|XyU6oEVPaa	Actually, I know that happens.  There was a case of a pregnant waitress reported in the newspaper that had received a message from a customer asking to adopt her unborn infant. She was horrified. She thought  it was typecasting and caste system.  It wasn't.  It was 'desperate' PAPs. <br>  <br>  My best friend's niece was pregnant and my friend got called by 4 separate church 'friends' asking her to intercede with her niece and talk her into relinquishing her baby to them even though she had every intention of keeping the baby and surrender had never even come on her or the family's radar.  <br>  <br>  This is insufferable behavior, and no, they are not interested in helping the mother, the baby or anyone but themselves.  They want a baby at any cost, to anyone.  They will do or say anything that they have to in order  to obtain one.  This isn't all so I am not generalizing, but it happens often enough that it has been reported in the newspaper, and it happens at least one time to many women.  It is simply outrageous!|`|Faw2iBtfaa	No, I don't think they are thinking about helping anybody but themselves.  I do not feel that it is a practice anyone in a normal mental state would do to a pregnant women.<br>  <br>  I will tell you one thing....I just found out I am expecting...I too look very youthful, and if anyone were to approach me about adopting my child I would totally lose my mind on them.|`|MLQS5Vkdaa	Infertile PAPs that I know would never approach a baby in a mall or store like that.  It makes them feel too bad.  They don't like having it rubbed in their face that this young woman can birth and they can't.|`|qYZ2QFlbaa	do people do that? go up to women with kids and offer to adopt? hmmm....<br>  <br>  <br>  after reading the other responses, wow.... I would never have believed it.... Sorry to all of you out there who have been harrassed....|`|0x8Q6rFPaa	Lets you know where there priorities are, dunnit?<br>  <br>  It's not about helping the baby--it's about their helping themselves to the baby.|`|511e806a702f7f4b678843ad2696165faa	I think that they ask to help themselves.  Anyone who is willing to get that personal with someone has a major problem with boundaries, and has very little business parenting.  If they are resorting to baby trolling, then I would assume that the reason they are doing it is because they've been turned down everywhere else and that they are now desperate.  Both of these reasons would make me run, not walk, away.  People who would do this are horrid.  They should go to a foster care system and see if they can find a child to parent there, instead of trolling.<br>  <br>  I had people ask me this too with my first 2.  I had a hard time staying calm while telling them off.|`|AA11987492	Shelly- I had people at Wal-Mart ask me if I was considering adoption because they were looking to adopt, or their aunt was, on 3 different occasions. <br>  <br>  The check out lady at Meijer saw that I did not have a wedding ring on and I was about 7 months along and told me that I should let an infertile couple in her church adopt him because they were married and because since Jayden would not have a father figure that he would end up gay (WTF!!!)<br>  <br>  Then there was the time I was at K-Mart (BUYING BABY BEDDING) where an infertile woman told me her sob story about how she had tried for 5 years to get pregnant, been on a waiting list for 3 years, and that she would just make the best mom because she felt that it was "gods calling on her life" and that she could provide a wonderful home for my son and could give him the things that I couldn't. I called her a ***** and stomped off.<br>  <br>  When Jayden was 6 weeks old, I was sitting in Panera Bread with my Mom talking about what I should do about starting Nursing school. Jayden was crying and I had a lady come up to me and say that she had over heard our conversation, was trying to adopt, and she would love to adopt him "So that you can get through school"<br>  <br>  I received more stares, rude comments, and offers to adopt than I care to count. It DOES happen, A LOT!!!! No one has said this is "the norm" but it is unfortunately far from unusual.<br>  <br>  <br>  **************************************...<br>  <br>  <br>  To answer your question, I honestly don't know. I think their "desperation" for a baby kills their brain cells and they can't think clearly. I don't think they are "trying" to be jerks, but they DO feel entitled to others children. Just look at all of the people in the TTC section asking why their teenage neice can get pregnant and she can't, and she doesn't feel that it is right since she would "make a much better mom than her neice"|`|w2NA1KuXaa	I think the ones who ask about adopting a strangers baby like that, what is best for the baby is the last thing on their mind, its more about them and their needs.  <br>  <br>  I wasn't asked directly to relinquish either of my girls, but I was told by strangers that a better decision would have been to adopt them out, in a few different ways, by multiple people.  Usually when we were just enjoying a stroll in the park, or out picking up groceries, and that was 12 years ago, I can only imagine how bad things can be for young moms out there these days.|`|a095159fe0597a1cbcdff915d247b333aa	I have no idea what goes through people's heads when they walk up to some stranger and ask to adopt their baby.  I would never do that and when we were PAPs, it never once crossed my mind to do something like this.  I do believe you when you said it happened to you, though.  I'm sure it does happen and I have no idea what the thought process is behind it.<br>  <br>  When I was a pregnant teen, I never had anyone ask to adopt my baby.  I did have plenty of people offer to give me directions to an abortion clinic and tell me that I was screwing up my life if I didn't get an abortion.  Which, in my opinion, is equally inappropriate.  <br>  <br>  Some people, I guess.|`|8Qxb7OZOaa	"Do PAPs that ask strangers if they can adopt their baby think they are helping the baby?"<br>  <br>  <br>  I doubt those mental cases are thinking at all........some just invite the natural mother over for a "hot" home cooked meal pretending to be a do gooder or friend. Predatory Paps know that they will be more successful if they emotionally beat her down before hitting her up for her baby.
CdJtH0xdaa	Your friend is overreacting. What I would do is have a talk with your friend. At lunch, or when you don't have classes, have a talk, and make sure it's not a five minute chat in the hallway in between classes; you HAVE to do it when you are both available, and don't have classes. Then, you have to talk to her, and tell her that you did not put the gum in her hair, and tell her how you didn't mean for her to get laughed at; you were just trying to be a good friend by telling her so she wouldn't embarrass herself. Then, you should apologize for embarrassing her when she got laughed at, because that could have really embarrassed her. It's not fun to be laughed at by an entire class. All in all, you have have an honest talk with her; it's the best way to save your friendship. If she doesn't want to forgive you, you can't push a forgiveness, or an apology for overreacting out of her. If this is the case, you should give her time to think about the talk. Good luck to you and your friendship. =)|`|Cs2urP26aa	don't sweat it dear, she was embarassed, and the first thing that came to her mind was being angry at somebody. She might have been a little mad at the fact that you were laughing, but don't worry! she will cool down...<br>  Good Luck<br>  Hope I helped<br>  You can always IM me or e-mail!! :)|`|QJf2XNaTaa	She is over reacting, but on the flip side, she had right. Whether you did it or not, you could've been more supportive. Talk to her and apologize, even if you did nothing.|`|wa47F7DLaa	haha just wait till shes sick of having no friends and stick to your story, also say sorry for laughing at her.. i wouldve laughed too though|`|R4WX5twzaa	She's probably just really embarassed because she was laughed at by an entire class. Geo gave really good advice. For next time, when you need to tell a friend that something embarassing is going on with them (like gum in the hair), whisper it to them so that no one else can hear. That will avoid a lot of embarassment and arguments.|`|aDQgLEbuaa	Wow, she's taking this a little overboard.  However she was embarrassed in front of the whole class and feels as if she needs to blame it on someone.  Just giver her time to cool off, and explain that it wasn't you, but that you're sorry it happened.
CdJtH0xdaa	Yes, you can still get pregnant, even if you are on the pill. Pills are not 100% effective.|`|MIUzgwsTaa	I know you heard this before but: "You are risking pregnancy everytime you have sex, and std dont matter if you are using a condom or birth control."|`|R4WX5twzaa	Okay, you need to stop wasting money on pills that you're not taking. You know you have to take them consistently for one month before they actually start working, right? That means that if you miss just ONE pill, you run the chance of getting pregnant for the next four weeks.<br>  <br>  Just invest in condoms and spermicide. And for both you and your partner's sakes, I really hope that you've been using condoms all along.<br>  <br>  *EDIT* I'm on the pill, and I have an alarm set on my phone that goes off at 9:00 every night telling me to take the pill. My boyfrend is great about making sure I take it too. If he doesn't see me take the pill at 9, he'll nag me about it until I take it, but it's never more than a 1/2 hour gap. Maybe your boyfriend should do the same. If you have a cell phone, set an alarm on it that goes off at the same time every day (whatever time is most convenient for you to take it), and don't miss any more pills.|`|wUVUXHZtaa	Use condoms and tell him to pull out as well, that way youre safe until you get your new pack of BC. If you can, buy your pills 2 weeks before they are out. Or you can get 3 months worth.|`|lTsPX04jaa	yes you can be pregnant|`|QJf2XNaTaa	You can always get pregnant. My aunt's BFF has 3 kids, all were concieved on the pill.|`|146FzSqzaa	Yes there is always a chance you could get pregnant. Helpful hint: my doctor said if you take the bc at the same time everyday it works better.
WQcxODKLaa	i like Adrienne for girls because it's not that common .|`|Yz1pzloSaa	I don't like it on a boy.<br>  <br>  But I do think they are pronounced differently. I would pronounce Adrienne as "Ay dree EN" and Adrian as "AY dree in".|`|CxRJwJsraa	I like it for both!!! I really couldn't decide. I guess I'd just wait and see what you have first and then just use it, boy or girl.|`|XRLbqtUbaa	A girl.  I know a guy named Adrian but it's just one of those names I prefer for a girl.|`|jSd6qCwHaa	I personally like the girl version|`|mvKbfkhGaa	Adrienne/Adrian...any form of it is a girl's name in my opinion...=]|`|EvgSMTjnaa	I like it for both- but I really like it for a girl!

The boys' means 'from Hadria', which is a port in England. They're Latin in descent, but the girls' version is French.<br>  <br>  So whatever. I like it ;)|`|tSEA42Uraa	I prefer Adrienne as a girl's name.

LQtqYMP3aa	You can still fall pregnant after ovulation but it is harder to as your egg doesn't survive for very long. If you want to fall preggo try 2-4 days before ovualtion and try on the day of ovualtion.|`|3fb331848975bd349a4c74bd71d9dccfaa	The egg is only good for roughly 24 hours.  Sperm can live inside a woman's body for up to a week, if the conditions are right.  It would be really rare to get pregnant a few days after ovulation.  One thing, though, is that it is possible to ovulate twice in one cycle...but I don't think it is that common.  You ought to pick up Taking Charge of Your Fertility. :)
AA12221392	I would still make my kids wear a t shirt and a light jacket. 65 isn't really all that warm when you add wind and such in. <br>  <br>  There is no magic number persay for me when they can wear shorts, my rule is no shorts unless weather has been constinent in temp for 3 weeks. <br>  My kids hate this rule, but here in michigan the waether changes a lot so I want to make sure just because one day is warm they don't get the idea that they can start wearing shorts and such.|`|j2mRop0laa	My oldest was wearing a pair of gym shorts and a tank top today with knee high socks in 70 degree weather. Youngest had leggings and a short sleeve top.<br>  <br>  It has to be about 68 degrees for me to allow summer attire.<br>  <br>  65 would be fine if it's very sunny.|`|1s3nddaYaa	i had my son is shorts and a t-shirt yesterday and it was 65 degrees. it has to be in the mid 60s for my son not to have  jacket or pants on.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	in the adirondacks ..its year round. People wear shorts in the snow on the canadian border|`|WPI0Z47saa	That is a good question. I think it depends on how the weather HAS been compared to today. It was just freezing out a couple of days ago so today actually seems very warm compared to that so shorts may be comfortable. Now if it was just 90 out a few days ago and then dropped to 65 degrees it would seem cold and shorts would more than most likely feel uncomfortable. Do you agree? So in this case (oh and I live in PA so it isn't that far from you) I am wearing short sleeves and capris and am perfectly comfortable outside today. Go figure. Hope this helped.|`|m2aznd8xaa	you have to keep in mind that if 65 is the high its gonna get cooler. always take a sweater just in case. and i dont let my kids wear shorts until i know it wont get too cool as the sun goes down for me its 70  but i always take extra pants and sweaters .we live in chicago.so the weather is always different. and unpredictable.. if your not gonna be close to home difinatly take extra clothes .|`|8oAlBL91aa	No 65 degrees is not warm enough to wear only a tshirt. A tshirt and a light jacket. No shorts still not ready for that. I would say it's time to wear shorts when it's about 70/75 and the sun is shinning.|`|bdWO9wSAaa	Here in California, doesn't really matter what degree it is. If it's hot, you wear shorts and and a t-shirt, as long as it's comfortable.|`|ghz5D5iLaa	It depends on the age of the kids. My youngest is in Jr. High so I let them decide if it is warm enough for short and a T shirt. It is about that warm here in Ohio too. It was 68 yesterday.|`|gP0gYbBaaa	well im 17 and all im wearing is jeans a cute tee and maybe a hoodie. only cause i like how my hoodie looks w. this shirt. and maybe flats. but yea its really really warm today =] 65 sounds about right.|`|FBl2Dp3eaa	Yeah I wore my favorite tee  skinny jeans,flats and ,my favorite light jacket.65 sounds right|`|cYRZpGkqaa	I'm always cold. If I'm comfortable in them, then I know my daughter will be too.|`|aLAmvX5Naa	My daughter is only 1 but when I was growing up 65 was the magic number when you didn't need a coat. I think a t-shirt might be fine but I would reserve shorts for a warmer day. 65 feels warm right now after months of cold, but its not that warm.|`|nVQGpvuoaa	My parents let me wear shorts once its over 65 degrees.
hWe8vhKKaa	im so sorry for the loss at about 36 weeks they should let you take your baby home because then he is full term in their case .my baby was born boen 34 weeks thet kept him in until 36 weeks . i wish you all the best|`|q7sgWqZ3aa	It depends on how well your baby boy does. There are certain things that the baby must be able to do before he's sent home. My baby girl is in the NICU and I was told that they have to be able to breathe on their own, gain weight on the own and some other things on their own. They said that in most cases, doctors like to keep the babies until around their original due date. They also said that premature babies often have very good days then a few days later have a "bad" day. They said not to be discouraged about this, that most premature babies will have  a bad day. Having bad days can make them keep the baby longer as well.<br>  <br>  My baby was 27 weeks when she had to be delivered and her original due date was May 25.<br>  <br>  I would definitely ask YOUR doctor though at YOUR HOSPITAL. They know more then we do about your baby's conditions and all that. That's what the doctor is there for- to care for your baby and to answer all questions regarding your baby.|`|bMvAmMTaaa	sorry to hear about your little Roxanna x<br>  <br>  well it is safe to give birth within the last 4 weeks of your due date as they are fully formed, so i'd say, as long as everything is ok with Tyler, he should be out of hospital in about 5 weeks.<br>  <br>  good luck, hope you see you strong little man soon x|`|AA11784984	It really all depends on how he is doing. I think when babies are born premature they try to keep them until its closer to what their due date was.|`|V6slDthdaa	So sorry for your loss, it's imaginable. I have a daughter born at 25 weeks, she was in the NICU for 98 days. It really depends if there are other problems that come up. If nothing too serious pops up, you can expect to bring him home around his due date. However, I met a Mother of a 29 weeker boy who was in the hospital for 5 weeks before they released him, so it really just depends. Good Luck!|`|qj6pv3fUaa	I had triplets 3 years ago and they were born early. Unfortunately, two of my babies didn't make it. I was told that they'd need to be in NICU until nearer their due date. I actually took my daughter home on her actual due date. I'm sorry for the loss of your daughter and I hope your son is healthy. Love and luck to you all.|`|m1RTNmqsaa	My little girl was born 2-22-09 at 34weeks. When she got discharged out of the NICU the doctors told me not to take her out in public any were for a month. They said the only reason she should be out in public around people is for doctors apt.<br>  <br>  If I were you Id go with at least a month. With your babies being so little you dont want them to catch anything!|`|nmu6coapaa	Oh I'm not sure how long but really sorry to hear about your little girl!
oHNrktxTaa	I suggest the digital Clear Blue Easy OPK sticks. They are very easy to read & use. You dont have to compare lines & colors.<br>  Depending on the length of your cycle, you begin testing during your fertile week. It comes with 7 test sticks. If you have an irregular cycle, I suggest the fertility monitor. It is more detailed than the OPK's. It tells you not just your two PEAK days, but your high fertile days prior.<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!!
AjqO1aJgaa	I know it sounds a bit backwards - but what you do is give them BIG pieces. Not tiny ones. Many babies don't understand that they still have to chew tiny pieces, and try to swallow them whole. If you give them something bigger (there's a reason it's called "finger food", it's because it should be finger size and shape :) ) they automatically chew it.|`|CVdcrY3kaa	Give him bigger pieces! My daughter is seven months, no teeth, and she eats table foods. I cut them all a few inches long and maybe an inch thick (just depends, but I try to make sure they're long enough so she can hold them) It isn't uncommon for babies to gag, just make sure you're there. My daughter chews everything with her gums.|`|qH1YcQ2kaa	if he only has two teeth, try something very soft like small pieces of banana. if he still chokes after trying a few times, wait a few more weeks. some kids take longer than others.|`|3CVfUiiJaa	Was he actually choking, or gagging?  My son gags when I offer cheerios.  He actually doesn't know how to feed himself yet...and he is 9 months and I'm not rushing him.  I give him the opportunity to try everyday, but I know he really isn't ready to self feed.  He plays.   <br>  Did your son feed it to himself or did you put it in his mouth?  I would say if he isn't feeding himself, leave food on his high chair for him to explore with...feel and get used to picking up.  I think the ability to pick up food and place in their own mouth goes along hand in hand with being ready to eat table foods.  IMO of course...with my own experiences.
cf59b7a86d3c85c41cac7a7189fbda41aa	Smoking or exposure to secondhand smoke during pregnancy causes more serious risks to the survival and health of fetuses, newborns, and children than using cocaine during pregnancy. It is also a much more pervasive problem. Roughly one-fifth of all pregnant women, smoke -- and many more non-smoking pregnant women are regularly exposed to secondhand smoke because their husbands, partners, other housemates, or coworkers smoke. He should understand you are putting your child at risk everytime you go over. Just dont go any more he should be understanding. You have to take care of yourself and this baby. Good luck and take care! congrats on baby!|`|cJRFbZUaaa	Whatever you inhale, such as second hand smoke, eventually gets to the baby.  Your getting sick from the smoke is your body's way of telling you to stay away from it for baby's sake.  Tell the baby's father that it's nothing personal against his Mom, that it's done for the good of your (and his) baby.|`|mKUMsE5jaa	Im the same girlie...  My boyfriends dad and sister smoke at least 3 packs a day in or outside of their houses,  i refuse to go visit his family until at least 3 months after my baby is born or we would stay in a hotel because i feel like hes killing my baby and giving everyone else cancer.  Some people just dont care and its sad but you just got to let them know how you feel and they should understand...  I talked to my boyfriends dad about this and when they come here to visit i make him smoke outside.  Me and my bf are non-smokers also.  If only everyone else could quit smoking now...|`|AA10325228	It suffocates the baby and can cause severe birth defects. Tell her not to smoke around you because she is killing her grand baby.|`|H2IhRXIIaa	His mother is stupid for smoking around you..
AA12033653	This is a test that your OB will require.  It is really simple they just take a quick swab around your 36 week appointment.  And as far as treating it, it is antibiotics that they give you during labor to protect the baby.  <br>  <br>  Read more at:  <a href="http://www.babycenter.com/search/showResultsForContent.htm?contentTab=&intcmp=Nav_Global_Sitesearch&queryString=group+b+strep" rel="nofollow">http://www.babycenter.com/search/showRes...</a><br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|3dSCbIcEaa	I had homebriths and my midwife just explained everything about goup b strep (and the fact that less than 1% of babies will be effected by it without the use of antibiotics), and gave me the choice to be tested or not.  if i were to choose to be tested and tested positive i would have had to sign a release, or choose to birth in the hospital.  Luckily i was negative and everything went fine. Im pretty sure if u birth in a hospital they would require u to be on an iv if u r positive for insurance reasons mostly, im sure.  Good Luck either way, i hope u enjoy your birth!!|`|ArkvdaPoaa	I just got tested for Group B Strep.  My doctor told me that this must be done because if you test positive and do not get treated it is really harmful for your baby.  Your baby could end up getting really, really sick.  Some doctors do not mention it or do it but doctors usually test you for group b strep between 35-37 weeks.  If your doctor does not mention it when you go I think you should mention it because like I said earlier, it could really hurt your baby even though it has no effect on you.
Gn4iNKPSaa	Well i'm guessing it"s because your hormones r crazy as it is and giving u the BC before ur hormones have a chance to get back to normal is sort of risky, cuz they may make them worse and since u had sex already he just wants to be cautious w/ ur health i'm sure. ur hormones r what causes post partum depression. My dr wouldn't give me BC untill 3 months after delivery. So i wouldn't be to concerned w/ this, just use protection until ur BC is in ur bloodstream.|`|AA11784984	He probably wanted to check and make sure you were not pregnant again before giving you the pills.
VHHis05Naa	This is sad, but probably only 7-8 times in her life, and she's three.  I don't have family around and the only one here (an aunt) isn't interested and not very trustworthy.  So, we only get a babysitter when our parents are visiting or we are visiting them.  We interviewed a great babysitter, but she moved out of the country, so that was that.  Everyone else we know have babies and just can't help us out.  Soon baby #2 will be here and it will be a loooong time before anyone babysits for us since my aunt definitely won't watch a baby and a toddler.  Oh well, childhood is so short anyway.|`|Zb7CtLxbaa	I have a mother's helper, who helps me out Monday thru Friday from 2:30pm to 8:30pm. She will just stay with the kids when I have to bring someone to an appointment. We've got a lot of athletes in the family, so sometimes they have the option of going to their siblings games or staying home with our mother's helper. God bless her! I'd be insane without the help.<br>  <br>  But I rarely go out without the kids and leave them home with a babysitter. I'd say a few times a year. That's about it; we enjoying spending time with them.|`|EtTddxAqaa	How often do you use a babysitter?<br>  I have barely ever used a babysitter in my life, I have 3 kids and with a babysitter it does not go well, if I do need to go somewhere and not bring the kids, I use the neighbors (we know them) or else family!<br>  I dont go on like craigs list and find a babysitter, I would never do that!<br>  <br>   how often do you go out without your kids?<br>  Not very often, only if it is an emergency, Or else I get a family member to watch them, the kids love going out so we always take them with us.

I recall a series of babysitters for me when I was a kid and some of them were what we would now call abusive.  <br>  <br>  My husband and I have always had a date once a week, and when my kids were small, either my mother or his would always watch the kids.<br>  <br>  I know how lucky we are...I wish everyone were as lucky.

Just interview ahead of time, see who your family really likes, and go with that one.|`|b6EyFLgUaa	My husbands grandma takes her once every two weeks to once a month for a few hours.

We don't have family near by and I think I have went out with my husband a matter of 3 or 4 times since she was born...She's 3 1/2 years old.

m2aznd8xaa	well if its really affecting your grades i think your parents need to find someone else to babysit. talk to your parents about it and tell the teacher your situation also maybe they can write a letter home saying how babysitting so much is affecting you at school. you should not be responsable for a toddler right now if you have school.thats why you dont have kids of your own.  there isnt much you can do if your baby sitting so much. you have to tell your parents about it and your school.|`|0e0a0f1828f99f87ea3d5e5bc8cbd46daa	Sigh...well if THAT is her answer, and she Doesn't CARE About your grades, than she can't blame you when you get your report card. You know what is to blame, the endless babysittting. What is she doing? She is putting all the responsibility on you! HOW RUDE.|`|oUBUWfS6aa	Your other grades are great, good job :)<br>  <br>  As for the Geometry, you really need to speak to your teacher privately. Don't be embarrassed! Every teenager asks for help in school as well. Talk to your parents about the whole situation. Tell them you really need to have time for your self and for school.|`|in7qi4oZaa	You should not be worried. At least you are passing your classes. I can see that you are working hard and trying to be somebody in life.|`|EtTddxAqaa	tell your mom that you are having some problems keeping up with juggling homework and a child. I personally do not think this is fair of your mom to do to you or her son. I think he needs a grown-up to watch him not a teenager trying to keep up with grades. If he takes a nap or something while you babysit him than study and do homework in that time period. Also when you make dinner or do whatever with him try to make a fun game out of doing your homework, have him sit in the room with you and whenever you study and get the right answer have him clap and sing and do a dance with him, i did this with my kids when I went back to college, It made it fun for them. (:<br>  Seriously let your mom know that you cannot do this all the time, you need a break for friends and for school work. <br>  I would let my kids take a little break too. (:<br>  good luck, It seems to me your grades are awesome, the C or maybe even High D should not be a problem when you have to juggle all of this time and homework in one! It is too hard on a teen and you do not need any more stress I realize that! <br>  Also tell your teacher that you really need this extra help before school and explain the situation to her, she will most likely understand what you are talking about as a lot of teens are under pressure but not this much. Good luck.<br>  keep me posted! (:|`|gaGeR55maa	Ask your teacher if you can come in extra for afterschool tutoring ..<br>  <br>  And the one thing I learned while juggling little kids and homework is get them involved. My neice loves to sit there with some paper and a pencil and pretend she is doing homework with me... it usually keeps her busy for a good 30 mins to an hour. Or is there any shows or movies that really grab his attention. Try putting it on everyday even if he doesn't watch the whole thing it will give you a solid time frame where you can focus on your studies.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!
tSEA42Uraa	I would spell it as Sephina, personally, but out of your two, Safina looks slightly classier.<br>  <br>  Perhaps Seraphina?

AA10458750	You know you will always have some little smarta$$ talk about how they only gained 25 lbs. their whole pregnnacy blah blah blah.....The 25-30 pound, or 2lb a week weight gain is ~generally~ speaking, it is not aimed at each individual woman. I know it's hard not feelign like a big blimp right now, but your Dr. will not be mad at you. Some people gain 60-70 lbs and have beautiful, healthy babies and that is the Dr.'s #1 concern.|`|C8E3fe3xaa	Yes! I'm 26 weeks and have gained 25 lbs already..i also eat healthy, with the exception of a few treats, and i walk 4-5 times a week. I had a weight gain of 7 lbs at my last appointment but my doctor didn't say anything about being worried about my weight..i say just keep doing what you are doing, as long as baby is healthy that is all that matters. You can definitely lose the weight after baby is here. Good luck & Congrats!|`|vbwnLB8Gaa	I think that you are doing fine. Please try not to worry too much.|`|cJRFbZUaaa	There's no rhyme or reason to pregnancy weight gain!  I'm at term and gained about 10 pounds for the first six months and then put on five pounds in the seventh month and then almost nothing until the past month when I put on eight pounds.  <br>  <br>  Your scale and the OB's scale might show different weights even though you're the same person, so just go by what is recorded at the OB's.  One or two pounds per week is usually considered normal.  My OB said the baby's development was more important than the Mum's weight gain.|`|peQGGFPYaa	through both of my previous pregnancies i gained 75 with the first and 65 with my second, my doctor never yelled at me ( all though i retained alot of water in body)no body is the same, and its obvious you are not eating everything in sight. weight gain is perfectly healthy during pregnancy maybe not to my extreme. its all in genetics and water gain during pregnancy. dont fret about gaining weight its all about a healthy baby in the end. im twelve weeks and i have gained 8 pounds already.|`|tifYzmF9aa	I'm about 20 wks and have been reminded over and over that weight gain is completely normal.  The #'s they tell us is a general #, your system might just work differently.  As long as you're not having a general weight gain, then it just might be your baby.  And just like when you weight yourself for working out, make sure you weigh yourself at the same time each day.  And you keep active so I don't think your doc should be mad at you.|`|iNbSiIh1aa	I'm almost 27 weeks and have gained 15-20 over what you have gained, so I am really no one to talk, just wanted to let you know I feel for you and I'm in the same boat!|`|8oAlBL91aa	Well I have already gained about 20 pounds and I'm 23 weeks so I'm gonna be in just as much trouble as you are in lol. It's normal to gain between 20-40 pounds with pregnancy, what my doctor said.
SRsFkNBBaa	i have never, thankfully, had any problems yet with my kids being bullied. when i was younger, i wasn't popular, but i was friends with everybody, and i have a very soft heart so if i would see someone getting teased, i would break in and stop it. my daughter is the same way.<br>  i have thought about it before, and my kids and i have had talks. i think if i found out my child was being bullied, i would put them in a karate or self defense class. it may sound a little over the top, but now adays, when people say "bullied" it isn't the same as long ago, throwing rocks and name-calling. it is pretty severe, including deceiveing people to someones house & jumping them, putting them in the hospital, tearing them down completely, ruining their life with rumors-it isn't a quick "oh, just ignore them!" anymore-we as parents have to take steps, to ensure that our kids are safe. i would put them in a self defense class so the physical part was covered-then i would talk to the principle to ensure that he knows what is going on. the schools in my immediate area have a zero tolerance for bullying, so they get 2 chances, 1 warning and then suspension if they are caught. communication with the teachers and staff is key, i think. i would go so far as to call a meeting with all the teachers of my child, to let them all know what is going on. if none of these things settled my mind, i would go so far as transferring my child to a different school.-bullying is no joke. i definietly will be knocking on the parents door if it continues, and if i have to , threaten them like their child is threatning mine. my kids know the punishment for bulling someone else, including their bros & sisters, very harsh-<br>  bullying is no joke!<br>  <br>  im sorry-but i have to disagree with the people that are saying that bullying is the same as it always was-c'mon, back 10 years ago, it wasn't as bad. kids have always been cruel-but they haven't always taken it to a physical level. now, they do. i don't agree with that at all, and alot of it has to do with parents not being involved enough with their kids, to know what kind of personality and disposition they have. if you communicate with your kids, and know the crowd they hang with-you are smart enough to figure out what the cliques are, and when to speak up if your child is spending time with a crowd that is nasty to other kids. if one does it, they all think its ok when they are with them, either becuase they don't want to be the odd man out or becuase they don't have the maturity to handle it.<br>  <br>  i definitely think it is the parents fault if they don't discipline their child for bullying another. it is not the parents fault if their child gets bullied, but if their child is the "bullier" it is their fault-they should be the ones to step in and teach them and punish them for acting that way toward another person. if it isn't the parents fault for not punishing them.....whos is it?? the kid who picks on everyone becuase hes spoiled and allowed to do anything he wants? bullshit.  if my child gets hurt from being bullied from another child, im going straight to the parents.if that doesn't work, my child will learn how to throw a decent right hook, real quick.|`|e5f4c192231c92a0d059825b151f7553aa	It seems to be getting worse -because you hear more about it.<br>  <br>  People are less afraid of talking about it.<br>  <br>  And, out of control? Well, several reasons:<br>  - parents (in general) seem less inclined to act responsible, and teach responsibility. And, the tendency to threaten teachers or people who correct their children (even if just verbal) does not really help kids realize they are doing wrong.<br>  <br>  - schools. no anti- bully policy, afraid to correct kids who cause trouble for fear of lawsuits, or violence by parents.<br>  <br>  and there are several other reasons, but as i see it, the above are the two most influential factors.<br>  <br>  Personally, i`d smack a bully in the face. I have seen up close what they can cause - a 13 year old suicide because he couldn`t cope with all the bullying, and no support from school authorities.|`|hl5WdXnbaa	We have taken the power away from parents and the school.<br>  <br>   Schools especially have been under attack. Teachers no longer have the authority to discipline children. Can't make little Johnny stand in the corner or leave the class anymore because it might hurt their "feelings".  I am not saying bring the strap back, but teachers are not even allowed to mark paper with red pens any more because red is to "harsh" and little Johnny might get traumatized if he sees a red X on his paper. I can remember in school if we acted out we were made to run laps ..... if a teacher made a kid do that now it would be headline news.<br>  <br>  If your kid is being bullied, make some noise, be at that school everyday if need be. I am sure the school would love to get rid of the bully but can't but with other parents behind them they can do something. If it doesn't stop....bring criminal charges or a civil suit against the other child. You can be darn sure the bullies parents would make him stop then.... because they are obviously too worried about being the kids friend and not  parent.|`|tht0DrHsaa	I think its the parents fault.  I have 3 kids and they know what would happen to them if I found out they were being mean to another kid.  Once my niece was being really mean to this little girl.  She was telling her that her baby doll was ugly, old and dirty, and it really hurt the little girls feelings.  The girls parents were poor and that is all the girl had.  One day on the bus the girl wanted to play with my niece and my niece told her that she wouldn't play with her and her nasty doll I blew up.  I made my niece give her favorite doll to that girl and I put all my nieces good toys away. All I left her with was some nasty ratty toys.  After having to give that girl her doll and having only torn and dirty toys to play with understood what she had done was not right and now she goes out of her way to help other kids that don't have as much as she does.  She appreciates what she has.|`|b6EyFLgUaa	First off not ALL little kids are doing this. My daughter is a sweet heart and doesn't bully any one. Second kids have been bullied for YEARS, it isnt something new. Partly it is the parents but thats always been the fact.|`|Fd0hvyoyaa	Another stereotypical view of children. I know many young children that are not like this.|`|yXDtGo8taa	A child is only as good as the parent raises it.|`|MA9XuLlHaa	No daddy in the house|`|I2iXz32paa	Now a days? where have you been, kids have always been mean and cruel!<br>  <br>  I've been attacked as an adult for the same stupid stuff I figured people would have gotten over in middle school, so it seems to me that some people are petty and cruel during their entire lives. (I.E people throwing crap and screaming out "Dyke!")<br>  <br>  It's a power and control thing, if you can't have power over your self then you try to force other people into submission so you can feel important. A bunch of bull passed on to the next generation and then the next because a lot of parents will bully their children, teaching them that if you can push around people that are weaker than you then you are better. Those kids show the others...<br>  <br>  All the world's a stage, And all the men and women merely players...and we're in a tragedy in which cruelty and violence are what push the world.|`|98qMZZPlaa	BLAME TARTISM!!!!  Stop buddyism and tartism and bullying should cease!! End Tartism!|`|EbMy8B79aa	i blame parents|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	its not a recent phenomenon|`|ifSWXqU5aa	Thank Madalyn Murray O'Hair for that when she took prayer and Bible out of public schools.|`|wZAeBisbaa	I agree with the first answer.  Thanks to education and culture change, kids are probably more civil and less mean than in the past.  But if bullying is a big problem where your children live or go to school, you will need an organized effort to stop it.  Talk to the school and express your concerns.  Ask about anti-bullying programs.  There are some great ones that really work. <br>  <br>  In the neighborhood, there may be little you can do unless you and other parents can communicate and agree.  If there is no such consensus or support, and if neighbor kids are harassing your children, call the police.   Ask them to provide some presence in the neighborhood and protect kids from physical assault.  There may even be programs that they are aware of that you could help start in your neighborhood.|`|m2aznd8xaa	is this happening in school. schools are supposed to make your child safe in that enviorment. my daughter goes through it sometimes too.she is 9 years old and is a very kind and gentle person. although she is quite popular in school there are always bullies . she had problems on the bus so she told her bus driver . and when that dont help you need to do it yourself. i had waited for the bus to arrive because i was so tired of my little girl complaining about this bad mouthed little boy as . whenj it pulled up i had my daughter point him out . i had him talk to me and the bus driver and he apoligized. i told him i know where you live and i know what class your in and if i hear just one more time you are bothering my child you will be called to principles office and i will make sure to talk to your parents and it worked.also the bus driver told him she would suspend him from the bus. if its in class make sure you write to the teacher about it. they are good at handleing it. just keep contacting the school until it gets tooken care of. if its a neighbors kid i tell my kids not to play with them and if the  mean kids ask why.i tell my kids  to tell them friends are supposed to be nice to each other. also talk to the bullies parents. it sometimes can backfire since the parents seem like bullies themselves when you try to talk to them about there child. but if all else fail call the police and they are great at scaring the kids too and just tell them your child is being harrassed.and they give the bullies a good talking.  youll always have bullies which i blame the parents. but just deal with it by going straight to the school  and or the parent. about it.  you can also tell the bullie yourself hey that is not nice so if you cant play nice stay away from my kid or there will be consequences.|`|8oAlBL91aa	It is ridiculous...My 6 year old son was being bulled on the bus and everyday he was coming home in a bad mood but wouldn't tell anyone what was wrong until one day he got off the bus and cried his eyes out and told me that another boy was pulling his hair and told him that if he told anyone he would say that my son was doing it. I was furious I went to the school and demanded someone take care of this problem by them time he gets on the bus to come home he came home in a better mood and the boy was suspended because they watched the tapes and saw him hurting my son.<br>  <br>  EDIT: for the people who think it's the parents fault that is so not true in my sons situation he did nothing wrong and I did the absolute right thing by making sure my baby wasn't being hurt.|`|rNvXWMOMaa	because parents aren't putting them across their knee<br>  for some well deserved spankings.

I just had to deal with mine. You could try putting an ice pack on there if it gets really itchy. That might help. But I don't think you can use any creams or anything. At least it's a good sign that you're healing!!<br>  <br>  Just to warn you, mine itched for months and months. I hope yours is different! Congrats on the baby!!|`|nZVTHKNwaa	I have the same thing and my c-section was 8 months ago! I haven't put anything on it, I just sort of deal with it.

But since yours is still so fresh, definitely seek your doctor's advice before applying any ointment or creams.

We are a pretty Tartastic family. Why do you think I capitalize the "T?" I think there is a reason you do too...<br>  <br>  You act all holier than thou about Tartism but deep down inside there is a big Tart just dying to come out.|`|t1fx6kXcaa	A Blog By Tartism Sucks:<br>  "I guess it started a few a days ago, when i had a real bad day at work.  I was tired.  I was up all night with the baby and all day as well.  He was sick.  Then at work, i had food thrown at me by an elder pt who was going through her own thing.<br>  My day came to an end at 11:30 pm.  I needed to run out to the store to get some groceries before heading home.  Here it is almost midnight.  An a**hole pulls into my parking spot as i was just about to turn in.  We got into a yelling match.  I gave up and parked elsewhere and headed into the store.<br>  Its midnight, and i see this little boy yelling and hitting his father over some cupcakes or something he wanted.  The father, instead of just paying for his two items and taking the kid out, puts on this whole show.  Laughing and baby-ing the boy.  Long story....but it was not cute.  It was annoying and not not just because i was tired.  "Buddy, daddy is digging in his pocket looking for more change for the cupcakes..blahblahblah blah!"  A whole display.  I waited behind him waiting to pay for my few things...<br>  <br>  I felt angry, only because this was not the first, or second or even tenth time i seen this nonsense. Usually, i dont come across this at midnight, but lately i seen way too much of this Tartism s---.  Now i get the word Tartism from a group of ladies at work.  One said it and the way she explained it made perfect sense.  That issue is for another blog on another day if anyone is interested.<br>  <br>  Now this Blog is just for why i have felt angry.  I asked the question on Y!answers, i guess assuming people have heard of Tartism.  As it turns out, only very few people knew what i was talking about.  I got bashed!  I got more pissed.  I am angry too that I do not get to be a SAHM!!  Honestly, i wish i was.  So i also bashed the SAHMs because of, i guess anger and jealousy.  I am exhausted at the end of the day and do not want to work.  However, my fiance just does not at all make enough money for rent, nevermind the bills and the cars (old ones at that).  My LPN job just helps make ends meet as most people are going through right now.  I do raise my kids, i do not leave them with a stranger.  But i was Angry this day and felt attacked upon talking about Tartism.  So i bashed the SAHM.  I am going to blog on how much better they do have it, and that IS my opinion!  That also is for another blog on another day.<br>  <br>  All in all, i still feel irritated by Tartism.  I do understand that you can raise your kid however you want, but i also have the right to be annoyed by it when the situation is public"<br>  <a href="http://72.14.235.132/search?q=cache:AuqdhnZkRIkJ:shine.yahoo.com/channel/parenting/i-been-angry-lately-421481/+tartism&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=7&gl=au" rel="nofollow">http://72.14.235.132/search?q=cache:Auqd...</a><br>  <br>  So....Do you think, that maybe, just maybe you have some serious issues and hangups?

But dr said it will go away once he's born and I get back into my figure. Ask your doctor though, cause each scar can be different. It may stretch and go back to normal after birth, but can't be sure.|`|7rIAd6gGaa	I have a scar from my belly button ring - so much smaller than yours. It just got wider and looked stretched out. After the baby came, it stayed larger than it had been, but looked about the same otherwise (the texture or appearance didn't change - just the size). Good luck!|`|k1REVuYNaa	its like a ballon|`|58f00eb827abff12eac8ed561f2ced1aaa	your skin is like a strong, complicated net. When you gain weight or are pregnant, the net stretches and causes some of the proteins in your skin to break (causing stretch marks) Scars are very similar. Scar tissue is tougher than normal skin, so when it stretches it looks different too. It wont effect your pregnancy at all. If you are worried about the appearance of scars or stretch marks, I use cocoa butter lotion. It helps a lot!
l4gqo2LBaa	I prefer Maltilda over November... it sounds better and also gives you  a chance to honour your grandmother for raising you.

mvKbfkhGaa	I answered your other questions too and i like Rosalie better it's so much prettier...Good luck with your twins! They're a handful sometimes but their truly worth it!|`|e4M4uQXNaa	Aurora Rosalie!<br>  <br>  I love Rose, but as a middle name, it's been very overdone these days.  Anything with it as a middle name just feels heavy and stuffy to me, because Rose is just so tired sounding.<br>  <br>  Rosalie is fresher and prettier as a middle name to me, and Aurora Rosalie Matilda Winters (I answered your other question just now lol) sounds perfect to me.|`|pCbzhOrkaa	Aurora Rosalie! Its really, really cute!|`|9b9c4dc669c29b1293318c04993f2a7daa	Rose without a doubt. It's always served me well as a middle name, at least!<br>  <br>  And your baby's name would mean Dawn of the Rose! How cool is that!!|`|F7tyzrMzaa	Aurora Rose. I know a little girl named Aurora Rose and she's absolutely adorable! <br>  <br>  I do agree Rose is a bit overdone as a middle name but I think it really flows with Aurora. Aurora is quite a long name and Rose is short and simple.<br>  <br>  Also, Rosalie reminds me of the Twilight craze, and I'm really getting sick of it.<br>  <br>  Just to add- Rora and Rory are lovely nicknames.|`|9CAXUgOZaa	It depends on the last name. <br>  <br>  If it's a one or two syllable last name, I'd go with Aurora Rosalie, and if it's got more than two syllables, I'd go with Rose. <br>  <br>  Aurora Rose sounds better on its own, though.<br>  <br>  Edit: If you're going to have two middle names, I'd go with Rose.|`|emGF1hZ9aa	I think it kinda depends on how many syllables are in the last name the baby will receive. <br>  <br>  I think I like Aurora Rosalie better though.|`|tQPvv0Glaa	Aurora Rose is the better of the two.  Aurora Rosalie is too much of a mouthful.|`|l4gqo2LBaa	Aurora Rosalie|`|423983e632cb60a59de566f2b6c70711aa	Aurora Rose|`|E6CShQfKaa	Rose, since Aurora is 3 syllables|`|nSJ6q5SQaa	Since Aurora is three syllables, I would go with a short middle name, Rose.|`|CTmWS6dMaa	I like Aurora Rosalie best. Since Rose sounds so similar to the sounds in Aurora,  Aurora Rose ends up sounding like Aurorarose. Rosalie's length helps split the names up better.|`|piRgeSYlaa	I think Aurora Rose sounds better because Aurora is 3 syllables and Rose is short. I think Rose goes better with Aurora than Rosalie :)|`|NgxG5Ayqaa	Rosalie, because Aurora Rose is from Sleeping Beauty|`|OTnkoPSdaa	Rosalie!!! :)|`|C8MN9lklaa	Aurora Rose|`|a1uoxczTaa	Aurora Rose is from sleeping beauty!

7rIAd6gGaa	That's very unusual. You should really go get tested by your doctor. That being said, false positives usually don't happen. The positive reading is caused by hcg, and that is only present in your urine during pregnancy. If you got more than one positive, I would say you are definitely pregnant. <br>  <br>  Did you take the positive tests first thing in the morning and the others at a later time in the day? Your first urine of the day has more hcg in it, so maybe that's what happened?|`|3505983107c631451310c5009361ae76aa	it would be strange to get false positives. best thing to do is make an appointment with your Doctor and get a blood test done. that should be accurate. good luck|`|58f00eb827abff12eac8ed561f2ced1aaa	thats very odd. Did you have any strong bleeding? How far apart was your testing. If you had a yes and now have no's I'd see a doctor as soon as possible.|`|VmqOq8Qjaa	Yes, depends on when you tested.
EccBqsntaa	Your parents can charge him with statutory rape.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	It really depends on the state they live in, but usually yes he can.|`|X9JSlC6Iaa	They can charge him with rape. Then he will go to jail then when he gets out, he will have to define himself as a child molester. Not very smart on his behalf because he knew it was illegal and so did you.|`|AA11784984	It depends where you live and what the legal age of consent is. If your over the age they can't charge him, if your not they can charge him with sleeping with a minor (rape).|`|gP0gYbBaaa	it depends what state. but i dont think so. i believe 16 is the age of consent.|`|vtafeEIJaa	wonders shall never end...........|`|N8UKu0WUaa	in america, it depends on the state.<br>  <br>  but i'm not sure what country you live in... but i can tell you about Canadian law. in Canada, 16 is the oldest age set by the government (it used to be 14 in some parts), where someone can legally have sex... with anyone, so it wouldnt be a problem, also, in canada there is an age assimilation law, which means you can have sex with anyone within 5 years of your age, so in canada, the answer to your question is nothing... but if you're american, im not sure, you'll have to specifiy your state too because their probably all different|`|4863f8dd77952e57a9c03006243c12c6aa	Statutory rape but It depends what state you live in.<br>  <br>  & well lets say you are pregnant and decide to keep the baby.<br>  then you parents charge him and he is found guilty. Now he is away and your child is without a father, so if you are pregnant talk to your parents and give them reasons not to charge him. especially that it was a mutual thing<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  i suggest you find the legal age of consent in your state or country.|`|RDgyb7W8aa	In most states he could be charged with statutory rape because you are 18.  Each state is different though and it is up to your parents.  If you are pregnant you will have to tell them.|`|vKB8q4ogaa	they cant charge you with anything. the legal age almost everywhere to have sex is 16 and if you both consented to it, he cant be charged for rape.|`|uImDX3AXaa	it may depend on the state u live in. all i know is if your 16 and he is not a day over 4 years older than you, he cant be charged if you both consented.|`|C8C7eIBbaa	thats how i feel right now. im in the same position. i am going to go to georgia and get married it seems like the only logical thing at the moment.|`|3ERx4opSaa	you need to see what state you live in<br>  <br>  The charge is called statuary rape, basically the sex of two minors that give consent.

My youngest sons name is Braxton, and I adore it! James is really cute, too. I love that name. Evangeline Rose is great too. And for short, you call her Eva or Evie. Rose is beautiful too.

8dpZpH0Saa	There is no spoon.|`|hy94mVD8aa	We actually just got done teaching my little sister this. We had similar problems, we didnt have the suction plate which might have helped, we just had a normal plate that always ended up in her/our lap. It ended up being alot of work on our part but we finally got it. We held the plate on the table so she couldnt pull it off and had her hold the spoon, while helping her hand grip it. We were still practically feeding her at first but after repeating this for awhlie she started to get the hang of it. I think it helps constantly praising the child for using the spoon.|`|JIxAVONXaa	By letting you child have a spoon. Really, he should have been given a spoon since you started him with solids while you fed him with your spoon. This way he would have been able to build up his manual dexterity, learned first hand what the spoon was for and would have been able to make attempts at feeding himself on his own terms. <br>  <br>  So simply give him a spoon and a small amount of food for him to feed himself from on the tray while you feed him with your own bowl and spoon. He will figure it out and do it just fine.<br>  <br>  There will be a mess, ther eis no way to avoid that unless you feed him yourself forever. Children are messy, especially when mastering a new skill.|`|uuHDa852aa	you start eating with a spoon and tell him how good it is with a spoon. It's like monkey see monkey do

You want that stuff to be a secret.....If he's following you around,telling you everything, AND HUGGING YOU then thats obviously a sign! He looooooves you! HE can say he hates you as much as he wants but deep down he really likes you, he just dosen't want anyone else to know it.....=]|`|CdJtH0xdaa	It doesn't sound as though he hates you at all. Does he say he hates you when he's around other people? If so, he might just prove to them that he doesn't like you. When the rumor began going around, he might have felt embarrassed and insecure, so he wanted to prove that he hates you. However, the nice things he does doesn't sound as though it's in public. So, I think he likes you, but just wants to prove to people that he doesn't like you.|`|QJf2XNaTaa	It's just because he's embarrassed with all the attention y'all are getting. Much adieu about nothing.|`|CsIwiZRoaa	hes a boy and boys are stupid..that pretty much sums it up.
87lOwgDxaa	dont listen to all of them fools, if your pregnant your pregnant - [ i ] think that the best way is to write them a letter before you go to sleep and wait for them to go to sleep and maybe then go to a friends house - and then leave the letter somewhere they WILL see it in the morning, and mention in the letter that if you would like for me to come back then call me and i will come back - and then if not then i wont, becuase thats preventing you and the baby from getting hurt - most likely they will call you or something. just let them have time to get mad and cry and do whatver they want.<br>  <br>  OR :<br>  <br>  just sit them down and let them know, BUT be like : "we can talk more about this later " and then go upstairs or outside or something because just how u were when you find out u were pregnant ; you were probally in shock, and they most-likely will be too.<br>  <br>  you should check your state and the laws because most states - INCLUDING mine (which is Maryland) * your parents can NOT make you get a abortion or make you give your baby up for adoption.<br>  <br>  but dont hide it from them, because TRUST ME - your deffently going to need your mom there, you couldnt do it by yourself - most teens cant, they need lots of help from family and moms and doctors.<br>  <br>  GOODLUCK!! - let me know how it went <3<br>  & whatever the people have to say below....<br>  dont listen to them because people are always so<br>  quick to judge situations. ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE!<br>  mistakes happen, but trust me - you will love your baby<br>  more than anything in the worLd :)|`|6dSonCRTaa	Just come out and tell them,if your young or not in a stable relationship like all parents they will be concerned but they will get over it.For some people telling them on the phone is easier than talking to them face to face.It may seem immature to some,but for alot of people its the easiest form of communication especially when dealing with a sensitive topic like yours.<br>  <br>  ~Best of luck|`|7p9qgkSFaa	Invite your boyfriend and his parents over for dinner at your house and make sure your boyfriend already knows. Then, after you take your first bite of the delicious food, say you have something important to say. Then have your boyfriend say something like Please don't get too mad right now we were foolish, we're sorry. When they ask, why what did you do? tel them mom dad I got pregnant.|`|QJf2XNaTaa	Tell them face to face. Never call or text someone to say that kind of news. If your having trouble getting the words out, bring a note that explains the situation, but be with them as they read.|`|6iI0UsPNaa	roll them all about give them sweets and tell them the news|`|FEStjFIRaa	tell them you did what grown ups do <br>  and the consequence is a baby!!!lol|`|oVwGit7qaa	Just tell them, and say also, that you are hoping that they will help you, and support you through this. Also tell them what you are planning on doing, keeping or adoption.|`|jZ7ImGbvaa	Um,  mom and dad,  I kinda forgot to keep my legs closed.  Sorry to sound  mean,  but that's pretty much what happened isn't it?  And with birth control so available too.  There are consequences for actions. I feel most sorry for the  baby,  especially if you take the easy way out.|`|CdJtH0xdaa	You really just have to sit them down, and be honest. Say something like, "Mom, dad, a few weeks ago I had sex with my boyfriend, and I found out that I'm pregnant." My wife (girlfriend at the time) did that when she told her parents. Then, you have to let them react, and they most likely will have questions. You need to answer the questions, and be calm when you answer them. Telling your parents you're pregnant is never easy, but you should always remain calm when telling them. If they get angry, try not to yell at them back, because that will just cause an argument. I wish you the best of luck.|`|03GNhNcsaa	just flat out tell them.<br>  the first step is always easy, but if you are keeping the baby, the hard steps come by.<br>  i hope they understand!

3X0t8JrXaa	It can be and probably is.  I started feeling my baby 2 weeks ago (19 weeks) and it was only at night when I laid down for the day.  It was questionable but over the next 2 weeks its very very obvious and at 21 weeks my husband can feel it and we can even see it...its crazy!!!  I'm pretty small myself so may be why this is happening so soon but it only gets more exciting from this point :-)|`|YP3rEESUaa	I wouldn't doubt that it was the baby moving around.  its a funny feeling at first, almost like gas bubbles.  but you are right around the time when most women start feeling their baby's movement for the first time.|`|cJRFbZUaaa	Most women start to feel baby at that time.

Along with Cameron, Carson, Hunter, Fisher, and all these other names.<br>  <br>  The other people are right. It IS way too masculine for a girl.<br>  <br>  Withe the surname of Johns, you need a girly name so people know it's a girl just by her name.

z5JkgFOyaa	Your period could definitely have been missed because of the cyst. I have missed my period once or twice too in the past (over the past 11 years) because of ovarian cysts.  I have also had my period turn up 4-5 days late my past 2 cycles due to ovarian cysts (I currently have 2 ovarian cysts).<br>  <br>  If you do think there is a possibility that you are pregnant, I would recommend that you try another pregnancy test and if it is negative that you wait for your blood test (HCG) results later today (9 March) to see what they show.<br>  <br>  All the best. Good luck :)
pnL5WTXMaa	yes, you're over-reacting and yes, girls are growing up too fast nowadays. i wouldn't make a big deal out of it. i would just try to get her to focus on age appropriate activities - with her girlfriends. i think it's more concerning that she is not listening to what you said. (that's why i would limit what i impose on her). tell her simply that we don't kiss in school. and leave it at that.|`|7D44tO9Daa	its probably just a crush <br>  i know a boy who is 4 who kisses girls on the lips all the time!|`|qlYmOAfMaa	No your not overreacting, you just want the beast for you little girl.

I'm 16 now and live a stable life getting good grades etc.  I know it must suck to watch your kids grow up but if you are flipping over this wait until grade 7 when she gets a boyfriend..|`|m2aznd8xaa	no you are not over reacting. tell her she is to young and you will not allow it anymore. and there will be consequences if she doent stop. talk to the teacher about it and just say she has a crush at school and for her to keep an eye out  if she sees them together to much.my daughter tryed the same thing in second grade too,but i stopped it in its tracks. i know its innocent right now and i just told her she isnt allowed to have a boyfriend because she i way to young and school is more important. i told her that if she bothered the little boy again i would change her class.and i would have a talk with the teacher and his parents and it stopped. you really need to have a serious talk with her about because if you let it go now she will think its okay.|`|NDpO8hX4aa	of course u r over-acting. I have 5 children and this is normal it is a simple little cruch next year she will not like boys and be running away from them yelling boy germs
GGH0HVdvaa	I guess however old you parents want you to be before you babysit, or however old the parents of the children you're babysitting want you to be.|`|SEzIkGNiaa	I am not sure.  But I think it all depends on maturity, not age.  If you are certified, and are a mature 12 year old, I would definately go for it.<br>  <br>  Good Luck =]|`|gP0gYbBaaa	however old the parents of the kid want<br>  personally i wouldnt let a 12 year old watch my kid if i had one; a 12 year old cant even watch them self|`|CdJtH0xdaa	I don't think that there's an age. I think it's up to the parents of the children you are babysitting.

ZbnxGIsnaa	Well, I certainly hope you are pregnant dear.  Well, I just found out last week that I am expecting my second child and thought I'd relate some of my symptoms for you.<br>  <br>  The cramps I experienced were a pinching sensation that would go from side to side in my abdomen and my breasts got bigger yes, and my nipples hurt REALLY bad.  My cervix was quite low and hard at about 12 dpo, and then went back up the next day.  It was so high I couldn't even touch it and it morphed into my vaginal wall and it was soft like my lip and I had creamy white discharge.<br>  <br>  I was tired and very hungry and dizzy!|`|ndO6MiQaaa	hi i dont really understand ur tearmanolagy are u pregnant r do u think u are by the sound of it i think u are too tenderness in breasts are the first sign i hope u are dear it sounds like u want to b so good luck xxx
AiJeS6I1aa	If you are going to switch to bottles, you don't need to formula feed.  Why don't you pump?  Then your baby gets the benefits of breastmilk, and you keep your supply up.  Some people find they cannot pump enough because the pump is not as good stimulation at the breast as a baby - but, you could feed breastmilk and top up with formula... better some breastmilk than none!<br>  <br>  Also, have you tried SNS (supplemental nursing system, otherwise known as lactation aid)?  This allows you to supplement your baby with formula or expressed breastmilk through a small tube taped to your nipple.  This allows continued stimulation at the breast to help with milk supply, and allows the baby to continue to practice breastfeeding - the only way she'll learn!  Also, then she doesn't get spoiled by the ease of bottle feeds.  She only knows what you give her, so if the only way food comes is at the breast, she will breastfeed!<br>  <br>  As for improved suck reflex and retraining a baby back to the breast... this is difficult and usually works the best around 8 weeks - so you're there already.  If you switch to bottles now, you will likely never go back to the breast (of course, never say never!).<br>  <br>  Good luck to you and congrats to you for making the best choices for your baby.  This is not easy and you've obviously done a great job so far.  You'll get there!<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT:  Also, I just wanted you to know that this is not just a recommendation.  I know it works!  I used the SNS in the early weeks with my daughter due to a poor latch, poor milk supply, and poor weight gain.  We used this for just under 2 weeks (first with every feed, then tapered off).  We are now an exclusively-breastfeeding pair.  My daughter is 6 months old and we have started some solids.  Good luck!|`|AjqO1aJgaa	Have you tried pumping? It seems bizarre to feed her formula while still trying to keep your milk supply up.|`|ROJans2Taa	when I was having troubles I was offered and used this tube that attaches to a syringe, you place it beside your nipple and to convince baby to latch you push the syringe so a little comes out the tube, usually baby gets a taste then wants to suck, so they latch on with tube and nipple in mouth and feed, meanwhile you keep slowing pushing the syringe to keep baby interested in feeding, some babies get fussy if the milk is coming to slow, this helps keep your supply up until baby resorts to just BF, I did find it hard to use my husband had to aid in helping my son get on while I held the tube, but it worked for awhile, until eventually I started to just pump, it's just an idea, I got mine from my lactation nurse but im sure they must sell them somewhere, best wishes|`|AA10893102	I agree with the person who recommended the SNS...it sounds like you are still having problems because you keep confusing your baby with the bottle nipple. If you need to supplement, you should only supplement with a bottle as a last resort after the SNS, and after the SNS with a shot glass or a small cup, and even after that, I would not use a regular bottle. I would use an adiri natural nurser instead. She will never get the hang of it if you keep giving her a bottle, and yes, your milk supply will dry up. Get an SNS asap! Also, contact a lactation consultant so you can get her latched on correctly.

281bc9a14a2a3c5832ce389a1258dda1aa	Actually a baby can cry in the womb they also laugh and some even suck there thumbs! Both my sons were seen sucking there thumbs. More and more research is being done, I think it is more practice than anything. However as someone stated before there are no tears but baby's cry when there born and there are no tears for about 2 months. I don't think tears define crying in my opinion.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	Because there's no air in there. Human vocal cords don't work in fluid.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	Well, let's start with the tear glands - they don't start working until around 2 months for one.   Other then that, you need to define what cry means - and it's my opinion that in the womb a fetus is so happy and content that it is in a state that gets close to a narcotic coma, total bliss and without any inkling of the hardships of life.|`|3dSCbIcEaa	theres no reason to, all its needs r being met

uNzFexpRaa	Have you had any pain, like cramps with the pain??? If so then unfortunately this could be a sign of miscarriage<br>  <br>  HOWEVER!<br>  <br>  I have been having bleeding (i swear my EPU are sick of the sight of me lol) no cramping, a few clots and this has been going on for just over a week and a half now. I have found out today that i have a Extrachrionic haemorrhage which is blood between the area around my amniotic sac and the lining of my uterus and thats the cause for my bleeding, baby however is still swimming around healthy and kicking despite this - this poses no risk to her. Apparently this is extreamly common in early pregnancy so this could be your case (im NOT diagnosing im just suggesting a possibility) <br>  <br>  It is also common to have periods throughtout pregnancy - My actual advise would be to contact your local Early Pregnancy Unit, Midwife or your GP!<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!!|`|58f00eb827abff12eac8ed561f2ced1aaa	if it was just a little bit of blood, its fairly normal. If its a lot of thick, heavy blood that continues throughout the day, you need to go to the dr. If you have any pain, go to the dr. I had a positive 3 weeks ago, a week later, had blood and pain, went to the er, they said I would miscarry, went back to the dr yesterday and found the heartbeat. No matter what they tell you, get more blood tests and another ultrasound just in case. Good luck.|`|a1uoxczTaa	you may have miscarried.|`|wWkfASTNaa	I would maybe take another test to see if it is still positive now, it may have been a chemical pregnancy if it is heavy bleeding just like your period. But if it is just light spotting, hten that is perfectly normal during pregnancy, as long as it is super light and is not accompanied by cramping.|`|QbiOa0YQaa	some people can bleed when pregnant but you never know, you might want to go to your local emergency room and get checked

Pills take like 2 weeks to start working.

A shower will not prevent you from getting pregnant. I've never taken birth control pills, but I'm pretty sure they tell you to wait more than 5 days before relying on it for effectiveness. And you shouldn't have had sex until they said it was safe because you don't want to be pregnant and taking the pills because it can be harmful. A pregnancy test would also not be positive three days after. It takes more like two weeks to  know. You should know all of this before you have sex. You're obviously not mature enough to be reproducing. Stop having sex until you grow up.|`|ggX5nO0haa	You would have to wait and see if you get your period or not. If you don't, take another pregnancy test. Most likely if you are on birth control its unlikely  but they aren't 100% effective. There is always the Plan B pill which isn't an abortion pill but I think its a little too late to take that. Just be careful next time hun.

3fb331848975bd349a4c74bd71d9dccfaa	I'm a pretty laid back mom about fevers.  I figure, if the kid is sick, she'll run a fever to kill off whatever is making her sick.  The body doesn't normally allow a fever to reach the dangerous point.  It takes a HIGH fever to cause damage and the body won't let it get that high under natural circumstances.  I know it isn't fun to see your kiddo sick, but don't freak out.  You had her checked at the ER and they said virus.  Everything she's experiencing (fever, runny nose, cough, even the vomiting) can be attributed to a virus.  Viruses just have to run their course.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	Throwing up means she's got respiratory distress if it's accompanied with a cough.   Did she see a pediatrician or the ER doc?  If the ER doc call the pediatrician and speak to whomever is on call right now!   Around here there has been a virus that has been causing viral pneumonia, all of her symptoms are similar to my 4 year old's who had to be admitted for respiratory distress this week - it is very dangerous to ignore those symptoms.|`|PDHCOrOSaa	My 14 month old was very sick last week and I took her to the doc ( she had a horrible fever and all the symptoms u described ) anyway they looked her over and said it was viral (they always say that ) two days later her fever broke a bit but I just knew something was not right.  I brought her back in for a sick visit and sure enough this time they found an ear infection ( they didn't 2 days prior )  She went on antibiotic and is now feeling just fine.<br>  PLEASE take her in for a sick visit and have them check her ears/throat and lungs again.  That fever is horrible...the poor hunny..she probably feels so yucky.|`|e0368de96ef1a40f9fea200af07dfd35aa	If your baby is throwing up more than 1 meal a day and is NOT wanting to move you better bring her back to the ER.

Please take baby back to ER and exaggerate the symptoms to DR's so they can help baby.|`|bMvAmMTaaa	i think you should take her back to the hospital and demand for them to do extensive checks, if you don't demand, they do as little as possible. your baby sounds really unwell and a high temp like that should not stick around for so long.<br>  <br>  hope she is ok x|`|2lpDlLLsaa	That's too long for a fever to be lingering. Take her to a different hospital.|`|mxWlNykzaa	my brother got meningitis because of his high fever go back there demand some answers be a good mother|`|iXX1LjNhaa	I would take him to the Pediatrician and have them check for RSV. My son had those same symptoms earlier this week and that is what he ended up being diagnosed with. She may need to do breathing treatments to open up her lungs. That is a really high temperature and should have been thoroughly checked into. Sometimes the x-rays don't show what they need to diagnose RSV. Especially if it's still pretty early in the onset of it.
25aCEsHtaa	well if you took the morning after pill you should be fine but their could be a slight chance you waited to late and if your on birth control i think you should be fine maybe your just thinkin to much about thats why your having some of those symptoms and your period is most the time irregular when you come off birthcontrol|`|T7pzInRZaa	Well the first time i took the pregnancy test mine came out negative too but im pregnant !!! So just wait a week or two and check again thats what i did and the second one was positive !!|`|H2IhRXIIaa	Go get a blood test done by your doctor..it could be pregnancy..but it could also be an infection from the ring...|`|2b89bf97bd46e907e67742dba26abd5daa	Plan B can make your period irregular, wait one more week retest if it still says negative, you're fine.
AA12033653	You can't get pregnant on Depo.  I was on it for 3 years and then It took 9 months for me to get a normal cycle again.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Ud1L9Wayaa	why do you and your feinca want to have a baby ASAP?|`|AA10893102	Oh really, you're 16 and engaged? When is your wedding? Amazing how you think you can make life altering decisions involving a baby and who you plan to spend the rest of your life with, but you can't even tell your mom or your doctor that you don't want the depo shot...it isn't like they can hold you down and force you to take it...I think that just by asking this question you are demonstrating that you are way to immature to be a parent.|`|AA11784984	The only way is to go off it. And even after going off it can take up to 18months to get a period back. I suggest you talk to your mom. 16 is pretty young to be starting a family.
obN6p3Cgaa	Very much helpful a baby bring joy to a family so they do any thing to help some time too much by spoiling them......|`|aLAmvX5Naa	Some are, some aren't. Some people will come over in those first few days and watch the baby for a bit so you can take a nap, or they will cook you a meal or help you clean up dishes or do a load of the baby's laundry... And some will come over and expect a new sleep-deprived mother to entertain them.|`|q7sgWqZ3aa	I can't say that all family members are helpful or not when someone has a baby. It really depends on the situation and things but I can say that my family has been helpful when I had my baby girl. They give me advice and tips. I don't expect them to care for my baby, that's my responsibility, nor do I ask them to.|`|eS9nPWqBaa	I won't be helpful - i didn't have sex with you - not my responsibility.|`|KM5MNRJmaa	probably depends on the family|`|jVjXL6HUaa	They most certainly are.|`|8MB8FtRxaa	When i had my daughter all my family was very helpful. Sometimes too help full. My mother in law gave my daughter her first bath and it really bothered me. I Guess if you have family close you need to set the ground rules but other then that if i have  a question about anything like her being sick etc.... Good luck|`|4e5c321b3099a1f6ff699e8cd693bc94aa	They sure are. but the best help that you can get to give you a break to get some rest with a new born is your mom. Mom always knows how to do things just right and not overstep her bounds. :)|`|FoGliXfvaa	Depends on the family. Do you have a supportive family? Some could care less, some could be real excited for you.|`|8YltlMsjaa	It just depends on the family, every family is different..|`|rcQgfKPTaa	yes because htey are related to the baby.<br>  and everyone likes to be with a baaby especially if they call you grandma.|`|hqK7QWl0aa	definitely because they can look after the baby and buy it nappies and clothes|`|reFCzUnwaa	YOUR BABY YOU RESPONSIBILITY !!!|`|sqmHXmKDaa	some parents.|`|ab3c2a7eb0ec5d0fc42553e7b46598f5aa	Family can be a blessing when you are a new parent, especially if this is your first child. Being able to have someone there to do things for you so you can focus on the baby is invaluable. But just remember, you call the shots. Don't let anyone steam roll you, but advice from seasoned parents is helpful.|`|sJiHpxAPaa	it depends if you live close to them or not...if they live like a street away or in your house or even like 8 minutes away then they are very helpful, but if they live like a minimum of 15 minutes away then it would b a hassle to go to your house all the time.|`|74BWeYVKaa	My parents would defenatly be helpful, but then again it depends on how close you are with your parents, and if they like kids or not.|`|089715fa1e0246f05232b43ab3085091aa	yes they are i live in waco tx and i am now in austin tx with my little brother and his new baby boy and im helping them out.|`|3743b8ec811992622443b96c9cc50f0daa	Surely|`|mg6ERQ9Aaa	No the are not they just want to spoil them.
v77SnunOaa	I would say you got any more?|`|SnQvsOPwaa	My son tell me about other parents that not only allow it but smoke with their kids. Not my thing. I don't agree with it because I have seen the outcome more then once. Good luck with that.|`|1s3nddaYaa	well i don't like smoking in general, and the smell reminds me of a skunk. i think it is nasty. i wouldn't let me son do it. your mom may have done it and thinks she shouldn't tell you not to if she done it at your age. but i have never done and i wouldn't want my son to either|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	weed never killed anyone ,,its an inert substance. I would be putting you in a rehab if it were drugs alchohal or tobacco..not weed<br>  keep your grades up ..use moderation ..|`|TBNaPkl6aa	I wouldn't be happy at all.  A teen might think he knows what he's doing and that he has everything under control, but that's not always the case.  Not everyone turns out like this, but my cousin started out with things like pot, which led to an extremely nasty addiction to crack cocaine.  The cost for him was 20 years of prison sentences and a family that fell apart.  I see no good to any kind of drug, including cigarettes.  For this reason, I know the first thing I'd do if I found out my kid was smoking pot: I'd have my (now clean) cousin come over and talk to him.|`|e8yt5PrGaa	Well Jason i would be alarmed i would be very very concerned if you were my son i wouldn't allow it unless you were doing it for medicinal purposes ..but thats a whole other issue ..<br>  <br>  I would punish you now i would sit down and ask what you think an appropriate punishment would be and we would negotiate on that ..<br>  <br>  But i would not assume that you were sniffing drugs actually i would assume you had allergies or a cold and i would take care of you ...i would be a motherly dad ..lol|`|fHjSonssaa	Honestly, I like your mom's approach.  I'm 28 years old and I have a son (who's not quite 1 yet).<br>  A lot of people might disagree with me- that's ok with me.<br>  I think that kids are going to try something if they want to- <br>  and if the kid is smart- like your mom says she is, then I guess I wouldn't worry- at least about pot.  I used to smoke a little pot.  It didn't interfere with my life- I had a great job, I was social, I just liked to smoke in the evenings when I was relaxing.  I wouldn't drive if I had smoked.  If I was going to watcha movie and be in the for the night, I'd smoke a little.  I was responsible about it though.  <br>  I sort of think that if a kid is determined to try something no matter what, they are going to figure out a way to at least try it.  So while I do think it's important that parents talk to their kids about drugs, etc, I think it's OK for them to be laid back about something like pot.  If you are that determined to continue to smoke, even if your mom disciplines you- grounds you whatever, you WILL figure out a way to continue smoking.  I think the more open parents are, the more open kids will be, which ultimately leads to a better relationship and I think, more responsible children in the long run.<br>  <br>  That said, parents still need to "parent" their children, and not ONLY take the friend approach.  I defiantely think it's important for parents to be friends though.|`|NDpO8hX4aa	well as a mother of 5 i would allow my children to smoke pot in moderation if they chose, because it is a natural plant. I would hope that they would trust enough in me in our open relationship to talk to me about it first, so they would know all the pros and cons. I wouldNOT allow them to do nothing esle though.|`|pnL5WTXMaa	she's trying too hard to be your friend and not your parent - she feels guilty about it- that is why she doesn't really trust you.|`|8VotkEXHaa	my mom did the same thing with me.  I don't think it is that uncommon but I would say we are pretty lucky :P|`|m2aznd8xaa	maybe because she does it and you dont know about it. or she did in the past.|`|BuP60uAtaa	It depends. Are you still in school and making something of yourself and your life? At 16 you could be working, which would give you less time do sit around smoking pot. Why do you smoke pot? I don't have issue with it, just think there are better things to do in life and spend money. Single moms usually do seem to be more friends than parents because they have to be. Criticism of the way children are raised only comes from people who have no children or a two-parent home. My kids were raised similarly but have respect for life, others, and the law. Youngest in College at age 20, middle one in Navy, and oldest happily married, 5 children, doing well, and certified day care provider.|`|b6EyFLgUaa	My mom knew I smoked pot after i quit ( i was your age). After alot of growing up, and learning alot of lessons. I know what pot can lead to and im lucky it never did for me. If i found out my daughter was smoking pot id be lived. I know you can live a perfectly decent life, go to college, get good grades so on and so forth but its still illegal and i wouldnt support my daughter breaking the law. I know my mom smokes pot ( she does it maybe 5 times a year) and she has done coke in in the past. If i did find out my daughter was smoking pot id sit down and have a long talk with her about it. I wouldnt call the cops on pot, i understand why people do it. There would be no support from me for her smoking it. If it did lead to anything else id give her two options, rehab or the police would be called. She would not be allowed to smoke any where near our home. Id rather have her not smoke it at all but who knows if she would listen. Shes 2 now so im hoping i never have to do that. I caught my sister smoking pot outside my moms house, i didnt call the police but i told her if i ever saw that again I would, no warning nothing. The cops would be called. My daughter was in the house,  we were in the guest room sleeping and had the window open, they were right below us. She had to get on a plane 5 hours from when she was doing it. I was livid by the selfishness that she had that night.|`|eZAz6orMaa	My opinion, smoking weed is not bad for you, its legal in california, and there are no proven effects from it...but whatever...as long as you are safe and happy that is what a parents main concern should be...and in your case it is. So your lucky you have a laid back mom who cares about ur safety and happiness, just dont take that for granted and stay away from crack :P
CdJtH0xdaa	If my son smoked pot, I'd be very disappointed and unhappy, but I'd try to help him quit. You're mother is so incredibly laid back, it's almost sickening, to be completely honest.|`|AA12071655	That's always been my attitude to my two boys (the 10yo, on the other hand, no way) who are now 20 and 18. I figure if they're going to do it, they're going to do it whether I approve or not. I talked to them about moderation, being careful, etc.<br>  <br>  It made for a more trusting relationship with them.|`|oVxr5B3Eaa	I started when I was 15. My parents found out when my friend has a party she wasn't supposed to have.. Her mom came home in the middle of the night and drove us home and told our parents we'd been smoking pot. My parent's acted freaked out and then really didn't care after my friend's mom left. By the time I was 17 I was smoking pot WITH my parents (they'd been doing it for years). <br>  Actually, the parents of MOST of my friends smoke pot. <br>  My roommate started when she was 12 and her parent's don't care. <br>  And I have tons of others friends in the same situation.... There is only 1 who's parent's don't know.. She knows her parents do but she won't tell them she does even though she's 21... Which I think would make her life a lot easier. <br>  <br>  I quit now, but it was really easy for me when my parent's were in on it, because I didn't have to try and hide it and lie from them, I could actually say "i need a ride because we're going to get high and I don't like to drive when I"m high". and stuff like that. <br>  <br>  BUt I know other people's parent's aren't as lenient. Maybe your mom smoked pot when she was younger too so she understands. Or maybe she still does!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  You can totally tell the difference in answers of people who have done it and people who haven't. Once you've done it, you'd know its not that bad...|`|pOZubuOcaa	I would let him continue the Pot as long as its not an everyday type of habit and as long as he is safe about it.  If all he did was smoke everyday after school then i would make him stop and i wouldn't allow it<br>  <br>  i would however inform him that its an illegal drug to possess and that you could get in trouble for having it|`|rB3cyt0Paa	I'm not a parent but I would be so freaked out!!!<br>  <br>  I'm not lecturing but you need to stop|`|ZAppRn5Faa	wow your mom is quite layed back, but in perspective i think she's quite understanding also and understands how its so easy to get stuff like that and become a part of it. I'm not a parent yet, but I know if I did that and my parents found out they'd probably be really ashamed and disappointed in me that i gave into what everyone else was doing. I'm not judging you for smoking its none of my business and quite frankly I dont mind I have friends who do and I'm very understanding. If you need any help or advice just email me (: hope i could help|`|QJf2XNaTaa	I wouldn't like it. I won't lecture you on it, because I know so many people who smoke weed, and though it is bad for you and significantly decreases your sperm count, I won't lecture you. Just be careful with it, and don't bring it to school!|`|oVeuknIRaa	Smoking is bad!! Just kidding :) Well I am 100% against smoking ANYTHING or Drugs for that matter so I'd be pretty POed. But that's just me|`|Dx0gzewraa	Pot aint dat bad ....weed is where its at|`|596ba0725523b654ae88f9a7d31dae51aa	I'd be extremely disappointed. And I'd take away every single last bit of freedom and fun that I could. For a long, long time. <br>  Your mom-- she's pretty irresponsible. Breaking the law and doing drugs is OK with her?! I would expect a responsible parent to explain to you that it really isn't safe to inhale smoke from anything that is burning. I'd also expect her to expect that you not break the law. I also expect that she'd lecture you on the possible impact this could have on your future. Looks like it is up to you to try to think clearly through your drug addled haze, and try to live right, because you're getting sh**ty guidance.|`|6CtbDjZVaa	I hate the effects that pot has, so I would be against you mom. I don't even want my kids to know about pot.  I smoked it more than 5 years ago and I hated it.  I never plan on doing it again.
NaJPIOheaa	you need to be relaxed, lay in a comfortable position, and get some lubricant like ky jelly his and hers, or astro glide, try and find something that isn't sticky. good luck xo|`|yUyx2nhmaa	you need lubrication. you can buy gels/oils these days.|`|M3b25kRYaa	Well, there are a few possible reasons why you were having difficulty. Unfortunately, due to crappy sex ed in many school systems many people do not have a good understanding of their own anatomy. The best way to make sure you know your anatomy is to check it out yourself (i.e. masturbation). Also, having your boyfriend use his fingers and tongue to explore you can help him understand your anatomy, and, in a double shot, also get you lubricated real well. This leads to the 2nd most reasonable cause of the difficulty. Sex does require a good bit of lubrication to be pleasurable (and sometimes even to actually happen). Some women are more naturally lubricated than others, if you are one of the drier ladies, don't be afraid. There are plenty of commercially available lubrications available in the drug store. But the most fun way to get lubricated is extended foreplay. This can also stretch and relax your pelvic muscles and allow your boyfriend to more easily penetrate. This is probably the 3rd most likely cause.. you seem to be a virgin, and the 1st time can be scary. Sometimes we women clamp down when we're scared. This will make penetration very difficult and not pleasurable.<br>  Lastly, and least likely, is that you have a full hymen that is not broken. Women's hymens can be practically non-existant, or they can be fully covering the vaginal opening, and anywhere in between. However, if you've ever used a tampon or had a pelvic exam that pretty much rules this one out.<br>  I have a link to a discussion board that has an interesting discussion on this, it's <a href="http://www.askdanandjennifer.com/forums/sex-tips-advice/3021-how-have-sex.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.askdanandjennifer.com/forums/...</a> I think you'll find it helpful, as well as many of the links and videos available there. I know I do!|`|oHNrktxTaa	It sounds like you were dry. Try foreplay prior to intercourse. It will help increase blood flow & increase arousal. If this doesn't work, than perhaps you need help with the use of lubrication/gels.<br>  <br>  Good Luck:)
74BWeYVKaa	your pregnant!!!!!!!!|`|YMnTveWuaa	See a doctor.|`|NuJako4gaa	..? idk|`|xGlqXMRAaa	I had the same thing happen to me as far as your symptoms. My first weeks were all about the cramping and the cravings.  I normally really dislike taco bell but for the first weeks taco bell was all i wanted.  I was constantly tired, like if I hadn't slept.  The next step is the fun part :S morning sickness.  So yes its very possible! Congrats if you are!|`|vP3Tu9SVaa	You need to see your OBGYN about this.|`|BeXHzsSwaa	i do think your pregnant but this could also just be your imagination as well. the best thing to do is get tested!|`|NTrBagbHaa	Sounds like you're prego to me! all the symptoms...|`|HA5ml3fmaa	I think you are pregnant.|`|SwJIeyCJaa	I think you are possibly pregnant.|`|xjOuU24iaa	Sorry but you prego!!!!!<br>  my baby momma had the exact same thing|`|mC9bkM7laa	go to your doctor!
8oAlBL91aa	Okay you would think most women would say it's wonderful but I'm not one of those women, I freaking hate being pregnant right now. I cannot stand that I can't sleep on my back or my stomach, I hate being tired all the time no matter what I do, I want to be able to stand on my feet for longer than 20 minutes before my back starts to hurt, I want to eat what I want without having horrible heart burn, I want to be able to get up from sitting on the couch or toilet, I don't like being kicked in the bladder, so if you haven't already guessed I am not a fan of being pregnant...But I can say this it is all worth it in the end because I will have a beautiful baby boy in my arms to love forever.|`|AA10458750	special, it makes you become a  more grown & stronger woman bc of it.|`|XzbRZCPUaa	i guess it would have to do with what stage you are in...... when you find out ... shocked, excited  a couple months into it..... tired ,nausea's .....around 4 /5 months .... have energy and feel good towards the end ....huge in pain and ready to be done !|`|QM6wiVtVaa	How does it feel to breath?<br>  How does it feel to sneeze?<br>  <br>  You can't describe pregnancy to someone who hasn't been pregnant any easier than you can answer those questions.|`|3505983107c631451310c5009361ae76aa	tiring, strange, amazing, exciting, its feels a million different ways :)|`|2B2fgmw9aa	weird, lol.....and amazing.....and exhausting....and exciting....|`|xGlqXMRAaa	Physically like your permanently bloated especially the first couple of months when you are trying to get use to the changes in your body.  Plus the morning sickness doesnt help either.  It gets better as you get farther along, well at least until your so huge that everything is uncomfortable lol.  But its worth it at the end lol.|`|uNzFexpRaa	Brilliant!<br>  <br>  Im on my 9th pregnancy (had 8 previous miscarriages with my ex husband and this is baby #1 with my fiancee) so this pregnancy is also quite a scary time.<br>  <br>  Ive been dreadfully sick, manic backache, cant stop going to the toilet, putting on weight like mad, no appitite, awful headaches - Im loving EVERY SECOND of it!!!!! I know that baby is healthy and swimming around and its the best feeling in the world!|`|2NYtMGMwaa	Well for me it was a godsend...I loved being pregnant with both of my pregnancies...I felt special because everywhere i went people were courteous and kind to me and i just felt amazing. I never was sick for either one so that made it all better...i had a glow and everybody noticed it..I was so happy being pregnant i didn't want it to end...but now i'm even more happy with my girls..i couldn't ask for anything more!|`|FoGliXfvaa	yup its exhausting! the first couple months is hard but after that its just unexplainable.
AA11138222	Toddlers are constantly learning. They learn through experiences, not through sitting down and looking at shapes and colors all day. They are sensory learnings, which means they learn through exploration (touching, tasting, smellling, etc) Teach them shapes and colors by pointing out things around them that are a certain shape or color.|`|4259a8b8fa5899f30c0e319fda9936fdaa	My play time with my daughter (who is 2 years old) includes all of the above things.  Sometimes we do more "formal" learning games, like puzzles, shape sorter, etc.  But we also play chase, and she's learned "stop and go", she's learned imitation through chase.....sometimes i make faces, which she imitates.  We also work on body parts all the time....in the tub (i'm gonna wash your....), while eating (wipe your.....).  when we go outside we talk about all the things there is in nature...trees, animals, colors, shapes, textures, temperature, etc.  And, sometimes our "play" time is just down time where we cuddle and watch some movies.|`|JIxAVONXaa	Children learn through play, not sitting and doing rote work, parent/teacher directed activity and dictation. Honestly sitting down with a toddler to do flash cards and to drill into their heads shapes, colors, alphabet, numbers etc is not doing them a favor, it actually turns them off of learning all together. <br>  <br>  Children learn basic concepts like those mentioned above through their own play, through child directed and process oriented play. Children have a natural want and need to learn, they constantly challenge themselves above their actual ability and learn much faster and efficiently when THEY choose what they learn, how they learn it, when they learn it. <br>  <br>  Enjoy your child and play with them, join into their play don't initiated it and make every moment a teaching moment. Your child is already learning through her experiances and evironment.|`|tkqV2CI5aa	Play with them as in fun, taking your baby outside, walking, the park, etc. Then have a time to teach the baby things, read to them, teach them things you want them to learn, have a time for each little thing you do and take time to do it. There's a difference in playing and teaching them to learn while playing. Children learn thru out the day in the things they do all day, there learning new things 24/7 as they get older from a toddler.|`|4mmMTfTVaa	When I say play it can mean anything.  I do not set aside a learning time with my two year old because he is always learning.  He learned his letters, shapes, colors, numbers, animals, etc by playing and reading books.  I take extra effort to continually use new words and show him new things and concepts.|`|rnOJn2UCaa	All of the above! its all about interacting with your child for that time and enjoying each others company. You can build blocks and make up a story. Sing ring a ring a rosie after wards. Give high fives when you toddler stacks a block, etc anything can be play...have fun!
HBgnkltfaa	I love the name Gideon.  It would be #1 on my boys' list except for the fact that our last name starts with G.  I tend to like three-syllable names for boys, and since this one ends in N, it fits in well with popular boys' names of today.  Plus, the biblical Gideon has a very neat story.<br>  <br>  Saul is cool, though, too.  It has a bit of a bad-boy image, I think, but it's a good underused biblical choice.|`|AA11784984	I like Gideon and not just out of the 2. I actually like that name.|`|1Du4Rudvaa	Out of those two I would choose Saul.|`|UKPYoPKuaa	Saul, I think of Gideon as a womans name.|`|wRHhpanmaa	Gideon is really pretty for a boys name. <br>  You must be picking a bible name.<br>   You could name him Gideon Michael... that sounds really cute.<br>  <br>  but yep.. im getting carried away with myself. Gideon is a really pretty.|`|F2cVt5jaaa	Well Saul wasn't exactly a good person in the bible actually a bad person. Like King Saul. Go with Paul because Saul was a disciple that changed his name to Paul. Gideon is good. I like Gideon the best.|`|Fa130w6Gaa	I really don't like either but having to pick, I'd say Gideon is the better of the 2.|`|fapk8NXNaa	i hate them both, but saul is better, even though it makes a person sound as if they were a terrorist|`|l4gqo2LBaa	I hate Gideon the least|`|z4blIUneaa	the one i hate the least is saul!|`|R1cey1Evaa	Saul is nice, but how do you pronounce Gideon?|`|51d57483d1f6319218c2bc7c948690b7aa	I like the name Gideon but it makes me think of a giddy person.  i wouldn't want my little boy to be called Giddy|`|xfxlpT2Waa	they are unique but i wouldnt name my children that. but i dont hate them though|`|m3iPgBWFaa	Saul makes me think of Saula like Simon Cowell and Paula Abdul|`|IuzaNq2Uaa	I really like the name Gideon.<br>  <br>  To me, Saul doesn't sound nice (too much like sore? or sour?) and has a weak ending. Also, Saul is probably not the most sympathetic character in the Old Testament and committed suicide, so the story doesn't have much appeal.
H0fXySX9aa	the further along you get the more the HCG level in your urine rises the darker they will get<br>  congrats|`|iNBLWIFKaa	It doesn't matter how dark they are. If there is a faint line, it is 100% positive. All of my positives came out with a lighter test line, even when I was 6 months pregnant with twins and took one just for fun. <br>  <br>  Why do you want it to be darker anyway?|`|uNzFexpRaa	How far past your period are you? They always say that even a 'faint positive' is positive so try again in a few weeks. HPT work by measuring the levels of HCG in your body and that is something that only shows up when you are pregnant, maybe your still not too far along to show a higher level. They do get darker!|`|f5yf9t3Haa	They will stay faint...if u decided 2 take one in a few days or so it should get darker. So faints r positive! I took cheap dollar store tests.|`|jD4lixSVaa	I used the internet tests too. They were faint for a few days then got darker!  I hope its normal =)
ROJans2Taa	when I went for mine, they spent around 10-15 Min's getting measurements, checking the spine, the fluid and overall look of the baby, to me they rarely said anything, I kept asking, does everything look ok? and they would reply "oh yes dear, just need more measurements" then they turn the monitor towards me and then allow my husband in, and she showed us our babies feet, hands, face ect. asked if we were interested in the sex, we said yes, she moved towards the "parts' and showed us his little penis and ect. apparently while doing this she was also snapping pics and then printed off 4 different ones for us. in my experience they keep quiet and only tell you things when they are completed, yet I kept asking questions anyway,lol. congrats and best luck|`|QM6wiVtVaa	Yes your husband will be able to go, my mother and husband both went to mine.<br>  <br>  You can find out the sex if you want to, either way you need to tell the technician as soon as you go in if you want to know the sex or not. Some will tell you without asking, others won't tell you unless you specifically ask to find out the sex.<br>  <br>  They measure everything. Legs, arms, head, heart, brain, amniotic fluid, everything.<br>  <br>  You don't have to do anything during the ultrasound personally, just lay back and relax.|`|28QPS6V9aa	Ultrasounds are fun! I love them! They will have you lay down and raise your shirt a little, then they will put some warm gel on your belly and then begin. They check the measurements, the placenta, they make sure all the vital organs have been formed and if you want to know the sex they do their best to find out what it is. Afterwords they send the pictures and measurements to your doctor. Mine lasted about an hour and the technician couldn't determine the sex of my baby, we did everything to get the baby to move so we could see between the legs, walking, going to the bathroom, drinking water but nothing helped. So after about a half hour of trying we gave up and left. I'm 31 weeks pregnant and I still don't know the sex of our baby. :(|`|FjGeKhY0aa	Yes, your husband can come in and you can find out the sex. They measure everything to make sure all parts (head, arms,legs, etc.) and organs are developing at the same time and there are no problems. It will take about 15 min total.
6ZjoX2Akaa	I also had very hungry babies. So he doesn't wake up so often in the night at his dinner time feeding (not the last one before bed), try mixing a little bit of Gerber Rice cereal in his formula. Mix it really sloppy at first (for about 2 weeks) and feed it to him with his bottle. You will have to cut a bigger slit in the nipple. If after a couple weeks he does good gradually make it thicker until you can't feed it to him thru a bottle anymore (a couple weeks at a time). That got my kids fuller and they were able to sleep longer at night especially. The doctors always say not to give them cereal until they are around 4 mos but they also told me that some babies are hungrier than others and Rice cereal is the easiest on their stomaches.|`|bMvAmMTaaa	have you tried formula for hungrier babies, it might keep him full for 1-2 more hours. but as long as he is gaining weight properly and healthy, then there isn't really a problem. soon the amount he will need to eat in one time will increase and he wont need to be fed as often. you just have to be patient, my daughter is 4 months now and has 7oz of hungrier baby formula every 4 hours, and i have started giving her baby rice between bottles.<br>  <br>  stick in there, it will get easier. x|`|dnRte8U7aa	It is totally normal for a one month old to be eating every two hours!<br>  <br>  My girl is almost four months old, and she still eats this often on most days.  Their tummies are tiny, so they need to eat more frequently.  That's just the way it is until they grow and their stomachs get bigger and able to hold more.  <br>  <br>  Don't worry if you hear about someone else's baby only eating every 4 hours and sleeping through the night.  Every single baby is different.  Yours just likes to eat every two hours!  There is absolutely nothing to worry about.|`|4jbiS9hvaa	This is <unfortunately> typical for a 1 month old baby; it may be a pain in the butt for you but it really is typical.  Babies will eat around the clock until about 2-3 months old before they start to establish a better routine.  His eating pattern is the pattern that is best for him and he will change it as his body needs.  I feel for ya with the sleeplessness but this will pass :-)|`|e0368de96ef1a40f9fea200af07dfd35aa	Give him 6 ozs then at night mabe like after 3AM give him some water. Doctors say not to give babies water til like after 6 months which is so stupid but really if he is eating every 2-3 hrs then he is getting enough milk.  Give him the water (4ozs)around the 3AM feeding. He either may get full and prob not wake up for later bc he really wanted milk and u tricked him with water.  Babies are so freakin smart so trust me Maybe this will help. Rem not too much water. When he is almost 3 months give him cereal when he sleeps at nite. Start off with half a spoon . He must be nice and chunky drinking all that milk. Good luck.
cJRFbZUaaa	Pregnancy length is usually measured from the first day of the last period, as that is a known event.  Conception can occur at about two weeks from the last period but not always.  So there's variation in development among babies of the same gestational age.  If the early ultrasound shows the development being way off from the dates, the doctor will assign a new due date.  That happened to me, but it was also due to my giving the wrong dates.|`|H0fXySX9aa	the fetus is always 2 weeks behind after conception<br>  my baby at 20 weeks weighed a pound so 7 ounces is good|`|cj7sSPZEaa	My son was born at 18 weeks and he was 8 oz, so 7oz is pretty normal for 17 weeks.  A pregnancy is calculated from the first day of your last period, which in your case would be 17 weeks ago, but generally conception takes place about two weeks after your last period, which makes the baby 15 weeks developmentally but still you are at 17 weeks gestation based on your LMP.
CpiLHcTlaa	at 23 weeks i got one at a 3d clinic and he had put his foot on top of his head and blocked his face. it seemed no matter what we did he ALWAYS had his face covered! though he showed other parts quite openly!  at 20 weeks the girl put the thing on him and he flipped over so we couldn't see him! later on when ever someone put something on my stomach he would kick at it. it made the nurses laugh when i had to get no stress tests and they watched it bounce!|`|3505983107c631451310c5009361ae76aa	im 24 weeks at the mo. at my 13 weeks ultrasound the baby was doing somersaults too and then it looked like it was running the way the hands and legs were going. its was crazy :) don't have my next one until 30 weeks tho so have another 6 weeks to wait until i see how the baby is doing in there. cant wait. its such an amazing thing to see what there up to in there isnt it|`|TFuCMwUWaa	8 weeks - seeing the heartbeat was amazing<br>  10 weeks- seeing the baby<br>  12 weeks - he was sucking his thumb<br>  19 weeks - finding out it was a boy - he was not shy with showing his parts..lol<br>  23 weeks - waving motions were precious<br>  The last 5 ultrasounds he has been head down and mainly just kicking, and trying to roll|`|f4zg7LHLaa	at the 12 week one, he kept bouncing around like a jumping bean! it was hilarous that there was that tiny "person" bouncing around, but i couldn't feel him yet! <br>  <br>  oh, and at the 34 week, the tech wouldn't tell us if he was a boy or a girl, but was pointing to 2 unmistakable things on the screen! :)|`|FEW9Uap5aa	At my 28 week 3D scan my little boy kept on eating his cord! haha! but it was so cute. <br>  He was also trying to chew on his foot which we found so adorable and he was holding on his little willy while we were looking for his gender.|`|ArkvdaPoaa	I just saw the baby move a lot and I also was able to see the bones that were forming, I think this was the most interesting thing that I saw with my baby.|`|eDmdkUO3aa	My little boy kept flashing us his private area. He wanted to make sure we didn't have no pink things for him!|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	My daughter was opening & closing her mouth at my 20wk scan, she reminded me of a fish!|`|ROJans2Taa	my son at his 12 week appt, kept standing on his head, I have an U/S photo showing him constantly on his head, he'd lie for maybe 3-5 secs then turn on his head again, the tech was having a hard time getting measurements,lol. they are too cute in there|`|AA10458750	the first ultrasound, I liked the lady doing it and my baby waved to me and did little "poses" ohh and was sucking his thumb,too cute! the second one I had done for the 20 week scan, well I didn't not like that lady or how rough she was with my stomach....that time my baby put his hands over his head and curled up in al little ball, he didn't like her either lol!|`|lGcpXteaaa	My daughter was sucking her thumb at my 20 week ultrasound, at the 21 week scan she was kicking her legs non stop the whole time. <br>  Thats why we couldnt find out the gender! <br>  Oh well im glad she did that because it was amazing not knowing until birth, i wouldnt have been able to wait otherwise!!|`|75l2smfCaa	At 9 Weeks our tyke looked straight at us and moved its hand back and forth like it was waving!!! It was a little creepy, like it could see us lol!! But it was adorable none the less. I want to see mine do a summersault. Im jealous :)|`|9776485a7510046fa4388cd98356e6d6aa	She was rubbing her hands over her eyes.
NTrBagbHaa	You should take a test :o)|`|qaMrAspCaa	I'm pretty sure that taking the pill is going out of your way to not try. But anyways, you can get pregnant on the pill. My best friend got pregnant on the pill twice. She's happily married with two kids now, but she swears up and down that she took the pill everyday at the same time. So it's possible.  And that does sound like it could be implantation bleeding, esp 10 before you period.
tkqV2CI5aa	if this is your first, it's usually around 20 or so weeks you start feeling good movement or kicking, if it's your second like mine, i felt around 16 weeks. But give it a little more time, as long as your feeling a little movement, that's good.|`|ArkvdaPoaa	I did not start feeling my baby until the end of the sixth month.  I think it is normal and sometimes the baby is probably moving you just probably don't notice it, especially if this is your first baby.|`|ROJans2Taa	every women is different some dont feel until 22-24 weeks, others around 16 weeks, it depends on how baby is turned and also if your overweight or not, at 19 weeks, lack of feel able movements is normal, that's why it's not until around 28 weeks they start requesting the kick counts, congrats and good luck|`|3505983107c631451310c5009361ae76aa	im 24 weeks now and its only really in the last 3 weeks that im starting to feel proper movement. the bigger your baby gets the more your gonna feel it move. congrats :)
c26ifpPDaa	you can do the water test.  get a cup of water and take the fluid and put in in the cup of water.  if it sinks in a glob it is ewcm if it floats and comes apart it is semen.|`|oHNrktxTaa	It is difficult to differentiate between the two, but it sounds like ovulation. The give away sign is that your ewcm is stringy & stretchy.<br>  Usually the semen is slimy, but doesnt stretch.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps:)<br>  GOOD LUCK & Happy Baby Dancing!|`|Fa130w6Gaa	Honestly, it could be either. They are pretty much the same consistency. If you are unsure of when you are ovulating, try taking ovulation tests. I started out getting the 21 day supply but was able to figure out when in my cycle I was ovulating and then just had to get the 7 day supply for a couple of months. We also had been ttc #3 for 14 months but I finally had a positive pregnancy test this AM. Don't give up, keep trying and it will happen! Good luck and lots of baby dust to you!!
Sd3kXRgGaa	A trip to a third world country for a week to show how over-privilaged they are.<br>  <br>  spoiled brats.|`|RVxI2cR5aa	Okay, Im a 15 year old and i like good smelling things:D<br>  maybe you can go to bath & body works, get her a little gift set there for i think it 15$ or 20$ i think she would be able to understand the fact that you want to save money for bigger & better things in your life other then going and spending a load of money on her birthday. But congrats on the new baby:D!!|`|pauzBlpgaa	If they don't appreciate anything, what's the point of even trying? When i was younger i got the 20$ in the card and was happy with it. i think you should go with that.|`|8VotkEXHaa	maybe you can bake her a really nice cake or something that shows you put effort into it.. but if she's one of those spoiled brats just get her a gift card for one of those aeropostale stores or something|`|G9wEDvedaa	i would give her a 20 dollar gift card for hmv or the movies.<br>  <br>  but dont be too worried, if shes that spoiled she shouldnt deserve anything... im 15 and i would never do that s**t|`|tKb7i5jtaa	Either give her a gift card, or a fish from petsmart. Also, a card saying, "YOU BRAT!"|`|GRXq0Xdwaa	i think u should just give her the 20 dollars and tell her deal with it. not everyone has all that stuff.|`|GwWiaWI7aa	i like Benji's idea!! :P|`|GrJzw8usaa	Try giving her a gift card from iTunes or one of the store she likes. Most websites have the feature to purchase one online and print it out online. Also, along with a gift card, you could get her a cute accessory to go with her iPod or iPhone. When I was fifteen, I love gift cards because I could buy anything and not worry about receiving something I did not like. Good Luck!|`|HOf4JMcYaa	Just get her like 20-30$ and a card. She will appreciate it and if she truly can't then she is too spoiled. Or get her a giftcard for $30 to a store she likes. Or amex giftcard! Thats great.|`|OgKuUeC5aa	take her out to a nice lunch or dinner and spend quality time and even make the people sing her a nice happy birthday its kinda cheesy but i always get a good laugh and let her pick the restaraunt<br>  <br>  hoped i helped|`|9b03089dbffd92fe43d3dd5aaef975f0aa	tell he **** you. your a spoiled girl that takes after her mother. i wouldnt be friends with poeple like that|`|SHwuzsPyaa	uuuum<br>  <br>  NOTHING?|`|oTmylEGUaa	nothing.|`|clZNh1VWaa	a one way ticket to Siberia|`|hlhF8Inuaa	Teach her the lesson. :)|`|IYdgEQ4kaa	A book. Book store gift card? Along with some hand baked treat and a kick in the **** for being unappreciative?|`|SnQvsOPwaa	You get her a job so she learn something that she will have the rest of her life.|`|ROJans2Taa	gift card for the movies or a resturant, or even to get her nails/hair done, maybe depending on your budget  spa treatment, teens love it, best luck|`|a8IRxC4raa	Make a donation to a charity in her honor.  You can't control whether it is appreciated, but you'll know your money isn't being wasted.<br>  <br>  You also have the option to give her nothing, which is a fine choice for someone who doesn't appreciate your efforts.<br>  <br>  All the best.|`|m2aznd8xaa	dont worry about what they think ,you give what you can afford and if they say something tell them be happy i got you something at all. you worry about your kids and your future right now.  and they need to learn its the thought that counts.|`|6eGZGEw4aa	I agree, you could make her something handmade. Is she related to you? Are you close to her? I would maybe put a nice picture in a nice frame of the two of you, if you have one. If not, a nice card and $20 works just fine.|`|089e8d35b7463b74daf5b60e025ccdc5aa	I think, considering the times we are living in, you would be doing her a HUGE favor to get her something that does not continue the spoiling.  I suggest going to changethepresent.com, finding a gift that is in your price range, buy it for her and have them send her a card that says "Happy birthday--you saved a polar bear" or "Happy birthday--a child in Africa can get a vaccination thanks to you."<br>  <br>  Be a force for good in her life, and don't worry about what she or her mother thinks.  If her mother is snarky enough to say somehting to you, say, you know, our world is going through a tough time and I feel like we should all be part of the solution, so it struck me as a lovely gift.
OQFd3pl5aa	I've been using the monitor for about 9 months or so. The first cycle using the monitor, a lot of women, including myself, do not get a peak reading. It is very common. Some women do and some women don't. I personally got about 18 days of high readings the first month I used it, with no peak, which is normal for the first month of use. You may have threw it off a bit by not testing yesterday. The first month the monitor gets to know you, and become familiar with your hormone levels, so it is very important to test everyday. The second month it will work like a charm. For the meantime I would follow the signs your body is giving you and have sex accordingly. It is possible that you've already ovulated, but keep up with the baby dancing for a few more days to cover all bases. Keep an eye on your chart, and also know that the sticks are not meant to be read visually. And remember you may not get a peak this month at all, due to it being the first month, and also due to missing a day of testing. The day you missed might have been the day you would've gotten your peak reading/the day you ovulated. <br>  <br>  Good luck to you and lots of baby dust coming your way :)|`|5axGfFofaa	I have used the monitor 2 times and ended up pregnant with it both times.  This month my body did not exactly match the monitor but I had sex on the peak days (not with my body signs)...and just got my BFP this week!  (I have had 2 m/c's so I hope this baby sticks!)  You may not have ovulated or the monitor may not give you a peak or you missed it by not testing.  In the future, try not to skip any days so you do not miss that peak.  The more you do it during high increases the amount of sperm you will have up there ready and waiting for that egg to drop!!  Good luck and I hope you get your BFP soon!|`|oHNrktxTaa	This was my first month too using the Clear Blue Easy Fertility Monitor!  We just tried on the two PEAK days. I figured these are the best days to conceive & will help maximize your chances.<br>  <br>  Well, unfortunately, I just got my AF this morning:( I suggest trying a day or two prior to the peak days as well. <br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK & BABY DUST!

WGXdfh22aa	yes because the baby and you both get the hang of how it works. as the baby gets older they understand how to latch on and it just become easier because you both understand what needs to be done.|`|qBtTAgBqaa	The first 6-8 weeks of breastfeeding is probably the most challenging. And as you did, most moms will give up.<br>  <br>  The key to making it through these early weeks is to educate yourself. Surround yourself with support. Get involved in a LaLeche League in your area before the baby comes. That way once baby is here, you've already established a support system, somone you can turn to in times of struggle.<br>  <br>  Arm yourself with lots of knowledge. Like for instance, did you know that fussiness at the breast is NORMAL? That babies go through growth spurts during with baby will want to nurse what seems like around the clock? Moms who aren't aware of these growth spurts often think they don't have enough milk. But on the contrary, it's your babies way of following the natural supply and demand of breast milk production.<br>  <br>  Check out www.kellymom.com  Bookmark the site and visit it often. There's even a forum where you can post your concerns and questions. kellymom is probably the best breastfeeding site out there. Pick up the Breastfeeding Book by Dr. William Sears.<br>  <br>  During the next two months before your baby comes, you can read, learn, talk, attend meeting, take classes. Do all you can to prepare yourself. And most importantly, start thinking with the attitude that, "yes I CAN do this" "I WILL be successful"<br>  <br>  Here are a couple links to get you started.

For me it took about 6 weeks before I really had no problems.  If your worried already try looking into a lactation consultant or breastfeeding clinics now so you can be prepared if you have any problems.|`|uMIvRRjoaa	Absolutely!! All the LC's say the first 6 weeks are the hardest and then it improves. If you read up ahead of time and *know* that it will get better after those first 6 weeks it makes it a lot easier to get through, kwim? Kellymom has some excellent info to help you out:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/bf/start/prepare/bf-links-goodstart.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/bf/start/prepare...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/bf/normal/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/bf/normal/index....</a><br>  <br>  Now, that isn't to say that you won't be challenged later in the nursing relationship. Babies can get distractible, they get their teeth in etc- but all of it *can* be gotten through if you are armed with the knowledge you need. If you can go to a LLL meeting and find a *good* IBCLC to help you out with an issues those first few weeks. <br>  <br>  GL!!|`|dnRte8U7aa	It got easier for me, and now it's a breeze.  The first couple of weeks are the hardest, and when most mothers give up because of sore nipples, etc.  My nipples were cracked and bleeding, and I had to clench my teeth and sometimes fight back tears for several days early on, but you know what?  I stuck it out.  Because that's what mothers do for their babies.  Painful nipples were NOT enough reason to rob my child of her milk and all of those amazing lifelong health benefits.<br>  <br>  After two weeks or so, both of us finally "got it" and it became much, much easier.  Get the help of a lactation consultant or a home-visit nurse from the hospital to improve baby's latch.  The sooner and more often you ask for assistance, the sooner it will shift from a "frustrating" experience to a wonderful one.<br>  <br>  Congrats and good luck!|`|5c500787631901c9ca4d11eaca666897aa	YES!! MUCH!! I have been bfing for the past 2 months and the first month I wanted to quit so bad becuase it was sooo frustrating! But everyone said to hang in there and they were right. There's still some frustrating points but it's MUCH better now. Oh and i recommend seeing a lactation specialis-some are too over zealous but they still can be a big help when you need some encouragement.|`|AA12373801	Yes it gets much easier. I had to pump for my son his first 2 weeks. But I couldn't handle having to wake up every two hours to prepare a bottle and feed him then pump after it was just too much. So one day I was like no more I'm breastfeeding you kid! We co-slept for about a week and I would always offer my breast first. He did fuss at first but he learned hey Mom has more then my bottle and bam that's it! We only use bottles on or trips out.|`|m1RTNmqsaa	My daughter was born preemie and in the NICU and it did not get any better for me.<br>  <br>  I was stressed to the max. I was waking up every 2 hours and pumping as I couldn't put her to the breast. I did everything the exact way the laction-ist told me to do. Id pump and only get a few drops, and Id be lucky to get that!<br>  <br>  I wanted to do it for the benefits, but it just didn't work out for me. I guess thats why they make formula even tho that wasnt my plans!|`|t1fx6kXcaa	I found the first 5 months difficult and frustrating. The three weeks before my son started solids, he was breastfeeding every half hour for more than an hour, around the clock. I wanted to give up because he was barely sleeping and I was exhausted. Because my son breastfed so much and so often, I found it difficult to get out of the house as well. But, I hung in there and I'm very glad I did. The health benefits were worth those few months of inconvenience to me. He's now 23 months and still breastfed. He rarely gets sick and when he does he recovers within hours. Breastfeeding does get easier. I can barely remember how difficult those first few months were. If you  prepare yourself for the fact that your newborn will want to breastfeed frequently and often, then it will be easier to hang in there. If you have any problems, seek immediate help from a lactation consultant.<br>  Good luck.
wjGj6uU3aa	I think the first day to go by for your period is the day you had the spotting. Even though it was just spotting it is still a period.|`|tkqV2CI5aa	That light bleeding was probably the start of it letting you know that your going to start, i did the same thing. First it was light and then WHAM, heavy the next day until it ended.|`|3505983107c631451310c5009361ae76aa	the light bleeding started yesterday so id count that as the first day|`|cc3bc74da528c9ab08e77b61000dc40faa	yesterday is ur first day|`|AA11784984	You started the bleeding yesterday so I would say yesterday was the first day of your period.
H0fXySX9aa	the next thing would be a blood test to test the HCG good luck|`|cc3bc74da528c9ab08e77b61000dc40faa	I would go to the ER just to be safe, they will give you a more thorough exam, a blood test will tell iif you are pregnant, and find a new gyn. an ectopic pregnancy can, but not always, be serious. It will give you peace of mind to know what is wrong. Better safe than sorry

Tartism is another word for a troll that has nothing better to do all day.|`|98qMZZPlaa	Hi Bri<br>  Your right. I guess it is a touchy subject because parents do not want to admit what they are doing to their children. I am not claiming to have all the answers, but I am so tired of seeing parents treating their kids as their best buds rather than raising them. <br>  Tartism refers to when children are running their parents lives instead of being taught or disciplined. When a dad takes his son, let's say age 4 or 5 to a store and the kid starts screaming and acting out, no one in the store wants to see this. The father needs to remove the kid but instead says"oh buddy its okay. Blah blah blah Buddy". Etc Etc Etc. Just one example, but there are so many instances of Tartism but the dumb a** idiots on here find it easier to just ignore it rather than be a parent|`|0d8fd99482e78511337c03d547560306aa	I just asked this question and here were my answers:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ag8rJ6bE1NeEdJQAGuhSSnfty6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090305050940AAIlRuK">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|tBtOTiQDaa	i have no idea<br>  does it have anything to do with tartar sauce?<br>  i love tartar sauce, yummmm|`|7jXChfBNaa	i am intereted in seeing what answers you get cause i have no idea what it is either lol.|`|VuUz8NgKaa	It is nothing but crap.
mCQZrp1zaa	If you haven't had sex since you got your period, you're not likely pregnant. The other stuff is probably just coincidental. However, if you're worried a home test can give you a for certain answer quickly, and for relatively little money.|`|EZ2iLwJXaa	Take a test and go to the doctor. It's the only way to be sure. You might want to get on a pill too cuz it will help the cramps.
S5dfa6o9aa	My nephew (he's one year) he has always loved picture books even since he was super new and little. I don't think you can go wrong with baby picture books. =]<br>  <br>  Love: Meg|`|AiJeS6I1aa	For books, I like:<br>  <br>  -Baby! Baby! by Vicky Ceelen (beautiful picture book for infants with lots of cute pics of babies and animals)<br>  <br>  -Baby Cakes by Karma Wilson<br>  <br>  -The Very Hungry Caterpillar by Eric Carle<br>  <br>  -Goodnight Moon by Margaret Wise Brown<br>  <br>  -Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See? by Bill Martin Jr and Eric Carle<br>  <br>  -anything by Dr. Seuss<br>  <br>  **Make sure you get board books for young babies.  They will destroy anything else**<br>  <br>  Also, "collections" are very nice, but they will be used more when the babies are older.  You can get the complete tales of Beatrix Potter, Winnie the Pooh, Curious George, Dr. Seuss<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Oh!  I almost forgot!  The following is the BEST children's album I have ever heard (and we listened to a LOT when we were growing up).  It was recorded in 1978, but is timeless.  It is not available in stores, but you can get the album on MP3 download from Amazon.com at a very reasonable price.  You can also sample the songs before you buy.  I highly recommend.  I still sing these songs fondly with my sisters, and now to my baby.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Pockets-Songs-for-Little-People/dp/B000QR3X38" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Pockets-Songs-for-...</a>|`|Jl6a1fxzaa	Hitler: His Life and Times, My Favorite Jew and The Notebook.  All are really good books for children younger than 5.|`|hWe8vhKKaa	the best books you can buy are the ones that you can sing along they will pay more attention  my baby is also 3 1/2 months and he loves em you can get them from mother care.<br>  i wish you all the best
AA11784984	Not walking will not by itself make your labor harder but if you do walk it does tend to make it easier and faster.|`|ed052b6f800dc43932558f491194a7b8aa	ive had 5 babies and with all off them i was encouraged to walk in early labour to help bring babies head down and stronger contractions <br>  so no its not to late<br>  ignore ppl trying to scare or worry you i never walked so much until labour started x x x|`|YP3rEESUaa	when you get regular exercise during pregnancy it will make labor a whole lot easier and faster!  walking now will actually help you go into labor, and it might make for an easier delivery too.  Congrats!|`|cJRFbZUaaa	If you're comfortable walking, by all means do so.  I'm past 38 weeks and still enjoy going for a few miles every day, just have to make sure I'm near the public toilets now :).  It keeps the mind off the pending labor and delivery and can actually help it along.|`|CpiLHcTlaa	walking can help you go into labor and speed it up a bit. you don't want to have the baby after then get walking go to a mall or something and just walk around in the shops for a while.|`|AA10458750	Yeah you should have been walking before now.....start today!|`|peQGGFPYaa	i would say it isn't true from personal experience. I never walked much with my first two, well in fact i never walked just for the sake of walking because i was pregnant. My labors were not hard at all first one came in 8 hours and the second in 6 hours.and the first was born at 37 weeks and the second at 39 weeks. I think it may be an old wives tale, but everyone always seems so serious about it. I myself have never had a problem.|`|iNbSiIh1aa	As far as what I've been told, walking is a good thing, just don't over do it. Since you are so close to your due date and haven't been walking I would check with your Dr first, you don't want to exert yourself too much and go into labor too soon!|`|17GuqtQ9aa	iam also 38 weeks pregnant, i try to walk 1 hour a day . i hope that   be enough, but everyone say walking is help for labour , so try ur best walk us you can,<br>  <br>  good luck

It is very unique though. <br>  <br>  It is actually better having a name that isn't common, because, for example, if you go to a park and say your name is Tawdry, and then they hear a Tawdry on TV, they'll know it is you since it's an unique name.|`|nDaLHm3Daa	It is great if u give me 10 points...<br>  otherwise...i would give it a second thought
mvKbfkhGaa	In some cases yes they will leave a scar.....and you should keep her from scratching so you are doing the right thing by putting gloves/socks on her....Try giving her oatmeal baths if you can, that's what my mom did with us and all 3 of my daughter's got the chicken pox shot...=]|`|NP3omgubaa	as long as she does not scratch them no she should have no scars<br>  do not know if you can completely stop her from scratching have scar but only one from having chickenpox years age|`|PZYOTy2Haa	If she doesn't scratch them she shouldn't. But does she have easily scarred skin? I had chicken pox at the age of 7 and passed it on to my (then less than a year old) sister. We scratched a bit (obviously she did, she was only a baby) but have no scars at all, I'm now 16 and she's 9. However some people do stay scarred, but minimally. Try encouraging her to moisturise regularly as the spots go down.
F2cVt5jaaa	I love this name! I think it is adorable for a little boy and very sexy for a man. Yes I think this name could be used professionally too :o)|`|Yz1pzloSaa	Noooooo<br>  Sorry I hate it|`|AA11138222	I LOVE IT!!!<br>  <br>  I like Broderick, with the nickname Brody (or Brock). That's what I plan on naming a son if I have one!|`|MSGixNibaa	I've always loved Brody and I'm so glad you're thinking about his future. :]<br>  It is a bit nicknamish, but honestly I really can't find a full name. I think Brody would suit him just fine.|`|XzV4bUeFaa	I like it.  It makes no difference on a young person or older person.  I would go w/Brody Dean.|`|8KZ7HKgvaa	I like Broderick or Brodrick and Brody as a nickname|`|1ZnzjCdlaa	I love then name!!! I would love to name my next baby boy that if I have anymore kids.|`|AA11899988	I love the name Brody it's my all time favorite boy name. It sounds cute for a young boy yet its masculine and sounds great for any age. I love the middle name William to go with it although Brody is a newer name I think Brody William sounds really nice.<br>  <br>  Love the name Best Wishes!|`|4Xpo2eYLaa	I'm sorry, i don't like this name at all. I agree with Kella, it's always made me think of "grody" and that's not good. However, to answer your question, i think it will be just as good as an adult as it is for a child.|`|AXEqOEloaa	It's ok but don't really care for it.|`|7ZNkStqGaa	I think it is as gay as Bruce|`|fapk8NXNaa	it sounds like a name of a dog, and so does morgan-thats the name of my friends dog|`|6nElnyzEaa	I LOVE THAT NAME <3<br>  So cute! It reminds me of Brody Jenner. ahaha which is good!|`|541ni2a9aa	horrible jock name. dont do that. very tacky|`|51d57483d1f6319218c2bc7c948690b7aa	MY sister wanted to name my nephew Brody, then I started chanting <br>  "Grody Brody, Grody Brody, Grody Brody"<br>  Grody is a word we use to describe something really really gross<br>  his name is Caleb now|`|xfxlpT2Waa	its cute for when he's little but it will be weird when he grows up . use it as a nick name|`|F37JustBaa	it's okay, but not the best name|`|b6dnIGoYaa	i dont like it
AiJeS6I1aa	Some babies become really efficient at breastfeeding, and will nurse for only a short time.  There are no hard and fast rules about time.  Some things to look for:<br>  <br>  -If your baby is getting good mouthfuls of milk, don't worry.  You'll know that she's getting a good amount of milk if she opens her mouth in a suck and pauses briefly at the widest open part.  That's when milk is flowing in.<br>  <br>  -Can you hear her swallow after every 1-2 sucks?  That's good.<br>  <br>  -Does she have 6 or more wet diapers in a day and frequent stools (sometimes with every feed)?  Lots of wet diapers = good hydration = adequate milk intake.  Stools can be variable in a breastfed infant, and I have spoken to one mom of a normal, breastfed baby who only pooped about once every 5-6 days (but it was a big one!).<br>  <br>  Check out the following link which is an informative (and not too long) article on how to know if your baby is getting enough milk.  Also check out the rest of the site...  very helpful and straightforward advice on breastfeeding.  Dr. Jack Newman is a Toronto-based Pediatrician who specializes in breastfeeding difficulties:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.drjacknewman.com/help/Is%20My%20Baby%20Getting%20Enough%20Milk.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.drjacknewman.com/help/Is%20My...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  This link is to the article on breast compression, which can help keep your baby interested and drinking by keeping the flow of milk up.  Lots of babies lose interest once the let-down/flow decreases:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.drjacknewman.com/help/Breast-compression.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.drjacknewman.com/help/Breast-...</a>|`|EH6ExoV6aa	After she falls to sleep how long does she stay asleep? 5 minutes is not long enough the least should be 15 to 20. Maybe you should consider giving her a paci since it seems as though she wants to soothe herself to sleep and she will let you know when she really is hungry. Best of luck.|`|AA12373801	I usually wait until my son wakes up if he falls asleep at the breast. He is also 2 months old and usually he just sucks to soothe.|`|leAePwHVaa	let her sleep, she will wake up when she's hungry...|`|t1fx6kXcaa	Follow your baby's lead and forget about the so-called "rules" of  breastfeeding. If your baby falls asleep after 5 minutes then leave her to sleep  and wait until she wakes up for another feed.Whether she sleeps for 10 minutes for two hours, there is no need to wake her.|`|5ujzs0k3aa	try taking some of her slothes off and cooliung her down to keep her awake and eating as long as possible, you can also try tapping of playing with her feet to keep her awake, but once she falls asleep I would leave her be|`|ntyClwciaa	It depends, if you think that she is not drinking enough then maybe you should wake your baby up. Lactation nurse showed me to wake up the baby is to put a cold towel on your baby's cheek. I had the same problem and my baby is so lazy to breastfeed and have to constantly wake her up to breastfeed. It will soon be over coz about 3 or 4 months they'll be more awake alot.|`|Kx9QgyjSaa	Every baby/mom nursing relationship is unique.<br>  <br>  Good support/ideas/education from La Leche League.|`|tQVBDx5Paa	40 minutes?  A baby can finish a breast in 6-12 minutes.|`|Ujh2TE1daa	yes u should wait until she wakes up agaim...
4jbiS9hvaa	Walk away :-)  This is all about him trying to gain some control and test the waters with you.  Argh this is a horrid stage isn't it!  Let him know that when he throws his food, after 2 times, it's over - and mean it, take him down.  We went through this will all 3 of our kids and alas, none of them throws their food anymore!|`|KHbqfLRUaa	I think that what you are doing is the right thing.  If he throws his food, you need to take it from him.  When he gets hungry, he'll eat it.  My two year old did the same thing around his 1st birthday and he never went hungry.  Good luck and don't worry!|`|KNxs4PrZaa	This is very normal.  There are a few things going on, first of all he has learned that this is a fun attention getting game.  Second he is experiementing not only with food but also with what he can get away with, at this age they are learing about cause and affect.  The other thing around that age is that kids will start going though eating phases where they will eat everything in sight ofr awhile and then it seems like you cant get anything in them.  Its almost as if they fill up like a camel and then dont need anything for awhile. :) this is normal they are growing in spurts and changing so fast that is affects their appetite.  especially if he has been sick recently he probably hasnt been feeling well so he doesnt feel like eating and what better use of the food then to throw it and play with it!!!  just keep making it clear that its not ok and be consistant. with it he will eventually get bored.|`|LfDfkbgWaa	he might still not be feeling well but 12 months is about the time kids go through the throwing food stage. good luck
