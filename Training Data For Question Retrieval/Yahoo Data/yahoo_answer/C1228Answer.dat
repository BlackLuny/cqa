For example, if the numbers are 3, 6, 1, 5, 7, 8, and 2, reorder them as 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8. Since there are 7 numbers, the middle number would be the fourth in the list, or '5'.

When your daughter tells you that it says "not to love mommy" that is NOT a good thing either. Your daughter could be talking to a spirit that wants her for itself and doesn't want you in the picture, it could want her for a reason that your daughter may remind them of someone they loved or liked in the lifetime they had before, or a bad reason would be it wants to hurt her, physically or mentally, it depends on the spirit and what it wants. When a spirit appears to a child as another child it's trying to gain their trust, so it continues to talk to the child, make it laugh, and make their presence to the child seem like a good thing. But when it in this case gets bigger from a child to an adult it may now turn on her and no longer make the child happy, but now frighten the child which is in this case is your daughter. So in case this is something that wants to hurt your child [which we think it may if she says it frightens her] I strongly advise you get a blessing as soon as you can.

NwbgvzfXaa	You want to be an engineer and you don't like designing?  The most common duty of any engineer is design work. It is an engineer's job to create the design of a system that can accomplish a task. Math is a good part of design work.<br>  <br>  Maybe what you want is hands-on practical type of work that an engineering technician would perform. It is their duty to apply a design into an actual product by building and testing it, then recommending changes, if necessary. <br>  In this case, you would major in engineering technology. Click on the source link I posted below for one example.<br>  <br>  While it is true that engineers and engineering technicians both learn creating designs and application of designs, engineers concentrate on the former and engineering technicians concentrate on the latter. I'm a university trained engineer who has worked as an engineering technician.|`|zf8BnU6Yaa	Engineers are people who solve problems.  A client comes to the company and has something which needs to be designed or a design which needs to be built or something which doesn't work quite right.  In some cases it is something like a space rocket and in some cases it is something like a hard drive or computer or even smaller.  But it is always about understanding a problem and then solving it in some manner.  I know people who helped design antennas for space systems.  That takes design skills but also understanding how radio waves work and making calculations about antenna designs.  If that doesn't interest you then find something else to do because engineers are people who solve problems and that takes some designing.|`|ifBmd8lYaa	I think you may be confusing “architectural design” with “civil engineering design”.  They are different and one may cross a little bit into the other’s field but the contrast is almost like the former is an “artist” and the latter is a “scientist”.  For example, most architects will not be concerned with ensuring the structure design will hold people and cars on rush hour with 100 mph hurricane winds.  And most civil engineers will not be concerned with the design of a modern looking environment that will convey the ambiance of city’s historical culture and draw in tourists from around the world.<br>  <br>  If that clarifies things, then your skills may lean you toward Electrical Engineering.  This field has a lot of calculus and physics.  At the fundamental of any electronic device is physics.  Semiconductors are a creation of “solid state physics” and radios and fiber optics are a creation of “electromagnetics”…both requiring a lot of calculus to understand.  Computers are a creation of mostly “logic” which is also mathematics based but not as much calculus.  As for the future, if you want to get into more of the physics part of it, new technologies are emerging that are supposed to make exciting changes in computing.  These are in the fields of nanotechnology and quantum mechanics such as carbon nanotubes and quantum storage.  What will come of these, however, is up in the air but they hold promises that will change the way things work as much as the transistor did decades ago.|`|v2dzHs2Maa	Well, the engineering subjects which need lots of math and physics are Electronics/ Electrical Engineering, Materials Science and Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and Aeronautics and Astronautics.

Electrical Physics are a higher level form of physics and the whole electrical engineering profession requires less designing than say, civil or mechanical engineering.<br>  <br>  Computer Engineering is a job that is bound to be in higher demand with the PCs taking over every thing. There also is no need for much design beyond just making it work. <br>  <br>  Mechanical can also be an option to some extent if you have an interest in machines. This type requires some designing...okay a lot so you may not be interested in this kind but it is the most flexible of all the engineering disciplines, because if it moves, a Mechanical Engineer did the job.|`|Mb54SjQLaa	Engineering courses in college are mainly about problem solving, using principles from physics and mathematics, there is very little design, and the design projects are very simple when working in teams.  If you get a degree in electrical engineering, electronics engineering, or electrical and computer engineering, you will be qualified to obtain a job in the field you are talking about, as those degrees are probably what managers in that industry will be looking for when hiring you.  You will probably succeed very much so through the curriculum if you are good at those subjects.  I for one lost interest in engineering and went into patent law after getting my ME degree from the University of Missouri-Columbia, and my law degree from St. Louis University, and after about 3 years am making 160K, and am at the bottom of the firm, with a lot of opportunity to move up.  A lot of the cases we deal with are in electronics.  As far as your career though, getting an electrical engineering degree, at many schools may have a specialization in electronics.  Do not worry as much about the degree, it is what you do with it that counts, as long as it is in one of the fields I have mentioned.  If you want to be a manager eventually, then you will not design, if you go a more technical route, chances are you will be designing the technology that the company is selling, specifically for the client's needs and budget.  There are plenty of management careers needed where someone has technical knowledge but also has people skills.  When I worked for engineering companies for 2 summers, there were engineers doing plenty of design work, and then more technical managerial people that didn't do any design work, and more used experience, judgment, and persuasion when talking to the client.  The bottom line is get an engineering degree if you want to work hard in college, and have a degree that looks good to employers for all types of careers and positions.  You don't have to design man.

NytMSKDkaa	Ok, the I's look a lot like lower case "L"'s, but they're upper case "i's" so be weary of that.  Also, I originally did this on MS word to add a subscript, but that didn't work out very well when I copy and pasted it here.  So if you see a number after these upper case "i's", it's supposed to be a subscript.  I2 looks a lot like 12, but it's not, so be weary of that when reading this.  Hope this helps by the way.<br>  <br>  Kirkoff's junction rule:<br>  I1 = I2 + I3<br>  <br>  Let's call the current coming out of the 12V battery I1.  Let's call the current going across the 1.2 Ohm Resistor I2 and finally, let's name the current coming from the 8.6V battery I3.<br>  <br>  And yes it is possible to have two batteries, and a positive flow of current going into the positive end of the weaker battery (the 8.6V one in this case).  This is how rechargeable  batteries work.<br>  <br>  Next, you have to recognize that there are two loops, set up in parallel.  And apply Kirkoff's loop rule.  ΣV=0   (So pretty much, Battery Voltage = sum of the voltage drops in each loop of current)<br>  <br>  And V = IR, right?<br>  <br>  SO:<br>  <br>  Let's call the loop with R1 and the 9.8Ω and the 1.2Ω resistors Loop 1.  Let's call the other one, loop 2.  Applying Kirkoff's loop rule, we can see that for,<br>  Loop 1:   12V - I1(2.3Ω) - I2(1.2V) - I1(9.8Ω) = 0<br>  The current travelling through the 2.3Ω resistor and the 9.8Ω resistor is exactly the same because the current going through the 9.8Ω resistor is the same current returning to the power source.  So we can assume that the current going through the 9.8Ω and the 2.3Ω resistors are the same.<br>  <br>  Loop2:   +I3(6.7Ω) + 8.6V - I2(1.2Ω) = 0<br>  Notice how the sign for current 3 is inverted to positive.    That is because we have charge flowing against the charge of the 12V battery, and that means we have positive current flowing against positive current, so we notate that with a sign change.  That's all the sign change means in this case, that positive current is flowing against another positive current that happens to be stronger (so we notate the larger current with the sign you'd expect it to have)<br>  <br>  We can substitute I3 as (I1-I2), so plug that into the loop 2 equation, and we finally have two equations, with two unknowns.<br>  <br>  12V = I1(2.3Ω) + I2(1.2Ω) + I1(9.8Ω)<br>  9.0V = -I1(6.7Ω) + I2(6.7Ω) + I2(1.2Ω)<br>  <br>  Combine your like terms, and then it's just simple algebra from there.

Heterochromia is a result of the relative excess or lack of melanin (a pigment). It may be inherited, due to genetic mosaicism, or due to disease or injury.[1]<br>  <br>  Eye color, specifically the color of the irises, is determined primarily by the concentration and distribution of melanin.[2][3][4] The affected eye may be hyperpigmented (hyperchromic) or hypopigmented (hypochromic).[5] In humans, usually, an excess of melanin indicates hyperplasia of the iris tissues, whereas a lack of melanin indicates hypoplasia.<br>  <br>  Heterochromia of the eye (heterochromia iridis or heterochromia iridum) is of two kinds. In complete heterochromia, one iris is a different color from the other. In partial heterochromia or sectoral heterochromia, part of one iris is a different color from its remainder.<br>  <br>  <br>  Partial or sectoral heterochromia is much less common than complete heterochromia and is typically found in autosomally inherited disorders such as Hirschsprung's disease and Waardenburg syndrome.

The Big Dipper is a perfect starting place. The two stars on the side of the bowl away from the handle, if projected five times the distance between them in the direction the bowl opens, will take you to the north star, Polaris, which is at the end of the handle of the Little Dipper, Ursa Minor. You've found your first constellation!<br>  <br>  The handle of the Big Dipper is a gentle arc. If you follow that arc away from the bowl you come to a bright star, Arcturus, which marks the constellation Bootes, shaped like a narrow kite. Follow that arc farther and you come to a second bright star, Spica in Virgo, one of the ones you need to find Comet Lulin (not Lunis!) To remember this we say "Arc to Arcturus then speed on to Spica." You've just found two more constellations! Knowing the Big Dipper, Arcturus, and Spica, you should be able to find Regulus in Leo using any star chart. Remember that the distances between stars in the sky are much larger than they look on your little map. Leo is a striking group of stars: on the right is a sickle or reversed question mark, with Regulus as the dot under the question mark; on the left is a right angled triangle. Saturn is right under the triangle at present, and Comet Lulin will join it on Monday night.

NwbgvzfXaa	In a resistor, there is real power because a resistor dissipates (wastes) power in the form of heat. In a capacitor, the power is transferred from the circuit to the electrostatic field, then returned to the circuit each time that field collapses. In an inductor, the power is transferred from the cicruit to the electromagnetic field, then returned to the circuit every time that field collapses. Since the power is recovered every cycle, there is no power dissipated (wasted) in capacitors and inductors.
HvnxG0V8aa	1) Kp = the partial pressures of the products divided by the partial pressures of the reactants. So in this equation Kp = (partial pressure of S2)^4 divided by partial pressure of S8.

C2/V2 are what you want.<br>  <br>  Normally, one of the volumes should be X.  You should know the concentration of you're diluting (C1) and what concentration you want to dilute it to (C2), and the final volume you want of your final solution (V2) but you need to figure out how much you need to dilute it (V1)<br>  <br>  In your case, this fits.  Following the equation, you have 0.1M x (X) = 0.003 x (100).<br>  <br>  Solve for X.  This is how much of your stock solution you will need to dilute.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind that you want the *final* volume to be 100 mL, so what you dilute it into will be 100 (final volume) - calculated stock solution volume being added.  If you don't factor that in, you may end up severely altering the volume and therefore, the concentration.<br>  <br>  For example, if you would calculate that you need 10 mLs of your EDTA stock solution, then you would dilute it into 90 mLs, for a total of 100 mLs.

The 5300kV is a line-to-line voltage (Vll), but the voltage that appears across the line-to-neutral resistance and load is the line-to-neutral voltage (Vln), where Vln = Vll / (3)^(1/2).  The power is calculated via P = I x Vln x 3, where the factor of 3 is there because there are three lines, not just one, that are dissipating power.  And this assumes that the impedance of the transmission line is entirely resistive (or that the reactance is negligible), otherwise, one pretty much needs to resort to two-dimensional vector calculations to derive accurate answers.  I'm glad we didn't go there.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

SYZwJAjOaa	Seven books can be placed on a shelf 7! ways, 7*6*5*4*3*2*!= 5040 ways.  <br>  <br>  If two books must always be together, then they can be considered one book, so 6! = 6*5*4*3*2*1= 720.

If you have 7 sciences books, there are 5040 different ways to arrange them.  If you consider the two chemistry books one book, there are 1440 different ways to arrange them next to each other.

vSkqJ813aa	Wikipedia comments that '... In mathematics, in the field of differential equations, a boundary value problem is a differential equation together with a set of additional restraints, called the boundary conditions. A solution to a boundary value problem is a solution to the differential equation which also satisfies the boundary conditions.<br>  <br>  Boundary value problems arise in several branches of physics as any physical differential equation will have them. Problems involving the wave equation, such as the determination of normal modes, are often stated as boundary value problems. A large class of important boundary value problems are the Sturm-Liouville problems. The analysis of these problems involves the eigenfunctions of a differential operator.<br>  <br>  To be useful in applications, a boundary value problem should be well posed. This means that given the input to the problem there exists a unique solution, which depends continuously on the input. Much theoretical work in the field of partial differential equations is devoted to proving that boundary value problems arising from scientific and engineering applications are in fact well-posed.<br>  <br>  Among the earliest boundary value problems to be studied is the Dirichlet problem, of finding the harmonic functions (solutions to Laplace's equation); the solution was given by the Dirichlet's principle.<br>  <br>  ...'<br>  <br>  Thus, finding a boundary condition depends upon stability and solubility!<br>  <br>  As an example, consider Ω to denote a bounded region in R2 with a smooth boundary S. let f, g, and p be functions in C(Ω'). Now, consider Poisson's equation (here I have been forced to use ? for 'grad'): -<br>  <br>  -?2u(x, y) = f(x, y)<br>  <br>  Dirichlet's boundary condition is<br>  <br>  u = g on S<br>  <br>  Neumann's boundary condition is<br>  <br>  ?u = g on S<br>  __<br>  ?n<br>  <br>  And, the mixed boundary condition is<br>  <br>  ?u  + pu= g on S<br>  __<br>  ?n<br>  <br>  <br>  Using variational formulations of the problems (using each boundary condition in turn). We have for Dirichlet’s with s1 = s and g1 = g: -<br>  <br>  ∫(ux2 + uy2 - 2fu).dx.dy<br>  n<br>  <br>  For Neumann's boundary condition with S2 = S, p = 0, g2 = g, we have: -<br>  <br>  ∫(ux2 + uy2 - 2fu).dx.dy -2.∫g.u.dS<br>  n ................................. S<br>  <br>  And, finally, for the mixed boundary condition, with S2 = S, g2= g, we have: -<br>  <br>  ∫(ux2 + uy2 - 2fu).dx.dy -2.∫(pu2 - 2.g.u).dS<br>  n ................................. S<br>  <br>  Thus, Dirichlet condition is stable for the corresponding variational problem, whereas Neumann's and the mixed boundary conditions are natural boundary conditions. This definition comes from H1(Ω) so that for Dirichlet u is in H1(Ω): u = g on S (a subset) but for the other two conditions They are the whole of or over H1(V). With H1 as the first derivative of the subspace spanned by ui!<br>  <br>  [Edit]<br>  <br>  The subspace H1(Ω) is the space of all u in the functional space L2(Ω) whose derivatives are of the order '1' and are also in L2(Ω). <br>  I am sorry - about selecting the calculus of variations as an example of boundary conditions! To say the least, it is a rather complex example and, hence, not well thought out! Thus, I felt that this initial answer was somewhat grabbled. Thus, I will add these further comments and simpler example: -<br>  <br>  If a PDE is to be used to model a physical system then the initial conditions must be satisfied throughout the region Ω at the instant when consideration of the physical system begins. A typical initial condition prescribes some combination of u and its times derivatives.<br>  <br>  The prescribed initial and boundary conditions, of a PDE, are referred to as the 'data'. Hence, the solution is said 'to depend continuously upon' the data if small changes in the data produce small changes in the solution. A 'well-posed' solution is: a solution to the problem, a unique solution, or the solution continuously depends upon the data. However, if none of these conditions are met then the problem is referred to as 'ill-posed'.<br>  <br>  Elliptic equations often offer well-posed solutions.<br>  <br>  For example (taken from source i): -<br>  <br>  if Ω is the region 0<x<1, 0<y<1, then the boundary value problem <br>  <br>  uxx + uyy = f(x, y) in Ω<br>  u(x, 0) = u(x, 1) = 0 on 0<x<1<br>  ux(0, y) = 1 on 0<y<1<br>  2yu(1, y) - 5ux(1, y) = y2<br>  <br>  has a homogeneous Dirichlet condition on the portion of the boundary where y=0 or y=1. A Neumann condition holds on the part of the boundary where x=0. On the edge x=1, u satisfies a mixed boundary condition.<br>  <br>  Hence, too finally answer your question - the boundary condition (Dirichlet, Neumann, mixed (Robin or radiation)) selected depends upon the boundary of the region being studied!

The best thing you could do is to leave all this alone for a time; try and forget about the paranormal and concentrate on the path of hearth fire, that is sorting out your personal, and work life plus relationships and other aspects of your  life.  <br>  If you come out of meditation confused then the watcher is not doing the job properly or you would be noticed and get help.  Do not worry about premonitions; many people have these dreams.  But try not to take notice of them unless you have any unusually strong feeling, not a dream, or think it may involve you.  Otherwise you will become as stuck as someone I knew who had to ask a crystal before she did anything and ended up getting stuck for months and months.

That means we write 4.5<br>  Now, to get from 4.5 to 450000, how many spaces must the decimal point be moved?  It has to go past the 5 and then the four zeros, that makes 5 spaces to the right, so the exponent is 5.  So we write<br>   4.5 * 10^5<br>  <br>  b. For 0.000067, the first nonzero digit is 6, so write 6.7<br>  Now, to get from 6.7 to 0.000067, we have to move the point past the 6 and past the four zeros, that makes 5 spaces to the left.

qENGaDWdaa	speciation, or the divergence of a population into separate species, can take two forms: allopatric, where a physical barrier seperates populations (darwin's finches), and sympatric, where a population sharing a geographic location is forced by environmental factors to diverge. once they have diverged, either prezygotic or postzygotic barriers can prevent interbreeding between the two species. prezygotic barriers. are those that present the forming of a fertilized egg, or hybrid zygote. postzygotic barriers prevent the continued reproduction of a successful hybrid (for example, a horse and donkey may mate to creat a mule, but the mule itself is fertile-poszygotic. and a prezygotic example would be that, nomatter how hard they try, an elephant and a mole simply could not mate. you figure that one out. :-)  )<br>  hope it helps!

0179823161e4d7cda6f1ffeff1fbaf70aa	The answer to this question depends on a few unknowns which is why the problem asks you to provide an order of magnitude (i.e. rough estimate).  Typically, orders of magnitude are quoted in powers of ten.  So numbers between 100 and 1000 are on an order of magnitude between 10 to the second and third power.<br>  <br>  In this particular case, the problem involves equating a linear distance (60,000 miles) with a multiple of a given circumference.<br>  <br>  Recall that the formula for the circumference of a circle is pi times the diameter of the circle.  If you have an estimate for the diameter of the tire, you can figure out its circumference.  The circumference is equal to the linear distance that the tire would travel over a surface if it rotated 360 degrees one time.<br>  <br>  So let's say that we had a tire than was 1 foot in diameter.<br>  <br>  It's circumference would be pi x 1ft. = pi feet.<br>  <br>  There are 5280 feet in one mile.  Therefore, the rough number of rotations of the tire required to travel 1 mile is:<br>  <br>  5280ft / pi feet per rotation which is roughly equal to 1680 rotations.  This should help you solve the specifics of your math question.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|r2gybx5haa	average diameter of a tire =0.6meter.<br>  1 revolution= pi*d =3.14159* 0.6 m<br>  60000miles= 60000* 1.609344*1000 *m ;<br>  <br>  answer =  ( 60000* 1.609344*1000 *m ) /(3.14159* 0.6 m)<br>  <br>  about 51.2 million revolutions, Whoa!|`|SYZwJAjOaa	It would help to know the tire size.  Since we don't have it lets use variables.  Call C the circumference and assume it is in inches.  60,000 miles/ C inches.  60,000 miles = 316800000 feet = 3801600000 inches traveled.  Now take 3801600000/ C inches and you should know how many revolutions the tire made.<br>  <br>  For example lets just say a tire is 80 inches in circumference, 3801600000/ 80 = 47520000.  or 4.752x10^7 revolutions

But humans have not correctly applied the terrestrial store of energy and material resources, and we are now past the halfway point to being depleted.<br>  <br>  Think of fossil fuels as the key that unlocks the sky. If we apply them soon enough, we can unlock the door and send our seed to establish itself elsewhere in this solar system - say in orbit around Titan, for example - and this seed could develop and send out more colonies wherever advantage was found in doing so.<br>  <br>  But it hasn't been done. And, in my opinion it won't be done. Capitalists simply don't like to invest in projects that won't pay off during their lifetimes, and governments won't stay focused on the task for the necessary time. The kind of leadership that might have carried space colonization through to self-sufficiency was destroyed in 1945, and the likes of it has never been seen again.<br>  <br>  Really, space colonization is something that ought to be done as if it were a war objective: done immediately and on an emergency basis, done right, done regardless of how many setbacks or casualties occur. But, instead of that, you see a lot of posturing and politicking and profit-mongering. People in general don't understand that what is at stake is the survival of Earth's life, the only life that we know the universe has. Worse, if they did know, most of them wouldn't care.<br>  <br>  Once fossil fuels are gone, the door to the heavens will be permanently closed.

After reading many science fiction books I conclude that there are basically two usages for time travel: 1) Someone returns to the past and does something that changes his reality. 2) Someone travels back in history and uses his superior knowledge to gain advantage over people there. Both these aims can be achieved to a certain degree. 1) You can not undone what has been done but you can act differently next time. There is even a procedure to ensure that your decisions are optimal. It is called critical thinking or rationality. 2) If you study hard you can acquire knowledge that is superior to that of your contemporaries.|`|AA11816805	Easy!! I am a time traveller.

There really is no middle ground here.|`|WPPIaLORaa	That theory is internally self-contradictory.  For the earth to be 4.5 billion years old, there must have been a clock of some type running so that the estimate of the age could be made.  For the age of the earth, the clock is the decay of radioactive elements such as uranium.  If there were no time, there would be no decay rate which implicitly needs time.  <br>  <br>  Keep in mind that the astronomers have estimated the age of the universe at approximately 13 billion years based on the current expansion rate.  For the universe to expand, it changes with time.  Therefore, there has been time for at least as long as the age of the universe.<br>  <br>  Your teacher is trying too hard to fit his faith based on 3000 year old stories into a knowledge system based on 500 years of science ( and mostly scientific information that was gathered in the last hundred years).|`|0C7xeiN3aa	I think religion and science, while they can of course be complimentary to each other (think "fides et ratio"), religious extremism (i.e. "fundamentalism" and "biblical inerrancy") is incompatible with scientific advancement and should be stamped out for the collective benefit of humanity as a species. <br>  <br>  I laugh when these people (fundamentalists) think that the Earth was formed 6 000 years ago - I think they're confusing the first known recording of history (what we now think of as the "dawn of civilization") with the conception of time. "Time" has been in existence and "ticking" since the Universe began - some 14.7 billion years ago.<br>  <br>  In short, your teacher, while his motives are applaudable (i.e. not blindly accepting religion over evidence and factual knowledge), is misguided in his attempt to marry them. Please tell him this for the sake of all humanity - and all fundamentalists too, for that matter.<br>  <br>  Oh wait, who am I kidding, rational arguments don't work on religious people: otherwise there would be no religious people...<br>  <br>  EDIT: He's a geologist? That means he has to have seen rocks well over 6 000 years old with his own eyes! Truly, the way some people try to marry scientific advancement with an old book is astounding...
eEwG0EeJaa	Their habitat is shrinking, due to global warming. The ice flows in which they hunt on are vanishing, this makes it harder for them to hunt their natural prey ( seals), so they wonder into towns looking for food. This puts them in contact with humans, who see them as a threat (no one wants to be walking to school, and come across a Polar Bear), so the animal is either driven away (if it leaves, fine) if it wont leave, or keeps coming back, it's shot.

AA10655250	Generally, rainfall increases further out from the center of the country which is a desert.<br>  <br>  Rainfall in Australia is highly variable, across short and long time-scales, and across the country. Some of the year-to-year variability is due to the El Nino-Southern Oscillation.<br>  <br>  The rainfall pattern is strongly seasonal in character with a winter rainfall regime in the south and a summer regime in the north. Uniform rainfall occurs in much of New South Wales, parts of eastern Victoria and southern Tasmania. The monsoonal rains or the extreme north fall between November and March and are often unreliable. More than 80% of the continent has at least three months each year that are without effective precipitation.<br>  <br>  Australia's relatively short instrumental rainfall record shows large year-to-year and decade-to-decade fluctuations. The palaeo-climatic record, and the fact that many native plants and animals have evolved to cope with extended drought periods, indicate that this variability has existed for many thousands of years.<br>  <br>  <br>  See the links below for additional information.

ifBmd8lYaa	Yes, I would love a robot assistant and would want others to have one too.  It can make your life better since you don’t have to do routine mundane tasks.  Sort of like having a maid that just runs on electricity and will not be lazy.  With my mind away from “menial things” I can focus more on things I like to do and mean something to me and concentrate on more “important” things in life rather than the daily struggle.  And with everyone having these robots, they can use more time for creativity and ultimately that will better the world.  Also, I personally feel that a big part of some people’s lives are “wasted” taking care of aging parents and other loved ones.  If a robot can do this (it’s in the works) this will give people less of a burden and the elder will feel like less of a burden on society as well.  This way you’re not wasting a “young life”.|`|ThE5yYqaaa	hmmmmmmmmm that's a difficult one... i think it would be cool to have a robot assistant as long as there was a guarantee that nothing could go wrong (like the change! lol) so yah i think i would say sure :) lol

PblD7JR5aa	Mastery of astronomy is a life long quest. There is always something new to figure out, old objects to look at again and projects to work on.<br>  <br>  One thing to keep in mind, is that the first scope that you buy is usually a mistake. Just about all of us in the hobby has done that, when we were starting out, so don't feel too bad. I'm on my third telescope now (over a space of about 10 years). Starting from a 5" SCT, to an 8" SCT and to my current scope, an 11" SCT. <br>  <br>  Do find and join a club in your local area, see what other folks use and then make a better choice. The hobby can be expensive and frustrating when you don't know (at first) what to do. That's where a decent club helps - learn from the more experienced observers.<br>  <br>  There are tons of online resources as well, if there isn't a club in your local area. I'll list a few, but you do need to find what works best for you.<br>  <br>  One book that I always recommend to anyone is "Nightwatch" by Terence Dickinson. It's about the best introductory observing book and astronomy guide out there. Great pictures, easy to read and made to be used outside.<br>  <br>  From there, keep plugging away at it. I can't help you much with polar alignment, since my scope doesn't need it. But you very basically find your latitude, find true north and point your scope's declination axis in that direction.|`|f1beDbKIaa	Yes, and to make it easier to find a local astronomy club, check here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.skyandtelescope.com/community/organizations" rel="nofollow">http://www.skyandtelescope.com/community...</a><br>  <br>  Stars are specks in multimillion dollar telescopes too.<br>  <br>  Check out the Pleiades to the upper right of Orion.  And on your way there, check out the Hyades.   These are bright, easy to find clusters.  Then check out m44 off to the left in Cancer.  Keep going to Leo, and look for Saturn and the comet.  You've downloaded this month's skymap, right?  Study it a bit to see where these things are before going out into the cold.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://skymaps.com/downloads.html" rel="nofollow">http://skymaps.com/downloads.html</a><br>  <br>  Expect to spend 5 to 10 minutes for each object.  So this is half an hour to a full hour.<br>  <br>  Andromeda (m31) is easiest to find by starting with the great square in Pegasus in the west (if it hasn't set).  Go to the 2nd pair of stars in Andromeda, then go towards Cassiopeia about the distance between these two stars.  It's not quite dead on, but close.  You're looking for a fuzz ball, which is the galaxy core.  If you have really dark skies, you may see the arms.<br>  <br>  First you level the scope. You need to point the lower axis of rotation north, and to the correct altitude for your latitude.  Typically you try to aim it at the North Star - though that's not exactly at the pole.  It should then track for you.|`|cKzfxE0Zaa	Learn about orbital elements and how they tell where a planet is in relation to the sun and the stars. Once you think you know what all six of the numbers mean, start practicing your visualization by pretending that you're the sun and you're going to locate all the planets, one by one, and point toward them. Choose a spot on a wall to be the vernal equinox, and take the horizontal plane level with your eyes as the ecliptic. Start figuring out which way Mercury is. Point in that direction and say how far it is. Do the same for Venus, Earth, Mars, etc. Then look up the planets positions in an ephemeris and see how close you were. You can do this for asteroids and comets, too. Eventually, you'll be able to add in coordinate transformations mentally, translating yourself over to Earth and rotating the scene from ecliptic to celestial coordinates. There is just no excuse for ever being Lost In Space.|`|1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	Get yourself a planisphere <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planisphere" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planisphere</a> to help locate fixed objects like Andromeda, globular clusters, nebulae, and other galaxies (although those might be too dim for that scope).  Sky and Telescope <a href="http://www.skyandtel.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.skyandtel.com</a> has monthly star charts up for finding planets and comets. It should have come with instructions for how to align it - try joining a local astronomy club.  Those guys have tons of experience with telescopes and would be more than happy to help you align it and start finding cool stuff to look at.
17d2136cb28b3dcd96bfa98507022f5eaa	Saturn will be in opposition on March 8, which means that it is currently visible all night. It is quite easy to find as a bright object just south of the right angle triangle that makes up the eastern part of the constellation Leo. If you don't know how to recognize Leo, you'd better learn fast if you want to be an astronomer. Unless you learn the major constellations, you won't ever be able to find anything interesting with your telescope. I found Leo on my first night out as an amateur astronomer, so it's not terribly hard. Get yourself a good current star map, such as you'll find in the major astronomy magazines or online here:<br>  <a href="http://www.skymaps.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.skymaps.com/</a><br>  <br>  In your 90mm refractor at 100x, it should look like a tiny disk with a skewer through it. The rings are currently close to edge on, so appear more as a line than an oval. Look for Saturn's biggest moon Titan, in line with the rings. With a little luck you should see one or two more moons...I've seen them with a 90mm scope.<br>  <br>  While you're in the area of Saturn, be sure to sweep to its south with your 50x eyepiece to try to see Comet Lulin, which is only a few degrees away over the next few nights.

OgQ8opeAaa	This is actually a very complicated question, and I doubt that you can find the answer that you need on here.  That being said, I will still give it a shot.<br>  <br>  To preface this answer, I am not a psychiatrist.  I minored in psych in undergrad, but have had very little run in with psych issues since my fourth year med school clinical inpatient rotation.<br>  <br>  The stabbing head pains could be a variety of issues.  Most likely, they are a reaction to stress.  Certain headaches (tension headaches) may produce some of the same symptoms as you describe.  Though it is very, very, very, very low on the list, a tumor of sorts could also be causing this.<br>  <br>  Your personality changes and frequent crying sound as though you are having some type of reaction, again, to stress.  I would be willing to bet that a very big change in your life has occurred in the last 6-12 months.  A change that has altered your life as you knew it and has left you quite unhappy.  My semi-educated opinion on this is that you are having some type of adjustment disorder.<br>  <br>  Lastly, the two lumps behind your ear are likely lymph nodes.  We have tons of them in our body.  Their increase in size is most likely from a recent illness, such as a cold, flu, sore throat, etc.  They should get smaller in time.  Stop feeling them everyday, because then you won't be able to tell if they are getting smaller.  Examine them once a week.  If they are rock-hard, go see a doctor soon, because rock-hard lymph nodes are often a sign of bad stuff (i.e., cancer).<br>  <br>  Honestly, you should go see your regular family doctor or internist.  I think he/she may be able to help you with your frequent personality changes and tearfulness.  Also, they should take a look at those nodes.  <br>  <br>  Hope that helps.

I also recommend making a list of notecards for when you present.<br>  <br>  Here is what he did-<br>  <br>  Cave Stalactites and Stalagmites <br>  by Jeanette Cain<br>  <br>  <br>  This project will require at least two weeks advance preparation to prepare a cave with stalactites and stalagmites. If you live in a damp or humid climate, your results will not be dramatic. In a real cave stalactites and stalagmites form when mineral rich water flows through porous rock. Through capillary action, which is the force of attraction between a solid and a liquid, mineral rich water flows through porous rock and begins to accumulate. Gravity will eventually force the water to drip out of the the rock. During the time the droplets hang, air will evaporate some of the water causing a mineral nucleus formation on which more droplets will hang. <br>   <br>  <br>  For the formation of icicles, which resemble stalactites and stalagmites, super cooled water drips through the icicle and freezes around a nucleus of ice at the tip. Each droplet accumulates on another droplet until a stalactite is formed. As the stalactite grows and becomes large enough for water to flow through it again, the capillary action begins once more. <br>  <br>  Stalactites hang from the top of a cave and stalacmites grow from the floor. They may also be found on bridges and buildings. <br>  <br>  YOU WILL NEED: <br>  <br>  1. Sheet of black poster board <br>  2. Epsom salt <br>  3. Water <br>  4. Tape <br>  5. Scissors <br>  6. 4 same size drinking glasses <br>  7. Black yarn <br>  8. Cellophane tape <br>  9. 4 washers <br>  10. Ruler <br>  11. Small saucepan <br>  12. Pot holder <br>  13. Tablespoon <br>  <br>  FIRST, cut a piece from the black poster board: 4 1/2 by 9 inches, or 11.25 x 22.5 centimeters. Bend this piece of board into a semicircle. <br>  <br>  NEXT, put the 4 drinking glasses around the outside of the semicircle. Tape the ends of your semicircle to the outside of the glasses, checking to make certain the glass tops are at least 1 inch, or 2.5 cm, above the top edge of the poster board. If this isn't so, you will need taller glasses or you will need to trim your poster board. <br>    <br>  <br>    <br>  THEN cut the black yarn into two 16-inch, or 40 cm, pieces, and tie the washers to the ends of each piece of yarn. You will need to stretch the yarn pieces ACROSS the glasses so that the pieces crisscross and lightly sag. <br>  <br>  MIXING THE MINERAL SOLUTION <br>  <br>  FIRST, take the saucepan and fill with water, add Epsom salt, and stir with the tablespoon until all the salt disolves. You will need to heat the water, without boiling, and continue to stir. You can now add more Epsom salt. AN ADULT will need to help you fill each glass with the warm Epsom salt solution. This is where the potholder is needed! <br>  <br>  Be careful not to break the glasses. This is accomplished by SLOWLY pouring the solution into each glass. <br>  <br>  You will now watch and observe your cave for about a week to see the changes taking place. <br>  <br>  I guarantee 1st-3rd place with this project, as long as you present it well.

It was formed the same as any other volcano - molten magma breaking the Earth's surface, cooling, and forming a volcano.

With an atwood system you treat the entire system with one positive direction (I hope that makes sense).<br>  <br>  for instance If I was to create my two equations F = ma equations I would make sure that I keep the same coordinate system for both masses.<br>  <br>  BTW I chose the direction the heavier object will drop as positive.<br>  <br>  Mass 2 equation: m2*g - T = m2 *a.<br>  The only forces on the mass are tension and gravity. So I just summed up the forces set it equal to m*a.<br>  <br>  Mass 1 equation: (remember keep the coordinate system the same) So now Tension is in the positive direction<br>  <br>  Mass 1 equation: T - m1*g = m1*a. Both objects will accelerate at the same rate since they are both attached by a string or wire.<br>  <br>  Now I can cancel the tension by adding the two equations.<br>  <br>  If I add the two equations I get<br>  <br>  m2*g - m1*g = m2* a + m1*a<br>  <br>  I will now factor a and g from each side<br>  <br>  g (m2-m1) = a (m2 + m1)<br>  <br>  a = (m2-m1)/(m2+m1) * g<br>  <br>  I got an aceleration of 5.18 m/s^2<br>  <br>  Okay so now it becomes a kinematics problem<br>  <br>  Hopefully you realize that the heavier object will win the battle so that's why the lighter object won't go downward until it hits the ground<br>  <br>  But it was given an initial velocity of 2.60 m/s<br>  <br>  v (final) = v (initial) + at; this is a kinematics equation. The lighter object will keep going downward until the velocity of the lighter object = ZERO<br>  <br>  v (final) = 0<br>  <br>  t = -v (initial)/a<br>  <br>  Remember the velocity is negative since we defined our coordinate system so that the lighter object is heading in the negative direction.<br>  <br>  Okay so then the question is find the velocity after 1.80 seconds<br>  <br>  Just plug 1.80 seconds into v (final) = v (initial) + a*t (t = time)<br>  <br>  And remember v (initial) is NEGATIVE.<br>  <br>  I think this is how you solve it.

KKev7q04aa	Don't panic, here's how you do it.<br>  <br>  First you look at how the rates change with change in concentration of the various species.<br>  <br>  Notice the first 2 entries; the only difference was the [ClO2] was doubled and the rate went up by a factor of 4 so the reaction is second order in [ClO2]<br>  <br>  Now look at the the bottom 2 entries; the only difference is that the [OH-] was doubled and the rate also doubled, so the reaction is first order in [OH-]<br>  <br>  To determine the rate constant, just plug in the numbers into the rate equation we just found:<br>  <br>  5.75 x 10^-2 = k[0.050 x 0.050 x 0.100] =<br>  5.75 x 10^-2 = k [0.00025]<br>  5.57 x 10^-2/0.00025 = k <br>  230 = k<br>  <br>  Best to try this with one other set to be sure<br>  <br>  2.30 x 10^-1 = k[0.100 x 0.100 x 0.100] <br>  2.30 x 10^-1 = k[0.001]<br>  2.30 x 10^-1/0.001 = k<br>  230 = k<br>  <br>  To get units for k: compare rate units with those you would get from multiplying the concentrations, and then determine what units would be needed for k to have to make it come out right.<br>  <br>  rate: mol/Ls = "k units" x mol^3/L^3<br>  mol/Ls = L^2/mol^2s x mol^3/L^3<br>  <br>  So k = 230 L^2/mol^2s<br>  <br>  So, your rate law is: 230 L^2/mol^2s [ClO2-]^2[OH-]<br>  <br>  For part b just plug the given numbers into the rate law:<br>  <br>  230 x 0.175 x 0.175 x 0.0844 = 0.594mol/Ls

nTKuRFlKaa	*Terminology is differentiated on the basis of their application.<br>  <br>  *Isolation Valves:<br>  <br>  In some plants with fluid systems, some 2-way valves can be designated as normally shut or normally open during regular operation. Examples of normally shut valves are sampling valves, which are only opened while a sample is taken. Examples of normally open valves are isolation valves, which are usually only shut when there is a problem with a unit or a section of a fluid system such as a leak. Then, isolation valve(s) are shut in order to isolate the problem from the rest of the system.<br>  <br>  *Block valve:<br>  <br>  A valve that can block the flow of oil in a pipeline in both directions. Block valves include manual gate valves and remote gate valves.<br>  <br>  Generally it is differing in the sense that block valve used in emergency but it is same as the isolation valve.<br>  <br>  There are some line block valve and some combine systems like "Block and Bleed valve".<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_and_bleed_manifold" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_and_b...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.eng-tips.com/viewthread.cfm?qid=94849" rel="nofollow">http://www.eng-tips.com/viewthread.cfm?q...</a>|`|eEwG0EeJaa	An isolation valve allows you to open one end of it, to allow material to flow, without coming in contact with another material, that is using the same plumbing.<br>  <a href="http://search.globalspec.com/ProductFinder/FindProducts?query=isolation%20valve&se=ggka&setag=FLOW" rel="nofollow">http://search.globalspec.com/ProductFind...</a><br>  A Block valve simply shuts off the supply.<br>  <a href="http://www.plasticvalves.com/safety_block_ball.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.plasticvalves.com/safety_bloc...</a><br>  There's numerous systems that use isolation valves. Let's say you want to make some ice cream, you open the isolation valve to let the milk flow into the mixer, then open the valve to let in the cream. Depending on the valve type, you could then open it to allow in the vanilla, sugar, egg, etc. All with the same valve. It just keeps the ingredients from coming in contact . A block valve is used to shut off a supply, so you can perform maintenance, or just stop the flow.|`|AA10332086	The two terms are used interchangeably.

(Finding all values of t that make the first derivative equal zero, since these are the parts of the curve that are "flat", like peaks and valleys). Once you find these t's, you plug each of them into x(t) and calculate the result. (You may also need to calculate x(t) for the endpoints of the curve). Then, you simply compare the results and see which is the smallest. (Of course, looking at the graph would be helpful).<br>  <br>  Eg.<br>  x(t) = t^3 - t<br>  1. x'(t) = 3t^2 - 1 = 0 (First derivative, set to zero)<br>  2. 3t^2 - 1 = 0  (Let's solve for t)<br>           3t^2 = 1<br>             t^2 = (1/3)<br>               t  = +/- sqrt(1/3)<br>  Two values of t that make x'(t) = 0 => t = sqrt(1/3) and t = -sqrt(1/3).<br>  3. Plug into x(t) to find the values.<br>  => x(sqrt(1/3)) = (sqrt(1/3))^3 - sqrt(1/3)) = -0.384900179<br>  => x(-sqrt(1/3)) = (-sqrt(1/3))^3 + sqrt(1/3) = 0.384900179<br>  4. Which is the smallest result? It's when t = sqrt(1/3) and the value of x(t) = -0.384900179. So that would your minimum. Then you should check values to the left and right of x(sqrt(1/3)) to make sure that they are both greater than -0.384900179, so you know it's a minimum. (I think there's some theorem about that, maybe 2nd derivative =) Can't remember too much.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps a bit, though. Good luck!|`|TqiMnCv6aa	First, you need to understand what is happening here.  This is what is called damped oscillation.   Without the e^(-t) term or the [0,2pi] boundary the particle would start by moving right, then back to the left towards -1 then back to the right towards 1 and so on forever.  <br>  <br>  With the e^(-t) term, the oscillation starts by moving right, left right, but each time it doesn't go as far as it did the previous time.   Asymptotically the motion will tend towards the center x=0.<br>  <br>  So, with that in mind, <br>  <br>  a).  It's finding all solutions to x'(t)=0.  Farthest to the left means you are looking for a global minimum.   Thus must mean you want a point where x'(t)=0 and x''(t)>0.<br>  <br>  x'(t) = -e^(-t)*sin(t) + e^(-t)*cos(t)<br>  <br>  Thus x'(t) = e^(-t) (cos(t) - sin(t))<br>  <br>  This equals 0 when t is pi/4 or 5pi/4.<br>  <br>  x''(t)=-e^(-t)*(cos(t)-sin(t)) +e^(-t)*(-sin(t)-cos(t))<br>        =e^(-t)*(-2*cos(t))<br>  <br>  When t is pi/4, we see that x''(t)<0.  This is a local maximum.  We want the local minimum, that is when t=5pi/4.<br>  <br>  To find the global minimum, we must compare x(t) at the boundary with the local minimum.   x(0)=0, and x(2*pi)=exp(-2*pi)*sin(2*pi)=0.<br>  <br>  Thus, the local minimum is also the global minimum.  t=5pi/4 and x(t)=e^(-5pi/4)*sin(5pi/4) approx -0.01<br>  <br>  b).  <br>  <br>  A x''(t) + x'(t) + x(t) = 0<br>  <br>  All you have is take x''(t),x'(t) and x(t) and compute the above figure.  Most of the terms will cancel out and the rest of the terms will for the right value of A.<br>  <br>  The point is that this is an exponentially decaying oscillation.  The general equation for this is Ax''+Bx'+C=0, but they're just trying to show you that the x(t) fits this particular pattern.

X8LNbaKQaa	The ones that are too expensive to build.  This has little to do with your problem, which is, "what kind of truss bridge made with 15 of my small wooden rods with a 21.5 inch span and has the highest strength?"<br>  <br>  Won't all entries have just about the same weight, if they use all the available material?<br>  <br>  In general, designs that bring many members just to the point of failure at the same time, make best use of those materials.  For instance, if you make a design that buckles a single compression member while every other part is only slightly stressed, you didn't distribute the materials very optimally.<br>  <br>  You didn't mention joints.  Are you free to use what ever joint material (glue, for example)  you want, or do you have to use only carved joint that slip wooden parts with things like tenon and peg joints?  If you can choose, pick a strong but not brittle glue (like 5 or even better 20) minute epoxy.  A taller truss generally stresses its members less than a shallow truss, but its compression members are more likely to fail in compression.  I doubt you will have much trouble with any tension members failing except at the joints.  So your problems will all revolve around joint strength and preventing buckling, unless you have a point load.  There (at the point load) you have to worry about shear and bending as you do at the two end support points or areas.  You also need to worry about the rigidity of the bridge being stressed by a mismatch between the bridge shape and the support piers.  You can solve this with a tripod stance, where one end is supported by two points and the other end  is supported at a single point (the three legged stool approach), so that the load will not produce any twist if the piers are not a perfect match (and they won't be).<br>  <br>  If you can't get extra sticks to build a few trials that you can intentionally break  to learn where your weak points are, you might be able to go to a hardware store and get some similar dowels for trials.<br>  <br>  Remember, that unless the specs call for a bridge that carries traffic (needs a road bed) then don't even think of your structure in those terms.  In other words, design it for the intended purpose, only.  If there is any doubt in what is allowed, ask before you build.  Get every freedom and requirement you might have, nailed down first.<br>  <br>  -- <br>  Regards,<br>  <br>  John Popelish
DhLIo8nbaa	Actually being a registered nurse is a great profession because you could work anywhere.  My sister is a registered nurse and we live in Pennsylvania, but she was working in a hospital and was working 12 hour days 4 days a week, so she would work either 7 pm to 7 am or noon to midnight, and she got 3 days off a week, but she recently had a baby so she wanted to work less hours so she went to a nursing home and is working night turn because her husband works during the day so she is at home all day with the baby, and she goes to work when the baby goes to sleep, she goes in at 9pm, and leaves at 6am.  That way she is home and can get a couple hours of sleep before the baby wakes up, and she has the entire day to spend with her son, and also has sometime to spend with her husband at night  <br>  <br>  I always told my sister that she went into the best profession because you can do anything at all.

As a public health nurse, I might start a public education campaign about HIV prevention, safe sex, IV drug abuse, etc.  Then, I might follow up that education campaign by building neighborhood services or improving resources and opportunities - this way, people become more educated about the issue (HIV/AIDS) and have resources to go if they are at risk or need treatment.  It's a great field because you get to help a lot of people and strengthen communities.  <br>  <br>  I have never worked in a hospital and have been an RN for over 10 years.

805d5aa14fdca671ed6b65dfbb2b1962aa	Good question, and no, I don't believe there is a process that removes salt from the oceans. The only process I can think of is the human process of collecting salt, removing it, by evaporation of the water then harvesting the salt, but obviously that's not a natural process.<br>  <br>  There are natural processes that add salt but I don;t think there are any that remove it. <br>  <br>  Ok here's one: a tidal wave carries seawater far inland. The water stands then evaporates, leaving salt residue, removing that salt from the ocean. So maybe any flooding process which results in evaporation might be such a natural process.<br>  <br>  On the whole, though, the oceans always become saltier over time.|`|zf8BnU6Yaa	Evaporation.  But is that really what you are asking about.  Production of salt has been by evaporating sea water which leaves the salt.  But do you want that answer, or where does the salt go?  Given the right conditions salt and other dissolved solids will precipitate from sea water and leave deposits on the ocean floor.|`|WbVE1cXKaa	Yes.  Salt is removed by chemical precipitation both produced by life and by natural reactions, but neither is sufficient to keep salt contents from continuing to rise in response to the inputs.<br>  <br>  The primary buffer of salt content appears to be the circulation of seawater through the sediments and crust, particularly in the areas of spreading centers where there is a high heat flux that makes the circulation happen.  The major ions in the seawater (sodium, calcium, potassium are major constituents lost to the crust in the process) are reacted with minerals in the crust and removed.  Other stuff (say, iron and other base metals) may be left in or added to the fluids but this other stuff tends to fall out as chemical precipitates when the water returns to the sea.<br>  <br>  In a closed system like an isolated basin where there is no free circulation of water with the bulk mass of the ocean (or slow exchange with the oceans, slower than the evaporation rate), evaporation will lead to increased saltiness, as you observe.|`|XNxkNNs2aa	I take it you've heard of the Utah Salt flats? Well, back when dinosaurs roamed, there was an ocean there. Eventually this ocean evaporated. As it dried up, it left deposits of salt behind, making the salt flats we know today. So yes, to answer your question, there is a process, which is evaporation.
7RriQDbkaa	That is not why the oceans are getting saltier.  They are getting saltier as a result of the land and rock erosion which is inevitable.  I don't really know the answer to your question...but I do know that it will take a very very very long time, and I have a feeling that organisms will simply adapt to the changing environment.|`|ShaUAySvaa	wouldn't the fish adapt to the added salt or evolve over time by natural selection|`|bHPB2CuUaa	That's horseshit. The salt in the ocean is due to 4 billion years of salt leaching out of rocks into the ocean water. Your blood is an atavistic remnant of how salty the oceans were when life evolved out of the water onto the land, carrying their own little bit of the ocean around as blood. Your blood is about .9% salt, whereas the oceans today are about 3% salt. So animals left the oceans a long time ago. It is true that the oceans had less salt in the past, but not 30,000 years ago, and it's not from people putting salt on the roads to melt ice. Jeez. In fact, most salt that is mined to use for de-icing is from large deposits where ocean water in the past evaporated, leaving behind Halite (salt) crystals.|`|0gvpklkIaa	the fish would probably adapt, so not all of them would die, but maybe a few species would

YpUhEviCaa	Composition<br>  <br>  Like most of Saturn's moons, Hyperion's low density indicates that it is composed largely of water ice with only a small amount of rock. It is thought that Hyperion may be similar to a loosely accreted pile of rubble in its physical composition. However, unlike most of Saturn's moons, Hyperion has a low albedo (0.2–0.3), indicating that it is covered by at least a thin layer of dark material. This may be material from Phoebe (which is much darker) that got past Iapetus. Hyperion is redder than Phoebe and closely matches the color of the dark material on Iapetus.<br>  <br>  Hyperion has a porosity of about 0.46 [8].<br>  <br>  [edit] Surface features<br>  <br>  Voyager 2 passed through the Saturn system but photographed Hyperion only from a distance. It discerned individual craters and an enormous ridge but was not able to make out the texture of the moon's surface. Early images from the Cassini orbiter suggested an unusual appearance, but it was not until Cassini's sole targeted flyby of Hyperion on September 25, 2005 that the moon's oddness was revealed in full.<br>  <br>  Hyperion's surface is covered with deep, sharp-edged craters that give it the appearance of a giant sponge. Dark material fills the bottom of each crater. The reddish substance contains long chains of carbon and hydrogen and appears very similar to material found on other Saturnian satellites, most notably Iapetus.<br>  <br>  The latest analyses of data obtained by NASA's Cassini spacecraft during its flybys of Hyperion in 2005 and 2006 show that about 40 percent of the moon is empty space. It was suggested in July 2007 that this porosity allows craters to remain nearly unchanged over the eons. The new analyses also confirmed that Hyperion is composed mostly of water ice with very little rock. "We find that water ice is the main constituent of the surface, but it's dirty water ice," said Dale Cruikshank, a researcher at NASA Ames Research Center.[14]

If your assumption of the number of stars is correct, then the chance of one of the monkeys getting 20 characters typed correctly on the first try would be 1/2%.

oVz6sPsIaa	Very good question.  Yes, the speed of light is the limiting speed for the transmission of forces.  In your example the permanent magnet would indeed not feel the force until a year passed.  However if you think about it, for a guy sitting on top of the permanent magnet it would appear instantaneous, since he would 'see' the other guy sitting on the coil throw the switch a year later also.  Meanwhile the guy who threw the switch wouldn't see the effect he had on the permanent magnet for an additional year, which is the time it would take for light to travel back to where he was.
9Wi2eNInaa	See this link because your problem is about torques revolving around a center of mass. That's why it's important about the 49.7 cm being the balance point for your meter stick needs to be figured in your equation. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/handb.html#bal" rel="nofollow">http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hba...</a><br>  <br>  Balance is a concept which implies equilibrium of torques. If you are dealing with a single object, the concept of balance implies that an object is supported in such a way that its weight does not produce any torque about the point of support. It follows that in order to have zero torque, the weight must have zero lever arm and that happens only if it is in line with the point of support<br>  <br>  - So, the center of mass is at 49.7 cm on the meter stick.<br>  - The point at which the torques revolve for zero net force is at 39.2 cm<br>  - From the fulcrum at 39.2 cm to the center of mass at 49.7 cm is a distance of 10.5 cm<br>  - From fulcrum at 39.2 cm to where "Force2" (42 gram mass) is pushing counterclockwise torque is 31.2 cm<br>  - Total distance from Force2 to center of mass =<br>  = 49.7cm - 8 cm= 41.7 cm<br>  - Force1 is force to be solved for, it is the force in grams pushing up in clockwise torque to give net zero force. Newtons are force, I know, but we are only solving for mass of meter stick so you can just use grams for a torque equation because grams are a mass under the influence of  gravitational energy so the force is implied <br>  <br>  So putting it to the equation:<br>  F2 = 42 grams<br>  F1 ( 31.2 cm) = 42 grams ( 41.7 cm)<br>  F1 = (1751.4 grams x cm) / 31.2 cm<br>  <br>  F1 = 56.13 grams <br>  So force pushing up at fulcrum is also going to equal the weight of the meter stick so stick has mass of  56.13 grams<br>  <br>  This answer is right|`|wASE2Ibpaa	First, Find the amount of torque on the fulcrum (8 g multiplied by the 31.2 cm it is away from the Fulcrum). I will make an *** out of myself and assume, that g*cm is equal to Newtons. SO now you have 1310.4 N and 60.8 cm of Meter stick on the other side balancing on the other side. Since the forces balance, the mass on that that end of the stick would have to be 1310.4 N/ 60.8 cm to get about 21.55 g of mass for that end of the stick. Do not forget about the other part. The mass you just calculated was for only 60.8 % of the stick and now you calcualte the rest by multiplying it by 1000/608 to get around 35.92 g for the whole stick. Hope I could be of help, be blessed.|`|zekypS5aaa	I believe all you have to do is calculate the torque at the 39.2cm mark and equate that to the force*distance from the other side of the fulcrum...<br>  <br>  (.392 -.08)m * .042kg * 9.81 = 0.12855 Nm  <br>  this is the torque created by the mass at 8 cm<br>  <br>  0.12855 = F * 0.608m  (0.608 is the remaining length)<br>  <br>  F = 0.211N  This force is spread out over the 60.8 cm<br>  switch back to a mass by dividing by 9.81<br>  <br>  m = 0.215009 kg <br>  divided by 60.8 cm<br>  = 0.000354 kg/cm<br>  times 100 cm<br>  =0.0354 kg or 35.4g total mass

AA11726869	Well, as with any force related problem, you need to start by drawing a free body diagram.  This is relatively easy for this situation:  Directly along the positive y-axis is the normal force, N.  Directly along the negative y-axis is the weight, w=mg.  Directly along the negative x-axis is the friction force, fk.  Finally, at a 30 degree angle above the positive x-axis is the 190N pulling force.<br>  <br>  After drawing your diagram, sum your forces in the x and y directions.  EFx=190cos30-fk=max.  The portion of the 190N force that lies along the x-axis can be found with Trigonometry: cos30=Fx/190, therefore Fx=190cos30.   m is the mass of the box, and ax is the acceleration in the x direction.  If you use common sense, you will realize that since the box is being pulled along the surface, the only acceleration will be in the x direction, so ax can simply go to a.  That also implies that there will be no acceleration in the y direction.<br>  <br>  Sum the forces in the y direction:  EFy=N+190sin30-mg=0 because there is no acceleration in the y direction.  The final equation you need is the friction equation, fk=ukN.<br>  <br>  First, solve for N in the summed y forces:<br>  N=mg-190sin30<br>  N=39(9.81)-95<br>  N=287.59N<br>  <br>  Next, solve for fk in the friction equation:<br>  fk=ukN<br>  fk=(.420)(287.59)<br>  fk=120.79N<br>  <br>  Finally, solve for a in the summed x forces:<br>  190cos30-fk=ma<br>  164.54-120.79=39a<br>  43.76=39a<br>  a=1.12m/s^2.

There is no reason to link it with 2012. As for rotational pole shift, that would take a huge amount of force on the earth.

X0e6p9Ilaa	Acetic acid behaves like a weak organic acid.  The HC2H3O2 molecules are dissolved in water, but very few of them actually dissociate into hydrogen ions and acetate ions.  The Ka of acetic acid is 1.8 x 10^-5, which means that it will be about 1 percent dissociated.<br>  <br>  HC2H3O2(aq) <==> H+ + C2H3O2^-<br>  The equilibrium lies to the left, meaning that acetic acid will exist primarily as the undissociated weak acid.<br>  <br>  ======== Follow up ==========<br>  <br>  Why would it bubble?  It would only bubble if a gas was given off.  There is no gas being given off unless the acid is reacting with something like sodium bicarbonate.  And the bubbles are CO2 that are coming from the sodium bicarbonate, not the acetic acid.  No.  You can nix the bubbles.|`|4OnlAEQuaa	it bubbles then neutralizes

However, I've never been contacted by a spirit in my dreams although I know it's possible via my friend who is of the Wicca religion.  Considering that it's a little known fact that we can Astral Project in our dreams it's not a far stretch to say that spirits can come into them.  Although I wouldn't mess with the unknown without further research and professional help from either a Wiccan, Pagan, or someone who knows more about Dreamology.|`|380b53c18cfb9588bad18dd0f231a984aa	Dream telepathic awareness is scientifically established by excellent research at e.g. Stanford Medical School; <a href="http://www.lucidity.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.lucidity.com</a> has links/accounts.<br>  <br>  The only variable, then, is whether spirits exist, and if so are such able to telepathically communicate.<br>  <br>  Those who study in depth this issue (e.g., Ann Ree Colton, "Watch Your Dreams," Mark Prophet, "The Masters and Their Retreats," <a href="http://www.astraldynamics.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.astraldynamics.com</a> ) affirm both the existence of "spirits" and their ability to influence.<br>  <br>  A few basic points building upon the above assumptions/evidence:  there are energy laws, such as Eve not being tempted beyond her subconscious susceptibility, without serious consequences upon the "talking serpent."  Second, one's waking subconscious becomes one's dreamnig consciousness, and for too many people their waking subconscious is hidden behind a "mask" of civility.  Hence, in dreams, many people tend to be influenced, seduced, even as many others find angelic telepathies helpful in climbing "Jacob's Ladder of divine ascent" on a nightly basis.  Third, one's sincerity of prayer to God to protect, teach, and heal one's soul while one's body rests at night is key to how the soul in fact reacts to subliminal seductions when it leaves the body, even if only a few feet away.  Fourthly, consider the physical world:  many would give somewhat self-centered advice; the situation in the astral world is more so, as the better "spirits" move on quickly to higher Schools of Light and Universities of the Spirit ("Testimony of Light," Helen Greaves).  Simply being "on the other side" does not a wise sage make.  Few humans in embodiment realize or "see through" what Saint Paul termed "masquerading as an angel of Light."  If one cannot do so with a good deal of certainty, one really is not able to evaluate "spirit contact" or "spirit guides."|`|HnCrGIDPaa	umm...possibily.|`|Shf5HcDBaa	We're no "experts" but they could be influencing your dreams or may be trying to contact you.

I learned a lot with that scope and my daughter and her husband are learning with it now.   <br>  <br>  The Orion site has some excellent diagrams and explanations of all types of scopes and mounts. <br>  <br>  Things to consider are size--can the user lift and transport the scope to the viewing site easily? If not, then it will gather dust in a closet. Can the viewer reach all the knobs and buttons? I have a long tube large manual refractor and it is very dificult for me to reach the knobs when I am pointed to Zenith. I am not a tall person. <br>  <br>  Take your time in making your decision. It is important to get the right scope for you and for your needs. <br>  <br>  I would like to suggest that you join a local astronomy club or astronomical society BEFORE you spend your money on a scope. There are many different kinds of scopes and what is perfect for one person is not perfect for another. Everyone has their own set of eyeballs and no two are the same. If you join a club, you can attend a few of their star parties and try out members scopes to see what works best for YOU, before you buy a scope. The members can also help you when you get your scope and show you how to get the most out of your new scope as well as to help teach you where the treasures in the sky are located. Most clubs have loaner scopes and extensive libraries that you can gather more information from too. Most clubs will have monthly membership meetings with informative presentations given by members and by guest speakers. You can really learn a lot from these clubs and an added plus is all the great new freinds you make there too. <br>  <br>  Some people will suggest that you purchase binnoculars. Not a bad idea but dont buy anything less than 10x50 and you must have a tripod too or you will not be happy with your astronomical views because they will be too shakey from your movements. Personally, I prefer a scope to binos because if binoculars are not aligned properly at the factory, then you get double images and distortions that cant be fixed. Most of the cheaper binoculars are not properly aligned. That is not as important for terrestial viewing but it is a killer for astronomical viewing. <br>  <br>  But when you buy go Orion and you wont be disappointed. Don't try to learn everything all at once or you will be overwhelmed and discouraged. Patience is the key to Astronomy. <br>  <br>  You will also need a good star chart program. <br>  <a href="http://www.stellarium.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.stellarium.org/</a> <br>  This is great freeware that you can download.

The Dob mount is rock solid stable, and cheap.  That leaves money for optics.  A great scope on a poor mount is a poor scope.  Given the choice of a Dob mount, the Newtonian design is the one that puts the eyepiece near where your eye might be.  This said, the Astroscan is $200, and isn't exactly a dob, yet is also a reasonable choice.  It's a ball mount.<br>  <br>  This one is $200.  4.5" aperture (114 mm), stable mount, great optics.

kGUpSkhEaa	CF4, CCl4, CBr4, CI4.<br>  <br>  It's not due molecular weight. It's because CF4 is less polarizable than CCl4, because a smaller molecule will be less likely to form temporal dipoles. And these temporal dipoles account for the fact that a nonpolar substance is gas, liquid, or solid, acting as intermolecular forces. CF4 is smaller than CCl4, and this one is smaller than CBr4, and also CI4. Also, fluorine compounds use to have very low boiling points.|`|luYtFLSUaa	All have tetrahedral geometry, and are therefore non-polar.

Nk3eQbM7aa	If you can dig up a picture of a cubic-close-packed (or face-centered-cubic--same thing) unit cell, it'll help.  The unit cell has a square faces, and the diagonal of the face is two diameters of the sphere. The side of the unit cell is that over root2. In this case, it's 202.23 pm on a side. The volume of the unit cell is that number cubed.<br>  <br>  There are 4 atoms in the unit cell, so the mass is the mass of 4 aluminum atoms.  It's easy to get the mass in g/mol, just divide by avogadros number to get the mass per atom.<br>  <br>  You've now got mass and volume, divide to get density, and convert to the right units.  A bit of a pain, but doable.

InAICv25aa	It's a "broad" type of major and it keeps many choices open. It is much easier to go into mathematics and then get a PhD in Economics, for example, than for an Economics major in college to get a PhD in Economics. The reason for this is that PhD programs for Economics require you to take many advanced math classes that Economics majors don't need to take in order to graduate. <br>  <br>  The only problem I found is that it also limits your writing skills. Don't go into it if you want a job that requires you to write well.|`|nhwvYAJ6aa	MATH IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE it gives clear information about on how we answer problems and so on? thats all .. math is very interesting subeject so GO Math?|`|TqiMnCv6aa	I second what the others have said, but I disagree that it limits one's writing skills.  Just add a course in technical writing and a course in the social sciences where you have to analyze and defend issues.|`|miajdP4jaa	You can use a math degree for pretty much any career path. Mathematicians are highly sought-after due to their analytical and problem solving skills. It's not just the math you learn at college that's important, it's the skills that high level problems teach you that can be transferred to almost anything.<br>  I don't know about America, but over here in the UK a math degree is one of the most employable degrees around. In this time of job cuts and insecurity, having a math degree gives you the best chance of finding and retaining a job.<br>  Math itself is important because numbers are the basis of our whole society. How would money work without math? How would buildings be designed and constructed? The math you learn at school may seem pointless at times, but it really is the system that underpins everything we know in our lives today.|`|0t6TdLdEaa	Math is very important. Everything can be explained mathematically! I've heard that most mathematician jobs require a Ph.D. in mathematics but there are many jobs that a bachelors degree in math will benefit you. For example: computer programming, accounting, and a lot of math majors are good business men (or women) because finances and math go hand in hand!|`|A9JV4uAxaa	Math is all around us...every single job requires it, no matter what it is. I can garuntee that you don't go one day without using it.

If mathematics didn't exist, nothing would.
AA11432707	You have absolutely NO idea of the sheer amount of work involved in just being a physician.  You can't possibly - you're still a child.<br>  <br>  There certainly are physicians who have successful business enterprises, sometimes medically related, sometimes not.  That is something to pursue when you are well established as a physician, which could happen when you're in your late 30's to early 40's.<br>  <br>  Or, if business is what really interests you, go that route.  There's nothing wrong with being a successful entrepreneur.|`|hQIqEnTEaa	When you become a fully qualified doctor you can choose to go into private practice. This means you rent your own rooms, employ your own staff (receptionists, practice nurse, other doctors etc), buy your own equipment etc.<br>  <br>  To go into private practice you will have to qualify as a doctor, work in a hospital while you are training and pass your exams before you can open your own practice. All of this takes many years. You would probably be in your 40s by the time you are fully qualified and in a financial position to open your own practice. <br>  <br>  You have to decide whether you are willing to wait this long to start getting your fingers into the business side of it.

These zoologist's don't necessarily got to school to learn this field of science because it's such a questioning field, and scientist can never totallyprove that something doesn't exist because new evidence are always brought about.  If I were to get into this field I'd make sure I had a backing in biology, zoology, and anthropology. Sciences are important into studying the unknown creatures.  I think your money would vary depending on what job you did, or how serious the work was.  I'm going to say your salary would be between $32,000 to $55,000.  That's just a rough estimate.  It seems to be a very interesting profession.  Because there are over 2 million animal species left unknown. New species come up every day.  So you'd always have work.

Aty76cgqaa	Yes. Due to the rotation of a planet, the orb takes on an oblate shape. This causes a slight increase in gravitational attraction around the equatorial plane. Dust and ice particles unable to accrete into a moon would tend to form in a disk along this zone.|`|bb5e3162f4c207ab157801f357f83c36aa	Yes, they must, because the rotation of the planet causes the shape of the planet to be an oblate spheroid.  The gravitational field of an oblate spheroid would exert torques on a non-equatorial ring that would rip it apart and cause the particles within it to collide violently.

599b4TcHaa	Sounds like we could be studying for the same test....<br>  <br>  In class lecture it was said that stratified epithelial tissue slows diffusion (due to the extra cell layers).<br>  <br>  The first responder to your post is correct - muscle cells contain contractile proteins that the other tissue types do not. Neurons do not produce myelin - they conduct impulses. <br>  <br>  According to class lecture, polarity means one end does not look like the other end: one end is free and the other is attached. <br>  <br>  My textbook says the following about epithelial polarity:<br>  <br>  All epithelia have an apical surface (an upper surface exposed to the body exterior or the cavity of an internal organ) and a lower attached basal surface. Thus, all epithelia exhibit apical-basal polarity, meaning cell regions near the apical surface differ from those near the basal surface in structure and function….tight junctions keep proteins in the apical region from diffusing into the basal region, thus maintaining polarity.|`|OgQ8opeAaa	Not completely sure about the first one.  Different junctions between cells in different tissues can effect diffusion speed (e.g., tight junctions, gap junctions, etc).<br>  <br>  Muscle cells contain actin and myosin (protein elements); these allow for muscular contraction and are not found in epithelial or neural cells.<br>  <br>  Myelin producing cells (such as Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system) produce myelin.<br>  <br>  Polarity deals with the set-up of the cell membrane such that lipophilic molecules may pass through while hydrophilic molecules can not.

In this view, evolution is seen as generally smooth and continuous.<br>  <br>  In 1972 paleontologists Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould published a landmark paper developing this idea. Their paper was built upon Ernst Mayr's theory of geographic speciation, I. Michael Lerner's theories of developmental and genetic homeostasis, as well as their own empirical research. Eldredge and Gould proposed that the degree of gradualism championed by Charles Darwin was virtually nonexistent in the fossil record, and that stasis dominates the history of most fossil species.

Or like an alphabet, with 3 "letter" words, called codons.<br>  <br>  Basically, depending on the order of base pairs in a sequence you get different amino acids.

The monomers from which nucleic acids are constructed are called nucleotides.<br>  <br>  Each nucleotide consists of three components: a nitrogenous heterocyclic base, which is either a purine or a pyrimidine; a pentose sugar; and a phosphate group. Nucleic acid types differ in the structure of the sugar in their nucleotides - DNA contains 2-deoxyriboses while RNA contains ribose (where the only difference is the presence of a hydroxyl group). Also, the nitrogenous bases found in the two nucleic acid types are different: adenine, cytosine, and guanine are found in both RNA and DNA, while thymine only occurs in DNA and uracil only occurs in RNA. Other rare nucleic acid bases can occur, for example inosine in strands of mature transfer RNA.<br>  <br>  Nucleic acids are usually either single-stranded or double-stranded, though structures with three or more strands can form. A double-stranded nucleic acid consists of two single-stranded nucleic acids held together by hydrogen bonds, such as in the DNA double helix. In contrast, RNA is usually single-stranded, but any given strand may fold back upon itself to form secondary structure as in tRNA and rRNA. Within cells, DNA is usually double-stranded, though some viruses have single-stranded DNA as their genome. Retroviruses have single-stranded RNA as their genome.<br>  <br>  The sugars and phosphates in nucleic acids are connected to each other in an alternating chain, linked by shared oxygens, forming a phosphodiester bond. In conventional nomenclature, the carbons to which the phosphate groups attach are the 3' end and the 5' end carbons of the sugar. This gives nucleic acids polarity. The bases extend from a glycosidic linkage to the 1' carbon of the pentose sugar ring. Bases are joined through N-1 of pyrimidines and N-9 of purines to 1' carbon of ribose through N-β glycosyl bond.

It merely clicks over from 12.19.19.17.19 to 13.0.0.0.0 on 21st December 2012. That's all there is to it. The Mayans themselves never predicted the end of the world would happen at that time.<br>  All the doomsday predictions attached to this date are, without exception, unscientific nonsense, perpetrated by frauds and hoaxers.<br>  And there's no alignment between Saturn, Jupiter and the Sun.|`|jcGeCJnOaa	Yes it true the Mayan calender ends in 2012. No, the world will not end. <br>  <br>  1) The Mayans did not have a monopoly on time. <br>  <br>  2) The Mayan civilization fell some 400 to 500 years ago so their calenders couldn't have been that good.<br>  <br>  3) The reason the Mayan calender ends in 2012 is because they ran out of stone and couldn't carve beyond that date. Fortunately we have much more accurate means of tracking time. <br>  <br>  4) A theory is based upon observation and can be tested.

But our calendar has years of the same length except for leap years every 4 years.  And further adjustments are made on a longer time scale.  It is kind of a convention and the Maya calculated their year in a much different way, with complex months and stuff so they carried this complex calculation out a long way and finally their calendar would need resetting for complicated reasons.  But they never specified an end to the world, only that they would start a new calendar.|`|bb5e3162f4c207ab157801f357f83c36aa	One cycle of the Mayan calendar ends then, and a new one begins.

Satanists and many pagan cultures from every corner of the world all throughout history have celebrated this like the Sumerians, Babylonians, Cherokee, Hopi, Chinese I-Ching (confirmed by Terence McKenna), Mayans (Pacal Votan; Chilam Balam of Tizimin, Mani, Chumayel; Jaguar Prophet), Egyptians, Celts, etc. This evil event is called "the abomination that causes desolation" that will be set up in the Jewish Temple's Holy of Holies when the antichrist is imbued with the spirit of satan himself.

eUgwHzeqaa	Because the applications process, basically, at some level, is a crapshoot.<br>  <br>  I know they don't want you to think that.  And it doesn't mean that qualified candidates won't get in while unqualified ones will.  What it does mean is that each school has a limited number of spaces, that there is no "magic formula" that every school uses to try and compete for all the same applicants, and that it depends on any number of factors that the applicant can't really control.  It also means that once you get to the interview phase, everyone is "qualified" and where you get in/waitlisted/rejected just doesn't make a whole lot of objective sense.  (I hate to tell you, but it doesn't get much better when you apply for residency, either.)<br>  <br>  All of the schools that you list are very fine institutions.  Ivy League is great, but all of those schools get a hundred applicants for every space they have.  Congratulations to your sister, but remember the old joke:  What do they call the person who graduates last in their class from any medical school?<br>  <br>  'Doctor.'  ;-)|`|DhLIo8nbaa	I definately think that is odd, but medical schools only let a certain number of students in and maybe they did not have a spot open for her.  They give preferance to the people who went to their undergrad school, and preferance to students who have parents as alumni, and so that could have played a part in it.  Also maybe they were just already met their quota when she applied.  If she got into Harvard then she is obviously very smart and she should consider herself very lucky because she will do very well for herself from going there.  Maybe those other schools just did not see something in her that they needed, but she got one of the best schools there is so she should not question it.|`|8V2KIPw3aa	Usually the interview makes or breaks you.  In addition, different schools look for different qualities in their applicants.

YbVFL3SOaa	Years ago I had a friend who was hearing impaired and was in medical school.  I lost track of him many years ago but I assume he finished and has been practicing medicine in the hearing impaired community for many years.  He was amazing at lip reading and spoke with a nasal quality to his speech but was readily under stood.  So if you are questioning whether you could become a physician if you are hearing impaired...the answer is an unqualified yes.|`|DhLIo8nbaa	I have never personally experienced that situation, but I do not see anything wrong with that.  No matter if they are hearing impaired or not, if they went through medical school then they are just as compatant as any other doctor.  I am sure that there would be a sign lenguage interpreter in the room and some people are even good enough to read lips.  I actually have a collegue in one of my PhD classes and she is going to school for therapy and she is deaf, but she can read lips and she is going to be a therapist so I see nothing wrong with it as long as it does not impair their work.  If it would bother you then you could always change doctors but if he is a board certfied physician then it is because they see him fit to practoce medacine and they do not let just anyone become a doctor it takes alot of hard work.|`|2pl7Vmyhaa	My doctor is deaf.

If it was, would they twist the facts about the animals and wouldn't they be breeding actually endangered animals? Just a thought....<br>  <br>  to my knowledge there are very  few places that offer orca interactions- and for good reasons. Captive orcas have acquired quite a track record of aggression towards trainers:<br>  <a href="http://www.geocities.com/theorcaocean/OrcaAgression.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/theorcaocean/Or...</a><br>  and these are people who interact with them on a daily basis, allowing visitors to interact freely with them would be plain irresponsible. In actual fact, very few aquariums still have water work (ie. trainers going into the water with trainers) because they are aware of the danger. Bottlenose dolphin interaction programs are dangerous enough both for people and animals. Headbutts, nips and shoves are not uncommon and on the other side the animals are at risk from being touched inappropriately (eyes,blowholes) and disease transfer.<br>  <br>  Interacting with wild cetaceans is prohibited in most of the world as it has shown to have adverse effects on their behaviour such as displacing them from their foraging grounds. The truth is, people like interacting with dolphins, dolphins don't neccessarily want to interact with people!! We like dolphins so we think dolphins must like us but that is simply not true, some are fairly curious but most just want to be left to do what dolphins do!<br>  There are some places in Norway where you can swim with them but most of these programshave strict no touch-no direct approach policies as not to affect the animals.

Different family groups have varying ways of socialzing with one another, traveling, and hunting. These animals are incredibly intelligent. And, I just discovered that they are actually not whales, but members of the Dolphin family! -of course, they're the biggest and brainiest.<br>  <br>  I have a family friend, who back in the 60s and 70s worked with Orcas (along with varying other species of marine life, including training the original Flipper) at one of the earlier sea-world-esque aquariums. He's got some hilarious stories about one female Orca he worked closely with- one where, because he wasn't giving her attention, she ripped his expensive, brand new wet suit clear off right infront of some woman and her daughter... he was butt naked and not happy. <br>  <br>  The other story, they were doing a small show after new year's eve (everyone working had hangovers) and the orca could tell he wasn't feeling good, so she decided to try and get away with not doing her tricks all the way. Because she was only doing her tricks half way, he would only give her half a fish. Needless to say, this made her mad. They finally got to the part of the show where my friend was supposed to stick his head inside her mouth... <br>  <br>  Now you know how huge Orcas are, so when a person sticks their head in one's mouth, it's really that person's entire upper body leaning over inside of it looking down a giant, endless Orca throat.  Well, since the orca was upset she wasn't getting whole treats, she started messing around with my friend while his head was in her mouth, by licking him and harassing him with her toungue-- which is scary, becuase you don't want to accidentally fall all the way in and down that huge throat. So he starts cursing and yelling at her while he's inside her mouth (and of course he has a microphone on so the entire audience can hear him), and this makes her even more mad... all of a sudden he hears a gurgle and rumbling from deep within the orca's throat.. he's thinking "what on earth...?" and suddenly this wave of fish-gut vomit comes gushing from the orca's stomach and overflows and sends him flying out of her mouth. He's hung over and covered in orca vomit, and on top of that he starts puking all over the stage, and all the while the audience in cheering and clapping. Best show ever. The moral of this story is- don't piss orcas off.<br>  <br>  In any case, my friend says that Dolphins and Orcas are kind of like dogs. They're fun-loving and want your attention.. however they're far more intelligent.  <br>  <br>  As far as you being able to swim with them/touch them, the only reliable way to go about doing that (with any kind of marine animal) is to get into marine biology and actually work with the animals. If you go through a tourist-type place where you can pay to swim with them (especially in countries outside of the US that don't have animal protection laws), the whales/dolphins are miserable animals. They are tightly confined for most of their lives, are forced to swim with/entertain people all day long. They are overworked, and very very understimulated. It is also these "tourist-attraction" animals that you tend to see on tv when they have lashed out or attacked a person for seemingly no reason- they're really just unhappy.<br>  <br>  Perhaps the only exception would be a credited aquarium that has research programs (like sea world) where perhaps you could volunteer or get a backstage pass.. although that type of thing may only be for seeing Dolphins, as Orcas are more dangerous (think lawsuits...).<br>  <br>  The most important thing in all of this is that these are highly intelligent creatures that require constant and challenging stimulation (Dolphins actually understand complex grammar).<br>  <br>  As for research on Orcas, I highly suggest National Geographic. They're stuff is fascinating and reliable. (There's also a recent amaaaazing article on animal intelligence.) --I've given you links to some great articles under sources.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and I admire your passion!|`|qJXdyUY3aa	Unfortunately I don't believe you are able to swim with them at Sea World unless you're one of their trainers. :(|`|CzBNTeLAaa	Sea World <a href="http://www.seaworld.org/infobooks/KillerWhale/home.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.seaworld.org/infobooks/Killer...</a>
lzeRy3Qmaa	I know hair color and eye color are both fairly complicated genetically (moreso than you would think).  But from my understanding, hair color and eye color are NOT linked to each other.<br>  <br>  In other words, having red hair does not mean you are necessarily more likely to have a certain eye color.  You would have to look at the allelic frequency within different populations...and I think our wanting to link red hair (and blonde hair) with lighter eyes deals with (Northern) Europeans in general having lighter hair and lighter eyes, while Southern Europeans, Africans, Asians, etc. all tend to have dark hair and dark eyes.<br>  <br>  One thing I can say is that brown/dark eyes are dominant to lighter (say, blue, eyes); and red hair I believe is recessive.  So both of your parents would at least have to be carriers of the red hair gene (or they could have red hair), while only one of them would have to have dark eyes in order to pass that on.<br>  <br>  To cut through the BS, I would say that as our genes get more mixed, then it will be less infrequent than you might imagine.  But considering that places like Ireland have a high(er) frequency of the red hair gene, and the lighter eyed genes, then I would bet that it is quite a bit more rare than red hair and light eyes.  But I would also bet that that will change more and more over the next couple generations.<br>  <br>  P.S. - The rumor that red hair is 'dying out' is a myth.  Recessive genes can skip generations, and that is what we are seeing as it is getting 'worked into' the gene pool.|`|N74L3R3Raa	Yes, it's rare to have red hair and brown eyes.

But you will need  special tools to hold the gem still and a special drill press or drill stand to give you even a vague glimmer of a hope of getting through without converting you gem to pretty little splinters.  You can set the emerald in a resin or epoxy and then clamp that still.

xXOnjDNOaa	Your paragraph seems ok.  _Inter_molecular bonds are between two different molecules (for instance a hydrogen bond is a force between two molecules, and is what accounts for many of the unique properties of water. It is an interaction between the O on one molecule of water and an H on a different molecule.  The bond itself isn't part of the molecular structure of water, and if you evaporate it to a gas you will just have H2O, but when it is in liquid and solid forms this H-bond between two H2O molecules becomes important).  The _intra_ molecular bond is for within the same molecule, for instance both of the O-H bonds present in a water molecule.  In the gas phase both of these bond will still be there.

You will need a 4-year degree (baccalaureate), 4-year medical school for MD, 4-year residency, and 1 year fellowship in emergency medicine.|`|a4kTbjfeaa	Previous answer is correct except that you do not need a fellowship for emergency medicine. After graduating med school you do an emergency medicine residency which is usually 3-4 years. After this you can work as an attending physician or if you desire to specialize you can do a fellowship (EM fellowships are toxicology, critical care/trauma, ultrasound).|`|K5IOSGXAaa	yes, that is correct, figure 13 years, it is just like any other physician.

xT024KMsaa	Only some of the more strictly religious folk will say that there is any problem with the theory of evolution. Most people that I know are Christian, but believe in a mix of creationism and evolution. That a god started it all, and designed things as we see them, but that it was a long process that may or may not be continuing- not that everything was here in 7 days.    Personally, I am atheist and believe that the big bang started it all, earth cooled, evolution followed. To each his/her own though.|`|RYQ3i0ZNaa	There's nothing wrong with evolution - it is face.    The only problem is with religious people who take the bible to be the literal truth - i.e. they thing there was a woman called eve, who came from this guy called adam's rib.. which is obviously complete crap.   Yes, if you wish to be religious, "let their be light" could mean the big-bang. It's all up to your personal interpretation of religion. But there is nothing, absolutely nothing, wrong with evolution.|`|T7HLKcFLaa	Personally I don't think there's anything wrong with evolution. I am a creationist, and I believe that any scientific theory we have about evolution cannot completely disprove the existence of God because God could have made any of those things happen.    He might have created the first life forms, then caused them to evolve and adapt to become dinosaurs and so on. So there's nothing wrong with evolution or the big bang no matter whether you have a scientific point of view or a religious one, really. Also, nobody really knows what happened during the big bang (if there was one), so everyone should be entitled to make their own judgements about it. It's just a theory, so it's neither good nor bad :)|`|AA11251285	Some people say it's bad because it goes against the LITERAL translation of the Bible in which God created the world in 6 days.

As for " let there be light": That's the statement God made when he started creation. If You read further, he made lots of other things, so why are you sticking to that one passage.

b1a356a171cfdc067007281982717464aa	Well, they would look SIMILAR, but not identical.  Keep in mind that when sex cells are produced, there's some imperfection in the DNA copying, and also that each child only gets half of his or her DNA from his or her parents, and finally that DNA distribution is basically equal regardless of sex.    So they'd look like brothers and sisters as opposed to cousins, but the kids wouldn't be identical to one another.|`|kNFH5lKnaa	they'd be cousins but nearly identical, as a Doppleganger.|`|DJo0E2I2aa	no  keep in mind that children have some traits from the mother and some from the father, and when you do a punnit square, there's four possibilities, for example, both identical sets have brown eyes, but  carry the blue eye gene, if you do a punnit square out you'll find that there is a 1-4 chance the clild will have blue eyes, the same goes for hair color, shape of toes, weather or not they will be color blind, whether or not they'll get migraines, and presence of a widows peak, and there's tons more, so one cousin can have brown eyes, and blond hair with a widows peak, and the other can have brown hair, blue eyes, and no peak|`|RfJ13ML8aa	When you think about it, if a couple has children and then have more later on, the situation is the same genetically. The parents genes don't change.    Siblings look similar bt not identical and this would be the same situation if there were two sets of identical parents having children.
AlJrVK8Gaa	Yes it is true.  What causes the seasons is the tilting of the earth's axis.  In the summer (for the northern hemisphere) the axis is tilted towards the sun.  That means we are closer to the sun.  Alaska is so far north that when the earth rotates and "night sets in" it is still exposed to the sun.  If you are in Alaska, the sun looks like it is traveling in circles, instead or across the sky.<br>  <br>  Also, in the winter, Alaska is almost always dark for the same reason, that the earth's axis is tilted away from the sun.|`|V7JVKApkaa	It's only true 24 hour sun north of the Arctic Circle.<br>  <br>  Just below the Arctic Circle, it will appear like the sun has set, still very much lit, then it will come out again. The further south you go, the longer the sunset then sunrise, and the darker the sky will get.|`|8YTdztTSaa	Because of the angle of the earths surface is round, different places are at different angles to the sun.  The equator has short daylight in the summer, and as you get towards the poles, the sunlight hours increase until at the poles they have daylight 24 hrs/day in summer.  Each hemisphere is different, so a sunny summer in Alaska/north pole will mean that antartica is in winter and in complete darkness and vice versa.|`|wy25UY33aa	yes its true during the summer Alaska is facing the sun all year<br>  <br>  but during the winter it doesn't face it at all<br>  <br>  it is due to how close it is to the north pole

YYLybWHSaa	To look to canine food hoarding look to their closer relatives for comparable behaviors first. It is common across the genera (fox species & wild dog species cache food).  http://books.google.com/books?id=AhlvmkS...    Hiding food is a very common survival behavior in more than mammals.  Many vertebrate taxa have some form of food hoarding behavior. Birds stash food as well as mammals. The behavior is common to organisms that also devote parental care in rearing their young by bringing food closer to the young. Even the insect order of hymenoptera like the bee stores food as the first step in caring for their young. Many mammals that provide milk also stash food so the mother does not travel far away often while nursing.  Western scrub jays are well known and studies for food caching behavior as are shrikes  http://www.vet-magazin.com/wissenschaft/...

9Wi2eNInaa	The DNA and RNA are actually the spiral of the double helix. The ladder rungs of the DNA are the amino acids. Since only amino acids can fit between the "ladder supports" that is how the DNA makes it's code. How many of the four amino acids and in what order it puts them spells out all the genetic information for that cell. The only purpose of the DNA (RNA is what happens when DNA goes through the replication process). The amino acids are only used for coding and not for nutrients to the cell. The ladder supports, the double helix, of the DNA contains the amino acids so they can't react with anything else      The functional group in amino acids is the carboxyl group.     (The amine is the backbone of the amino acid, so is not the actual group responsible for chemical reactions)    The cell wall is made of cellulose. When they are in a series, such as wood, they form a cellulose fiber.    Cellulose is a polymer of glucose, so it is essentially linked sugars, but in a configuration that presents some structural integrity, but is still flexible|`|a4edf2e40162015de63a4dff47980bbbaa	For the first one, the best answer is because it does. I'm not sure what kind of answer the instructor would be looking for here, other than a description of transcription and translation and all that stuff.    Amino acids all have 2 functional groups:  A carboxyl group and an amino group.    If you're talking about plants, it is cellulose fibers that gives strength to the cell walls. Bacteria have molecules called peptidoglycan that make their walls strong.    Hope these make some sense.|`|HEzWkWS7aa	The first answer is good:)  I think in Reference to your first question is that DNA and RNA does not code for the tertiary structure of proteins or how amino acid interact with one another to create their configurations in space. All amino acids are charged and these charges cause them to fold in 3 dimensional ways. DNA and RNA sequence have no bearing on that property of proteins.

Methane degrades into C02.  So it is really bad for a little while and then just bad after that.  It can't build up in the atmosphere over millions or even hundreds of years. <br>  <br>  2.  There were A LOT less dinosaurs than there are now people.  People and farm animals create methane too, so the problem from biological methane is way worse now.  An then there is deforestation, burning fossil fuels on top of that.... we are much much worse for the planet than dinosaurs ever were.|`|W2suykEtaa	maybe all those volcanoes they show in the background of the dinosaur pictures burn it off?|`|DRVSCxKpaa	The answer is biomass.  Just because there were dinosaurs that were huge, doesn't mean there were a lot of them, or their total mass was any greater than the mass of living things today.  A plant eating dinosaur had to eat a huge amount of vegetation to stay alive, and their numbers were in balance with the vegetation.  The meat eating dinosaurs were very few by comparison.  The same balance of nature can still be seen today in places like the Serengeti plains of Africa.

MZbxHhOsaa	I'm not sure how much you know so i'll start from the top. <br>  Things are made out of atoms, and those atoms are in constant motion. <br>  Generally, they are free to move as they like in gases, they are free to move with in the substance as a liquid, and they vibrate in solids.<br>  When you have a solid, and the things start to vibrate so ferociosly that they begin to move, thats when solids melt into a liquid. <br>  <br>  So, you have a liquid such as water. All the molecules are moving, but they are moving with low enough speed that they cannot escape the force that keeps the substance a liquid, let's call it water tension. <br>  <br>  However, not all the molecules move at the same speeds, they follow a distribution of velocities centered around a value based on it's temperature(called the maxwell boltzman distribution), so even for cool water there is a probability that a molecule will be moving at such a high velocity it can escape the "water tension" and become a gas, thus evaporating. <br>  You can think of it as billard balls, even if you have every ball moving at the same speed to begin with,  if they are moving in all directions, some will eventually collide leaving some balls moving faster and some moving slower.|`|wnxOXBuKaa	Here's a link to the wiki page about evaporation.<br>  <br>  In the theory section, it will explain why water evaporates. <br>  <br>  In a nut shell, the water has to be near the surface, moving in the proper direction and have enough kenetic energy (moving fast enough) and it will change to it's vapor state. <br>  <br>  Read up on it on that page and I'm sure it will give you the answers you actually need for your lab.|`|rwG4JPXQaa	it doesnt have to boil to evaporate|`|bHPB2CuUaa	Same reason your hair dries without putting it in the microwave.|`|mI4lrKdHaa	Ha=ha. this guy probably still dries his hair in the oven....cheers|`|smy7GHkXaa	Water doesn't have to reach its boiling point, before it will evaporate.  Just think about the water on your skin, after getting wet; you don't have to get your skin real hot (100 degrees Celsius, or, 212 degrees Fahrenheit..which are water's boiling points), before it evaporates away, right?  And it's the same with the ocean.  The water in the surface layer will evaporate away into the atmosphere, even though it hasn't reached water's boiling point.  Your are getting the terms "evaporation point" and "boiling point" mixed up, thinking that they are the same...which they aren't.  Does that make sense?
kKSpHtDWaa	That's hard to do with multiple species, especially just from a petstore.  The easiest options are often insects since they can get along very well, but doing what you want to do would be extremely hard.  First off, the mammal would most likely eat the reptile and the fish at the same time.  I really wouldn't try to do the fish tank thing since you would need a pretty high tank to do that.  I would suggest possibly getting some frogs and lizards.  Petstores really don't offer much that can coexist in the terms of insects.  Tarantulas and scorpions don't really like anyone else.  You could throw in a hermit crab, but that wouldn't be very exciting.  My suggestion is to just buy a fish tank with some nice fish like tetras or guppies and a separate one with mammals/reptiles/amphibians/insects.  The "/" means 'or' not all together.

It can't really protect itself by shutting down.  If it shuts down, something is seriously wrong.  Calling it pressure from "surrounding fluid" is also a little misleading because it sounds like you are describing hydrocephalus, which is certainly a cause of increased intracranial pressure (ICP), but is not the same thing as cerebral edema.  Cerebral edema is indeed an excess of fluid in the brain, but fluid that is related to cells swelling or to leaky blood vessels, not cerebrospinal fluid *around* the brain.<br>  <br>  For cerebral edema to cause a coma, damage must already have occurred.  This could be because of ischemia (lack of blood flow) caused by the pressure of the increased fluid, or because neurons have already been destroyed, or even that herniation (the pathological movement of the brain within the skull) has already occurred.  That is why "altered mental status" is so important and why we worry about whether patients are alert and oriented when they come in after a head injury or in cases of infarct or altitude sickness or whatever it is that is causing the increased intracranial pressure.<br>  <br>  There are different mechanisms and causes for cerebral edema, but the main thing to remember in all of them is that there is water *in* the brain that doesn't belong there for one reason or another.|`|2YZC52Nnaa	When a patient suffers from cerebral edema, the pressure from the surrounding fluid (edema) compresses the brain.  As a "safety" precaution, the brain protects itself by going into a coma.  In this state, only the absolutely necessary functions work, i.e., lungs, heart, etc...  Until the compression/edema can be resolved odds are, for protection sake, the coma will continue.  Of course, the edema may be released, and the patient may not exit the coma.
mH1Tnv5Naa	In general, colder air will have higher pressure due to the air being heavier and denser.  Warmer air, like that in equatorial regions, is typically less dense and thus the pressure is lower.  Again this is a generalization and there are exceptions to this.  Polar regions are cold because incoming sunlight strikes the surface at a relatively shallow angle, and a lot of the incoming radiation gets reflected by the ice and snow cover.  Equatorial areas are warmer because the sun is higher up in the sky and thus its rays are more direct, allowing for more energy to be absorbed over a given area.|`|hiuWWexnaa	When an area is said to be of high pressure it means that a lot of air is stuffed up in a small space and is of high density; in low pressure, a small amount of air occupies a large space and has a low density. High pressure is created by cold weather and high pressure by hot weather. The equator is exposed to the sun and so the weather is warm thus creating an area of low pressure.|`|LOxEDCnoaa	The book is right at the equator the pressure is low.  the pressure of the region is determined by the temperature of the surrounding. The hot region have low pressure as the density of air is low. Cold regions have denser pressure and hence will have high pressure.

0U6fSHGOaa	1. Because the ones in water developed it first, and then when evolution moved some of those plants and animals onto land, they had to overcome the less  access to water. And in order to reproduce they had to develop more complex systems to 'mimic' the water environment. That is why all land animals exchange body fluids in the process of reproduction. <br>  <br>  2. This often relates to the behaviour of the fish or their requirements to breed (water quality, seasonal triggers). <br>  For example; some fish (like livebearers) will readily breed under normal conditions. Others may require a large teritory, a certain ratio of males to females, specific water chemistry or food. Some species can be triggered to spawn in fish tanks by lowering the water level to simulate summer conditions whilst other may be prompted to spawn by adding some cooler water to the tank to simulate rainfall. <br>  <br>  3. Birds provide excellent parental care. Every egg that hatches can be expected to grow to adulthood. They have to sit on the nest to incubate the eggs and to feed their babies. Therefore they can not afford to lay too many eggs.<br>  <br>  The lower animals like fish produce thousands of eggs. They do not have to feed them and to protect them. Only two of the thousands are expected to grow to adulthood<br>  <br>  4.The salmon migrates from saltwater to freshwater to lay gees and comes back,while freshwater eels go to saltwater from freshwater to lay eggs<br>  <br>  5. Life Cycle of a Frog<br>  <br>  True Love?<br>  <br>  When Frogs mate, the male frog tends to clasp the female underneath in an embrace called amplexus. He literally climbs on her back, reaches his arms around her "waist", either just in front of the hind legs, just behind the front legs, or even around the head. Amplexus can last several days! Usually, it occurs in the water, though some species, like the bufos on the right mate on land or even in trees!<br>  (photo courtesy of Emile Vandecasteele)<br>  While in some cases, complicated courting behavior occurs before mating, many species of frogs are known for attempting to mate with anything that moves which isn't small enough to eat!<br>  <br>  Spawn (egg-mass)<br>  <br>  While in the amplexus position, the male frog fertilizes the eggs as they get are laid. Frogs tend to lay eggs single eggs in masses, whereas toads usually lay eggs in long chains. <br>  Some frogs leave after this point, but others stick around to watch over the little ones. Some have very unusual ways of caring for their young. You'll learn about some of those later in this tour!. <br>  <br>  Egg<br>  <br>  Frogs and Toads tend to lay many many eggs because there are many hazards between fertalization and full grown frogness! Those eggs that die tend to turn white or opaque. The lucky ones that actually manage to hatch still start out on a journey of many perils.<br>  Life starts right as the central yolk splits in two. It then divides into four, then eight, etc.- until it looks a bit like a rasberry inside a jello cup. Soon, the embryo starts to look more and more like a tadpole, getting longer and moving about in it's egg.<br>  Usually, about 6-21 days (average!) after being fertilized, the egg will hatch. Most eggs are found in calm or static waters, to prevent getting too rumbled about in infancy!<br>  Some frogs, like the Coast foam-nest treefrog, actually mate in treebranches overlooking static bonds and streams. Their egg masses form large cocoon-like foamy masses. The foam sometimes cakes dry in the sun, protecting the inside moisture. When the rain comes along, after developement of 7 to 9 days, the foam drips down, dropping tiny tadpoles into the river or pond below. <br>  Tadpole<br>  <br>  Shortly after hatching, the tadpole still feeds on the remaining yolk, which is actually in its gut! The tadpole at this point consists of poorly developed gills, a mouth, and a tail. It's really fragile at this point. They usually will stick themselves to floating weeds or grasses in the water using little sticky organs between its' mouth and belly area. Then, 7 to 10 days after the tadpole has hatched, it will begin to swim around and feed on algae.<br>  After about 4 weeks, the gills start getting grown over by skin, until they eventually disappear. The tadpoles get teeny tiny teeth which help them grate food turning it into soupy oxygenated particles. They have long coiled guts that help them digest as much nutrients from their meadger diets as possible.<br>  By the fourth week, tadpoles can actually be fairly social creatures. Some even interact and school like fish! <br>  Tadpole with legs<br>  <br>  After about 6 to 9 weeks, little tiny legs start to sprout. The head becomes more distinct and the body elongates. By now the diet may grow to include larger items like dead insects and even plants.<br>  The arms will begin to bulge where they will eventually pop out, elbow first.<br>  After about 9 weeks, the tadpole looks more like a teeny frog with a really long tail. It is now well on it's way to being almost fullgrown! <br>  Young Frog, or Froglet<br>  <br>  By 12 weeks, the tadpole has onl|`|0sffOgJWaa	sorry i am not learning about that right now.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=20090219162414AAnA6Ww&cp=12">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=2...</a><br>  please answer!<br>  we are looking for the best answer!|`|HxHvhZAsaa	^ agreed|`|vZoOtsI3aa	im not doing your homework|`|RTpDNIOUaa	maahhnnn bbbb.....get u some wurk ethic gurrrl|`|CxPO0Fj0aa	go onto google and search defintions of______(watever this science subject is__|`|I5SypMlsaa	try posting as separate questions or at least only two at a time you will get more responses

AA10854273	Monitoring Cell-Wide Protein Production with Ribosome <br>  <br>  Scientists have developed a powerful tool that can quickly tell them the identity and quantity of every protein produced by a living cell at any given time.<br>  <br>  With the new high-throughput technique, researchers can capture and quantify protein synthesis--effectively providing a new way to take a “protein census” of living cells. This advance may help scientists pinpoint which proteins drive specific diseases, and which of those proteins might be the best target for new drugs.<br>  <br>  <br>  “The ability to monitor precisely which proteins a cell makes should broadly inform many aspects of biology including developmental biology, learning and even aging.”<br>  Jonathan S. Weissman<br>  <br>  The research, which was led by Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator Jonathan S. Weissman and his colleagues at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), is reported in the February 12, 2009, Science Express.<br>  <br>  Microarray technology--one of the best known and most heavily used techniques to quantify protein production--is quick, thorough and has revolutionized biomedical research. But it focuses on molecular evidence that is one step shy of actual protein production. As a result, while microarrays are used to identify messenger RNA, the key molecule that is ready to participate in new protein production, they do not measure the payoff – the actual assembly of proteins.<br>  <br>  In contrast, Weissman’s new technology, called ribosome profiling, is more precise and reliable in identifying which proteins a cell produces in response to changing conditions. It also provides a way to measure how much of any given protein is produced.<br>  <br>  “We recognized that ribosome profiling could provide a powerful complement to microarray technology, taking the next step beyond identifying messenger RNA to measure actual protein synthesis – the ultimate payoff of gene expression,” said Weissman, who is a Howard Hughes Medical investigator at UCSF.<br>  <br>  It’s as if the microarray gives a snapshot of all the cars on the road, Weissman explains, but ribosome profiling can identify which cars are actually moving and even how fast they’re going. Ultimately, the “moving” proteins are the ones that matter, and they are the targets of drugs.<br>  <br>  “The ability to monitor precisely which proteins a cell makes should broadly inform many aspects of biology including developmental biology, learning and even aging. Ribosome profiling could ultimately also have important clinical applications. For example, knowing the spectrum of proteins a cancer cell is producing could give a detailed blueprint of its pathology, which in turn will inform the prognosis and treatment of the disease,” Weissman said.<br>  <br>  Ribosomes are molecular machines that bind to messenger RNA and translate the RNA message into protein. Ribosome profiling takes advantage of a recent revolution in gene sequencing technology, called deep sequencing. Weissman and his team decided to adapt this technology for their use because it is astoundingly fast and precise. In a single experiment, deep sequencing can identify 50-100 million RNA sequences--a 100-fold increase over the tools used widely in labs today. This power allowed the scientists to measure the assembly of each of the 4,500 different proteins produced in yeast cells.<br>  <br>  "Ribosome profiling is really a marriage of a classic observation about ribosomes with the rapid advances in sequencing,” said Nicholas Ingolia, lead author of the article and a postdoctoral fellow in Weissman’s lab.<br>  <br>  “The observation is that the 'footprint' of the ribosome on messenger RNA tells you exactly which part of which protein it's currently producing. The deep sequencing technology let us count tens of millions of ribosome footprints, and let us see every protein being made by the cell," Ingolia said.<br>  <br>  The researchers analyzed protein production in yeast cells because yeast’s simpler genome and well-characterized complement of proteins made it an excellent test case for ribosome profiling. The scientists don’t expect to run into any significant hurdles when they begin to use ribosome profiling on human cells.<br>  <br>  In the experiments reported in Science Express, the HHMI scientists compared protein synthesis in normal yeast and those that have been starved of amino acids, a form of stress. They showed that nearly one-third of all protein production is regulated at the level of translation--regulation that is invisible to microarray measurements.<br>  <br>  The key to ribosome profiling lies in capturing each messenger RNA molecule in its union with ribosomes. The RNA-ribosome unit is the site of protein synthesis. Ribosomes normally start near one end of the RNA sequence and move down the line, assembling amino acid chains according to instructions encoded in the sequence.

However, it does have a useful role to play in specific circumstances in at least three main areas: a it can provide precise diagnostic information about genetic diseases, allowing appropriate counselling, and indicating future directions for research on therapeutic intervention, e.g. gene therapy; b micro-organisms can be identified more sensitively and specifically, in fresh or fixed tissue samples, and their genomes can be analysed in fine detail, providing information relevant to the aetiology, epidemiology and pathogenesis of many diseases; c in tumour pathology the main application so far has been to resolve diagnostic problems associated with leukaemias and lymphomas, when other diagnostic procedures have been inconclusive. Specific chromosomal translocations, involving recognized genes, are particularly amenable to diagnosis by these means. Diagnostic applications to solid tumours are yet to be identified, although significant insights into tumorigenesis have been obtained, and these may ultimately lead to the development of useful markers for prognostic and therapeutic purposes.<br>  <br>  The introduction of recombinant DNA technology into the field of genetics has led to a rapid advancement of our knowledge of genes and genome structure. Such technology, applied to the human genome, has provided valuable information concerning the nature and possible treatment of inherited disorders. The possibility that this knowledge will pave the way for the correction of at least some of these disorders has captured the imagination of the informed public. In this review we look at the accomplishments of molecular pathologists to date and how new techniques are being applied to the study of inherited disease.<br>  <br>  <br>  see this also <br>  <a href="http://apbio.biosci.uga.edu/exam/Essays/html/standards/1986_dna.html" rel="nofollow">http://apbio.biosci.uga.edu/exam/Essays/...</a>

By allowing development to take place internally the mother is able to provide nutrition to the fetus for a longer period of time and in a more regular manner, rather than in an egg where the yolk is all the baby gets. What this has led to is extended and more complete development. For instance, in frogs, they young come out not full developed into frogs, they need to metamorphose to become fully mature. One reason for this is that the egg does not hold enough nutrients to supply the frog until it is fully developed, it must hatch early to feed and gain energy to grow. Mammals in the placenta can do this internally and emerge more fully developed. When mammals are born, they are simply smaller versions of adults rather than a completely different form than many fish, amphibians and invertebrates.|`|qENGaDWdaa	i can try to help with a and c!<br>  <br>  a. seeds allow some time to pass between the generations of plants. this means that the offspring are not limited by their parents' locations and can expand to new habitats by being carried long distances.<br>  <br>  c. diploidy is an essential part in darwinism. without diploidy, offspring would not be a combination of their parents and would have to be identical to the previous generation. natural selection depends on a variation of phenotypes to choose from. <br>  <br>  hope it helps!

There are a total of n terms, so adding them all up is n(n+9).

AA10306863	I won't do your homework for you but I will give you a headstart. The reproductive structures in angiosperms are the flowers. Bryophytes and mosses don't have those. They reproduce via spores. So that would be the pistil, the female part of the flowers; and the stamens, the male part of the flower. Inside the pistil you will have one or more carpels, so you also get an ovary, and in there ovules, or seeds. They allow pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds to unwittingly spread their pollen.

K79UmW7Uaa	haha omg i can't explain it, but I'm terrified of moths. <br>  <br>  If you don't want to hurt it, you can try shutting out the lights in your room (pitch black) and turning on a bright light in another room or outside. If the moth goes towards the light and out of your room, shut your door fast so it doesn't come back in.<br>  <br>  OR you could grab a drinking glass and a sturdy piece of paper (like a card or envelope) and wait til the moth lands on the wall. When it does, put your glass over it (like a cage) and slip the paper underneath the moth and glass to hold it inside the glass. You can then proceed to carry the moth inside the glass covered with paper, and take it outside. freeedom!!!|`|P9oduCUgaa	let your tounge loose & eat it!|`|T7SBu63Aaa	good question. <br>  get a kinda bright light to attract it and when its flying around the light, get something to trap it. a net, your hand, or whatever. hope you get that moth out soon!:)))|`|dc500182581d351f03c845444a3479f5aa	A man runs into a dentists office and says " Doctor you have to help me I think Im a moth"<br>  Dentists says " Im a dentist not a psychiatrist.

Gnfc4wRlaa	Polaris, being close to the north celestial pole, has little apparent movement.  Stars farther south in our sky move from east to west during the night.       "Polaris is very distant from Earth, and located in a position very near Earth's north celestial pole.    Earth rotates once a day on its axis, an imaginary line that passes through Earth from its north pole to its south pole. If that imaginary line  the axis  is projected into space above the north pole, it points to Earth's north celestial pole. As the Earth spins on its axis, it also spins around the north celestial pole. Polaris, located almost exactly at the north celestial pole, the center of spin, stays in the same place, while stars farther away from the north celestial pole can be seen to move in a wider circle around Polaris as viewed from Earth during its daily rotation.    Polaris actually lies just a short distance away from where Earth's axis points. Polaris is located about 1 degree off to the side of the north celestial pole, so Polaris does move a little, tracing a very small arc in the night sky, around which the other visible stars make wider circles."|`|AA10929465	If you're looking at Polaris, all the stars in any direction should be going in a circle counterclockwise.
AA10302154	The phrase "each group will be divided into boys and girls" is a bit odd.  Presumably, you don't mean that group A has all boys and group B has all girls, but rather, that each group has exactly N girls and N boys.    If that is what you are looking for, then the number of ways to divide up into two groups is 4N!/(2N!)(2N!)    The number of ways of choosing N girls and N boys is:       (2N!)^2/(N!)^4    So the probability is the second number divided by the first number, which yields:        (N!)^4/(4N!)    Stirling's formula say K! is approximately:       sqrt(2.pi.K)*(K/e)^K    So (N!)^4 ~ (2.pi.N)^2 * (N/e)^(4N)    And (4N!) ~ sqrt(2.pi.4N) * (4N/e)^(4N)    And p ~ (2.pi.N)^(3/2) * (1/4)^(4N)/2    You can write 1/4 as 2^(-2) and you get:         p ~ (2.pi.N)^(3/2) * 2^(-8N-1)|`|jRJBs4hxaa	There are 2N+2N= 4N people in all.  p = 4N! / 2N! 2N!

If you have units of P = atm, V = Liters; and T = Kelvin; then R = 0.0821.  So lets: convert:  328torr * (1atm/ 760torr) = 0.432atm  37C + 273 = 310K    Now substitute into the formula:  0.432atm * 5.4L = n * (0.0821 * 310K)  0.432atm * 5.4L = n * (25.451)  Divide both sides by 25.451:  (2.3328) / 25.451 = n    n = 0.092mol Cl2

4RJKl1aKaa	Ultimately I think the IAU have got it just about correct.  Yes, their definition is more subjective than they are prepared to acknowledge but a clear dividing line needed to be drawn, and it was drawn in a place that put Pluto on the the "non-planet" side of the line.    Personally I think most of this controversy has more to do with US national pride than anything else.  If Pluto is not a planet that means that they haven't discovered a planet.  Big deal - the same goes for most other countries in the world.  You don't hear anything like the same level of uproar from any other country over the redefinition.    National pride is not a good basis on which to make scientific evaluations and so we should steer clear of it.  If we start including Pluto in the planets then it is an untypical one on many respects.  If we have too many untypical members of a grouping then the grouping itself becomes an irrelevance.  So no, leave it as a non-planet.|`|cKzfxE0Zaa	I can't seem to care all that much how these objects are categorized. Why not just say Pluto or Jupiter, skip the intermediate labels, and give their mass, radius, composition, and distance from the sun?

The controversies over labels, such as the one concerning whether Pluto is a "planet" or not, is much fuss over little real importance. Scientists should know better than try to reify status.|`|Gnfc4wRlaa	At first I was against the reclassification of Pluto as a dwarf planet.  However, as I began to learn of the numerous similar bodies in the Kuiper Belt, I became reconciled to the fact that it is one of many and probably shouldn't be considered as a true planet.  We would have a large number of planets if we included all the Kuiper Belt objects similar to Pluto.  As someone else mentioned, many people have difficulty even remembering our (now) 8 planets.|`|ViZH5twNaa	Keep them as dwarf planets. Most American children (and many adults) can't even remember the eight let alone hundreds of them. If we let in one Pluto like planet we would have to let in the hundreds of nearly identical dwarf planets in too.    *edit*  They have all cleared their orbits of significant debris. Pluto has not thus it and neither has all of those other dwarf planets in highly elliptical orbits around the Sun.    A planet is "a celestial body that is (a) in orbit around the Sun, (b) has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape, and (c) has cleared the neighborhood around its orbit."    That is from wikipedia.|`|TzogAxLFaa	Talking sematically, I think that Pluto is still a planet by definition.  I mean, a dwarf star is still a star; so a dwarf planet must still be a planet.    The problem is that a planet is defined as "Anything we say is a planet."  In a generation or so, the official number will probably change again.|`|5fcM3HLsaa	I honestly like them all!

a4edf2e40162015de63a4dff47980bbbaa	You have to first draw a Lewis structure for the ion. The Lewis structure will tell you how many things (bonds or pairs of non-bonding electrons) will surround the central atom. From that, you can determine the geometry of the molecule or ion.    To determine whether is it polar or nonpolar, you need to consider two things:    1. Are the covalent bonds polar? (compare the electronegativities of the bound atoms)  2. Are the bonds arranged completely symmetrically around the central atom. Since this ion has 2 covalent bonds and multiple pairs of non-bonding electrons, it will be polar.
30e9927658a61352d780b8717406445daa	As ever, the BBC and David Attenborough are excellent, and deserve praise for putting this out at a time when fundamentalist / creationist propaganda is on the rise.    I say excellent, but the programme was not, sadly without its faults.  The concept of evlution being a "tree" is fundamentally wrong for anyone who has any knowledge of the subject.  Sadly this error even extends to the programme title, and was perpetuated in the dialogue on many occasions.      The image of a "tree of life" is entrenched within popular culture and textbooks, but is highly innacurate. It is enhanced by popular diagrams of smooth evolutionary progress, e.g. horses, humans, and it implies a smooth passage of ever more complex life forms, from simple early forms right up to mankind at the top of the tree (which sends a sort of pseudo-biblical message of mankind dominating all other life forms?!?).    In reality, the progress of evloution, as established from the fossil record, is never smooth, but is jumpy (or punctuated).  Furthermore, some of the most diverse, bizarre and complex life forms ever known existed over 500 million years ago back at the late Pre Cambrian.    In reality, evolution would be better seen as a complex and ever-changing web, perhaps a tangled shrubbery rather than an elegant tree!|`|7i6qj4OXaa	I thought it was very interesting.

AsKWImpQaa	For simplicity, I'd start with 1 square meter of air, then you know the energy of the heating, 5 x 10^6 Joules.  Now figure out what mass of air is in that volume between 1000 and 500 hPa that's 1 square meter. I don't think that's too hard since you know the pressure difference between the layers, you should be able to figure out the mass that's causing it.    After you have the mass, you can calculate the temperature change by using the energy, mass, and specific heat for air.    Then if you have the temperature change the hypsometric equation will give you the thickness change.

YHNK9UrQaa	The Paramecium's body is covered with cilia that resemble little hairs.  These cilia are also located in the oral groove of the Paramecium.  The beating of the cilia helps the Paramecium move.  If the Paramecium bumps into some food (e.g., bacteria yeast or algae), the beating of the cilia drives the food and some water down the oral groove into the gullet. Once the food gets to the bottom of the gullet, the membrane at the bottom of the gullet pinches off, forming a food vacuole inside the Paramecium (called pinocytosis).  The vacuole travels around inside the Paramecium.  At first, the contents of the food vacuole are alkaline.  As the food vacuole is digested by enzymes from lysosomes, the contents of the vacuole gets smaller and more acidic.  Eventually, the food leaves the body of the Paramecium through the anal pore.    The nutrition from the food vacuole is used to power all the funtions of the Paramecium cell.      See a good, first year biology text book to learn what the organelles inside the Paramecium do, incuding protein synthesis.      Contractile vacuole functions to control water contents of the Paramecium.      And, learn about cell diviision or reproduction by binary fission.

MZbxHhOsaa	All elements (and molecules) have a specific and unique absorbtion line pattern. <br>  This is because the "orbits" of the electron can only take on discrete values based on plancks constant, you can not have an orbit of say 1/2. however, an electron can jump from it's first orbit to it's 10th, or from it's 7th down to it's 2nd and vice versa. Since each level has a different energy associeted to it, the electron will have to gain or realease a photon equal to that amount inorder to move to the other orbit. <br>  The patters are ussually based on elements states, nuetral hydrogen in it's ground state would have only the absorbtion lines fro it's electron jumping to higher orbits from it's lowest state 1. so nuetral hydrogen would have the lines 1 -> 2, 1->3, 1 ->4 etc. <br>  <br>  If you however increase the temp of Hydrogen enough, you could have a gas where the electron will be in the 2nd orbit to begin with, and then you will see the lines 2 -> 3, 2 ->4, 2 -> 5 etc.

In addition, precipitation accumulates on the salt ice as well. So the northern polar cap is made up of a combination fresh water ice and briny ice.<br>  <br>  The south pole is on land, but the surrounding waters are cold enough so that the above applies. On land glaciers at the South pole are all fresh water glaciers built up over millennium by precipitation|`|HyAFA5Jpaa	Yes and no - the water which freezes into ice leaves the salt behind,however if you were to sample the ice, it would likely have salt contamination due to spray.  When ocean water freezes, the remaining water has much higher salt content (brine) which is denser - this density difference is a major source of pumping power between the polar seas and middle latitude seas - the briny water heads down and south (or north in antarctic regions) and the surface water heads north (or south) from the equatorial areas as evaporation leaves brinier water to sink due to density differences...|`|WbVE1cXKaa	typically, if formed under equilibrium conditions, the ice is essentially pure and free of salt.  Salt gets concentrated slightly in the water as the pure water turns to ice.  The presence of salt will inhibit the forming of the ice solid so only salt reduced ice forms.<br>  <br>  Of course, if you take a volume of salt water and freeze the entire volume, the salt will be in that ice.  It is only because that doesn't even come close to happening that the ice is so low in salt content.  <br>  <br>  Sea spray, as mentioned above, freezes in totality so the salt in the spray adds to the ice mass (can't get put anywhere else, no liquid fraction to migrate away with the salt).<br>  <br>  Plus, a significant portion of polar ice is from atmospheric precipitation that is also low in salt.<br>  <br>  So, yes, in general, polar ice is low in salt, much lower than the saltiness of the seawater from which it forms.
Nc0TObZOaa	The shape and bounds of the universe are impossible to know for certain for anyone living inside the universe with our current technology, but it is either flat, spherical, or hyperbolic (saddle-shaped). The universe is also either open (infinite) or closed (finite), but since the universe, either way is BILLIONS of light-years across, it is likely we will never find out. If the universe spherical, it doesn't have an end, but it doesn't have a beginning either, much like a sphere. If it is flat, it is open, so it is infinite.

9Wi2eNInaa	It's what beet of doom says. You need to shield your weld or it won't have any strength. If your shield gas runs out while you are welding you notice it immediately .Once the air hits the melted puddled steel you get a lot of air bubbles that mix into the weld and it looks like a porous lava mass instead of a weld<br>  <br>  Usually MIG welders or TIG have shield gases. Right where the wire comes out of your welding handle the gas comes out of the little metal cup surrounding your torch handle where the wire exits for the weld. Without that shield gas it is impossible to get a weld|`|XU1aTqQ8aa	If you heat a metal such as steel to the temperatures required for welding, it will oxidize and burn in air. Shielding a metal means covering it in an inert gas such as carbon dioxide or argon to prevent oxidation.<br>  <br>  Edit: Arc welders often use a coating such as a mixture of ammonium chloride and sodium borate on the welding rod that creates inert gases to shield the weld as it burns.
XU1aTqQ8aa	Stainless steel contains many added metals such as manganese, vanadium, chromium, and others. In carbon steel, the main alloying material is carbon.

DhLIo8nbaa	Yes it is definately deadly, the combination of xanax and alcohol is very deadly and when you add opiates on to that you are playing with fire.  It does not matter what the doses are when you are messing around with this many drugs then you are playing with your life, even in small doses these medications when mixed can kill you.  That is why when you read on the bottles of the xanax and the oxy's and the vicodin they say not to mix with alcohol, there is a big red label on the bottle warning you, so please dont risk your life by doing this.  I am an addictions counselor and I work in a rehab.  I have had many clients and friends die from combinations like this and some of them were at low dosages, but when you mix xanax which is a depressant, and oxycontin and vicodan which are both downers used to supress pain, they all slow down the respiratory system and eventually can cause you to sop breathing, add alcohol with that which also is a depressant you are trippling your chances at dying.  If this is something you are thinking about trying, or you know someone who is and you need someone to talk to or if you have anymore questions please feel free to e mail me and I would be happy to talk to you.

4b63df522adcbbe3effabc36048eabe4aa	Well, for starters, people are going to say the more you smoke or the less you smoke depends on how long it stays in your system. This is incorrect, websites are false at times, while others aren't. I see a chick above already used a website for her knowledge, but her knowledge as well as the websites, is false.<br>  <br>  Marijuana contains THC, which is what gets you high, which is whats inhaled, which is what builds in your system, which is what fails you on the drug-test. THC stores in the fatty-glands of your body, therefore the skinnier you are and the faster your metabolism is the quicker the THC cleanses itself from your blood-stream. Also take into consideration the amount of liquids you drink, preferably Cranberry and H20.<br>  <br>  It doesn't matter if you've smoked once in your life or all your life, all it takes is one hit and the THC can be in your system for up to 30 days, no longer, but certainly less. In your case, you appear to have drank a lot of liquids you claim, you worked out a bit, and your skinny meaning your metabolism is probably working to it's fullest. The chances of you passing the test are probably 85% if not higher. I would not recommend that you consume large amounts of liquids before the test, in other words, do not try the old trick "Drink a gallon of water before the test..." because there is a such thing as being to clean. Which not many people know as well, if you are to clean, then that will get you flagged and fail you as well.<br>  <br>  It will show up on the test that you did not have any illegal or prescribed substances in your system which is a good thing for your family and employer, although you still get flagged, therefore your family may suspect you cheated and your employer, whether he/she believes you or not, will be forced to terminate your chances of employment. I believe you will be clean, you have been for 3 weeks, so I wouldn't worry about it to much.<br>  <br>  Although, take into consideration, I am very skinny, weighing 155-160lbs, 6'ft, and have a very fast metabolism, I failed the test after smoking only once in a single month, even though I had been clean 3 weeks. So there is that chance you will end up like me, good news is, I took a home test, not a job test...|`|BwJOeHDEaa	well, im not going to preah to you and say what you did was dumb..weve all been there and have done idiotic things, but your best bet would to just be drink alot of water (probably twice as much as you are now) and hope that it will test inconclusive so that youll have a few days befoe you get it back to get your system cleaned out..ive heard that you can excercise to 'sweat it out' kind of, but im not so sure how that works..from what i know i guess the thc molecules bond to fat cells so its either going to burn off faster bc your burning off the fat..or its going to be released into your system and give a stronger concentration of thc in your urine..<br>  or..you can just go to your local stoner head shop and buy a masking agent for around $20-$50 ive never used them so im not sure how well they work or if they do at all,<br>  if it makes you feel any better, you have up to 24 hours after an interview to take the drug test...<br>  but you should be ok...just keep driking the water and take a multivitamin to make you urine not so clear..|`|wUAvNcDnaa	It is very possible (especially if you smoked weed regularly) that would will show up on a drugs test - with heavy users it can take 6 months. You're best bet is to find someone to give you their urine (put it in a water balloon, put it down your trousers and peirce when it's time to pee). Don't drink too much water before the test because that class very diluted urine as positive.<br>  <br>  @ Malia - you are advising him to take unsafe amounts of water that could lead to water intoxication.

XU1aTqQ8aa	I believe metals are conductive because they have one or two valence electrons, which can be easily knocked off.

Frogs are aquatic, and their entire life is a "water phase."<br>  <br>  Anyway, moving past that and concentrating on the aquatic environment,<br>  <br>  Abiotic factors:<br>  sunlight intensity - must have enough to grow fiamentous algae for tadpoles to eat, but not too much UV<br>  temperature - must be in the right range for living things<br>  water depth - yup, tadpoles live in the shallows, where the filamentous algae grows<br>  water current flow - can't be too strong, or it'd just sweep away the tadpoles<br>  dissolved oxygen in the water - there must be enough for the tadpoles to absorb enough to live and be active<br>  pH of the water - must be just right, not too acid, not too alkaline<br>  dissolved salts in the water - mustn't have too much<br>  dissolved minerals in the water -  mustn't have too much<br>  substrate (rock, gravel, silt, sand) - different frogs prefer different materials at the bottom of the water where they lay their eggs, and the substrate must be good for the vegetation on which the tadpoles feed<br>  presence of metal toxins (e.g. mercury) in the water - not too much of these, tadpoles don't grow and develop right in the presence of too much<br>  presence of other inorganic or non-biologically produced substances in the water (including things like sulfur, petroleum) - not too much of these<br>  <br>  Biotic factors:<br>  Presence of filamentous algae and other appropriate vegetation - food for tadpoles.  Yum.<br>  Presence of an appropriate amount and variety of predators - predators can include water bugs, crayfish, fish, birds, frogs, turtles, snakes, alligators, otters, minks, raccoons.  There have to be some, to keep the population of tadpoles low enough so that it doesn't overgraze its food supply.  But there can't be too many, or too many of the tadpoles will be eaten and not enough will grow up to be frogs to reproduce.<br>  Presence of appropriate bacteria and fungi - these guys break down wastes in the aquatic environment, which "detoxifies" them<br>  Absence of inappropriate fungi and bacteria.  Some of these pollute the water with toxins, or are diseases for frogs and tadpoles.  A diseased tadpole may not grow and develop right, resulting in death or sometimes a deformed frog adult.<br>  Nearby presence of the kinds of insects, isopods, and other small animals an adult frog would eat.  Without those, there won't be adult frogs in this area, which would mean no eggs and therefore no tadpoles.
