20080321125425AAE4eDy	Social Science;Sociology	Riuscirà internet a cambiare il modello di benessere che diamo per scontato?	ci trasciniamo l'idea della ricerca spasmodica del benessere dell' avere e del produrre che ci toglie il tempo 'vissuto' per sostituirlo con quello 'lavorato', 'produttivo'   questa idea, che detta così cruda può sembrare estranea, ci è inculcata dal modello culturale precostituito in cui siamo immersi e la diamo per scontata.   In realtà altre culture basano il loro ritmo di vita non sulla ricerca dell' avere ma sul vivere il tempo .   In un intervista che vidi qualche tempo fa un amazzzone diceva: 'io sono spaventato per il mio futuro, l'uomo bianco sta arrivando nelle nostre foreste, per l' uomo bianco tutto ha un prezzo, per noi tutto è qui, è disponibile, vuoi mangiare? mangi, ci sono frutti, pesci; vuoi dormire dormi, sei benvenuto nelle nostre capanne'   Internet ci mette in comunicazione con culture lontanissime e diversissime...credete che questo porterà a un ridimensionamento della nostra visione del mondo? questo contatto globale, tra alcuni decenni, cambierà la società?

20090222224224AAdHjPY	Social Science;Psychology	Why do I feel like I am connected to so many ppl on different levels It's just something I feel?	for example I feel  connected to them in a way. I remember one time I was buying some sypmtahy cards from this store and this lady clerk shared with me how her daughter have been acting and she went in great depth with me. I gave her some advice but she felt so comfortable like nothing.        for ex.    I can be out with ppl I know, I can strike up a conversation with ppl I dont know, where's the person I'm with would ask me do I know them. Im thinking I dont have to know them to talk to them, that's how you get to know ppl. I have always been friendly and feel what ever going to happen happens.        If we really can prevent something we wouldn't have accident. for example maybe if they would of had on their seat belts? if they did, and a truck was coming at them side ways do you STILL think the seatbelts would of done any good.       I believe the light is to be followed and EVERYTHING HAPPEN FOR A REASON.      I feel like Im related to the universe and very trustworthy and trust others.

20090223020338AAKKkC7	Social Science;Sociology	Who do you think really has more control the giver or the receiver?	as a giver....im beginning to realize the power that goes along with the role. instead of allowing someone else to conrtol MY happiness or pleasure, i'd rather be the one to decide what im going to give them and when. sitting back, waiting and hoping that i'll get what i want makes me feel so much weaker because i know i can't control what that person will do. so by giving at my own discretion i feel more in control. if paired with a receiver it becomes a very healthy symbiotic relationship, if paired with another giver, we have power struggles. i thought this was interesting. so what do you guys feel on this issue? agree disagree? why?
20090223000233AAc1mQM	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Do people have to define their beliefs by what other people say they are?	Is a Masculinist someone who supports human rights of men or is it someone who belongs to the female-hating anti-woman groups who spew filth and venom, advocating rape and death for women? CAN YOU CALL YOURSELF A MASCULINIST WITHOUT BELIEVING THAT WOMEN SHOULD BE DESTROYED?       If you answer yes, of course, then please ask yourself if you are also one of those people who make up your own definition of what a "Feminist" is with no respect for those who are actually the feminists, who all have varying viewpoints like normal humans.

But I have researched into the treatment of Victorian women and I ended up in tears.

20081103143629AAq1CNp	Social Science;Psychology	How to deal with anxiety issues?	Every Monday i have dance practice. I'm 14 and i've been taking dance since first grade with the same group of girls. For the past few weeks, none of the other girls have shown up and it's left me with me and my teacher. My teacher's a bit harsh and has mood swings. She's also very critical. So lately i've been having these bad anxiety things where i really don't wanna go and i've just been freaking out about it in general. I think the reason is because she criticizes everything and gets frusterated when i do things wrong.     Does anyone know how to stop these? or at least make them less severe?   thanks so much. its greatly appreciated

"I think that these are largely taught limitations and ignorances, this kind of thing. It's really sad in a way, because it's a demonstration of such cowardice, emotional cowardice, to be so afraid of extending the same rights to your fellow man as you'd want for yourself."

Research shows that our Prefrontal Cortex, the brain's "control center" which makes decisions, long term planning, and logical judgement, is still developing.       So I am asking: what is the emotional aspect of procrastination?      I happen to be a teen, and I know about the guilt and all, but I'm still wondering why we procrastinate?      THIS time around, I PLANNED poorly! However im 17 and im worried my prefrontal cortex might be handicapped in the future. Im tired of procrastinating, both mentally and emotionally, but everyting I make plans they FAIL! I realize they must be ideals and therefore only ideas sigh*

I developed anorexia, etc...and I notice that although I am almost in my late 20s, I have never been in a formal relationship, despite offers, etc...      Now, I wonder, is it Society's fault that tells me I am ugly and fat and stupid, although I do think of myself as skinny, and desirable and intelligent....      Or is it MY FAULT for buying into Anorexia, and fads and low self esteem, despite truly thinking that?      I see my beautiful counterpart who also has Anorexia, yet she still has friends, countless boyfriends that I could even see myself with, etc...living her life.      What makes her life different than mine other than she is mixed? We are both still attractive...is it because maybe she lives in a town that seems more open to her than where I live too??

20090223022145AAxZJTD	Social Science;Psychology	Depressed/Anxious, too afraid to seek help. Are there other ways to deal with it?	I went to a psychiatrist for four sessions. I really didn't like it. I'm really shy, to the point that it's pretty bad. I don't have many friends. I sleep a lot and can't seem to motivate myself to get a job, or do volunteer work (i need to do volunteer work for a scholarship i need). I've never felt more lonely, unattractive and unlikeable. I think everyone thinks I'm gross. I don't know why and I can't explain it, but i just want to be accepted so badly. People aren't mean to me, but I just feel like i can't hold their interests., like I just bore people. I sometimes do to, and I make conversations awkward. I've been smoking a lot of marijuana for almost a year. I still get good grades in school, but I'm just really depressed. I would never commit suicide, but I do wish for death sometimes. Honestly, death scares me, but I really feel lost in life. I don't really feel like I have any tools to reach out to others with. I don't know how to connect with other people. The people I like never like me back, and the people that like me are weirdos (I'm judgmental of others  too).       I don't really know what I should do to meet other people, and actually relate to them. I've never been that person that has a lot of people close to her and that call or tell me their secrets. I am part of the problem with making people feel distant. I won't hug my best friend when I see her, but all my other friends hug so when she gets to me we just high five. I don't know why the thought of really close physical contact with others is both something I want and something i fear really badly. It's like the worst catch-22.       I have class tomorrow, so hopefully you respond to this soon because I should be trying to sleep.      Sorry for whining. In real life I don't do this- I'm just layin' it all out there because it's the internet. I promise I keep this stuff to myself in the real world. Truly, everyone thinks I'm happy.

20090223021818AAZ3yx5	Social Science;Other - Social Science	Why do stubborn people try to force their belief system on others about the word 'ma'am'?	Even when people don't want to be called this they still behave unrelenting.    It's the same as trying to force everyone to drink alchohol and if they don't they say the SAME things regarding if you decline to be called the M word , for example, they say " I think your reading too much into it" and (you don't deserve the right to disagree,) and  "it is polite to drink alcohol. "    It is some people's beleif that the word ma'am is no longer polite because it is mostly used for people who are very old, and it is supposed to be for people who are older than the person who is using the word on the other person, and it is also stricly for married women with a ring on their hand or a mother with chldren present. You would not address someone by their ethnicity, or anything else so why would you address them by their gender. People who use this word are usually convinced that they MUST call you something, you don't need to call anyone anything they will still be able to understand you are speaking to them, or if they must they could just say excuse me.
