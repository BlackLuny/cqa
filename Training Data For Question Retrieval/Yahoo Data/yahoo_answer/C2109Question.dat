20090306225613AAwYFPA	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Answers	Does anyone else think that Yahoo Answers has been providing bad answers?	By 'bad answers' I mean answers that don't really answer the question (like if you ask about the best brand of bread or something, the answer will be like, "I like bread! It's good!") lots of spam and links to other people's questions in the "answer" or answers like "i dunno lol y u askk?" Maybe my questions are too specific or something, but the last 10 questions I've posted over the past couple weeks ended up with no best answer. Even when I browse through other people's questions, I see the same not-really-answers posted.      So is it just me noticing the lack of good answers? Where did the detailed/thoughtful answers go? Or at least, the ones that attempt to answer the question!
