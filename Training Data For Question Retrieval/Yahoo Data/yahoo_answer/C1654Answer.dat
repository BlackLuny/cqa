i0XLU6eIaa	Hola amiga...BIENVENIDA...<br>  <br>  Te invito a MARACAIBO tierra amada<br>  es un paraíso terrenal...jajajjajjjjj mi ciudad!<br>  <br>  MERIDA,tiene unos paisajes bellos...<br>  <br>  lA GRAN SABANA y el SALTO áNGEL,es lo máximo el paisaje mas hermoso del mundo...<br>  <br>  PUERTO LA CRUZ y MARGARITA,si deseas mar estas son  las mas bellas...<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mipunto.com/venezuelavirtual/000/002/008.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mipunto.com/venezuelavirtual/...</a>|`|CPCbIQtAaa	Amigo, depende de tus gustos y preferencias. Venezuela es un país hermosísimo con una variedad climática increíble que va desde zonas desérticas hasta selvas amazónicas, playas preciosas y ciudades muy modernas.<br>  Si te gusta el clima frío, no hay nada como Mérida, sus picos nevados, el telesférico, y una heladería (Coromoto) que está inscripta en el Libro de Record Guinnes por la variedad de sabores (más de 700)<br>  Si buscas un clima agradable y contacto con la naturaleza, en Trujillo no dejes de visitar Boconó.<br>  Para las playas, Islas Margarita son un ensue?o y como grandes ciudades te sugiero Valencia, Barquisimeto o la propia capital (Caracas)<br>  El resto viene solo: bellas mujeres que te alegraran la vista y una comida típica excelente para el paladar más exigente.<br>  Suerte y buen viaje......|`|dxUYj820aa	Visita MArgarita........ te divertiras mucho|`|nwdMFBMiaa	merida o margarita|`|4lFL3jbBaa	Hola Angel,<br>  <br>  ?Para que ciudad?. Sube a un avion y ve a Los Roques. Sol, mar y playa para descansar despues de negocios.<br>  Pero si insistes, depende de lo que gustes. Si quieres playas, las mejores son las orientales, puedes volar hasta Cumana y tienes el Hotel Los Bordones y el Cumanagoto ademas de otros en la Playa San Luis, sin excursiones muy lejanas ni arriesgarte mucho.<br>  Quieres selva y rios, vuela hasta Puerto Ordaz, en la Guayana venezolana, te recomiendo el Hotel Intercontinental (5), el Rasil (4), el Tepuy (3), los dos ultimos mas centricos, pero no salgas a caminar de noche, es peligroso en casi todo el pais. Si vas a cenar fuera, sube a un taxi del hotel o pide que te llamen uno desde el Check-in, ellos saben a quienes llamar. Visita el Parque la Llovizna, Plaza del Agua, Parque Cachamay y mira la posibilidad de pasar unos dias en La Gran Sabana, al sur del pais. Salen excursiones desde esa ciudad.<br>  Si te gusta el frio y la monta?a, vuela a Merida. Ahi no conozco mucho, pero la gente es amable y viven del turismo, te pueden indicar muchas alternativas de paseo.<br>  <br>  Que la pases bien. Saludos.|`|Ia6cUZW6aa	Margarita y Merida..!<br>  Son muy bonitos..!|`|LYGAwrKhaa	hola!!<br>  <br>  pues te recomiendo:<br>  caracas (es la capital, es muy bonita)<br>   pero sin duda te recomiendo barcelona<br>  <br>  es la mejor ciudad que puedes conocer en venezuela, de hecho tiene unos edificios muy lindosz!<br>  <br>  visitala! y que te vaya bien en tu viaje!|`|OrN8srDWaa	Vivo en Caracas, pero te aconsejo que vayas a Merida, es la ciudad mas bella de Venezuela, los Cayos de Morrocoy y  Los roques , te vas a relajar muchisimo, Canaima y La Gran Sabana muy bello.<br>  Que tengas  un buen viaje|`|VHGmx48faa	Ve a merida no te arrepentiras es muy lindo por alla muy diferente a otras partes del pais.|`|XlNyrenDaa	De Caracas a la isla de margarita, luego a Pto la cruz, Maturín, Pto Ordaz, Maracibo y Merida suerte|`|nbRaeFPBaa	Mira aqui te estan mandando a meterte en monte con Jeeps y a los Roques que es en bote....Mejor vente para Barcelona o Pto la Cruz como quieras llamarle,osea el estado Anzoategui, si tu viaje es de negocios.

Aqui hay playas, es una ciudad bien linda, hay malls a la orilla del mar y esta bueno para pasar un fin de semana.|`|xWPHZrjIaa	vivo en caracas, y aquí sinceramente no hay nada que ver además es muy peligrosa, en el interior del país hay ciudades muy bonitas, maracay, pto la cruz, margarita, mérida, etc, lamentablemente todas muy descuidadas y hostiles pero con cuidado se pueden visitar y disfrutar...|`|1mIoABHeaa	Amazonas,Canaima es perfecto|`|Vv6qumE8aa	Margarita, merida, amazonas (canaima), SI te buscas excelestes playas aparte de la de margarita estan los cayos de de Coro son buenooooosssss, aragua (cuyagua, cata), etc.... en si todas las ciudades son excelentes... Aki encontraras lo q buscas!|`|XDQNUbTaaa	Hola!! depende que prefieras turisticamente,  tenemos selvas y te recomiendo Amazonas, esta El Salto Angel que es la cascada mas alta del mundo y es un sitio magico, esta Los Roques, que un archipielago hermoso con exelentes paisajes marinos, Merida, que es una ciudad hermosa y la gente es muy amable pertenece a los Andes venezolanos, Los Medanos de Coro, que es un peque?o desierto al occidente del pais, y por supuesto Caracas, es una ciudad vertiginosa, agitada, con una movida gastronomica sobresaliente en America Latina, te envio links <a href="http://www.valentinaquintero.com.ve/index.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.valentinaquintero.com.ve/inde...</a> esta es una guia turistica venezolana exelenten para saber de posadas y sitios en Venezuela para visitar, por otra parte te envio otra guia en Caracas <a href="http://www.chacao.gov.ve/guia.asp?ID=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.chacao.gov.ve/guia.asp?ID=1</a> esta es una de las mejores zonas para la gastronomia en Caracas... espero que te sirva esta informacion|`|c0XQ49Mcaa	Hola! te aconsejo Merida si te gusta el frío es una ciudad muy linda y los meride?os son personas muy hospitalarias; si te gusta la playa puedes ir al Parque Nacional Morrocoy o a Los Roques, un full day en los Roques cuesta como 700 $ es caro pero es lo mas bello y paradisiaco que te puedes imaginar, si te gusta la selva la Gran Sabana, la Gran Sabana es un lujo que pocos se pueden dar pero si tienes oportunidad ve es una experiencia única en la vida, también puedes ir a la Isla de Margarita, el turismo para la Isla esta muy bien desarrollada, también contamos con otras playas en el Oriente muy buenas. Los Llanos venezolanos también son muy bonitos, pero desconosco de su desarrollo en turismo. Te recomiendo como caraque?a no te quedes mucho tiempo en la capital, es peligroso y feo. Bueno espero haberte sido útil. Que estés bien. Feliz Viaje!|`|pdiwd7Kraa	merida xel pico bolivar, la gran sabana x el santo angel, o margarita xsus beias plaias|`|ycyNPJoKaa	Siempre pienso que la capital de un pais, por algo lo es. Caracas es una mezcla del pasado y logicamente del presente; si quieres conocer realmente las raices de Venezuela debes conocer Caracas.|`|6fb550117e5669e2b43ded94a7c57a37aa	Ya te recomendaron la Isla de Margarita, también puedes visitar si tienes tiempo todas las playas del Estado Falcon son preciosas, Morrocoy, Tucacas, etc. También están los Médanos de Coro, kilometros de árena donde te sentirás relajada.<br>  <br>  Existe también la cueva del guácharo en Canaima y sitios preciosos puedes visitar el SALTO DE AGUA MáS GRANDE el SALTO ANGEL, ver sus hermosas cataratas de agua, los tepuyes, etc, en fin tienes muchos sitios lindos donde ir y sentirte a gusto. Si te agrada el frío también puedes visitar el Estado Mérida y ahi montarte en el teleférico más grande del mundo...y verás al Pico Bolívar.<br>  <br>  Besos...Alisha|`|RNuPRshOaa	Las ciudades en Venezuela no son muy turísticas, a excepción de Mérida. El verdadero atractivo de Venezuela radica en su naturaleza y dependiendo de lo que te guste hay muchas opciones:<br>  <br>  Playas:1) Los Roques es un paraíso para relajarse por un par de días, 2) Choroni es un pueblito simpático con unas playas preciosas, selva tropical nublada y el mejor cacao del mundo y 3) La Península de Paria tiene unas playas vírgenes preciosas en un ambiente rustico y tranquilo, se puede combinar con visitas a haciendas de cacao y excursiones para ver pozas y aves.<br>  <br>  Selva: Canaima tiene la caída de agua mas alta del mundo pero no creo que sea una buena época porque el río quizás esté muy bajo para hacer las excursiones. No he ido al Río Caura pero según entiendo es precioso, tampoco sé si sea una buena época para ir. <br>  <br>  Llanos: este es el mejor momento para ir porque la fauna se concentra en la poca agua que queda y es fácil ver todo tipo de aves.<br>  <br>  Monta?as: el páramo en Merida tiene los mejores paisajes pero no sé si estará funcionando el teleferico. Si vas, visita la Heladería Coromoto con sus sabores de helados originales como: aguacate, cebolla, etc.

lPxVt2XYaa	Stansted Express train to Tottenham Hale, then Victoria Line tube all the way to Brixton|`|4A3oOnm9aa	There are coaches going from Stansted to basically anywhere in the country so when you get off the plane just ask where to go, I don't plan before when I go out and I still get there in good time.|`|yd3ANXMlaa	I use National Express to get from Stansted to Victoria.   Victoria to Brixton by Underground is very easy.  <br>  <br>  The site is down for another 2 hours so can't check on how long it takes.  I think about an hour.  Then to Brixton probably another 20-30 minutes including waiting for train etc.<br>  <br>  Have a look at National Express UK website a bit later or tomorrow.<br>  <br>  If money is not an issue you can get a minicab - cheaper then a black cab.  Airport Cars are very good and reliable - have used them many times.  You have to pay in advance by card.  0044 (0)207 249 9999|`|nx4NBQEyaa	just try mapquest.com and choose directions at the top.

4MvhbSDUaa	probably not ... but it all depends on how bad the hurricane was. New Yorkers are not going to roll over for bad weather, terrorist attacks, bad economy, etc... we kinda just keep bouncing back regardless... the people make the city, not the buildings...|`|MmTe8W8uaa	Not completely, but it could do some damage.|`|2bca07912249cffd6d15a663fd5ae28caa	it may flood low lying areas and destroy buildings that are not well built, but any brick buildings with steel frames on higher elevations should survive just fine...|`|556e2b3b8dbb30ecb9e019a58a4e86e6aa	I don't think that it could destroy it, but it could do millions of dollars worth of damage. I live in an area that was just hit by a hurricane and while it left many homeless, the majority of the big buildings were still standing. While New York City is mostly made up of large buildings they would probably have lots of flooding on the lower levels and some windows blown out by strong winds, but there is little worry that it would completely level the entire city. |`|4iAMrHd1aa	A hurricane can damage a city, but not "destroy it".<br>  <br>  Even New Orleans was not damaged by the hurricane as much as flood water (because they are so incredibly stupid that they live BELOW sea level - what a retarded place to build a city!!!!)...<br>  <br>  |`|1FPpglMpaa	as other have said, destroy no, damage yes.  we are in a hurricane zone but the hurricanes in our part of the atlantic just don't have the same power as the ones in the gulf coast or the pacific.    |`|3MYZWJpHaa	yh if it was big enoth <br>  <br>  i need a poo lol <br>  |`|7gwSuu7Paa	It really matters on the size of the Hurricane. New York is actually due for a major Hurricane. Can the Hurricane "destroy" NYC? I don't think that's possible unless it's the biggest Hurricane ever made by nature. It will definitely cause damage and big waves. I can see flooding being a MAJOR problem since NYC is a harbor and is situated right on the water. Damage will be intense but the city will still be there.|`|JU4KufMLaa	Only if "hurricane" is code for "godzilla".|`|htkNaW7Eaa	Maaaayyyyybbbbeeeeee.|`|SwTgUf89aa	yeah prpobbb if it was bad enough.. but it wont happen|`|zE8KtH63aa	pants|`|640EEFlCaa	ummm like duh of course it can...

HMThJPZZaa	consulta la pagina de la Secretaria de Relaciones Exteriores ahi encontrarás los requisitos para obtener tu pasaporte, solo que como eres menor de edad no lo puedes hacer tu, tienen que ir contigo tus padres, los dos y te lo entregan el mismo dia. Para ir a Estados Unidos esta mas dificil, porque tienes que obtener la visa, para checar los papeles necesarios consulta la pagina de la embajada de los EU, pero tambien lo tienen que tramitar tus padres, con tu pasaporte tienes que llamar a la embajada para hacer una cita, dependiendo de la epoca en que hagas el tramite sera largo o corto el tiempo de espera (esto es a veces te dan la cita para el mes siguiente pero en una ocasion para renovar mi visa me dieron la cita cuatro meses despues de la llamada) asi que toma tus providencias. Tampoco la puedes obtener tu por ser menor de edad, tienes que hacer el tramite en compa?ia de tus padres. El mismo dia te dicen si te la autorizan, pero te la mandan por correo y te llega dos o tres semanas despues.|`|PskYoEazaa	Primero, necesitas el permiso expreso de tus padres o tutores.  Para el pasaporte ellos deben de firmar la solicitud de pasaporte, autorizándote a salir sin ellos.  Los pasaportes a esa edad los dan hasta los 18 a?os (al menos a los varones).<br>  Y para la visa, te piden que vayan tus padres contigo y que ellos presenten información sobre su situación económica y  laboral.|`|6fb550117e5669e2b43ded94a7c57a37aa	Pero no dices de que pais eres?...si eres Venezolano, entra en internet en ONIDEX ahí podrás sacar tu cita para el pasaporte y el trámite es rápido solo te piden tu cedula de identidad y pagar 43 bolivares...solo eso.

La situacion en Alberta esta muy relacionada a la industria petrolera, y eso puede causar que fluctue en el futuro, pero por ahora, parece que tienen mas trabajo que gente. Ontario siempre ha sido la provincia mas fuerte, al igual que Quebec, y Ontario es mas multi-cultural que Alberta, asi que eso puede ser importante para tu decision.

Please remember that it takes always two to make things right or wrong.|`|Xjekjqmqaa	O.k, i am a Muslim, so i might be able to tell you more about that kind of issue. <br>  <br>  In Islam, firstly, you are not actually supposed to make a boy-girlfriend relationship because these are the stepping stones to having sex, abortion, family problem etc etc...so he commited procreation and basically crossed the red line. <br>  <br>  Also, in islam, you are not allowed to have an abortion. When you have the baby, even when you are raped. It is a duty to raise this baby into a good Muslim. Although many women say that abortion should be right, in Islam, keeping the baby may make your life better rather than worse, and you should handle the consequences. <br>  <br>  If, you have not formed the bump yet, and his family doesn't know. If he is clever enough, he can engage and marry you and try and make his family accept. But will his family accept so easily? Usually, Muslim families prefer Muslim girls, because she is more likely to bring a family of a Muslim faith. If they accept you, this means they trust you this much, to bring the baby as a good Muslim, of good culture, of good discipline and education. He can marry you. Because in Islam, when the boy has sex, before or after, and he dumps the girl or divorces, he can never marry a pure girl again, he has to marry an unpure. So, he should marry you, especially because this baby should be born into a family whether he wants to continue being a good Muslim. And, its the best for both of you if you love him. In islam also, if two people love, the best thing is marriage. Because marriage in Islam is the importance of the relationship, having a boyfriend or girlfriend is not as important, so you can be dumped easily...there are no rules or anything to follow. But this actually increases the rate of single mothers and council life. <br>  <br>  But because you didn't even engage, many Muslim guys tend to run away. Because when you commit procreation, the punishment is death. But, however, the death punishment would be wiped out, so he wouldn't be punished for procreation in hell, in Islam's perspective. So all the men tend to run away. Is the stories i heard. <br>  <br>  But remember, some families are more laidback or lenient, they quickly organise the wedding. Maybe they may not mind, but their families and friends would. So they organise as quick as possible in order for both of you to live your life, have a baby, and married in a halal way in Islam. <br>  <br>  Best of luck though, its hard to go through this....|`|h5NP5HEwaa	So many things wrong with your relationship with the guy . <br>  First it's against Islam to have a girlfriends, COMPLETELY forbidden for him to have sex with any woman unless they're married.<br>  Second Abortion is considered as killing an innocent soul and is illegal. <br>  Third there is no way that a statistic exist about Muslim guys running away.<br>  Fourth Islam prefers that he marries that he marries a Muslim girls then if not a Christian girl.<br>  Sorry but if you're Jewish or an atheist you have a huge problem then. If his parents find out you will probably have to get married.|`|Ad5DlqfPaa	First of all if he is Muslim he should not have been sleeping with you in the first place without marriage.. Second if you are not Muslim and he comes from a Muslim family and especially an Arab Muslim family chances are very very slim that his family will accept you. And even if you do "convert" or agree to it, he probably wont marry you anyway because honestly they like to play around with the non-Muslim girls because they know that they cant sleep around with Muslim women,  but when it comes time to build a family and to marry, they look to their own people.

lqXmvJdRaa	If you are thinking of living in New York I would suggest that you have one thing. Money. LOTS of it.|`|g8LLIeXKaa	Living Alone in New York State<br>  <a href="http://411newyork.org/guide/2008/12/01/living-alone-in-new-york/" rel="nofollow">http://411newyork.org/guide/2008/12/01/l...</a><br>  <br>  Your current age disqualify you in signing a rental lease since you are a minor. Your mother (since she is okay with it) would have to sign (as a main or cosigner) your rental/lease agreement for you.<br>  <br>  You will then need to check the city/town in NY you plan to stay for their current law.<br>  <br>  By the way, if your mother is paying a mortage, you may want to stay home and help put that money towards the mortage instead of making some landlord here richer.|`|Y5j2Cr14aa	I think you need to be imanicipated to be able to do so since a lease is a legal contract and you need to be 18.
xiB1BPwsaa	You don't need an H1-B if you are a Canadian citizen.  Because of NAFTA you only need a TN. There are a limited number of H1-B issued every year, there is no limit on the TN. To obtain a TN you only have to have a job offer from a company in the US.|`|1d718ff96585004e8d1e8bc312c3655daa	Sure, why not?  You need a visa, like every other non-resident, but they're less difficult to obtain from Canada than from most other countries.  For a work visa (H-1B) you need a job first - that's a little tougher now, but you can certainly try it.  If you have a job or can find one in Canada that has an American office or store in the city, that would be your best bet - you can just request a transfer.<br>  <br>  Another option would be a student visa (F-1) - this option, I think, is better.  Student visas are much easier to obtain, you simply need to be accepted to a college or university in New York (Lord knows there's enough of them - look into the CUNY schools, they're the cheapest), prove to them that you have enough money for the year to survive in the States, and come on down :)  You may even be eligible to authorize yourself to work part time while on studying, or you could work off the books (God, I'll bet I'll be hearing a load of crap from other answerers - most of whom aren't even New Yorkers - for even suggesting that) at a restaurant or something for some extra income.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

H9WbaFeNaa	I've lived in the suburbs of LA, SD, and LV.  There are pros and cons to each of the cities.<br>  <br>  LA- high crime rate, VERY expensive, crazy traffic, navigating is hard if you're new to the area.  There is a culture that is fun about LA, but I wouldn't move back.<br>  <br>  LV- high crime rate, affordable housing, there is traffic - but definitely not what LA has.  I wouldn't live in Las Vegas, but Henderson, since it's more like living in a real city rather than the touristy area of Vegas.  Oh that reminds me, the area off of the strip in Vegas is not that safe, so unless you're moving to Summerlin or SE Vegas, just move to Henderson.  We had a 2br, 2bath apartment with full amenities (washer/dryer, AC, gym, pools) for about 925 a month.  <br>  <br>  Oh, and the part about the heat - it's really not that bad.  You go from your air conditioned house to your air conditioned car and then to your air conditioned destination.  <br>  <br>  There are TONS of jobs out there, as long as you speak English (which it seems like you can) or you can pass a drug test.<br>  <br>  SD-that's where I am now.  The weather is absolutely beautiful.  If you like sports, I'd go with here, because you can easily go to a Padres or Chargers game.  You can even easily go to Mexico for the day or weekend.|`|szR4LPebaa	Phoenix and vegas are way tooo hot in the summer<br>  phoenix has nothing out there<br>  <br>  i live in LA and its its okay but tooooo much traffic and the city isn't fun to drive in at all<br>  <br>  San Diego is where i would move<br>  the beaches are gorgeous, and since your young the party scene is everywhere. there is football and baseball down there. and it has balboa park which is really pretty<br>  and downtown san diego is a fun place to go at night,|`|URO3gDXcaa	so how do you figure phoenix and vegas are west coast?  neither states are on the coast.  forget la.  go to san diego.  much better place.|`|tQM0ufHoaa	You also may want to consider the San Francisco Oakland Bay Area,<br>  Housing is expensive but so is Los Angeles and San Diego. Its extremely diverse has a fantastic night life and we have the 49ers, Raiders, Giants, A's , Golden state Warriors basket ball and San Jose Sharks hockey.Its 3 or 4 hours drive to the snow and Reno casino's, Yosemite park and Monterrey Bay. the bay area counties are:<br>  <br>  Alameda County<br>  <br>  Contra Costa County<br>  <br>  Marin County <br>  <br>  Napa County <br>  <br>  San Francisco County <br>  <br>  San Mateo County <br>  <br>  Santa Clara County <br>  <br>  Solano County <br>  <br>  Sonoma County|`|1kvFda0Aaa	Both L.A. and San Diego are VERY expensive places to live, but San Diego is a very nice place to live, so unless you can stay with your aunt, I wouldn't recommend southern California.  Las Vegas is pretty slow for the job market right now, so I wouldn't recommend going there.  Phoenix is somewhat of a boom town and it is pretty cheap to live there. <br>  <br>  To Summarize it, my #1 pick would be San Diego if you can stay with family, and #2 pick would be Phoenix.|`|Aa5FIxLxaa	san diego why. la is about 1hr awayand you'll sit in traffic before and after work watching poeple drive in the $100,000 BMWs cutting you off! hahahahha LAs not the place for me but i love the shopping and all the crazy people. mexico is 20mins away, not a good time to visti bc of the drugs wars. vegas is 4 hrs away, i cant say anything bad about vegas but there housing is going up and theres no jobs. san diego has year long weather about 70. rent in the nice part of town would be around 1,500 month. also the zoo, wild Animal park, sea world, balboa park and exc.. hope you fine what you are looking for ! good luck|`|urHPuzMsaa	I wouldn't choose any of them. You should look into Atlanta for a fast growing city even in this economy. Nothing happening out west here. You should also brush up on your grammatical skills before you go job hunting. Looking at the way you presented your question would have me wondering. Just some friendly advice.|`|dFBccLExaa	I've lived in Phx. It's hard there. The commute is murder, so you'd better be prepared to shell out a lot of money for gas. Plus, the housing is only so-so. Many people from LA move to Phx, so the jobs are almost always going to them. Really really hard to find work. The main newspapers here are Arizona Republic, and the East Valley Tribune. However, there are TONS of smaller newspapers. You could also look into Tucson, which is a smaller city about and hour and a half south of Phx. They have quite a few newspapers as well. <br>  LA is exp. And it's hard to get work that pays worth a damn. <br>  I know nothing about San Diego. <br>  Las Vegas is where I am now, and I love it here. Times are a little tough, but there is still work to be had. Also, housing has gone down, if you're wanting a house. Apt's here can be expensive, if you want to live in a good part of town. The major newspaper here is the Las Vegas Review Journal. You can also get on at local free newspapers, like the Las Vegas Weekly. <br>  Personally, I'd pick LV. <br>  Hope it helps.
0fW76gB8aa	I was on a tour that involved walking through the Muslim quarter. For that part of the tour we had to have two armed guards accompany our group. There were quite a few Arabs staring at us. <br>  <br>  Personally I didn't feel very safe and wouldn't go back there without security.

You can walk the perimeter, take a river cruise, see feedings, and also check out attractions with lots of other animals and educational exhibits. Tons of fun for the family.

R2MsEyDOaa	Happy?  That might be a stretch. How about mildly interested.<br>  Had he come up with some that was very easily usable, very accessible and gave promise of lessening the stuff sent to the land fill, that would have been more interesting. As Steve N has pointed out, what he has come up with comes complete with it's own set of new problems for the police. For a temporary roof, it is still over shadowed by the plain old cardboard box which is easily found, no tools required, no assembly needed, gives a bit of warmth and protection from the elements and is easily discarded. That dome does not look like a quick shelter to me - looks pretty time consuming actually.<br>  <br>  But there is nothing wrong with thinking of a new idea and then setting about to see if it is workable. Some ideas, like the light bulb, turn out to be well worth the time and effort as well as the trials and errors involved. So I applaud him on his effort which absolutely beats sitting playing games on  a gameboy all day or frying his brains with drugs like so many seem to want to do.|`|AA12095483	I'm not sure most Canadians have even heard the story. It isn't really pertinent to the Canadian scene, or what is happening with homeless in Canada.|`|2wyDALHgaa	I don't think anyones citizenship matters with a question like this but since you asked, as a Canadian, I don't really care.  Good for the kid and his science fair experiment though.  Hope he enjoys his trip to Boston.|`|P9S5wlLyaa	No. I think he's a stuck-up little rich kid who has clearly never lacked for anything, and he is deluded if he thinks that is a practical solution to homelessness. They are supposed to: what? Glance in the first trash can they see and find a whole ton of wire and packing peanuts? And then have a party for all the homeless people to get together and build some yurts?<br>  <br>  Is this before of after the rape and heroin use?<br>  <br>  He won more money for that than I make in a year. That's ridiculous.|`|XVxH0FFAaa	No|`|65fef61f322f25075280c35b20f9c4f8aa	At least he is thinking about things and trying to help, although I would not exactly call it practical.<br>  <br>  To make his dome, he needed to use a lot of wire that you had to bend into shape, lots of plastic bags when many stores are going to recyclable totes, loads of styrofoam peanuts that may or may not be available in large quantities, and access to a heat sealer to melt the plastic onto the wire shapes. <br>  <br>  This is not exactly something that a homeless person can make as a "quick shelter" in an emergency. And government would not appreciate it if charities started giving out these domes to homeless people. Cities are trying to fight vagrancy by giving them heated shelters to go to. The ones who usually refuse those shelters are the ones that do not like the rules (no drinking, no durgs, etc) that they would have to abide by.<br>  <br>  So imagine you suddenly have 50-100 little geodesic domes going up in Central Park each night, and the cops can't see what's going on inside or what to expect. Or is a pedofile or rapist using one of the domes to commit his crimes while in plain sight, and yet hidden ? If you hear moaning or cursing from under one of those domes as you are passing, would you lift it up to see what is going on?<br>  <br>  No I much prefer more practical ideas. Such as recycling old jeans. <br>  <br>  Take shredded blue jeans, treat them with boric acid, and create batt insulation out of them. The jeans are basically all natural cotton, and boric acid is used to clean cuts and as an eye wash in hospitals. The boric acid makes the material fire-retardant, repels insects, and is extremely mold/mildew resistant.<br>  <a href="http://www.bondedlogic.com/ultratouch-cotton.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.bondedlogic.com/ultratouch-co...</a><br>  <br>  But hey, Kudos to the kid. I wonder if he gives the $10,000 to a homeless shelter if he wants to help so much? How does it affect Canadians? Not much. Are we happy about what he did? I'd say more indifferent.|`|D9zgZvpoaa	These shelters are not quick. They ake a lot of time and special tools to make. I think it is a great idea for recycling the trash but not very practical for a homeless person to whip up or someone caught in a storm.|`|WWlUrwJxaa	Lol the canadians probably made jokes bout this kid,<br>  wouldnt doubt it 4 a sec.

Average is 20C<br>  <br>   July tends to be the rainier month.

The weather there is cooler.  Usually very pleasant.|`|8OREBeRdaa	Okay, muffet1 may not be entirely correct. Snow in June in Calgary is a little on the rare side (I do admit that it may happen). It will be pretty warm in Calgary - I think you be there in time for the Calgary Stampede!|`|FJyLVazVaa	It will be just beautiful there.  The weather runs pretty much the same as our northern states.  So between 70 in June, and 80's to low 90's in August.
kjB4jLcxaa	Lets looks at the big picture.<br>  <br>  Are they supporting your housing?  If so, you will at least have to pay the utilities, phone bill, internet, and food.  For a one room, which is usually provided, your looking at<br>  <br>  Utilities- $50-100 a month<br>  Internet- $30 a month<br>  Food- $250 a month, at least<br>  Phone bill- $20-50 a month, calling back to America, $30 at least<br>  <br>  If they are not supporting your housing and you will live alone.  You obviously know it's not possible when making $1300 a month.  <br>  <br>  If you are living with someone, which is what I'm assuming...transportation is cheap.  Get a subway train card, and use it around the city.  Seoul, Daegu, Daejeon, Gwangju, and Busan have subway systems.  Taxis are getting more expensive, but if your only going a short distance it's affordable.  When you travel, I recommend using KTX, or the Mu gung hwa train.  KTX is expensive, but gets you there quicker.  Mu gung hwa is dirt cheap, but comfortable.  If you are going to Jeju, or Busan from Seoul (visa versa) you can use Asiana Air or Korean Air.  It's around $200 round trip.  <br>  <br>  I love bartering.  That's all I do nowadays.  I realize that most things here, clothing, electronics, car audio etc are overpriced in independent shops.  The trick is, if they are offering something for $50, take your sweet time and then say, "ok, $35 in cash, final offer."  Franchise store however will not barter.  Or go to those stores late, like around 5 minutes before they close.  Look around, and you might get something cheaper.  They realize your the last customer of the day, and they'd rather have more money than no money.  <br>  <br>  (I just put a $3500 Alpine system in my car last month, from a shop in Seoul.  I bartered everything down to the deck harness.  Got the system for $2,579.  You know places in America never barter.  Just a prime example)|`|LnpBSpjSaa	Everything is not so cheap  in Korea.  Depends where you go.  In smaller cities, Taxis are relatively cheap.  Big cities take longer to arrive so are more expensive.<br>  <br>  In general stores bartering is pretty impossible.<br>  <br>  However, outdoor markets like Namdaemun it's quite common.  I wouldn't assume everything is cheap, but not that bad.  Food can be quite reasonable.  Like 3 bucks or 3000 won can buy you a decent meal.

If your country should be listed on the UK visa list you will need a visa to visit the United Kingdom.

Also, keep your dog away from them.<br>  <br>  The answer below has no concept of how dangerous some creatures are in Spain. There is a brightly coloured green spider which if it bites you, you will need immediate hospital treatment. There is a large orange centipede. If that bites you, then the same will apply. Though in the mountains, they have a poisonous snake called an asp. That was what killed Cleopatra. <br>  On trees on the campo you can see funny web like things full of lavae. When they burst hundreds of caterpillars come out. They walk in single file over the campo. These are nasty creatures which will hurt you if they bite you or your dog.|`|v2eAwuYkaa	As far as I know, unless you are allergic, you won't be in danger. There aren't mortal animals in Spain.

The ESTA is only required for air and sea travel.<br>  <br>  At the border you will have to get a Form I-94W (fee: $6.00) and fill it out. This will be your visa waiver which grants Irish citizen to stay up to 90 days on the discretion of the Immigration Officer.<br>  <br>  <br>  Source(s):<br>  <a href="http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/travel/id_visa/esta/esta_question/02122009.xml" rel="nofollow">http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/travel/id_vis...</a><br>  <a href="http://travel.state.gov/visa/temp/without/without_1990.html#vwpfee" rel="nofollow">http://travel.state.gov/visa/temp/withou...</a>|`|AA12095483	Take your passport with you and you shouldn't have any problems.

My husband (not Canadian) had the fingerprint and eye scan thing done for the first time, a few weeks ago.  Freaky, isn't it?  (I didn't have to have it done, since I'm Canadian.)<br>  <br>  You're going to the U.S. first, then back to Canada.  <br>  <br>  Well, you need look at this link, to see if you need a visa to cross into the U.S. (being an Irish citizen): <a href="http://travel.state.gov/visa/temp/without/without_1990.html" rel="nofollow">http://travel.state.gov/visa/temp/withou...</a>  (...and I'm pretty sure you need to purchase a visa waiver when you drive across the border, like my husband has to - see below)<br>  <br>  On your way back, you do not need a visa to drive across the border from the U.S. to Canada (as you indicated in your itinerary overview), but you do need your passport.  (Only American & Canadian citizens can travel between Canada and the U.S. without a passport, and only if they arrive via land or sea, and only until June 1st of this year, when the rules change.) <br>  <br>  At the border, they will ask your citizenship, at which point the driver will be handing them the passports of anyone in the vehicle who requires them to cross the border.  (Any Canadian or American citizens in the vehicle who choose to cross the border with other forms of i.d. - prior to June 1st - will hand those over at the same time.)<br>  <br>  They may ask any number of questions, but the usual are about the length of your stay, where you'll be staying, the purpose of your visit, possibly what you do back in Ireland.  They may ask you to show "proof of funds" so they feel confident you have enough money to support yourself during your stay.  They may ask about any food, alcohol, or tobacco you might be bringing into the country, and if you are bringing anything you plan to leave behind.<br>  <br>  It's pretty much the same process for entering the U.S. as it is for entering Canada...except I think you'll need a visa waiver to enter the U.S., but not to return to Canada.<br>  <br>  If you're not trying to do anything unsavoury, then I wouldn't anticipate any problems.  They may ask you all of those questions (and more) or they may ask only one or two, or none, past the citizenship question.  A lot depends on the guard, and your behaviour.<br>  <br>  You should also know that any criminal conviction can prohibit entry to both Canada and the U.S.  That goes for you and your travelling companions.  They don't generally ask about past convictions, unless they suspect something is not quite right.  If they want to do additional screening, they'll instruct you to pull the car into a parking area, and go into the office, where an agent will question you further.  EDIT: Actually, you'll likely have to go into the office, to purchase your visa waiver.<br>  <br>  Again, if you're not doing anything wrong, even that process is usually pretty painless.  So don't worry.<br>  <br>  My husband is from a country that must have a visa to enter the U.S.  While we don't drive across the border very often, when we do, we always have to go inside, and answer the other questions, and purchase a visa waiver for him.  It's rare for it to take longer than about 15 minutes, but it's something you might have to do on your to the U.S.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

kif21UOdaa	$11,000 for 6 months equates to about $60 per day. One night in a backpackers hostel will set you back anywhere between $16 and $35 per night depending on its location, facilities and choice of room. That leaves roughly $30 per day to pay for food, transport, entertainment and other personal expenses. That's not much when you consider the cost of our living here. On top of that you would need to pay to travel from one city/town to another.

I just read the town is very small and it seems not many streets have pavement, it might be boring...I'd bring a book.<br>  In the state capital, also named Oaxaca you can visit the cathedral, the central square, the market and specially Montealban beautiful ruins.<br>  Typical food is mole which can be heavy on your stomach as it is a mix of chili peppers, cocoa, corn and spices; but I'd buy a pepto and give it a try.<br>  Famous drink Mezcal, wich is similar to tequila but stronger and usually has a worm inside the bottle :o)<br>  The beach at Puerto escondido is nice, though a little isolated as there are many bays not connected to each other, is 8 hours away from Oaxaca by bus, through the mountains. Great sunsets.<br>  If you are flying through Mexico city and leave the airport or the gates, be careful with your personal belongings, look secure and you'll be fine, for the trip do not wear shorts and sandals which would show you are tourist, dress nicely.<br>  Hope you enjoy your trip.|`|AA10042296	I think you'll fall in love with Oaxaca like I did on my first trip there in 1976.

It looks like Rio Grande is not quite a beach town on the road toward Acapulco not too far from Puerto Escondido. <br>  <br>  You will need to speak at least some Spanish. If you don't already speak Spanish, learn as much as you can and get a little pocket dictionary or phrase book. People are really really nice if you try to talk to them and will try to help as long as you try.

The first answer may be talking about mole sauce which is wonderful but does require a somewhat sophisticated palate.|`|tBzz9dPYaa	I have many years ago.  Oaxaca City the capital is beautiful.

OTnSwNwZaa	It'll be hard to get a host family if you're Black. I'm very sorry to burst your bubble sister, but life isn't fair towards Black People. We are stigmatized and hated worldwide, especially in asia. It's not worth wasting your time on asians, especially japanese. I believe in racial separation. Why should we try to coexist with those that will always hate us?|`|fo5VHocxaa	Hey, You really should go with the host family option. This would save you a cr￡p load of money ( you wont pay for food,accomadation,internet,etc). If you really REALLY dont like it , then i would suggest you go back to the dorm. They cant force you to live with the host family , so if it doesnt work out , you have the dorm option.|`|KwUfhcmwaa	Hi, I have experienced staying with a host family (not in Japan). It is true that some families are super nice and some are just horrible. If you'd like to give a try again. You should! You'll never know until you try. If you don't like the family you stay, is it possible to move out to a dorm? You will feel safer with a host family (or someone who knows about Japan more than you probably) in the beginning. Then you can consider other options!
uCi1LPAzaa	I just took my son to get his first one about a month ago and we had his passport back within 2 weeks.

You get one by going to your local post office and asking for a passport application. THen you will have to fill it out and mail it in with some passport pictures that you can get made at most Post Offices or just about ANY photo center of any store (wal mart, CVS, etc...)<br>  <br>  Good luck man - my advice is to get started ASAP!!! atleast get the application and the pics made, that will get you that much closer to having a passport <br>  <br>  <br>  also......

It is on Eurosport too which gives the best coverage because it shows the support races too.

1d718ff96585004e8d1e8bc312c3655daa	How is Queens far from the subway - you got the R, W, V, N, M, G, F and E that go throughout Queens (and those are just what I pulled off the top of my head).  The F, R, N and V all go from Queens, through Manhattan and all the way down to Brooklyn.  If you lived in New York, you should know that ....<br>  <br>  I'm making this point because Queens College is a better, cheaper, more convenient college.  It has a good legal studies, political science, philosophy, history or whatever other social sciences-based program you would like to enroll in.  You're not going to racking up thousands of dollars in loans, and you're going to get a quality education, even if it is a state school.  My best friend graduated from Queens and is attending a pretty good law school up in Boston called Harvard :)  I am currently a graduate student at Brooklyn College, also in the CUNY system, and am preparing to apply to for my PhD at CUNY Graduate Center.  Brooklyn is also another option for a school - you said you have family in Brooklyn and Jersey, why don't you look into that, as well?  I personally find Brooklyn College to be a teensy better in the social sciences than Queens, but I didn't get my undergrad in the CUNY system, so I'm not entirely familiar with it.<br>  <br>  Anyways, good luck!|`|b3fcaed1380d38d593a8cb71556b4d96aa	You can live in Manhattan and go to Queens College, of course--but you could live more cheaply in Queens and visit Manhattan whenever you liked with no problem.  <br>  I admit Queens College is not the easiest place to get to via public transportation, but it is a very good school.  I got my MLS there.  I live on Long Island, so I just commuted by car--it was the only practical thing to do.   I think my only other option was the Long Island Rail Road and then two buses.<br>  Edit:  Eura, good points, and I was going to suggest Brooklyn College.  I think their law school is slightly better than Queens.|`|gJ8F634Haa	I live in Queens and my daughter attends Queens College.  So out of convenience she goes there.  I am also a few blocks away from the LIRR which makes it easy for her to go into Manhattan.  In your case, I would definitely go to Pace.  Have fun and good luck.

An expert panel of judges assessed the entries using guidelines which included history, heraldry, distinctiveness, utility and cost of manufacture.<br>  <br>   The Prime Minister of Australia, Sir Edmund Barton, announced that five entrants, who had submitted similar designs, were to share the honour of being declared the designers of Australia’s own flag. They were: Ivor Evans, a fourteen-year-old schoolboy from Melbourne; Leslie John Hawkins, a teenager apprenticed to a Sydney optician; Egbert John Nuttall, a Melbourne architect; Annie Dorrington, an artist from Perth; and William Stevens, a ship’s officer from Auckland, New Zealand. The Commonwealth Government and the Review of Reviews for Australasia provided ?75 each and the Havelock Tobacco Company added ?50 to this making a total of ?200 prize money, a considerable amount at the time. The five winners received ?40 each. <br>  <br>  The Australian National Flag features the five stars of the constellation of the Southern Cross and the Commonwealth Star, and the combined crosses of St George, St Andrew and St Patrick. The union of crosses represents Australia’s early settlers. The Commonwealth Star with its seven points represents the unity of the six Australian states and the seventh point stands for all Australian Territories. Under the Flags Act of 1953, passed unanimously by parliament, it was confirmed that our "Stars and Crosses" design be the chief national symbol by law, custom and tradition and that it be honoured with the title "Australian National Flag".<br>  <br>  Each of the symbols on the flag has a special meaning for Australians. The stars of the Southern Cross represent our geographic position in the Southern Hemisphere; the Commonwealth star stands for our federation of States and Territories; the Crosses represent the principles on which our nation is based, namely, parliamentary democracy, rule of law and freedom of speech.|`|NyJeK6NSaa	Flying the Australian Flag is a way of exhibiting pride in our nation and respect for our heritage. The Australian Flag was born with the creation of Federation at the dawn of the 20th Century. <br>  In 1951 King George VI approved a recommendation by the Government that the Commonwealth Blue Ensign be adopted as the Australian Flag.

Jm3vMKx3aa	Hi G Man,<br>  <br>  two days ago you have told that you hold a UK passport that is invalid and was issued at the age of 12.<br>  In this case you do not have to follow the procedures for the first adult passport.<br>  Just apply for the renewal of your passport, pay the expedition fee of ￡25 and you will get in within a week's time.<br>  <br>  Enjoy your travel!<br>  <br>  <br>  Source(s):<br>  <a href="http://www.ips.gov.uk/passport/fees.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.ips.gov.uk/passport/fees.asp</a>|`|RaV7SidDaa	um well if you knew you were leaving the country and you knew you needed a passport then why did you wait for the last minute? Also with all the new security checks it will take all that time to make sure you are not a terrorist or someone who hates the stupid governement... wait you do hate the govt...PASSORT DENIED|`|aqLLbzJQaa	I am sorry to hear of your frustration - but it does say a number of times on the UK passport agency website that you cannot use a fast track service for a first adult passport - it is not a secret - it is because additional checks are required to make sure you are who you say you are and that you are entitled to hold a passport. First time adult passports can take up to 6 weeks - renewal of an existing passport can be done in 3 weeks but at busy times may take longer.<br>  <br>  I am sorry but the frustration is your fault - when you booked the holiday and noted that you needed a passport you should have applied straight a way.  I also think your dislike of the Governmaent is a bit harsh - passports are a necessary evil , not just for use in the UK but to ensure your entry into many (most) countries around the world and your passport has to meet certain international standards to be accepted in all countries.<br>  <br>  Like you I am English born and bred but we do have to accept that that does not mean anything in some countries in the world and just have to accept the fact that passports are necessary.<br>  <br>  ..|`|28611f26541407fc1c1b05bfe2b1bc03aa	They tell you worst case!<br>  I got mine within 2 weeks!<br>  GOOD LUCK!!!|`|wqZbkYpMaa	you should have checked into it earlier|`|zD2LhQJbaa	no
Mxr6AIkiaa	A. Advance airline seat reservations and boarding passes in no way protect against or do anything about delays.<br>  <br>  B. What protection do you need or want in case of upgrade?<br>  <br>  C. Advance airline seat reservations and boarding passes offer no more protection against someone taking your seat than do boarding passes issued at the airport.<br>  <br>  D. Advance airline seat reservations and boarding passes have no bearing on cancellation.|`|1bTYCUDkaa	None of the above.  The seat assignment is used to identify an individual in an incident or accident.  If they perish, the NTSB or other researching crash team knows who sat in which seat.  This is also used to identify the person if they are still strapped into their seat.|`|ulxe0jPZaa	E.  It is easier to identify your remains after crashing into a corn field or a river, whichever is closest, and also helps to match you up with the note you hurriedly scribbled on the barf bag you found in the seat pouch in front of you on the way down.

She does not have to pay anyone anything to go get on the plane and leave. If she is being hassled, she should go to the American embassy for help.

5ZtSR0IQaa	The top credit card brands are Visa, Mastercard, and JCB. American Express and Diners Club are also popular.<br>  <br>  Common places that don't take credit cards would be diners and eateries, kiosks and boutiques, commuter train ticket machines and buses, 99 yen and 100 yen shops, and convenience stores and supermarkets. So most places that a backpacker may rely out are cash outlets. On the other hand, all the places that an expense account corporate traveler would use are fine with credit cards: hotels, restaurants, department stores.|`|DoYQeqGhaa	Japan doesnt use cards. They are a CASH BASED SOCIETY! iF YOU WERE GOING TO TAKE TRAVELERS CHEQUES OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT, DONT BOTHER!|`|KwUfhcmwaa	You can pretty much use all kinds of cards in Japan. VISA, Master, American Express are accepted in many places. These ones are used by many Japanese people too. Japanese credit company, JCB is also popular but its use is almost limited only in Japan. If you're going to Tokyo Disneyland, careful! I think they took only JCB (their partnership company) when I went there.

tV7ZYIeEaa	from the marketplace bus stop to west side it should not take you more than 15 mins to walk. At night may be longer more people.

They've been programmed from childhood that you marry a man and have lots of children--this is changing very slowly.<br>  Salma Hayek's mother was Mexican, but her father was Lebanese.

hRnEf90Naa	Hmm.. Mate, to me both are very important and inter-dependent... happiness you try to find in small things or events in life.. when accumulated, they result in contentment.<br>  <br>  Now the difference.. one can be happy because your best mate did well in the exam or he got engaged to the love of his life but that happiness wont be enough to give you contentment... <br>  <br>  Contentment comes after a allot of effort and time... its like accepting the way things are in your present and be happy about it... a rich man might not be contended but allot less richer might be... its the way you look at life and your achievements...|`|XaVU965Jaa	I don't know if I know what's more important but I can tell you that you can be happy but not quite content with things or situations, which is my case.

UkaBy2Hyaa	Definitely.  The reality is that the biggest worry of most students today is the lack of parking spaces at their college.<br>  <br>  If the government (or powers that be) really care about improving the life chances of the disadvantaged then they should take the millions they pump into 3rd level fees and redirect it to early years and pre-school education, when it will (and has been proven) make a difference in increasing access to Higher Edition.<br>  <br>  <br>  The Car park issue in virtually every college in this country shows how hard up students really are.  If it was up to me I’d bring back the bursary system, subsidise degree courses which will keep graduates in this country and tie loan repayments to performance (as they do in Norway) so that does who put the work in will get a % of their fees knocked off their student loans or fees.<br>  <br>  Our Unis are, for the most part the refuge of the middle and upper classes and that’s with free fees.   The system needs to change because it doesn't widen access to HE it benefits the middle class.<br>  <br>  ____________________________<br>  Edit:<br>  <br>  JK:  If Graduates get graduate employment they will earn significantly more than non graduates in their life time. (Certainly enough to cover the cost of going to Uni and then some).<br>  <br>  Also graduates are not the only ones who'll be picking up the tab of our aging economy, non graduates work and contribute just as much of their wages which also go to pay for student's 'education.'<br>  <br>  ________________________________<br>  Edit 2:<br>  <br>  Crazy Girl:  In the UK student loans are linked to earnings menaing that Student's are only asked to pay back their debt when they are earning enough to afford it.  A similar system could be introduced.  <br>  <br>  There are some people here in the North who'd love to be earning 20k per year for their first five years, graduates included.<br>  <br>  _________________________________<br>  Edit 3:<br>  <br>  Crazygirl.  But that's the point graduates should believe they are entitled to better paid jobs because of their degrees.  <br>  <br>  Degrees do make it easier to (1) get a job and (2) earn more money  so why not make those who get the chance to go to university contribute to their own education instead of making people who do not have that same opportunity pay for others to go?  <br>  <br>  Again if we're serious about opening up access the money must go into early years education otherwise  Uni will remain the pursuit of the privileged.<br>  <br>  ______________________________<br>  Edit 4: (yeah I know..  this is an issue I feel strongly about)<br>  <br>  Flying mop dog:  Do you mind me asking, do you currently have to pay back your debt or are the repayments tied into you earning over a certain amount?<br>  <br>  I think it’s great you’re doing your doctorate but that’s your choice to make and if you finish it you’ll end up more employable and making more money (which I presume is why you’re choosing to make the sacrifice).  I’m sorry I may have taken you up wrong but do you really think those who haven’t gone to Uni should have to pay for postgrad education never mind 3rd level??<br>  <br>  Graduates have it easier than non-graduates in the long run it's a fact.  Therefore I fail to see why those who don’t go to uni should subsidise those who do.  <br>  I’ve recently been through 3rd level education and I'm sorry to say a big percentage of students don’t realise how lucky they are (not attending lectures, not participating in seminars etc).   <br>  <br>  3rd level education is a privilege, decent early years education should be a right IMHO.|`|AA10985791	I saw that on the news, and all I wondered was 'where the hell do they get cheap drink from?

As one poster said it is the<br>  Minority that give people a bad name. I actually find many students have great manners. Many work min wage jobs to stay in college. I find that these students actually go out of their way to help people in restaurants etc.<br>  <br>  I know the rich kids you are on about. But that is a minority. They annoy me too.<br>  They never tend lectures and they get a load of money from “Mommy dearest”.<br>  Some spend eight years in college for a four-year degree because they repeat a few times. It is like an extended first year. I did debating in college. We would be against some right snobs with no manners that drank way too much and would have sex with anything.<br>  But only some are like that. Galway university debaters were actually the nicest of people.<br>  <br>  In relation to drink, not all students drink. In final two years of collage many students drink far less than a person their own age in full employment. Projects and exams keep them busy. Even people who are very fond of their drink do this.<br>  <br>  Did you ever observe students waiting for buses or trains? I do and I can tell you they are very helpful. Many elder people come up to them for directions and these students are very polite to them.<br>  <br>  Personally if I have to ask directions, I ask a student.<br>  <br>  I got no grant for collage and had to work like a dog during the summer to fund my social life. (50-60 hours a week) Saved for a year working before I went to collage at all. €6000 a year on drink, are you serious? I spent less than that in a year on all living expenses in collage term and my summers in Killarney. (Excluding rent) and I used to go out quite a lot in Collage and the summer every second night.<br>  <br>  My parents did not fund my social life ever, nor would I expect them too.<br>  <br>  And drink is no longer cheap. I drank Buckfast in collage (now about 11euro). (Apparently a winos drink). And do you know what I never was kicked out of a nightclub or caused anti social behaviour.<br>  I just had the crack and danced away.<br>  <br>  Rag week is so much fun. You do not even have to drink to enjoy it.<br>  I had two friends who did not drink and loved Rag Week.<br>  It is “The week” in collage.<br>  Some people only go out this week in the collage term if they are strapped for cash.<br>  To take that away from them is a disgrace.<br>  It also does fund raising for charity, people tend to forget this.<br>  <br>  But take away rag week from these poor Galway students.<br>  Let them pay full fees.<br>  While you’re at it take away their student saving cards.<br>  The best things come in threes, don’t they say?<br>  <br>  I can assure you that future students will not be inclined to put you in a good old folks home.<br>  They will be too busy trying to pay a 30000euros (being generous about it) in collage loans, to afford a good old folks home for ye.<br>  <br>  They will just end up resenting you for not standing up for them.<br>  And do you know what I wouldn't blame them.<br>  <br>  Edit: There is not enough jobs for Graduates this year. Add up five years of a bad economy and Graduates will be lucky to get a 20k a year in a job. With some degrees you get a low enough income with a job. But that is the type of area they are interested in.<br>  <br>  Edit: Note 18k is about 40hours a week min wage in the Republic. Some Graduates can only get min wage jobs. That is forever for some. You could get 30k if you worked your way up.<br>  Yep I noticed ye get little in the North. 14k Stirling for a job you need skills and experience in.|`|q9PVawNyaa	Well I'm currently €6,000 in debt and just had to quit one of my two jobs after a series of armed robberies. I barely have money for food let alone drink. I'm already paying €5,000 a year in fees and my Dad's job has just gone. I'm about to start a doctorate and if I don't get funding then I'm going to be completely screwed. Mammy and Daddy aren't picking up my tab and the councils don't help either. How about you try doing it before judging the entire student population of Ireland on the actions of a few people who don't give a **** about the academics.<br>  <br>  I've spent €50 on drink since September.|`|f3LrMhqWaa	it's the same old story. Everyone hears about the few messers and the well behaved people are forgotten about. Some of RAG week in UCC was cancelled, due to the death of a student, but some people did take RAG week to the extreme, like setting couches on fire!!!|`|EJGRLwvoaa	I'm going to college next year and if the fees were introduced it would be almost impossible for me to support myself for the number of years i'd be staying there. As said above there are those few that ruin it for the rest of us and if they can afford to be going out drinking every night then they should pay their own college fees. But there are people out there that cannot afford it, myself included, especially the way the economy is at the moment. But i totally agree that those that can afford it should pay.|`|egqveuPjaa	In all fairness, it's just a few idiotic prats that ruin it for everybody else. A lot of students, those who are studying hard and work at uni use this week to relax, have fun and gain a different side to uni, but there will always been those who are lazing about, wasting everybodys time and causing trouble.<br>  I think cancelling Rag Week was a huge mistake- it is part of NUIG's history and usually one of the higlights of the year for students.|`|f2959c3466eb9458fc5521de90e563d3aa	No, it's the age. Students drink to blow off steam and meet the opposite sex - same as ever. They shouldn't be penalized for it.|`|839be5UKaa	You're right being able to afford a few drinks absolutley equates to having €6000 a year to spend on tuition fees.<br>  <br>  I just hope that while all these taxpayers are sitting up at night losing their sleep they think on the fact that it'll be these students who will be susidising them when they're retired, their pensions, their medical cards etc.
SjAewiyMaa	Much depends on whether you come on a weekend or weekday. You can obviously shop or eat 7 days a week, but most weekends you can do things the locals do like walk around the village or Central Park or and take in a street fair/flea market. There's a good calendar of local events on the NYC Tourist Center website <a href="http://www.nyctouristcenter.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.nyctouristcenter.com</a> plus it doesn't hurt to prepare yourself in advance since you're only going to be here for a couple of days. They also have discounted passes to stuff like the Wax Museum, as someone else suggested. The more you know now, the less you'll feel like a tourist later. Preparation is key!|`|XYZswqmvaa	In New York? My favorite thing is the Wax Museum-celebrities made out of wax. Its so much fun! And go to Bubba Gumps for dinner! Best food in NYC!

E5gaKzCsaa	There isn't much info out there on it, is there? Wouldn't be surprised if it exists on maps but not in real life. If there's anyone there, they're probably Kwakiutl(don't ask me to spell the modern equivalent) so look at that name on the net. You could look on the net for a list of native bands in BC and try calling some for info. Look for ones in Alert Bay or Port Hardy, maybe Campbell River or even Bella Coola or Bella Bella. You could write snail mail to the Postmistress at Port Neville BC which isn't far from Hardwicke. If she hasn't retired(unlikely), that's Lorna Hansen Chesluk, she grew up there in Port Neville and probably knows what's going on in the neighbourhood. Can't find an email address but there's no power up there so who knows if she even has one.<br>  <br>  Failing any of those, I'd get hold of someone at one of the universities in BC--UBC, UVic, SFU. Someone in one of them has to know something.<br>  <br>  The nearest town to Hardwicke is Sayward, and as it happens, I'm expecting someone who lives there to drop in shortly. I'll pick his brain for you. He says there are definitely people living on Hardwicke but he thinks not too many are native.

1d718ff96585004e8d1e8bc312c3655daa	Um, I lived in Buffalo for four years and it's NOTHING compared to New York.  Of course it's cheaper - besides the once monthly shows at the HSBC Arena, or going to a Bills game (gross), you have nothing to do.  You have to drive everywhere, there are no jobs, and the city depends on its universities (particularly UB, but a little bit Buff State) for its revenue and "diversity". <br>  <br>  New York has a million and a half things to do, or more, there's culture and diversity, there are parks and activities, and a very comprehensive public transportation system (not just a stupid little "subway" that runs up Main Street).  There are job opportunities in all fields and sectors, even in this horrible economy, and there are dozens of outstanding universities and colleges.  It's expensive because you don't get paid $25,000 for your first job out of college - double that, actually.  I was offered a paralegal job at a law firm after graduating from UB for $30,000 a year in salary - and apparently that's good!  But, I chose to return home and pay $1000 for a "craphole" apartment (which, by the way, in Brooklyn, I'm only paying $875.00 for a very nice studio in a very nice area with all utilities included) so that I could have a choice of good graduate schools and a part time job that pays as much as full time job in Buffalo would.<br>  <br>  Buffalo is a quaint little "city" that offers stability and a quiet life.  Lots of people prefer that, and I don't want to make it seem like I'm knocking it because I did have a lot of fun with my college friends, living in Amherst and North Tonawanda and paying $600 a month for a two bedroom, going to Canada and Chippewa, etc., etc., but I wouldn't choose that over home, here in New York, ever. So don't knock it 'til you try it - you might be surprised how worth it New York City is.|`|b3fcaed1380d38d593a8cb71556b4d96aa	It's all about supply and demand.  There are a lot more people in NYC, with a limited amount of residential space, and a lot more people want to live there.  There are more jobs there, and salaries are higher.  If you really want to compare rents in Buffalo and NYC, you also have to compare salaries.  What percentage of your salary goes for rent?  That's the only way to get a meaningful comparison.  It's like when they say, oh, back in 1960 you could buy a house for $16,000.  Yeah, but the average salary was probably about $6,000/year.  Prices are meaningless without context.  <br>  When people all start heading to Buffalo to make their fortunes, rents will rise there.<br>  BTW, there are "normal homes" aka houses in NYC.  You're thinking only of Manhattan, which, yes, doesn't have many houses like you're used to in Buffalo.  But all of the other boroughs--Queens, Brooklyn, the Bronx, and Staten Island--have many single-family homes.  In fact, Staten Island is mostly like that.|`|lZVz8SwBaa	because buffalo sucks no one wants to live there and the city is amazing.|`|2Yijblbaaa	bc everyone wants to live there! the big apple, baby!|`|xiB1BPwsaa	You get what you pay for.<br>  <br>  I bet you could get a 2 story, 3 bedroom in Baghdad for $50 a month.

b8tgCAQJaa	Well, you certainly can't travel the entire country on a ￡8 ticket!<br>  <br>  Your ticket probably says "Route: Any permitted". What this actually means is "any permitted route", not "any route permitted".<br>  <br>  The permitted routes are the ones that go via certain routing points. The rules can get quite complicated, but you generally aren't allowed to take a route that doubles back on itself (unless that's unavoidable), or take a significantly longer route than is necessary to complete your journey.<br>  <br>  On very long journeys "any permitted" actually gives you quite a lot of possibilities - e.g. if you're going London to Scotland there are probably quite a number of different route combinations that would be valid.<br>  <br>  And if I wanted to travel from my home in Newcastle to Manchester for example, I could go the obvious way via York and Leeds or the much less obvious way via Carlisle and Preston, but I wouldn't be allowed to go via Doncaster and Sheffield, or via Glasgow.<br>  <br>  However, for relatively local journeys, you generally can't go too far out of your way en route from A to B.

You have the last movies in french or in english, you can play games (for instance, Who want to be a millionaire ?) or listen to music. Also, you can get information on the trip (speed, time left...). It is the only thing I remember but I think there was something else.
MR4WwKoZaa	If you're going on coach, it always is a bummer.  Crampy, food is bad, no personal entertainment system, no electricity jack for your laptop, no priority check in, no priority security lane, no priority boarding, late getting out, late getting your luggage, etc.<br>  <br>  I consider going on coach like going on a bus, the only value for it is the fact that it gets me from a to b.  If I want comfort, business is the choice, or first class if someone else is paying.<br>  <br>  Having said that Cathay Pacific is way better than Air France.  Other excellent airlines are Emirates and Singapore Air.

f43be0279e4f60717eb598a32d93faa0aa	Keep a small phrasebook with you, great for pointing to words/phrases.<br>  <br>  In less touristy areas don't be offended by people pointing or staring, especially if one of you is blonde, has a blonde child..it's just curiosity.<br>  <br>  The meat on a stick you'll see often sold by Chinese Muslims is only about 2 yuan a stick and is great for eating on the go. As are many other stall food. In Beijing head for Wangfujing. About half way up the main street there is a left turn into a small ally, it's full of food stalls, including snakes, scorpion, etc deep fried and is a busy hub of eating and watching people, usually full of foreigners too.<br>  <br>  The subway is excellent.  3 yuan for a flat rate ticket in the central zone, signs in English, clean, and modern. The same goes for Shanghai.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  bu yao (yao as in ow, ouch) means no thanks..you'll need to know it.  For hawkers, taxi drivers etc.<br>  Bargain for everything, even in some department stores it is accepted. My rule of thumb for street vendors is start between 1/3 and 1/5 of their asking price..bargaining is a game so keep a sense of humour. Smile and have fun, you're much more likely to get a better deal than if you are too serious. If you feel like it just say no and walk off, if they think they can still make a profit they'll call you back.<br>  <br>  Water bottles are generally 1 yuan, 2 yuan in more touristy areas..I never pay more than 2 yuan for a bottle. Same with ice lollies. <br>  Eat in local restaurants and get the prices sorted before ordering or make a note of the price of dishes you order from the menu. I never had stomach problems, just wash your hands or use wet wipe tissues before eating anything with your hands. Western restaurant chains are popular but usually more expensive, particularly Pizza Hut etc.<br>  <br>  Shanghai, take the river ferry from The Bund, then you can walk 10 minutes to Jin Mao tower (50 Yuan to the Observation Deck).<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Always carry small loose change in a front pocket, great for buying small items without getting wallets/purses out.<br>  <br>  Always check your change, don't be embarrassed, they'll sure check yours. Particularly 50's. And never hand over a 100 until they have prepared change, as it's a common scam to swap it and give you a 100 back claiming it's fake. What they do is skillfully swap your real note for a fake.<br>  <br>  Be careful of pickpockets in crowded situations, buses, subway queues etc. Always get taxi receipts and catch buses from the Airport, the shuttles or Maglev if you fly into Shanghai, it's great. Taxi's from Beijing Airport to the centre should be 100yuan tops. Agree beforehand if you really want a taxi but the shuttle bus was about 16 yuan last time I took it last year.

bMJ0AYI1aa	they hardly ever give tickets for that in the city, but it is illegal. are you sure the yellow line was dashed? i think it's solid there. but even if it's broken, you can make a left over it, but you can't make a uturn in the middle of a street.|`|mmWeBRRtaa	I believe that the part of Clement Street with diagonal parking on one side has a single broken yellow line between the two lanes.<br>  <br>  The important thing, however, is that this section of Clement Street is a business district.  Here's what the DMV driver's handbook says about U-turns in business districts:<br>  <br>  "Never make a U-turn ...<br>  In business districts.  ... Turn only at an intersection or where openings are provided for turns."<br>  <br>  It's OK to make a U-turn in a business district at an intersection, but not in the middle of the block (which I presume you did).  The question then becomes this:  Is a turn into a diagonal parking space on the other side of the street a U-turn?  It would have been legal if you had made a left turn (90 degrees) into a driveway.  In your case, you made a turn of more than 90 degrees into a parking space.  Is that a U-turn?<br>  <br>  Here's how the California Vehicle Code defines a U-turn:<br>  665.5.  A "U-turn" is the turning of a vehicle upon a highway so as to proceed in the opposite direction whether accomplished by one continuous movement or not.<br>  <br>  Because you changed direction more than 90 degrees, it probably qualifies as a U-turn, although you might try to argue the point (by saying that you were parking rather than "proceeding").<br>  <br>  If you fight the ticket, you might get lucky and win; but if you lose, you might lose the right to take traffic school, and then be worse off than you would have been by not fighting it.  It's probably simpler to pay the ticket and take traffic school (preferably online) so that your insurance rates won't go up.<br>  <br>  --- edit<br>  <br>  You might be interested in this article from Manhattan Beach:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ci.manhattan-beach.ca.us/Modules/ShowDocument.aspx?documentid=5000" rel="nofollow">http://www.ci.manhattan-beach.ca.us/Modu...</a><br>  <br>  The same issue came up in Manhattan Beach in July 2008.  The police there would write tickets to drivers who did exactly what you did, but drivers continued to do it because they didn't realize it was illegal.  It was recommended that the city paint double double yellow lines on the street to make it clearer that this is prohibited.<br>  <br>  So the bottom line is:<br>  1) what you did was illegal<br>  2) many drivers don't know it's illegal<br>  <br>  So you really don't have much of a claim for innocence except ignorance of the law, and that's famous for not being a good excuse.  I recommend that you pay the ticket and take traffic school.|`|eulMjLtPaa	Technically, you would have had to do a u-turn, since the spots there are a sharp diagonal.  If you'd made a direct left turn, you wouldn't have been inside the parking spot.  Plus, it was a business district, so they're stricter there.  <br>  <br>  California vehicle code:  22102.  No person in a business district shall make a U-turn, except at an intersection, or on a divided highway where an opening has been provided in accordance with Section 21651.

You can look for flights ( try www.skyscanner.net) ,where you can get some very cheap flights ( but you can pay a bit to get to and from airports....especially in the uk!)<br>  otherwise buses are cheaper www.eurolines.com have some good deals at times as well ( in the uk you can look at www.nationalexpress.co.uk which is linked to eurolines as well)<br>  <br>  Accommodation is a huge expense...the cheapest is sharing a room in a hostel. There are lots of websites..try these www.hostels.com, www.hostelworld.com, www.hostelbookers.com or www.lonelyplanet.com. Note that some cheaper hostels are often further from the centre and take time to get there ( and it often costs to get there via public transport so read all the info about your accommodaiton)<br>  <br>  walking is cheap and saves you money. Amsterdam is quite small and you can walk the main parts, Paris has most of the places of interest in the centre and within walking distance (you can get a metro ticket.. i got a carte orange but i think there have been changes to that so check it out). London is a bit more spread out but you can get to a lot by walking around and the tube/bus will get you elsewhere.<br>  You can get a museum pass in paris but it does not contain all the museums and you do need to go to a few to make it worthwhile but there are quite a list of musems including the louvre ( an getting the ticket before going in at kiosks around the city saves time waiting to get in).....Some places are free as well so make most of those things too ( eg you can walk up to the lower level of the eiffel tower otherwise you pay)<br>  Don't buy too much in the way of souveniers...i literally only bought postcards in many places otherwise they were cheap trinkets.

3m6XHotKaa	Generally speaking a tour package will be cheaper, it depends of course on the company you are booking the package with. Should be either a local travel agency (like Wing On Travel) or at least one that also operates in Hong Kong. The reason behind is that especially in Hong Kong alot of locals are very price oriented, so to make a package interesting it simply needs to be cheaper than if you buy each component seperately. Every involved party cuts away a bit of their margin and thus they help to promote eachothers services by offering a comparetively cheap package.<br>  <br>  One advice though, I have been very disappointed with Disneyland (after wanting to go there for more than 20 years :) ). Its really small and the attractions are in my (western) eyes mainly for small children.<br>  <br>  Ocean Park on the other hand is bigger and more fun for adults.<br>  <br>  <br>  So depending on your age and who you are going to bring along, I would recommend to think about it.

I have driven that route as far as Veracruz before, and my friends just did it 2 days ago.   I know others who have continued on to Cancun.  The highway is much better after Tampico and stays good after that.  I have heard of no problems on the highways in this part of Mexico...I live in Veracruz state.  The only thing is...it is a TERRIBLY long trip.  I hope you speak Spanish.  The unexpected can and does happen...just had other friends come down a few weeks ago and they were involved in a serious accident.  With no language skills, that would be very difficult to deal with.  You would have to stay overnite 3 nites at least. It is about 36 hrs driving time. It would actually be far better to take a Greyhound to Brownsville, then a taxi across the bridge, then an ADO bus to Mex. city , then another ADO bus to Cancun...there are other lines too, but ADO is the best.....and, yes, they all make connections thru Mexico City. They  are super nice, you  could sleep at nite, get there faster, and be very safe.  Would probably be cheaper too.  Or you can check out flights from Austin on Vivaaerobus ... they have great bargains at times.  I really would advise a single adult not to make that trip...no one to help you drive...I am afraid you would regret it.  Look around for a good price on flights.  Road signs in Mexico are NOT like in the U.S....they are scant,  often hard to find or just plain missing.  Easy to get lost driving thru Tampico...I have done it several times...and the highways are very complex and often have no signs there.  Once you add up the gas, tolls, hotels and food expenses, you will find it not so cheap to drive. So...it is not the  danger of crime i would worry about...it is the challenges and length of the trip.  You would also need a Mexican car permit and car insurance and a Mexican Road atlas...the Guia Roji ( avail. at large bookstores or on Amazon.com).   Better to choose a closer vacation or to fly.<br>  Edit: just saw other answers and have to tell you... I live just outside Xalapa...it is NOT on the route to Cancun...about 75 miles inland from the coastal highway you would be on...and there is NO rafting in Xalapa...the rafting is about an hour from Xalapa in a little town you would never find unless  you stop and pick me up...I live on the road that leads there !|`|IkWfZ8xPaa	i won't say that it will be dangerous...remember alot of people have their minds poisoned by the media in this country..i am a american citizen and people said i would have problems...5 months later..not one person has messed with me. It will however be a LONG drive...and the roads are sometimes not the best..be sure you plan your route really well...

kgBPU4xxaa	Probably not. Check the labeling on the adaptor that you have. If it says 100 - 240 V; 50 - 60 Hz, then it will work in both locations. If it's only for American voltages, then you also need a voltage converter. It's highly likely that what you have will work in both the US & Europe as long as it includes the plug adaptor so you can plug it in in Europe.
