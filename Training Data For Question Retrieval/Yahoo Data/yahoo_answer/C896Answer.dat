QUjJELtVaa	You won't get an agreement to pay future medical costs from an insurance company.  They won't agree to any settlement that is open ended even if you get an attorney.  You should at the very least expect to receive payment for your medical bills and some additional amount for pain and suffering.  It seems to me that even at $11,000 you are getting low balled.  Do you have medical insurance to cover the $10,500 or is this all out of pocket?  If it is all out of pocket and you want to be able to pay your medical bills you may ask your insurance company to settle on the medical piece and leave your pain and suffering to be settled when you've had more time to heal.  <br>  Keep in mind that if you do have medical insurance that paid for your bills if you receive a settlement from your auto insurance company that includes payment of medical bills you may have to repay the medical insurance company for anything they paid on your behalf.|`|02023201c466ca1751d4f14fb53cd526aa	You gave great detail on the accident, but what is not quite clear is the other party had no insurance.   Is that right?  Your insurance company took care of everything and is offering you a settlement?  <br>  <br>  I think your insurance company has done a great job of taking care of paying the damage to your car and your injuries.   I would take their final settlement offer.    Just imagine if you did not have uninsured motorist you would have got nothing.   After you settle your insurance company will be sueing the other party to get their money back.<br>  <br>  I think your insurance company has been more than fair. They will only pay you up to the limit on your policy.      Sounds like to me you may have missed posted some details.   If not, then I would just settle.   Sounds like a great company, just wondering which company is it?
Ndy67CTuaa	If he owes the money, AE will get a judgement. Once they get it, at that amount of money, they will put a lein on your house and if or when your dad sells they will get their money first after the mortgage is paid. Better to speak with them and either make a cash settlement offer of half the amount or make a new payment agreement with them. The other alternative is bankruptcy which will get rid of all his debt and still be able to keep the house. You may want to tell your father to see a lawyer before it gets any further along i the collection process.|`|3MM64geHaa	We have a society right now that does not pay their debts and a system that is enabling that. They may actually reduce what he owes.  They could go after the equity in your father's home or other assets and quite frankly, they should.  If they do not. the cost will be passed on to those who actually pay for what they spend.|`|XxUsLqXRaa	They cant take his house unless he signed it over to them as collateral for the credit card, and no one does that.  If he is employed, they can garnish his wages.  If he isn't employed, I'm not 100% certain if they can put a lien on his house or not, but they are entitled to $35,000 worth of his estate when he dies.....maybe even a LOT more by then if they are adding late fees or other penalties. Basically that means, whatever your Dad leaves to his kids, has to be sold and the full balance then paid to American Express.  If the house is still mortgaged, you'd have to pay the bank off first once the house is sold, and then pay American Express out of whatever is left. Obviously, I don't know your Dad's story, but since we live in an age where middle-class tax payers are sick of "supporting" others who cant pay their bills, it IS rather infuriating to know your father lives in a half million dollar home but is dumping his $35,000 debt off on the tax payers.  If he wasn't your father, and if you're old enough to be paying taxes, you'd understand.

AcgDcQG0aa	If global warming will affect food production.  Then companies that do genetic engineering for food crops probably will do better than other companies.  Because genetic engineering is the fastest and the most efficient way to adapt food crops to the new environment.<br>  <br>  But I don't think this possibility has yet been reflected in the stock prices of these companies.  Because investors don't yet know when and how much global warming will affect food production.<br>  <br>  Perhaps when there are food shortages and food prices go up a lot.  Then stock prices of most agricultural companies will also go up a lot.  Because profits for such companies will increase due to higher food prices.|`|Pjm9pg7iaa	The stock market does not currently reflect our concerns with global warming. It could appear in the future. Crops could be grown in Minnesota in winter in an extreme scenario of global warming. That could increase the value of many stocks..
Pjm9pg7iaa	Yes, a few of the owners of big companies did make $365 Million a year so that means that they made $1Million a day.  Some baseball and basketball players make $500,000 per game.  <br>  The companies that paid $1Million a day said that they could pay that much because the boss was so good that the company made $1Billion per day. Paying him $1Million was peanuts (that's what they said but we now know it isn't true).
Pjm9pg7iaa	You have to stay away from retail and grocery stores. Too many applicants. Get a zoning map and find out where the industrial areas are located. Go there. No young people ever go there. You may end up loading a truck but you will get a job..
c2YcBbXyaa	yes..you should definately call her to show that you're still interested in the job....she's probably busy and didn't get a chance to call you and would appreciate your initiative....|`|qGh1HhPwaa	You can call her and ask if she needs any additional information to help her come to a decision.<br>  Something may have come up, he being sick, etc.<br>  She may be waiting for your call to see how interested you are.|`|AA11066099	Hi, phone her today, the exact same thing has just happened to my friend and she initially was told that the owner was in a meeting and I insisted she tried again later that day.When she eventually got hold of her she was informed that her application was successful! After all maybe its just a ploy to see how undeterred you are.xGood Luck.|`|AA12279950	Definitely call her.  Perhaps she's waiting on purpose to see if you use your initiative.  Either way, it won't alter the outcome - either you've got the job or you haven't and at least this will shorten your wait.  <br>  <br>  Best of luck to you - hope you get it! x|`|wzLvf0plaa	Yes call her. Maybe for some reason she lost your number. Whenever they hire someone they usually call the other close people up afterwards to say sorry you didnt get it, or send a letter, so maybe something is wrong?|`|AA11220909	You NEVER EVER phone a potential employer to chase up the result of an interview.<br>  <br>  It makes you REALLY desperate and not worth employing.|`|1qhCVnOpaa	I'd definately give her a call, it will show enthusiasm and if she has made her decision but hasnt had chance to let that person know, you might find out some good news? on the other hand if she has chickened out of calling you because she has given the job to the other person but given you the impression it was yours, well in that case i doubt she will phone so it will be best for you to call and find out,|`|1UUxVhQ3aa	I think you should call, i don't think it would like you were begging, to me it would look like you were keen and interested in the job.<br>  <br>  This has happened to me with jobs that i've had but also ones i didn't get and it annoys me when they don't let you know because you might pass on another job because you think you've got one|`|fa71f432ab49a82c94c670c72b890926aa	yes call her n check about the is she gonna hire u or not. or u hav to wait for som more time.but i think she may not call u again coz if she wanted then she would hav call on the same day.may b she may call u today or tomoro n if she does it means she is nota good leader or manager coz she does her work late.n no need to work under such ppl|`|MKWrLkH8aa	Call her, you're not begging. She said things would be finalised on Monday so you were entitled to expect a yes or no on that day. Just say "I'm just calling to find out if you have made a decision regarding the position".

But it does look as if she has made her decision.  Dont be disheartened as in these times its very hard to find work.  Good luck to you.|`|8aVq045Gaa	Yes you should have called her Tuesday.  You say I am calling to inquire about the position I applied for.  Do you know if the position has been filled?|`|WC2bTHkKaa	Yes. you should call her because you need to know what the deal is with this. It sounds to me like she wanted to hire you and especially if she said she would call. Employers and managers are very busy people. They need reminding of these things, although I think if she seemed that intent on giving you the job it would seem foolish not to have called you already. She may just have forgotten, or been too busy.  Otherwise, I have no idea what the deal is. So call her, ask her what's up, and if you've got the job. Take it from there.|`|eYJEgx3paa	You must call her, after all you want the job.<br>  <br>  But before you do, make some notes about what you are going to say to her and how your are going to say it. You could (for the purposes of the call) assume she has been busy and has not had time to call.<br>  Whatever you say, make the call standing up,choose the best time to call (avoid lunch times, busy mornings etc) but prepare yourself thoroughly and assume the job is yours.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  Neil

What you have to do is complete surveys and offers for companies that want the public's opinion. No payment from you is ever required, not to sign up, not EVER.<br>  <br>  The sites don't get paid directly from you, but when you complete an offer or survey, they also get paid a small portion of what you earned yourself. For example, if you complete a survey about computers let's say, you would earn maybe $2 and the web site itself would recieve $0.50 from the company also for getting you to complete the survey. These surveys take little time at all, most taking up less than even 1 or 2 minutes of your time.<br>  <br>  They don’t need any information other than your name, email address and your home address. Yup, that is all. No credit card information, no banking information, nothing like that. All they require is your name and address so that your cheque can be sent to your home every month.<br>  <br>  Personally I have been a member of these websites, along with thousands of other satisfied users, for approximately 1.5 years now and have earned well over $8600 by working in my spare time.

pt6wIlS1aa	Yes, you can try that. But when you do contact them, don't tell them how much you have. Instead, ask what amount you could pay to have them agree to call it paid in full. Maybe they'll ask for less. If you say up front that you have $8K, they might demand it and then insist you pay the rest in monthly payments.<br>  <br>  A lot of what they're "writing off" is just their own penalties and fees that they tack on, plus extra interest anyway.|`|20lCgb6Uaa	That is possible, but why not see if you can cancel them altogether? If you have credit cards or loans taken out before 1 April 2007 visit www.bdebtfree.info and they will help you.|`|qjsXrMfHaa	Yes, you can. But when you contact your creditor to negotiate, DO NOT tell them that you have 8K. When you contact them to negotiate, let them know that you are going through a hardship and that you will like to negotiate. If you ask you how much you have to offer, just try to offer less than what you really have because that way you will be debt free and you will also have some savings available. Creditors prefer to negotiate and get some money back other than not negotiating and probably losing everything, especially with today s economy. Also, something very important, if you agree on something with them make sure that they give you PROOF OF SETTLEMENT so later on they do not go after you for the rest of money.<br>  Please let me know if you have any questions.

My return was accepted on 01/30 and I had a direct deposit date of 02/13/09 and then it was moved to 02/17/09 and then it went into the 1301 code where it still is.  I have called every week and I get a different lie everytime I call.  First I was told it was in errors and it was their technical issue, not mine.  Then I called again and I was told by this guy that it was just about to come out of errors and I would get my refund next week.  Then I called again today and the lady told me that they don't have a refund date and I they don't know why it's in errors and they have 4 weeks to figure it out.  They also say they only do updates once a week and that's over the weekend and I won't get an update until next Monday and not to call back until then.  WTF is their problem.  I know I shouldn't rely on my refund, but I was laid off in October and I have 3 kids, some of us actually NEED that money like yesterday.  Unreal.|`|QIFTEXOiaa	Im like the rest of the replies....sent mine e-file and was accepted 1-30. Had the dd date of 2-13 then changed to 2-17, stayed that way til 2-18 then changed to the all famous code of 1301. Spoke to csr and was assured it was their problem not mine, and should be dd on the 20th(it wasnt) called back again, told pretty much the same story, except that this time it was in the "error resolution dept" and apparently with that, the csr has no idea why, or what the error is, but hes "sure its not an error on my part"??? which I think makes no sense what so ever....If there is an error, why dont they call us so it can be fixed and we can all move on?? To me that would speed things up quite a bit, and would correct some of the "backlogging" he mentioned. Anyway, so I called yesterday, spoke to a lady who knew as little as the previous gentlemen, and said there is now no dd date, and its still in the error dept, with no other explanation and to just keep calling once a week til we get it....now the only thing different this year is we did claim a casualty and theft due to hurricane Ike...but I cant see how that would throw them off for a month, and no one would know how to correct it?

You are going to get ripped off!! There are so many opportunities that will cost a great deal less.<br>  <br>  I just joined a new Network marketing home business that pre launched in October and is set to launch globally in March. There are no start up fees. It simply cost $40 per month. I have made a profit every month since joining and expect my next check to be around $300. It continues to rise every month. We expect to have over 1 million members by this time next year all of which will be beneath me earning me thousands every month. This is the only network marketing business of its kind in the world. We have no competition! I'm loving it, especially since I don't have to sell any products, I just promote the concept. I'm making money and expect a few years from now to be making in upwards of 5 figures a month.|`|72aa4d0937174be512576dfccdea6b0eaa	Let me give you an advise,  these kind of networks lack any kind of production and the money is earned by claiming money from your sub group so It's cheating others to gain money and this means stealing.|`|QTLJnJtHaa	Be careful of the advice you accept. I do not know much about this company nor do I know what country you reside in. If 3000 dollars is in US currency - check your state laws - unless there is a way to join for considerably less your state may require that the company provide you with disclosure documents if this amount exceeds the "business opportunity" threshold. Again this only applies in USA. <br>  <br>  According to the website the companies headquarters are located in Hong Kong. 3000.00 HKD (Hong Kong Dollars) coverts to roughly 386.668 USD (United States Dollars). This amount would be comparable with many US based Network Marketing companies if you are talking HKD currency.<br>  <br>  If you want to know its potential to earn money or if its safe - Start off buy purchasing the products and services at retail cost. Do you enjoy the products? Can you see yourself selling these products to others? Is the pricing competitive? Do they have a real market value?<br>  <br>  Answering these questions will go a long way in telling you your potential to earn income. <br>  <br>  Company management is essential. Are they competent and cable of running a successful company? What experience do they possess? Compensation plan is important. Is it a front weighted, middle weighted, or back weighted plan? Your goals will be a determining factor in the type of compensation plan you choose. Most people you recruit will be in favor of a middle weighted compensation plan. <br>  <br>  There are tons of other factors that can be considered but an easy place to start would be your experience using the products. Look for a company that encourages retail sales.

RNqRnG86aa	KHUJEMA K, In order to get an answer you must first ask a question.
kQMt51iraa	logistics is basically in broader term means sending goods or material from one place to another. this will include everything like dispatching, loading, unloading, insurance cover of goods, placing in the shipment and many other things. KPI according to my knowledge is key performance indicators. These are basically the standards which are established for the individuals during their performance appraisals.|`|0191j9waaa	logistics means: move cargo from Place A to Place B!|`|PnIO5uo9aa	logistics-Handling an operation that involves providing labor and materials be supplied as?needed

Not just normal beginner English; you would be teaching "Business English" to people who need to speak flawless English in their company dealings. You can get someone to write the ad for you in the local German newspaper. You won't be able to do this until you arrive in Vilseck. <br>  There aren't any Vilseck websites for jobs..|`|AA12005775	First thing would be to look into if you are even allowed to work. Normally if a person is transferred overseas for their job, their spouse can not legally work. However, I think this is different for the military. Try also on the military base.
5zQbG8TDaa	They have warehouses all across the country. The goods come in from the suppliers. Then when the stores order the items they are filled and delivered.
MHg9JhEKaa	That's not enough income between you for ￡700/month rent. Find somewhere cheaper to rent than that. Your council tax and bills etc on top of that rent is gonna eat right into your income - you guys will have hardly anything at all left to live on. No you wouldn't get any help I'm afraid. <br>  <br>  ￡725 / month income<br>  -------------------------------------<br>  ￡350 rent<br>  ￡65 c. tax (approx)<br>  ￡15 water<br>  ￡30 elec<br>  ￡30 gas<br>  ￡100 food <br>  ￡30 mobile phone<br>  ￡5 contents insurance<br>  ---------------<br>  leaves ￡25 a week for going out / paying off debts / running a car (if applicable)<br>  <br>  So you really need to find somewhere cheaper to rent rather than expecting the government to help you out so you can have somewhere nice to live. Sorry guys that's the reality!|`|Hae8acnpaa	No it is unlikely. At 18 you are not entitled to full LHA anyway only an amount towards a room in a shared house. <br>  <br>  ￡700 is a lot of rent to pay out of your earnings c an't you find something more manageable?|`|Ld1vLH8Kaa	No unless you have kids which may qualify you for family tax credits.

If not, surely you can lower your expectations and get a smaller place to rent? <br>  <br>  There wont be any help with that income. You may get some if you're earning less than 16000 a year combine - before any tax and national insurance, but loks like you'd be earning too much.|`|XSXdMu0caa	i dont think so cos your worknig full time <br>  contact your local  authority and see what they say <br>  i nkwo you can get a rent rebate but i dont know enough about it, i thought it was only if you were on low hours|`|jfOSVSQkaa	No|`|AA11908567	￡700 for rent, that's very expensive if it excludes bills.<br>  <br>  That is close to all my bills including mortgage.
xhOw5yTmaa	If it were me, I would go to vistaprint.com, get some business cards printed up for FREE, and talk to all the stores in your area that sale CDs and records. I would talk to them about handing out your cards. If they don't or can't, then target places that everyone goes to. Department stores (leave them on the shelves, inside of pockets in clothing, etc.) Put them inside of the coin slots in vending machines. Inside of newspaper vending machines. Tape them to the front of Pepsi machines, etc. It's the easiest and most inexpensive way of getting your name out there.|`|3X9M04Xmaa	craigslist.org- It's free and will cover more territory for you than just flyers|`|cJRFbZUaaa	Think of the age groups of your potential students and post your flyers where they (or the family members paying for the lessons) would see them.

iqZUd5Fdaa	All you need on your CV is name, adress, etc, qualifications, employment, hobbies. Write on a seperate letter why you would be good for the job. The key things to add are - you're a people person, you have excellent communication skills, you work well in a team, find some things to back up what you're saying. Like "I am an excellent communicator, my previous job involved working with the public" or "at school i was a member of the student council which developed my skills as a communicator" Big yourself up|`|AA11220909	CV's must ONLY contain information about your Education and previous employment.<br>  <br>  If it contains a personal statement it will go STRAIGHT in the rubbish bin UNREAD - FACT.|`|UAW1U3Uoaa	The appropriate style of CV depends on the job you are applying for and the information they have requested. The person who claims CVs with personal statements go straight in the bin is talking utter rubbish however I would suggest for a job of this type it would probably be innappropriate.<br>  <br>  Your CV should include your full name, date of birth, address, telephone number, (email optional), education and any previous employment details, you may also like to include voluntary work, interests etc that may be relevant to the job e.g, interest in fine dining, wines, cocktails etc.<br>  <br>  Do a search on google for more information there are loads of websites offering free advice, templates and examples of good and bad CV's
Ld1vLH8Kaa	I'll let others tell you the cv stuff. I'll tell you the interview technique side.<br>  First, always find out in advance where to go for the interview to save last minute panic. And, before you go, research who the company are and what they do.<br>  For the interview pay attention to how you dress. Make sure it's as smart as you can be. In the interview, try to maintain eye contact and look 'alert' at all times. Answer the question and if you don't understand something, tell them. Do NOT ask about holidays or pay. You should know the salary already. Take along any certificates you have. That looks professional. Think of a question to ask them It shows you are interested in the job. <br>  The MAIN thing is to look enthusiastic. Believe me, that is where so many fail. <br>   And why not take your CV to the employment agencies in your town? They will be able to find you something.<br>  Good look in the job hunting.|`|AA11220909	If I worked in a shop and someone handed me a CV with a Personal Profile on I would put it straight in the rubbish bin UNREAD.<br>  <br>  CVs must ONLY contain your Education and previous employment (if any).|`|QUxw60itaa	Try googling for CV or resume examples
Aw1Ulzr5aa	A speculation business means any business in which a contract for the purchase and sale of any commodity including stock and shares are periodically or ultimately settled otherwise than by the actual delivery or transfer of the commodity.<br>  <br>   But does not include a business in which a contract in respect of raw materials or merchandise is entered into by a person in the course of a manufacturing or mercantile business to guard against loss through future price fluctuations for the purposes of fulfilling the person's other contracts for the actual delivery of the goods to be manufactured or merchandise to be sold.

This "certified' list will be given to various department heads so that any graduate student seeking your services can easily contact you directly from this list.<br>  <br>  An average weekend income is about $300-$400 for two days of work.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|wCUuNLsEaa	There aren't any.

E1ztfbg8aa	<a href="http://goodsurveysites.com" rel="nofollow">http://goodsurveysites.com</a> Its what I do and it's worked out pretty well. What you have to do is complete surveys and offers for companies that want the public's opinion. No payment from you is ever required, not to sign up, not EVER.<br>  <br>  The sites don't get paid directly from you, but when you complete an offer or survey, they also get paid a small portion of what you earned yourself. For example, if you complete a survey about computers let's say, you would earn maybe $2 and the web site itself would recieve $0.50 from the company also for getting you to complete the survey. These surveys take little time at all, most taking up less than even 1 or 2 minutes of your time.<br>  <br>  They don’t need any information other than your name, email address and your home address. Yup, that is all. No credit card information, no banking information, nothing like that. All they require is your name and address so that your cheque can be sent to your home every month.<br>  <br>  Personally I have been a member of these websites, along with thousands of other satisfied users, for approximately 1.5 years now and have earned well over $8600 by working in my spare time.

Of course they wouldn't be negative and said that you were bad-not saying you were-but you know.<br>  <br>  I really don't think you need degrees and all just for an administrative job, if that was what you were going for-but it is always hard finding any job.<br>  <br>  A lot of the time, it's really about the people you know.

Networking/talking to others and strongly expressing that you need a job is an easy way to get started.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't bother with a job agency-they keep most of the money and you are left with a smaller amount to take home.<br>  You need to answer every ad you can and keep going!|`|2xO8AxYRaa	Some companies do not keep applications on file.

The interview board never say you are a bad applicant.    I know in your position, you will get mad when you dont get it.  But the company look for their benefit.

v8b1psohaa	E-commerce is the pre-eminent buzzword of the online business revolution. It captures the excitement and focus of this fast emerging market. But it is more than a slogan or glib party line. At its core it embodies a concept for doing business online.<br>  <br>  Electronic commerce is the paperless exchange of business information using electronic data interchange (EDI), e-mail, electronic bulletin boards, fax transmissions, and electronic funds transfer. It refers to Internet shopping, online stock and bond transactions, the downloading and selling of “soft merchandise” (software, documents, graphics, music, etc.), and business-to-business transactions.<br>  <br>  The concept of e-commerce is all about using the Internet to do business better and faster. It is about giving customers controlled access to your computer systems and letting people serve themselves. It is about committing your company to a serious online effort and integrating your Web site with the heart of your business. If you do that, you will see results!<br>  <br>  The Internet’s role in business can be compared to that of the telephone. It is a way for people to communicate with each other. It is also a way for a consumer to communicate with a company’s computer systems without human intervention. In fact, the Internet is a communication medium like the many others we use in business every day.<br>  <br>  Think of the ways you communicate with people in business. The best way is face to face. Body language, tone of voice, and facial expressions all help you understand what the other person is trying to say. When you cannot meet face to face, you may use any of a number of different means to communicate: a telephone, a fax machine, Federal Express, the U.S. Postal Service, or maybe even a messenger service. These are all ways to deliver or receive information, authorization, even shipments of goods and merchandise.<br>  <br>  The Internet is a reasonable alternative to all of those means of communication. Any place and any way that your business communicates with its customers, you should think about how you could have done it online. That is the power of e-commerce.<br>  <br>  Can’t meet face to face? Send an e-mail with an attached photograph. When it comes time to pay for merchandise, use a secured server to pay by credit card, or even digital cash! The opportunities and situations in which online business is possible are limitless.
oFiGyMWraa	The executor needs to identify the entire estate, value it and submit a return to HMRC with a calculation of any inheritance tax (IHT). If any IHT is due it needs to be paid (or in certain circumstances a payment plan agreed) before probate can be granted. Only after probate is granted can the executor actually start distributing the property.<br>  <br>  The early steps can take some time, especially if the estate is valuable but does not have enough cash to pay the IHT. In this case the executor needs to arrange a loan against the estate to pay the IHT, and once probate is granted they need to sell enough assets to pay off the loan.<br>  <br>  The same applies to other debts of the estate, such as mortgages, loans etc. If there is not enough cash to settle these the executors need to sell assets to raise funds.<br>  <br>  This can take many months and only when it is done can anything be handed out to beneficiaries. Even then shares can take some time to formally transfer - depending on what sort of company the shares are in.<br>  <br>  If the executor is a solicitor they will charge by the hour for all the work they do, which might amount to quite a lot. The amount will not specifically relate to the value of the estate, although higher value estates are probably more complex so will take more work.<br>  <br>  If your father named his solicitor as an executor you have no choice but to let him get on with it. If he didn't and someone else is doing it then you don't need to involve a solicitor at all. However, you may consult a solicitor for specific advice, but you can save money by doing as much of the work yourself (ie whoever is executor).|`|4ZzLtY9Saa	it just depends can take weeks, months or up 2 a year <br>  <br>  But if it is ￡312,000 or over it will be taxed <br>  <br>  have a look about inheritance at:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/MoneyTaxAndBenefits/Taxes/InheritanceTaxEstatesAndTrusts/index.htm?cids=Google_PPC&cre=Money" rel="nofollow">http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/MoneyTaxAndB...</a>|`|ZNI3LmBRaa	sorting out probate is an extremely long and administrative process, it can take between 6-12 months to get it all in order, even by a solicitor.  Often the charges that the solicitor gives you will be dependant on the value of the estate and their hourly rate.

9FxR4khCaa	Only your employer can give you this answer. But it sounds as if you may be looking at a COBRA extension after your PTO runs out. If that is the case, you will be looking at paying the full premium price (what you pay AND what your employer contributes PLUS up to a 2% administrative fee). Once you reach the stage where your PTO runs out, your employer has 30 days to notify the carrier, then they have 14 days to get the paperwork to you. Then you will have 60 days to accept or decline the coverage. You must pay for all months of coverage back to the first month you were eligible for COBRA until you no longer want or need the coverage. There will not be a break in coverage if you accept it and pay all the premiums, but it will take some time to "catch up" on the Administrative time.|`|WwAV7TL0aa	make use of the SE like google or yahoo to get some ideas first if you want to get the massive information,however if you do not want to spend so much time,here <a href="http://www.HealthInsuranceIdeas.info/free-online-health-insurance.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.HealthInsuranceIdeas.info/fre...</a>  is a direct and good resource for your questions.

This usually means that if the property is sold within a given number of years a percentage of the grant has to be repaid - usually on a sliding scale.

You normally have this option at graduation as it make no sense to have multiple payments. If he goes through Direct Loans, they will do it. Remember, they want to get paid.<br>  <br>  Chapter 7 personal bankruptcy has very specific requirements. First he must complete 6 months of credit counseling prior to filing. His disposable income, the money left over after his bills are paid, must be under the mean for the state for his income level. All tax returns must be up to date and submitted.  Also, student loan are not eligible as a discharge so this is not feasible.<br>  <br>  Chapter 13 is a plan where the debtor assumes responsibility to repay part of the debt over time. When income is evaluated there has to be enough money to cover the payment arrangments with the creditors.<br>  <br>  Your friend has a situation where if the loans were consolidated an arrangement could be made to make it more affordable. That is what will be expected prior to filing a bankruptcy. If your friend is not working  he can request forbearance. Forbearance allows him to not make payments during his time of unemployment, however, interest continues to accrue. <br>  <br>  There you go, a few options. Good luck.

9Wi2eNInaa	Explain the difference between fixed expenses and discretionary spending? Provide at least three examples of each.<br>  -- Fixed expenses are expenses you have every month and can not elect to not pay for the most part. Examples are rent, mortgage payment, basic groceries, water bill, trash service, credit card bill. Discretionary spending is spending you can elect to or not spend, like a cable bill, going to McDonald's, Local restaurants, health club membership<br>  <br>  Explain the difference between a voluntary income deduction and an involuntary income deduction. Provide at least two examples of each.<br>  --- voluntary income deduction is deductions on your paycheck you can have or not, like 401k deduction, health care spending account, life insurance. Involuntary income deduction is deductions you can't change or are mandated, like Social security tax, city tax, federal tax<br>  <br>  Describe what "living within your means" means. If you're not currently living within your means, what are two ways of starting to do so?<br>  --- This means your monthly income has to be more than your monthly spending. If your monthly income drops more than your spending for the month you have to cut your discretionary spending, or increase your income by working another job. You can also decrease some of your fixed expenses, like getting a cheaper apartment, and cutting back on your utilities too.<br>  <br>  List three ways of increasing your savings.<br>  --- 1)Use your 401k at work and up the percentage of savings if you can  2) Open an IRA. 3) cut your discretionary spending by a set amount (say 20%) and put that money into a spending account. 4) Take another part time job and tell yourself you are going to put all that income into a savings account<br>  <br>  If your take-home pay is $24,000 a year, what is the maximum amount per month that lenders want you to spend on your housing expense?<br>  --- Typically lenders will allow you to spend up to 28% of your gross income for housing, so .28 x $24000 = $6720 a year or $560 a month<br>  <br>  Name three items that are necessities and three items that are luxuries.<br>  --- necessities-- Prescriptions, groceries, clothing, shelter<br>  --- luxuries-- cars, recreational drugs, designer clothes, vacations<br>  <br>  What is the difference between What is the difference between secured debt and unsecured debt? <br>  -- Secured debt is borrowing money against an asset, like if you don't pay on your 1) house they can take it and your 2) car they can take if you don't pay on it.<br>  -- Unsecured debt is borrowing money with no asset to back it up, like a 1) credit card. You can spend the money now and the only security the credit card company has is to take you to court to get their money back if you don't pay it.  2) Utilities, you can use natural gas for the month or more and the utility has no collateral from you for that gas usage. They can cut off your gas eventually and take you to court for payment.<br>  <br>   What's the difference between a charge card, a credit card, and a debit card?<br>  -- charge card-- Usually a specific credit card to one company that can only be used at that company, like JC Penny, Sears, Old Navy<br>  Credit card - a universal "charge card" you can use the card for credit at almost all establishments that give credit<br>  -- debit card, Kind of like a secured credit card because the card is backed by your savings account. If you have a $1000 in your savings or have it guaranteed by your bank you can debit your card up to that amount <br>  <br>  When you pay off an outstanding balance on a credit card, should you close the account? Why or why not?<br>  -- According to FICO (credit score agency), Having a longer credit history is favorable because it gives more information about your spending habits. It’s good to leave open the accounts that you’ve had for a long time. <br>  <br>  What is the most significant component of your credit score? What percentage does it add to your total credit score?<br>  <br>  What Your Credit Score Is Made Of:<br>  -- Payment history is 35%<br>  -- Debt level is 30%<br>  -- Length of credit history 15%<br>  -- Inquiries are 10%<br>  -- Mix of credit types is 10%|`|AA11173563	do your own home work please!!!!!!!!|`|AA11258464	Read the textbook and do your own homework

But AIG is virtually bankrupt, more than virtually.|`|mpfqoLCVaa	Buying financial products is classed as 'saving', as opposed to investment. The distinction is (in theory) clear: if money is converted into goods or services, it is investment; but, if you buy a bond or a share of stock, this transfer payment is excluded from the GDP sum. That is because the stocks and bonds affect the financial capital which in turn affects the production and sales which in turn affects the investments. So stocks and bonds indirectly affect the GDP.<br>  <br>  In times we are going through, we should think of helping the nation overcome Recession. That is only possible when more and savings and funds are diverted towards investments leading to generation of employment opportunities which would mean more factor income which would mean more demand for goods and services.|`|NrvrH4zQaa	There are two possibilities that the stock price goes up - slim and none.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't go anywhere near AIG.

Business Cards -- You can get free business cards printed at VistaPrint.com. <br>  2. Frequent Flyers -- Have flyers printed up, and put them every unconviental place you can think of (i.e. newspaper vending machines, magazines in doctors' offices, etc.)<br>  3. Find an old, stained article of clothing, clean half of it, and do your best to restore it, and place it in the front window of your shop with a sign that reads..."If you think THIS is amazing, you should see what I can do on YOUR clothing!" <br>  4. Raffle Drawings -- I know a lot of people shy away from these, but trust me, they do work! Especially if you have a GREAT item on raffle! <br>  5. Birthday Cards / Thinking of You Cards -- If you have access to customers' addresses, send birthday cards to customers with up-coming birthdays. Send Thinking of You Cards to customers who haven't been in in awhile. <br>  6. Ink Pens -- Although it can be one of the more expensive ideas listed, pensexpress.com has some really great quality pens for a low cost. And you can even have a little message like, "If this pens leaks on your shirt, I'll clean it for free!" or something to that effect printed on it. <br>  7. Coloring Pages -- you can run a search online for coloring pages, copy-and-paste them onto a word doc with your coupons on it, have them printed up, and talk to local restuarants about having them on hand for customers with kids. Keeps the kids entertained, and mom gets a coupon. <br>  <br>  <br>  Hope these ideas help!

This practice is illegal under the FDCPA, but is used by some junk debt collection agencies, some of who have been fined by the FTC.<br>  <br>  IN the UK, all I know is that if you acknowledge the debt within a 6 year time period, it can be renewed for collections.

Also there is no guarantee that any of them have the funds to be purchasing new homes right now.|`|w29tsXLUaa	You do realise they will offer the lowest price they can don't you?<br>  <br>  Just look in the telephone Directory for Housing Associations for a telephone number.|`|ARAYm7BLaa	approach a housing Association and ask them, however many have no funds for this sort of purchase as it's cheaper for them to build new homes.|`|ej9ijnS7aa	Is the Housing Assn. interested in buying the property?

Quit smoking.|`|BJugETlOaa	OMG! in Kansas they are about to raise the tax, at the moment they run around 3.50 to 5.00 they are suppose to be raised about 1.50.

However, unless you're near a border of a state with cheaper cigarette taxes, it'll probably cost you more in gas to get a cheaper fix than you'd save in taxes.  <br>  <br>  And I wouldn't suggest trying mailorder: even if a company doesn't have to collect sales tax if they don't have a presence in your state, you still legally owe a "use tax" in nearly all states.  Hardly anyone actually pays use tax, since it's very difficult to enforce and so rarely is enforced, but states are tending to target cigarette mailorder for this purpose; there have been some rather high profile cases where somone ordered smokes by mail and later got a bill from the state for the owed use taxes and penalty fees.<br>  <br>  Why?  Because the states are desperate for money, and smokers are unpopular, so are good targets.  A secondary reason is in hopes that smokers will be motivated to quit, and thus be less of a drain in healthcare, etc., but the main motivation is "more income", just like for any politicians.|`|tpaoUt5Xaa	ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!!

AA11284831	You cannot file as Head of Household because you lived with your spouse after June 30th and were not divorced as of Dec 31st.  "Almost" the last half of the year won't cut it for HoH filing status and the IRS appears to be getting much more proactive on these issues.  I've got 2 clients with returns under review who filed jointly last year but HoH and MFS this year.  They split before June 30th (and can prove it) so they'll pass muster in the end, but the IRS is watching this much more closely than in the past.<br>  <br>  Your only options for 2008 are Married Filing Jointly or Married Filing Separately.  If you file MFS you will NOT be eligible for the EIC or Child Care Credits.<br>  <br>  Edit:  The IRS will ask for whatever you can provide for proof, such as copies of leases or HUD-1 closing statements on the purchase of a home, etc.  My clients had leases signed before June 30th so they will be good to go.|`|AA11555162	Your only choices are married joint or separate. Separate is the highest tax bracket and eic is not allowed. You have to be separated for more than 6 months to claim hoh. If you are audited you would need proof of being separated for more than 6 months.|`|275a76c3021b903d93c9b6d665b05088aa	I believe you have to file married filing seperate, I am not sure call the IRA toll line in your 1040 book and they can tell you.|`|AA10469473	As the old saying goes, "almost" only counts in horseshoes.  You can't file as head of household - "almost" 6 months isn't long enough.  You'd file as married filing separately since you weren't divorced by 12/31.
cz5XbKfOaa	Yes you will be eligible. You will need to get a letter from him stating you are responsible for paying the bills and explain why they are in his name.

EXJfoGtAaa	Sounds like you sold the property with the buyer assuming the mortgage.  Mortgages aren't assumable with the exception of FHA/VA.  You are still on the mortgage and liable.  There was a second error committed.  Mortgages contain a due on sale clause.  When property changes ownership the mortgagee can call the loan due.  The person in title can loose the home and you could have a deficiency judgment filed against you.<br>  <br>  realtor.sailor|`|ikXRqWxUaa	you should have consulted a lawyer and your mortgage company before you did anything like this.  now, you do not own the home as you are not on the title, but you are100 percent responsible for the loan.  do you think that your trustee not rolling over the loan was an accident?  don't think so!  <br>  <br>  most mortgage companies do not allow you to simply roll your mortgage over anyways as they are most of the time not assumable.  they would have called it due had they found out.  remember, the mortgage company signed an agreement with you.  you signed the title over without their knowledge, which is worse because they have a lien on the title.  <br>  <br>  you are in big trouble here and you need to talk to someone right now.|`|4UBxVIYFaa	You made a very silly error in signing over the deed to another person without simultaneously requiring that financing be changed into that person's name.  If you still are the signatory to the mortgage, you are still financially responsible for it.  <br>  <br>  I am guessing you did this 'sale' without proper legal guidance.  If that be the case, you will pay a heavy price for doing so.|`|23SkYEw5aa	duh.  You still owe the LOAN!!!!!!!!!   Just because you deeded the property doesn't mean that you transferred the loan.  In fact, most loans don't even allow this.<br>  <br>  There is more to this story.  Care to explain???|`|49740c9daeea677fc86801fb2b3f41deaa	This has nothing to do with the housing market.<br>  <br>  You can not legally sell your property without paying off the liens.  Period.<br>  <br>  You gave up rights to the property, but not to the loan.<br>  <br>  You will need to get this into the court, suing for the deed to be returned to you.   <br>  <br>  This is something you need legal advise for, not anything we can give you.   Your orginal transaction was not legal, but it fell on YOU to take care of the lien, not the buyer.    You could just as easily be guilty of fraud (you kept the money, did not pay the lien) as the buyer.

AA10464818	1. Define your business first. What do you want to do? Make a list of possible businesses you can develop and write the pros and cons of each.  Clarify your business model.<br>  <br>  2. Check the feasibility of the business idea. Is it workable? Given your resources, do you think there's a chance?<br>  <br>  3. Once you've determined exactly what business to start, research about the business -- how much will it take you to start the business, what do you need, who are doing it, who is your target market, how are you going to reach your market. This is your business plan. It is best to put it in writing, especially if you will be seeking loans or investors as they will require a business plan<br>  <br>  4. Find out how much the business will cost and where you can get the money. If your resources are not enough, where will you get money? Can you get money elsewhere? If you really cannot raise the funds you need, are you willing to downscale the idea?<br>  <br>  5. Decide if this is a business that can be done alone by you, or whether you will need a partner or you will hire employees. Aside from you, who else will be involved in the business?<br>  <br>  6. Once you find out that you can really raise the capital you need and the personnel requirements, setup your business. Decide if you want to be a sole proprietor, partnership, LLC, S or C corporation.<br>  <br>  7. Go to your local county to find out the steps for business registration, assumed name or DBA, and whether the business will require a license or not. Or check the Web for information on starting a business in your state, specifically from your state or local government websites. Then complete all legal and regulatory requirements.<br>  <br>  8. Start the process of setting up the business. If this is a website, then start thinking of its contents, who will design the site, who will manage the site. If this is a restaurant, start looking for location. If this is a recipe book, start contacting agents and publishers or look into the option of self publishing.<br>  <br>  9. Set up your office, whether at home or if you will lease an office space. Purchase the equipment you need.<br>  <br>  10. Start developing your marketing materials such as business cards, brochures, flyers.<br>  <br>  You may also want to check the following books:<br>  <br>  - What No One Ever Tells You About Starting Your Own Business: Real Life Start-Up Advice from 101 Successful Entrepreneurs  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1574101129/ref=nosim/powerhomebizguid" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1...</a> <br>  - If You're Clueless About Starting Your Own Business and Want to Know More  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1574100939/ref=nosim/powerhomebizguid" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1...</a> <br>  - Start Your Own Business : The Only Start-Up Book You'll Ever Need  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1891984217/ref=nosim/powerhomebizguid" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1...</a> <br>  - Steps to Small Business Start-Up : Everything You Need to Know to Turn Your Idea into a Successful Business <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1574101323/ref=nosim/powerhomebizguid" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1...</a><br>  <br>  It may help you if you could talk with a small business expert or free mentors to give you ideas on how to make your dream of starting a business come true.

I was fortunate as my dream just happened to be a business that was needed in my area.<br>  Too many people's dream business in one that is not needed in your area, and or one that is not suited to your area.<br>  I am not discouraging you, just trying to help.<br>  Remember starting a business takes money. Money to get the business up and running and money to pay yourself until it starts turning a profit - usually 2 years or more.<br>  #1. Spreadsheets are great for this one. Do an analysis of your competition. Visit their store or make a check of their operations. Are they lacking in product,presentation? Are their prices competitive? <br>  Perception of what customers want is something you either have or you must learn. My first business was starting a construction company. I had 8 yrs experience as a carpenter. I did not need to buy a lot of inventory, just the materials needed for each job. This was ideal for me as I did not borrow any money to start this company. My office was in my garage for 5 yrs. <br>  I noticed that when I needed to purchase tools, ladders,etc., there was not much selection in my area. This was in 1985, there were no Lowe's,Home Depot at that time. So, in 1985 - 8 yrs after starting by contracting business I started another company. Yes, a tool and supply business geared toward contractors,maintenance departments,etc. It took what little competition there was out there 3-4 yrs to even notice my new store - they were not paying any attention to me. We started building a good solid customer base, a little at a time. 24 yrs later - we now dominate the contractor trade in our area. The other guys went to sleep on their watch and we blew right by them.<br>  We stock what they need because I (as a contractor) know exactly what they need because I need it also.<br>  The above information is the most valuable info I can give you.<br>  You need to sit down with a good small accountant and discuss how to calculate the cost of doing business, your salary, overhead,profit,etc.<br>  Many business survive today by accident. By a stroke of luck they just happened to find an under-served area that needed their business. But this won't keep them in business. Knowing what your customers want and need is vital, even more important than the price. Many people will pay more than the average price for a service or a product if they like the way you do business. Now I don't mean you can double your prices, but you can survive even against the large stores or companies if you run your business like a business.<br>  Logic is your biggest advantage over the big guys, and flexibility. The large stores are all controlled by a corporate office. It would take them 1 month to decide and implement the introduction of a new product. It takes my tool store 1 day. Here is a good dose of logic. Many contractors have tools, equipment,materials in the back of their trucks when they pull into our parking lot. At our store you park right in front of the store. At the big box stores you park in a large parking lot which is open to all kind of theft. All of our products are packed in this 5,000 sq. foot building. The big stores have their stuff spread out over 50,000 sq. feet. mixed in with stuff the contractors don't even need or want.<br>  You can be in and out of our store in 15 minutes. At the big stores it takes you that long to get in the store.<br>  Convienience is a great thing. <br>  So do some logical thinking about this business you want to start. Be smart about the finances you will need. Be practical,ambitious,energetic and focus on a business that works for you.<br>  Good Luck|`|2HU0CZNEaa	Hey There!<br>  <br>  I actually discovered this website that teaches you how to make money online.

Though the growth was slow, but it accelerated from the year 1987 when non-UTI players entered the industry.<br>  <br>  In the past decade, Indian mutual fund industry had seen a dramatic imporvements, both qualitywise as well as quantitywise. Before, the monopoly of the market had seen an ending phase, the Assets Under Management (AUM) was Rs. 67bn. The private sector entry to the fund family rose the AUM to Rs. 470 bn in March 1993 and till April 2004, it reached the height of 1,540 bn.<br>  <br>  Putting the AUM of the Indian Mutual Funds Industry into comparison, the total of it is less than the deposits of SBI alone, constitute less than 11% of the total deposits held by the Indian banking industry.<br>  <br>  The main reason of its poor growth is that the mutual fund industry in India is new in the country. Large sections of Indian investors are yet to be intellectuated with the concept. Hence, it is the prime responsibility of all mutual fund companies, to market the product correctly abreast of selling.<br>  <br>  The mutual fund industry can be broadly put into four phases according to the development of the sector. Each phase is briefly described as under.<br>  <br>  First Phase - 1964-87<br>  <br>  Unit Trust of India (UTI) was established on 1963 by an Act of Parliament. It was set up by the Reserve Bank of India and functioned under the Regulatory and administrative control of the Reserve Bank of India. In 1978 UTI was de-linked from the RBI and the Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI) took over the regulatory and administrative control in place of RBI. The first scheme launched by UTI was Unit Scheme 1964. At the end of 1988 UTI had Rs.6,700 crores of assets under management. <br>  <br>  Second Phase - 1987-1993 (Entry of Public Sector Funds)<br>  <br>  Entry of non-UTI mutual funds. SBI Mutual Fund was the first followed by Canbank Mutual Fund (Dec 87), Punjab National Bank Mutual Fund (Aug 89), Indian Bank Mutual Fund (Nov 89), Bank of India (Jun 90), Bank of Baroda Mutual Fund (Oct 92). LIC in 1989 and GIC in 1990. The end of 1993 marked Rs.47,004 as assets under management.<br>  <br>  Third Phase - 1993-2003 (Entry of Private Sector Funds)<br>  <br>  With the entry of private sector funds in 1993, a new era started in the Indian mutual fund industry, giving the Indian investors a wider choice of fund families. Also, 1993 was the year in which the first Mutual Fund Regulations came into being, under which all mutual funds, except UTI were to be registered and governed. The erstwhile Kothari Pioneer (now merged with Franklin Templeton) was the first private sector mutual fund registered in July 1993.<br>  <br>  The 1993 SEBI (Mutual Fund) Regulations were substituted by a more comprehensive and revised Mutual Fund Regulations in 1996. The industry now functions under the SEBI (Mutual Fund) Regulations 1996.<br>  <br>  The number of mutual fund houses went on increasing, with many foreign mutual funds setting up funds in India and also the industry has witnessed several mergers and acquisitions. As at the end of January 2003, there were 33 mutual funds with total assets of Rs. 1,21,805 crores. The Unit Trust of India with Rs.44,541 crores of assets under management was way ahead of other mutual funds. <br>  <br>  Fourth Phase - since February 2003<br>  <br>  This phase had bitter experience for UTI. It was bifurcated into two separate entities. One is the Specified Undertaking of the Unit Trust of India with AUM of Rs.29,835 crores (as on January 2003). The Specified Undertaking of Unit Trust of India, functioning under an administrator and under the rules framed by Government of India and does not come under the purview of the Mutual Fund Regulations.<br>  <br>  The second is the UTI Mutual Fund Ltd, sponsored by SBI, PNB, BOB and LIC. It is registered with SEBI and functions under the Mutual Fund Regulations. With the bifurcation of the erstwhile UTI which had in March 2000 more than Rs.76,000 crores of AUM and with the setting up of a UTI Mutual Fund, conforming to the SEBI Mutual Fund Regulations, and with recent mergers taking place among different private sector funds, the mutual fund industry has entered its current phase of consolidation and growth. As at the end of September, 2004, there were 29 funds, which manage assets of Rs.153108 crores under 421 schemes.

Even though it does not appear on your regular credit history after seven years, if you apply for a loan in the future the application will ask "Have you ever filed for bankruptcy?" and you must answer "Yes" for the rest of your life.|`|Kwywmcs8aa	No. Unless you payed them off with a credit card they don't come off with any bankruptcy|`|bfe4ad38e28ddda61b321173866c1f9aaa	Not your Federal student loans and maybe not even any private ones.

Bux3LMmDaa	LENDING  normally money for unstated purpose against the security with out going through pros & cones of activity (Example ; Betting, Gambling etc.) money is spent on. This gives fixed return either in cash or in the term mortgaged movable or non movable property/properties .  <br>  <br>  FINANCING  is joining in the profitable operation (like Commercial vehicle purchase,acquiring business operation etc )  for the acquirer with proper verification / validation of  data submitted by seeker. in short the financier become the indirect partner in that venture with fixed unguaranteed returns.<br>  <br>  Lending is comparatively more secure than financing.|`|rQObX6uEaa	Generally the market uses the two terms for any loan, however if you want to differentiate the two then : <br>  Lets deal with lending first. A bank or even your neighbour can lend you money. You may or may not have to put up collateral to secure the loan. Say you borrow $100 from your mate and promise to repay the $100 in 2 weeks time. He may ask you to give him something of similar value that he can "hold" until you repay him, this is collateral. He is not interested in why you want the $100. He just wants his money back in 2 weeks or he will sell your collateral and recover his $100 loan to you.<br>  <br>  In financing, you buy a specific item usually with a specific interst rate over usually a specific time frame. The best example here may be a car or house or similar asset. If you default (miss payments) before the end of the payment period, the person / bank that financed your specific asset can (within reason) take away the specific asset that you financed and sell it to recover his / their debt.<br>  <br>  So in a nutshell, financing (often called asset based financing) is the funding for a specific item and lending is generally non specific i.e. simply a loan

cc45a7835eae87c6f861540fd8f4521daa	Keep proof of payment and of the arrangement they offered you.  You can choose to pay it, and you will have proof of satisfaction of the debt should they ever contact you again.  HOWEVER, you should be aware that with a debt this old, it's not really going to help your credit to pay it.  Creditors look primarily at you most recent credit history, and if this is the only thing you have on it in the last 5 years, just leave it alone.  In another 2 years, it will be too old to be reported on your credit report anyway.<br>  If you tell them to stop contacting you, they have to.  You must follow up in writing, but they can't keep calling you once you ask them to stop.  If they do continue, they're in violation of the law.  It's a good idea to get a return receipt on the letter when you send it so you have proof both that you sent it and that they received it.|`|NADlb5Ffaa	I'm from Louisiana as well.

oVxr5B3Eaa	Yes, they do exist, but you have to put in quite a bit of time to them and usually sign up for multiple sites. <br>  I do them when I'm bored, and I use surveyspot.com. After about 5 surveys (maybe 1.5 hours) i had worked up 22 dollars. I wasn't sure if it was going to work or not so I requested the check before I put in any more time.. It DID take about 10 weeks to get but I got the cheque (5 weeks for it to be added to my account and the rest to mail it) and cashed it and have since spent the cash. I have about 55 dollars sitting in my account right now. <br>  <br>  The thing is that many of them don't have many pay surveys available, so you have to check back often to find surveys your are eligible for. <br>  <br>  If any of them ask you to pay any kind of membership fee, or give credit card numbers, or ask for any kind of money from you up front, they're a scam. Look for ones that will mail you a check without you giving them any info other than basic name address phone number etc. <br>  <br>  I know there are others out there, likely better ones, but I haven't tried any others..

I've done both kinds, and made money at both, and it's really true that you don't need to pay money or give out your credit card information. It's all free and all profit.<br>  <br>  There are surveys where companies pay you for your opinion as a consumer, and they use the information in developing products and advertising campaigns. Let's call those research surveys. You'll get paid maybe only an entry into a sweepstakes, or a dollar or two, or more if you're chosen for longer more detailed surveys. Signing up with the research survey companies is always free--never pay anything! You won't get any spam or advertising from legitimate companies, but the bad news is that you may not qualify for many surveys, depending on what kind of people they're looking for. You also may not get many surveys a month from any one company, one or two maybe. A dozen would be a lot, and you won't necessarily qualify for all of those. So a lot of people sign up for as many legitimate ones as they can find, 20 or 30 or more, in order to get a survey every day or so.<br>  <br>  A good place to find these sites and to check out reviews and find out their reputation for honesty is <a href="http://www.surveypolice.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.surveypolice.com</a><br>  <br>  Then there's another way to make money online from something called "surveys," that aren't really surveys. You can do these "surveys" by signing up at "get paid to" or  GPT sites. These are sites that, basically, find companies that will pay you to look at ads and sign up for spam, and the GPT site splits the payment with you. It's not as bad as it sounds, really! They'll pay in the range of 25 cents to a dollar for each "survey" you complete and the trick to avoiding the spam is to sign up with a free email address and have all the spam directed there, so you never need to look at it.<br>  <br>  Again, don't pay anything! You can do all this for free. The GPT sites have a variety of offers or surveys, and some require a credit card to sign up for a product or a free trial. But you can generally sort the offers to include only the ones that are 100% free, and there are dozens or hundreds of free offers, so you can make money doing only them.<br>  <br>  GPT Sites will usually also have one or two "daily surveys," which are, in fact, just like the research surveys mentioned above, and they'll pay a dollar or so if you quality that day.<br>  <br>  A good site to check out the honesty and reputation of these GPT sites is <a href="http://www.gptboycott.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.gptboycott.com</a><br>  <br>  If you're interested in either kind of online surveys, here's a trick.<br>  <br>  It's not only free to sign up for the research survey companies, but you can actually make a little money just by signing up. Here's how.<br>  <br>  Pick out what research survey companies you'd like to join, maybe using the Survey Police site to help you decide. Then sign up for free at a GPT site like DealBarbiePays <a href="http://dealbarbiepays.com/members/register.php?ref=eexxtra" rel="nofollow">http://dealbarbiepays.com/members/regist...</a> and search for the names of the research survey companies you're interested in. Often, the GPT site will pay you around fifty cents if you sign up with the research company through their link!

He will be unable to make further calls on your account.<br>  This doesn't stop you from having to pay for the phone, but at least there are no surprise charges from his phone, and you can give it to a sibling, parent or friend you trust if they're needing a phone.  If you don't have someone like that, you can usually still drop features (like text messaging, data packages, etc) without having to renew your contract.  Strip it down to the bare bones of the plan so it's not costing you extra for services you aren't using.<br>  Also, you should check because depending on what state you're living in, they may not be able to hold you to early termination fees or whatever, because a few states ruled in class action lawsuits that those fees are unreasonable and illegal.  If you still have 2 full years left on your contract, it may be soon enough to just give back his phone and cancel his portion of the account, since you're still in the first 30 days of the contract (depending on your service provider).|`|41d1704b78aa7a5d83a94c5a7fe98158aa	you cant your stuck with that contract unless you pay off the contract|`|7uIOhkyiaa	I don't know who your carrier is but some of them you can put a hold on a certain number and it's not usable.

You can e-mail friends a thoughtful "letter" and ask them to forward it to their friends, etc.  It will get passed around fast, and the plus is that they are friends of friends.  You want good people!  What about an ad in a local paper?  I am thinking that advertisements anywhere/everywhere will get things moving for you.  Oh, I thought of another.  When there is a function at our church, people "buy space" in the booklet that is at everyone's table.  Look to advertise in places like that, or even a school advertisement booklet.

Give them some good information that will excite them, make them laugh, provide controversy, SOMETHING that is different from all the other stuff that is out there.  Give them a reason to actually consider working with Amway.  Something they can't get from anywhere else...<br>  <br>  Now, if you are wanting to sell product, I would pick one or two items and use them EVERYWHERE you go.  Pick the items that will be the most useful in your area.  Use those products in the typical way, and use them in ways that nobody would ever expect you to use them!<br>  <br>  Good luck to you!

But who knows what tomorrow will bring.|`|MjkDTovqaa	Like Trump, Kwek is out to prove himself a world-class deal-maker. He is, in fact, the head of what is probably the richest family in Singapore, with assets of more than $4 billion, most in the form of Hong Leong Group, a collection of family-controlled, public and private companies. Kwek, 54, is filling the shoes of his late father, Kwek Hong Png, who ....... "If I do not seize the opportunity to create a global enterprise, then I have not learned and graduated from my father."     Kwek delights in playing the mysterious stranger who swoops into town laden with megabucks to make lightning deals.  "When the market hits rock bottom and nobody dares to buy, I come in." Beginning in 1992 he acquired the Gloucester and two other top hotels in London that owners were eager to unload.     Kwek reached Manhattan two years ago, and unlike many tourists, he did not find it too expensive. He bought the Hotel Millenium, near the World Trade Center, out of bankruptcy for $75 million--it cost developer Peter Kalikow more than $150 million to build. He then cherry-picked the midtown Hotel Macklowe, (now the Millennium Broadway). He now owns more than 50 inns--ranking him among the world's top ten hoteliers.         By the time the market hits rock bottom it WILL be too late.  If you have cash, or a job thats VERY stable..

InSi6vUTaa	Following are some of the little things you should pay particularly close attention to during an interview:<br>  <br>  (1) Show confidence - You cannot enter into an interview with a defeatist attitude. You cannot mope or exude too much placidity in your manner. It is not inviting, and does not give the impression of a person that you want to face every day. Be sure of your abilities without appearing cocky or narcissistic. You want to let you interviewer know that you are equipped to perform well at your job, without alienating other workers. You should point out your accomplishments in your field while remaining somewhat humble. List your accomplishments in a matter of fact way without going into too much detail. Sit straight. Practice good posture, and keep your head up.<br>  <br>  (2) Keep a positive attitude - Smile and keep a positive outlook during your interview. If you are hearing something that doesn't sound good to you, don't frown and look disgruntled, just keep a slight smile on your face until it is time for you to say something. Then approach your interviewer with your questions or concerns when the time is appropriate.<br>  <br>  (3) Maintain eye contact - Maintaining eye contact with your interviewer is very important, especially when one of you is speaking to the other. If you are looking around the room or at the items on the interviewer's desk, you will appear uninterested. Just imagine what you would be thinking if you were speaking to him and he was looking all over the room. You would probably think that you already lost the interview.<br>  <br>  (4) Watch your body language - Avoid fidgeting while speaking to your interviewer. It shows a lack of self confidence. Avoid speaking while using overly expressive hand gestures. It is distracting. Avoid biting your lips in between sentences. It gives the impression that you are making things up. Do not sit with your arms crossed because it makes you appear stand-offish. Do not shrug your shoulders when asked a question that you are unsure of. Take a second to think of your response. Shrugging your shoulders gives the impression that you don't know the answer. Don't answer with nods and head shakes. Use your words to answer questions. Get plenty of sleep the night before the interview. You don't want to yawn in front of the interviewer. He will think that you are expressing boredom.<br>  <br>  A few additional interviewing tips - Don't chew gum or breath mints during your interview and don't speak in slang as it is unprofessional and rude.<br>  <br>  <br>  WHAT NOT TO DO<br>  <br>  Show up unprepared: Most candidates have several days to prepare for a job interview. This is plenty of time to freshen up your resume and references, and learn everything you can about the company and job for which you’re applying. Knowing the business and its major players is great way to give you the edge over other candidates. <br>  2. Pay little attention to your appearance: Think your appearance doesn’t count? Think again! The trend may be for business casual, but it’s still proper business etiquette to wear a suit. When it comes to the job interview, it’s all about the first impression. The company wants to hire the best person to represent the business, mohawked and hardwared individuals usually don’t fit the description. <br>  3. Have nothing to say: It’s frustrating to an interviewer to receive one syllable answers. Go into detail. Sell yourself. <br>  4. Say too much: Give your interviewer time to talk. By monopolizing the conversation and not letting others get a word in edgewise, you’re showing yourself to be a poor listener and disrespectful to higher ups. <br>  5. Give a sob story: No one cares how deep in debt you are. If you give your interviewers the impression you’re irresponsible or your problems are a distraction, you won’t get the job. <br>  6. Tell jokes: A job interview isn’t the time or place to be a comedian. You need to show you’re serious about the job. <br>  7. Lie: Don’t lie about education, qualifications, past employment or a prison record. These are all things that businesses look into nowadays. Lying during a job interview can also be grounds for dismissal later on. <br>  8. Trash a former employer: This is one of the biggest mistakes made during interviews. When asked why they’re seeking new employment many candidates will complain about a past employer. Why would anyone want to hire a malcontent? <br>  9. Blame problems on co-workers: If there was an incident at a past place of employment, own up to it as honestly as possible. Casting the blame on other people only makes you look worse. <br>  10. Act too familiar with your interviewers: Don’t call your interviewers Bob and Suzy (even if it is their names). Unless invited to do otherwise, address them as Mr. Ms, Dr or another respectful title. <br>  <br>  <br>  Hope I helped!|`|f1lpdiNEaa	When you meet your interviewer smile and shake hands for a good first impression.<br>  Keep your body language 'open' with your interviewer. Don't cross arms, legs or lean away from them, keep eye contact etc.<br>  Be prepared with some answers for the usual questions employers ask; your stengths, weaknesses, why you want the job, why you left your old job, examples of working as a team/using IT/good customer service etc.<br>  Be prepared with a few questions when they ask if you have any; ask what training will be provided, how many people are in the team/department and check hours, overtime and holiday if you're not sure.<br>  Dress smartly and if you wear makeup and jewellery keep it simple for the interview.<br>  Remember to take some ID incase they need a copy of this and any certificates if they have asked to see those. <br>  Be confident, give clear, relevant answers and think positive. Good luck!|`|sAwmwynnaa	go to the pub instead, a lot less stressful.|`|eiSaaLxUaa	don't be late.|`|ibVyaVByaa	the key is preparation.  understand the company you are interviewing for and what you have to offer.  The key question they will indirectly (or maybe directly) ask you is : Why should I hire you?  Why are you different than the other candidates.  Also, remember that the interview is 2 way.  Ask them questions that is relevant to your job.  And be prepared to not only discuss how your background may be relevant to them, but they will certainly ask you what your strengths and weaknesses are.  Make sure you can state your weaknesses so that you can turn it to strengths.  eg. my weakness is the lack of professional working experience I have in xyz, that is why I am applying for this job to not only contribute but also get more experience in this area. <br>  <br>  good luck|`|SdgKGdMTaa	Remember that when given notice you have an interview, this means you are 50% there.

If anything comes up in the future, give me a call. Then apply for the next job. Good luck Dot!|`|AA10777253	75% of the interview is won or lost in the first 30 seconds. How you make that eye contact, make that greeting, how you appear at first makes a dramatic impression on the interviewer. The rest of the interview is largely a formality. <br>  <br>  I learned this from a friend because that's how we got to know each other: he interviewed me for a job once. I started at a new job and recognized his name and the company as they were a customer of my new employer. We laughed about it when we spoke over the phone. First he explained that the postion he interviewed me for got cancelled which is why I wasn't hired. He then confided to me that he wanted to hire me within 30 seconds of the interview starting. He explained that he felt an instant connection from the time I walked in, make eye contact, greeted him in a warm friendly way, sat down in the chair ready to take questions, ... He simply decided he wanted me before he got to any questions. He then explained that the person he interviewed immediately after me gave him the opposite impression. She entered the room gingerly, made poor eye contact, appeared nervous and unredy to answer questions. He decided immediately, he didn't want her. <br>  <br>  That's how you do it!<br>  <br>  -- Liam|`|WnUZCcytaa	First impression should be good and remain. Follow the steps below.<br>  1.

KsMLHzbzaa	I WOULD GET A LOAN FOR ANOTHER 2000. YOU CAN FIND A DESCENT CAR FOR 4K OR UNDER. YOU WANT TO HAVE SOME EXTRA MONEY TO CHANGE FLUIDS, MAINTAINENCE,ETC. FIND ONE WITH LESS THAN 70K MILES AND IT WILL SURELY LAST YOU AT LEAST 2 YEARS. A NEWER HONDA ACCORD WOULD BE A GOOD CAR FOR A FIRST TIME DRIVER. MAKE SURE YOU CHANGE ALL THE FLUIDS WHEN YOU GET THE CAR. TRANSMISSION FLUID AND OIL. CHECK THE BELTS ALSO. MAINTAINENCE IS KEY TO KEEPING THE VEHICLE IN GOOD RUNNING CONDITION. MAKE SURE IT HAS GOOD TIRES, AND IS INSPECTED ALSO. PEOPLE ARE DESPERITE TO SELL, SO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT. ALWAYS TRY TO GET THEM TO LOWER THE PRICE. EVERYONE STARTS HIGH WITH THEIR STARTING PRICES. IF YOU PURCHASE A CAR FOR UNDER 2K, BY THE TIME 2 YEARS PASS, YOU WILL PROBABLY PUT ANOTHER 2K INTO IT. LOOK AT IT THAT WAY. AND THE CAR WOULDNT BE WORTH MUCH AFTER THE TWO YEARS.

This book explains the steps to solving your problem. This book helps you tell your money where to go instead of wondering where it went. but first it will tell you to save up a $1000 emergency fund as quickly as you can. Then it would tell you to pay off your debts in the order of amount. So if you owe someone $200 and someone else $2000, you pay off the $200 first. Dave Ramsey also has a great website. He gives excellent advice to low-mid (average) income people. I am debt free except for a student loan and house. (no car pmt. or credit cards), So I am making good progress with his advice. <br>  <br>  <br>  I think you should put $875 in a glass frame and write (in case of emergency, break glass) then hide it in the back of your coat closet. Take your girl out for a picnic instead! Then, save up another $105 dollars so you have $1000 in cash. Then, do every thing you can to pay down your debts fast. Good luck. I wish I had this book when I was 20 years old!!!!|`|zuGKIWfNaa	This isn't an either/or question, you know.

KN3I89Ycaa	The loans should defer automatically if he is a half-time student.  If not, submit the paperwork and they will, but there is usually a lag.  The problem might be that even though they told him not to pay, the loans didn't defer in time and showed as late.  They would then contact your mom because she is co-signer on the loan.  That is all legitimate.  The credit was ran most likely as an annual review or bc of the deferment request.  <br>  The other person's advice that they just talk to your husband won't work bc should he default, his mom signed for responsibility for the loans she cosigned.  She would have to pay them.<br>  If he can, have your husband consolidate them into his own name to remove your mother from the equation.  Call Sallie Mae and explain that you were told not to pay and now your mother-on-law is getting notices.  if it is their error, have them fix the probable credit report delinquency they filed.  Write down who you speak to for reference as well.<br>  Explain the situation to your in laws so they know you're on top of your bills and it was a simple mistake on Sallie Mae's part.<br>  Since they sent 5 years of statements, make sure that his mom is only showing up on the only loan she signed and not all of them.

It will take up to 12 weeks to receive the extra refund, since an amended tax return must be mailed in.  It is really a good deal even if you have to repay, but since you do it through your income tax returns beginning in 2010, it will only be a small amount of additional tax each year.<br>  <br>  Good Luck,<br>  <br>  Laura H – H&R Block – Senior Tax Advisor 5 <br>  **This advice was prepared based on our understanding of the tax law in effect at the time it was written as it applies to the facts that you provided.|`|xNkmK0SHaa	You can file an amended return.

I would claim some of it but not all of it.  Maybe hide like 75% or something like that in your special drawer.

The easiest way to convey such title is to attach a title insurance policy.  So, it only makes sense that you be the one that pays for the policy.
snh9wzpnaa	To correct you slightly, the family you refer to can be on welfare but they also have to work some to get the refund you are talking about.  They don't have to work much but they have to earn near $10K or more to get the refund you are talking about.  But you are right in that they can be on welfare and get this federal handout as well.<br>  <br>  Any "why" questions about taxes would have to be addressed to your congressman and senators.  They are the one who cooked up the Robin Hood tax system and make it even worse every chance they can.  What you describe is made even worse by the new stimulus law, really a new over-spending non-stimulus law.  Now people can get EIC for three kids instead of just two, and get the additional child tax credit with as little as $3000 in income.<br>  <br>  It all started in the 1970s when the Earned Income Credit was cooked up to encourage people to work instead of sitting around on welfare.  It was less than $500 a year and was a nice security blanket to give to those who tried to work but couldn't make a lot of income.<br>  <br>  The problem is that congress made it grow much, much faster than inflation and it grew into a substantial source of income instead of a security blanket.  Now it is so big that instead of encouraging people to work, we are paying teenage girls to have at least two kids as soon as possible and then work at Taco Bell enough to get into the "sweet spot" of earnings necessary to maximize the EIC of almost $5000.  Then throw in an additional child tax credit of $1000 per child and give her all of her withholdings back and pretty soon you have an $8000 refund on $12000 earnings when only $1000 was withheld in the first place.<br>  <br>  So it is really a $1000 refund and a $7000 of federal welfare to encourage people to not be on local welfare.  Although being on local welfare does not diminish how much federal welfare people can get, so they tend to use both systems to the max.<br>  <br>  Ain't it great to live in country made great by people getting out and working hard, and if they needed more money, they just worked longer and harder for it!  Why did we go away from that?|`|4ZNl4V3Oaa	Hmmm...  Been listening to Limbaugh and Levin a lot lately??<br>  <br>  Welfare does not qualify for the EIC.  Nor is it taxable.  Someone on welfare as their sole means of support does NOT receive ANY tax refund.

What's your source of information on some family getting over $6,000 as a tax refund?|`|zuGKIWfNaa	They shouldn't get a refund unless they've either paid into the system in the first place, or unless the head of household for the family has earned enough income during the year that they qualify for tax credits. <br>  <br>  They may be committing tax fraud -- or you may simply not know as much about this family's financial situation as you seem to think you do.|`|AA11284831	Where do you get your information?  Someone receiving welfare as their only source of income does not file a tax return and does not get any sort of refunds.<br>  <br>  Methinks you've been listening to too much talk radio.<br>  <br>  Dunno where "Bob F" gets his info from.  Welfare is NOT earned income and does NOT qualify one for the EIC.  Welfare recipients do NOT pay taxes and do NOT get tax refunds.

Good Luck Realtor Tina in CT    Obama Promises More Low-Cost Mortgages   President Barack Obama promised Saturday to reduce mortgage costs as a key part of his plan to improve the economy.    Analysts applauded the move, saying that making low-cost mortgages widely available could stabilize housing markets and jumpstart new home construction.     Beyond that, observers say aid for the troubled housing market will help blunt the anger many Americans feel over the financial bailout as the executives of firms that received billons take bonuses while average people lose their homes.

It is all about being smart with your money, your ideas, your marketing, and the people who help you!<br>  <br>  You want to make sure you are spending your money without picking a business that is going to tank - especially in this economy.  And probably even thinking that with $10,000 you can pick a business that is guaranteed success.  You cannot guarantee that.  <br>  <br>  It would be best to think about what you really love to do.  How can you make THAT into a business?  Do it on the cheap.  Then, if you mess up on something, it won't be a big deal to fix it - you will have the money.<br>  <br>  I guess my point is this - just because you have the money, don't go throwing it around.

Presumably representing athletes, but possibly representing the teams.<br>  <br>  It's an OK name. I assume "Pros" plays off of both the concept of sports professionals and image professionals.<br>  <br>  I'm not crazy about "image" in that the word can suggest a superficial involvement. The trend in PR for years has been to try to involve the PR professional more in the decision-making and advisory roles, rather than to just present/change an appearance/image. Still, that's internal PR stuff. The question is: How will your clients/potential clients view the name?<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.

It is for your safety that they ask you not to talk on the phone.<br>  <br>  Also it is very rude, I wouldn't want to be conducting business with you and have to wait until you finish your conversation.

pt6wIlS1aa	No, a 40 year mortgage would just be that much more total money paid, mostly interest. Most people don't have 40 years of work life left anyway unless they're very young. <br>  <br>  A 7-year car loan would help very low-income people, but of course it would cost them much more in the end. Still, that might be okay, because they'd be able to afford a more reliable car instead of paying for repairs. I wouldn't choose such a long loan term, though. I'm also not sure it wouldn't carry more risk for the lender, since car warranties would expire before the car was paid off, so the person might just abandon the loan and let the car be repossessed if it needed repairs.|`|gqmtPx8gaa	Of course your not taking into account the amount of lost equity you would have. By spreading the payment out another 10 years that's 10 more years of interest payments added onto the total amount. When paying your house mortgage The first few years you're paying the interest first with only a very small amount going towards the principle. Adding 10 more years means you'd be paying even LESS on your principle. You could buy a house today for $200,000 and in 10 years time you'd still owe $196,000 on it. <br>  <br>  No one should EVER pay for a car over 7 years. Again you'd lose so much because youre now paying an extra 2+ years of interest on the vehicle. If you financed $30,000 you'd end up paying $40,000 for a vehicle that in 7 years time is only worth $12,000. <br>  <br>  Bad ideas.

If there is a lot of equity in the property and the debtor files Chapter 7, then the trustee might want to sell the property.  In many cases, there is no equity and they owner can still keep the property if they can keep making the payments.  The lenders often do not want to foreclosure and will gladly keep accepting mortgage payments.

One does not have to abandon the property or the debt associated.    A mortgage that is owed by more than one person can be taken over by the other owners if the bankrupt person does choose to include that property and mortgage in the bankruptcy. If they do not choose to take it over, the property is put up for sale. The other owners, who would ordinarily be on the hook in foreclosure for any shortfall, ride through the bankruptcy and have no debt for the shortfall.    A judge in a bankruptcy court may vary this rule, so that all parties should be represented in that hearing.
DFTB95BQaa	Yes.      Edit = I've been trying to remember how we got out of the PMI with a two-mortagage system once but I just can't. Too long ago. But we did do it with the help of a mortgage broker.    Something like the second mortgage took care of the 20% requirement for the first and main mortgage. I just don't remember but there is a way. Try and find a broker through a friend and just straight out ask.    In the meantime, if you can't get out of the PMI, keep an eye on it.

Generally, loans closed prior to January 1, 2001 will not be eligible for termination of MIP, which is collected as part of your monthly mortgage payment.     For loans closed on or after January 1, 2001, FHA's MIP will be automatically terminated under the following conditions:    1. For mortgages with terms more than 15 years, the MIP will be terminated when the Loan to Value (LTV) ratio reaches 78%, provided the borrower has paid the MIP for at least five years. If the LTV reaches 78% and the borrower has not paid MIP for at least five years then the borrower must continue to pay MIP until the five year requirement is met.    2. For mortgages with terms 15 years and less and with LTV ratios of 90% and greater, the MIP will be terminated when the LTV ratio reaches 78%, irrespective of the length of time the borrower has paid the MIP.    3. Mortgages with terms 15 years and less and with LTV ratios of 89.99% and less will not be charged MIP.    Although the MIP will be terminated as described, the FHA insurance will remain in force for the loan's full term. This MIP termination provision only applies to loans where the borrower also paid an Up-front MIP at closing.    FHA will determine when a borrower has reached the 78% LTV ratio based on the lesser of the sales price or appraised value at loan origination. For example, if the lesser of the sales price or the appraised value at origination was $100,000, when the loan amount reaches $78,000, HUD will no longer collect MIP on the loan.     FHA's regulations do not permit a borrower to submit a new appraisal to reach the threshold for termination of MIP. Termination of MIP will normally be based on the scheduled amortization of the loan. However, borrowers may reach the 78% threshold in advance of the scheduled amortization because of prepayments of loan principal. A borrower whose loan reaches the 78% LTV threshold sooner than projected because of prepayment may have the MIP terminated (but not sooner than five years from loan closing for loans with terms greater than 15 years) if the borrower has not been more than 30 days delinquent in paying the mortgage payments during the previous 12 months. The borrower must submit a termination request to the lender and the lender must provide the borrower's request and supporting documentation with respect to the mortgage payments during the last 12 months to FHA for such termination.     If you have questions regarding the termination of MIP, go to the following HUD website: http://www.hud.gov/offices/hsg/sfh/nsc/n... or contact HUD's National Servicing Center at 1-888-297-8685 for more information.
HWbx1m4Laa	It sounds like your family is having a little trouble letting go.  Totally normal.. try not to get too upset by it. But yes, i do think it sounds like you should venture out to a new place and do your own thing. You are grown and you shouldn't feel obligated to check with your parents on your decisions anymore.  And i agree with your last statement about experiencing the difficulties of life on your own. That's how i feel. But everyone needs a place to get some loving advice during those hard times because they've experienced more time on the earth, so keep that door open. Be free and do what YOU want. If it feels right, do it!  When in doubt, don't!  Listen to your own wisdom and you will be successful in everything.|`|tVOzjukaaa	I know exactly how you feel. I moved back in with my parents for graduate school, due to the financial savings. It was a bit frustrating at first, especially when they always want to know where I am going, etc. The bottom line is, I think it is really hard for parents to find the right balance between getting too involved, and not being involved enough. Most people err one way or the other, and you shouldn't blame them for that. We will struggle to find that balance when we have children ourselves someday. Get your own job, live your own life, and use your own good judgment, but don't exclude your parents from your life just because they aren't perfect. <br>  <br>  Also, don't do anything just as an opposite reaction to what your parents want. For example, having sex with strangers is a bad idea, even if you don't like to hear it from them. Using your feelings about your parents to justify a bad decision won't make it into a right decision. Make the right decisions for the right reasons.<br>  <br>  I think you will be fine. There is no easy answer like you said, so just make good sound decisions as they come along. Good luck!

Wrf5orAuaa	Because of Switzerland's strict banking privacy laws, people can hide their ill gotten gains|`|vp8806Eraa	Swiss Bank Account Advantages<br>  <br>  Privacy<br>  Your relationship with your Swiss bank can be compared to doctor/patient confidentiality or the private information you might share with an attorney. Swiss law forbids bankers to disclose the existence of your account or any other information about it without your consent (except for certain circumstances, which we'll discuss later). Where the similarity ends is when that privacy is violated. Whereas in the United States, if your doctor or attorney violates your confidence you must begin legal action; in Switzerland, if a banker divulges information about a bank account without permission, immediate prosecution is begun by the Swiss public attorney. Bankers face up to six months in prison and a fine of up to 50,000 Swiss francs. And, you have the option of suing the bank for damages. Needless to say, Swiss banks are very careful about protecting your privacy.<br>  <br>  The only exceptions to the Swiss banking privacy rule are criminal activities such as drug trafficking, insider trading or organized crime, which we'll talk more about later.<br>  <br>  Low Risk<br>  So privacy is a big deal if you have money you don't want other people to know about, and unless you're a criminal it's highly unlikely anyone can ever find out about your account. For example, doctors who might be sued for malpractice might have money in a Swiss account to prevent them being totally wiped out in the event of lawsuit. Unethical, yes, but it happens. Really, anyone can have assets that they want to protect from attack. Sometimes, though, privacy isn't the main reason people want a Swiss bank account. Switzerland has had an extremely stable economy and infrastructure for many years and hasn't been at war with another country since 1505. Swiss bankers are also highly trained in investing and know how to grow your money.<br>  <br>  Increasing your wealth means little if your money isn't protected. So, how safe is your money in a Swiss bank? Depositor protection in Switzerland is governed by the Swiss Bankers Association's (SBA) self-regulatory Depositor Protection Agreement and, since July 1, 2004, was also codified into the Swiss Banking Act with a few additional requirements that significantly strengthened depositor protection in Switzerland [Source: SwissBanking.org]. The revised Depositors' Protection Agreement covers all deposits and is also applicable to non-bank securities dealers. Protecting depositors is vital in maintaining public confidence in the Swiss banking system and, in order to strengthen this confidence, the SBA had drawn up a self-regulatory Depositor Protection Agreement with its member banks in 1984. This agreement guarantees that, in the event of a bank failure, depositors will rapidly receive their legally privileged claims. As an additional safety measure, Swiss law demands high capital adequacy. Swiss banks can therefore certainly be counted amongst the safest in the world. <br>  <br>  In fact, the Swiss franc is considered one of the world's premier currencies with virtually zero inflation and has been historically backed by at least 40 percent gold reserves. Swiss banks are also known to have very sophisticated investment services and Internet banking. <br>  <br>  <br>  In the United States, law enforcement agencies, the judicial system, and even private citizens can gain access to financial information of all sorts. In Switzerland, however, neither a bank's officers, nor employees are allowed to reveal any account or account holder information to anyone, including the Swiss government.|`|TWsxP46Qaa	its to do with swiss secrecy laws,no government,corporation company agency nor individual can get access to banking details for a swiss account,thereby stopping the inland revenue or IRS etc snooping to see how much you have and taking their chunk.

msNXomjTaa	Credit is where you borrow money from somewhere else, and pay it back, usually slowly, and paying interest (extra money) for the priviledge.<br>  <br>  This could be a loan from a bank, usually backed by the value of the item you are borrowing for.  Examples are a house, or a car.  As houses have traditionally held their values, you could get larger loans at lower interest rates than say for a car.  This is where all the current problem came from - too many banks were lending too much money to people that really could not afford to pay it back.  The values of the houses dropped to less than the amount of money the people owed, so even if the bank took the house back and sold it (foreclosure), they were still out some money.  Multiplied over thousands or millions of houses - a credit crunch.  Normally, if you cannot pay, the bank seizes your property, and sells it, keeping what is owed (you get the rest, if there is anything left over).<br>  <br>  Credit cards are another from of credit.  This is basically a temporary loan.  Each card is pre-approved for a certain amount, based on what the bank thinks that customer can afford.  So, you buy something with your card, and the bank pays the store, and you pay the bank back.  If you do not pay the whole amount at the end of the month, the bank charges an interest fee on the amount owed.  Some stores have their own credit cards.  Many are actually a bank card in disguise, but some stores handle their own credit.<br>  <br>  There are also lines of credit, which is something in between a credit card and an actual loan.  They are meant for larger amounts, but for which payment will be made in full sooner than a house mortgage, which usually has a fixed payment.|`|yCR6qg0baa	I think most of it came about from the Great Depression and the creation of the FDIC. Prior to the 1930's, customers could "buy" something (let's say a table) from a store & only pay a little bit up front, and then pay the rest when they had the money to. If they didn't pay for the table in a reasonable time frame, the store-owner would send someone out to re-possess the table. When the Great Depression hit, many people lost their homes because the banks did not have assets to back all the money they lended out. All of that happened b/c lending was not regulated. <br>  <br>  Now days, we have what we call a "credit score", which is basically just a tally of your debts. It varies from country to country. In the US, there are 3 credit reporting agencies: Equifax, Trans-Union, and Experian. Your credit can range from 300-850. The higher the better. Generally, if you want to buy a house, for example, you need a credit score of at least 500. The lower your score is, the higher the lender will want your income to be. I mean, lenders won't lend to people who can't pay. <br>  <br>  If you have a $30,000 annual income and $300,000 in student loans, credit card debt, and a mortgage, you will probably have a hard time paying all your bills. When you miss a payment, your credit score drops. When you buy a house or vehicle, your credit score drops. Every time someone looks at your credit score, it drops. <br>  <br>  The economy is changing. In 2006, someone with a $26,000 income could easily get a $250,000 mortgage. A lot of those people are the ones losing their homes today. Today, it's more regulated, believe me! We just bought our first house & did everything in my husband's name. He only makes $37,000 (he's in grad school) and his credit score was 732 (which is very good) and we were only approved for a $108,000 mortgage. We chose to buy a $72,000 townhouse so we don't get in over our heads since we're both in school. But do you see how different it is now? 3 years ago, I could have gotten a $300,000 house!

Often when a company recruits for a position, they start from scratch. They presume that any rejected candidates probably have found other jobs. Even though it was one month, they usually start the process over from scratch. <br>  <br>  What you can do is inquire with HR or the manager about your last interview.

However, with short sales, if IndyMac receives a 'back up offer' more attractive than your offer is, IndyMac simply will refuse to approve your offer.  I assume your offer was accepted contingent upon IndyMac approval.<br>  <br>  That being the case, IndyMac will simply insist that your offer be raised to the level of any better back up offer in order for IndyMac to grant approval.<br>  <br>  That puts you basically back into a 'bidding situation'.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|EXJfoGtAaa	You state your offer was accepted but by whom?

You cannot afford to sit around waiting for the "perfect job". You need money in the bank. Whether you love what you do or not, if you have a job you are more apt to land that job you really want...

The librarian will ask the following questions in order to qualify you as a "certified" typist:<br>  <br>  (1) Are you familiar and have a working knowledge of Microsoft Word?<br>  <br>  (2) Are you able to set up section breaks along with appropriate placement of auto page numbering in the footer/header?<br>  <br>  (3) Are you familiar with setting up a scheme with emphasis on the proper use of auto numbering, such as 1., 1.1, (a), (i), etc.?<br>  <br>  (4) Do you have access to a scanner with built-in OCR sofware?<br>  <br>  (5) Do you have access to a high-speed laser quality printer?<br>  <br>  If you answer all the above questions in the affirmative, the librarian will provide you with a sample of the typing format template (i.e., margin settings, font selection, page set up, etc.) in order to complete these projects. <br>  <br>  The librarian will then place your name on a list of "certified" graduate typists. This "certified' list will be given to various department heads so that any graduate student seeking your services can easily contact you directly from this list.<br>  <br>  An average weekend income is about $300-$400 for two days of work.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|2kGc2uQJaa	If you have a heart to help others prosper, you should take a look at this video. <a href="http://giverwillreceive.com" rel="nofollow">http://giverwillreceive.com</a> I wish you all the best!<br>  <br>  Erik

He must legally pay you for each day that you've worked.<br>  <br>  Rest assured that if pay day is this Friday, then your employer will already have done payroll for this month and it will already be winging its way to your bank account.  However, if you get paid per calendar month, this may mean that because you've finished now rather than working until the end of the month, you've actually been overpaid by a couple of days and you will need to pay this back.<br>  <br>  Additionally, upon termination of your employment he must also pay you any holiday pay that you have accrued, but he could argue that your employment is not officially terminated yet since you haven't resigned in writing and have refused to discuss the situation with him.<br>  <br>  With regards to the argument about not paying you for getting in early, he is right in this case as an employer does not have to pay for overtime if you haven't been expressly asked to work it.|`|808f8239addd67976faf828dba2a4992aa	You do not have to put up with that type of treatment but the problem is is do you have witness's? if not talk to someone other than the person who harassed you and if he insists to see you request another worker to be present, they can not pay you and can cause you to spend money to get it from the company it's a big hassle.|`|bZjuP1Bqaa	I would find a new job, seriously, why would someone want to work with a sexist pig?<br>  <br>  You do not need to be around that<br>  go out and find a better job.<br>  <br>  Good Luck Sweetie! ?|`|76fa193634e47a7a06961dde2e863ef2aa	Your employer cannot withold money you have earned.<br>  if you feel uncomfortable contacting him write a letter stating your reasons why and inform them that you expect to be paid.

49740c9daeea677fc86801fb2b3f41deaa	Usually renters are talking about mildew.   The appropriate response from the landlord is to tell you to clean you kitchen and bathroom (where most mildew problems occur).<br>  <br>  If it really is mold you need the Environmental Health department to document and test it.   Most mold will not require any action from the landlord, unless it is causing structural problems or is a harmful strain.   No harmful strains have been found in the US for a very long time.  But of course, as you will not see any actual mold without ripping up the walls or floors it could certainly be around.|`|tdQTZPI7aa	Contact your local office of the Board of Health|`|LpVwWJVsaa	I would like to know what they are trying to do to remedy the situation...it's difficult to make a suggestion based on just the info that you have provided here.<br>  <br>  In your lease, I am sure that there is a clause about keeping the unit in functional and you should also check the laws in your state regarding what rights and responsibilities your landlord has. <br>  <br>  If this is an ongoing issue, you can contact your local housing inspector with the City.  In my city, he will come out and inspect the unit, write his findings along with an itemized list of things that need to be repaired, give them a certain amount of time to remedy the situation and if it's not done by that date, the landlord will receive a fine.  For more habitual offenders, they can even lose their certification by the City and open themselves up to a ton of civil suits.|`|QkpStZqvaa	The suggestions about going to the board of health are alright, if you don't mind taking 6 months to resolve this and ruining your relationship with your landlord in the process. The other responses are just inaccurate. <br>  <br>  Some molds, such as stachybotrys, produce mycotoxins which can be toxic to humans. While most molds aren't as bad as this, every single type of mold can cause hayfever-like symptoms. What's worse is that they more you're exposed to a type of mold, the more you become sensitive to it. It's not going to kill you, but it can make your life miserable. <br>  <br>  If you've been experiencing health problems in your apartment, bring this to the attention of your landlord when you ask him/her to fix the problem. <br>  <br>  Unfortunately, there are so many ways that your landlord can screw up the clean up and make the problem worse. The EPA's website has the best mold-related information on the web that I've found. If you're really concerned, spend a few hours reading it. Try to use this information to reason with your landlord. If none of this works, call the health department. They'll give him a deadline to clean it up, or face losing his certificate of occupancy.|`|AA10263406	Is it mold or mildew? There are very few molds that are harmful.<br>  <br>  Depending on the location of the problem, it might not be the landlords responsibility at all.|`|d1431527582f8f414e0e05855712ef5faa	Contact the health department in your area.|`|48dfBDczaa	We are having the exact same problem right now. I turned to my boyfriend and asked him if he posted the question when I read your question because we are trying to figure this out right now. Doug T.'s advice is the best you will find.<br>  <br>  We live in a larger apartment just outside Houston in Katy, Texas. We have been getting the run around from the property manager who seems to not know how to read. We took a sample in when we first discovered mold in the air ducts to be sure it wasn't just dust. It wasn't. It was an overload amount of cladosporium. When we were informed that matenience was coming to spray without even evaluating the situation, we hired a state lic. inspector to come out to test. $400 dollars later we were told the ducts have to be replaced, all clothing has to be dry cleaned and all furniture and belongings need to be professionally cleaned. What we got from the apartment management... they sprayed a 50/50 mixture of water and bleach inside the fiberglass lined ducts and then a coat of pigmented primer was sprayed on top but just in the part of the duct they could reach with the spray bottle and aresol can. All of this took about 1/2 hour.<br>  <br>  Needless to say, we have contacted the company who owns the apartment that is conveniently located in another state. We are waiting to hear back from them. Needless to say we are starting to pack our belongings and are going to look for a different apartment this weekend.<br>  <br>  You can find all the resources you need to be knowledgable about the proper guidelines for dealing with mold on the EPA website, including a free mold course (a series of pages with short questions). You can also find your regional office for your state, however they encourage you to contact local and state agencies if they have regulations about mold. Texas - not so much. However I have learned that using some kind of sealer in air duct can violate fire safety codes. <br>  <br>  Good luck.

LIN0tpZFaa	None of the secondary colleges in Canberra have any IT programs that especially stand out above the rest, but Lake Tuggeranong and Radford Colleges are very good.<br>  <br>  CIT really is a great institution for IT, especially because they are very well connected to the industry across Canberra, so your chances of landing a dream job are better at CIT than the rest. The thing is, the industry is highly specialised, and while there are some tertiary institutions that might be better in particular systems or software, CIT has the best general IT programs overall. <br>  <br>  So if your intentions at this stage are "something IT related", look at CIT.

Don't panic.<br>  <br>  As to whether or not the bank can go after you for the difference, that depends upon whether you live in one of the 17 non-recourse states or if you live in what is called a recourse state. Recourse states allow the lender to go after the borrower for the difference. Non-recourse states do not. The non-recourse states include California and Georgia.<br>  <br>  Even if you live in a recourse state, lenders are not going after borrowers in most cases right now. As part of any short sale or foreclosure, the lender is forgiving the debt. It costs more to go after the borrower than can usually be recovered. <br>  <br>  As for the tax implications, as of last year, the government has given a reprieve to most of those who go into foreclosure.

bf420b0aeac394f3c7221fd12f9c7ebbaa	First, you thought wrong.  If you are not in full compliance with the terms of your account you can be sued.  You have no basis for fighting this since you really did miss two months in a row.  (With the December payment, there is no "only $9".  You either paid what you were supposed to, or you didn't.)<br>  <br>  There are three reasons why they are being so aggressive.  All are related to the current economy.  <br>  <br>  (1) They get the judgment on file and don't act to enforce it as long as you follow the agreed payment terms.  It's just some additional leverage for them because some people will say they agree to anything, just to avoid a court case, and then not pay.  You probably meant it, but they don't know you that well.<br>  <br>  (2) The statute of limitations requires that they file suit in a certain amount of time or they lose the right to sue.<br>  <br>  (3) (And this may be the main reason)  A lot more people are getting into financial trouble these days forcing a lot of creditors to be more aggressive in collecting and suing.  Judgments take precedence in the order in which they were issued, so, they are suing just to protect their place in line in case you are late with another creditor and he sues first.  The first judgment holder would get first crack at garnishment and seizing your assets and have to be 100% satisfied before the second judgment holder gets anything.  I realize that this sounds very extreme in your particular case, but this is probably the real reason for the two missed payments and go to court policy.  <br>  <br>  Bottom line:  don't worry about it.  Just pay them off like you were going to.  Bring a copy of your receipt or canceled check to court.  The best is if you could pay at a local teller and get a receipt.  If this is not possible, pay an extra couple of bucks and get a money order (fill in the payee and photo copy it) and then mail it certified with return receipt requested and save your stub from that for the court.  Good luck.|`|LpVwWJVsaa	I would call your legal aid office.

oFiGyMWraa	The main advantage to being a limited company is what happens if things go wrong. As a sole trader you are personally liable for all the debts and you could lose everything. A ltd company is liable in its own right. You would be a shareholder and could not lose anything more than you have already put into the company. So while you might lose the business your home, savings, pensions etc would be safe.<br>  <br>  However, in practice many banks require personal guarantees from company directors, which cancels out all these benefits of being a ltd company.<br>  <br>  There are also tax differences. Depending on your precise circumstances either could be most advantageous.<br>  <br>  If you did decide to convert there could be some hefty capital gains tax (CGT) consequences. When you convert you are actually selling all your assets to the company. At this point any capital gains are realised. As you have owned some of those assets for a long time the gains might be big, so might the tax bill. There are certain reliefs available, but that might just be putting off the pain until later. Having said that, even if you don't convert you still might find yourself wanting to dispose of assets sooner or later with the same CGT issues.<br>  <br>  I am guessing that if you gave been a trader for 40 years you might be thinking about retirement soon? If so these CGT issues might be particularly relevant.<br>  <br>  There is no difference betweena Ltd Company and a Ltd Liability Company - they are the same thing. Do you mean a Ltd Liability Partnership (LLP)? A normal partnership is very similar to a sole trader. In theory the partners can be liable for any debts of the firm. For large professional partnerships that cannot be ltd companies, like solicitors, accountants etc this puts individual partners in a risky position. An LLP is very similar to a regular partnership, but give some of the limited liability benefits of a company. The LLP format is not relevant to you unless you are this kind of professional.|`|066a3072b2a697635921e0eb4d7507ddaa	The main difference between a Limited Liability Partnership or LLP and a limited liability company is that a Limited Liability Partnership has the organisational flexibility of a partnership and is taxed as a partnership. In other respects it is very similar to a company.

WveXRwt4aa	533 isn't bad its fair to good, and since you are still young and work full time and go to school, then yes, of course you will be approved for a personal loan(to pay off bills), consumer loan(car), student loan(education). It won't be for 50 K or anything but you will be approved. Try researching banks and interest. If its not that much that you are looking for try to apply for a CC with a 5k limit. Some will give you a 0% apr for the first year and if the loan is short term, maybe you can even pay it back quicker that way.

806455f30adefbff1e3b1fbdc3ecc722aa	BB&T may have had this as a guideline at the time. By 2008, lenders were starting to tighten how many loans they could have and how much security would be allowed for a single borrower.<br>  <br>  Nonetheless, PLEASE!! You state, "I had no choice by to trust him." C'mon! You had a choice. You could have, and should have, walked away. Nobody was forcing you to build a new home. Nobody glued you to the chair, or put a gun to your head. You wanted. You chose. You are responsible for your actions.<br>  <br>  Over the past couple years, I've just gotten so used to people acting irresponsibly that I'm too quick to jump to that on any scenario.<br>  <br>  What you basically did was put your present home at risk. If you failed to get a construction-to-perm loan, and only got a construction loan, you're about to find out that you cannot get permanent financing now and you are as stuck as stuck can be. The lender will foreclose on both properties. Even with a C2P, the lender will look for any reason to not convert the loan, unless you have significant cash equity (25%+) and liquid reserves (6x both mortgage payments). <br>  <br>  This was the WRONG way to do this, but it's the way you CHOSE to do this. Had you done some basic research prior to signing an $800k note, this would not have happened. <br>  <br>  I am sorry to be so harsh, but my tax dollars will now go to people like you who did not take minimum steps to protect themselves. (Well, fortunately, no tax dollars will go to you because your loan is too large!)<br>  <br>  ADDITIONAL<br>  Sorry, I missed that the present home was being torn down and the home was being built on the same property. I thought you purchased Home A and then decided to build a home on Property B...<br>  <br>  Given that additional information, the previous loan did need to be rolled into the new loan. The collateral for the previous loan could not be modified - torn down - otherwise. Whatever equity you had in the property after the home was torn down would be treated as equity in the new transaction. It is called "lot value."<br>  <br>  Example: Previous property was worth $500k, you had a $300k mortgage, and the lot is worth $400k after the house is torn down. That gives you $100k equity in the new home.|`|EXJfoGtAaa	It definitely sounds like you were building on the same site and if so  then the bank is correct.  If it's a different site then you have two properties encumbered by one mortgage.  Just check the legal description in the mortgage.<br>  Thanks for the additional info.

49d798aae69c40cbf0926ebc21291224aa	Possibly, but not necessarily.  It could be acceptable to simply pass these extra duties off onto people in the UK without making those people redundant and creating a new job - it really depends upon how much it will impact them.  Is it vastly changing the nature of their role so that it is in effect a different job, or is it simply giving them a little bit of extra work that those individuals could easily cope with?<br>  <br>  Your employer does have to use a fair selection process when selecting people to be made redundant, and they do have to explain to you why you're being made redundant.  But if they were to say "we are moving your team's function to the US" then that in itself is a fair and justifiable reason - you can't really argue with that.<br>  <br>  Also usually, in times of economic downturn such as this, employers look to make cost-saving measures as they're doing less business.  You use the term "increased work" but whilst "increased duties" is probably correct, "increased work" is not - if the company is doing less business overall then these employees have easily got the time to spend doing other duties.  As an example, I was made redundant in November and my duties were shared out amongst other employees, but the company is now doing so little business that these employees now work 9:30-5:00 when they used to be working 9:00-6:00, simply because there is that much less work to do.
SYZQZGesaa	Value is a funny word. Look at it this way: With SO many recently on the band wagon of buying gold, you must consider why that is. Could it be that they see a future market boom for gold? If so, the gol you have now is better kept. Is it that the US Economy is in trouble and that people are beginning to ask why the dollar has valuation at all when it is not on the gold standard anymore and why there isn't anything real to back it up? If so, the gold you have is better kept. In ANY case, no business is going to buy anything from you without a reasonable probability of a decent profit margin. That profit margin includes stock (your gold) + operating costs + loan interest to purchase your gold + a profit margin. When you consider all this, is there any possible way that you are getting the true VALUE for your gold? I don't think so. If you want some idea of the true value, it isn't hard to look up current ounce prices along with future projections.|`|82LusQuKaa	It depends!  Best to shop around.

The most in demand paralegals are those in the litigation field; followed by corporate paralegals who are responsible for maintaining corporate records, articles of incorporation, etc. While the "least" marketable [but the "highest" paid] paralegals are in the field of intellectual property [i.e., patents, trademarks] and immigration law. In conclusion, choose your paralegal courses accordingly, with emphasis on litigation preparation [discovery], docketing/calendaring of incoming pleadings [calendaring] and trial preparation [creating Exhibit tabs, Bajii jury instructions, etc.]. The "pro" side of a litigation paralegal is often "unlimited" overtime which can amount to a high salary range of $65,000 to $75,000 per year, while the "downside," being constantly pressured to meet a monthly client billable quota. And failing to meet that quota, often results in the paralegal's overnight dismissal. It's not a pretty picture. I just want to lay out what really happens in the real world of litigators and their relationship with subordinate paralegals.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

For example, Arena Pharmaceuticals (ARNA) is a company that is a penny stock that currently has a VERY promising new diet drug the FDA is about to rule its approval on (I think at the end of March).  The drug, Lorcaserin, is very similar in action to Fenfluramine (the "fen" in the old "Phen/Fen" combination that was so popular and effective for weight loss years ago).  Unlike Fenfluramine, Lorcaserin does not seem to cause heart valve damage that result in the old combination being banned (much to the dismay of fat people everywhere).  Research on the drug looks good and the FDA is VERY likely to approve that drug.  When they do, the value of ARNA will skyrocket.  There is a huge potential market for a pharmaceutical treatment for obesity and NONE of the current drug treatments really do squat (but Phen/Fen used to).<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.uberlock.com/Arena%20Pharmaceuticals.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.uberlock.com/Arena%20Pharmace...</a><br>  <br>  Anyway, that's just an example.

Just because you were approved for 200k doesnt mean you have to spend that amount.

qBCGH52haa	In a few days, the appraiser will submit the appraisal - if the house appraises for the proper amount (at least the amount you are borrowing and probably over that for equity purposes), the mortgage application process will continue.  If the appraisal comes in low, the process will stop until you either come up with more money, get the seller to reduce the price of the house or you can convince the bank to allow a new appraisal.|`|EXJfoGtAaa	Your appraisal will be submitted to the lender and if that's the last document needed it will be submitted to the underwriter.    realtor.sailor
L4rW2V9Iaa	Yes, you do have bargaining power.  You may have to pay a slightly higher interest rate, but you can negotiate the PMI.  Since you have a very high credit score, you can use this to your advantage.  Assuming you have had credit for more than 5 years and this is your 2nd home or major finance purchase, you should be able to get it taken off or at least lowered.  The lower your home purchase price, the better chance you have as well.  The banks see this as a better loss ratio for their purposes.  So let's say you wanted to buy a $500000 home and you don't want PMI with your specified credentials vs. buying a home at $150000 w/o PMI, the bank is more likely to "take a chance" on the lower purchase priced home than the $500K priced home.  If you were to default on this $500K home, then they would take a much higher loss (in theory).  That's what PMI protects.  Unfortunately, PMI does not protect the buyer, only the lender if the buyer doesn't pay.  It is a cash cow for lenders; it's basically their insurance plan.  It's like paying insurance on a person you don't even know - what benefit does it have for you, none.  I would try and see if you could save up a little more money to be at 20% of the purchase price.  If you do this, you will pay up to 30% less over the time of your mortgage term.  This can amount to thousands and thousands of dollars.  Did you know that PMI can add $100 - $300 more a month to your mortgage payment...think of how much you could be investing with this money instead of "throwing it away."  If you an get out of PMI, I would DEFINITELY do it.  SOme mortgage lenders offer this.  Do a global search on google for the specials that these lenders are advertising.  PMI can be better negotiated depending on the type of loan you get; never get an ARM or Optional ARM loan; you will have more bargaining power if you go for a fixed loan.  Bank of America had one of these "deals" a long time ago.  You can also do an 80/20 loan (like mentioned above) but many banks are no longer offering this option because it can put the bank in a loss situation since 80/20 liens can be separated and sold to other servicing companies.  First lien always takes presidence, so if a bank owns the 2nd lien, they will take the loss in any kind of litigation on the property.    Hope this helps.|`|AA11206283	no. It's required.|`|aOjMf5SPaa	Contact the FSA to find out what is legal and what is required.|`|kuO4oypZaa	You can get around it by doing a first and second mortgage, that's what I did.  The second mortgage would be 20% of the home value, so there's no PMI on the main mortgage.  They'll give you a bit of a higher rate on the second, but you can pay it down faster.  Besides, if you make extra payments on the second, it will soon go away and your total monthly mortgage payments will be lower for the remainder of the loan.

49740c9daeea677fc86801fb2b3f41deaa	Yes, they can. if she defaults on anything within the next 5 years her "transfer" will be called "hiding assets".    It is also a crime, she and your brother could be found guilty of fraud with this little scheme.    Your mother already has a lien if she has a loan.   Liens generally do not allow seizure of assets (although, some, like the mortgage do) while judgements usually DO, they are court orders to pay up.    If the judge that orders her to pay up finds out she is hiding assets from him he is likely to press criminal charges, starting at Contempt.|`|EXJfoGtAaa	If the trailer is the only security for the loan, then she can do whatever she wants with the land.  However, read the loan papers thoroughly as I suspect the land may be included.  Read the description of the security in the loan papers.  If it isn't and she has a lien or judgment filed it will attach to the land too.    realtor.sailor|`|qBCGH52haa	If a lien is put on the trailer, then she cannot transfer ownership by sale or gift until the lien is removed - by paying the debt secured by the lien.  Similarly, if the creditors get a judgment against your mother, they can attach the lot also.  If the courts are to rule that the transfer to your brother was for avoiding a seizure or lien, the transfer can be undone and the lien placed or a seizure carried out.|`|7qr2GprBaa	The only creditor who would have th right to sell the property would be the bank who holds the mortgage. Since she owns the property outright, then no one can touch it.     The only creditor who could sell the trailer is the bank that holds the loan, but only if she is in default of that loan. If the creditor you are referring to is not the bank that holds the loan on the trailer, then no, they would not be able to take possession of the trailer and sell it.    However, if there is a lien on the property, then the property cannot be sold until the lien has been removed and the title is clear. If there is currently no lien on the property, she should be able to transfer the title without any concerns because the title is still clear.     If there is already a lien on the property, she cannot transfer ownership without a clear title. If there is no lien, but a creditor is considering or has threatened a lien, they may be able to file an action to freeze her assets, which could prevent your mom from doing anything with the property. If they can legally do this, she would not be able to transfer the title of the trailer to your brother's name.    Your best bet is to talk to an attorney who specializes in real estate law for your area.|`|houWY7qvaa	If there are no liens or mortgage payments and it is free and clear, putting the property in his name may save it from creditors.  I don't know if that is legal though, depending where you live.  It depends on how much is owed to a loan company and how much the property is worth.  If the property exceeds in monetary value the value of the loan, I think would put a lien on something of a smaller value.  The best thing she can do is be straightforward with her creditors and offer a payment amount.  If they refuse her payments and return them, she should make copies to take to court with her showing intent to settle an account.  This is not a lot of information, but I hope it helps.  One more thing, if a lien or judgment is put on the house sometimes they would have you sell the house to repay the debt or wait until it is paid off and then get the remainder of installments as payment.  It varies.

Near the upper right corner of the page is a field where you type in the name of the internet business. If the business has been rated, you will get a listing of all the customer ratings, good and bad. If the company doesn't come up, then no one has rated them yet. And, I wouldn't trust them to be legit. That is, you don't want to be the first person to rate this company when you report that you just got ripped off.    This site is different from other rating sites in that most other sites allow company employees to post phony positive reviews of the company. To post here, you have to provide an invoice number for your purchase. They then contact the seller and verify that you made a purchase before they'll post your review.    I went here before buying an LCD TV a couple years ago. I looked up a couple places that had the cheapest prices and found a lot of reviews saying to avoid these places.     The common theme was that they say a TV is in stock and then do a high-pressure sales pitch for an extended warranty for like $500. If you didn't buy the warranty, they would tell that it will ship in a couple days. But, if you call to inquire about your purchase two weeks later (after not receiving it), they tell you it's on back order. When you check your credit card statement, it's already been charged. And, everyone who reviewed the site said they had to just cancel the order and never got their TVs.    Other sites had very good reviews. I went through one of the recommended sites and got the TV for about $500 less than at Best Buy, with no tax and free shipping. The TV arrived 2 days after I ordered it.

JxpT4PlZaa	I would recommend joining the forum below.  Read through the old thread I've linked.
vqdurAA5aa	Most brokerages have multiple options trading levels, but what is allowed in each level varies between brokerages. Your brokerage may not have separate trading levels for a cash-secured short put and a naked short put, in which case granting a higher trading level would allow you to make more dangerous naked short puts.    You should also understand that brokerages have different requirements for equivalent trading levels. For example, one brokerage I know has income level requirements for each trading level regardless of the size of your portfolio. Your broker should be willing to tell you what the trading levels are and what the requirements are for each trading level.    -----    As an aside, I will note that the risk-reward profile for a cash-secured naked short put is identical to a covered call.* Even if you cannot sell the put you can get the same return for the same amount of risk by buying the stock and selling a call option with the same expiry and strike price.    *There is an exception to this rule. If it is impossible to short a specific stock the rule does not apply.|`|BdE5niY3aa	every broker has their own rules.|`|aCDWwsisaa	Because you don't have enough money to cover the maximum decline your broker anticipates is a "realistic possibility", and he/she does not want to end up losing money, since you are not covering it.

The laws, written in the days of fixed commissions and only full service brokers, don't allow you to have a truly "self directed" account.  The broker still has some burden of watching over you and being sure that you understand and are capable of dealing with the risks of the strategies that you are undertaking.  These laws also provide a foundation for whiners who don't want to take responsibility for their actions to sue the broker saying "You should have stopped me!"  You're probably not like that, but the broker doesn't want to take a chance.|`|9r2SBjA1aa	what is a naked|`|wcOq60Hhaa	The short answer is that your broker doesn't think you are a good risk.    The long answer is that you generally have to qualify for "very risky" investing strategies like naked puts one at a time before you try to execute them.   Although I do not have first hand knowledge outside of my own firm, I would be surprised if any brokerage allowed you to execute a naked put without...guessing...at least $100k in assets in the account...maybe $250k...?      If you have at least $100k in your account, complain to your broker...he can explain the logic at his firm.|`|375ffaceecee2420f9e38aba060fb989aa	Selling a naked put option leaves a large potential loss but even with that they could close your position before your account approached a zero balance, or place a reserve on the funds to purchase the shares if they were put to you.  Buying a naked put is synthetically the same as buying a covered call.  Brokers are screwing in that they will allow buying the covered call but not buying the naked put.. Most are mired in neanderthal plodding thinking  Not all brokers are so screwy though and some are even educational.

At least you will have started a paper trail by doing so in case anything happens in the future.|`|O8qdCBzLaa	You asked this yesterday and it still doesn't make sense. People are coming to your house because they said that this was the arranged address to pick up a free computer. But, they have no idea who arranged for them to come there to get the computer. And, all they have is an e-mail address?    One of these people should be able to provide more information than that. They must have seen an ad somewhere or got an e-mail that they can forward to you. I can't believe anyone would be so terminally stupid as to think that an anonymous person could somehow get the message to them that says "go here to get free stuff," and they would do it without any other information and without questioning anything.|`|tDC896Ubaa	Put a letter on the door or something.

Just because she can does not mean it's the thing to have her doing.    $4000 is way too much money for a laptop.  DELL offers a kick-butt gaming laptop (with all the bells and whistles) for $1400.    A computer is well within bounds for the kind of thing your student loans can cover.  If you abso-darned-lutely gotta have the computer right-darn-now and can't work the money through Financial Aid, go talk to your bank.  Most banks do direct student loans anymore and their rates are pretty close to those of the government sponsored loans.    BTW - please REPORT all of the scam loan spam you're going to get.  These bums are all Nigeria advance fee scammers.  Nobody legit would use a Yahoo or Gmail or Live address to run a financial firm.|`|AA10072911	You should try going to your local bank and applying for a loan.  There are websites you can go to and apply for a loan, but they also require you to then go to the bank after you are approved to finish the transaction.  Going straight to the bank cuts out the time delay.
09b317729060c9dedb69f8059c07c3d0aa	Not necessarily, and in some cases, not at all. In Canada, you can only call yourself a "dietitian" if you are a Registered Dietitian (RD). This means that you have a 4 year degree, a 1 year internship, and are registered by your licensing body. Much like how doctors and nurses must be registered.    Some "nutritionists" are people who took the RD program but have not done their internship. In this regard, *much* of the same educational background would be the same, with the exception of clinical practice in a medical setting such as a hospital. However, if you are just looking for basic healthy eating advice/weight loss advice, you may get the same advice in either case. So it wouldn't matter. That said, if you have Diabetes, Crohn's, Celiac, etc.  or any other medical condition requiring specific medical dietary advice, you would want to see an RD.    The problem with "nutritionists" (at least in Canada) is that they are not regulated like RDs. Anyone can pretty much call themselves such. So in theory, a person who takes an internet course or one semester university course in Nutrition 101 or "healthy eating" can say that they are a nutritionist. Again, you have no idea what you may be getting, and that can be a serious concern, especially for those who require medical dietary advice.     Some "Nutritionists" may be well educated and great, and may refer you to an RD if you need education that they cannot give. However, since they are not regulated (like RDs), there is really no guarantee or standard of what quality of information you will get.    In other countries, the two names may be both registered professionals and the names interchangeable. If in doubt, call the local licensing body for dietitians.

3mAgM405aa	Here's a short list of jobs in the U.S. which you can create to generate income:    1. Learn calligraphy so that you can provide handwritten invitations and thank you notes to prospective wedding parties, birthday celebrations, etc. Seek out clients through wedding planners at nearby churches and temples. A starter calligraphy kit usually runs around $20 and anyone can easily pick up this skill. The going rate is usually $1 per hand addressed item.    2. Seek from your neighbors a gardner position which involves planting, weed removal, plant/tree trimming, light brush clearance. You will be using the neighbor's equipment and tools. Again, do not represent yourself as a lawn mower since there are any number of safety issues involved. A door-to-door solicitation of surrounding neighbors is required and you can charge between $6 to $9 per hour.    3. Offer policing/removal or clearance of trash services to surrounding neighbors which involve trash pickup within nearby residential area. Limit the extent of pickup to small areas and be aware that there are no hazardous terrain or elements involved in this process. Again, a door-to-door solicitation of neighbors is in order. You can charge between $6.75 to $7.50 per hour.    4. Acquire a set of window cleaning tools [a bucket, liquid window cleaner, sponge, squeegee, handle with an extension and a small step ladder] and solicit local businesses for your window cleaning services. However, be careful to limit the height of the window cleaning to no higher than one story. Charge $1 per window panel.    5. Visit your nearest beauty salon and ask to be trained as a shampoo person who is also willing to sweep up fallen hair on the ground and do set ups [arranging dye kits, curler holders, etc.] for a set hourly fee.    6. Become a sign flipper by contacting your nearest realtor. A flipper is someone who stands at a major intersection and flips a "For Lease/Rental" sign in order to attract visitors to an open house or to a particular real estate listing. The hourly pay is at least the minimum wage.    7. Why not become a paid feeder servicing the disabled at nearby nursing, convalescent, assisted living/care centers and hospitals. It involves feeding food to patients who are unable to feed themselves. The starting rate is $8.00 per hour. The only downside is that one has to take precautions to wash one's hands after each feeding. A posting of your services [by a business card or flyer] on a reviewable bulletin board would be enough to generate customers. The paid feeder position is one of the fastest growing occupation at this time.    Good luck!|`|3wCn5xTDaa	I suggest you to try project payday, simply because you don't need any money up front and you can start making money within minutes.

It also depends on what you are considering as a minimum household income.  If you live in California, a minimum household income of $50,000 won't buy you much of anything given their extremely high prices.  However in a State or area not so expensive you may find something.  That is just an example as I have no idea what your income is or where you live.  You didn't give us any information to base a real answer on.

YupMCYHlaa	75% of people who live like that in the US inherited their money.  So go pick a better set of parents. 8^)    Of the rest, your best bet is to graduate from an Ivy League university in the top 5% of your class, in a field like medicine, law, or finance.  Then work your butt off and rise up the hierarchy.  Make some good contacts, then get some investors and start your own firm.  But it depends not just on hard work but also on luck.    We have a very persistent myth in the US that anyone who works hard enough can get rich.  While it does take hard work, it also takes a certain amount of luck.  It means not just going to the right college but also the right high school and elementary school.  So you still would be much better off if you were born well-off so you could get good schooling when you were young.|`|SALWkdUvaa	To get rich I think you can either:  * Choose a career path and stick with it so by the time you retire you have plenty of money if you spend wisely and invest. That's possible with any job that has upward mobility where you can eventually get the position right above you. Trouble with that is it takes too long.    * Come up with something new or a new way to use something old. Reaching customers is no longer that hard in the 21st century, it's more what you have to offer them. Facebook is really Myspace made user-friendly. Wikipedia is really Encarta Encyclopedia but free and organic. Add to that list YouTube, LinkedIn, Twitter: they don't even charge for their services but get their money from advertisement.    * Inherit or marry into money :)|`|EjhE3mOSaa	Ways you can get rich:  1. Become a high paid person (doctor, lawyer, banker, fund manager (sucks now)).  2. save cash and invest it in real estates (best thing to do now).  3. Marry someone wealthy.  4. Invent something or become a star (sports, entertainment etc).    In my area almost every single house is over 1 million dollar so its not really upper class. You can afford such house, and have a fine life with around 4-5 million dollar (net worth) or a constant income of around 300K a year.|`|0yqQg9CXaa	google  forbes list of richest people  you will see that a lot of them have degrees from   Harvard Business School.

So get rid of your debts, save money and invest. Take a financial class like Dave Ramsey's "Finance Peace" . It's not just for people who have huge debt.

kgUzdfqVaa	In this climate, I would really recommend staying in education and getting some good skills to leave school with so that you can get a great job.  Sounds to me like you don't have any real career plans which is not a great start. Try going to your careers adviser and getsome inspiration!  I left school at 18 and voted with my wallet so got a job. A year later, I realised that I wasn't doing something which made me happy so I went to get further qualifications and am now very happy.  My advise - if this is about money - be patient.   If you honestly don't see yourself in education anymore, at least check out jobs where you can see yourself developing and getting more training.  Probably not the answer you were looking for, but I hope it helped!

Capital One offers this type of savings account without a minimum balance.  However, you can only have 3 transactions per month.  What I do at the end of the month is take all but a minimum and transfer it from my checking to my money market account, which I can do online.  A certificate of deposit (CD) must stay in the account for a minimum amount of time and you can't access it without paying a penalty.  And regular savings accounts generally don't offer very good interest rates.|`|s4Ok4PGyaa	You can do both.  Banks such as Suntrust and Wachovia offer CD's that work as a saving but with a better rate of return than a regular saving. Acts like a CD so you can't touch the money until after the cd matures, but works as a saving takes the money out of the account every month.  Best to have your money in an account that is non touch and also have a touch account just in case of emergencies
qGfAlDd2aa	Route sales are sales made on a route.  Some companies concentrate on the "sales" and some on the "route".      Here's an example.  We have a company the services our First Aid supplies.  We are assigned to a route so we have the same person come by every month.  She gets commission off what she sells.    Another example is the person that services our floor mats.  This person does not do any selling, however the company makes money by selling his services on his route.    So, you need to clarify what the company wants you to do.  I would assume it would be like the second example.

Anything more than that and it comes across as narcissistic. <br>  <br>  You should list 2 or 3 weaknesses. NOw make sure these are true. Sometimes people make up stuff that sounds like a weakness and really isn't, "Keep a tidier desk", "Type a little faster" That lame. But ake sure the weaknesses are things that EVERYONE has "I tend to underestimate how long it takes me to do a task/assignment", "I find taking criticism difficult", "I need to listen more to ideas from others" Then explain how you plan to work on these weaknesses and overcome them. This is music to a manager's ears. You're saying it so they don't have to. Makes them feel like they don't need to spend a lot of effort supervising you. It really works!<br>  <br>  Also, say something positive about working there, "This is a place I truly feel I belong" "I enjoy a high level of job satisfaction here" You get the idea. <br>  <br>  Best,<br>  -- Liam

Chase is the largest by assets followed closely by Bank of America and CapitalOne is about #19 by asset size.

CapitalOne is much smaller with 700  bank branches and over 1,100 ATMs in Connecticut, Louisiana, New Jersey, New York and Texas.  CapitalOne generally offers higher savings rate on products like CDs and does cater more to auto loans,home loans and credit cards. I am sure there are numerous stories both good and bad regarding the service for each bank, but the choice should depend mostly on the services you are looking for from the bank.

Look for one that has an outstanding history in the town that you live in or around.  See if they were on the banwagon of giving everyone a home loan or stuck to a more strict policy.

SHRxkXPLaa	It depends on your employer. At my job, the pay period ends on a Thursday, and I get my check the next day, Friday. I don't think many employers do this, though. I believe that most will have the pay period end the week before, so that the payroll department has a full week to process paychecks.|`|HS7qRRiWaa	Generally if you get paid every other Friday the pay period for that pay check was from the week or weeks prior.

Risk assessment of investments is entirely different aspect, more difficult, and a critical one because it is related to return.|`|ghelbcVFaa	The same way the big boys do for the most part. I can only speak of myself, but here is what I do based off of personal experience and I try to keep up with Fortune and Money magazines.    The level of diversification of the portfolio (don't invest everything in one stock) and what you are invested in. A couple examples:  1. I invest all my money in a stock on Monday. By Friday it's worthless, I'm wiped out. If I had invested equally I'd only be down whatever percent of my portfolio that stock held, but I'd still have a portfolio.  2. I could own 10 stocks, but if they all were banks I'd be hurting pretty bad right now. Same could be said for many internationally traded funds, certain currencies, etc. You want to own different sectors. Consumer staples vs tech vs industrial, etc    Use a stop loss order when you buy stocks. Determine the level of money you can lose. Let's say it's 5% of your investment. Once you buy a security, submit a stop loss limit order with your broker that is GTC (good till cancelled) at 5% below the price you bought it at. This will automatically sell the security when (if) it drops 5%. Example:  1. I buy 100 shares of a stock trading at $1 per share. I enter a stop loss limit for $0.95. When (if) the per share price hits $0.95 the broker sells the stocks and I'm out $5 rather than the $20 let's say it goes down.    Of course, you are a step ahead if you do research on any investment you make before you invest in it.|`|NEjjNmfyaa	I would identify risk profile as how much you're willing to lose at one time as part of the pursuit of your long term goals.  You can manage it by setting a downside target when purchasing an investment and selling if you drop to that target.

e2e426c7412c57bd7f104afda806b223aa	There are a number of part time jobs that could be considered "fun". These include taste tests, or focus groups. You can find these under Craigslist jobs under the Part Time or Etc category. Or you can be like me and sign up with an agency that regularly conducts focus groups. Typically you can be paid anywhere between $20 to $125 for one session. One of my favorites was when I got paid $30 for trying out two different flavors of vanilla ice cream and I answered a brief questionnaire on which one I liked better. In the past I have also done questionnaires on breakfast bars, instant noodles, chocolate brownies and others.    I have been a mystery shopper. You get to choose the retailer. I've been to OSH and bought some paint from the counter and filled out a questionnaire on my experience. I only got $12 but it was an interesting experience nonetheless.    You can sign up to be an extra in a film. Here in San Francisco we have organizations like SFCasting.com or BeauBonneau casting that specialize in extra work. You pay a fee of $30 and they keep your information on file. When a producer needs an extra they contact the agency who then contacts you when there's a potential match. I was in "Pursuit of Happyness" starring Will Smith in the BART scene when he is coming down the stairs running from the taxi driver. I have a brief case in my left hand. It was really neat working alongside Will Smith and an experience I'll never forget. I didn't get paid much for this gig, only $150 for 13 hours of work, but at least I have the memory (and I'm on film!).    You can be a part time teacher like a substitute. I'm currently subbing and get $125 for the day. In California you can get a 30 day waiver and do a little subbing until your waiver expires. It's not terribly difficult work and it might even be fun for you.    If you have a special skill you want to share with the rest of the community you can be a teacher at your local rec center. Here in Foster City, you can charge whatever amount you want per person for your class. Some people do scrapbooking, others teach tennis, some teach ballet, financial planning, real estate, home repair, karate, painting, it's up to you. Keep in mind the rec center will charge a fee to use their facility and will take a small commission, usually a percentage of the per person fee. This can be fun and rewarding for you too because you can schedule the course at a time when it's convenient for you, you can control where the class will be held, and you control the course content. And of course you'll get paid!|`|3mAgM405aa	Check out census.gov for temporary positions as a census survey taker.  It's pays $17 per hour and the hours are very flexible.

The court appoints an administrator called a trustee to review the case and determine if there are any assets of value to sell for the benefit of creditors.    The trustee may used several methods to value and asset.  Sometimes they have professional auctioneers who conducts thousands of auctions to give them an opinion.  For cars, they might use Kelly Blue Book.  For real estate, they might use a real estate appraisers.  Sometimes, they even use Craigslist or just rely on the debtor's word.    Your relative should contact a member of the National Association of Consumer Bankruptcy Attorneys for a consultation.

fFnsJ7maaa	The Black Tuesday crash was so deep and fast because people were acting out of panic. The further the market went down, the faster the trading became, forcing the market down even further. No one was buying. Massive amount of wealth was lost. If trading had been halted, then the panic wouldn't have built to the level it did. Trading would have been more orderly. At least that's the theory.|`|BlVudiyfaa	Ultimately the outcome would of been the same.|`|7HKTDcvYaa	A large amount of stock had been purchased on margin, and as the market started its dive, those who were on margin just had to sell immediately.  Had they been prevented from doing so, would they have a claim against the market?    Well, let us assume they were going to have trading halted if the market started a major slide. Now the margin holders know full wel that they, as individuals, must beat the bell, they  have to get their junk sold before the market closes.    When the markets open again, the same group of margin holders are joined by almost everyone, in a mad dash to get out, and of course only a few can before the market again slams the doors shut. We could mitigate this surge for the exit by limiting the number or the dollar value of securities that can be offered for sale each hour. But would that have driven investors to buy? Would you go out to the market to buy knowing that it is in controlled freefall?    So, if nobody is out buying, what sets the price? Lurkers who put in bids that are ridiculously low. I mean prices that are half what yesterday's market sold for.    Those ridiculously low prices would attract bargain hunters, and so we might carry along with our market at half yesterday's prices. That is actually good,is it not?

I've seen lots of properties when I was looking to buy foreclosures that had everything stripped out of them, even interior doors, wall heaters, and even the shower heads. And, the kitchens were completely stripped down to bare walls, no cabinets or anything.    The seller just has to include in the transfer disclosure statement that the stove doesn't convey. They should probably also include that in the listing, so they can't be accused of misrepresenting that fact.|`|lLm5uIuDaa	In any State there is no law that says appliances have to be included.  It is entirely by choice of the seller. It's not wise to sell a home without the appliances these days but it's not illegal for a seller to want to take them.  Years ago everyone took their fridge but now everyone leaves it and it is expected in the sale unless the buyer doesn't want it.  But no one takes their stove or dishwasher.  There is no need.  Every home comes with one whether you like the one there or not.  You just buy new.  Kitchens are highly important to the sale of a home and if the kitchen has been updated it is assumed everything in the kitchen is there for the new buyer.|`|FVFxE6owaa	It's definitely not illegal to sell a home without a stove.

48f495e3bdaf92f8f08e2d21903199beaa	The advice concerning the "poor man's patent" is incorrect.  According to 35 USC 102(b) you can't get a patent if "the invention was patented or described in a printed publication in this or a foreign country or in public use or on sale in this country, more than one year prior to the date of the application for patent in the United States."      So once you start selling the invention, you only have a year to file for patent protection.      Secondly, patent infringement suits cost on average $2 million per side.  A $50K retainer isn't going to get you very far.      So, what should you do?      You might file a provisional application and then try to obtain funding.  A provisional application only lasts one year at which time you must file a non-provisional application in order to obtain protection. But, a provisional does not have formality requirements and has a low filing fee ($100). This strategy may be dangerous, however, due to the complexities of patent law.  So, getting an attorney or agent to help you may be best.      To get a patent attorney or agent to write a typical application for you will cost between $10K-$25K+.    Make sure you read up on patents.  I think you will find that the US patent process is more expensive and complicated than you may have originally thought. If your invention is useful, you probably want a utility patent. If you want some idea as to how complicated it is, here is the rule book examiners use to examine applications: http|`|TpMvr1pyaa	I love this type of question.    I invented the "poor man's [patent" 40 yrs ago; you go to a notary public  and you offer a typed statement as to what your invention is.  Anything that you would normally file with the feds.    bring ID.  they notoarize it.  YOU then have a poor man's patent.    YOU can state or prove you invented this thing when you say so.  [unofficially of course]    then, you go make it and sell it and earn $    when you have $1m net profit from it, then return to the  patent atty and give him a retainer of 10k to file the  proper patent papers.    Yes, someone can steal it now.....the law is  when you have a patent you must protect it and  be able to go to court and sue for patent infringement; which  costs a min of $50k retainer.    My way is easier and as reasonable as anyone can be.|`|jhsxaggxaa	Patents can be hard to get and can cost a-lot of money.You will have to go through many steps.

dC6A5R5Saa	General Electric is heavily undervalued.  The company made over $17 billion net profit last year.     On the Reuters website CEO Jeff Immelt, 52, defended the dividend, calling it "a good return to investors in this moment of uncertainty. But we're not straining in order to pay it ... We've got lots of cash."    I don't think GE will be above $18 overnight, but I think it will be above that sometime this year.  Last year after the market fell in October, I read on the bloomberg website that Warren Buffet had bought into GE.

Your bank is not going to take the retail value of it.      Most likely, you are upside down in this loan, if you have only had it one year.

To register a trademark, that's done either through your Secretary of State for a State trademark or the US Patent & Trademark Office for a Federal trademark.    If you are only performing in one state, then a State trademark is likely most appropriate. If you perform (OR are planning to perform) in at least 2 states OR between the US & any other country, you can file for a Federal trademark.    Prior to investing your time, money & effort into a name, it is strongly advised that comprehensive research be conducted to ensure that the name you're interested in is truly available.    This entails searching the pending & registered Federal and State trademark files as well as the US National Common-Law files.

The only way to protect your name is through trademarks.      In Exxon Corp v Exxon Consultants International Ltd (1982), Exxon tried (but failed) to persuade the court to prevent Exxon Consultants using the name Exxon for a non competing insurance business. The Court said if it is not possible to claim copyright over a name, even though Exxon had paid substantial amounts of money to have the name developed for them.     If you don't first check that the name is available for you to use, a trademark owner with better rights could require you to stop using your business name.  To avoid the potential hassle of trademark infringement and passing off, register a trademark.     You can apply to do this yourself, or use a Solicitor that specialises in intellectual property law.

Bonuses and other irregular payments are subject to withholding at a statutory rate of 25% regardless of what you put on your W-4.  Changing your W-4 will NOT affect the withholding on the bonus.<br>  <br>  Congress changed the law on withholding several years ago to put an end to the type of abuse that you are proposing.  People would change their W-4 just before receiving a bonus and then switch back afterward.  The problem is that not enough tax was withheld so they wound up owing money at filing time because no tax was withheld on the bonus.  In many cases the tax debts ran into thousands of dollars so Congress wisely slammed the door on that type of taxpayer abuse of the system.

Due to this, the production of goods and services was affected and people started spending less money fearing that they would be the next to loose their jobs. All this lead to a situation of Recession in United States. This condition spread to the entire world through the stock markets as people all over the world were responding pessimistically to the situation in United States  by selling off their shares in the stock markets in their respective countries. This was specially true in case of companies which were associated with the Finance Industry. The ongoing problem of Inflation added fuel to the fire and worsened the scenario.

As far as I am aware once you are registered you cannot un-register.<br>  <br>  When VAT registered you must charge VAT on everything you sell, but you can reclaim it on everything you buy in.<br>  <br>  Its not clear what VAT you want to get back. If you mean you want to reclaim VAT on your purchases, you should have been doing that as you went along. If you want to backdate things you need advice from an accountant. <br>  <br>  But if you mean you charged VAT to your customers and paid it to the taxman, and now want to claim it back as if you were not registered, then tough. You collected a tax from your customers on behalf of the taxman. It never belonged to you so you can't claim it back. If by some quirk of fate it was decided you should not have collected that VAT you would have to pass it back to the customers who paid it. You wouldn't be able to keep it for yourself.<br>  <br>  Other than the small amount of VAT on your profit being VAT registered should not have that big an impact on the prices your business charges. When not registered you don't have to add VAT to your prices, but your costs are higher because you can't claim back the VAT you pay. When you register you have to add VAT on to your prices, but you can offset that because your costs are now lower because you can claim back the VAT you paid.|`|Zca1PGERaa	contact a chartered accountant|`|rTLmZzjnaa	Simon outlined it well.<br>  <br>  One thing he mentioned I thought I'd elaborate on: You can voluntarily register for VAT. For certain businesses this may not be very useful as it means you'll have to charge your customers more. However this would helpful for businesses that get goods from a manufacturer or if you buy merchandise or stock. If you register for VAT you can claim back the VAT on anything you buy in relation to the business which can save you a lot of money. So depending on your kind of business, you may want to stay VAT registered.<br>  <br>  In terms of you paying VAT accidentally – did you charge your customers VAT? If that's the case, in simple terms all you should have done on your VAT return is say how much VAT your customers paid over that period and send their VAT to customs and revenue. You can't claim this back and this is normal. However, if your customers were not paying VAT, you should phone HMRC on 0845 010 9000 and explain about the situation. They're very strict but they may be understanding to the situation and allow you a credit on your next VAT return.

You will have to work the number out yourself to be sure.  But for starters.    16 Hours at minimum wage is less than the personal allowance so a small amount of extra earnings would be tax free.  Once you reach the 6,000 to 6,500 level of annual earnings, though, the following kick in.    Basic rate tax is 20%.  If the second job is with a different employer you will probably not have to pay any national insurance.    The tax credit abatement is 39%.  This means that for every 1 extra you earn you will get 39p less tax credit.  This has the same effect as paying an extra 39% tax although it will not be deducted by the employer.    Taking these two together you effectively lose 59% of the extra earnings so are left with 41%    Now for some complications.  Firstly, the tax credit deduction will not apply for the first year.since they are based on your earnings for the previous year.    If you are claiming housing benefit or Council Tax benefit then these may be affected to.  You need to put your details into an online calculator such as the one linked to below.    You may find you are left with a relatively small amount for the hours worked.

It was a 4 day recogition meeting for mortgage reps.    Todays Associated Press story about Wells Fargos recognition events is intentionally misleading. The event is not a junket for executives but a four-day business meeting and recognition event for hard-working team members who made homeownership achievable and sustainable for borrowers across the nation. In 2008 alone, the team members who were invited to this event and their colleagues produced $230 billion in mortgage loans for U.S. homeowners.     Through all economic cycles, our recognition events have been an important part of our companys culture. Late last year, we cancelled recognition events for 2009 except those where the financial commitment was so great that no meaningful savings would occur by cancelling these events. We had scaled back the mortgage event, but in light of the current environment, we have now decided to cancel this event as well. We do not plan to have any other recognition events this year.    The Associated Press story also misleads readers by implying Wells Fargo used the governments investment to pay for these events. As weve said before, weve used the governments investment to lend to creditworthy customers and to help homeowners avoid foreclosure.    Since credit began contracting 18 months ago, Wells Fargo has made almost half a trillion dollars in new loan commitments and mortgage originations. Last quarter alone, we made $22 billion in loan commitments and $50 billion in mortgage originations. That's more than $70 billion or almost three times the amount of the U.S. Treasury's investment in Wells Fargo -- which has begun to benefit from our performance through the dividend we will pay to the Treasury this quarter.
e1jgTlEMaa	Phone and ask to speak with the Human Resources manager or the hiring manager.  Indicate that you are interested in being kept on a pending list, should a job arise.  Ask where you can send an updated resume, and offer to come in for an informational interview.    If you can make a personal connection and keep in contact over the coming months, all the better.    Good luck!

DorePwVOaa	Get a saving account at a separate bank from your checking account. One of the online savings accounts, like ING Direct, Emigrant Direct, or E*Trade's savings account would work well. It takes three days to transfer money between that account and your checking account, so you will have to think about it and wait before you can spend money out of the account. Also, the government doesn't let you transfer money out of a savings account to a checking account more than 6 times a month, so that will prevent you from spending, as well!    Also, these accounts will earn more interest than a regular savings account, so that will help you reach some savings goals, as well.

Look into FHA financing.  FHA loans are eligible to people with less than perfect credit as long as you've had a good clean year of credit history.  Looks like you've had 2 years.  You should be fine.  Your fiance can only be on the loan if she's had her bankruptcy discharged for 2 years.  Otherwise, you'd be the only one on the loan.    Obviously there are other factors you need to look at like DTI, Housing Expense, Property Condition, ect, but if you have a 3.5% down payment you should qualify for FHA financing.    On another note, if you are a veteran or a member of the armed forces, you could also be eligible for a VA loan.
mQZDizMVaa	Boomers were the largest generation born between 1946-1964, post WWII. Overall, we are now reaching retirement age between now and within the next 5-10 years. If it weren't for the present economy, boomers would retire in droves; on the other hand it depends on a boomer's financial/family situation, and whether or not they've planned for it early in their careers.    Some worked the same job straight from h.s./college for 25-30 years only to be let go when their company either closed or went under and they lost their pensions, i.e. Enron; some may have worked in public service with a solid pension plan/benefits and depending on their years of service and title, can afford to retire.    At the present time, most cannot afford to retire, which means they could be in the workforce indefinitely.
QSmfOUndaa	I understand - I worked at a job for 7 years and then I was laid off and couldnt find my resume and couldnt remember my information. It was a pain but I figured it out using a combination of the following methods.    1. First write down the names of the companies you worked for and get phone numbers for them. You can look up their phone   using the yahoo yellow pages and/ or Hoovers.com  to help you with your search.    2. Once you get their phone number call them and tell the receptionist that answers that "I need to verify employment for Your Name". Usually the company's receptionist will transfer you to their Human Resources or Payroll Department. Then you just tell the clerk that answers "I need to verify employment for Your Name" again. This is the very same way that a Loan Officer or New Employer would verify your employment. Sometimes the HR/ Payroll clerk will ask for your social secuirty number to find your information - this is a common practice used for security - you can give it to them. Once they find your file they will tell you your Job title and dates of employment and you can ask questions about it if you need to.      NOTE: Sometimes the receptionist will give you a phone number to an outside company that keeps track of their employees files for them, instead of transferring you to the Human Resources department.  These companies charge a fee to verify employment, however getting your own employment information should always be free. When you call these types of companies make sure to let them know you are calling to verify your own information. Sometimes these companies will give you the employment dates by phone and other times for privacy reasons they will only mail it to you.     IF YOU CANT FIND THE PHONE NUMBER FROM YOUR PREVIOUS EMPLOYER: Try to see if the employer went out of business, or got bought by another company. You can sometimes yahoo or google the employer and a  news or business article will come up telling the story of what happened to the company.If it was bought by another company you can try verifying your employment with them. If the company went out of business and there is no contact info then try the steps below.    3. If you cannot find the company at all then you could try and check to see if you have your old tax statements - W-2's etc. and then would at least know the years of your employment. As a last resort you can contact the Social Security Office and ask for a "Request for Social Security Earnings Information" Form. They will mail this form to you and then you complete it and pay them a fee of anywhere from $20-150 depending on how many years back you need them to go and they will send you a list of your employers with dates. This usually takes about a month.    4. FOR OLD ADDRESSES : Order a copy of your credit report. A lot of times they have address over 20 years old. I reccommend paying for one at Experian.com(usually  around $15) Dont use the free credit bureau sites as they do not always include the address history information.     Hope this helps.|`|47TJ6JsZaa	Regardless of the status of the company you worked for, you were still employed - your resume is a snap shot of you and not the companies you reference.  City and state will suffice and use only years (2001-2008) as specific months can confuse the reader with trying to determine  if there were any gaps - also gaps are a red flag so leave out months to avoid bringing any such gaps to the attention of the interviewer...leave the explaining of the company's status for the interview.

If you are currently unemployed, an interviewer may contact your place of most recent employment.    Fo a resume, all you need to list is the name of the employer and the city/state. Also, I don't recall ever seeing a resume where past home addresses were listed.     Unless you're applying for a federal (CIA or FBI) or some law enforcement jobs (where I know they look deeply into not only your past but your family too), you do not need to concern yourself with the fine details on a resume.

You can check your credit yourself once a year and it will not hurt it. It also does not hurt if certain other people such as landlords, companies investigating to see if you're good enough to send a new credit card offer to, etc. check it for normal reasons. I used to own a home, and had it refinanced, and that credit check did not hurt my credit. I had to do it again when I got divorced and my X bought me out of the house, and that didn't hurt it either.    I'm not a pro, and I could be totally wrong here, but I would guess that it should be OK to do what you are describing. If you have a copy of the credit report from the mortgage, and it is within a short period of time to getting the truck refi (one quarter I think?) then you may be able to use the same report without having to pull it twice, cuz the info on it will still be current enough for the lender to use. You should, however, find out if your lender only needs only one credit agency reporting, or reports from all 3.    If you're still unsure before proceeding, just ask your lender. A good lender should be able to answer your question correctly.     hope this helps|`|zqWuMcclaa	Why dont you just pull it yourself for annualcreditreport.com before they do that way you can correct and fix what you have to fix then you dont hurt your score when your yourself checks it?

676d10c0f66a8a7b48b37a6ef35a74ccaa	I live in the Chicago metro area and I've had a similar situation.  I too am a host of that same damned leech, Countrywide.    Any rate, you need to contest the assessed value with the government body that assesses properties.  In IL, we have a county assessor who determines the housing prices based on market conditions, sale prices, and other similar properties.  Thus, you need to fight fire w/ fire by showing that your house is worth less on the market using the same qualifiers that the assessing body over there does.  I don't know how California assesses and taxes property owners, but the county treasurer takes the assessor's info and generates a tax using a goofy formula.    The problem that occurred w/ CW is that they demand a 'cushion' of something like 16% of the total cost of escrow over the course of the whole year.  I'd need to look again at that monthly statement, but they figured in a rise of my insurance premium and property taxes and divided that over 12 months.  Then looking at the current escrow payments, they then see the rises and falls of the escrow balance due to my monthly payments and the pay-outs for the taxes and insurance.  The month with the lowest monthly balance is singled out and checked to see if it is at least 16% higher than the entire escrow cost being divided by 12.  Whatever amount it is deficient in, that's the amount they raise your escrow by.  So if you would normally drop negative in escrow, they jack that up until your 16% above the otherwise lowest payment. Then watch your monthly payments increase.    So this year I am screwed big time, my monthly payments went up by $300.  Not so much because my taxes increased, but my insurance premium increased too.  I was able to get some of that fixed, but I'm still hurting.    So they easily turn around with the 'the escrow is not our problem' bit.    Baby is crying, gotta go.  Good luck!

cs4n4Fgzaa	Public relations is the management of the flow of information between a company and the public. A lot of businesses have their own internal PR departments, or they may hire a PR firm to handle the work. Public relations is not the same as advertising... PR groups are responsible for managing how a company is depicted in the news, making sure the company has a good public image in the community. That might include press releases about changes at the business, or arranging for an executive to speak at a major industry conference, or coordinating a sponsorship of a community event. Advertising is about getting consumers or businesses to buy a company's products or services.

If all how ever many million of us were on the phone to the IRS about a delay, they would not be able too process anyone's return.  I am in the same boat as you.

Everyone is worried about the economy and this is not helping by having our money kept form us longer.  Anyone who says "sit back and wait" evidently does not have  a family, already has their money or is rich to begin with.  So many of us in this world need this money and it is not right.

The IRS MIGHT have an answer, but certainly people on Yahoo don't....|`|Cs8wsgvUaa	What about those of us in the same situation with Feb 10 given now instead of 10/30 or Feb 3? that did not qualify for the recovery or EIC? I qualified for the first time homebuyers credit.    Maybe the Taxact program made a slight mistake somewhere?  And when I called the IRS  last week I was told my funds have not been released no problems as far as I know.|`|BKSSAzEkaa	I called the IRS, I asked " how come my tax refund has been pushed back three times?" His replay " I don't know way refunds are being pushed back." Thats all he coulf gove me. Then he went into my record and said that my expected refund should be on the 10th but most likely deposited on the 13th? i was like WTF that makes no sense. So I called my tax preper and she said it has ro be deopist on the 6th if it show the 10th on the website. If not to call her back so she can find out whats wrong because my refund was accepted and processing.|`|6SpPtA5Waa	Well we should all have an anwser today or tonight. The IRS sends deposits to the bank on Wensedays for Friday postings. That is the way it has always been. Sometime today or tonight the website should update again and all of us that had a date changed last week should get the " A deposit is being sent to the bank blah blah blah....Good luck all.

m0a7Ox1maa	it's being paid thru your tax return for last year    made less then 80k and declared it on a tax return = bonus|`|O5DPuy3daa	Yep - you will get it - it is paid through the tax office.. You will get the $950 in the method that u got your tax refund, so if you got a cheque you will get a cheque. If it goes ahead.
4eTyCuRSaa	ditto to the answer above|`|PxoKseAiaa	You can take it to the bank that the check is drawn on.    Or you can pay hefty fees at a check cashing place.|`|oYF3K8R4aa	Yes, unless go go to an expensive check cashing place or have a bank account at a differnt bank.|`|c5xiQ5gMaa	You can cash it in BOA since you have an account, but make sure you don't owe BOA (account in the negative). If you owe BOA money, they will deposit it in your account and hold it for days... if your account is in good standing you can go to your bank to cash it. If don't want to cash it at BOA, you can go to Walmart or the bank that the check is drawn on and pay fees.
