Somehow I don't see how everyone thinks that he'll be a hero, like Gerrard is for Liverpool. Not many people would have known him, let alone mention to buy him last season, and the only real time he shone was in Euro 2008.     Time will tell on how good he really is.|`|peiDzZfRaa	Yeah I think it's great that Arsenal have landed such a torrific player like Arshavin, it will make the Premier league much more interesting now. If Arsenal can start getting results and United, Liverfool and Cheski drop, anything is still possible, although in all honesty, the whole 4th spot battle between Villa and Arsenal is more likely going to be the realistic fight come the end of the season. I love the Arsenal team, its brilliantly packed full of talent on paper, just so yung that is all. For me they are the team of tommorow for sure, as long as Wenger holds on to them that is. I'm a United fan but a very honest one lol|`|nGpBuI9Oaa	totthenam offered 20million but they wanted around 26million, and monday night zenit called up teams from premier league including man city and totheham to offer higher than 12mil but nobody wanted to pay higher|`|tM2MN5NOaa	Its the same old story - all about money - If nobody esle had shown any interest in him he`d have gone to "Spurs" others showed interest so he and his "agent" sat back and waited - he new he`d have to pay his former club 2m and "he wasn`t going to pay that - so he waited to see which sucker club would - now we all know who that club was - they`ve paid 2m extra over the asking price - now there going to find out was he worth it or not.    Most players would go to any club in div: 1 if they would pay his wages etc. Remember "Shearer" Southhampton to Blackburn - said they were a sleeping giant and all that crap - still good luck to dear old Jack Walker - he bought the league that year. Kaka never moved because he would lose "all his endorsement payments" other wise he`d have gone to MC. with those payments he doubles his wages - thats the only reason he didn`t move.  Still if you and I had the chance - we`d do the same.......theres no loyalty anymore its only and always has been about money. and don`t worry my friend "they" might send him out on "loan" like MC has done after spending 18m on a player - why buy him in the 1st place.......you could`nt make it up.|`|tfotPdeZaa	hahaha u make me laugh. and seriously all u gooners are going on abuot how great he is, but u guys watched him play what 3 times???|`|WdOAxQmoaa	well said lassy ;)|`|PD3qATQtaa	Well I think your argument is a valid one but I wonder if Arsharvin looked at the league table and realised he may not be playing champions league football next season with a "top club".|`|6aKd0Kcjaa	linzi,the  spuds are not worth a toilet roll so i won't listen to them|`|5c0ea2e937929dc820b4f96293aa83a2aa	In the Summer Spurs offered 18 mil.. But Zenit Wanted 20.. Arshavin agreed all terms to come to spurs but Comolli wouldn't Spend the extra money..... i was a bit annoyed at the time Considering we had just go 50 mil for keane and berba... However  i believe us not paying the amount is probably a good thing as he is clearly a quality player but not 20 millions worth....      Also im not too bothered if you think we are in your shadow... maybe we are... But all the arsenal fans i have met have nothing on passion for their team compared to Spurs... were you all not asking for Wengers head two weeks ago cos you felt he was dragging you down.... Please.... Im not bitter or Jealous.. I love my club and a team from SOUTH of the river will never change that... Regardless of league positions...      Peace... Just so you know tho.. Rivalry aside... You are a muppet..        Edit.. I will have t write this here as you emailed me but dont allow emails back... Dont try and take the moral high ground... You have been digging at me in your answers to my questions all week.... And i dont have any real problem with anyone on here. but if people give me sh!t.. i will give it back....|`|TKDi70uTaa	zenit played spurs like they played the gooners, 1 month to sign 1 player is hardly anything to brag about. we will see how good he is but he has been crap for a while now. as spurs well know spending money on foriegn players is not always a good move.

Tarzan ..... the Lakers "barely" squeaked past the Knicks ????? clearly you did not watch the game ..... the Lakers were up by 20 with about 2 minutes to play.  Knicks got the score closer in garbage time.  the Knicks never challenged the Lakers in the 4th ...... get a clue .... THEN post.|`|GswnLKtQaa	It's about the points scored, and no one has done it before kobe break the record it's that simple.    bryant - 61  king - 60  jordan - 55  james - 50    let's just enjoy the game.|`|3teWTOPqaa	how selfish was Kobe? It was a specular performance, no one on the court can stop him, if you have that kind of a night keep it going. Plus Kobe made good passes, but shots just wasn't falling for his teammates.    EDIT: also explain this, Lakers are 2nd in assists this season so how can you have a ballhog and still move the ball so well, actually Lakers have been in top4 in assists for the last 4 years now.     EDIT: Cavs are like 19th in assists, what does that tell you when LeBron is averaging almost 45% of the entire team's assists? (the answer is he holds on to the ball).|`|io3hggzZaa	i dont give a damn. he is a beast.|`|jHJ0W9QNaa	exactly. did you notice how Kobe scored 61, yet they still barely squeaked past the lowly Knicks by only 6 points? Kobe Bryant can score all the points he wants, but he won't make his teammates better than doing that. without Bynum, the Lakers have lost their defensive presence and have become irrelevant.|`|wKGZ0h8Paa	You just realized that Kobe is a ballhog now?|`|BiMkowVMaa	How did one game make the Lakers fall into another year where kobe does everything.    Pau Gasol must've had the quietest 31 point, 14 rebounds and 5 assist 2 blks ever. Odom had 14 rebounds, 4 assist and 3 blocks. Ariza had 13 pts 8 boards.    Must of slipped yer mind huh?!    EDIT: The Cavs are ranked 19th in ast.     http://sports.yahoo.com/nba/stats/byteam...    You may watch basketball, but you don't know your stats.|`|kFcdwVwdaa	hey tarzan did you even look at the score. they won by nine points for one. they were up by twenty when kobe got off the game and all the reserves for the reserves were in the game. "barely aqeaked by" lol ha you are a joke.   why is it that no one asks why mj wasn't a ball hog in his early years when he was scoring like that. when you have it you have it and you cant do anything about it.   lebron is a beast i like his style. but its not his time yet. i give him maybe next year or the year after. that will be his time or wades but kobe will nearly be out by then so its ok.  why not just congratulate the guy instead of hating on the guy. you pay him anyway.|`|Mn97YDIyaa	Kobe was on fire, and when you're on fire, you just keep going. The coach even tells you to keep going until you miss. Some other Lakers weren't even shooting too well when Kobe did pass.    Lamar Odom: 2-9  Jordan Farmar: 2-6  Josh Powell: 0-3  Sasha Vujacic: 0-3  Vlad Radmanovic: 0-2    Pau Gasol and Trevor Ariza were the only other Lakers shooting well (Derek Fisher was 1-2, but he didn't take too many shots)|`|qaz33UnNaa	are you kidding? kobe (in comparision to other years) does barely anything on that team. maybe you know that the lakers supposedly have the deepest bench in the NBA today. gasol odom fisher ariza vujacic i mean if kobe did everything himself, why did gasol make the all star game?|`|b0eYeLG1aa	61 points there is no time for assists and  rebounds|`|Bd7Qfjggaa	he is a ballhoggplain an simple|`|98wFqBwSaa	I agree with you 100%|`|aUGM3ju6aa	Wade > Kobe|`|2AQZtdyiaa	Yea it sad to see a player get 61 points with no rebounds or no steals and only 3 assist and only beat a garbage team like the knicks by 9 points. In kobe's eyes there is definitely an I in team.|`|xsabcrllaa	no he used to be a balhhog ill admit he did hold it a tad to much last night but when he gets going u cant stop him so if u were a lakers fan last night u should have been happy that got that big w no matter by how much pau gasol put up over 30 and not getting rebounds doesnt mean ur a ballhog that means he actually didnt go for the ball and he did get assists he is still a little ballhog cuz he rests the game on he shoulders when its unneccesary and he shoots to much he shot it 31 times but he s still one of the best talents in the world right now|`|2xAeOB8Baa	Thank you. That's what I've been saying all along. He was been a hog last night and not a team player. There was no need for him to score 61 against the Knicks. He should have gotten other players involved last night.|`|WUzgGtAAaa	Kobe was on fire. When you are that hot you gotta keep shooting. stop hating.|`|AA11827493	When your best player is shooting that well, how can you not let him shoot it all the time?  The guy was feeling it.

There are no "10's" as of now. It's not that there are no talented players to play this position; it's just that it's not a position that is used in today's style of playing.    Nowadays the trend in soccer is that teams play defensively and then counter-attack hoping to benefit from defensive errors by the opponent.    That's why since a few years ago, I've been gradually losing interest in soccer.    Probably Cuauhtmoc Blanco is the closest there is nowadays to a "10". A good example of a "10" was Benjamn Galindo.

This question has come up many times.|`|2HFqoUPcaa	The calculations for the Table are performed as follows:    Each team scores points based on the results of their matches.   Each team's rating is equal to its total points scored divided by the total matches played. (Series are not significant in these calculations).   A match only counts if played in the last three years.   Matches played in the first year of the three-year limit count one-third; matches played in the second year count two-thirds; matches played in the last year count fully; essentially, recent matches are given higher weighting.   To determine a team's rating after a particular match:   Determine the match result (win, loss, or tie)   Calculate the match points scored:   If the gap between the ratings of the two teams at the commencement of the match is fewer than 40 points, then:   The winner scores 50 points more than the opponent's rating   The loser scores 50 points fewer than the opponent's rating   Each team in a tie scores the opponent's rating   If the gap between the ratings of the two teams at the commencement of the match is more than or equal to 40 points, then :   The winner, if it is the stronger team, scores 10 points more than its own rating   The winner, if it is the weaker team, scores 90 points more than its own rating   The loser, if it is the stronger team, scores 90 points fewer than its own rating   The loser, if it is the weaker team, scores 10 points fewer than its own rating   The stronger team in a tie scores 40 points fewer than its own rating   The weaker team in a tie scores 40 points more than its own rating   Add the match points scored to the points already scored (in previous matches as reflected by the Table) and determine the new rating.|`|GdJTQX6raa	the methodology adopted is bit long and space may not be sufficient here. the basic is who plays whom, home or away, no of overs consumed no overs delivered..what was th target .run rate dipping steady or lost all the wickets. runs scored on power play, without power play like you know it is like a chaotic puzzle. it goes on .

W16vpnlZaa	the first day  i would just go into the pool and relaax a bit swim a 100 at a slow pace.  then swim like 250 at a really good pace.  give yourself a 15 min break  and then sprint a 50.  and then swim another 250 pacing yourself.    and then the 2nd day  swim like 400 for warmup  and just pace yourself each day  but keep pushing yourself.  that'll do the trick    i always do that like ifi  haven't swam ina while before swim season|`|tU98LCX6aa	well swim as far as you think would be fine and comfortable for you i mean that's wat i would do when i started swimming|`|rXuSL76saa	like 1000. maybee a little over or a little less.|`|zCpvK7N9aa	Go swimming as often as possible and swim until your muscles are tired.  When your muscles get tired that means that they got more exercise than they are used to.   Eventually you will be able to swim longer and harder over time.  This is what they call "conditioning".  Basically you ease your way into shape.

eDCyle05aa	I usually get Brooks because they spend all their technology/money on making running shoes. I don't really like Nike, Reebok, or Adidas because they make all different kinds of shoes, they make good shoes for all sports, but Brooks make excellent shoes just for running. Here is a great discount website that has a lot of running shoes(including Adidas if you would want to get them): http://www.holabirdsports.com/m/Running/...|`|OQb533GPaa	Look up a store in your local area that does gait assessment.  It doesn't necessarily matter what brand of shoe you wear, but what type of shoe it is.  Everyone's heard of the generic "running shoe," but what a lot of people don't know is that there are different types of running shoes.  I used to love NIKEs until I got a pair that just made my feet hurt.  After going to massage school I learned that there are different shoes made for different people.      There are running shoe stores out there that will do an assessment on how you walk (whether you pronate or rotate your foot in while you walk, if your flat footed, if you overextend your gait, etc) and they can determine what kind and brand of shoe you need.  I found out I was wearing shoes 2 sizes too small.  They will also teach you about what to look for in shoes when just looking out and about elsewhere.      The place I went to gave me a discount on my first purchase there as a thank you for coming to their store.  Good luck on finding something and God's speed ;)

C0sT0PPyaa	Everyone wants their loses off there record.  its not possible so you turn to yahoo answers for the magic wand? hahaha.  the reason you don't go into a fight with a game plan is in case you run into something unexpected.  you took a fight with a muay tai champ, what did you expect some chump who knows nothing-why would you fight a chump who knows nothing and how tough would you feel if you won?      what you need to do is create your own league so you can be 200 and 0|`|6a3172c489600c432a5b3ecd4bc4bb96aa	Amateur records don't mean a damn thing.. no seriously, they don't.    What you are dealing with is a normal part of the procedure, somtimes you are going to lose and get outclassed by guys who might be Amateur at MMA, but done well in other things.    Additionally, get someone to find fights for you. Let your coach help set up fights that don't require you to make ridiculous jumps. Also do your research on who you are fighting.    But most of all, don't stress. If you are good at MMA then naturally someone is going to want to bump you up into some Pro matches and you can start to make a name for yourself.    Don't beat yourself up over anything while in Amateur ranks... because Amateur records don't mean a damn thing.    Also if you find yourself dealing with a crappy promotion, avoid them. Or set up fights for them. Network and find other fighters your weight class out there in your general vicinity and set the bout up with them, offer the fight to the promotion.    Do some legwork yourself.    Also while you are at it, google FASFA. You should fill out paperwork for Student loans and get yourself an education. There is a good possibility you will never make much money with MMA, you should have a solid back up plan.     But keep in mind there is no "records" for Amateur fights. They aren't kept anywhere or counted for anything. Put together wins, tape highlights (I know plenty of high light tapes of guys who used parts of matches they lost, but showcased their skill).    Readers Digest: Don't sweat the small stuff, find good fights and fight your best.|`|RR7UX4jkaa	Let your anger/frustration inspire you to become the best. Get stronger. You can do it. Never give up.

AA12022635	I think he is going to play in the Pennsylvania penal league for the next 3-5 years.|`|rC6RD8Wcaa	i read that rumor somewhere i dont think the eagles would be willing to give him anywhere near what he was getting in Indy so i dont think it will happen i think he will go somewhere else that is more desperate than the eagles|`|GZpwkL1Vaa	The Eagles would certainly be interested, they have alot of cap room that they are looking to spend, and he is the type of reciever they are looking for. Not to mention that they have tried desperately in the past season or two to land a big name receievr in free agency or through a trade (Larry Fitzgerald, Randy Moss) The real question is if harrison would want to go to the eagles, because he's clearly not just looking for money if he wants out of Indy, he is far from underpaid. I think the main reason he wants out is becuase he's the number 2 reciever. On the eagles, he would be that number one that terrell owens was, without the baggage. This could be a good match.|`|B8sJEBxTaa	Well seeing that he plays well against the Patriots, I'd love to see him in a Patriots uniform :P<br>  <br>  Anyways, even though he is aging, he still is a good receiver. Even with his lost speed, he can still catch, which is what the Eagles' receivers lack. As long as he does not ask for a huge contract, then Harrison will bold well in an Eagles uniform.|`|d99df786deb3c1bafe03741880e7fdd1aa	Marvin harrison is going to be 37 next year, and he will be dealing with getting sued, and raising his kids, a few of which are named after him.|`|qU78Ng3yaa	Harrison migh retire but if he were to sign with the eagles then I believe he would fill in that needed receiver position imagine McNab and Harrison wow|`|lCR8d2hraa	As an Eagles fan I would love this at the beginning but I would eventually think of it as a bad thing, I have watched him for many years as Peytons right hand man and watched him become a legend. But his time is almost up and I wonder how he would do in the cold late in the season as he hasn't had to play in the kind of conditions that Philly is known for late in the year except for the Steelers. I would just soon that they take a their second 1st round pick and Lito and Trade them to the Rams for Torry Holt, Dane Looker and Alex Barron, and it would give us a chance to see Jack Ikegwuonu in action plus we have Joslio Hanson, so we would be set either way.|`|e00627d6bcb03c3c3a41eb2fe611f647aa	that would be a bad pickup for the eagles. Harrison is at the end of his career and is not the same WR he used to be. The eagles are talkn bout gettn houz of the bengals and he could be the missing piece to the super bowl. Not harrison|`|aG0PtaK4aa	They should. Harrison has been cast into the #2 spot in Indy. In Philly he would at least get most of his playing time at #1. He went to college with McNabb and he is from Philly. What do the birds have to lose?

6Efhd6lNaa	Yes it was. The ball came out of Warner's hand and then he pushed it forward in the air. He didnt have control of it while his hand was going forward. Thats a fumble.    And yes hell be back next year.|`|pSOrIUYsaa	@ Kobra Status: No if it was ruled incomplete; the 15 yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty would have pushed them up to the 29 yard line with 15 seconds left, so it is no longer a hail marry AND with Larry Fitz red hot, they proved they could move the ball on the 2 previous plays there could have easily been another touchdown. And I do think it was an incomplete pass, his arm was moving forward. As for the other question, yeah, he'll be back next year.|`|C2CCbTRKaa	YES,EMPTY HAND!!|`|ITq5FNXuaa	no it was incomplete|`|sBdOzbx5aa	I thought it should have been ruled an incomplete pass or at least they could have taken a little more time to come to a conclusion.  It doesn't matter because they would have needed to complete a Hail Mary for the W.|`|g2Xadc0gaa	yes Kurt Warner will play|`|kGur839Daa	not sure...it was really close. he lost control but by definition it was probably an incomplete pass because the ball was still in contact with his arm and it was moving forward.|`|85ab2af63fb56f9dc602cf0b2db9849eaa	It was a fumble.    Woodley had his hand on the ball and Warner did not have control of the ball anymore. Just because his hand came forward doesn't automatically make it a forward pass.    Anyway, the Steelers were smart to quickly get on the field and snap the ball before a reply review could be called.    Haven't you seen a team hurry up and snap the ball so it couldn't be reviewed before? I have many times.|`|F5dXqU78aa	Yes it was, I still think it should have been reviewed just to remove the questions about it, but yes it was a fumble.|`|AA11407605	Fumble, and I was rooting for the Cards.  His arm wasn't coming forward when he lost control of the ball.  Lousy way for it to end, a hail mary to Fitz would've been the greatest end to a Super Bowl ever.  sad it'll only happen in Madden now.|`|JWXSRnA5aa	yes|`|a6EndAPiaa	Why do people keep calling the fumble the last play of the game?    The last play of the game was when Big Ben took a knee.    The 2nd to last play of the game was a fumble.  Empty hand moving forward = fumble 100% of the time.  They could have reviewed the play for 2 weeks it still would have been a fumble.    I think Kurt will probably play but who knows?|`|bed9746a7bf18f598324f858a93ae28eaa	you know and i know and all the pitt fans know it is but wont change anything, refs still won the game for all those non calls on pitt|`|3yvuMkzTaa	The play was reviewed, & I agree that it was a fumble.   It wasn't the last play. The last play was the Steelers taking a knee!!!|`|AA12103453	It was a fumble. The whiners can say what they want, and I'm not talking about you but certain other people on the site, but you can see where the ball is CLEARLY loose before his hand comes forward. Anyway I think Warner plays for the Cards next year. I think he wants to play another year and I don't think he would want to pack it up and move.|`|huHOpRLLaa	honestly   why do you care wat others think   even if a million ppl in the world thought it was a incomplete pass  that doesnt change anything  the referees know what their doing  they had to train to become what they are  so their not dumb   they know what their talking about and when to foul ppl and all that stuff   so it was what they said it was    even though i thought it was a incomplete pass too   it wasnt   and im mad the cardinals lost  = (  but oh well|`|XaFYUMRSaa	The ref's called it a fumble ,so it was a fumble.    Yes He will be back.|`|NG4E7pbuaa	Incomplete pass...the officials should have replayed it.       KW will be back in Arizona.|`|dnwJmNkdaa	I think warner will play again next yr.      and i think it was a fumble its an empty hand moving forward.  the ball is rolling off his arm and launches forward off the force of his arm.    I think officials should still have taken time to review it, and definitely to explain it|`|gU4VdD6Oaa	It was a fumble. Game over.|`|96zZlJVYaa	no, it wasn't a fumble and it was incomplete pass. the ref up in the box should call in on that play but they just sat on their rear end.|`|58TDAT1zaa	Fumble since he had control of the football and it got knocked out of his hand.  It was going to take a miracle for the Cardinals to win at that point, but It would have been exciting to see one more play with Kurt Warner passing the ball.
SkN2NqpGaa	My favorite light-weight tent for short stays (two or perhaps three days) is a simple tarp, but for extended stays I will use a Eureka "3-man" dome if I am alone in the tent. If there is someone with me, I use a "5-man" or larger cabin-style tent. Even when the car is used to get to the camping site, I pack minimally.<br>  <br>  Here's a tip, and very much worth paying close attention to: Whatever brand/style/type of tent you get, if it is a "3-man" tent it will actually sleep one person comfortably. The only way a "3-man" tent will sleep 3 people is if ALL of the gear/supplies -- stove, food, packs, water, etc -- is kept outside of the tent. I do not enjoy having any of my gear or supplies rained on or pawed through by the night-time critters.......<br>  <br>  General rule-of-thumb: Subtract at least two from the number of people the tent is supposed to be rated for. In your case, I suggest at least a "6-man" tent. Unless you don't mind waking up to find your supplies have been pawed through while you were sleeping.<br>  <br>  When Eric Sevareid and Walter Port made their historic canoe trip from St. Paul, MN, up the Minnesota River, across to and down the Red River and then across to Hudson Bay (in 1930; Sevareid was 17 years old at the time), they used a 2-man canvas pup tent. But then their supplies were also kept in a large, heavy, wooden box that could be locked shut. The story of that 2,250-mile trip, and many of the mistakes they made, is told in "Canoeing With The Cree"<br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Canoeing-Cree-Eric-Sevareid/dp/0873515331/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1235366999&sr=1-2" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Canoeing-Cree-Eric...</a><br>  I suggest that you read it before embarking on any serious canoeing adventures.|`|l0opvMfGaa	my favourite light weight tent is trojan|`|h2KkiKK3aa	a tarp with a smaller one as a floor, you basically string a line from two trees or posts, spread out the smaller tarp under it as the floor, evenly slide the large tarp over the line and line up the holes for the tarps and peg them down, really light and can be made to any size or shape if your creative.<br>  make doors from smaller tarps or pine/spruce boughs, cord and branches as supports.

When he drives towards the hoop there's really not much anyone can do, like an NFL running back going through a weak defensive line.  So I guess he loses a little respect due to a lack of finesse.  In my opinion he's the best in the league though because on top of the offensive skills you also have a great defender, rebounder, and playmaker.|`|yoh34atoaa	He's overrated because he's so cocky. <br>  He's young and thinks he's all that. <br>  He thinks he's the best player on the team, even if he is he's still got a fat head. There's a reason he's not won a Championship, he's a ball hog. I'm a 13 year old girl  and I can figure that out!|`|T1rtfe2Xaa	there jelouse because they suck

Skating dress/ skirt would work but I usually don't wear those to practice. And then a sweatshirt or fleece with any old shirt underneath. Then you just need gloves, guards, tissues, and a bottle of water. That's what I usually wear/ bring with me! Ohh and you need really thin skating sockies or tights..i forget what they are called but you can't just wear thick socks.|`|HmwTBAZCaa	buy them. If your coaches were anything like mine DONT WEAR JEANS. I got kicked off the ice because i wore jeans the first few times i skated. Your going to have to buy a skating skirt or sweat pants and always wear tites. Do NOT EVER wear socks, and a typical sweatshirt... Oh and make sure you wear gloves if you dont your hands will get extremly raw and chapped.|`|E05LFRhaaa	k first option  -buy some tights and skirt and or dress  or  -yoga pants a t and a jacket or hoodie  or  -leggins and a t and a jacket or hoodie  or  -sweats and a t and jacket or hoodie    basicly you want something warm yet comfy and easy to skate in make sure your warm tho!you don't want to get to cold and layer so that you can be a comfy temp the wole time but if your just starting you wont be moving much soooo dress warm.have fun and good luck!|`|NQrMOj19aa	Butters: Figure skates.

Because if it is, just wait and see if it is any good and if you like figure skating with just some protective clothes and easy to move in (jacket, jumper, long pants...) don't rush into buying, they'll probably tell you what you need anyway.    If figure skating isn't what I thought it was i just made a fool of myself...
AA11764538	Sure drive up to any ranch and see if they want a hire hand.  If your serious get in contact with agricultural groups to network for this type for job.  People usually hire people they know since you are working with their pride and joy.|`|h2KkiKK3aa	your in the right category.<br>  you can either go to various ranches and ask if they need help or go to life stock and produce markets/auctions and ask around, put a flier on the billboard and you'll get some calls if they need you, just be ready to work and never complain, because it's a tough job and they have no time for slackers.
ySwnTzdsaa	Lacrosse is the fastest sport on two feet, so yeah, I'd say the training is more intense. Not only are you running as much, if not more than soccer, you're doing pushups and upper body work all the time.|`|uU15o7Mbaa	soccer involves more running

Canadian citizen and NBA MVP|`|Q0mNfLLyaa	If you are talented enough, the NBA will find you.  I'm 6 ft and skinny too.  I'm 40 years old now.  I realized in my twenties that if I focused on getting better at my skills and put the time into practicing them, I could make great improvements.  I was always able to grab the rim, but could never dunk.  Then, I looked at some "jump trainer" shoes in the back of basketball magazines.  I didn't buy them, but realized how they helped you jump higher...they just kept you on your toes without your heels hitting the ground.  So, for a while, I spent 5 minutes about 3 times a week walking on a treadmill backwards on my tiptoes.  This is all I did.  I felt stupid as heck, but within a few weeks, I could dunk.  It probably added 4 inches to my vertical.  A few years back, I started doing some dribbling exercises that I found on the internet.  My dribbling improved.  I also used to get stripped a lot when driving to the basket.  I learned a few things to help this just from paying attention to better players, and talking to my friends.  The most important was not to force myself into areas where there were a lot of defenders.  The more you move defenders around as a team, the more opportunities you have to drive or pass into the middle.  Moving the ball quickly around the perimeter and setting screens in the right places help open up the middle.  I learned that a high, slow dribble is much easier to poke away than a lower or faster dribble.  I also learned to protect the ball more with my body, even while dribbling.  One other thing.  Many people just practice shooting during warm ups.  Once I started practicing shooting, dribbling, passing, and defense during warm-ups, I learned I played much better during the early part of the game.  There's a lot of good tips out there.  Read books, watch videos and other players and just use the stuff that works good for you.  Hope this helps and Good Luck!

lCR8d2hraa	Its a recruiting violation entailing both speaking with high school prospects before you are allowed to, ie calling them in their sophomore year, or trying to recruit a athlete before you are a confirmed member of that schools staff.

HZvdr8VLaa	Beagles are not retrievers.  A beagle is a hound that will track the rabbits and run them in circles , when the beagle catches the scent of a rabbit it will trail the rabbit, when the rabbit circles back to evade the dog, you bushwhack it!!   But the beagle won't pick it up and bring it to you, clean it or cook it.  That's on you, Bud.|`|0tpLq6meaa	Forget it. It can't be done.It is not in the nature of the breed to retrieve, just trail and run. When I was younger, I made a squirrel dog out of one of my beagles. I could kill squirrels with him but I had to be there to see which tree he bayed up. I was never able to get him to stay at the tree until I got there.It just was not in his nature to do anything but trail.|`|dpSr0icwaa	the above poster has it right.  You are training the dog to do something against it's nature....that is why eventually dog breeders had to use genetics to get that task accomplished.<br>  <br>  Oh, you can train your dog to do it, but it would be easier to train him to use the toilet himself.|`|4pLEDSejaa	I agree, it's going to be a very hard and frustrating chore. The dogs I used to hunt with would come up to the dead rabbit and have no idea what to do with it. Most of the time they would walk over it, keep on the trail, and try to figure out if there was another. You had to about drag him away from the area. <br>  <br>  I would be spending more time training him to follow scent. That will pay off more in the long run.|`|3b8557f01cef58611c2e78e57d57b1e5aa	All three (3*) of my Beagles Retrieved Cottontail Rabbits, Grouse, Pheasant, and Woodcock naturally for me.*
2nmFFFQ4aa	The only correct answer is whichever ones you hit better and like more. They are both excellent clubs. I know people that play either ones and they both swear theirs are the best irons theyve played. Before you buy, make sure that graphite is right for your swing though. Especially with irons, there is a huge difference between the results from steel to graphite. If your swing is regular to fast (accurately judged by a proper fitting), you would be better off with steel shafts. If you need a lot of help getting the ball up in the correct trajectory, go with the graphite. Either of these club sets come in both.|`|sBrummATaa	to me the sumo's are the best, but thats me|`|Wa7wktLkaa	the burners.
MnjOXJnJaa	they better not... he's exactly the kind of has-been the Giants sign after their productive years are over. as already stated, Aurilia already fills that "need."<br>  <br>  what they need to do is sign Manny, like, a month ago.|`|AA10987824	Why must the giants try to copy the A's for EVERYTHING?<br>  <br>  btw, how's Zito working out? haha.<br>  <br>  can't wait for that usual interleague sweeping of the giants....|`|gMTatFZBaa	Why would they go after Nomar, they already have enough players for the DL.<br>  <br>  (x reported)|`|AA11720887	No, Nomar would only be good for a contender. A bench player at that but if you don't play him every day, he still has some talent. Actually a team like the Dodgers would be helped by him. But SF is far from being competitive. Use him like a mentor. Maybe the Cubbies.|`|l3ZUVqB7aa	No because they already have aurilia to come off the bench|`|v9bTfQGMaa	I don't think they need him, plus I heard the A's and Phillies are trying to get him.|`|Rz9vY53Aaa	no la should sign him for a year deal|`|YPQTXOQ5aa	Nope, because they do not need another older player on the bench. They signed Aurilia again and I don't think that Nomar will add much to the Giants. Plus, I think that he will sign with the A's.|`|z4Vpi48Raa	Thats a tough one.. He is aging and injury prone so if they want him it would probably be for immediate impact. A long term contract would not make sense.|`|a9d1c39e771753ee705728da48b7614eaa	I think I should after Nomar..... I need to go BAD!

dDhTMacAaa	By the way, I agree about Eric Snow, or at least an impact assistant coach.<br>  <br>  <br>  I agree with LeBron is most ways, because Delonte is a great player and really helps the team. A good shooter and also a tough player that will drive the ball to the basket.<br>  <br>  <br>  BQ: Well, news has it that Amare was never really being heavily shopped, and the Wizards and Clippers probably wanted a lot for Jamison and Camby respectively.<br>  <br>  The Cavs like JJ Hickson a lot - no deal was made.|`|WLXFAeSnaa	Yes. He is the missing piece.<br>  <br>  And yes, I think it was smart of the Cavs not to make a trade!|`|vzH7f7V5aa	Yes Delonte was the missing Piece. That was A VERY WISE decision. I'm glad they didn't make any Trades.|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	Absolutely, why mess with a team chemistry that is doing that good?|`|MPz9APZDaa	I thought they should have traded, but just to be safe, you know, if it's a good deal, then sure, but if it's just a maybe so they made the correct decision. <br>  <br>  But West is a beast, but I don't know if that's the missing piece to win it all.|`|wXxJUnLJaa	Yes, Delonte is our missing piece. Our defense intensity is better with him, & so is our offense.<br>  <br>  Question: I think it was VERY wise for them not to take any trades. Reason why because is because we don't lose any of our team chemistry.|`|b492423af2d29fe3c720b5001a69bd89aa	He is a big part of their rotation and played well tonight but beating the pistons isn't that big a deal these days lets see if he is a difference maker vs the celtics/magic.|`|H8u7gMAYaa	It's still to be determined.<br>  <br>  I think they should of gone after a Jamison. But they seem to be fine right now.|`|kmBdx2koaa	yeah hes a really good shooter nice game he had against the pistons 25 points|`|9Injuk2zaa	yes Leprachaun will take them past Celtics!!!!!|`|k5TKF2rRaa	yes|`|GY3QTszgaa	mr phenom is on crack??? thats what his name should be|`|82Vo9DXCaa	they tried to trade for shaq but phoenix didnt accept, but look at how they're doing, doesn't really look like they need a trade.|`|xhHfXuKFaa	i don't think so. they lost too the lakers at home even when bynum was out. and beating the celtics is not exactly a walk in the park... and no.. i don't think it was a smart decision not too make a trade. they need another good player.|`|3teWTOPqaa	No I don't think so, according to the injury list you guys are also missing Pavlovic and Eric Snow. I am kinda of surprised that LeBron doesn't know his own team that well.<br>  <br>  Yeah it was a good decision why mess with something that has worked out so well?

EjamKiaeaa	My favorite non-wwe finisher is a styles clash + angel's wing hybrid slam. Non-WWE right? you place opponent on powerbomb situation, then lift half way for a styles slash pose. Slam him with the styles slash, and then immediately pick opponent back up. Hold rear back and lift and then drop with the angel's wing while clutching both arms of the enemies. My second favorite finisher is less complicated, F-5. ^^|`|5oaOOquXaa	The    long     kiss     goodnight    by    Mickie   James<br>  <br>     DAMN      I      miss      that     from     her.|`|41WXZPnCaa	Mi Top Five<br>  <br>  Cop Khilaaaaaaahhh!!!(Homicide)<br>  Brainbustaaaaaaaaaa!!

M0qoqvJbaa	Intermittent sprint/runs.<br>  <br>  Mix up long distance running with timed bursts of sprinting.  It wreaks havoc on your lungs, burns lots of fat, and is about the only thing I've found to replicate the exhaustion that can set in, in the ring.<br>  <br>  It couldn't be more simple, but it is by no means easy, all that matters is how hard you push yourself.|`|iJ8MQ5HZaa	rosstraining.com|`|osPstl3jaa	I totally agree with Nick with running and stints of sprinting. I also would suggest skipping rope and swimming. Skip rope is good for building stamina as well as strengthening fighter's legs to last a long fight. Swimming is easy on the joints, builds stamina, and develops muscles in upper and lower body.

Lol0iLfgaa	Yes, but I would STRONGLY recommend not using them.  It is way to easy to get injured.|`|65e0c93e39fac0974cefe1be5c93b58daa	Yes, you should burn more calories - you weigh more, therefore it takes more energy to move you the same distance.<br>  <br>  But as others have suggested, there is an increased risk of injury.  If you do feel the need to add weight, why not use a weight vest?  It distributes the weight on your torso, so there's no added risk to your joints.<br>  <br>  Or, just run a little farther.  Lets say you weigh 200 lbs and are thinking of adding 5 lbs to each foot.  That's a 5% increase in weight.  If you're running 10 miles every day (which is ridiculous, but for the example is a handy number), 5% increase in distance is only 1/2 mile.  What sounds better, increasing your weight, risking injury, and having to pay for more equipment, or simply running for 1/2 mile farther?|`|1UID5JtNaa	yes but it's not recommended.  If you want to burn more calories vary your workout- interval training, long runs, hills, stairs, sand.    I've found that a 3 day cycle works best - the high intensity workout followed by the longer workout followed by an easy day.  You can do the long one after a shorter interval day but it's difficult to do the opposite- a long day then an interval/hard day.  .|`|OHs8yJiOaa	Yes, but you'd technically burn more calories if you weighed heavier yourself, too.<br>  <br>  The extra calories you'd burn per mile would be minimal, and the risks would exceed the rewards. You'd get a lot more out of walking for five to ten minutes for a warm-down.|`|zEoRcL91aa	I think there is enough pressure running without the use of weights. I have lost around 500 g per week on a good running programme of between 50-55 km per week at an easy tempo.

I am one of his biggest fans, but I gotta to say what's right.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	I agree with MC about Wade.  He shoots the ball 30 times tonight, scores 50 and they lose.  He still leads the team with 5 assists while scoring half the teams points, which can only mean one thing.  Most of his points did not come as a result of someone passing him the ball, or they would have gotten the assist, which means most of his points were as a result of him just hogging the ball and shooting all the time, without even including his teammates.<br>  <br>  What does that help a team, if you're playing 1 on 5 and trying to be the whole team when you're losing by 20+.  Kobe is the best player on his team, and one of the best in the league (some will say LBJ is better, others Kobe) so I don't think he can be overrated.  I mean, if people think you're the best, and you are, how is that overrated.|`|BfwzbKSoaa	Dude, he missed one freakin layup today. Big deal, it's only one. Don't exaggerate one into too many.

HZvdr8VLaa	I prefer my Glock 21 (.45) ... Glock is a wonderful and dependable weapon.|`|OAEuYZkZaa	If you like flatguns, either would be a good buy.<br>  <br>  I personally prefer metal frames so I'd go with the SIG.<br>  <br>  Doc|`|TeNIStN1aa	Both are nice guns but a Sig 226 will be much easier to shoot than a Glock 19.<br>  <br>  Even though they both shoot 9mm's, the felt recoil is very different. In fact, there will be a dramatic difference between the two. Glock 9mm's will try to jump and flip in your hands. Sigs will gently roll in your palms; I didn't even know a semi-auto is capable of doing that until after I got my first 226. Good accuracy is much easier to obtain with 226's. Even though Sig 226 will "roll" in your hands, it will not slow you down on rapid fire sessions. Actually, the roll will make the gun feel more stable than Glock 9mm's during rapid fire. It is also much easier to shoot a 226 with one hand even if you are using your weak arm. <br>  <br>  I don't have a Sig 226 Blackwater but I do own Sig 226's. The newest Sig 226 I got was made in Germany (while others were made in West Germany), but I don't think this will make much difference if at all. I highly recommend a 9mm Sig 226. I own several Glocks myself including a 17 and a 19. I am a very big fan of Glock 21's but Glock 9mm's were never that high on my list.<br>  <br>  Go to a range, rent a Glock and look for people who shoot Sig 226's and 228's. Ask them if you could squeeze a few rounds out of their Sigs. If you are lucky, you will get a side by side comparison and you will know exactly what am I talking about.|`|OYy1OmDPaa	Glock is the standard for reliability.  The barrel sits lower in the Glock and most find the grip angle better than on the Sig.  You will be able to shoot the Glock more rapidly and more accurately.|`|69a47001c8449771a6964bf1c2360497aa	Eric, both handguns are as accurate as the shooter.

DNKNI27Baa	marino, favre, unitas|`|4TQiNW03aa	i say guys like Marino, Favre, or Elway.  They are guys that didn't have a lot of major talent surrounding them and could still carry a team by themselves for the most part. I know i'll get beat up for saying this but it's just the way i see it and feel. Montana and Aikman were both good in their own right but to me they were more of a "game manager" than anything.  They both thrived on the talents of their teammates. I don't think either would've had anywhere near the success they had if they had been on teams that they had to carry instead of managing. What i'm saying is that they had it pretty easy when you consider the fact they had more than one Hall of Fame or HOF worthy offensive talents helping them out. That alone says a lot in my opinion.|`|qnREirWSaa	Joe Montana,Johnny Unitas,John Elway, Peyton Manning, Steve Young, Terry Bradshaw, Troy Aikman, Dan Marino, Rich Gannon, Brett Favre|`|AXUoqUSwaa	frank tarkenton was a better QB than half of the guys mentioned in this thread, but i'd go with Montana as best of all time followed by Unitas.|`|N5X6zSabaa	even before i saw your details i was thinking joe montana too but either him or bart star but probably montana sooo yea...|`|uU9aCPB4aa	ME  ..............<br>  <br>  fine Montana or Marino|`|o5s38ijVaa	kordell stewart lol elway/montana|`|zJC18FtAaa	Ryan Leaf jk <br>  Dan Marino|`|XDyQDcxXaa	LOL Aikman?

I mean, as a measure of how great his teams were, even his backup made the hall of fame.  <br>  <br>  Speaking of that backup, he would actually be my choice for the greatest of all time.  I know Steve Young isn't a choice most would make, but he had the highest career passer rating in the history of the NFL.  He rarely threw interceptions and he commanded the game better than anyone of his time.  He also mixed the rare talent of being able to throw the ball with being able to run it.  He didn't get to actually start until later in his career because he was Montana's backup for awhile, unless his career stats would rival some of the other greats.  I think Young's ability to be an amazing QB and a great runner (imagine Vick with the passing skills of Manning) made him an elite playmaker and almost impossible to defend.|`|ABoo1doVaa	Otto Graham for being a winner, Sammy Baugh for being a football player, and Dan Marino for being a pure passer.|`|2CuuIT70aa	Aikman?

I don't buy rifle cartridges unless I need brass, and I only buy pistol and revolver ammo every couple of years for Social Use, 99,75% of my shooting is with handloads.<br>  <br>  I highly recommend the RCBS RockChucker reloading Kit.

Reloaded .40 S&W rounds have been noted for a high tendency to fail. These rounds are rather wide compared to their length and work at rather high pressures which leaves more of the case head unsupported in the chamber add to that the weakening effect that reloading can have on the brass casing and you've got a nice recipe for case failure, which usually results in a kaboom that expels the magazine, sometimes blows the slide off the rails and in worst case scenarios blows the barrel apart! Many ammo manufacturers do not recommend hand reloading these cases and glock pistols are the most notorious for this type of failure with this round, so read on it a little and maybe get you a 9mm pretty cheap ammo and damn reliable.|`|FKJaQXQLaa	Yes it would be worth the money.  Check out midwayusa.  You can get the Lee anniversary kit and a set of Lee carbide dies for less than $150.  Despite what someone else said about loading .40 being dangerous, that is just pure BS.  I know.  I load .40 all the time and put it through my Glock 22 .40 all the time.  Absolutely none of my cases show any signs of failure or fatigue.  And as for the other fellow who said you cant save any money reloading, that is also BS.  Right now, with a little research, you can load .40 for $8 a box with your own brass and $10 a box without brass.    Dont believe me?  Midwayusa has .40 bullets 1000@ $110, oncefiredbrass.com has .40 shell casings 1000@$60, a can of gun powder costs about $20 and 1000 primers are about $25 at Sportsmans.|`|AA12211483	yes. It;s still a LITTLE cheaper than buying factory ammo.|`|AA10200748	The .40 S&W straight wall cartridge is very easy to reload. Initial investment in a progressive reloader, dies, and component may set you back about $400- $800. You will recoup your investment in a short time. I reload .40 S&W along with other handgun cartridges, and the reloads average about 20-30 cents a round depending which components I use.I would highly recommend a Dillon progressive reloader. They are built to last. I am still using the ones I bought in the mid 1980's. In all the years I used Dillon, I have one brojken part, and Dillon replaced it for free.
OazyaOu4aa	If you sight in a flat shooter like a 17 hmr dead on at 100 yards you would only be about a 1/2 inch to an inch high at 50 yards which isn't hard to compensate for at all.

y0BZcD6Uaa	Flatland and Park bikes are usually set up completely different to each other, but that's not to say you can't make a 'hybrid' bike, and set it up for both.  Unless you want to really excell in one or the other, you can definately set up a Haro to suit both, if you have your heart set on a Haro.   <br>  Flatland can be done on ANY bmx.  I have a friend who competes in Pro Flatland comps, and his bike is completely set up for park riding, with a slammed seat, long cranks, and a street frame.   However, Flatland bikes usually have these characteristics...<br>   - Raised seat post (to make tricks where you roll while holding ur seat easier)<br>   - High PSI tyres.  (As high as 120psi is great for spinning on concrete)<br>   - A Gyro.  (necessary for spinning the bars or frame, on certain tricks)<br>   - 4 pegs (for getting around the bike)<br>  <br>  These things can be easily added to ANY bmx to make it compatible for Flatland use, without making the bike feel unsuitable for Park riding.<br>  <br>  Alternatively, here is a bike that's suited to beginner Flatlanders, but isn't a bad bike for park use, too....  <a href="http://flatlandfuel.com/index.asp?PageAction=VIEWPROD&ProdID=1322" rel="nofollow">http://flatlandfuel.com/index.asp?PageAc...</a> <br>  It's light, cheap, good quality, and is a hybrid bike, meaning you can uuse it for Flatland AND Park, and if you decide you wanna stick with one or the other, the bike will still suit.<br>  Too many riders make the mistake of spending big bucks on a bike when they start out, and lose interest in bmx after a while.  If you start out on a cheaper bike, and find you really love bmxing, you can then upgrade to something more specific to the style you want to ride, and customize it to suit your height, weight, and preferences (eg: bar height, top tube length, crank length, bar sweep, etc...)<br>  <br>  Hope my answer was helpfull, and I won't ask for Best Answer, that's for YOU to decide.   lol  <br>  Ride on, bro :)|`|fS8joiTaaa	Well first of all its either park or flatland. You might have meant street but i dont know.<br>  <br>  Flatland usually takes a different kind of bike rather than freestyle bmx.<br>  <br>  I dont really know of any flatland bikes.

R0yzd9rIaa	Golf courses today can have many different sets of tee markers. In the earliest days of the game, golfers would finish a hole, create a small two-inch pile of sand within a few yards of the hole, place their ball on top of the sand hill or “tee”, and proceed to play the next hole. Due to damage near the holes, teeing grounds were invented. Years ago, there were red tee markers for ladies and juniors, white tee markers for men, and blue tee markers for professionals or championships on the majority of courses around the world. Those standard three have evolved into up to five, six, or even seven different course distances, depending on the construction budget, and all they represent are different levels of difficulty for the course. The longer the course the particular set of tee markers create, the more difficult it is to play. The colors vary from course to course now and are generally based on the preferences of the ownership. Some use descriptive titles, such as “Forward”, “Middle”, “Back”, and “Champion” instead of different colors, in order to define their tee markers. Isleworth Country Club in Orlando, FL, where Tiger Woods lives and plays, calls their back tee markers “Tiger”, and they define the most difficult version of Isleworth, at a monstrously amazing 7,544 total yards in length!<br>  <br>  There are only three colors of stakes or painted lines on a golf course recognized by the Rules of Golf. Two represent different types of water hazards, red stakes and/or lines for a Lateral Water Hazard, or one that runs along the length of the hole on either the right side or left side, and yellow stakes and/or lines for a Water Hazard, or one you must hit over in order to play a particular hole. There are different procedures to follow if you hit a shot into one or the other. It is also possible for the same water hazard to contain both types of hazard markings, depending on the direction of the hole in conjunction with the direction of the hazard. It is also possible for a hole to contain both types of these hazards that are separate from each other.<br>  <br>  The last color you will find for stakes and lines on a golf course is white. White stakes, white lines, roads, fences, walls, or railings can all define Out of Bounds, or the course boundary or property line, although some courses create Out of Bounds within the course itself during the play of some holes. An example of this would be when holes run adjacent to a driving range, lesson tee, or practice area, there may be white Out of Bounds stakes surrounding that practice area. Other than defining Out of Bounds, white lines are also used for circular drop areas in order to facilitate proper procedure in the event of hitting a shot into a Water Hazard and/or if on one of the professional tours, hitting a shot into a grandstand. They are also used to define Ground Under Repair, which is an area from which you may get free relief in the form of a drop within one club length from the nearest point of relief out of the area that is no nearer the hole, not in a hazard, or not on a putting green.<br>  <br>  That’s all there is to colors on golf courses with respect to tee markers and stakes or lines defining hazards or boundaries. I hope you pass your test!|`|gAhHCpRNaa	the tee colors represent the level a player should play from. a beginning male normally plays from the white tees while an advanced player will play from the black or blue tees. For women it's usually gold and red tees. As for the the hazards the red is a lateral hazard, yellow is regular hazard, white is out of bounds or ground under repair

65ebebf5e438864d41850ef2be37319caa	Apparently the Leafs were offered what would likely end up being a top 5 draft pick for Luke Schenn, but Brian Burke said no. This had to be either the Islanders, Atlanta, Tampa Bay, or Ottawa.<br>  <br>  Since they are not willing to move Schenn, their only chance is being bad enough to draft him with their own pick.|`|Pc0QjrQ4aa	They'll have to wait until the draft lottery occurs in mid-April.  Once that's been handled, then teams will know who has the overall #1 pick.  The Islanders have by no means guaranteed themselves that pick.<br>  <br>  I suppose the Leafs, if they were truly sold on Tavares, could offer a package up, but again- to get that #1 overall pick, you can't just offer up a couple polished-up turds.|`|LEQowzHCaa	Yes....<br>  <br>  As the shipwreck that is the Toronto Maple Leafs continues to float into the summer, it has begun to be obvious that this team is finally looking at “the big picture.”<br>  <br>  That picture is building through the draft.<br>  <br>  Luke Schenn was a solid pick in this year’s entry draft. At 6′3″ and 216 pounds, he will be a solid block upon which this team can build a foundation.<br>  <br>  Justin Pogge looking like he will be the real deal in net. Pogge had a brilliant season with the Marlies, going 26-10-0 with a sparkling 2.34 goals-against average and posting four shutouts. The Leafs are solid in net for years to come.<br>  <br>  So if you look at this team from the goal out, it doesn’t really look as bad as many observers believe: Pogge in net, with Schenn, Colaiacovo, White, and Anton Stralman possibly patrolling the blue line in the next four years.<br>  <br>  But if the Buds don’t make a splash on the free agent market, this team is obviously going to struggle next season—but this is a move that makes alot of sense when you think of the reward that may just go to the worst team in the NHL next season.<br>  <br>  That reward?<br>  <br>  None other than the next star John Tavares of the Oshawa Generals.<br>  <br>  He is a can’t-miss player!<br>  <br>  And for those who don’t know him yet—you will.<br>  <br>  He was the youngest player ever taken in the OHL draft at 14.<br>  <br>  At the World Juniors this past year, he was easily his team’s best player, and went from playing a limited role in the first two games to being the go-to guy in the rest of the tournament.<br>  <br>  Why? Simply because the coaching staff underestimated just how good this kid really is.<br>  <br>  If the Leafs do end up with that first overall pick next season, they are going to have themselves the next Joe Sakic—and look how well that turned out for the Nordiques/Avalanche franchise.<br>  <br>  Tavares may just be the golden child that will bring this team back to respectability, and with the strong cast the Leafs seem to be farming, a Stanley Cup in the next six years wouldn’t be a long shot.<br>  <br>  That is, if they land the first pick. That isn’t a given now with the lottery, but I’m sure Brian Burke—oops, I mean, Cliff Fletcher—will find a way to at least get a shot at it.|`|51NT5oOhaa	The Leafs don't have much to offer, but if I were the Islanders I would probably look into acquiring Luke Schenn, who is looking to be a superstar in the making judging from his stellar play as an 18 year old and Mikhail Grabovski, whose offensive skills could be deadly when paired up with the right playmakers. The Leafs would also have to give up their first round pick too with one of these players.|`|RJ5Bevmpaa	The Leafs have nothing worth any of those picks to offer.|`|t14Jk1IPaa	No!

9Injuk2zaa	Yes, I agree with you , girly man (just kidding!)<br>  <br>  Biceps really don't do much for sports.  The most important muscles to train are legs, abdominals, shoulders, and back.  <br>  <br>  Most of your strength comes from your legs and your back, not your biceps.|`|qsWk3Fo6aa	You can gain strength and hypertrophy in your biceps from just doing curls, but that would not help you much in either sport.  You have to train the entire body for any improvement in any sport.  Biceps are only 1 group of hundreds of muscles that work synergistically.  Do more than just your Bi's.  And don't worry about bulk.  Women cannot build muscle like men.  Low testosterone.

tzrLDbHWaa	I think the most amazing stat was that, while scoring 50, more than half the teams points in the blowout, his 5 assists also led the team.  That goes to show me that Wade barely passed the ball at all, since, had he actually passed in a halfcourt offense, and gotten the ball back and shot, other players would have been getting assists.|`|FUoKu13Daa	Kobe never scored over 50 and lost? I remember distinctly a game against the Rockets 2 years ago ,<br>  <br>  and second what if that girl Kobe raped or had sex with and she has STD, who would Kobe give the STD he would have contracted too, yes his wife,<br>  <br>  so stop hating, they both scored of 50 points in a game and lost and they both cheated on their wife period.|`|eff7c5bf6219b25d24a130be10287a20aa	and Kobe raped a girl in Colorado.<br>  Wade tried his hardest, they lost by 23 points, but would you dare say the same about GEORGE GERVIN and WILT CHAMBERLAIN?

Ha Ha At least Wade didn't "RAPE" someone!|`|JqSOfDiuaa	I don't recall Jordan ever scoring 50 and losing by 20 or more points.

4zQEvzCsaa	At the moment, so many possibilities are up in the air, and the only matches all but confirmed are Hardy vs Hardy, the MITB, and Undertaker vs HBK.

1a17e73a07a2c5ebb65e5750cb7c97faaa	With their talent, teams and determination both of those drivers should play a factor in this year's championship but it will come down to momentum and results in the chase.  Matt and Jeff are true champions and 2 of the elite drivers in the cup series, without a doubt.  I am happy for all the 17 and 24 fans after everybody was questioning them after winless seasons last year.  I wouldn't mind seeing both of them with a chance to win it all at the drop of the green flag in Homestead but I suspect a couple of other drivers will have something to say about that come chase time.  With the new format it's not so much what you do during the regular season as long as you make it in the big show.  We saw what happened to Jeff 2 years ago after he dominated for the first 20+ races but I wish them well and hope it's close to the very end.  If Matt is close you have to like his odds as he is one of the best at that final race along with his teammate Greg Biffle.<br>  4's FINE N 09!!!|`|LOFmGU89aa	I've known Matt since his local track late model days.

dfBwVxXFaa	are you crazy? Just what I would want to see, a hot headed 16 or 18 year old with a pistol. I can only imagine what would happen over teenage girlfriends.  I'm sure that some can handle the responsibility, but most are out of the question.|`|kQSSz2X2aa	Well, it isn't federal law that regulates carry age, it's state law. There are some people under teh age of 21 who are allowed to carry. Police offices, military, those exempt by federal law, etc.|`|K5AeQuSNaa	No.|`|mFa5ZDtcaa	No. If anything, I would be not surprised to see the Fed Gov try to do away with Concealed Carry laws altogether.

Bunch of High School kids able to carry hand guns isn't right, even if they can't carry it on school grounds. To many people screw around with guns now. I am all for owning guns of all sorts, but I think required classes and evaluations should be done to make sure you are deemed capable and competent of bearing the responsibility.|`|1f34cb08ac2251c3afe6fe04a9dfbc46aa	18 year olds are still in high school.  i doubt that many politicians will be terribly eager to allow a high school kid a concealed carry permit.|`|yaq7oaH6aa	Don't worry about it.<br>  They're about to take away the carry right.|`|3b8557f01cef58611c2e78e57d57b1e5aa	Well its not really necessary to pass any Laws about Age Requirements or Restrictions.* Our Founding Fathers were not concerned, preoccupied, or insisting that you had to be a certain age to exercise Your 2nd Amendment Rights.* It seems like any Laws, Legislation, Regulations or Infringements passed or created after the Founding of the 2nd Amendment is in fact Unconstitutional, illegal, Invalid, UnLawful and therefore meaningless as far as having any Credibility whatsoever whether practiced or passed by the Federal, State, County, or Local Governments.*..

In Indiana, an 18 year old can get a License To Carry a Handgun (LTCH).  <br>  <br>  I personally feel we treat our young adults like children way to long.  The youth of today need to stand up and take responsibility for their actions as well as their inaction and quit blaming everything on youthful indiscretion.  An 18 year old is an adult in the eyes of the law, we need to hold them accountable to that understanding, that they are an adult and damn well better start acting like one!|`|w0HgVh6iaa	if you were 16 would you trust yourself with a carry permit and if you think you do would you trust any other 16 yr old. Not only that if they get into an argument or something doesn't go there way that would  be the end of it, also if they commit a crime there tried as a juvenile. use your head. 18 should be the right age ill give you that. think about it|`|1c0c973b392b482e30be82d985344c50aa	It wouldn't make much sense to lower the carry age when you have to be 21 to purchase a handgun. unless you can find one bad *** IWB holster for your shotgun.|`|5eWb3CWoaa	That would worry the heck out of me if people could carry at 16!|`|Vakup5Jvaa	No, I don't think they will lower it. Some people just are not mature enough at 18. You may be but look at some of your friends...would you say they all are ready?|`|FUc5BQtEaa	I wouldn't mind if they dropped the legal age to purchase a handgun to 18, but trust me, I know a lot of people my age that I wouldn't even let LOOK at a loaded gun, or even let them in the same room as an unloaded gun. I do think that the concealed carry thing is at the right age to issue, as I am 17, and I do tend to get a hot head over many unimportant things. I figure that a few more years of learning what sets my temper off and how to control it will make me more responsible than if I were able to get it right now, as there are times where I wish that I did have a loaded gun on me, and I always regret thinking that way after I have calmed down.|`|f4f5e407afc14886b73abf740baa3415aa	I contend that your grammar exemplifies the government's logic.  True, you may be a competent shot, you may be mentally stable at that age, but the vast majority of the populous is not.  As thus, it needs to stay the way it is. <br>  <br>       However, as long as we're idealizing, I think that they should implement an exception for those matured in all aspects of life; a comprehensive audit administered by the government for a fee that measures your worldliness, innate intellect, etc.  In that regard, a physically and mentally matured 'child' would be able to drive, drink, shoot, etc.  As thus, an ignorant 30-year-old would not be able to do any of the aforementioned things. <br>  <br>      My whole 'audit' concept stems from the fact that I'm 15, and bitter about being held to an arbitrary age standard.   But, the few ruin it for the many; so what the hell.

bB5d5YVeaa	An AR-15 might be a wise investment.  But it seems like everyone is buying them these days.  If/when the gun ban hysteria comes to a grinding halt, and the economy continues to suffer, there will be a lot of good used AR-15 rifles on the market for about half of what folks paid for them.<br>  <br>  A 22 conversion kit for an AR-15 is out of the question.  Do you really want to be "polluting" the bore of your AR rifle with soft lead .22 rimfire bullets?  Stick with the jacketed .223 ammo for your AR.|`|fUDlbOP0aa	unless you really love the AR15, I'd suggest something cheaper like the Kel Tec SU16 carbine. The AR15 while a very nice rifle, does have its shortcomings. First, they're picky about ammo. Nearly every AR15 owner I've heard from says their rifle will not shoot cheap steel case ammo reliably. buying the shooting brass case quality ammo for plinking would be very expensive, unless you start reloading it really wouldn't be affordable. 2nd, the AR15 has reliability problems and also ease of use/ maintenance. its a very high maintenance rifle, it likes to be clean or it'll jam up frequently. The Kel Tec SU16 on the other hand will accept any .223 ammo, will shoot when its dirty, and will fire reliably as long as its .223 and the ammo itself not defective. The Kel tec also can be folded for storage (but not fire when folded), comes with a piticanny type rail and a integrated bipod. It still accepts AR15/M16 magazines and has accuracy like the AR15, within 1-2" groups at 100 yards. The Kel Tec's action unlike the AR15 it is simple and easy to maintain as well as use. A good AR15 would start at $1000 to $1200, the Kel Tec su16 goes for around $450 to $600. Basically half price. <br>  .223 brass case ammo at the cheapest is around $370 per case of 1000, the cheaper steel case stuff is around $250 per 1000. <br>  <br>  If you don't have a SKS already I'd suggest you get one. the remaining money you can either buy an AK or SKS carbine, the AK costs more at around $500 and the SKS at around $200. The AK round, 7.62x39mm is a cheap plinking round slightly less than .223 at $220 per case of 1000. Both AK rifle and SKS carbines are just as reliable as their military counterparts. You really can drop an AK rifle in a pool for a month and fish it out and it'll shoot just fine. The SKS is less well known and is the earlier version of the AK. Its even more reliable and simple. It can be completely stripped if all you have is a one live round (to use as a steel punch). Its a fun and accurate rifle, the SKS being slightly more accurate than the AK since its barrel is slightly longer. Compared to other 7.62x39 rifles like the Ruger mini-30, not only is its cheaper and more accurate, its also much more reliable as well as simple. A basic SKS would be a Chinese made Norinco SKS. The Yugo SKS has a gas issue (a reliability issue), and the Russian SKS carbines can be up to $500. <br>  The Chinese SKS goes for around $150 to $275. Decent plinker, can be used for hunting, very reliable and affordable. <br>  <br>  for defense nothing is better than a shotgun, like a Remington 870, Mossberg 500, or Maverick. something in 12 gauge for maximum ammo choice, a pump action so its simple and reliable, a short 18-20" barrel so its short and easy to maneuver indoors. Generally around $250-$350. For practice, birdshot is fine, for plinking birdshot is also fine. for defense, 4 to 2 buck or 00 buckshot. <br>  <br>  It would be nice if you found a Tokarev 7.62x25mm pistol, a good collectors piece as well as being extremely affordable to shoot. 7.2x25mm also has more of a rifle cartridge type case design, its more powerful than other small caliber rounds and has more penetration than a 9mm or 45acp. I've been searching for one myself, I've learned a tokarev is difficult to find as they're not made anymore and the last surplus ran out years ago.|`|dAK8dS4kaa	Carbine style rifle for defense is stupid. Go shotgun or handgun, gun if your thinking about home defense.|`|vea6mqPZaa	What are you looking at the purchases for?<br>  <br>  Defense and survival?<br>  <br>  If this is the route you are looking at consider this<br>  <br>  Ruger 10/22 about $200 at wal-mart or academy<br>  Charles Daly 12ga pump about $250<br>  Lower end 9mm about $300<br>  38 revolver about $300<br>  <br>  Spend the rest on ammo<br>  500 12ga 7 1/2 bird shot<br>  5,000 rounds bulk pack 22LR<br>  500 rounds 9mm<br>  500 rounds 38<br>  <br>  then start adding 100 rounds per pay check if you can.<br>  <br>  That way WSHTF you have some protection, hunting ability, and some trading ability.|`|dpSr0icwaa	I think you are on the right track with the AR-15.  $1000 willl get you a decent one. I suggest getting a DPMS AR-15, and about 4 spare magazines, 30 rounders are great, but 20 rounders can be a bit more reliable.<br>  <br>  Second, I'd not get a conversion kit, but simply purchase a Ruger 10/22 and fit it with an inexpensive red dot or a 4x scope.<br>  <br>  Third, buy 4 bricks of 22LR ammo, and convert the rest of your spare gun cash into 223 ammo<br>  <br>  <br>  An alternate solution would be the same Ruger 10/22, and instead of $1000 for an AR, spend $700 for an AK (check out the bulgarian with black polymer furniture here <a href="http://www.classicarms.us/)" rel="nofollow">http://www.classicarms.us/)</a>  plus 4 spare mags.<br>  <br>  Finish off these two with a Mossberg 12 gauge shotgun, polymer 'duck hunting' type, but then get an 18 inch home defense barrel to boot.  Sometimes you can find both in one pacakge<br>  <a href="http://www.budsgunshop.com/catalog/product_info.php/manufacturers_id/83/products_id/46907" rel="nofollow">http://www.budsgunshop.com/catalog/produ...</a>|`|TtMKPBR3aa	forget the ar15 for the money get an sks or ak or better yet an ak sniper rifle<br>  <br>  the tokarev is a good buy and will go through a level 3 vest|`|UQHfRU5eaa	Your best bet would be to shop around at local gun show as well as online resources, such as gunbrokers and gunsamerica. If it were me, I would stick with what I know,  I would get a nice pump shotgun, revolver or pistol and a carbine. You can look into your 7,62x39 rifles... they are fairly reasonably priced,reliable and easy to find ammo for.. well at least for now. The sks would be my choice or AK.. either one of those would be nice home protection. The ruger 10-22 is a nice semi auto rifle for the money as well as the 17 HMR. I always keep on hand a LOADED  22 rifle and a double barrel shotgun. Most of my guns double as hunting weapons.|`|RmcFMAT0aa	An AR would be a good investment. Guaranteed to go up in value. <br>   If you are just interested in defense, I would go down another road.  Would get a Mossberg 500 or 590 in 12 ga. That should run around $300 at most. Handgun, inexpensive route, A Ruger P95 would be a good deal. Once again, around $300. And, last but not least, a Ruger 10/22. Outstanding .22 rifle. Cheap to shoot. Fun to shoot. <br>   An AR is overpriced right now. Good rifle. Not sure if they are $1,100 good, though. <br>   Of course, lots of ammo and spare mags.........|`|KQYFZWD6aa	get a 77/17 or a good squirrel rifle.

FZRWMc3Baa	Kovalev was back in the line up tonight, so they weren't holding him out for a trade.  I wouldn't mind trading Satan if Montreal will straight up give us Kovy for him.  Doubt they'd do that though.  Kovy's best years were here in Pittsburgh so we always think he's coming back when stuff like this occurs, but it never does happen.|`|UkW9FPEZaa	They are looking for a winger to play exclusively with Crosby and maybe that could be Kovalev but it would be a hard trade to make while staying under the cap and getting him to waive his no trade clause. I have heard this rumor before and Kovalev would be a great addition to the penguins roster but if the penguins don't show themselves to be a play-off team he won't waive the no trade clause.|`|RJ5Bevmpaa	The Penguins are the team trying to catch Montreal among others for the playoffs. There's a very small chance that Montreal would be willing to set a team up for a run when they are that close behind them at the moment. The Pens also have very little to offer at the moment so the odds of a deal there are fairly long.|`|XuGFt3boaa	Well, I would like to see the Pens bring back Kovalev, but I don't think it'll happen.  He's pretty happy in Montreal.  It's probably a rumor, so we might not get to see Kovy in a Pens jersey again.  The reason the Canadiens gave Alex off was because he was pretty tired.|`|MiWKmKgvaa	Is the Eklund?  You sneeky devil.   <br>  <br>  Kovalev was told to stay home to regroup his mind.  His mind is fragile and they wanted him to regroup.  He might be on the market, but it will cost the pens probably Staal and a high pick.  The pens dont wanna keep throwing away their future to keep trying to fix their "imidiate problems", but will need the long term to fix them.|`|5P4FySVAaa	Bringing Kovy back wouldn't benefit the pens in any way in my opinion.  He's an older guy who doesn't score like he used to and we'd have to give up alot for him i would assume.  Not worth it.|`|t14Jk1IPaa	If Kovalev plays good, then no. But why would you want him?

4zQEvzCsaa	I like Jeff, mostly because I think he's a good wrestler, but at the moment it seems like the WWE is trying to do too much with him. The face paint, I agree, was cool in the leadup to the match he had with Undertaker on Smackdown, before he won the title, but now it seems pointless and it makes him look like a long lost member of Kiss. That and I find his accent incredibly annoying, so I agree that he should stop talking so much and just get the job done. I liked him so much more when he was quiet, it gave him more of an aura which, compounded with his wrestling style, made him kinda intriuging.|`|7f2GSDmqaa	I never liked Jeff Hardy or anything about him, so this is nothing new to me.

InslKYS5aa	It could be a number of things. It could be snow drifts that get packed down. It could be a spot that wasn't in the shade on a warmer day and got dug up from the snowmobile traffic. It could be from a snowmobile starting fast and leaving a snow mound, or stopping fast and leaving a snow mound. Then when the snowmobiles run over the mounds, they pack down the snow mounds creating a bump. A groomer can knock down these bumps, but the snow they leave behind is softer, and in time the bumps return from the tracks digging up the softer snow. Hope I helped.
jEJxcWq5aa	Well... with a plastic spring pistol, you'll be spending $ 30 every few months, to replace it.<br>  <br>  Besides.. you can get ~4000 shots, for $23<br>  <a href="http://www.pyramydair.com/cgi-bin/accessory.pl?accessory_id=257" rel="nofollow">http://www.pyramydair.com/cgi-bin/access...</a><br>  Each one lasts for ~100 shots in a high-flow Gas blowback<br>  you can double, or more that, with a non-blowback<br>  <br>  They can be purchased at your local WalMart, for I beleieve the same price|`|E1kRzK5jaa	Yes, once the C02 is used up it will need to be replaced.

The cartridges cost like 4 dollars for 4.

rC6RD8Wcaa	DEFENSE!!!<br>  <br>  Broncos offense is good so they will focus most of their attention of defense<br>  <br>  they need upgrades in secondary and since they are switching defensive schemes they also need front 7 players too...so with the number 12 pick they should select BJ Raji (if he falls that far) Rey Maulugula or Brian Cushing.....however Free Agency is weak this year because a lot of teams are using the franchise tag so dont be surprised if they draft Malcolm Jenkins or Vonte Davis because all the good corners were franchised or re-signed<br>  <br>  They should pursue Bart Scott in Free Agency <br>  <br>  the fact is to run a 3-4 defense you need really good linebackers thats why i am putting so much emphasis on them in my answer.|`|yg3Pveakaa	I think they are shifting to a 3-4 defense this year so i bet they will be on the teams targeting Albert Haynesworth for the NT position..In the draft i think they will get an ILB, Laurinitis or Maualuga to fill the huge void in run defense were they really suck..|`|Zp65xPQyaa	A lot of mock drafts have the Broncos going running back with the 12th pick but that isn't their biggest hole. They can grab a guy in the 3rd round that will typically be able to step in and at least contribute. I think they should probably go and get a pass rushing linebacker like Aaron Curry to fit the 3-4.

India says no<br>  <br>  Agencies<br>  Posted online: Tuesday, May 08, 2007 at 1740 hours IST<br>  <br>  <br>   New Delhi, May 8: Adam Gilchrist's squash ball-in-glove issue may have kicked up a mini-row in some parts of the world, especially Sri Lanka, but the cricket fraternity here sees it as an unnecessary fuss over an innocuous ploy. <br>  <br>   <br>   <br>  "I think this is nothing but an unnecessary controversy. Gilchrist did not use a bat longer or wider than prescribed. He did not do anything that violates any law and there is no need to make an issue out of it," former Indian stumper Kiran More said. <br>  <br>  After hitting the match-winning knock of 149 in the World Cup final against Sri Lanka, Gilchrist, who had an average run of form till the final, revealed that he had put a squash ball in his batting glove for a better grip and it paid off. <br>  <br>  More than a week after the final, Sri Lanka Cricket Secretary Kangadaran Mathivanan alleged it may not be illegal under existing ICC rules but was as unethical as Trevor Chappell's infamous underarm delivery. <br>  <br>  And then there is this one which clears it up I think.<br>  <br>  Gilly clear in glove affair<br>  By staff writers<br>  May 09, 2007 CRICKET'S lawmakers overnight cleared Adam Gilchrist's use of a squash ball in his batting glove, which helped him score a record 149 in Australia's World Cup final win.<br>  <br>  The Marylebone Cricket Club said Gilchrist had not acted against the laws or spirit of the game. <br>  <br>  "Gilchrist's use of a squash ball was designed to alter his grip on the bat whilst at the crease, something which he was perfectly entitled to do," an MCC statement read. <br>  <br>  Gilchrist was man of the match as Australia defeated Sri Lanka by 53 runs in a rain-affected and slightly farcical World Cup final on April 28 in Bridgetown, Barbados. <br>  <br>  Sri Lanka Cricket secretary Kangadaran Mathivanan objected to Gilchrist's tactic, describing it as unethical and claiming it gave him an unfair advantage. <br>  <br>  But the MCC said the relevant rule only stated what external protective equipment was allowed. <br>  <br>  “ It's been suggested that if shoving a squash ball into your bottom glove makes you bat like Adam Gilchrist then perhaps the ICC should make it compulsory. ” – Peter Young Cricket Australia spokesman For batsmen, helmets, pads, gloves and forearm guards are all listed as permitted. <br>  <br>  "None has any definition or prescription," the MCC said. <br>  <br>  "Since there is no restriction in law even on the external form of batting gloves, let alone the interior thereof, no law has been breached."<br>  <br>  Cricket Australia officials yesterday rejected Sri Lanka's claims in full voice. <br>  <br>  "It's a storm in a teacup, or a batting glove," CA spokesman Peter Young said. <br>  <br>  "To the best of our knowledge it's no different to, say, putting two or three grips on the bat handle, or batting with two pairs of gloves or having inserts sewn into the palm of gloves. <br>  <br>  "All these are things which now happen. This is in the same category." <br>  <br>  Young said there was no question of Gilchrist seeking to take an unfair advantage. <br>  <br>  "He is a highly principled person. You're going to have to go a long way before you find a cricketer who has higher moral standards than Adam Gilchrist." <br>  <br>  Batting coach Bob Meuleman, who introduced Gilchrist to the technique some years ago, said he laughed out loud when he heard Sri Lanka had raised objections. <br>  <br>  "Actually it's just a little bid sad that some people think there's something sinister in it," he said. "There's not." <br>  <br>  Gilchrist's former Western Australia coach Wayne Clark said it was rubbish to think it gave Gilchrist an unfair advantage. <br>  <br>  "They're grasping at straws," he said. <br>  <br>  Senior Australian umpire Bob Parry, who stood in a limited-overs match in Perth last season in which Gilchrist had a squash ball in his glove while scoring a century against Queensland, said he had no problem with it. <br>  <br>  "I don't see it being outside the spirit of the game. It's the same as wearing an extra inner inside a batting glove," he said. <br>  <br>  Young concluded: "It's been suggested that if shoving a squash ball into your bottom glove makes you bat like Adam Gilchrist then perhaps the ICC should make it compulsory."<br>  <br>  With AAP|`|561a42dcf730fd97fc3a2ebd788ea961aa	he was having a prolonged bad -patch before & during 2007 W.C. ,.... then..all- of- a- sudden... <br>  'KabooM'.. in the final match.. he comes up with his  best one day ...batting performance!!.<br>  so........"go figure"~<br>  no offence....<br>  cheers!|`|mZ2Uluioaa	looks like , a person who can attack gentleman like Murali and Sachin~ alongwith squash balls , all the aussie keepers have a nack of removing bails with gloves starting from hilly, gilly and hidden~|`|XBNZoVnHaa	He is a great player and also very decent in the field... he was not a cheat... all the team wanted a player like gilly... such a fantastic and good player in onfield and outfield...|`|kecdkv6jaa	Yeah he used the squash ball.<br>  <br>  It's nit illegal, how is he a cheat, you are aloud to use it.|`|wnZ0N3wjaa	What a ridiculous question, this happened, what 1 and a half years ago...|`|tz7JEqstaa	No.|`|z6JExf0faa	Has anyone ever watched India when one of their spinners are bowling.  Everything that hits the pads and lobs out to a fielder brings vociferous appeals, even when it is plainly obvious that there was no bat.  This is designed to force an umpire into a wrong decision and is clearly cheating.  In fact there is a law against this practise.<br>  <br>  There is no law against putting a squash ball in your batting glove.  To do so is not against the laws of the game, it does not induce an umpire or an opposition fielder to make a mistake and does not improve the power of the batting stroke.<br>  <br>  I know which of these practises I prefer to see on the ground.  Then again an Australian came up with an innovative way to help his own game so it must be cheating.

JXJQTgULaa	The best way to stretch your splits and become more flexible is by, <br>  <br>  first warming up your muscles. You should take a really hot bath, or go on a jog, just to get your heart rate going. If you are sweating on your run, then that is good. Just ten minutes should be fine. Now you should go and sit down in a straddle position. Move your arms to one side of your straddle, and hold for thirty seconds. Do the same for the other side. Now lift your butt up and make the straddle bigger. You will feel the muscle stretching and your straddle will be twice as large as it would be if you didn't warm up your muscles by running or taking a bath. That will help you tremendously. Do that every day for a month, and I swear that you will have your center split, even if you have absolutely no flexible ability whatsoever.<br>  <br>  Second, after you stretch your straddle. Sit in your center split, and both side splits for 60 seconds each. It may hurt, but pain is good! Your split doesn't have to be good, but after a week of doing this, you will be able to see huge results.<br>  <br>  Good luck =D|`|OOi3vyPgaa	Yoga should help..

Make sure you don't forget to extend the arms back, and jump as high as you can. You know the deal. <br>  <br>  Once you've got the form down, just start taking approaches. Just keep trying to go faster and faster. This worked out nicely for me because I could do them in the backyard, just going back and forth. Its a nice workout, too.|`|jby2AKQEaa	you should approach earlier and it may feel weird at first but after a couple tries youll get the hang of it|`|euuPwLREaa	runninr, and plyometrics
69648225057d350e24deff5fc472380eaa	If a boat is dragging a net as it moves, it's called trawling. (Trolling is dragging lures behind the boat on individual fishing lines.) Generally the net is weighted and dragged along the bottom, or at least beneath the surface. Boats doing this move very slowly, probably no more than 3-4 knots. Bottom trawling is very environmentally destructive, as it catches not only the targeted fish, but lots of bycatch, and it tears up the bottom like a bulldozer.<br>  <br>  Another method of net fishing is purse seining, where the boat locates a school of fish, then runs a net around the school and pulls it shut with a drawstring. The boat is not anchored for this one either. Most of the time spent fishing is actually looking for the fish -- they may look for hours before making a "set" -- when looking, they'd be traveling at normal cruising speed, probably 8-12 knots, watching for birds, fish on the surface, fish on the sonar, or whatever other signs of fish they can come up with.<br>  <br>  Finally, there is gill netting, where a boat puts out a long flat net, anchored vertically with weights and buoys, anywhere from a hundred yards to miles long, then leaves it for hours or days before hauling it in to catch whatever has swum into it and gotten tangled. Laying out or pulling in the net is probably done at less than cruising speed. Again, with gill nets, there is lots of waste (bycatch).<br>  <br>  The anchor is really not used when actually fishing with nets.

Cl6KbcAGaa	you dont have to replace this Fox Float shock with another Fox but you would be foolish not too. It is how Cdale specd' the bike and they do well to use Fox on any bike. Go with a Rock Shox rear and it will work fine and probably not cost near $400 but if you want Fox then be prepared to pay for it... What did you pay $50 for anyway? Look here for rear shocks: <a href="http://www.pricepoint.com/thumb/3-Parts-818-Rear-Shocks-False.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.pricepoint.com/thumb/3-Parts-...</a> and you will see that $400 is not too  much to ask. and here:<a href="http://www.jensonusa.com/store/sub/1379-Rear+Shocks.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.jensonusa.com/store/sub/1379-...</a> and there are some cheaper but do you really want to downgrade??|`|DOVbF4Piaa	Get the info off the shock and Google it.|`|fk23CmWeaa	I suggest looking up PUSH industries and Hippietech Suspension and talking to them about a rebuild.  It will probably cost less than a replacement shock and you'll end up not only with a 'good as new' shock, but possibly one tuned to your weight and riding style.  Local bike shops can also sometimes rebuild shocks, which might be worth looking into, but the two companies above have EXCELLENT reputations and specialize in rebuilds and tuning.<br>  <br>  Beyond that and the suggestions of others here, you can also check Ebay for used shocks, but you'll be taking something of a gamble on a used shock - you may end up needing a rebuild soon, anyway.<br>  <br>  If you do replace the shock and want the bike to perform the same way, be careful to get a shock with the exact same dimensions (eye-to-eye length AND stroke).  Changes will affect the geometry and/or suspension performance of the bike.  If you get your shock rebuilt, as I suggested above, you won't have to worry about it fitting.|`|182c6604bba959c84026ef7306cf79bbaa	bike shop

Stand strait up and down with both feet side by side about the width of your shoulders.<br>  <br>  3. Have your buddie give you a nudge (not push) forward Pay attention to which foot you lead out with. Consider that foot to be your "front" foot. <br>  <br>  Generally you will want to go 2 out of 3 with this test but it's certain that one foot will lead first more than the other.

The unsuspected nudge may be more helpful for you to determine but if you are still doing both comfortably without thinking about what you are doing, you will have to try snowboarding with the different stances to see what you are.|`|WPof1jcxaa	Okay, this is dumb but Jennifer is right. The pushing thing is the only one which actually works pretty accuratly, besides just trying snowboarding or skateboarding which ever way you feel most confortable(which is usually the best). The guys at the shop had me do the pushing thing. The sliding on the floor absolutely is not accurate. I am definently regular and i definently slide right foot first on the floor or ice or whatever. The kicking thing seems to work sometimes because most people are right footed and most people are regular. Most people i know are right footed when the play soccer or whatever but some are goofy. Its like hockey not all right handers hold there right hand on the bottom of the stick and vice versa. I dont know what else to say, but it just doesnt work. Just because your right handed or right footed doesnt mean your regular. A more accurate thing would be to see what leg you would jump off of for hurdles or a dunk or something. The leg you push off of should probable be in front. My track coach asked me what leg i ride with foward so i could determine what way to hurdle so it makes sense the other way too i guess. And it worked.|`|HVpeJzM4aa	that's one method...try this...stand perfectly straight with your arms crossed over your chest. now when your buddy thinks you aren't paying attention have him/her gently push you with even force across your left and right side. Now whichever foot sticks out and wants to brace your fall is the foot you want forward. <br>  <br>  Another determining factor is whichever foot is your dominant foot is the foot you want forward...i.e. whichever foot you instinctively want to kick with or have the strongest most comfortable kicks is your dominant foot. Now if you are one of the few people that are truly ambidexterous there is nothing wrong with riding both goofy and regular...just adjust your binding settings accordingly and you can be 1/100 people who can carve from both sides

WeEjc79Uaa	In baseball [statistics], an error is the act, in the judgment of the official scorer, of a fielder misplaying a ball in a manner that allows a batter or baserunner to reach one or more additional bases, when such an advance should have been prevented given ordinary effort by the fielder. It is also an error when a fielder muffs a foul fly to prolong the time at bat of a batter, whether the batter subsequently reaches first base or is put out|`|2N6oTOLQaa	There are several elements of this question:<br>  <br>  1. It is up to the official scorekeeper's judgment to decide hit or error<br>  <br>  2. The scorekeeper should score an error only when reasonable ordinary effort would have retired the runner or prevented him from taking an extra base. <br>  <br>  3. The definition of "ordinary effort" depends on the level of play. In the MLB a sliding catch by an outfielder might be considered "ordinary effort" and therefore it could be ruled an error if a fielder drops the ball on a sliding catch. But, it little league, if a player tries to make a sliding catch  and drops it, you'd probably want to rule it a hit because making a sliding catch in little league is not ordinary effort.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	An error is when a misplay by the fielder causes a baserunner to reach base or advance a base.  <br>  <br>  Wether or not it was a misplay and wether or not it caused the runner to get the base is totally the opinion of the official scorer.<br>  <br>  Examples<br>  <br>  1) Ground ball to short, bobbled, throws to first, runner safe.  In the opinion of the scorer, a cleanly played ball would have resulted in an out.  Play scored an error.<br>  <br>  2) Same ground ball hit to short, same bobble, but this time its an extremely fast runner that would have likely been a close play had he come up with it cleanly.  Play scored a hit.<br>  <br>  3) Same ground ball hit to short, same bobble, this time a very slow runner and the throw beats the runner.  Because no runner reached base because of this "error". no error is given and its a simple out.|`|AYiVipawaa	A hit is when you hit the ball and get to at least 1st base safely. Getting thrown out at 2nd will still be a hit. It's not a hit if it's an error. <br>  <br>  An error is if you hit the ball, and the defense didn't field the ball cleanly, or made a bad throw and could have gotten you out if they fielded right, but didn't. It's important that you would have been safe if the defense did field the ball cleanly. It's only an error if you get to the next base, example: you hit a grounder to 3rd, and you would be out, but the 3rd baseman bobbles it. Here's another example: you hit it in the outfield, and on your way to 2nd, you're going to be out, but the 2nd baseman misses the ball.|`|1CgCx1E2aa	an error is anything the official scorer sees as the player could have made the play. This is scored as E4 (for second baseman's error) you would replace the number with the position<br>  If a run scores because of an error (mainly after two outs but anytime) they are unearned runs on the pitcher and do not count in ERA(earned run average)|`|0Ub8hoN6aa	whenever it goes through a fielders legs, or it is within reach and the fielder lets it go to his left or right missing the ball... diving plays left or right don't count as errors and if you don't get the out but knock the ball down and keep it in front of you it isn't an error...|`|qsWk3Fo6aa	It is the official scorers decision whether a play should have been made by the fielder using "ordinary effort".

8bTder08aa	Nelson R. is correct that Doneraile is the longest shot to ever win the Derby, but paradoxically, his win is not considered the greatest upset in Derby history.<br>  <br>  Most horsemen consider that Gallahadion's defeat of Bimelech in 1940 is one of the two biggest upsets of all time.  Gallahadion paid $72.40 to win.  Bimelech, who prior to the Derby had  been considered virtually invincible, finished second to Gallahadion, then went on to win the Preakness and Belmont and was named champion three-year-old.  Gallahadion never won another stakes of any importance and vanished into obscurity.<br>  <br>  In the 1953 Kentucky Derby, Dark Star was the winner by a nose, and paid $51.80 to win.  The shocker was in who he beat-- Native Dancer, the previously-undefeated favorite and two-year-old champion.  Native Dancer never lost another race, going on to win the Preakness and Belmont and the three-year-old championship, then Horse of the Year in an abbreviated campaign the next year.  Dark Star never won another stakes.  Native Dancer is considered by many racing experts to be among the twenty best American racehorses of all time.  Most racing writers of the time blamed jockey Eric Guerin for the defeat of "the Grey Ghost of Sagamore," as Native Dancer was known.  "He took that colt everywhere on the track except the ladies' room," one writer wrote.  (Some people blamed a jinx against grey horses in the Derby for the defeat, but Determine killed that jinx dead the next year when he won the Derby.)<br>  <br>  Giacomo in 2005 paid $102.60 to win, but the funny thing was that after the race, a lot of handicappers went back to their worksheets and realized that the Derby was taylor-made for a horse with Giacomo's "grind it out" style of running.  The race was packed with speed, and the field went the first six furlongs in 1:09.59, which is creditable racehorse speed for a race of six furlongs, never mind one half a mile longer than that!  Of course, hindsight is always 20:20.<br>  <br>  I feel that Dark Star's upset of Native Dancer has to stand as the biggest upset in Derby history, even if it wasn't the highest payoff of all time.  Given the Dancer's record before and after the Derby and the small margin of victory, it was truly an historic upset of a great champion.|`|e297ec36aa9e3904ff06e84dd4fce511aa	"Dingo Dirtbagg" won the kentucky derby.<br>  No one expected this out of a 48 yr. old horse.|`|t84PabV0aa	Way back when, in the year 1913, a horse sent off at almost 100:1 named Donerail paid $185 for a $2 win bet.  Donerail, til this day, holds the record for the highest-priced odds in the Kentucky Derby, beating out a close second Ten Point.  Donerail was ridden by Jockey Roscoe Goose.  It was a short field of only 8 horses.  To learn more about the Kentucky Derby back then or its great history or to even watch virtual replays of Kentucky Derby races or create Kentucky Derby races with past great champion racehorses, go to www.horseracegame.com.  One other interesting fact - Donerail actually won the race flying in the stretch.  Here's another piece of horse racing nostalgia.  The winner took home just under $5,500 for winning the Kentucky Derby.  Quite a difference from today's $2 million prize pool.
Cb5N6UaQaa	As I have said before, I think that on that subject the NBA has a script that they would like to follow and although I think it will be close at the end between the 2 of them they will just give it to Lebron. I think Kobe is mo0re deserving because he has shown more leadership and cluth presence than Lebron plus the Lakers swept the Cavs and Celtics, which has a lot of importance in a close season when it comes to home court advantage.

I think this just prove that for their record to be almost identical that LBJ is the MVP so far and it will have to take a melt down from him and the Cavs for him to lose it,  <br>  <br>  But I did give you a number that the Lakers have to be up for Kobe to get it and I did agree with you on five and even 5 right now I am not sure it will help Kobe case.|`|jjjgcuduaa	Zero, LeBron's going to win the MVP(it's always decide by the media, and guess who the media backs up?)<br>  <br>  LeBron's Finals MVP will be stolen by Kobe.|`|tBuzrlSdaa	I think maybe 5-10. <br>  BQ: I think they will lead East and meet Lakers vs Cavs in finals Lakers win 4-2|`|m501HwyWaa	i think homecourt adv<br>  will determine the mvp|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	Kobe is a better player but LeBron is more important to his team|`|3crBmyHmaa	Haha i agree with you.|`|oMSTg5rQaa	Dude c'mon, 5 games is not enough. The Lakers as a team have WAY more talent than the Cavs. Kobe would have to significantly out perform Lebron to win another MVP, and he is not.<br>  <br>  Cleveland has improved, but they're roster is no where near as good as the Lakers.<br>  <br>  Pau Gasol > Mo' Williams<br>  <br>  Bynum > Illgauskas<br>  <br>  Fisher/Farmar > Gibson/West (who by the way was injured a good chunk of the 1st half)<br>  <br>  Vujacic, Ariza, Odom, Walton > Wallace, Szscerbiak, Pavlovic, Varejao<br>  <br>  Phil Jackson > Mike Brown<br>  <br>  If Cleveland finishes with at least 60 wins or 2nd in the conference Lebron should win it.<br>  <br>  Kobe won MVP last season over Chris Paul, who in my opinion was just as deserving. It'll be tough justifying another MVP for Kobe against another player (Lebron) who is as worthy.|`|UMthwrPQaa	Honestly, even if the Lakers will win even more games than the Cavs and even hold a better matchup record, I still feel as if the MVP award should go to the the player that helps his team not only win, but become better when he is facilitating.<br>  Only a few players stand out in my mind when that is put into consideration, and those players are Lebron James, Kevin Durant, Chris Paul and Dwayne Wade. Kobe is a great player, maybe even the best player in the game right now, but the Lakers can win without him! if you were to minus any of those guys that i mentioned from their perspective teams, they would have a hard time winning games, and in Durants case? any games at all!<br>  Lebron James "IS" the Cleveland Cavaliers, he means everything to his team, and they would not even be a playoff contender without him, their organization would not have as much people in the stands and even sell a quarter of as much merchandise if he weren't around.<br>  That's why i feel that he will win the MVP, and if i am wrong? then i still feel as if he deserves it.|`|llJv2VjTaa	Stern factor<br>  Lebron obsessed kissing ******<br>  anti Kobe and hater<br>   <br>  If the Cavs stays on 1 or 2 spot in the East there's no way that STERN will let  lebron lose the MVP award even if kobe drops 100pts  this season (exaggeration)|`|H8u7gMAYaa	I think it ultimately comes down to which team has more wins than the other. Because their numbers are right their. We just need to see which team is going to cross the finish line first.|`|HOTtmEsgaa	I agree man.. I think that LeBron really gets a boost off his size advantage. Come on, every night, LeBron has the size advantage over any SF in the league. Why wouldnt he average 28-6-6?? <br>  <br>  He is just doing what is expected to do, and nothing more.<br>  <br>  Kobe makes shots LeBron dreams of and his skill level is nowhere near Kobe's! He'll tell everyone himself that Kobe is the better player.<br>  <br>  Did you know LeBron is a 38% jumpshooter this year?? <br>  <a href="http://www.82games.com/0809/FGSORT7.HTM" rel="nofollow">http://www.82games.com/0809/FGSORT7.HTM</a><br>  <br>  If Kobe and CO win 65 games, he should win the MVP no Q's ASKED!<br>  <br>  THE MVP (Wade's fan):<br>  Kobe wasnt "Struggling". He was playing less minutes, and had to share the ball since this time, another star would be added to the team. Since Bynum went down, he is averaging over 31.0 PPG. <br>  <br>  If you followed the game you'd know that|`|JD5NQxeNaa	Pau Gasol's career high was 44 points and since when did scoring 40+ points suddenly become the measuring stick in deciding which superstar has more help than the other? Tony Delk scored 50 points in an NBA game does that mean he was great help? Pau Gasol is fully capable to score 40 and that is not the only reason he or any other Laker is better help than what LBJ23 has. LBJ23 is taking a team of good players to a great record. With the talent KB24 has around him they should be doing as good as they are.  LBJ23 is having a Grant Hill in his prime season. I would say MJ, but Hill was statistically better than MJ except for PPG. LBJ23 is having a Grant Hill year combined w/ MJ's desire to win. Took his team to the playoffs and Finals quicker than MJ did and has a chance to win one before MJ who won his first in his 7th season. When did Kobe win his first? Exactly, LBJ23 is the MVP this year. You saying that LBJ23 is scoring less and his stats are down cause the supporting cast is better is true. But, hypocritical cause Kobe's stats are lowered 2 because of the increase in his supporting cast. And the fact that LBJ23 still has better stats than Kobe while they both have much improved supporting casts shows why LBJ23 is the MVP among other reasons.|`|u2QhQAxzaa	I think Lebron has already been crowned the MVP, with all this ESPN hype.  Today they compared him to Oscar Robertson, next it will be Michael Jordan.  The Cavs are a one man show, sort of like KOBE back in 05, 06.  And Kobe never won cause he was ball hogging, fast forward to 08 and he becomes a leader and better distributor and he wins his MVP.  Thats why he should win again, cause he is the best person leading his team.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	I don't think its that easy, as just picking a set # of games that would make Kobe more worthy of the MVP than LeBron.  In all honesty, the seasons that they're having, they both are deserving and I can make a case for either of them getting the MVP.<br>  <br>  Overall, I would say LeBron has the edge, but I would actually say the Celtics performance over the rest of the season may determine the MVP just as much as the Lakers and Cavs.  Its rather inevitable that the Lakers will win the West.  If LeBron can't lead the Cavs to the best record in the east, especially with Boston playing without KG for awhile, he loses a lot of his claim to the MVP.|`|qOWJQ7hRaa	I am not sure about that. Because Bulls had the best record in 1996-97 with 69-13, But Karl Malone dethroned Jordan. Celtics are still playing strong, they beat Suns by 20 points without Amare, and themselves without KG. If Lakers want to win the championship, first thing I am 100% sure they have to get NBA best record.|`|vzH7f7V5aa	Even if the Lakers win the rest of thier Games LeBron will still Win MVP.|`|WLXFAeSnaa	I agree with you. I look foward to the MVP race this year!

RyZHhI6aaa	This reminds me of Ruffian.  Frank Whitely always used the same farrier and he happened not to be licensed in New York because he was horse shoeing for many years before New York instituted the requirement that you take a test before you're licensed to shoe... he didn't feel like he needed to take a test administered by someone much younger than him to prove that he could shoe horses, so he just didn't.  Anyway, he was always shoeing for Frank Whitely and it never seemed to be a problem until the Great Match, then the New York people started throwing a fit... Whitely's response was that either the farrier could shoe his horses or Ruffian wasn't running in the match race.<br>  <br>  I don't know anything about Becca, but I'm guessing that he carries on business as usual.  But if he has another run-in with the Santa Anita Stewards, he'll be facing quite a sanction.|`|PwZZJh1taa	funny thing about the backside of a racetrack, its not like the rest of the world. for instance i have seen serious fights, drug use, theft, etc. of course there is security, but WTF if these types of things happened outside the main gate they would be arrested, but instead its a trip to see the stewards and  compared to what would happen in reality on the outside, well lets just say its a walk in the park. <br>  to be honest with you, if you have all the facts correct,  mr becca  could be entering into a lawsuit vs. fairplex. ALL racetracks have security and if he was unlicensed he should have never been allowed acces to the backside much less conduct business. there is also another potential suit vs.  the security co as they are part at fault for this mishaps. also the trainer and owner are left open here to be sued too. i'm sure becca will be speaking to an attorney and will not turn the other cheek, that is if he still has one.
c4b596d15eac948f611f72b6a99f85a0aa	I prefer the 3-4 but it requires certain players (hybrid OLB/DE's and a good NT) to run it effectively.<br>  <br>  3-4-Athleticism<br>  4-3-Balance|`|AA12170560	Multiple 4-3 Defense is the best.<br>  <br>  3-4 is a thing for the pros and best suited to a league of exceptional short passes and outside runs. If all a team knows is 3-4 and they get burnt on the draw, the counter, and QB sneak...what do they have left to revert to...? The 4-3.<br>  <br>  3-4 demands Linebacker type Defensive Ends with incredible speed.<br>  The linebackers need to have Safety type speed.<br>  <br>  4-3 is ideal for linebackers that think football and react.<br>  Right side Defensive end should be the quickest of the two.<br>  <br>  It dedicates 4 men to the attack and allows a coach to alternate Dog Blitzes (Linebackers) at will. And leaves sufficient secondary coverage for passes.<br>  <br>  In a Cover 3 you can free up an additional blitz man.<br>  <br>  LOVE the 4-3|`|MarZxLVRaa	Personally I like 3-4 better. If you think about it 3 DL to rush the QB is enough and if they run you still have 4 LB to tackle him. Ive always preferred 3-4 and i like watching it more to.|`|nlIpKw8Paa	4-3 cause i like the speedy de ends the 3- 4 is usually two big ends to hold the o-line for the line backers to sack the qb.|`|zXT9KTaFaa	I hate the 3-4 .i play d-line and i'm always getting doubled team. which pisses me off. I want to sack the quarterback|`|9IyIO0Qkaa	I love the 4-3 its the way to go|`|NHrbbZKVaa	The 4-3 is the better defense.<br>  <br>  In the 4-3 it's most important to have strong defensive tackles and middle linebacker. i.e. Ravens - Ray Lewis,  Bucs - Derrick Brooks, Bears - Urlacher. Corners don't need to be really fast playing a cover 2 and the safeties are responsible for one side of the field in most cases<br>  <br>  In the 3-4 the most important people are the linebackers and nose tackle. i.e. Steelers, Cowboys,Patriots, Chargers, (weren't so good without Shawn Merriman).|`|gVkb75R1aa	I am a huge fan of the traditional 4-3 defense.  You can do much more with much less in this system, but it all boils down to what players are on your roster.  If you have a very strong front 4 you can have a huge advantage by not needing to blitz often, while still getting pressure on the QB. <br>  On the other hand, if you have the horses to run a 3-4 it can be quite nasty to attempt to set up blocking schemes against.  If you have some freak athletes like a DeMarcus Ware as well as a stud nose guard like an Albert Haynesworth that can be explosive without a particular gap to control...ouch.  <br>  In short I think the 4-3 is better since I believe keeping the pressure off your LB's with a strong front 4 allows you to make more plays in more areas of the game.<br>  4-3 needs instinctive LB play with a strong front 4.  3-4 needs freak talent at OLB and a huge disruptive nose.|`|5hoZknHjaa	i like the 3-4 gives the linebackers more versatility and calls for a stronger defensive line, especially nose tackle<br>  <br>  the 4-3 relys more on defensive ends and makes the linebackers work more in coverage (less linebacker blitzing)
KzpZBMVOaa	Well I would tell you "no its never too late", but ultimately it is up to you to decide that. Who am I to tell you "yes its too late" or "no its not"?

Now its obviously not the same motion over hand to under hand, but the same physics are involved.  Being a better pitcher takes much experience, it's not something learned over night.  Be aware of different situations even if you're not pitching, for example remembering a batters weakness, if they like to chase away or if they lay off inside pitches.  Whetther or not they let the first pitch go and the importance of getting that first pitch strike. Or vice versa if you know they are more likely to swing at the first pitch, get them to swing at junk. Or the importance of keeping the ball down with runners on to induce ground balls to greater your chances at getting out lead runners.   What you need to do is make them swing at your pitch not theres.

The statue of Liberty is a misdirection play where the quarterback fakes a pass in one direction, while at the same time handing the ball to a runner going the other way.  It was executed perfectly by Boise State at the end of the Fiesta Bowl.  The QB faked a pass right, and the whole offense moved in that direction, and he reached around with the ball behind his back and handed to the running back, who took it to the left untouched into the end zone|`|88cca0e96f42ca1ed48af71b4dd3dfc9aa	Usually the wideout on whichever side of the field the running back will be running towards runs a route to the middle of the field taking everyone to the wrong side of the field.  If the QB has good protection he will look for a reciever then start to move his arm back to pass and the back who was blocking will run towards him and actually take the ball from him in a wuick motion and hope he is fast enough to make it to the endzone.|`|ac7f218272d7280d4ed6dfb3343ec934aa	it begins with a short pass usually up the middle with a wideout cutting below the person who caught the football who then laterels it to the wideout in hopes of misleading the defense|`|e780daeebcd8c1306d972c70b1811da2aa	To the first guy that posted.  That is called the hook and ladder.  That should be easy since the receiver runs a hook route and then laterals the ball.<br>  <br>  The statue of liberty play is actually where the running is handed off the ball and acts like he is going to pass the ball.  While in the motion of passing the ball another back comes up and snatches the ball and runs.<br>  <br>  Boise State pulled off a variation of it on the two point conversion.  Instead the quarterback faked the pass to a wide reciever without the ball in that hand.  He reaches behind his back with the other hand and ball and gives it to the running back who then runs.|`|45b7b346be14fbbdb8030aafa8343b32aa	In it, the QB pump fakes a pass to a reciever, but with the ball in the other hand, he hands it behind him without looking.  It can really fool the defense because they move to the pass that they think is coming, but is not.  Boise State ran it against Oklahoma to win the game in OT.|`|80fca4dfb55d54f257547327c03d5f02aa	is the play that boise state used to beat oklahoma.  two points conversion.  too lazy to explain it. tricking the defense by faking a pass.
eDaupZ3haa	try to build the muscles everywhere in your leg. id recommend strenthening all ur knee muscles, and ur thighs. good things for that would be squats, LUNGES with freeweights, and leg press. hope u get wat u want|`|ab7ae7ea2d56270091d9220ea63d85c2aa	If you are a running back, you better put on weight, do squats, power cleans and power press', switch each workout up, one day do wide grip bench, the next do close grip, and do that for every excercise.  After each workout eat a lot of protein.

Lift like every other day and work out only one part of your body.|`|jNFPQEHfaa	The answer is  yes, and no...If by "stronger" you mean increase strength but not muscle mass, no you will gain some weight with strength, (muscle is heavier than fat)<br>  however, that having been said, you CAN decrease body fat percentage without gaining mass by simply burning more calories than you consume.<br>  marathon runners are very lean often below 9%, olympic hockey players average about 12%, short version, more exercise with less weight swim,bicycle, run, for lean muscles , fewer reps with heavier weight for larger mass( fun fact -abdominal muscles become visible in men at 10% or lower)

AA12246142	Yo creo que debe ser la incidencia de varios factores. <br>  Hugo Sanchez fue un gran jugador que tiene una vasta experiencia como miembro de clubes de "primer" mundo, donde realmente se tiene una mentalidad de sed de triunfo, cosa que por lo visto no hay mucho aquí. Y que NINGUN jugador mexicano hasta ahorita ha igualado.<br>  Además, las autoridades del futbol en México son verdaderas Mafias, donde como la consabida cubeta de cangrejos, donde si uno sale los demás lo jalan de regreso, y más si el cangrejo que iba para afuera les echó de frijolazos dejando en evidencia sus tranzas y malos manejos por muuuchos a?os.<br>  Tercero, falta un buen equipo. La verdad, aunque los miembros de la selección mexicana sean de lo "mejorcito" de los clubes no creo que destaquen a nivel de muy buen o excelente jugador que se pueda ver en otros países.

YYqrT4jBaa	First off N2 and HPA are the same thing and they are just different names for compressed air tanks (High Pressure Air and Nitrogen).<br>  <br>  If you're playing above 55-60*F then CO2 should be fine on a Ion unless you're shooting fast. In other words, CO2 works fine on a Ion for woodsball/scenario style play. If you're playing speedball don't even consider the CO2 as liquid CO2 will damage your internals and you'll get liquid CO2 in the gun if you're shooting fast.<br>  <br>  If I was in your place I would just get a tank off of Amazon. Amazon usually isn't the best for paintball gear but in your case it will be fine. <br>  <br>  P.S. 4500psi N2/HPA tanks are carbon fiber and a ton lighter than steel 3000psi tanks. Makes it less likely to rip out your tank threads.|`|QTd8MVDjaa	If you're gonna use CO2, get an anti-siphon tube put in the tank. this will keep the marker from sucking in any liquid CO2. But sill, HPA is better for the Ion.|`|oDEtXTjNaa	ok first of all Co2 fluctuates with the weather changes so you never know how many shots out of it your going to get, and paintball guns can also <br>  lower the shot counts as well.Co2 if it changes back to its liquid form it can destroy the board and most of its internals.<br>  <br>  HPA is your best bet then n2 and co2-i dont use n2 cause its explosive <br>  if i remember right,<br>  <br>  hpa cant harm you gun cause its air and wont freeze a ball on its way out like c02<br>  <br>  I have a pure energy 68ci 4500psi air tank(HPA) and have had no problems with it.<br>  <br>  for the price you can always try going to a different country's website and buy it that way could be cheeper could not.<br>  now i dont know the  price exchange from usa to newZealand but heres some sites i buy from<br>  1)paintballShowcase.com (i get team discounts from them)this site isnt like realy big its only ran by one guy, he has alot more stuff that not on his site so just email him if you want something thats not on the site its self.<br>  2)<a href="http://www.assailantpaintball.com/CARBONFIBERAIRSYSTEMS.HTML" rel="nofollow">http://www.assailantpaintball.com/CARBON...</a><br>  3)firstcallpaintball.com<br>  4)gatewaypaintball.com<br>  5)paintballdiscounter.com<br>  6)discountpaintball.com<br>  <br>  If you have anymore question's about paintball just email me  @<br>  <a href="http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&friendid=141645428" rel="nofollow">http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fus...</a>|`|RuJYupFWaa	You can get steel hpa tanks for $50 US.  Not sure how much they are out there but that's way cheaper than $400.<br>  <br>  Co2 has to be anti-siphoned for use on the Ion.  It's also recommended that you replace the Ion's regulator with one that can handle co2, like the Palmer's Stabilizer.  The irony in that, though, is the Stabilizer costs more than a steel hpa tank.

ZDOUwJsbaa	It is possible but please do not go to the hardware store and pick up a couple cans of spray paint. The glock is made of a polymer which is a type of plastic. Spray paint will stick to this but not well. It will wear off over time and will wear immediately in areas there there are moving parts. You need a product called Duracoat. This stuff sticks to just about anything and is made specifically for firearms applications. <br>  <br>  The best thing to do is take your gun to a gunsmith to have this done. If you don't want to pay the extra money for them to do it you can do it yourself. Go to <a href="http://www.duracoat-finishes.com/." rel="nofollow">http://www.duracoat-finishes.com/.</a> This stuff is amazing I have had many firearms duracoated. The stuff is virtually bulletproof.

792ac6ebd5c44d8272e1655f9759b532aa	Ramonce was the Longhorns 'home run threat', meaning any time he touched the ball he might end up in the endzone. So that aspect will be missed, but as for his yardage and stuff, his leaving will just give more chances for Selvin Young and Jamaal Charles, not to mention some of the incoming freshman like Vondrell McGee or Antwan Cobb might get some playing time now. <br>  <br>  Ramonce also played a role in the passing game, but that is another area in which Texas is not hurting for depth. Quan Cosby has RT's speed and big play ability. Not to mention Billy Pittman and Limas Sweed are back. Add to that group Jordan Shipley, who, if he can keep himself healthy, will probably be the best of the group by the end of his career.<br>  <br>  So I think Texas will get along just fine without RT. As much as I loved him while he was on the field, he just couldn't get his act together off it, and that's a shame.|`|45b7b346be14fbbdb8030aafa8343b32aa	There won't be a huge drop off in the running game, but there will be some.|`|d4f0c0a3698273f51a07a2535f8a10e2aa	alot a new qb and a new rb it will be a mess
45b7b346be14fbbdb8030aafa8343b32aa	Roy Williams is clearly better.  He puts his body on the line on every play.  He has made many game saving and winning plays (game against Philly last year when he picked off Donovan and ran 50 yards for the TD.  Also the game in college when he flew like superman to knock the ball into teammate's hands to clinch the win.)  He can cover, stop the run, and hit like a train.  My vote Roy Williams.|`|14ff8f7cfe712e75bf1be04762801d16aa	Roy williams|`|1cfa9270d1c6e8bb6bfbce5bedb8c085aa	I got to go with Roy Williams.

Just in case you didn't know, the Rebels have a new QB this year by the name of Brent Schaeffer...  remember him !!!  He was kicked out of Tennessee his freshman year in 2004, he went to Junior College for a year and transferred to Mississippi.  Last year he racked up over 2,900 yards passing and 40 TD's, to go along with 800 rushing yards and 10 TD's on the ground.<br>  <br>  Playing at the JUCO level last year will help him as he makes his way back into the SEC where he has pretty decent talent playing along side him.  And lets not forget he has SEC experience already cause he saw major action as a Vol and even had a few starts.  Schaeffer's athleticism alone will have the Rebels competitive in all their games this year, and defenses will have to tailor their game plans to try to take him out of his comfort zone.  So keep an eye out for Ole Miss.  Worst case scenario, they'll go 6-6 and play in the Independence Bowl.|`|45b7b346be14fbbdb8030aafa8343b32aa	Arkansas.

023f22ac6560e16745155f89fb08f051aa	He's not getting a sign and trade deal. The Kings don't want to spend any more money and a sign and trade means taking on more contracts. So he will be signing a 1 year contract with someone. He's just waiting to see if something better materialises. As of now, most teams are over the cap, so unless he wants to wait for the Atlanta debacle to be over in the hope that they'll want another small forward (they won't  - they just traded Al Harrington!), he's going to have to pick a team that will showcase him while still winning games. I predict a one year contract with New Orleans or Sacramento or Boston or Minnesotta or Houston. Most likely Houston in the hope that T-Mac gets injured and he becomes the main backcourt player.|`|87d532f0f3005dc368d431ef1ca0d6a3aa	The Kings offered him a 5 yr. 38 million deal with he rejected.

He did not break the starting lineup until week 7, but recorded 6 sacks in his first 4 starts. In 2005, his rookie season, Merriman was honored by being voted into the Pro Bowl in Hawaii. He was voted into the Pro Bowl as an OLB having played the pass-rushing OLB position for the San Diego Chargers in their 3-4 defensive scheme. This is the same position he played in college.<br>  <br>  Merriman's best game of the year came in week 15 when the Chargers handed the Indianapolis Colts their first loss of the season. Merriman recorded 2 sacks and 2 tackles for a loss, one of which stopped Peyton Manning for a 6 yard loss on 4th and goal. It was during this game that Shawne Merriman garnered much national media coverage and in the following week made the Pro Bowl.<br>  <br>  On January 4, 2006, Merriman was awarded with the The Associated Press Defensive Rookie of the Year award. He received 28 1/2 votes of a panel of 50 NFL sportswriters and broadcasters. He beat the likes of Seattle Seahawks linebacker Lofa Tatupu, who received 16 1/2 votes. Other players to receive votes were Cincinnati linebacker Odell Thurman, with 4, and Dallas linebacker Demarcus Ware, with one.<br>  <br>  On February 12, 2006, Merriman participated in the 2006 NFL Pro Bowl in Honolulu, Hawaii. Although in a losing effort, Merriman made 3 tackles and forced one fumble. “I enjoyed myself the whole entire week,” said Merriman. “I topped it off today by playing the entire game with all the guys I grew up watching. It’s going to be my first of many if I just keep working hard in addition to using steroids on a regular basis.”<br>  <br>  In 2006, Merriman again began his season with success, recording 3 sacks and an interception in his first 2 games. Merriman went on to record 8.5 sacks and make ESPN's midseason all-pro team. [1], prior to dropping an appeal against a NFL enforced 4 week suspension.<br>  <br>  In the 2006 regular season, Merriman led the league in sacks with 17 while playing only 12 games. He also added 4 forced fumbles to his career (2 BUF, and 2 in DEN). The last of the 4 was recovered near the goal line (in Denver) setting LaDanian Tomlinson up for his record breaking 29th TD of the season. Merriman has come off suspension and proved he is a disruptive force on defense, forcing offensives to scheme around him (to little avail) and making his name heard by sacking the QB, forcing fumbles, batting down passes and more. Merriman finished third in the balloting for 2006 Associated Press Defensive Player of the Year, behind Jason Taylor and Champ Bailey.|`|1bfbbf3f1fe6b39539752f1b1be9e4baaa	The lamest dance of any NFL player ever... man I hate his little dance...

He's had some really memorable moments and matches, like his "I Quit" match against JBL at Judgment Day, his stare-down with Batista at the '05 Royal Rumble, etc. He's got the charisma to get an audience to cheer for him all the way, or boo him out of the arena(he was my favorite heel on SD in '03).

He won the first Elimination Chamber, he put Bret Hart in the sharpshooter, he's even SuperKicked Hulk Hogan! Weather you like him or not, he's still himself. He can be funny in DX, or serious as a real-life born-again christian. His last three WrestleMania matches have one PWI's prestegous match of the yeat award. This year's match could easily make #4.<br>  <br>  <br>  So the facts have been presented, it's Cena's charisma and brute-force against HBK's legendary status. The verdict: HBK wins by pinfall 1, 2, 3. I may be a big Cena fan, but I'd love to see Michaels as WWE champ again. Hey, put Cena on SD after 'Mania and have him fight for the Heavyweight belt, I'd love to see that too!|`|rHCA1wz2aa	hbk all the way!!!!!!!!

The report says he had a hardening and narrowing of the arteries that supply the heart with blood and oxygen. <br>  <br>  The coroner's did not address what led to the heart trouble, although the wrestler's wife, Vickie Guerrero, said last month on WWE.com's website that his past substance abuse, the use of steroids and aggressive workout regimen were major contributors to his heart failure.<br>  <br>  Following Guerrero's death, WWE announced the institution of a drug testing policy to screen for steroids and other drugs.

So at least 8-8 is my guess.

That topic might have been popular before the trade deadline, but the chances of it being brought up again is slim.

You have probably lost most of your endurance from smoking and have not stretched for a while. Take it slow!! Well, you need to start stretching routinely again.  That is probably the most important along with building up your endurance.  Then I would spend about an hour or so a day practicing and drills with the techniques you already know.  After a couple of weeks you should ease back into it again when you start classes officially

8VuyhvQ0aa	Backyard trampolines and competitive trampolines are two totally different things. A lot of kids get hurt on backyard trampoline because they jump several people at a time and bounce each other off or try doing skills that they have not been properly trained to do. Competetive trampolines are designed to minimize injuries by being a rectangular shape and having much better padding with mats attached to the ends. Also by taking classes with trained instructors who can teach you skills that are appropriate for your level along with making sureyou have proper technique your chance of injury is much smaller.|`|AA11202302	I took trampoline in conjunction with gymnastics when I was a child. It is fun. It's SUPER fun. It's also VERY dangerous. Nothing bad ever happened to me, but my TEACHER seriously injured herself by landing on the edge of the trampoline (where the springs are).<br>  <br>  Also, I was once involved with the opening ceremonies for an international sporting event, and there were trampolinists involved.

NaI2wAHzaa	Look at what the Missouri Valley departees have done lately when they left for what were actually better jobs at the time (not just more money, but better jobs).  Bruce Weber went from SIU to Illinois and the Championship game in just 2 years.  Stallings is doing well at Vandy.  Matt Painter is recruiting well at Purdue.  Dana Altman was smart enough to realize Arkansas was not much better than his prior job at Kansas State.  If you like defense, hire a Valley coach.<br>  <br>  And if you look at it, Mark Turgeon has more experience as a head coach than Billy Gillespie did when they hired Gillespie at Texas A&M.

X8yJHJgOaa	I know what you are talking about. I don't know of another name for it.  As far as how to do it...start like you are going into a handstand (one foot in front of the other and hands straight up in the air) then pick up the back leg and when learning put your fingertips right in front of the foot you leave on the ground. Then you turn on the foot that you are standing on.  Pick up your heel and use your hands to push you around.  Eventually you can do it by just kicking your back leg and turning the bottom foot. (and swinging your arms) I start with my hands in the air and throw them down by my side then finish with them out for balance.  Good luck.  These look very impressive if you do it right!|`|2664e2801babaadef216c4b1c17f9603aa	I'm in the same situation you are, it requires a lot of flexibility.

njfuNdX9aa	Before doing your split, get into a lunge position with your back knee on the ground, your front foot on the ground and sitting up straight. Make sure your front knee is not extending past your toes, and make sure your back leg is all the way upside down and in a straight line. Then, with your hands on your hips, press your hips forward and hold for one minute. <br>  <br>  After one minute, completely straighten your front leg, but keeping your back leg bent, knee on the ground. Put your hands on the floor near your front foot. If you are keeping your knee straight, you should feel a great stretch in your hamstring muscle. Once again, hold this stretch for one minute.<br>  <br>  Now slide all the way into your split. Practice keeping your back leg completely turned upside down. Don't let your knee slide out. Keep your hips square, or keep your belly-button facing forward. Lock your front knee out and point your toes. Hold for one minute or more. <br>  <br>  Repetition and good form will help out alot. Good Luck!|`|AA10783121	do the splitsand hold them for a few minutes a day i did this and got my split in a month

RYoMfoc1aa	well as a collegiate High jumper I have tried those and lets just say I have only used them once!! Maybe I overtrained in them but My calfs felt shredded and heavy and I strongly belive in just sticking to the plyometrics drills in regular soled shoes. Its worth the try and you may get a better result as I did!!|`|Dm2UXfhLaa	My legs felt light. Not really sore, but I guess it depends on what workout you followed.<br>  <br>  I followed the 8 week program.
RpH0i3c3aa	no|`|WrDGhduxaa	NO. You should not run with a stress fracture. A fracture is a fracture, is a fracture. Swim, run in deep water, bike, do not run. STOP NOW. If you continue to run it will get worse.|`|DgsZYlfYaa	No you should not run anyway! You will damage yourself even more. You don't want to make it so you wouldn't be able to run permanently would you? Don't run, get better first.|`|FQBOzv4Saa	Stop now, it could get much worse especially if you run a marathon. Sit and let it heal or the worst you could be in a cast.|`|Gva0qq3Yaa	No fracture is minor.<br>  It had to be cause by overtraining stresses.  Non weight bearing therapeutic exercise and rest are the main physical therapy prescription for this.    <br>  Do not run the race.|`|zAfCqDW7aa	you need to take some time off or it will get worse. dont ignore it
c6fd002f468e8d1f0aaf2d660d40979baa	Everything...start with management, they have good players, just not for this ballpark or team philosophy.  Why the f u c k did they pay Vincent Padilla all that money?!  Millwood is a number 3 guy at best who has to be the ace.  His last year in Cleveland was just for the new contract.  McCarthy is good, but he gives up a lot of fly balls, and in that ballpark, everything flies over the fence.  Gagne was just a silly investent.  Good thing it was for 1-yr, kudos for that.  Then the offense.  Lofton is good, but old.  His arm is weak.  So much for the D.  Teixera is notoriously slow starting off the year.  I don't even know why he switch-hits, cuz he is sooo much better on his strong side.  Blalock is deteriorating, and Sosa and Wilkerson just swing for the fences, or rack up the K's.  That basically leaves Michael Young, who cannot carry an offense by himself.  Ron Washington has a mess, and it's not his fault the nice guy can't put it together...yet|`|1a227f96979bb4c2e8266aad21bd8a05aa	pitching!!!! they have a 5.15 era this season which is only 12th out of 14 teams. only tb and seattle have worse pitching staffs. in the AL that's just not gonna cut it. everyone in the AL can score runs|`|969327fdca64f7daf8de1d2c63956608aa	I was thinking the same thing...but they have won 2 in a row...and last night they put up a ton of runs against the best pitcher in baseball (Roy Halladay) and they won a close won tonight.  They've got to come around..Tex and Blaylock will start hitting eventually.  Tex is the key and when he gets on a roll they'll start winning.|`|AA11695641	I thought it was just a part of being from Texas. I know that after Texas played USC in the 2006 Rose Bowl the Rose Bowl had to fumigated for 2 months just to get rid of the stink.|`|Gj317FwPaa	because they have bad players,a bad coach, or they just dont mesh as a team..<br>  <br>  maybe they are just having an off season|`|t3wkh6qeaa	Hank Blalock's drinking problem.|`|AA11603761	Maybe they don't have the money to buy a winning team?|`|FQBOzv4Saa	because the owner is horrible and they thought sammy sosas would be the savior
1cKm3h0Iaa	depends on the situation, if its like league finals or a big meet chances are that you are going to PR cause you'll get the adrenaline pumping. But just keep focusing on being consistent. Good Job!|`|W6GgvnTpaa	Yes and no because your getting into shape your time should go down. No because the weather might be humid,cold, windy,ect.
evAaDwKFaa	the ideal length for a 400 is about 1/4 of an inch...<br>  <br>  hope you get this in time for your meet!<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|JFLFGZ9yaa	If the others broke in the last meet, probably they were too long for the track you were running on.  If the track is hard, you could either put blanks in your spikes or not wear spikes at all.  Running in spikes on a hard track is the fastest way to mess them up.
ec9f57769588a5e337195176afcd54a6aa	To a championship? No. The Celtics extended him because they liked the improvement their young players showed, they liked how they responded to his coaching. I think with a young team, he's a good coach to have to develop young talent. They'll keep him on for a while, but once this young team gets older, more experienced, and can work its way back into the playoffs, they'll bring in someone else to get them to a higher level.|`|FQBOzv4Saa	yea... everyone knew and even the owner told him to throw the season for oden because of ALL the injuries to the team|`|569a732038592960f6503f6fa0dc2dfaaa	well he threw enough games to get a contract extension,  probably because management promised him this extension if he did so; now they have a good chance at getting oden or durant, and one of those guys could possibly help Doc get to 'the promised land'.... so mission accomplished.|`|63df8e444393fa4ca063d3004e3afd23aa	I am not convinced he can, but I really, really do hope I'm wrong.|`|GuANX6kiaa	he's a good coach|`|b566daf940816dc2e7b7431486bc6a98aa	no, hes a 4 season coach and the celtics are one of the worst teams in the nba period<br>  Who do you seriously think can make them any better|`|P0fCdgKbaa	If they can land Greg Oden or Kevin Durant, then I think that Doc Rivers will have a fun time riding one of their coatails|`|u8WMxxWJaa	he can lead them to another losing season andmiss the playoffs like usual
VXb2NLpqaa	it is very important.  It is important because if you dont have good upper body strength and good core strength it will cause you to be fast but slow down much faster than you want. You want to be able to run fast for a long period of time before starting to slow down. so it is good to work on chest and ab strength along with your arms and legs.|`|173ee88785d3e9cf606489826df44f0caa	Sprinting is, in a way, a stength sport. It is maximum effort and output in the shortest  amount of time possible.  Maximum leg strength (not be confused with muscle mass) would equal maximum speed for the runner.
tAfvkGVcaa	A fencing club.  It's great fun, i used to be pretty good at it once upon a time (5th under 18 in Britain).  You would probably want to take up either Sabre (slashing) or epee (can remember how to spell it. Poking)|`|Km9QC8a9aa	I would suggest that you either join a fencing club or think about taking up:<br>  <br>  Tai Chi Jian (sword)<br>  <br>  Each discipline has it's own sword forms.<br>  <br>  You can watch videos of 3 different Jian forms at:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.taiji.de/taiji/head5e/index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.taiji.de/taiji/head5e/index.h...</a><br>  <br>  Personally, I prefer the walking stick because it is a weapon that you can carry on the street!<br>  .|`|AA10023524	Samurai sword? Tai Chi sword? Epee? Foil?<br>  <br>  There are as many places to go as there are kinds of swords.|`|8QrtcqLmaa	a ki-aikido dojo. I personally don't like fencing. I find that they don't teach you how to defend from behind. YO could also learn to fight in a shaolin-do school (they got tones of swords)|`|INXUP06gaa	Go to a fencing club, you can do either foil epee or sabre.  In Rockwall, Tx where I live, I go to the Rise Fencing Academy.|`|NwCnF4Qaaa	a fencing club would be a good idea. but there is an Asian sport wherein they use swords and sticks as an implement. its called arnis. I've tried it,it's really fun and enjoyable..|`|NRf9dYixaa	there is  a form of martial arts called ken do, Ive actually been kinda interested in it. its like fencing, but the Japanese style using shinaie and wooden bokkens. looks like a lot of fun check it out on the net, or in your phone book.
k0WbeaNBaa	There is actually another question that is still open that is more of a thank you Sabres, but a lot of Sabres faithful chimed in and wished the Sens luck.  I agree that they earned their place in the finals.  I'm not ready to crown them yet though.  Anaheim made things very interesting last night and Detroit has plenty to be fired up about.  Either will be worthy opponents.<br>  <br>  I wish the Sens good luck, but I'm not sure that I'll be rooting for them.  They took it to Buffalo and deserved to win that series.  Buffalo lost the series in the first 2 games.  I will cringe a little during game 1 when they hit the ice instead of us.  But they earned the position they are in right now and hats off to them.|`|3f43024b890acb9ec398f800fe6b3de7aa	It would be nice to see the Sens and the Ducks go at it for the cup.  It is good for the NHL as a whole when the cup is "rotated" to cities that have never won it.  It creates a better fan base (better revenue) and less chances for a bankruptcy.  (Bankruptcies in my opinion hurt the entire NHL).|`|C1aFhbUMaa	Nice.  A little class in a world gone mad.|`|OLREVQZTaa	Good sportsmanship, i'm a leaf fan so even though i'm canadian i was hoping the sabres would wipe out the sen's.  However since i am canadian, i will definetly be cheering on the sen's now that they're in the finals.  Cool fact; any year that end's in a 7 (i.e, 1997 or 1967, etc) either a canadian team or the detroit red wings have won the stanely cup!|`|kx2bD5d8aa	I like the class, but the best part is you will be screaming for blood next year.  You keep your respectable standing with me.|`|myxRsswlaa	No way. The best teams are out. (In my opinion)
UXEnuXVWaa	Your friend should be able to play for your school next year as far as i see it. If he has no health problems, then he's good to go.|`|3ADV4epqaa	definitely.

swAiwbVdaa	Its time football fans across the country realise they are being taken for a ride. Sadly, even at those prices the game is sold out so, you can expect prices to be even higher in the future.|`|dKYT0jM3aa	bloody hell,thats steap! get ahir.|`|3kvq08cwaa	NO WAY YOUR HAVIN A LAUGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|dEjF2KHVaa	i went to wembley yesterday to watch shewsbury and mine started from ￡24 up. i know they would be cheaper but the price you paid is ridiculous. i think you've been conned. go to the websire, that should give you prices. <br>  the stadium is brilliant, it's worth going!|`|vakue9WQaa	i know its not good like i know its good but like its a nice stiaum but thats wrong|`|ybavkbiraa	This is very wrong....however the tickets are the things that ake in the most money... they need the cash and that is why beefburgers are ￡8 and a pit is ￡6...it is ludicrus but this is what footall is becoming...a whole big showing off competion...they should all go play in a field
CKP98samaa	NO!  It eats away at the aluminum bats.  I've seen one shatter before my eyes in a high school game.  It wasn't a vexxum, it was a TPX bat, but the stuff eats away at the bat.  I haven't seen anything like that before.  If you want a good grip, take off the rubber gripping, replace it with white tape...not thick, just wrap it around once.  Then from there, you can add stick grip on there and you're good.  This will make the bat a bit lighter and give you more bat speed, as well as making the handle more narrow.|`|4MncMBt5aa	with a brand new $300 bat i wouldnt mess w/ it at all until it gets old and the grip gets worn out but thats just me|`|c6b174a5ef9e67a87adb82418d1f9673aa	First of all it's pine tar.<br>  <br>  And my suggestion is no because with a non wooden bat and batting gloves you get all the grip you need.

jwvKTPQvaa	I dont think its ever to late to start learning,  Lacrosse is an awesome sport (its actually our official national summer sport here in Canada).  What position you try out for should depend on you skills<br>  Attack:<br>  The attackman's responsibility is to score goals. The attackman generally restricts his play to the offensive end of the field. A good attackman demonstrates excellent stick work with both hands and has quick feet to maneuver around the goal. Each team should have three attackmen on the field during play.<br>  <br>  Midfield:<br>  The midfielder's responsibility is to cover the entire field, playing both offense and defense. The midfielder is a key to the transition game, and is often called upon to clear the ball from defense to offense. A good midfielder demonstrates good stick work including throwing, catching and scooping. Speed and stamina are essential. Each team should have three midfielders on the field.<br>  <br>  Defense:<br>  The defenseman's responsibility is to defend the goal. The defenseman generally restricts his play to the defensive end of the field. A good defenseman should be able to react quickly in game situations. Agility and aggressiveness are necessary, but great stick work is not essential to be effective. Each team should have three defensemen on the field.<br>  <br>  Goal:<br>  The goalie's responsibility is to protect the goal and stop the opposing team from scoring. A good goalie also leads the defense by reading the situation and directing the defensemen to react. A good goalie should have excellent hand/eye coordination and a strong voice. Quickness, agility, confidence and the ability to concentrate are also essential. Each team has one goalie in the goal during play.<br>  <br>  Tailor a work out and practice program to the position you want to play,  it never hurts to be a well-rounded player.<br>  Here is a list of skills to work on:<br>  <br>  Catching: The act of receiving a passed ball with the crosse.<br>  <br>  Checking: The act of attempting to dislodge the ball from an opponent's stick.<br>  <br>  Poke Check: A stick check in which the player pokes the head of his stick at an opponent's stick through the top hand by pushing with the bottom hand.<br>  <br>  Slap Check: A stick check in which a player slaps the head of his stick against his opponent's stick.<br>  <br>  Wrap Check: A one-handed check in which the defender swings his stick around his opponent's body to dislodge the ball. (This check is only legal at the highest level of play.)<br>  <br>  Cradling: The coordinated motion of the arms and wrists that keeps the ball secure in the pocket and ready to be passed or shot when running.<br>  <br>  Cutting: A movement by an offensive player without the ball, toward the opponent's goal, in anticipation of a feed and shot.<br>  <br>  Feeding: Passing the ball to a teammate who is in position for a shot on goal.<br>  <br>  Passing: The act of throwing the ball to a teammate with the crosse.<br>  <br>  Scooping: The act of picking up a loose ball with the crosse.<br>  <br>  Screening: An offensive tactic in which a player near the crease positions himself so as to block the goalkeeper's view of the ball.<br>  <br>  Shooting: The act of throwing the ball with the crosse toward the goal in an attempt to score|`|0DLLgPazaa	It's not too late to start.

5d3858b6dd1cf12ed8769906cd99ad5aaa	A regulation mound is 18 feet in diameter, with the center 59 feet from the rear point of home plate, on the line between home plate and second base. The front edge of the pitcher's plate or rubber is 18 inches behind the center of the mound, making the front edge's midpoint 60 feet 6 inches from the rear point of home plate. Six inches in front of the pitcher's rubber the mound begins to slope downward.

zlOzF78gaa	Hi, Lets start out with your first question of what lax equipment to get: Because this is your first year playing, I wouldn't go with anything too expensive. Lacrosse equipment can cost a ton of money, so start cheap. But you are going to need shoulder pads, elbow pads, gloves, helmet, and a stick. I would suggest ebay for all of these things. Ebay is always a decent price.<br>  <br>  Second question: You need to learn to cradle, pass, and shoot with BOTH HANDS. I can not stress that enough! Practice on both hands until you are perfect at it, then practice some more.<br>  <br>  Any stick would work for you, because you are just starting. But make sure it has an offset head. You should also try to buy it "pre-strung". I hope I answered all of your questions. Good Luck!|`|dtMY9cByaa	The absolute best gear is made by STX, followed by Brine. I would look for a store like "play it again sports" or see if your school has any equipment. <br>  <br>  I had a STX chest protector and Brine padded pants when I played goalie for girls lax

pTd2nDq9aa	ok in NJ and NYC you cant.  Well, you could try but in the long string of paperwork (that ill explain momentarily) odds are that you will get denied and have the police very interested in you for quite some time. <br>  <br>  In PA I believe is like most other states.  You have to fill out a form 4 with the batf, get fingerprinted, have the Chief Law Enforcement Officer or a judge from felony cases sign the paperwork, and pay a $200 tax stamp.  BEFORE you are allowed to own any automatic weapon.  They will do a full background check and much more.   IF it is passed, then they will contact you with the paperwork to take to your friendly dealer.  <br>  <br>  However, class 3 weapons are insanely expensive.  I LEGAL uzi was running around $12000 last i checked.  Not to mention the price of ammunition and upkeep on a weapon like that.<br>  <br>  Legally, if you get caught with one in ANY state without the paperwork you are looking at a long time in federal jail.  And i mean a LOOOONG time.  <br>  <br>  As for an ak, as long as it is semi automatic, they are legal in *most* places.  Once again, probably not NYC or NJ though.  <br>  <br>  Last note for ya though.  DO NOT CONVERT ANY WEAPONS TO FULL AUTOMATIC otherwise you will spend even more time in jail.  Once you get out you would never be able to own a firearm again.|`|oYf3jSq6aa	Can't really add anything to the above post except to say the time to collect FAs is about 26 years past<br>  <br>  before the ban on new autos M16s were going for about $1000 now they are $20000 and everything else has gone up proportionately<br>  <br>  They are no longer good investments, just play toys for rich guys

lWNc9NRfaa	His shot selection is really not bad as long as you take him out of the decision some. He usually only takes the bad shots when he is on a break or trying to get something up early in the shot clock. The dude just needs to not handle the ball unless he is standing back in an open area and gets it on a pass. That is when he shoots better anyway.|`|aqLTBJ5waa	I'm a laker fan and I dislike the guy.  I don't hate him but I dislike him.  Can't play defense, can't dribble the ball because his handles are poor, can't make plays because his IQ is poor.  He's a good shooter but he either plays extroardinaly well once a week and sucks for the rest of the 3 games out of 4 during the week.    I wish we signed Ronny Turiaf instead of him during the offseason because Vujacic has been sucking trhis year and we didn't even miss his production when he was playing poorly.  Now Bynum is gone and we could've used another big man so we should've signed Turiaf instad of Vujacic    But yea I'm tired of him.  He needs to wake the eff up.|`|2VVgxFDKaa	this is true, but he does make them sometimes too.  You dont want him to lose confidence and start to second guess himself.|`|kFcdwVwdaa	totally, i like his aggressiveness but his shot selection is horrible. he doesn't wait for a rebounder to get in the paint and on fast breaks he tends to want to shoot the three before taking it in the lane.|`|GBGcI509aa	He plays like a four year old.|`|7t7XzXsVaa	no I don't pay attention to the lakers games much though|`|dtGInk4Faa	Well you are very right. He is starting to take really stupid shots. But you gotta remember hes a South America player. They aren't the best at penetrating and there taught mainly to shoot. He just isn't felling the rhythm right now. ANd you got that right about his pesky Defense. Well hopefully hell get better over time. I hope I helped.|`|qOWJQ7hRaa	Yes, I do. He has to improve a little bit. he has to step up too for Bynum's injury.|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	Disagree. Sure, the guy jacks up a few now and then that he shouldn't, but that's why he is out there and if he wasn't doing that well then Jackson wouldn't let him play. He's actually becoming a better defender and passer as well.|`|wuDplG1qaa	Thats what he's out there for.

XrCc85kNaa	Yeah...I guess..  He is always on the trading block anyway...so if the Lakers dont like him...  They will probably ship his azz out...|`|9rVQwJ59aa	LOL, Lamar needs to run the show. He should be point like Scottie Pippen.|`|FWKEw2jCaa	They need him because he still has all star talent and he is going to have to play more since Bynum is going 2 be injured for 2-3 months..|`|2VVgxFDKaa	he wont get traded during the season.  Especially now since Bynum might be out for the rest of the season.  The reason they wont trade him now is because it would take way too long for another player to come in and learn the triangle offense.  And LAmar already knows the offense so especially with Bynum out, it would not be good to trade Lamar for a player who would be getting a lot of minutes but wont know how to run the offense|`|1Mscji6Saa	the only reason he is on the team is because he is a great bench player. he might be replaced by ariza though|`|3teWTOPqaa	Lamar is inconsistent, but he isn't a bad player, he poses matchup problems for the other team which can free up Gasol or Kobe, I think with Bynum's injury Odom will stay for good, there will be no trade for him unless it's a really good one.    I think what Odom need is motivation, or maybe even arrogance. He needs to believe he can be the best player on a given night and stay in that mode the whole game.

CXI8Y3vvaa	Some dogs are more sensitive and this can make them more "likely" to become gun shy. Even the boldest of pups can become gun shy if the introduction to the gun is not handled correctly.Getting Started<br>  It's great if you breeder has already started the introduction but you never want to assume that they have.try different series of doors opening and closing and washing machines and dryers running. We also always have a radio going in the background. This gives them exposure to many noises, voices, music and loud and blaring commercials. My dad always said the best dogs were raised on "Country and Western" music, but I'll leave that up to you.<br>  <br>  try to make as much "noise" around young dog as possible. Start out slow and build up.when around your dog clap your hands, clang food bowls. Start out quiet and build up. Always watch your dog and see if or how she reacts. I prefer that the pup be moving around out in the open having fun. I want the noises to be part of there normal routine. I go out of my way to be as loud as I can over time.you might want her to be well adjusted to any sudden noise. The best way to do this is to have a regular series of noises going on. Again, start slow and build up. Never go too fast.try to have your dog to see guns on a regular basis as part of the routine. Feeding time is a great opportunity for this.<br>  This allows your pup to SEE a gun in a positive way and for it to become a normal part of her world.If you live in a neighborhood, you may want to let your neighbors know what you are doing....nothing worse than being the crazy guy next door walking around in his back yard with what "looks" like a shotgun. thats all i can say|`|hov037Giaa	my dad has hunted with dogs as long as i can remember( he still does). take her with you when you target practice and eventually she will get use to it again. don't take her out of the game cause she got spooked. every time you go practice or shooting clays or even turtle hunting with a 22 bring her with you. she will gradually come back to her senses. just don't shoot toward her. my dad has owned beagles, walkers,blue ticks,and black and tans since before iw as born and sometimes he would have like 30 or 40 dogs that i would help train and take care of. that was back when dogging deer was legal around here. he has gotten into coon hunting now and he joined a hunting club about an hour from home just to run deer. i have been hunting for 23 years and i love every minute of it!|`|3b8557f01cef58611c2e78e57d57b1e5aa	Yes she can.* Chances are she was gun shy before you bought her.* You could come back on whoever sold her to you for misrepresentation or damages for selling her to you in that condition.* They had to know the Dog was gun shy when they sold her to you.*|`|AA12182478	hi there, you might have, the muzzel blast must have been right in her face, if you can shoot where she is penned or tied try shooting your 22 while she is feeding, do this often if it dosen't seem to bother her while she eats, if it dose then she is gun shy, if it don't remember to carry a treat for her when she is hunting because she is going to associate gun fire with food ,.when you get a coon , give her a treat , good luck|`|a4b4YkhJaa	if she is just 10 months old u might be able to break her of this ,when u tree a coon keep her close by u on a chain and just shoot around her enough and you might break her,some dogs r just more timid then others and u just have 2 work with them more.|`|2zk434mFaa	I used to live right by a kennel that did trials with dogs and he always told us that if a dog is gun shy as a puppy there isnt no fixing it.

zFTSg47waa	For either a masse or draw shot, you need to put spin on the cue ball. Part of it is how far away from the center you hit. The other part is how fast your cue is moving when it hits the ball. The trick is you have to be able to do both controllably.    For a draw shot, you can aim anywhere from 1/2 tip to 1-1/2 tips below center. It depends how far you need the cue ball to travel before it hits the object ball and how far back you want it to travel. Keep you cue stick as level as possible; your cue should almost be rubbing on top of the rail. Keep your grip, wrist, and stroke loose. And when you shoot, follow through and stay down. At first, you might want to follow through to the point where it feels unnatural just to exaggerate the movement. Oh, and always remember to chalk up before shooting.    For a masse, it sounds like you want to start with a vertical masse, something that just goes straight out and comes straight back. It's probably easier to learn this way and then start adding left or right spin later. Remember to get the table owners permission as you can easily damage the cloth. You can hold the cue vertical or almost vertical. You can't really hit it gently though. Either stroke really hard and pretend you want to drive your cue stick through the table (this is where you can cause damage), or focus on jabbing the cue ball really quickly so your cue tip doesn't hit the cloth. You need to load the cue ball up with a lot of spin and not give it too much forward speed. And remember to chalk up.|`|svbFM4Zyaa	It is not just about where you hit the ball but often it is more about how you hit the ball. I used to masse very well and the real trick is popping down on the ball with just the right swift motion. It is also important to ensure that you hit the cue ball just right while you ae drawing it both backwards and forwards and side to side. You can watch many good instructional videos on you tube.|`|Kz8XUXxpaa	I almost didn't bother to answer because Trickshot gave a great answer, but maybe I can put a different emphasis on it.  Start by learning the draw shot. Don't even attempt a masse until you can reliably play a controlled draw.  The most important part in generating any spin (top, backspin, or english) is to hit through the ball. You do not stop your cue tip when it strikes the white. Play right through the white as if it isn't there. Your tip should travel six inches past the point of impact. For back-spin, try hitting 1/4 of the way up the ball - half way between the center and the cloth. Don't hit downwards - keep the cue level (as far as possible) and hit through. Have I mentioned hit THROUGH the cue ball?  Once you've got this figured out, your confidence will grow, and you will find a masse easy.|`|esLsR6keaa	Take the cue-ball and place it on the table.  Place your thumb on top of the cue-ball.  Try to spin the cue-ball one way or the other.  If you do this correctly remember the motion.  This is what you want the cue-ball to do.  Next picture using your cue like you did your thumb.  Now, try to spin the cue-ball.  Hitting the cue-ball from the top and downward across one side is the masse'.

VEoG1VCsaa	Each state has its own regulations for hunting pigeons.  They are generally considered pests and can be hunted without restrictions in many places.  There is not a big use of pigeon decoys here.  They are usually taken as bonus birds when hunting other gamebirds, especially doves.  I have never actually seen pigeon decoys for sale in any catalog or store I have been to.  Sounds like fun though.<br>  <br>  You may want to try getting a Mojo dove.  It is a motorized spinning wing decoy.  I have shot some pigeons over that, while dove hunting.  They run about $45US.  I am not sure what your regulations are, as far as using something like that.  The Mojo dove works very well.|`|CeRof6draa	Pigeons in the states are one of the three listed pest birds along with english sparrows and starlings. So basically, you can do anything you want to pigeons here. However, not sure of how many people actually "hunt" them.

dnXLue8maa	There's actually a good reason for this. I wondered why there appeared to be alot of black people who COULDNT swim one day and asked a scientist friend.<br>  <br>  It actually comes down to a physiological reason - bone density.

One is that these days, it's hard to become a highly competitive swimmer without being on a private club team at some point, and that's a fairly white suburban phenomenon.  It also seems that swimming is not culturally as popular in the black community as in some white communities.  Even though a lot of urban areas have public pools, the basketball hoops seem to be more popular by the time kids are in their teens.<br>  <br>  But I'd say that the biggest single factor is biological:  Among people I have known, a higher percentage of whites are "floaters" and a higher percentage of blacks are "sinkers".  If your body naturally sinks in water, you have to spend some of your effort just keeping at the surface of the water.|`|NMHmpBCzaa	Actually there's Maritza Correia who's an Olympic level swimmer (silver medalist) at the Athens games. the cool thing is that her brother Justin was actually my swim coach! she used to get in the water with me and swim when i was on the team several years ago. but there's no real reason, its just African American people tend to not really migrate towards swimming, more toward other sports. Its mostly a cultural type thing. but there's always exceptions, i know many great black swimmers who are faster than i ever was.|`|FZwhX62Xaa	The physiological theory seems to be only that - a theory.<br>  Maritza Corriea made the US women's Olympic team in 2004 and Cullen Jones was in the men's relay team this year. So that disproves that it is physically impossible.<br>  That just leaves the reason that it is sociological/cultural, a combination of background, facilities, opportunity, role models and financial rewards. One white male Olympian who commented suggested it was primarily a white middle-class sport.<br>  It is basically the same reason that there are no Olympic class skiers from Harlem or South Central L.A.|`|psmTrwT3aa	they just don't theres not a reason why it juust is like that but when one black person takes part in it im sure most black people will start to join its probably something black peopl aren't into.|`|tpiznWzTaa	I remember reading many years ago that it was something to do with a black person being unable to 'point their toes' as far forward as a white person. (Something with the Achilles Tendon?) Meaning, of course that in the prone swimming position, their feet do not go almost in line with their legs, and therefore do not have as much 'kick' as a white person.<br>    Obviously, this must be to their advantage in other sports such as running.<br>  <br>  *edit*<br>          Trish. You obviously are not from the UK, otherwise you would know that most ( if not all ) the UK swimmers that were so successful in the Olympic games this year, train in Municipal Swimming baths, and have to time their training schedules round the 'public opening' of the pool.|`|RYHJDWfraa	MaritzaCorreia<br>  Height:5'8"<br>  From:Valrico, Florida<br>  Trains:Davie, Florida<br>  U.S olympic swimming team.<br>  Black peoples bones being denser and they sink I saw as 1 reason on a forum, but others just say its down to access to facilities. who knows for sure.<br>  I say give it time and there will be more.|`|2TYOdyf4aa	Because they like to do othere stuff walk around the streets and do all that stuff all i can tell you as they do not like swimming but there favrout sport is running so can you balme them for liking running more then swiming |`|gNqVzt0iaa	theres sebastian in the little mermaid. lmao.<br>  <br>  seriously though, i guess maybe there just isnt any black people that want to do it proffesionally, football pays much more.|`|ZEsOcxcoaa	They have too much muscle bulk in their body frame to be olympic class swimmers,Different body mass to the white man.|`|Hu3UL07Vaa	Cullen Jones- USA olympic 4x100m freestyle relay team-gold medal.|`|6SGBygQDaa	lol<br>  random question |`|m662IWluaa	Not much people from Africa can swim where the majority of blacks are from!|`|gDCdZzBRaa	no nignogs|`|QHVpHThJaa	cause their tan will wash off

Allen got snubbed this year and he deserves to be in the All-Star game. My other choice would be Vince Carter.    As for his replacement in the Skills challenge, maybe Rondo should go for it. I was going to say Harris, but he's already in it.|`|lWNc9NRfaa	He will miss both and his replacement could be Mo Williams.

8zgFyfibaa	Ok here's my opinion.      1.he should at least play for the hexagon.as much as I hate that he has experience.    2.after mexico qualifies to the world cup. Then he should retire. From the selecion,not the mexican league.    3.since the world cup is in the summer time,ochoa should play as much friendlies as he can to be ready for the world cup.    But the thing that grinds my gear(I got that from family guy lol) is that os waldo is greedy.     Ever since the copa america I lost respect for him. Because when mexico was going to play ecuador. The golie was going to be ochoa but oswaldo went to sanchez and begged to be the golie. I thin that's unprofessional. He doesn't want to accept the fact that his time as golie of mexico is over and ochoa is the next golie for mexico     .|`|GtumZsVUaa	i think this cow is el mero mero sabor ranchero.|`|FbmMnIg5aa	Memo Ochoa is a GREAT goalie but i think hes not ready to play for la selection again|`|DcVknH1Faa	oswaldo shouldnt retire yet but maybe after the world cup he will retire honestly we need him still.ochoa is not ready yet and michel is mostlikely to take over the start position from oswaldo and ochoa if he continues doing good.|`|6adKrscNaa	LEAVE ASSWALDO ALONE!!!!!

Brady gets the ladies so that won't happen. That was really detailed and creepy that you put that there.    Vick might get back into the NFL but he wasn't that good too begin with.     The Dolphins have a chance but its small and the Lions could make the playoffs the next year with how the NFL works.    However, you did not state what Hall of Fame Vick would be enshrined in. So I predict the Vick being enshrined in the Hall of Fame first. What one it will be is a good question? Maybe the Millionaire's Who Got Caught and Went to Prison Hall of Fame.|`|ihaCEikwaa	2 just made me laugh TOO hard--i thank you for that!!

And John Madden will end his love affair with Favre, and start courting Big Ben.
IdNRyzXlaa	Same happened to me. Everyone on my team either never passed it or ran slow or never made  goal- or couldnt keep the ball from getting in the goal. So i quit. But that is a horible way to go. Once i did that everyone called me a quitter and loser. Even my brother was mad b/c soccer is his life. SO, my advice is to not worry about the others. Worry about urself. Show ur coach that ur better. Maybe even get ur group together and get the coach and say, "Hey, we all need a lil help on playing our games." And mention to everyone to practice their weakness. Maybe even say ur not the best either. So, it looks like ur not all about THEM and not YOU. So, this is all i got. BUT PLZ DONT QUIT!!!|`|1XEUETPKaa	well first of all, do you play on a recreational league team or a competitive traveling/club team?     If a rec league team, go tryout for a club team. It gives you a much better experience playing with stronger players, and players that want to win also.     If a club team, switch clubs. Find out what clubs are in your area and goto one of their tryouts.|`|gZrEM8xjaa	move team innit.  I was the same, I was in a team that was bottom of a crap league, still managed to score hat trick or so every game, and eventually got spotted by Aston Villa, so just keep going.|`|AA11565869	Go to a bookie and see what the odds are on your team losing:-)|`|F2ygsPEbaa	I think it depends on how old you are how much longer you expect to play soccer.  If you have a lot of years of soccer left, suck it up and deal with it and be a mature good teammate for the rest of this season.  Perhaps next season you can move to another team or maybe even a higher caliber league.    Help your teammates.  Show them techniques.  Be a leader.  This could be an important test of character for you.  But if you quit, these people are going to resent you for doing so.  Don't be a quitter.  Be a leader.|`|H7xl7fEiaa	Quit and join a better team if ur as good as u say :)  if not then try and become captain of ur team then people will listen 2 u  if not again then try and get some mates who are gd at football to join your team.

Alternatively just carry on playing for the love of the game.|`|i5L49GFOaa	I had the same problem. If you just play to the best of your abilities you will get recruited. Thats what happened to me. You never know who comes to your game. So just be tough.

AA11101968	Do you wrap your hands properly before you hit the bag?  Go to ringside.com and get yourself some hand wraps and ankle supports.  If it still hurts, take as many days off as you need to, but 1 or 2 should be plenty.    Google dit da jow, I find it helps a lot after muay thai training.
RC3WoqFkaa	some places might not have enough ppl playing so the team is walk on or if u do tryout and stuff not enough good ppl tryout. some ppl don't play even if they're on the team is cuz they're the back up in case someone gets injured. something like that.|`|6fl7RrJMaa	Some people are natural athletes or theyre just naturally good at something.|`|ldwaVRy4aa	Because everyone else trying out is worse than they are|`|iyDXt5d9aa	Sometimes if you're just athletic ya can catch on, and turn into an amazin player with some work and coaches see that.

I didnt think he was that fast but i guess i was wrong. Another play was the jump ball when Fitzgerald caught it on his helmet like last years SB. As a Giants fan, that play caught my eyes and i remembered last years amazing SB team. James Harrison punching and pushing one of the Cardinals was hilarious! It was uncalled for but it was still funny and i definitely lost all respect i had for that man.|`|9vLzGwVqaa	The fitzgerald helmet catch!|`|mTSOJKlyaa	harrison's flagrant roid rage|`|58TDAT1zaa	Great plays on both teams instead of a lamefest, lopsided victory.|`|bjR2uWAWaa	watching the wheels fall of the Cards band wagon!|`|J3kfQtViaa	I will always remember roethlesberger trash talking after he won the game, displaying a complete lack of class and relegating himself into the position of never being a great.|`|d065d40a6781127c80dc5959554a2d4faa	There not being a review and it being called a "Fumble."

All I can say is Defense wins Championships.|`|8c5dfb8ff876deaaa25ab74d326f84a7aa	The unnecessary roughness call on the field goal.

Ot1R3t5uaa	he might be big and strong,but that does not mean he is fit.use your fitness against him. jab and move before he can counter punch. keep doing it until he is exhausted after chasing you around the ring. wear him down.|`|OeD2sJt7aa	His size is your advantage.  Stick that jab out to keep him away from you, then slip under his jab and go to work on body shots.  Then get OUT of his range again and start jabbing again.  However, I question the decision of your coach to let you spar someone so much bigger than you while you are coming off of an injury.  He really needs to let you get your stamina back and be cleared by a doctor before you get in the ring.  I suggest you ask your coach for some time before you fight this guy.  Best of luck!|`|Vh48WbW8aa	ok is his eyes made of iron ?    hit him in the eyes trust me     it will work|`|Ld1vLH8Kaa	Go for head shots. His size won't help him if you break him down with constant jabs.|`|AFkjkqcSaa	I completely agree with Gary K.  I have sparred against men huge compared to me, I had to spar against a bouncer once who was a monster with huge rippling muscle.  I crapped it but do u kno when  was sparring with him he was so slow and unfit!! I had that advantage over him as I do a lot of running etc and he doesnt.  He was also a thai boxer and did not keep his ribs covered so I kept ducking and going round the back of him to give him liver shots.  If u keep ducking when he swings, use your body to twist and rememba to keep on yor toes.  Do not go backwards when he goes for you, or he'll end up backing you in to a corner!!! u ll be fine if a small lass like me can do it so can u  ;-)|`|LJQF0ZMoaa	look for counter punches and work on your defensive game. also grapple when he comes in for inside body shots. if his arms are as big as you say they are then they may be quite slow, so read him out. good luck :)
b2qdwABVaa	Hit the weight room.<br>  This is where you work on the explosive first step, vertical leap, and stronger core, by doing squats at the gym. Yes, squats. Do them properly and it'll be the best exercise you ever did.  Start at 75 lbs, and work your way up to your weight.  Squats will strengthen the quads, hamstrings, lower back, and just give you the necessary lower body strength that your legs will need to be able to dunk.  <br>  <br>  Be sure to do the squats properly though: <br>  1) rest bar on trapezoidal muscles while holding onto the bar with both hands<br>  2) in a slow and controlled manner, keeping your back straight, bring your chest towards your knees to lower the bar<br>  3) make sure your butt is parallel with the floor or a bit lower when you perform a squat<br>  4) in a slow and controlled manner, bring the bar back up.<br>  5) do about 8-10 reps a set, 5 sets a workout|`|fAMpj8s2aa	you're white, you can't. go eat some mayonnaise.|`|jDi063pQaa	I have found what I think is the best free resource for jump training information.

KSIY3EVVaa	my favorite gun is definitely the M4 Carbine. its got a good fire rate, so it acts like a machine gun. it has very low recoil 2 make it easier 2 get a kill. like all the other assault rifles, it is effective from almost any range, making it comparable 2 a sniper.|`|AA10056762	lol CoD4 is not an outdoor activity.

1Mscji6Saa	its not only PG's in it, they just usually win. kobe was in it, but he struggled on the passing part. point guards have a huge advantage, especially in the passing part. alot of SG's have been in it, but i dont think that ive seen any SF's|`|FWKEw2jCaa	yea what they said..|`|khbLZQHIaa	Did you notice that past winners include both Dwyane Wade and Kobe Bryant?

Edit:  Nevermind about Kobe, he hasn't won.|`|LsIMKcHcaa	There's a point at which a taller person would just look stupid.|`|jDi45m0uaa	Guards because they have to be fast.
