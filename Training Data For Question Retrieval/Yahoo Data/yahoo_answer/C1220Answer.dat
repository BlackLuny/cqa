1168bcccfff6f3a578ef3a0223e4cce5aa	I think you're talking about the 'foxbat' or mig 25.   I've got a wikipedia link, I don't normally like using wikipedia as you can never be sure if the information is corect but this seems to be accurate. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikoyan-Gur...    EDIT - I'm presumig you mean ascent as in climbing skywards following a normal runway take off - it's just the answerers on here seem to think you mean vertical take off and landing. If that's what you mean then they are, of course, right in saying it's the Harrier jump jet.|`|18f4aeb76a3e8aee506482a962921d26aa	It's the Harrier Jump Jet. They can also hover on descent.   The Lightning  (may it rest in peace) the F-18A and the MIG you refer to, could/can attain great altitude after take off, but they all needed a long runway, so I don't think these planes can be described as being 'vertical take-off' planes.  The Lightning had the reputation of having the ability to descend rapidly, although not vertically and thankfully mostly over uninhabited areas.|`|zN1TyLMPaa	any plane can do that but only a short period of time......and fighter planes can do that for a longer period of time.......black bird sr-72 is the world s fastest fighter plane|`|3b0083d3c1ba4bf8a6df4abdf7bc532caa	Yes - the English Electric Lightning could do that.  This was in the 1950's.  The aircraft was designed to intercept Russian aircraft probing British airspace so it needed to be able to reach its service ceiling in the shortest possible time.  There was even an occasion when a variant of that aircraft beat an F-15 to 30,000 ft.|`|vSkqJ813aa	Virtually all aircraft with reasonable forward thrust, and not just jets, are capable of brief vertical flight. Aircraft performing the aerobatic manoeuvre of 'looping the loop' fly an outward or inward facing 'great' circle and so climb vertically for a brief period!      High powered fighter jets can climb vertically for extended periods either under normal power or 'reheated'  afterburner power. With older RAF jets performing a vertical climb, at an air show, one often saw the 'dancing diamond's'  of the reheated  or afterburner thrust. Because the pilots are experiencing a 'rocket like' lift into the sky, they experience very high 'g' forces that 'punch' them back into their seats! The RAF's Typhoon F2 fighter provides the pilot  with a g-suit that reduces 'g' forces for up to 9-g of accelerated flight!  Much older fighters did not provide the pilot with much 'g' protection and so very high 'g' turns and climbs could result a 'black out' due to g-restricted blood flow to the head.    During the Korean War (1950 - 1953), Soviet pilots flew the Mig 15 against the American F-86 Sabre fighter. The Soviet plane could out climb the American one, at 50 m/s  compared with 41 m/s, and had a greater maximum altitude of about 5000 ft above the American aircraft! The Mig 15 had a better thrust/weight ratio  (0.54) than its American counter part (0.38).      The latest Mig 35 (2005) has similar performance characteristics to the Euro fighter (RAF Typhoon F2) with a thrust to weight ratio of 1.1 compared to the Euro fighter's value 1.16. The new Mig can climb at 330 m/s and the Euro fighter at >315 m/s. Thus, all modern fighters can achieve a high rate of sustained vertical climb!    P.S.  I actually saw an RAF Lightning perform a vertical climb, on afterburner, at RNAS Culdrose in Cornwall during the late nineteen sixties - it was absolutely deafening!!!|`|ad08fe27604f983a2b098f5c3a9bdfa5aa	I have seen an F/A-18 doing it.|`|LiOOF1Plaa	The F-15 Strike Eagle can easily do a straight vertical ascent- to it's service ceiling of 55,000 feet....full afterburners!!!|`|pInY6rYqaa	Yes, jets can fly vertically for a short time.|`|xFTAeLtcaa	harrier jump jet

KfBWOvf3aa	surface area plays the role implictly in the left part of the formula, which is F. so, greater surface area means bigger F. so, wider tires means more efficiency AND more force.    many people haven't understand subtle concept in Newton's 2nd law yet. for example, the formula F = m.a is not yet finished. to use it in practical situation, you must supply the formula for F:    in gravity, it is F = GMm/r^2  in electrostatic, it is F = kQq/r^2  in friction, it is F = miu. Normal force (where miu is friction coefficient)    and so on and so forth. your question implies that the formula ends there, without further explanation in F. actually, that's not true. the F itself can change if the surface area change. in the above formula, friction = miu.

FBwK9s7Baa	-T-here are many different ways to create a motion sensor. For example:     It is common for stores to have a beam of light crossing the room near the door, and a photosensor on the other side of the -room. When a customer breaks the beam, the photosensor detects the change in the amount of light and rings a bell.   Many grocery stores have automatic door openers that use a very simple form of radar to detect when someone passes near the door. The box above the door sends out a burst of microwave radio energy and waits for the reflected energy to bounce back. When a person moves into the field of microwave energy, it changes the amount of reflected energy or the time it takes for the reflection to arrive, and the box opens the door. Since these devices use radar, they often set off radar detectors.   The same thing can be done with ultrasonic sound waves, bouncing them off a target and waiting for the echo.   All of these are active sensors. They inject energy (light, microwaves or sound) into the environment in order to detect a change of some sort.     The "motion sensing" feature on most lights (and security systems) is a passive system that detects infrared energy. These sensors are therefore known as PIR (passive infrared) detectors or pyroelectric sensors. In order to make a sensor that can detect a human being, you need to make the sensor sensitive to the temperature of a human body. Humans, having a skin temperature of about 93 degrees F, radiate infrared energy with a wavelength between 9 and 10 micrometers. Therefore, the sensors are typically sensitive in the range of 8 to 12 micrometers.     The devices themselves are simple electronic components not unlike a photosensor. The infrared light bumps electrons off a substrate, and these electrons can be detected and amplified into a signal.     You have probably noticed that your light is sensitive to motion, but not to a person who is standing still. That's because the electronics package attached to the sensor is looking for a fairly rapid change in the amount of infrared energy it is seeing. When a person walks by, the amount of infrared energy in the field of view changes rapidly and is easily detected. You do not want the sensor detecting slower changes, like the sidewalk cooling off at night.     Your motion sensing light has a wide field of view because of the lens covering the sensor. Infrared energy is a form of light, so you can focus and bend it with plastic lenses. But it's not like there is a 2-D array of sensors in there. There is a single (or sometimes two) sensors inside looking for changes in infrared energy.

ACTIVITY    To spark children's interest, read some books and hold a discussion about shadows. What is a shadow? How is it made? Where do shadows come from? When children finish contributing their ideas and thoughts, provide a few concrete examples of what makes a shadow. Be sure children understand that a shadow occurs when something is blocking the light.    On a bright and sunny day, take your class outside to measure shadows. What do they think their shadows will look like? Will they be big or small, tall or thin? Explain to children that they are going to become shadow experts by measuring their shadows at three different times during the day. Invite children to predict what will happen with the shadows.    Model how to stand with your back to the sun. Invite a student to place a craft stick on the ground at the top of your shadow and another where you are standing. Then model how to measure your shadow with a ruler. Invite pairs of children to line up and measure each other's shadows.    Go outside and record measurements several times during the day. How many rulers long is your shadow now? Did the shadow grow taller or shorter? Why do shadows change?    Hold a discussion with children at the end of the day. When were their shadows the longest? Why were the shadows long and thin in the morning? When were they the shortest? Why?    Remember: Model using a ruler and let children practice before they begin the activity. If this standard measurement tool is too advanced for your children, use a nonstandard unit of measure such as their feet or long unit blocks which they can lay down in the shadow and then count.         Curriculum Connection: SCIENCE    Shadows are everywhere and come in all shapes and sizes. They can be plain and simple or very complex. Head out on a shadow hunt around the neighborhood. Look at all the beautiful shadows made from things children see every day. Challenge them to look for the tallest, skinniest, fattest, or biggest shadow they can find.

TL1Jkqunaa	Heat tends to flow from where it is to where it is not.  It does not naturally continue to accumulate in one spot.    It moves by conduction, by being in contact with something cooler.  A simple example is heating one end of a piece of metal, say a spoon in a soup bowl.  The heat will travel to the end not in the soup bowl.    Convection in fluids, liquids and gases.  Heat one spot and the fluid will expand.  The mass  (equal to weight  in this case) remains unchanged but it now takes up a larger volume, so its density is less.  Being in a fluid, it will float upwards until it reaches the top of the fluid and then move sideways in all directions.   If it cools off enough it will sink.  (WHile this is happening it is also spreading heat by conduction.)    Radiation is the conversion of heat into electromagnetic radiation that travels outward from its source as invisible (to us) infrared waves.  These waves are just beyond the ability of humans to see, but we can feel them as heat.  Stand next to a glass window on a cold sunny day.  You can feel the heat of the sunlight but if you touch the glass you will notice it is cold.    It is very difficult to completely separate the 3 methods, all tend to work at the same time.|`|FBwK9s7Baa	Heat transfer is the transition of thermal energy from a heated item to a cooler item. When an object or fluid is at a different temperature than its surroundings or another object, transfer of thermal energy, also known as heat transfer, or heat exchange, occurs in such a way that the body and the surroundings reach thermal equilibrium. Heat transfer always occurs from a hot particle to a cold one, a result of the second law of thermodynamics. Where there is a temperature difference between objects in proximity, heat transfer between them can never be stopped; it can only be slowed down. Thermal energy is conducted well by metals such as copper, platinum, gold, iron, etc.|`|b5ySK6SGaa	In terms of engineering heat transfers because its thermal energy it is kinetic and therefore is motion of waves. The waves can transfer heat to surrounding objects depended on dispersion of the energy. Usually directed thermal energy such as a blue flame transfers heat very quickly as the kinetic thermal energy has plenty of dispersion.    The hot and excited atoms gives off heat and as they move release there energy thereby transferring it to the surrounding atoms.|`|AA10008098	When you heat matter (one end of an iron bar?) the atoms and molecules of the bar absorb the heat by vibrating within their crystal lattice.  The vibrations are shared with adjacent atoms and molecules on down the line which transfers the thermal energy along the bar.  Heat flows from hot to cool because the hot atoms and molecules have the excess thermal energy (vibrations) to share with cooler (more stationary) atoms and molecules.  That is a little like water flowing from wet to dry and not the other way around.
c8a0fc27d021da822a52ee6103add094aa	It seems to me that there has to be an energy balance. The nuclear binding energy of your pion doesn't just go away. (Pardon me - I don't remember what the physical makeup of a pion is. So I don't recall what it decays to.) Nevertheless, the binding energy of the new particles remains with the new particles, while the left over is converted to your two photons with energy in the gamma range of the light spectrum. Seems to me that the angle that the photons leave at would be about 11.5 degrees. The reason being - the velocity of the photon in the direction normal (I'll call it Y) to the original direction of motion (I'll call it X) should be large enough to make the speed of the new photon c.  As for the energy of the photons, it must be:  (original binding energy) - (final binding energy)  I don't believe there is a net energy cost associated with projecting the photons in opposite directions because the y-components of their velocities should cancel.  I may be reaching... it's been a while.

AA10008098	Shivering is the body's method of using muscle movement to generate heat.  My cousin who wore light jackets in winter said he just kept his muscles relaxed and did not feel the cold.  There is also a big difference between a cold trunk and cold limbs (arms and legs).  Warm blood traveling through arteries down an arm or a leg is returned either by veins near the skin to lose excess heat or through veins deep inside the limb to conserve heat when it is cold.  This preserves heat for the trunk where all the vital organs reside.  Hunters often wear sleeveless jackets in the cold but layers of clothes to keep their trunks warm (core temperature).  Some also have a generous layer of fat to help insulate their bodies.  A fisherman was thrown into frigid waters off the coast of Iceland when the boat went down.  All his shipmates perished but he swam ashore and struggled to a village because his fat protected him.  Perhaps you are lucky but it is a good idea to avoid hypothermia in cold weather because it can distort judgment and if core temperature drops too much the body's thermal regulator shuts down and sleep and death may follow.|`|77412bb9d7b8758e0a32f247da6eaed4aa	When that happens to me, I usually find I am pregnant.

Lfn2LOTzaa	You can still believe in god and believe in the big bang and every other aspect of science. God operates outside of time. He is not of temporal limitations. Take the big bang. "God created the heavens and the earth" from genesis. It does not explain how God would have done this though. There is no problem with trying to figure these things out. One does not cancel the other out. Science never can or will answer all the questions that life asks.    Edit-  Albert Einstein also said-     "Everyone who is seriously involved in the pursuit of science becomes convinced that a spirit is manifest in the laws of the Universe - a spirit vastly superior to that of man...In this way the pursuit of science leads to a religious feeling of a special sort, which is indeed quite different from the religiosity of someone more naive."  I have always loved this quote. If someone as brilliant as Einstein can embrace such a concept, why do others find it so hard? I started studying physics to understand the nature of the universe and the creation of it. In a way I did it to disprove the need for a god. I was, at the time, contemptuously anti-religious. But I found that the more I read and studied, the more the idea of god was HARDER to dismiss.    "Everyone who is seriously involved in the pursuit of science becomes convinced that a spirit is manifest in the laws of the Universe".....Indeed.    Ps- I watched that movie. I have seen others like it but still, it was very enjoyable. (Though, there are certain things I could dispute, I agree with the fundamental points made)|`|xqOWI8VUaa	So?

The earth is so beautiful, and the human brain is amazing! It all evolved, ultimately, from nothing, without a creator."  It violates good sense, which is: "Nothing comes from nothing", as sung by Nun Maria von Trapp.  Atheists don't believe in God because they can't measure him with the Scientific Method.|`|92f97d29e3d55f3219cc25dfabd347c7aa	Once again (I'm answering your first question second), you are just misunderstanding science and the scientific method.  Science attempts to explain the things we observe in the universe by building simple models.  It does not attempt to discern any deeper truth underlying the models (except perhaps more detailed models).    So the actual underlying "truth" could be God or gravity fairies or the flying spaghetti monster.  We'll never know.    "And as for religion, if this (invisible) force of existence exists, why not calling it God and try to give it meaning spiritually with a religion."  --As a matter of fact, that was nearly exactly Einstein's point of view.  He was, in his own words, a "religious atheist".  Despite not believing in a personal god, he was a pantheist and fond of making clever quotes about his idea of God.    "If you think about it well, you will understand that there is more to life then we can possibly see."  --That's certainly true.
KtD80yv6aa	Einstein did not believe in a personal god, and certainly did not modify his theory just to satisfy the pathetic, naive and primitive myths which many continue to grasp desperately to today.    Einstein only added the constant because his theory predicted the big bang, which at the time was unknown to be true. They believed that the universe was static.    When it was later shown (by Hubble) that the universe is indeed expanding, Einstein realised that his introduction of the constant was unjustified.    However, as we now know that the universe is accelerating, it would seem that the cosmological constant might actually be non-zero after all (but not the value that Einstein had given it).|`|92f97d29e3d55f3219cc25dfabd347c7aa	The big bang does not create a day without a yesterday necessarily.  We don't know whether there really was a beginning of the universe or something that came before.    The theory requires a constant of some sort.  Niether Einstein nor we have any good theoretical reason to guess what is should be.  Evidence seemed to indicate at first that the constant was one, so Einstein jumped to the conclusion that it was one.    I'm not sure GR has too many implications for much of anything.  I can probably count its applications on one hand--gravitational lensing, cosmology in general, gravitational redshift of extremely massive bodies (black holes being a most extreme example), a tiny correction to GPS.  Certainly not as fecund as quantum mechanics which has changed life as we know it.    ---As for the religious thing, you seem to completely misunderstand not only the big bang theory but science in general.  Science doesn't try to address questions that can't be answered by observation.    Observation (and some simple deductions from those observations) tells us that the universe was once very much smaller and very much hotter than it is today.  That is all the big bang theory says.  It does not attempt to address the question of what (if anything) came before.  It does not attempt to ask why.  Science in general shies away from why questions.  Our goal is to build models that successfully match our observations, not to satisfy your spiritual curiosity.    --I'm curious in what field that guy in the video got his PhD.  He makes enough very simple mistakes that we know it's not physics.  As a rule, anyone who tacks letters on his/her name in an attempt to establish credibility to their arguements should be viewed as highly suspect.  You don't see Stephen Hawking or Bryan Greene or Carl Sagan or any legitimate physicist needing to show credentials.|`|RrEESD6Paa	Hmmm, not sure.

That's all there is to it. The Mayans themselves never predicted the end of the world would happen at that time.  All the doomsday predictions attached to this date are, without exception, unscientific nonsense, perpetrated by frauds and hoaxers.    No Mike F, the Mayan calendar isn't the most accurate in the world. It merely counts off days in groups of 18 or 20. Where does accuracy come into it? 3 well known prophets? How often are these sort of people correct? And no modern astronomers say anything is going to happen.

GzVBv1mNaa	1.  You can see Jupiter's satellites with seven power binoculars.  50 mm objectives are a good size.  The orange color isn't apparent unless you take a photo.  With a stronger set of binoculars you could distinguish the cloud belts, but they are brown appearing.    2.  Basically you need at least 25X to see the rings.  You'll probably need a little more now since the rings are not tilted very much, but will improve slightly over the next couple months.    3.  This one depends on the size of the objective.  With binoculars you won't see details on Mars, unless you have binocular telescopes.|`|W2suykEtaa	1) 10x, but Jupiter is more a creamy color, than orange.    2) 50x, but its impossible to hold binoculars at this power without a tripod    3) 300x, they actually make them this strong, they are huge and godly expensive.    buy an 8" dob.|`|f1beDbKIaa	1. Jupiter is a disk at 8x.  I routinely see Jupiter's moons in 8x21 binoculars.  But they're big as life in 7x35's. On my list of things to see naked eye is Ganymede. The issue isn't if it's bright enough.  The issue is that it's next to bright Jupiter.  The claim is that if you know which side it's on, and it's at maximum elongation, you can block Jupiter with a tree or building and see it.    2.  When the rings were completely tipped over, and the weather cooperated, and i had a really good tripod, i was able to see Saturn's rings separate from the body of the planet in 8x42 binoculars.  Most people say you need 15x to see them.    3. At a close opposition, as we had in 2003, you can start to see surface detail in a 6" (150 mm) telescope at 100x.  Maybe even a 4.5" (114 mm) scope would have done it.  I didn't have one handy in 2003.  Our current oppositions are not in late August where it's closest.  The next one is January 2010, where it's not as close.  So an 8" scope is likely needed.|`|4FFJNNjnaa	tick tock is correct.  Most department store binocs, say roughly the 10x50 type made for bird watching will show jup's color and the 4 gal. moons, and will show saturn's rings (altho right now I think the rings are 'on edge' to us and even a larger telescope would have a tough time showing them).  Ahh, but for detail on Mars...that's a tough order for even a 10" refractor.  For planets (and this is a very broad , sweeping generalization) you need a refractor, an apochromatic triplet being considered the best design there.

k6cXOxvtaa	Well, there have been several studies on teen pregnancy.  Here, I will explain about caused teen pregnancy (aka a girl getting pregnant on purpose).  Most believe that (emotionally) the girl needs love. She feels lost, hopeless, and lonely. And (while she goes through her lonely teen life) her hormones kick in. She begins to mature (physically) and she develops a "mothers instinct."   Its ironic really. Right when the girl is at her lowest, her instincts kick in (because of her hormones). Most girls feel that a baby will give them unconditional love. They want to feel the baby kick, they want to give birth. They want to hold their OWN child (rather than a little cousin or sibling). And since teen pregnancy is such a controversial issue (and the girl knows this) she wants to get pregnant even MORE. Reason? She is lonely and sad. She wants to be controversial. She wants her families attention. She wants her friends attention. She actually WANTS people to look!     Hormones...ahh! We go from kissing to sex in an average of 3 years (first kiss at 11, have sex when your 14). Those are some horrible numbers, but they are true in many parts of the world. Including right here in Canada, and all over the USA.      Well, good luck. I hope you got the answer you were looking for :)

X0e6p9Ilaa	To answer your question directly:  slim to none.  There is no naturally occurring elemental barium metal in the Earth's crust.  Barium is always found in conjuction with other elements (O or S, usually).    That's not to say that we can't make barium metal.  Humphrey Davey was the first to isolate it, but it will quickly oxidize, and should be kept under oil to keep it from reacting.    Barium is an alkaline earth metal, and while not as reactive as the alkali metals, the two valence electrons in the 6s sublevel are loosely bound to the atom and are easily lost or shared, making barium quite reactive.|`|GGMKhDf5aa	Any element within the alkali or alkaline earth metals is highly reactive. If you put calcium in water, you can see the reaction in real time. It's really fun when you put a piece of alkali or alkaline earth metal in a strong acid, like HCl. But anyways, elements like Barium want to lose their two outer electrons quite quickly, which is why they tend to not be found in pure form. Think if it this way; barium's just so close to obtaining an octet, that it wants to react always, just like cesium, potassium, oxygen, fluorine, and all the other elements that are really close to noble gases.

DRVSCxKpaa	A frequently asked question!  If it were possible to dig a hole through the earth; and then jump in (ignoring the effect of air friction), you would pass right through the earth, and emerge at the other side.  At the centre, there would be no gravitational attraction, because the gravity from all sides would cancel out.  But you would have developed a very high velocity at that ppoint. The velocity would be sufficient to carry you right through to the other side, at which point, the acceleration you made in falling through the hole would be matched by the earth's pull of gravity, and you would come to a halt; only to fall back through again.  In effect, without air resistance; you would form a perfect oscillating pendulum, falling from side to side like a yo-yo.  Of course, air friction would slow you down, until you came to rest at the earth's centre: a rather hot and unpleasant place to be.    Hypothetically, if it were possible to bore a hole through the earth (entirely impractical) and build an evacuated tube; the whole journey from side to side would only take about 90 minutes - cheap and quick transport, eh?  In fact the tube would not have to go through the centre; but a journey through a tangential tunnel from, say Los Angeles to London would also take only 90 minutes.|`|uekDJ3gqaa	you would get stuck in the middle because gravity pulls towards the core of the earth in all directions.|`|bYnEri0oaa	u would get stuck in the middle becuase of gravity    (and then probably burn and die)( ;() )|`|7VwCvCW5aa	@Roland that is Hilarious..    that is a Good question m8!

Same thing.|`|poDJw7rHaa	Falling will increase your speed while you're travelling towards Earth's centre of gravity, which is more or less the geometric centre. So you will pass through the centre, which will pull you back once you've passed it. You will pass it again at some speed and again be pulled in the opposite direction. So you will in effect become a pendulum through the centre. Because of air resistance, your speed will decrease each turn, until you come to a stop at the centre.|`|va8quhPtaa	No question of coming out.|`|ZWzf4mv7aa	Carbon has the highest melting point at 3,652 degrees Celsius, the temperature at the edge of the core is 4,000 degrees Celsius. Therefore even if you were to make a drill out of carbon you wouldn't be able to get through the mantle before the drill melted, so therefore drilling through the earth is impossible. So if you tried to jump in when the drill stopped you would end up falling at enormous speeds then having your body crushed when you hit the mantle
kLXgrjISaa	Dont worry, your understanding that you have this downfall will make you persist in achieving it some day.    I had the same problem, where i did very well with the theoretical subjects.  But theres two things you have to understand.  You have to know the difference between theory and reality, you will often deviate from the norm, but you want to be as close as you can.  2nd, much of the theory you learn wont be used on a daily basis.  Its used for explanation of the bigger picture.    For example, you may understand the concepts of transistors.  Then throw a couple billion of them into a chip, you just need to know that the theory has already been applied.  You just need to know what functions the chip has.  Dont try to figure out the exact function the billions of transistors it would take forever to do.    To help with your labs, just ask questions, and be sure to read very carefully.  Sometimes, with labs, you gotta be creative.  You are trying to reach the objective of your goal.  Look at the goal first, then backtrack to find out how you will go about achieving it.  A lot of problems can be, following the directions, and having no idea how you came to your conclusion.   Always know where you're going.    I know its a lot, but im trying to compare my experiences as of how I overcame these same problems with my studies at school.

4YZtwzb6aa	Process of elimination.    (2x + 3y = 10) >>multiply this by 2, you get 4x + 6y = 20.    Then add the resulting equation to the other one.         4x + 6y = 20   +   x  -  6y = -10    Here, 6y and -6y will cancel out, leaving you with 5x = 10.  Therefore, x = 2.    Plug this x value into any of the two given equations:    Using x - 6y = -10, and x = 2,    2 - 6y = -10    -6y = -12, y = 2    The point of interception is (2,2).

GGMKhDf5aa	It's radioactive, and its half life is fairly short, so it decays into other elements very quickly. If anything, I'd say that it was sheer luck it was discovered. It's only been found in hint traces in some uranium minerals.|`|4YZtwzb6aa	Francium is a product of uranium decay. It is quite unstable, its most stable isotope lasts for less than half an hour.    There are two reasons why Francium was late to be discovered:    1. During those time, radioactivity was not yet fully studied. As such, the presence of radioactive elements (and by-products, for that matter) were not yet noticed until 1896, when Henri Becquerel discovered radioactivity.    2. Although radioactive elements were discovered sooner, the short half-life of francium was the cause why it was hard to observe the element in nature (in fact, it took more than forty years later before francium was observed--and it was discovered in a decay series, not in nature).
92f97d29e3d55f3219cc25dfabd347c7aa	The energy levels of a bound system (like a hydrogen atom) are quantized.  So a photon that is released can't have just any energy.  It has a spectrum with discrete lines.    Also, the electromagnetic force's (and other force's) field is also quantized.  So light only comes in bite-size chunks.

The photon is the quantum of light.|`|KtD80yv6aa	Quanta refers to something which is quantized (meaning it comes in discrete packets, rather than a continuous stream).

It is called quantum physics because normal physics laws don't apply on an atomic scale, so new rules have to be made. This is basically where quantum physics and quantum mechanics came from.    There are five main points that quantum physics deals with. These are:    1. Energy is not continuous, but comes in small but discrete units.    2. The elementary particles behave both like particles and like waves.    3. The movement of these particles is inherently random.    4.It is physically impossible to know both the position and the momentum of a particle at the same time. The more precisely one is known, the less precise the measurement of the other is.    5. The atomic world is nothing like the world we live in.

Theory is terrible. When numbers were made, they were meant to be "numbers," which borders along the line of abstraction.

If all else fails, tell him that the two negative signs go together to make a positive sign. "-" and "I" come together to make a "+"
X0e6p9Ilaa	This is kind of a non-question.  There is no answer, per se, because, while it is possible to separate the cations from one another, it is impossible to keep their anions with them, especially if you use water.  And by the way, ammonium chloride does not sublime in the usual sense.  It doesn't go from solid ammonium chloride to gaseous ammonium chloride.  It actually decomposes to form ammonia gas (NH3) and hydrogen chloride gas (HCl).    You could separate Mg2+ from Cu2+ in aqueous solution by adding aqueous ammonia, which is basic.  Both will precipitate as the hydroxide initially, but the copper (II) hydroxide will dissolve in excess ammonia, and form [Cu(NH3)4]2+.  Then you can centrifuge the mixture and pour off the aqueous part which will contain only copper.    ========= Follow up =========    And by the way, that "sublimation" of NH4Cl MUST be done in a hood.  Both the NH3 gas and HCl gas will be VERY irritating.    Perhaps you should redefine your project.  For one thing, the different anions (sulfate and nitrate) pose a problem.  You will find it difficult enough to separate Cu and Mg but to get them back as the sulfate and nitrate will be a REALLY difficult.     It might be better if you were doing some kind of qualitative analysis lab where you see IF you have Cu or Mg in a sample.  Of course the color of copper compounds (blue) vs magnesium compounds (white) makes it a lot simpler.    Did your teacher sign off on this by the way?  I suggest you head back to the drawing board and come up with a more "do-able" project.

You and the earth and the air and everything else are going at the same speed.  So they might as well be standing still.    That said, the earth is NOT just an inertial reference frame going at a high speed.  Because it is spinning, you do have a couple of pseudoforces working on you.

N (sub t) = N (sub 0) * (1/2)^((t/t(sub 1/2))    1) N(sub 0) is the initial quantity of the thing that will decay (this quantity may be measured in grams, moles, number of atoms, etc.)  2) N (sub t) is the quantity that still remains and has not yet decayed after a time t  3) t(sub 1/2) is the half-life of the decaying quantity    So, because it takes a while to write out the whole thing again, and again, by typing, I'm doing it the common sense way. You're given that a half life is 1200 years, and that a period of 2400 years has passed from a 400g substance. That means two half lives have come and gone.

X0e6p9Ilaa	Yes, there is a reason for using chlorides.   When heated, the chlorine does not produce its own color which would interfere with the colors of the metals.  There are no excited states for chlorine that emit in the visible part of the EM spectrum.    The metals that can be identified by flame tests emit light in the visible spectrum when their atoms are in excited states.  When heated, electrons move to higher energy levels.  The electrons are unstable in these excited states and the electrons return to the ground state, releasing energy.  The energy that is released happens to have a corresponding wavelength that is in the visible part of the spectrum.  There are other wavelengths that are also emitted, but these are outside of the visible part of the spectrum.|`|4YZtwzb6aa	Chlorides in compounds do not really affect the flame color of the metal.

X0e6p9Ilaa	As for (1), the electrolysis of water is the chemical change.  In addition to the electrolysis of water, I like to argue that the precipitation of a salt from a solution is a chemical change.  Initially you had separate ions which combine to make a solid.  Obviously a change has occurred and you have produced a substance that didn't exist in the solution.  Of course, someone will say that we can take salt and dissolve it and make ions and then drive off the water and make salt again, but then you could argue that it is simply a reversible reaction.  You can take water and electrolyze it and make H2 and O2 and burn the H2 in O2 to make water.  Reversible.    As for (2), only the last equation actually has the correct formula for oxygen, which is O2.    As for (3) you know it must be exothermic because the temp continue to rise and if you start with two elements and make something else, then the reaction is a synthesis reaction.    As for (4) through (7), these are self evident.  You must be able to balance equations and write simple formulas and names on your own.  The Greek prefixes tell you the number of atoms of each element.|`|ln1z1nkhaa	i only know number 7 sorry , its that mass can neither be created or destroyed by that i mean what is on one side of the equation must be equal to the other side     eg: h2 + o2= 2h2o 2 times h2 = 4 hydrogens 2 time Oxygen give u balanced     as oxygen has a valency of 2 and hydrogen only has a vanency of 1 u need 4 hydrogens to balance out the equation     hopes this help been a while since i have done chemistry|`|SLy9xFwkaa	number 1 is C because you have a gas (steam) chemicaly changing into H2O (Water) ... be like ice to water from a solid to a liquid.      and im almost sure the chemical symbol for Oxygen is O2  and in questoin 2 i only see 1 answer with 02 in it.       and number 6 is something about sulfer and nitrogen..

4YZtwzb6aa	Yes. A and B are both dominant traits, while O is the recessive trait.    If your grandparents are O and A, that means that they're your father's parents.    From your father's parents, your father should have a genotype of AO (this would have a phenotype of blood type A).    Now your mother's blood type should have a genotype of BO (expressed as B) for the offspring to be blood type O (with genotype OO).    Using a Punnet square, there is a 25% probability that any of the four blood types is expressed in an offspring.    Therefore, a father of blood type A and a mother of blood type B can have an offspring of blood type O.|`|AmZkHfZLaa	I guess yes, inheritance also rules your blood group.|`|on9xLWegaa	yes, if both parents carry the O recessive gene and both give that gene to the kid.

O will show only when 2 Os come together!|`|cRz31MlMaa	Yes it is possible if both parents have a H allele (gene) (which is the same one that produces O blood type) and if the child inherits both of these alleles the child can be O. There is a 25% possibility the child will be AB, 25% A, 25%B and 25% O.|`|qUsJKSpCaa	yes 100%|`|rZYNCrcfaa	if you google dna blood groups then there are a few entries that come up - www.dnabioscience.co.uk shows the likelyhood of some blood types and the probability of what blood group can come from O and A  and some examples of variables.    Obviously this website only gives options if your unsure then get everyone involved to have a dna test.|`|3BoZZZajaa	We each carry a double set of genes for these blood types - one from each parent. The O blood gene is recessive and can be dominated by the A or B genes.    Your father could be AO (A from one parent, O from the other) and your mother could be BO (B from one parent, O from the other). They would test as being A and B, but still be each carrying the hidden O gene.    You could inherit the O from your father and the O from your mother. In the absence of an A or B gene, the two O's would prevail and you would test as O.     Grandparent O passed one of his O genes to his son or daughter. Grandfather A must have been AO and passed his O gene to his son or daughter.|`|T5OMklFZaa	yes, it is possible...    blood type/                     genotypes/                alleles  O/                                   ll/                              l recessive  A/                                   AA or Al/                  A co-dominant  B/                                   BB or Bl/                   B co-dominant  AB/                                 AB/                           A, B co-dominant    thus,    if the parents are:  blood type/               father = A/                            B = mother  genotype/                              Al/                            Bl  gametes/                          A and l/                       B and l      possible blood types for issue:  AB, Al, Bl, ll, thus, the children of this couple may display any of the blood types, including O (ll).

GGMKhDf5aa	Is this a trick question? Liquid.|`|va8quhPtaa	It is liquid.
mH1Tnv5Naa	Yes, Michel has it right.  The fact that you can see the cloud indicates that it is not a gas but composed of either very tiny water droplets or very tiny ice crystals, and sometimes both.  The gaseous state (water vapor) is not visible in the sky though it is obviously there.|`|UFteXlqwaa	In clouds, the water can have all of its three stages: gas, liquid and solid. It works like this:    Right above the sea, water molecules mix with the air. It is then a gas. As it rises due to the heat of the sunlight, it cools down by adiabatic effect. But then, for a given temperature the air can only carry a certain amount of water as gas. For 15 C, it is 13 grams of water per cubic meter. More than that, the water must condense into tiny droplets.    The interesting thing is that, in order to do that (condensation) water needs to give away energy in form of heat. And that is what makes the cloud to continue to climb.    At this stage, some of the water is still as gas and some has gathered into droplets of water.    As it keeps climbing, getting under freezing point, the water droplets turn into ice. But that too releases heat energy. And since the tiny water droplets need a mass to get rid of the heat, it may take some time and we have undercooled water droplets.    In fact, tiny water droplets can be undercooled to - 40 C before it freezes. But eventually, it will as cirrus clouds are only made of ice crystal.    But while underway, the water content of a cloud is gas, liquid and solid, with the former diminishing for the sake of the latter.    Note that when a cloud is pressed down in e.g. a high pressure, the opposite occurs; the adiabatic effect warms up the air and ice goes to water, then gas, taking with it heat as energy.    This particularity of water is the reason we perspire: the evaporation of our sweat needs heat energy to happen and it cools down our skin.    EDITED: Reading the other answers, I understand that there is a misunderstanding: water at atmospheric pressure and temperature is never a gas. Before it condenses into droplets of several molecules, it is simply single molecules of one atom of oxygen and two atoms of hydrogen. We call it a gas because, like a gas, it is not visible. But water is only in a gas form at sea level when over boiling point.|`|sX8SD7N9aa	Gas|`|kQSbBPppaa	gas!  droplets=steam=gas|`|52d5b7629c258eaed365def1591d3506aa	it is a solid. very fine mist like ice.|`|d9JUDZd4aa	Some of both.  Mostly gas, but the actual fluffy white stuff is condensed water vapor into small droplets, so in a cloud it exists as both.  at higher altitudes it freezes into ice crystals so depending on the conditions a cloud can exist in all three states|`|QNG4rslkaa	gas|`|bdzHtXJGaa	a very interesting question.  actually it is water vapor condensed on the dust particles .  but it is not entirely water because it is light enough to be carried in the air. according to me..... i think that the water vapor gets mixed with the pollution to make some acidic stuff......that's why everyone talks of acid rain.

It is true that ultrasound, like heat and many other things, can have different intensities.  High intensity ultrasound can damage living tissue the same way too much heat intensity can damage living tissue.  Ultrasound (also like heat) is used in a variety of applications for a variety of purposes.  Ultrasound is used for imaging features and organs inside the human body and for welding of plastics and metals.  Heat is used to increase circulation in muscles and to raise the temperature of a piece of steel red hot.  In both cases, if you use the technology for the wrong thing, the result will not be what you want.|`|sJCl1g1Faa	Just to add on, ultrasound is a non invasive surgery procedure.

KxpVOYrPaa	To build a robot u need to start to project the project starts with     What do u want the robot to do ?  What type of materials u need to use for the robot?  mostly people use RC servo motors to run the robots because they are accurate and has high torque  What type of controlling method u need to use? I will recommend using microcontrollers programmed using C++ it is the easiest if u had a background in C++, Atmel microcontrollers is a recommendation because they are easy to program.  After that u need to start designing the shape of the robot using a CAD software such as AutoCAD, remember when u design the robot use the data sheet of the equipment u are going to use cause they have the dimension of the part.  Now its time to assemble the robot and get it working.      Note: 99.99% of the people who builds robots the robots dont work at the first design.

55b8b91e6f5db6f02b2de3979ce36d0eaa	DNA can actually exist in multiple forms. Yes, the majority exists as its "b" form, a right-handed double helix that is the most well known form. It can also exist in an "a" form, which is a right handed, more highly-compacted double helix, and, strangely enough, in a "z" form, a contorted, left-handed double helix.     Also stranger is a rare form of DNA with partial "triple helices," known colloquially as H-DNA (Sony, eat your heart out). This can occur when long stretches of T/C nucleotides occur in a line, and what is seen is that one strand folds backwards over itself to base pair a second time with the A/G residues bound to the long stretch of T/C. The complementary strand remains partially single stranded while this occurs. This structure introduces kinks into the genome. Crazy, no?    This is only a short overview of DNA, as other important forms of DNA included methylated vs. non-methylated, single-stranded DNA, and even "triplex DNA," cause by the Hoogstein base pairing phenomenon.

You get 12.4(24) Now subtract 0.1(24) from that (basically 100x - x). You get 12.3, because all those recurring numbers cancel. And what is 100x - x? 99x. Thus, you get 12.3 = 99x, and you end up with 12.3/99 = x. That is your fraction. And actually, it is 123/990.

Call this function m(t) for slope.  Then you compute dm/dx the same way, by dividing dm/dt by dx/dt and you have your second derivative with respect to x.    If you really wanted d^2x/dy^2 you could switch the role of x and y from their usual roles.

It can not travel faster than the speed of light and escape the black hole.  It can't have enough velocity to escape the gravity of the black hole and simultaneously be inside the event horizon.    All of these are impossible, so it is anybody's guess what would happen if impossible things are possible.|`|RfOLqUKlaa	Im not even going to bother trying to read through that.

(hey just try to imagine the thing it'll be really a nice experience "Happy journey")  before that u need to understand in space the signals which A sends to  B are dependent on the curvature of the space-time like if u wer on the ground and u r granny on the hill if she shouts out nicky u hear it a bit late because sound takes time to travel through the air in between u and u r granny.............     Now lets start suppose u and me were on a space trip i was in spaceship A and u in B Intially both  the spaceships A n B r traveling   suddenly ship A unknowlingly gets itself to the Black hole until this event has taken place  we can watch both oh us live in the TV's(supposing v r having the same relative velocity) Now suddenly i get trapped in the bent space time of an immense black hole (this is wer u need to concentrate) now i'm nearing the black hole wen i send u a live signal from my cam "first the signal has to reach u "  wen i'm nearing the black hole the signals which i send u gets go lower in frequency due to the curvature of the space-time near the black hole would see everything happening a second late than what has happened in my space-ship this is bcoz of particularly the space-time(which in turn causes this effect to quote also gravity) now i get to stuck up in the ergosphere of the black hole and gett started rotating around the black-hole now the signals will reach u more slowly than it did bfore bacuse in the ergosphere theres a least chance of the light getting out from it due to the immensing of the curvature of the space time now my signals reachn u have gone more slow or their frequency gets reduced and u get a delated signal u see things that have happend in my space craft that were min frm yours. As i near the event horizion the curvature of the space time gets more and more immmense  now u c my signals get worsely delayed and slowly as i proceed more and more near the singularity wer u litearally have a gravity-well(i meant of the space-time) u cannot literally recive my signal and observe my clock in the spce ship has stopped ticking.........now i'm in the singularity of the black hole thanx to my unbreakable shp i'm alive as i reach out of the black the same things happen reversed.............      hope u got it.............|`|10346d732bc649a3c020bc022ac27705aa	hi,actualy the black holes are among thoes things that scientist havent come to a common conclusion but search the web to get more info about the BLACK HOLE.  enjoy ?!|`|P94zA72daa	I think to speculate on this problem does not require gravity as strong as that of a black hole. Gravitational time dilation can occur in smaller gravities as well and thus, there is no need to break the laws of physics to get your answer.     Yes, the spaceship in the stronger GF will seem to slow down to an outside observer. Your question is hard to understand but i think your asking what happens if A is broadcasting an image of B from itself to B. Right?    A is in the strong GF looking at B and simultaneously broadcasting a signal to B. It cannot broadcast a signal back to where B was, it has to broadcast it to where B is now. Therefore, B cannot receive a signal from an event it hasn'[t seen occur yet.     I think your question assumes that there is a single correct timeline. There isnt however. A is correct in saying B is speeding up (it is from A's perspective) and vice versa.|`|sTmG8uqRaa	its physically improbable to not get destroyed by a blackhole so its a stupid and pointless question

yHbX1hspaa	Normal body cells have a number of important characteristics.  They can        * Reproduce themselves exactly             * Stop reproducing at the right time             * Stick together in the right place             * Self destruct if they are damaged             * Become specialised or 'mature'        *      * Stop reproducing at the right time             * Stick together in the right place             * Self destruct if they are damaged             * Become specialised or 'mature'    How cancer cells are different  Cancer cells are different to normal cells in several ways.  They don't die if they move to another part of the body and        * Cancer cells don't stop reproducing              * Cancer cells don't obey signals from other cells              * Cancer cells don't stick together               * Cancer cells don't specialise, but stay immature    Cancer cells don't stop reproducing    Unlike normal cells, cancer cells do not stop reproducing after they have doubled 50 or 60 times.  This means that a cancer cell will go on and on and on doubling. So one cell becomes 2, then 4, then 8, then 16....    The cancer cells may be able to stop themselves self destructing.  Or they may self destruct more slowly than they reproduce, so that their numbers continue to increase.  Eventually a tumour is formed that is made up of billions of copies of the original cancerous cell.  Scientists describe cancer cells as being 'immortal'.    Something in the cancer cells overrides the normal signalling system.  This may be because the genes that tell the cell to reproduce keep on and on firing.  Or because the genes that normally tell the cell to stop reproducing have been damaged or lost.  So the cancer cell keeps on doubling, regardless of the damage the extra cells cause to the part of the body where the cancer is growing.    Cancer cells can lose the molecules on their surface that keep normal cells in the right place.  So they can become detached from their neighbours.    Unlike normal cells, cancer cells do not carry on maturing once they have been made. In fact, the cells in a cancer can become even less mature over time. With all the reproducing, it is not surprising that more of the genetic information in the cell can become lost. So the cells become more and more primitive and tend to reproduce more quickly and even more haphazardly.    Why is it difficult to cure cancer?    The cause of most cancers is still not known: Scientists have unraveled increasingly complex genetic pathways responsible for cancers. The plethora of data lacks a unifying insight and this precludes any focused therapy. Although success stories with cancers like Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (drug Imatinib) have been encouraging, most of the cancers still are stubbornly unyielding.     Chemotherapy limitations: Present therapies are toxic to normal cells as well the cancerous cells. So when they are administered they have a myriad of side-effects which sometimes are too severe enough to even cause death. They also lead to various unpleasant side effects and thus reduced acceptability and need to be discontinued on many occasions. The development of tumor resistance (like antibiotic resistance) to these drugs is another roadblock because it renders the drug ineffective against the tumors they were initially effective.     Occult symptoms: The symptoms of cancer are so non-specific(no typical symptoms and can present in any way e.g., just weakness or even without any symptom) that they are often neglected and patients seek help only when its spread beyond the available treatment options.|`|xopIi2Vfaa	their cell division program does not underly the usual control any more.   There are tons of different regulatory processes and molecules in the cell which control cell division and cell death. A misfunction of most of them can lead to cancer, so cancer isn't just a single mechanism disease.    Read a textbook for more. Look up the term oncogene.|`|eS5VOgKfaa	Cancer cells are different to normal cells in many ways. There is a feel that they have to have undergone some kind of DNA damage- and hence mutation or a sequence of mutations in genes that maintain or govern cell cycle, or other attributes.    Such cells tend to have any or a combination of the following features.  Cancer cells become imortalised- i.e. they can divide indefinitely, and sometimes without the presence of growth factors.    Cancer cells are invasive and not contact inhibited- most cells stop growing when they touch something else.    Over expression or over secretion of growth receptors and factors respectively.    Some proteins are specialised in checking DNA before a cell divides for damage. These proteins hence the ability to arrest cells before they continue to the full cell cycle. An important protein for this is p53. More than 50% of human cancers are actually caused by amutationn in the gene that codes for this protein.    Cancer is difficult to cure for a number of reasons. Once cancer has established it means the sequential DNA damage has occured once and can again. Also any treatments will damage otherwise healthy cells as the cancer cells are still somatic cells.     Some research is now being developed into smart cures, which maybe able to recognise and target cancer cells- perhaps by locating cells that are over- secreting a particular receptor for example.    Hope this helps.

Note that     1 mole of water at 18 g / mole is needed to make 2 moles of HNO3 at 63 g / mole    This means the ratio in grams (not moles) is   [1 mole H2O * 18 grams/mole] / [2 moles HNO3 * 63 grams / mole] or    18 grams H2O / 126 grams HNO3    Now you want to make 75.9 grams HNO3 and need to know how much water in grams you need.  Let's call the water in grams needed x and solve for x.  Using the proportion    18 grams H2O/126 grams HNO3 = x grams H2O / 75.9 g HNO3    note what I did above and understand this as the above step is the critical step    now solve for x and you see    x grams H20 ={[18 grams H2O] x [75.9 g HNO3]} / [126 grams HNO3]     now from the above equation you just calculate.

These are used by the male to stimulate the female prior to and during mating - the spurs of males are larger than those of females for this reason.

I'll add another example.    I'm guessing (and only you know if it's true) that you are some denomination of Protestant Christian.   If so then you know enough about the history of your church to know that Protestantism emerged from Catholicism in Europe ... and has since branched and branched again until there are Lutherans, Anglicans, Episcopalians, Baptists, Methodists, etc..    So why are there still Catholics?    Or more to the point, why didn't *all* Catholics become Methodists?  (Why did some branches result in Baptists and Episcopalians?)   How do all of these branches co-exist if they all came from the same ancestor (Catholicism)?    If you can answer that question, the same logic applies to evolution.    If some A's become B's ... that doesn't mean that *ALL* A's become B's.   And it does not mean that there can't also be C's, D's, and E's that all came from the same ancestor A.

R9KvEhMxaa	Well that's an incredibly biased piece.    Neuroleptic Malignant syndrome is exceedingly rare. Usually happens with overdose. And when I mean rare, I mean probably about thousand cases a year, across the entire range of drugs that cause it, which is quite large.    There have been less than ten cases of tardive dyskinesia symptoms with Abilify, all of which occured in multidrug cocktails amongst elderly patients, and all of which resolved immediately upon stopping the drug, which most cases of TD do not.    All the medications in this class are black-boxed against use in the elderly. Abilify, tending to be a more stimulating AAP would not be used like one of the more problematic drugs like quetiapine or olanzapine. I can't conceive of any real reason you'd want to use this one. Use of AAPs in elderly is usually to try to control the sort of off the deep end senile aggression that shows up in nursing homes and the like.    And what's this? Diabetics? Blood sugar problems?

Then you will solve this type of questions easily.    In some books you will find that they say "mass and weight are same". But it is totally wrong!     The mass of a thing is constant.   Example: The mass of a car is 800 kg. It means that 800 kg is constant. In earth, in moon or in sun, it is 800 kg. No change. In 0 Kelvin, 100 or 1000 Kelvin, it is 800 kg. It is MASS.    Weight is measured in Newton unit.   1 kg = 9.8 N (on earth)    Example: Weight of a car is 800 kg = 800 x 9.8 N (on earth)  Weight = 0 N (in the center of earth)  Weight defers from place to place.    Note: None of these are depended on TEMPERATURE. THESE ARE DEPENDED ON PLACE.    So, the mass of water will not change in any condition.  The weight depends on place. If you boil water in a open pot, the weight will change. But in such a condition from which no vapor will come outside, the weight will not change.     Discuss it with your teacher if you cannot understand my words. Always try to learn clearly. Good luck!
tip6XQnkaa	the Potential energy function is an antiderivative ( indefinite integral ) of the force. so, to find the force as a function of x, we differentiate the potential energy:    F(x) = U'(x) = Ub sin(bx)).    we have to fix the reference frame at a point where the force is 0. this is the equilibrium position. we HAVE to do this because in SHM, position x is measured relative to the equilibrium position. here, if we sub. x = 0 in F(x), we get F = 0. so, the origin is indeed the equilibrium position and we need not change anything.    F(x) = Ub sin(bx)....................(1)    now, for small oscillations sin(bx)  bx. so,    F(x) = Ub^2 x.    m* (d^2x / dt^2) = Ub^2 x.    (d^2x / dt^2) = (Ub^2/m) x.    comparing with the standard SHM equation,    d^2x / dt^2 = w^2 x,    w^2 = Ub^2 / m.    w = bU/m    T = 2 / w = 2/b m/U.|`|20a28a16f9146e565f0d0f4721edc101aa	U(x) = U(1 - cos bx) = U(b^2 x^2/2) = (1/2)(Ub^2)x^2 for small x.   Let Ub^2 = k . Then we have U(x) = 1/2 k x^2.   or - dU/dx = F(x) = -kx. So the time period, T of SHM for small oscillations is given by   T = 2 Pi sqrt(m/k) = (2Pi/b) sqrt (m/U)

Simply because a drug acts as an antidepressant does not mean that taking it when not depressed will cause elation.   In fact, in non-depressed patients, these drugs have few if any effects that could be considered of "recreational" interest.  However, if you were foolish enough to take large enough dose of most any drug, you will get some effect.  It may be far from the one  you seek, but changing brain chemistry does have consequences.  Several people have correctly replied that the reuptake inhibition of serotonin begins shortly after use but requires a cumulative effect over time (weeks) before changes in affect are experienced. You don't want to change sensitive brain chemistry with a sledge hammer.|`|yHI6rfeUaa	Absolutely NO drug, legal or otherwise, has any legitimate recreational use.  Taking unneeded substances of any kind is an abuse of and to your body.|`|BpChBQBQaa	No they do not.  They're not designed for "quick highs".  In fact, because they are "selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors" it takes quite a long period of time (over a week) for the full effects to be in operation.  Think of it as if they work by giving you a constant steady amount of serotonin - this is why you will see some people on Prozac etc with constantly above average up-beat demeanors and who don't really give a hoot.    There are far better safer substances out there for you.  Even right down to the right food and simple exersise can determine the amount of serotonin released into the system - perhaps you could say, your own natural high.    Always think of the simple formula of "gain versus consequence" when taking any drug.

0AUPrCMZaa	salt does not cause water to melt.  all the salt does is act as a catalyst to lower the freezing point of water - so it doesnt freeze as fast.  to my knowledge salt water does not cause the caps to melt.    the other way around is the problem.  when the caps melt the fresh water mixes with the salt water changing the concentration making the salt water less dense in certain areas, in turn, this screws up the ocean currents....which causes other problems.    it is entirely to cold at the caps, even if you lower the temperature with salt - it would not effect them.|`|Kez4IjWqaa	Interesting question. I would say that the salt may effect the ice caps, but not a concerning rate.     Although i am not entirely sure if there is a large difference between that of the grit salt used on snow/ice and the salt in the sea, i would assume the grit has been altered to specifically melt the ice.

AA11606721	No other organism on earth will ever evolve into any type of human. "Human" is not some specified "type" that evolves when situations are right. Just like every other living thing, our evolutionary history is unique. We descended from isolated family groups of ancestral primates subject to millions of years of happenstance - that path will not be repeated.    It may well be that certain primates will evolve over the millennia to be more successful and more intelligent then humans can imagine - but they won't be human.|`|r18r2bLiaa	Everything possible in this world for me|`|FORX7yfQaa	This has already happened.|`|1gaZTy2Taa	Yes, they will be our monkey servants.|`|LVJjGaJ3aa	no and may be.    no because we are not the 'direct' descendants of primates. Instead, few modifications in the genetic makeup of primates caused these primates with mutations in their genes to speciate and move away from their ancestor primates in reference of evolution. and this alone took several hundereds thousands of years. so, for the primates now to develop into primitive humans, right mutations in the right genes at right time needs to happen and the mutation must be stable and preferred. in other words, history needs to repeats itself which is pretty much impossible.    may be because of what i just said in the second half of above paragraph.|`|AA11513203	You mean *other* primates (since one branch of primate has already evolved into humans).    But the answer is no.    If you want to understand evolution, you HAVE to let go of the notion that humans are some sort of "pinnacle", or "advanced", or "higher" species ... some sort of "goal" for evolution that other species have not "achieved" yet.    Humans are just another leaf on the tree.    So are modern chimps.  So are modern orangutans.   So are modern macaque monkeys.    The other primates are not some sort of "pre-human" species.  A chimp is not some sort of earlier stage of pre-human evolution.    Chimps are no more likely to evolve into primitive humans, than humans are likely to evolve into primitive chimps.    If you can understand that very, very, very important point ... then you are on your way to understanding evolution ... and you are on your way to thinking like a biologist.|`|AA12203329	No I'm sure by then they'll all be gone.|`|c3eed016f322f33195a03d27536df75caa	its possible. why don't you wait and see!|`|RJDDC5Kgaa	I think humans will probably become more primative primates in a million years or so.|`|S8H5yYcoaa	As the theory goes, some primates already did evolve into humans.  However, that was a very long time ago, under very specific climate and resource pressures, and they were filling a biological niche that was not yet filled.    Evolution is a pretty random process - natural selection is somewhat guided by the environment, but of course genetic mutation is unpredictable... so it is possible the primate genome wanders down that route again.  However, in order for it to stick to just that path, something needs to happen to the non-humanoid primates; either they need to be wiped out or otherwise separated from these humanoid ones, or they will mate, their DNA will simply recombine and the genetic code will wander back in the direction of primate.    Especially where right now, pressures on life are different than they were around the time when proto-humans first emerged, and where now man is filling that niche, it is evolutionarily disadvantageous to be moving toward a genome similar to man's, so as long as we're around, it's very unlike this will happen.

A tsunami can move hundreds of miles per hour in the open ocean and smash into land with waves as high as 100 feet or more.    Where do Tsunamis occur?    From the area where the tsunami originates, waves travel outward in all directions. Once the wave approaches the shore, it builds in height. The topography of the coastline and the ocean floor will influence the size of the wave. There may be more than one wave and the succeeding one may be larger than the one before. That is why a small tsunami at one beach can be a giant wave a few miles away.    All tsunamis are potentially dangerous, even though they may not damage every coastline they strike. A tsunami can strike anywhere along most of the U.S. coastline. The most destructive tsunamis have occurred along the coasts of California, Oregon, Washington, Alaska, and Hawaii.    Earthquake-induced movement of the ocean floor most often generates tsunamis. If a major earthquake or landslide occurs close to shore, the first wave in a series could reach the beach in a few minutes, even before a warning is issued. Areas are at greater risk if they are less than 25 feet above sea level and within a mile of the shoreline.     Drowning is the most common cause of death associated with a tsunami. Tsunami waves and the receding water are very destructive to structures in the run-up zone. Other hazards include flooding, contamination of drinking water, and fires from gas lines or ruptured tanks.    Learn about floods that can result from tsunamis    Remembering one of the biggest Tsunamis    The 2004 Indian Ocean Earthquake was an underwater earthquake that was centered off the coast of Sumatra, Indonesia. The earthquake created a disastrous Tsunami that destroyed the coastlines of eleven countries. The Tsunami killed over 225,000 people and was one of the most deadliest Tsunamis in the history of natural disasters.

GGMKhDf5aa	Well first you have to multiply everything out. It would be:    1) 8ay + 20aby + 28by = 8ay - x + 28 From here you can cancel out 8ay.  2) 20aby + 28by = -x + 28 Now you move terms.  3) 20aby + 28by - 28 = -x Now you reverse signs.  4) x = 28 - (20aby + 28by) And you have x.     But I'm pretty sure you don't mean 28, and you mean 28by. If that's the case, then skip to 3) and continue    3) 20aby + 28by - 28by = -x From here, you can cancel out 28by.  4) -x = 20aby Just reverse sign order.  5) x = -20aby And you have your value for x.
QPWjtDzcaa	Lunar eclipses would be a lot different.  For strters, there would be fewer of them.  The probability of the moon "falling" into the smaller shadow of the earth would be more narrow.  And, if it were small enough, a lunar eclipse would look like just a small shadow crossing the lunar disc.  Or even smaller yet, and the moon would never enter earth's shadow at all.    Solar eclipses wouldn't be much different.  A larger percentage of the earth would still get to see them, but the size of the moons shadow cast on the earth would still be the same.    All of this is assuming you changed *only* the diameter of the earth.  Mass, velocity, and distances of all objects involved would remain the same in the explanation I stated above (and so, obviously, this would mean the earth would have greater density).|`|f180924fa608a1843cfd44f843639824aa	Try asking at www.space.com and you'll receive an informed answer.|`|C9AbiTDdaa	i dont think so.

f0ed2ce5d291634d748cb1ae9b52d651aa	0 = x/(4 + x^2) + (4 - x)/(x^2 - 8x + 25)^(0.5)    This can be transformed to :  x^6 - 8x^5 + 23x^4 - 56x^3 + 119x^2 - 128x + 256 = 0    Solving using Newton's iterative method gives 2 answers :  x = 3.32 or x = 4.56    However, plugging x = 3.32, back into the  original equation, gives an erroneous result.    Thus, there is only one real root. More accurately, it is :  x = 4.56122504131112.
PnaeoH3eaa	The points you refer to in your question as B and C are reversed on your diagram. I will use the letters on the diagram.    This can be done by calculus but there is a quicker way. Reflect A in the shoreline DE to point A'. The line from A' to C is then a single straight line. Extend the line from A' up beyond the A to a new point F level with B. You can then use similar triangles to get the answer in your head.    BD/DA' = FC/FA' ----> x/2 = 4/5 ----> x = 1.6

X0e6p9Ilaa	Be careful, be very, very careful.  By definition, an acid is a substance in solution, usually an aqueous solution.    What you are probably referring to are compounds that COULD be acids if they were dissolved in water, but until they are dissolved in water they aren't acids.    Take HCl, for instance.  As a gas, HCl is called hydrogen chloride.  Only when it is dissolved in water does it become hydrochloric acid.  The anhydrous liquid, commonly called "hydrogen acetate", HC2H3O2, or acetic acid, or ethanoic acid, doesn't take on acidic properties until it is dissolved in water.  Then there is benzoic acid, C6H5COOH, which is a weak, organic acid, and it is a solid.    ====== Follow up =======    For all of those responders who said that HCl is a "liquid acid", I must respectfully disagree.  Please don't confuse a substance which is a liquid with a solution.  HCl at room temp and 1 atm is a gas, not a liquid.  When it dissolves in water it forms a solution, but the HCl itself is not a liquid.    Hydrogen fluoride, HF, actually boils right at room temperature.|`|FD8I4zthaa	Acids only become so when dissociated in an aqueous solution.|`|X4EBNoNUaa	Pisgah has the best overall answer..except actually there are acids that need not be dissociated in water to liberate protons. By definition a Lewis acid is a compound that accepts an electron pair (not the Arrhenius / Lowry Bronsted definition which calls an acid a proton donor). Boron trifluoride is a gas which can react with electron pair donors in the gaseous state . So by DEFINITION, BF3 is a gaseous ACID.  Another solid acid is metaphosphoric acid ( HPO3) and liquid acids abound, acetic , propionic, butyric, etc etc .|`|mGvSEY6Saa	liquid - hydrochloric acid HCl (l)  or        sulphuric acid - SO4 (l)  gas - carbon monoxide is acidic - CO (g)  solid -  hydrocholoic (s)    not sure about that last one, but liquid and gas are right|`|M3ImexJoaa	As the previous answers stated, acids can't express their acidity without being in aqueous solution. But if you meant asking for a solid, liquid, and gaseous compounds that can be dissolved in water to be acids:    Gaseous: HCl (Hydrogen Chloride)  Liquid: CH3COOH (Acetic Acid), H2SO4 (Sulfuric Acid)  Solid: C2H2O4 (Oxalic Acid), C6H8O7 (Citric Acid)    Quote from Wikipedia.org:  "Acids can be gases, liquids, or solids. Respective examples (at 20 C and 1 atm) are hydrogen chloride, sulfuric acid and citric acid. Solutions of acids in water are liquids, such as hydrochloric acid - an aqueous solution of hydrogen chloride. At 20 C and 1 atm, linear carboxylic acids are liquids up to nonanoic acid (nine carbon atoms) and solids beginning from decanoic acid (ten carbon atoms). Aromatic carboxylic acids, the simplest being benzoic acid, are solids."|`|ThYN1mFFaa	Solid acid = trichloroacetic acid; can't draw the structure here  Liquid acid = hydrochloric acid; HCl  Gaseous acid = hydroflouric acid; HF|`|kS1w49Jlaa	No.|`|sJCl1g1Faa	What's an acid.

Basically any material which has unwanted radioactive properties.  UK definitions:  Very low level waste: in small quantities this can be disposed of to landfill, very slight contamination. A quote from DEFRA: "Very low-level radioactive waste (VLLW) is a subset of LLW, formally defined in the 1995 Cm2919 White Paper, each 0.1m3 of which contains less than 400 kilobecquerels (kBq) of beta/gamma activity, or single items containing less than 40kBq of beta/gamma activity, which can be safely disposed of with ordinary refuse (dustbin disposal). In some authorisations for disposal of VLLW, for the radionuclides carbon-14 and hydrogen-3 (tritium), the concentration limits are relaxed by a factor of 10." Note no alpha is allowed in VLLW.  LLW is higher than VLLW but below 4 GBQ/tonne of alpha or 12 GBq/tonne of beta/gamma nuclides. (from sofa.dartnet.co.uk)  Intermediate level waste is above those limits, old nuclear plant is classed as ILW as parts of it are highly radioactive.

bbf482485b71760a0170b5baf7ae67fdaa	Yes, i believe it does if you measure force in slugs. I think one slug of force will accellerate one pound mass by 1 foot per second per second.|`|92f97d29e3d55f3219cc25dfabd347c7aa	Sure. Usually, imperial units use pounds as the units of both mass and force.  A pound of force acting on a pound of mass gives it gravitational acceleration.    Consequently, you have to adjust Newton's second law to read:  F = m (a/g)    This works out quite conveniently for everyday purposes because then weight and mass are the same thing.  Dividing a force by a mass gives you an acceleration in g's.  Of course it's not so convenient if your acceleration is orders of magnitude away from g, which is why SI doesn't use gravitational units.    In everyday use (not SI), folks do the same thing with the metric kilogram--it serves as both mass and force (ask folks on the street their weight and they'll answer you in kg, not newtons), so you have to insert the g into Newton's 2nd law.  Sometimes engineers will compromise between everyday use and SI by using the unit of deca-Newton for force.  Since g is roughly 10m/s^2, a deca-newton is about the same as a kilogram of force.  So a lift rated for 500 deca-N can hold 500kg (with a little safety margin).    Very rarely, you'll see a unit of force called the poundal.  It's a pound of mass times one foot per second^2.  Also rarely, you'll see a unit of mass called a slug.  It's a pound of force divided by a foot per second^2.  So you can use F=ma if you measure mass in pounds and force in poundals OR if you measure force in pounds and mass in slugs.|`|JR3Ol1VGaa	Yes. But only because you would be defining force using imperial units.    American's often quote force in "pounds" but what they are really trying to say is "equal to the gravitational force of x pounds".    Newtons (the metric for force) could equally be called kilogram meters per second (squared). So imperial force would be measured in pound feet per second (squared) or pound Miles per hour (squared) depending on what you measured force in.    It works and it means the same thing, but you must define your units differently.|`|jTmQfDuraa	yes the equation still stands but the units are different:  F is in dynes, M in pounds and A in ft/s2

yxnUBSJqaa	No.    It has to do with barrier voltage potentials established at the junctions of the device.  The P and N junctions to be more precise.  These barriers are non-restrictive and correspond to voltage potentials, not resistance.|`|4fWZL4TRaa	Yes that is the answer more or less.    From the Wiki link below. "Origin of the term":  Transistor. This is an abbreviated combination of the words "transconductance" or "transfer", and "varistor". The device logically belongs in the varistor family, and has the transconductance or transfer impedance of a device having gain, so that this combination is descriptive.       Bell Telephone Laboratories  Technical Memorandum (May 28, 1948)    Pierce, the Bell employee whose name was chosen for the device said later:  "The way I provided the name, was to think of what the device did. And at that time, it was supposed to be the dual of the vacuum tube. The vacuum tube had transconductance, so the transistor would have 'transresistance.' And the name should fit in with the names of other devices, such as varistor and thermistor. And. . . I suggested the name 'transistor.'       John R. Pierce, interviewed for PBS show "Transistorized!"    Edit:  The nobel prize link gives the definition used "when it was announced" but that is a little vague in meaning. It is more or less the same as the Pierce explanation. I guess this is the stuff myth is made of, but the Pearce explanation seems to be commonly accepted now.    Interestingly in August 1948 German physicists Herbert F. Matar (1912 ) and Heinrich Welker (ca. 19121981), working at Compagnie des Freins et Signaux Westinghouse in Aulnay-sous-Bois, France applied for a patent on an amplifier based on the minority carrier injection process which they called the "transistron". Their work was also following work on semiconductor diodes for RADAR during WW2.|`|wJTsifugaa	You are correct. According to the source below, the name transistor is a combination of the words transfer and resistor - a transfer resistor - a transistor. When it was announced the name was explained; "because it is a resistor or semiconductor device which can amplify electrical signals as they are transferred through it from input to output terminals."

However, unless you are doing very precise measurement you can assume an aqueous solution has the density of water.    Edit:  If you really want to adjust for density differences, you will add 200g/dm3 or .2g/cc.  If we assume a negligible volume change from the dissolved copper sulphate then each cc of water is 1.2g.  However, the solute is likely to alter the volume and it is difficult to predict the exact degree a general basis because each solid will dissolve and interact with the solvent in its own unique way.  Maybe there's a chemist here who can tell us about how copper sulphate affects the volume when it is dissolved.|`|yHI6rfeUaa	1 cubic centimeter (cc) is 1 milliliter (ml) which is a volume unit.    gram is a mass unit; they are not the same    now it turns out that 1 ml of pure water at 4 degrees C weighs 1 gram and this is the gram standard.    your Copper Sulfate solution -     200 g / dm^3  = 200 g / [0.1 m]^3 = 200 g /[10^-3m^3]    and 1 m^3 = 10^3 liter    so     200 g / dm^3 = 200 g /{[10^-3 m^3] * [10^3 l / m^3]} = 200 g / liter

What we've noticed is the farther away planets are the colder obviously and the atmosphere would contain things like methane and hydrogen and helium in ample quantities.  The closer they are, the better chance for life.  I believe that there is life out there definitely because yesterday I saw what appeared to be UFOs.

DRVSCxKpaa	1: Determine molecular mass of MgSO4.7H2O by adding atomic masses:  Mg + S + 4O + 14H + 7O (hint: a little less than 250)  Then determine formula mass of 7xH2O = 14xx1.008 + 7x16  Now you can detemine %H2O by dividing formula mass of 7xH20 by formula mass of MgSO4.7H2O and multiplying by 100    2:  Each element is present in different sized atoms.  Therefore, You have to convert % composition to ratios of atomic masses.  Divide each % by the formula mass eg for C it is 37.5% divide by 12.  For O it is 50% div by 16 and for H it is 12.5% div by 1.008.  This will give you numbers that are close to even number ratios (ie, they will be multiples of each other).  This is the empirical formula, which is the ratio of the atoms in the molecule. (hint: it is 1,1,4, but you work ourt why)  Now look at the molecular mass (192)  The empirical mass shows the ratio of each molecule, and the molecular mass the total atomic masses.  You can now work out the formula (hint, add the atomic masses in the empirical formula together, and divide the molecular mass by this number.  This will show you the approximate number you have to multiply EACH of the elements in the empirical formula to arrive at the molecular mass.  Check by adding up the atomic masses in your formula, to make sure they add up to 192.     eg, if your number was near 8, check that 8x12 (for C) + 8x16 (for O) + 8x1x4 (for H) add up to 192.  it doesn't)    3.  This is the inverse of question 1: you need to know how many molecules of water were attached to each CoCl2.  If after removing the water, the anhydrous CoCl2 weighed 0.88g; there were 1.62 - 0.88g = 0.72g of H2O removed. work out the % wter this is, then look at answer 1, to see how to work backwards to get the number of molecules H2O present in each hydrate molecule.    4: This is the inverse of question 2: Multiply the number of each atom in the molecule by its atomic weight to derive mass ratios, then work out percentages.

Easterly variation is subtracted and Westerly variation is added. for example. i am in oklahoma standing in TULSA, my compass shows heading of 360 deg ... and my map says of variation of 4 deg EAST... so my magnetic heading is 360 deg where as my true heading is 356 deg.    i hope it was useful.  good luck!|`|Sw0u2RD7aa	the water is in the compass so the needle can float freely.

Carnot's theorem, also called Carnot's rule is a principle which sets a limit on the maximum amount of efficiency any possible engine can obtain, which thus solely depends on the difference between the hot and cold temperature reservoirs. Carnot's theorem states:  No engine operating between two heat reservoirs can be more efficient than a Carnot engine operating between the same reservoirs.    The rule was an essential stepping stone towards the formulation of the second law of thermodynamics. When transforming thermal energy into mechanical energy, the thermal efficiency of a heat engine is the percentage of energy that is transformed into work.

AA10929714	For (1), the system will undergo a phase transition from the liquid to the gaseous state if temperature is increased at constant pressure.    For (2), you need to recognize that water is unusual, in that the slope of the solid-liquid phase boundary is negative (if pressure is plotted on the vertical axis, and temperature on the horizontal axis).  That means that reducing the pressure on a sample of liquid water near the1-atm  freezing temperature will first cause sample to freeze (undergo a transition from the liquid to the solid phase).  As the pressure is decreased further, the pressure will eventually drop below the vapor pressure of solid water at the relevant temperature, and the water will sublimate (undergo a phase transition from the solid to the gaseous state).

But the close ray which is inclined would bend away from the normal and hence will appear to come form a point raised a little. If angle of incidence is x which is very small angle of emergence would be x' which will be larger that x. such that sin x' /sin x = 1.50. Because x -s small sinx will be also equal to tan x. Hence the emergent ray will appear to come not from D the real depth but from D' the apparent depth. So we have D/D' = 1.50 or D' = D/1.50. D = 3.00 cm So D' = 3/1.50 = 2.00cm

199ccf77f95816e7630fe288143d7190aa	Mauna Loa    Mauna Loa (pronounced /?m??n? ?lo??/ or /?ma?n? ?lo??/ in English, [?moun? ?lo?] in Hawaiian) is the largest volcano on earth and one of five volcanoes that form the Island of Hawaii in the U.S. state of Hawai?i in the Pacific Ocean. It is an active shield volcano, with a volume estimated at approximately 18,000 cubic miles (75,000 km3),[2] although its peak is about 120 feet (37 m) lower than that of its neighbor, Mauna Kea. The Hawaiian name "Mauna Loa" means "Long Mountain". Lava eruptions from Mauna Loa are silica-poor, thus very fluid: and as a result eruptions tend to be non-explosive and the volcano has extremely shallow slopes.

Every time we got a better idea of just how shiny it was, we realized it was quite a tiny planet, barely the size of our own Moon.    Then the real nail in Pluto's coffin came when the discovery of more, many more wayward rocks, some larger some smaller than Pluto out in the depths past Neptune.  If Pluto is a planet, aren't they all?  10 planets?  23?  600?  Where to draw the line?|`|vl0HWTDJaa	Lol, it's not that pluto isn't there anymore, it's just not following the normal patterns of orbit so they're not including it as a planet any more.|`|WVPYem5Vaa	It isn't; Pluto is still there, but its status as a planet was revoked after a new definition. Pluto is now called a "dwarf planet".    Planets are bodies that are large enough to allow their own gravity to pull them into a spherical shape, and they must have cleared their orbits of debris. Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune follow this definition.    Dwarf planets must likewise be spherical, but they have not cleared their orbits of debris. Pluto, Ceres and Eris are three bodies that fit this definition.    It is actually possible for planets to leave orbit. Close encounters with planets, or other passing bodies, can perturb their orbits and provide them with excess momentum to break them free from the Sun's gravity.|`|aOBmcGAZaa	Pluto hasn't gone anywhere. It's still orbiting the Sun as always, it's just no longer classified as a planet.    In 2006 the IAU created a new definition for the term "Planet".    The new definition of the term "Planet" is as follows:  "a celestial body that (a) is in orbit around the Sun, (b) has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape, and (c) has cleared the neighbourhood around its orbit."      As a result of the new criteria set forth, Pluto no longer qualified as a planet. It has now been classified as a "Dwarf Planet". As due to the fact it shares it's orbital neighborhood with scores of trans-neptunian or "kuniper belt" objects, it has not sufficiently cleared it's neihborhood.    Other Dwarf planets include: Ceres, Pluto, Haumea, Eris and Makemake.|`|M5k4EZnMaa	i was taught there are nine.    but apparently pluto isnt one    damn scientists    they shouldnt have decided its a planet then decided it isnt one, i see no reasoning - its either one or the other - stupid conflict|`|qfUnwHyFaa	there are 8 main planets   Pluto is being considered a dwarf planet   along with 2 others in the asteroid belt.|`|nYgUfUd7aa	No, the eggheads simply came up with a definition of what a planet is to them and the media picked up on it...|`|sTmG8uqRaa	Some people said if objects like pluto counted as planets many other objects in the solar system would, they decided to stick with the 9 i think so it didnt get complicated|`|PX8ouaC4aa	Taken directly from the International Astronomical Union:  Q: In plain language, what is the new definition of planet?  A: A planet is an object in orbit around the Sun that is large enough (massive enough) to have its self-gravity pull itself into a round (or nearly round) shape. In addition a planet orbits in a clear path around the Sun  there are no other bodies in its path that it must sweep up as it goes around the Sun.    Q: Why is there a need for a new definition for the word planet?  A: Modern science provides much more knowledge than the simple fact that objects orbiting the Sun appear to move with respect to the background of fixed stars. For example, recent new discoveries have been made of objects in the outer regions of our Solar System that have sizes comparable to and larger than Pluto. (Noting that historically Pluto has been recognized as the ninth planet.) Thus these discoveries have rightfully called into question whether or not they should be considered as new planets.    Q: Why is Pluto now called a dwarf planet?  A: Pluto now falls into the dwarf planet category on account of its size and the fact that it resides within a zone of other objects, known as the Kuiper Belt.|`|ZWzf4mv7aa	they are now classifying Pluto as a Trans-Neptunian object|`|79529314dfb5ac7be366558924c3393baa	You seem to be misinformed.

So here, you can pretend that the sphere is antigravity, which means you will have a radial force directed outward in the amount of F = g r/R and with respect to the plate, you will have a force directed to the center of the plate in the amount of F = 3g x/R, where     R = Radius of Cavity  r = radial distance from cavity center  x = distance from center of plate.    You will note that x = r sin  where  is the angle the x-wing is above the centerline when viewed from the cavity center.  So you can break down the forces as follows:    F.hor = g cos r/R  F.vert = 2g sin r/R  ..... Note: it is only 2g because there will be a 1g sin r/R psuedo force upwards from the missing cavity mass.  http://i278.photobucket.com/albums/kk114...

nbChnDIBaa	A person's aura, is an internal or psychological feeling.  It is not externally visible.  As an example, aura's are often felt or experienced by a person, prior to an epileptic episode, seizure or psychological premonition.    Many psychics try to read people's aura by convincing them that they have one.  Since there isn't any device to legitimize an "aura's" presence, it is often sellable as an unexplained power.    However, a persons body does conduct and generate electricity.  So with the right equipment, a bluish, spark-like profile can be seen, tracing our bodies.

jSPj3S6faa	The important thing to remember is that infinity is not a number; it is a concept.    Infinite means "without end".  "in"= without or lacking.  "fine"= end, finish.    Technically a thing is not truly infinite if it has a beginning, for then it has an "end", its beginning.  However, there is often talk about something which begins and then lasts until infinity.  Then again, there is nothing in science that supports such an idea.    Quantum loop gravity theory does espouse a particular facet of infinity, that matter that constitutes the universe has always existed and will always exist.  This same theory goes beyond before the Big Bang and states that the matter which is our universe now existed before the Big Bang as a universe that was undergoing Universal Contraction, as opposed to Universal Expansion which we experience now.    Another definition or understanding of infinite is that something as simple a baseball cover can be considered infinite; specifically without end.  If you were an ant crawling on the surface of a baseball, you would never encounter the end of the surface.  Eventually it might dawn on you that you've been some place on the ball as before; but it certainly would be difficult to understand how it could be that you could end up where you started without turning around.    As stated at the beginning of this answer, infinity is not a number; therefore one cannot calculate with it.  I say this even though "infinity" is mentioned several times in relation to mathematics.  However, it is never properly utilized as a number; for it does not follow the laws that all numbers (counting, whole, real, positive, negative, irrational, and even imaginary numbers) do follow.    And since you are asking this in Astronomy & Space, a common question is whether our universe is infinite.  The answer is: even though the universe is very large and even though one cannot reach its end (making it technically infinite), our universe is finite.    On the other hand, the super-universe in which our universe exists is literally infinite.|`|IA5SuFkdaa	i dont think it does...|`|repO76qoaa	Chuck Norris counted to infinity.

It's no more philosophical than the number pi or e or 0 or 1.    The answers that say it doesn't exist are by people who are blathering fools.    The answers regarding it's "uncalculable" or "defies all calculation" are sorta right, but still wrong.    It is knowable, it just can't be represented by numbers.  Defies calculation, well that's actually a better definition.  It only defies arithemtic because you don't understand it.  It has mathematical properties:    0 times infinity equals 1.    So as long as you use this and a host of other properties, it does behave in the arithmetic.      But many people are correct, there is no simple formula (ie. one which doesn't involve infinity itself) to calculate it.

Hw5xFK0qaa	As written, AlCl3.6H2O might reasonably be called aluminium chloride hexahydrate or aluminium chloride-6-water, and thus described as a hydrated salt. However, this is a quite misleading naming.  As your diagram suggests, plain AlCl3 (aluminium chloride) is a trigonal planar molecular substance, and it is non-polar.    AlCl3.6H2O is actually [Al(OH2)6]Cl3 - hexaquaaluminium(III) chloride.  In the solid state, it consists of octahedral [Al(OH2)6]^3+ cations and Cl^- anions present in a 1 : 3 ratio.  Similarly in solution, the ions dissociate and you have octahedral [Al(OH2)6]^3+ cations and Cl^- anions.  The [Al(OH2)6]^3+ cations are formed with coordinate covalent bonds between the oxygen atom of each bound water molecule and the aluminium atom.  These cations are actually weak acids (in a Lowry-Bronsted sense), reacting with water according to the equation:    [Al(OH2)6]^3+(aq) ? + ? H2O(l) ?  ? [Al(OH2)5(OH)]^2+(aq) ? + ? H3O^+(aq)    [Al(OH2)6]Cl3 is an ionic substance, so terms like 'polar' don't really apply.

DXXpHKupaa	Yes, it is something.    By matter that we have a term for it, it is something-a concept.    There is no number 1, there is no color red.  These are concepts as well.  Why then, do we have a number 1 and color red?      We have them to represent an idea.    There were 7 Bears in the forest-specifically refers to a number of bears.    There were Bears in the forest-this could mean anywhere from 2 to any number after it.  Were there a thousand bears in the forest?  It's impossible to know from this statement alone-but at least the statement is true and can be verified.    This is why "7" is necessary.    Now let's try this-    There were 7 in the forest-7 what?  7 lumberjacks?  Eagles?  Deer?  The statementt cannot be verified, because since only a concept is present, we have nothing to attach it to, and hence, nothing to prove.    Whereas the word "bear" represents an actual physical entity, that you can touch (I recommend you don't)-"7" represents a concept that exists only in your mind.  The term Bears can exist on it's own, but 7 cannot.  As a number (concept) it must be attached to something to give it meaning in the real world.    If your friend walks up to you and says "There were 7 in the forest" without any context as to what he was referring to, you should probably find new friends.    So what do 7 and a pure vacuum have in common?    How and where to they exist?    They exist as concepts alone.

8bac1627976c8fad956d758dcd324aa7aa	Mass causes gravity. Gravity pulls on mass. Weight is the measure of gravitational pull on mass.    w = m * a    Weight equals mass times the acceleration due to gravity.|`|oD2oRzBmaa	Mass is a measure of an amount of matter in an object. Weight is the force resulting from the pull of the earth (or any other planet) on a particular object's matter and is directly proportional to mass. Weight can vary, but the mass of an object is fixed (so long as the object is unmodified or unchanged).|`|eq8cGUbBaa	In the physical sciences, weight is a measurement of the gravitational force acting on an object.[1] Near the surface of the Earth, the acceleration due to gravity is approximately constant; this means that an object's weight is roughly proportional to its mass.           Mass versus weight  the same as mass as that term is used in physics. In modern scientific usage, however, weight and mass are fundamentally different quantities: mass is an intrinsic property of matter, whereas weight is a force that results from the action of gravity on matter: it measures how strongly gravity pulls on that matter.    However, the recognition of this difference is, historically, and contemporarily, a relatively recent development and in many everyday situations the word "weight" continues to be used when "mass" is meant. For example, most people would say that an object "weighs one kilogram", even though the kilogram is a unit of mass.    The distinction between mass and weight is unimportant for many practical purposes because the strength of gravity is very similar everywhere on the surface of the Earth. In such a constant gravitational field, the gravitational force exerted on an object (its weight) is directly proportional to its mass. For example, object A weighs 10 times as much as object B, so therefore the mass of object A is 10 times greater than that of object B. This means that an object's mass can be measured indirectly by its weight (for conversion formulas see below).    Nevertheless, the Earth's gravitational field can vary by as much as 0.5% at different locations on Earth (see Earth's gravity). These variations alter the relationship between weight and mass, and must be taken into account in high precision weight measurements that are intended to indirectly measure mass. To eliminate this variation, when the weight of objects is used in commerce, the value given is what the objects would weigh at a nominal standard gravitational acceleration of 9.80665 m/s2 (approx. 32.174 ft/s2) Spring scales, which measure local weight, must be calibrated at the location at which the objects will be used to show this standard weight, to be legal for commerce.    The use of "weight" for "mass" also persists in some scientific terminology  for example, in the chemical terms "atomic weight", "molecular weight", and "formula weight", can still be found rather than the preferred "atomic mass" etc.    The difference between mass and force may be important when:    objects are compared in different gravitational fields, such as away from the Earth's surface. For example, on the surface of the Moon, gravity is only about one-sixth as strong as on the surface of the Earth. A one-kilogram mass is still a one-kilogram mass (as mass is an intrinsic property of the object) but the downward force due to gravity is only one-sixth of what the object would experience on Earth.   locating the center of gravity of an object (although if the gravitation field is uniform, the center of gravity will coincide with the center of mass).   an object is submersed in a fluid (for instance, a brick weighs less when placed in water, and helium balloon in the atmosphere appears to have negative weight).       Systems of units of weight (force) and mass have a tangled history, partly because the distinction was not properly understood when many of the units first came into use.    Three approaches to mass and force units System Gravitational Engineering Absolute   Force (F) F = ma F = ma/gc = wa/g F = ma   Weight (w) w = mg w = mg/gc  m w = mg      Units English Metric English Metric English Metric   Acceleration (a) ft/s2 m/s2 ft/s2 m/s2 ft/s2 m/s2   Mass (m) slug hyl pound-mass kilogram pound kilogram   Force (F) pound kilopond pound-force kilopond poundal newton|`|a7a7d61d2304fa70769870fad1171da0aa	First, we need to know what mass is and what the force of gravity is.  Mass is formed of electromagnetic energy.  This energy is formed into electrons, which mass is formed into protons and neutrons.  When a person considers an entity as mass, that which they consider as being in any manner separate from energy is incorrect.  As we know, mass is composed of energy - m = e/c2.  This form of energy is able to be described as E = hf, or that of electromagnetic energy.  This concept is described in the physics trilogy: m = e/c2, e = mc2, and c2 = e/m.      When a high frequency electromagnetic wave enters near the center of an atom, it converts into an electron pair.  The positive one disintegrates back into radiation (gamma) and is no longer a mass.  All matter is formed of this electromagnetic energy, which means that there exists no such entity as "solid" mass.  Everything is composed of individual wave frequencies.    The second aspect of this question has to do with that of gravitational waves and their origin.  This is answered in the third part of the foregoing physics trilogy, c^2 = e/m.  What this equation is describing is a relationship between energy and mass, and that as the energy factor increases so does the "c2" one.   Were no form of energy to exist, then there would be no "c2" value.  Were this to be evidenced within our planet in such manner that there were no heat energy within its mass, then our planet would have no gravitational field.  Were this form of energy to increase, then the field of gravity would also increase.  Notice that the force of gravity attracts the heat energy of our planet (a specific form of frequency contained within a mass) toward the center of our planet as well as the mass.  This acts to condense the heat of our planet toward its core, and keeps our planet from becoming almost the same temperature throughout.    Now for the relationship between mass and gravity.  When our planet emits gravitons it is emiting a particular form of energy that moves at the speed of light.  Gravitons are composed of two individual constants (values that do not change).  One is that of distance per second, (186,000) and the other is energy per second (6.626196 -34 Joules/sec).  The first describes physical time as being a particular duration and the second of a particular energy (h).  These values always exist together.  It may be said that c = h, or it may be said that h = c; these two values exist as being seperate constants, but they are the same one expressed differently, the value of c = h being the basis of all mass and energy in physical creation.    When a graviton (c = h) moves through space, this value being the smallest unit of all forms of energy, accelerates all other electromagnetic frequencies not moving in its immediate direction toward moving in the direction form which it (the graviton and come).  These small bits of energy do this by adding minute amounts of frequency in form of (e=hf).  The only value not attracted by (c=h) is that of other values.    There is a video at http://youtube.com   entitled "Gravity engine 1 and 2" by Stcorridon   that may be of assistance.|`|LFYr9iH0aa	The weight of an object is the gravitational force exerted on the object by the mass of the Earth.    What this means is that all objects have mass. The gravity of Earth pulls on the mass and we call that weight.    So an item with a 1 kg mass on Earth would be 9.8 Newtons Weight.  The 1kg mass item on the Moon would be 1.6 Newtons Weight.  On Jupiter, this 1kg would weigh 253.8 Newtons.    So the stronger the gravity, the mass of an object will weigh more.|`|JfQsY6jyaa	w =m.g  where m=mass            g=acceleration of gravity(=9.8m/s^2)|`|wDMWkYUcaa	weight = mass x acceleration due to gravity  W = mg    g depends on the planet  on Earth, g = 9.8 N/kg, which is equivalent to 9.8 m/s2

FY4cCjsOaa	The first thing to notice is that  f(x) = 4(8^x) = 4[(2^3)^x] = 4[2^(3x)]  and  g(x) = 4^x = (2^2)^x = 2^(2x)  Putting both functions in terms of powers of 2 will help.    First question:  f(x) = h(g(x))  4[2^(3x)] = h(2^(2x))  4[2^(2x*3/2)] = h(2^(2x))  4{[2^(2x)]^(3/2)} = h(2^(2x))  so h(x) = 4[x^(3/2)]    Second question:  f(x) = g(j(x))  4[2^(3x)] = 2^[2j(x)]  2^2 * [2^(3x)] = 2^[2j(x)]  2^(3x+2) = 2^[2j(x)]  3x+2 = 2j(x)  so j(x) = (3x+2)/2

wDMWkYUcaa	(yf - yi) = voy t - ?gt2    This tells you the change in position of the projectile. 2250 m is the height difference between the bottom and the top of the cliff. Since the yi, the initial height, is not the maximum height, you don't have to worry about subtracting the amount it went up. The ball rises to a maximum height, falls down the same distance until it reaches its launch height. Here, its vertical velocity is -200 m/s. From this point, the projectile falls a distance equal to the height of the cliff.|`|t9iWZmmQaa	The time to maximum height can be found from:  v = u + at  where v is final speed (at max. height) i.e. 0  u is initial speed = 200m/s  acceleration a = -g  t = (v - u)/a = (0 - 200)/-9.81 = 20.4 s  Time to return to starting point = 40.8 s.

That means that if an offspring inherits one allele for A and another for B, neither A or B will be dominant or recessive and both traits will appear. The offspring will have type AB blood.    However, both A&B are dominant over type O. Therefore, a person with type A blood could have the genotype of either homozygous dominant (AA - both alleles are the same and are dominant) or heterozygous (mixed alleles, one dominant, one recessive or AO).    The same is true of a person with type B blood. Their genotype could be either BB or BO.     Therefore, since the "O" allele is recessive to both A&B alleles, to have type O blood, a person must be homozygous recessive (OO -- both alleles are recessive). Any other heterozygous genotype (AO, BO, or AB) would result in a phenotype of A, B or AB.    Rh factor ( + or -) is another allele. Positive is dominant over negative. So, if either parent is homozygous +, offspring will always be positive no matter what their blood type is. If both parents are heterozygous (+ & - alleles) then one out of four should be negative no matter what their blood types are. If one parent is heterozygous and the other is homozygous negative, then two out of four children should be Rh positive and two should be Rh negative no matter what their blood types are.     Answer to your questions:    1).if father have homozygous genotype: AA  If mother have homozygous genotype:BB     Cross between these two gives:All four child have AB blood group.    if father have heterozygous genotype:AO  If mother have heterozygous genotype:BO    cross between these two gives:AB,AO,BO,OO(AB blood group,A blood group,B blood group,and O blood group).    About Rh Factor:   Father have homozygous genotype" - - "  Mother may have heterozygous or homozygous genotype "+ -" and "++" respectively.     Cross between ++ and -- gives all Rh + blood groups.    Cross between + - and -- gives both + and - Rh factors.    2).Father blood group is O and mother blood group is B+,then they don't have A child.

This is easily shown to be true (blindfold, testing whether or not a spirit can see something you can't, well-studied psychological effect).|`|FBodo7yPaa	Scientifically, the Ouija board is a piece of wood. It is probably an authentic piece of wood. In terms of science, though, there is no evidence that it can do anything more than any other piece of wood can do. All they do to it when they manufacture it is cut it, sand it and paint it, so there's no scientific reason for it to be any different from another cut, sanded and painted piece of wood. Sorry.

I may be wrong because this might not be what you were looking for but this may help.  Each letter stands for a word, and you should work out your answer in this order!  B = brackets  I = indices  D = division  M = multiplication  A = addition  S = subtraction    so you do the brackets first...and so on.  So..  23 x 42 = 966  4 - 2 = 2    now we have  6 - 4 x 966 x 2    there are no indices, and next is division. there is also no division. next is multiplication!  so 4 x 966 x 2 = 7728  then addition, which there isnt any!  then subtraction.  so 6 - 7728 = -7722  it may not be the same as that you are doing but i would get the answer at -7722.    :) hope this makes it a bit clearer! :) x

dW5bycMTaa	This one is easy, since x = 5 is a vertical line.  The line perpendicular to a vertical line is a horizontal line.  The horizontal line passing through (2,-1) is y = -1    This is a special case, since the slope of a vertical line is undefined.    Normally (when we don't have horizontal and vertical lines to work with), the slope of a line is the negative of the reciprocal of the slope of any line perpendicular to it.    i.e. If the slope of Line L1 is s, then the slope of line P1, which is perpendicular to L1, is - (1/s)|`|bTHhpGanaa	x=5 is a vertical line  y=-1 is a hor line passing through (2,-1)
CCeRdaoLaa	The short answer is because the evidence just isn't there.  Instead of being good scientists and following the evidence, they choose to take the bad science (pseudoscience) route and make up "facts" and distort the truth to support the conclusion that they arrived at before they even began their research.      Behe is one of the few creative ones (the vast majority simply parrot previously debunked arguments)... he takes actual scientific concepts and twists them slightly, but still leaves out important details.  He's right on one level, that an irreducibly complex structure would be evidence against evolution... but he's also profoundly wrong in that we have never found an irreducibly complex structure.  His examples have all been arguments from ignorance - we don't know how structure X evolved, so therefore it couldn't have evolved.  Yet, with further research, we've found every one of his examples to be reducible.  He jumps to the conclusion that supports his viewpoint before the research is finished - and that's very bad science.    The ID point is based on misunderstood or misrepresented data, logical fallacies, and outright dishonesty.  For example, there's a tactic called the "Gish Gallop," named after one of the big ID/Creation proponents.  He'd get up on stage to debate a scientist, and as soon as the scientist would begin to make a counter-argument, Gish would jump in and switch topics.  By presenting such a fast moving target, he would prevent any shred of intelligent discourse... but he'd also make it impossible for the scientists to address any one point, making it look like Gish had won the argument.    The evolution stance is "the evidence has led us to this conclusion."  The ID stance is "if we repeat the same stuff over and over, we'll trick people into accepting it, and that will make it true."|`|AA11058044	Because whenever someone actually examines one of their examples of "irreducible complexity", it's been found to be quite reducible.
8RrNrjFPaa	it is separated into different periods of elements, meaning each column is a period.|`|X8LNbaKQaa	You read across the table , moving one column to the right for each proton the nucleus gains.  When you get to the end of a row, you drop one row and repeat the process.  The general properties of the atoms are somewhat similar in neighbors that fall in the same column.  This means that as you add protons, the same properties keep repeating, periodically, with the period being the number of columns in the table.  In fact, it was a study of this repeating pattern of properties that first lead to the sorting atomic mass in this particular organization.    Wondering why this repeating pattern happens lead to a much deeper understanding of how the electrons associated with those protons are located around the nuclei of atoms.   Hint.  They do not all just swarm around in a cloud, each indistinguishable from another.    --   Regards,

For example we get heat from sun or any burning object without being in actual contact with it.  Conduction takes place in solids where the transfer of energy takes place when an initially heated molecule starts vibrating and passes on the energy to  the next particle when passes on the energy to the next molecule.  Convection takes place in fluids (liquids & gases) where when they are initially heated at the bottom the heated particles go up where it is comparatively cooler than the heated bottom and the heated particles are replaced by the cold particles.

DU8zxsKRaa	If fractions are equivalent, they'll pass the cross multiplication test.    This means if the take the numerator of one fraction times the denominator of the second, it will equal the numerator of the second times the denominator of the first (this check makes an "X" pattern over the equals sign:    a/b = x/y  ay = bx      So for  2 and  3,  2 is found not to be equivalent and  3 is found to be eqivalent with this test:    4/10 = 11/10  40 = 110  FALSE    5/35 = 2/14  70 = 70  TRUE    For  1, this knowledge can be used to create an equation that can be solved algebriacly.

Whatever is your whole number answer is the whole number part of the mixed number, the remainder is the numerator of the fraction part, and the dividend is the denominator:    16/3 = 5 R 3 = 5 1/3      And for  6, working backwards, you multiply the denominator by the whole number, then add the numerator to get your improper fraction:    6 1/5 = (6 * 5 + 1) / 5 = 31/5|`|sS352szAaa	1.  2 / 9  (2 / 9) * (2 / 2) = 4 / 18  (2 / 9) * (4 / 4) = 8 / 36      2.  4/10 != 11/10      3.  5/35 = 1/7  2/14 = 1/7    5/35 = 2/14      4.  16/3 = (3 * 5 + 1) / 3 = 5 1/3      6.  6 1/5 = (6 * 5 + 1) / 5 = 31/5|`|YELasZJOaa	Use a calculator for 1 and 6.

Now do the same for the second one 2 / 2 = 1; 14 / 2 = 7; therefore it is also 1/7.    4: If I remember correctly for a mixed number you say how many times the denominator goes into the numerator which is 5 and you have a fraction left over which is 1 / 3 therefore your answer is 5 1/3    6: Well I'm not sure about this one if I was correct in the previous one i think the answer would be 31 / 5 and since 31 is a prime number it cannot be simplified|`|lseXWdgLaa	1. 2/9  to get denominators of 18 and 36...    for 18:  you ask now how can you make the denominator 18?  well.. 9*2=18 so...  you multiply 2/9 by 2/2  2/2 is equal to 1 so that wouldn't change the value of 2/9  so.. multiplying the top and bottom by 2 we get  2/9=4/18    for 36:  you ask yourself how can I make the denominator 36?  9*4=36  so you multiply 2/9 by 4/4  meaning multiply the numerator and denominator by 4  so..  2/9=8/36    2. 4/10 and 11/10  these fractions are not equivalent, the denominator is the same so you can directly compare the two numerators is 4 = 10? nope!  so 4/10 and 11/10 are not equivalent  to further prove this you can draw a picture and shade in 4/10 and 11/10 and compare    3. 5/35 and 2/14  to compare these fractions to see if they are equivalent you need to have the same denominators  so when you think about it 35 and 14 have a common multiple of 70  so to get the two fractions ready for comparison  we take 5/35 and multiply the numerator and the denominator by 2  you get 5/35=10/70  and we take 2/14 and multiply the numerator and the denominator by 5   and you get 2/14=10/70  then we see 10/70 is equal to 10/70!  so the two fractions are indeed equivalent    4. 16/3   to change this improper fraction into a mixed number...  think about how many times 3 can go into 16  we know that 3*5=15 so 3 can go into 16 5 times  so we have 5 wholes  however 5 wholes only equal 15   so we do 16-15=1 and that 1 is over 3  so the answer is 5 1/3    6. 6 1/5  to change this mixed number into an improper fraction you take the whole number, which is 6 and multiply it by the denominator, which is 5  so 6*5=30  take that number and add it to 1  30+1=31  and the improper fraction will be 31/5|`|cavnnvQ5aa	get a calculator...
CYtMRC4eaa	Peppered moths (Biston betularia) did not change the way they looked.  Nature "selected" the dark moths because they blended-in better with the darker tree trunks, and yes, the white ones became easier prey for birds because they were easier to see. The black ones survived to reproduce.|`|anGiS8nDaa	I dont think they changed, the only thing that happened was pollution which made everything darker, hence made the peppered moths being the ones that were hidden now and not the lighter colored ones. From there the lighter ones just died off.|`|Heonb5DDaa	That's exactly what happened. That is how evolution works.  The favorable characteristics of an organism is passed on to its offspring.  The organism that is most fit for an environment will survive.  Pollution changed the color of the trees and lichens that the light color moths used to camouflage themselves on.  Therefore, the light colored were all eaten and the dark colored moths were not.  But when the trees were light the dark colored moths were the ones that were eaten.  When the trees darkened the light moths became dinner.  So you see the trait for dark and light was present in every generation of moth, however depending on the circumstances of the environment dictated which trait was fit for the environment.  Classic evolution.  So they did physically or intentionally "change" their look, the conditions of the environment allowed for the best fit organisms to survive, light or dark.

IUmAflSqaa	No.  Consider the torus, realized as C/Z[i], and take any geodesic which is the image of a line of the form x = ay (i.e. the points z which are real multiples of the point a+i), where a is a real irrational.  The resulting geodesic is dense in the torus, but it can't be the whole thing, since it misses any point a+bi, a and b rational but not both integers.    I don't, however, know if this is a Riemann symmetric space.  However, if the Riemann sphere is, I'm pretty sure you can do a similar (more complicated) thing with this--realize it as the compactification of a quotient of the upper half plane by SL(2,Z), and take an appropriately chosen geodesic whose image is dense.
ZuLkS2graa	The most foolproof method for a general linear problem such as this is to formulate the system as a matrix equation.  You then have to find the inverse of the matrix in order to calculate the solution vector - Gaussian elimination is easiest.

The last one I can think of off the top of my head is resonance.     Just a note, the stress distribution will not be a very good indicator of life. Peak stresses and stress gradiant are better. For example, if you have a high stress zone, where the stress suddenly drops off away from that zone, thats where you are probably going to see fatigue.

2lQ8DJAcaa	Red wolves weigh between 42 to 84 pounds. The average adult female red wolf weighs 52 pounds, and the average adult male weighs 61 pounds. Adult red wolves stand about 26 inches at the shoulder and are about 4.5 feet long from the tip of the nose to the end of the tail.    Red wolves are mostly brown and buff colored with some black along their backs; there is sometimes a reddish color behind their ears, on their muzzle, and toward the backs of their legs.    A typical red wolf pack consists of five to eight animals--an alpha or breeding adult pair and offspring of different years. The alpha wolves are usually the only breeders in the pack; wolves breed once a year.    After a gestation period of 60 - 63 days, a litter of 4 - 7 cubs are born in a den. red wolf pups weigh less than a pound at birth.     Red wolves in the wild have an average life span of 8 to 9 years, but have been known to live up to 12 years in the wild and 16 years in captivity. Mortality rates for wolf pups can be as high as 50%

In the case of Cr2O3, Oxygen had 3 atoms. Oxygen always has a 2- charge so the total negative charge is 6-. That means that Cr has to be 6+. Since there are 2 Cr atoms the charge must be 3+. Therefore the name is Chromium(111)Oxide. Molar mass is you just add up the mass of total number of each type of atom involved.    b. Same rules apply with polyatomic ions between metals and non-metals as is this case. NO3 is Nitrate x 2 with a charge of 1- for a total of a 2- charge. Therefore, the cation is Cu with a 2+ charge making the the compound Cu(11)Nitrate|`|AA11524578	a) Chromium (III) oxide  MW =  2*52 + 3*16 = 152 g/mol  b) Copper (II) nitrate  MW = 63.5 + 2*14 + 6*16 = 187.5 g/mol

Auy58DUtaa	Can't be certain, but as a river rounds a bend, it travels faster on the inside of the bend than the outside, and thus the inside erodes faster and is probably termed the lower bank. The bank which is the outside of the bend travels slower and erodes less, so I suppose it is the upper bank.     Dams stop water from flowing and therefore trap water which floods the area above the dam. If a dam bursts or breaks, releases all of the trapped water and will probably cause a flood downstream of the dam.
Heonb5DDaa	Lipases.  Fats are usually broken down in the digestive system|`|X4EBNoNUaa	The lipases such as pancreatic lipase ,  hormone sensitive lipase and lipoprotein lipase do break down triglycerides into fatty acids and either monglycerides ( like pancreatic lipase ) or glycerol and 3 fatty  acids like HSL and LPL do. The fatty acids are transported to the mitochondrion of energy demanding cells and at the surface of the mitochondrion are converted to fatty acyl CoAs.These are then transported into the mitochondrion ( with or without the carnitine shuttle depending on chain length ) then they are degraded by the enzymes of beta oxidation in the matrix of the mitochondrion. They are degraded to acetyl CoAs which enter the Krebs' Cycle and during the oxidation NADHs and FADH2 are made that enter the ETS directly.The burning of a fatty acid of chain length N ( even number ) will result in 8.5 N - 7 ATPs of energy|`|lkNJNnlSaa	Fats are broken down in the Gut (small intestines) by an enzymes called Lipases which are produced by the pancreas.|`|MAAxboH7aa	At the pancreas, it is the lipase enzyme.

De4vgWXPaa	While brain size is related to intelligence to some extent, it certainly isn't the whole story.  There are also details such as available area.  That can be increased by crinkling the surface.  And then there are matters of organisation and efficiency that have little to do with size.    When it comes to humans, the average male brain is a bit larger than the average female one.  However, that has everything to do with proportional body size, and nothing to do with intelligence.  As for "the first homosapiens" you mention, I don't actually know what you're referring to.  The earliest remains of /Homo sapiens/ I've heard of are something like 150,000 years old.  As far as is known, they don't have a smaller skull capactiy and were as smart as present day humans.  However, remains of that age are very sparse.    Should you be referring to earlier humans, such as /H. erectus/, then they had a smaller brain capacity and presumably weren't as clever as what I is.|`|IDZTtipeaa	Brain size of current humans compared to other current humans is not a major factor in determining intelligence.

When presenting findings, a geologists likes to refer to terms in the Wentworth Scale since phi size is somewhat confusing.

3ZPYB7nxaa	The best known effect of pesticides on wildlife was what DDT was doing to predatory birds like hawks and eagles. These birds were at the top of the food chain, meaning they ate other creatures which in turn preyed on simple forms of life such as aquatic crustaceans. The pesticide ran off fields and entered the rivers and lakes. Aquatic crustaceans became contaminated, which in turn contaminated higher organisms. Every link in the food chain then concentrated the level of pesticide and the predatory birds received the largest exposure.     The effect of this was that the egg shells of these birds were thinner than normal, causing them to break. This meant far fewer birds reproduced successfully. Animals at the top of the food chain are the rarest, since they depend on so many other creatures at the bottom of the food chain. the decline in the predator population was immediate, and once linked to DDT, this pesticide was banned in the USA. However, third world countries still use it, and their produce re-enters the USA. Fortunately, DDT is not very toxic to mammals. In fact, when it was first developed after WWII, lice infested refugees were routinely doused with DDT enriched talcum powder. American GI's actually enjoyed a cocktail laced with DDT.|`|tA8T4QYFaa	Cancer, other toxicity (poisonous)|`|WVPYem5Vaa	Many pesticides work by blocking enzymes, primarily the ones regulating nerve transmission. If these get into the bodies of humans and animals, they can be affected as well. Also, many of them build up over time, meaning lethal doses can be triggered suddenly.|`|qNkdl6qjaa	pesticides can cause all sorts of problems. To begin with they can go into the water in rivers and pollute the water, poisoning fish and causing them to die or evolve in unusual ways. Also these pollutants can kill the small plants in rivers and streams which the fish and other animals in the water need to eat to survive. This also means that animals such as birds which may feed on the fish struggle to survive and can lead to a decrease in populations of some species. This water can sometimes be water we drink from, giving us upset stomachs, sickness and illness, possibly types of cancer. If certain pesticides go into water you can get algae blooms which use up the oxygen in the water to respire so fish and other animals in the water don't have enough oxygen and die. (i think this is called eutrophication) these pesticides stop 'pests' feeding on plants. This can be a problem for all the animals that feed off the insects. If for example, a type of bird feed on insects (jays feed on flies etc) and the insects are now being killed, they won't have enough food and may start to die. This will then lead to a struggle for food for their predators such as bigger birds and animals. Something so little can have a big effect on people!
Ii8h0mgkaa	Non-biodegradable is a word used to identify a product which over time nature is unable to break down into the natural components of nature itself.  It is not biodegradable because man has manipulated it in such a way to create a product that is too strong to be broken down by the organisms and natural weathering present on earth.  lastly, non-biodegradable REALLY refers to an object that does not degrade within a reasonable amount of time in comparison to the human life. Certain items may take 10 million years to degrade, so they ARE degradable just...not within a relative time span!

Auy58DUtaa	You are correct and the figures relate to magnification. However one of the critical elements of optical lens design is that a larger lens captures more light, giving a clearer image with higher contrast. Also, lenses made of several elements are needed to ensure that colour fringing and other distortions (known as aberrations) are minimised. These lenses cost more. In the worst case a microscope with a small lens may need so much light on the subject to see it properly that it will damage the specimen! If you get a chance, try before you buy!|`|UwTB8gM4aa	The cost of microscopes and cameras and binoculars is largely driven by the quality of the lenses used.  High quality lenses are expensive, very expensive.

Just because a microscope has a large magnification level does not mean it is instantly a good microscope.

However, for small angles, the restoring force IS linear:  F = mg sin (theta) = g theta    So for small angles:  theta'' = g/L theta    Which gives you simple harmonic motion with an angular frequncy:  omega = sqrt (g/L)    and a period:  T = 2pi / omega = 2pi sqrt (L/g)    You should be able to confirm this relationship in lab using a mass on a string as a pendulum.|`|D5QgyGbXaa	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooke's_law  http://www.rowan.edu/colleges/lasold/phy...  http://videolectures.net/mit801f99_lewin...
3ME7sBxjaa	You can have an infinite amount of proteins from only a few amino acids, it would be all in the way they are tied together.    If you were building proteins and could only use each amino acid once, you would have 20 factorial possibilities, thats: 20! = 20 * 19 * 18 ... * 1 = 2,432,902,008,176,640,000    That's if you could only use each amino acid once, so you can see how many possibilities there really are.|`|KtD80yv6aa	Because there are many different combinations of amino acids.    Suppose there are just 3 different types of bonds that could form between amino acids. Then you could compose 20^2*3 = 1,200 combinations of just TWO amino acids.    Suppose you wanted 10 amino acids, then you could have over 20^10*3=30720000000000 combinations, and so on.    Another illustration:    Imagine three coins, A, B, and C.

If you have three glycine units linked together, the peptide will have different properties than if, say, two glycine units and an alanine unit are linked. Even the individual positioning would give different properties.|`|3ZPYB7nxaa	In statistics, this phenomenon is called "permutations". If the protein was just 5 units long and no amino acid could be repeated, the scenario would go as following:    Choose any of 20 acids to begin. This makes 20 unique choices to start with. The second acid of these 20 initial choices could be any one of 19 other acids. Therefore, the number of unique, two acid sequences would be 20*19 = 380. As the number of acids increased, the trend would end in 20*19*18*17*16 = 1,116,288 possible combinations. Most proteins are thousands of units in length, and the units routinely repeat. Thus, one can imagine the number of possible combinations.     However, nearly all living things use exactly the same basic set of chemical reactions to generate metabolic energy. This means there is a core set of enzymes which drives this process. Each enzyme in this set is modified only slightly to work most efficiently in terms of the environment a living cell finds itself in.

KfqSAr90aa	Permutations tell you how many ways you can select m items out of n where order counts.    Combinations tell you how many ways you can select m items out of n where order does not count.    If you want to know the probability of some event occuring then you calculate the number of ways that the event can happen and divide it by the total number of ways the event either can or cannot happen.  You have to determine from the problem whether you need to use permutations or combinations.    For example, what is the probability of being dealt a straight flush in a 5 card poker game?

bUKm9h0kaa	That is correct. You plot a calibration curve using the results you got from your standards. So put the concentration of glucose present on the x axis and the value you got from your experiment (whatever it was, you don't say) on the y axis and draw a line of best fit.     Then you can measure your honey sample which will give you some result and If you find that number on the Y axis, read across to the line and down to the x axis, you know how much glucose is in it. If you do the calibration plot in excel and add a line of best fit , you can also add a eqaution to the line (so right click on the data points on the graph, and select add trendline and choose the linear one, in the options tab tick the display equation of the graph) and use that equation to calculate the value of X (glucose), for any value of ( your experimental result).    For a stratight line y=mx+(or-)c so x=y/m-(or+) c

Then, you can find 3 squares of size 2 by side (put a square of size 2 in a corner and the slide it down and you will see.) So there are 3x3 squares of size 2.  ... And so on.

2Ypig4jBaa	There is a small difference in planetary orbits from the solar system ecliptic plane.  Pluto has a wide deviation in comparison.

It's a Dwarf Planet and only 3rd on that list in size. The planet's orbits are eliptical and are within a few degress of each other as seen from Earth.|`|79529314dfb5ac7be366558924c3393baa	The eight planets in the Solar System, along with many of the moons and asteroids, all orbit fairly close to (but not exactly on) the same plane. This plane is called the 'plane of the ecliptic'. Pluto, which is not really a planet but rather a dwarf planet, has an orbit that is tilted much farther off the plane of the ecliptic than the orbits of any of the planets, although it is still less than 45 degrees off. There are a few known comets and other space rocks which orbit more than 45 degrees off the ecliptic, probably due to being gravitationally disrupted by a close encounter with a planet. In addition, the planets in other star systems do not necessarily orbit in the same direction as those in the Solar System, and although each individual star system tends to have its planets roughly in a single plane the way the Sun does, that plane is oriented more or less randomly for each different star system and doesn't really follow any universal pattern (although there may be slight overall tendencies for planets to orbit in certain ways, parallel to the plane of the galaxy for example).

SO if we kept a calendar that was constantly 365 days long, eventually all of those 1/4 day parts would add up. every 750 years, our summers and winter would be reversed!  It would snow in July and you would sunburn in January!.

A and C get equal charges.  A = q/4, B = q/2, C = q/4    As a quick check, you can add the charges.  q/4 + q/2 + q/4 = q  This is the original charge, which is what we expect from conservation of charge.

MTqimWfEaa	Do your own homework!|`|VkCrdtJkaa	In all of these textbooks, the answers are given in the section that the questions are in.  At the end of each chapter, which usually contains about 3 to 5 sections, there are summary questions that cover all of the sections in the chapter.      If you are looking for set answers, the teacher has the answers to the questions that are multiple choice.  But, the teacher does not have answers to questions that require you to write out answers, the only comment the teacher has in her/his materials is that "answers may vary."  The teacher has to evaluate the answer based on their knowledge and what was taught in class.    Please feel free to post your questions here on Yahoo Answers where you are confused by the book's materials.  Many people who answer, like myself, are teachers and can try to simplify the materials for you.  If you mention what grade you are in we can try to state the answer in a way appropriate for your age and scope for that grade level.

BBht4bGsaa	Wikipedia actually has a pretty good summary:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_o...    There's lots of stuff there, and your 3 points are more than enough to write on for 120 words.  Since there's much but you don't need much, just focus on the concepts you understand.    One of the limitations without genetic recombination is that "good" mutations or gene combinations that occur in one organism either MUST be passed on to the offspring, or they are "lost."  Genetic recombination with sex allows them to get past that, by passing on their good genes - so you can even have an overall lousy parent that has a few good genes pass on those good genes.|`|aaC2Qx1Uaa	It isn't a *necessity* as such - but it definitely speeds up evolution in slowly-reproducing diploid organisms (like us).    Being diploid means there are twice as many genes in the gene pool (as we all have two copies of each gene), and sexual reproduction allows for recombination of these genes which would not have been possible otherwise. It also means that some traits - the recessive characteristics - can be maintained in a population when they might otherwise have been selected-out; and this means they remain available for selection later-on (for example, if conditions change, and the trait suddenly becomes advantageous instead of detrimental).    (and finally - there are not more errors in DNA replication in sexually-reproducing organisms).

With a b.p. that high I'd expect an aromatic compound (and it has a characteristic smell).  Then make suitable derivatives and determine their m.pts.    [2] Obtain the NMR (and IR) spectra of the compound.    My first guess is 2-hydroxybenzaldehyde - it has a strong smell and a b.pt of 197oC.|`|45deb346668a7b66aee588c0399444f9aa	What is this the 50s?    Methods have moved on from the main way of working out what something is from its colour, boiling point and even the kind of chemistry it does! Yes these can all be useful and sometimes these tests are done, but something as complex as what you are talking about which is already an organic liquid, do an NMR!
6aJzK0hcaa	Based on the following and ignoring the effects of suddenly stopping and restarting in the opposite direction:    "Viewed from a vantage point above the north poles of both the Sun and the Earth, the Earth appears to revolve in a counterclockwise direction about the Sun. From the same vantage point both the Earth and the Sun would appear to rotate in a counterclockwise direction about their respective axes."    I believe the only difference would be that the apparent length of a full day would be cut to 12 hours. The sun and moon would appear to travel twice as fast and day and night would be half as long.     The tides would probably wreak havoc on the shorelines but weather patterns would see less drastic swings since the planet's surface would have less time to heat up (and cool down) during each rotation.    Then again this is all pretty speculative.|`|VYWaL2graa	Superman would be able to go back in time and save Lois Lane.|`|TaEf7aOYaa	then the time in each country would be reversed (i.e. night and day would be reversed)
QPWjtDzcaa	I work two jobs in the grocery industry.    They both feel like jobs.  Even though I do find them fulfilling, and it's midless work that anyone can do, I have job security because, no matter how "tough" the economy gets, humans are still going to eat.  I've been in the industry for over 15 years and am familiar with what I am doing.  But I never take my work home with me.    I've been fascinated with astronomy since I was about 7 years old.  Just by reading up on it, subscribing to astronomy related publications, going to the local planetarium, discussing astronomy with others that have an interest in it, and going to local "star parties" I've been able to gain a somewhat decent understanding of the topic.  It is a hobby that I very much enjoy, and it keeps my mind active.  I do occasionally take my hobby to work with me!  Some nights, you just have to tell your co-workers, "Hey, we can see some irridium flares tonight at 7:30, so don't take your break too early,"  or, "Venus, Jupiter and the moon are going to make a nice tight knit triangle inthe western sky tonight, let's get out of here for a minute...  don't worry, the boss always understands!"  Or whatever.    Some people think the way to success is by finding a way to get paid for doing what you already love.  I don't know if I could ever do that.  I have this innate reaction to like something less, or set higher standards for myself to do something well if I am getting paid to do it...  which (for me) can take some of the fun out of things...  of course, that could be more of my psychological make-up than anything else.|`|D5QgyGbXaa	I have no job now, was replaced by younger person.

ySjnEla9aa	OKAY  The Amazonian rainforest in brazil is one of the largest in the world, if not the largest. start of by describing some features of rainforests, i.e. lianas, epiphyates, long trunks, buttress roots, rounded crowns.  then describe nutrient cycle, how nutrients are dropped into soil through leavese falling and organisms rotting on the forest floor. how these are broken down, chemically decomposed to form humus, a layer of soil rich in nutrients, then the roots take these up, and nutrients are recycled over and over again. because you need trees in the nutrient cycle, when they are cut down, the soil becomes relatively infertile.  the amazonian rainforest has a biodiversity much larger than any where else in the world. in 1 acre you could find 500 different types of trees whereas in epping forest you would only find 2 or 3.   you can get lots of things from rainforests, raw minerals, i.e. gold, iron ore and oil, gums, resins, hardwood, charcoal etc.   tribes such as amerindians cut down the rainforest in small proportions, and can use it for 2 to 3 years, as they use the ash, from burning the trees, as a fertilizer. because you need trees to keep the ground fertile, the ground becomes relatively infertile. they must move someplace else to grow food.this is sustainable use of a rainforest  however recently, they are being forced into smaller spaces of the rainforest, and have to use land that has not yet settled, meaning they can't get much crop growth because the land is not fertile, because the government are cutting down areas the size of Wales each year to relieve the immense crowding of people on the east coast of brazil. the tribes have to go and live in shanty urban towns, as the brazilians spread diseases which they can't cope with.   brazil exploit the rainforest for many reasons: economic, to engage in trade with other countries/ pay off debts/ are leading exporters of soybeans and beef/ to become MEDC.  political, because has been law since 1960 to march to the west and to take the idea of poverty of people's minds.  social: poor people on the east coast will finally own some land and will hopefully be able to make some money out of it.    also try searching Manaus, Porto Velho and the Amazonian Highway on search engine for more info because my fingers are tired.

In general, when I have a need to do this sort of thing, this is what I do.    Take how many squares I have along the x axis. Let's say, for the sake of argument, you have 25 squares along the bottom line.    I then take the range of data - say 80-200 - and either use the difference (120) or the top value (200) . Then I divide the data range by the number of squares I have. That gives me a scale to use.    So in your case, if you had 25 boxes, and a range of 200, that would make the scale 8 units per box (8*25 = 125). I would then probably round up to 10 units per box (10*25 = 250), because that makes the math easier.    Then the first box would represent values from 0-10, the second box 11-20, and so forth.

7k6ejiXHaa	40 FACTS ABOUT SLEEP YOU PROBABLY DIDN'T KNOW...   (OR WERE TOO TIRED TO THINK ABOUT)      this should answer your question  -The record for the longest period without sleep is 18 days, 21 hours, 40 minutes during a rocking chair marathon. The record holder reported hallucinations, paranoia, blurred vision, slurred speech and memory and concentration lapses.       some additional facts:      - It's impossible to tell if someone is really awake without close medical supervision. People can take cat naps with their eyes open without even being aware of it.    - Anything less than five minutes to fall asleep at night means you're sleep deprived. The ideal is between 10 and 15 minutes, meaning you're still tired enough to sleep deeply, but not so exhausted you feel sleepy by day.     - A new baby typically results in 400-750 hours lost sleep for parents in the first year    - One of the best predictors of insomnia later in life is the development of bad habits from having sleep disturbed by young children.     - The continuous brain recordings that led to the discovery of REM (rapid eye-movement) sleep were not done until 1953, partly because the scientists involved were concerned about wasting paper.     - REM sleep occurs in bursts totalling about 2 hours a night, usually beginning about 90 minutes after falling asleep.    - Dreams, once thought to occur only during REM sleep, also occur (but to a lesser extent) in non-REM sleep phases. It's possible there may not be a single moment of our sleep when we are actually dreamless.    - REM dreams are characterised by bizarre plots, but non-REM dreams are repetitive and thought-like, with little imagery - obsessively returning to a suspicion you left your mobile phone somewhere, for example.    - Certain types of eye movements during REM sleep correspond to specific movements in dreams, suggesting at least part of the dreaming process is analagous to watching a film     - No-one knows for sure if other species dream but some do have sleep cycles similar to humans.    - Elephants sleep standing up during non-REM sleep, but lie down for REM sleep.    - Some scientists believe we dream to fix experiences in long-term memory, that is, we dream about things worth remembering. Others reckon we dream about things worth forgetting - to eliminate overlapping memories that would otherwise clog up our brains.    - Dreams may not serve any purpose at all but be merely a meaningless byproduct of two evolutionary adaptations - sleep and consciousness.    - REM sleep may help developing brains mature. Premature babies have 75 per cent REM sleep, 10 per cent more than full-term bubs. Similarly, a newborn kitten puppy rat or hampster experiences only REM sleep, while a newborn guinea pig (which is much more developed at birth) has almost no REM sleep at all.       - Scientists have not been able to explain a 1998 study showing a bright light shone on the backs of human knees can reset the brain's sleep-wake clock.     - British Ministry of Defence researchers have been able to reset soldiers' body clocks so they can go without sleep for up to 36 hrs. Tiny optical fibres embedded in special spectacles project a ring of bright white light (with a spectrum identical to a sunrise) around the edge of soldiers' retinas, fooling them into thinking they have just woken up. The system was first used on US pilots during the bombing of Kosovo.    - Seventeen hours of sustained wakefulness leads to a decrease in performance equivalent to a blood alcohol-level of 0.05%.     - The 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill off Alaska, the Challenger space shuttle disaster and the Chernobyl nuclear accident have all been attributed to human errors in which sleep-deprivation played a role.     - The NRMA estimates fatigue is involved in one in 6 fatal road accidents.     - Exposure to noise at night can suppress immune function even if the sleeper doesnt wake. Unfamiliar noise, and noise during the first and last two hours of sleep, has the greatest disruptive effect on the sleep cycle.     - The "natural alarm clock" which enables some people to wake up more or less when they want to is caused by a burst of the stress hormone adrenocorticotropin. Researchers say this reflects an unconscious anticipation of the stress of waking up.     - Some sleeping tablets, such as barbiturates suppress REM sleep, which can be harmful over a long period.     - In insomnia following bereavement, sleeping pills can disrupt grieving.     - Tiny luminous rays from a digital alarm clock can be enough to disrupt the sleep cycle even if you do not fully wake. The light turns off a "neural switch" in the brain, causing levels of a key sleep chemical to decline within minutes.     - To drop off we must cool off; body temperature and the brain's sleep-wake cycle are closely linked. That's why hot summer nights can cause a restless sleep. The blood flow mechanism that transfers core body heat to the skin works best between 18 and 30 d|`|V5xHaIAcaa	By survive, I am assuming Biological death.

This results in the relation between temperature T and time t as follows    T(t) = Ta + (T(0) - Ta)*e^-t/    where Ta is the ambient temperature  T(0) is the initial temperature and  is the time constant for the heat transfer,    Use given conditions to get the values in the formula.  For example, in 1)    Ta = 21 oC  T(0) = 95 oC  T(5) = 80 oC    So T(5) = 80 = 21 - (95 - 21)*e^-5/    From this solve for  (it comes out  = 22.07 min)    Then solve for t such that T(t) = 50 oC    T(t) = 21 - 74*e^-t/22.07    50 = 21 - 74*e^-t/22.07    29 = 74*e^-t/22.07    ln[0.392] = -t/22.07    t = -22.07*ln[0.392] = 20.7 m    Problem 2) is the same except that    Ta = 70  T(0) = 35  T(3) = 40    Solve for  and then find T(20)    the rest are similar.

Since f(x) is a quadratic and x is linear, f(x)/x will be linear. Because f(x), the numerator, increases faster than x, the denominator, g(x) is also increasing.

D5QgyGbXaa	Amount of information in the field of Astronomy doubles every decade.  It is not surprising that new discoveries lead to new theories of origin of life.  The actual occurance of the creation of life on a sterile world, leading to complex organisms, some intelligent, some not so much (us humans?) might be a really long-odds chance.

It seems like backward thinking to me.  Why look to space, where no DNA has ever been detected, to explain the origin of DNA on earth, where DNA is abundant?    It's true, we are made of "star stuff" but I don't know that this means celestial events would effect us.  Save for things like a comet / Earth collison or a Gamma Ray Burster going off anywhere in the vicinity of our solar system.  I mean, you're made of your parent's "stuff" too, but if your mom and dad got in a car wreck in another city, you wouldn't know until you got the phone call.      For a great guide to skeptical thought and critical thinking, and telling the difference between theory and wild conjecture, try Carl Sagan's "The Demon Haunted World."  Great book.    Good luck!|`|J5zj8dWRaa	The origins of life on Earth...?    If you 100% believe the Bible, God created plants, humans, and animals.  *poof*  If you 100% believe in science/evolution, everything started as one-celled organisms and grew more complex from there.  Personally, I believe in a combination of both.    I don't think any lifeforms on Earth are actually celestial visitors or anything.  However, I wouldn't be surprised if life on Earth started from cells that entered the atmosphere attached to meteors.  That would explain the presence of the same substances.    ...Eh, it's an idea.  (Good question.)|`|mLdlFhyqaa	Yet again another atheist ruse.|`|QKO4f5q0aa	"increasingly popular"?  That vague statement can mean that 10 years ago one person thought it was a good idea, and now we're up to two (which is at least the correct order of magnitude of professionals in the biological science community who believe in panspermia)    Panspermia was the brainchild of Fred Hoyle.   He proposed it in support of his ideas about the universe, namely the 'steady state' model.  These two ideas were intimately tied together in his mind, based on his belief that the universe was infinitely old, and that life on Earth could not have evolved on Earth.  Hoyle was also the father of the ridiculous 'tornado in a junkyard' analogy.  Hoyle was one of those imaginative minds that could advance science by being spectacularly wrong.      As far as I know, panspermia is a dead end... unless we bring back samples of a comet that contain DNA (not just the amino acids for it).      As far as 'celestial events profoundly impacting us'... that could mean anything from an asteroid impact (in which case I would agree with you) to astrology (in which case I would not).|`|RALliiZTaa	I've kind of thought of something similar to this theory but I also something like it has happen to other planets that may have life out there too|`|79529314dfb5ac7be366558924c3393baa	Panspermia is an intriguing theory, and I think it is certainly possible that at least some life might be carried from planet to planet in some areas of the Universe. However, based on the nature of the fossil record we see here on Earth, I suspect that life on Earth did in fact arise here, and was not carried here from space. Of course, there may be some aliens out there who are descended from off-world life forms, but in that case their fossil record would probably look somewhat different from ours.|`|T0Fns878aa	kool|`|QPWjtDzcaa	Panspermia is very limited in the sense that it fails to explain how the life got onto the earth bound celestial body.  So, as outrageously interesting as it maybe, there has been no evidence for it.  And it still does not explain the origin of life...  just how it (if it is true) might have reached earth.    It like saying, "Humans in America didn't evolve from an earlier life form, they just came here by boat or a land bridge."    Even if you prove the boat existed, you haven't gained any knowledge about how the ancestors "came to be" at all.|`|OikNR8Ufaa	I've always thought we are not alone and that life on this planet probably came from space, like a rock with bacteria on it landing on Earth and then evolving into, well, US! :) It's all pretty awesome stuff, I look forward to the day when they find life elsewhere in the universe :)

XGw7pu4Raa	Humans and other primates are descended from arboreal ancestors and this has a huge impact on all of their senses, including the sense of smell.  Odors are trace chemical compounds that travel through the air.  The usefulness of the sense of smell is to be able to identify the odor (chemical) and know where it comes from.  Living above the ground level makes it harder to detect the direction that odors come from because obstacles such as trees can affect the movement of the air that is carrying the chemicals.  If you don't know where a smell is coming from it doesn't help you.  Humans still can smell things close up to them and so the other 60% of the genes are necessary to identify these smells.  This allows us (and our ancestors) to find tasty food and prevents us from eating spoiled food or other nastiness.    Another example of adaptations for life in the trees is related to the human eye.  Our eyes are positioned in the front of our faces rather than on the side like cows.  If you need to move quickly through tree branches it helps to see what is coming.    Finally, once a gene is inactivated through mutation it is extremely rare for it to become active again.  This is why, despite having genes for gills, no mammal has re-activated those genes even though it would be very helpful for whales and dolphins.|`|aXSjRwEVaa	I would assume that mice rely more on their sense of smell to survive.

They are caused by dust, pollen, moisture or other small floating particles being present in front of the lens and reflecting back the flash into the lens.

Force would be the increase in weight (20lbs). Mass would be how much you weigh (150lbs). Solve for acceleration.  That's 20/150=0.13m/s^2 going up.    Same for going down except use 120lbs. That's a change of 30lbs.  30/150=0.20m/s^2 going down.|`|itbI3PuHaa	noswal is right, however, the question asks why it does this only on the trip up.  As the elevator accelerates quickly, the scale might read 170.  However, when the elevators speed is decreasing, yet still moving upwards, your body is still moving at the faster speed it was going a moment ago, which would drop your weight down to 120 for as long as the elevator is slowing down

AA11824362	The reason is that so much in the universe (and this includes grain sizes) is logarithmic. This is also seen in higher math since the integration of dx/x = ln x + K (where dx is the derivative of x, ln x is the natural log of x and K is a constant). Many times in graphing, data will result in useless (unreadable or not understandable) graphs till a log or natural log is applied to one axis or both axes.

z7BiMSWmaa	Primary Structure refers to the linear sequence of amino acids that make up the polypeptide chain. This sequence is determined by the genetic code, the sequence of nucleotide bases in the DNA. The bond between two amino acids is a peptide bond. This bond is formed by the removal of a H20 molecule from two different amino acids, forming a dipeptide. The sequence of amino acids determines the positioning of the different R groups relative to each other. This positioning therefore determines the way that the protein folds and the final structure of the molecule.     The secondary structure of protein molecules refers to the formation of a regular pattern of twists or kinks of the polypeptide chain. The regularity is due to hydrogen bonds forming between the atoms of the amino acid backbone of the polypeptide chain. The two most common types of secondary structure are called the alpha helix and ? pleated sheet.      Tertiary structure refers to the three dimensional globular structure formed by bending and twisting of the polypeptide chain. This process often means that the linear sequence of amino acids is folded into a compact globular structure. The folding of the polypeptide chain is stabilized by multiple weak, noncovalent interactions between the side groups of the amino acids. These interactions include:     Hydrogen bonds that form when a Hydrogen atom is shared by two other atoms.   Electrostatic interactions that occur between charged amino acid side chains. Electrostatic interactions are attractions between positive and negative sites on macromolecules.   Hydrophobic interactions: During folding of the polypeptide chain, amino acids with a polar (water soluble) side chain are often found on the surface of the molecule while amino acids with non polar (water insoluble) side chain are buried in the interior. This means that the folded protein is soluble in water or aqueous solutions.     Covalent bonds may also contribute to tertiary structure. The amino acid, cysteine, has an SH group as part of its R group and therefore, the disulfide bond (S-S ) can form with an adjacent cysteine. For example, insulin has two polypeptide chains that are joined by two disulfide bonds.    Quaternary structure refers to the fact that some proteins contain more than one polypeptide chain, adding an additional level of structural organization: the association of the polypeptide chains. Each polypeptide chain in the protein is called a subunit. The subunits can be the same polypeptide chain or different ones. For example, the enzyme ?-galactosidase is a tetramer, meaning that it is composed of four subunits, and, in this case, the subunits are identical - each polypeptide chain has the same sequence of amino acids. Hemoglobin, the oxygen carrying protein in the blood, is also a tetramer but it is composed of two polypeptide chains of one type (141 amino acids) and two of a different type (146 amino acids). In chemical shorthand, this is referred to as a2?2 . For some proteins, quaternary structure is required for full activity (function) of the protein.|`|CYtMRC4eaa	Simple answers:    Primary- sequence of amino acids    Secondary- bending of polypeptide due to shapes of amino acids    Tertiary- bending of polypeptide as a result of hydrogen bonding and sulfur cross-linkages    Quarternary- combination of one polypeptide with another in proteins that are composed of more than one polypeptide.

X4EBNoNUaa	some assays use a test like Fehling's reaction which s positive for reducing sugars.. that is the alkaline copper(II) sulfate in the reagent is REDUCED to the red copper(I) oxide . This test shows the presense of any rducing sugar, glucose , fructose, galactose, mannose, etc .    There are specific tests for glucose that use usually enzymes specific for glucose such as glucose oxidase that produces a color that shows the presense of glucose ONLY. So certainly, test results would be different in these two assays.  If one is needing to know just glucose then a specific test should be used.

They are similar enough, to our eyes, that we make that distinction, it wouldn't be feasible to have different color names for all the possible different frequencies of light.

xopIi2Vfaa	It doesn't really go without the politics, because it really depends what aspect you look at.     Once the egg is fertilized it contains the DNA to potentially be a human being. But that does not mean it will be. 30-50% of all human pregnancies will die by themselves, particularly in the first few days of the pregnancy.     Before it is born, it is not an independent human being. If the mother dies, the fetus will die too.     I think in all societies you are not a citizen of a particular state until you are born. So only with the birth societies regard a former fetus as an independent human being with its own identity.

8Y7LQ6TGaa	unless your "bag" is made of thick steel, it would be compressed by the pressure at the bottom until it was a solid mass of plastic with a tiny bit of highly compressed air in it. Since buoyancy depends on the ratio of the weight of the volume versus the weight of the same volume of water, it's buoyancy would be very low or zero.    The one near the surface would be compressed some, but would still have a large amount of buoyancy.       PS, density of water changes very little with depth, as water is very incompressible.    .

Total  $1.50/oz. sunscreen . x . 1.5 . x * 1.5 = 1.5x  $0.80/oz. sunscreen . y . 0.8 . y * 0.8 = 0.8y  Total ................... x + y . 1.01 . (x + y) * 1.01 = 1.01(x + y)    The first 2 rows of the last column always add up to the third row in that column.  1.5x + 0.8y = 1.01(x + y)    Given: Mixture is 10 ounces  Means: x + y = 10    Replace (x + y) with 10 and simplify.  1.5x + 0.8y = 1.01(x + y)  1.5x + 0.8y = 1.01(10)  1.5x + 0.8y = 10.1    You now have 2 equations.  1.5x + 0.8y = 10.1  x + y = 10    Solve the 2nd one for y.  x + y = 10  y = 10 - x    Replace y with 10 - x in the 1st one.  1.5x + 0.8y = 10.1  1.5x + 0.8(10 - x) = 10.1  1.5x + 8 - 0.8x = 10.1  1.5x - 0.8x = 10.1 - 8  0.7x = 2.1  x = 2.1 / 0.7  x = 3    Substitute x with 3 in y = 10 - x to find y.  y = 10 - x  y = 10 - 3  y = 7    You need 3 ounces of the $1.50/oz. sunscreen and 7 ounces of the $0.80/oz. sunscreen to make a 10-ounces mixture worth $1.01 per ounce.|`|iZdh54S8aa	you would need 3 of the $1.50 and 7 of the $0.80    since the total of the the ounces needed is 10, you try values whose sum is 10, for example:    (1*1.5 + 9*0.8)/10 = 8.7 WRONG  (2*1.5 + 8*0.8)/10 = 9.4  WRONG  (3*1.5 + 7*0.8)/10 = 1.01 CORRECT
InPqgS6daa	Consider an egg is released from the top of a container. As it is falling the following force(s) is acting on it:  1) Free fall due to gravity, known as g that has a value of 9.81 N. This force is actually gravitaational force that is acting downwards.  2) Air resistance that acts against the motion, i.e. upwards.    When the egg hits the container floor, the force(s) acting is:  1) contact force (with the floor of container)

PxnlByuRaa	the ABO blood system is an example of both multiple alleles and codominance. there is an allele for A and B carbohydrates, then another allele (O) that is no carbohydrate. so the combinations are AB where red blood cells have both types of carbs on them; A has only A carbs; B has only B carbs; O has neither. if someone has an A allele and O allele, theyll have A carbs on the red blood cells and be blood type A|`|4G90GebAaa	No there aren't, A and B will always make AB, unless they have an O allele.

Maybe you mean cell division, as in the whole (interphase and mitosis). It would be interphase because It has to go through G1, S, and G2 phase. Those make up about 7/8ths of the time during cell division.|`|PxnlByuRaa	interphase isnt a phase of mitosis; its a phase of the cell cycle. the cell spends 90% of its time in interphase (so if you look at an onion root tip - typical in high school bio - the majority of cells (90%) would be in interphase). the cell cycle in humans takes about 24 hours. mitosis takes less than an hour.     metaphase - longest, about 20 minutes because chromosomes are assembling on metaphase plate  anaphase - shortest, lasts only a few minutes because its just sister chromatids being dragged to opposite poles

BhumxInEaa	1. A gun is a heat engine but if the barrel is absorbing all that heat, then the expansion is NOT adiabatic.    2. As it happens, about 25% of the energy released from the burning of the propellant appears as the kinetic energy of the projectile.    3. Guns aren't made of iron but of materials such as steel. Both iron and steel are fairly poor conductors, so the idea that all metallic portions of the gun would reach the same temperature is a joke.    So the question as stated is nonsense.    Still, the desired answer is clear:    1. Determine the kinetic energy of the projectile based on its mass and velocity.    2. Use the fact that this is 1.1% of the "total" energy to determine what 98.9% of the total energy would be.    3. Using the specific heat of iron and the mass of iron, determine the temperature rise of the iron as a result of absorbing that energy.    All in all, a waste of a great example. :-(

DRVSCxKpaa	Visible light passes through our atmosphere, and only a small amount is absorbed or scattered.  When it strikes the earth or the ocean, it is partly absorbed and partly reflected.  The effect of absorption is to heat up the ground or water.  Some of this heat is then radiated as infrared radiation (all hot bodies emit infrared).    However, the infrared radiation is of longer wavelength than visible light, and the atmosphere is not as transparent to infrared as it is to visible light.  This is particularly the case with carbon dioxide; which absorbs the infrared, causing the atmosphere to be warmed up.  Hence the heat cannot escape back out of the atmosphere.    This is the 'greenhouse effect' (greenhouse glass has the same effect; allows visible light in, but traps the infrared inside the greenhouse).    The greenhouse effect itself is NOT a bad thing: life on earth would not exist without it. However, sometimes we can have too much of a good thing.|`|rcPnnfmmaa	The atmosphere is transparent to visible light. All the water vapor and carbon dioxide make the atmosphere much less transparent to infrared light. So, once the light gets in and hits something and is reradiated as infrared it has a hard time getting out.    This is called the greenhouse effect.    This is why deserts are often so cold at night. There's no water vapor in the air to trap all the heat and so at night all that energy can just whoosh off into deep space.    This is also why adding several trillion tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere is not a good idea. Carbon dioxide is very efficient at blocking infrared and we're slowly thickening the glass on our global greenhouse.
4maLlESdaa	Normal mirrors reflect light coming at them from any angle, not just perpendicular. The law of reflection says that the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection. So in your example, if you're on the west side of the mirror looking at it at a 12 degree angle, you'll see the light coming from the east that hits the mirror at a 12 degree angle. See the article below for a diagram.    If you have a laser pointer (or good flashlight and a dark room), you can experiment with this. Stand like you would in your example and shine the pointer at the mirror (disclaimer: don't look directly at the pointer or its reflection in the mirror). See where the light reflects. It probably won't be on the wall directly opposite the mirror, but rather some other wall.
SEA8CAHnaa	A number of things set them apart, the most important of which is this:  The cell membrane (I'm assuming we're talking a eukaryotic human cell) is a SINGLE lipid bilayer, whereas mitochondria have a DOUBLE lipid bilayer.  In mitochondria, the outer layer serves the same purpose as a regular membrane, whereas the inner lipid bilayer is sort of "coiled" up inside the mitochondrion in order to provide more surface area for oxidative phosphorylation to occur. Ox. Phos. is a high-ATP yeilding process which uses the potential energy of a hydrogen ion gradient to "create" ATP (the body's energy source.)    There are other differences, but this is likely the one that is being asked about.    Hope this helps! :)

wvAhCsxqaa	Your answer to the question is correct, but your reasoning is not. In order for there to be force, there has to be acceleration, which is, by definition, change in velocity divided by change in time.    how can there be change is velocity if the velocity is zero. This would suggest that the answer to the question is no.    However, consider throwing a ball in the air and then catching it.    When it reaches its highest point, its velocity is zero right? it has to be zero at some time, because it switches direction.    but, even when it is zero it is accelerating.    so you definitely can have acceleration without velocity.    We are not really accelerating though just by being on the earth. We would have to be moving to be accelerating. Relative to other stars we are accelerating all the time, but relative to the earth, the ground provides enough force to counteract the force of gravity.|`|qaMPEdL2aa	Just because you experience a force it does not mean there is acceleration.  When you push on the rock, you push against the ground, the rock pushes against the ground, and the rock pushes against you. Nothing moves.  The sum of ALL the forces is zero so the acceleration is zero.    If you throw a ball up in the air, it is constantly being accelerated downward as it goes up and as it comes down.  At the highest point, it continues to have acceleration but its velocity is zero, but just for an instant.     But there is no prolonged acceleration without velocity since acceleration is defined as the rate of change of velocity.|`|d6XAz5xXaa	Acceleration is defined as the rate of change of velocity.  Your example of accelerating because we have weight is not entirely valid because your velocity is not actually changing (relative to your surroundings) but there is a force on you.  Also, it's the unbalanced force that gives rise to acceleration - that's why the rock doesn't move, the total force acting on the rock is actually zero as friction opposes the push you give it.    However    Take, for example, a bob on the end of a pendulum.  As it reaches the top of its swing, it changes direction.  It is being accelerated by gravity, but at its turning point it has zero velocity (dv/dt is non zero but ds/dt is zero, at least instantaneously). So you are actually correct.|`|mzSvDFzlaa	Your wrong weight is not mass.  Your weight is the gravity's pull on your mass.     For acceleration to happen you need to have a mass to be moving (accelerating).    Velocity is defined as the rate of change of position from a given point.   Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity.|`|AA10008098	Velocity is a change of distance with respect to time and acceleration is a change of velocity with respect to time.  In the equation F = ma, F is an unbalanced force.  When pushing on a rock that does not move there is no unbalanced force.  When you push harder than the rock can resist it will accelerate and move.  When you are standing on the ground (motionless) there is no unbalanced force because the earth resists the force of gravity (your weight).  If you stand on thin ice and it cracks you will accelerate and fall in.  A body that is accelerating may have zero velocity only at the instant it begins to accelerate (zero to 60 MPH in 7 seconds?).    Also, motion is relative.  If you could fly around the equator at the speed the earth is revolving but in the opposite direction you would have zero velocity with respect to space but a definite velocity with respect to the equator because traveling in a circle constantly changes direction and velocity is a vector with magnitude and direction.  You must be accelerating with respect to the earth.  But then the earth orbits the sun which orbits the galaxy which is traveling through space toward or away from other galaxies.  It is always important to limit the frame of reference which is usually understood.
m7eGIGrVaa	I'm sorry that everyone else is only judging your experience and not helping you to calm down. Anyone who has ever used a ouija board, and not just the parker brothers toy version knows that they're dangerous. They've become common for us to use at slumber parties and all kinds of events and the spirits who are unhappily trapped here have recognized that and are also commonly using this as a communications tool. They want to get out, or want some kind of vengeance. Rarely will you find a kind spirit through use of a ouija board, most spirits at peace do not wish to communicate with us and the kind spirits who still linger are startled and scared by us as we are by them. The most common kind of spirit you can summon with a ouija board is one you don't want to mess with. Now whether you actually communicated with a spirit or if the two of you moved the planchette unwittingly, you'd still like to be comforted. Do something else, go somewhere to take your mind off of it. Go out to the movies and see something funny. If you need to, look up the proper ways to dispose of the board and get rid of it. Surround yourself with people, everyone panics more when they're alone. Just relax and take your mind off of it,  and don't mess with the board again.|`|kU3BDZuNaa	Forgive all these people who have Answered your question, and were not of help, although, there was a few people who were. When you were done with this spirit, you should have said goodbye, and it should have left, being as this was not done, it will be more difficult to remove. also, your friend should have kept the water nearby, but not quite in her hand.   The first thing you should do now, is have your friend, and yourself get back on the board, and ask it to leave, if it refuses, remind him that his life is over, and that his place, is where he was. Remind him, that it was the way he lived his life, that put him in the circumstance, he is in now, If it is needed, recite this quote....  "By that what has been placed in me by the almighty, I command you in the name of Jesus Christ, to return to your Place of which you have come. begone in the name of Jesus Christ." This should free you both from it's grip.        GOOD LUCK|`|6rTK303aaa	Stop watching ghost hunters or whatever, and join your local skeptics group.

I personally would sprinkle sea-salt on it as well.     but um, yeah. that's why you shouldn't play with toys like that. Holding a seance is safer than a ouija board. you might also burn some incense in the room you used it in, frankincense or frankincense and myrrh preferrably, but nag champa is good too, or patchouli I'm hearing, they have very positive energy to them, will bring in the light. And then open the windows to air things out.|`|iUM1h6Yjaa	You faked yourselves out. It's well known that the Ouija board "works" on ideomotor effect -- the participants are moving the pointer, whether they know it or not. That's why you got the answers you were afraid of getting, you made it happen. The "Freaky Guy" was a product of this and your active imaginations freaking out in the dark. A candle going out is probably due to draft or accidentally snuffing it out in the dark, and your friend's hand is sore because she was probably gripping too tightly.    Next time, use the Ouija board from Toys R Us (Hasbro). It glows in the dark, so it's more fun and less scary. They even have a pink one for girls.|`|4x8hiC1xaa	wat kind of stuff were u tlkn bout wit it?  iv played wit mine a million times n nothings eva happend 2 me yet|`|AA10631668	You like being scared.All you have to do is stop being silly.None of that happened.You know it and so do most people reading your question.|`|ZkBLNj6Vaa	I had a similar experience that creeped me out for life.  I touched a box of a ouija board at the toy store.  Then I could hear the sound of a man screaming for his life, like he was in hell or something.  I heard it in my head, and it didn't go away until I left the toy store.    So from what it sounds like, there is a guy who is in hell, and he's being used to speak to you through the board.  But the hurty part is that he's being used, and that really a demon or some other malevolent being is planning on causing more trouble if you continue to use that thing.  Because sometimes evil spirits hijack boards and use it to scare people.  Not every board, but some.    So trash the board so nobody can use it again, and the pointer.  Then make a resolution that you'll never dabble in occult again.|`|QWaspeg7aa	Just forget about it. Ouija boards are so easily faked and are hardly a proven way of contacting the other side or whatever, even if we knew for certain that it's possible to do that. When you say 'some freaky guy' I'm assuming you don't really know him- don't you think he was probably just having a laugh with a bunch of gullible people?  Your dog looked freaked out because he was in the dark then all of a sudden it was light. The candle probably went out because of a draught. There's a million and one reasons why your friend's hand hurts.  It's just a stupid juvenile game- when you're older you'll think about it and laugh that you took something so stupid so seriously. It meant nothing, nothing happened, it's all in your mind. See any ouija board based horror movie or ghost story for further details.|`|nsBxgXI1aa	i never do the ouija board as it would scare me too i do tarot cards but ouija boards are dangerous you never know who you are going to get messages from    you need to tell the spirit to leave everyone who did it with you all need to tell it to go together|`|7HBTvg8Caa	Just so you know, it's all very fake.

There are many levels spirit works at, there is no such thing as hell... as we are told in books etc. It would take far to long to explain.  All of us have guides and we are all spirit ,so no one is far greater in that respect because they are on the other side, so to speak.  The board if done should always be done with an opening and closing in prayer and you should always have some one who has control and does not freak out at fear generated by the other people doing it.

Hit enter and it will convert your decimal answer to a fraction.|`|vvYQUbkYaa	on all TI calculators, fractions are given as common fractions. here you have 3 and 3/4, first convert it into a common fraction.  multiply the whole number (3) by the denominator of the fraction part (4) to get 12. then add the numerator of the fraction part (3) to get 15. then put that number over the original denominator (4) to get 15/4.  in the calculator, hit 15, then the division sign, then 4. that's how you enter it into the TI-83 (and all TI calculators).
vl0HWTDJaa	Product of prime factors means you need to keep dividing the number until you've got a multiplication of prime numbers so for 8 you could say 8 = 4x2, but 4 isn't a prime number so you need to divide that again so you get 8 = 2 x 2 x 2. You can put it in a diagram form like:                                         8                                      4      2                                2      2      but with lines connecting all the numbers, then circle all the numbers you end up with (in this case all the 2s) - sorry, it's hard to do on here! Here's a link to what it should look like:        http://images.google.co.uk/images?hl=en&...    If you do the same thing for 24 you end up with                                 24                             4       6                         2    2   2    3    so 24 = 2 x 2 x 2 x 3 then if you add those to the answer for 8 you get    2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 3 as your answer to question 1a      The highest common factor is the biggest number that both factors divide by. Usually you can do it by working out the prime factors like the last question, then circling all the numbers that appear in both and timesing them together so if you were doing it for the numbers 8 and 24 you'd have    8 = 2 x 2 x 2  24=2 x 2 x 2 x 3    The numbers that appear in both are 2 x 2 x 2 which equals 8 so tha would be the highest common facctor in those numbers.    For X and 3X, the factor diagram would be:    X   = X  3X = 3 x X    So the only common number is X, which is therefore the HCF.      x 10^ always means you just need to move the decimal point. Whatever it's to the power of is how many places you move the decimal so for example 2.3 x 10^2 is the same as 2.3 x 100 which equals 230 so the decimal's moved down 2 places. When it's to the power of a minus number than the decimal point will move the other way so in this case it would move 5 places to the left:    7.2 x 10^-5 = 0.000072    Then you've got to divide it by 0.0000036. If you multiply this by the same amount as 7.2 x 10^-5 by moving the decimal point 5 places you would get 0.36 x 10^-5 so you just need to divide 7.2 by 0.36 which is 20.    1a = 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 3  1b = x  2a = 0.000072  2b = 20|`|eTTkAv9Yaa	You need to go back to your teacher and tell them that you still don't understand, they are getting paid to teach you how, if they can't do this they are failing, not you.

Actual heights of trees are continuous because, as it grows from 28 ft to 29 ft, it passes through every possible height in between, even if it cannot be measured with absolute accuracy.    However, the numbers used to report the heights are not continuous. The heights are probably reported to the nearest 0.1 ft and so are not continuous. At some point the measured height would instantly change from 28.3 ft to 28.4 ft.
DrwY7dJCaa	Food energy (glucose/ proteins/ lipids...) are broken down to form ATP (the universal energy carrier) during cellular respiration. Although the process requires energy, more is made than is used up.  Photosynthesis is the opposite. Light energy along with carbon dioxide and CO2 are used to make organic molecules i.e. food energy.|`|3ZPYB7nxaa	Photosynthesis is a process in which solar energy is used to make simple carbohydrates directly from water and carbon dioxide. These are built up into larger carbohydrates.     Respiration is basically the opposite process. Carbohydrates are broken back down into water and carbon dioxide.    Combustion is similar to respiration in the formation of the same products. The difference is in how the energy is handled. In combustion, all the chemical energy escapes as heat and light. In respiration, the energy is stored in a substance called ATP. This is a co enzyme which all living things use as an energy source. Every chemical reaction except photosynthesis is driven by the chemical energy stored in ATP. This chemical battery is "recharged" through respiration. All life on earth uses respiration to recharge ATP.

Ii8h0mgkaa	Incomplete combustion:  A reaction or process which entails only partial burning of a fuel. This may be due to a lack of oxygen or low temperature, preventing the complete chemical reaction. If, hydrocarbons burn  with imperfect efficiency, it will also produce carbon monoxide and things like nitrogen oxides.      Complete combustion:   it means that whatever you are burning (usually hydrocarbon) burns/reacts completely with oxygen gas (O2) to form ONLY CO2 (carbon dioxide) and water (H2O).    So that means there are no by-products!  Only CO2 and H2O are your products     If, however, it burns with imperfect efficiency, it will also produce carbon monoxide and things like nitrogen oxides.

OWPkhnf5aa	In question 1 you need to find the marginal density function of Y2.    let's call that function g(y2)  g(y2) = Integral(domain of y1)f(y1,y2)dy1    The domain of y1 is [2y2, 2] and f(y1,y2) = 1 on that interval    g(y2) = Integral(2y2 to 2)dy1 = 2(1-y2)    And then, P(Y2 > 0.5) = Integral(0.5 to 1)g(y2)dy2    an antiderivative of g(y2) is G(y2) = 2y2 -y2^2  and P(Y2 >0.5) = G(1) - G(1/2) = 2 -1 -1 +1/4 = 1/4      In question 2 you need to find the conditional distribution function h(y1|y2)    By definition: f(y1,y2) = h(y1|y2)*g(y2)  and then, on your domain, you have:     h(y1|y2) =  f(y1,y2)/g(y2) = 1/(2-2y2)    for y2=0.5, h(y1|y2=0.5)=  1 on the interval of y1, which is [1,2]    P(y1 > a| y2=0.5) = 2-a  with a in [1,2]  Of course with a=2 your probability is 0.
mH1Tnv5Naa	The Canadian plains area climate is typical of a continental climate, where air masses from the arctic and air masses from the tropics affect the area depending on the time of year.  As a result there is a wide temperature range from very cold in winter to very warm in the summer.  Precipitation can range from heavy snowfalls in the colder times of the year to strong and severe thunderstorms in the warmer times.|`|nbChnDIBaa	"Plains Region" identifies the "Great Plains" area.  Its climate is traditionally windy.  The plains area are low lying and flat, with very limited breaks, such as mountains and severe changes in elevation.    So, "Plains Region Climate" refers to the weather and characteristics of the climate due to the topography and geological location of the "Great Plains" area.    The Great Plains is a pinnacle component for wind power, due to its high consistent winds.    Hope this helps.
k1lbyisjaa	If you want the power out of the solar cell, then you have to place the voltmeter AT THE SOLAR CELL.  If you placed the voltmeter anywhere else, then you could only calculate the power being dissipated where the meter was.      The solar cell will produce power output, whether into a resistor, or into the resistor and all the wiring to it.  You want to know what the solar cell is providing, not what the resistor is dissipating.    And, by the way, you need to take your resistance reading there, too.|`|8Y7LQ6TGaa	As long as your wires are the right size, it's the same. The resistor load is connected across the cell output, and the voltmeter is connected there also. All 3 are in parallel.    Remember that you can parallel/series resistors to get different values.    .|`|yxnUBSJqaa	Across the solar cell.|`|tTEYXkbmaa	Doesn't really matter because of conservation of energy or Kirchhoff's Voltage Law. The power cell is supplying the energy, and the resistors are `absorbing' the energy. They're really dissipating or converting the electric energy into heat.    Also, if it's a simple circuit where you connect the terminals of the resistor to the terminals of the solar cell, then you only have two nodes. All you'll be getting is the voltage difference between the nodes. All the voltages will be the same because everything (resistor, solar cell, voltmeter) will be connected in parallel.    If you're trying to find the internal resistance, remember that you'll have to replace the source with a Thevenin equivalent circuit (voltage source connected in series with a resistor).

Another potential storage method is to charge up rechargable batteries but, you need a lot of batteries to store  (and they are not free) and the batteries lose some electricity over time.

However, the theory is non-renormalizable, so it probably isn't the ultimate truth of the matter.  In any case, we can't achieve nearly high enough energies to actually probe the quantum nature of gravity.|`|4c2daec05f4f88483fd1490ee194945aaa	No.   The two theories work fine at their respective scales. But so far, no one has found any way to combine them into a single, unified theory. That has been done for electromagnetic fields and quantum mechanics, and it is called Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). That has been extended further with the 'color' property, Quantum Cromodynamics (QCD). But no one has been able to do that with gravity. Some efforts besides superstring and M-brane theories include quantum gravity and quantum loop gravity. For one overview readable by the 'intelligent layperson', see the reference.

I will try to write this out the best I can...    C8H18 +O2 yields CO2 + H2O    To balance this you have to see what each side has, Each side has this:    Side one: C8H18+O2  Side two: CO2+H2O    As you can see both sides are very different so we will have to add alot, to make side one balanced we must keep all of its original elements and add the ones from side two, like this:    C8H18+O2+CO2+H20 (This is your new side one)    Now the same with side two:    CO2+H2O+02+C8H18    Put it together to ensure balance:    C8H18+O2+CO2+H20=CO2+H2O+02+C8H18    This is a tough one to show exactly what balancing is all about so here is an example, Let's say you have an equation that looks like this:    C2+H20+H18= 2H2O+ 3C2+ 4O2    Now to balance it we add to each side    Side one: 4C2+3H2O+H18+4O2   Side two: 3H2O+4C2+4O2+H18    New Equation: 4C2+3H2O+H18+4O2=3H2O+4C2+4O2+H18    As you can see in this one even though both sides had similar elements such as the C2 and the H2O, you have to add the numbers together so that each side has the SAME number of elements on each side to stabalize the elements.    So if one side has 1H2O and the other has 5H2O in the final equation each side must have 6H2O.    Been awhile since I have done these, but I hope this helps.    Irishgirl
AA10236289	This is an inertia problem.  Assuming no loss of energy, or, any absorption of energy during the collision, the inertia of the of each railroad car added together will be the inertia of them combined. it is a simple algebra problem.    M = MASS  V = VELOCITY    MV1 = INERTIA of 10m/s car  MV2 = INERTIA of 30m/s car  MV3 = INERTIA of both combined    MV1 + MV2 = MV3    Since the 30m/s car is traveling in the opposite direction, for the sake of this problem, this makes the inertia a negative vale compared to the 10m/s car.

euaIzZr4aa	Dear Princess:    First circle has center at (12,5) with radius 5  Call the centre C  The line through the origin and C  (line OC) is   y = 5x/12.    Now the x-axis is a tangent, since radius = 5 and C is the point (12,5).  Circle therefore touches x-axis.  So the length OC (by pythag)  is sqrt(5^2 +12^2) = 13.  Since the radius =5 it follows that the nearest point to O is 13-5 =8 and the farthest is 13+5 = 18 units from O (i.e. at the extremities of the line OC).    General circle is x^2+y^2 +2gx+2fy+c=0  If it passes through (5,9)  &  (3,3)  then    25+81+10g+18f+c=0    or   10g+18f+c = -106  9+9+6g+6f+c=0           or    6g+6f+c = -18     But slope of circle at (3,3) is 1 (since y=x is a tangent)    Differentiate equation of circle, put in the point (3,3)   you get:   dy/dx=-(g+3)/(f+3)  So since slope = 1,     -g-3 = f+3  or f+g = -6    Solve the 3 equations for f, g, c and you get  c=18, g=2, f=-8    Equation of circle is thus   x^2 +y^2 +4x -16y +18 = 0

QNyztmU3aa	One way to do this is to just compute a bunch of derivatives and plug in x = 0.  However, there is a trick that might make things a tad easier.  Perhaps you are aware of the formula for the sum of a geometric series; it is:    1/(1 - x) = 1 + x + x^2 + x^3 +.... (converges when |x|     The trick is to integrate both sides of the equation.  If you are in an advanced calculus class, then you should worry about integrating the right hand side; fortunately, power series converge uniformly on compact sets and thus we are justified in integrating term-by-term.  If you are not in an advanced calculus class, then you probably just don't care.  Anyway, you get:    Integral(1/(1-x)) = Integral(1 + x + x^2 +...)  -ln(1-x) = x + 1/2 x^2 + 1/3 x^3 +...  ln(1-x) = -x - 1/2 x^2 - 1/3 x^3 -...    This is all valid whenever |x|     ln(1+x) = ln(1 - (-x)) = -(-x) - 1/2 (-x)^2 - 1/3 (-x)^3 - 1/4 (-x)^4 -...  = x - 1/2 x^2 + 1/3 x^3 - 1/4 x^4 +....    Finally, to get the last one, use the identity ln((1+x)/(1-x)) = ln(1+x) - ln(1-x).  Again, since everything converges nicely we can perform this subtraction term-by-term.  Comparing the two series, you will notice that the even powers of x all cancel and the odd powers double up.  So you get:    ln((1+x)/(1-x)) = 2x + 2/3 x^3 + 2/5 x^5 +...    This also converges whenever |x|

A good theory will make predictions of observations that haven't been made yet or observations that have been made which cannot be explained by existing theories.    If you have two theories which identically explain the observations, you usually prefer the simpler one--a test called Occam's razor.    For example.  There is a theory that the universe was created a short time ago by a flying spaghetti monster.  It's a satisfactory theory in that can't be ruled out by experiment.  But it's not a good theory because it doesn't make any unique predictions about what we should observe.  In fact, there are almost no observations we could make that would exclude it.  Also, the very complicated arguements in the theory that explain why the universe appears so old when in fact it is very young make it fail spectacularly on the occam's razor test.|`|pRF5LLloaa	ALL theories are good.

It was an attempt to map all the human chromosomes down to the base level.    It was important because we were able to locate and define each of the human genes (~ 30.000).    Celeron Corp also ran a similar project at about the same time.
YVmAKb8Eaa	I don't think scientists are thinking along the line as to the possibility that you'd mate with a clone...or want to, for that matter. Do you even know how far away we are from completely cloning a human being? I highly doubt that there will be enough in your life time for you to actually breed with one.    There can be defects with everything. A lot of people are still having trouble with bioengineering and other scientific advancements that can prove to be defective in the long run to our bodies.|`|YHNK9UrQaa	I read that "Dolly" the cloned sheep aged at a faster rate than other lambs born at the same time as Dolly was born.    Sheep have a life expectancy of about twelve years, ... but Dolly lived to be only six years of age.  She died of lung cancer, ... that is a fairly common disease of sheep ...  However, some have speculated that a contributing factor to Dolly's death was that she could have been born with a genetic age of six years, the same age as the sheep from which she was cloned.     Dolly lived for her entire life at the Roslin Institute. There she was bred with a Welsh Mountain ram and produced six lambs in total.     Read the rest of wiki article about Dolly.

mH1Tnv5Naa	Yes, it is believed that one might exist there.  The center of the Milky way does glow because there are still billions of stars outside of that proposed black hole, including many that are between us and the hole, so we don't "see" the black hole itself, but can only detect evidence of its existence.|`|3f49d1173ab44657705ae3106bb11dc6aa	Astronomers believe so.  That is what their data implies.    We cannot see to the center of the Milky Way Galaxy.  When you say you se the bright "Milky Way" you are seeing only a small portion of the Galaxy - near the outer edge.|`|jSPj3S6faa	There is very likely a super-massive black hole at the center of the Milky Way.  Although a black hole itself is really quite black and only barely visible against a background of stars, there is a lot of activity occurring in its immediate vicinity.    The majority of fantastic explosive activity that occurs because of a black hole happens in its immediate vicinity. (We shall set aside the technicality that the true cause of all this is a singularity which generates the black hole and which is the source of the gravitational field associated with a black hole.)    Matter that is attracted to a black hole due to its gravity is highly accelerated. This causes quite a few collisions of particles creating a substantial amount of radiation. These are the events which are observed in the vicinity of a black hole.    One can easily wonder: since the gravity of a black hole is generated by a spherical object, shouldn't the effect of gravity be equal all around the black hole, thus allowing nothing to escape even these proposed jets at the poles of the black hole?    At first glance, this does seem to be a bit contradictory; first we say that matter is tremendously attracted to a black hole with the conclusion that nothing can escape. Then we say, "Oh here are these fantastic jets of ultra-high power radiation streaming away from the black hole." How can this be true?    (This entire answer assumes that black holes exist as commonly proposed so as to not complicate matters.)    It needs to be recognized that the gravitational field of a black hole is not stationary; for the singularity within it must be rotating if it ever rotated at all. And its rate of rotation is far beyond anyone's imagination. After all, science has detected bodies that are rotating above hundreds of times per second. And these are only quark stars, behomeths in comparison to a singularity.    Therefore, the gravitational field of a black hole (singularity) is moving at far beyond the speed of light. This proposal does not violate the universal speed limit of the universe; for that only applies to matter.    So what matter can withstand the blender-like attack of the gravitational lines of force in the vicinity of a black hole that are tearing around at speeds far beyond what any matter can survive? So it is not simply the gravitational pull of a black hole which creates the high-energy radiation in the vicinity of a black hole; that is barely warming things up. It is the motion of the gravitational lines of force that create such havoc.    So now we move to the poles of a black hole. There are lines of gravitational force there also... but they are not cutting through space. As we reach Planck scales, the line of force is simply spinning and mere gravity alone exists. True, it is over 25,000 g's of gravity but that's all that's happening there.    The radiation that encircles a black hole can migrate to the poles and from there be ejected into space against the ridiculous amount of gravity by the insane amount of energy being generated in the vicinity of the black hole.    This is how there can be jets of energetic radiation traveling away from a black hole. (However, as a side note, this has nothing to do with Hawking radiation... which doesn't exist.)    Jets have been observed in the vicinity of black hole candidates. They are only candidates because black holes are not yet directly detectable.    The truly fascinating thing to consider in all of this is that contrary to present theories nothing can ever touch, let alone impact, and never you mind enter a black hole. Yet all of this super-light motion and destruction occurs right next to it. For we already acknowledge that time ceases to exist at the event horizon of a black hole. Therefore, no time exists in which an object can touch it. And you can slam two billion-solar-mass black holes at each other at the speed of light... they will not touch, they will not merge.|`|ftwGaZ4Uaa	Yes, it is very likely. The light you see, is not the black hole, but the stars which travel around it. The black hole is a region of maximal 44 million km diameter, in which 3.7 million times the mass of the sun is concentrated. We can be sure of these two values, because the diameter is calculated by radio telescopic observations of the X-ray Emissions, created by gas which surrounds the Black Hole at high speeds. The mass is calculated from the orbit periods and the known average distance of the stars to this center.|`|LRH9Em0yaa	There is, But Millions of Light years away, It can't suck nothing in though No more.|`|79529314dfb5ac7be366558924c3393baa	There is a supermassive black hole located in the center of the Milky Way. However, although it is extremely massive relative to stars, its event horizon (the area beyond which light cannot escape) is still not very large when compared with the enormous distances between star systems, so the area that the light can't escape from is really quite small indeed on a galactic scale. The central bulge of the Milky Way contains tens of billions of stars, and only a very tiny fraction of their combined light is being sucked up by the black hole.|`|QKO4f5q0aa	Yes, there is a black hole in the center of the milky way, with a mass of approximately 4 millon suns.      There are stars in orbit around the black hole, which is what we see glowing.  We can't see the black hole itself directly, but we *can* see its effect on the stars near it.  Check out the link below, it has some animations of infrared images taken of Sgr A * over 16 years, and you can see the central stars whipping around like slingshots.    The black hole is not 'active' at the moment (meaning it is not pulling in large amounts of matter), although it has flared a couple of times that we've seen.  This is a good thing, because an active galactic central black hole is what we call an 'Active Galactic Nucleus', which is what we used to call 'quasars'.|`|NbD5L7BZaa	Yes, scientists have discovered what is possibly a black hole in the constellation of Sagittarius in our galaxy the "Milky Way".|`|73d140d83d29234efdfa2c38e0168b47aa	No it is not there.

Just because there are claims that Japan is not using the exclusion for it's proper purpose doesn't mean that it's not banned.     I would say a better arguement might be why commercial whale hunting might be a better choice for whales in the long run. If the countries interested in whaling continue on their current track they will, within the next decade, either have enough countries to vote to remove the restriction (meaning that the pro-whaling nations will have more power to vote on regulations than the anti-whaling nations which likely will mean high quotas) OR they will cecede from the IWC.  By allowing a small commercial quota, this may dissolve Japan's current mission to get as many pro-whaling nations on the commission as possible (which they're getting a lot of, by the way) and it would mean that the pro-whaling nations might stay with IWC and may be more amenable to regulations rather than jumping off the IWC and just doing whatever they want and setting their own quotas. But i digress...    A better source than wiki would be the IWC itself since it is the regulating body that determines whether whale hunting should be banned and which whales may be hunted if the hunt falls under an exclusion.

We are not using him for food ( which even if we WERE that would be awful...Go veg!) and we don't necessarily NEED his blubber for oils and such. All those substances can be compromised.   Whales are not in excess. The Minke(the most common species) whale population has plummeted 740 thousand to 720 thousand over the past 30 years. The bin whale species went from 30 thousand to 7 thousand. EVEN more violently, more unknown species such as the Eubalaena glacialis plummeted from ten thousand to 350!!! Whales are becoming extinct- though not ALL whales are endangered. There are species of whale, such as the gray whale's, population has actually INCREASED.   Regardless. Hunting is not necessary. It may be "fun" or you may justify the game as " keeping the natural balance to avoid overpopulation" but NATURE doesn't include guns. Let the world/God take care of when the animals should die, and how.    =]

NSQaDOhYaa	The simplest thing to do, and the best way for you to understand what a calibration curve actually represents, is to draw a calibration curve on a piece of graph paper and use it to interpret the results obtained with the samples. Let's deal with these actions separately.    Looking at the set of values obtained with the standard solution of glucose, notice that the first is obtained with no glucose present at all. This is not unusual, it's known as a 'zero error' and if you were analysing the calibration data you would subtract it from all the other readings. But with a plotted calibration curve it's simpler to leave it alone, just be aware that your line won't go through the origin as you might expect.    Next plot your readings against the concentration of glucose in each standard sample along the x-axis. You have two problems: the readings for the samples in the second part of the experiment are over twice the maximum calibration reading, so you need to leave space to allow for these. So your x-axis - the amount of glucose in the sample - needs to extend from zero out to around 2.0, and the vertical axis - the reading from whatever machine you were using - needs to go from zero to around 2.2. For optimum accuracy, these should fill as much of the graph paper in both directions as possible.    The second problem is that, when you come to plot your calibration curve, you will find that the second measurement (0.387) is way off the line joining the other points (which is near-enough straight, by the way). So check it if you can, make sure you haven't misread it; if you can find no explanation and can't repeat the measurement, probably the best course is to treat it as an outlier and ignore it - you should say what you have done (and why) in the experiment report, of course.    The final step is to draw a straight line or gentle curve through your data points out to the maximum value of the x-axis (2.0). This is beyond the range of calibration points, so you are extrapolating the curve - always a dangerous procedure, and you might like to consider how this will affect the accuracy of the results you obtain for the honey solutions. So you then have a calibration curve; make sure you label the axes, and mark the major divisions on the graph paper with the corresponding x- and y-values, about ten for each should be sufficient.    To use the curve, take each reading obtained with the honey solutions and locate its position on the y-axis. With a straight edge or ruler transfer this horizontally across to the curve, and then use the ruler to find the corresponding concentration of glucose by going vertically down from this point to the x-axis. It's straightforward enough once you get the hang of it.    Good luck!|`|M9JcanLKaa	In turn subtract your blank reading (0.077) from the readings of the standards then plot them against the concentration of glucose. I can't help there as you have not given the concentrations in the stock solution, but you have diluted it so you have concentrations respectively 0.5, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 & 1.0 times the stock solution concentration. Then plot these on a simple graph with concentration on the x-axis and the reading on the y-axis. I looks to me that you have an odd reading with the first result. I would have expected a reading of 0.25 to 0.26 rather than 0.425. The plot line should be straight so find the best fit line. Then take your readings for the honey solutions. Take the two results you obtained for each concentration, subtract the blank reading and use the graph to follow your readings on the y-axis of the graph and read the corresponding concentrations on x-axis. You will therefore get two concentrations for each dilution, these will give an indication of the reproducibility and error. You can average them and then need to multiply by the dilution factor for the appropriate sample i.e. 20, 10 & 5 times. The end result should be the same, but no doubt with a scatter (again an indication of the reproducibility and accuracy). Average the concentrations and that's your result.|`|neW1XZtJaa	There are a couple of ways to do this.  The easiest is too plot your standard on a piece of graph paper.  The mls of glucose are the X values, and the results you get are the Y values.  If you do that then you will see that it makes a line (more or less) that goes up from left to right.  Then draw a line between the points.  It won't touch all the points, but it will be a good fit for the data.  Then just take your results and  from your unknows with honey and place them on the line you drew according to the Y value.  And then you draw a line to the X axis to find out how much glucose that represents.    You can do the same thing with exel.  Plot the stuff like I said above.  Use the XY scatter plot in excel.  Then when it draws a line between your points right click on the line, or if you don't plot a line just click on the points.  That brings up a menu that allows you to add a trendline.  Choose a linear one and in the options click on display equation on chart.  Then solve the equation for X.  That way you can input the Y value (the result) and the number you get is the X value (the amount of glucose).    As for your numbers and some other details...  -Your results are larger in many cases than the values for your standards.  Not good.  Tested values should always lie within the values of your standards.  In your case you are lucky and you can say, Hey, it's a line!  So, the larger values should just be further out on the line.  That might be true for the values near your standards, lik eht 1.056 and 1.092, but may not be true for the 2 values.  Say that in your write up.  -What is 0.2ml of glucose?  I would think that you would have either a measured amount of glucose (like grams) or that you would have the molarity of the glucose.  I'll leave that to you.

The real roots of 8 + 0i and 0 + 0i are trivial - the trick is to get the other two.    Once the 0 root is acknowledged, the equation simplifies to:    x^3 = 512     and the second root falls out as +8.    Now you need to try and recall the classwork you must have done on complex numbers. It may be that there are no complex roots because the other two roots coincide with those already found. Use the discriminant to see if that is the case.    If not, the other two will a complex conjugate and you can employ one of a whole host of numerical methods to find them.
pBSKTPJhaa	ZENER DIODE TESTING     The testing of zener diodes requires a variable dc power supply. A typical test circuit can be constructed, as shown in figure 4-19. In this circuit, the variable power supply is used to adjust the input voltage to a suitable value for the zener diode being tested. Resistor R1 limits the current through the diode. With the zener diode connected as shown in figure 4-19, no current will flow until the voltage across the diode is equal to the zener voltage. If the diode is connected in the opposite direction, current will flow at a low voltage, usually less than 1 volt. Current flow at a low voltage in both directions indicates that the zener diode is defective.         Zener Diode Tester                               Here is a handy zener diode tester which tests zener diodes with breakdown voltages extending up to 120 volts. The main advantage of this circuit is that it works with a voltage as low as 6V DC and consumes less than 8 mA current. The circuit can be fitted in a 9V battery box. Two-third of the box may be used for four 1.5V batteries and the remaining one-third is sufficient for accommodating this circuit. In this circuit a commonly available transformer with 230V AC primary to 9-0-9V, 500mA secondary is used in reverse to achieve higher AC voltage across 230V AC terminals. Transistor T1 (BC547) is configured as an oscillator and driver to obtain required AC voltage across transformers 230V AC terminals. This AC voltage is converted to DC by diode D1 and filter capacitor C2 and is used to test the zener diodes. R3 is used as a seri- es current limiting resistor. After assembling the circuit, check DC voltage across points A and B without connecting any zener diode. Now switch on S1. The DC voltage across A-B should vary from 10V to 120V by adjusting potmeter VR1 (10k). If every thing is all right, the circuit is ready for use. For testing a zener diode of unknown value, connect it across points A and B with cathode towards A. Adjust potmeter VR1 so as to obtain the maximum DC voltage across A and B. Note down this zener value corresponding to DC voltage reading on the digital multimeter. When testing zener diode of value less than 3.3V, the meter shows less voltage instead of the actual zener value. However, correct reading is obtained for zener diodes of value above 5.8V with a tolerance of  10per cent. In case zener diode shorts, the multimeter shows 0 volts|`|O7rMKLEMaa	In 1973, I had a job testing zener diodes for use in analog to digital converters. These ADC's were accurate to 16 bits at 100,000 conversions per second.     I used a circuit similar to that shown in Amitabh Bachan's link. However, the zener diode was enclosed in an insulated box where I controlled the temperature. All other components were kept at room temperature. I tested the zener diode over a wide range of temperature (to meet military specs). At each temperature I applied several known currents thru the diode and measured the zener voltage.     I graphed the results and analyzed the curves to obtain a polynomial equation for temperature to voltage at each current. The equation was always in the form v = aI^3 + bI^2 + cI + d. Depending on the equation I found, the diodes were either selected for military or civilian use or rejected.     Today's ADC's can digitally compensate for the known temperature curve of the zener diode, but in the 1970's they had to get the right number without any digital compensation.|`|c3DqvgE4aa	ZENER DIODE TESTING    The testing of zener diodes requires a variable dc power supply.

jWMXi3Lnaa	It is charged by a battery or other source and holds that charge using two magnetic plates. For example, a flash camera uses a capacitor to make a bright flash|`|xXOnjDNOaa	Capacitors separate oppositely signed charges from each other, creating a potential field.  Essentially you have one negatively charged plate held a short distance from a positively charged plate, and as a result of the charge difference there is an electric potential associated with this arrangement.  If you connect these two plates (via a wire) the charge will work to equalize, and as the charge is moving you get electric current.  You can think of a capacitor as something like an electric spring, you can store electric energy in it by charging it (similar to storing mechanical energy by compressing a spring).|`|HTmj2BXDaa	Mef is right on.  Just to add a little detail...  Capacitors typically are designed with a lot of surface area so there is a lot of area for the charge to be "stored" on.  One way to do this is to create a three part sandwitch, one side a conductor, the "cream filling" is an insulator, and the other side is a conductor.  If you use a battery or any source of electrical voltage, the voltage tries to drive electric current from the conductor on one side across the insulator to the conductor on the other side.  Since the insulator prevents the current from flowing, there is a build up of electrical potential.  When you remove the battery, that electrical potential is stored and, if you make an electrical connection from one foil conductor to the other foil conductor, that electrical energy is released.  One old trick in the elecrical lab was to charge up a small capacitor, disconnect it from the power supply and carefully through it to someone.  When they caught it, their skin would complete the circuit and they would get a little shock.  There is a limit on how quickly the capacitor can be charged up (an inductance) and a limit on how long it will hold a charge (there is always a leakage current).  Hope this helps|`|yxnUBSJqaa	Capacitors are passive electronic components that store energy in the form of an electrostatic field. In their simplest form, capacitors consist of two conducting plates separated by an insulating material called the dielectric. The capacitance is directly proportional to the surface areas of the plates, and is inversely proportional to the separation between the plates. Capacitance also depends on the dielectric constant of the substance separating the plates.  The standard unit of capacitance is the farad, abbreviated F. This is a large unit; more common units are the microfarad, abbreviated F (1 F = 10-6 F) and the Pico farad, abbreviated pF (1 pF = 10-12 F).   Capacitors can be fixed or variable.  Fixed capacitors have a fixed capacitance value, nonadjustable.  Variable capacitors are adjustable (typically via a potentiometer), specific capacitance values can be set via adjustment mechanism.  Capacitors that may be safely operated with only one DC polarity are called "polar" or polarized. Capacitors, which can be operated without regard to polarity, are "nonpolar." Sometimes "polar" caps are combined in special ways to allow a limited ability to cope with reversing polarity; these are called "bipolar."  Dielectric materials that are available for capacitors include air, aluminum electrolytic, ceramic, glass, mica, multilayer, oil, paraffin paper, polycarbonate, polyester, polypropylene, polystyrene, tantalum, and teflon.  The capacitance range is an important specification that dictates the range of the capacitance of the capacitor.  Fixed capacitors have only one value.  Variable capacitors should have a range of capacitance values.  The capacitance tolerance is the precision of the capacitance produced by the capacitor measured as a percent of the capacitance.  Important packaging specifications to consider for capacitors include lead types, mounting options and operating temperature.  Lead types include: axial leads, radial lead, flying leads, no leads (SMT), tab leads, screw leads, gull wing leads, and j-leads.  Through-hole capacitors connect to a printed circuit board by inserting a terminal or lead through a hole in the board and soldering it to the opposite side.  Surface mount components are a direct response to cost reduction efforts that center around improved circuit board production. Automatic or robotic pick and place equipment can pick up and place surface mount style components on a printed circuit board faster and more accurately than previous technology would allow. Instead of a pin or terminal passing through a printed circuit board and being soldered on the opposite side, surface mount components utilize a flat solderable surface that is soldered to a flat solderable pad on the face of the printed circuit board. The pad on the circuit board is usually coated with a paste like formulation of solder and flux. With careful placement, surface mount style components on solder paste will stay in position until elevated temperatures, usually from an infrared oven, melt the solder paste and solder the mount's flat terminals to the circuit board's pad.  Bracket mount capacitors come with a bracket for mounting.

I think where you're going with this is that general relativity is a classical, mechanistic kind of theory--not entirely unlike Newton's theory of gravity.  It doesn't explain quantum behavior.    On the other hand, you can develop a simple quantum field theory of gravity--a force mediated by a spin-2 boson (the graviton) which couples to energy.  This field theory reproduces the results of general relativity at the macroscopic scale in the same way that quantum electrodynamics reproduces Maxwell's electrodynamics or that Schrodinger's quantum mechanics reproduces Newtonian mechanics.    The problem with quantum gravity is that it's non-renormalizable.  There are infinite energies that can't be reconciled.  So there's something more there than meets the eye.    In any case, the amount of energy you'd need to probe quantum gravity is many orders of magnitude beyond what we can produce.|`|1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	To make it short, when you try to reconcile general relativity with quantum mechanics - bring them to the same level - you end up with infinite probabilities.  QM is all about probability, but probabilities are out of 1, not infinity - however, this problem appears to go away if you account for 11 dimensions instead of 4, which is where string theory comes in.|`|74952ed678a6ad90560f5a699c221b7caa	Because when Einsteinian physics is applied to sub atomic particles, it fails to get the jitters.  But sub atomic particles are jittery.  They are in continual motion, flitting about.  Einsteinian physics, on the other hand, is deterministic.  Its solutions are as certain as 2 + 2.    Quanta are jittery.  Because of something called the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, the location and/or the momenta of sub atomic particles cannot be precisely measured.  There will always be some uncertainty.      And this uncertainty is best described by probability density functions.  For example, we can say a given electron has a high probability of being located at a given shell around a nucleus, but we cannot be certain it will be there at any given moment.    That's the bottom line.  Einsteinian physics is deterministic.  It would claim that the electron would be at a certain location for sure.  Quantum physics is probabilistic.  It would only claim that the electron has a certain probability of being at a given location.  And lab experiments are conclusive...when it comes to sub atomic particles...quantum physics is remarkably accurate...Einsteinian physics is not.    In addition to the problem of not being jittery, Einsteinian physics also blows up (mathematically) as it addresses ever smaller quanta.  In fact, as sub atomic quanta are modeled as dimensionless points in Einsteinian physics, the solutions hit something called a singularity.      The easiest singularity to see is N/0 where N  0 is any non-zero value.  When N is divided by 0 the result blows up, becomes indeterminant, and some would write (incorrectly) that N/0 = infinity.  In Einsteinian physics that zero is similar to the dimensionless points used to model sub atomic particles...a singularity is formed by the equations.    In sum, the two physics do not fit at the sub atomic level because QP gives valid answers and EP blows up and gives invalid answers.|`|f1AvsgCDaa	cause hes smart|`|4c2daec05f4f88483fd1490ee194945aaa	Some good answers from Mistress Bekki and eyeonthescreen.  The two theories work fine at their respective scales.  But so far, no one has found any way to combine them into a single, unified theory.  That has been done for electromagnetic fields and quantum mechanics, and it is called Quantum Electrodynamics (QED).  That has been extended further with the 'color' property, Quantum Cromodynamics (QCD).  But no one has been able to do that with gravity.  Some efforts besides superstring and M-brane theories include quantum gravity and quantum loop gravity.  For one overview readable by the 'intelligent layperson', see the reference.

aHN5fDwQaa	I wondered that myself for many years. It was not until I had a practical application that I understood the significance of a matrix inversion.    I will describe the situation as best I can and hopefully it will make sense to you.    I worked for a company that made measurements of the physical properties of rock formations encountered in a borehole (oil or gas well). Different instruments were used to measure different properties. For example, one instrument recorded the speed of sound in the formations, another recorded how well the formations conducted electricity. One instrument reacted to the presence of shaly or clay-like materials, two others responded to the amount of pore space within the rock and to the type of rock.    From this array of instruments we would obtain a set of measurements, which we could call the Tool vector T.    The desired results of these measurements was to determine the volume of the formation comprised of rock and the volume of pore space. Of the pore space, we would also want to know how much of that volume was comprised of hydrocarbon (and further, how much was gas and how much was oil) and how much was water. Of the rock portion we would like to know what volume is made up of sandstone, what part was limestone, and what part was shale. In addition, we might want to solve for the volume of some other minerals like salt, anhydrite or dolomite.    So our solution also took the form of a vector, the Volume vector V, which contains the volumes of water, hydrocarbon, limestone, sandstone, shale, and any other component we were interested in solving for.    The relationship between those two vectors was a matrix, called the Response matrix R. The response matrix consisted of the individual tools responses to each particular component in the volume vector. So the response matrix had the same number of rows at the tool vector and the same number of columns as the volume vector. The response matrix, by the way, is a Jacobian matrix, i.e., a partial derivative of each tool response with respect to each formation volume.    We could write it like this    T = R*V    Expanding out of matrix notation into equation form, we could say, for example, that the acoustic travel time (speed of sound) as measured by the tool is the sum of the speed of sound in pure (0% porosity) sandstone times the volume of sandstone in the formation plus the speed of sound in pure limestone times the volume of limestone in the formation plus the speed of sound in pure water times the volume of water in the formation plus... for each component volume that we were interested in.    Note that the summation in the previous paragraph describes one element of T, one row of R and one element of V. A separate equation, in the same form, can be written for each tool reading. Expressing the whole thing in matrix notation simplifies its representation, as you get rid of all the messy summations and the whole thing can be written as    T = R*V    But look at what we know. We know the T vector because that is what was recorded by the instruments. And we know R because we have made laboratory measurements of the physical characteristics of each type of formation component for each of the types of instruments used.    What we _don't_ know is V, the formation volumes. But looking at the equation reveals the solution. We can simply say    V = T/R    or equivalently    V = T * 1/R    Do you see the matrix inverse? In order to solve the problem, we will have to invert the response matrix and multiply it by the tool measurement vector to determine the volume vector.    I think I had been out of college for a decade before I ever encountered this problem in which a matrix inversion was so clearly used. Once I saw it, matrix inversion - which had been something that I simply learned to do so that I could pass the tests - took on a completely new meaning for me.    I hope that my example may shed some light on the subject for you.|`|enAUWCwlaa	really no idea|`|qmZZFpzpaa	You should you study inverse of matrix?
