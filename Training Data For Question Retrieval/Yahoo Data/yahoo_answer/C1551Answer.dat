8de3e8da314ebb3462f60abf869531f8aa	AMISH>Ontario, Canada that are known for their plain dress and limited use of modern devices such as automobiles and electricity. The Amish separate themselves from mainstream society for religious reasons: they do not join the military, they draw no Social Security, nor do they accept any form of financial assistance from the government, and many avoid insurance. Most speak a German dialect known as Pennsylvania Dutch (or Pennsylvania German) at home and in church services, and learn English in school. The Amish are divided into separate fellowships consisting of geographical districts or congregations. Each district is fully independent and has its own Ordnung, or set of unwritten rules. This article primarily discusses the conservative Old Order Amish fellowships that observe strict regulations on dress, behavior, and the use of technology. There are many New Order Amish and Beachy Amish groups that use electricity and automobiles, but still consider themselves Amish.  MENNONITES: The dress code has many reasons? behind it. Like the hair covering the women have to wear. They have to wear this because of 1 Corinthians 2. This says that women who pray with their head uncovered dishonor their heads and god. They take a lot of scripture literally. Here are some other parts of dress that they have to follow. First of all there are two parts of the Mennonites and the way they dress. They are the conservative and the liberal. For instance, the band in the front of the hair covering showed how strict or liberal you were. If the band was wide you were more conservative. If it was smaller you were more liberal. If you wore black stockings you were more conservative. If you wore tan stockings you were more liberal, and if you wore stockings without seams in them you were very liberal. If girls part their hair in the middle you were more conservative, and if you parted it on the side you were more liberal. Now for the men. They wore what were called plain suits. They had no lapels and had buttons all the way down the middle of the jacket. Then if you wanted to wear a tie you could wear a bow tie, but no long tie. That was too worldly. They wore no jewelry and no makeup also.   A lot of time relationships in Mennonite families are more caring and at the same time reserved. The parents are very calm, passive, and there is no voice raising. They are not very affectionate though. There is no I love you?, hugging, kissing, etc.|`|762d085da61909919ac6eac86711fc50aa	They both wear very modest clothing,but I think many Amish groups (like the Old Order Amish) are stricter than the Mennonites in regards to what is acceptable.|`|AA10121644	I dont know.......Im thinking the same thing as you!

A Mara la respeto pero no rezo a ella porque si puedo dirigirme a Dios para qu necesito dirigirme a alguien que solo es humano.

Por ejemplo  cuando llega uno tarde a la casa por haberse quedado jugando al futbol en la calle y que Mama te   pregunta Por que no llegabas ja ja ja , o como cuando   llegamos mas tarde de la hora en que dijimos, hacen eso  porque tienen autoridad sobre sus hijos, si asi no fuera no podrian cuestionar nuestras acciones.  como conclusion se cree que la intercesion de la Virgen es poderosa porque si Jesus es el mejor hijo del mundo seguramente no se va a negar a lo que le pida su Mama.  Nota-La Biblia no es la unica y maxima autoridad lo primero es la Sagrada tradicion apostolica o sea la Doctrina.|`|f6f073d485024f47ef295d473aede96baa	No sae quien te dijo que Mara es mayor que Dios!!

El evangelio de Juan nos dice sobre eso lo siguiente:   Jess, viendo a su madre y junto a ella al discpulo a quien amaba, dice a su madre: ?Mujer, ah tienes a tu hijo.? Luego dice al discpulo: ?Ah tienes a tu madre.? Y desde aquella hora el discpulo la acogi en su casa.   Jn 19,26-27   Si lees atentamente el pasaje anterior notars que Jesucristo dice a su discpulo: Ah tienes a tu madre. No es a cualquier persona sino al discpulo al que le dijo esas palabras. Es el autntico discpulo de Cristo quien al igual que el apstol Juan hoy acepta a Mara como Madre. En Juan encontramos el modelo de todo discpulo que acepta este regalo de Jess. En la Cruz, en esos ltimos momentos, cuando l sabe que va a partir, es cuando Nuestro Se?or delante de todos deja como testamento espiritual para todo discpulo cristiano un regalo especial: Ah tienes a tu madre. Bendita seas Mara, Madre de la Iglesia, Madre ma y Madre nuestra.   Un momento despus notamos la actitud del discpulo. Juan, sin vacilar, escribe lo que ese da l mismo haba hecho: El discpulo se la llev a su casa. Como no recordarlo y ponerlo dentro de la Buena Nueva que estaba escribiendo en su Evangelio. El mismo lo dijo: Este es el discpulo que da testimonio de estas cosas y que las ha escrito, y nosotros sabemos que su testimonio es verdadero. Jn 21,24   Juan era el mas joven de todos los apstoles y lo escribe porque para l, eso era un motivo de alegra y gozo que no poda callar. Que fcil hubiera sido para el no escribir eso a?os despus. Si l hubiera tenido las ideas de algunos evanglicos actuales seguramente que nunca hubiera escrito eso. Pero no, para Juan el tener a Mara como madre no era motivo de vergenza ni de quitar mritos a Jesucristo. Para l eso fue algo tan grande y valioso que no olvido ponerlo en su Evangelio.   Juan haba escrito: Hay adems otras muchas cosas que hizo Jess. Si se escribieran una por una, pienso que ni todo el mundo bastara  para contener los libros que se escribieran. Jn 21,25   Si al terminar su Evangelio l claramente afirm que muchas cosas que Jesucristo haba hecho no las haba escrito, eso quera decir que solamente escribi lo que realmente era importante. No iba a desperdiciar su mensaje con cosas sin importancia. Solamente puso aquello que mereca ser mencionado, aunque tendra que dejar sin escribir muchas cosas que el mismo Jess haba hecho. Pues bien, unas de esas palabras tan valiosas fueron:   Jess, viendo a su madre y junto a ella al discpulo a quien amaba, dice a su madre: ?Mujer, ah tienes a tu hijo.? Luego dice al discpulo: ?Ah tienes a tu madre.? Y desde aquella hora el discpulo la acogi en su casa.   Jn 19,26-27   Es por eso que hoy, igual que ese da, el verdadero discpulo de Cristo hace lo mismo que Juan, se lleva a Mara a su casa. Bendita seas madre santa, porque podemos tener la misma alegra de Juan de poder llevarte y tenerte en nuestra casa.   Adems, si la Biblia ense?a que hay que honra a tu Padre y a tu Madre Lc 18,20  Eso es lo que seguramente hizo Juan y nos puso con ello el ejemplo de Honrar a Mara. Con esa actitud Juan fue un buen catlico.   Al parecer muchos hermanos separados ya olvidaron lo que dice el libro de Levtico:   Moiss y los ancianos de Israel dieron al pueblo esta orden: ?Guardad todos los mandamientos que yo os prescribo  hoy. Maldito quien desprecie a su padre o a su madre. - Y todo el pueblo dir: Amn.  Dt 27, 1.16   De nuestra parte como catlicos y como hijos suyos, tambin le honramos y amamos(Lc 18,20).   Gracias Apstol Juan por darnos el ejemplo de amor a la Virgen como una madre espiritual del verdadero discpulo de Jesucristo. Esta es la primera razn bblica por la cual nosotros tambin lo hacemos as.   2.- El ngel, enviado por Dios, le dice: Algrate, llena de Gracia, el Se?or esta contigo. Bendita tu entre las mujeres.   Al sexto mes fue enviado por Dios el ngel Gabriel a una ciudad de Galilea, llamada Nazareth, a una virgen desposada con un hombre llamado Jos, de la casa de David; el nombre de la virgen era Mara. Y entrando, le dijo: ?Algrate, llena de gracia, el Se?or est contigo. Bendita tu entre las mujeres? Lc 1,26-28.                                                         Que maravillosa es la Palabra de Dios al mostrarnos esto con tanta claridad. La Biblia nos dice que el ngel es enviado por Dios para reafirmarlo, pues la palabra ngel significa mensajero. Si era enviado por Dios no poda equivocarse de ninguna manera y sus palabras a la Virgen Mara son tal y como hoy nosotros le llamamos:   Algrate, llena de gracia, el Se?or est contigo. Bendita tu entre las mujeres   En las Biblias de versiones protestantes dice exactamente lo mismo. Bendito seas ngel de Dios que no tuviste ningn problema en decir estas palabras y reconocer la grandeza de Dios en esta santa mujer. Cuando hoy en da hay muchos que dicen ser cristianos y le preguntan al catlico que porque alabamos a la Virgen hacen eso porque al parecer no estn leyendo atentamente la Biblia o no la quieren aceptar. Bendecir a la Virgen Mara es algo que nos puso como ejemplo el mensajero de Dios.   Imagina lo siguiente por unos segundos: Si Dios hubiera enviado ese da a una catlico a darle el anuncio a la Virgen, esta persona hubiera hecho lo mismo que el ngel, hubiera saludado a Mara y la hubiera alabado dicindole Bendita tu entre las mujeres. En cambio si en ese da hubiera enviado a una persona con ideas protestantes ni hubiera hecho lo mismo ni siquiera algo parecido. Hubiera dicho algo as como: hola mujer como cualquier ot|`|HIOMXIjBaa	oye varon... soy un cristiano independiente pero fiel estudiante de las escrituras.

Esta es una de las obras maestras de la gran ramera.  Muchos eruditos catolicos dicen que debe ser de la misma altura que Dios mismo, pero examinemos: Maria era una joven israelita comun y corriente como nosotros, y cuando el arcngel Gabriel se le apareci y le di la impactante noticia, se espanto, y le pregunto que por que a ella, pero el le dijo que habia hallado gracia delante de los ojos de su creador, por lo que ella respondi que se hiciese la voluntad del Todopoderoso en su obra.    Maria, a pesar de que concibi a su creador, ella tambien tenia que aceptar a Cristo como su unico y suficiente salvador, por que era pecadora, a pesar de que andaba conforme al corazn de Jehova.

Cette expression contient un adjectif compos qui est extrait d'une locution parfois encore employe "cultiver, aimer... la petite fleur bleue".    Dans le langage des fleurs, le bleu pale exprime une tendresse inavoue, discrte et idale.    Il faut remonter  1811 et  une oeuvre du jeune crivain allemand Novalis (), qui tait en ralit le baron Friedrich von Hardenberg, pour trouver l'origine de cette expression.  Dans son roman inachev "Henri d'Ofterdingen" (Novalis est mort  29 ans), il y voque  sa manire la lgende d'un trouvre mdival qui, parti  la recherche d'un idal, dcouvre la fleur bleue symbole de la posie.  Les Allemands parlent d'ailleurs de "die blaue Blume der Romantik" ou "la fleur bleue du romantique".

It is not hard to imagine why this culture we have in America values "owning" good things.     The people who you mention that live in West L.A. don't have to show off what they have because they have always had it. The people in South-Central or the Southeast will do it because they were not born into wealth or money so the minute they "get" something they will show it off.

Primero que nada consideremos esto. Si una persona se opone hasta a la posibilidad de que haya un Dios, entonces cualquier evidencia puede ser descartada. Es como si alguien se rehusara a creer que el hombre ha caminado en la luna. De este modo ninguna cantidad de informacin va a cambiar su forma de pensar. Las filmaciones de los astronautas caminando en la luna, las entrevistas a estos astronautas, las rocas lunares... toda esta evidencia no tendra ningn valor porque esta persona ya ha decidido que el hombre no puede ir a la luna.    Cuando se habla de la posibilidad de la existencia de Dios, la Biblia dice que hay personas que han visto suficiente evidencia, pero que han ocultado la verdad acerca de El. En cambio para aquellos que quieren saber si Dios est all, l dice, "Me buscarn y me encontrarn, cuando me busquen de todo corazn." Antes de ver los hechos que rodean la existencia de Dios, pregntate, "Si Dios existe ?lo querra yo conocer?" Aqu entonces hay algunas razones que apoyan la existencia de Dios.    atravs de la historia, en todas las culturas del mundo, la gente ha sido convencida de que hay un Dios.    Podra alguien decir con toda confianza que toda esa gente ha estado equivocada? Billones de personas que representan diferentes crculos sociolgicos, intelectuales, educacionales. todos llegaron a la misma conclusin de que hay un creador, un Dios para adorar.    "Investigaciones antropolgicas han indicado que incluso entre la gente ms remota y primitiva que existe hoy da, hay una creencia universal en Dios. Entre las historias y leyendas ms antiguas de personas alrededor del mundo el concepto original era de que hay un Dios, quien era creador. Un Dios supremo original parece haber estado alguna vez en sus conciencias incluso en aquellas sociedades que hoy en da son politestas."      La complejidad de nuestro planeta se?ala a un dise?ador intencional que no slo cre el universo sino que tambin lo sustenta hoy en da.  Podramos se?alar un sin fin de ejemplos acerca del dise?o de Dios. Sin embargo aqu hay slo algunos:    La Tierra...es del tama?o perfecto. El tama?o de la Tierra y su gravedad correspondiente contienen una delgada capa compuesta mayoritariamente de nitrgeno y oxigeno que se extiende a 80 kilmetros sobre la superficie de la Tierra. Si la Tierra fuera ms peque?a, sera imposible que sta tuviera atmsfera, como es el caso del planeta Mercurio. Si la Tierra fuera ms grande, su atmsfera contendra hidrgeno libre, como Jpiter. La Tierra es el nico planeta conocido equipado con una atmsfera compuesta por una mezcla adecuada de gases que sustentan a las plantas, animales y seres humanos.    La Tierra est ubicada a una distancia adecuada del sol. Considere las temperaturas que van aproximadamente de -35o C a 50o C. Si la Tierra estuviera un poco ms lejos del sol, todos nos congelaramos. Si estuviera un poco ms cerca, nos quemaramos. Incluso una peque?a variacin en la posicin de la Tierra con respeto del sol hara imposible la vida sobre la Tierra. La Tierra permanece a una distancia perfecta del sol mientras rota alrededor de l a una velocidad cerca de 107.000 kilmetros por hora. sta tambin rota sobre su eje, permitiendo que toda la superficie de la Tierra sea perfectamente calentada y enfriada cada da.    Nuestra luna es de un tama?o perfecto y esta a la distancia perfecta para la atraccin gravitacional de la Tierra. Tambin la luna produce las mareas y los movimientos de los ocanos de tal manera que las aguas no se estanquen, y al mismo tiempo evitando que estas mismas inunden los continentes.    Agua...incolora, inodora y sin sabor, y sin embargo ningn ser viviente puede vivir sin ella. Las plantas, los animales y los seres humanos estn compuestos en su mayora por agua (aproximadamente dos tercios del cuerpo humano est compuesto por agua). Ahora veremos porque las caractersticas del agua son nicas y especiales para la vida:    Tiene un inusual punto de ebullicin y de congelamiento. El agua nos permite vivir en un ambiente de temperaturas cambiantes, manteniendo nuestros cuerpos a una temperatura de 37o. El agua es un disolvente universal. Si tomamos un vaso lleno de agua y a?adimos una taza de azcar, nada se derrama; el agua simplemente absorbe el azcar. Esta propiedad del agua hace que miles de qumicos, minerales y nutrientes puedan ser transportados a travs de nuestros cuerpos y hasta nuestro torrente sanguneo    El agua tambin es qumicamente inerte. Sin afectar la composicin, de las substancias que transporta el agua permite que el cuerpo absorba la comida, las medicinas y los minerales, que son tiles para su funcionamiento. El agua tiene una sin igual propiedad que hace que en las plantas esta pueda fluir hacia arriba a pesar de la gravedad lo que ayuda a transportar agua y nutrientes hasta la copa de los rboles ms altos. El agua se congela de arriba hacia abajo y flota de tal manera que los peces pueden sobrevivir en el invierno.    Noventa y siete por ciento del agua de la Tierra se encuentra en los ocanos. Sin embargo en la Tierra existe un sistema que sustrae la sal del agua y luego la distribuye por todo el planeta. La evaporacin saca el agua de los ocanos, dejando la sal, y formando nubes las cuales son fcilmente transportadas por el viento para que dispersen agua sobre la tierra, para la vegetacin, los animales y la gente. Este es un sistema de purificacin y abastecimiento que sustenta la vida del planeta, es un sistema de agua reciclada y re-usada.    vez ahora mismo lo ests pensando, "la ciencia no ha comprobado la existencia de Dios", o "ninguna prueba cientfica dice que Dios existe".

279da6ed3dd73479e268ec1ca52d40ffaa	God gave as a miracle to Moses his staff which changed into a serpent and also to divide the Red Sea, and likewise Jesus was able to cure lepers and the blind and also give back life to a bird.    To Muhammad (pbuh) God gave the grandest of miracles, to this illiterate Arab, the miracle of the Holy Koran, thus Muhammad (pbuh) could recite by heart all of God's commandments through the tongue of the Archangel Gabriel.     It has been said even the greatest of Arab poets were rendered speechless when Muhammad (pbuh) started reciting verses of the Holy Koran, and poetry was big amongst the feudal Arabs, at those times.    For your information, the Holy Koran was only compiled into written form during the reign of the 3rd Caliph Uthman ibn Affan after the death of the great prophet, as more of the great Hafizs (those who memorize the contents of the Koran) met death due to wars or old age. Hence came the Holy Koran into written form, and improved greatly under the auspices of the great Caliph Umar Al Khattab.    Allahu Alam|`|hCuqb8iBaa	Don't compare a prophet with your stupid brain...

Infact many muslims have the Quran memorized in it's entirety. That is one of the many miracles of the Quran, that it can be memorized and repeated word for word. People who have never uttered a word of Arabic have been able to memorize whole surahs of the Quran after only having read and or heard it a couple of times.|`|c797a78f452ce436ff369727fb8e0d04aa	when i get back from 7/11 i will let you know

I have  addressed this before, and I think it bears re-  peating, I would rather (now,speaking only for  myself,) believe in 'afterlife' w/ an eternal loving  Creator, then to go into endless 'oblivion' think  about it?

This year alone there are three special campaigns that include extending an invitation to our meetings.    When you go you will find honest and humble people striving to worship God as God has commanded.    We do not pass a collection plate around,  The most you will hear about the congregation's money is an expense report, and a letter of thanks.    It is best if you bring a bible along because our meetings are designed as bible studies, and not just a few minutes 'feel good talk'.  (and we don't care which version of the bible you use)    In most areas two or three congregations share the same building, so you can find a meeting that meets your schedule.    If you didn't receive the last two invitations, we still have a third special campaign coming.    Of course you don't have to wait for that invite, you can come anytime you wish.    Hope to see ya there.    agape.

If you truly are emotionally disturbed or depressed its not a light matter. You should talk to somebody you trust and maybe see your doctor for anti depressents. I doubt that everybod that thinks theyre "emo" has emotional problems. Half of those teens just want to be "scene" and in the trend because theyre having issues with life, but you know what, EVERYBODY has problems. Being trendinly "emo" doesnt increase your chances for popularity and a real adult that has gone through teenage years wont take you seriously. If your smart you will deal with life.

Adolf Hitler naci en Braunau am Inn, una peque?a aldea cerca de Linz en la provincia de la Alta Austria, no muy lejos de la frontera alemana, en lo que entonces era el Imperio Austrohngaro.

Cinco a?os despus de tener a su hijo, Maria Anna Schicklgruber se cas con Johann Georg Hiedler. Al poco tiempo, el hermano de Johann, Nepomuk, llev a Alois a vivir con su familia. Su infancia la pas en Linz, donde fue al mismo colegio que Ludwig Wittgenstein, y su juventud en Viena.  En 1876, cuando haca a?os que Mara y Georg haban fallecido, Nepomuk, quien haba ejercido de padre adoptivo, dio su apellido a Alois, haciendo constar en el registro bautismal a Georg Hiedler como padre legtimo. Ms tarde, Adolf Hitler sera acusado por sus enemigos polticos de no ser legtimamente Hitler, sino Schicklgruber.

Cinco a?os despus de tener a su hijo, Maria Anna Schicklgruber se cas con Johann Georg Hiedler. Al poco tiempo, el hermano de Johann, Nepomuk, llev a Alois a vivir con su familia. Su infancia la pas en Linz, donde fue al mismo colegio que Ludwig Wittgenstein, y su juventud en Viena.    En 1876, cuando haca a?os que Mara y Georg haban fallecido, Nepomuk, quien haba ejercido de padre adoptivo, dio su apellido a Alois, haciendo constar en el registro bautismal a Georg Hiedler como padre legtimo. Ms tarde, Adolf Hitler sera acusado por sus enemigos polticos de no ser legtimamente Hitler, sino Schicklgruber. Su madre, Klara Hitler (nombre de soltera Klara P?lzl), era a su vez tambin prima segunda de su padre. Klara tuvo seis hijos; Adolf fue el segundo y, junto con su hermana menor Paula, el nico que sobrevivi a la infancia.

5c43b8dc059622facc8215f892688643aa	There is only one true God. Humanity was created to love and worship this one and only God. A false idol is a false god create by humanity to substitute for the real thing. A false idol takes the place God in the person's life.    In God's eyes, this could be anything that assumes His role as the supreme authority of your life. For instance, let's say you give all your love and worship to a woman. She then becomes a false idol. Or, let's say you give all your love and worship to yourself. Then you become a false idol. Anything that you allow to take the place in your life where God should be is a false idol.|`|KgYIYXEtaa	'False idol' is a term used by the figurehead of a religion to describe the figurehead of any other religion.|`|vNn6Kcxkaa	The temple of God can not harbor worship of false idols.  A "false idol" is worship of a created object or creation of God. In this country, this is a huge problem. Another word is worship of "mammon", which is wealth.
AA11538639	The word exotic has evolved thru the years...  Exotic like beauty is relative and lies on the eye of the beholder.    What is beautiful & exotic to me may not be to you.    Q 2 & 3. yes it matters by those you describe and location.  according to it's meaning, as long as it looks foreign, unusual, uncommon then it is "exotic".    more info:    exotic   [ig-zot-ik]    adjective   1. of foreign origin or character; not native; introduced from abroad, but not fully naturalized or acclimatized: exotic foods; exotic plants.    2. strikingly unusual or strange in effect or appearance: an exotic hairstyle.    3. of a uniquely new or experimental nature: exotic weapons.    4. of, pertaining to, or involving stripteasing: the exotic clubs where strippers are featured.      noun   5. something that is exotic: The flower show included several tropical exotics with showy blooms.    6. an exotic dancer; stripper.    **************************************...    EXOTIC      Foreign, unusual, unique (in a good way). Usually directed at something fresh, new, different, and cool.    Often refers to erotic dancing, but can refer to anything that seems foreign or unusual to the observer.    A language like English or Spanish will come to a point where they are pretty much same-old, same-old, and no longer exotic. They're still foreign, beautiful... but too common.    The minority languages in Europe, the Middle-East, Asia, and the like, are quite exotic.

Muslim women are allowed to go to the mosque.  Women usually pray behind the men or on the second floor of the mosque.  The reason for  is that islamic prayer involves prostration, so the worshipper ends up with his or her rear end up in the air and certain times.  So the women get to see the men's rear ends but not the other way around.  This way the women can be comfortable, and hopefully the men can stop thinking about sex for like 2 minutes while they pray.    Unfortunately, certain rediculous countries, such as Saudi, give the women little or no space in the mosque.  This is wrong.  It's another tactic to keep women powerless in a backwards society.|`|kcNHcC2Eaa	Islam is a superior religion for men. If you are an islamic women since your brain is washed all about " sex is bad !, sex is sin ! " and only women are accused as the main reason immorality of the society. They are presented as the main reason of evil's existance. Thats the main reason why all women's hair are covered by TURBAN is; In accordance with  the prophet Muhammad's fictious sayings/deeds, which are made up 400 years after Muhammed's death, if women's  single hair is seen by any male, the women will be judged by 77 years pain of hell for each single hair that is seen.    For your informaition, Muhammed was used the tear the things written after he talked when he was alive. Therefore all his sayings when he was alive are actually fictous as he didnt want his sayings would be compiting to Muslim's main book Kuran.    Today's Islamic religion as it is implemented today is totally against real words and meaning of Kuran. Islam today needs revision at all. And, Revision is not againts Kuran as well but, it is against arabic traditions which are implemented even before Muhammed's birth. Arabic traditions are totaly againt ?slam and these traditions diverts the main reason of Kuran's Islam's existance to violence of arabic nation. I beleive all  arabs divert and use Islam for their own nation's false purposes. Arabs are disliked amoung Islams but, since they are muslims they are accepted as they are in the islamic society. Please help us to get rid of all dirty arabs in this world !|`|818cb06a54ddea43accdd20cff54cd3faa	They are.

Think about it.    She knew if she touched him she would be healed.  So she must have heard about him?  She must have heard what he was saying.    Being a walking embodiment of Faith, Jesus rightly called her Daughter, because He was certainly her Father in Spirit.      Insofar as the Trinity, you must start with One.  Then, as differentiation occurs, you will see Three Distinct Principles at work as one Principle.  It is encrypted in the 47th Prob of Euclid or the Pythagorean Theorem or Carpenter's Theorem.    But for your question:  Understand that Jesus is representative of Mankind.  So, since Jesus is in you and you are one with Jesus, Then it follows that you Are The Son.     The Three becomes one when you change your Spirit to match the spirit of Universal Progress and Order.  This is the Holy spirit which comes about when you put on the New Man....The New man being representitive of Jesus.    Keep askin questions though.    the answer you seek will come to you.    ORDO ab CHAO|`|53508c26f5cd4045c5bf39c8169c3ffcaa	It is a mystery of the faith.  Somethings just have to be taken as is . If you question it it gets confusing.  God is in all places in all things At all times.  If you dwell in the Spirit the Spirit will dwell in you. Jesus was one with God He lived in the Father and the Father Dwelt with in Him.  Jesus is divine I'm sure He knew who touched Him the moment he laid eyes on the woman He WAS one with God and God sees us all.  Please speak with your church leader about any confusion you probably wont find a good explanation here.|`|okREfm8Iaa	You see this is so easy:    Christians worship ONE GOD.    The father is a full GOD.  The son is a full GOD.  The holy spirit is a full GOD.  They ALL Co-Exist at the same time, they talk to each others.    At the end, it is only one GOD.    This is a matter of Hell or Heaven, so you have to shut down your brain and put your life on the line.|`|AA10565630	Jesus temporarily put his divinity so many things in his human nature he did not know.

Because 13 is a spiritual power number. With Christ and the Disciples there were 13.  Fires used to break out unexpectedly on 13th floors. As the buildings actually are at a higher elevation and nearer the other-dimensional realities. Of course in our day and age with noise pollution and all. We are not as in touch with spiritual things and don't create this phenomenon any more. As we created it with our misguided spiritual energies.  There are lost souls everywhere. As they usually become lost due to a trauma that ocurs when a human dies suddenly and violently, and they just don't realize they are no longer part of this reality.|`|8yyWasecaa	Yes, in San Antonio there are.

Obviously you cannot love your gay neighbour and stone them to death (it also says only cast the first stone if you're without sin so that again makes it impossible to interpret literally).|`|f313dd25768de3544bf5ac018552bf2caa	There are no contradictions in the Bible. If you think you have found one there is another way to understand the passage(s). The Bible has a theme which runs from front to back. <br>  <br>  The keys to understanding the Bible:<br>  <br>  1- never pull a scripture out of context...understand the context...who is talking... who are they talking to....what is going on etc<br>  <br>  2- whatever understanding is drawn from any passage(s) needs to be in harmony with the entire Bible.

His mission, death and resurrection fulfilled that law (which is why the Sabbath moved from Saturday to Sunday).  So if the blood of sacrificed beasts were meant to cleanse one from sin, the perfect blood of Christ can only be an improvement upon that, and his Atoning sacrifice must be what brings us hope and further elevates our commitment to serve Our Heavenly Father.  His death made it so that animal sacrifice was no longer necessary.|`|59f0d623da24062341c864749a68da9daa	Okay, I think we always have to read Bible verses in context.  When I look at the rest of chapter nine, the purpose seems (like much of Hebrews, as I recall) to be a message to the Jews of the time, showing how the mysteries of Judaism are linked and lead to the mysteries of Christianity.  Just before these verses, the author is describing how the Holy Temple was constructed, and the rituals used for regular and yearly purification.  Paul then talks here about the Jewish practice of using sacrificed animal blood as a tool of purification, as ordered by God in ancient times.  Since the author believes that Jesus' sacrifice (a sacrifice of blood infinitely more pure than that of animals) not only takes the place of the animals sacrifices of the past, but, in fact purifies believers in ways that were previously impossible.  Again, prior to this, the author talks about how the prior rituals were merely placeholders until a perfect sacrifice could be offered that would truly cleanse the world.|`|vvgodUChaa	it it showing blood covenant of the law sanctify to the cleaning of the flesh,how much value the blood of christ cleanse  our couscience and takes away all sin for ever never to see them again,now we can serve him in a new and living way,thanking him for all he has done and allow him to lead us into all truth, hope this helps!|`|5110a754f0890492a3b2aff5b1ac5578aa	In the old testament (before Jesus Christ came, died and rose again) there was a requirement that blood sacrifices (bulls, goats and heifers) would make God satisfied and He would forgive sins.<br>  <br>  Now Jesus is the ultimate sacrifice for the forgiving of sin since  HE was without any sins Himself.  Never did ONE sin he didn't.  Not one.<br>  <br>  SSSoooooooo<br>  <br>  God the Father was able to be satisfied that THAT sacrifice of Jesus would do for everyone to come (and those of the past too.) <br>  <br>  So you see the "how much more" verse.  In the old testament they had to go on and on killing bulls etc and giving up their animals for the cleansing of sin.<br>  <br>  BUT JESUS was IT.  Forever.  No more need of sacrifice of animals.<br>  <br>  You can accept this if you will.  accept that Jesus is the answer to your own sin question.  Get forgiveness and a place in heaven by believing that the problem of MY sin and yours has been remedied.|`|F7y1BZ4Maa	I think this will help--<br>  <br>  Hebrews 9:11–15, 23–28. <br>  <br>  The Role of Jesus Christ <br>  as High Priest Mediator of the <br>  NewTestament<br>  <br>  Jesus performed essentially the same function for us<br>  which ancient priests did for Israel: he atoned for our<br>  sins. There is a difference, however, between the two<br>  offerings: ancient priests offered up goats or lambs<br>  from Israel’s flocks; Christ, the purest “Lamb of<br>  God” (John 1:29, 36), offered up himself. No man<br>  took Christ’s life from him; the Savior gave it up<br>  voluntarily (John 10:18). Thus, Jesus was not only the<br>  high priest for us in the making of the offering; he was<br>  also the very offering himself! This is what Paul<br>  wishes us to see. Christ is the mediator of the New<br>  Testament as ancient priests were mediators of the Old<br>  Testament, or law of Moses. Jesus came “to put away<br>  sin by the sacrifice of himself.” (Hebrews 9:26.) As<br>  the ancient high priest entered into the Holy of Holies<br>  on earth and sprinkled the goat’s blood upon the<br>  mercy-seat, so Jesus Christ entered the sacred<br>  sanctuary of heaven itself, there to intercede before the<br>  Father in behalf of those whose penitence makes<br>  them eligible for his act of mercy (Hebrews 9:11–15,<br>  23–25).|`|rWP4suXuaa	The sacrifice of animals in the old testament what just a shadow of what was to come in christ jesus.<br>  <br>  <br>  God loves you...God bless|`|0a35bd8efe64caf91fcf1e0cf5d79e07aa	It does not really mean much at all until you read Hebrews 9:15 with it. The blood of the new covenant cleanses us so that we are fit to serve God. Bless you.|`|sKYqdaToaa	There is only one thing that can cleanse sin, blood, life for life. Before Christ came to save us once and for all, the way to do that was with the blood of specific animals and burnt offerings.  The verse is saying that the blood of "imperfect" animals cleanses you for a time but another sacrifice will be needed because we will sin again. But, with the cleansing blood of the perfect Christ who gave Himself freely as a sacrifice, we only need to believe in Jesus and all His claims about Himself and we will be forever cleansed of our sins.  When this happens we become servants of God by the Spirit of Christ who abides in our hearts.  i hope this helps.|`|4qfh2m0haa	I believe it is talking about the punishments in hell. And how humans are irresponsible in their acts, and that we are disobedient and yet un-assertive for Jesus' sacrifices. And it goes on about how Jesus gave himself up - the ultimate pledge, to clear our hearts and 'ressurect' us *i.e. born-again* into serving God.<br>  <br>  Also, I am appalled by the maturity levels of those people lividly insulting anothers' beliefs. Fellow answers, in what instance did the question make any overt attempt to offend you? What did the question do you wrong? Assuming you are atheists, why don't you respect other faiths? You know what, if there was many-a-reason in my armory of not being an atheist - people with mentalities like you just proved it..<br>  I'm a muslim, yet I tried to level-headedly offer my best in terms of not only religion but on the grounds of an exchange of opinion. <br>  I guess in evaluations, people need to respect others' faiths.|`|nURoPCPzaa	Human sacrifice is worth more than animal.

But these are illusions that must be seen to be such and Jesus can help us now to see through them, but his act did not remove them from our consciousness.|`|PJZRGsc3aa	nothing|`|X9rXRNUxaa	The Holy Ghost further signified and showed what was the efficacy of the blood of the Old Testament sacrifices, and thence is inferred the much greater efficacy of the blood of Christ. (1.) The efficacy of the blood of the legal sacrifices extended to the purifying of the flesh (Heb_9:13): it freed the outward man from ceremonial uncleanness and from temporal punishment, and entitled him to, and fitted him for, some external privileges. (2.) He infers very justly hence the far greater efficacy of the blood of Christ (Heb_9:14): How much more shall the blood of Christ, etc. Here observe, [1.] What it was that gave such efficacy to the blood of Christ. First, It was his offering himself to God, the human nature upon the altar of his divine nature, he being priest, altar, and sacrifice, his divine nature serving for the two former, and his human nature for the last; now such a priest, altar, and sacrifice, could not but be propitiatory. Secondly, It was Christ's offering up himself to God through the eternal Spirit, not only as the divine nature supported the human, but the Holy Ghost, which he had without measure, helping him in all, and in this great act of obedience offering himself. Thirdly, It was Christ's offering himself to God without spot, without any sinful stain either in his nature or life; this was conformable to the law of sacrifices, which required them to be without blemish. Now further observe, [2.] What the efficacy of Christ's blood is; it is very great. For, First, It is sufficient to purge the conscience from dead works, it reaches to the very soul and conscience, the defiled soul, defiled with sin, which is a dead work, proceeds from spiritual death, and tends to death eternal. As the touching of a dead body gave a legal uncleanness, so meddling with sin gives a moral and real defilement, fixes it in the very soul; but the blood of Christ has efficacy to purge it out. Secondly, It is sufficient to enable us to serve the living God, not only by purging away that guilt which separates between God and sinners, but by sanctifying and renewing the soul through the gracious influences of the Holy Spirit, purchased by Christ for this purpose, that we might be enabled to serve the living God in a lively manner.<br>  <br>  May God bless you as you study His Word<br>  <br>  <:)))><|`|8pQrIL90aa	Ahh yes my friend the blood of goats and bulls were but a outward covering of sins momentarily used until that blessed,spotless lamb of God came down to sacrifice himself for the sake of mankind. By doing this he drew all men to himself changing the law by fulfilling it, after the malicious treatment of that which he perished for,  now sitting up high sending down below that glorious spirit of power unto men that will purge you, cleanse you and sanctify you for his own use.<br>  Amen. How blessed is this country, to let us serve that One true living GOD. I cannot repay. I can only serve. God bless.|`|6RCHJQfQaa	let's paraphrase this in modern language..."so if you think the sacrifices of goats and bulls cleansed you from you sins, it is nothing compared to what the blood of jesus Christ has done".

The same people who enslaved black Africans and propagated theories of eugenics and scientific racism in the 19th and 20th centuries also believed they represented 'progress'.

rWP4suXuaa	We assume that there were three wise men because of the three gifts that were given: gold, incense, and myrrh (Matthew 2:11). However, the Bible does not say there were only three wise men. There could have been many more. Tradition says that there were three and that their names were Gaspar, Melchior, and Balthasar, but since the Bible does not say, we have no way of knowing whether the tradition is accurate.<br>  <br>  It is a common misconception that the wise men visited Jesus at the stable on the night of His birth. In fact, the wise men came days, months, or possibly even years later. That is why Matthew 2:11 says the wise men visited and worshiped Jesus in a house, not at the stable. <br>  <br>  We know that the magi were wise men from "the East," most likely Persia, or modern-day Iran. This means the wise men traveled 800 to 900 miles to see the Christ child. Most likely, the magi knew of the writings of the prophet Daniel, who in time past had been the chief of the court seers in Persia. Daniel 9:24-27 includes a prophecy which gives a timeline for the birth of the Messiah. Also, the magi may have been aware of the prophecy of Balaam (who was from the town of Pethor on the Euphrates River near Persia) in Numbers 24:17. Balaam's prophecy specifically mentions a “star coming out of Jacob.” <br>  <br>  The wise men were guided to look for the King of the Jews by a miraculous stellar event, the "Star of Bethlehem," which they called "His star" (Matthew 2:2). They consulted with King Herod in Jerusalem concerning the birth of Christ and were so directed to Bethlehem (Matthew 2:4-8). They followed God's guidance joyfully (Matthew 2:10). Their gifts for Jesus were costly, and they worshiped Him. God warned them in a dream against returning to Herod, so, in defiance of the king, they left Judea by another route (Matthew 2:12). <br>  <br>  So, the magi were men who 1) read and believed God's Word, 2) sought Jesus, 3) recognized the worth of Christ, 4) humbled themselves to worship Jesus, and 5) obeyed God rather than man. They were truly wise men!|`|TyRfv0eoaa	Scripture does not call them kings, just magi, and does not specify how many. Tradition came up with three, simply because they gave three gifts. But it's by no means certain there were three. There could have been two, or four or more.<br>  <br>  They followed the star to Jerusalem, to the palace of Herod. They knew they were looking for a newborn king, so the palace seemed the logical place to look. There, the scribes told them that Bethlehem was the place, a small town outside Jerusalem. They left Jerusalem, and the star led them to Bethlehem, to the house where he was. (The arrived some months after his birth, so they were no longer in the stable.)|`|78a004f4953e767d0c2c36ffd1bf1c39aa	No one knows, but because of the three gifts the tradition goes three.

The wise men did not get to Christ until he was just around<br>  the age of two;  to find him, they followed a star.

There could<br>  have been two and there could have been four or even five.<br>  <br>  So zero wise men there, and only one king present meaning Christ<br>  himself.|`|ylaGS5EHaa	According to the text they saw a new star and followed it, as well they knew about the prophesies that said he would be born in Bethlehem.

Then one night they saw a new star and it had been profeside (I don't know how to spell that.) that a new king, the greatest of all kings, Lord of lords, would come to earth.

jdRKZe18aa	It's hard to ascertain your exact question in all that - BUT LDS perspective is that God's authority through His holy priesthood has NOT been on the earth until it was restored in the latter days to the church.  Few even consider heavenly 'authority' like LDS do because most who preach & minister are taught & trained in schools for those who want to be paid minister(s) and preach as a trade or career.  We have no paid ministry in our church.  <br>  <br>  We believe all churches contain some truth and much good and many true & honorable christian followers - but we believe that Divine Authority with the laying on of hands (as mentioned in Christ's day in the N.T.) is a key ingredient in Christ's true church.   <br>  <br>  I think people like to demonize the LDS Church because we don't align precisely & exactly with long standing traditions and notions about doctrinal truths.  Claiming, what others view as heretical, that we are the "TRUE CHURCH" and have God's Authority is just too far off the 'beaten" path for many if not most christians.  HOW dare we say & claim & believe the things we do and still claim to be one of them too "Christians".... right?    <br>  <br>  A key tenant of our faith reads as follows: "We claim the priviledge of worshipping Almighty God according to the dictates of our own conscience and afford all men the same right.  Let them worship how, when and what they may."  We really don't judge others' faith.  We also don't condemn others to eternal hell fire for believing differently than us either - but many if not most are more than willing to toss that supposed and lovely "CHRISTIAN" threat at most mormons they meet, which I just don't understand how they justify.   <br>  <br>  We believe that our Loving Heavenly Father will make all things right, judge all men fairly, justly and with great mercy & grace and equity.  It surely won't be all mormons in heaven or living eternally with God - it will be all who know Him, love Him, have sincerely and honorably lived and sought to follow Him and His Son and/or have a pure heart at the judgement seat.  That's my take on the whole thing.... PEACE! : )|`|Lc5FtItDaa	I am not a Mormon, but it doesn't make any sense to me and it wouldn't have made any sense to Luther.<br>  <br>  The Bible clearly says that it is truth that sets you free.  So if you find a greater truth why would you be happy leaving people in relative darkness?  It doesn't make any sense that 'we will all be in heaven together so live in your confusion on earth.  It's surely not my responsibility to help you'.<br>  <br>  I disagree with the Mormon truth.  In fact, I will go so far as calling it a lie, but I admire their dedication to living/sharing it.  If ALL Christians would share their faith that way, the gospel commission would have been fulfilled and Christ will come to take us home.|`|AGKOaVEkaa	Not yet time for them to accept the gospel our missionaries are sharing.|`|2ZO7vFC1aa	Our prior Prophet, President Hinckley often said, "We say to people, you bring all the good that you have and let us see if we can add to it."<br>  <br>  I think it boils down to that.

That's why we're out there sharing our message, even to those that are already Christian.|`|7d16b3b33c15681f9d53425cac12ac67aa	Not sure if there is a question to this. Although you do seem upset to be told by others that your baptism is invalid. <br>  <br>  My own mother who was a convert to the church asked the same question and when answered that her baptism was invalid it was explained that her baptism didn't carry authority.By this we mean the priesthood. LDS believe that the Priesthood was lost with the death of the apostles and prophets and that it was restored later on. It's a different perspective for you to consider.|`|d05b366085d8773ec7654e3ad2b991cdaa	Thank you for your question.  I am sure that many people are a bit in the dark as to why Mormons proselyte so much.<br>  <br>  The reason is that Mormons believe that their church is the restored Church of Jesus Christ, and wish to tell it to all the world, invite them to consider the LDS perspective, claims, etc, and then invite those that show interest to investigate Mormonism through a series of six or seven teaching appointments conducted by a pair of full-time LDS Missionaries.  <br>  <br>  Those that become believers are then baptised as members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints by the same method used in the New Testament by John the Baptiser, Jesus, and His apostles.<br>  <br>  The question of whether a particular baptism is valid or not confuses a lot of people.  Mormon belief about baptism is founded on the belief that baptism is a vital initiatory rite, to which the sinless Jesus submitted himself aty the hands of John, that it must be done in the prescribed way and by one having authority to act in the name of God to administer the ordinances of the gospel of Jesus Christ including water baptism by immersion for the remission of sins.  <br>  <br>  The Mormon position is that the priesthood restored as part of the Restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ is the only authority qualified to administer the saving ordinances.  Therefore, all seeking admission to the Mormon Church are baptised regardless of any prior baptism or christening, like the man in Acts 19 who, when asked, said he had been baptised after the manner of John's baptising, but the apostles knew that an unauthorised impostor had baptised him by total immersion [after the manner of John], because when they asked whether he had received the Holy Spirit since his baptism, he told them that he had never heard of such a thing.<br>  <br>  Yet the Bible is explicit in that John told candidates for baptism, <br>  <br>  "I indeed baptise you with water, but there cometh one after me .... that will baptise you with fire and with the Holy Ghost."<br>  <br>  Since this fellow had not been informed of the Holy Ghost's existence, the apostles concluded that whoever had carried out the ritual was acting without authority, and they baptised him again, using the authority with which Jesus had ordained them, after which they laid their hands upon his head and he received the Holy Ghost.<br>  <br>  As to why most Christians exercise their Christianity outside the Christianity that Mormons exercise within Mormonism, it is my finding - based on years of academic research - that you are correct in your belief that it is because many people see Mormonism as a "dangerous and ungodly cult."<br>  <br>  Whilst the truth is that every form of religious expression can properly be called a cult, it is by dint of many pejorative publications that redefine the word "cult" as a thing of evil, occultic, unchaste, and Satanic.  Yet it is none of these things as thorough investigation reveals.<br>  <br>  Although Mormonism fails the cult test concocted by perjoraters from self-imposed standards to ensure Mormonism does not slip through the tightly woven mesh of their hate nets, that has not eased the increasing numbers of pseudo-ministries, some of which have become para-churches, that continue to publish charges against Mormons, some of which falsehoods are 190 years old, and some of more recent vintage.<br>  <br>  What Mormons find disappointing is the fact that full explanations have been given by Mormon ministers and scholars over more than a century and a half, yet the pseudo-ministries ignore the rebuttals and proofs that are supplied, and proceed as if no answers or rebuttals had ever been made.<br>  <br>  That can be frustrating, as I am sure you can understand.  But, of course, it is more than frustrating (for the very reason you suggest), because those who have no family or friends that are Mormon, the source of their [often false] information is the vast array of anti-Mormon books to be found in Christian bookstores, or through one of the many anti-Mormon ministries.  <br>  <br>  The vast majority of anti-Mormon publications is put together by writers that are too lazy to do their own research, so they plagiarise other anti-Mormon books, slap a new picture on the book's cover, and then pretend it is all their work.<br>  <br>  But, when the foundation is so dishonest, what can the superstructure be expected to be like?<br>  <br>  One such ministry is Sandra Tanner's hostile ministry in Utah.  For many years she has complained about Mormons not having any answer to her 'findings' and her questions.  Her problem is that she will not read Mormon answers to her baseless questions, nor will she accept the reasoned and verifiable apologetic resiources published by LDS members.<br>  <br>  Had she done so, rather, had she been WILLING to do so, then her complaints would have disappeared as morning mists at noon.  'But she would not.'  <br>  <br>  I have no wish to say anything that is unkind or untrue about this Mrs McGregor, but one of the major reasons such ministries as hers flourish is because they are excellent sources of guaranteed and astronomical incomes for years to come.<br>  <br>  It has been the case that occasionally a reader is so horrified by what is written in one of these prevaricating books that they determine to discover for themselves whether there is any truth in the charges, and having closely scrutinised the beliefs and practices of Mormonism, together with its history, have sought membership in the LDS Church.  <br>  <br>  But that does not happen as frequently as the experience in which people are so horrified by such as Ed Decker, Walter R Martin, John Smith, Lori McGregor, et al, that their minds are well mixed and thoroughly set.  Alas<br>  <br>  QUILL<br>  <br>  [truncd by YA 4 bin 2 long]|`|0T3weRh5aa	Personally I don't care what other churches think of us. We believe Joseph Smith through the inspiration of Jesus Christ restored the Gospel of Jesus Christ with all the authority, principles and doctrines.<br>  Why do you care what Mormons think of Lutheran baptisms.<br>  I don't care about what Lutherans think of Mormon baptisms.|`|W9uEeFFsaa	You are worshiping the same Jesus but You're church's doctrines are wrong AND it was started in the Apostasy|`|AA10637643	I sort of don't understand your question... but<br>  <br>  We believe the gospel, in its fullness, was restored to the earth, after a great apostasy prophecied of in the bible.  We believe that pretty much all other churches have parts and pieces of the gospel, just not all of it.  We believe after Christ's apostles died, the Priesthood and many doctrines of the gospel were lost or changed.  Thus, the need for the restoration - which is also prophecied of in the bible.<br>  <br>  The Sisters - I assume LDS missionaries? - said your baptism is invalid.  Well, that's sort of true (like you said from our perspective) because we believe there has to be the proper authority (the Priesthood) to perform ordinances, othewise, any Joe Blow could go baptize someone.  And I just don't believe the Lord works that way.  <br>  <br>  The "big deal" partly is that we are commanded to share the gospel.  Plus, we believe we have the "whole" gospel, whereas other churches do not, and we want to shre the whole thing.  <br>  <br>  I think the common perception of the Church being labeled a cult comes from only one source and that's satan.  He knows the church is true, but he doesn't want others to.  The "cult" label comes from misconceptions, lies, falsehoods, rumors, "urban legends" of sorts, and whatever other slander there is out there.  IF a person would take the time to TRULY look at our DOCTRINE and from the actual source, then ask God what is true, they would no without a doubt, this truly IS Christ's only Church, that He leads and guides it through His chosen prophets and that Joseph Smith DID in fact see God and Christ.  This is what I have done, and I have a sure knowledge these things are true.<br>  <br>  * I just wanted to make one more comment... and this is about the Book of Mormon and the Bible.  It is interesting to me that people are VERY quick to say the Bible is scripture, yet won't even THINK of how the Book of Mormon could be.  Why do you believe in the Bible?  What led you to that decision?  It seems like people "just believe" it because "it's the Bible", not because they truly have asked the Lord IF it is scripture or not... well, that's what we encourage all to do - to ask the Lord what is true, not just "trust US".  Ask the Lord.  He will never lead you astray.|`|K2goXHfIaa	Say a prayer before you go over their house and Heavenly father will help you and you'll know what to say.....HOPE IT HELPS!!!!|`|OLnmXeWDaa	In this survey, 39% of Mormons think there are lots of ways to heaven.

As another answer said, we believe we have the priesthood authority on Earth, to act in God's name and through the power of Jesus Christ. There is a passage in our scriptures that states, "whatsoever is bound in Earth shall be bound in Heaven"... as with baptism, in order for it to be valid and bound in Heaven, it must be done within the priesthood. That is to say, it must be performed by a man who has the gift of the  priesthood, otherwise it does not count in Heaven. <br>  <br>  As to your question about a cult, I have heard many ridiculous reasons for people believing we are a cult: we have horns on our head, we believe in a "Mormon Jesus", we have "magic" underwear, we sacrifice virgins on alters at our Temples, blah blah.  All of these things are of course false. People sometimes fear what they do not understand, and fear often leads to hate. Hate spreads lies and rumors. Most people who say those things have a bone to pick with the church and they turn their personal grudge into a personal crusade against the church. It is unfortunate, but true.|`|yakmXr5Jaa	If I understand your question from the third paragraph, I think the answer lies in our understanding of God's priesthood.<br>  <br>  We believe that God has given specific authority to perform his works on earth (such as baptisms and administering the sacrament or communion), and those are only valid when performed with the proper authority.  Like it says in Hebrews 5, you can't take that authority on yourself.  It has to come from God.|`|ylaGS5EHaa	Oh it makes sense to me, I've been asked it before. I went to the South on my mission, so yeah I get it.<br>  <br>  Anyways, Mormons believe that they have the complete truth as far as it has been revealed. We also believe that the authority to perform the necessary ordinances to get back to God. As so we want others to enjoy the blessing of the full truth and ordinances. That is why we go around. It's not that we want the biggest club, we just want you to enjoy what we have found.<br>  <br>  As a last note I would mention that the way we try to convert is not by trying to convince others that things are true, but by teaching them and then telling them to pray and ask God if is true. I feel that is one of the best parts of our church.

Prior to his election as governor, he was a member of the United States House of Representatives from Louisiana's 1st congressional district, to which he was elected in 2004 to succeed current U.S. Senator David Vitter. Jindal was re-elected to Congress in the 2006 election with 88 percent of the vote.<br>  <br>  On October 20, 2007, Jindal was elected governor of Louisiana, winning a four-way race with 54% of the vote. At age 36, Jindal became the youngest current governor in the United States. He also became the first person not of European ethnicity to serve as governor of Louisiana since P. B. S. Pinchback during Reconstruction; one of fewer than ten people not of primarily European ethnicity elected governor of a state following Reconstruction, and the first Indian American elected to state-wide office in U.S. history. Jindal has been mentioned as a potential candidate in the 2012 United States presidential election.|`|DZCFD0p2aa	Shows how much you know! Jindal is a Sikh name.

cZeAG3sLaa	It's not mardi gra, it's Mardi Gras, which is french for 'Fat Tuesday'.<br>  Mardi Gras is the day before Lent starts. Lent are the 40 days before easter (look it up on wikipedia if you wish).<br>  <br>  Mardi Gras, also called 'Carnaval' was originally a european celebration to scare of evil spirits, celebrate life and a sort of celebration created to replace the pagan celebrations of the time.<br>  The main point of mardi gras is having fun, parades and costumes, it is similar to halloween but with a less dark and scary connotation, since the topic of mardi gras isnt death and darkness but happiness, playful pranks and noise and joy.<br>  In mardi gras, you'll find all sorts of costmes, jokes, parades, music, laughter and other fun things.<br>  <br>  There are several traditions depending on each place (like the porcelain masks in Venice, the celebraty caricatures (or big heads as they call them) in Portugal, the victorian masks in france, the king cake in france and New Orleans, the giant parades and skimpy glittery feathery costumes in the samba school parades in Brazil, and other things).<br>  <br>  The parties can last from 3 to 5 days but the actual mardi gras is only on the last tuesday of February.|`|IG8s8UnSaa	I went for the titties and beer.|`|f6vLKIFZaa	It isn't the Mardi Gra.

This is just my humble opinion, but, it has always amazed me all my life that people of all these different religions can make these elaborate claims about this is what you need to do to be saved. or, the rapture will definately take place. Jesus is the only way to heaven, etc. And it's fine to have your opinion and you should be able to speak about it, regardless if others agree with it or not. For me, the key is to just take it all in with a grain of salt and realize that people in general tend to get things wrong most of the time. That you can prove. Just learn a little about history, or even what's going on now in the present. To me, and again this is only my opinion, there is no hell, there will be no rapture or any violence such as that. I believe the ultimate creator, whoever that may be, is very peaceful and just looks at us every day and shakes his head at how stupid most of us are. But, to be frank, I don't know anything about the afterlife. Neither does anyone else.

It is most important that you wear what makes the day as special as possible for you. You have to weigh up weather other people's opinions might spoil the day if you think they disapprove. It was the custom (but not a requirement) of the church that brides only wore white if they were virgins as white represented 'purity'. There may be some who still hold to this tradition but most Christians would welcome you what ever you were wearing and say that it what you feel in your heart about getting married that is what really matters not how you look.

He took a look at Germany, and looked for the easiest routes for the allied army's to enter. It was in those areas that he placed his heavy weaponary and machine guns.

hmsCFQocaa	The lisping S is prevalent in southern Spain (Andalucia). In certain South American and Central American cultures, the lisp is also pronounced.<br>  <br>  Compare this in English to a southern drawl, or the Nordic extension of the letter O in Minnesota and the Dakotas, or the nasal Bostonian accent.|`|pnxzK1nhaa	One of the Kings that ruled Spain had a lisp and many people started imitating the way he spoke.Interesting huh.Read more on it on this link I found.The king was King Ferdinand. Ppl considered the lisp fashionable.|`|4r6d8Aieaa	A persistent urban legend claims that the prevalence of the sound /θ/ in Spanish can be traced back to a Spanish king who spoke with a lisp, and whose pronunciation spread by prestige borrowing to the rest of the population. This myth has been discredited by scholars for lack of evidence.[4] Lundeberg (1947) traces the origins of the legend back to a chronicle of López de Ayala stating that Pedro of Castile "lisped a little" ("ceceaba un poco"). The timeline is totally incorrect, however: Pedro reigned in the 14th century, but the sound /θ/ only began to develop in the 16th century . Moreover, it is clear that a true lisp would not give rise to the systematic distinction between /s/ and /θ/ that characterizes Standard Peninsular pronunciation.<br>  <br>  Nevertheless, for speakers of seseo varieties of Spanish, where /θ/ is absent, and for people who are more familiar with seseo pronunciation (e.g., learners of Spanish in North America), the use of /θ/ by Peninsular speakers is striking, and does indeed give an impression of "lispiness". The misnomer "Castilian lisp" is used occasionally to refer to this aspect of Peninsular pronunciation (in both distinción and ceceo varieties).|`|DC4Civrvaa	Good question!

9BeUbORtaa	Religious affiliation doesn't dictate one's political views, though obviously it influences them. There are Christians of all political stripes, all of whom no doubt justify their political views on religious grounds. <br>  <br>  Personally, I am socially liberal (by American standards), and I would describe myself as a Social Democrat (what Americans would probably call a 'Socialist'). Both of these things are influenced by my faith, I suppose, but especially the latter - I find it very hard to see how anyone could interpret the Gospel as good news for capitalists.|`|2f6d591b87634e2c1909160eb45e94a1aa	I'm a Anglo-Catholic (high church Episcopalian) and conservative, both fiscally and socially,  not because my religion prevents me from choosing particular political positions, but my rationality and education prevent me from taking particular political positions. My religion informs my decision, but it doesn't' dictate it. <br>  <br>  Example, I used to support the Death Penalty, but I changed my position, in part because of the Pope's opposition to the Death Penalty. One can be a good Catholic and support the Death Penalty, (Justice Antonin Scalia is a good example) but the Pope's opposition to the Death Penalty made me rethink my position, and after reading more about the issue, I decided I had been wrong. <br>  <br>  I oppose abortion because logically it makes no sense. You have hospitals where in one O.R. a doctor is taking heroic measures to save a 4 pound 6 oz premature baby, but in the O.R. next door a doctor is aborting a larger and healthier baby.  You can't LOGICALLY say one baby is human and the other isn't. You can't LOGICALLY say you are a human at 24 weeks but not at 12. When you start to say "Well this baby lives because it's mom values it, and this baby dies because mom doesn't value it" well then you are straight into Nazi ideology of killing off people who society doesn't value. That's pretty much where human civilization has normally been, what with "group X isn't human so it is OK to enslave them". The Evangelical movement of the 18th and 19th Century pulled us out of that mess...I don't think it is wise for us, as a society, to go back into it. The best way to define a human is "do you have human DNA" and go with that... a person's a person no matter who small.<br>  <br>  Bottom line, the data (historical and economic) doesn't lie. My politics and my theology  both line up because they are both based on rationality and the real world, not because I adopt a "trendy" or "cool" position and then have to torture my other beliefs into lining up with it.<br>  <br>  As for your other question, you can be quite leftist in your politics and still be a Christian. There used to be a very strong "Christian Left" movement in the U.S. and other nations. It was the Christian Left that was the main driver behind the Civil Rights Movement. (Martin Luther King was a REVERAND, remember?). You might want to Google "Catholic Worker Movement".<br>  <br>  The Christian Left has pretty much died, and as a Conservative I think that is a VERY bad thing for our nation. (Yes I said it was a BAD thing.)  The Christian Left was a vital and important part of our political spectrum, rasing important human rights issues and in an important way. (I know that Conservatives can be wrong... heck I voted for Bush and that wasn't as smart a move as I thought it was, was it?). <br>  <br>  The Christian Left died moslty because of Roe v. Wade, though the "No Prayer in School" and "Separation of Church and State" hurt it too. Finally  Gay Rights drove the final nails in the coffin. The American Left (as well as most of European Left) have adopted postions that are anti-thetical to Christianity.  One can't be a good Christian and a good Democrat anymore. They are logically contradictory.<br>  <br>  This is sad because it puts the Church on the side of the vested economic interests, and historically that is a bad place for it to be.|`|dFBccLExaa	Kemetic doesn't have any limitations for living- so long as you don't go killing or maiming people, or touching kids, you're fine.

a43gPKAtaa	While there are no set symbols for father and son in Irish (just as there really are none in English), you could either decoratively write the words<br>  Father - Athair<br>  Son - Mac<br>  with knotwork or the like.  <br>  Or you could do would be two lines (or even one long line if you want them connected) of ogham script which is a traditional script of the Gaelic languages.  Ogham is the font of Primitive Irish, but works well with modern Gaelic languages as well.<br>  ("Athir" is Father in Ogham, "Maqi" is "son of" in Ogham)<br>  Remember that ogham vowels can be represented as dots, which look quite striking.<br>  <br>  The main problem with a set 'symbol' is the prevalence of the magic number 3 in Celtic mythology which means most symbols are threefold (shamrock, triquetra, triskele, etc.) and lead to the quick switch to Christianity's 3fold God.  So any symbol will have 1 too many meanings for your purposes.

8xYHi4nraa	Alot of it is stereotyping. Media makes it seem that way incuding pornogoraphy which glorifies men and women of all ethnic groups intermixing sexually in order to fulfill some twisted fantasy based-again-on stereotypes.    Many ethnic groups are often forced to believe that they should first date in their own ethnic group for a number of reasons. The people grow to believe anything else is just not right or will result in something wrong. After their expectations are not met they first blame their race or ethnic group for not living up to those expected situations. So...they go outside their race and swear on their religion that the race/ethnic group (different from theirs) they chose is fulfilling all of their fantasies and desires and is thus...better...and the person they are with at that point is probably thinking the same thing about them...he or she is fulfilling my fantasy and expectations. When in all honesty it is often "for show."   -Look at me, I've got a x,y,z...-  *its really funny to see couples like that. Because they often stare at people in their own ethnic group to see if they are going to react. Its best to ignore them    If you are sick of Y/A! then you might try yahoo groups for specific issues that concern you.

I have to say that is a load of crap.  Black women are independent  and won't let anyone take advantage of them which makes many black men upset because they cannot get over on them.  When I did date white women yes they were pushovers, you show anger at them and they flip out and will bend to your every will. They don't challenge me intellecually, spiritually or any other way.  Black women are in general deeply spiritual and see God as a guiding force in their lives as do I. The white community as a whole really shies away from religion and spirituality as do many black men.  I love am deeply spiritual and look forward to going to church service and bible study w/ my fiance` every thurs. & sun.  I know not everyone in every race "always does" anything or is "definately like" anything. It is all the individual. But I was just speaking on my individual experiences.|`|b39KDuxraa	Honestly between me and you,  all that stuff is a bunch of bull.  Sounds like a bunch of stereotyping.  There is rarely one reason for anything if you think about it.  I have dated both white and asian and they is both the same.  Both are capable of the same type of love and generally most women are passive especially if you are good in the sack and they do not want you to go elsewhere.  My best friend married a Filopino girl and if you asked him why,  he would probably just say she is more attentive to his needs,  but really it is because there is a time and place for everything and tey just get along.

Then I thought, wait, my marriage probably isnt valid and I may not have any rights to my partner or anything, hell maybe I might get fired or denied employment, housing or anything else....man, that sounds like fun. I cant decide which is more of a compliment: when people tell you that your relationship isnt natural or that you are in the same boat as people who do incest, bestiality or pedophilia...omg, I just cant choose for the life of me. I just beam with joy when someone tells me as well that Im just sick, depraved or maybe I just havent "found the right person of the opposite sex." Yeah, maybe that is it...I mean, hey if you fail in hetero relationships, it only makes sense that you "turn" to the other side, right? Oh yeah! B/c both are the same apparently...But the best part I thought was....hey...that self destruction, self hatred and desperation and loneliness is far more appealing than anything else, so I just couldnt resist and I jumped on the wagon...oh yeah......|`|Ev6ruMeNaa	Im gay and I was "born that way." Im not sure if it is genetics or if Im gay and feminine because I didn't have a good father figure in my life and I went to daycare with allot of girls and looked up to my mom allot. I picked up feminine mannerisms at a very young age (3 or 4). Whether I was born that way or not I know I didn't choose it. It was just natural. I like to be out and open about it because I don't want my life to be a big lie. I rather people not like me for what I am than like me for who Im not. I didn't choose to be called ***** and queer everyday. Why would I choose to be gay and then tell people that Im gay when I know I will just be made fun of. That wouldn't make any sense right. Im just naturally sexually attracted to guys.|`|NwXnzARwaa	Being gay is not a choice. <br>  <br>  Discover Magazine has shown that "Two of the most convincing studies have proved conclusively that sexual orientation in men has a genetic cause."<br>  <br>  New Scientist has shown that "geneticists may have explained how genes apparently linked to male homosexuality survive" and "Mothers' genetic skew linked to gay sons."<br>  <br>  LiveScience has shown that "The arrangement of a mother's genes could affect the sexual orientation of her son, according to a new study."<br>  <br>  Scientific American has shown that "Having Older Brothers Increases a Man's Odds of Being Gay."<br>  <br>  WebMD has shown that magnetic resonance imaging studies reveal key differences in the brains of gay and straight men and women that could add to the understanding of the biology of homosexuality.|`|PWzJEIqPaa	why wouldn't you let you children date gay people?

Ao52XHjCaa	I am going to agree with the posters who indicate that you need to be more direct with her when you question her. I'm not in favor of these schemes that allow her to be raped or abused again to obtain evidence so that it will be easier to convict him. You are not an amateur private eye on a stake out but a very concerned friend. You are trying to get her out of a dangerous situation that you think that she is in as soon as you possibly can.<br>  <br>  I am going to sound like a broken record here, but you need to tell someone else what you think is going on. People on the ground where you live are a lot more effective in dealing with abuse than we can ever be here. If you can not tell one of your parents, tell someone at school. You take a teacher aside privately if you have to and say "I have something to tell you, I think my friend is being abused and I don't know what to do." It's hard to do, but you should not be trying to investigate this on your own.|`|nb8KtYfgaa	you need some cia equipment. set up hidden cameras around her house or hide out in the addict. or be frank with her and ask her what it is she cant take and that no matter what you will be there for her to help her get through this. then let the authoritys know what it is if in deed they need to take part in it otherwise dont waist their time or yours.|`|8PA58u3kaa	I'll tell you what I tell a lot of people that know they need to confront someone they care about on something but dont know how to do it, show here this post. When she reads it the truth will come out and I think the sincerity reflected here will convince her that you are on her side and that she can trust you to help.|`|IJMyRWp4aa	personally i'd kill the guy myself but what you should do is sneak around a little bit and try to get evidence that the dad is hurting her then take that evidence to the cops|`|12w7YjRTaa	Call the police. I'm sorry but you have to protect your girl friend. If you don't call the police right away then you don't care about her at all.|`|AA11349925	You should call child services, if he isn't doing anything wrong he will have nothing to hide and nothing to worry about. They will investigate and help your girlfriend.|`|AA12006309	Sadly there's really nothing you can do until she opens up to you or someone else she trusts.  The first step in her getting help for herself is  admitting there's something going on.  Good luck.|`|Ev6ruMeNaa	The best things to do is:<br>  If she is a minor report it to your school counsler the counsler will not tell anyone that it was you that told her you will remain annonomous it is against the law for her to say who told her. You could also report annonomously to CPS. The phone number to the child protective survices in your state should be in the phone book under government listings.<br>  <br>  If she is not a minor you can report annonomously to the police also you can do that if she is a minor to. Even if you arent 100% sure you need to do somthing. What if this exelates to murder! If somthing is going on then somthing can be done about it, but if there isnt atleast you reported it to be investigated.|`|WW1xWP8gaa	tell her that you would like to know whats wrong so u can try to help because u cant stand to see her that way and if that doesn't work i would slap her dad or talk to him|`|Hi9i2orDaa	just sit down with her and say you have to tell whats going cause i am really worried|`|Z1go9fvRaa	Try asking some of her close friends if they know anything about it, or you can talk to her favorite teacher or a pastor or something like that. Try asking her neighbors if they've ever heard yelling or something like that coming from her house. Whether or not what you suspect is true, it's obvious from your post that something is going on and something has to be done before things get out of hand. For a while, she may resent or even hate you for interfering (it's a girl thing; trust me, I know from experience) but it's the right thing to do.|`|cZeAG3sLaa	Ok, first thing- If she agrees and if that happens again she should not clean up or take a shower, she should go to you and you should take her to the hospital and say explain that she might have been raped, they will do a rape kit test and call the police, the test will serve as evidence and may help the police get a warrant for her father's dna and if this proves that he has been hurting her, he will be arrested.<br>  <br>  If she does not want to go to the hospital, call child services, anyone can do that and they will go and investigate, so if there's nothing wrong the father will have nothing to hide but if they suspect even the slightest thing is wrong they will remove her from his care.<br>  <br>  So please inform child services or report your suspicions to the police, even if they are just suspicions they should be checked out and if he did nothing wrong then he will have nothing to hide. Besides you can always make an annonimous report.<br>  <br>  Also you better act as fast as possible.|`|i3TiYBUqaa	simple.............give your friend an altermatum. Tell her you are going to the cops if she doesn't tell you the truth. That way, she will tell you the truth either way. .................You win either way because she will open up to you and tell you the truth. If the answer is yes, good, go to the cops, if the answer is no and you feel like your'e getting a straight answer then you finally can be at ease. But trust me, once you present the fact that you are going to the cops, she will fold, I am sure!, Best of luck to you in that situation|`|ppQbFWbWaa	You could call the police, or let her die.  Take your pick.|`|Cu0zrPWDaa	Sounds like me and my gf, she wasn't sexually abused but verbally. I begged and begged her to tell me why she despised her dad and one day she told me. We were at the beach on the jetti, she busted into tears...one of the first times I've ever seen her cry|`|uGIIR9Beaa	Get her to give a confession to the police. You will need evidence of such. Do not act on your own and do not just call the police by yourself. The risk is that if you do that, they may not have enough evidence to lock him up and she would just be hurt again when her father is angry over that.<br>  <br>  The police can handle household abuse but she will have to confess to that.|`|6PhSENcXaa	This may sound gross but do not wash up at all and go to the hospital and tell them that you think you were raped.  They will take a rape kit from you and also call the cops.  Tell the truth 110%..............don't cover up for this jerk.|`|DWeGV8Akaa	probably not rape just abuse which is bad enuf as it is <br>  <br>  that means youve gotta help her - with her consent of course|`|vg3ih0foaa	First of all, you should find out what's going on. Let her know that you won't tell the police or anybody, even though it's still a good option, and ask her what's going on at her house. Why does she have bruises, is everything okay at home? How is her relationship with her father nowadays? If you get anything out of her then depending on how old you two are, maybe she could move in with you until she can support herself. If that's not an option, then maybe you could spend more time at her place so her dad can't get at her. Try and locate some resource help programs in your area for professional advice on this situation. There's not much else you can do if she won't let you know whats going on but let her know you're her rock, and you're there for her. That she can trust you. But in any way, if you feel her life is being threatened, you have to call the police or someone you trust to handle the situation. Loving her means you also have to protect her when she can't protect herself, so if it gets out of control, let someone professional know.

In Tamil grammar, personification is called 'aahu peyar'.<br>  Now the tranlation:<br>  "Oh, thou who art my life, don't leave me<br>  don't cast away my life<br>  sans you there is no world (left out for me)<br>  The inherent interpolations of 'my' in the second line and the bracketed portion in the third line are to be inferred from the context of romanticism of the song.

Your use of punctuation is atrocious and apparently random, you have added spaces where they don't belong, and you have spelled your own high school name two different ways.      I suggest that you ask someone in the English Department to have a look at this before it goes out.

Call back again and see if they ask those same questions. That's really weird.|`|gspTDufpaa	Yes|`|mnEkv7xdaa	Sounds like she wasn't very professional - and she should have been clear about the location you were calling to at the beginning of the conversation. A potential patient shouldn't be expected to know that he/she is calling another city when the address says clearly where it's located. What a waste of time.|`|AA10600608	I don't think that was very nice of the receptionist, but maybe (possibly) that was some sort of policy that doctor's office had.
9c8zvpHoaa	The second, undeniably, because Dana is my favorite character and we really got to see her storylines branch out. Also, because Dana is my favorite character, I routinely deny the existence of the third season and pretend instead that for seasons 4-6 Dana has been on an extended international tennis tour and hasn't been back to WeHo because she's been doing so well. Self-delusion is a wonderful thing.
b1PvVoB0aa	They didn't do it for atheism, but they used atheism as an excuse for their actions. Atheism served as a foundation for their belief that killing millions of people is okay. Once you have abandonned the concept of sin, there is no telling what you are capable of.|`|UITfm0fjaa	Well, of course they didn't do it because they were thinking, "I love atheism!" They did it because they felt no moral responsibility to a higher power. THEY were the highest power in the universe, so they could do whatever they wanted. You take moral responsibility out of the equation, and you can start to justify a lot.|`|bn8X2YdRaa	well and crime is greed. You want something when you commit a crime. any kind of crime. Rape (you want sexual attention) Murder(revenge or someone got in your way of committing a crime) Stealing (pretty obvious) and so on    (only exception is like a seriously ill person killing someone)    But there is no belief in atheism right so how could someone kill someone in the name of nothing. Atheism is without belief so its impossible to kill someone with a belief of that sort|`|t88527U1aa	People are a end result of what they believe. Are you saying Atheism did not impact their decisions?  Foolish argument!|`|mFy3M8mVaa	You people seriously need to stop this jackassery.  Horrible crimes are committed by people of *all* groups. It's that simple. If there are no famous atheists that have ever carried out evil acts purely in the name of atheism, that does not mean that atheism is superior.  The crusades were carried out as the result of a hunger for power, too.  People will use anything to justify their actions: patriotism, race, sex, politics, etc.|`|zQyslfHKaa	I looked at a boobie on the internet because Atheism convinced me it was OK|`|759ae5ae6e1570ab62326b25526ef339aa	Don't remember his name, but the atheist on R&S last year that said he was going to go into a church and start shooting people. And he did.  In many communist countries, solders have killed people because they were Christians.|`|279ac5587c0a982b23b03bde3f0bbf91aa	Ok Ok it was me that tore that tag off that pillow in the store.  I did it in the name of atheism because it represented ultimate authority and I have a problem with that.|`|399b8d4579ac145bf601ea2ecd4bf934aa	ah yes, you have to watch out for those onion rings      godless heathens|`|lSV8D9Rfaa	Your question makes me smile truly, I cannot think of one. I would say this is because atheists, typically, are not trying to push their views on others. We do not feel that turning people atheist is our mission in life. Furthermore, atheism is not a faith; it is a lack of faith, which means we dont really feel the strong push based on some type of cultural education.|`|BFbjAOEHaa	You're retarded. What did Hitler do? He killed the Jews. Why? Because he was one fucked up christian. He believed that Jews should die because they killed Jesus. And don't you dare think anything you see on this is an example of atheism. I can name over 50 people that have commited some horrible crime in the name of christianity. Plus another thing retard, the witch trials were crazy jesus freaks that put to much thought into religion and therefor went around killing people because witchcraft was the "work of the devil". Read a ******* book.|`|ObLMLZ74aa	Me.  Having a 'stache this good should be a crime.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	But you miss your own point : They can only do it for  political or personal gain, selfish greed... a hunger for power -- Because they don't reckon with God and eternal damnation -- which damnation you will probably protest in your next post !!!!   :)     But there you have it, ideas have consequences. You missed that totally but you should read Doestoevsky's Possessed (also called "Demons" about atheists) or the chronicles of Robert Conquest and Solzhenitsyn.     S. makes an interesting point :  "Later in his life Solzhenitsyn asked what went wrong. How could a country with such a magnificent cultural heritage fall into such wide-scale barbarity? To find the answer Solzhenitsyn recalled the days when he was a youth. Everything seems so hopeful after the great Revolution. But some of the older people saw that things were not right. "A great disaster," they said, "had befallen Russia: Men have forgotten God; that's why all this has happened."    Fifty years later Solzhenitsyn reflected on the bitter fruits of that disaster. "If I were called upon to identify briefly the principal trait of the entire twentieth century," he said, "I would be unable to find anything more precise and pithy than to repeat once again: 'Men have forgotten God.'"     Meaning : Atheism has such bitter evil fruit that even in people who aren't the demons that HItler and gang were, it destroys society. That's why Plato says, Give them a chance or two to recant and then put them to death, for the good of society.     PS If you are going to divide the world by using a belief and its opposite, namely Theism and A-Theism you can't start dreaming up all these excuses you are trying unsuccessfully to do. Take greed, which you instanced, what does the Lord say of that person :    The man who had a great harvest  so many  things that he didnt have room for them all  so he built himself a big barn to put all his possessions in. But that very night, God said, You fool, [tonight] your life will be demanded of you; and the things you have prepared, to whom will they belong? Thus will it be for all who store up treasure for themselves [in this world] but are not rich in what matters to God.     Another reason to love Jesus, He is a straight talker.|`|3959c9601f288bcc65fe36767a2df0c0aa	Nope, but many associate a persons atheism with these acts: they are immoral because they are atheists. Some people cannot put 2 and 2 together in that morality is not a religious authority.|`|mSFjbetxaa	No.    Only the ignorant fundies claim that atheists have killed more than Christians.  That is one of the many reason why we know they are ignorant.|`|1TYZDRUqaa	Yeah, David Waters murdered Madalyn Murray O'Hair, and stole money from the AMERICAN ATHEIST organization she founded.|`|T5ztIAZbaa	No one ever says "I'll kill you because I'm an atheist!"    What happens is, atheists will hate christians enough to kill them for their faith.    In other words they will kill because we are Christian, but no technically because they are atheists|`|9mLjDa5kaa	What difference does it make?     A person either believes in Jesus alone for salvation, or they're going to hell.|`|0YL8qVMsaa	Stalin,Pol Pot,Mao all killed in the name of Communism.

George Carlin would enjoy your question.|`|3oNcHdgCaa	Hitler was a Roman Catholic, and it's worth noting that even Stalin had a religious upbringing and at an early point in his life wanted to study to become a priest.  Both religious and non-religious rulers killed and tortured throughout history simply because of a lack of respect for human rights and lack of understanding of the proper role of government (i.e. that the power of a government comes from the consent of the governed. Abuse or neglect the governed, and society will fall into chaos and that government will inevitably fail), not because of a lack of belief in a god. Those are rational concepts born out of the Enlightenment based on a critical analysis of how societies work, not religious dogma. Nowhere in the Bible or any other religious text will you find any teachings about limited government or human rights. In fact, it openly condones absolute monarchies, dictatorships, wars of aggression, genocide, rape, sexism, and torturing of prisoners. Believing in a god doesn't make one moral, nor does lack of such belief make one a raging savage. Even many animals peacefully get along with each other (think of the bonobo apes), and they don't believe that some big angry invisible man in the sky is watching their every move.|`|c7db39975c64a358eab6a0044a8a7223aa	There a lot of atheists who end up bitter at the world and end up shooting up a school or whatever. They get sick of people making fun of them and they seek revenge on what thet feel an unjust world. I think most people who use religion as a motive for crime have some underlying thrist for greed or power as well. They are not true spiritual people. I do not blame religion itself, because someone like Gandhi would never do something like that. I look at it on a case to case basis|`|ow2gVYeqaa	With maybe the exception of Maddam O Hare, no one gonna claim atheism doing something in the name of Atheism cuase theirs no prestigious or to be proud of about atheism.Saying you believe in God is respectful; but as most anyone on here knows believing and being Christian are two different things.|`|AA10876206	Um...

nJatWOhsaa	My ex-wife and I married when we were both Christians. She doesn't really know anything about Christianity (or care to know)... but I did. I had already learned a lot from my Christian schooling, and never stopped learning about all things religious... I cared very much about God's plan for me and what I could do for God, but at the same time the "intellectual" side (ie apologetics) was very intriguing to me.    Eventually I left Christianity and I think she couldnt handle that I was going to be an outcast (we live in TX)... so she left me, practically in a heartbeat.    That's love!|`|Wr09qsYMaa	My ex bought me a cross necklace and wanted me to accept Jesus Christ as my saviour, and wanted me to go get the chain blessed blah blah blah.

Now I've been married for 10 years (tomorrow) and when we started our family he mentioned something about going to church & getting our girls involved in it too.  His family is goes to church EVER Sunday.  When he said that I flipped out.  I told him there was no way in hell that I was going or even letting my girls go.  We never talked about it after that.  He knows how I feel.  His mom & sister-in-law are always sending me religious e-mails & text messages.  They don't do it to much anymore because I started sending them articles on Atheist.  One especially about how there are more religious people in the prison population than there are Atheist.  On my myspace page I had that i'm an Atheist. We had our friends over for dinner, and the guy said hey, I know you guys are Atheist.  My husband says "She is" I'm not.  That's her, she's the Heathen.  Our friends are Christians.  I thought that was funny!  My husband also knows I come on YA & reads my answers & questions, he's my fan!!!  Right now he's in Afghanistan, so he likes to read my answers to see if he can guess how i would answer them, and he gets them all right too.  He's my   1 fan!  He respects what I think and has never tried to change how I feel.  Although I really don't think he's that much of a believer, maybe he's more Agnostic.  Or just confused.    I would like to teach my girls about all the Religions, especially Christianity.  I don't want them to be in the dark about things or about the Bible stories like I was as a child.

It generally consists of a small ring of onion dipped in batter or bread crumbs and then deep fried. The result varies from restaurant to restaurant. The ring-like structure of an onion lends itself well to this mode of preparation.    The exact origin of the onion ring is unknown, but in 1933 a recipe for deep-fried onion rings that are dipped in milk then dredged in flour appeared in a Crisco advertisement in The New York Times Magazine.[1]    [edit] Variants        * Tobacco ring - very thin, crisp onion rings named for their color      * Blooming onion - a whole onion that is cut into a flower shape that fans out      * Onion loaf - a rectangular structure of onion rings fried together      * Texas Toothpicks - strips of onions and strips of jalape?os battered and fried. Served in a basket together with ranch dressing.    [edit] References       1. ^ "Crisco Advertisement", The New York Times Magazine: SM18, November 5, 1933, http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.h...  Cut large onions into slices about ? inch thick.

mTwn8p79aa	I had a friend who delivered pizza and he thought the bare minimum tip should be $3.00.    I was a waiter for years and I told him a $3.00 tip for driving $15.00 worth of pizza to my house sounds like a lot.  He called me cheap and said there were obviously a lot of people that agreed with me based on his tips.  He thinks most tips should be about $5 or more.    So, here's what I took from that.  Three dollars is more than enough.  You won't make them happy unless you tip 33%.  Who's doing that for someone that put less than 10 minutes into your order, including driving time for other deliveries?  No one.  If you are, you need to consider tipping your waiters around 50%, there job is 100 times more difficult than a delivery driver's.    Oh, and if there's a delivery fee, that does go right to the driver and should be considered part of the tip.  If there's a delivery fee I still tip a dollar but I'll say, "There you go, with the delivery fee that makes $3.50.  Thank you!"    I usually tip $2 for a small order or $3-$4 for a large order.  There is exactly 0% more work for a large order, as long as he can carry it in one trip.  What if he has to make two trips?  Well, how much extra do you tip the waiter for each refill you ask for?    Unless you live in a small town, don't worry about the next order.  Restaurant turnover is about 600%.  That means, on average, each driver will be replaced 6 times a year.|`|kTZevQNHaa	TIPS-to insure prompt service.  was the service prompt?  Was he a nice guy?  If yes to both, shoot the guy 3 bucks.

That sounds bad I know. But  they are getting  "in" on the tips of your delivery boy.  Someone needs to stop this crazy cycle. The delivery people need to form a union.Why does the "store" need a delivery fee ? To pay the wages of the kid ?   All stores have to pay wages. That's why we pay more for the food they make.  They do not pay for the kids gas,oil, tires or his insurance. They give them min wage or less. They NEED a living wage. Now they are stealing the 2.50 the kid would have gotten for himself. The delivery kids need to panic, then do something about it.  That's how unions were formed...and its what they are FOR !  PIZZA DELIVERY PEOPLE UNITE . Then I will gladly give the kids 3.00. |`|kQZHl51laa	Between 1 to 3 $ is good enough. Anything under 1 dollar is  being cheap.|`|lcKjQo2maa	considering the delivery person pays for his/her own gas, $1.00 should pay for gas for a delivery within a few miles from the start point.   |`|bOELcQrpaa	Whenever I order takeout, it is usually between $10-15.

If the service was good and want it to continue for future orders, $5. Drivers remember who the good tippers are and will ensure you get the best service they can give.    My usual tip is $3, but I've been known to bump it up to $5 if the driver bothers enough to make themselves presentable and if they make eye contact and smile.

CW5SQn8Laa	we just answered it.  Your intention is rewarded of course.  Everything from Allah SWT returns to Allah SWT so whatever you have today is from Allah SWT.    The intention is measured by Allah SWT and the Iman in your heart given to you also by Allah SWT.    The best thing you can do is learn arabic because that is the Quran.    The rest is translation and meaning and can have just as many errors as the bible and torah.    The Quran in any other language than what it came unto Muhammed SAW is not Al Quran Al Karim! Salam    edit: Notice how the Jinn come in without an Avatar? Interesting isn't it? Delete everyone that doesn't have an avatar and see what happens to your community you make in hub and spoke.  Give it a try and tell me I am wrong(not all Jinn are bad, don't forget that either).... Salam|`|ePT3hRO0aa	well.. i say learn how to read arabic .. you get more rewards of  reading in the actual language ... reading in english would be the translation if thats what u mean.. or if u mean just being english .. then i thin it would be fine...|`|VN30ib8eaa	Hey bro, what city are you from? let me know. We have many Bosnians in my city too.    OK, i believe, if you dont know Arabic at all, you will be rewarded even if you read the translation, Allah is the most merciful and He knows how hard you are trying to understand His message.    In a hadith, prophet Muhammad (sa) said, those who finds it difficult to recite Quran but still try to recite it will get double reward.    My advise is, try to learn Arabic, and in the mean time contunue reading the translation.    Heres a good link:    http://searchtruth.com    (make sure you read the translation of Mohsin Khan and Hilali, this is the best one)  |`|7nAE8bVIaa	I don't think Allah would send you I guess to the Muslim version of hell just because you don't know Arabic.  But it's great that you want to learn!!|`|00b644b30c5fa40d9099dfddcd2118c3aa	Reading in translation is not good enough.  You need to read it in the orginal language for it to give you any benefit from Allah.  You don't have to understand what you read, so as long as you can pronounce the words that is good enough.    This is because Mohammed wanted to give the incentive for people to learn to read, because he couldn't himself.|`|TnQTlYw1aa	well you know they say that most muslims dont like for the qu'ran to be translated. they say that the beauty and meaning of the words gets lost in translation. if i were you, id try to learn some arabic (rosetta stone or something) and then buy an arabic copy of the qu'ran (((;  happy musliming :D|`|atAZlwGdaa	The purpose of reading the Koran is to understand it.

Just joking dude, don`t take it personally :) What i believe is that, with translation, some of the text become slightly altered, as sometimes there`s no exact equivalent of the phrase/word. Arabic culture might also change the way the meaning of a word/phrase is perceived.

3448d1498622e1211c6d56e8145a47dbaa	Defining America as "the greatest country" would involve an individual's global perspective.   There are scores of people who would, while agree that America is indeed a "great" country, perhaps they would stop short of proclaiming it the greatest.      This is no anti-American rant; hear me out.    One could argue that Canada has every benefit of the United States plus national health care, less gun violence, higher test scores in several key subjects, a lower threat of international terrorism and apparently no less a personage than Santa Claus himself is a citizen of America's friendly neighbor to the north.    This is not to downplay the importance of the United States as a global leader, but a call to arms to better improve its occasional more illustrious distinctions.    As two great Americans, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, once put it: America F* Yeah!|`|RVkCFzrZaa	WHAT MAKES USA. THE GREATEST COUNTRY IS THAT, IT IS OUR COUNTRY.

77b2610047fd4e5f740d75e96c9a88a2aa	Like it's been said, it's just like work release.  It's off school property, is not related to school at all and kids are neither forced nor disallowed from taking it.    And it's only high school kids who take seminary.    When my kids are old enough, I will probably make them take it as a zero period (meaning before school) so that they can take all the extracurriculars they want to in high school.  I went to seminary before school at 6am because where I lived didn't have time release.      EDIT:  For those of you saying it violates separation of church and state what is your grounds for this?  How exactly does it violate separation of church and state?  BTW, the ACLU disagrees with you.  It does not find the LDS church to be in violation of separation of church and state.  http://www.acluutah.org/seminary.htm      You are welcome to defend your statements here: http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|TzY9vkinaa	They build it next to the school on the churches property. In school it is called "released time" lots of kids do release time to do homework or something like that, Mormons do it to learn about the gospel. They don't do this everywhere though, it's mainly in Utah.|`|xyIZv6iiaa	The LDS do have seminary buildings that are built near schools and yes students do attend - but relax!    NO tax dollars are spent to teach the LDS classes. It is ENTIRELY separate.   The LDS church pays the salary of the teachers.   The LDS church has paid to buy land for EVERYseminary building. You actually have to leave school grounds to go to seminary.    To take seminary classes, you have to sign up for Released Time, which means that the school system is releasing you for the length of the class. Its very much like if you had a job and took Work Release. You dont get any school credit for the time you go to seminary. It just shows up as a blank on your schedule AND report card.     |`|2ZO7vFC1aa	It's only a violation if TAX DOLLARS are used to pay for it.  No tax dollars are used.      The Mormon kids go to these classes during their study hall.  It's not part of the school curriculum.     There's no violation.|`|8jhACvtlaa	Phrog got it right.    Seminary is awesome.  I loved it.  It was a great way to feel the spirit everyday during school.|`|Kwfo0aRvaa	Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  |`|HqsiNMf2aa	The LDS (Mormon) church does tend to build chapels or dedicated seminary buildings close to High Schools to facilitate students attending seminary. Seminary is an optional supplemental religious education for high school aged children.    There are many places (like where I live in Las Vegas) that doesn't offer release time. We attended either before or after school.    There are also some places where the church has made an agreement with the school system to use certain classrooms before or after the normal school day when there is no outside facility in close proximity. This is no different than any other extra-curricular club. We had a bible study group at my high school as well. It is an open invitation to seminary, anyone can attend.    The teachers are not paid. It is an assignment by the local congregational leadership and is done voluntarily and without compensation.|`|QGLKOIlBaa	They're called seminary buildings. It doesn't defy separation of church and state because the buildings are on church property and the one is not forcing the other to do anything. They're both free to chose and free to be chosen.|`|8Ak1FehYaa	When in the mormon belt, and UT well they can do what they want to, but they cannot practise polygamy. I use to go to seminary (LDS religious class) during school hours, now that I am christian, I find out that if a christian wants a club, they must have school approval and it has to be before or after school hours. WOW!!! what a differance. I was spoiled when I was LDS.|`|PeeIS28Oaa	On several levels it would violate the separation of church and state. In Utah there is a seminary within very close walking distance of every middle and highschool. THey are off school property and the time is considered time release of the school. But the Seminary will report back to the school as if the students attended during their scheduled time and then at that point the school would follow up and discipline if I had an unexcused absence from seminary. Who's tax dollars are paying for that? And who is obligated to enforce a student must continue to go to Seminary class throughout their scheduled time. Violations happen but are overlooked. Don't bite any of the hands that feeds you.|`|xBcuGnHwaa	Umm religion in school...Yeah I live in the south where they pray at PTA meetings and children can go to bible study during homeroom. So don't make this a Mormon thing.|`|jdRKZe18aa	Where there are state & city colleges we have Institute of Religion buildings that college students attend religion courses for. High School students throughout the US attend early morning/or during school off period bible classes called "seminary" throughout the 4 years of their high school years.      This is no way is affiliated with public schools and is seldom if ever a building next to the public school unless a church building where these classes are usually held is somehow not accessible or workable with school schedules or within reach of the residents homes etc.....    How church & state fits into that scenario in anyones mind is really bizarre to me. But oh well....|`|WyICbuPqaa	It is true in large Mormon communities.  Where I grew up, they didn't have it.  I had to ride my bike for 2.5 miles to get to seminary, and another 2.5 miles to get to High School.  It started an hour and a half before my first H.S. class.  It was definitely worth it.    High Schools aren't prisons - as long as the students meet the federal guidelines for education, there is no reason that they cannot accomodate the needs of the community when it comes to scheduling.    Any church is welcome to start their own seminary classes.  Mormons do not have any special priviledge.|`|UNVJWxTmaa	It doesn't defy the first ammendment if the government (tax dollars) are not supporting it.  If the government said that mormon kids could not attend, then it would be a first ammendment violation.|`|OZ2Ass9iaa	I grew up in Northern Wyoming.  The LDS church had a "seminary" across the street from the H.S.  We had an open campus system (the school board was also all mormon) and so during their "study hall" the students would opt to take a religious class instead.    They also stayed open during lunch hour, so we "infidels" were invited in somewhere warm on those cold Wyoming winters!    Yes, it violates church n state very much.  In areas that are predominantly one religion, they get by with more :(

Adems le temen al nmero (666) cuando all hay SABIDURA (Apocalipsis 13: 18), pero ellos por no tener sabidura lo ven MAL. Ahora, si dejamos los rudimentos de la doctrina de Cristo entramos en perfeccin, sino quedamos en imperfeccin y en obras muertas. Son muertas porque al morir Cristo en la cruz quit el PECADO.     Esos rudimentos son: Echar fuera demonios, bautismos, sacramentos, lavados de pies, santa cena Ahora hay un camino NUEVO, y en ese camino hay una perfeccin (Hebreos 10: 20). En ese camino usted no tiene que hacer NADA porque es haciendo l en nosotros. La carga es ligera y fcil de llevar. No tiene que andar de rodillas ahora es con la mente. Es bien fcil. Si usted deja los RUDIMENTOS hay garanta que los ngeles le sirvan y tenga gozo y contentamiento.    Esos ngeles son enviados a FAVOR nuestro (Hebreos 1: 14). Esa ayuda angelical no llega si estamos en RUDIMENTOS.Hay que atender a esas cosas que hemos odo para que no deslicemos (Hebreos 2: 1, 3).    Nosotros podemos descuidar la salvacin (angelical, la diaria) eso significa que no reinamos sobre la situaciones diarias de la carne que se oponen (Glatas 5: 17). La carne fastidia. Para eso hay que educar su espritu con la gracia.     Hay que andar en el espritu sin satisfacer los deseos de la carne (Glatas 5: 16, 17). NO debemos andar conforme a LA CARNE, porque la carne ministra y tanto la carne y el espritu se oponen. Todos somos dbiles, pero en la debilidad se perfecciona el PODER de Dios (2a a los Corintios 12: 9).    Dios siempre usa un hombre y una cubierta, antes fue Moiss y el arca. Ahora es Jesucristo hombre y la cubierta angelical (Hebreos 1: 14). El mundo entero a?orar los beneficios de esa arca (servicio angelical). Segn Hebreos 3: 1- 5 hay un apstol y sumo sacerdote FIEL en la casa (iglesia) de Dios, que es Cristo (Jesucristo hombre), por eso no debemos negar este pacto.     Para eso hay que ser humilde reconociendo que la competencia proviene de Dios, que nos hizo ministros competentes (2a a los Corintios 3: 5, 6). No militamos en la carne ya que nuestras milicias son poderosas en Dios (2a a los Corintios 10: 3 al 5).|`|D8YPuH4caa	Lo dudo mucho...si bien es cierto los ngeles..son mensajeros...estos traen mensajes del cielo para nosotros....cuando tu oras...el Padre oye con sus propos odos.....es como si estuvieras utilizando un celular  ...llamando a tu familiar a otro pas.    por eso la oracin es..."Padre nuestro..."..nunca dices.."ngel ve y dile al Padre..."sin ofender"...aprovecho para decir..que Dios no utiliza a "santos" o "vrgenes"..para que le lleven mensajes nuestros.|`|BRvLQdlHaa	NO CREO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|Crzn9oLiaa	No, podria ser un insecto ;)   No hay murmullos por aqui.

6mZJSqBgaa	As a texan i vaguely recall learning about our anti butt sex law.  Even dildo's are illegal.  It's kind of like when you go to a head shop and want to buy a bong but you have to call it a "water pipe"    In sex shops if you want a dildo, you have to call it a "personal massager".  And of course strap ons are illegal too.  I think in addion to the sodomy laws, they just wanted to make any gay sex illegal.      I do find it disturbing that they still exist though.  But even though it's 2009, it's not all that surprising.  We did let the mormons take away rights from gay people- so why not have pointless laws that that criminalize acts of intimacy that are none of anyone's business.      So long as the religious right will prevail, i'll keep the blinds closed next time my boyfriend and i do anything kinky- like me getting on top!|`|PLtU5AuYaa	Well is there a cop in your bedroom/car/wherever 24/7? if not you can make butt and mouth love all you want.

DiIAaFgzaa	According to the Mormon religion, the only ones to go to hell are murderers, rapists, and such.    |`|jdRKZe18aa	I think you are full of bologna.....|`|YAiKlPkMaa	Quit messing with cults. Of course they are going to tell you they are right. You have a Bible, open it, read it, study it, get off the Mormon thing, forget it.  God gave us the Bible as a spiritual guide for life, don't deviate from it. Don't you hear the serpent hissing?|`|AA11282654	No, I have a newer newest new testament you must read. I have just finished transcribing the sacred leaves of lettuce sent from God.|`|7VJcd5YLaa	Hmmm, since you only wanted non-LDS folks to answer a previous question and have done a lot of these types of questions + you have a relatively new account = likely troll.    http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...    Missionaries are not perfect, so I can't say that they did or did not get into a bashing incident with you or not - but if you treated them as you are ranting on Y!A, don't know if I blame them if they did get frustrated with you.    P.S.  Adding all those exclamation points really doesn't help your point or show that you are level headed and open minded.|`|WyICbuPqaa	You shouldn't make up stories.  People might believe you.|`|TzY9vkinaa	I believed you up until the going to Hell part.|`|LhDde5iBaa	er? No. No one is perfect.     and easy on the exclamation marks if you will, please.|`|1e2aa41e34c037a92a687f6f7fcfcd71aa	Despite all the !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! in your question, I still doubt your sincerity somehow...|`|77b2610047fd4e5f740d75e96c9a88a2aa	I don't believe you.  Here's why:  We don't believe people of other religions go to hell.  I doubt they would have brought up baptisms for the dead  I doubt they would have yelled.  We believe we can become LIKE God, not actually God.    And most telling, LDS male missionaries would not have been allowed to talk to a woman alone.      I think you are a troll.    What kind of person has to lie to try to get a point across?|`|TEX1iYQgaa	Mormonism is 100% wrong.     Joseph Smith is a false prophet and The Book of Mormon is a complete work of fiction. It is historically false, and there isn't one shred of archaeological evidence that supports its claims. Even the Smithsonian Institute flatly denies The Book of Mormon's claims regarding ancient America.    I'm a little surprised by how the Mormon missionaries treated you though. Ordinarily they are very nice and respectful, in fact most Mormons are very nice people. It's really too bad that they're enslaved to a false religion...|`|Tcu0NWkUaa	Jennifer, Jennifer - what is happening to you?  You are getting more and more disillusioned each time you post another rant about the Book of Mormon or Mormons in general.    I don't know if you ever read the answers to your questions, but I seriously hope that you are reading the responses above.  I am obviously not alone in thinking that you need some type of professional counseling.  I believe that you once mentioned that you "used to be a Mormon."  You either need to accept the Church or leave it alone - one or the other.  Please!  Do yourself a favor.    Your anger is obviously having an adverse effect upon you.  Get some help with getting it under control.  And don't say that you are not angry, as it is so evident in the wording and all the exclamation points.    Yes, Joseph Smith is a prophet of God.  Yes, the Book of Mormon is true.  If there are any errors in either, they are the mistakes of men and not the mistakes of God.    |`|AA12365543	That dousnt sound like something a missionary would say. For one, Joseph Smith was only considered accurate when speaking of revelations because they are considered from God. Other than that he was a human like everyone else with weaknesses and flaws.  The book of Mormon on the first page even says the book has some mistakes. |`|AA10637643	IF the missionaries told you all those things, which I doubt, they are in error...    We are all encouraged to gain our own testimony of the gospel.  You included.  IF you want to know if the Book of Mormon is true, then read it and ask God.  He's the one who is 100% correct.    We believe the Book of Mormon is the most correct book, partly because it has only been translated once.  It was translated from the source.  The Bible has been translated many many times and we believe there are plain and precious parts of the Bible that have either been left out or not explained completely.    Doesn't mean the Bible is wrong - on the contrary, the Bible is a wonderful, and probably most important, book of scripture.  We study it at church and learn of the gospel through it.    |`|tV3qgBLcaa	no...    I think he saw a demon disguised as an angel..|`|RqC1s733aa	Mormon missionaries don't act like that.  Either you talked to an extremist (every religion has them), or you're full of crap.|`|YxjggsItaa	Mormons are a cult    "They told me not to believe "outsiders" because the Mormon religion they said, has the "truth" and is more accurate than the Biblem and they said if I go to a church other then the Mormon religion one, I could go to hell, because I don't have the truth."    All reglions think they are right.        Anyway who is this Joseph smith anyway,  maybe do some reaseaerch on him.    OK according to wiki    "In 1827, Smith began to gather a religious following after announcing that an angel had shown him a set of golden plates describing a visit of Jesus to the indigenous peoples of the Americas"    That sound like a really credible story dosent it|`|bDuImMKoaa	Nope he was a 100% wrong.|`|tC1hF1y5aa	You weren't talking to the Missionaries.  LDS missionaries would not answer any of your questions the way you claim they did.  The Book of Mormon is closer to "accuracy" in translation than any other book, including the Bible.  But, we still believe the Bible to be the word of God, so far as it IS translated correctly; we also believe the Book of Mormon to be the word of God, and another testament of Jesus Christ.  We haven't added to the scriptures, and I'm sure you will find that the quote in Revelations applies only to Revelations, and it was written before many other books in the Bible, anyway.  Baptisms for the dead are done by proxy, and are a biblical practice.  It does not "force" anybody into the church, but rather, gives them a choice in the hearafter.  The Priesthood authority we claim is directly from God, and was taken from the earth with the deaths of the original 12 Apostles (before they could ordain anybody else).  Archeological evidence does exist, nearly as much as exists for the Bible.    My question: now who were you talking to, exactly?|`|c8828614b563cd3de41253b6a9e40991aa	No he was not. He was 100% inaccurate.|`|8xJIPeHMaa	Run! So to speak.  Do not go any further.  |`|uGXjxnf5aa	Mormonism is a false religeon they made up their own bible.  Listen to what Jesus Christ said in his gospels, the bible not some other book.  Christ said that He is the way the truth and the life not Joseph Smith.  There are many false religeons and not all paths lead to God.  Christ said that in the last days there would be many false prophets.  Have a relationship with Jesus not the mormon church which will lead you into bondage and all kinds of legalism.|`|AA10063516	16  Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.    (Old Testament | Exodus 20:16)|`|C6lHPX25aa	Jennifer, if you will believe the Bible to be the Word of God --- and that it has ALL the truth necessary for mankind, then you will be on the right track....................Please don't get wrapped up in that 'cult', my friend................Jesus Christ IS the only way to heaven --- if you are interested in learning more about salvation, please feel free to email me and I will be more than happy to help you in any way that I possibly can..................    God Bless......................|`|09WVpZUGaa	You have some serious issues and should probably go see someone about that.  Seriously, what's your problem with Mormons?  I just looked at your profile, and you have quite a few negative questions about them.  I don't think you're sincere, and I find it disturbing that you would take so much time to bash this religion.  If you don't agree with it, move on. What good does it do you to talk about it?  Get over yourself.|`|0T3weRh5aa	Mormons don't believe in hell....false story you made    Rev 22:18-22 or something like that only is for the book of Revelations    Baptism for the dead 1 Cor 15:29  In the bible...ding ding ding    Looks like you read an anti mormon book or saw some anti mormon videos than ever seeing Mormon Missionaries.....            |`|5cLZlX30aa	Sounds like you had some scary missionaries.  You know, my mom went through SIX sets of missionaries before she converted to the church.      I've definitely had my doubts about my religion.  Now, I'm reading the Book of Mormon again so I can decide for myself if it's true or not.  I might be bad for doubting it in some people's eyes, but it's very necessary for me.  So far, it's the truest of any religion I have ever been taught, I've been to many churches, and this one is just real to me.  I guess you have to read it yourself if you really have questions.  Y! Answers is not the place to find answers, my friend.  You can go to the website www.lds.org and see answers to questions if you would like.  IT will explain some things.      Of course you will not go to hell if you are not a part of the Mormon religion.  We do not believe that, and I doubt it very highly that any missionary would tell you that.  It's simply not true.  You will not go to hell.  Everyone will get the opportunity to learn the truth, whether in heaven or on this earth.  That you can count on ;)    EDIT: I read some of the anti-mormon answers you received...I just wanted to tell you that these people are highly uneducated about the Mormon church.  It's not their fault that they believe nasty things they hear. But, I just wanted to let you know that.  As with everything, if you really want to know the answer to something, you have to find out the information by yourself.  Do your own research if you really want to learn.  Y! Answers is not the place for it.  IF you do believe in God, then you should start by praying to him about it.  You can always talk to him.  I think that's the best place to start.|`|QGLKOIlBaa	You know how I know you're lying about all of this? Because even Mormons don't claim that Joseph Smith was 100% accurate in everything he did, just like mainstream Christians believe that Moses wasn't 100% accurate in everything he did. At least they should. If they don't, then they've missed some parts in the Bible.|`|XSncvD4jaa	Well, I don't believe your story. Mormons don't tell people that they are going to hell. Obviously you have some comprehension issues or else you are faking to be dumb.   Give the names of the Elders and the mission they are serving in and I will personally see to it that they are corrected and reprimanded for raising their voices and making you cry and sternly telling you "listen to what we have to say".   I know that you won't do it because it's a lie. They simply do not behave in the way you have described and the verbiage is totally not Mormon.   Do you really think that the end justifies the means when you tell lies?  Jesus said that people would do all kinds of things like this thinking that they were doing God a favor. You can't lie and there be any good come of it...even if you think you are doing God a favor.  This post is 100% bull.  Please remember one thing Jesus said, "As ye have done it unto one of the least of these, my brethren, ye have done it unto me."  You see the Mormon missionaries as the "least" desirable humans and you have treated them as such here. You would have done the same to Jesus had you lived in his day.|`|xBcuGnHwaa	Why am I having such a hard time believing this.  Anyway let me just clarify here...  1. It also says do not add to this book in Deuteronomy.  2. Mormons do not believe you will go to hell for not believing.   3. Try reading 1 Cor  15: 29  4. Missionaries don't yell  5. There is only one God with a caps.    Oh and fyi for your additional details. There is archaeological evidence in support of the BOM. If you are truly interested I could help with that.

If they are focused on you, face you,sit with their arms uncrossed and many others they are interetsed. If they look away, fold their arms or interrupt alot then they are not into you. I know ut may take some time but reading books on effective communication and many law enforcement books will help. If they are looking down they may be worried or sad. The best thing to do is ask questions. People like talking about themselves so any questions you ask to have them open up to you will answer your questions.

523fe491291576865f3d5fd293ce800baa	merci de poser la question ;)    Dieu m'a remis sur le droit chemin alors que j'tais perdu.  Je ne croyais pas en Dieu avant, car la religion me dgoutait ou m'ennuyait.    Et puis peu  peu, je ne savais plus vers qui me tourner, car tout le monde t'abandonne quand rien ne va dans ta vie, et tu as honte d'tre ce que tu es.    alors je suis parti en voyage, et il m'a guid jusqu' lui. C'tait une sorte de parcours initiatique pour moi, je l'ai vcu comme ca.    Le premier jour, je vais visiter une Eglise, je m'assois, je me sens mal et bien  la fois, comme si ma vie en france me pesait, mais qd meme temps je m'en librais. Je me suis mis  pleurer sur mon banc, et une soeur est venu me voir; Je comprenais pas bien l'espagnol, mais elle m'a soutenu, soulag, et m'a donn une icone de St Critobal, protecteur des voyageurs, que j'ai gard tout le long du voyage.    J'ai vcu les 5 plus beaux mois de ma vie, j'ai rencontr des gens extraordinaires grace au hasard, ou plutot a la Providence divine. J'ai trouv un sens  ma vie grace a Dieu. aujourd'hui, je ne doute plus de son existence et de son soutien a mon gard. Il m'a donn LA femme de mes reves, ma fille est merveilleuse, belle et veille (a2 mois et demi), j'ai un projet de vie qui correspond parfaitement  mes souhaits que je vais concrtiser dans 9 mois, le temps de rcolter l'argent.    Dieu m'a donn les boulots dont j'avais besoin pour financer mon projet. et les gens ncessaires  sa ralisation.    Je n'ai plus peur de rien, meme pas de la mort.  Je sais qui je suis et ce que je veux, et je sais que Dieu est la pour m'aider a atteindre mes objectifs, car ils sont louables pour Dieu : construire un campus tudiant dans une rgion qui en a besoin : l'amazonie. Revenir  la nature, a la simplicit,  l'amiti et  l'amour pures et sincres.  Ma femme croit aussi en Dieu, et elle lui a donn ce qu'elle attendait elle aussi, avec pour elle ausis des dbuts difficiles et des lecons  tirer.    Dieu parle  tout le monde, mais qui veut bien l'couter ? Si tout se casse la gueule, c'est parce que nous sommes alls trop loin dans la folie. Pour moi, c'est le juste retour des choses. vivement que ca pete, qu'on revive normalement, tous ensemble, unis derriere notre bonheur collectif, comme cela existe encore au Prou, ou les gens s'entraident, ont la foi, respectent tout !    L'occident, c'est l'individualisme, c'est le Dieu Argent, c'est la nature que l'on dtruit, ce sont des hommes qui se prennent pour des Dieux en manipulant les masses et la nature, en se croyant suprieurs  tout ce qui existe, alors qu'ils se demandent pourquoi ils vivent. Il fallait bien que ca cesse non ? :)    Physiquement, je n'ai jamais de problemes, car qd j'en ai, je soigne mes maux seuls, avec la foi. Je peux expliquer la technique a qui veut bien m'crire ! ;)  J'ai rencontr un chaman en amazonie qui  m'a appris bcp de choses, et je connais un osthopathe chaman qui bosse en rgion parisienne, qui pourront vous expliquer tout ca mieux que moi...

We believe the family unit - again, a man and woman together - is essential in God's eternal plan for us.  In our belief, a man and woman can be "sealed" or "bound" together in marriage, for all eternity.  This requires certain covenants to be made with eachother and with God, sort of like a marriage triangle.  If that couple keeps their covenants, their marriage will be in full force in the next life, others will not.  There are so many blessings pertaining to the marriage covenant.  We believe that satan wants the family unit to fail.  He doesn't want the possibility for our marriages to last.  So, this whole world view of gay marraige - well, I believe that is really is "his" plan, not God's.    People who live that lifestyle are of course free to do so because we all have agency... but God is not bound to do anything for us when we don't do what he wants us to do.    *Rodney S - that's not why.  And there will NEVER be a same-sex marriage performed under the correct authority in the temple.  The temple is the Lord's house... and He aint supporting the gay marriage thing.|`|PZKmZ95Yaa	Gen. 1 & 2 - we see from the beginning that the complimentarity of the sexes reflects God's inner unity and His creative power and Fatherhood. God created man and woman to become one flesh which is consummated in the act of marital love.    Gen. 2:18  throughout the creation story, God says it is good seven times. But when God pointed out that man was alone, God says it is not good. God then created woman. Man and woman therefore belong together by Gods design, according to His natural and supernatural law.     Gen. 2:24  God created man and woman so that they could share communion. This communion is consummated in the marital act (which must be between a man and a woman). This communion is also a reflection of the eternal communion of the Blessed Trinity, who created man in His own image and likeness.     Gen. 19:24-28 - the Lord rained fire and brimstone on Sodom and Gomorrah as punishment for the sin of homosexuality. Homosexuality perverts Gods covenant with humanity.     Gen 13:13; 18:20: while homosexuals argue that the sin in Genesis 19 was the sin of inhospitality, these verses show that the Sodomites were evil and wicked people before the alleged sin of inhospitality. That is because the Sodomites were guilty of homosexuality, not inhospitality. In fact, 2 Pet 2:6:8 says that Lot witnessed their evil sexual practices day after day. The Sodomites sin was daily and pervasive.     Gen 19:5: this confirms that the Sodomites sin is homosexuality. Here, the Sodomites mistaken the two angels for men and, surrounding Lots house, ask to have sex with them. When the yell to Lot bring them out that we may know them, the Hebrew for to know (yadah) in Gen 19:5 means having sexual relations. See, for example, Gen 4:25 where yadah refers to sexual relations between Adam and Eve.     2 Pet 2:6-10: Peter also proves that the Sodomites were guilty of homosexuality. He says God condemned them for licentiousness and lust of defiling passion, which is where we get the title Sodomite for a homosexual. The Greek aselgeia anastrophes for lustful behavior is also found in Rom 13:13; Gal 5:19; Eph 4:19 and Jude 4.     Jude 7: Jude also confirms the Sodomites sin is homosexuality. Jude says they indulged in unnatural lust (Greek, ekporneusasai) and went after strange flesh (Greek, sarkos heteras) in reference to their homosexual sins.     2 Peter 2:4-6: Peter also reveals that the Sodomites are suffering in hell for their sins by comparing the Sodomites punishment to the eternal punishment of the evil angels. Just as God did not spare the angels when they sinned but cast them into hell, so He did the same with the Sodomites when He condemned them to extinction and made them an example to those who were to be ungodly.     Jude 5-7: Like Peter, Jude confirms that the Sodomites are in hell by saying that they had the same fate as the evil angels. Jude says just as the evil angels were condemned to hell, the Sodomites likewise (Greek, hos) acted immorally and are undergoing a punishment of eternal fire. Undergoing (Greek, upechousai) is a present participle which means their suffering is ongoing. See also the clear polarity between those who are saved (v.5) and those who are condemned (vv. 6-7,11,13).     Lev. 18:22, 29 - God commands a man never to lie with a male as with a female, or he will be cut off. This refers to supernatural death which is eternal separation from God. While the Old Covenant laws have been abrogated by the New Covenant, the Church has adopted their moral principles. Thus, the moral prohibitions on homosexuality still apply in the New Covenant, as Peter, Paul and Jude demonstrate.     Lev. 20:13 - God says that if a man lies with another man, he shall be put to death. From the very beginning, God has revealed that homosexual acts are intrinsically disordered, unhealthy, and mortally sinful.     Deut. 22:5 - cross-dressing is also considered an abomination before God.     Matt. 19:6 - after referring to God's divine plan for man and woman, Jesus says a husband and wife become one flesh, which ultimately reflects God's union with humanity through the Church. Homosexual unions pervert this divine truth of Gods love for and union with the human race.     Rom. 1:26 - also, when a woman lies with another women (lesbianism), this is unnatural and a perversion. God wants His children to be pure and holy as He is holy. Paul condemns all homosexual acts, whether committed by men or women.     Rom. 1:27  Paul calls the practice of homosexuality shameless, unnatural and a perversity. It is contrary to the natural law, as it eviscerates the life-giving aspect of human sexuality and reduces it to a selfish, pleasure-seeking end.     1 Cor 6:9: Paul teaches that sodomites will not enter into the kingdom of God. The Greek word for sodomite (arsenokoites) literally means male copulation or male sexual relations. The Greek arsen means male and koites means coitus or |`|hvNqywbBaa	Yes on 8    I stand with the Mormons decision|`|2de0b79e82da7f529f88b7bd06230c4faa	- There must be a line in the sand of which, not to cross, this line is a standard for all people set forth by God.

On the other hand, the bill does have some serious legal flaws in it: the courts have tried to overturn the voters in legislation against gay marriage. The bill would say that this is acceptable, when it simply isnt. Prop 8 also says that very young children, 1st grade age, would be taught about gay couples, which is neither necessary, or the schools job.    So on a bigoted basis, Prop 8 is good because it stops gay marriage.    On a government vs. its people stance, Prop 8 is good because it keeps the government from overturned voted on legislation.    On a humanitarian stance, its good because it allows people their basic rights.

It is intended to preserve traditional marriage. Gays are entitled to the same rights as married couples through domestic partnerships. They receive tax breaks, health benefits, etc, just like married couples.    Legalized gay marriage means pastors and clergy who refuse to marry same sex couples can and will be sued under the law. This has already occurred many times in Massachusetts and Connecticut where gay marriage is legal.     Also, schools and teachers will be forced to teach same sex marriage as moral and legal. This is occurring right now in Massachusetts where elementary school children are given books like King & King, a fairy tale about 2 princes falling in love and Whos in a Family, a book that shows same sex parents along with other types of families.    Just like our children should not be taught to accept Jesus in school, they should not be taught gay marriage as moral at school. These discussions should only happen within the home between parent and child, or between student and student, NOT teacher to student.    There you have it. NON-RELIGIOUS reasons to support prop 8!!!

This movie is going to make history.|`|wTk9lxqVaa	It may have hurt my marriage.  I hated the movie on so many levels I can't describe it.    I found Fireproof to be disturbing on so many levels, I lost sleep over it. My wife brought me, not telling me what sort of movie we're going to see. I assumed it was some sort of action movie about Firefighters. Obviously that wasn't what I got.    What remains a mystery to me is why, after the movie, people were clapping and hugging and cheering. The movie actually made me feel physically sick.    The acting was horrible, as was the entire plot, with the only good part being a scene when the hero saves a child from a burning house. I found the hero of the story pathetic and his wife detestable, his co-workers as sophomoric as the pathetic attempt at humor when his inner rage and sorrow is reduced to a silly running joke about his neighbor catching him kicking garbage cans.    The several morals of the story, I found detestable:    Moral  1. If you're not a Christian, you can't save your marriage. Buddhists, Jews, Agnostics and others, have no hope for saving their marriages, and can't benefit from any of this. And will probably spend eternity in hell.    (I'm a Christian, but I'm a liberal tolerant U.U. Christian who totally disagrees with that viewpoint.)    Moral  2. Romance can be one-sided, and you can fix all your problems by smothering your mentally abusive, cheating partner, with flowers and love and kindness and kissy-kisses, no matter how badly she continues to mistreat you.    Moral  3. Wife going out on dates and has a romance with a co-worker? Understandable. Husband looks at a few pictures on the internet? Contemptible.    Besides that, the marriage advice that was there was so obvious:  Things like, help out and do the dishes.  I mean, come on!    The wife, I found, so terrible a character that I found myself wishing she would get caught in a fire and a large part of the roof would fall on her head.  I absolutely hated her.  She even turned her back on her husband when he was injured in the hospital, his arm burned, his hand so swollen he barely was able to put his ring back on, covered with soot, and she didn't even care!    In a sub-plot, his childish co-workers conspire to trick one of them into drinking hot sauce. As a person with intestinal problems, I happen to know that this little gag, if repeated in real life, could put a real person into the hospital.    Oh, and the conclusion... she runs to get her ring and run back into his arms because she finds out... he spent money on her, buying her parents the medical equipment they needed. I guess if he was poor, didn't have the money, the movie would have had a different ending, right?    I have to admit... this is the worst movie I ever saw. Ever.    And the movie may just hurt my marriage, because I was open and honest with my wife after the movie on how I felt about it. I told her the truth. Horrible, horrible movie.    I know my wife had the best intentions when she brought me to see it. I love her. I hate the movie. I hope the movie doesn't put a wedge between us. We have our problems in our marriage. Everybody does. The movie has just become one more problem.|`|AA11931134	Never heard of it whats it about.
8ubAwaGCaa	Too little information has been presented for me to provide a meaningful response.  If you're in the mood for a SWAG, then read on.    First of all, I am in no way a psychologist.      I'm going to assume that you are from English-speaking North America, and further that in the dream you were in the car, perhaps the driver's seat.  all right?    The lion is not so fierce as they paint him, but yes, wolves do occasionally gobble people up no matter what people say (look up the Beast of Gevaudan).  Wolves have been demonized in Western fairy tales and even in Western religions, since the righteous are compared to sheep and wolves love to kill sheep.  Therefore, the wolf could be a manifestation of your deepest fears.  The bloody paws indicate that he has just killed, and he jumps on the hood of your car, showing that he is not in the least afraid of you.  Perhaps he is trying to kill you, too.    That's all I've got, and it could mean something like that unless you're just having fun at my expense.  No hard feelings if you are.    I notice that if I have analyzed the situation correctly, you have a little bit of protection -- the car (unless it's a convertible, in which case you're S.O.L.)  Further, is it just a coincidence that you are facing your fear, even if it is through a barrier or a glass?  Then perhaps you are in the middle of some kind of emotional struggle in your life.  You want protection and you want to come to terms with your fear.  You can't quite meet the wolf outside of the car, but you are still facing him.  This is far fetched, I know, but I like to exercise my imagination from time to time.    Seek all the support and encouragement you can, and face your demons with faith in God.  Good luck, and God bless you.  |`|1c898821ebce454e5d358837f41c158eaa	Nothing, apart from that you have wolves somewhere in your head|`|J4Wf5wo0aa	someone will die from car accident.|`|c9f625014526b2fcf9fa720e01fcd413aa	It probably means that you were sleeping.|`|4cfa2f8d5b2034431cf172500c7e4bf2aa	Did it frighten you?  It could be that something in your life is causing you anxiety.  Was the wolf trying to attack you, or was it injured?  Can you think of anything in your life related to cars, wolves, or blood?  That's probably a good start.    After my grandpa died of lung cancer (a very bloody way to die) I dreamed that a man pulled out one of his bloody organs and threw it at me.  In that case it was pretty obvious what my dream meant.  I also dreamed that the world was destroyed by a flood.  The water in that case symbolized death.|`|AA11811007	Wolf had a good lunch|`|8MZvgiyBaa	You should clean your car.|`|oDR80CiSaa	It means that this question is in the wrong section.|`|QL4qKyBtaa	You ate something spicy before bed.|`|I0Hjx0ahaa	To see a wolf in your dream, symbolizes beauty, solitude, mystery, self-confidence and pride. You are able to keep your composure in a variety of social situations and can blend in with any situation with ease and grace. You are a loner by choice.  Negatively, it represents hostility and aggression.  It may also reflect an uncontrollable force or situation in your life. In particular, if the wolf is white, then it signifies valor and victory. You have the ability to see the light even in your darkest hours.      To dream that you kill a wolf, indicates betrayal and secrets revealed.    To see blood in your dream, represents life, love, and passion as well as disappointments.    To see an animal paw in your dream, suggests that you need to trust your intuition and animal instincts. The dream may also be a pun on your "Pa" or father.    To dream that you are driving a car, denotes your ambition, your drive and your ability to navigate from one stage of your life to another. Consider how smooth or rough  the car ride is.  Whether you are driving the car or a passenger, is indicative of of your active role or passive role in your life.  If you are in the backseat of the car, then it indicates that you are putting yourself down and are allowing others to take over.  This may be a result of low self-esteem or low self-confidence.  Overall, this dream symbol is an indication of your dependence and degree of control you have on your life.     
JbjhzfnMaa	I wish I'd had all those languages to choose from! I only got to choose between French and Spanish, haha.     Anyway. I would suggest Latin if there's a possibility of a career in languages, or learning other languages in the future. Latin connects all the Romance languages, so studying Latin will help you out when learning other languages (like French or Italian).|`|CSzDV3gEaa	i think since you have general knowledge of spanish you should take spanish to master it. i am in spanish right now and i enjoy it. it is also somewhat similar to english and once you learn spanish it is also easier to learn italian and french because they all come from latin.|`|U7sBZKUuaa	If you are looking to get ahead in the business world, you might want to consider Japanese.

6SwaWSoyaa	I live in Indiana and most of us think the southern drawls are annoying. However, we do have our occasional wannabe redneck who will put on a fake drawl and then in that case, southern accents sound like opera compared to the fake ones. I think southern accents are ok, if they are nice and crisp and don't include a lot of double negatives and extreme grammar issues. Also I think the new england accents are interesting.

PeQ40WcWaa	I think that you are right to stick to your guns about not being ready for a child at the moment.    My ex got pregnant at 17 and while she loves her daughter to bits, it was such a struggle for her to have a child so young.    You need to talk to your girlfriend face to face. It sounds like she has got an idea into her head and is obviously getting carried away with it - she's focussing on how lovely it would be to raise a child together.    However, there's a high possibility that if you rushed into it, it would ruin everything both of you wanted in the first place.    You should really get through your A levels, Uni if you want to, and live together first before considering children.    Your girlfriend needs to be willing to understand your opinion and feelings.    Explain to her how you feel, and tell her that you value what the two of you have together so much that you don't want to rush it.     I'm 24, and trust me, even though it's only 6 years older than 18, you have so much you will learn about yourselves from now to your 20s. Hold off until you are completely enthusiastic and have thought it through.    xx Sparklepop|`|33b8882eea02cff57b6f2ace9959c946aa	. . . .. . . . . . . . . . . ,.-. . . . . . . . . .``~.,  . . . . . . . .. . . . . .,.-. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .-.,  . . . . .. . . . . . ..,/. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . :,  . . . . . . . .. .,?. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\,  . . . . . . . . . /. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,}  . . . . . . . . ./. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,:`^`.}  . . . . . . . ./. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,:. . . ./  . . . . . . .?. . . __. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . :`. . . ./  . . . . . . . /__.(. . .~-,_. . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,:`. . . .. ./  . . . . . . /(_. . ~,_. . . ..~,_. . . . . . . . . .,:`. . . . _/  . . . .. .{.._$;_. . .=,_. . . .-,_. . . ,.-~-,}, .~; /. .. .}  . . .. . .((. . .*~_. . . .=-._. . .;,,./`. . / . . . ./. .. ../  . . . .. . .\`~,. . ..~.,. . . . . . . . . ..`. . .}. . . . . . ../  . . . . . .(. ..`=-,,. . . .`. . . . . . . . . . . ..(. . . ;_,,-  . . . . . ../.`~,. . ..`-.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..\. . /\  . . . . . . \`~.*-,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..|,./.....\,__  ,,_. . . . . }.>-._\. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .|. . . . . . ..`=~-,  . .. `=~-,_\_. . . `\,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\  . . . . . . . . . .`=~-,,.\,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . `:,, . . . . . . . . . . . . . `\. . . . . . ..__  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .`=-,. . . . . . . . . .,%`>--==``  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . _\. . . . . ._,-%. . . ..`\.|`|7b1f8172d4a9ac10c23b5f3870728bb8aa	just explain all your worrys to her.    shell understand, and if for some reason she doesnt, then it wouldnt work out anyways.|`|uGIIR9Beaa	Forward a plan.

uPC7k3Ojaa	I'd say it depends. Most modern songs that are sung in Mandarin Chinese or Hausa don't use spoken tone to influence the melody, as the context in which the phrase or verse is sung would give the audience enough to subconsciously assign tones and subsequent meanings to the words.     If necessary, like in modern Cantonese, Thai or Vietnamese pop music, the tones may be "hinted" at, while still keeping the melody, to aid comprehension, especially with falling or dipping tones (you'd hear them as slight "dips" or "rises" within the song melody).    Traditional music has a completely different case among heavily tonal languages. Most traditional songs sung in tonal languages in Southeast/East Asia and West Africa use spoken tone to influence the melody. The emphasis on traditional songs is the import of the lyrics or chant, so besides hearing a sung melody, the spoken tones usually take precedence.     Traditional music of the Yoruba and Hausa people of Nigeria and West Africa (look up "Fuji music" or "Mamman Shata" on google or youtube to hear an example), as well as old and modern compositions in Chinese/Vietnamese Opera, and Classical Thai singing are highly typical of this type of strong spoken tone/sung melody link, and tend to sound a lot like a type of embellished "spoken verse" :) What's interesting is that people like the Yoruba or Igbo tend to fully utilize spoken tones in their modern songs, yet neighbouring peoples, like the Hausa or Ashanti, don't.. Its all to do with the attitude among native speakers towards melody and its relation to the spoken word.    If you wanted to sing 'Twinkle-Twinkle Little Star' in a tonal language, the best thing to do would be to see if there is a strong concept of a "spoken tone-song melody" link, or that of psychological detachment between sung melody and spoken word. In most cases probably "hinting" at the spoken tones whilst keeping the melody intact would suffice.|`|V5xHaIAcaa	I must congratulate your on an extraordinary intelligent question (at   least for Yahoo).    While I am a classically trained musician.  I have nothing but admiration and love  for Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, etc.    I have also traveled in VietNam, Cambodia, Thailand, etc.    Here are my two cents worth:  It is impossible to translate Bach, and one of his cantatas, for example into a tonal (polyglot) language.    If you find a different (and authentic or at least believe able) answer i would love to hear it - AND PLEASE POST IT|`|Rt0e1eEeaa	They sacrifice most of the tones of the language.    like if I say:    wo ai ni jin tien wo gei yi ge wan  (I love you. Today I'll give you a kiss)    As long as a few words have tones in the sentence. It should be easy to figure out what they're saying.
AA10940629	The management office has absolutely no right to tell you NOT to call the police.  Every city has noise ordinances...find out what time in your city the "nuisance law" goes into effect, and watch the clock.  The second its past that time call the police...and do so every night until the noisy people get the hint that you're serious.    Then find out who owns the apartment complex (corporate office) and call them directly to complain (1) about the neighbor, and (2) about the management staff who hasn't handled it properly.    If/When you call the corporate office, just remember to be as cordial as possible.  There's a really good chance that person you get on the phone will have absolutely not idea that there was a problem before you called.  Just be nice and you'll probably get some help.|`|REC4YgOuaa	Call the police and have them file a report. The management company has no right to tell you not to call the police.|`|69c729bbc40865df57b81abf4bbab3caaa	Personally, I think it's cruel to the kids, not to mention pretty thoughtless of someone with six children to set up residence in an apartment complex.  To be living over someone's head is even worse.  Have you talked to management about perhaps switching apartments?  With that many children, they really should be living on the ground floor.  It isn't practical or fair to the other residents.  True, noise should be expected in an apartment complex, but children make noise.  If management is being uncooperative, you have every right to contact the police for unreasonable noise levels.  Check your lease for a clause mentioning a right to reasonably peaceful living conditions, and if they complain to you about contacting the police, bring up the lease.  If they aren't willing to let you move to another apartment in the complex, perhaps they can install some kind of soundproofing.  You pay to live there, and it is well within your rights to expect reasonably comfortable living conditions.|`|WrUTuQdlaa	I'd call police and file report.|`|AA12187539	I generally agree with other peoples comments.  The only thing I would add is that you should work to have your neighbors permanently removed from the apartment complex.  They are your neighbors and would probably retaliate in some way if you just caused them problems by calling the police.  Seek legal counsel, get all the evidence prepared in advance, and sock it to them all at once so that they will be leaving soon.    I guess, in any argument with a neighbor, you risk retaliation.  But as it stands, you dont have much more to lose, right?

Ce n est d ailleurs pas la seule incoherence biblique. Il y en a encore beaucoup d autres.      La religion a commis tres tot l'erreur fatale de se mler des faits empiriques: la Bible nous a ainsi gratifis d'une longue liste d'affirmations prcises, officielles et indiscutables sur le cosmos et la biologie que nous savons aujourd hui tre completement erronees.     La science montre que certaines fables sur la formation des plantes sont inacceptables  et  nous savons maintenant que l homme est apparu en afrique de l est et non pas au proche orient comme l affime les redacteurs de la bible.     C'est  donc une erreur fondamentale que de prendre ces affirmations  au premier degre. Ce sont a mon avis des indices images pour nous guider vers la connaissance, mais ne saurait en aucun cas tenir lieu de savoir et de connaissance.    par ailleurs  la bible n affirme nul part etre la parole incontestable de Dieu, (il n y a que certains d entre nous qui l affirment) alors permettons lui (compte tenue de son age) de se tromper sur certaines choses et acceptons son message essentiel qui est un message d amour et de moral qui n a en fait rien a voir avec la religion.|`|LrVY76dcaa	en s'accouplant, d'abord, puis, Dieu dcide que tel ou tel couple ait tel enfant, gar?on ou fille, ou des jumeaux ou rien du tout....    c'est  la raison pour laquelle Dieu a permi aux hommes d'pouser plusieurs femmes...

T2JBX5Ataa	Haram in the name of islam is still Haram. I.e the Music.     Not to mention there is a debate about saying Ya Muhammad  It is to be stressed that when a Muslim prays he asks none but Allah and when he seeks help, he seeks the help of Allah alone. We pray to Allah, not to any creature, including the Prophets and Messengers of Allah. There is no authentic hadith which teaches that Muslims should pray with the words "Ya Muhammad" and none of the Prophet's Companions did so. So we should follow in their steps.     In his response to the question in point, Dr. Muzammil H. Siddiqi, former President of the Islamic Society of North America, states:     "The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) himself told us in a very authentic hadith that is reported by `Abdullah ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him), "When you ask something, you ask in the name of Allah and when you seek help, you seek help of Allah. Know that if the people were to gather together to benefit you with anything it would benefit you only with something that Allah had already prescribed for you and that if they gathered together to harm you with something, they would harm you only with something Allah had already prescribed for you." So the Sunnah is that we pray to Allah (Mighty and Exalted be He).     There is no authentic hadith which teaches that Muslims should pray with the words, "Ya Muhammad", and the Companions of the Prophet also did not do that and we should follow the way of our Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) and his Companions in our prayers. Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) was the last and the final Messenger of Allah. He is the beloved of Allah (Habibullah). We believe in him, honor him, respect him and love him, but we do not worship him or come to Allah through him."     Asking anyone but Allah(SWT) is Shirk.|`|AA12292803	muslims idolize a child molester ,christian idolize a dead man on a stick,both are against the law of g-d,the sooner you realize that the better and maybe there could be some peace on earth,|`|71afbaedac2a285cf2c6b5606a092e32aa	I usually listen to Native Deen and a few others.

Saying Muhammad excedes a man...that is not idolatry?  You must have a warped definition of idolatry ...If Muhammad is greater than men what is he?    If he is indeed a man...How is he better than a man?  In what way would you say even acording to the Qu'ran he was greater than Christ...Jesus was perfect according to the Qu'ran and Muhamamd was commanded to pray for forgiveness of his sin...So he who sins is greater than he who does not?    So Allah had Muhammad pray for forgiveness because Allah didn't know Muhammad had not sinned?

Those people are bigoted morons!!|`|fHpzK9hVaa	The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormonism) is a beautiful Christian religion. Because Mormons believe in the divinity of Jesus Christ and consider Him to be the way to salvation, they are clearly a Christian denomination. It is true that they are not an orthodox denomination (they are neither Protestant, Catholic, nor Eastern Orthodox), because they don't accept the post-New Testament creeds,  but their Christ-centered theology clearly qualifies them for the Christian label.    Most objective scholars agree that Mormons are Christian. Consider this quote from an academic book entitled Anthology of World Scriptures by Robert E. Van Voorst.    the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saintssee themselves as Christian, and most experts in comparative religions would view this labeling as basically correct. That theyaccept the Christian Bible as their first cannon is a good indicator of this. Moreover, outsiders to [Christianity], such as Buddhists, would almost certainly recognize them as belonging to the stream of Christian tradition.    Likewise, a recent poll showed that the majority of Americans believe that Mormons are Christians.    You should be extremely careful when trying to learn about Mormons from others. There are many who hate the Mormons and spread lies, distortions, and conspiracy theories about them. Others think they understand Mormon doctrine because of "what they've heard," but are actually misinformed.     Because Mormons are Christian, we believe in most of the things that Christians believe, including:    1) Christ is divine and salvation comes only through Him.  2) The Bible is the word of God.  3) Men ought to love one another.    Mormons are a unique branch of Christianity, however. We are neither Catholic nor Protestant, so naturally we have some different beliefs. Most of the differences are minor. One significant difference has to do with the authority to act in God's name. Mormons believe that soon after the death of Christ and His apostles, the early Christian Church was greatly influenced by Greek and Roman philosophies and political pressures. Despite the efforts of many good men and women, the true Church of Christ was eventually lost because of these outside pressures and internal, man-made changes. Mormons believe that God reestablished the original Church of Christ in 1820 through a man named Joseph Smith.        |`|2beAXP8aaa	Huh, what do you know, religious bigotry from other denominations!

Here is a suggestion why don't you talk to your mormon friends and ask them what they believe in.|`|9mLjDa5kaa	No.     Mormonism rejects the truth that Jesus is God Himself.  Therefore Mormonism has a different and fake "god" that cannot save anyone from hell.     In addition, Mormonism rejects faith alone in Jesus for salvation, and mormonism rejects that the Bible only is the Word of God (Mormonism adds the false "book of mormon")|`|IIhiSprlaa	no.  mormans are on a higher ladder in my opinion.|`|NCRfZRopaa	Yes.

To be a Christian you must believe that God raised Jesus from the dead and confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord.  So if a Mormon has done that then he/she is a Christian.    But somehwere in there must come an understanding that Jesus is God in man form.  That's a little harder for them to grasp.

"Nisaa'" is the (again irregular) plural form and means "women," "al-nisaa'" - pronounced as "an-nisaa'" meaning "the women."    Fairly sure that "Women" is an unlikely personal name. *However*, bear in mind that in Arabic vowel length makes a difference and there are two different "s" sounds, so it could be a name under a different spelling/pronunciation.
AA11755204	If you are in a church, it is the wrong church.  Gods don't exist.  You would be better off without such superstition in your life.

Matthew 15:9 shows this form of worship is useless.|`|gRbtRirVaa	Listen to your heart or ask God in prayer=)and by the way it is a good thing that you are going to church.|`|2ldwoFz3aa	The bible says that when you find the truth it will set you free.

There are many other religions like Judaism, Neo-Paganism, Hinduism.|`|5UB6zz10aa	If your schedule permits, go to both. It's the same god right?|`|NquBJdKEaa	sounds like the second church is the deal.  If you're growing faster spiritually then you need to stick with the church that is going to do that for you.  Honey, it is ALL about who feeds you the best.  One thing that I've noticed for myself in finding my church was how EVERY sunday that I went the preacher talked about something that I had been dealing with that last week before church.  He talked about THE VERY THING I had been asking myself.  This happened EVERY time I went to church and STILL happens to this day.  That is why I DO NOT leave that church.  I feel that that is a sign that I am getting fed there and it's the church for me.  So I guess you should stay with the church that touches on your personal problems that you're dealing with and fixes the issue for you. (or at least gives you what you need to know to fix them).  Good luck to you girl!

RkysBrVwaa	it's sad that people would single out one group of many for exercising their democratic right, just as much as the people who voted against it. people are upset because some people are acting as if the church somehow single handedly underminded the democratic process or something. also while your amount is off (it wasn't 25 million according to public records of the funding) what would it matter how much they donated anyway- the No on 8 campaign raised even more than the yes side. almost 3 million more to be exact- so it's not like it was an unfair fight or something...also might want to consider some of these facts...     -The actual church didn't donate any funds- they endorsed the prop and encouraged members to participate in any way they could- along with 233+ other churches    - The actual members of the church only account for less than 25% of the yes on 8 money donated to the prop (please refer to the LA Times link- you can track the money from that website)    - Over 5 million people voted for the prop. there are only 750,000 LDS members in california. If EVERY single person EVER baptized (because membership records is not based on activity) including children voted yes- that would make up for less than 15% of the votes that voted yes.    - The church had NO hand in any campaign tactics, ads etc. all of it was ran by the National Organization for Marriage which has absolutley NO affiliation with the church whatsoever.    - the No on 8 side actually ended up raising more money. With more donations from out of state than the yes side.    http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-mon...    - the polls show that 70% of african americans, and a little over 50% of latinos, regardless of party affiliation voted yes on the prop. Latino's make up for more than 40% of the states population. and african americans about 10%. (there were no statistics on caucasian or asian voters)    -- similar bans also passed in florida which has less than 1% mormons but the prop passed 62%.    -arkansas previously passed a ban on marriage and on civil unions at 70% and the mormon population there doesn't even make up a percentage of the population.    -Georgia, Kentucky, Michigan, Mississippi, Montana, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Ohio, Utah and Oregon all passed bans in 2004 with more than 70% votes. but with the exception of Utah all of those states have less than 5% mormons in their state.    - the prop had to pass through legislation before even being on the ballot. It's not like church had any hand in that...it's not like the prop was their idea. It actually was put on by the Knights of Columbus which is backed by the Catholic church.    - 160+ organizations endorsed the prop and 60+ public officials.    Now I recognize that the church members had a big influence with those that donated time and efforts. But can you honestly say it was all the mormons? Or even the LDS church at all? Could it be that people are just looking for someone to blame?|`|AA12152549	It's because the Mormons love us so much.  At least that's what I've heard.  I think, however, that their love for homosexuals is hollow since it comes with conditions.  "I love you, but ____" - that kind of love isn't the love Christians (Mormons call themselves Christians) are called to demonstrate to people because Jesus himself loved without conditions.|`|LJ6vHfgoaa	In 1862, the government told Mormons who they could and could not marry. The ban on polygamy has yet to be lifted. I've noticed that a lot of same-sex marriage supporters OPPOSE polygamy, yet they have the nerve to call others bigots? Disgusting.     If the government is going to involve itself in who can and cannot  legally marry, the Mormons have every right to participate in the decision-making process.     Solution? Get the government OUT of marriage altogether, as legal scholars suggest:    http://www.becketfund.org/files/33dc1.pd...  http://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/edi...  http://blogs.usatoday.com/oped/2008/08/g...  http://uchicagolaw.typepad.com/faculty/2...|`|xWi4ua0Iaa	I think the IRS and the state tax commission should investigate the California chapters of the Morman church, and if they find an overly political involvement in their actions, they should revoke their tax exempt status and make them declare revenue for the past year....what other political organization enjoys tax exempt status?  The $25 mill they contributed to the Prop 8 campaign will look like chicken feed when they'll need to cough up about $200 mill or be thrown in jail for tax fraud...|`|fc9205d542b3f8b1281ff1f85cc2e6f9aa	Yeah, I don't get it either. Not all of the Mormons voted for 8, but a good majority did. And they seemed to be pouring or at least suggesting to their flock to give money to the cause, which is how they raised that $25 Million.    There's a petition at the site below that's asking people to sign so that the Mormon church loses it's tax exempt status. I think that's fair. If they want to throw their hat into the political arena, they should pay taxes just like anyone else.     |`|ZT9vNoNqaa	You're right, and it wasn't just money. Mormons were the biggest supporters in terms of man hours, setting up phone banks, putting up signs, and going door-to-door. They read a letter over the pulpit to all Mormon congregations in California asking for support, and they requested donations from wealthy Mormons across the country. I can't do better than this response I saw today on a message board (edited for language):    "I ... hate the church's press release saying that they're disturbed that they are being singled out for exercising their rights.    [Idiots], you aren't being singled out for exercising your rights; you're being singled out because you're wrong. Free speech doesn't mean people don't get to speak back to you, or that your ideas get a free pass from criticism. Free speech means that you get to say your piece, and then everyone else gets to respond.    We're responding. Do you hear us at your gate?    7th grade civics, people."|`|OyBuEpOTaa	It's not a persecution complex at all. The Mormons want the law because of their past problems with polygamy (men taking more than ONE wife) The law reads that marriage is a union between ONE man and ONE woman. That is what they need to stop polygamy from being practiced again. Polygamy was a total disaster and the lives of many women and children were destroyed since the inception of it.    We have to stop and think of how many areas and people would be affected by one new law. You can think of it as an octopus. One central law affecting what ever is around it.|`|JXLiZEb2aa	I guess they didn't realize that many people get upset when a minority tries to impose it's morality on others through the government.|`|N5tYk0vWaa	Me being a Christian, I'm proud that someone finally stood up for the gay marriage thing. Good Job Mormon Church! It's about time!  |`|4e9c052d28c0608d1c958094fad6d765aa	ha i think its funny how people during the campaign people were calling mormons prejudice and discriminators, but now that prop 8 has passed, all the opposeres of this proposition are attacking the LDS church, hmmm......|`|5e0c2b6e245998c415bb4509ecae5500aa	The church did NOT donate any money. sheesh people, LOOK THINGS UP BEFORE YOU SPOUT YOUR MOUTH OFF!  The church encouraged it's people to campaign.  Now if you have a problem with them encouraging people to campaign that's fine I see where you're coming from.  But get your facts straight! it drives me crazy when people make up stuff to support what they think. ARGGHH|`|LxbYCvxWaa	Why are protestors protesting the church? Its the people of CA who voted for it. They already have civil unions and"marriage" is defined by churches so WhyTF do these people want to piss off the churches and try to steal their doctoines through law. They have defined marriage for a long time, so stop trying to distort their beliefs.     Also, what I don't get here...  it's ok for gays to try and push their values on people, but it's not ok for the churches to do the same? That sounds pretty hypocritical to me, and it seems these people are bitter they didn't get their way.|`|2wUvFmrhaa	THE MORMON CHURCH.  For the past six months, Mormon volunteers, directed by the Mormon Church, misled Californians about the effects of the Supreme Court ruling.     They told us we would lose the right to participate in our children's education. Lies.    They told us the California state public school curriculum would be modified to teach sex education to kindergartners. Lies.    They told us churches would lose the right to free speech. Lies.    If this is the way Mormons treat gays and lesbians of California, let us ask:    How has America treated Mormons?    Think about it...  So you see mormons would not want the government taking away what they "consider sacred!"    What if a law passed that stated that no more sealings after death or baptism ofter death!! LDS your'e banned, from doing that! It OFFENDING so many.    LDS/ mormons believe polygamy will be in your heaven for crying out loud...  Men have have two or more spiritual wives!! allt he polygamy of the past together forever...  Young married 34 wives and sisters, and a mother /daughter duo!  of his wives were already married!! 8 of those to faithful mormon men!!  What the point of that    Bigamy is OK! Polygamy is OK!  Gay marriage is not!    Pot meet kettle...|`|DVDYDaVSaa	Beats me.  Did the LDS members actually think they could participate in passing discriminatory laws and get no reaction whatsoever from those discriminated against?  Are they honestly that naive?    Oh, and the same goes for the Catholics and fundie christians who voted against it as well.  The mormons just made a much bigger show about their support.    Added for Rocket:  People want to marry the same sex because they're not attracted to the opposite sex.  Why you'd think they had experimented with many partners of both sexes is beyond me.  That's as ignorant as people thinking mormons still have lots of wives.|`|AA11472314	The church put no significant money into the campaign.    To reiterate: "Mormons" donated about $20 million to the campaign.  The "Mormon church" donated close to $0.    The protests are rooted in ignorance, because most don't seem to care about how poorly the law was worded, who actually gave and voted on Prop 8, and seem to think that a Mormon is a Mormon church.    Strange to me.|`|0CQzpukxaa	The LDS Church, while it remains politically neutral (Doesn't promote one party over another), It does become involved in issues that it sees fit to become involved in. Take Humanitarian aid. The church's outreach programs are huge, why? Because the church believes that it's important. The LDS Church believes that marriage is between one man and one woman. The Family is the central part of society of all cultures. Also, the LDS Church frowns on sexual relations outside of marriage. *OPINION COMING  UP* I believe the church frowns on same sex marriage because it insinuates that one person has "explored" sex with many partners of both sexes *OPINION ENDED* So, the LDS Church asked it's members to become politically active in their community (Which it's always done) to promote what was right and best for the people. Everyone has their own rights and beliefs, therefore, just because the LDS church was involved in pushing out their beliefs, doesn't give everyone else the right to call them bigots or treat them in such a manner of disgrace. Answer me this - Were there NO other church denominations involved in pushing the Yes vote on Prop 8? I would highly doubt that there were absolutely no Catholics, Protestants, Methodists, Muslim, Buddhists, etc... that weren't involved. People of the LDS faith are NOT a majority in California. There are other people of good conscience who felt that voting yes on prop 8 was the right thing to do. Of course they don't want anger directed their way-Would you? They stood up for something they believed and put out their voice into such a cruel and unforgiving world, which mind you, isn't the easiest thing to do. I think the LDS church knew they wouldn't be liked for posting their feelings toward Prop 8, but they did it anyway (standing up for belief). Anger obviously is never welcomed, especially after trying to state belief.|`|xsbperUraa	I've enjoyed every-ones answers.  Most of them seem really insightful.  World history is based on people sticking up for what they believe in.  The Civil war for example, one believed that people should be slaves, the other didn't.  They both stood up for their rights. Now ask yourself this before you go picking on anyone (Mormon, Catholic, Canadian......) think about the last time that you had to stand up for something that you believed in.  Speaking from a world situation, most of us don't like Americans because they BELIEVE that they are the best in the world at everything, it doesn't mean that we persecute them)  And if it's a money thing, how much many was wasted in the recent elections?|`|Xw3PRhxBaa	Actually, there were many people that voted for Prop 8 and don't belong to the Mormon church. You're just angry because you lost and want revenge, let's hope you don't start killing people on the street now. But if you want to talk about fanatics, then you should see the gay & lesbian militants because they do have an agenda just like any fascist movement. |`|d8AFtMQeaa	Although the Mormon church donated money they did not donate 25 million. They donated more like $2,078.97. However they did encourage their members to donate and do what they could to make sure the bill passed, which is where you are probably getting the 25 million dollers from.  Although I do not agree with the mormon church I also do not agree with the hatred people are showing towards them. Lots of organiziations donated on either side not just the LDS church. though I don't feel a church should have gotten involved at all.|`|sE382CcTaa	This anger behind this question is terrible.  It is nothing short of saying homophobia is wrong, but mormophobia is right.  The mormon people are being attacked for standing for their beliefs (and having the majority of the people cast their ballots in support of Prop 8).  And now the loosers are raging: "Can someone in CA please go burn down the Mormon temples there. I mean seriously. DO IT."  This is hate.|`|ifvHIpZ8aa	I think it might be because our church (and indeed, any church would feel the same) does not want gays, or anyone else, dictating to us how we should believe. I don't care if people wnat to have sex with each other, but I don't like it being forced down my throat. And I'm not going to stand by while a bunch of people try to tell me and my church that they should be allowed to do whatever they want and we should like it.     I don't have a problem with a gay couple having some sort of legal binding (like marriage) for legal purposes. But, do NOT tell me, or my church, that we have to accept it as God's will, when we believe God has said it is NOT His will. |`|xBcuGnHwaa	Because Mormons have every right to voice their opinion just as gays do.They shouldn't be hated for standing up for what they believe in. That's what makes America so great, freedom of speech and democracy.

cIPziIdnaa	Because the whole "gay marriage" issue is only the red herring for the real issue - the gay lobby attack on religious institutions in this country.  Otherwise they would work to achieve equality through civil unions and expanded domestic partner benefits.  But they really don't want equality; they want the issue, they want the fight.  $70 million was spent for and against Proposition 8 in California.  Whenever you have that much money at stake, no one ever wants to solve anything.  They gain more from the fight.|`|AA10282820	They know the Mormons won't get violent with them.|`|B5bzo2zCaa	If gays go after black people.

30da49ce7350d87aa6b90301d5bc7940aa	You have several choices, none of them pleasant:  1. You reconcile yourself to being miserable for the sake of your kids and to maintain the illusion of "normality"; 2. You tell you man how you feel and that you will never be happy, then deal with the fallout, whatever it may be; 3. Continue to lie to him, and cheat.  The drawbacks to each are what make them unpleasant.  1.  Nothing changes and you just stay miserable, not appealing but it's up to you, there have been many people who considered it the best option.  2.  He will be hurt, you will be outed, with all the attendant problems that entails, and depending on where you live you might even be at risk of losing your children.  There is also the question of living and financial arrangements, and how your friends and family will react, it would be a huge change, but at least you would have a chance at finally building a life that can bring you joy.  3.  Cheating is not only unfair to him, but would be to your new girlfriend, it would come out eventually, and then you would be back at option 2, but with infidelity thrown in, and, if you have gone through with the wedding, a very ugly divorce in which you would be seen as being at fault.  I can't pretend to know what you're going through, but these are things to consider.  Good luck, and you have my prayers.|`|Ip4nhAmAaa	I'd keep being miserable until your children are around 20 for they're sake. Or you could "cheat" on him. You could also see a doctor, I mean some sort of sex drug could help.|`|VM1UgW4Maa	Don't know are you christian?

Then start over,...gay.|`|tu8f9S4Baa	Well wouldn't you rather divorce while they have no idea what happened than have them be teenagers and stress over their falling apart family?    I say, it will be better in the long run if you get a woman you are happy with. You know you're sexually attracted to women. You may not get this chance if you keep faking it.    Just remember, there is nothing anyone can do about it. The choice is yours. You are a lesbian, it's time you show everyone :D|`|AlJLbvLPaa	Well, if you're faking it, you may not be hurting him, but you're not doing him any good. If he's not a bad guy, doesn't he deserve a chance to find someone who desperately wants him and thinks he's great for her? You may like him, but he's not the one you want, and he'd be happier with someone who was attracted to him.    Your kids may have a harder time while you're raising them as a single mom, yes, but your being unhappy in your marriage would most likely lead to your divorcing him later. Marriages are hard enough to maintain when people go into them fully wanting each other.     Tell the guy you're gay, tell him you want him to find someone he'll be completely happy with, and let him go. If you don't have a support system, find or build one--look for a Unitarian or accepting church, check out PFLAG or gay-rights groups in your area.|`|awLuydwxaa	usually people who claim they are bisexual or secretly gay even though they have a wife or husband, its usually because you are not getting something that you need and you need an escape, and obviously women tend to be more caring, so looking for other women is how you vent because you know since u are one that they have something you need. if thats not the case then i don't know. im just speaking from experience with alot of my female friends. they just need something int heir life a man cant give them|`|cE7XC7Sdaa	wow...  you definately waited too long to address the situation|`|p0FUZyt3aa	are you a guy or a ***?|`|McqnBDLHaa	Don't pretend to be someone who you are not!

Good luck.|`|QDUZLITyaa	I would be honest with everyone. You are never going to have anything real until you are real with yourself and the people around you.

It will definetely mess them up if they see you with a man and then a women. I know from experience. Good Luck.|`|75YEEOceaa	I am so sorry you are going through that.  It would have been better it you came out before having a family, but since you have one now, keep it together.  Pray to God for strength, and take care of your family now, and yourself later.  Also I would strongly urge you to call off the engagement with this guy.  Marriage is supposed to be a permanent thing.|`|xKMKaXyXaa	I think you should talk it out with your husband.  He deserves to know what is going on in your life.  I'm sure he wouldn't want to see you miserable.  Your kids will accept you for who you are.|`|vKdmV1YHaa	The best thing you can do for your kids is show them that it's ok to be yourself and find the right person for you. Pretending just makes matters worse.     My partner was married for 9 years & has 3 kids. The marriage deteriorated quickly and he became emotionally abusive. Not to say that's what your fiance would do, but it's not a good situation. I was also married for a couple of years (no kids) and the best thing I ever did was get out of the relationship. He wasn't a bad person, just not right for me.     My advice is get out of the relationship (if you're as miserable as you say you are) and take some time to get to know yourself alone. Look for online support groups. Move to a more supportive area (if you can).|`|c4afc61792e03b238580ed3a379ae6cfaa	This is a terrible situation. I really feel for you but you must tell the truth. One thing i have always said to my partner is 'Please tell me if you are unhappy and want to leave, not just because you want to leave YOUSELF but because it is unfair to me to be lied to . Yes I will be hurt, but i will also move on and the hurt will be temporary for the most part.' Maybe your partner also thinks this.     You are living a lie which must be awful. But your partner is living a lie too by default and that is extremely unfair becasue he hasn't chosen to. You are essentially controlling his life.    As difficult as it must be you MUST tell the truth, life is way too short for you both to be living like this. You think your partner is happy, but only because he thinks you are a different person. You must be honest, face the bad bad times (Im sure it will be tough) so that you can emerge from the storm a happier person.    Good luck with this. You have to be strong. You think you are protecting him but you are actually protecting yourself because you don't want to be responsible for someone else's pain.    Don't overly worry about your little babies. Children adapt very easily if you deal with it in an adult way.    Like I said - good luck :)

x1LmS9vTaa	Not bad!  You even got "filiabus."  It's not wrong, but you don't need the -b in "ab" if the next word begins with a consonant:  "a puer?s" (long -a-), for example.    In Latin, "villa" means "country home, country estate."  For "town," I usually use "oppidum, -?" (neuter).  Check your textbook.    EDIT:  I checked my dictionary, and "villa" can mean "village," which I suppose can mean "town," but it's the very last meaning.  First choice, I would use "oppidum"; if you haven't learned "oppidum" yet, you can use "urbs, urbis."    fr?mentum, -? (neut) = grain  port?, portare = to carry (also "fer?, ferre," an irregular verb)  servus, -? (masc.) = slave (male)    I think you can use "villa" for "farmhouse," but I'm not positive.  I think "villa" can cover more than just the living quarters.    patria, -ae (fem) = fatherland, one's coutry.  Whether or not to include the pronoun "mea" with "patria" depends on your textbook.  Wheelock usually does not include it because "patria" is one's own country by definition.  But to be on the safe side, you might want to add it.    "is occupied" takes the *passive* voice.  But which verb to use:  prehendo prehendere; prendo prendere; occupo occupare; maybe even teneo tenere?  See what your textbook has in the back.    There's no grammar in 4 & 5 that isn't in 1-3, so you should be good.  I know, the vocabulary's a real pain!|`|o8FB75gsaa	Hey, the English to Latin sentences are the ones where you do the most learning. If you skip them, you are screwing yourself over in the long run.

Ix3SfyDraa	Gnosis is direct spiritual experience, as opposed to intellectual knowledge.    Most people think of "the Gnostics" as members of one of the early Christian sects that were branded "heretical" by the coalescing "Catholic" Church bureaucracy.  In fact, they never would've referred to themselves as "Gnostics;" that's just our word to classify people who shared certain beliefs; and the tradition of such beliefs goes back centuries before Christianity.  The Christian gnostics were simply applying this tradition to Christian symbolism.    It's interesting, though, for the purposes of this question, to look at exactly why the Church was so hostile to these sects.  For "Gnostics," the Church bureaucracy of priests, bishops, etc was totally unnecessary.  They insisted on the supremacy of personal "revelation;" they weren't interested in simply believing what they were told by others who postured as "authorities."  They weren't looking to agree, and this infuriated the Church.  Of course, this attitude wasn't exactly conducive to the formation of an organization, while the Church's obviously was; that's why the Church won out, historically speaking.      See Elaine Pagels' excellent books on the subject, especially "The Gnostic Gospels," which deals with the Nag Hammadi scrolls.  There are also several editions of original "Gnostic" texts, both Christian and pre-Christian.|`|AA11192489	David H should explain to me how I became an agnostic atheist.    Anyway...    Gnosticism can mean a few things. Gnostics are a sort of Christian denomination that was around at the very beginning of Christianity. They had gospels, many of which were not included in the final canon of the Bible when the Council of Nicea voted on what the Bible would contain. Yes, I said, "voted".    Gnosticism can also mean holding a position that you think you "know" whether there is a god or not... as opposed to agnostic, which means "without knowledge" and describes the philosophy that the existence of a god is unknown and/or unknowable.    You can have a gnostic theist, a gnostic atheist, an agnostic theist, or an agnostic atheist. Most people are agnostic no matter how loud they preach their respective ideas.|`|973b2be8ef25466189bcc942cb435dc4aa	Starred for contacts.  :D    Ok, or I would have if starring worked.  Sorry.

Im gnot an Gnotstic.|`|13olHSmqaa	Gnostic refers to a diverse, syncretistic religious movement consisting of various belief systems generally united in the teaching that humans are divine souls trapped in a material world created by an imperfect spirit, the demiurge, who is frequently identified with the Abrahamic God.The demiurge, who is often depicted as an embodiment of evil, at other times as simply imperfect and as benevolent as its inadequacy allows, exists alongside another remote and unknowable supreme being that embodies good. In order to free oneself from the inferior material world, one needs gnosis, or esoteric spiritual knowledge available only to a learned elite. Jesus of Nazareth is identified by some (though not all) Gnostic sects as an embodiment of the supreme being who became incarnate to bring gnosis to the Earth.    However, if what you mean is really "Agnostic" then this is the belief that the existence of God is unknown and most likely unknowable due to subjective experience as well as the fact that we don't know what happens when we die. Basically, it is the acceptence of the fact that you don't know and noone else does either. This differs from Athiests who believe that there is no God.     Agnostism is really the only logical choice.|`|Um35noI1aa	knowledge

3sXv3QZ7aa	Hinduism is a religious tradition[1] that originated in the Indian subcontinent. Hinduism is often referred to as Santana Dharma (????? ????) by its practitioners, a Sanskrit phrase meaning "the eternal law."[2] Among its roots is the historical Vedic religion of Iron Age India.    Hinduism is often stated to be the "oldest religious tradition" or "oldest living major tradition."[3][4][5][6] It is formed of diverse traditions and types and has no single founder.[7] Hinduism is the world's third largest religion after Christianity and Islam, with approximately a billion adherents, of whom about 905 million live in India.[8] Other countries with large Hindu populations include Nepal, Sri Lanka, Indonesia (Bali), Malaysia, Singapore, Mauritius, Fiji, Suriname, Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago, Canada, and the United States.    Hinduism's vast body of scriptures is divided into ?ruti ("revealed") and Smriti ("remembered"). These scriptures discuss theology, philosophy and mythology, and provide information on the practice of dharma (religious living). Among these texts, the Vedas and the Upanishads are the foremost in authority, importance and antiquity. Other major scriptures include the Tantras, the Agama, the Pur?as and the epics Mahbhrata and Rmya?a. The Bhagavad Gt, a treatise from the Mahbhrata, spoken by Krishna, is sometimes called a summary of the spiritual teachings of the Vedas.[9]  Hinduism is a diverse system of thought with beliefs spanning monotheism, polytheism,[36] panentheism, pantheism, monism, and atheism. It is sometimes referred to as henotheistic (i.e., involving devotion to a single god while accepting the existence of others), but any such term is an overgeneralization.[37]|`|PkBMMvqTaa	they believe in many many gods....of fire, sun, moon....etc.  When you die, your next life will reflect your past life..if you were good...you can become something better....if you were bad, well, you might just turn back into a frog.|`|LuN1unJ3aa	Research Wikipedia.

Good deeds mean reincarnation in a higher form of life, bad in a lower one.  The ultimate aim is blissful disembodied oneness with the Universe.  There are countless deities, all manifestations of a single world soul, Brahman, and time is cyclical over billions of years.|`|e3ca9511c7f5d30fa7fbdc3102dea85baa	Hinduism is a monotheistic religion that seems like polytheistic.  The many different "gods" are but manifestations, roles, names, and forms of the same One God.  The religion recognizes three valid paths to wake up from this illusory dream (Maya) and realize that our true identity is God (Moksha or Self Realization). The three paths are Bhakthi Yoga (Devotion), Karma Yoga (Selfless Action) and Jnana Yoga (Wisdom).  Every religion falls in one of these three categories, which is why Hinduism accepts all religions as a valid path to God.    Moral laws (Dharma) that define the borders of good and bad actions, scientific laws such as the law of cause and effect (Karma), and incarnations of God (Avatars) are present to help us stay on track.      The ultimate message of Hinduism is to love all and serve all.|`|ZFMv1gFYaa	its a religion of a hindu people.|`|7dbee1f6c93abd6c7e55a681fdbdfc07aa	Hinduism is a polytheistic religion that consists of many stories with many forms of gods that have different values, concepts and knowledge that is followed by the many worshipers and hindu's around the world. The stories basically tell a person how to be a better person or human on this earth. Just like how the bible, the quran, and other religous scriptures tell you stories that help make you a better person, hinduism and its vibrant concepts reveal that same message through stories that may seem unreal, but in fact are real or mythical, in attempts to make a follower the best human he/she can be through meditation, penance, and offerings to God that are then showered back upon its worshipers.  God Bless.

6DmsiLGbaa	I know it seems really harsh that he can't come home or call more often.  My family is insanely close, and it was almost impossible for me to go knowing that I'd be out of contact with them like that.  I can't imagine how much harder it would be for you.  Still, having gone on a mission anyway...    When a person agrees to go on a mission, they're promising to devote all of themselves to God.  Every minute of every day is focused on the gospel of Jesus Christ, and it's all but impossible for most people to give that kind of dedication if they're worrying about family members or friends back home.  The work that your brother is doing truly does require everything that he has, and though I know it's hard to understand and probably still seems harsh, the sacrifice your brother is making really will be worthwhile in the end.    Right now, your brother is learning to sacrifice and work hard, to study and love the people around him.  He's learning more about God even as he teaches others, and he's learning just how much God watches over us.  He'll come back confident, happy, and stronger than you would ever have imagined he could be.  His entire life will be infinitely better for those two years.      And I'm sure it still seems like too much to you.  Please understand, though, that your brother is always going to look back on these two years as being the best and most important of his life.  He will grow more during this time than most of the rest of his life combined.  In fact, very few missionaries come back willingly--most have to be dragged home, kicking and screaming, and though I'm sure this is still hard for you, that really does say something.        |`|PeeIS28Oaa	A mission is 2 years straight of only Mormon Propaganda.

mFf8CqAraa	I know of many (successful) models who have children...    Just send out your head shots as normal.     Oh, and if they're telling you not to go through with the modeling, they're probably just jealous. ;)|`|Mzvp1LPFaa	If it wasn't the modelling agencies that told you this, I'd disregard it and forge ahead.  What if you didn't tell  them you had a child?  they probably are assuming that if you have given birth you are floppy and flabby, and clearly this is not the case.|`|x0J8S5sWaa	Hey you sound like me! I am also 5,8 with green eyes though I am 5 lbs heavier than you. I also have brown hair, though I think it's a little longer than yours.    Don't let others stop you from doing what you want to do. You are a good height (slightly short for a model maybe, but hey, look at Kate Moss. She's very famous and a little bit shorter than you). You weight is great too, though they might tell you to lose weight. As for having a child, hey, if you are fit that shouldn't matter. There are many models who have had children and continued their careers afterwards. Who is to say you can't start yours now? The people who are telling you not to do it are a) worried that you will be hurt if it doesn't happen or b) jealous and trying to keep you from chasing your dreams.    Goodluck :)|`|mnEkv7xdaa	Don't listen to "people." There will always be some loser, somewhere, trying to get in the way of you and your dreams. Consider them just a speedbump and keep going along on your intended path.     Good luck.|`|Iy36xZMOaa	I don't think they can legally deny you a career in modelling because you have kids, but they may try to deny you based on other criticisms even if they really don't want you because of the kid.  People are mean and they do discriminate.  That's reality.  They can hide it and say it's because of something else, but if they decide you can't do it because of the kid, you're toast (with at least that agency in question).    I would question your motivations though.  Why modelling?  Is it really what you want?  DO you have a back-up career??|`|C4BJ3yLWaa	You certainly could be a model. But the careers of supermodels makes it hard to work and have a family.  That is why many drop out by the time they are 30 to begin a family.  I say, go for it.|`|CJHGKG1Faa	I say you go for it and find out for yourself.  Don't let anyone tell you what you cannot do, if it is in you then that's all you need.  Good luck.|`|AA11288692	Agencies are all different. Whom ever is telling you those things have something very very wrong with them. Whats the harm in trying?    There are local agencies, local stores, promo spots, etc. that will enable you to model and be close/spend time with your son.  Good luck! And make sure you research the modeling companies you work with!|`|qZaOvstaaa	I just watched a True Hollywood Story episode on Heidi Klum.  She said that when she started modeling, everyone told her "no", but she never said "no" to herself.  Don't say no to yourself - just keep going and do what you want to do with your life.    And if they are telling you they will not hire you because you have a child, I believe that is discriminatory and you may be able to sue.  Good luck!

8gNVaICSaa	"Dwarfism" is a medical term, so technically that is right. However, I think they preferred to be called "little people"....or just looked at as anyone else. Midgets, leprechauns, etc. is just bad taste.|`|AA11828439	Altitude challenged.|`|O7SshRl6aa	Perhaps your best bet would be "short" or "petite".  There is no need to go any further than that.    By the way, dwarfism is a true medical condition, determined (I think) by measuring the proportions body parts against each other.|`|gHi5SVFuaa	people under 4'5 are called dwarves, and people under 4'0 are called gnomes|`|I7joAVCwaa	I've heard the terms "dwarf" and "little people" are the most 'polite' terms..although i don't recommend you calling them that|`|yegDdZfRaa	The correct term is "little people".|`|5lsRxMTVaa	i think the term is maybe a dwarf or little person but honestly they are still kind of mean just call them short or tiny and call them by their name so yeah that would be nice haha instead of accidently offending them.|`|3dfbb4b40a73e94ea451287d21a89751aa	Are you eff'n serious ? how about you just call someone by their name...

(for real - the one in the news today was in a trailer park)|`|d529cebfe13576f3ddee3e55b4cd08ffaa	I don't think there was a single place "where it was started." I really doubt any culture has believed it to be OK. Rather it's an action taken by people who have psychological problems.|`|HWoLbR7Aaa	Usually, we practice it at my sister's house.  It started back in '82, when we was real drunk.|`|NI0cNU22aa	My guess is on fundamentalist Mormon compounds. I read something about a rare genetic disease, common in 1 out of every 800,000 babies (I could be way off), that affected 1 out of every 300 children at the Texas compound.|`|LUGCxeuNaa	Ms. Taurus you're wrong.  Many places in the world (typically in less developed countries) families use brother to sister marriage as a way to gain money for the household.    I am sure that they also have incestuous sex.    To the idiot:  U of M teen sex and depression study finds most teens' mental health unaffected by nonmarital sex|`|oSME7B23aa	Incest frequently takes place in the south of America.|`|0rYRFVRjaa	Adam and Eve, Noah's whole nasty incest family.|`|564d359090a6d360bec9ee3849107a51aa	What a bunch of bull. People know God says to only have sex with their spouse. Social problem are based on sin and the willingness of the sinner to continue sinning. They don't love themselves enough to care enough to stop doing what they know God tells us not to do.     1 Corinthians 7:2 Nevertheless, to avoid fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband.     Galatians 5:16 This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh.    They refuse to obey these commands given to us by God.|`|AA10876206	In scientific terms, the first case of incest happened when the sexual reproduction first occurred.      In biblical terms, it happened with Cain & Abel's generation.    In FSM terms, who knows?!?  Pass the pasta.|`|8lMrfgDxaa	It started around the time of Adam and Eve, all the way to Native America, and other peoples to cults such as Mormon Fundamentalists or the FLDS Church which is the same practice of incest that the LDS Church practiced before.|`|ckLlUQfMaa	When it first started, it wasn't called incest. it was God's way to populate the world. He created Adam & Eve then they birthed Cain & Abel and their sisters (not mentioned in the OT) so who else was there to have sex with?    I believe it was in Leviticus where Gdd told them to stop having sex with anyone other than their spouse. As to where it is practiced the most. Contact the Bureau of Vital Statistics, maybe that's something they keep up with.|`|43803d780ffc252adf4bfa06ebc05097aa	i heard it started in virginia
fdMKpXCHaa	I'm not sure if you're a bad person, but you're definitely a whore.  Whether it's intentional or not (I think it is), you're pitting them against each other.  And you definitely are telling them you like stuff with the intention of getting them to buy it for you.  They are compensating for their age with their wallets, and they're aware of that too, so at least no one is getting hurt.  Good luck to you all.|`|4kqvnQtUaa	No, If you have the money do it. Get what YOU want with YOUR money.|`|M7o5lejQaa	just don't be surprised when it bites you in the *** one day.|`|hZiwiboRaa	Wow. Cool you're totally taking advantage of them!  (Don't worry though) I'd keep doing it for small things. But  i wouldn't try anything big!

oiNkygNtaa	where here cause are parents couldn't control there hormones and life is about what ever you make it about|`|pcHCLfZkaa	This is going to get complicated, so bear.    I think life is something we should cherish, because we only have it once. When we're gone, we're gone. And not coming back. And some people say that Earth is hell -- Well, it's not. It's what you have, so cherish it.    Life is just life. No other way around it. Although, I do believe there is somebody who created it *all*, I do not think that religion is real. We are all here for something -- but not everybody realizes we're here for the same thing.    The animals we look down upon are just like us in a way. Have you ever wondered that we could be little lifeforms, like them, compared to another giant community, or something of that nature? We look down upon them. but if we look up at the sky, we see that we're just as small as them.     Life is just life. :l No real way to explain why we're here, or how we got here. (:

0KR4wyoQaa	V  -  i think?|`|q0rGhf0vaa	The letter was shaped like a V. Thus the 'voice of the people" would have looked like VOX POPVLI.    Since Roman Latin is a dead language linguists sometimes debate as to weather or not Romans would have said the word VOX like we do, or if it would have sounded more like YOU-OX. There are lots of examples of Latin words that we know exist, but we have no idea how the Romans would have said them. Even a word like CAESAR would probably have been pronounced KAY-SAR.    Also, the ONLY used capital letters -- small letters weren't introduced until after 800 AD

I am not for capital punishment.|`|Iva8drdfaa	I think execution should be legal, only during times of war, and none other.

I have seen just what they said of him being truly evil. He had his armies bomb the Iraqi Kurds with mustard gas. He practically killed 50,000 just in one city by doing this.Then sent his army in to see what the effects of it had done, and if it was effective enough. Not to mention what he did to his own family when he killed his brother in laws. He had to pay for what atrocities he committed, just as we all do when we go against the laws of the land and have to have law and order.    It is sad that people are so blinded like he was and convince themselves that they are doing the right thing. (like Hitler also). But for the grace of God, we would all be condemned to a horrible death as these men were.|`|3ba0ab7304ca31210254987d14dbe035aa	I'm not sure how to answer that.

All of these children did incest to have more children and it is likely that other incest other than brother/sister took place.|`|LqyOHY37aa	If you believe the story to be factual then yes, they would have to.

It was perfectly safe to have children with your sibling back then.  Even in Abraham's day, it was still common, to a degree, as Sarah was Abraham's half-sister.    It is not until Moses' day that incest is explicitly forbidden.|`|mA6ef2LNaa	Yes they were married because God performed the first ceremony and sanctified it and when God made man and woman he called it a union between him and them.  Figure this out that if God created heaven and earth and put life into man, why would they not be married when he gave adam and eve to be our first example?  Today this is why  when you get married and have a family, this called a marriage union for people recite their vows.|`|wy54YPuQaa	Adam is a Hebrew word for 'man'.

(Re 13:8; compare Re 14:1,?4.) Those enrolled in the Lambs scroll are spoken of as entering the holy city, New Jerusalem, thus becoming part of the heavenly Messianic Kingdom. (Re 21:2, 22-27) Their names are written both in the Lambs scroll and in the other scroll, Gods book of life.Php 4:3; Re 3:5.

WjRqYf6naa	Well, let's see how Mormonism lines up against the foundational beliefs of Christianity:    Christians believe that we are justified by faith alone - Mormons insist that good works are necessary for salvation.    Christians believe that the Bible is the inerrant word of God and the final authority on matters of faith.    Christians believe in the Trinity, One God in Three Persons, forever and ever. - Mormons reject this belief and even teach that Jesus and Satan are "spirit brothers."    Christians believe that Jesus Christ was fully God and fully man. - Mormons teach that Jesus was a created being.    Christians believe in the literal return of Christ to the Earth at some point in the future. - Mormons, to the best of my knowledge, believe this also, even though their view of the apocalypse is somewhat different from ours.    It is easy to see from just a cursory look at basic doctrines that Mormons are not Christians, though their religion is closely related to Christianity.    I am not trying to bash Mormons, and I don't hate them. My son converted to Mormonism a few years back and I certainly still love him very much, even though we will never see eye to eye on spiritual issues.    God bless.|`|tManvxfQaa	well they call themselves Christian ..However from the Bible's perspective of Truth , they are not...Cause THey Deny Jesus as God and they Deny Christ the Redeemer and the Sole Foundation of the beginning and the end...They deem their prophets writings as absolute yet the actual Bible inspired and written of God by the Spirit and direction of God as only as accurate as long as it doesn't interfere with their own doctrines and traditions.  So it is also with the JW's and also sadly most self claimed christians who are attending churches all across this Nation , whether they are called Baptist , Catholic , Protestant , Pentecostals , Holiness , Apostolic , Lutheran , Methodist etc etc etc.......  They all have a touch of Truth , yet 9 out of 10 of them do not know who the God of the Bible really is !!!|`|799756bd4c88f2ce87a508802ca1e9cdaa	NO!

Many would not agree, but they forget that Christianity's most fundamental belief is that Jesus is God and the Savior. I find that most Mormons believe that.    Jehovah's Witnesses do not believe that Jesus is God, however, (at least by what I've read and heard), so I don't believe them to be Christians.|`|1cGlucXyaa	They believe in God and Jesus, but not the God and Jesus of the Bible.|`|KgsfMJWTaa	I'm a Christian because I'm a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.

I lived with Mormon roommates and they are 100% good people, pray in Christ's name.      But I see many Christians would "exclude" the Mormons for one reason or another.Seems the little doctrinal things are made too much of -- y'all need to focus on the core values.|`|XmJZkFuMaa	Only if you use the Nicean Creed to define Christianity more than the Bible would anyone call them not-Christian.|`|AA11232725	Momonism is "apostate Christianity". That means that while that religion contains some elements of the Christian faith, they have fallen away from some of the essential of the Christian faith like when they claim that Jesus and Lucifer (Satan) are "spirit brothers" of their father God Elohim.    The Bible is clear that Satan is a fallen angel and that Jesus is the eternal Son of God who has always been with God and is God.    John 1:1  In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.  2  He was in the beginning with God.  3  All things were made through Him, and without Him nothing was made that was made...14  And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.    Revelation 12:7  And war broke out in heaven: Michael and his angels fought with the dragon; and the dragon and his angels fought,  8  but they did not prevail, nor was a place found for them in heaven any longer.  9  So the great dragon was cast out, that serpent of old, called the Devil and Satan, who deceives the whole world; he was cast to the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.|`|3ba0ab7304ca31210254987d14dbe035aa	Mormons say yes.  Sadly, this is not so as their beliefs do not line up with the bible.

God has written the knowledge of Himself in our hearts and in our conscience.  You know there is a God, now seek HIm.

God is to the scientist a primal force, to the philosopher a hypothesis of unity, to the religionist a living spiritual experience. Man's inadequate concept of the personality of the Universal Father can be improved only by man's spiritual progress in the universe and will become truly adequate only when the pilgrims of time and space finally attain the divine embrace of the living God on Paradise. Page 30-10    Even though material mortals cannot see the person of God, they should rejoice in the assurance that he is a person; by faith accept the truth which portrays that the Universal Father so loved the world as to provide for the eternal spiritual progression of its lowly inhabitants; that he "delights in his children." God is lacking in none of those superhuman and divine attributes which constitute a perfect, eternal, loving, and infinite Creator personality.

I'm sure you believe in something, though. Most people believe in love, so I'd ponder that one. You might even be thinking, "of course I believe in love, that's not the same thing." Well, I ask you what empirical evidence you have of love. It's trickier than you might think. The more you explore your beliefs, the closer you'll get to God. If it's any consolation, many believers never actually find God, and those that do have a difficult time sustaining it. All I can assure you of is that it can be done. Incidentally, evolution doesn't prove or disprove God, though it does go a long way to show that creation myths are best understood as metaphors.|`|G9VBTg47aa	The character Jesus leads a good example, real or no, he still places the importance of the spirit over earthly comforts.

The theory of evolution is the persistent progressional change of all life forms in which small variances from one generation to the next unconsciously conspire to evolve itself to better suit the conditions presented to the species.  Thus, all species are in a transitional state that never rests into perpetuity.  That being said it should be odd that ANY fossils of the same species would be alike in manner within the vast fossil record considering how infrequent a perspective fossil would find itself the beneficiary of the unlikely matter of events that takes a such snapshot in time.  But the contrary is true in as much that all species within the fossil record appear suddenly without previous representation and just as suddenly disappear void of any transitional manifestations or advantageous improvements that evolution relies upon.  Scientists can only point to two representative fossils and draw an unscientific unproven conclusion that one evolved into the other.  In fact there are innumerable examples of this.  But, the one thing that doesn't exist in all of creation and the vast fossil record *IS THE FOSSIL IN BETWEEN THOSE TWO*!!!!   There is not one single example in the vast universe of billions of known fossils that depicts an intermediary(missing link) of any species whatsoever.  Youve heard of the missing link in reference to human bones/fossils,  well every single species that has ever existed is totally void of a single example of a missing link for ANY species.  They simple do not exist.    Scientist stick to the world of unfamiliar and vague species to hang their hat on in the evolution lie.  Why?  Because its easier to make a sales pitch using scientific vernacular and long extinct reptiles and shellfish than it is to work in the realm of the understandable and familiar. In short, there are no "almost" elephants.  No "almost giraffes".  For evolution to be true one should find innumerable giraffes of varying stages of evolution.  It should be rare that two are the same.  Yet all are the same.  there are no exceptions.  Period.   Again, the scientists ply their trade utilizing the vague and plausible while avoiding the 'naked king' standing in front of everybody.  The only thing that can be gleaned from the fossil record are implied or coincidental similarities that fall radically short of a hundred million year progression of successively improved archetypes within the same species line.  If evolution were valid the entire fossil record would consist of almost entirely different and varied subsequent species over the eons.  Exactly the opposite is true, and that is the entire fossil record is static and unvaried.  The fact is, you can go out and dig up some saber tooth tiger bones and they will be exactly like those from one million years before.|`|AA12341690	I'd ask them why they'd want to believe in god.

Just because a single god religious idea is popular right at this particular moment in history doesn't give enough evidence of his existance.    You should be searching for actual evidence and not just fill in gaps of knowledge. Using the logic of this question you can also say "prove dragons, fairies, and elves are not real" and you have the same burden of proof with the same lack of evidence.

From what I have gathered from novels and books and things, it seems like not that long ago (eg. 50 to 100 years) "Good Christian" was synonymous with someone who was kind, hard-working and a support to the community.  Christian acts were acts of kindness and generosity.    Our (Western) culture is now saturated with the values of selfishness, self-aggrandizement and gluttony.  That makes for a general degradation of everyone, not just Christians... although Christians are not immune from the effects of such widespread "selfishness values" - it takes great diligence to combat those values and remove them from your own psyche.  I rely on God and Christ in faith, and try to become more like them every day.  I'm still pretty selfish, but I can see that I'm making progress (and I can see the hand of God in my life, making that happen - often through painful experiences and the guidance of the "still small voice" within).    We've got a lot to combat to bring about love and peace, and there are many people who are trying hard to bring this about.  Maybe you would join us?  Start with trying to create a Christ-like person within yourself... and then there will be one more person who shines as a Christ-like light for others to be strengthened by.  I find that idea rather empowering.    Peace be with you.|`|TzY9vkinaa	It's impossible to be exactly like Christ.

I'm one of them.  A lot of denominations teach that some of the teachings are Legalism and therefore binding and not setting one free as Christ said.|`|0rBpirPCaa	They are not really christians.  They are professed christians, pretending to be christians.  There are true christians out there that are Christlike but very few.  True christians follow GOD'S Commandments and the laws of nature, are humble, sincere, have mercy on people, not high minded, helps the sick and the poor, and so on.  We can be perfect in CHRIST only.  The Bible says so in the New Testament of the KJV Bible, "Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect."  Matthew 5:48.(I advise you to read that whole chapter).  "Finally, brethen, farewell. Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the GOD of love and peace shall be with you." 2 Corinthians 13:11.   To be perfect is to be sincere by loving GOD, and by showing our love to GOD we will serve HIM as we learn of what HE wants us to do as we go through this life.  If we do this, our reward will be eternal life.  "Blessed are they that do His Commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city. Revelation 22:14.  Efforts are not being made to be perfect in CHRIST because most do not want to follow GOD'S RULES.  They call HIS name but they are not doing what HE wants them to do.  So if a person is claiming to be a christian and have the characteristics of the devil, they are not christians.  Christians have the characteristics of GOD.  Sadly, most of the church going people are not christrians, they are of the secular world.  True people of GOD are coming out of the churches because the two different characteristics cannot dwell together.  Some of the True Christians are worshipping at home.  Christrians are suppose to be of one mind in CHRIST, not nice today and cruel tomorrow. www.vbates.com

But we do have to agree as to who Jesus is and his redemptive work.|`|XSh0u9Kwaa	Today the "truth" is based upon the teachings, laws, doctrines, precepts, and commandments of men superseding the Truth of YHVH.    Many teachings especially of Christianity and in respect to certain aspects of Judaism with its Oral Tradition (Oral law / Torah) divert upon the path of the Truth.     The Truth being the written Hebrew Torah "Law" of YHVH as given through His servant Moses. And through His Prophets people are called to return or repent back to those Torah instructions which have been rejected.    Psa 119:142  Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, And Thy law is truth.    Psa 119:151  Thou art near, O LORD, And all Thy commandments are truth.      If we cannot agree that the written Torah is Truth and listen to the sent Prophets there will always be division.     Neh 9:29  And admonished them in order to turn them back to Thy law. Yet they acted arrogantly and did not listen to Thy commandments but sinned against Thine ordinances, By which if a man observes them he shall live. And they turned a stubborn shoulder and stiffened their neck, and would not listen.      3 John 1:4  I have no greater joy than this, to hear of my children walking in the truth. - (The Torah in Messiah)

John was also prophesying about  the gnostic cults that would arise later.  A perfect example is the gnostic cult that followed a man named Arius.  They denied that Jesus was "of the same substance" as the Father.  This lead to his condemnation as a heretic at the Council of Nicea.  Today, the Jehovah's Witnesses, Mormons and others are still practicing this lie.
AA10311549	What kind of "life' are you talking about?    The embryo is a POTENTIAL human beling.    About 25 to 30 % of all embyros are spontaneously aborted.    What is the definition of a human being?    Note that even now people "pull the cord" in hospitals all the time when there is no longer any brain activity.  It is assumed that they are NOT killing a human being.    Does this mean that where there is no ratiocination, no self awareness, there can NOT be a human being?    Why is this not a reasonable conclusion to make?    All human life and all potential human life should be held in serious consideration, and reverence.    However, why should a NON-human life, even a POTENTIAL human life, have either equal or higher right to continued existence than the mother?    There is NO simple answer to the question of abortion.  People who wan simplistic answers get instead the answers of simpletons.    I suspect that most people are neither totally pro-choice nor totally pro-life.      I happen to be pro reason.  A POTENTIAL life is to be reveared and protected BUT it is NOT a human being.  And is not to be considered one.  A mother IS a REAL life, IS a human being and as such she TOO has the right to life.    I believe that only a serious consideration should allow one to opt for an abortion.    One such consideration is the obvious necessity to save the life of the mother as in an ectopic or tubal pregnancy.    Other people believe that in the case of rape, the seriousness is sufficient to warrant an abortion.    I agree that these points are debatable, but let us do with logic, reason, and FACTS.    The assumption that at the moment of conception we have a human being is NOT a fact.  And so long as people refuse to argue true facts no concensus nor even understanding can take place.    ======================================...  Obviously FALSE statements:  1)  "Life begins, according to the buy-bull, when the baby takes a breath."  I assume you mean HUMAN life.  2)  "At the zygote stage."    Again I assume you mean HUMAN LIFE.  3)  "When the live sperm fertilizes the live egg and a new life is conceived, that is when human life begins."    IF this were true then the termination of a patient with no brain activity would be prosecuted as murder.  4)  "HUMAN life begins at conception."    All that DNA stuff is irrelevant.  This is ONLY a potential human being.  A fetus of a bird functions.  A car functions.  A live bird functions.  But NONE of these as a human being.  5)  "The abortionists is willing to forfeit someone else's life so that they may gratify their own."  I assume because of the beginning of your answer that you here mean human life.  Again the assumption is obviously false.  For reasons already stated.    ======================================...  Obviously FUZZY thinking -- terms NOT properly defined.  Define "life" please.  Is this HUMAN LIFE?  And if you mean this then tell us why?  You can not make such a far reaching statement without giving just cause.    1)  "When cells multiply, that signifies growth. That is when there's life."   2)  "The Christians inability to quantify the point of conception doesnt equate to abortionists having the right to end life as they see fit. The burden of proof lies in the one who is doing the killing, not the saving."  Irrational thinking.  Quantifying the point of conception is irrelevant.  To use the word "KILL" here implies again a HUMAN BEING.  There is none in early stages of pregnancy.  3)  "But in these last days mankind has degenerated to a point that virtue has become a byword to be scorned and laughed upon."  Another irrationality and also irrelevant.  In point of fact. looking at history, mandkind is at perhaps the highest level of "morality" ever seen.  Your argument is problematic because the parameters of "morality" are not agreed upon.  One thing IS certain.  The past 40 years has prob ably seen the least percentage of warfare globally in the history of mandkind.  For the first time in most of human history almost all civilized nations no longer believe that slavery is a moral institution.  The secularizations of most of the world governments has finally allowed the greatest growth of human civil rights in the history of mankind.  Where you see "degeneration" I see progress.  And segments of human kind have "SEEN" the so-called "last days" many many times over the course of history.  4)  "The motive of abortion isn't to be found in any recognizable virtue but is born out of the lusts of the flesh and a heart waxed cold."  A gratuitous assumption not founded on fact.  My neice had an abortion of a tubal pregnancy.  I assure you her decision was NOT one of lusts.  All encompassing statements like this are counterproductive to any rational argument. The remainder of your remarks are gratuitous.  Although i do admit that many abortions SHOULD NOT TAKE place and are the result of selfish desires, but NOT because they are the termination of a HUMAN LIFE.  ====================================  A statement which we must explore further:  1)  "The reason 98% of women getting abortions has to do with the fact that a baby simply cuts into the 'action', the fun, the sex, the parties, the travel and the money."    You are finally getting somewhere.  However, to state that all abortions terminate HUMAN life is FALSE.  But on the other hand you have never made any statement addressing this other 2%!  (Even if I question your exact numbers).|`|mSFjbetxaa	Life begins, according to the buy-bull, when the baby takes a breath.

The spirit enters the combination of the sperm and the egg and thereafter is a human soul. I'm not saying I agree with this, but this is what I think they mean.|`|LYnuEdKUaa	HUMAN life begins at conception.  The fertilized egg is fully functioning (though function at that point is rather simplistic), and has a full set of DNA.  Since it functions, it is alive.  Since it has a full set of DNA, it is fully human.  That's what we mean by "life begins at conception".    edit - no.  I was just giving you the simplified answer.  If you want to factor in supermales and superfemales and all of that, my explanation's length would outweigh my laziness and would stop mid-sentence at some point.  A short, but complete answer seemed more appropriate.|`|ATPPWOpWaa	The Christians inability to quantify the point of conception doesnt equate to abortionists having the right to end life as they see fit.  The burden of proof lies in the one who is doing the killing, not the saving.  It has always been the human condition that mankind has sought a good name and to be of good report.  And all men according to their various abilities did seek to perfect virtue and character.   But in these last days mankind has degenerated to a point that virtue has become a byword to be scorned and laughed upon.    Selfish ambition and gratification is the new religion and modern society always strives to become the full pattern of pop culture as defined by the media.  All the while being unawares of what was lost.      The motive of abortion isn't to be found in any recognizable virtue but is born out of the lusts of the flesh and a heart waxed cold.  What does abortion have to do with compassion, empathy, fortitude, generosity, honesty, honor, hopefulness,  humility, innocence,  joy, kindness, lovingness, mercy,  patience, peacefulness, sympathy, temperance, thankfulness, trustworthiness, truth or wisdom?    But abortion proceeds from the darkness of the heart and is synonymous with apathy, carelessness, excess, envy, greed, indulgence, infidelity, ingratitude,  immorality, impatience, impurity, irresponsibility,  laziness, lust, promiscuity,  selfish ambition, self gratification and sensuality.    The reason 98% of women getting abortions has to do with the fact that a baby simply cuts into the 'action', the fun, the sex, the parties, the travel and the money.   Nowhere is the face of a beautiful baby considered or love or happiness for someone else.  The abortionists is willing to forfeit someone else's life so that they may gratify their own.

The bible says that you must believe and do God's will to get to heaven, and while person A did God's will, he did not believe.  But the bible also shows us that God is infinitely merciful, meaning that if person A does not believe through no fault of his own(like say, being driven away by bigoted fundies), God may have mercy on him and let him into heaven anyway.  I'd like to think person A receives God's mercy and gets to heaven.    2. Person B gets to heaven, but not before being cleansed of the stain of his sin "as through fire" as 1 Cor 3:15, Mt 5:26, and Rev 21:27, among others, imply.

HE SEES THE BIG PICTURE AND SOME THINGS WE ARE NOT MEANT TO UNDERSTAND|`|DzXeJ66Daa	Sorry if ya don't like it but, here goes:  person "A" is condemned & person "B" is not.  Explanation:    Person A lived his whole life without any recognition of God. He was a "good" person, in human terms. Unfortunately, God's definition of good is different from ours. It's said that there are different levels of Hell; I've also heard that hell is eternal separation from God, and since this person didn't want God in his life During life, God won't force Himself on him in eternity.   We are all born with a "fallen" nature; that is, our "spirit" is dead...from birth. That's why Jesus said we must be "born again" The spirit is the part of us that can recognize and commune with God. We are a spirit that possesses a soul and inhabits a body. The eternal part of us has to be brought back to it's intended state through an act of Grace on the part of God, and an act of faith and obedience on our part.   Once you're dead, this is clear, but perhaps too late.    Person "B" snuck in under the wire,and gained salvation    p|`|E9chZY74aa	Being good is one thing.  Doing it because one wants to please God is another.      Here is what we know.  Good and Evil coexist and has eternally.  But God has told us that He will judge all and separate Good from Evil forevermore.  He judges according to the law that He has established and written for man, known as the Bible.  Anyone who does what God commands will get the reward that God has written.  Anyone who refuse to do as God commands get what they have chosen, life for all eternity without God.|`|X9rXRNUxaa	A is a NON-believer and therefor is not worthy of even being considered for heaven,  but would be IF he was to accept Jesus as his saviour as b has done      .|`|VRl1jENHaa	Both person A and person B had the SAME OPPORTUNITY to repent and believe the Gospel.  So yes, it's perfect justice.    As for your other 2 questions:    1) the atheist is held responsible for his decision and is condemned to Hell.    2)  the believer is held responsible for his decision and is taken to Heaven.    3)  As I explained above, each had the same opportunity; the only difference is that B took it and A refused it.|`|Y3Z6B7dHaa	who are we to judge?|`|f10424ac1ac7b1791b4f665094823d61aa	It goes to show what an unjust religion Christianity has become for people to think that Person A will go to hell.    It's a pity, because many of Jesus's teaching are of peace, love and forgiveness.    In a Just World, Person A would go to heaven and probably will, because Heaven and Hell are all in the mind and not real places at all.    We carry our own heaven or hell with us where-ever we go.|`|vSomavIzaa	That's an excellent question, and I understand how it gets tricky. But God isn't interested so much in our good works, although He tells us that if we have faith we will also have works. In fact, He calls our acts of righteousness "filthy rags" when done under own own power. Sometimes it is frustrating, because I know some "lost" people who are "better people" than some Christians I know, but the Bible is clear- without Jesus, you perish. Remember the thief on the cross made a last minute conversion and a change of heart as he hung there dying next to Jesus, and Jesus told him "today you will be with me in paradise". It doesn't seem fair that a common thief would be forgiven while a "good man" perishes, but that's the Word of God. I believe it to be true.   Someone asked Jesus a question once, very similar to yours. Here is how Jesus responded. This may help answer your question better than anything I have to say.    "For the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire men to work in his vineyard. He agreed to pay them a denarius for the day and sent them into his vineyard.    "About the third hour he went out and saw others standing in the marketplace doing nothing. He told them, 'You also go and work in my vineyard, and I will pay you whatever is right.' So they went.      "He went out again about the sixth hour and the ninth hour and did the same thing. About the eleventh hour he went out and found still others standing around. He asked them, 'Why have you been standing here all day long doing nothing?'   " 'Because no one has hired us,' they answered.         "He said to them, 'You also go and work in my vineyard.'   "When evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman, 'Call the workers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last ones hired and going on to the first.'   "The workers who were hired about the eleventh hour came and each received a denarius. So when those came who were hired first, they expected to receive more. But each one of them also received a denarius. When they received it, they began to grumble against the landowner. 'These men who were hired last worked only one hour,' they said, 'and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden of the work and the heat of the day.'   "But he answered one of them, 'Friend, I am not being unfair to you. Didn't you agree to work for a denarius? Take your pay and go. I want to give the man who was hired last the same as I gave you. Don't I have the right to do what I want with my own money? Or are you envious because I am generous?'   "So the last will be first, and the first will be last."    -Matthew 20:1-16|`|UqhApIvHaa	It is up to God|`|1cGlucXyaa	Person A goes to hell and person B goes to heaven. Its not unfair. The Bible says that there is no one good person. We are ALL sinners.     Psalm 53:3         3(A)Every one of them has turned aside; together they have become corrupt;           There is no one who does good, not even one.       Isaiah 64:6        6For all of us have become like one who is (A)unclean,           And all our (B)righteous deeds are like a filthy garment;           And all of us (C)wither like a leaf,           And our (D)iniquities, like the wind, take us away.     Romans 3:23  For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.|`|3qnZKLcTaa	According the Christianity, person A goes to hell and person B will be judged by God (God may not deem his repentance worthy enough, that is for Him to decide.)

Cremation has been looked at as a denial of this doctrine but modern teaching recognizes that God is all powerful and cremation is not really an issue to our bodily resurrections.    The policy of the Catholic Church is: "While the Church recommends that the pious custom of burying the bodies of the dead be observed, cremation is permitted as long as it had not been chosen for reasons contrary to Church teaching.    Cremated remains are to be treated with the same respect given to the remains of a human body, and should be buried or entombed. The scattering of cremated remains on the sea or on the ground, or keeping them in the home, is not the reverent final disposition that the Church requires.

ehBPus3Zaa	God's Word or the Bible.|`|9Dq2176oaa	The sword of the spirit. Gods word, or message, recorded in the Bible is like a powerful two-edged sword that can cut down religious falsehood and help righthearted people find spiritual freedom. (John 8:32; Hebrews 4:12) This spiritual sword can also defend us when we are assaulted by temptations or apostate attempts to destroy our faith. (2?Corinthians 10:4,?5) How thankful we are that all Scripture is inspired of God and completely equips us for every good work!2?Timothy 3:16,?17.     When he was tempted by Satan in the wilderness, Jesus effectively used the sword of the spirit to fend off false reasoning and cunning temptations. To each challenge of Satan, he replied: It is written. (Matthew 4:1-11) David, one of Jehovahs Witnesses in Spain, likewise found that the Scriptures helped him to overcome temptation. When he was 19 years old, an attractive young woman who worked in the same cleaning company suggested that they have a good time together. David rejected her advances and asked his supervisor for work in a different area so that the situation would not arise again. I remembered the example of Joseph, David said. He rejected immorality and immediately got out of the way. I did the same.Genesis 39:10-12.     Jesus also used the sword of the spirit to help others escape from Satans control. What I teach is not mine, said Jesus, but belongs to him that sent me. (John 7:16) To imitate Jesus skillful teaching, we need training. Regarding Roman soldiers, the Jewish historian Josephus wrote: Every soldier is every day exercised, and that with great diligence, as if it were in time of war which is the reason why they bear the fatigue of battles so easily. In our spiritual warfare, we need to use the Bible. Moreover, we must do our utmost to present ourselves approved to God, as workmen with nothing to be ashamed of, handling the word of the truth aright. (2?Timothy 2:15) And how much satisfaction we experience when we use the Scriptures to answer an interested persons sincere question!|`|KgsfMJWTaa	The Holy Spirit can pierce the hearts of saints and sinners...in a good way.|`|j74G3t51aa	Eph 6:17-And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:  In other words, The Holy Bible.

That is the good news.|`|VRl1jENHaa	The Scriptures are clear on this matter:  we are NOT saved by anything we have done ... we are saved ENTIRELY by what God has done, both for us and through us.    Anyone who accepts Jesus' sacrificial death as the atonment for his or her sins and follows His commandments is saved.  That's God's promise.  If a person believed in Jesus with all his heart, mind and soul and obediently followed His commandments, yet still ended up in Hell, then God would be a liar -- which is impossible.|`|mLYFbStGaa	If I trusted in my own works, I would not make it to heaven.  Trying our best has nothing to do with salvation.    Salvation is the free gift of God, based solely on Christ's righteousness, not our own.  There is absolutely nothing I can do to add to or subtract from my salvation.  Only rewards are affected by our works, not our salvation.    Rom 10:9  that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.   Rom 10:10  For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.   Rom 10:11  For the Scripture says, "WHOEVER BELIEVES ON HIM WILL NOT BE PUT TO SHAME."   Rom 10:12  For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord over all is rich to all who call upon Him.   Rom 10:13  For "WHOEVER CALLS ON THE NAME OF THE LORD SHALL BE SAVED."     Tit 3:3  For we ourselves were also once foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving various lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful and hating one another.   Tit 3:4  But when the kindness and the love of God our Savior toward man appeared,   Tit 3:5  not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to His mercy He saved us, through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit,   Tit 3:6  whom He poured out on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Savior,   Tit 3:7  that having been justified by His grace we should become heirs according to the hope of eternal life.       Joh 3:14  And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up,   Joh 3:15  that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life.   Joh 3:16  For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.   Joh 3:17  For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved.   Joh 3:18  "He who believes in Him is not condemned; but he who does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.|`|TgfuqPiLaa	God is perfect, man is not.

The apostle Paul, who gave us the Gospel of the Grace of God, which was given to him by direct revelation from the risen Lord Jesus Christ, wrote,""That we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in Christ. In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise, Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory."    This means that as soon as you believe that the Lord Jesus died for your sins, was buried, and was risen to justify you to the Father, you were sealed with the holy Spirit of promise. This means that you are saved until He comes to claim you.    What you do has nothing to do with whether or not you go to heaven, for salvation is not of works.    This information comes by direct revelation to Paul, from the risen Lord Jesus, and tells you what God's mind is, concerning this.|`|jdKOejikaa	ur gonna burn with us|`|ZvTbDyxUaa	...    well, he is just, and there's also the Harrowing of Hell, where everybody condemned to hell has a chance to go freak out and accept Jesus, effectively saving them.|`|zefFTf8Aaa	the one thing you forgot....  grace.|`|rU6nh42Eaa	I assume that by "Evangelical Christians" you mean really fundie types, not the literal meaning of Christians who spread the Good News.

This statement might be true about Islam but NOT Christianity.    The Prophet said, "By Allah, even though I am the Apostle of Allah, yet I do not know what Allah will do with me." Burkhari vol V, no. 266      Salvation is by Faith and you are talking about doubt. If anyone has this kind of doubt in him, surely he is NOT going to be saved.      Peace!

It does, however, make a lot of sense for religious leaders and tribal or governmental leader to claim that God is slighted so as to keep tight control over their power base.  A good example is when the founder of the church of the flying spaghetti monster made fun of a religious school committee member.   Her response was "It is a sin to mock God"  Nobody in their right mind would have concluded he was mocking God   It was blatantly obvious he was mocking her, the school committee member.   But I guess she wouldn't get to much mileage out of claiming "It is a sin to mock a Kansas school committee member!"  So she substituted God.  Kind of makes you wonder if she thought SHE was God, or spoke for Him or something.|`|7422ddf097669bd7b6e3d48e56258b87aa	He typically does, except for one very particular type, accompanied by one rather unique set of circumstances.|`|mWDuSsqwaa	because he is a fictional character|`|eAMq1iBWaa	It's only blasphemy of His Holy Spirit that is unforgiveable.

The Holy Spirit is the Third Person of the Godhead. The message of the Holy Spirit is that Jesus is the only way to heaven. The blasphemy of the Holy Spirit is dying without having believed in Jesus.     So believe the truth about Jesus now, and you'll NEVER be sent to hell, no matter what :) The ONLY WAY to avoid being sent to hell, is by believing the truth about Jesus. Believe now!     Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation.     The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross and rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what!     Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)|`|d78420f6881261db90170d41d16536a0aa	He's the king of narcissism.

The "Rapture" refers to a passage in First Thessalonians, chapter 4, which talks about Christians being "caught up" in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. Many Christians believe, and the "Left Behind" books promote, that this being "caught up" to meet the Lord will occur before the Great Tribulation which is headed our way in the near future. Christians will simply vanish, meet Jesus somewhere in the air, and then return with Him to Heaven to await the end of time    But notice, in verse 17, Paul says that "...we who are alive, who are left," shall be caught up. Remember that...those who are "left" get caught up to meet the Lord.    The "Left Behind" books get their name from a passage in Luke 17 and a similar passage in Matthew 24 which talk about the coming of the Lord being like the days of Noah and the days of Lot. Matthew 24 puts it this way: "As were the days of Noah, so will be the coming of the Son of man...they ate, they drank, they married and they did not know until the flood came and swept them all away, so will be the coming of the Son of man. Then two men will be in the field, one is taken and one is left. Two women grinding at the mill, one is taken one is left."    "See," Rapture enthusiasts say, "One is taken, one is left...the Rapture! Jesus takes the Christians and leaves behind non-Christians!" Two problems with that interpretation: First, Jesus' coming is being compared to the days of Noah and the days of Lot. After the flood, who was left? Noah and his family...the good guys...the bad guys were taken! After Sodom and Gomorrah went up in smoke, who was left? Lot and his daughters...the good guys...the bad guys were taken! Second, remember 1 Thessalonians? It says that those who are "left" get to meet Jesus in the air. The good guys are left behind to meet Jesus.    In other words, you want to be left behind so that you can get caught up in the clouds to meet Jesus in the air and accompany Him back to earth at His 2nd and final coming. There will be no Rapture like the one the Left Behind books talk about...that view is not scriptural.|`|8DRzJEfpaa	........|.....  ........|..........2 Points..........|||"|""\__  ........|__________________|||_|___|)  ........!(@)'(@)""""**!(@)(@)****!(@)  VROOM!!!!!!!!!|`|lfjTRFzFaa	The thing is that everything you have written or cut and pasted in this question is nonsense.

LsJqpTWsaa	Yes, science changes. But some things are a pretty good guesses. Like the evolution, atoms, and heliocentric theories. We only expanded on and correct these, theories like the big bang, and other pretty new ideas can be proven totally false.|`|JseyoIfLaa	Oh you mean like the science Galileo put out 500 years ago?

Right...    The thing about science, it constantly improves upon itself. There's no point where you stop and say "this is truth" you push, you add variables, you experiment, you test, you add more variables until you figure out how something works.    Even if it gets discredited in the future, even if people die not having finished like Madam Curie, that doesn't mean that they based their lives on something false, it means they worked toward truth and tried to help the world along in their way.|`|1147fde3deacb66e77c8c89ab71de202aa	afterlife still won't exist after 500 years OR if it does it would be BECAUSE of science.|`|AA11156135	I'm waiting for the speed-of-light to be revised.

That's what is so great about it.|`|AA12383652	I dont think there is a problem relying on science, however, there should always be a healthy skepticsm because the fact is that we have barely scratched the surface of scientific knowledge and everything we think we know might turn out to be wrong with more discovery.    Once you get yourself stuck into the idea that any scientific concept is completely infallible then you no longer have a scientific mind because you have closed off the possibility of looking at any other evidence or discovery that just might prove you wrong.      edit  I dont get why people think that we might not have gotten a lot of concepts wrong.  We can only give our best guesses based on the evidence at hand and we dont have all the evidence yet.  We might not disprove a theory for a thousand years and then one little breakthru might blow everything we thought out of the water.    You base the research on the clues you are given but if you close your mind off to any more clues or facts then you and humanity will stop learning and discovering.      We really dont know very much even though we like to think we do.

8cuPVvYnaa	After my divorce, I ended up in a little mobile home. I'm grateful for the home God provided, but I have found there to be some real challenges to mobile home park living. I moved in and was immediately told by one of my neighbors exactly who I was to stay away from, which happened to be both of his neighbors on either side. I ended up getting to know his (and my) neighbors who turned out to be very nice. Well, this made me his enemy. He talked about me to everyone, sent his kids to throw pumpkins at our place,....  But I just continued to say hi and be friendly (never did happen to stop by or invite him for coffee however). I just continued to stay out of the gossip, be friends with whomever I wanted and be friendly to all. Finally, after 3 years he has finally let it go. He even snow blowed my driveway one time. My guess is this person may hate you for awhile if you refuse to take sides, but he isn't likely to kill you (you know better of course), and eventually he will put his fists down if he sees that he's not gonna get a fight out of you.|`|Fo9ADQLBaa	You trust in God!  :D|`|806025c44dd8e27b6c1d544348b087c0aa	In this case a strong defense would be the best peace-keeping measure.|`|YsQQ30YJaa	You don't.

I also have to shake my head in wonder at all these people, especially in America, (Europeans have a much better reality perception) that think any of that religion is benign. Where other religions became enlightened from their dark age periods Islam is yet in the Stone Age mentality (certainly Dark Ages at a minimum).

VHwM54iUaa	I'm not hispanic, but I got curious and looked it up.  This is what I found.    "The anonymous Jesuit missionary who left us A Description of California writes: "From south to north an instrument called the Chaqueco was universal among the Indians. It was used to smoke the wild tobacco which occurs there. These instruments consist of a tube, more or less long, made of pierced stone. (In the vicinity of the Rio Colorado they are made out of clay.) Near the middle of the tube there is an interior division where a pebble is fixed; it is of irregular shape to permit passage of air and smoke. The lower half of the pipe is filled with wild tobacco and it is ignited with a live coal. Although the instrument is the property of a shaman, during certain of their festivals it is common for one of them to be passed from hand to hand so that all in attendance might become intoxicated."  http://www.innerexplorations.com/catsimp...    I love learning stuff like this.  Now the modern version is probably different.  I'm going to do some more digging.    It's used as a surname.

yakmXr5Jaa	REPOST  Ah, thank you for the additional information.  I understand your question better now, so I am completely rewriting my answer.  I presume you are referring to your question yesterday about witnessing miracles.    I am one of the people who decided not to answer it because I don't share those stories with just anyone and everyone.    I believe God gives us the experiences we are ready for, when we are ready for them.  Ether says we only receive witnesses like that after the trial of our faith.  Not everyone is ready for those kinds of witnesses, and when someone is ready, the Lord will provide it for them.  I think telling people about those experiences before they're ready does more harm than good.  It's not my place to decide when they're ready.    The scriptures are full of times when people are commanded not to reveal everything.  This is foreign to our current world where people blog about every intimate detail of their lives.  But here are a few scriptural examples:     -Peter confesses that Jesus is the Christ, and immediately Jesus tells everyone present not to tell anyone about it.  -Peter, James and John go onto the mountain and see Christ transfigured in his glory, where He talks with Moses and Elijah.  Jesus tells them not to tell anyone about it until after His resurrection, and even then they leave the conversation a secret and don't tell us a word about what they said.  -Christ comes back after His resurrection and teaches the disciples for 40 days, but they don't tell us a word about what He taught them.  This secret drove the early Christians crazy and there are all sorts of apocryphal stories about what Jesus taught, but apparently the apostles refused to tell anyone.  -Jesus appears to the Nephites and teaches them several things, but then commands them not to write down some of the things He prays.  -In that same visit He explains to the Nephites that He started to tell the people in Jerusalem about His other sheep, and then felt strongly that He should not reveal it to them, so He didn't say any more about it.    I believe personal, miraculous experiences are intended to be private.  God gives us those experiences when we are ready for them, and we should only share them in personal, private ways with others when moved upon by the spirit.    So I tell others about my testimony, but I am protective of some of the things I've witnessed.  I've been given some incredible experiences, and I only tell others about them if I feel the spirit prompt me.|`|AA11564934	there is no god, so it really only matters how well u can rationalize your urge for self-preservation over telling fairy tales.|`|GtazNrplaa	I heard of LSD but haven't tried LDS yet is it any good.|`|c345a0234bc2cff30d382612a53c4eb9aa	Just like with any of aspect of the gospel, we are told to never argue about it--contention is a tool of the devil. Just bear you personal testimony about your relationship with Christ, and leave it at that. Either they take it or leave it.    If they ridicule you, you know that is their weakness, not yours.|`|TinNG7k7aa	If your religion told you to run outside naked, would you do that too? Or is just being annoying for the sake of some religion acceptable?    The more "bold" (read ANNOYING) you are about your religion, the more others will ignore you. Way to go!|`|97f3e02ea0c61fb5033e4520729f2781aa	I have found the best guide is that of the Spirit.  I will ask for guidance, direction and inspiriation in my gospel conversations with others.  There are times when I've felt prompted to say things which I was not comfortable saying and I've been prompted to remain silent or refrain from making certain statements.  Sometimes it doesn't require one to make a verbal statement - but merely to stand up and be counted.  I also tend to be cautious when sharing personal sacred experiences - it's not required.  When sharing a personal testimony of the gospel it's not necessary to share stories nor experiences.  Often in situations like this - less is more.  If they want to know more, they'll ask [and again, the spirit can guide you on what to say or share in your reply].  There have been some talks in recent conferences on what should be included in testimonies - check those out. For me, something simple such as:  I know that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints contains the fullness of the gospel of Jesus Christ and the authority of the priesthood of God.  I know that Jesus Christ lives and literally stands at the head of the Church.  I know that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God - that Joseph did see God the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ.  I know that Thomas S Monson is a God's prophet on earth today.  I know the Book of Mormon was translated by the gift and power of God.  Sometimes a testimony is only a small piece of your knowledge and faith - sometimes it's in depth.  Sometimes, it's better to be silent and not make the other person accountable for denying the truth as stated by you and testified by the Spirit.  best wishes  EDIT: thanks for clarifying what you were asking.  I don't recall seeing your question from yesterday [just looked it up].  Though I must be honest, I don't think I would have answered with more than a 'yes, I have'.  These miracles and blessings which I have witnessed and participated in are too sacred and close to my heart for me to willingly share in a public forum such as Y!A. As stated above, they are a part of my testimony and experience, and on rare occassions, as the spirit prompts, I have shared them with close family or friends.  If you're looking for a forum where that is possible, try the YARSDucks group.|`|Tcu0NWkUaa	As for myself, I didn't see the question yesterday.  Now that I've gone and reviewed it, I can see why some would be hesitant to respond to it.  In a spiritual setting - which R&S is not - I may be inclined to share some of those spiritual experiences, but I think we need to be careful discussing things of a personally spiritual nature in this forum for the godless to trample under foot so to speak.    I don't understand why you say that "a few members were reluctant to answer . . . ."  I didn't see any posts saying that they didn't want to respond to you because they didn't want to be ridiculed.  I actually thought there were some mighty fine experiences shared.    Thanks for asking, my friend.

I think they wouldn't even feel the least bit canabilistic considering most people think the idea of humans being descended from any primate is just proposteros and that it is more likely that we are a product of God's creation. So one could not feel canabalistic about eating a monkey unless one believe we are descended from gorillas or chimps. It is my educated opinion that we were not created by God, but by some accident of the cosmos and evolved into homosapiens from chimps or gorillas and would feel like I was eating "Uncle Joe." However, if any kind of monkey was native and plentiful around here I'm sure someone somewhere would find them a suitable cuisine and we wouldn't think of it as bothersome.  Big macs have 50 grams of fat. That's ALOT.|`|99xBLoLcaa	It might be difficult to do the first few dozen times, but I suppose I could get used to it.
mU2eMSi3aa	Everyone has to find their own truth and you will if you keep looking.  I was an atheist but I also am fascinated with the religions of the world so I kept looking and found God for myself.  You are right, we shouldn't worship God just to go to heaven.  It is a more pure love if you love God without thought of reward or punishment.  Heaven and hell are man made concepts.

There is plenty of evidence of an intelligent Creator in the world of living things.    For instance, a bird called the Blackpoll Warbler has been tracked flying from Alaska to New England and then out over the Atlantic, catching the Jet Stream back to South America, then flying back all the way to Alaska every year.    If somebody asked US to construct a flying machine that can fly from Alaska to New England to South America and back unaided, could we? But suppose they also asked us to make it weigh less than one ounce. Could we? And no one may build it--it must build itself, because that is what the Blackpoll Warbler does in its egg, doesn't it? Feathers, dual TV cameras, flight computer and all. From a speck in an egg. Would we even try? Could the US government? The entire University system, with an impressive array of bright students, knowledgeable professors and able administrators? All those advanced human brains combined, connected together by the Internet? No? So how much sense does it make to say that blind, unthinking Chance just "accidentally" did so through blind, unthinking evolution?     My young school friend pointed out that since we have about 100 trillion cells in our body and each has about 5 feet of DNA, that makes about 100 trillion times 5 feet, or 100 billion times 5000 feet (about a mile), or 100 billion miles of perfect code that is required to make us a body that works. Since the characters (the "letters") that that code is "printed" in are actually the size of molecules, that makes a lot of "typing" to give us a body. Could we type that much without making a mistake, since any mistake would cause a genetic weakness or birth defect? Could blind chance?     Another thing. Ever tried to swat a fly? Not necessarily easy, right? Know why? It has to do with the fly's navigational system. It has a single vibrating rod in its abdomen, and as it changes direction in flight, it senses the changes in the vibrations of that rod and is able to dodge you, fly and land upside down and backwards. What would the Air Force pay to have flying and navigational systems that good?    How did the fly manage to evolve such a system? Even if it evolved the vibrating rod, what good would it be without the nerves to send the signals from the rod to the brain? And the section of the brain to interpret the signals? And the correct instructions to interpret them? And the correct instructions to the part of the brain that controlled the wings as to what to DO about those signals? All AT THE SAME TIME. Wouldn't that be a remarkable coincidence? I ask people, "Could YOU sit down, right now, and write the code for such a set of instructions? And if your ten billion well trained and coordinated neurons put together can't do it with a computer, is it really reasonable to think that flies did it by themselves?"    The fly has a complete navigational system that is self-constructing (in its egg), self-reproducing, self-programming, self-correcting, that can fly upside down and backwards, avoiding dangers and locating and recognizing fuel (food), that requires even MORE entire, completely developed systems that even large groups of highly educated humans cannot or are only now beginning to be able to copy (and only by intelligent design), all microminiaturized into a space smaller than the head of a pin, with the code for it in characters that are the size of molecules (I wonder how many characters per inch that works out to? Pretty hi-tech data storage).     So I ask people, "In your experience, how many complete flying and navigational systems do you know of that have happened completely by accident, with no intelligent thought or design?" "Did you ever read the story of all the thought and work needed to design and build a flying machine, as told by the Wright brothers themselves? So how scientific is it to say that it just happened by blind accidents in the case of the lowly, incredibly complex fly?"    All of the animal and plant world is full of examples like these. Your body is, too. Johns Hopkins University made the newspapers by making one enzyme. It must have been pretty hard to do. It was no accident. But your liver manufactures over nine hundred enzymes, all necessary for you to live, and no one thinks about putting THAT in the paper, or giving credit for that accomplishment to the One who deserves it. "Could have happened completely by accident" (which is what evolution equates to, isn't it?) But if it could happen so easily, simply by accidents of evolution, then why put the university in the news because it was able to produce ONE?    This isn't defending the horrible things that have been done, like the Inquisition, and unscientific things taught, like a 7,000-year-old earth, by very fallible people supposedly in God's name...

So, you have been misinformed.  NO surprise.    The point of worshiping God is that He created us, designed us and loves us.  And the purpose God has for us is to enjoy a relationship with Him and our fellow human beings forever.  Truthfully, the things that matter to most intelligent people are relationships with other persons.  It follows that the 'thing' that matters most is my relationship with God.     I understand that you do not understand, but if you love anyone maybe you can expand that idea to the possibility that a Person has designed you to relate to Him and other persons.      I would also recommend a philosophical retreat. Atheism is absurd.  Atheism claims that there is absolutely no god... absolutely no absolute..well except for the absolute that there is no absolute.    Also, atheism is the finite human mind declaring that there is no infinite mind.   Retreat!   Become agnostic, it is proclaiming ignorance in an area of ignorance.  At least it is not an absurd philosophical position.|`|jGWJNbq4aa	If you're comfortable with totally dismissing the  existence of a Supreme Being, then there isn't  anything wrong with that.

How can you be an atheist if you don't really understand what God did for us. We have all done wrong things, there is sin all around us. When we do things that are wrong it separates us from God, just like if a really good friend of yours found out you lied to them about something super important, they would most likely not want to be friends with you anymore, but if you were to ask that friend to forgive you and they did, you would be friends again, therefore you aren't separated from that person because they accepted your apology and they forgave you. They wiped the slate clean. That is what happens with us and God. He sent Jesus to die on the cross for us to take our sins for us and so we can be Gods friends again. Its a beautiful relationship, you should try it.|`|LYnuEdKUaa	1. No, there is no proof.  However, there is certain amounts of evidence in some unexplainable phenomenon.  Are the Eucharistic miracles and inncorruptibles and Marian apparitions simply things that science will one day be able to explain, but cannot yet?  Possibly.  But working with what we've got right now, they at least vaguely point in the direction of a creator.    2. The point of worshiping God is to show him the love and thanks that he deserves for creating us.  If a person is worshiping God just to get themselves to heaven, then they are worshiping for selfish and improper reasons and God will see through them in the end.    3.  Yes, worshiping to get yourself to heaven does seem wrong.  That's because, as said above, it is selfish.    4.  I know you're not going to like this answer, but as to why God doesn't appear anymore - we cannot know.  Jesus doesn't show up because the next time he does is the end of the world, but that doesn't mean God can't appear in other forms.  So why not?  Don't know.  I'm not God and me trying to understand his reasons for things is like an ant trying to understand mine.

Worshiping God - there are many reasons. People need hope, and sometimes the only place they can get it is in God. People need something to believe in.

It goes both ways.|`|Y6YGHsKjaa	We learned about this in my religion class. Yes, there is proof in nature. Can you honestly believe that the universe just "happened?" By accident or cells and atoms coming together at precisely the right moment? There would have to be some kind of upper hand doing this. And how does the universe stay together? Shouldn't it just blow up? NO, because we have something that isn't anywhere else; atmosphere. We have oxygen to breath, and the sun comes up every day and every night.     As for worshiping God, God sent his son to us to save us. What did he save us from? Hell. Hell is so terrible that we should be so thankful to God for giving us the best gift ever: eternity in bliss; heaven. That's why we worship. It's not the worshiping part that gets us to heaven. It's the faith in Jesus Christ that he saved us.     I hope that helps you understand God a little better.|`|td56KmCBaa	Whether or not God exists is a very open sort of question. It depends on how different people interpret different things. A practicing Christian would say yes, just look around you. Look at what God created and look at what He has done.  They would say that He answers prayer and could give you specific instances where this could be true. But someone who does not believe in the Christian God could say that no, there is no proof. Some people are polytheistic and would say that there is no way one being alone could do that all alone. There are so many different answers, it's a difficult question to answer conclusively.  As far as the point of worshipping God goes, there is more to it than just getting to heaven. From a Christian point of view, God created humans, along with everything else, in His image. They believe that He lloves us and that He desires the best for us. They call Him their Heavenly Father because He is the Father of us all. Worshipping God gives purpose to life for them. Just like we all search for purpose in life, they find that in God. We all want life to mean something, right? So for Christians, God gives life meaning.  They believe that He sent His Son to die to save us, because blood is the only things sufficient for covering sins. Because Jesus the Christ knew no sin Himself, He rose from the dead and it is in that, in all the promises of God given in the Christian Bible, that Christians find hope.  Why has He only made one appearance? That's not completely correct. Jesus the Christ, according to the Bible, was completely God, and completely Man. So, physically, in a form we recognize as human, he was only on earth once. But, in the Old Testament, God appeared more than once, in different forms. He appeared in fleshly form to Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden until they committed the first sin and fell from grace. He appeared to Moses in a burning bush, and while the Israelites were fleeing captivity in Egypt, going to the Promised Land, He was with them always. Appearing as a cloud in the day, and a pillar of fire during the night. Moses went up on a mountain to recieve the Ten Commandments and God appeared to him there as a still, small voice. Moses, more than any other mortal in the Christian Bible, 'saw' God. However, because they believe God is perfect and holy, they could not directly look upon Him until he was in human form. They believe He is coming again, in what is called the Second Coming. When the tribulation is over, He will come to Earth once more to establish a kingdom and reign for 1000 years, before the end of the world. Plus, Christians believe in direct communication with God and the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, so He is always with them, if not physically.  I hope that answers your question!|`|A8YHVytYaa	Look around, do you really believe that all this came by chance?  I mean, if it takes a scientist to create a ship to go to the moon and  mechanic to build a car, then someone had to have created us.  Think about it, if these non living objects are created by man, then logic dictate that we who are much more complex than machines have had to been created by someone ie:God.    Let me ask you, do you want your friends and family to love you, would you appreciate it if they did things for you?  Well, God is the same.  He does not demand we worship him, (if anyone tell you different they are lying) he wants our appreciation for what he has given us and we do that by listening to his counsel and trying our best to live by them.    And for your additional question.  Many make the mistake and say Jesus is God.  They are two different individuals.  Jesus did his part while he was here. Its our choice to live like he did (minus the miracle's).     What do you think?

For the previous 40 years, Moses had been a shepherd in Midian, so why should Pharaoh listen to a shepherd? Because Moses came in the name of the only true God, Jehovah. To prove this, Jehovah empowered him to perform miracles. So impressive were these that even the Egyptian priests were forced to admit: It is the finger of God! (Exodus 8:19) Jehovah brought ten plagues on Egypt, the final one of which forced Pharaoh to let Gods people leave Egypt. When Pharaoh stubbornly pursued them with his army, the Israelites escaped when a way was miraculously opened up through the Red Sea. The Egyptian army followed them and drowned in the sea.Isaiah 63:11-14; Haggai 2:4,?5.    Yes, Jehovah through his spirit worked powerful miracles in behalf of the Israelites in Moses time, and at other times too. What was the intent of those miracles? They furthered Jehovahs purposes, caused his name to be known, and demonstrated his power. And sometimes, as with Moses, they proved conclusively that an individual had Jehovahs backing. (Exodus 4:1-9; 9:14-16) However, miracles wrought by holy spirit have been rare throughout history. Likely, most individuals living in Bible times never witnessed one, and today they no longer occur. Nevertheless, as we today wrestle with problems that may seem insurmountable, is it not a comfort to know that if we ask Jehovah in faith, he will give us the same spirit that supported Moses before Pharaoh and opened a way for the Israelites through the Red Sea?Matthew 17:20.      Regarding Gods name    From the point of view of the Bible, there has never been any question as to the name of the true God. When God spoke to Moses, explaining that He would use him to lead the nation of Israel out of Egyptian bondage, Moses asked a logical question: When I come to the Israelites and say to them The God of your fathers has sent me to you, and they ask me, What is His name? what shall I say to them? God answered: Thus shall you speak to the Israelites: The LORD [Hebrew, ,??? toor werbeH cisab eht morf semoc tI .egaugnal werbeH eht skaeps ohw eno rof gninaem fo lluf si eman sihT 5    .sruo scilati ,51?,31:3 sudoxE.ytinrete lla rof ]PJ ,lairomem[ noitalleppa yM siht ,reverof eman yM eb llahs sihT :uoy ot em tnes sah ,bocaJ fo doG eht dna ,caasI fo doG eht ,maharbA fo doG eht ,srehtaf ruoy fo doG eht ,]havoheJ ,.E.C?yrutnec ht31 eht ecnis ,ro ,hewhaY = HWHY = ???? hwh, meaning to become. However, the name is in the causative form, Hiph?il, according to Hebrew grammar. Therefore its basic sense is not relating to Gods eternal existence but rather to his causing things to come to be or to come about. This is especially true in a unique way regarding his purposes. As he purposed to free his chosen nation from Egyptian bondage, so he caused it to be. No power could stand in the way of his express will. Jehovah is the God who causes his purposes to be fulfilled. He thus causes himself to become the Fulfiller of his promises. This was also true of his purpose to free his nation from Babylonian captivity. The same is true regarding his purpose to bring paradisaic conditions to this earth. His very name gives meaning and a guarantee to these promises.Isaiah 41:21-24; 43:10-13; 46:9,?10.
um9W8Dy8aa	Yes, his missions are many of the towns and cities of California
dkSh82Nuaa	If you're referring to his elevation to sainthood the answer should be no.    He was a fanatical sadist whose practice of self-mortification ( whipping and cutting himself ) extended itself to his treatment of the native Indian population in Alta ( Northern ) California.    He led a mission system that reduced the Indians to the level of children and did not prepare them in any way to take charge of their own destinies.  His missions were run in such a way as to prevent their secularization ( going from missionary control to that of ordinary priests ) as none of the Indian members were adequately trained to take on the responsibilities of running their own affairs under the Spanish system.  In addition the missions were ultimately a failure with few participants and were ultimately destroyed following the Mexican revolution of 1824 with little protest from the Indians or native Californians.

l3f8kf7xaa	It is a long story. Jehovah is basically an English corruption of Yahweh.     I Am Who Am--> Hebrew: YHWH--> in Latin, the letters J=Y, V=W (they make the same sound) --> English took that set of letters and used their own pronunciation for it.     Like people saying tor-TILL-uh instead of tor-TEE-yuh.|`|9Dq2176oaa	In the same vein the New Catholic Encyclopedia says: JEHOVAH, false form of the divine name Yahweh. The name Jehovah first appeared in manuscripts in the 13th century A.D., but had probably been in use for some time. (Vol. 7, p. 863) Likewise the Revised Standard Version translators objected to the form Jehovah, stating that the word Jehovah does not accurately represent any form of the Name ever used in Hebrew, and that it is almost if not quite certain that the Name was originally pronounced Yahweh. (P. vi.) Also, the modern Roman Catholic version known as The Jerusalem Bible uses the form Yahweh, even as does Rotherhams Emphasised Bible.    In view of these opinions, why do the witnesses of Jehovah prefer to use Jehovah rather than Yahweh? For one thing, no one can be certain just what the original pronunciation was, even as admitted by those who prefer Yahweh. And further, the form Jehovah has a currency and familiarity that Yahweh does not have. Yahweh is obviously a transliteration, whereas Jehovah is a translation, and Bible names generally have been translated rather than transliterated. A transliteration usually sounds strange to the ears of those speaking the tongue into which the proper name has been transliterated.    That there are valid reasons for using the form Jehovah can be seen from the fact that, while in both the Protestant Revised Standard Version and the Roman Catholic New American Bible the name Jehovah does not appear, the translators of the New English Bible have not shrunk back altogether from using it. Thus their translation at Exodus 3:15, 16 and 6:3 reads:    You must tell the Israelites this, that it is JEHOVAH the God of their forefathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob, who has sent you to them. .?.?. Go and assemble the elders of Israel and tell them that JEHOVAH the God of their forefathers, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, has appeared to you. I appeared to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob as God Almighty. But I did not let myself be known to them by my name JEHOVAH. Interestingly, the translators in a footnote make the following observation: The Hebrew consonants are YHWH, probably pronounced Yahweh, but traditionally read Jehovah.    Even more to the point is what the noted English Bible scholar J. B. Rotherham has to say on this subject. Especially is this of interest in view of the fact that he might be said to have been one of the pioneers in using the form Yahweh in transliterating the Tetragrammaton. His Emphasised Bible was published in 1897, whereas his Studies in the Psalms were not published until 1911, after he had died. In this latter work Rotherham returned to the use of Jehovah, which is all the more remarkable in view of how strongly he objected to the form Jehovah in the introduction to his Emphasised Bible. In explanation of his reasons for returning to the form Jehovah, he says in the introduction to his Studies:    JehovahThe employment of this English form of the Memorial name [Exo. 3:18] in the present version of the Psalter does not arise from any misgiving as to the more correct pronunciation, as being Yahweh; but solely from practical evidence personally selected of the desirability of keeping in touch with the public ear and eye in a matter of this kind, in which the principal thing is the easy recognition of the Divine name intended. .?.?. As the chief evidence of the significance of the name consists not nearly so much in its pronunciation as in the completeness with which it meets all requirementsespecially as explaining how the Memorial name was fitted to become such, and to be the preeminent covenant name that it confessedly is, it has been thought desirable to fall back on the form of the name more familiar (while perfectly acceptable) to the general Bible-reading public.    Rotherham realized that what was important was not the more accurate pronunciation but the easy recognition of the Divine name intended, thereby keeping better in touch with the general Bible-reading public by means of a name that is perfectly acceptable and meets all requirements of its uniqueness. In a similar vein S. T. Byington in his Preface to The Bible in Living English notes that the spelling and the pronunciation are not highly important. What is highly important is to keep it clear that this is a personal name. There are several texts that cannot be properly understood if we translate this name by a common noun like Lord.    Those who object to the use of Jehovah might be said to strain out the gnat but gulp down the camel! (Matt. 23:24) How so? In that they make much of the correct pronunciation of Gods name, and yet they seldom if ever use it but prefer to call him God or Lord, which are mere titles, there being many called lords and gods.1?Cor. 8:5, 6.    How greatly the Author of the Bible set store by his unique name is apparent from the fact that his Word us|`|Cs6aBBrJaa	For each language there is a different pronounciation. Jesus' name is Yeshua, but people say Jesus because it is easily understood in their language. It is important to call God by the right name. Matthew 6:9 "Hallowed be thy name"  Romans 10:13 - "All those calling on the name of Jehovah will be saved". In other countries, they may pronouce God's name differently. In America, it has been pronounce "Jehovah" for hundreds of years. According to the New Catholic Encyclopedia says: The name Jehovah first appeared in manuscripts in the 13th century A.D., but had probably been in use for some time."|`|r3xWSswtaa	Jehovah is Yahweh translated in english.|`|47181414a475aa26d8316adbb0d510d1aa	Who invented the names    Jesus, Jeremiah, Joshua, Elijah, Jehu?    Remember there is no "J" in Hebrew.    Why are people in English called, Tom, and not by the Spanish name of Tomas?    Why does my Spanish bible say Marco for Mark, Pedro for Peter?    Why is Jesus pronounced "Haysoos" in spanish and not Geesus?    Jehovah's Witnesses have no problem using Yahweh for God,    You would be surprise how many people "Don't know that the name Jehovah is in their KJV bible."    Back when the Watchtower started to be printed, 99% of the english population used only the KJV, including the WT Society.    Thus if you said Yahweh, 99% of the people would have said, "Who?"    .|`|027f718c10034b9410bd7f94684f6da6aa	In the King James version of the Bible, God's name is translated simply as LORD (in uppercase letters). In the original Hebrew language, the name is actually spelled YHWH. The Hebrew language does not contain vowels and because the Jews stopped pronouncing God's name, for fear of taking it in vain, no one today knows exactly how to pronounce it.    Instead of pronouncing God's name, the Jews would simply say Adonai, which is a Hebrew word meaning Lord. Later in time, as scribes copied scripture, they began to insert the vowels from Adonai into the name YHWH. This was to help them to remember to say Adonai and not necessarily meant to be pronounced. The name became to be spelled Yahowah (or Yehowah). When this spelling was transliterated into the English language it became Iehovah and then after the invention of the letter J it became to be pronounced as we know it today, Jehovah.    Eventually, scholars realized this pronunciation mistake and by studying other Hebrew words and names have suggested that Yahweh is probably a more accurate way to pronounce YHWH. The Bible gives us a shortened form of God's name in Psalm 68:5 as Yah (Jah in English). This name also appears in the names of people such as Eliyahu (Elijah) and Yeshayah (Isaiah) and also in the word Halleluyah.    While Jehovah is a less correct way to pronounce God's name, it's not necessarily bad to use it as an English pronunciation. Whether we say Yahweh or Jehovah, people still understand that we are speaking of the Old Testament God of the Hebrews.    Moreover, in these last days, God has revealed to us His ultimate saving name. Zechariah 14:9 says, "And the LORD shall be king over all the earth: in that day shall there be one LORD, and his name one." This one name is Jesus (Iesous in the Greek). Jesus means Yahweh is my Salvation.    "Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name: That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father." (Philippians 2:9-11)|`|BpNrx9Viaa	Yehowah is his Hebrew name?|`|2BBKHggeaa	The name Jehovah has been around for a long time.  It is well known as the name of the Creator of the Universe, the God of the Hebrews, the Most Hight over all the earth.  Jehovah's Witnesses use it because that is the most acceptable form or well known form of the name of God.    Yahweh is still Gods name but it is not as well known.

They used to say, NO, even tho they knew deep down that it made more sense...    these are called: disbelievers...they refuse to believe even tho they know it made more sense...    then there are those who lack belief completely because they think everything needs to have a physical proof, i.e. they need to see if with their own eyes and ears and stuff...these are more like the current day atheists who believe everything is literally either there or isnt.     from a different point of view, their complete disregard for the possibility of the existence of things beyond our 5 senses, and utter inability to prove there is no God, we may say they actually believe there is no god...but this reasoning is more around the lines of 'not being able  to see' or feel god, and hence is not all stemming from belief...|`|SOza8NBqaa	great question.  atheism is a belief that there is no God.  In order for there to be a disbelief there has to be a belief.  In order for someone to deny something it assumes that there must be an affirmation of something.

The question is, what is the object of what one believes.

AA11104965	One I agree with:    (Matthew 7:1-2) "Do not judge, or you too will be judged. For in the same way you judge others, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you."    Because it clearly opposes hypocrisy, not judgment (as is so often claimed).  And it continues ...    (Matthew 7:3-5) "Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother's eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye? How can you say to your brother, 'Let me take the speck out of your eye,' when all the time there is a plank in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye."    So, as you can see, it explicitly encourages judgment after the impediment of hypocrisy has been overcome.    Since there is no way to end ignorance, stupidity, and evil without passing judgment on them, a world without judgment is necessarily an eternal hell.  Judgment is the very foundation of civilization and the only hope humanity can have for any eventual peace on Earth.  As such, it is fortunate that the Bible does not really oppose it.    ...    Also, one I like:    (2 Kings 2:23-24) "From there Elisha went up to Bethel. While he was on the way, some small boys came out of the city and jeered at him. 'Go up, baldhead,' they shouted, 'go up, baldhead!' The prophet turned and saw them, and he cursed them in the name of the Lord. Then two she-bears came out of the woods and tore forty-two of the children to pieces."    Because it proves beyond any doubt that the God of the Bible is not the all-loving benefactor that Christians so often claim.  He is often flagrantly immoral.  So even if everything in the Bible is literally the 'Word of God,' it still cannot be trusted.  Skepticism and rational consideration of its ideas are always required.|`|f10424ac1ac7b1791b4f665094823d61aa	A merry heart doeth good like a medicine: but a broken spirit drieth the bones.

AA11440601	You misunderstand what the crusades were all about.    Muslim armies had conquered much of northern Africa, Egypt, Palestine, Syria, and Spain, which had been some of the most heavily Christian areas in the world.     Thousands, and possibly millions, of Christians died during this drive to eventually bring the entire world under Islam.    The First Crusade was launched in 1095 by Pope Urban II to check the advance of the Muslims and regain control of the city of Jerusalem and the Holy Land.    If this defensive war was not fought then we would probably all be Muslim today.    I am sure that some atrocities were committed by individuals of both sides during this war but by most people's judgment this was a just war.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Crusa...

G4a8Yfjeaa	Well, the christians who do that, through my opinion, are not real christians. Christians are supposed to love everyone and except them all for who they are. the word "hate" should never come out of the mouth of a christian, so if they say they hate muslims, they aren't really christian. I think what they are trying to do is promote Christ (and the attempt backfired because they were doing it the wrong way). We're christians, our job is basically to obey the ten commandments and spread the word of jesus christ to everyone.

XmJZkFuMaa	I know some folks who would argue that the whole mess in Waco that happened a while back would count.  And that group in the 70's who went down to South America and set up a compound and then killed themselves were convinced the government was going to come and kill them all.      But other than the extermination order, no.  And thank heavens Missouri had the sense to finally take it off the books in the 70's and apologize for Boggs.  Though how they were able to keep it on the books until 1976 just boggles my mind.    Add:  I looked under the link Pogrom at the wiki, and it gave a list of people who have either been driven or exterminated in more recent times.  Some of them are Christians (such as the last paragraph saying "Although Iraqi Christians represent less than 5% of the total Iraqi population, they make up 40% of the Iraqi refugees now living in nearby countries, according to UNHCR.[70][71] Massacres, ethnic cleansing, and harassment has increased since the U.S.-led invasion in 2003.[72] Furthermore, the Mandaean and Yazidi communities are at the risk of elimination due to the ongoing atrocities by Is")  You might find more there.|`|8Ak1FehYaa	teh mormons had the Hn's mill massacre and the mormons countered with the mountains meadows massacre in UT.

b2dUtX0raa	I'm not sure why you added evolution to your question because it really has no bearing on the matter.    Anyway, atheists don't have a belief system because it's not a religion.  Atheists have their own moral compass; one that isn't dictated by a church.  That doesn't mean that they are murders and rapists.  I have excellent morals and certainly better than some christians I've seen.  We're human beings and we know right from wrong and we don't need a book to tell us how to behave.  If the ten commandments told you to rape and murder, would you do it?  No, because it's wrong.  Why would you think that something like that would be a good idea to an atheist?    More wars have been fought because of religion than anything else; to say that your belief system is better is ridiculous.  The ten commandments are guidelines for living.  Don't steal?  Pretty sure I could have thought of that on my own.  Don't murder?  Yeah, I've got that one covered because murder is wrong!  And hey, guess what?  I figured that out all on my own!    Do you think that christians have never killed anyone?  Never raped anyone?  Never abused anyone?  Even the most devout christians can be assholes.  Look at priests molesting small children; can you honestly say that that's a good thing?    I will never understand why people assume that we're baby murdering thieves who shoot puppies for fun.|`|YZv8Ub3Haa	Evolution is fact; it's got nothing to do with morality.

Why is it that Christians (did you notice that I remembered the "s" at the end of Christian?) have a complete inability to use the "s" in plural words? Surely you aren't that badly educated that you can't even use the English language.    Atheism is NOT a "belief". Its a "lack of belief in any deity". Stop trying to turn it into more than it is.    No, Atheism leads to equality and justice for all.    If people lived by the bible, they'd still sell their daughters into slavery. Going by the bible isn't exactly a great moral source. Especially since the Christian god murdered a whole crap load of first born children in it. THAT isn't justice, its the Christian god being an arrogant ********.

Well, if that's what you think, then you are wrong.    Throughout our evolutionary cycle, we have been social creatures, and live essentially in a cooperative. Those who do not conform to certain basic social dictates risk being ostracized and suffer various related consequences, like lack of success and ability to provide for oneself and or one's family.  This has been proven through studies with other primates who, although they have no religion, have social values and expectations of conduct to continue to be included in the group.  In short, bad monkeys get thrown out.      So on varying levels, we have to comply with a basic set of rules regardless of whether they came chiseled onto stone tablets or the lead monkey threw rotten fruit at the back of our head for bad behavior, like taking another's food, or not reciprocating grooming.  Assuming morality is a religious construct assumes that if you are not religious you are automatically amoral. It's just not true. It was important to comply with society's rules before we were even capable of wondering if there was a god.|`|dykhWhMxaa	I hate the theories of Atheist and Evolution.

Religion is not the product of reason, but viewed from within, it is altogether reasonable. Religion is not derived from the logic of human philosophy, but as a mortal experience it is altogether logical. Religion is the experiencing of divinity in the consciousness of a moral being of evolutionary origin; it represents true experience with eternal realities in time, the realization of spiritual satisfactions while yet in the flesh.|`|dFBccLExaa	I don't get why everyone kills everyone for their religion.

Because I prayed and the Christian God answered my prayer... whereas Allah and Buddha left me waiting.

People never made themselves clear when they bashed heavy metal. Is it the loud music thats evil or the lyrics?

An oxymoron would be something like gosbel porn.|`|O3WYA3WGaa	Nothing inherently wrong with rap. It's usually what's rapped about that's wrong.    I think it's great that there's so many different kinds of Christian music out there.  I was listening to a Christian screamo song the other day.    I think it helps attract different kinds of people. If we have a good variety of Christian music we like, we are less likely to turn to secular music.    It would get boring pretty quick if everyone sounded like Jeremy Camp, Third Day, etc. Not saying I don't like them, but a lot of worship music kinda sounds all the same. Not really unique except for the lyrics. A person can only handle so many minutes of repeating the same chorus over and over again.|`|ATPPWOpWaa	The New Age Contemporary Church and its Contemporary Christian Music(CCM) should be looked upon with a raised brow and be scrutinized to see if it holds up to Jesus Christs words and admonishions both in practice and principle.  One can fairly paint the entire spectrum of this New Age Movement as somewhat void of the Gospel of Jesus Christ and what He has done.  Yes, there are are exceptions but one should not hang their hat on exceptions while being bedfellows with worldly views, music and lusts which permeate much of CCM either directly or by association.      At it's core the content of New Age Christianity and CCM is this;    * Less Jesus Christ  * Less Gospel  * Less Christian doctrine  * Less scripture    CCM is often written by unchurched, unscholared and Biblically ignorant  'artists' that may not even be Christian at all.    But real Christian music is written mostly by churched, religiously trained Christians bent on doctrinally accurate lyrics usually containing actual scripture.  CCM is about us and our response to god but real Christian music is about what Jesus Christ has done for us.  CCM is about me, myself and I while true Gospel music is about Jesus, the Father and His Word.  Many CCM artists are actually secularists with a few radicals which have  hidden satanic references, pictographs or rituals on their album covers or in their music.  Here are some quotes from CCM artist Amy Grant.      "Im a singer, not a preacher. IM NOT LOOKING TO CONVERT ANYBODY. I feel people come to hear my music, not to hear me talk" (Amy Grant, St. Petersburg Times, Florida, April 7, 1984, p. 4).    "I dont feel like its my mission in life to preach to people. I feel like its just my gift to communicate life as I see it" (Amy Grant, Family Weekly, August 11, 1985).    "If an audience feels Ive walked away from God because I no longer talk about Him onstage, then thats their loss" (Amy Grant, Ibid.).    And finally, the secular world doesn't have a problem with the Contemporary Christian Church or its music.  CCM is a movement.  A movement away from the divisiveness and bitterness of the name Jesus and His Gospel.   CCM is a movement towards self improvent and fulfillment and self expression.  To do what feels and seems good in concert with the betterment of our everyday life.  A movement towards inclusiveness and understanding which is what pop culture teaches us and not recognition and understanding of the creator and the agonies of His Son Jesus Christ.|`|iHDYncuXaa	Toby Mac has a great Christian rap song called "Lose my Soul".

Is every creature a separate entity or a part of one interconnected whole? I love science, but I do not base my life on logic alone, I have intuitions and other aspects of knowing.    Its funny because, I went through an atheist stage, actually I was atheist/agnostic my whole life, until I had a mystical experience. I do not reject science, I just believe there are aspects to reality that the human mind just cannot comprehend it its everyday waking state.

angPpFY7aa	Abortion is the gut-bustingly hilarious procedure in which a soon-to-be ugly baby is instead destroyed before it has a chance to wreak havoc on the world.    Contrary to popular belief, abortion is actually a life saving procedure. The rate of aborted babies that went on to commit murder is 0%, a percentage significantly lower than the rate of unaborted babies.    Someone who is pro-life is someone who is against abortion in any and all cases. They believe that a zygote has all the rights of a grown adult human, unless of course that adult is a pregnant woman, who has no right to decide what happens in her body.    Ironically, people who are pro-life are in favor of the death penalty and killing people in Iraq.|`|8d89b255ad0cc448257f013c1fb8f3a8aa	I don't believe in it. I also don't support the death penalty.

Since they don't have personhood, by law, abortion is not murder. Just a medical procedure.  3. It is not infanticide, since infanticide only applies to babies who are born.  4. How about giving better medical care to mothers or better sex education so that we can possibly have less abortions? How about that?    "Conservatives don't give a **** about you until you reach 'military age'. Then they think you are just fine. Just what they've been looking for. Conservatives want live babies so they can raise them to be dead soldiers. Pro-life... pro-life... These people aren't pro-life, they're killing doctors! What kind of pro-life is that? What, they'll do anything they can to save a fetus but if it grows up to be a doctor they just might have to kill it?    Pro-life... You don't see many of these white anti-abortion women volunteering to have any black fetuses transplanted into their uterus, do you? No, you don't see them adopting a whole lot of crack babies, do you? No, that might be something Christ would do."|`|Z0Vds9oCaa	I hate hate HATE abortion. I believe a fetus is a life.    BUT, that is my view. Not everyone thinks a fetus is as important. So do I have the right to put my morals into law? No way.    I think eating meat is wrong. I think an animal's life is just about as important. I think humans are arrogant to think they are the only ones that matter. That is a moral value of mine.    Does everyone agree? NO. So do I put my idea's into law? NO.    I will NEVER get an abortion or encourage anyone to get one. But is anyone forcing me to do it? No. So I won't.     Sometimes though, abortion is necessary. Is it a good moral choice? No. But sometimes its the only choice. A fourteen year old girl doesn't need to walk around pregnant. Pregnancy changes a woman  physically and emotionally.     People who get abortions aren't just doing it and dismissing it easily. Its a hard decision.    EDIT: Oh and I have to rant for a second about sex ed. Abstinence only education doesn't work because teens will have sex no matter what so we should teach them to be safe.    Safe sex=no accidental pregnancies=NO NEED FOR ABORTION    Plain and simple.|`|6296beaabcf8f4682bfa047d500f8e9aaa	Abortion should be allowed up until a socially agreed upon point, or after if the mother's life is in danger.    However, the baby should not be killed or harmed in any way, it should be given all the medical treatment possible to see if it can survive.  This way we are not killing anything and only not saving babies who are not yet medically viable, as medical science improves more babies can be saved.    This would stop us torturing mothers (which carrying an unwanted baby to term is) and also stop us killing viable humans.  Many children have been born and survived while at an age that the law currently permits an abortion to be carried out.  However, to say that a ball of cells with no nervous system deserves rights is ludicrous in any system of thought that doesn't include religion, thus the morning after pill is perfectly valid and reasonable.|`|M4WIWMgBaa	Removing a clump of unfeeling cells from my uterus is my business.

I have no right to tell someone what their best option is.     -  I do not think a fetus that is not even aware it is alive cares if it dies. I don't think it's wrong to kill something with no emotions    -  I personally know women who have had "back alley" abortions that ended in catastrophe.     For these reasons I believe women should have access to safe, legal methods of abortion.|`|FOZGMadaaa	There are many fetuses and men and women as well that died in this lifetime of man.

I don't see it as "Killing babies" as many have put it. There are billions in out world, and we are simply not producing enough food for everyone. Nor is there money are homes for all. A new life in America, a dead child the starved to death across the world. I would much rather have 100 happy and healthy people then 1,000 dying and sick people.    And from a moral view point, I do believe it's a woman's body. Unless the fetus can survive outside the womb, it needs the mother to live. If the mother doesn't want to give life to the child, she shouldn't have. In reality, it's no different than not donating to charity.|`|AA11692259	well... i believe in abortion when its conceived in anger or without consent or in cases of incest.  a woman that is raped by her uncle,father , or some animal that pushes her down and forces himself on her, shouldnt have to live with the complete hell of having that child. that would be just downright wrong!  i also dont believe a 12-13-14 year old should be having a child.   i know you cant always stop a child from doing what they will do. but when they are that young... its a complete dis-service to society and the child that comes from it will more than likely hurt the world more than help it    other than that i dont believe in abortion  but we have to use common sense... to say all abortion is wrong is just that .. lacking common sense. to use it as birth control because you dont have common sense isnt an excuse to have an abortion.    but then again.... maybe the parents of these children having the abortions/children should be scrutinized as well...    edit:... of course... im a man....and since i am... i have no right to say|`|TkUL4OINaa	I don't think this to be related to religion issues, but more of others.    Whether you are Christians or Atheists, without preparation of having to form a Family, don't let woman suffer this kind of matter. Instead, have a plan and have a family before preparing to have a baby.     But, i'm against Abortions in all aspects. It hurts the women and the society.|`|1a10b4584a07d2861c8d2a8b0698898aaa	If you are religious, you're probably against it - most are.  Especially if you're someone who 'believes in the bible' given all it's verses against that sort of thing.  If you don't have any belief, it can go either way - but you don't have a religious reason to be against it.    I personally am against abortion for the most part.  but I do understand the agony that can come with some situations, esp rape and incest.  I'm more in favor of working to get people from sleeping around - that would prevent pregnancies and stop the huge "need" for abortions.    Gruz - you apparently don't know much about pro-life individuals.  Because most of us that I know (and I'm involved a lot) are against the death penalty.  We are also against any killing unless totally necessary - which would include most of the deaths in Iraq.  Don't make assumptions and state them as TRUTH about ALL of us.  It's either a lie or very poor judgement.    thedonutkid - I understand your view, but if you realize that someone sees those cells as a child, someone that god "knew before you were formed in the womb" then you would understand why they would not want casual abortions.    Lady Lazarus - i agree, because no one really TALKS about it.  They just usually shout their views while insulting the others, not bothering to think about it.  It was in a philosophy class in college where I came to believe in my view.  The discussions and a professor who would attack your view no matter what side you took, forcing you to really consider what you believed.    carly - feel sorry so many people felt they had to thumbs down you just for your view.  It isn't like you were insulting like some of the others.    If they are just cells, then why can you get charged with 2 counts of murder if you cause the death of the mother and the baby?    Wonder woman - We are called to do God's will?  you think God wants us to just sit back and do nothing while (In our view) so many babies are killed?  We're talking about more people then ahve been killed in every major war for a long time...    nacho - I agree, but you have to realize that 99% of those who do don't see the baby as a baby.  If they did, they wouldn't have an abortion.  That is the problem - if you see it, you wouldn't do it.    Cassie T - carbon is the potential for life?  that's a false arguement.  And you're comparing non-sentient things to sentient things.  You also haven't seen some of the movies of fetus' reacting to stimuli in the womb.  They can and do react.    One True Ceiling Cat - the problem with masturbation is that it isn't a fertilized cell?  a fetus, if left alone would eventually become a baby (most of the time).  Sperm left alone wouldn't.  And no, a woman dying due to the pregnancy would be bad.  But there is a Catholic saint who was made one due to her choosing the baby's life over her own.  (Forget name, she was a doctor who had cancer when pregnant.  if she had treatment, baby would die.  she waited until she gave birth, but was too late)    Ignatius J. Reilly - While I agree, the problem is that people don't agree or see it your way. Therefore there needs to be discussion.  We have to get people to see it taht way, and they won't with such straight THIS IS IT statements.      Michael K - while I disagree with some of what you say, I do agree with your idea of lots better education to stop so many pregnancies that are not planned.  If everyone would stop screwing around casually, AIDS (and other STDs) would go away and we'd have a LOT less unwanted babies.  But everyone likes screwing around, spreading diseases and stuff more than keeping their legs crossed until marriage.    heatre24 - I think he was joking ,but you never know.|`|isll2Uqnaa	abortion is with no doubt murder. i dont understand how it is considered murder if you kill you child even 1 second after his or her birth, yet if you kill it when youre pregnant, its your 'right.' it makes no sense. abortion is not giving the woman control over her body, it is giving her control over the child's life. if a woman hasthe right to decide wether the child lives or not, why is that right taken away after the child is born? even if the child was concieved by rape, it's still a child. i know if i was concieved by rape, i would still want a chance at life.|`|cf5961a316debfb7203fffd630bd740caa	how dare you try to compare the murder of millions of PEOPLE to removing a FETUS from the womb! how dare you! i'm sure holocaust survivors would take issue with your bullshit.     i don't care if this is a joke or not.....you're an idiot.|`|COFPXYvZaa	christians want to turn america into a theocracy that'll impose coercion on the lives of "pagans". christians: if you don't like abortion, fine. ignore it. distance yourself from the planned parenthood clinics. nobody asked you to get involved with abortion. live your OWN life according to YOUR own morals. but DON'T meddle in the lives of other people who don't share your religion or morals.

Can you imagine trying to feed all of the aborted babies if they had been born??  And what about women who have been raped and never wanted a child? There are 14 and 15 year old girls who have been raped and become pregnant... you're suggesting that they should be forced to carry their rapists child? That's just horrible.    A fetus doesn't have any thought yet... no memory... nothing. It is a parasite on a host, the host being the mother. It does not benefit society in any way.    Pro-choice.
AA10746826	The passage you are referring to is:    And Judah said unto Onan: 'Go in unto thy brother's wife, and perform the duty of a husband's brother unto her, and raise up seed to thy brother.' And Onan knew that the seed would not be his; and it came to pass when he went in unto his brother's wife, that he spilled it on the ground, lest he should give seed to his brother. And the thing which he did was evil in the sight of the LORD; and He slew him also.     At this time of the bible when a women is widowed, the brother is required to give the woman a child. Onan did not want to give her a child. Instead of being honest about this, he was treacherous and used withdrawal as a method of birth control. He was slain because he refused to impregnate his brother's widow. That is why he is seen as evil.|`|9Dq2176oaa	(Genesis 38:8-10) In view of that Judah said to Onan: Have relations with your brothers wife and perform brother-in-law marriage with her and raise up offspring for your brother. 9?But Onan knew that the offspring would not become his; and it occurred that when he did have relations with his brothers wife he wasted his semen on the earth so as not to give offspring to his brother. 10?Now what he did was bad in the eyes of Jehovah; hence he put him also to death.      There are those that have said that the Bible describes masturbation in Genesis chapter?38, and that Onan was put to death for the offense. But this is not true. The Bible says that when Onan did have relations with his brothers wife he wasted his semen on the earth. (Genesis 38:9) So apparently Onan interrupted sexual relations with Tamar, spilling his semen on the ground rather than giving it to Tamar. He did this because he did not want to raise up children in the name of his dead brother. And it was for this failure to perform brother-in-law marriage that Onan was put to death.|`|AA11138696	The seed spoken of is the seed of Man as in sperm.  This is an oft misunderstood passage.  God did not slay Onan for the simple act of spilling his seed.  Onan did this in order to defy God who had told him to give his brother's wife a son  and he refused to do it by pulling out and spilling the seed instead of impregnating the woman.  That is why God smote Onan because Onan defyied God's will not because he spilled the seek it is why he did this that was the sin.

He volunteered at youth camps during the summer and being at a Catholic college, dealt with his difference from most other people in a very mature way.  If we talked about God, he was respectful.  He was quite Chivalrous to ladies and he did not easily give up on friends.  I think he is described quite well with "slow to anger, rich in kindness".    And while I of course never met him, let's not forget Ghandi.    I have pretty much always thought that many non-Christians act far more Christ-like than most of my fellow believers do.    Some people like to think that if you're not Christian you can't be Christ-like because the idea of that possibility flies in the face of their belief that works come from faith.  But anyone who looks around can see many non-Christians being Christ-like.|`|Tledw3eAaa	Yes.

Don't listen to CJ.|`|nGyOmjPsaa	I've met extremely nice people who were not Christian.  But I can't, even if I wanted to, call them "Christ-like".  Because that requires belief in God.  But I can definitely say that I've met some really mean and judgmental Christians and yet some overly nice and forgiving non-Christians.  The gift of love is not limited to only Christians.  God loves all his people, not just a slim few.  So why would He deny the gift of love/charity to one and give to the other?  But you know the devil doesn't try hard to tempt those who are already away from God.  The devil spends his time trying to tempt the ones who are trying to find God, and those who know God.  I am close to someone who is not Christian and this person seems to be Christ-like in his actions and words.  He is the most nicest, most kindest person I've ever met in my life.  He's giving, understanding, and compassionate.  But if you ask him something deep he doesn't know how to answer because he himself refuses to think about "deep things".  It's because there he meets the Truth and with the Truth known to him he will become vulnerable and "have to" change his ways.  But he's "not ready".  I wonder if he'll ever be "ready".  Please pray for him.  He's a precious child of God.  God bless+

As for Obama, he seems less egotistical than our previous president and is himself pluralistic (son of both an immigrant/foreigner and American, son of both a Muslim/atheist and a christian).  So I think it puts him in a unique position to be more open-minded when dealing with others who are different.|`|ZgIZrKi7aa	I disagree, there are more than two types of people in the world...This is just common sense...|`|C5bCr1Bhaa	Yup a fanatic can be found in any arena.

I mean what would be the point of being a fanatical despot if there was no on e around to enslave and terrorize.

lHJlwuqBaa	"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.  For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him." (John 3:16, 17), "Jesus answered, 'I Am the way and the truth and the life.  No one comes to the Father except through me.'" (John 14:6), "That if you confess with your mouth, 'Jesus is Lord,' and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved."(Rom.10:9)     Christianity is the *only* "religion" whose founder is still alive; founders of all other religions: Mohamed, Krishna, Buddha, Confucius, Joseph Smith, Mary Baker Eddy, Charles Taze Russell, etc., are all dead. True Christianity is *not* a religion, it is a relationship and a way of life!  Jesus also said, "'No one is good - except God alone.'" (Mark 10:18b, Luke 18:19b),  "for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,"(Romans 3:23)  In other words, when you come face to face with God and He asks you why you should be allowed to enter Heaven, good deeds, kindness, etc., won't matter at all!  The *only* acceptable answer to His question will be, "Jesus Christ, my personal Lord and Savior, died for my sins."|`|WvUVoAGTaa	Islam says that Jesus is not the son of God. Christianity says that Jesus IS the son of God and anyone who cannot accept that fact, does not really know God. And having a relationship with God is the one criterion for going to Heaven.     So, if you're asking if you can go to Heaven by just being a "good person", I'm afraid the answer is no. I think that you don't have to get all the nit-picky doctrines right about what happened when and to whom, but you DO need a relationship with God and believe that Jesus is his son. Good luck :)|`|Dhujji4Haa	Unless you accept Christ as your Saviour you won't go to heaven. Not works, not of righteousness lest any man should boast. Jesus says Iam the way, the truth and the light no man cometh unto the father, but by me.

Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation.     The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what!     Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)|`|Z5KvRSRCaa	How do you believe in both Islam and Christianity?

They are completely opposed to each other.    Islam does not believe that Jesus is the Son of God, the Saviour of mankind.  They do not believe in the New Testament, or Salvation by faith in Jesus Christ alone.  They do not believe in the Church, or anything else found in the N.T.  They also take a completely different view of the O.T. as well.    The Bible teaches that Salvation is by Faith in Jesus Christ as your Lord and Saviour.  It teaches that you can not be saved by good works at all, but only through the finished work of Christ on the Cross.    The question is, "Have you placed your trust in Jesus Christ as your Lord and Saviour?"  If you have, you will go to heaven.  If not, then you won't.

SfS4d0gkaa	In the Bible, it simply means "unclean".  Nothing more, or less.    Incest, which is what Lot did with his 2 daughters was an abomination but was not punished by God in Sodom & Gomorrah.  Apparently, it's not a big deal.  **************************************...  OR:  ABOMINATION    a-bom-i-na'-shun (piggul, to`ebhah, sheqets (shiqquts)): Three distinct Hebrew words are rendered in the English Bible by "abomination," or "abominable thing," referring (except in Gen 43:32; 46:34) to things or practices abhorrent to Yahweh, and opposed to the ritual or moral requirements of His religion. It would be well if these words could be distinguished in translation, as they denote different degrees of abhorrence or loathsomeness.  The word most used for this idea by the Hebrews and indicating the highest degree of abomination is to`ebhah, meaning primarily that which offends the religious sense of a people. When it is said, for example, "The Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that is an abomination unto the Egyptians," this is the word used; the significance being that the Hebrews were repugnant to the Egyptians as foreigners, as of an inferior caste, and especially as shepherds (Gen 46:34).  The feeling of the Egyptians for the Greeks was likewise one of repugnance. Herodotus (ii.41) says the Egyptians would not kiss a Greek on the mouth, or use his dish, or taste meat cut with the knife of a Greek.  Among the objects described in the Old Testament as "abominations" in this sense are heathen gods, such as Ashtoreth (Astarte), Chemosh, Milcom, the "abominations" of the Zidonians (Phoenicians), Moabites, and Ammonites, respectively (2 Ki 23:13), and everything connected with the worship of such gods. When Pharaoh, remonstrating against the departure of the children of Israel, exhorted them to offer sacrifices to their God in Egypt, Moses said: "Shall we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians (i.e. the animals worshipped by them which were taboo, to`ebhah, to the Israelites) before their eyes, and will they not stone us?" (Ex 8:26).  It is to be noted that, not only the heathen idol itself, but anything offered to or associated with the idol, all the paraphernalia of the forbidden cult, was called an "abomination," for it "is an abomination to Yahweh thy God" (Dt 7:25,26). The Deuteronomic writer here adds, in terms quite significant of the point of view and the spirit of the whole law: `Neither shalt thou bring an abomination into thy house and thus become a thing set apart (cherem = tabooed) like unto it; thou shalt utterly detest it and utterly abhor it, for it is a thing set apart' (tabooed). To`ebhah is even used as synonymous with "idol" or heathen deity, as in Isa 44:19; Dt 32:16; 2 Ki 23:13; and especially Ex 8:22 ff.  Everything akin to magic or divination is likewise an abomination to`ebhah; as are sexual transgressions (Dt 22:5; 23:18; 24:4), especially incest and other unnatural offenses: "For all these abominations have the men of the land done, that were before you" (Lev 18:27; compare Ezek 8:15). It is to be noted, however, that the word takes on in the later usage a higher ethical and spiritual meaning: as where "divers measures, a great and a small," are forbidden (Dt 25:14-16); and in Proverbs where "lying lips" (12:22), "the proud in heart" (16:5), "the way of the wicked" (15:9), "evil devices" (15:26), and "he that justifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the righteous" (17:15), are said to be an abomination in God's sight. At last prophet and sage are found to unite in declaring that any sacrifice, however free from physical blemish, if offered without purity of motive, is an abomination: `Bring no more an oblation of falsehood--an incense of abomination it is to me' (Isa 1:13; compare Jer 7:10). "The sacrifice of the wicked" and the prayer of him "that turneth away his ear from hearing the law," are equally an abomination (see Prov 15:8; 21:27; 28:9).  Another word rendered "abomination" in the King James Version is sheqets or shiqquts. It expresses generally a somewhat less degree of horror or religious aversion than [to`ebhah], but sometimes seems to stand about on a level with it in meaning. In Dt 14:3, for example, we have the command, "Thou shalt not eat any abominable thing," as introductory to the laws prohibiting the use of the unclean animals (see CLEAN; UNCLEANNESS), and the word there used is [to`ebhah]. But in Lev 11:10-13,20,23,41,42; Isa 66:17; and in Ezek 8:10 sheqets is the word used and likewise applied to the prohibited animals; as also in Lev 11:43 sheqets is used when it is commanded, "Ye shall not make yourselves abominable." Then sheqets is often used parallel to or together with to`ebhah of that which should be held as detestable, as for instance, of idols and idolatrous practices (see especially Dt 29:17; Hos 9:10; Jer 4:1; 13:27; 16:18; Ezek 11:18-21; 20:7,8). It is used exactly as [to`ebhah] is used as applied to Milcom, the god of the Ammonites, which is spoken of as the detestable thing sheqets of the Ammonites (1 Ki 11:5). Still even in such cases to`ebhah seems to be the stronger word and to express that which is in the highest degree abhorrent.  The other word used to express a somewhat kindred idea of abhorrence and translated "abomination" in the King James Version is piggul; but it is used in the Hebrew Bible only of sacrificial flesh that has become stale, putrid, tainted (see Lev 7:18; 19:7; Ezek 4:14; Isa 65:4). Driver maintains that it occurs only as a "technical term for such state sacrificial flesh as has not been eaten within the prescribed time," and, accordingly, he would everywhere render it specifically "refuse meat." Compare lechem megho'al, "the loaths ome bread" (from ga'al, "to loathe") Mal 1:7. A chief interest in the subject for Christians grows out of the use of the term in the expression "abomination of desolation" (Mt 24:15 and Mk 13:14), which |`|1iKEQ6yYaa	Abomination;                           things that are,to God an abomination;    Idolatry, incest adultery, sorcery, necromancy.|`|AA11536715	Yes, yes I do.|`|4999d7adc142f277d9650c9fcdbb39cdaa	1.  anything abominable; anything greatly disliked or abhorred.  2.  intense aversion or loathing; detestation: He regarded lying with abomination.  3.  a vile, shameful, or detestable action, condition, habit, etc.: Spitting in public is an abomination.|`|kFpFU97zaa	Why yes, yes I do.|`|RyhluHk3aa	Srong's concordance's Hebrew dictionary defines it as simply "disgusting".|`|f0dbf7bef8f4954ab34a161d799935c6aa	original hebrew word is hb[wt.

However, what is in the Bible appears different to different people who read the Bible according to the reader's personal agenda.    If one reads the sacred word with a good spirit, intending to seek ageless wisdom, or God's self-revelation, then the experience can be extremely spiritual.    Those who take a more pedestrian approach to the writings or who read because they must, seldom find anything that makes sense to them.    I believe your question intends to ask about spirituality, rather than spiritualism, for the latter is the practice of attempting to get in touch with the spirits of the dead.  Spiritualism is mentioned - in the case of King Saul - but it is condemned along with other occult practices that rely on evil spirits, etc.    Spirituality, on the contrary, is enjoined as the means of drawing closer to God and increasing one's faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.    An ancient couplet addresses the opposite ends of experience when looking at the same thing, but seeing differently:    Two men look out  Through the same bars;  One sees the mud,  And one the stars.    Raising one's sights makes one a winner where spirituality is concerned.

Just a little heads up as elders will find it disrespectful.      Next, Gypsies are not a subculture.  Subculture would be a group of people with a culture (whether distinct or hidden) which differentiates them from the larger culture to which they belong like Goths or Skinheads.  Gypsies are an actual CULTURE or RACE or MINORITY people like Native Americans, or African Americans.    There is lots of bad information out there so be careful but there is also a lot of valid and interesting information from reputable people such as Ian Hancock who is a Romani Professor at the University of Texas.  He has written many books and can sometimes be contacted.  There are some reps at www.nrado.com who might also be able to help you.   They are activists and educators who are also well respected in the community.  Not all Gypsies will talk to Gadje (outsiders) so you need to find people who are out there educating about the culture.    Baxtalo Drom! (look up what that means)    Good Luck!

TfO4wN7laa	To the person above me: that actually depends on the region you are in. For example, Melbourne and Sydney have quite a large number of Asians (Chinese, Vietnamese, Indian, Japanese, Korean etc.) whilst other parts are dominated by Italians and Greeks.      I believe an important aspect of Australian life is sports. Australia loves its sports, whether its AFL or tennis. Hundreds, if not thousands, will always be at stadiums to support their favourite team or athletes.     Another typical aspect will most likely be its beach culture. I guess that's pretty self explanatory.     I guess an important one would be its multiculturalism. Since there are so many diverse ethics etc. the Australian diet etc. have been affected.

I think the explanation that Matthew is the genealogy of Mary makes more sense than the legal v. biological descent explanation.    In the original language of Matthew, the word given for "husband" can also be "father."    Later in Matthew a different word is used for "husband" than in the genealogy, so this makes some sense.    >The words "gowra" (Matt 1:16) and "baa'la" (Matthew 1:19) can both mean man or husband. Gowra, however, also means father (it is derived from a root word meaning strong one or protector). The question becomes, "Why would the author call the same Joseph a "gowra" in Matt: 1:6, and a "baa'la" in Matt: 1:9? The obvious answer is the author was speaking of two different men.|`|LJ6vHfgoaa	From the Catholic Encyclopedia:    -------------    Heli (Gr. HELEI -- Luke 3:23) is evidently the same name as the preceding. In Luke he is said to be the father of Joseph, while in Matthew 1:16, Jacob was Joseph's father. The most probable explanation of this seeming contradiction is afforded by having recourse to the levirate law among the Jews, which prescribes that when a man dies childless his widow "shall not marry to another; but his brother shall take her, and raise up seed for his brother" (Deuteronomy 25:5). The child, therefore, of the second marriage is legally the child of the first (Deuteronomy 25:6). Heli having died childless, his widow became the wife of his brother Jacob, and Joseph was the offspring of the marriage, by nature the son of Jacob, but legally the son of Heli. It is likely that Matt. gives the natural, and Luke the legal descent. (Cf. Maas, "The Gosp. acc. to S. Matt.", i, 16.) Lord A. Hervey, Bishop of Bath and Wells, who wrote a learned work on the "Genealogies of Our Lord Jesus Christ", thinks that Mary was the daughter of Jacob, and Joseph was the son of Jacob's brother, Heli. Mary and Joseph were therefore first cousins, and both of the house of David. Jacob, the elder, having died without male issue, transmitted his rights and privileges to the male issue of his brother Heli, Joseph, who according to genealogical usage was his descendant.|`|A6q6Ravhaa	joseph sr|`|27722e46d7e1a47f6c3e2edef016aa14aa	Jacob.

You have got to keep yourself active, the more you think about it, the more it'll consume you. It sucks, but you have to ignore the reality to make yourself feel okay.

Focus more on the the things and people around you, maybe do a little volunteer work in the community---something worthwhile and fun, just to get outside your own head for a while. What you're describing sounds like a combination of anxiety and depression to me. You spend too much time thinking about too many different things with no particular objective or purpose in view.     Find something that you like and stay focused on that thing for a while. Make it interesting, like taking up a new hobby or learning how to play an instrument, or even an extra skills training course at school to learn how to do things with your own hands. If you can find a way to channel your thoughts and creative energy into actually producing something that makes you feel good about yourself, your problem will be solved.  Its the reason some people paint, or draw, or play the piano, or whatever... It relieves stress, provides an escape, and allows you to express your feeling in whatever you do. And it makes you feel good because you can do it however you want to do it while having fun with it.|`|baXQe4xLaa	wow. like you and these other folks... i constantly feel like this. but for me, i tend to hide everything. people think im this fun outgoing excited guy all the time... and in reality, im not.

sVClfrldaa	Who's doing the liking and what's being liked?  The verb gustar technically means "to please."  So, when you say "Me gusta correr," you're saying "running is pleasing to me," which we translate as "I like to run."    (I'm assuming all of the "you"s are singular, familiar.  Anything after this that is in parenthesis is optional.)    So, "I like you."  You are pleasing to me.  (A m) Me gustas (t).    "Do you like me?"  Am I pleasing to you?  ?(A ti) te gusto (yo)?    "Does he like you?"  Are you pleasing to him?  ?(A l) le gustas (t)?    "Do you like them?"  Are they pleasing to you?  ?A ti) te gustan (ellos)?    "Do they like you?"

As to your other points:    You cannot have a belief in atheism, it is defined as a lack of belief in God(s).  A single language would render many of the finest literary works obsolete.  A single government is not likely to be workable as there are too many irreconcilable differences (morality, even outwith religion) across nations.  A single monetary system actually makes various countries less successful unless you have unlimited mobility of labour and capital.    Other than that it would be nice to live in a world/society of reason and rational discussion.|`|eZbkg3BWaa	Here on R&S? Possibly maybe.  In the world as a whole?

Religion has a long history, a large population of believers as a result of that history, a fool-proof method to create the next generation of believers by converting them when they are young often through parents/grandparents et al., lots of money, organizational power and more importantly political muscle.  Atheists/agnostics have none of these.  So, there will always be more believers -- at least during our life time and even our grandchildren's lifetimes a hundred years from now.  In fact, this strengthen in numbers is necessary for many believers -- religion is basically a crutch.
e8a42257dd2b34817d2020222ee63839aa	It's not clear in English, but the original language implies that Cain's offerings of grain were not from the best portion of his crops.    Also, remember that Genesis arose from an almost pre-historic group of people whose ideas of God were still superstitious and fearful: they still believed that God prefered blood sacrafices over "vegetarian" offerings.    This was part of the rules of their worship.|`|8d89b255ad0cc448257f013c1fb8f3a8aa	Cain's offering was not given with a grateful heart, and Cain did not offer his best. Abel did, and God found favor with Abel. I think Cain was jealous of his brother and killed him.|`|eAMq1iBWaa	Go to the New Testament:    Hbr 11:4 By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaketh.      1Jo 3:12 Not as Cain, [who] was of that wicked one, and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous.|`|9mLjDa5kaa	God wanted faith, not works.     Abel came in faith.  Cain brought works.    God still wants only faith, and not our works for salvation.  Jesus is God. The only way to be saved, is by believing in Jesus alone to save you, without adding any of your own works.|`|AA10556726	The explanation that I've always heard is that Cain offered grain, but as God had killed animals to clothe Adam and Eve (i.e. cover their nakedness/sin) that He wanted a blood sacrifice.  This is consistent with other sacrifices that He desired and foreshadows the sacrifice of his son.|`|NR4hbYPiaa	I think that Cain got a bum rap, there was no trial,he had no lawyer, he was convicted on circumstantial evidence just cause he was in the area at the time.  There were no fingerprints or DNA samples taken, it could have been anybody that killed Abel.  Such injustice is unacceptable, I demand a retrial.|`|nxbuPeoCaa	God apparently likes slaughtered, bleeding animal skin instead of fresh produce    Who would have guessed?|`|tzz0BG8yaa	Cain killed Able because he was jealous.

Murdered if you do what god asks, father of a nation if you don't and kill off those who do?|`|RMgCtIt6aa	Cain didn't obey Gods regulations for offerings & he didn't even give his best either.God wanted blood shed for an offering .He was supposed to trade from his brother for the meat. He was jealous of his brother which is also wrong.  The cause of murder is hate & the cause of hate is not forgiving or holding a grudge.  Genesis 4:1-9   God is all great . Nothing nor  no one is comparable of His power Who created everything.We have no right to question the Great Almighty.|`|Di7JoX70aa	God didn't like Cain's offering because he needed a blood sacrifice which Abel offered up... you see Cain was jealous and that's when sin crept in. God is our sacrifice and the story of Cain and Abel just goes to show you that you can't work your way to heaven you  have to go by the blood. May God Bless You..

GBjMqElBaa	Good for you Dream I,  It could actually be both. Perhaps it has to do with having Christian parents that raised you well. Even if that is the case, it is still of gift from God. It could also be just plain good sense, but again.....a gift from God.   Even unbelievers get  some gifts from God, even if they are unaware of it. Matt. 5:45 says>>> 45 "that you may be sons of your Father in heaven. He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous."    But truly, in this age of sexual permissiveness, you are to be commended. The temptations are great. I can not help but think the Holy Spirit has blessed you. Take heed that you still remain on guard, as the evil one will try to find your weak points or even cause you to become complacent.  You have wisdom beyond your years. Many people see the commandments of God as a bunch of "DON'TS" that impede their fun. Little do they realize that the 10 commandments are actually ways to prevent us from being enslaved in sin and its many consequences. We try to avoid it as much as possible and live in harmony with God's will. When we do miss the mark, we are thankful for our loving Savior that forgives our sins.   God Bless!|`|AA10746826	God gives us knowledge. Chew on that for a while.....you tell me what it is.|`|AA11564934	there is no holy spirit.

The only reason people think this is the date that the end of the world will occur is because of the Mayan calendar...

Due to precedent scenarios, I have no reason to believe 2012 will be the end of the world... Every prediction has proved to be incorrect (obviously), and there's no logical basis behind this claim.

The Maya calender states that the world will end in 2012,but this has been misunderstood. They believe that a new world starts when the old ends. Also the "prophet" Nostraduamus readings has a similar date. All these preditions are based on astromony,when the sun allines with the center of the universe.

It is like a man going to a far country, who left his house and gave authority to his servants, and to each his work, and commanded the doorkeeper to watch. Watch therefore, for you do not know when the master of the house is comingin the evening, at midnight, at the crowing of the rooster, or in the morning lest, coming suddenly, he find you sleeping. And what I say to you, I say to all: Watch!    God is going to come to destroy all that is evil. Then, He will build a new kingdom... it will be in the spiritual realm.

If you need reassurance, ask a close friend. If you need to be taught a version of your religion that is empty of political agendas and general bigotry, then you should ask many people of different backgrounds.    But I don't think you need to study the Bible at all, at least not as a method of converting. You should believe on your own terms, and find comfort in the little truths that you discover for yourself. The Bible is only one source for this.    I'll refrain from encouraging you to become a deist instead, become an atheist instead etc etc. I will say, however, that some people actually find it liberating to leave their religion. Whatever.|`|zIXReHyTaa	As a Christian I found it hard to listen to or understand the preachings in the Church or the words of the Bible in relation to my life.  However, I did find peace, love and joy in sitting in an empty church, meditating to God alone and reading the words of Jesus and other wise men around the world.  Only recently I have found that I am probably a Christian Deist.  Look that up and see if it may suit you more.  Meditating may help you achieve the answers and find your true path.  I am not in a religion though, but just use the parts of it that I feel comfortable with that make me feel happy.  Good luck in your search but remember that you don't need a religion to accept you, God is already in your heart.|`|nVRfVWePaa	God has missed you everyday that you have been away from Him. He wants nothing more then for you to know Him and He wants to bless and love you. The first thing I would recommend you do is find a church and get involved. This will take a little research and some time. If you are young then ask around and find a church with lots of youth. Most Christian churches agree on the basic ideas of Christianity and so right now it is important that you find a place you feel comfortable with. As you grow as a Christian and begin to think things out for yourself you may find that other churches are a better fit. I would recommend reading your Bible and begin with Matthew as it explains a lot. You may want to go find a Bible that is written so you may easily understand it. Good luck in your new beginning and new life. Be Blesses.. If you have any other questions please ask|`|E0gm0mRBaa	You sound like me a few years ago. i am 27 with 3 kids, all before marriage. i had my first 2 by the time i was 17. i was a runaway, i was a drug addict then i met some ladies who seemed to have it all together at a play group i was taking my daughter to. they asked me to join a bible study group with them for mothers and i tell you it was the best thing i ever did. since then i've cleaned my act up, i live a stable life, my kids are thriving and i even went out and got myself a qualification to make a better life. I stood up in church one day and gave my testimonial which made most of the congregation cry. these woman made me feel comfortable and i was able to be myself and be honest with them and the didn't judge me. i'm roman catholic but attend the baptist church. log on to hillsong.com. i've been to their colour conferences and it changed my life. i've said to god if i can help anybody out there to let me know. 2 days later a distressed woman threw herself in my arms crying and i knew i was meant to help. that woman is so good now. also last year i said to god, please send me a blessing if you feel i deserve it. i was pregnant with in the week. god loves you and if you are feeling he is pulling on your heart strings, there is something he's wanting you to do. the best place to start is by asking him to let you know some how what it is he is asking of you. good luck|`|TEAXr347aa	YES! God wants you! Do you remember the criminal who was hung on a cross next to Jesus? He told Jesus to remember him and Jesus told him, "You will be in paradise with me today." If you give your life to Him, he will forgive ANYTHING. There is nothing you can do that God cannot forgive. Paul was a HORRIBLE person,cheating, killing people, but God changed him and he became such an important person in spreading the Good News! Find yourself a good church. I personally recommend a non-denominational church or a Christian and Missionary Alliance (C&MA)church.  As far as a Bible translation, NIV (New international Version) is the most used translation but there is a newer one out that's even easier to understand called the New Living Translation (NLT).

It's a great resource for any verse in the Bible.     The most important thing is salvation, KNOWING that you will be in heaven when you die.  Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation.     The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what!     Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)|`|HRvPoQzKaa	Years ago, I couldn't get past the first page.

Do not take it word for word however.     I am Christian but I do not have any real religious beliefs past a belief in God and Jesus. I think it's a good thing to help others.  Avoid violence and anger as much as possible.      My interpretation of God is that God is like a parent. God wants us to the right thing but will not make us do so. God wants us to do good things because it's what we "want" to do not what we "have" to do.     Why would God want someone who has made tons of mistakes?    The same reason my Mom and Dad will always love me no matter what I do. God created us and loves us all. We may not make the best choices all the time but God will not turn away from us. God's hand is always reaching out for ours. We are the ones that have to decide to take it.|`|LYnuEdKUaa	If you truly want to study the bible, instead of just read it like so many, then you need a good accurate bible first.  The RSV and the NAB are generally considered by scholars the most accurate bible translations.  The NAB is easier to read, but it has 73 books and your standard RSV only has 66.  If you're one of the Christians that rejects those 7 books like Martin Luther did, then you're probably going to want the RSV.    Next, depending on how serious you are in your bible study, you should pick up a Greek and Hebrew concordance, which will help you understand what meaning was lost in translation.  Make sure you get one from a good source, though.  The Strong's concordance is very popular, but the man who made it never spoke either language.  Obviously, not exactly a source you ought to listen to.  (as an aside - using one will really help you learn Greek and Hebrew, and if there's any other language you wish to learn, pick up a bible in that tongue as well.  It works great.)    Next, it is good to find a group of friends to study with.  This is because you can't see every little detail, so while you might miss something, your study buddy might pick up on it.  You get more out of it that way.    When you finally sit down to start reading, I would suggest you start at the beginning of the new testament.  The book of Matthew is a good way to break you into the bible without overwhelming you, and then the next three books are kind of like a recap of Matthew. (don't think you should just skip them though)    The last and most important part about bible study - screw all the advise.  All of these books and pamphlets and such out there that try and teach you how to study the bible are bunk.  Perhaps those methods worked great for the author, but everyone is different and you need to find your own way.  Follow the road less traveled, so to speak.|`|XhTn94JAaa	LMAO!

8d9b994728c633e86c2395da11a394a1aa	My view exactly.     I find that many religions, Christians especially, try to push their views on others and think others are automatically bad and wrong is they do not have a religion. Now, I am in no way saying religion is wrong and annoying, but I am around Christians every day (many of my friends are even Christian) and they seem to be the ones that are most pushy.     I know quite a few atheists, myself included, and they rarely try to push beliefs or criticize other religions. They mostly respect others' beliefs, even when they don't agree with them.    Atheism should be respected just as much as any other religion. I'm sorry if we don't seem to have any morals whatsoever, but that's not something for other people to judge.|`|mXajRsLsaa	*sigh* So true.

My question for them is, "What is wrong with behaving that way?"    If there really is nothing wrong with those sorts of activities, then even if belief in God eliminates them, it provides no useful benefit to society.    On the other hand, if there really is a reason why people shouldn't behave that way, then belief in God isn't necessary and only serves to distract people from the true underlying motive for civil behavior.    Either way, belief in God is not beneficial to society.|`|wR1XyyrUaa	You just became my new favorite theist.|`|1aa8b20a9151f0263c0e250dfc8c3448aa	True.|`|g0lKlQGnaa	If you check out this forum for a few days, you'll see alot of sarcasm and arrogance projected here by atheists, trust me    I'm not claiming that Christians never do this, but taking a cursory look around may give you a different opinion    Atheists probably outnumber Christians by at least 2 to 1 in this room , at the very least.

aO4iCwtoaa	In general, no - family members are not allowed to do the tahara (washing and dressing the body) of their loved ones, even if they're the same sex, because it is too difficult emotionally.  It is the same reason that Jews bury the dead immediately and don't allow an open casket - once someone is dead, the body is no longer considered theirs - it is more important to remember the person alive.    As far as Jewish law is concerned, it is not prohibited - if there is no one else available to do the tahara then the spouse would have to do so.  But so long as that is not the case, it simply isn't done.

Also the entire tomb has not been completely dug up yet so there are many artifacts that have not been recovered. A common legend says that he was buried with a legendary sword that took 3 years to make under a great master blacksmith. Also lots of valuables such as jade, gold and thousands of terracotta warriors and chariots.

CJ15IEGuaa	I don't know were you are, and I don't know what she likes, but it might be cool if you took her to a mall, if your nearest mall isn't that big you could try taking her to a larger on not too far away. You could hang out with her the whole day and let her pick out something that she likes, maybe a necklace or a body spray, or something else, within reason of course.   Another cool idea (i like it anyway) would be if you just spent the day doing things you both enjoy, ex. you could spend the day at one of your houses, hang out and talk, and watch a few movies. It doesn't have to be anything elaborate.  If your GF needs to relax, see if you can find a hand massage r, get her some lotion or spray in her favorite scent, a soft stuffed animal, and a bar of chocolate. (or her favorite candy if she doesn't like chocolate). Put it all in a basket with a bow and a flower and I can almost guarantee she'll love it.

Good Luck!|`|fvRYQlSLaa	that's so sweet of you. if you want to give her a break, maybe give her a gift card to get her nails done. my reccomendation is that no girl really wants to do anything like that so maybe get her two and tell her to take a friend with her. i know when i get stressed out it makes me feel better when my boyfriend just holds me and strokes my hair, with the occasional kiss on the forehead. just some ideas, good luck :)|`|d82nX4qiaa	i don't know where you are so i don't know if it will work, but its a suggestion. Where i live, there are a lot of cabins or things that you can rent on the mountains or on lakes or on islands, pretty much anywhere. They aren't too expensive, depending on where its at i guess. but it would be sweet to do something like that then make her dinner, or the rose petals leading too and on the bed and the candles everywhere. instead of sending her to get a massage or whatever, get some massage oil and do it yourself.
9mLjDa5kaa	If a person thinks they can "lose" or "leave" salvation under any circumstances, then that person doesn't have salvation.     Jesus gives eternal life to anyone who believes in Him alone for it.  It is not dependent on us.  We believe, and it is a done deal.    The only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what!|`|3ba0ab7304ca31210254987d14dbe035aa	The bible says, if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord, and believe in your heart God raised Him from the dead, you shall be saved.    Jesus said, if you abide in me, I shall abide in you.  Abide means, stay close to.    There are people who say you can't lose your salvation.  Well, the apostle Paul taught differently.  He said that there were those who followed after "false teachings" and shipwrecked their faith.    By the way, this is all biblical teaching.  So be very careful of people who tell you things with no scripture to back it up.|`|ZtxqJzfIaa	To Get saved: Accept Jesus, and live a good life.

You must believe all this is true and accept these facts.

13836b3017c70dbdfed99e90e57ae434aa	Interesting question.    From the point of view of anthropologists and psychologists what we perceive as 'conscience' is something that has evolved with us as humans.     However from the standpoint of philosophy -and let me remind you that most philosophers do not believe in evolving from common ancestor-the conscience is the biggest most important difference between us and every other being on this planet. It is what makes us human, the ability to tell between right and wrong and to maintain a stance on what we feel is wrong, while supporting what we believe is right.     For years philosophers have debated exactly where it came from, this is why there are so many different thought schools in this arena.     Some schools believe that its a sign of a higher power.     Refer to the Greek philosophers for some 101 on the matter.    As far as Im concerned, the whole 'conscience is learnt' theory is pretty bunk. This would completely single out the fact that there are very crappy parents out there, and not every child who has had bad parents turns out bad and without proper conscience.     The subject is a lot more deeper than this.    Edit: Consider that some people who have very decent parents turn out very strange, not because  they havent been taught either. There is a built in mechanism in human beings and whether  this is affected by our genes or not, the mechanism does not solely depend on outside influence.|`|AA11544192	What a good question!  Yes, conscience did evolve.  We humans almost never live alone, we live in societies--tribes, kingdoms, nations, and in order to do so, certain behaviors have to exist, and certain behaviors have to NOT exist.  It would be easier to eat simply by stealing food. No question about it, that would be the easiest way to live--to just take whatever you want or need.  Yet we can't, because if we all did, the structure of the society we were living in would collapse, and nobody would eat.  The society would not perpetuate itself.  So the rules of society perpetuate themselves as a survival value for both the society and the humans who live in those societies.  Whether the rules are inherent, or merely taught, makes no difference, they are there and they have to be there.  Its the same reason religion evolved--to maintain order.  But there is no god other than the ones (hundreds) that we have invented in order to keep our societies stable and self perpetuating. If it gives you comfort to believe in a god thats fine, it helps you remain a harmless and productive member of the society that you are part of, and which is evolving.|`|Tp3jOpc7aa	most animals don't have a conscience. obviously you don't know much about evolution because it does not say we evolved from apes. it says we evolved from ape like creatures. we still do have primitive urges, reflexes and instincts in the most primal part of the brain. Our brains and intelligence evolved with our bodies as we became better adapted to our world and recording information. We made tools and drew pictures on walls. We passed the knowledge on and those who adapted to the new knowledge were the ones who bred and those who did not died out. Only the strongest and smartest survived to reproduce and eventually become us humans today. And us humans today will give rise to the next step (if there is one)|`|GCNpbrCKaa	If evolution is how we got here then there is no reason why we should have a conscience its a feeling or small voice in your heart that tells you somethings wrong or immoral now what use would a monkey have for a conscience and infact what behavoir has been observed in animals to explain how a conscience would have evolved but the answer is theres no evidence it did so therefor we did not evolve so if we didnt evolve where did we come from did a creator create us and create a conscience so we know right from wrong these are questions we should ask and demand an answer so we may know the truth|`|R5MW3BSsaa	consciene comes from knowing right and wrong!|`|IZ7qdWhPaa	Conscience is a natural feeling inside the Humans, just like love and affection.  You know what's right and what's wrong through the effects your actions cause to the people, so if you hurt someone, you'll see them paining and as you won't like to be n their situation so your conscience starts to wake up.  The conscience thing develops with the religion.|`|4VrKKOwnaa	you  would have to be an expert on the brain to answer that, because that's all a conscience is, almost a deep thought of right or wrong. as to what it evolved from, you'd have to compare the brain of the animal in question and the human brain. as it currently stands, I don't think it has been disproven that apes don't have a conscience, they might, we may just not know, or it may not be to the extent of our own.|`|eBKJRmEgaa	Animals, from ants to elephants, have moral codes. That's exactly what a conscience is, albeit more complex morals determined by environment and society among other things.

These morals, for want of a better word, is completely different depending on the animal, for example a mother mouse, trapped by a cat with her young will eventually eat her children so that the energy she used to birth and feed the young is not lost to the cat but stays in her.  Sterile insects work tirelessly for the colony (ants, bees, termites etc.) with no reward, no chance of breeding.  This would be considered altruistic behaviour in a human, but can be explained away by evolution.    All these acts and many more are moral to the animal, some appear barbaric to us but we have different evolutionary needs.  our morals come from:  1) Evolution - what is the best way for a human being to act in various social situations to enable that human to live and succeed in order to pass on their genes.  Raping is one idea, but in a society it is punished severely.  Similarly with stealing and murder (within a society, however it is often rewarded if you do it to another society).  All this is in very early human society.  2) Society - as we exist in larger groups with fewer genes shared how should we act in that society to succeed and avoid punishment.  This includes various myths such as religions.  3) Parents - always our parents have an influence, not always beneficial.  4) Friends - people we are close to impact how we interact with others as we do not with to lose the social standing we have, o sometimes we seek to improve it by doing something the group like but may disagree with other morals we have.  5) Inbuilt - we have certain urges and views that are not influenced by external powers. These are often overridden by the imparted morals.  These may come from a genetic issue or a trauma (emotional or physical) that causes our brain to misfire in some way.    Morality, in its many forms in many animals, comes from an evolutionary benefit that they impart to that species.  Humans happen to live in much larger integrated societies with people that share relatively few genes so the biological imperative of following our most beneficial (reproduction wise) morals is less.  We are also much more intelligent than most animals and can over-ride or even change our morals.  We can also be very kind to total strangers and even not bother passing on our genes.|`|AA10564185	we didn't come from monkeys sweetie, we share a common ancestor and that is why we share 99.9% of their DNA|`|iX0CoNkXaa	Amen    Romans 2:15   "Which shew the work of the law written in their (non-believers) hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another"|`|yljPx5qsaa	Why do you suppose I need a god to tell me what's right or wrong?

Jesus said "..He who is without sin..let him throw the first stone,.." then He wrote in the sand and those that heard His teaching "..were convicted by their conscience.."  You ere born with a conscience and born with the knowledge of right and wrong.  It takes some teaching/training to develope your conscience to the current level your at.  The Bible also says:  Strive to have a conscience  Acts 24:16  I am not lying, my conscience  Romans 9:1  Wrath but also for conscience  1 Cor 10:25  faith with a pure conscience  1 Timothy 3:9  and more.

And the 'conscience' comes from shame which comes from having parents tell a child who has misbehaved, that he is a 'bad boy'. There is no evolution question in this at all. If you want to start with a very basic look at this, read Freud. He was wrong about a lot of things, but his idea of the Id, Ego, and Superego are stepping stones for later psychologists and psychiatrists to develop theories of human personality.|`|AC7Qp4Wqaa	:) Allah(s.w.t.) created man with this.|`|GW8LVWT8aa	apes can tell right from wrong    no really, they can.    like omg if god was proven not to exist would you go around killing people?

If you were born into a world where everyone ate human babies, and this was considered completely normal, you'd be a cannibal, too.    Humans are also social animals, like dogs or rats. We evolved to instinctually depend upon and assist others, and therefore we have no instinct to go on a killing spree.|`|LEAx00NEaa	in the bible when it tells about the 7 days those days could've been millions of years 4 us. so i believe that's how the dinosaurs were created and God gave us a conscience.

So to be in heaven and not hell, believe the truth about Jesus now! :)     Only faith alone in Jesus saves! Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation.     The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what!     Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)|`|DQjAGWXQaa	I return to the Earth and hope I nourish a purdy tree|`|qkAoxusxaa	if your a christian, you go to heaven, if your lost, you go to hell. how to get saved?? only through Jesus Christ.     thats not my opinion it;s the truth.|`|2BBKHggeaa	From dust you are, to dust you will return........

I'm going to heaven by the Grace of God. Though, I deserve hell like nobody's business. I'm getting to Heaven by the blood of Jesus Christ... because He loved me when I was still a sinner. To get this gift, I had to put my full "trust" in Him and "repent" so that He could live in me & transform who I was.    HEAVEN is a place where there's...   no more suffering,  no more dandruff,  lol.  no more exhaustion,  no more deterioration,  no more rust,  & no more pain.    "And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes; there shall be no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying. There shall be no more pain, for the former things have passed away. Revelation 21:4    "I will give of the fountain of the water of life freely to him who thirsts. He who overcomes shall inherit all things, and I will be his God and he shall be My son." Revelation 21:6,7    //////////////////////////////////////...    After heathens die?  the ones who are full of pride, reject the love of Jesus, live to please only themselves, the blinded ones, the sinners who try justifying themselves, the ones who do not put their trust in Jesus for their salvation, they will end up in hell.    HELL is a place where there's...  no peace,  no fresh-air,  no conversation,  no healing,  no life,  no rest,  no water,  no light,  no goodness from God.    "But the cowardly, unbelieving, abominable, murderers, sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death. Revelation 21:8    "And I say to you that many will come from east and west, and sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven. But the sons of the kingdom will be cast out into outer darkness. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

MJYqMm05aa	Conventional banking has shown itself to be a greedy, rapacious monster incapable of handling it's own affairs.  Islamic banking is based on the principles that it's immoral to lend money at interest, and that it's immoral to profit from dishonest and irreligious practices, even at a distance.    Christianity contains the same instructions, which is why traditionally the Jewish people in Northern Europe formed the majority of money lenders - because Christians were forbidden to lend at interest, they essentially forced the Jewish population to do it for them.    Organised international banking is essentially a parasite on society, existing solely to profit from the inadequacies of the exchange system.  Islamic banking, in common with other attempts at ethical banking practices, represents an attempt to address this problem while recognising the need for banks, and of the necessity of access to capital for society.    He lends at usury and takes excessive interest.  Will such a man live? He will not! Because he has done all these detestable things, he will surely be put to death and his blood will be on his own head. (Ezekiel 18:13)    If you lend money to one of my people among you who is needy, do not be like a moneylender; charge him no interest. (Exodus 22:25)

I say this with great sadness, for our ignorance is Satan's greatest advantage over us.? I recently read an interesting book by William Guy Carr, titled, PAWNS IN THE GAME (1958).? Here's a quote from page 126 that should concern parents out there...    Lenin had said: "The best revolutionary is a youth devoid of morals."? His word being law in Communist organizations, all members work secretly to make young people of both sexes anti-social and immoral.? Children up to teen-age are taught to rebel against the discipline of the home.? Parents are represented to their children as old-fashioned.? Parental authority is scoffed at.? The subverters argue that parents have lied to their children since they were old enough to listen, regarding Santa Claus and where babies come from.? The subversives claims parents are the victims of reactionary teachings and capitalistic exploitation.? The child is encouraged to educate the parents in regard to modern and progressive ideas.? They are warned that, for their own good, they must refuse to be dominated or disciplined by their parents.? The purpose of this subversive campaign is to destroy the sanctity, and unity, of the home which is the foundation upon which our civilization is founded. (SOURCE: PAWNS IN THE GAME, page 126, by William Guy Carr, 1958).  What a powerful mouthful of truth!? Kids today are being brainwashed by television (i.e., hellivision) and music to have no morals, and to backtalk (sass) their parents.? That's exactly what the Communists want.? It's not uncommon these days to hear children on TV telling their parents to grow up or to be quiet.? The same defiance is found in movies, whether by Walt Disney or Warner Brothers.? Music is without a doubt the biggest offender.? There is nothing more detrimental to the spiritual growth of a teenager than worldly music, which captivates the soul, and preaches a gospel of SELF, SEX, and SATAN.?  There is a sinister agenda at work in television and movies today, which is committed to the corruption of our youth's morals and faith in the Bible.? Take for example, Walt Disney's blasphemous Bridge to Terabithia, which denies the existence of Hell, and teaches youth that open-minded people could never believe in eternal damnation.? Teenagers today are under attack by Satan like never before! ??  Communism Thrives in a Selfish and Complacent Society that Doesn't Care  Communism is the machine of the Illuminati, i.e., the occult group trying to usher in a one-world global police state.? One needs to only read the statements of social sickos like George Brock Chisholm to clearly see what the Communists are trying to achieve--the total eradication of Christianity, family, morality, and the U.S. Constitution.? Communism's goal is nothing less than totalitarianism, i.e., a global police state!? Young people with no morals grow up to be rebellious adults with no concern for truth or justice.? This describes conditions in America today.

The Islamic month is either 29 or 30 days, depending on whether the crescent of the new moon is sighted after the 29th day of the month or not. If it is cloudy and the crescent is not sighted after the 29th day, then the month is 30 days.|`|DFrzrmiDaa	i think the simple answer to your question is that     Crescent Moon: This is to have a reference, a reference of counting that's all i believe,     Which crescent: the crescent of the new moon is the start of every muslim month and it is sighted every month.

If you are a follower of evolution and more than likely atheist, this is fine and wonderful. However, you question is a challenge for Christians to prove creationism without using scripture remember that at one point in human history scripture did not exist. Man did look at the natural world and try to figure out what it all meant. He then came up with scripture because science had not advanced enough for him to comprehend the intricate workings of our planet.|`|qJkRPhIKaa	ok i will say this for the last time...    everyone knows there is no such god. There are either in denial or an athiest. The person who wrote the bible was a con man. he wrote a fiction story and got tons of power and money for it.    Evolution has nothing to do with documentation. The only reason there are documents with its facts is so that way its easy to remember/ anyone can have access without traveling 100+ miles to ask a scientist about it.    Without the documentation evolution can still be very much proved. Without the bible and molesting priests however. There would be only one belief. And that belief would be athiest|`|AA11119246	well i know one thing, you cant disprove the fact that we were created, we could discuss how we were created or even what methods god used but you cant dispute that this world was created. define natural? and how did that come about, how is it that the earth rotates around the sun just so perfectly to support our life, or that we have night and day that is also required for the survival of this earth. or the moon, without it this earth would not support life. everything is the way it is not by accident like some ignorant people would lead you to believe, its there because that's the way god designed it for you and me.     dont be ungrateful|`|0rBpirPCaa	That's impossible!!!  GOD would not leave us without our manual, the Bible.  If Creationism didn't exist, humans and all other creatures would not exist.  Evolution is man made, and every christian, atheist, etc. knows this.  The people who do not believe in GOD do not want to follow the ten commandments or the laws of nature to have eternal life, so they like the man-made alternative which leads to destruction and unhappiness.  This goes for some christians also who say the ten commandments are done away with, listening to false preachers instead of reading and studying what GOD says in the KJV Bible.|`|hR7OsqtRaa	Who created Humans.? People may say The Big Bang. Then Who Created the Big Bang.? Particles ? Who created the particles ? I can keep going on and on.  Answer : Humans are not real since there is no evidence of their evolution.  Would you accept the above argument. ?  If I tell you Who Created God, then you would say Who created the one who created God and it would go on and on.  We know God is real, since we are real. If you deny God, then you have to deny your own existence, which is impossible. No matter how knowledgable or intelligent you are, you cannot deny that there has to be a supernatural force that has created our planet and our body and, that creator is God.      In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"    The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.    There are a lot more chapters and verses mentioned in the below website along with music, speeches and praise and worship.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    Jesus is God. He is alive forever.    The questions usually asked are:-    1) Did Jesus really exist?  2) Is Jesus God?  3) If Jesus is God, then why did He keep praying to the Father in Heaven? How can the Father and Jesus be one God? Why did Jesus have to suffer on the Cross?  4) What is the Holy Spirit?  5) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?      It would not be possible to give a short answer to these questions .    I suggest you visit the below website.    After visiting the below website, you would get a lot of answers.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus  specifically.)  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became  flesh (John 1:1-14)  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as  "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT  (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)  16. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6) and "God" also be called the  Mighty God in Isaiah 10:21  17. Jesus is able to raise Himself from the dead (John 2:19-21)  18. Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things  by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship  is used in each place.)  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts  7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father  that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John  8:58.  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see  Exodus 3:14.  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).  26. Jesus is the One who will judge you on judgement day (John 5:22-23). Only God can be the judge.  27. Jesus forgives sins (Luke 5:20) (Luke 24:47,Acts 10:43) .Only God can forgive sins.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com|`|3ba0ab7304ca31210254987d14dbe035aa	Let's see.

Since you can't prove it *with* the bible, I don't know how it could be proved without it.  (Same goes for the theory of species evolution, BTW)      2) How would you come up with Creationism, because there is no evidence for it?    Well, THIS statement is not correct.  There IS evidence which supports the theory of creationism.  There just isn't a whole lot.  Creationism is not as WELL supported by evidence as is the theory of species evolution.      3) Christians, can you prove creationism with out using scripture? Or even prove God for that matter?    No - it is not possible to prove these things without God actually telling us so (on video tape, presumably, since you reject the bible).    Similarly, the theory that speciation (the **existence** of different species) is solely the result of species evolution cannot be proven.  No joke - it CANNOT be proven.  At best, someday it will be proven that species evolution CAN and DOES occur.  They will never be able to prove - without the ability to view prehistoric events - that species evolution is responsible for all species on the earth, or even that it is solely responsible for even ONE species on the earth.    Just so you know - the theory of species evolution is not all that non-scientists make it out to be.

For instance, a bird called the Blackpoll Warbler has been tracked flying from Alaska to New England and then out over the Atlantic, catching the Jet Stream back to South America, then flying back all the way to Alaska every year.    If somebody asked US to construct a flying machine that can fly from Alaska to New England to South America and back unaided, could we? But suppose they also asked us to make it weigh less than one ounce. Could we? And no one may build it--it must build itself, because that is what the Blackpoll Warbler does in its egg, doesn't it? Feathers, dual TV cameras, flight computer and all. From a speck in an egg. Would we even try? Could the US government? The entire University system, with an impressive array of bright students, knowledgeable professors and able administrators? All those advanced human brains combined, connected together by the Internet? No? So how much sense does it make to say that blind, unthinking Chance just "accidentally" did so through blind, unthinking evolution?     My young school friend pointed out that since we have about 100 trillion cells in our body and each has about 5 feet of DNA, that makes about 100 trillion times 5 feet, or 100 billion times 5000 feet (about a mile), or 100 billion miles of perfect code that is required to make us a body that works. Since the characters (the "letters") that that code is "printed" in are actually the size of molecules, that makes a lot of "typing" to give us a body. Could we type that much without making a mistake, since any mistake would cause a genetic weakness or birth defect? Could blind chance?     Another thing. Ever tried to swat a fly? Not necessarily easy, right? Know why? It has to do with the fly's navigational system. It has a single vibrating rod in its abdomen, and as it changes direction in flight, it senses the changes in the vibrations of that rod and is able to dodge you, fly and land upside down and backwards. What would the Air Force pay to have flying and navigational systems that good?    How did the fly manage to evolve such a system? Even if it evolved the vibrating rod, what good would it be without the nerves to send the signals from the rod to the brain? And the section of the brain to interpret the signals? And the correct instructions to interpret them? And the correct instructions to the part of the brain that controlled the wings as to what to DO about those signals? All AT THE SAME TIME. Wouldn't that be a remarkable coincidence? I ask people, "Could YOU sit down, right now, and write the code for such a set of instructions? And if your ten billion well trained and coordinated neurons put together can't do it with a computer, is it really reasonable to think that flies did it by themselves?"    The fly has a complete navigational system that is self-constructing (in its egg), self-reproducing, self-programming, self-correcting, that can fly upside down and backwards, avoiding dangers and locating and recognizing fuel (food), that requires even MORE entire, completely developed systems that even large groups of highly educated humans cannot or are only now beginning to be able to copy (and only by intelligent design), all microminiaturized into a space smaller than the head of a pin, with the code for it in characters that are the size of molecules (I wonder how many characters per inch that works out to? Pretty hi-tech data storage).     So I ask people, "In your experience, how many complete flying and navigational systems do you know of that have happened completely by accident, with no intelligent thought or design?" "Did you ever read the story of all the thought and work needed to design and build a flying machine, as told by the Wright brothers themselves? So how scientific is it to say that it just happened by blind accidents in the case of the lowly, incredibly complex fly?"    All of the animal and plant world is full of examples like these. Your body is, too. Johns Hopkins University made the newspapers by making one enzyme. It must have been pretty hard to do. It was no accident. But your liver manufactures over nine hundred enzymes, all necessary for you to live, and no one thinks about putting THAT in the paper, or giving credit for that accomplishment to the One who deserves it. "Could have happened completely by accident" (which is what evolution equates to, isn't it?) But if it could happen so easily, simply by accidents of evolution, then why put the university in the news because it was able to produce ONE?    This isn't defending the horrible things that have been done, like the Inquisition, and unscientific things taught, like a 7,000-year-old earth, by very fallible people supposedly in God's name...    Best regards,  Mike|`|pbT0tJvqaa	I would talk about the ebla tablets that have been discovered and have the creation story with adam and eve. They date to before the bible.     Lord of heaven and earth: The earth was not; you created it. The light of the day was not; you created it. The morning light you had not yet made exist.  http://www.time.com/time/magazine/articl...    I would point out that of all the known writings of the world we can find the story of adam and eve from ancient times but no writings that great grandpa was anything other than human.     I already mentioned the ebla tablets   We have the adam and eve cylinder seal 2200 to 2100 BC  http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/hig...  shows a woman handing man a piece of fruit with a serpant behind her.     We have the LIST OF KINGS AND CITIES FROM BEFORE THE FLOOD MS 2855 Babylonia, 2000-1800 BC   http://www.schoyencollection.com/sumeria...    The list provides the beginnings of Sumerian and the worlds history as the Sumerians knew it. The cities listed were all very old sites, and the names of the kings are names of old types within Sumerian name-giving. Thus it is possible that correct traditions are contained, though the sequence given need not be correct. The city dynasties may have overlapped. It is generally held that the Antediluvian king list is reflected in Genesis 5, which lists the 10 patriarchs from Adam to Noah, all living from 365 years (Enoch) to 969 years (Methuselah)    Then I would ask why do all the people who wrote history back then all come up with the same story if they did not all come from the same place? Why did everyone who lived in recorded history of mankind have the creation of the world as their history and not that great grandpa looked like an ape.     Then I would talk about Darwin and his theory of evolution which he himself states that we would find many transitional fossils and show that todays palentologists say that they have not found these fossils.     Then I would talk about how inaccuarate many scientists have shown that radiometric dating methods do not work.     "What complicates things for the uranium-lead method is that nonradiogenic lead 204, 206, 207 and 208 also exist naturally, and scientists are not sure what the ratios of nonradiogenic to radiogenic lead were early in the moon's history...The problem of how much lead was around to begin with still remains...If all of the age-dating methods (rubidium-strontium, uranium-lead and potassium-argon) had yielded the same ages, the picture would be neat. But they haven't. The lead ages, for example, have been consistently older...Isotopic ages have been obtained for material from five landing sites on the moon--those of Apollo's 11, 12, 14, 15 and Luna 16; each site has a different age. But in a given site, the ages also vary...Ideally, however, any one basaltic rock from a given site should yield the same isotopic age, regardless of the method used.", Everly Driscoll, "DATING OF MOON SAMPLES: PITFALLS AND PARADOXES", Science News, Vol. 101, p. 12    "It is now well known that KAr ages obtained from different minerals in a single rock may be strikingly discordant." Joan C. Engels, DIFFERENT AGES FROM ONE ROCK, Journal of Geology, ,Vol.79, p.609    Then I would talk about pulonium halos in the primordial granites of the earth that show that the earth was formed quickly and not by a long slow process that the theory of evolution needs to be valid.     Then I would ask reasonable and logical people to decide if we should take the word of the people who lived at the beginning of time or what someone thought happened in a land far far away in a time long long ago thought up in the past 200 years.|`|s40sgQ45aa	Yes PLEASE look at the natural world!

(Gen. 9:5; Ps. 36:9) Hence, suicide, which means the taking of ones own life, or killing oneself, is condemned by the Bible. Such intentional act is self-murder. (Ex. 20:13; 1?John 3:15) The few suicides mentioned in the Bible are of those who were unfaithful to God and who failed to consider that their lives really belonged to God.1?Sam. 31:4; 2?Sam. 17:5-14, 23; 1?Ki. 16:18; Matt. 27:5.    One who intentionally takes his own life does so in utter disregard for the sacredness of life; he becomes bloodguilty. When one commits suicide while in possession of ones mental faculties, this shows one to be void of morality, lacking faith, having no fear of God. It is a cowardly act, where one refuses to face up to the problems and responsibilities of life. If the person claimed to be a true Christian, the act would violently break his relationship with Jehovah. Suicide may be the giving in to pressures from demons who encourage self-destruction. (Matt. 17:14-18) This extremely self-centered act of murder manifests no love for ones surviving family members, no love for ones congregation and friends, and no love even for the surrounding community, as it brings shame and distress of mind upon all associates.Mark 12:31.|`|boRsg0sxaa	Depends on the manner in which you die for that cause.

Conservatives give more money to charity than Liberals.    67 percent of Christians volunteer.  44 percent of atheists volunteer.    Conservatives volunteer more than Liberals.    Christian families give $2,210 to charity each year.  Atheists families give $642 to charity each year.  Christians give away more money and more time when comparing any income level.    71 percent of Chrsitian families give to 'secular' charities.  61 percent of atheists families give to 'secular' charities.    Conservatives give more to secular charities than Liberals..    60 percent of Christians volunteer for 'secular' causes.  39 percent of atheists volunteer for 'secular' causes.    Conservatives volunteer more for secular causes than Liberals.    Christians give $532 to 'secular' charities each year.  Atheists $467 to 'secular' charities each year.    Christians give more blood than atheists.  Christians are more likely to help the 'homeless' with food or money.  Christians are more likely to return excess change to a cashier.  Red states(conservative) give away more money than blue states(liberal) despite lower incomes.    In light of the above it is interesting to note that;    (1) A higher percent of Liberals than conservatives believe that the income discrepency is too large between the poor and rich.  (2) A higher percent of Liberals than conservatives believe that the government should do more to reduce the income discrepency.  (3) A higher percent of Liberals than conservatives believe that we have become a society of 'have' and 'have nots'.    Even deducting church tithing, Christians give more than atheists.  Of 15 large studies being studied and combined it has been shown that that in no measurable way are Liberal atheists more charitable  than Christian Conservatives.  In fact, of all of the demographic groups studied it is the Liberal atheists who give the least time and money than anyone else.  Yet it is the Liberal secularists that complain into perpetuaity about the plight of the poor and that 'somebody' should do something about it!  Overall it is the Liberal atheists that enjoy the highest incomes only to consume their wealth upon their own lusts thus proving out their error.|`|13836b3017c70dbdfed99e90e57ae434aa	Ive a very big ultra mega selfish gene, its called: protect everything alive...    ^^     Yep that includes you too Julia.

Fifth, You are so far from understanding the spell that might be cast (which is unlikely with modern witches) that you have no hope of a workable counter spell.    Sixth, you dont have the power to empower the counter spell because you dont do magic. If you do, you are also practicing witchcraft, and so you are suspect from the ground up.

zZxX5PXBaa	The doctrine is called 'justification by faith' and it's traditionally associated with Martin Luther, although there are expressions of it going way back earlier in church history. The related doctrine is 'Atonement', which is the question of how God overcomes the separation between himself as a holy God and sinful creatures (us). There have been different theories of the Atonement, nearly all centring on Christ's death on the cross being some sort of sacrifice that paid the price for our sins. Ideas of just how this worked, though, have varied from it being a ransom paid to the devil, through to it being a sort of judicial arrangement. Theories of salvation have varied from the idea that Christ's death achieved everything necessary, so we're all saved automatically, through Christ's death having achieved what's necessary but we have to believe in it to get the benefit (your justification by faith doctrine) through to Christ's death being important and necessary but it still depending on us either living a holy life or accepting certain church practices (like baptism). Plus every conceivable variation on these, plus plenty of inconceivable variations. But justification by faith was the thing that Martin Luther clarified, and became a central issue in the Reformation, which was in turn one of the biggest cultural and political upheavals in European history, so it wasn't just a theological doctrine, it was a political rallying cry too.|`|uxfacsgmaa	Protestantism.|`|9mLjDa5kaa	It's a pejorative label like "antinomianism", however Jesus would undoubtedly have had this word used on Him, had the word existed at that time.

It is however the easiest and that is why Christians use them.<br>  <br>  Perhaps there are linear arguments. On these pages people will ask questions as to why Christianity has copied  and plagiarized from other religions. Some people see that the truths in the bible are held in common with other religions.<br>  <br>  While some Christians focus on the esoteric and unique aspects of Christianity and appear to be off the planet others can see the that it is interconnected with other religions and has its feet firmly on the earth. That does not make some Christians right and others wrong.<br>  <br>  I would point to the historical evidence. For some reason people want to dismiss the historical evidence. It comes down to something like there is no evidence in the Roman records therefore it is not true. What if Pontius Pilate cooked the books to cover his tracks? There would be no Roman record.<br>  <br>  If Pilate substituted Jesus into taking the wrap for a known felon. The records would reflect the known felon, not Jesus, therefore the record of Jesus crucifixion would not be in the official records. Pilate would have to invent stories like he had the ability to substitute one for another though under Roman law he does not. These excuses are recorded in the bible but obviously would not appear in any official record.<br>  <br>  As a secondary external reference it is significant that the substitution story has found its way into Islam. Where there is smoke there is fire.<br>  <br>  Another point is that it is unlikely that the disciples would have got it so wrong about Jesus teachings. He would not have been such a great teacher as many people claim him to be if his disciples got it so wrong.<br>  <br>  Last point: is the bible myth or legend? A myth is a story made up to express a moral. A legend is a story based on a truth but the story has become fantastic and has evolved during the course of time.<br>  <br>  So the bible may contain the truth of the moral of the story or the bible may contain the truth that started the legend. Or  a mixture of both. The bible contains truth about what it says about human nature.|`|EBGdlo35aa	1) Why do Christians believe that the bible contains truth?<br>  <br>  I'm guessing that it's because the bible contains truth.  One of those quirky things, you know - believing something just because it happens to be true.<br>  <br>  <br>  2) On these pages, Christians often say that something is true because the bible says it is.<br>  <br>  OK - this is a different thing altogether.  Naturally, many Christians accept the bible as an authoritative reference.  Consider it in the same light as Darwin's work on the theory of species evolution.  Some consider it authoritative, others find it error-prone.  The difference is that Darwin's work has verifiable errors, while the bible does not.  Therefore, those of us which hold the bible as authoritative can do so without appearing unreasonable.  Yes, it is a matter of faith - but not a matter of "blind" faith.  Naturally, though, not everyone accepts the bible as authoritative.  Clearly, you are one who does not.<br>  <br>  When someone uses the bible as proof, the best that you can do in response is "I do not accept the bible as an authoritative reference.  Is there any other support for your claim?"<br>  <br>  Jim, <a href="http://www.bible-reviews.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.bible-reviews.com</a>|`|cIvFOzoiaa	It's what they're taught.  Christianity was beat into the brains of our ancestors, so now most people are still Christians who're taught that the bible is truth.<br>  I agree with you, but I don't see anything wrong with seeing the bible as true as long as it isn't used for discrimination.|`|jCgnnWmuaa	You must be blinded by doubt and narrow minded.

The evidence then becomes crystal clear.  Thanks for asking.|`|8IHfytEvaa	The Bible is the most highly scrutinized and validated book from antiquity.<br>  <br>  Many secular historians talk about Jesus being crucified by Pilate and include the report that His followers believe He rose from the dead.<br>  <br>  There are alt last ten first century sources which state this.  However I can only think of two names off the top of my head:<br>  <br>  Flavius Josephus and Tacitus.<br>  <br>  The other 8 names I'm sure are listed in the books below.<br>  <br>  Archaologists are digging up new evidence which validates the Bible, like finding Noah's Ark and finding the coral encrusted remains of the Egyptian Army at the bottom of the Red Sea.  They even found evidence to suggest that King Tut, the boy king whose tomb contents were on display accross America ten or 15 years ago is the tomb of the son of Pharoh who died on that first passover.<br>  <br>  For more information about that see this link where you can buy the DVD:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.michaelroodministries.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.michaelroodministries.com/</a><br>  <br>  There are many in the past 150 years who have tried to write books disproving the Bible who ended up becoming Chrisitans and writing books which prove the Bible is true:<br>  <br>  Civil War General Lew Wallace who wrote Ben Hur<br>  <br>  Frank Morison who wrote Who Moved the Stone in about 1935.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Who-Moved-Stone-Frank-Morison/dp/0310295610" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Who-Moved-Stone-Fr...</a><br>  <br>  Josh McDowell<br>  <br>  <a href="http://books.google.com/books?as_auth=Josh+McDowell&source=an&ei=2-SlSZboFNWDtweVlqDYBA&sa=X&oi=book_group&resnum=4&ct=title&cad=author-navigational" rel="nofollow">http://books.google.com/books?as_auth=Jo...</a><br>  <br>  Lee Strobel, who was Legal Editor of the Chicago Tribune who tried to write a book to disprove the Bible and then once he examined the evidence he decided the most reasonable view of the evidence is that the Bible is true.<br>  <br>  He wrote many books which made the New York Times Best Seller list in the past 15 years:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.leestrobel.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.leestrobel.com/</a><br>  <br>  Then there is a Muslim Cleric, who was told by his Emir to read the Bible and to write book to prove it false.

We believe in what the bible says because since kids we were taught about it as the word of God.  Same as Koran for Islams.  So, there really is no debate. Belief in a God is the important thing.|`|634jf1L4aa	Christians rely on the Bible as the Word of God, and the Word of God is God's word.  There's no questioning.  Since God is all-powerful and all-knowing, Christians can have complete faith in His words no matter what.  A scripture in Proverbs states,"Trust in God with all thine heart and lean not into thine own understanding".  One of the reasons for this is that their interpretation of the Bible is the only foundation for their beliefs, so to question it would be to crack their foundation.<br>     The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (my church) believes "the Bible to be the word of God as far as it is translated correctly".  The Bible contains errors after being translated over and over for centuries by uninspired individuals.  This is the reason why there are so many sects of Christianity in our day....all profess to believe in Christ, yet their beliefs as how to be saved vary slightly.|`|MdXwD2JSaa	Their blind, unyielding faith.<br>  What you're saying is completely true.

256t9bIqaa	Your question is good.    The reason why God spends so much time trying to sway us is because God is looking for a willing bride.  No kidding.  He created us to be his bride.   He doesn't force anyone to marry him just like you wouldn't force any woman to marry you.    You want a bride who loves you, not one who hates you.    At the same time this is God's universe.   God created man to live in the same environment as He does.    Some people don't want God.    Those people will be like a fish out of water.    So God clearly gives us a warning, "I didn't built hell for you."           As for hardening Pharaoh's heart.    Moses wrote that about 1450 BC.   In those days, the Hebrews blamed everything on God.   The Hebrews didn't know of a personal being named Satan until the time of the Babylonian Exile (600 BC)--800 years after Moses.   So the Hebrews blamed God got blamed for everything, good and bad, until they learned more.        The first mention of Satan is in 1 Chr 21:1 where "Satan incited David to take a census."     The same story is told first in 2 Sa 24.1.    In 2 Sa it reads "The Lord incited David to take a census."  The only difference is that 2 Chronicles was written after the Babylonian Exile, and 2 Samuel was written hundreds of years before the Babylonian Exile.|`|Lh391IV4aa	I agree, this current god is silly.

As each of the Ten Plagues befell Egypt, Pharaoh hardened his heart rather than displayed godly fear. Jehovah did not force Pharaoh into a course of disobedience but allowed that proud ruler to choose.  "When Pharaoh got to see that relief had taken place, he made his heart unresponsive; and he did not listen to them, just as Jehovah had spoken" That's from Exodus 8:15 Some Bible translations are more accurate in their rendering of the original Greek.|`|bT3mzootaa	There is a way that seems right to a man..but the end of it is death.|`|P5ZkSjyQaa	Trying to make sense from nonsense will scramble your brain.  Stay away from it.|`|2zgv89OQaa	God gave us a free will so we could choose right from wrong , Heaven. from Hell.   Everywhere in the Bible where people came under the judgement of God it was due to their disobedience and failure to follow after him.  I choose to live for God because he is a God of Love and he has never let me down.  You make him sound like a vengeful God, the only time that he is a God of revenge is when people turn their backs on him.   It's our choice.|`|oVail6aAaa	When God created us he could have forced us to love him, or programmed us that way, but he wanted us to want to love him. And he doesn't spend all his time "trying to sway us", he is using all his time "trying to 'save' us"... which is a pretty cool thing. All God cares about is us, and all he wants is for us to love him. It's not something to get mad about, it's something to rejoice over! he loves us enough to make sure we make the right decisions.
db7df25ea31227e5641d5c32d43c3bcdaa	Ecclesiastes 2:24 "There is nothing better for a man, than that he should eat and drink, and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour."    eat and drink is the basics of life. You have to eat food and drink water to live each day. to drink is not saying drink alcohol. To find joy in the work you do. If you are not happy in the work you do then you will be miserable. Basicalluy this is what life is about eat and drink to live and work to provide for your family.        *****Ecclesiastes 3:19 "For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast: for all is vanity.  3:20 All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again.  3:21 Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth?"*****    All things created die. Are physical bodies stop working and we both our physical bodies go back to the dust of the earth they came from. Man has no advantage over the beast as far as our physical body goes. Both our bodies die and both our bodies return to the earth they came from. Its not equating man as being a beast as science is trying to say. Because our soul goes uo up to God where as the soul of the animal returns to the earth because it is not eternal. Man's soul is eternal.        New Testament    Luke 6:37 "Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven"  Judge not with your own judgment people.  This does not mean telling people they are sinners. god commands us to tell every one they are sinners and need salvation in Jesus. It also does not mean we are to approve of people living a sinful life style.      Romans 1:21-22,25 "Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened. Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools...Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshiped and served the creature more than the Creator..."   The wicked deny God and confess they are smarter then God. They worship the beast instead of the creator such as evolution does today. Denies God and claims we evolved from animals.        Romans 12:18 "If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men."  as much as is possible try to live in peace with all men. Some times this is not possible because men hate it when you tell them they need salvation because of sin.    Romans 14:5 "Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind."  you left off the first part of this verse  some men honor one day over another,(  the sabbath) another honors all the same, ( every day for the christian we honor God), let every man be persuaded or convinced in his own mind was is correct for him.      1 Thessalonians 5:21 "Prove all things; hold fast that which is good."  prove all things of teachings about God. Hold fast to those that are good      1Timothy 1:4 "Never give heed to fables or endless genealogies"  do not believe fables or genealogies, (I am saved because I am a jew, a common teaching in Paul's day)     Titus 1:14 "Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth."  Not listening to untruths and commandments of the Law that turn people from the truth of God.      James 1:27 "Pure religion is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world."  Visit the orphan and help the widows the weak among you, and to keep your self as a christian from giving in to Sin.      James 2:19 "Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble."  You say there is a God you do good satan and his minions believe there is a God also and tremble at his power and greatness.        1 Peter 4:15 "But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as an evildoer, or as a busybody in other men's matters."    you forgot this verse which goes with verse 15    1Pe 4:14  If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye; for the Spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you: on their part he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified.     if you are oppressed for the cause of jesus you should be happy for the holy spirit of God and God him self abides in you. One the oppressers part God is considered evil, on your part God is glorified.    Let no christian suffer as a murderer or a theif or a evil doer. No christian should be doing these things and suffer the penalty. Nor should a christian be a busy body which causes trouble and interfers with other peoples business.    This is not saying to not reprove sin and instruct people in the Holiness of God. It is not saying we are to leave the lost alone and not seek to bring them the gospel of salvation.|`|eO2rnf7yaa	First of all,  anyone serious about this ought to try studying the matter within the context of the whole Book.  It was not written as a bunch of stray single verses.   Your quote of Ecclesiastes 3:21 "Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth?"*****"   clearly refers to man's spirit "going upwards" upon death.  Ecclesiastes states that what is the same is that all creatures die.  That's what's not different - we and all other creatures die.  Ecclesiastes clearly expresses this as a question - maybe we and our dogs all end up in heaven.  The "Who Knoweth" part is also a caution against judging others.    To the question, "Who knows where another's spirit will go?", the answer is, "No human knows this."  Only God may judge and knows.  As for your quote of  Ecclesiastes 2:24 "There is nothing better for a man, than that he should eat and drink, and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour",  I think that means we should enjoy our daily lives and do good things in our daily labors.|`|7HKTDcvYaa	If you look through the earlier parts of the Bible, the concept of heaven and hell are not the basis of inducement to do good.    Rather it is "That your days may be long in the land"  or that your offspring may grow and multiply and fill up the earth.    It was likely after the captivity that the extra inducement of heaven and hell were added. It may be that this thinking came in with the pharsee, whereas the saducee stayed with the original thinking of Judaism and did not anticipate these extra inducements.|`|KhJwOurLaa	Christianity contradicts everyone of those verses and quite frankly appears to be antichrist.|`|lJUyhMceaa	Ecc 1:1  The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.   Ecc 1:2  Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all is vanity.   Ecc 1:3  What profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the sun?     Notice the phrase "under the sun" at the end of the first three verses?  The Preacher is giving an example of how the natural, ungodly person looks at things.  He is not speaking of "spiritual" things.  When you get to the end of the Book, He concludes it all up and adds the "spiritual" view to it.    Ecc 12:13  Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man.   Ecc 12:14  For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.       In regards to the other verses, I really didn't see anything contradictory in them.  You may need to be more specific.|`|mLYFbStGaa	Ecclesiastes is a book of musings by King Solomon.  Basically saying that THIS life is vanity.  However, this does not speak to the issue of eternal life.    Luke 6:37 Basic christianity.    Romans 1: Modern America which believes there is no God and foolishly believe the universe was the result of an explosion, and random, unguided mutations.  Foolishness.    Romans 12:  Live peacefully with every one; i.e. live and let live.  The motto of America past.  America present is more live our way or go to prison.    Romans 14 is speaking of disputable matters within Christianity, such as eating meat, observing the sabbath.  Let everyone be fully persuaded that they are doing the right thing, and don't judge those who do differently.    1 Thessalonians 5  Test what you believe.  Change what is bad, hold fast what is good.    Timothy 1:4, Titus 1:14  Follow God's commandments, rather than man's ommandments.  There are several old sayings here in America believed to be bibical which in fact are not.  For instance:  Money is the root of all evil.  Actual verse: The LOVE of money is the root of ALL KINDS of evil.    James 1:27  In other words, having compassion is truly being a Christian.    James 2:19  In other words, the demons are also believers.  But they hate and reject God's authority, and do not repent.  This is tricky because you can get confused that simple faith in Christ won't save you, which the Bible explicitly states will.  However if you know God exists, but resist Him, and have no love for Him, you are not a believer in the sense that you put your trust in Christ for the attonement of your sins.    1 Peter 4:15:  Pretty self-explanatory.    No contradiction.  Take the bible as a whole, read it and start putting the puzzle together with God's help.  And He will help you if you sincerely want to understand.      Where it conflicts with actual Christians is just our human condition.  We all sin, Christians included, and we don't stop the day we get saved, nor do we ever stop until we die.  That's our nature.|`|8IHfytEvaa	You need to learn to read the Bible in context.    What is the context of Ecclesiastes?    Once you learn that you will see that you should not get any of your theology from that book.|`|6ZI1hx99aa	as a christian I admit this. Modern Christianity is going away from JESUS. World is influencing Christians a lot.|`|fwcuE37baa	In response to the Ecclesiastes verse:    The typical belief is that those who died in the Old Testament did *not* go to heaven. When Jesus died, we are told he broke open the gates of Hades; He let those who had been in Hades out. In other words, all men *did* go to the same place before Christ. There was no heaven and hell.     The afterlife of those before Christ is another one of those highly debated matters. No one can really say for sure.|`|73n1SExgaa	The book of Ecclesiastes is a book of mans vanities. He is talking without knowledge of God life is nothing. at the end it tells what mans duty is and it is to glorify God and It says in Ecclesiastes 12:13, 14 Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter. Fear God and keep His commandments For this is man's all. For God will bring every work unto judgment including every secret thing whether good or bad. When it talks of going to the dust he is talking about our bodies. beast and man goes to the same place. Its the soul or spirit   that goes to heaven or hell. no Contradiction. The spirit goes upward and the beast goes down. beast or animals have no soul. All the other  scriptures are self explanatory. Maybe you don't see many people living as those scripture say but are you? Christians are not perfect but forgiven. God is never finished with us until we get to heaven. The scriptures are for instruction so we may know how to live but we can never keep all the ways we are human. Maybe you ought to change your company and hang out with some christians that really love God. and remember all people that say they are christian may not be. only God knows.

isll2Uqnaa	experiencing God keeps my faith strong. long, beautiful prayers, church. and youre wrong. many things prove to us that He is God. the Holy Spirit, prophecies, miracles, creation, testimonies, etc. ive seen people who many pastors gave up hope on change in a few seconds of being in the presence of God. i have seen demon possessed people become freed by prayer.   God gives a chance for everybody to repent. EVERYBODY will hear the Gospel before their death..God knocks on every heart. if you ignore Him, He has no choice but to leave.     "And this good news of the kingdom will be given through all the world for a witness to all nations; and then the end will come." Matthew 24:14    the end will come after everyone hears the Word.

God HAS THE ABILITY to do anything, including making everyone love Him and go to Heaven. But what joy is in that? He wants people to come to Him of their own choosing, not by any force or manipulation. Everyone has the choice to love Him, believe in Him, follow Him, and go to Heaven. People just choose not to, and that is what sends them to Hell. As for the people who've never heard of Him...sometimes that one bothers me too. But I have heard (I really don't know if it's Scripture or if it's just something I've heard) that everyone will have the opportunity to know about Jesus/God and to choose to love Him, believe in Him, follow Him, and go to Heaven.

Even to communist countries. And that takes love, to risk their life just to share the true Jesus to all the nations.    For me, it's better to share your faith to your loved ones first.

There are a lot more chapters and verses mentioned in the below website along with music, speeches and praise and worship.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    Jesus is God. He is alive forever.    The questions usually asked are:-    1) Did Jesus really exist?  2) Is Jesus God?  3) If Jesus is God, then why did He keep praying to the Father in Heaven? How can the Father and Jesus be one God? Why did Jesus have to suffer on the Cross?  4) What is the Holy Spirit?  5) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?      It would not be possible to give a short answer to these questions .    I suggest you visit the below website.    After visiting the below website, you would get a lot of answers.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus  specifically.)  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became  flesh (John 1:1-14)  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as  "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT  (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)  16. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6) and "God" also be called the  Mighty God in Isaiah 10:21  17. Jesus is able to raise Himself from the dead (John 2:19-21)  18. Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things  by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship  is used in each place.)  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts  7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father  that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John  8:58.  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see  Exodus 3:14.  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).  26. Jesus is the One who will judge you on judgement day (John 5:22-23). Only God can be the judge.  27. Jesus forgives sins (Luke 5:20) (Luke 24:47,Acts 10:43) .Only God can forgive sins.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com

I remember times when things were really heavy, and I thought; "I'm not reading the Bible", and I sat there with a gun on the table, and I read anyhow, at the end I would read some psalms, and realize, repent, and just feel myself being assured, and forgiven, and I cried, for joy.  That God is awesome and caring God, and I slept so peacefully..  Ofcourse I am not as bad as I once was, but I will never forget. Because many times, it was truly a miracle.  Hey, best wishes to you.  I've witnessed an angel before too, and I'll tell you it was the most beautiful mesmerizing  thing ever. Since then I've never doubted God, and I felt guilty for doing so.    it sounds outrageous but it's true.  Anyhow the Atheists will dog me I know, but I don't care.  I'd love to tell you about the experience some time.  Again, take care my friend.|`|4fTiCNiKaa	Thank you for asking. It would be my honor to share my testimony...    It was during a Sunday night service. I was not raised in a Pentecostal church, so some of the ways that they worshipped (hands lifted, exuberant praise, speaking in tongues, ect) were a little strange. Yet in spite of being unfamiliar and ignorant of how these folks worshiped, it was the message that the evangelist preached that night that made it unforgettable. He preached a message titled "Look, and Live!" It was not real deep theologically, but it was defiantly ordained of God. It was a message of salvation and repentance to the lost (of which I was at that time). At the conclusion of his message, he gave an invitation for those who were not Christians to come forward and receive Christ by faith. At first I did not respond. But the Holy Spirit so dealt with my soul that I found myself walking forward and kneeling at a bench near the platform. It was there I cried out to God for mercy and forgiveness. That night Christ came into my heart, I repented of my sin's, and made a full commitment my life to Him. Yes, that was the most unforgettable experience I've ever had walking into a Pentecostal church. That night changed my life, and I've never been the same since. Am I perfect, and is everything a "bed of roses"? No. But every day I find that God loves me, in spite of my faults.     My second most the most uplifting experience I have ever had happened twenty five years ago this coming August. You see, I was raised in a church that taught that tongues, and the things of the Spirit had passed away. And that anyone who did speak in tongues was "of the devil". This past indoctrination hindered me from receive the baptism/infilling of the Holy Spirit for a couple of months. But praise God for His mercy! The Lord had help me get rid of all that "religious junk" so that I could be filled. And two months after my conversion, during a Sunday night service, while singing in the back row of the church choir, God gloriously baptized me with the Holy Ghost with the initial physical evidence of speaking in other tongues! I was so thrilled and happy that I ran out of the service, and around the building three times before I really realized where I was. And though I am not where I want to be in the Lord, and I am not to the place God has planed for me yet, I have not stopped shouting and praising Him for all that He has done for me!    God bless!

SzqCD0G0aa	So one arrogant moron spoke up against your writings, and you blame every atheist?  You were miserable before you were a believer, and now that you are, you think we ALL must be miserable?    Since you were so quick to place all of us in your shoes when you were a non-believer and in this morons shoes, I will give you some response in kind.    "So instead of screwing up people joy just because you dont believe in God or his word."  Since you have held me personally responsible (based on the manner which you have posed your question), I will say "Sure I will" when YOU show more respect towards those who believe differently than you, and when YOU respect other for their life and who they love.    "Stop and think of what you are doing to those who do believe and are getting something positive from it."  Stop and think of what you are doing to those that wish to go about their lives without hassle, who just want a chance to live.    Your threat of voilence would have only played to the morons ego, there was no joy cast when you threatened him with violence indicating that you would happily make him beg for life, I don't see any joy or peace being cast there.    It is unfortunate that you feel the need to lash out at every atheist in the world for the act of ONE, but it is fortunate that this issue is purely yours.  I am not responsible for the acts of another unless they are my family, I would however have stood up FOR you in the class regardless of this idiots words.    I doubt I would have got the same regard from you had it been the other way around.|`|q9PVawNyaa	Some atheists are a**holes. I am an atheist but I have many Christian friends and at the end of the day I tell them that if faith and religion have a positive effect on their life then it is real to them. What is real to one person doesn't have to be real to someone else. Whether God exists or not is not the important issue, the important one is whether the belief in a God is a positive influence on the person. I will only ever argue with a Christian if their belief is causing them to be disrespectful to others.|`|nw0fqXj9aa	If you don't want the results of the placebo side of the trial, don't sign up for the testing.

When I was an atheist, I was far happier. hat doesn't make me run around telling Christians that they shouldn't believe in their faith.     I get Christians who try to steal all my joy all the time. They'll find out I'm a pagan and start lecturing on Satan and hell and when i try to discuss it rationally with them, they get angry.     It's not just atheists who have to tear people down.

That being said, I don't judge every Christian by what one (or even the majority) does. I would appreciate it if you didn't judge me by what some sarcastic fellow student said about a book.    I have absolutely no problem with people being religious. I do, however, have a problem with people hurting other people and using religion as an excuse (i.e. threats such as "I promise you, when I am done beating the crap out of you, you will be begging for a god to save your butt."). If trying to stop that comes across as trying to steal someones joy, that's you're problem, not mine.|`|olgdyKzEaa	An atheist has never taken the joy out of my life or my faith. Some people can be a little irritating, but I still have joy. And most importantly, I still have faith. I'm not saying this to discredit your feelings at all. I can fully respect that each individual is different, and your reactions will not be the same as mine. But, what I would encourage you to do is to find a way for you to deal with perceived attacks in a way that does not deflate your joy. Some people will never change. You'll always encounter a certain type of atheist (I'm not saying they're ALL like that)... so it would be worth it to invest a little of your time into finding out how to deal with certain personality types in a more productive manner.

VRl1jENHaa	The court upheld a Christian school's right to refuse enrollment to people who do not follow their moral guidelines.  Courts have also made similar decisions involving the Boy Scouts and a woman who was fired from her job as a secretary at a Christian school who had become pregnant outside of wedlock.    While I'm a Christian, I do have a problem with this.  If a Christian school seeks to exclude all who sin, then virtually no one should enter.  Are there inquiries as to whether or not someone is divorced and remarried (this is adultery)?  Are there inquiries as to whether or not a person is even a believer (most Christian schools don't even inquire)?  I just think that perhaps some Christian schools may be overlooking some sins and concentrating on others -- which is unfair and discriminatory.|`|evStsOQiaa	If it is fair in God's eyes it is fair. Give to Caesar what is Caesar's and give to God what is God's. Private schools give to God.|`|OZAxA6J5aa	As far as I am concerned, private schools can do whatever they want. These are schools that were formed by individuals who wanted something specific for their kids. So if they want a completely straight or completely white or completely Jewish learning community, that's their right.|`|LGvwl67waa	It's another proof that U.S.A has gone wacko! (as if we didn't knew it already...)    ...Does the judgment say they can kick out alleged black people too?|`|yN3fWUCuaa	Private schools can exclude a specific gender, can they not?  Or is that particular exclusion acceptable?|`|4d16b72ffa495ae128ab9f89679fc203aa	Yes, private schools may discriminate all they wish, since they are not funded by public funds.  Similarly, private clubs can and do discriminate in many ways.|`|M6VcuiyDaa	It's not right but it's fair. Private schools can do what they want, as long as they don't take so much a penny in public funding.|`|7kR5dBTlaa	Morally no it isn't. As far as business goes, yeah. They are a privately funded institution and can indeed do this. That doesn't mean it's right though. I think it's disgusting.|`|jX6qoxaJaa	It's not fair... but they have the right to do it as of now. There are laws that say you can't prevent hiring someone due to their sexuality... but there's no law that specifically states that private institutions aren't allowed to keep out GLBT students.|`|FjiRPKp2aa	Because it is a private religious school yes they can do that for conduct that does not meet the moral standards of their beliefs. The beliefs are a good part of what all of the parents who have children agreed to and pay for with no government monies or assistance.Which probably amounts to thousands of their own money just for the education of the kids.|`|7cLYgf2raa	It is a PRIVATE school.No one is stopping a GLBT school from opening.Welcome to freedom of choice.|`|zYAQrnjcaa	It's a private school therefore it's their choice. The sad truth is that some parents don't want their kids around GLBT people. If it were a public school it would be unconstitutional.|`|jOwH96wKaa	It's not fair, but it's within the rights of the private school. Seeing as how they're not funded by state dollars, they can exclude whoever they want.|`|1WisnX8naa	That's why they are private...    I don't think it's right, but they can do what they feel is right as a private organization.    In my estimation, it's just one example of how religion seperates people, and does not brings them togeather...|`|6938f354823450032243cd5ddb6f0ef0aa	Is it morally right? No.    Is it fair? Yes.     I went to Christian school, and yes, it wasn;'t the best experience in my life, but because public school was not an option any longer, I had no choice but to conform and hide myself as much as possible.    If someone really desperately needs to get out of public school, they'll do the same.|`|QoenvlFuaa	It's a private Christian school, of course it will find offense in homosexuality. And since it is a private organization, it can accept/reject who ever it wants (the article even mentions the state law that says this).|`|lfjTRFzFaa	Private Schools without Queers.    That will never happen!|`|QqxZzvbAaa	it's a private school,I guess they can accept who ever they want.  as far as the girls living in sin as someone said here.  we are all sinners,and I would be willing to bet not all of those kids live a sin free life.  but like I said it is right because this is a private Christian school.|`|K24JFTOcaa	yes|`|3NWRAKksaa	Unfortunately, it is right.    The main word here is "Private" as far as the school.  Just as the religious agenda can not be "pushed on" people in a Government setting (because it is against the 'law' that governs their domain), the agenda that the GLBT students would have can not be "pushed on" people in a Private setting - for the exact same reason - it violates a 'law' that governs their 'domain'.     As with any agendas, dogmas, tenants, or pretty much anything, no one likes to have anything pushed upon them.    What i would love to see, is more of an open dialogue in the community to help these kids instead of looking down on them.  They are God's children as well.  No need to make them feel like freaks and to isolate them.     And, by the way....what's to stop the parents of these kids of starting up their own school...and being exclusionary themselves? or, better yet? show the world who's better....include EVERYONE :o)|`|AA11884807	Nope.|`|P544Sbmqaa	I DONT agree with it, but private schools have been given free reign to discriminate about which students they accpet or dont for a very long time.  This is far from the only thing they discriminate against, and so long as they dont receive any sort of public funding, I guess that is their right.  The only way equal rights for lgbt is going to work is if we dont force it on people who dont want to be around it, so...|`|LJ6vHfgoaa	>>Is this fair? Is this right?    If you believe in freedom of religion, yes.|`|Z0Vds9oCaa	WHAT!?!    I'm appalled at this!    That is just not right.|`|3GAiVmEAaa	I think its dumb, but since they are a private school they can set their own rules.    If this was a public school then it would be different.|`|JpgLxU1Laa	what a shame|`|0vmQNf0oaa	Yes. Why should a Christian school that requires students to live right have to accept someone who is openly sinning?    Did you notice the words CHRISTIAN high school in the story? The Bible is quite clear that gay sex is sin.    "The whole purpose of sending one's child to a religious school is to ensure that he or she learns even secular subjects within a religious framework," the court wrote.|`|847ab32dc15c849d022c11323ad7db39aa	No, not at all! That's discrimination!|`|Iva8drdfaa	Well, while I disagree with they are doing (the schools).  They are private schools, and therefore have the RIGHT to DENY ANYONE, for WHATEVER reason.      It is not fair, and it is not Right.  But it is legal.|`|kHv0CuaMaa	Of course it is not fair and it definitely is not right.   Oh the bigotry of religion. Just love it, don't cha?|`|AA10556726	Is it fair, perhaps.  Private organizations can control their membership which is generally a reasonable thing.    Is it right?  No, but in order to maintain separation, its probably a necessary evil.

xHfl4yzSaa	Shouldn't this also be posted in Pregnancy? They really like the "I'm 2 months late, could I be pregnant?" questions.      ....or Polls & Surveys? lol|`|EPFLsEAVaa	(Isaiah 7:14)  Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign: behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.    This was not prophesied for the 'catholics'. It was prophesied to the hebrews, concerning the Messiah, the Son of God, a jew from the tribe of Judah. In the relationship we have with God Almighty, He recognizes "gentiles" now (non jewish people), as "Israelites" and has "grafted" them into the chosen people, as a 'tree'.    The hymen should be ruptured BEFORE childbirth, during intercourse. That IS the reason why it is something no man can do, a miracle that can not be repeated.     What is more difficult to do? A virginal conception or the creation of a human being? For you to know that God IS God, He has done it both.    Jesus was asked why was He pardoning sins from a man that could not walk. He asked the same question. "What is more difficult? To say your sin is forgiven or to say get your bed and walk? So you can see that the Son of God has authority to do both, I say to you take your bead and go, your sin is forgiven".|`|M3Xmqlt8aa	LMAO!|`|E71jweytaa	riding on a horse breaks the hymen, please don't confuse us with muslims, she was a virgin as she had no sexual intercourse|`|NaM4ZT64aa	There's also the little fact that she had four sons after Yeshuah (usually called Jesus).|`|ebxwADDcaa	its a story, its open to interpretation. we are supposed to believe that she was concieved by God though.|`|7J1D1IyRaa	I agree with Unrated.

And, yes, Taylor Swift has naturally curly hair, because I read an interview with her, and she said that her hair was always curly and that when she was in middle school all the cool kids had straight hair, so she tried to straighten it and it didn't work out so well.    So Dear L, am I not pure European?  Because I have brown hair and brown eyes, and my mom's a genealogist and she's gone back to the Revolutionary War era, and all she's found is that I'm a Euromutt, so if I had any black ancestry prior to that, I'm pretty sure it would be like 1/64 or something and wouldn't even register.|`|CpUJI8adaa	TOTALLY not true , they have straight and curly hair.|`|0hsh000waa	No I don't think that's true, every race has diversity.

X8LNbaKQaa	Religion does not hate the birth canal.  Male dominated religions hate the birth canal and the people surrounding them.  Before men realized that they had any contribution to the birth of babies except for feeding pregnant women, religions were mostly animistic or goddess based.  Sex was a happy social exercise controlled mostly by women, just like everything was, and birth was a miracle between the woman and her favorite goddess.      But people started farming and controlling the opportunities for their animals to mate and then the cat was out of the bag, so to speak.    In a short time, goddesses were replaced by gods and men came to think of women as their property and producers of their children who were also their property.      Things have been rough for women ever since.  They still have not recovered the power they had as a gender, before men understood reproduction.    --   Regards,    John Popelish|`|d529cebfe13576f3ddee3e55b4cd08ffaa	God just doesn't think women should even get the fun part.

If I tell you Who Created God, then you would say Who created the one who created God and it would go on and on.  We know God is real, since we are real. If you deny God, then you have to deny your own existence, which is impossible. No matter how knowledgable or intelligent you are, you cannot deny that there has to be a supernatural force that has created our planet and our body and, that creator is God.      In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"    The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.    There are a lot more chapters and verses mentioned in the below website along with music, speeches and praise and worship.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    Jesus is God. He is alive forever.    The questions usually asked are:-    1) Did Jesus really exist?  2) Is Jesus God?  3) If Jesus is God, then why did He keep praying to the Father in Heaven? How can the Father and Jesus be one God? Why did Jesus have to suffer on the Cross?  4) What is the Holy Spirit?  5) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?      It would not be possible to give a short answer to these questions .    I suggest you visit the below website.    After visiting the below website, you would get a lot of answers.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus  specifically.)  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became  flesh (John 1:1-14)  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as  "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT  (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)  16. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6) and "God" also be called the  Mighty God in Isaiah 10:21  17. Jesus is able to raise Himself from the dead (John 2:19-21)  18. Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things  by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship  is used in each place.)  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts  7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father  that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John  8:58.  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see  Exodus 3:14.  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).  26. Jesus is the One who will judge you on judgement day (John 5:22-23). Only God can be the judge.  27. Jesus forgives sins (Luke 5:20) (Luke 24:47,Acts 10:43) .Only God can forgive sins.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com|`|Z0Vds9oCaa	I was a Christian and I DID feel the Holy Spirit (supposedly).

His grace makes up the difference.  by perfect, i mean live according to His Word.

SU8z0TUoaa	This is (or used to be) called "chasing the dragon" and is a way to get off on heroin, crack, and meth without shooting up. I guess some pills can be done this way, but it was probably not a pill, but a pill-shaped rock of crack or meth.  Yes, you use a lighter under the foil, and this produces a vapor which you inhale through a straw, or any kind of tube.  It sounds like you are interested in trying it. What kind of drug are you going to put on the foil? Have you smoked anything before?    Good luck!|`|l1ctIW7eaa	the video they showed was probably a re-enactment...not the exact way it's done    also, a pill might still burn, just not produce all that much smoke since it's a bunch of chemicals
GoRFRY2naa	I teach ESL and I know how hard it is to learn English.  There are several good options.  First, I would recommend that he consider taking ESL  classes at the local adult school.  There is nothing quite as good as learning a language from a live person.<br>  <br>  If he wants to invest a couple hundred dollars, there is a very good computer program called The Rosetta Stone, which has interactive computer learning, going from basic vocabulary to more complicated grammar, writing, reading, and comprehension.<br>  <br>  <br>  For a much cheaper suggestion, there are 2 books called Ingles Para Latinos, Primer Nivel (the beginner's book) and Segunda Nivel (the next level) and the second book can be obtained with CDs.  <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ingles-Latinos-Spanish-William-Harvey/dp/0764119907" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Ingles-Latinos-Spa...</a><br>  <br>  This is a link to the first book , and if you scroll down you will see the second book there too.  These books and CDs have been absolutely wonderful, with basic grammar, useful vocabulary, and the books actually write out how to pronounce the words in English, so even if he doesn't have the CDs, he can learn pronunciation.<br>  <br>  I recommend these books very highly.<br>  <br>  I wish your friend the best of luck learning English!<br>  <br>  Regards,<br>  Lady Morgana|`|iMULlxdgaa	they have that program Ingles Sin Barreras or you could try Ingles en espanol.  The Ingles en Espanol  is the one that is a little interesting and I think less expensive,  it takes English words but spells them in Spanish so a spanish speaker can pronounce them correctly.  English is pretty hard to pronounce so this makes sense.  Spanish is soooo much easier to read because its so phonetic.  Or try a local library or something because some places offer free ESL classes (English as a Second Langauge)
ZbZnIcoIaa	High school education.    IQ is one 136. No, not a dinky internet quiz IQ, I was tested at age 12.    GPA is 2. something, I don't know at the moment.    I am an artist.    Grades are no measure of intelligence. I am an extremely intelligent person I am just lazy as all hell. I hardly ever score below 80% on tests.    I live in NYC, how much more street sensible can you get than that?    Emotionally, I am an idiot.|`|9aeHyMFuaa	No.    IQ=72 i was tested one month ago.

That is a terrible thing to read but it doesn't bother me.  You know, I am a Christian and I read the Bible (of course) but I understand what you are saying.  I think it is all a matter of perspective.  Your perspective is that the Bible is stupid and silly.  Just ignore it.  Why does it upset you so?  You most likely feel it is all fiction, right?  If this is so, then you should not be bothered by some silly old fictional book, right?  Well then maybe it could be you think there is some truth to that stupid book and maybe that bothers you.

Now, I am the one preaching to my sister and reminding her of Gods word.  You feel dirty because of the lifestyle that you live.  God is awesome.  What if all this time you have been doing what you want instead of what God wants and you don't believe in Him or want anything to do with Him and you are wrong, you will have eternal damnation and seperation from Him.  But, if you believe in the Lord and love Him and do His will and you are wrong, you would have lost nothing....take a chance on the Lord.  You have nothing to lose and I guarantee you there is no more permanant happiness than the happiness and joy that comes from the Lord.  I was there, take it from me.

AA12048147	Umm, no stumping here my friend... If you know anything about what you are spouting off about you would know 2 important things that have been shown 1. we DO all have a common link.... and that link has been clearly shown to go back to one woman in the African area... not sure of all the details, but do some research on your own, your the one bringing all this up !!! 2. this study has also shown that the population did in fact nearly die off at one point in time... it narrowed down..... again, do your own research !!!!! .....now, as far as incest and all, no one has ever denied that fact, we can not... Now, again there is the fact that the human race was a more pure race, no sickness, this or that, so ...... and no one has ever denied, or if they have they need to rethink their own position, that brother MAY have had children with their own sister or what ever.... happens even today, kin marry kin, etc..... and yes it is frowned upon, no need, there are plenty of other fish in the sea, and there are other reasons , such as birth defects, which MUST have been unheard of in the beginning.... and sense there were no sickness, etc., having children and them living a full life was the normal , people lived and had children into ripe old ages.... we are kinda limited today, women more so than men.... just a little fact there...... and yes you are right, the Bible does not say one way or the other about *other* humans being created outside the garden, BUT one thing is for sure, it does NOT say there was not .... Now, about people getting from one place to another back in the day... did you know that the lands were closer together and that some were even joined together ?? Guess not..... Even I know that my friend.... rofl... and did you know that ships, large and small , of all sizes, some dating thousands of years have been found ?? guess not !! again, even I know that.... and did you know that people of the *old days* could do and be a LOT more than some scienctist give them credit for ? guess not !! and once again, even I know that !!! I suggest young one, that you researach... study and really look into history BEFORE you spout off these kinds of things and challenges.....and as for the recording of things ...... rofl...... just maybe all those people who did all that travelling did not have a nefty note book on hand to write everything down..... or just maybe, like history shows, those people did not even know how to write  !!! rofl........ keep trying little one.... Keep searching....... go in peace..... God bless|`|2BBKHggeaa	Think of a cat.    When you have two black cats, do they always have black kittens.    However, when you isolate a cat because of a trait you want, and keep breeding it,  you eventually have a litter with the type you want. Like Persian, or Ragdoll, or Burmese...etc..    In the genes of our first parents were placed  every conceivable combination  of humans.    When humans isolated themselves,or went their own way and started populating in separate groups.  They developed distinct features.      That's why is sweden you get alot of blonde and blue eyes.    In Africa you get a lot of blacks curly hair and dark brown eyes.    In Asia you get staight black hair and slanted eyes.    Just like a cat is still a cat....We are all humans from the same original parents.|`|e1ooFewFaa	Because it says later in the Bible that God changed the rules of pre-marital sex and incest, but in the baeginning Adam and Eve did have many children who had many childre who had many children.|`|isll2Uqnaa	God created Eve for Adam...He created him a WIFE....just because there was no actual wedding, they were still married in the sight of God. that stumped me, all right.

T3Tpgz5Vaa	The social/cultural background really influences this phenomena. Some people don't contact the authorities because,    1) don't trust authority    2) Pride (defending yourself)    3) Bravado    4) physical retribution, vs time in a prison or no time at all    5) They themselves are on the wrong side of the law|`|BN4Gkjvcaa	Well, no one wants to look like a wimp.

I have a pink dress shirt and I must admit I was reluctant at first to try it on. But once I did, I thought I looked really good in it, so I bought it.

TVJsOEKNaa	This answer will be a bit long, but it's worth it (promise).<br>  <br>  There was actually quite the paradigm shift during the Middle Ages in regards to how religion was perceived and viewed.  <br>  <br>  Humanism began to take hold during this time, so there was a greater emphasis on personal achievement and self actualization. People started to become concerned with the broader areas of life (individualism) as a result.<br>  <br>  Religion was seen as less formalized and more personal.  People felt religion was something that should be incorporated into their personal lives and felt the Church was straying away from the principles of the faiths they practiced. <br>  <br>  People during this time also began to show an immense interest in the past and revived many ancient philosophies.  It was a time where group thinking, value of humanity and not indulging were taken into account.<br>  <br>  Pico believed that humans were capable of changing the world they lived in and was against intolerance towards others. Erasmus was against any form of radical thinking period.<br>  <br>  Martin Luther became well known because he felt that a simple life devoid of partying was hypocritical in accordance with how the Church handled things (this is where Protestantism started after his excommunication). Then we had the beginning of the Renaissance and the breakdown of Church authority.<br>  <br>  The spirit of inquiry was looked at in a new light:<br>  <br>  1) Exploration: Marco Polo (Asia/China), Columbus finds the "new world" -- People began exploring different regions during this time.<br>  <br>  2) Press: Guttenberg invents the printing press: Communication and publications became much more widespread as a result.<br>  <br>  3) Martin Luther challenges Catholicism<br>  <br>  4) People questioned their place and the nature of the universe.<br>  <br>  Ptolemy and Copernicus bring up two opposing theories:<br>  <br>  Ptolemy: Earth is the center of everything<br>  <br>  Copernicus: Came up with the heliocentric theory -- planets revolve around the sun (and this contradicts the church)<br>  <br>  Newton came around with the laws of universal gravitation, Bacon came around with inductive/deductive logic and Descartes is famed with the quote "cogito ergo sum" -- <br>  "I think, therefore I am".  <br>  <br>  Descarte believed that things were dualistic in nature and that the mind had a consciousness. <br>  <br>  As you can see -- this paradigm shift influenced many positive trains of thought; however, there were negative aspects to (which others have already listed I believe).<br>  <br>  Wyld was referring to Hippocrates 'theory of Humors' (he was the founder of modern medicine).  He felt that the relationship between the physical was caused from the emotional. <br>  <br>  Galen's four humors were phlegm (phlegmatic temperament and sluggish/unemotional characteristics), blood (sanguine temperaments and cheerful characteristics), yellow bile (choleric temperaments and a quick-tempered or fiery characteristics) and black bile (a melancholic temperament suggested sad characteristics).<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!|`|DTog0VZWaa	To AlexV's answer, add Ferdinand's inquisition to Jews.  Jews were often educated & leaders of thought in the community.  As they moved north & east to get the "hell out of there", the center of culture in Europe moved too.

For the most part, the bearers of the first tidings of the gospel must have been ordinary, humble people – civil servants, businessmen, soldiers, and slaves. <br>  <br>  By the time the Catholic Church obtained its freedom, in the fourth century, Christianity was deeply rooted in many parts of the near east, such as Syria, Asia Minor and Armenia; and in the west, in Rome and its surrounding area and in Latin Africa. The gospel also had a considerable presence in the Nile valley and in various parts of Italy, Spain, and Gaul.|`|23231776e7c020d24631cf0d25927fccaa	They were influenced in so many ways where to begin and what faith,<br>  <br>  Ok I will start with Christians. In the Western Middle ages the Catholic Church was demoninent until people like Martin Luther began to question things and splits began to emerge such as Protestants, Jesuits, Quakers, Puritans and more. <br>  <br>  The Puritans were heavily influential with control and fear as did the Catholics in Spain with the inquisition. <br>  <br>  Medicine was based on not science but on four types of body vile. Unexplained things were often the work of God which later proved by science not to be so but only with small things that did not ruin the Faiths. As time moved on Astrology was replaced with Astronomy.  Drs in the middle ages had to have a degree in theology and Astrononmy.<br>  <br>  It has influenced in both positve and negative ways and this is just the West Christians not even talking about other faiths!!|`|9XgtXTExaa	Well, they were practically ruled by religion!<br>  There were religious wars EVERYWHERE, starting with the crusade, right through to King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella of Spain driving the Moors out of Spain in 1492.<br>  The Pope was the most powerful man in Europe in those times, so i guess you could discuss that.<br>  You could also mention that the first printed book was the Bible.<br>  Witch hunts in England especially!<br>  <br>  Hope I've given you some ideas, good luck with that essay!|`|vuKD7je1aa	My history professor said that religion was the only thing that got people through this terrible time period...their beliefs and whatever were supposed to keep them strong--like their faith.

Just like today.<br>  <br>  <br>  In the middle of the fourteenth century a devastating andemic of plague, commonly known in European history as the Black Death, swept through the entire Mediterranean world. This cataclysmic event caused a dramatic demographic decline in Muslim and Christian countries and provoked definable communal responses.<br>  <br>  The Christians blamed the non-Christians for the Plague so they went all over Europe burning people at the stake.<br>  <br>  <br>  The most commonly held opinion about the ultimate cause of the plague pandemic was religious: the European Christian viewed the Black Death as an overwhelming punishment from God for his sins and those of his fellow Christians. Despite the other interpretations of the disease, this view is the only one that satisfactorily explains the extraordinary forms of communal behavior that took place in many parts of Europe during the Black Death. This supernatural solution was propagated by the Church and is reflected in contemporary European art and literature. The chronicles of the fourteenth century almost always attribute the affliction to divine retribution for the wickedness of European society. Langland summarizes the common view succinctly: “These pestilences were for pure sin.”’-’<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/class/history13/Readings/MichaelDol.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.stanford.edu/class/history13/...</a>|`|g4AAZRuxaa	I know one fear.

It's an epistemological position about whether we can really know, not an ontological position about divine existence and belief thereof.  You either believe or you don't.  Whether you think we can ever know for sure or not is an entirely separate question.    People who use the term correctly get no grief.  Idiots who think it's a cool or socially acceptable (but logically impossible) third option between the two sides of  a binary condition like belief deserve all the ridicule they get.

vnEdfxeVaa	Allah (swt) almost always  used the word  dislike not the word hate .    Dislike or hate is not a negative emotion if it was put in the right place , it is a necessity  to prevent evil from having victory and since God is the one responsible for us then he has to express his strong disapproval of evil by saying he hates or he dislikes .    The emotions  God expressed in the Quran was either like or dislike , pleased or angry .   All these emotions are just a sign of of approval or disapproval with  no effect whatsoever on God Himself  (because He is not a human) but it only has its consequences or effect on us .       What was the feelings of Buddha towards those who wanted to kill him ?  The answer is not hate but surely dislike and strong disapproval and  that's the same with God .If  Buddha's  emotion towards evil is neutral  then it means he was abnormal and senseless man which he wasn't .|`|4T9fZzITaa	with out Love how will we know hate? with out bad how will we know good? with out it how would we know the difference.. that is how we truly know the difference  one cannot really exist with out the other like light and dark  Hatred is not a good thing but its not a bad thing mostly not bad if its for the right reasons.  what do you mean how come a human is free of hatred & but God isn't? that is not true .. humans are not free of hatred. you know, God is forgiving. if someone hated God, God would not hate him but feel sad  and as for Buddha he was able to release all the negative. i admit Buddha is tight|`|3306acbb7100c0f39897a04c473a7708aa	knowledge claim|`|EZC5iD45aa	Because Buddha was a great philosopher and "god" is a nonexistent fairy tale created to control the masses.

If a God has all the same emotions as humans, what makes the God greater than us? Can you imagine getting to Heaven and God throwing a tantrum that you got some of the cloud dirty because you were wearing a large pair of boots that stained the road made of gold?!|`|XnQWpUZMaa	Simply because Buddha is enlightened -- freed from greed, anger and ignorance. In fact, not just Buddha himself  don't feel hatred, all his great saint Arahants and Bodhisattvas don't feel hatred either -- a characteristic that is seen only in enlightened beings. That is not because of 'didn't care' attitude -- it is a undeniable fact that Buddha spent all his remaining life (45-year) after enlightenment walking and teaching in Nepal, India, Sri Lanka e.t.c. No other teachers/prophets in any other religions had ever cover such a great distance/area before.    All unenlightened beings feel hatred -- due to greed, anger and ignorance, including human and heavenly beings.    Love and hell existence for non-believers in other mono-theists religions  are self-contradicting. The example of parent's love for children to explain God's love simply highlights the contradiction -- which parents in this world would punish his children to prison (hell), regardless of how rebellious the children are?|`|RRJFI9Oqaa	Hate is the opposite of directed love.  If the love is directionless, there is no opposite.  Love in Buddhism is directionless.|`|Nu6HaIfgaa	Hatred is not necessarily a bad thing.    For example, it's healthy to hate the act of molesting children. It defines your moral stand, and you make a choice.     And Buddha was very passive even about desires. The goal is not to desire anything as well. So don't just look at it one sided.     I think hatred can be healthy when it's towards the right things. And don't forget that God is the most forgiving being in all the world. He sent His only Son so that we can share in His joy, peace, wealth, wisdom, glory, etc. And He requires us to forgive as well.|`|VnT2wz2laa	Buddha was not the Sovereign and eternal God  Buddha was not holy  Buddha was not himself free of sin  Buddha had little understanding of sin  Buddha did not lay down his life for the ungodly  Buddha is dead|`|FGJV10tFaa	God know every thing and Buddha is Buddha|`|fRcmDyxMaa	God's hatred is not against his creation it is against the creation's actions... When God hates our actions it is because those actions are against Him... A parent would hate it if their teenage son refused to obey their commands... staying out all night drinking and driving... because they love him and want to protect him..But they cannot force him per se because he would refuse his parent's... he would resist them and hate their actions...God is perfect has has not sinned... he cannot hate something he loves... it is impossible for Him... As for the evidence that you have presented for Buddah... i think he just didn't care... I think anyone who is not passionate in wrong doings, or right doings has no feeling....By the way They actually did kill Jesus/God and he didn't hate those people... He forgave them...If that's not love i don't know what is... Good luck in your quest...|`|ORbFRn4oaa	I am NOT a Budhist.     However, I feel that it is IMPOSSIBLE for any human being to be without the natural feelings of hatred etc. Also, there are things that cannot coexist in the same place i.e. fire and water, love and hatred, mercy and oppression etc.    God cannot be unjust or cannot possibly favor evil. Had it been so, then the Universe would not hold. The oppressors would ruin the whole system. The order in the Universe and the turning upside down of the might in the world is an indication that God is just. The postulate can be wrong if we assume that our time span of observation is too small compared to the changing moods of God (if it is so). But then the order in the Universe has been so long i.e. billions of years.     Therefore, if there is a God (and indeed there is), then the God is JUST. And an Impartial and Justice exhibiting God would CERTAINLY hate oppression and injustice. As the two cannot coexist.|`|bZTJYsoLaa	Buddha is not God, Is a teaching(philosophy) for mankind. Religion is too sensitive to discuss. People that believe in their God always think that God create this beautiful world. To me, God will one day destroy this world. Go back to history book, see how many wars were created and millions have died all because of this so call GOD. Until today, the killing still continue. Guess which great religions I am talking about.|`|P49Ie95xaa	For Buddhists there are lots of  god. And they are just another living being. Even we can be reincarnated in the next life as a god if we do lot of good. And god can be reincarnated as humans and animals too. We all are living beings traveling from one life to another suffering for those bad things we do. But Buddha is enlightened, he has conquered desire, hatred etc through great effort. We can also become enlightened by following the eight fold path. So you see god hates because he is not enlightened.|`|HdmlZdyHaa	There is more than one buddha according to my language arts teacher|`|EXgoY42saa	Talk of God comprises profoundly poetic discourse.

( per Nixon ) and in like manner a God gets to define that if he does it it is not a sin. He makes the rules so no matter how sinful it would be for us to do it, it is ok for God.    Like, do as I say, not as I do.|`|sziO5hK7aa	Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able? Then he is not omnipotent. Is he able, but not willing? Then he is malevolent. Is he both able and willing?

Maybe you could explain Einstein's theory of relativity without going to school or studying it either. You see how foolish your question sounds now.|`|PmG0Isnnaa	Job's family was not innocent.  They were born and lived in sin just like everyone else, and they deserved to die.  God is just and has the authority to punish evildoers, but he is also merciful and can forgive those who repent.       It is a sin for us to murder anyone unless God gives us the authority, as in cases of self defense, or as an instrument of the government in carrying out lawful punishment of evildoers.      God does have "special standing".  He is the author and giver of life, and has the power to end it any time he chooses.|`|ORbFRn4oaa	Our Knowledge is TOOOOOO!!! low and less to judge God and give a verdict based upon our own judgment. First God is TOOO high to be judged by us.    Also theologically speaking, from the perspective of Muslims, God does certain things that may apparently look bad. But in the long run they are for the benefit and good. Ref. The teacher with whom Moses walked (in the Quran). All the incidences of this narration CLEARLY tell us that God is kind and merciful to the believers. He takes care of them. His scheming is powerful and far fetching.     Now God also says so i.e. He does NOT advocate sin.    What people will incur on the day of Judgment would be a product of their own deeds. Also this is WHAT has been agreed by all of us. God had forewarned us. But we insisted on it.    Thus God is NOT the one who wrong our souls. We ourselves wrong it.    God clearly tells us in the Quran that "There shall be NO injustice".    ------  @Edit:  Regarding Job (Ayub), the incident in the Koran is NOT clear. And I would trust the Koran rather than Old Testament.    However to really confirm your statement, the teacher with whom Moses walked, killed a boy (out of the will of God). This is one thing that does indicate a confirmation of your idea.     However one should ALSO bear in mind:    Life and death may mean a lot to us, BUT not to God. After all He will resurrect us. Also God did it to do good to the boy's believing parents. "ALSO", the Koran states that God has granted a grace period of 40 years to EVERY human and Jinn. Thus if the boy was killed before 40, he actually was saved.    We have been given tooooo less knowledge. And we better not be judgmental about God. We cannot possibly encompass Him through His given intelligence / knowledge.    The above may sound a bit of closing the mind. However let me put the way I think:    1-  First we need to be certain if there is a God or NOT. My answer to the question is "Yes" Absolutely there is a God.     2-  The second important thing to find out is :  Has this God sent a message or NOT. Has he just created all this for just fun and left it to flow and go on as it would. I personally think the the answer is "No" !!!. There must be a precise purpose for all this creation. It is NOT left on its own.     And if we are correct in that conclusion, then I guess we are NOT mistaken to assume that God must have sent some sign or messages for guidance.    3-  If points 1&2 are correct, then our best effort should be to reach that message. And I also believe that the message should be OBVIOUS. It should be easily concluded through "Observations of life". Anything that goes Strongly against the obvious observations, cannot be the message "OR" we are misunderstanding it.|`|vnEdfxeVaa	If we say God kills the innocent it means that God is unjust which He is not . There MUST be a good reason for any killing Allah permits .     I don't know about the killing of the family of Job because it is not mentioned in the Quran , if it was mentioned  in the Quran  Allah would have explained why same like in the story of  khidr who killed a child ,  Moses  strongly disapproved such a killing Al Khidr explained to him that there was mercy and wisdom behind all the actions of God although it might sometimes appear to be cruel and unmerciful .|`|4T9fZzITaa	both   we have those ten commandments and i havent ever heard of him breaking any one of em.   you should pick up a bible and just check it out.|`|jdKOejikaa	It's ok to destroy you're own playtoys|`|uaIUBYTcaa	Gods not real so he cannot sin|`|HALNhYyzaa	Real quick you might want to check what you wrote.

God also promised them Eternal life in the Afterlife  and because job kept worshiping he too was granted eternal life in heaven|`|GlckO8Hbaa	Well sin is evil, God is truth.  God did not kill Job's Family, Satan did. God gave Job a trial and he was able to come throughit because of his relationship with God.  God can not sin for He is Truth.  Truth and sin cannot exist together.  Light will always be light and eexpelsdarkness.  Darkness can never exclude light.  There is not excused action, this is Truth.|`|6ZlzATFJaa	God is supreme.  He cannot sin because of   His sovereign nature.  He makes the rules that man must live by (The 10 Commandments).  Sin is disobedience to God's law; therefore He righteously and justly punishes sin both physically and spiritually (Holy Scripture says [1]"The wages of sin is death").  His people the children of Jacob (renamed Israel) were punished for sin many times from The Exodus through the Diaspora and many perished.  As for Job: God did not kill Job's children however he did allow Satan to do evil to Job, including .causing the death of his children and the loss of his wealth.  This was a test of Job's loyalty and trust in the Lord, a test he passed rather well in the face of the "good" advice given him by his wife and friends.

Even so, Jesus is the only begotten Son of the Father.      Matthew 5:45 That you may be the children of your Father who is in heaven, who maketh his sun to rise upon the good, and bad, and raineth upon the just and the unjust.    46 For if you love them that love you, what reward shall you have? do not even the publicans this? 47 And if you salute your brethren only, what do you more? do not also the heathens this? 48 Be you therefore perfect, as also your heavenly Father is perfect.|`|2BBKHggeaa	Matt 5:9    Happy are the peaceable, since they will be called sons of God.

lQGwzBoJaa	hahahahahahahahahahahahaha|`|hQDapmICaa	the answer is quite simple. There is a law in Israel that if someone claims to be God or claim to be equal to God, they should be stoned to death. And Jesus forbade them because the time for HIS death was not at hand.    Joh 19:7  The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.|`|6lJuKKMHaa	Your 'intent' is always prior to the content.

The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.    There are a lot more chapters and verses mentioned in the below website along with music, speeches and praise and worship.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    Jesus is God. He is alive forever.    The questions usually asked are:-    1) Did Jesus really exist?  2) Is Jesus God?  3) If Jesus is God, then why did He keep praying to the Father in Heaven? How can the Father and Jesus be one God? Why did Jesus have to suffer on the Cross?  4) What is the Holy Spirit?  5) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?      It would not be possible to give a short answer to these questions .    I suggest you visit the below website.    After visiting the below website, you would get a lot of answers.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus  specifically.)  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became  flesh (John 1:1-14)  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as  "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT  (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)  16.

Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship  is used in each place.)  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts  7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father  that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John  8:58.  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see  Exodus 3:14.  23.

And therefore, in the future, whose lineage/bloodline would bring about the birth of Jesus Christ, Almighty God's Only Begotten Son.

The Lord of this Universe Michael by name, came into Jesus and indwelled there for three years, then left upon the death of Jesus. This was what is know as a Sojourn. Michael our Universe Slovene Lord, had 7 sojourns all through out the universe. Earth was number 7. One of the sojourns was the indwelling into an Archangel. That Archangel was also named Michael. Therefore the correct name for archangel Michael is Archangel of Michael. Jesus in this verse was being questioned as to who's wife a women would be in heaven if the husband died, since the custom then was that when a man died, all that he had including his wife went to his brother and this women became his wife as well. Jesus said that in heaven there is no marriages, that we are all like the angels, like brothers and sisters, not husbands and wives. Be it know that when Michael the creator son of God came into Jesus, he had to be pure to be able to withstand the energy. The body of Jesus seen after the Resurrection was an ethereal body able to be seen and touched and able to disappear again. Not an Angelic body which is Spirit!  Rev.

lQGwzBoJaa	hahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha|`|w8D0ktFmaa	Fond of riddles, are yuh? Confusion begets confusion. Information may be objective (the World Wide Web exists), or subjective (the Qu'ran is truth). Take the information for whatever it is personally worth to you. Yes, now is your time, because it is the only time you will ever know for CERTAIN - anything beyond that is still a matter of belief and/or speculation, and still PERSONAL for each individual. Mercy? Under which law - secular or religious? That depends on the earthly powers that be, for as long as you live in the natural world. Again, what happens beyond that all depends on what you believe happens after your mortal death. Your truth is your truth.

Besides, stating that American Indians are descendants from the 12 tribes of Israel when cross-continent human migrations were not even taking place at that time is ridiculous.

Mormons believe and teach that if you get married in one of their temples and have more than one wife here, you might get promoted to be the god of your own planet one day and then you and your wives will continue to have sex forever creating "spirit babies" to populate your new planet.    This is taught in D&C 132 which also pronounced a curse on whoever changes the teaching about men having more than one wife.    http://scriptures.lds.org/dc/132    Jesus taught against this whole idea.    Jesus said in heaven we won't be married anymore:    http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?sea...    24"Teacher," they said, "Moses told us that if a man dies without having children, his brother must marry the widow and have children for him. 25Now there were seven brothers among us. The first one married and died, and since he had no children, he left his wife to his brother. 26The same thing happened to the second and third brother, right on down to the seventh. 27Finally, the woman died. 28Now then, at the resurrection, whose wife will she be of the seven, since all of them were married to her?"      29Jesus replied, "You are in error because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God. 30At the resurrection people will neither marry nor be given in marriage; they will be like the angels in heaven.    http://www.allaboutcults.org/what-do-mor...|`|AA10880624	Probably because people don't think for themselves or even intentionally say things about religions that aren't correct.

Another is rumors get started within the Mormon circle about 1 person's thoughts about the church.  As I grew up in the LDS church I heard numerous very comical and sometimes disturbing things that other people thought about the church and thought how could they be so misinformed. As I researched for myself I found about half of those comical and disturbing things actually have very factual bases. The others were just plain crazy. But think of it like this. If you went to University of Michigan and you heard some from The Ohio State say something like Michigan's engineering education sucks. But from Michigan you think you have a good engineering program you would think that Ohio state person is misinformed or being malicious.  And if you don't understand the Ohio State and Michigan references then just google the Ohio State and Michigan rivalry on google and you will get a plethora of information. And even though the Ohio State person may be right in saying such a thing. Michigan still takes offense to it.

We come along to the time of  Jesus, who did not contradict Abraham, and did not in any clear way say whether he should be considered a god. His followers, in dealing with Greek and Roman, found it necessary to use a doctrine that like the sons of the Greek and Roman top Gods, Jesus was a son of God, a real begotten son. That put him on a higher standing than just a prophet which Jesus did refer to himself as. But at the same time they had to invent a doctrine that would in some way be consistent with the teaching of Abraham. So, came the doctrine that Jesus is just a part of God. A holy spirit had been mentioned in the book, and this too had to be squared with the teaching of Abraham. so another part of God. This could be seen as legitimate since God was seen as a spirit, and was holy. Yet it brought Christianity back closer to the original Hindu thinking, which was that the aspects of God could be seen as persons within the single God.    The doctrine of trinity did become a major stumbling block to unity within Christianity.  People still had difficulty rationalizing what had been so clear in Hindu having become a point of Division with Abraham, then having reverted to the Hindu view within the Church.     This was of course compounded by the difficulty of producing a truly convincing statement from Jesus. Does an almighty God say I, who appear to be a man, am really The God, and then pray to himself?     Within Islam when it was expounded, Jesus was recognised as having spoken the words of God, but not being God, so that there was no need for a doctrine of trinity. Yet, like Hindu, Islam refers to God in terms of many attributes, so that it retains continuity with both Abraham and Hindu, and, is consistent with the views of a large part of ancient Christianity.|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	Father, Son, and the Holy Spirit - I have no idea|`|DDybzauSaa	God is like water.

Wiccans are eager to draw parallels between themselves and biblical Christianity for the sake of earning credibility, but what does the Bible have to say about this religion? You wont find the word wicca in the Bible, so lets evaluate the beliefs in light of what God says about them.    Wicca spells are idolism Romans 1:25 says, They exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshipped and served created things, rather than the Creator Who wants to settle for second best? In Isaiah 40, God paints a very cool picture of how much greater the Creator is than His creation. If you are worshipping anything besides the Creator, you are just spinning your wheels.    Wicca spells bring false hope  Hebrews 9:27 says, Man is destined to die once, after that, to face judgment. God says we get one chance at life, and that is it. There are no do-overs. If we dont accept Gods gift of Jesus in our lifetime, He judges us as unwilling to be in His presence, and we are sent to Hell.    Wicca spells bring disillusionment  Mark 7:8 says, You have let go of the commands of God and are holding on to the traditions of men. God is God, and we are not. We have a decision to make. Are we going to take God at His word and adopt His worldview, or not? Knowing God is hard work that takes a lot of discipline. Wicca is a religion that takes a pack of lies, ties it in a romantic ribbon, and searches out a well-intentioned, but lazy and gullible mark to sell its hollow doctrines.    Deuteronomy 18:10-12 says, Let no one be found among you who practices divination or sorcery, interprets omens, engages in witchcraft, or casts spellsAnyone who does these things is detestable to the LORD... Wicca witchcraft is a sin and God hates it. Why? Because it is an attempt to cut off our dependence on God and get answers apart from Him.    This is what sin is all about. Sin isnt just a heinous, socially disagreeable action. Sin is our decision to disagree with God on any topic  to rebel against Him. Sin is saying, God, I want to live my life MY WAY. Romans 3:23 says, For all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God. Romans 6:23 says, For the wages of sin is death This isnt bodily death, this is spiritual death: eternal separation from God and all the blessings that His presence brings. This is the definition of Hell: the absence of Gods presence. That is what our sin buys for us.    Thankfully, Romans 6:23 doesnt end there. It goes on to say, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord. God knew that we would all rebel in one way or another, and he provided a way for us to avoid that separation.|`|b7ae34ab971653d02308ce805affb7baaa	You can believe in Jesus Christ but you cannot be a traditional/orthodox Christian.  You certainly can view Jesus as a part of a long tradition of Man-God archetypes and a very powerful and valid expression of divinity but to follow the Bible strictly and literally;  you would not be able to worship a Goddess archetype due to Christianities strong patriarchal nature. Also you should not pay homage to any other God forms in a strict sense.   I suggest you read the book Pagan Christ by Tom Harpur.|`|3df06b65831ca89dcc296c573d4605b4aa	Yes.

While there are those who very sincerely believe that they are following both, they are not...  The fault rests on how one defines Christian.    If you define Christian as one who believes Christ existed, regardless of whether or not one believes in his teaching, it is possible that one could define oneself as a Wiccan Christian, but most Christians would say, quite rightly, that merely believing Christ EXISTED is NOT what makes a Christian.    Merriam Webster (m-w.com) defines a Christian as " one who professes belief in the teachings of Jesus Christ*"    It is possible to PROFESS belief in the teachings of Jesus Christ and be a Wiccan.    ..You'd also be a liar.    Because it is impossible to BELIEVE IN or AGREE WITH those teachings as a Wiccan.    One common teaching in Christianity that is used to define Christianity is the Nicene Creed. If we examine it, we can see it is ABSOLUTELY NOT COMPATIBLE WITH WICCA. Observe.    (My comments follow in brackets:)          The Nicene Creed:**  We believe in one God, [Wiccans are polytheists]  the Father, the Almighty,[Wicca does not teach omnipotence]  maker of heaven and earth,  of all that is, seen and unseen.  [Wicca does not support Creationism but instead teaches "as above, so below, which includes the idea that the Universe may be interpreted by observation of its parts]    We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,  the only Son of God,  eternally begotten of the Father,  God from God, Light from Light,  true God from true God,  begotten, not made,  of one Being with the Father.  [Wicca teaches that there are multiple gods, and that all people are children of gods. Wicca does not mention Jesus at all.]    Through him all things were made.  [Wicca teaches that humankind makes many things.]  For us and for our salvation  [Wicca has no concept of salvation]  he came down from heaven:  by the power of the Holy Spirit  [Wicca has no heaven, nor a Holy Spirit]  he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,  and was made man.  [Wicca teaches that humans are born human and gods are born gods. Transformation in one life from one species to another is not a part of Wicca.]  For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;  he suffered death and was buried.  [HUGE POINT! Wicca teaches that RESPONSIBILITY for all of a Wiccan's actions are upon that Wiccan, and must be taken care of by that Wiccan. Thus, in Wicca, it is impossible to die or suffer for someone ELSE except in very specific, personal situations (like taking a bullet for someone.) Wicca teaches there are no SINS, so there was literally no reason for Christ to die!]    On the third day he rose again  in accordance with the Scriptures;  [This is in no WICCAN Scripture]  he ascended into heaven  and is seated at the right hand of the Father.  [Wicca has no concept of who sits to what side of any father deity.]  He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,  and his kingdom will have no end. [Wicca has no teaching about a half-god judging living or dead, and, in fact, has teachings about who judges the dead...There is also no teaching of a Kingdom to Come in Wicca.]    We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,  who proceeds from the Father and the Son.  [And Wiccans don't]  With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.  [Which Wiccans don't do.]  He has spoken through the Prophets.  [Who are not Wiccan.]  We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.  [Which Wiccans do not.]  We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.  [Wiccans neither baptize nor sin.]  We look for the resurrection of the dead,  [Wiccans do not.]  and the life of the world to come.   [Wicca does not teach of a coming future world, but of NOW worlds.]    I am sure there are some who think they are Wiccan and Christian, but they aren't. Either you think Jesus died for your sins (Christianity) or you acknowledge the doctrine of Self-responsibility as a proper person or adult human (Wicca). They are mutually self-exclusive.     I actually feel sorry for those that do think they are one and the same because every one of them I have met confuses Wicca (Worship of the gods and living by their standards) with magic, and Christianity has a long and perfectly valid tradition of magic that existed BEFORE WICCA ever existed. Here are some books discussing it:  The Magical Writings of Thomas Vaughan:  http://www.amazon.com/Magical-Writings-T...    Greater Key of Solomon:  http://www.amazon.com/Greater-Key-Solomo...    Ancient Christian Magic:  http://www.amazon.com/Ancient-Christian-...    The Divine Synthesis and Realization of Magic by the Christian Revelation  http://www.amazon.com/Divine-Synthesis-R...

Now... if it is a condom that provides some type of vibration or electrically driven stimulation... you either don't need it to be a condom (a pocket pal instead) or she doesn't need the experience to have your flesh at the core (A pocket pal for her).    Now... for our president to promote this... Hooray and Boo!.  I mean, it will be fun and all.. but encouraging procreation in any form during this economic crisis (unless this is the start of a national prostitution program then YAY YAY YAY) would only make things worse if we increased the size of our population.  Yeah, he might be trying to encourage procreation with members in raincoats, but that would only be a percentage of the whole who participated fully.  There would still be a large percentage who would procreate on the wild side... taking advantage of the stimulation and not the contraceptive... meaning increase of population and increased demand on available resources.    Maybe though.. instead of a battery powered one... it might be a condom that has a micro-fine coating of the stuff Pop Rocks is made of... so you put it on and everything is good, but as soon as the condom gets wet, it begins to fizz.  Stimulation without electricity.

The USA is the most religious western country and most Christian country(80% claim to be Christian)which is amusing because it has the highest crime rates, one of the lowest education rates(for western countries)and has one of the highest poverty rates(for western countries again). Also look at its wars in recent history and its intolerance to certain groups and people(gay, abortion etc).     Then on the other hand you have Sweden the most atheist country(85%)and its the exact opposite. One of the best welfare systems, lowest crime rates, one of the highest educated nations in the world and is extremely tolerant(although Scandanavia does have some of the highest suicide rates which is attributed to climate/lack of light etc not religion before you start harping on). When did you last see the Swedes invading a country controversially?     What does that say about religion, morals and quality of life?    USA would be a better place with more, open atheists.    All of what I said above is factual and is supported by evidence from all over the place, it isn't atheist propaganda at all.

All my friends openly know my opinions on religion, or if they asked, I'd tell freely.  If my grandparents talked about it, I'd be so much more likely to avoid the subject and try not to talk about it, because I feel like they wouldn't accept it, or it would be misinterpreted as like a devil worshiper, but they are old and will presumably not be asking me these things and hope they will die peacefully without me feeling like I've ruined my relation with them.    I'd never lie if I was asked up front, but with the older people, I tend to be much less vocal about those things.|`|AxeYlYiVaa	my parents, my best friend, and one of my ex-girlfriends are the only ones that know that i am an atheist. methinks it will remain that way for awhile.|`|axiA5mMoaa	Do you mean out of the closet?|`|QCHcsVMxaa	Atheists aren't atheists just because they want to let people know and like heated debate, i think that much should be obvious.

I'm almost completely out.  There's only a couple family members on my closeted list, and that will be changing soon.  I've gotten tired of keeping it in, and they'll probably find out in the somewhat near future.  I won't be having a religious wedding, since my girlfriend is an atheist, as well.    There are large pockets where atheism is much more acceptable, you just have to find them.  Large cities usually make it easier.  It's tough for a lot of people in the U.S. especially when it comes to family life.      I've slowly come out to family members, as I became more comfortable opening up.  While they don't all like it, they still care about me and accept me.  I've taken the risk of being shunned, but it was worth it for me.  It's a call you have to make.  If the risk is too big, it's probably best to keep it to yourself.      I wish it wasn't this so hard to be accepted, throughout the country, but all we can do is try to change a few minds along the way.  The more people that knowingly meet atheists, and see we aren't all terrible, scary people, the more they will lose their fear of us.

84nXWNT3aa	You forgot the talking snake.|`|6lJuKKMHaa	Original sin would be "Pride".  (Lucifer fell because of it.)|`|6AT498UTaa	Original sin simply means the world inherited sin and death.. You are not judged for Adam's sin you have sin fo your own. Christ came to the world to overcome temptation sin and death for all who will accept the atonement.|`|3aVxJYf6aa	THE answer that the Bible gives to this question is very simple but clear and full of significance. To grasp its importance, though, we first need to see Jesus' life and death as a solution to a very difficult problem. Only then can we properly understand the enormous value of Jesus' death.    The original sin created a very critical problem for mankind. Adam began life as a perfect human. Therefore, his children could have enjoyed perfect everlasting life. However, Adam sinned before he fathered any children. The entire human race was still in his loins when he received the sentence: "In the sweat of your face you will eat bread until you return to the ground, for out of it you were taken. For dust you are and to dust you will return." (Genesis 3:19) So when Adam sinned and began to die as God said he would, all mankind was sentenced to death along with him.    "That is not fair," someone might say. "We did not choose to disobey GodAdam did. Why should we lose our prospect for everlasting life and happiness?" We know that if a court of law were to put a son in prison because his father had stolen a car, the son could rightly complain: "That is not just! I did not do anything wrong."Deuteronomy 24:16.|`|3Bc4FoLdaa	I started to answer your question last night, lots of explanations and such, then realized it just wasn't coming out right.  Today I re-read the question, and saw the irony in it.  The irony being, "if so then I'm not impressed".      That says a lot.  The "original" sin, more aptly should be named, the first sin.  See, it wasn't about Adam and Eve cursing the human race, or about a tree or an apple, it was about man being made with a will to choose between right and wrong.  Adam and Eve just happened to be the first humans to have that choice.      The entire Bible, starting from the beginning, shows us God's order, and his ultimate direction, Christ being born a man... being hung on a cross, taking on all of our sins so that we could be made perfect through Him, shedding his blood as the ultimate sacrifice, and rising from the dead to wait for us in Heaven.  He doesn't expect us to be "impressed", he expects us to realize that we can never be made perfect except though him.  He's not out to "impress" us, He wants us to see His love for us, and the ultimate gift He gave, himself dying on the cross so that we could live abundantly and freely.  You've seen the verse a million times, at football games and other events: John 3:16.  Read it with an open heart: "For God loved the world so much that he gave his one and only Son, so that everyone who believes in him will not perish but have eternal life."      The irony is, the first sin was committed by Lucifer, he wanted to be better than God, and worshiped above Him.  So, as someone else on here said, that was pride.  Your not being impressed is no different than the pride that caused his fall, refusing to acknowledge that you're a mere man, imperfect and sinful, and that until you give your heart and mind over to the only perfect one, Christ, you'll never be fulfilled or have eternal life in Heaven.|`|6Whz1p5Eaa	it doesn't say anything about an apple, fyi.

According to this  a) the genealogy of Joseph of Nazareth found in Luke is actually Mary's genealogy  b) for some inexplicable reason, when Luke wrote "the father of Joseph" what he *meant* was "the father of Mary"    The *reason* for this let's-say-Luke-was-lying doctrine is that Matthew gives an entirely different genealogy for Joseph, particularly Joseph's father.    Unfortunately, there is no need for any doctrine which claims that Luke is in error.  The quandary is explained quite reasonably and logically with the Mosaic Law concept of Levirate Marriage.  According to Mosaic Law, *if* Joseph were the first son of a man, AND his son by a levirate marriage wife, then he would quite literally be the son of two fathers (not biologically, of course, but both legally *and* conceptually under Mosaic Law).

They called to Lot, Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so that we can have sex with them. Lot went outside to meet them and shut the door behind him and said, No, my friends. Dont do this wicked thing. Look, I have two daughters who have never slept with a man. Let me bring them out to you, and you can do what you like with them. But dont do anything to these men, for they have come under the protection of my roof. Get out of our way, they replied. And they said, This fellow came here as an alien and now he wants to play the judge! Well treat you worse than them."    The traditional interpretation: Sodom was destroyed because of homosexuality.      The contextual interpretation: First, we must remember that God had already decided to destroy Sodom before this incident took place. Second, its not likely that the mob which gathered at Lot's house - every single man in the city - were all homosexuals. We also have to ask ourselves why Lot would try to distract them with his virgin daughters (a reprehensible act, indeed) if they were. So we cannot simply assume that they were motivated by homosexual desire. What this story most likely suggests is that the men of the city regarded these two strangers with suspicion - perhaps they thought they were spies who had been taken in by Lot, himself an outsider. They were determined to humiliate these strangers in the way common to that time and area, by "treating them like women," by brutally raping them. In much the same manner today, new inmates are introduced to prison hierarchy. Sodom's sins are enumerated in Ezekiel 16:49, Luke 10:12 and Jude 7 as inhospitality, greed, pride, haughtiness, refusal to help the poor, and unspecified sexual immorality. It is ironic that this story which condemns a city for its mistreatment of the poor, the stranger, is used to condemn another vulnerable group - homosexuals.    Leviticus 18:22, 20:13 "Do not lie with a man as one lies with a woman; that is detestableIf a man lies with a man as one lies with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable. They must be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads."    The traditional interpretation: Sex between two men is a sin punishable by death.    The contextual interpretation: This command to the former Israelite slaves seems quite straightforward. Yet we must remember that it was a command made specifically to the Israelite nation. Many of the other Levitical commands, including those about sexual sins, seem to be in the context of ensuring and emphasizing that the Israelites were to be different from the pagan idolaters, both those they had known in Egypt and those they would be living among in Palestine. Leviticus 18:3 says, "You must not do as they do in Egypt, where you used to live, and you must not do as they do in the land of Canaan, where I am bringing you. Do not follow their practices." Leviticus 19:19 forbids mating two different kinds of animals, planting a field with two different kinds of seeds and wearing clothing woven of two kinds of material. Leviticus 19:27 forbids men to cut the hair at the sides of their head or clip the edges of their beard. Leviticus 11-15 contains many laws and regulations concerning ceremonial uncleanness  laws which were broken by Jesus when he touched lepers, dead people, and the woman with a discharge of blood. The injunction against two men lying together immediately follows the command against sacrificing one's children to the heathen god, Molech. We can conclude that God did not want His people to practice the many perverted or detestable kinds of behavior common in the pagan nations around them which were often associated with lascivious temple fertility rites in which worshippers had sex with as many people as possible, regardless of their family relationship or sex. They believed this would bring blessings on their crops and livestock. No doubt these practices were what made idolatry such a temptation to the Israelites. As for the death penalty required for men who lie together, the same penalty was required for anyone who cursed his father or mother, for those who committed adultery, for a man who married his sister, etc. There is no indication that those involved in homosexual sex as part of their idol worship did so because of the kind of orientation we recognize today.

AA11297267	I don't "believe" anything.  I go by the evidence, and decide the probability of something being true or not based on the evidence for/against it.    With no contemporary mention of "jesus" of any kind from any of the extensive Roman records of the time, Jewish records, Greek records, etc.;  with no archeological evidence of any kind; with the clear incorrect facts, self-contradictions, and after-the-fact gospels being the only mention of this person....the evidence is very clear:  there isn't any credible evidence to support the idea that the "jesus" of the bible was ever real.    The most likely scenario is that the "jesus" of the bible is a composite of several jewish rebels who existed around 20BCE to 40 CE, whose stories were combined and then woven into a fable of mysticism and divinity to come up with the "jesus" of the bible.  That "composite" jesus has some evidence to back it up -- the regular old bible "jesus" doesn't.    Peace.|`|93r3nCM1aa	Yes. He could have existed, and he could have really preached a "gospel" and said he was the son of God and was crucified.    But that doesn't make it real.

After all, you can't get a specific answer without asking a specific question.|`|Vp1Wzu07aa	yes.|`|QOfNNRXhaa	I don't think the Jesus that is mentioned in the bible existed.|`|TMSNijj0aa	Nope,but I could be wrong. The evidence seems to point to his non existance.|`|fNw4wJSGaa	Yep I do.    Although there isn't a whole lot of evidence in his favor, I don't see a huge issue with that, considering he wasn't that well known while he lived. He wasn't anyone important at the time, so there probably wouldn't be much of a record of the man named Jesus.    It wasn't until after his death, and his followers influence that made him well known.|`|ULUpOqplaa	There are references to Jesus in Buddhist texts and Hindu texts and Mayan and Inca texts that that good christians didn't destroy.|`|401e0b603e98257a6483b0111f39f2c3aa	It's difficult to believe in the existence of anyone unless there are accurate historical accounts about what they did or I have met or seen the person firsthand. This brings into question what "accurate historical account" really means. We know that people like Isaac Newton and Abraham Lincoln existed because they had a profound effect on society that is well-documented. Jesus's effect on society isn't as accurately well-documented. This is mostly because, if he was real, he lived more than 2000 years ago, and the more recent history is, the better documented it is for the most part. In this situation I can't just give religious clerics the benefit of the doubt. How do I know that they know what they are talking about? It's hard for me to believe he, or anyone from that era, existed without any hard evidence.|`|4db07412ef2c09f8393cb86bf7e153deaa	You mean historically?  No.  I've researched the subject by reading a number of different books and websites, and have come to the conclusion that he's most likely just the literary combination of a few different real people (Rabbi Yehoshua, Apollonius of Tyana, etc.) and a few different mythological figures (Prometheus, Asia Minor deities, etc.).  And for the record, I don't consider the "Zeitgeist" movie to be a reliable source.    Of course, even if my research led me to conclude otherwise, I still wouldn't want to be a Christian, for numerous philosophical reasons.  But I digress.|`|K6QlFoo0aa	There is an interesting book by a scholar who had complete access to the Dead Sea Scrolls as well as various accounts written by Flavius between 60 and 80 A.D.    The title of the book is "The Roman Conspiracy to Invent Jesus".  The author is Joseph Atwill.  According to him there was a union of tribes of Jews who were descendants of the Maccabees.  Both of these groups were ferocious fighters.  They were constantly agitating and preparing for war against an already weakened Rome.  Flavius and company needed to have a pacifistic Jewish person whom others might emulate, but they knew that they would have to start a new religion.  Hence the "birth" of Jesus and Christianity.  According to his interpretations of these sources the Romans wrote the New Testament and thus created the start of Christianity.  He does offer a great deal of proof, but the proof is all based on his reading and interpreting these ancient documents which the rest of us will never see.    On the other hand Christians today think that they see images of Christ and Mary in soap scum on shower curtains and thousands of loonies come to see these "miracles".  Christianity is hopelessly illogical on its face, as virtually all of the other atheists have mentioned.    Proof of events of 2000+ years ago? - to quote Scrooge, "Bah Humbug".    I highly doubt that there was a person named Jesus.  I suspect that he is an amalgam of many people and the hopes and desires of some very primitive people.    However it is difficult to subscribe to Atwill's theory although it makes more sense than "rising from the grave".  More soap scum on a shower curtain.  If you want to see something badly enough you will.|`|9JBvXgTiaa	Do I believe that he once existed? Yes.|`|rIA2sPeqaa	No.|`|fMJj4zRRaa	I believe he existed.

Science discovers a world of magnificent order, a universe that contains distinctive marks of intelligent design. True religion makes these discoveries meaningful by teaching that the mind of the Creator lies behind the design manifest in the physical world.    "I find my appreciation of science is greatly enriched by religion," says Francis Collins, a molecular biologist. He continues: "When I discover something about the human genome, I experience a sense of awe at the mystery of life, and say to myself, 'Wow, only God knew before.' It is a profoundly beautiful and moving sensation, which helps me appreciate God and makes science even more rewarding for me."    What will help one to reconcile science and religion?    An Enduring Quest    Accept the limits: No end is in sight in our quest for answers about the infinite universe, space, and time. Biologist Lewis Thomas noted: "There will be no end to this process, being the insatiably curious species that we are, exploring, looking around and trying to understand things. We're not ever going to get it solved. I can't imagine any terminal point where everyone will breathe a sigh and will say, 'Now we understand the whole thing.' It's going to remain beyond us."    Similarly, when it comes to religious truth, the reach is boundless. One of the Bible writers, Paul, stated: "Now we see only puzzling reflections in a mirror . . . My knowledge now is partial."1 Corinthians 13:12, The New English Bible.    Partial knowledge concerning both scientific and religious questions, however, does not prevent us from reaching sound conclusions based on the facts we have. We don't need a detailed knowledge of the origin of the sun in order to be absolutely sure that it is going to rise tomorrow.    Let the known facts speak: In the quest for answers, we need to be guided by sound principles. Unless we stick to the highest standards of evidence, we can easily be misled in our search for scientific and religious truth. Realistically, none of us can begin to evaluate all scientific knowledge and ideas, which today fill huge libraries. On the other hand, the Bible provides a manageable compendium of spiritual teachings for our consideration. The Bible is well supported by known facts.*    However, concerning knowledge in general, earnest effort is required to distinguish between fact and speculation, between reality and deceptionin both science and religion. As the Bible writer Paul advised, we need to reject "the contradictions of the falsely called 'knowledge.'" (1 Timothy 6:20) To reconcile science and the Bible, we must let the facts speak for themselves, thereby avoiding conjecture and speculation, and examine how each fact supports and adds to the other.    For example, when we understand that the Bible uses the term "day" to represent various periods of time, we see that the account of the six creative days in Genesis need not conflict with the scientific conclusion that the age of the earth is about four and a half billion years. According to the Bible, the earth existed for an unstated period before the creative days began. (See the box "The Creative Days24 Hours Each?") Even if science corrects itself and suggests a different age for our planet, the statements made in the Bible still hold true. Instead of contradicting the Bible, science in this and many other cases actually provides us with voluminous supplemental information about the physical world, both present and past.    The Creative Days24 Hours Each?    Some fundamentalists claim that creationism rather than evolution explains pre-human history. They assert that all physical creation was produced in just six days of 24 hours each sometime between 6,000 and 10,000 years ago. But in doing so, they promote an unscriptural teaching that has caused many to ridicule the Bible.    Is a day in the Bible always literally 24 hours in length? Genesis 2:4 speaks of "the day that Jehovah God made earth and heaven." This one day encompasses all six of the creative days of Genesis chapter 1. According to Bible usage, a day is a measured period of time and can be a thousand years or many thousands of years. The Bible's creative days allow for thousands of years of time each. Further, the earth was already in existence before the creative days began. (Genesis 1:1) On this point, therefore, the Bible account is compatible with true science.2 Peter 3:8.    Commenting on claims that the creative days were only 24 literal hours in length, molecular biologist Francis Collins remarks: "Creationism has done more harm to serious notions of belief than anything in modern history."    Faith, not credulity: The Bible provides us with knowledge of God and his purposes that cannot be gleaned from any other source. Why should we trust it? The Bible itself invites us to test its accuracy. Consider its historical authenticity, its practicality, the candor of its writers, and its integrity. By investigating the accuracy of the Bible, including statements of a scientific nature and, even more convincingly, the unerring fulfillment of hundreds of prophecies throughout the ages and into our present day, one can acquire firm faith in it as the Word of God. Faith in the Bible is not credulity but a proven confidence in the accuracy of Scriptural statements.    Respect science; acknowledge belief: Jehovah's Witnesses invite open-minded people, both scientific and religious, to share in a sincere quest for truth in both realms. In their congregations the Witnesses nurture a healthy respect for science and its proven findings as well as a profound belief that religious truth can be found only in the Bible, which forthrightly and with abundant evidence declares itself to be the Wor|`|6Whz1p5Eaa	"Avoid certain books, turn off the TV, walk out of certain lectures..... especially if they start to get at all persuasive."

Although I believe that the Bible is a great book ( I am a christian too), the Bible is not usually on the list in those books.  Your syllabus should show you the reading objectives.    if you want to take a religious route, pick a literary piece in you text book where someone is religious or has a religious theme.    I think that will be the best way to go?  _________  By the way, what is the title of your course or class?|`|AA11709855	That verse made no sense.|`|xjcLiPqDaa	idk, i once read the Purpose Driven life by Rick Warren-- and it talked about the purpose of life being to glorify God, because we were created by him and for Him.

"Fear God and keep His commands" (12:13). God created man, because He had a purpose for us to accomplish. And He designed us so that, unless we fulfill that purpose, we have no real sense of accomplishment. Instead we create problems for ourselves.    Thats Ecclesiastes 12:13|`|2zgv89OQaa	Part of his mission has been that Jesus came to earth to act as a sacrificial lamb.   He paid the attonement of our sins.   He did come to save that which was lost but more importantly he came to die on the cross for our iniquities that we might have eternal life.   What a Savior!
IVy35SE2aa	Based on what I have read and seen demonstrated with hypnosis,  I think it is very unlikely that they could overcome that mind  conditioning and see reality.  This is the same principle that Hitler used to brainwash a nation  and a world.  It is the same as the commercials on TV that are  beamed out to us 16 minutes of every hour.  All of them tell us  that we are some how incomplete,  but their product will solve  our problem.  We have got the messages.  We do buy the product. If we are  aware of what is happening, there is a chance we can face reality.

I never believed in Jesus, until He revealed Himself to me. I was alone in my bathroom, and I asked with sincerity for Him to come into my heart and help me, and I was filled with the most wonderful intense feeling of love that I have ever felt, ever. it was the most beautiful and amazing thing I've ever experienced!   He has been a friend to me, and a compass in my life. I had anxiety, depression and drug and alcohol problems for years, but the minute I gave my heart to Jesus, He took those things away from me instantly! Every day in His precious love, I grow stronger! I grow more compassionate! I feel more alive, and grateful for every single day!   If He can do all that for me, then imagine the joy that He can bring you! Jesus is the answer to every question I've ever asked. :) He is my peace, my love, my strength, my joy and my comfort.

You're going about this process in the wrong way.     Talk to head figures in various religions. Read the outlines of the religions' beliefs and look at why they are they way they are. Research their histories. Where does the religion come from? Why might it be Truth? Read books. Look at what is reasonable and what makes sense.

God hates 'religions', and He will do away with all of them, because they are nothing but washed out tombs, white on the outside and full of corruption and all sort of abominable things.  If you do not believe me look at history: God rejected His chosen people for adulterous behavior, so much that He gave them away to "all the nations" so they would be stomp on by the nations "until the time of the gentiles" - in other words, until He decided to call them back to Him again. Later on when the 'church' of rome was in dominance, they "killed the prophets" and burned on the stake all dissidents. In Canada alone, in 1938 a ship full with refugees from Germany - persecuted jews - came from Hamburg via the Bahamas and requested asylum for all those people, only to be turned down and returned to Germany where they have come from to be burned in the gas chambers...all under the auspices of the anglican church, who peddled its influence in the highest places of the government for these people to be refused asylum.  As for the muslim faith, it is well known that sunis are killing shias and vice versa; not to mention the atrocities wahabis have commited against their own people...Bottom line: "religions" are a source of death, not life.  I am sure there are hundreds of more different cases in which 'religion' have had the same malefic influence.  What you need is to get to know God and His Son Jesus Christ who died for mankind and opened up the door to the resurrection and eternal life here on earth for all, not know "about" Him, that is what you've been doing. You do not choose Him, He chooses you. Pray and ask Him what is it He wants to do with you. He will answer, most certainly.

GkO45d7uaa	I took the AP German exam last year. I would find out what other students who are currently in AP German say about the class and if they've learned anything before making this decision.     There is a speaking part, so you will definitely need help with that. My teacher made us speak German during class the entire time. Everytime we said something in English, we would have to pay her a penny. We practiced actual speaking tests, so I would look those up if I were you. They were a lot easier to understand than when I took the actual test. My teacher thinks they might've used different dialects. Good luck on whichever road you choose!    Edit: That really sucks. Is there any possibility you could take it at another school? I know the schools in my area all took in certain programs and students from surrounding districts could attend those classes to receive credit.
AA11648578	No God did not change, God gave man the law which represents God's righteousness and God brings us to his righteousness through the atonement which he provides through his mercy.|`|IKyITYICaa	He probably regrets giving us free will because he sure expends a lot of energy and effort to try to get us to 'come correct'.|`|NaM4ZT64aa	No, they're just different gods.    The god of the Old Testament was just a typical tribal war god.  A commonly worshiped similar god is the one of Islam, Allah.  The god of Jesus, however, was based upon the God of Pythagoras and Plato.|`|Gf5nMPJXaa	There are at least four different versions of God in the OT alone.  Google J E P and D traditions for more info.  A massive giveaway is that they actually use different names for him in the original language.  Yahweh and El were both pre-existing deities - Edomite or Canaanite respectively.  Some of the older books of the Bible like Psalms even talk about Yahweh and his council of gods.    There are also several different versions in the NT - much of which is after the fact rationalizations of doctrinal disputes between Petrine and Pauline theologies.    God is definitively said to have being surprised, and to have changed his mind, in the Bible itself.  Kinda tricky for an omniscient being.|`|q5lreoiWaa	The way I was taught, the OT was all about God trying to reconcile his people to himself through the use of the law.  When that failed, he sent his son to die on the cross in atonement for our sins.  In so doing, a new covenant was formed. You answered your own question.|`|Gp160xHOaa	It is the same god.The OT speaks of History and reflects on the wonders that god can do in a mans life.He killed people because they went against his word.Just like he gives he can easily take it away.Therefore, in the NT it speaks of his love and gives us a way of life.It also talks about what is expected from us as humans and what is to come in the future.|`|AA11709855	Thus, to hell with OT.|`|a8kAassWaa	At the very heart of this question lies a fundamental misunderstanding of what both the Old and New Testaments reveal about the nature of God. Another way of expressing this same basic thought is when people say, The God of the Old Testament is a God of wrath while the God of the New Testament is a God of love. The fact that the Bible is Gods progressive revelation of Himself to us through historical events and through His relationship with people throughout history might contribute to peoples misconceptions about what God is like in the Old Testament as compared to the New Testament. However, when one reads both the Old and the New Testaments it becomes evident that God is not different from one Testament to another and that Gods wrath and His love are revealed in both Testaments.    For example, throughout the Old Testament, God is declared to be merciful and gracious, slow to anger and abundant in loving-kindness and truth (Exodus 34:6; Numbers 14:18; Deuteronomy 4:31; Nehemiah 9:17; Psalm 86:5; Psalm 86:15; Psalm 108:4; Psalm 145:8; Joel 2:13). Yet in the New Testament, Gods loving-kindness and mercy are manifested even more fully through the fact that God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life (John 3:16). Throughout the Old Testament, we also see God dealing with Israel much the same way a loving father deals with a child. When they willfully sinned against Him and began to worship idols, God would chastise them, yet each and every time He would deliver them once they had repented of their idolatry. This is much the same way that we see God dealing with Christians in the New Testament. For example, Hebrews 12:6 tells us that the Lord disciplines those he loves, and he punishes everyone he accepts as a son.    In a similar way, throughout the Old Testament we see Gods judgment and wrath poured out on unrepentant sinners. Likewise, in the New Testament, we see that the wrath of God is still being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of men who suppress the truth by their wickedness (Romans 1:18). Even with just a quick reading of the New Testament, it is evident that Jesus talks more about hell than He does about heaven. So, clearly, God is no different in the Old Testament than He is in the New Testament. God by His very nature is immutable (unchanging). While we might see one aspect of His nature revealed in certain passages of Scripture more than other aspects, He Himself does not change.    When one really begins to read and study the Bible, it becomes clear that God is the same in the Old Testament and the New Testament. Even though the Bible is really sixty-six individual books, written on two (or possibly three) continents, in three different languages, over a period of approximately 1500 years by more than 40 authors (who came from many walks of life), it remains one unified book from beginning to end without contradiction. In it we see how a loving, merciful, and just God deals with sinful men in all kinds of situations. Truly, the Bible is Gods love letter to mankind. Gods love for His creation, especially for mankind, is evident all through Scripture. Throughout the Bible we see God lovingly and mercifully calling people into a special relationship with Himself, not because they deserve it but because He is a gracious and merciful God, slow to anger and abundant in loving-kindness and truth. Yet we also see a holy and righteous God who is the Judge of all those who disobey His word and refuse to worship Him, instead turning to worship gods of their own creation, worshiping idols and other gods instead of worshiping the one and only true God (Romans 1).    Because of Gods righteous and holy character, all sinpast, present, and futuremust be judged. Yet God in His infinite love has provided a payment for sin and a way of reconciliation so that sinful man can escape His wrath. We see this wonderful truth in verses like 1 John 4:10: In this is love, not that we have loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins. In the Old Testament, God provided a sacrificial system whereby atonement could be made for sin, but this sacrificial system was only temporary and merely looked forward to the coming of Jesus Christ who would die on the cross to make a real substitutionary atonement for sin. The Savior that was promised in the Old Testament is more fully revealed in the New Testament, and the ultimate expression of Gods love, the sending of His son Jesus Christ, is revealed in all its glory. Both the Old and the New Testaments were given "to make us wise unto salvation" (2 Timothy 3:15). When we study them more closely, it really is evident that God is no different in the New Testament than He was in the Old Testament.|`|EZC5iD45aa	Look closer at the NT. Jeebus clearly says he did not come to bring peace. And that he speaks in parables to confuse people into hell. It's just as hateful, only more cleverly disguised as peaceful.

However, at this point in time we no longer live under law but under grace. This will end one day when Christ returns and sets up His kingdom. I had great difficulty understand God in the OT. until I started listen to a radio pastor who goes through the Bible and explains things that I had trouble understanding. Check out www.ttb.org for good Bible teaching.|`|KvwVBzb0aa	The ot was written to really get your attention and scare the bejezus out of people and they being fairly smart figured they would get a lot more money with honey than vinegar and wollah the NT was born.|`|6ZI1hx99aa	OT is LAW and PUNISHMENT. NT is the GRACE of GOD.      DONT DARE TO MOCK THE GRACE OF GOD|`|o6mP6yBAaa	Oh my friend, Yah has revealed somethin to u!  There is exactly two gods being spoken of. Finally someone who noticed and chose to call it out..ok Yahweh,god of israel,is our creator.Yes it seems like He does a lot of 'punishing' but its for a reason..the israelites are His chosen people He considers us His 'son'...and when it came to His set apart ones or anyone who clung to Him His laws and way of life, He went to battle for them just as we would do for our own child if someone was constantly doing things to them...and its israelites,not jews...have no idea where jews came from...In the new test,jesus is god..but jesus is not god,Yahweh is god,always has been always will be, but the introduced 'religion' of 'christianity' along with the new test, totally changes everything..because, it comes with a new god declaring new things,which is jesus...yes jc pushes u away from righteousness,which is being right in the eyes of Yah,away from war, he has u loving ur enemies,being stepped on,he changes what Yah says all types of stuff..Its a lot more can not be summed up here,but no Yah didnt change we changed.He is the same and He tells u in His word,the old test..which is very much valid,thats another thing,jc tells u its been done away with so u wont be a chosen one and u will be lead astray...He hasnt changed His mind,just look at the world around us,vengance is His..When u realize, oh ive been servin a false god,just as israel has been known to do, we are so stubborn and rebellious, and that Yahweh is god,god is Yahweh, it becomes more clear. Read the last chapter of Micah from the old test. Its right before the new and see what it tells u to remember, then flip the page, its the new, and Yahweh, israel, just seem to fade away in the new.The old is all about Israel and Yah but when u come to the new it basically is hardly no mention of us or our creator..flip through isaiah too, u will see capital LORD that is representing Yahs name.Put His name back into the ot script and u will clearly see who god is..Shalom

38vza5Gxaa	answer: actually the opposite.  There is nothing about Jesus in the Jewish Tanakh, no prophecy, no foreshadowing.  Jesus isn't considered a prophet either so he doesn't figure into Judaism.  Whether he was an observant Jew or not, its hard to say from writings that were written decades after the fact.|`|hR7OsqtRaa	In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"    The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.    There are a lot more chapters and verses mentioned in the below website along with music, speeches and praise and worship.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    Jesus is God. He is alive forever.    The questions usually asked are:-    1) Did Jesus really exist?  2) Is Jesus God?  3) If Jesus is God, then why did He keep praying to the Father in Heaven? How can the Father and Jesus be one God? Why did Jesus have to suffer on the Cross?  4) What is the Holy Spirit?  5) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?      It would not be possible to give a short answer to these questions .    I suggest you visit the below website.    After visiting the below website, you would get a lot of answers.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus  specifically.)  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became  flesh (John 1:1-14)  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as  "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT  (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)  16. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6) and "God" also be called the  Mighty God in Isaiah 10:21  17. Jesus is able to raise Himself from the dead (John 2:19-21)  18. Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things  by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship  is used in each place.)  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts  7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father  that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John  8:58.  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see  Exodus 3:14.  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).  26. Jesus is the One who will judge you on judgement day (John 5:22-23). Only God can be the judge.  27. Jesus forgives sins (Luke 5:20) (Luke 24:47,Acts 10:43) .Only God can forgive sins.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com|`|GMFXD1ENaa	Ruth nailed it. And we don't think that the idea of a trinity is an abuse of Jesus's identity, either, as we believe that God is One. For us, the concept of trinity is irrelevent.|`|AA10405801	Absolutely NOT!

For I AM the Lord your God, and the Holy One of Israel, your Saviour..      The Spirit of the Lord is upon me; because the Lord has anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prisons to them that are bound; To proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn; To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called the trees of righteousness, the planting of the Lord, that HE might be glorified...    Yes, God helps me daily...|`|7y6yfrQlaa	not that i'm aware of|`|vDcDnO7Yaa	Yes. In every way, every single day, one step at a time.|`|KvwVBzb0aa	Sure.

God's presence intervene to me once basically just to pat me on  the back to let me know He was happy with me....I would say that's doing, plus He was the one whom sent my special spirit guide to me the very day I prayed for help and protection:)|`|nMA66AJUaa	The moment we intend to help ourselves and others is the time God helps us.|`|a63qA8wzaa	it depends on your Definition of god|`|4xDDR7c3aa	nope, I dont believe in him!

(And sometimes some other nice people do, too.)|`|deqX4oQQaa	Yes They do!( Genesis 1:26-27; John 14:26; Matthew 28:18-20) John 15:5 say's I am the vine ye are the Branches he who abideth in me and I in him, the same beareth much fruit, for ye can do nothing without Me. When we pray in Faith, Hebrews 11:1&6 faith, 1 Thess. 5:17 say's pray without ceasing. Since They created us for fellowship with them and we are to pray in Jesus Name( the only perfect one) and He will answer our prayers as He ( Jesus the Son of the living God Almighty with the Holy Spirit) will answer your prayers in tyheir timing as for what's best for you. They know what's best for you since they created you! Sometimes Father Jehovah Elohim, will say no becauise they know what's best for us. They love us. God is love. Have a Blessed one!

The average person mentions evolution in conversation how often? Once a week? Once a month?<br>  <br>  It sounds as if some evangelist has gotten to him. While I hesitate to describe evangelicals as a 'cult', even the most tolerant among us have to admit that sometimes they come very close to that c-word. So I would recommend avoiding the subject whenever it comes up, but also making sure that he knows you love him and will always be there for him. Also, while it's not quite the time to panic yet, you may want to look up some anti-cult organizations. I've found the Cult Information Centre useful in the past.

You might say it's because it probably isn't real science. Well, all you have to do is take a look, and make your own decision. Here's a website to start with: www.creationworldview.org This is Dr. Grady McMurtry's website, a former atheist who decided to "take a look". Now he travels the nation trying to show others how a belief in creation is actually a scientific conclusion, and how evolution is not really based on science at all, but rather on speculation.|`|fA42bQHraa	The 6000 years ago thing is pretty extreme and there's a difference between being married to someone that has differing religious views and someone that has  differing religious views that are extremist.<br>  <br>  If this is it, do as others have said and agree to disagree.

Fpi8im9taa	Well, everyone automatically assumed I was a Christian. I'm not really open about my religion (which is certainly not Biblical Christianity), but people usually associate a nice person with being a Christian. How judgmental is that?    It's okay, I know what that's like. I've said that I voted no on Prop 102 in Arizona (Prop 8 equivalent), and I've been called gay. I've said that the fetus should get aborted if it's a headless parasite (and yes, there are cases of that), and I've been called a Satan and a baby-killer. I've said that atheists have morals, and I've been called unintelligent.     Why do I think it happened? Maybe people just LOVE to assume things.|`|	I've never had it happen to me.  I can't imagine someone accusing me that I was Religious!!  That would be funny!  :)    I wonder how they came up with the idea you were an Atheist.  I've seen your profile too, and it clearly states your beliefs.   Maybe they know something we don't.|`|	I'm a Deist so a lot of people consider me an atheist(idiots). I don't react I just look down on how uncultured they are|`|	Some Christians assume that if you say anything that contradicts their particular brand of Christianity you are an atheist. Its not worth arguing - even if you convinced them they would just replace the label "atheist" with "heretic" or "heathen".|`|	I've experienced just the opposite. As an atheist, I am frequently mistaken for a Christian. There have even been questions posed to the forum as to what it is I believe!!  :)    One of the questions stated that I have a tendency to show "theistic beliefs." That's absolutely correct. I was once a Christian, have retained a belief in souls, angels, the afterlife...     I understand their reasoning, and it would appear that I have confused nearly everyone.     I've read your profile. Your beliefs are clearly stated. Perhaps the person who wrote didn't take the time to read. Or, maybe they feel that you have "atheistic tendencies."    Don't be bothered by what others think. As long as you are happy in your own skin, everything will be fine.|`|	I used to be an Atheist, but since converting, I've never had that happen or at least not to my knowledge.|`|	no    everyone knows I am a Christian|`|	answer: I've had a variety of assumptions made about me, including being an atheist, which I'm not.  I usually blink and wonder what planet that person has been on lately.  Shrug it off, my friend.
PSkHc7h6aa	Yes GOD has been existent from the beginning and to forever eternal.       Rev 1:8 I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty.|`|ZUTfMc8vaa	yes as long as you are faithful to god you can survive in heaven|`|OZAxA6J5aa	God has always existed. I don't know how, you might as well ask how infinity is possible or how the galaxy can be so big.  Heaven is not going to be clouds and harps and singing for eternity. Seriously, where did people come up with that? I think heaven will be like earth, only perfect. And on earth, we all do stuff. We learn and work and suffer. Well, heaven will be minus the suffering...but I don't think we'll sit around lazing eternity away. Jesus said we will rule with Him, that implies action.|`|6Y3mW1a2aa	I don't plan on going to heaven (or any other imaginary place for that matter).|`|6lJuKKMHaa	Haven't you ever heard of the "Never Ending Story"??  (Neither eye has seen nor ear has heard nor entered into the hearts of man the things prepared for those who love Him!)|`|AA11489001	Our souls go to Heaven to live with God.    God has always been even before He created Earth for us, His children.  From the first book in the Bible~  Genesis 1  The Beginning    1 In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.    2 Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters.      3 And God said, "Let there be light," and there was light. 4 God saw that the light was good, and He separated the light from the darkness. 5 God called the light "day," and the darkness he called "night." And there was evening, and there was morningthe first day.      6 And God said, "Let there be an expanse between the waters to separate water from water." 7 So God made the expanse and separated the water under the expanse from the water above it. And it was so. 8 God called the expanse "sky." And there was evening, and there was morningthe second day.      9 And God said, "Let the water under the sky be gathered to one place, and let dry ground appear." And it was so. 10 God called the dry ground "land," and the gathered waters he called "seas." And God saw that it was good.      11 Then God said, "Let the land produce vegetation: seed-bearing plants and trees on the land that bear fruit with seed in it, according to their various kinds." And it was so. 12 The land produced vegetation: plants bearing seed according to their kinds and trees bearing fruit with seed in it according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good. 13 And there was evening, and there was morningthe third day.      14 And God said, "Let there be lights in the expanse of the sky to separate the day from the night, and let them serve as signs to mark seasons and days and years, 15 and let them be lights in the expanse of the sky to give light on the earth." And it was so. 16 God made two great lightsthe greater light to govern the day and the lesser light to govern the night. He also made the stars. 17 God set them in the expanse of the sky to give light on the earth, 18 to govern the day and the night, and to separate light from darkness. And God saw that it was good. 19 And there was evening, and there was morningthe fourth day.      20 And God said, "Let the water teem with living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the expanse of the sky." 21 So God created the great creatures of the sea and every living and moving thing with which the water teems, according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. 22 God blessed them and said, "Be fruitful and increase in number and fill the water in the seas, and let the birds increase on the earth." 23 And there was evening, and there was morningthe fifth day.      24 And God said, "Let the land produce living creatures according to their kinds: livestock, creatures that move along the ground, and wild animals, each according to its kind." And it was so. 25 God made the wild animals according to their kinds, the livestock according to their kinds, and all the creatures that move along the ground according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good.      26 Then God said, "Let us make man in our image, in our likeness, and let them rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air, over the livestock, over all the earth,  and over all the creatures that move along the ground."      27 So God created man in his own image,          in the image of God he created him;          male and female he created them.|`|8CL8o8K0aa	There seem to be some controversy about persons going to heaven.  This could be because individual reads a section of the bible out of context and ignore other sections of the bible.    If all righteous persons will go to heaven, and all wicked persons will go to hell, then it means that a some point or the other the earth would be empty.  In that case how would you explain "Genesis 8:21-22 (King James Version)     21And the LORD smelled a sweet savour; and the LORD said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake; for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing living, as I have done.    While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease."    Also how would you explain Matthew 5:3, 5 - "Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.  Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth."     Also Psalm 37:9, 11, 22 - "but those that wait upon the LORD, they shall inherit the earth."  "But the meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace."  "For such as be blessed of him shall inherit the earth;"    Yes while the bible speaks of righteous persons going to heaven, it also speaks of righteous persons staying on earth.  Why is this so?  This is because there is a special agreement which was prophetically played out in Israel.    God made a covenant with the house of Israel for a Kingdom at Exodus 19.  Verse 5 and 6 states,   "Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people: for all the earth is mine:"    "And ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation. These are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel."   "A kingdom of Priests" - royalty, rulership - a setting that was arranged among the nation of Israel, whereby there was the High Priest, (depicting Jesus) the other priests who were taken from the tribe of Levi (depicting selected righteous persons for the responsibility of priesthood) to serve in the temple (depicting heaven).  While the rest of Israel served in the courtyard (depicting earth).  Read through the entire chapters of Exodus 25 - 29.  This whole information is a prophetic history pointing to the heavenly settings whereby some persons would be selected to rule along with the Kingly priest Jesus Christ in heaven over other righteous persons on earth.  These persons that will be in heaven will be resurrected in the spirit form.  Spirits are able to survive in heaven.    As to God's beginning, he is referred to the alpha and the omega, the beginning and the end.  From everlasting to everlasting.|`|aZUszuqLaa	Heaven is where we go when we die.  Heaven is not eternal, because we go on to even better and greater things and never stop evolving.  I think heaven would be boring with all that perfection and nothing to do about it.  The fact is that our Soul's progression is endless, because God is endless and we are made in that likeness.|`|860c6e6cbb0a45ed8571556722c3f97aaa	God is eternal. Better than those who will be in Gehenna. Remember no physical body, we will be spiritual beings. We also are eternal beings sense God gave us life. The only thing we need to worry about is where we will spend eternity.|`|GeoiGjbCaa	No heaven. No hell.    No gods, ghosts or gremlins.
80841aafba2cedde2f2f011d05e695d2aa	Are you studying Latin? Cool!! Well, if so, it may help you to learn Spanish as it comes from Latin as you might know.    Well, declensions are to nouns and adjectives what conjugations are to verbs, that is, the way you modify the word (either noun or verb) to change the grammatical meaning. In Spanish, the nouns are declined by genre and number (though there are no cases, as in Latin).    In Latin there are 5 declensions (rosa/rosae; fluvium/fluvii; mons/montis; cornum/cornu; dies /diei, for example)    In Spanish, there is not such model but a simpler one, as there are no cases:    Declension by genre: Masculine and feminine. The main paradigm is to turn the ending -o or -e by -a.  El ni?o / La ni?a   (The boy/ the girl)  El monje / La monja  (The monk/ the nun)    Declension by number: Single and plural. You just have to add an -s or -es  El ni?o / Los ni?os (The boy / the boys)  El len / Los leones    As you can see, the article is also declined and so are the adjectives, which must agree in the number and genre:    Las flores bellas (feminine and plural= the beautiful flowers)  El automvil verde (masculine and single / The green car)    Note that there are adjectives and nouns whose declensions are the same for masculine and feminine    La puerta verde  El automovil verde    El chofer (the driver)  La chofer    El estudiante  La estudiante    And also a very few nouns whose declensions are the same in single and plural    El anlisis  Los anlisis    As in Spanish there are no cases, the grammatical function is determined mainly by the position in the sentence and by using prepositions:    Mater suo filio cibum providet  La madre da pan a su hijo  The mother gives bread to her son
YuLAYK4Iaa	I've included a link to my recipe below, & one to lemon sauce, which is a great way to serve bread pudding.  My pudding recipe calls for 1/3 c. sugar or Splenda; it really doesn't need much sweetening.  Happy cooking!|`|qWu5F1O2aa	It would but i wouldnt use artificial sweetners since they are chemical/powdered based. If you cant use sugar i'd use Stevia (in powder form) or Agave nectar. Since agave nectar is a complex carbohydrate, it will be processed slowly by your metabolism, hence you wont feel no sudden sugar spikes. Mind you, these sweetners are highly 'concentrated' so id use half of what a recipe would call for. This is a recipe for bread pudding<br>  <br>  <br>  INGREDIENTS <br>  6 slices day-old bread <br>  2 tablespoons butter, melted <br>  1/2 cup raisins (optional) <br>  4 eggs, beaten <br>  2 cups milk <br>  3/4 cup white sugar (OR 1/8c stevia or 1/6c agave nectar)<br>  1 teaspoon ground cinnamon <br>  1 teaspoon vanilla extract <br>  <br>  <br>  DIRECTIONS<br>  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). <br>  Break bread into small pieces into an 8 inch square baking pan. Drizzle melted butter or margarine over bread. If desired, sprinkle with raisins. <br>  In a medium mixing bowl, combine eggs, milk, sugar, cinnamon, and vanilla. Beat until well mixed. Pour over bread, and lightly push down with a fork until bread is covered and soaking up the egg mixture. <br>  Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes, or until the top springs back when lightly tapped. <br>  <br>  <br>  Or you can try Paula Deen's recipe which is just as good:  <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/paula-deen/the-best-bread-pudding-recipe/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/paula...</a>|`|vcdhCiU6aa	Bread and pudding? I don't cook and this is the wrong category.
jd14u32qaa	I am very 'aware' of the things around me.  Part of that means that when someone walks by, walks into the room, whereever, I'm going to look at them to see who it is and what they're doing.  I'm not bothered by other people doing this and I don't care if it bothers someone when I do it.|`|mQZDizMVaa	If it's a quick glance - no.<br>  <br>  If it's one of those up-and-down stares - that's annoying and rude.  I sometimes get that whenever I'm in the city: on the street, in the subway. What are they looking for or scrutinizing? A "fashion mistake?"<br>  <br>  I don't get that in the country because everyone drives(!) and in the mall, I don't get the up-and-down stare. It's not a "fashion contest" as it is in the city.|`|xDaesbudaa	I don't mind a look, as long as it's not prolonged.  I'm not known for  drawing looks of attraction, so if someone's looking at me for an extended period of time, it can't be for anything good.|`|fEfiUhSpaa	it doesnt bother me as long its just to notice me....but if it has to do with talking aobu tme or giving me mean looks...|`|54ro47TIaa	It depends on the quick glance..<br>  Some quick glances are right into my eyes, which is sort of invasive to me. If I just see someone pass their head back to see that I'm behind them, then it doesn't bother me. <br>  BUT if I'm in a deli and someone looks at me as they are passing and makes direct eye contact, I feel a little awkward...like they are looking at me because maybe they recognize me.<br>  I've gotten over this by staring back at them blatantly until they look away. There is a respectable, concerned glance, and a personal, unneccessary glance...|`|8OREBeRdaa	A glimpse is NOT a big deal. Haven't you ever walked past someone and if it wasn't for that extra glance you wouldn't have recognized an old friend / acquaintance?<br>  <br>  If the look is mean, I don't even pay attention to it. If people want to look, they can.<br>  <br>  I used to have long hair almost to the middle of my back.  It was well taken care of and I'd even get compliments.  Because it goes against the norm, people would look longer.  I just turned it around and boost my confidence and would think that they're just checking me out!  Even sometimes, I'll just nod hello or even say "Hi!" as I walk by.  That tends to give some the hint if they're looking for too long. <br>  <br>  I think they guy getting shot dead is an extreme case of this and more details would be required.|`|Nr6GgBJSaa	i don't really care how people looks at me, but i believe they think that how we look at them. like for example i like to listen to rock mostly, and so i am listing to it on the bus, there is an old lady looking at me, because of what she was hearing, and it wasn't a pretty song either. i was aware of her looking at me, and did not care because she was about to die, and i guess she belied in GOD. the reason people look at you, that they jealous of you, or they old school, and don't know the new one. so yea it doesn't bother me that much. other reason is that they judging you by your cover.|`|uisC37Efaa	Honestly if its just a quick glance then no, it doesn't bother me.<br>  What bothers me is people who do a double take, look me up and down, stare at me as I walk past or say things to me or about me as I walk past them.<br>  I am interested in fashion, and therefore I do wear some things that other people have not seen yet/think are a bit strange, but still, especially in terms of making comments at or about me, please just keep it to yourselves!!!<br>  Although I must admit, some days I am more irritable than others and will feel a bit annoyed if I think that someone has "just glanced at me" a little too long.. it all really depends on how I'm feeling about my self/my appearance that day.<br>  But oh my, I would never shoot someone dead for it =0|`|a172ded814c17e4957eba16acd8888d7aa	i'm not bothered by it alli think its just natural <br>  as a matter of fact i do that lol|`|eiEdUWNbaa	It's human nature to look at movement. It doesn't bother me one bit, and I certainly at least glance at someone approaching me.
AA10076207	tip is part of the word "Gratuity"meaning "appreciation for good service" i realize he's prolly only making minimum wage,but it's the height of rudeness to ask for one. besides, you don't tip radio shack ppl or sears ppl, or the walmart check out guy/girl, why would he be special? i'd ask to speak to his boss.|`|PUUXbVK2aa	i think it's rude.<br>  <br>  we ordered a pizza once, and when my sister gave him the money he said he only brought change for a large combination pizza.<br>  we didn't think anything of it until he left, when I asked how he knew how much money we were going to give him.<br>  <br>  It was his way of making sure he got a tip, by not having enough change.<br>  <br>  :(|`|cPuicv06aa	It was very rude of him to ask for any tip!  And, in my opinion it is not customary to tip people who provide these types of services.|`|eiEdUWNbaa	Yes, he was rude. Your no response was the best response.|`|a7Zu52jFaa	I too, think it was very rude of him.<br>  <br>  I agree that you probably don't usually tip for that kind of service. If you had taken it Sears or Radio Shack - they definitely wouldn't expect a tip.|`|hXQnR2Scaa	Yes.<br>  It is extremely rude and declasse to ask for a tip. Especially, since that guy was surely an hourly employee.<br>  <br>  In any event, it is not customary to tip that sort of "skilled" service.|`|AA11598210	~~Yes he was rude, and I wouldn't have tipped him either. I do not think tipping for a retail shop is even appropriate anyway.~~|`|xDaesbudaa	He was just trying to milk you further.  Feel no obligation to that nor to any tip jars.  Only tip actual service (i.e. waiters, hair stylists, taxi drivers).|`|xvey8ixPaa	It is always rude to ASK for a tip.|`|AA11788494	I would never tip anyone like that.  I did once and regretted it.  You did nothing wrong.|`|Wf7vVQGCaa	Yes, it was.|`|8OREBeRdaa	Yes he was.  You don't ask for tips.  Simple as that.<br>  <br>  I don't tip at kiosks or retail services.  How do I reward their good service? - easy! with repeat business.<br>  <br>  You did the right thing.<br>  <br>  To Allison: When I order pizza (which is rare cuz I don't eat it often). I ask if they have direct debit machine or take credit card.  I don't pay cash because too many pizza delivery drivers pull that scam to get a tip.  I know my buddy tells the pizza delivery place to have the driver bring sufficient change or he's sending the guy packing. This shouldn't have to be done but it's sometimes necessary. That may help you from getting stiffed that way.|`|NmG00NMdaa	Yes, it was rude for him to suggest a tip. But, it obviously has worked for him before so he keeps up the practice. I guess he thinks he has nothing to lose by asking. I would assume he is paid for the job unless he works on a commission by selling something from the kiosk. I would have ignored his comment and just said thank you and walked away.|`|2817b9f40dd085213f3b05c5a7f43327aa	he  was way out of line, never take anything there again,unless he is gone. also you can buy watch battries at a dollar store,so may have to check 2 or 3 stores, but they have them. good luck  next time.|`|uXAV4wP0aa	Talk to his boss! I highly doubt that this behavior is okay.|`|QIaxixSlaa	it's rude to hint at a tip|`|a172ded814c17e4957eba16acd8888d7aa	tacky tacky taco <br>  that was bad|`|h59Bc4wfaa	1st you NEVER ask or hint for a tip and second you don't tip at a place like that. <br>  <br>  You were right, don't worry.
376ce902307f5e574ed98c7f99ccba8daa	Gay people tend to be more in touch with their feminine sides - which allows us to be more in touch with art. It has nothing to do with our homosexuality, it's all about our connection to certain attributes which assist in creating great works of art. If a straight guy was in touch with himself in that way, then he could be a great artist too.|`|576e76ca46b6c4293f45926a8e75773caa	I think that's a stereotype.|`|9CCtt077aa	I don't think the ratio of gays to heterosexuals is 1/10, but that's just my opinion.<br>  <br>  No, I don't think gay men or gay people in general are better artists than heterosexuals. There's no proof of that. Some of the smartest and most creative people I know happen to be straight.|`|48AxT51Aaa	It's sometimes nice to think so, especially with all the prejudice against gays in the world, but I have to say no.  <br>  <br>  Many great artists were/are gay, but I've come across more straight ones in my casual perusing of history.  I think the ratio is about the same to the common population.|`|QeTPWhf7aa	I think everyone should be treated equal.|`|JknwX64saa	That is a stereotype.|`|G7Rit8uiaa	I think that is true to an extent. Straight people have a tendency to conform to man made rules like gender roles but gay people have a way of being more open to different opinions which in turn relinquishes many of the boundaries that confine the creative side. Art is about self expression but how can you express yourself when your to busy pretending to be macho?|`|l8c2kTlvaa	I don't think so, it's just the person, being gay doesn't make you a good artist and being a good artist doesn't make you gay.|`|bBSAFsrhaa	NO!

6Whz1p5Eaa	Why don't you talk to your pastor about your dilemma? After all, if your parents are putting you through all that religious preparation, you should at least get something useful out of it, right?|`|lU8e0VQFaa	Your parents can't force you to believe something you don't, go with which ever you feel more comfortable with.    But if you choose Wicca be prepared for all the ignorant bull **** and people thinking you worship Satan. Still, it's a wonderful peaceful religion with a way less bloody history than Christianity.|`|ZtEVlc0yaa	Follow your heart.   If you believe in prayer, you could go that route.   Or not. :]|`|5b9d75acf8c31110fcdbe2289558b613aa	And your parents would be correct to not allow you to leave christianity.    You are not mature enough to make that type of decision.  Many young people are led a stray because something else "sound or looks" more interesting.    Leave wicca alone until your much older and your brain is more developed.|`|7KJcMpl9aa	Go for your confirmation if it makes your parents happy.  It's just a religious ceremony, it doesn't really mean anything except to those who practice it.    Then, spend some real time researching and exploring your faith before you make any decisions.  Your beliefs are yours to have.    I personally think you should keep your faith, but it's totally up to you.|`|gCVA7Z1Maa	Neither. All religions are tools for authoritarianism, using an irrational idea to form the basis for controlling others that must be defended with violence. I don't know if Wicca fits the definition of religion, but it's surely mysticism, irrational ideas with no basis in reality. Christianity of course is a religion, and like I said it's primary purpose is to make you a blindly obedient (ignorant and clueless) servant. Now that you've tried thinking for yourself, it's very important you realize you've crossed the line and it would be dishonest of you to continue to merely pretend to be a Christian, and since Wicca is a dead end, I suggest you move further out there and try philosophy, try figuring things out for yourself, try living life on your own terms, follow your interests and passions, and don't let anyone or any idea, make you its slave.|`|qCtbizzPaa	Christians demonize paganism and Wicca, so you can't believe in both.    However, I don't think you should make such an important decision based on what your parents want.|`|AA12257580	I'm pretty sure the one thing NOBODY can control is what you think and believe.|`|kFpFU97zaa	Get confirmed. Continue to read up on Wicca. If you're still really passionate about it when you're say.... 18, go for it, follow that path.      You definitely can't do both.|`|tI1NHwfBaa	Why do you say you're a Christian?  Is it because you go to a Catholic church?  Or because you are preparing for confirmation?  Because you go to a Catholic school?    Those things don't make you a Christian.  Only following Jesus Christ makes one a Christian.  Do you know Jesus?  Pray to Him?  Ask Him for forgiveness of sin?|`|AA10168935	I imagine your problem will have a huge problem if you try to change. You can always follow their wishes for now and read up on Wicca and plan to follow it when you leave their home.    Both follow the golden rule. Make that the focus of your time spent on the subject until then.|`|LUGCxeuNaa	You're basically choosing between a broken down computer and a computer that won't work.|`|UYZ2oD3taa	Just tell your parents that you aren't ready to be confirmed. Make something up. Say you aren't ready to give your life to Jesus. This gives you time to read up on Wicca or whatever interests you. Your 13 and your parents seem to be forcing thier beliefs on you.    Choose your own path|`|nCjkx8qPaa	What are you confirming?  ...The fact that you can't make up your mind?    You're 13 and obviously not ready to make such decisions. You have not fully reached the age of accountability for all things.  However, making a decision to believe in something other than GOD can cost you your life. Are you willing to risk that?    What has your church taught you?  Or shall I say, Did you even bother to pay attention?  Naturally other Things and Ideas are going to attract you.  That is Satan's plan to lead you away from GOD.    We are in the LAST generation before the Great Tribulation.  It is only a matter of a short time frame until Satan returns,  pretending to be Christ. Are you going to be one of the millions   that follow him?   I hope not, but, that's where you're headed if you leave   GOD out of your life for some false religious junk.    I say this with all due respect and Tough Love....  GROW UP !|`|lUJubxY9aa	Christianity, wicca is evil and there's lots of evidence for christianity|`|Kbry7CnOaa	We pagans will accept you even after your confirmation.     If it causes trouble at home, just study it and you can become a Wiccan later on. Unlike many religions we do not judge, and you are young....    You must always follow your heart.    Easy.|`|MkQWnA22aa	I think that you should talk with your parents about your concerns. At your age, it's not a time to make decisions about committing to a new religion. If you feel you can't make your Confirmation, then discuss that with your pastor and your family.|`|m73vgcxUaa	No matter how they disguise it it's still witch craft and a path straight to hell run don't walk away from it.|`|uaGFRjeOaa	I think that you should thoroughly think things through before deciding between them. But for the most part, I think that you should ask yourself if you believe in God.  If you do, but are still unsure, you could probably skip your Confirmation until you're really sure of what you want to do.  They you could take your course all over again.  After all, that's what it means to be confirmed.  Don't do it until you're absolutely sure.  And about Wicca, do you feel that you know it as well as Christianity?  If you don't, maybe you should put more time into it.  Talk to your parents about this.  They probably won't want you to have your Confirmation if you're not sure.  They could help you decide.  They probably know you the best, better than me anyway.  Good luck.  :)|`|564d359090a6d360bec9ee3849107a51aa	Wicca is satan's distraction to get you away from God. Don't fall for it. It is evil and not of God.|`|21e2df8fa47efbcd44eaee35a303bd20aa	I think you can take different parts of different religions and apply them to your life.   If you are not comfortable making a Confirmation then dont do it... it is better to wait until you are completely certain of what you want.   Your parents may not understand but it is better for you to be honest with yourself.   Your religion is YOUR decision... no one elses.     For example... I believe in God... but I think that a lot of what the church teaches is hypocritical. I just try to be the best person I can be and to help others... I think as long as you lead a good life and put others ahead of yourself then it doesnt matter whether or not you are a specific religion.|`|iNCzewKRaa	Think about being a Agnostic untill you figure it out ! (if ever) !|`|UyDkYaXuaa	A lot of Christianity is based on Paganism. (A Wiccan is a type of Pagan like a high heel is a type of shoe or an Episcopalian is a type of Christian.     Christmas was/is the Winter Solstice/Yule, a holiday celebrating the hope for light returning to the Earth.      Easter was/is the Spring Equinox, celebrating the regrowth and resurrection of flowers and life as well as the holiday dedicated to the Goddess Ishtar in Sumerian tradition.     There is more.     IM me if you need help with anything    Personally I like Paganism (I am Pagan) because I see so much beauty in nature and the order of the universe, as well how were all connected through energy.  I like the law, which could be also called the law of survival. An it harm none, do what ye will. Love is the law. Meaning we accept anyone.       I have some Christian friends too, most of them are Episcopalian, which is like the coolest Christian branch! They usually are nice people. They allowed gay marriage first. They tend to see good intent in people rather than pointing fingers.     If you can't decide, try the Unitarian church, they adopt people from ALL spiritual beliefs, they believe (as do i) that your Gods/Goddesses are valid as long as they keep you in peace with others.     It's your decision. I hope you find happiness.       Gods Bless. |`|zfRwAc5uaa	probably,you were reading bible but does not understand its content,and it is happening not only to you.Trying to understand wicca is the greatest mistake you could ever imagine in your life,I just want to help save your soul.wicca is the work of evil as simple as like that,hope you get my message.|`|aWPfvwilaa	You will probably change your spiritual path many times in your life.

It is one that you will discover on your own  I actually know of a few Witches who also believe and follow the teachings of Christ|`|bwiCLBnmaa	Ditch christianity, go with Wicca    Wicca is a religion of light, Christianity is a religion of darkness. It is evil and its followers are blinded by lies and hatred. Their souls are locked away in darkness, and are consumed with evil.    They spread evil lies to suck converts into their bottomless pit of evil and hatred.|`|jlF3MEzmaa	There is a something called "Christian Wicca", and there are several good books on it, go to amazon and search for it, i've seen it before.|`|21808938a2c954ea0389683f10267c69aa	Wicca and Christianity are two separate religions.  You cannot honestly follow both.  Wicans have their own gods (yes, plural).  If you believe in God, Jesus and the Bible, there is absolutely no reason why you should be considering Wicca, which involves worship of other gods (among other things).    If you are having doubts about God, Jesus and/or the Bible, and therefore want to put off your Confirmation, I think you should just tell your parents that.  Tell them that you want to be honest and don't want to declare a faith you still have questions about.  You can always get confirmed later.

Think of it this way if your on death row and the president gives you a pardon and you don't accept it than you WILL be executed.Its the same way.    Hell was not intend for us but for the devil and his followers (angels that became demons). However when sin entered man, man became enslaved by the devil because if you commit sin, in a sens,e you become a follower of the devil so you share his fate.|`|KmBBGUa6aa	he forgives sin, that is true. and he does love everyone. but he gives us freewill if we choose to accept Jesus christ as our saviour. if we don't, he doesnt send us, we technically did it upon ourself.
KvwVBzb0aa	I have never been able to see mine like to just look at them, I see them in dreams but did not know who they were until I recently got interested in Mediums and psychics which is another story but I had a psychic draw a picture of my spiritual guide and describe my guardian angels. My spiritual guide turned out to be this little old lady who lived next door when I was very young. I used to run next door every time I saw her out and climb in her swing and spend hours listening to her stories and I called her "Gammy" I was like two and she was like eighty. She once told me if she had to leave she would always be with me and I cried when the psychic showed me the picture and he had drawn and he had written "Gammy" at the bottom. He described my favorite Uncle as one of my Guardian Angels and I knew he was for real because he told me the angel told him to tell me he always knocked on our window with his keys when he visited when I was a child. One was an oriental man and I had no idea who it might be until I was telling my mother about what the psychic said and she told me about an elderly oriental man who worked for my parents when i was a baby and he would always tell my Mother I was in spirit his baby. The third was a Native American man.  I vaguely remembered him again from my childhood. We vacationed yearly in Arizona or New Mexico and this man lived on a reservation in Arizona and he had made me a beautiful turqoise necklace with a symbol which meant something to the effect of Child of my family. I still have the necklace and was very touched that these people had chosen to watch over me. I have seen them all in my dreams.  It is said and I believe it that if you say out loud before you go to bed at night, I wish to see my Guardian Angel in my dreams you will see them and after you see them in your dreams if you talk to them you will hear them and eventually see them. All children are born with this ability but usually their parents tell them it is their imagination so they quit believeing and their Guardian Angels quit showing themselves until a person comes to a spiritual place in their lives where they believe again.|`|ojHFFpcBaa	They're all over the place.

Television programming is altered for the airing of a wide variety of pieces from inane cartoons to worship services.  Products packaged for Christian holidays take place of precedence in supermarkets, malls, and everywhere people congregate.  Classrooms are decked with this advertising, and non-Christian children have no choice regarding spending their days in this environment.  Even the US capital is decorated for these events.      Muslims cannot avoid having our children exposed to other faiths, wherever they go, even to school.  If a few merchants choose to offer toys manufactured specifically for Muslim children, does that in anyway compare with the wholesale Christian bombardment of non-Christians for a quarter of every year?|`|wyYlpXcRaa	I'm muslim and  consider an excess to find " islam is the light" in a video game in every step.

This situatuion is similar as bolivian kids when learning  since 5 years old that  they has to hate chileans coz they took away bolivian sea....

bYqWHuzyaa	anana is the common name for a fruit and also the herbaceous plants of the genus Musa which produce this commonly eaten fruit. They are native to the tropical region of Southeast Asia. Bananas are likely to have been first domesticated in Papua New Guinea.[1] Today, they are cultivated throughout the tropics.[2]    Banana plants are of the family Musaceae. They are cultivated primarily for their fruit, and to a lesser extent for the production of fibre and as ornamental plants. As the banana plants are normally tall and fairly sturdy they are often mistaken for trees, but their main or upright stem is actually a pseudostem (literally "fake stem"). For some species this pseudostem can reach a height of up to 28 m, with leaves of up to 3.5 m in length. Each pseudostem can produce a bunch of yellow, green or even red bananas before dying and being replaced by another pseudostem.    The banana fruit grow in hanging clusters, with up to 20 fruit to a tier (called a hand), and 3-20 tiers to a bunch. The total of the hanging clusters is known as a bunch, or commercially as a "banana stem", and can weigh from 3050 kg. The fruit averages 125 g, of which approximately 75% is water and 25% dry matter content. Each individual fruit (known as a banana or 'finger') has a protective outer layer (a peel or skin) with a fleshy edible inner portion. Both skin and inner part can be eaten raw or cooked. Western cultures generally eat the inside raw and throw away the skin while some Asian cultures generally eat both the skin and inside cooked. Typically, the fruit has numerous strings (called 'phloem bundles') which run between the skin and inner part. Bananas are a valuable source of vitamin B6, vitamin C, and potassium.    Bananas are grown in at least 107 countries.[3] In popular culture and commerce, "banana" usually refers to soft, sweet "dessert" bananas. The bananas from a group of cultivars with firmer, starchier fruit are called plantains. Bananas may also be cut and dried and eaten as a type of chip. Dried bananas are also ground into banana flour.    Although the wild species have fruits with numerous large, hard seeds, virtually all culinary bananas have seedless fruits. Bananas are classified either as dessert bananas (meaning they are yellow and fully ripe when eaten) or as green cooking bananas. Almost all export bananas are of the dessert types; however, only about 10-15% of all production is for export, with the United States and European Union being the dominant buyers.

Further information might be found on the talk page. (June 2008)    The banana plant is a pseudostem that grows to 6 to 7.6 metres (20-25 feet) tall, growing from a corm. Leaves are spirally arranged and may grow 2.7 metres (9 ft) long and 60 cm (2 ft) wide.[4] The banana plant is the largest of all herbaceous flowering plants.[5] The large leaves grow whole, but are easily torn by the wind, resulting in the familiar frond look.[6]    A single, sterile, male banana flower, also known as the banana heart is normally produced by each stem (though on rare occasions more can be produced - a single plant in the Philippines has five[7]). Banana hearts are used as a vegetable in Southeast Asia, steamed, in salads, or eaten raw.[8] The female flowers are produced further up the stem and produce the actual fruit without requiring fertilization. The fruit has been described as a "leathery berry".[9] In cultivated varieties, the seeds have degenerated nearly to non-existence; their remnants are tiny black specks in the interior of the fruit. The ovary is inferior to the flower; because of their stiff stems and the positioning of the ovary and flower, bananas grow sticking up, not hanging down.    Some sources assert that the genus of the banana, Musa, is named for Antonio Musa, physician to the Emperor Augustus.[10] Others say that Linnaeus, who gave the genus its name in 1750, simply adapted an Arabic word for banana, mauz.[11] The word banana itself comes from the Arabic word banan, which means "finger".[12] The genus contains numerous species; several produce edible fruit, while others are cultivated a|`|HWoLbR7Aaa	I think his name was George.

lNwoOptraa	FEAR and ANGER  those are the reasons the stereotypes are still alive! We and I don't mean you or me but people want someone to blame for what they don't have so they blame others for their downfalls, Honestly I hope Obama and the new hope we have in the USA now will help heal wounds and help people of all colors to meet and come to know each other a little better, Become not so bitter and become kinder and not blame on each other. Slavery is part of history that should never be forgotten. BUT English Boats brought those poor people to our shores and sold them to rich land owners, This will never ever be forgotten. But, there is still slavery going on in other countries right now and no one is doing a damned thing about it. China is selling Tibetan girls into slavery right now. And in Africa the same is happening. But we turn our backs on them. We have been afraid to be Political with China. I want to get to the bottom of this hatred in this country and heal this USA and make it peaceful and kind and hold out my hand to people of every color. Thank you for asking this question!|`|92iuiuZKaa	Because alot of people love to exaggerate the truth and like generalizing one group of people as being the same|`|ncdTxID9aa	Well stereotypes are based on truth, stereotypes doesn't fit everyone, and many times they can be exaggerated.|`|b4Y0gDaIaa	society|`|p5aZtaiwaa	stop being a guru in racism, I've seen many black people are all smart when it comes to racism|`|OTnSwNwZaa	People follow stereotypes because in some cases, people may have had experiences where stereotypes have proven true.    other reason are to keep others down, to lift up their own image, (rare) to lift the images of others, to make life easier since you don't have to spend time actually getting to know somebody, etc..|`|SEBcylvuaa	stereotypes usually arent that far from the truth. all you need is to do at the communities of the people the stereotypes are about and you'll find plenty of people who fit them    unfortunately for every person that is an exception there are usually at least two people that fit them.(sometimes they may even be friends or family members of the people who are exceptions to them)    not saying that they apply to everybody and I dont assume something about someone because of their race. but stereotypes dont just pop up out of nowhere|`|M4ZGDSfIaa	People follow stereotypes because they have been programmed that way. They have been fed the bulls**t that is stereotypes by people they hang out with, or look up to. Fortunately there are people out there who do not follow those ridiculous stereotypes. For every stereotype there is someone that can prove it wrong. For example I cannot stand having weave in my hair. I don't mind others having it, but for me it is something I can't stand. And plenty of white people have rhythm. No stereotype is completely true. It is a huge exaggeration.

4Rt7Mm8Aaa	When your mind experiences pain, it automatically remembers it whenever a similar situation arises. The best time to study is when your body is uncomfortable. This can take several forms of discomfort, and none of them have to be severe. You can study on a hungry stomach, you will find concentration improves drastically. The same goes for when you throw water on yourself, and awaken early in the morning, or in the latter portion of the night. In these times your brain goes into overdrive, a mode of hyper awareness because it is jolted out of your usually passive behaviour. This is why many people find that studying after exercising, or playing sports and doing schoolwork actually improves their grades in school, rather than it harming them.<br>  Additionally, it is always a good idea to drink a glass of milk (or a calcium supplement) prior to doing studying. It will help clear the mind, and cause it to focus.|`|AA11097451	do it whenever you feel most comfortable with, because ur used to it and it would be hard to change it.<br>  <br>  but if you want to choose between night or morning, morning is better, because you are more refreshed, ur mind is more ready and is not tired so it is open to learn.|`|QIgrBrFdaa	Definitely night, I'm quite active in the mornings and so i prefer to do practical stuff, I can't just sit and work and I can never be bothered to wake up earlier to do it.

Since evolution is not a lie, it would be wrong.      * Evolution is very much a fact.    * The theory of evolution is a theory - just like atomic theory, gravity theory, and the germ theory of disease. The word "theory" has a very specific meaning in a scientific context: THE THEORY EXPLAINS THE FACTS. See http://www.notjustatheory.com/    * Creationism is not a theory; it's an assertion with zero evidence to support it.    * Over 99.8% of biologists and geologists accept evolution.    * There are no alternative scientific theories.    * There is a huge amount of evidence in support of evolution...    * And zero evidence against it.    * The "debate" is actually educated people trying to educate others.    * The more intelligent a person is, the more likely they are to understand and accept evolution.    * The "debate" only happens in backward places like Turkey and parts of the united states.    * There are two types of creationists: professionals who make money from books, lectures and such, and knowingly make false claims - and followers who accept those claims without understanding them.    * The basics of evolution: http://evolution.berkeley.edu/    * Examples of ridiculous creationist anti-science: http://www.youtube.com/profile_videos?us...    * Examples of creationist quote mining (like quoting part of a scientists' sentence to make it sound like he's saying something completely different): http://www.toarchive.org/faqs/quotes/min...    * Scientific American's 15 answers to creationist nonsense: http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=15-a...    * The evolutionary tree: http://www.dhushara.com/book/evol/trevol...    * Hominid species: http://www.toarchive.org/faqs/homs/speci...    * Transitional fossils: http://www.toarchive.org/indexcc/CC/CC20...    * A comprehensive list of evolution resources: http://richarddawkins.net/forum/viewtopi...    * Or just look at this bonobo: http://neatorama.cachefly.net/images/200...|`|h6NqNzHAaa	Why not?

89a4e35709fd20d8fa340ef1d5a3bac3aa	Salam for you (1)Shirk is making ally to Allah swt who is only one,no parents and no child. such as Allah has a son.Shirk means also as believing to another power than the power of Allah such to idols. (2)Nature of human beings is sometimes weak and in another time strong,so its nature is up and down,but in essence human beings believe that there is someone who regulates this universe who is very powerful. If his/her faith is weak he/she can be easily influenced by syaitans.Human being has curiousity to know who is the highest regulator on this earth. by giving attention to the nature such as the movement of this earth,moon and sun,the replacement of day with night etc. (3)Risalah is very important in our life because this risalah will be used as the life guide.In Islam risalah is derived from the Qur'an,sahih hadiths of Muhammad pbuh and ijma of ulamas.Based on this risalah we will know the good doings and bad doings. (4)Mercy and compassion are the most important qualities of Allah because by mercy we muslims will convince that all of their bad doings will be forgiven by Allah if we repent as soon as  possible if it has been done and promise  to Allah that we do not want to make the same mistakes in the future.Compassion is the quality of Allah that Allah loves all human beings whether they are muslims,christians,jews,kafirs and atheists too.Allah does not make a difference among them.They are given subsistences (rezeki) for each of them from Allah.|`|4aveC2aaaa	you know what is really weird? i have been so thirsty today!|`|KqiiT1WSaa	But you want the shia point of view, so i won't waste my time answering these questions.|`|QIgrBrFdaa	Haha looks like you're trying to get us to do your homework for you ! <br>  I don't think so young lady, go and get it done, and no cheating lol.|`|dorCTHWJaa	You wanna something else I just finished a whole bowl of popcorn very buttery one.<br>  Yep I'm depresssed

If that's all he has to tell you that you are heading down the wrong road then maybe he's not such a good friend.

Not everyone will agree with you on whether being gay is a choice but if you feel like its a part of who you are then so be it.  There is no need to waste your time explaining it to someone who isn't going to listen.  Good luck I hope it works out for you.|`|pYn2L2DHaa	1. You probably can't convince him that being gay is not a choice.  He's too closeted to accept the possibility that one's sexuality really IS predetermined, which would implicate him regarding his behavior with you and other guys.<br>  <br>  2. How convenient for him to have a hard-core fundagelical Christian church so he can judge you for being gay while he's getting his man-sex on the side (but then, in his world that's not really "gay").  YOU get to be the "designated sinner".  HE gets to have it both ways.  I hope he doesn't bring a disease back to his wife because of his dalliances: she may wonder how it is she ended up with gonorrhea or syphilis (or worse).<br>  <br>  3.

They have no idea how we deal with the pain and frustration on defending who you are to the people who couldn't accept it. You don't have to have "good points" to prove that being gay is not a choice to get something across. It's the fact that you're being true to yourself, and living your life the way you want it is purely enough.<br>  <br>  We're all born in a blank slate. We learn things, and we discover who we really are. I'm gay, because I AM gay. No matter how much i want to "choose" who i want to be, I can't. It's because of who i am.   <br>  <br>  Hope i made sense. :)

6Whz1p5Eaa	To be honest, I no longer know. When I was a fundamentalist, I believed that, but I recently walked away from fundamentalism so I am reassessing my theology... and I kind of had to admit to myself that the Bible doesn't necessarily say that people of other religions are going to Hell.    I bought a book called "Who Can Be Saved"? by Terrance L. Tiessen which is supposed to address this issue. I'm looking forward to reading it.|`|NaM4ZT64aa	That is only a conversion technique.    Fear.    If any *actually* lived and believed what they preached, no one would suggest anything like that.  But "judge not, lest thee be judged" has fallen upon deaf ears...    I like your Christ, I do not like your Christians. Your Christians are so unlike your Christ.-Mohandas Gandhi    If I were not an atheist, I would believe in a God who would choose to save people on the basis of the totality of their lives and not the pattern of their words.  I think he would prefer an honest and righteous atheist to a TV preacher whose every word is God, God, God, and whose every deed is foul, foul, foul.-Isaac Asimov|`|HRvPoQzKaa	They wouldn't.

This, despite the absurdity of it (Reverend Haggard is going to Heaven and Mahatma Gandhi is currently residing in Hell), is the main argument here in R&S.      . . . makes no sense to argue with either the side that insists it is true or the side that wastes it's time trying to convince them they are wrong.

Joh 3:16  For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.     Joh 3:17  For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.     Joh 3:18  He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.     Joh 3:19  And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.     Joh 3:20  For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.

Rather, man chooses to go there on his own. You can see the progression of those who reject Christ in the first 3 chapters of the book of Romans. The wrath of God is revealed against the unrighteous because man rejects the Creator and worships the creation (Romans 1:18-20). Men profess to be wise in their own eyes (v. 22) and exchange the glory of God for created things. These people then continue in a downward spiral of sin that is listed in verses 28-31, sins to which all of us can relate. Not only do they participate in these sins, but they also approve of those who do them (v. 32). Not only do men have the creation of the world to see Gods power, but they also have their consciences convicting them of their sin (2:14-15). In the end, man is left without excuse that we deserve to die, and we stand condemned in front of God.    Jesus Christ came in the flesh so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing you may have life in His name (John 20:30,31). This is another witness to Gods existence and also stands to condemn those men who choose to reject Christ as the Son of God. Because Christ came to pay the price of sin, and He came to explain the Father (John 1:18), man has no excuse for rejecting Him. Men choose to go to hell because they reject Christ, not because God causes them to go there. God has paid the price, revealed Himself to all, and now men are without excuse (Romans 1:20). God allows people to be born to give them the opportunity to believe, but it is mans responsibility to make that choice. What kind of God would He be if He did not give man the opportunity to place his faith in the Lord?    This is still a very difficult concept to grasp. We can only cling to what we know about Gods nature and character, trust that His sovereignty and mercy do not contradict one another, and believe that everything He does and/or allows will ultimately be for His glory. We submit ourselves to Him in worship and obedience and trust that He works all things according to the counsel of His will (Ephesians 1:11) and that His ways are perfect, even when we dont understand them. He is the Rock, his work is perfect: for all his ways are judgment: a God of truth and without iniquity, just and right is he (Deuteronomy 32:4).|`|Z7RiriL6aa	Because God makes himself known in one way or another to everyone, and whether they take advantage of the opportunity set before them or not, is what will choose their fate. If they accept Him, they will go to Heaven, if they don't, they go to Hell. This however does not apply to children that are not of an age to know who God is.|`|7ff82885c9d5d1f343a4664e9d97a78aaa	True Christians would not say these things, ignore them.|`|wIZNsqG1aa	If someone has never heard the truth they will be given a second chance, the ones who turn away and reject the truth will be sent to hell. That is why we are supposed to try and teach the gospel to the world so they can avoid the Armageddon.|`|uz9GtV9vaa	As a Christian I wonder that every day.  I hope no one goes to hell.  There could be many explanations for what's going on.  Maybe the absence of God in someone's life leads to a separation from God that not even God can fix.  Maybe there is no hell.  Or maybe, non-believers and those of other faiths know Jesus in spirit, but not consciously, so they are saved as well and no one has to go to hell.  It's hard to say.    To roadside:  even if someone chose to go to hell, it doesn't justify God allowing it, because it causes eternal suffering.  No one who hasn't experienced eternal suffering can choose eternal suffering because they don't understand what they're choosing.|`|mLYFbStGaa	First of all, it doesn't matter how people are born.  I was born to agnostic parents.  I was never raised with the Bible.  Yet God was still able to reach me with the truth.      The reason that non-Christians will go to hell is because they have rejected the only one who was able to reconcile them to God.  There was only one person who ever completely obeyed God, fulfilled all God's laws and lived a perfect life.  Everyone else fell short.  Christ gives us His righteousness as a free gift so that we are accepted on the basis of His righteousness, not our own.    Everyone else goes to the judgment with only their own works, which are almost always stained with selfishness, lust, or pride.  Therefore, when you are being judged on the basis of your own works, you have to pay the penalty for sin.|`|lZ9Dl5Nhaa	They do have a choice.  God lets them hear about him, and they reject him and go back to their ways.  They have just as many chances as you had to become a Christian.      For example, say you're working on a science project and your dad offers you help.  You refuse, saying "I don't need your help."  He says "Ok, I won't help at all because you don't want me to."  When you turn it in, you recieve an F, but if you had your dad helped you then you would have gotten an A.  It's the same when it comes time to choose or reject him.  If you reject Him, He can't do anything to help you because you don't want it, and God gave us that choice.|`|jNUo0tKEaa	because it says it in the bible, the bible is god's holiness of words.

Christ offers us a lifeline from that - He didn't have to, he chose to.    As for the comment several above mine: it is incredibly contradictory. You use the quote about liking Christ but not Christians - liking Christ implies liking His teachings. He taught that none would be saved without going through Him. This precept is the foundation of Christianity, so to try and say it is not 'Christian' is a fallacy in the highest sense.|`|ls3yha9Paa	They have a lot of choices brother. These are the works of the missionaries. The Bible said in Matthew 24:14, that every ear shall hear the message of the gospel, even into the remotest part of the earth. And when they hear that gospel, they have to make a choice to accept it or not. If they do not accept by faith, the Bible said in 2 Thessalonians 1:8-9, "He punish those who do not know God (or refuse to believe in Him in other translation) and do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus, They will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out from the presence of the Lord and from the majesty of His power..."     And another thing, I just doubt that people will be going to hell  because they are not Christians, but maybe because of their wrong behavior and lifestyle. (Revelation 21:8 : But the cowardly, the unbelieving, the vile, the murderers, the sexually immoral, those who practice magic arts, the idolaters and all liars--their place will be in the fiery lake of burning sulfur. This is the second death."  Galatians 5:19-21  :     The acts of the sinful nature are obvious: sexual immorality, impurity and debauchery; idolatry and witchcraft; hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, dissensions, factions and envy; drunkenness, orgies, and the like. I warn you, as I did before, that those who live like this will not inherit the kingdom of God. )
AA12059450	Kenneth Wuest wrote a Greek "word studies" series with a companion volume called an "expanded translation" of the New Testament. This is the best New Testament of this type I have seen. Since I use Greek for my study directly most of the time, I don't use any of the similar translations, but this is one I did use in the past and appreciated the way in which he brought the various Greek tenses into English.    This is available in paperback for $13.99 USD (+ ship) at http://www.christianbook.com/Christian/B...    You may also be able to find it in used bookstores. The original set is 4 volumes in a navy hardcover. The word study portion of the set is written on a rather basic level, understandable by people with little or no background in language study. If you find the set available, consider it, but the New Testament volume is one I would definitely recommend.     ... My thought is that the rest of the set is good adjunct reading for a second year Greek student... It answers the "Why do I need this?" or "How can I use this?" questions quite well.|`|EBGdlo35aa	I'm not exactly certain what you mean by an "amplified bible", but one thing I know for sure is that you should stay FAR AWAY from the Amplified Bible.  http://www.jimpettis.com/bibles/amp.htm  http://www.bibletexts.com/reviews/bibles...

jbawMEehaa	Ya know what I see with this woman, remember the McCoys when they had like 6 babies all at once.  Companies were coming out of the woodwork to give these people help. Their house was too small so someone gave them a new one. They didn't have a mini van so someone gave them one and so on. They were showered with gifts as they were heroes. 20/20 still go to them and do reports on how the kids are doing.<br>  <br>  What I see is maybe she thought that would happen for her. She thought she would be set for life. Remember "god will provide".  Maybe this is the scam of the 21 century. <br>  <br>  But what everyone is forgetting is she couldn't have done any of this without a doctor willing to do it. But as in everything else if you have money or a promise to some as she probably thought she did, you can get anything.|`|e5VUwaRsaa	To bring that many kids into the world when you can't support them is not only irresponsible, but stupid and selfish. Personally, I think she's a crack pot.|`|xQh2CdfJaa	She has 6 kids at home she can't afford. She is on food stamps, she doesn't have a job, she lives in a house with her parents that is in the process of being foreclosed on. And then, with all of that going, go ahead and get pregnant. Now regardless of whether or not she was having 1 or 8, she was selfish. What about her kids at home that she can't support. Who is paying her hospital bill? How much more support is she going to need from tax payers? She really is just a selfish, selfish person. And I think in a time of people losing their jobs, their houses, to think that this selfish women, who already is receiving money from the government, is going to receive more, really gets people angry.

TzY9vkinaa	We believe in the restored Gospel of Jesus Christ. When Joseph Smith was a young boy he wanted to know what church to join, he read in the bible "if any of you lack wisdom let him ask of God" so he did. God the father and Jesus Christ appeared to him and said he must join none of them. An angel came to him and showed him where to find burried gold plates. When he grew up he found the plates again and translated them. They are what we call "the book of Mormon".  In 1829, Joseph Smith received the restored priesthood authority to organize Christs Church.  John the Baptist appeared and conferred upon Joseph Smith and his associate Oliver Cowdery the Aaronic Priesthood?, which includes the authority to perform the ordinance? of baptism?.  Later, Peter, James, and John (three of Christs original Apostles) appeared and conferred the Melchizedek Priesthood? upon Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery, restoring the same authority given to Christs Apostles anciently.  In 1830, with this priesthood authority, the same Church of Jesus Christ that existed centuries ago was organized and restored to the earth by Joseph Smith.     Thats the basic history of how the restored gospel came to be.  This is some of the things we believe    1 We believe in God, the Eternal Father, and in His Son, Jesus Christ, and in the Holy Ghost.    2 We believe that men will be punished for their own sins, and not for Adams transgression.    3 We believe that through the Atonement of Christ, all mankind may be saved, by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the Gospel.    4 We believe that the first principles and ordinances of the Gospel are: first, Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ; second, Repentance; third, Baptism by immersion for the remission of sins; fourth, Laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost.    5 We believe that a man must be called of God, by prophecy, and by the laying on of hands by those who are in authority, to preach the Gospel and administer in the ordinances thereof.    6 We believe in the same organization that existed in the Primitive Church, namely, apostles, prophets, pastors, teachers, evangelists, and so forth.    7 We believe in the gift of tongues, prophecy, revelation, visions, healing, interpretation of tongues, and so forth.    8 We believe the Bible to be the word of God as far as it is translated correctly; we also believe the Book of Mormon to be the word of God.    9 We believe all that God has revealed, all that He does now reveal, and we believe that He will yet reveal many great and important things pertaining to the Kingdom of God.    10 We believe in the literal gathering of Israel and in the restoration of the Ten Tribes; that Zion (the New Jerusalem) will be built upon the American continent; that Christ will reign personally upon the earth; and, that the earth will be renewed and receive its paradisiacal glory.    11 We claim the privilege of worshiping Almighty God according to the dictates of our own conscience, and allow all men the same privilege, let them worship how, where, or what they may.    12 We believe in being subject to kings, presidents, rulers, and magistrates, in obeying, honoring, and sustaining the law.    13 We believe in being honest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous, and in doing good to all men; indeed, we may say that we follow the admonition of PaulWe believe all things, we hope all things, we have endured many things, and hope to be able to endure all things. If there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy, we seek after these things.    The church has also fulfilled some prophecies in the Bible, such as.    Mal. 4: 5-6    5 ? Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord:    6 And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse.  Elijah did come and gave them some more priesthood keys http://scriptures.lds.org/en/dc/110/13-1...    Isa. 2: 2    2 And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the Lords house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it.    I think this is talking about all temples, more and more people are converting to our faith and going to the temples. Some people plan long trips just to go to the temple. Another interesting thing is that "Utah" in the Ute language means "the tops of the mountains". I don't think the Mormons chose the name Utah, they wanted to name it "Deseret".  If you didn't know, Utah is where the Mormons settled after being driven out of the eastern states, there's still a high population of Mormons there.    Isa. 29: 14    14 Therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvellous work among this people, even a marvellous work and a wonder: for the wisdom of their wise men shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid.  We believe it's talking about the Book of Mormon.    Amos 3: 7    7 Surely the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets.  You've gotta have prophets...

Thats the main tenet of the Mormon faith  believing this guy was not a liar. His name was Joe Smith and he claimed he was visited by an angel who told him the location of golden plates buried in the ground with another biblical text written in an old language on them. He claimed he translated these golden plates and wrote the translation in the Book of Mormon. He then claimed an angel took these golden plates to heaven when he finished translating them. During the translation, he claimed the golden plates were in his hat along with some magical rocks that he had and he hid behind a curtain and talked aloud whilst holding his face in his hat and a guy who owned a printing press wrote down what he said.    This is all standard Mormon beliefs; I don't know why they're giving me thumbs down.|`|1g49KgoGaa	They believe magic underwear will protect them from bullets,  that Jesus did missionary work in America  that the garden of Eden was in Missouri  that people with dark skin can repent and turn white.

Anyway, you've already received some good answers.  I'll just put in my two cents:    Mormons believe there is a loving God. Jesus is his son. Jesus suffered for our sins, without which sacrifice we would be lost.    Just as God spoke to the world through prophets during biblical times, we believe he does the same today and that there is a prophet having authority from God on the Earth today. We believe the Bible to be scripture. We also believe in additional scripture: The Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price.    We believe Jesus Christ is the savior of the mankind and the Messiah, that he was resurrected just as the Bible claims, and that he will return again.    These are some of the basics...check out the link below for more info.    http://www.mormon.org/mormonorg/eng/basi...|`|6lJuKKMHaa	"They" actually believe that The Creator God is 'brothers' to the devil!

Here are out beliefs, sort of summed up.    We believe in God the eternal Father and in His Son Jesus Christ and in the Holy Ghost.    We believe that man will be punished for his own sins, and not for Adam's Transgressions    We believe that through the atonement of Christ, all mankind may be saved, by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the gospel.  (Which generally speaking are faith, repentance, baptism, the gift of the Holy Ghost and enduring to the end)    We believe that Christ established His church on the Earth during his mortal ministry, in biblical times, but that His church fell into Apostasy following the deaths of His chosen apostles.    We believe that God has restored that church in our times, with prophets and apostles, and that God's authority is once again on the earth to perform the vital ordinances of salvation.|`|j74G3t51aa	What tjsgigante said is basically true, however he forgot to mention that they also believe that Jesus and Lucifer are brothers, and that Lucifer (of course now known as satan) is mad at God because He liked Jesus' plan for salvation and not Lucifer's.

We believe He is our Savior and Redeemer and that salvation comes in and only through Him.    It wouldn't be rude to ask your sis-in-law, most of us actually like talking about what we believe.  But no biggie.    We basically believe that God is our Father, Jesus Christ is His literal Son, and that we are all God's children.  We believe there is much more to salvation than just believing.  We believe there is also more to the after life than eternal heaven and hell.  We believe families can be together forever.  We believe there are certain ordinances and covenants one must make and keep in order to obtain exaltation.    Basically, we are imperfect people trying to live a perfect gospel.|`|2wUvFmrhaa	http://www.carm.org/mormon.htm    What does Mormonism teach?    The doctrines of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons) are very interesting. Most of the 'odd' ones are not initially taught to potential converts. But they should be. Instead, "they are revealed later as one matures and gains the ability to accept them."  The LDS Church tries to make its official doctrines appear Christian but what underlies those Christian sounding terms is far from Christian in meaning.     Much is NOT disclosed. The Information about ANYTHING non faith promoting is sugarcoated.    Want to know....  What the Mormon Missionaries Won't Tell You""  SEE...  http://contenderministries.org/mormonism...

Actually, I was told full blown lies about mormon history and real beliefs.|`|7VJcd5YLaa	Thanks for the sincere questions - and the trolls are out tonight.  I am courious on what you want to know specifically - since this is such a broad question.  The articles of faith and mormon.org are good starting points for our basic beliefs.    Even better - asking someone who is LDS in person - I don't know of anyone that is LDS that would be offended by an inlaw coming to them with exactly what you said here - perhaps leaving out the troll comment - on Y!A it is completely appropriate though.  :~)  I you ask her - I am sure she can answer your questions more completely - and with the benefit of an exchange that this forum does not allow.    There are also people you can chat with live on mormon.org    If you aren't really interesting in joining the church, just let your sister in law know as well as any person you might chat with on mormon.org  No one will pressure you - just answer your specific questions.    I can state that I believe in God, the creator, in His only begotten son Jesus Christ and in the Holy Ghost.  I believe that Jesus came to earth perfect, lived a perfect life, healed, taught, healed and performed miracles, preached and that he suffered for the sins of the world in Gethsemane, was crucifed on Golgotha was laid in a Garden tomb and rose three days later.  He ascended to Heaven and went to teach the other sheep that He spoke of in John.  One of those peoples lived in Central and South America.  He established His church among them and performed many miracles there.  These people went through periods of righteous and unrighteous living.  When they followed the commandments, they were blessed, when they did not, they did not prosper.  The prophets that were called among those people wrote and when their civilization was nearing destruction the remaining prophet hid the records in the earth.    I believe that a young man was confused about the subject of religion and decided to put a scripture to the test.  He asked God which religion to join.  He recived a visit from God and Jesus Christ - two separate and glorified beings in answer to his prayer.      Through the next several years, the young man was trained and visited by angels to prepare him to re-establish the complete church of God on the earth once more.  He was led to the records and given them to translate, which he did - this became the Book of Mormon, a collection of the writings of the ancients.    I believe that if we put the words of the Book of Mormon to practice, we can learn of it's truthfulness by the power of the Holy Ghost.    Well - that's it in a nutshell - What I believe as well as about 13 million more people.    Basic principles - family - they are eternal.  Every person will be ressurected.  Jesus Christ will return to earth once more.  Among other things - but most of what you hear out there that sounds really strange about our beliefs - manufactured - not true stuff.  If it sounds really bizarre and like it belongs in the National Enquirer - it is probably not something that the church teaches.  (No planets for every person - sorry - no magic clothing, no horns, you get the idea.)

wyXCRGv6aa	no idea
WyICbuPqaa	Part of it is true.  The Lord taught Abraham that we existed before we were born as spirits, and that he (the Lord) chose his rulers from among these spirits.    "... if there be two spirits, and one shall be more intelligent than the other, yet these two spirits, notwithstanding one is more intelligent than the other, have no beginning; they existed before, they shall have no end, they shall exist after, for they are gnolaum, or eternal. And the Lord said unto me: These two facts do exist, that there are two spirits, one being more intelligent than the other; there shall be another more intelligent than they; I am the Lord thy God, I am more intelligent than they all. " (Abraham 3:18-19)    "Now the Lord had shown unto me, Abraham, the intelligences that were organized before the world was; and among all these there were many of the noble and great ones; and God saw these souls that they were good, and he stood in the midst of them, and he said: These I will make my rulers; for he stood among those that were spirits, and he saw that they were good; and he said unto me: Abraham, thou art one of them; thou wast chosen before thou wast born. " (Abraham 3:22-23)    This is similar to what the Lord told Jeremiah:  "Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations."  (Jeremiah 1:5)    Joseph Smith testified that God was eternal and alive.  "17 By these things we know that there is a God in heaven, who is infinite and eternal, from everlasting to everlasting the same unchangeable God, the framer of heaven and earth, and all things which are in them;     18 And that he created man, male and female, after his own image and in his own likeness, created he them;     19 And gave unto them commandments that they should love and serve him, the only living and true God, and that he should be the only being whom they should worship." (D & C 20:17-19)    The God of Israel is refered to throughout scripture as the true God and living God.  Moses taught that the children of Israel would not stay in Palestine, but be scattered throughout the world, where they would worship Gods of wood and stone, which could not eat or hear or see or smell.  (Deuteronomy 4:26-31)  The implication was that the God of Israel, the living God, could eat, hear, see and smell.    Some men have suggested, based on their ignorance of the scriptures, that no man has seen God.  The opposite is true: God has appeared to many.  In Exodus 24:9-11, seventy four separate men saw God standing on a "paved work of saffire stone".  Moses himself is repeatedly characterized as talking to God face to face.    "And he saw God face to face, and he talked with him, and the glory of God was upon Moses; therefore Moses could endure his presence."  (Moses 1:2)    "And the Lord spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend..." (Exodus 33:11)    We have the testimony from several prophets that God appears to mankind from time to time, and that he is a living being and appears in the form of a man.  He selected his leaders from among the spirits that existed from before the foundation of the world.  He setup the plan whereby we can come to Earth and receive physical bodies, that we might also live as he lives.|`|OQ9SXUAMaa	No, according to Mormon doctrine everybody will be resurrected    www.mormon.org|`|q5lreoiWaa	You've twisted it about.

First and foremost, we believe everyone will be resurrected.  Second of all, I've never really thought of God as a resurrected being.  He is and has always been God.  There's also no mention of "parents".  There's only a mention of God in our doctrine.  The Heavenly Mother thing, while logical, is just speculation.    Our goal in this life should be to follow Jesus Christ.|`|0qhRIKpSaa	The church teaches that everyone will be resurrected. Christ broke the "bonds of death" so salvation from death is universal.

We do believe our spirits existed as intelligences first, somehow God, with our Heavenly Mother, created our spirits (who yes, does have a perfected body of flesh and bone).  We believe there were two plans given - one was from Lucifer and one from Jehovah - Christ. - and that we all "picked" who's side we were on.  God chose Christ's plan - to come to earth and have free agency, and also be the Savior - and Lucifer rebelled and 1/3 of all of God's children followed Lucifer who was cast out and became Satan.  We actually chose to come to earth, all of us.  There were no "fence-sitters", no one undecided.  We were either for Christ or against and those against followed satan and will never live on the earth nor gain a body.  Our goal in this life should be to be as Christ-like as possible, follow the commandments, live so that we may return to live eternally with our Heavenly Father and gain exaltation.  We do believe those who gain exaltation will have the chance to eternally progress... there's not necessarily doctrine stating we will become gods, more that we will be LIKE God.|`|q0gRmHlUaa	That's a debatable topic among some LDS scholars.  The church itself does not have an official position.|`|PKWHLbdfaa	I would have thought most mormons would say yes, this is correct except for the resurrection part.  Mormons do believe and teach a universal resurrection but the more worthy being resurrected to a more glorious place and some able to progress to Godhood while others won't.       On man's eternal progression, founding prophet Joseph Smith declared: "God Himself was once as we are now, and is an exalted man" (Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, pp.345-346). Another one of their leaders coined the phrase: "As man is, God once was; as God is, man may become" (The Gospel Through the Ages, Hunter, p.105-106). Brigham Young preached: "It appears ridiculous to the world, under their darkened and erroneous traditions, that God has once been a finite being" (Deseret News, Nov. 16, 1859, p. 290).    So yes, Mormon leaders have taught as a fundamental truth that God was once on a planet like this one to get a body.  I'm glad to see some on this site moving beyond that to say, God is eternal, always was God.  That's much closer to a Biblical Christian perspective on God.    But again, Mormon prophets have long taught that if they are worthy, they will be a God of their own world.  An LDS leader wrote: "since mortal beings are the spirit children of Heavenly Parents, as pointed out in the last chapter, the ultimate possibility is for some of them to become exalted to Godhood." (The Gospel Through the Ages, Hunter, p.104) Brigham Young declared: "Intelligent beings are organized to become Gods, even the Sons of God, to dwell in the presence of the Gods" (Discourses of Brigham Young, p.245).|`|2wUvFmrhaa	Yes, it is.  Here is 40 quotes from mormon leaders on the topic...  http://www.mormonquotes.com/search.php?c...    From Joseph Smith...  "I am going to tell you how God came to be God. We have imagined and supposed that god was God from all eternity. I will refute that idea, and take away the veil, so that you may see. These are incomprehensible ideas to some, but they are simple. It is the first principle of the gospel to know for certainty the character of god and to know that we may converse with him as one man converses with another, and that he was once a man like us, yea, that God himself the father of us all, dwelt on an earth, the same as Jesus Christ himself did; and I will show it from the Bible."      Author:  Joseph Smith   Source:  History Of The Church   Volume:  6   Page:  305      BUT is not BIBLICAL...JS made his own translation.      "As man is, God once was; as God is, man may become."     Author:  Lorenzo Snow   Source:  Gospel Through The Ages   Chapter:  43   Page:  105      AND    "Now, I would like to say a word or two about that Mormon truism, namely: "As man is, God once was, and as God is, man may become." Note that it is not to the effect that man will become, but man may become, and I wish to say that few men will become what God is. And yet, all men may become what he is if they will pay the price."     Author:  Melvin Joseph Ballard   Source:  Sermons and Missionary Services   Page:  238      SO Pay the Price??  To become as GOD is?     Thats crazy..|`|Kwfo0aRvaa	In order to understand the Mormon concept of salvation, one must know something of the LDS doctrine of eternal progression. Milton R. Hunter summarized this doctrine in G.T.A., pp. 126-129. He stated that we are as eternal as God Himself. But to achieve perfection and godhood, we must go through at least four stages of life:        1. In the first stage each of us were conscious eternally existing beings called "intelligences." In that realm, we experienced good and evil, love and hate, free agency and so on until we had completed our work there.        2. LDS do not explain how we progressed from "intelligences" to the pre-mortal spirit world where we were born as baby spirits to God and one of His wives by procreation. They just state that this is what happened. Nor do they explain how God, with a "body of flesh and bones as tangible as man's" (D. & C. 130:22), begets spirits instead of tangible bodies like he has!        LDS teach that in the pre-mortal spirit life Jesus, Lucifer, and all of us were the spirit children of God and His wives (G.T.A., pp. 15, 93-99; J. of D., Vol. XI, p. 122). Both Jesus and his brother, Lucifer, suggested plans of salvation to God the Father for this world we now inhabit. When Lucifer's plan was rejected, he rebelled and tried to usurp God's throne, but he was defeated by Jesus and those who followed Him. Lucifer and one third of the spirits in heaven who supported him were cast out of heaven to earth where they still tempt mortals to rebel against God.        Although LDS teach that we are all children of God, the Bible declares that we must become "children of God by faith in Christ Jesus" (John 1:12, Gal. 3:26). That is why Jesus said, "Ye must be born again" (John 3:7). The Bible teaches that those not born again are children of the devil (John 8:44, I John 3:10).        3. The third stage of Eternal Progression is our present mortal probation. None of the wicked pre-mortal spirits who followed Lucifer were privileged to get mortal bodies like we have. But, those "valiant" spirits who fought against Lucifer with Jesus Christ in heaven were given the best bodies of all - with white skins! However, some spirits did not fight valiantly against Lucifer. Those spirits were permitted to have bodies, but they were marked with black skins! They are born into this world in the ******* race as the sons of Cain and Ham. Because they were not valiant in pre-existence, they were cursed so that they could not hold the LDS "priesthood." Then on June 9, 1978, President Spencer W. Kimball announced that God had revealed to him that all worthy male members of all races could now hold the priesthood. President Kimball's "revelation" ended the curse of not having the priesthood, but it did not change the LDS doctrine of pre-existence nor remove the mark of the curse which Brigham Young said was "the flat nose and the black skin" (J. of D., Vol. VII, p. 290). Brigham went on to say, "That curse will remain upon them and they can never hold the priesthood or share in it until all the other descendants of Adam have received the promises and enjoyed the blessings of the Priesthood and the keys thereof" (Ibid., pp. 290-291). Since all of the other sons of Adam have not received the "blessings" of the LDS priesthood, either Brigham Young was a false prophet, or LDS President Kimball's "revelation" was not from God!        4. Mormonism teaches that when mortals die, their spirits go to a spirit prison which has two compartments. Good LDS people go to "paradise" (M.D. pp. 554-555). All others go to the other area which is often called "spirit prison" (M.D. pp. 754-755). Good LDS missionary spirits come from paradise to the spirit prison to preach the true LDS gospel. Most of the imprisoned spirits will accept the LDS message, but their personal salvation is not completed until proxy baptism, marriage and so on are done for them in an LDS temple on earth. Finally, after the millennium and final judgement, they will go to the degree of glory or heaven they have earned through obedience to the law (A. of F. pp. 147-148).  (Marvin Cowan, Mormon Claims Answered)    http://www.utlm.org/onlinebooks/mclaims1...    The Father has promised us that through our faithfulness we shall be blessed with the fulness of his kingdom. In other words we will have the privilege of becoming like him. To become like him we must have all the powers of godhood; thus a man and his wife when glorified will have spirit children who eventually will go on an earth like this one we are on and pass through the same kind of experiences, being subject to mortal conditions, and if faithful, then they also will receive the fulness of exaltation and partake of the same blessings. There is no end to this development; it will go on forever. We will become gods and have jurisdiction over worlds, and these worlds will be peopled by our own offspring. We will have an endless eternity for this. (Joseph Fielding Smith Jr., Doctrines of Sa|`|XmJZkFuMaa	No.      God created every person spiritually, we don't know how, and while we believe that nothing comes from nothing, we simply don't know.  We know that Heavenly Father has flesh and bone, but we don't know anything about whether He was resurrected or transfigured or what.  We know very little about His mortal existence...    After living for a time in the spirit world with Heavenly Father and Mother and Christ and everyone, a plan was given in which we would have the opportunity to gain a body and, through obedience, eventually have a body like Heavenly Father and Mother's bodies.  The resurrection was secured by Christ, and through Christ as a free gift everyone will have bodies eventually in the resurrection.  Nothing has to be done.  This is free to everyone.    What isn't free is returning to God's presence, since we all sin and only through Christ's atonement and our faith and works (faith without works is dead) showing we will follow Him will we get to that point.      We do believe we will be then given the opportunity to continue to progress... but we will NEVER be equal to God.  Any glory that we have will come from God's glory shining on us, His approval, and His authority.  And anything we become will be a testament and glory to God, not ours.      So that's close.  But not quite.
PKWHLbdfaa	Many Mormons quote Paul that the man is not without the woman, nor the woman without the man in the Lord...as a proof text for belief that men and women must be married eternally to inherit all that God has for them.  It sounds nice until you read Jesus saying that resurrected beings are "not married nor given in marriage."  No wiggle room there.    So yes, the LDS believe women need men, but you could equally argue that men need women per LDS doctrine.    Are women second class citizens in Mormondom?  Sure.  In July 1967, a Priesthood Bulletin prohibited women from praying in sacrament meeting.   This ban wasn't lifted until Dec 29,1978 when the LDS First Presidency allowed women to pray in sacrament meetings again.  In Oct 2,1988, Michaelene P Grassli, general Primary President, is first woman to speak in general conference in 133 years.  This isn't the case of ...men have their place, women have theirs, but clear discrimination.      The Bible speaks of women in many roles which for its times, was counterculture.  Mormonism in contrast is far behind the times.|`|LLmDQN7raa	Why yes, and they're absolutely positively right on that.|`|Kwfo0aRvaa	The LDS Church teaches that at the end of the world everyone will be resurrected. They also believe that almost everyone will go to heaven, which is divided up into three main levels.     Mormons will go to the highest level, the Celestial Kingdom (D&C 76:50-70). However, only those who merit the highest part of the Celestial Kingdom will have Eternal Life [the ability to live in a marriage relationship and continue to beget childrensee D&C 132:20-24.] All others have immortality [which is defined as the ability to live forever in a single condition, not married and no future children] but do not have Eternal Life.     One must be married in the LDS temple and then obey all of the Mormon regulations to get to the highest degree of heaven. The first time a Mormon attends the temple endowment ceremony he/she will be given a new name [usually a Bible name like Peter or Mary or the name of European royalty]. These will supposedly be their names in eternity. The wife must tell her husband her new name, and no one else, as he is supposed to call her up in the resurrection. If he does not call her up she would still resurrect, but not as his wife.     Interestingly, the Book of Mormon makes no mention of this important doctrine.  Nor does it mention of three levels of heaven.  This is despite Smith's claims that the Book of Mormon contains the 'fullness of the gospel' and is the 'keystone' of the Mormon religion.|`|XmJZkFuMaa	No.     First, women don't have the priesthood, men can't give birth.  We are taught there are spiritual gifts for women that men cannot have.  There is also a teaching that a woman who does not have a husband who has the priesthood who has no access to the priesthood can pray to the Holy Ghost to act with the priesthood, if there are no worthy men around her (like Deborah.)  A woman without a husband is actually in a much better position from church teachings than a man without a wife.     Second, we are judged as individuals.  A woman who lives a worthy life will be exalted, with or without her husband.     Third, as far as spirit children, there's never been any teaching that says we'll have the opportunity to have spirit children, but that we will have the opportunity to raise children who's parents weren't worthy.    Add:  Oh, another thing.  Someone said we all have to be home-makers.  Actually, that's a falsehood.  We are told that the greatest glory of being a woman is being a mother, and that whenever possible the mother should be home with the family even when it presents sacrifice.  However, there are plenty of times when that's not possible, and those women aren't in trouble.  One of my friends works (so does her hubby.)  Another of my friends, her hubby has health problems, so he is staying home with their children and she is working.  We are told, as women, to get as much education as we can in order to work if the need is there, and to empower ourselves by having workable job skills in this world.      Basically, when at all possible we're supposed to be mothers at home.  When there are no children at home, or the situation doesn't make it possible, then we are supposed to work.|`|WyICbuPqaa	Neither is a man without the woman, nor a woman without the man in the Lord.|`|5dd8eBDYaa	Jeez, they only just let blacks in.

Not the terminology I would use.     Are there any women in the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles/First Presidency etc?   No.     Were there any women included in the apostles that the Lord Jesus Christ called?       Women depend on men?   No more (Or less) than men depend on women.     When a man and women marry, they become one flesh.   So yeah...     Mormon in good standing?   We believe that we will be judged of our works and the desires of our hearts.   We also believe that God is a fair and just judge, and will "dish out" the justice & mercy that he sees fit.     If that makes sense.   Or not.   It's kosher.     For some reason I don't think you care about the answers. :]|`|ApyKiltXaa	Are you kidding?!    Look at the various answers.      The ex-mormons and individuals who aren't members have their own answer while the members who know the doctrines and principals have another.      If I asked a question about the United States...would I rely upon a voting citizen or Mahmoud Ahmadinejad (president of Iran)    I think the LDS know their own doctrine.     Elder John A. Widtsoe explained:     Men have no greater claim than women upon the blessings that issue from the Priesthood and accompany its possession.       The man holds the Priesthood, performs the priestly duties of the Church, but his wife enjoys with him every other privilege derived from the possession of the Priesthood. This is made clear, as an example, in the Temple service of the Church. The ordinances of the Temple are distinctly of Priesthood character, yet women have access to all of them, and the highest blessings of the Temple are conferred only upon a man and his wife jointly (Priesthood and Church Government [1965], 83).     Elder Bruce R. McConkie explained the companionship role of the priesthood and women: In the true Patriarchal Order man holds the priesthood and is the head of the household,  but he cannot attain a fulness of joy here or of eternal reward hereafter alone. Woman stands at his side a joint-inheritor with him in the fulness of all things. Exaltation and eternal increase is her lot as well as his. (D. & C. 131:14.) Godhood is not for men only; it is for men and women together. (D. & C. 132:1920) (Mormon Doctrine, 2nd ed. [1966], 844).|`|kA6Q8CROaa	Women receive the benefits of the priesthood with their husbands in the Temple; they are annointed as priestesses in their Temples.    "We do not rear children just to please our vanity. We bring children into the world to become kings and queens, priests and priestesses for our Lord."  Spencer W. Kimball|`|7y6yfrQlaa	yes|`|77b2610047fd4e5f740d75e96c9a88a2aa	Not quite.  The celestial kingdom is open to everyone.  The highest level of the celestial kingdom is for married couples.  So a man can't get there without a woman and a woman can't get there without a man.  I would say we depend on Christ to be saved, but exaltation is for married couples only.    As for the continuing to have spirit children, that is actually not a doctrine.  It's an opinion held by many but it is not doctrine.    EDIT:  And what glade said is true.|`|qPzxKhrlaa	Yes, women are not permitted the priesthood. Yes, a woman needs her husband to "lead her by the hand through the veil to the Celestial Kingdom". (The man is lead through the veil by God.) However, there are three levels of heaven (in Mormon mythology) and women without a husband to lead them through are probably allowed in one of the other two heavens.|`|dFBccLExaa	That's what I've understood to be true. My friend once gave me a reason why women can't be preists. I can't remember why, I just remember it was a load of crap.   I guess you can't reach the top level of heaven without a family- including children.   I thought it was a load of tripe, myself. Meant to keep women as breeding stock. Never cared for it.|`|7d16b3b33c15681f9d53425cac12ac67aa	Most of the answer pretty much explain it from the viewpoints from member and non and ex members.     I just want to add that a lot of people think that it isn't fair and why is it that other churches and denominations allow women to hold a priesthood but not the Mormon church.     LDS look at their church as the ancient Christian and ancient Jewish church. Did any of the women of that era hold the priesthood?     No, it was only given to the men. And only men were allowed to hold it. Why? Because that's who God said could hold it.     It is God's decision who can and who cannot hold his priesthood. A prime example of this can be found in the Old Testament when  God stated to Moses that only the children of Levi could hold the priesthood. So even then there was restrictions on who could hold the priesthood even back then.     Only God can determine who can hold his priesthood. And it is not up to man or women to determine who God says can hold His priesthood.     As others have mentioned women and men together as husband and wife hold a joint partnership together.     As for single women, as I am a single woman, we are to keep our faith, continue living the gospel to the best of our ability and the Lord will reward us for our dilligence. He's not going to ban a worthy woman from the Celestial Kingdom just because she could not find a husband. No, He has promised them that they will be given someone for their salvation.     Although I do hope that I will find a husband, I will not be punished or barred for any fault of my own for not finding a worthy LDS man to marry.|`|7948d322583be173cb825c04b51e58b2aa	I am LDS.  There are many different splitter groups that call themselves "Mormon" that have very different doctrines.    I am a member of the largest group (The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints) which has over 10 million members world wide, and is by far the largest group that are called "Mormons".    Some splitter groups ordain women to the priesthood (like the Community of Christ), however the LDS church does not.  Although women do not hold the priesthood, there many positions in the hierarchy of the Church including very broad callings that are only held by women, like the General Relief Society Presidency.  Other positions  held by women include various instructors, missionaries, service callings, and primary presidencies, young women presidencies, ward and stake relief society presidencies to name a few.    We consider women equal to men.  Women can receive every blessing of the priesthood.  We believe the Priesthood is a responsibility to provide service to others.  God told modern prophets that the priesthood is to only be given to worthy males.  Perhaps the reason why men hold the priesthood is that women serve others without being told to?  There is no one in the priesthood (or anyone else) that is payed for their position in the Church.    To answer your next question.  Men and women depend equally on each other for their eternal exaltation.  You should understand that the LDS concept of heaven and hell are quite different from most religions.  I don't have enough space to explain it all, but I will say that after people die we believe they either go to heaven or hell for a time.  There will come a time later that they will be resurrected, judged and all but a very few will be received into one of three heavens.  We believe that in order to achieve the highest degree of the highest heaven, a man and a women must be sealed in the temple.  However, if one of them is not worthy, then the one that is worthy will have the opportunity to be sealed to someone that is worthy.  We believe that a worthy man and women may have spirit children and become a God and Goddess over those children.  I consider this to be the most controversial belief between LDS members and other religions.|`|8Ak1FehYaa	Yes, but........................................ do have a women that is over all of the Relief society in all the LDS church, but...thst is all.|`|AA12383652	Nobody knows the actual technicalities of it all but you need to be sealed to an eternal spouse to be able to progress to the highest possibility which is to be like God.  Since God has the ability to create, progressing to be like God should include the ability to create, as well.    Woman do not receive the priesthood authority.  There are diff roles in the church for men and women, but both need each other and neither is higher than the other.|`|Qy4k1w1aaa	Woman cannot have the priesthood, cannot get into the highest level of heaven (called the Celestial Kingdom) unless their husband calls them through via their temple name, and are expected to have children and be stay-at-home moms.  The LDS Church is very sexist. They equate the opportunity of men having the priesthood (which allows them great power according to the Church) with women's opportunity to bear children. I never understood how having a capability which even rats have made up for women not having the power to call down God's will as needed).|`|oVHFz52Laa	Yes, this is what Mormons believe, and yet they still call themselves Christians|`|AA10637643	NO, you have put quite a spin on what we actually believe.    Men and women - husband and wife - need EACHOTHER in order to obtain exaltaion.  A man cannot without his wife, nor the woman without her husband.      IF both keep their covenants, their is hope of exaltation.  IF one or the other doesn't, I have no doubt the Lord will not withhold blessings the worthy person is entitled to.  He won't say "Sorry, your husband was bad so you don't get to be exalted."  It just won't work that way.  AND I *highly* doubt there will be those who only one of the two is worthy of it... but there could be, and we just have to have faith the Lord will take care of us.  There could be a few possibilites of what would actually happen but there is no doctrine.  There is only the doctrine that husband and wife can be joined eternally, and that is what we focus on.    *And women are not "barred" from the Priesthood.  Holding the Priesthood is a man's calling, just like being a mother is a woman's.  We all have divine roles and potential.  The men are typically the patriarch of the family/head of the household... but both are equal in the marriage.|`|2wUvFmrhaa	Yes it is.    Mormon Women receive the priesthood in the temple.   BUT  The important thing to understand here is that endowed women have the priesthood power, but have no office in the priesthood in which to exercize it.    In the past, endowed women could administer priesthood healing blessings to the sick. They also placed their hands on the heads of sick children along with their husbands during priesthood blessings. But these practices have been discontinued. Without office in the priesthood it's not clear what good the priesthood has in today's modern Mormon church, so women don't think they have it. But doctrinally speaking, endowed women have the *mormon*  priesthood.    http://www.exmormon.org/mormon/mormon157...    Mormon women are  told that, because they have the all important ability to bear children, men need the power of the priesthood merely to remain equal with them.  The most notorious example of Mormon treatment of women is, of course, the practice of polygamy. (and bigamy too)    In the temple marriage ceremony, women are given secret names known only to their husbands, for identification purposes, so their husbands can pull them through to "the other side" after death.    During the marriage ceremony, until 1990, men made their temple covenants directly to God, while the women had to make their temple covenants to their husbands, and promise to obey them.      After death, while their husbands are ruling over their "planet", the women have the questionable **honor** of bearing his "spirit children" for eternity. This is how they believe the LORD is doing it now.    Joseph Smith dangled the priesthood in front of the women in order to ensnare them into polygamy. Brigham Young tolerated the women practicing priesthood blessings.     Then at the turn of the century, a new crop of church leaders came in and started slapping down the women. Then in the 1970's, church correlation completely gutted the Women's organizations. Women have less influence and respect in the church now than before. Yet the old remains of empowered women still exists in parts of the church record.    Doctrinally speaking, **within mormonism**, women without men have no power of any kind.|`|q0gRmHlUaa	Mormon women do not hold the priesthood and they have a separate hierarchy.  In short, the men make the major decisions for the body of the LDS church.|`|1e86a17cf7d3d6bd5f1d1eb0376ee828aa	While I was in the Missionary Training Center (MTC) President Monson came and spoke to us. In his address he said something that I will remember for the rest of my life. He told us the reason that men hold the Priesthood and women do not.   He said that 'Women don't need it.' He went on to tell us that men needed the priesthood because they need an extra kick in the pants to get them looking in the right direction. He also mentioned that women are more naturally spiritually in-tune than men.   So in short God gave men the responsibility of holding the priesthood because we have a have a harder time listening to the Spirit with out it.

Learn the pronunciation of the letters. Then work on the numbers. Once you feel like you have those down work your way towards grammar. When you feel comfortable with the grammar then you can start to build up your vocabulary. Treat it as if you're starting kindergarten all over again. If you have a library card go to your local library and check out anything and everything you can that will benefit you in learning Spanish. If you don't have a library card, it's easy to get one and best of all they're free! There are also tons of free resources on the Internet. Just google "learn Spanish", "learning Spanish", "Spanish grammar", "Spanish verbs", "Spanish nouns", etc. Start listening to music in Spanish. Since you said you recently moved to an area where a lot of people speak Spanish, I'm guessing there are probably a few radio stations in Spanish so you could check those out. Also, check out the Spanish television channels. It's okay if you don't understand what you hear, because it's helping you hear native speakers and will help you greatly with pronunciation. I'm not sure how fast you want to learn or how fast you're able to learn, but if you follow these steps I think you could be able to do basic Spanish anywhere from 6 months to a year.|`|NBLH8XY4aa	find some college for like a yr.i am pretty sure thats available or make some friends who can teach u spanish.....get a tutor|`|ZIU0nI3faa	Take classes in your community.

LP56IpSwaa	You're not a smart-a**!  There are two really cool things to discover throughout life starting from this moment.    1) what is faith, where does it come from?  2) what does the adage "when one door closes..." mean to a non-religious person?    Faith comes from experiencing multiple paths in life and putting all your energy in one belief without "knowing" the truth. Just imagine that every logical path you choose feels like you are swimming upstream, then you find a spiritual community of love and support. At this time, you will say anything and everything to be included in the community.    As a grown-up, you find that persons of faith don't want to analyze or justify their choice, they just want you to accept their choice and give your support to them.    Regarding the parable, think of how many new opportunities you can discover and pursue when one door is closed that you never imagined before, IF you are not devastated and fixated on your loss.    When I learned about Mormons, I really learned religious tolerance and an enlightened view of religion.|`|0109ed0c62f90fd240f61d40fe8209acaa	Some people need proof, some just believe. I never liked the religion I was raised. I think I was meant to be what I am today. I have always been interested in fairy's and spirits and such., As a child I loved the talking tree in Pocahontas, and things like that. I feel as if it was meant to be. The Lord and the Lady have always taken care of me. They have always made sure I had my necessities.  You wouldn't turn your back on a friend who helps you out, so why would you do that to someone you worship? Whenever I have a problem, they take care of me. I know I can always lean on them to make sure things go as they are suppose to or according to what is needed, depending on how you view it. I wouldn't trust anyone better with my well being besides my husband and my family. I have the ultimate trust in them because they deserve it I don't know where I would be right now without faith. It is extremely important to me.|`|k03dYskYaa	I get my faith from the Bible. My life has improved so much from applying the principles found in the Scriptures. That has increased my faith. Also Bible prophecies that have already been fulfilled and ones that are currently being fulfilled strengthen my faith.  When the "door" so to speak of this wicked system of things closes, there will be a new one opened that will result in many blessings to faithful mankind. Look up Proverbs 2:21,22 and Revelation 21:1-4. There are many current blessings now also to enjoy from the comfort in drawing close to God.

To Christians, the triquetra has been used to symbolize the Holy Trinity (Father, Son & Holy Ghost) In fact, many cultures and religions have considered the number three to be holy or divine for millenia. A symbol of three interlocking circles looking somewhat like a three-leaf clover without out stem has been found on religious statues in India that were made 5000 years ago.
AA10100036	God doesn't hate you!  It sounds like you're just going through a rough patch.  Just keep in mind that everything changes, and this too shall pass.  That being said, yes, counseling sounds like a smart idea.  It certainly can't hurt!    Keep your chin up and good luck!|`|2G8lOPN8aa	Yes, you should have counseling. You sound very depressed.  Sometimes people have a chemical imbalance that causes depression and sometimes medication can help.       The teenage years can be very hard. I didn't enjoy them very much myself...but they are just a few years of your life and then you will have the world as your oyster...     First of--go to the guidance counselor at your school.  Tell him or her how you are feeling.  Tell the counselor that you would like to find out the steps you need to go through to transfer and that you also have been very stressed out and depressed and that you need a referral to a psychotherapist that works with teenagers to help you work through your issues.    After you've met with the guidance counselor and have some idea of what resources and options are available to you, sit down with your parents and tell them what is going on with you.  They may have no idea--but I know if my child were having such feelings of inadequacy I would want to know so I could help him before he did something rash.  Let them know that you've met with the guidance counselor and are taking some steps, and that you have asked for a referral to a psychotherapist. This will show your parents that you have some maturity about handling this situation--but also let them know that you are truly serious about feeling overwhelmed by your present situation.    God loves you... and those of us out here in Yahoo Answer land care too--or we wouldn't take the time to answer your question... Please go and see your guidance counselor at school tomorrow--they are trained to deal with this sort of issue and will take your situation seriously.    Good luck hun.|`|I6dcRgD6aa	your local library has a dvd called The Secret but it is not the movie is is by Rhonda Byrnes so make sure you get the right one. You can go on their website or call to get it ordered or if you can't get it you can always rent it somewhere or buy it. This will show that you have to stop having these beliefs...also do a search for Louise Hay who owns the largest self-helf publishing house called Hayhouse. She changed her life by changing her belief & you can also get her DVD Heal Your Life or You Can Heal Your Life...these will show you why the things have happened...actually, get Louise Hay's book "You Can Heal Your Life". it has all you need to know. Stop saying negative things in the meantime. Go back to what you wrote above & change it all to what you want instead.

I didn't go to councling or anything, the only friends i had started to hate me because i never smiled anymore, and my grades dropped so low it was ridiculious. And of course i felt like killing myself. I hated feeling depressed and i'm sorry you feel this way now. There are no words, but things always get worse before they get better. God doesn't hate you. he loves you and hes testing you. Without suffering there would be no compassion. Pray to God without any distractions and ask him to help other people before you pray for yourself and believe me, you will feel happy.  P.S, I will pray for you.|`|kMyZEEhNaa	"God" hates you because you're probably not managing yourself properly.    I don't do "God", so I would suggest getting some special therapy.

You may feel as though God is not there or not answering your prayers. But the truth is God does answer every prayer. It might just not be the answer you want it to be. Like "God let my parents Transfer me out of this school!" and then God may answer your prayer "No." See he does answer, but he also knows what is best for you. So maybe you don't like the school now, but you may  have a purpose there and just don't know it yet. Just wait it out, maybe God is still debating and your luck will change.       Everything will get better in time. If you feel you do need someone to talk to then yes, get counseling. It will definitely relieve stress and make you feel better.|`|1vxM2zofaa	well hun is advise u to get counseling, i mean life seem that way sometimes but soon u will have ur reward|`|9ceRmqUAaa	Your young most young people think like that life is hard but you have to stay focus, you know the other school is going to make you happy go you make your choices and you have to live with them but most of them you can fix just sit back and really think how you can fix your problems and do it, but god doesn't hate you i think he watching to see if we make the right choices.|`|6Dec7NFPaa	He doesn't God loves everyone|`|ahci6qGUaa	get a therapist man theres no shame in it and btw i have horrible luck too, my brother and my dad have had bad luck since they were kids and still do.

I was depressed for a while and it REALLY helped me.    Sometimes we hit rough patches in our lives, but you have to try and have a positive outlook because things will get better if you want them to. Slowly, but surely. And little by little.     God doesn't hate you, and he isn't punishing you for anything. We have to take responsibility for ourselves and ultimately WE are in control of our lives and our happiness. Bad things still happen, and you are put into circumstances which you don't want to be in, but it's all about how you react to a situation that helps you through it.    I want you to know that you will be ok, and things will get better. Go to counseling and get talking because thats where it starts getting better.   I heard somewhere that the universe works in perfect order, and that you are where you are right now for a reason. As strange as that might sound to someone who is in pain, when you come through to the other side you will be stronger and better than ever. Don't waste time wondering why this is happening to you, just take the wheel, and work on a better tomorrow.    All the best :)|`|AKnobm4laa	hey god doesnt hate you......though his signs take time for you to see i mean there is way more people that need help as well hey if u got some bad days listen to this song http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-iWdvdIE...     it helps me to clear my mind and clean out my stupid mistakes and gives me hope that i have another chance to fix my blurt(mistake).Or  just look for some signs and turn to the bible for answers.    well thats about as much as i can say, well say, and know to tell you good luck and find peace!|`|ofMV2sS5aa	I had a similar problem in 9th grade, too.  Sometimes it does seem like the world is ganging up on you. For the longest time i though it was God's fault too. But in the end it was not 'god' i was mad at more the problems that seemed to surround me. Hating a person or a god might alleviate some stress but in the end the energy you invest would be better used the solving problems that seed the hatred in the first place.   I'm not necessarily sure you need counseling unless you yourself feel up to it. You seem to have a good enough grasp on what the problem, is and the whole premise of counseling is discovering what's holding you back. You need to discover how to overcome this on your own, any councilor would tell you the same. About the suicide thing, the fact that you are trying to reach out shows a desire to live. I don't think you really want to die, perhaps you just need to get away for a while. A vacation to Cancun would be pretty awesome right about now.   Don't hate your self for mistakes, it is a waste of energy. If you are stuck at a lame school try to make the best of it. Buy a good joke book and try to build some friends with a good sense of humor. Even if you have an inverted cross tattooed on your face people will still laugh at a good 'your mamas so fat joke'.  If you still need to cheer up download some good music, i get mine from Mp3 raid.com or you could just type in something on Youtube. Try Theory of a deadman- Hate my life, don't let the title fool you it can be a pretty good cheererup.   Good luck, i wish you the best (I mean it),  ~K8|`|ba450548ec13ce7a3711c94421c92d4aaa	You should go to your family doctor and tell him what you just told us. The reason for depression could be anything from circumstances to hormones. Please do something about the way you feel, I know this sounds harsh, but don't make it everyone else's problem. The people who love you will just get even more frustrated and in turn, you will feel more hopeless because you will not be working toward an answer.     Depression in women runs in my family, and as the only not depressed woman, even I have asked myself the same thing, does God hate me? I also have wondered if I was cursed. The thing is, none of those things are true. All problems are temporary, they go away in time. Instead of feeling like crap about all of this, try to figure out a way to transfer into the other school. If you can't, then try to make the best of it at the one you're stuck in. It seems like in my life, so far, everything has gone wrong, but instead of sit around crying about it, I just work to find ways to change it.     Depression is serious, but you are responsible for you own mental health. If you can go to counselling, go, and talk to your doctor. Also, if you feel like you might hurt yourself you can call 911, most people don't know this, but it's considered an emergency and they will know how to help.|`|OMW2LftJaa	Just give it time and keep praying. My best friend went through what it sounds like your going through about a month ago. He said he never felt the way he did then.

Then finally God just picked him up. but before that God told him he was going to put him through a trial. Well he did and my friend never gave up. So don't Give up.

Ao52XHjCaa	I'm assuming that you are in a college dorm, since the only type of bed that is 1 1/2 ft from the ceiling is an upper bunk bed or loft. I'm also assuming that he is a relative stranger to you. (Sounds like my freshman year, by the way). With that in mind, the answer is no, you do not need to tell him you are bi. He is not among the group of people who need to know.     While it is great if you can be friends with your college roommate, what is more important is that you get along and are cordial and respectful to each other. That does not mean you need to be open about everything. Save that openness for your friends and confidants. There's no need to issue a warning when you don't yet know if you will be bringing back a guy to the room yet.     There's no need to hide, either...if he pays attention to you, there is a good chance that he'll figure you out eventually and just deny what he knows or start to drop hints that he wants to talk about it. Its hard to explain, but it is possible to be out and closeted at the same time-where the issue is "known" and "known to be known" but neither discussed nor denied. I'd shoot for that situation with a "relative stranger" roommate who I have to live with in close quarters. If I were you, I'd worry more about whether the guy will pick up after himself at this point.|`|iQ13PoEiaa	NO! don't do it. don't tell him. let him find out on his own. if you tell him, he may think that you want something more than just someone to live with.|`|LCCsJ62Saa	You don't have to tell him anything.

Good luck!  ;-)|`|b371fd5225e0f0948944cb7d323618b7aa	on one hand it sucks to have people take off on you like you have a problem... but in reality they have the problem and i think what you do is based on this. if you want to be friends with your room mate then he might as well know and if he moves out then you know off the bat you don't need to be friends with him. if you want to treat him like a drone living with you then just don't ever talk to him :P    i am thinking the subject will come up eventually though if you are living together.|`|5RALqmcJaa	No don't tell him.I have a feeling that he might move out too.|`|d8ox561maa	What's the purpose for giving him this knowledge?

You shouldn't have to hide who you are with people you live with. If he doesn't like it, find someone else who will accept you for who you are. If he does decide to move out, make sure that you let a person know this BEFOREHAND.    Also, when you tell him, let him know that you're not interested in him in that sort of way. Just to clarify.    The thing is if you hide it from him, he's bound to find out one way or another someday. And wouldn't that be worse? He might think you never told him because you had a thing for him or something...I think you're better of telling the truth.|`|sjbB8685aa	I don't have an answer for ya, but here's a story I want to share w/ you.    Last year, I had a roommate who acted like a homophobe and all he ever did was talk about how he didn't want a homo for a roommate, little did he know that his buddy, aka me, was sexually confused back then, yeah, skip 4 months, I find out I'm actually straight, and he had a crush on me.................I moved out after the first semester and instead bought my own place.....|`|AA12006309	Do you need to tell him?  It's your sex life, and he's not a part of it, so it's really none of his business.  Unless you're going to be bringing male partners to your room, I don't think it's really an issue.  It's really not his concern who you're spending your alone time with.|`|JgNMqaPmaa	i wouldn't (it would be soo cool if he was asking this 2 lol) im just wondering is he cute lol|`|4paG6PmUaa	don't tell him.let him know by his own way so that he won't be shock by you.if you tell him he will move out.if he find out by himself he will think twice to move out.even if he leave there is no problem with that right.it's not like that you actually like him.just let him move out.there no reason for you to keep him as your roommate.Good luck!|`|ca4ed140a6433f60bc05c2d63b2e498eaa	Why do you think he would care?
5f829f3cc7e746009b4310bce91453d4aa	Atheism is lack of belief, not a definitive denial.  No  A + theis opposite of a theist    Theist=one that beleives in a God or gods.    Thus an Atheist is one that beleives there is no God or gods.  It is a definitive denial of the existence of God.    An Agnostic (Ignorant or unknowing) as in "di agnostic"    You don't get to redefine atheism.    drew r  is corect that an atheist must claim omniscience for his ponit to be valid.     Agnostics have an irrefutable "I don't know" no one can question ones claim of ignornece on a matter for we all know that we are selves are ignorant of most of the things and or potental things that may or may not exist in the universe.  One may be willfully ignorant or not ignorant and lying however. In any event it is the lack of a position and not a position in and of itself.       Theist=one that beleives in a God or gods.  They claim knowlege of God base on Revelation (Prophets, Bible, Quaran ect.) and God's self evidence in the Natural world.  I would like to talk about the latter.    The argument:    If the universe is wearing out and the very elements that make up the Cosmos are being transformed into heat from matter in the passing of time, and it is.  See: Entrope   And it is also true that we live in a cosmos of mater and not heat only (Energy can't be destroyed just transformed) and it is also true that objects at rest tend to rest and objects in motion tend to stay in motion then we can deduse that we are being reasonable in our asumption that the universe both had a begining and that without a creator to set said cosmo in motion i.e. the creation or "big bang" (I don't subscribe to the big bang theory myself.)  The nessesity of a creator over a force.  If the philosphical school of gradualism is correct the big bang should never had bang at all, for at rest it would have stay at rest and if in motion than not at rest (i.e. the condencing of all the matter in the univer in a baseball or pinhead side area.) Thus the requirement for a force from without the cosom (Space, time ect.) Add this view to the Bible (revalation). and we have conformation what we see and or reason and a revalation telling us the same and more.  i.e. what this God is like and what he requires of us and that is as follows:    Start a relationship with your creator!!!!!!!!    The ROMANS ROAD....is a pathway you can walk.    It is a group of Bible verses from the book of Romans in the New Testament. If you walk down this road you will end up understanding how to be saved.    Romans 3:23 "For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God."  We all have sin in our hearts. We all were born with sin.  We were born under the power of sin's control.  - Admit that you are a sinner.    Romans 6:23a "...The wages of sin is death..."  Sin has an ending. It results in death. We all face physical death, which is a result of sin. But a worse death is spiritual death that alienates us from God, and will last for all eternity. The Bible teaches that there is a place called the Lake of Fire where lost people will be in torment forever. It is the place where people who are spiritually dead will remain.  - Understand that you deserve death for your sin.    Romans 6:23b "...But the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."  Salvation is a free gift from God to you! You can't earn this gift, but you must reach out and receive it.  - Ask God to forgive you and save you.    Romans 5:8, "God demonstrates His own love for us, in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us!"  When Jesus died on the cross He paid sin's penalty. He paid the price for all sin, and when He took all the sins of the world on Himself on the cross, He bought us out of slavery to sin and death! The only condition is that we believe in Him and what He has done for us, understanding that we are now joined with Him, and that He is our life. He did all this because He loved us and gave Himself for us!  - Give your life to God... His love poured out in Jesus on the cross is your only hope to have forgiveness and change. His love bought you out of being a slave to sin. His love is what saves you -- not religion, or church membership. God loves you!    Romans 10:13 "Whoever will call on the name of the Lord will be saved!"  - Call out to God in the name of Jesus!    Romans 10:9,10 "...If you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised Jesus from the dead, you shall be saved; for with the heart man believes, resulting in righteousness, and with the mouth he confesses, resulting in salvation."  - If you know that God is knocking on your heart's door, ask Him to come into your heart.    Jesus said,    Revelation 3:20a "Behold I stand at the door and knock, if anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in to him..."  - Is Jesus knocking on your heart's door?    Believe in Him.    Ask Him to come in to your heart by faith, and ask Him to reveal Himself to you.    Open the Bible to the Gospel of John and read what God says about Jesus, about you, and about being born again.    God will help you. He loves you.    You need to look for a local church where God's word is preached. The Bible says that we are to desire God's word like a newborn baby desires mother's milk.    Aren't you hungry to know the truth?    Water baptism is one of the ways you first show that you have been joined to Jesus. This is an action, and actions will not save you. However, it is an act of obedience and a symbol of commitment.    The symbolism is this:    When you go down in the water you show that   You have been crucified and buried with Him,  And when you |`|HdmlZdyHaa	There is God an definitive statement|`|gGmMw2vDaa	Not really. Do you know everything that you say with 100% certainty? Or, do you wonder if Thor is the one true god, and the FSM, and the pink unicorn? The statement itself implies not believing there to be any reasonable probability, not necessarily an accurate knowledge of no possibility. Who would bother denying all of the fairies that some people believe in?|`|i0OVwfcyaa	I guess no one can say there is no invisible pink unicorn either....

People need something to believe in and depend on. Since we as humans are flawed, we can never fully depend on each other without being let down. God is seen as a perfect being and no matter what he will be there for those people that want Him in their lives. We can depend on Him when no one else is there for us. We have faith that He is always with us, guiding us. You can choose to believe whatever you want. No one can technically prove that there is or isn't a God, but it will sure be interesting to see what happens to all of the non-believers when they pass away.|`|b7ae34ab971653d02308ce805affb7baaa	1st you must define "God" or the statement is useless.

"I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life, no man comes to the Father but by Me." John 14:6|`|QoenvlFuaa	I believe there is one true God, that Jesus Christ is His Son who came to earth to teach and then to die for man's sins, that through His death we can have salvation (a relationship with God and Eternity with Him in Heaven) if we believe all this and repent of our sins and live for Him (sharing the Gospel with others, being kind and doing good, keeping the Ten Commandments, etc).|`|Z0Vds9oCaa	There is no God.|`|3qqvFEsHaa	There is no god.  There is not a shred of evidence of a god anywhere, so until one shows up I wont believe in one.    I recommend "The God Delusion" as it attempts to answer this question using the scientific method.|`|KszocgnSaa	I think theres a God up there *points to sky* and I think everything happens for a reason. I'm sure God loves everyone and made everyone the way they are for a particular reason. I'm sure everyone has a purpose even if its a horrible one, like to rape some kid and make a life hell. Or maybe there purpose is a good one and they will inspire thousands of people. :)|`|xsZfN0JHaa	I believe in whatever I think God could be! Even at times I think there is no god to believe in. I still try to create a god to believe in.
gmaCvh00aa	I see some people had questions about the validity of your statement so I will just back you up here.    Yes, I remember reading those portions years and years ago and I've mentioned it to other people here and there and they didn't remember this at all.    Most people read the abridged and sanitized version, that's why.  But Anne Frank wrote those words.  She was what, 12?|`|GMFXD1ENaa	Does it not mean anything to you that the poor girl was a Holocaust victim who was dehumanized and murdered by the Nazis? And you're going to attack people's religious beliefs at the expense of her dignity? You should be ashamed of yourself.|`|UqhApIvHaa	I red the play and didn't see that.... plus she was a jew not christian|`|869a923e153dd118c958218801d84b78aa	Anne Frank was a JEW.

Sick question, tho|`|Qy4k1w1aaa	Since you just made up this section and pretend that it's Anne Frank's writings your question is completely pointless!!!|`|zfFjKhJJaa	Oh wow...That mere statement is tearing my faith in God away.  You have shattered the foundations of reality with your trenchant wisdom    *snickers*|`|jX6qoxaJaa	Anne Frank was a Jew....      And, I think it's really cool that she wrote that in her diary. I remember reading it and being able to relate to the feeling.|`|6938f354823450032243cd5ddb6f0ef0aa	why should it have any effect on Christians?    As a lesbian, I don't think it really means she had lesbian fantasies so much as she was bisexual, as reflected by her passages reflecting males.     Why does there need to be religious import?|`|xdqSp48Jaa	Why does it matter?  Anne Franke and her fantasies are long gone.....if God can forgive her past.....why should it matter to others?|`|ZJ2k7Ynqaa	I don't remember reading that part, but it was a long time ago.  I have heard it said that some  adolescents have such fantasies but that they usually outgrow them.|`|806025c44dd8e27b6c1d544348b087c0aa	I don't recall reading that before.   She was a young girl who lived in a different time, and under extremely adverse conditions.  She also wrote alot about a boy.    It's normal for preteens and early teens to have same-gender fantasies and exploration.|`|Z0Vds9oCaa	Hmm source?    I'm an atheist and of course have no problems with the idea of her being a lesbian but I just want to make sure you're not just trying to rile up the Christians.    EDIT: If found some questionable sources but for the sake of argument (if..there is an argument?) I see nothing wrong with that idea. Of course I'm an atheist though.|`|AA11640108	People are just...people.    I imagine that some Christians would be offended, but others will not even notice.|`|LJ6vHfgoaa	She was a young girl exploring her sexuality.|`|fEkKuGlEaa	I've read of that before. She may have had lesbian tendencies, but she also liked a certain boy very much. It's not unusual for girls entering puberty to be aroused by such things as the sight of a beautiful female body.     I think her life and what it meant and how it was cut short means much more than wanting to touch her friend's breast. That's nothing new for teenaged girls.|`|84nXWNT3aa	The same way I feel about heterosexual fantasies . . .?|`|jOwH96wKaa	LMAO WTF.    Ahem, I mean, lesbian fantasies are only ok when both of the chicks are hot.    Anne Frank was just a little girl man, totally inappropiate...pft|`|i835yPPGaa	Why does it matter to christians? Wasn't Anne Frank a jew?|`|K24JFTOcaa	why are you asking us?|`|21e2df8fa47efbcd44eaee35a303bd20aa	before you start trying to make a point... at least get your facts straight... she was Jewish.   besides.... what does it matter what gender someone is attracted to?|`|jW0VqZcOaa	You're a freak.    It's a personal diary, and she's dead.  It's none of your damned business.
9ceRmqUAaa	I can agree somewhat and disagree i can see where people are coming from when they do some of the things they do, but im sure they know they are in the wrong they just have to say something about getting in trouble, but if that's the only thing you know you stay with what you know. And really that's not what a hater is its a person or a group of people who talk sh** about people who mean mug you who trys to start fights things of that nature with no real reason at all for the bullsh** .|`|CuhJRewLaa	thats the only life that most of them know because they really didnt have a choice    and when you come up and find that they dont live like you do    well, i also can tell by your tone in the question, that you really do hate them to some degree|`|CwqW45Rmaa	Nah, you're no hater. I totally feel the same way.|`|ls3yha9Paa	you're different from other haters because you see the hatred in you. Other haters don't. They just do hating without realizing what they are doing. Your hatred has something to do with your past maybe. Usually during early childhood (about 5-9 years old) hatred was conceived without your awareness of it. Only forgiveness, acceptance, and love can cover it up or even erased it.     I know I'm answering your question beyond what your asking, but attending church and knowing God personally in your life will help you released from that bondage of hatred. Read Galatians 5:22-23  in the Bible. You can find that verse on the web.

EmOnt7FIaa	I LOVE Yahoo Answers, it's amazing how a website like this can have such a strong sense of community. There's really a place for everyone here. A loser troll can make multiple accounts and ask racist questions, a more serious person can become a Top Contributer and ultimately make "The Leaderboard", which in not easy. You can make little cartoon avatars and be whoever you want to be (well, if you want to, but I always just be and act like myself)    You can communicate with so many different people and ask them questions, you can add people to your contacts and fans, if you want. (I don't allow anybody to be in my Contacts or Fan's, I need my privacy  :)   )    It's free and easy to sign up for.    I know i sound like an marketer but this is how I feel.  I just love it, I don't know why.|`|92iuiuZKaa	LOL. because it's drama and thats what people like|`|VmSKQ40Caa	Your idiocy amuses me, everyone and anyone can think for themselves, it is just that sometimes, we need others opinions or advise because although we can think, the answer is not squarely in front of us. This is a great site because it has a strong community of nice, helpful people, but at the same time we have those jokers who post funny questions and answers who always give me a good laugh. Furthermore, you say that we can not think for ourselves, when you can not even spell at all! When I read what you have typed you seem like some stupid little kid or teenager who has come online to make  yourself look like a total loser, which you are.|`|ncdTxID9aa	Had a bad day?

dZMHd5PMaa	I think no matter what religion or group of people you talk to are going to have a difference stance. I know christians who are against,for, or are on the fence. Like me personally it isn't an option for me and I don't support it, but at the same time who am I to judge someone who thinks it's the right situation for them. I don't know their circumstances or anything else. As far as I am concerned it is between them and God and not anyone elses decision|`|FGcwxZz0aa	Yes, otherwise they commit a mortal sin which is the support of murder. God bless!    In Christ  Fr. Joseph|`|6ZI1hx99aa	Abortion is Murder, Murder is Sin, Sin separates man from God|`|W7DhZSy3aa	mmmm.... i am christian and i am against it..... it causes too much heartache to be okay to do..... your unborn baby does feel pain when it is ripped to peices by a vaccume and thrown away.... the lord may have had an awsome plan for that baby. adoption is a better plan. i think abortion is sad, i know people who have had them and are so emotionally crushed by it all there lives... its not worth it...|`|3keMgQCZaa	I am not a religious person, but I still think abortion is inhuman.|`|BYTrrqN6aa	All? Certainly not- there are those who are unique and have their own opinions, even within a belief system.|`|M3sVQm2Maa	Apparently not. I used to work at an abortion clinic and there were plenty of Christian patients.|`|1g49KgoGaa	No, just like not all atheists are pro-choice.  Just the majority|`|3aVxJYf6aa	Yes.......all of us.....despite our differences|`|3DjUX8etaa	No, not all are. I for one believe there are medical instances that abortion is needed. For example if the mother is at risk of her life, or if in the case of multiple babies, one or more are at risk as well. I just don't believe convenience to be an acceptable reason.   God Bless!  +?+|`|05ff5bb18eb4c096ef430ca99d7dad2daa	Being for or against abortion is a personal choice, not the religious community view point. I am against it unless it is an extreme, life threatening situation or special circumstance (like rape resulting in pregnancy). For me, it's more of a moral standing but my mom, same church, everything, is totally for it being legal and the woman's choice. There is no one answer to this, just personal opinions.|`|lh2hEzoMaa	No. i am morally, but not legally if that make seance to you.|`|zYAQrnjcaa	I don't know. I don't think you can really generalize any group of people like that, but I know a lot of Christians are against it, myself included.|`|cDpu1Dxyaa	No.|`|uz9GtV9vaa	Definitely not.  I've known plenty of pro-choice Christians.  Half of Americans are pro-choice.|`|I199P9yMaa	If they are truly Christians, then yes,they would be against abortion.  The Christian faith dictates that from the moment of conception comes a human being with a soul, and ending the life of that human being would be murder, thus going against "thou shalt not kill" in the ten commandments.|`|Nu6HaIfgaa	I can't tell you. I can only speak for myself and those I know.     I know Christian are suppose to believe the bible, and the bible is clear on the sanctity of life.
7oetZ4I3aa	i am personally a atheist, so i think all religion is total bullshit, but my point of view will probably be different then most because my grandparents (who live with me) are muslim <br>  <br>  1) i personally think the faith isn't what everyone makes it out to be, it's actually very impressive how peaceful true muslims are, and how much they actually practice there religion, <br>  <br>  2) no it hasn't at all, i don't think faith has much to do with 9/11 at all if anything it should be against christians since majority of the us is christian so why would the all mighty god of theres send people to bomb them?<br>  <br>  like i said before, when i speak against religion it to all religions, but all in all most muslims i personally know are actually better the people then christians|`|gGmMw2vDaa	I have a very low opinion of islam. It did not get much worse post 9/11. The faith is terrible. It is demanding, judgmental, and tries to turn its followers into slaves. Even the name islam reflects that meaning. I have nothing against followers in general, but why would anyone volunteer to be a slave? That makes me suspicious of them. On the other hand, islam is not much worse than christianity.|`|TzY9vkinaa	1) I don't know anything about muslims. I had a friend who is Muslim, she was nice and kept her standards high.<br>  2) no, but I don't like terrorists.|`|eLbrMleWaa	1 They are people. Some are nice. Some are mean, generalizing fundies.<br>  <br>  2 Before a few years ago I had no idea what islam was or christianity or judaism or any other religion. 9/11 happened when I was in like 3rd grade. I'm 16 now. So no it really hasn't changed because the muslims that crashed the planes are not the same ones I know now...|`|zq8s9gtwaa	Muslims when they integrate whilst keeping ties with their faith ? Brilliant<br>  Islam as a faith ? If im being absolutely honest with you and not honey coating my words ? I dislike the content of the Quran. <br>  <br>  9/11 changed nothing in my mind.<br>  <br>  To sum up i like all of my Muslim peers and friends but  i dislike Islam in general...We don't really talk about religion anyway there are more important things than a persons faith when choosing friends.|`|Nsh3lVDPaa	I respect Islam much. I wish I was Muslim.|`|eOBq4PHOaa	1. What is your general opinion of the faith, the followers of the faith and the laws and commandments? <br>  <br>  To each his own, I believe it is misunderstood like most religions.<br>  <br>  2. Has it changed post 9/11? Or upon what circumstances has it changed (if it has)? <br>  <br>  I don't believe it has, Just narrow mind ppl wnt to associate it w terrorism.|`|AA11336384	I'm kinda Muslim (I was born Muslim, but I'm partially Atheist/Agnostic), so I will try not to be too biased on other side.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>   People didn't like Muslims before, but I think it heightened after 9/11. Most people assume terrorists are Muslims (the whole "Most Muslims Aren't Terrorists, but Most Terrorists Are Muslim" crap), but there are plenty of non-stereotypical/racists.<br>  <br>  <br>  I think that most followers of faith are pretty normal in relation to another religion such as Christianity (except keeping halal and having the hijab), but like in Judaism and Christianity, it's a bit outdated in some terms.<br>  <br>  I think it's pretty idiotic to say just Muslims submit to God... Christians often say they'd do ANYTHING for Jesus and God. Submission can also be a varying term- maybe submission for some people is just acknowledging Allah exists, but maybe for the crazies, it's to blow yourself up for God. I doubt he'd be happy about that, though.|`|EhLpwHNnaa	It is a religion. I don't exactly agree with some of basic sets of beliefs (I'm a Christian).  I've known a few Muslims, and you know, they're people. Just like anyone else, except that we follow different systems of beliefs. I've read a few books about Islam, and I find it interesting, though a bit confusing at times.<br>  <br>  I don't like terrorists, of course. But it's so stupid that people think all Muslims are bombers and murderers and such of the like. It's like when people say all Christians are religious zealots and hypocrites.|`|AA11937917	1. Almost every Muslim I've ever known has been a nice, decent person. I'm not too keen on monotheism and all its baggage (it makes no sense to me); to me spirituality is to innately diverse and subjective to ever fit one rulebook. I also see the teachings of any prophets as placebos for personal spirituality, just as asking someone else's permission to have a favorite food or color would be.<br>  <br>  2. Not really. I'm more likely to challenge ignorant anti-Muslim remarks since 9/11. That's about it.|`|AA11379269	A provocative but very relevant question, especially in light of the UN trying to mandate a "Religious-mouth-gagging" through a bill proposed mainly by non-democratic, authoritarian, Islam nations. HA??!! It's an anti-heresy law basically. Well, isn't that perverse...those who blow other "infidels" to bits in the name of their religion want that religion protected against criticism of any kind! Then, no-less, they want to force us to somehow respect that? Again, HA??!! My Solution is an eye for an eye then...since both religions seem to share that mentality. You blow us up, we blow you to bits...no heresy there...since both believe in it...right Islam folks??
ah9ewUaUaa	Here I can try and get you started off some good pronouncation:     zhong(4) (meaning middle)= zh(clench teeth, tongue tipping top teeth) -ong (like hong kong, the "ong" sound)      xie(4)  (xiexie means thank you)= ssshh- ee eh (that really fast)    qung = no such word... in mandarin....  i think you mean  qing(3) (meaning please)= chh yee ing    shui(3) (meaning water) = (technically the ui should be uei, but it is shorten for convience) shhh way    shei(2) (meaning who) = shh Eyy (Ey you. that ey.

qxu6sK3yaa	1 Co 7:29-33   7:29But this I say, brethren, the time is short: it remaineth, that both they that have wives be as though they had none; 7:30And they that weep, as though they wept not; and they that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as though they possessed not; 7:31And they that use this world, as not abusing it: for the fashion of this world passeth away. 7:32But I would have you without carefulness. He that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord: 7:33But he that is married careth for the things that are of the world, how he may please his wife. 7:34There is difference also between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she that is married careth for the things of the world, how she may please her husband. 7:35And this I speak for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is comely, and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction. 7:36But if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward his virgin, if she pass the flower of her age, and need so require, let him do what he will, he sinneth not: let them marry. 7:37Nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his heart, having no necessity, but hath power over his own will, and hath so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin, doeth well. 7:38So then he that giveth her in marriage doeth well; but he that giveth her not in marriage doeth better. 7:39The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth; but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord. 7:40But she is happier if she so abide, after my judgment: and I think also that I have the Spirit of God.|`|gAzb5PAbaa	It's impossible for time to stand still.|`|832afebcbee1591334fabefd758d12c8aa	There is an account in the book of Joshua (10:12-13) where Joshua calls to his God Jehovah and asks that the sun be made to stand still so he could defeat his enemies.

AA11796124	There is only One God - and He does not approve of artificial contraception:    Gen 1:28, 9:1,7; 35:11 - from the beginning, the Lord commands us to be fruitful ("fertile") and multiply. A husband and wife fulfill God's plan for marriage in the bringing forth of new life, for God is life itself.    Gen. 28:3 - Isaac's prayer over Jacob shows that fertility and procreation are considered blessings from God.     Gen. 38:8-10 - Onan is killed by God for practicing contraception (in this case, withdrawal) and spilling his semen on the ground.     Gen. 38:11-26 - Judah, like Onan, also rejected God's command to keep up the family lineage, but he was not killed.     Deut. 25:7-10 - the penalty for refusing to keep up a family lineage is not death, like Onan received. Onan was killed for wasting seed.     Gen. 38:9 - also, the author's usage of the graphic word "seed," which is very uncharacteristic for Hebrew writing, further highlights the reason for Onan's death.     Exodus 23:25-26; Deut. 7:13-14 - God promises blessings which include no miscarriages or barrenness. Children are blessings from God, and married couples must always be open to God's plan for new life with every act of marital intimacy.     Lev.18:22-23;20:13 - wasting seed with non-generative sexual acts warrants death. Many Protestant churches, which have all strayed from the Catholic Church, reject this fundamental truth (few Protestants and Catholics realize that contraception was condemned by all of Christianity - and other religions - until the Anglican church permitted it in certain cases at the Lambeth conference in 1930. This opened the floodgates of error).     Lev. 21:17,20 - crushed testicles are called a defect and a blemish before God. God reveals that deliberate sterilization and any other methods which prevent conception are intrinsically evil.     Deut. 23:1 - whoever has crushed testicles or is castrated cannot enter the assembly. Contraception is objectively sinful and contrary, not only to God's Revelation, but the moral and natural law.     Deut. 25:11-12 - there is punishment for potential damage to the testicles, for such damage puts new life at risk. It, of course, follows that vasectomies, which are done with willful consent, are gravely contrary to the natural law.     1 Chron. 25:5 - God exalts His people by blessing them with many children. When married couples contracept, they are declaring "not your will God, but my will be done."     Psalm 127:3-5 - children are a gift of favor from God and blessed is a full quiver. Married couples must always be open to God's precious gift of life. Contraception, which shows a disregard for human life, has lead to the great evils of abortion, euthanasia, and infanticide.     Hosea 9:11; Jer. 18:21 - God punishes Israel by preventing pregnancy. Contraception is a curse, and married couples who use contraception are putting themselves under the same curse.     Mal. 2:14 - marriage is not a contract (which is a mere exchange of property or services). It is a covenant, which means a supernatural exchange of persons. Just as God is three in one, so are a husband and wife, who become one flesh and bring forth new life, three in one. Marital love is a reflection of the Blessed Trinity.     Mal. 2:15 - What does God desire? Godly offspring. What is contraception? A deliberate act against God's will. With contraception, a couple declares, "God may want an eternal being created with our union, but we say no." Contraception is a grave act of selfishness.     Matt. 19:5-6 - Jesus said a husband and wife shall become one. They are no longer two, but one, just as God is three persons, yet one. The expression of authentic marital love reintegrates our bodies and souls to God, and restores us to our original virginal state (perfect integration of body and soul) before God.     Matt. 19:6; Eph. 5:31 - contraception prevents God's ability to "join" together. Just as Christ's love for the Church is selfless and sacrificial, and a husband and wife reflect this union, so a husband and wife's love for each other must also be selfless and sacrificial. This means being open to new life.     Acts 5:1-11 - Ananias and Sapphira were slain because they withheld part of a gift. Fertility is a gift from God and cannot be withheld.     Rom.1:26-27 - sexual acts without the possibility of procreation is sinful. Self-giving love is life-giving love, or the love is a lie. The unitive and procreative elements of marital love can never be divided, or the marital love is also divided, and God is left out of the marriage.     1 Cor. 6:19-20 - the body is the temple of the Holy Spirit; thus, we must glorify God in our bodies by being open to His will.     1 Cor. 7:5 - this verse supports the practice of natural family planning ("NFP"). Married couples should not refuse each other except perhaps by agreement for a season, naturally.     Gal. 6:7-8 - God is not mocked for what a man sows. If to the flesh, corruption. If to|`|yQNit56Qaa	Well, as I'm sure you know, you've got the proverbial "wrong end of the stick"...    There is only one God among Christians...    However, different Christians (quite naturally) believe differently about what God has decided is right and wrong.  Why?  Because God has not sent us a list of "all bad things" and "all good things" for every situation.  Some people think that God is OK with man-made contraceptives.  Roman Catholics and some other Christian sects believe that God would not approve of the use of such things.    Whether or not God disapproves of man-made contraceptives is a matter of faith.  It is a subjective determination of what God disapproves - not a ruling written by God himself on a stone tablet that descended from heaven.    Christians have to make the same sort of determinations about a huge array of moral issues.  For example:  war.  Is it right to kill your fellow men with the defense of your country as an excuse?  Some (Jehovah's Witnesses, 7th Day Adventists, Quakers) say "no, it's never OK".  Others say, "it's OK as long as it's really in self-defense".  Interestingly, most of those who say "it's not OK" say that it's OK to kill someone in your *own* defense or in the defense of your family (in cases of imminent danger)!      So, as I'm sure you know, it's one God, different conclusions about what he considers to be right and wrong.

The Bible says that all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God (Rom. 3:23).  That means that your sins have caused a separation between you and God (Isaiah 59:2) and the result is death (Rom. 6:23) and wrath (Eph. 2:3).  The only way to be saved from the wrath of God, is to be saved from it by faith in Christ (Eph. 2:8-9; Rom. 5:1).  You must trust in what Jesus did on the cross to forgive you of your sins and not trust anything else, not even your own sincerity or works.  It is Jesus and only Jesus who can turn away the righteous judgment of God upon the sinner.   The Gospel    The gospel is that Jesus died for sinners on the cross, was buried, and rose from the dead (1 Cor. 15:1-4).  His death was a sacrifice that turns away the wrath of God (1 John 2:2).  This is the only way to be saved.    Jesus is the one who died for the sins of the world (1 John 2:2).  He is the only way to the God the Father (John 14;6).  He alone reveals God (Matt. 11:27).  He has all authority in heaven and earth (Matt. 28:18).  It is only through Him that you can be saved from God's wrath (Eph. 2:3).  He can forgive you of your sin (Luke 5:20; Matt. 9:2).  He can remove the guilt that is upon your soul.  Jesus can set you free from the bondage of sin that blinds your eyes, weakens your soul, and brings you to despair. He can do this because He bore sin in His body on the cross (1 Peter. 2:24) that those who trust in Him would be saved.     If you are not a Christian, and want to be delivered from the righteous judgment of God upon you due to your sin against Him, then come to the One who died for the sins of the world.  Come to the One who died for sinners (Matt. 11:28).  Turn from your sins.  Believe and trust in Jesus.  Receive Jesus, who is God in flesh, who died and rose from the dead (1 Cor. 15:1-4) as your Lord and Savior.   Ask Jesus to forgive you of your sins.  Receive Christ (John 1:12).  Only He can wash you clean from your sins and only Jesus can deliver you from the righteous judgment of a holy and infinite God.  Pray to Jesus.  Seek Him.  Ask Him to save you.     He will.      Here is a sample prayer you can offer to Jesus.  It does not have to be exact, but you will get the idea.        Lord Jesus, I know that I have sinned against you.  I know that I am not perfect and that I cannot please you through my own efforts.  I know that I deserve to be judged according to my sins.  And, I know that I have nothing to offer you.           Lord Jesus, I ask you to forgive me of my sins.  Please cleanse me and make me right before you.  I trust in what you have done on the cross.  I do not rely on myself but only on you and I receive you as Lord of my life and as savior of my soul.  Lord Jesus, save me.  I look to you alone.|`|b4Y0gDaIaa	satanism 4 sho|`|UqhApIvHaa	Don't follow a religion. religion takes you away from God and makes you care more about tradition.|`|xKbPNK4vaa	If this is a serious question, here is a serious answer: Read the gospels of the Christian Bible.|`|8gDRQ7v2aa	Christianity is the "TRUE" religion and will get you to heaven|`|AABCy5mQaa	Pick the belief that makes the most sense to you.

Like when I was 21.|`|2MfMyh4Maa	It's an interesting question to me as a parent whose kids basically thought the same way.  I would like to answer you as I would have liked to answer them.    Morality refers to universal law.  In other words, for example, slavery was wrong, is wrong and will always be wrong in any place in the world.  That is a universal law.      Universal law has to have a lawgiver and that can (obviously) only be God.     Religion points us to God; that is its one function.    So both morality and religion are of God.  I don't have opinions about God, I have beliefs.  My beliefs are the underlying assumptions of truth upon which I base my entire being.  They are not opinions nor traditions, but assumptions of universal truth.      You ought to sit in a quiet room by yourself and consider what you think to be universally true, not what you consider to be my opinion.  To be an adult, I think, means acting on what we believe to be true and not bending our ideas of truth every time on the basis of what we want.    You want to do what you want to do and God stands in the way of that independence that you seek.  You are not unique. I think almost all teenagers go through this, I know I did.  But don't manipulate the truth on the basis of what you want.  That is exceedingly dangerous.       By the way, have a star for your question.|`|jOwH96wKaa	Yes.

As it expanded, it cooled and energy condensed into matter and hydrogen and helium formed.  Carbon had to be formed in as star through fusion.    The genetics you look at now are the product of 4 billion years of evolution.  However, if you trace patterns in the DNA, the only conclusion possible is common descent.    Both are true.  Neither contradict a deity.|`|zYAQrnjcaa	Yeah that's what's horrible about public schools... they try to create your beliefs for you. It's not right, that's why my daughter will not go to a public school. I believe parts of evolution may be correct however, it's still not right that they're forcing you to believe anything. They should be teaching all arguments and then let you choose which one to believe in. All I can say is keep praying and God will help you through it. I'll pray for you too. Stay strong.|`|6a44deb0b64aa4a94dcb485934e01693aa	You have a lot of questions that have already been answered, and some of the statements you've made here are incorrect (below).  Keep learning.    1. In no way does the big bang theory postulate a bunch of carbon collected together and caused an explosion.  In actuality, any elements heavier than hydrogen and helium (including carbon) are known to be formed as part of a supernova explosion.    2. Regarding the 'perfect planet', which do you think came first, life or the planet?  Do you think it's possible that life evolved to suit its environment?  Do you think life that exists on liquid water is the only possibility?  Do you think the human nose was specifically designed to hold glasses?    3. The moon does not keep the oceans from spilling over the continents.    4. There's been a lot of debate in the political sphere about intelligent design (note: there's virtually no debate in the scientific sphere, because there's no actual intelligent design theory).  What you really need to learn in science class is not facts and figures, but the methodology of the scientific method and WHY it works.  Things will start to fall in place from there, but you can't build a strong house on a foundation of sand.    To sum up, if you are not a fundamentalist, science does not, in any way, disprove your religion.  As long as it is acceptable to you that the Bible is allegory and not literal fact (i.e. if someone says the world is round and rain doesn't come from stars, and you're OK with that), you should be fine.  In fact, the majority of Christians reconcile their faith by saying things like, "Evolution is part of God's plan"|`|YOWnMp0Xaa	Methinks you weren't actually paying attention in class then.    You completely misunderstand the Big Bang, and pretty much anything to do with cosmology. And more importantly, no science teachers teach that there "is no God". So I suspect you're lying about that. Science deals with what IS, not with WHY it is.|`|0ufpOygTaa	Facts:    1) Evolution doesn't talk anything at all about god.  2) Nothing in Theory of Evolution says that we evolved from monkeys. What we have is a common ancestral morphology.  3) Big Bang has nothing to do with Theory of Evolution.  4) There are plenty of reasoning against Theory of Evolution but none is even close to adequately debunking it.    If you consider science as crap then you should also reconsider accepting the benefits you are getting from science.|`|btLIW5xhaa	I used to doubt my faith also at times, but I think that it eventually made me a better Christian. It's okay to question your religion, and I even encourage it. There are many people out there who are naive, close minded and hypocritical. Just keep an open mind and an open heart (meaning: talk to somebody! priest, friend, parents, yourself, God, anybody)         Good luck!

You have to replace the first one with "se:"    Mi amigo se lo dio a mi madre.    The reason: to Spanish ears, it sounds better like that. It's OK and correct to use each of these pronouns by themselves in sentences, but you have to change the first one when they come together like in your sentence.

O7SshRl6aa	I don't think it's inappropriate, but approach carefully.  Instead of saying "how do you pronounce this?" try, "I was hoping you might have some insight into pronouncing this name or might know where I could go for pronounciation information".  Remember, there are LOTS of Asian languages - Chinese, Japanese, Laotian, Cambodian, Korean, Thai, and then lots of dialects of each language.

aO4iCwtoaa	Not sure that it has.  There have been fairly large Jewish communities in India over the years, especially in the last couple centuries, but neither Hinduism or Judaism believes in proselytizing, so actual religious interaction or dialogue wasn't likely to come up.  And there was never any sort of tradition of anti-Semitism in India, either, which is also generally a sign of either mutual tolerance or lack of interaction.
Vp1bQDTsaa	I'm really sorry to tell you that it is spanish, but a wrong way of it... it's like a cotidian.. uhm.. how can I explain it?... way of use it for some people specially when they're on internet, its meaning depends on what the person wanted to say with that 'si', because it can be an affirmation, or it can be like an "If" on english. But I can tell you that if it comes from Mexico, "si te kojes ala vena reid", the third word is used by teenagers mostly and its meaning is close to fuc k or something like that, but hey maybe I'm wrong on translating this way the phrase and someone wanted to give it other meaning.    ps. I'm sorry for my bad english, I'm mexican.|`|iH2whFkHaa	I believe it is spanish but it's very badly written or it's very heavy/outlandish slang as my husband who is a native Mexican couldn't understand it.    ciao|`|3e6175bba38d844ea9a99e1eab5894b2aa	This is definitely not Spanish.

Languages always evolve, take a look back at English, say 1000 years ago compared to today. Talk about the evolution of language. Language is supposed to be a way of communication, nothing more, nothing less.

Xsen794Aaa	For "tu" to pronounce the 'u' sound of French, you round your lips like you're saying 'oo'  while saying 'ee' with your alveolar region (or the rest of your mouth).    The "es" is like the 'e' in "end."    "ma" is pronounced like it looks.    The 'r' in "raison" is just like saying the G in "go" and an H sound at the same time.  The 'ai' sound is just like the E in "end."  The S is pronounced like the Z in "zebra" because it's between two vowels. For the ON part, you just try to say "oh," like you're trying to make the sound come out of your nose rather than your mouth; the emphasis goes on this part of the word.    For "de," make your lips (lips only!) like you're about to say "cook," but instead, say "den" without the N.    For "vivre," just say "veev," plus a touch of the R sound I mentioned above (the G + H thing).    Hope that helped.  By the way "Spot on Old Chap!," it's "bonne chance."|`|94538cc37834a8ce835eaaa9de2f31b0aa	too eh mah ray-zon duh vee-vruh    Despite what most of these people are saying, you definitely do NOT pronounce the "s" at the end of the word "es". It's "eh". (I made this mistake at first too, but looking at the other answers, I remembered.)    I promise.    The general rule in French is to just ignore the last letter of whatever word you're looking at. For example: "parfait" is pronounced "par-fay", not "par-fate".    Be sure to say it in a "French" accent, or else it will just sound silly.|`|YfJHliLWaa	tu (two) es (eh) ma (ma) raison (ray-son) de (duh) vivre (veev-rah)|`|drzN1kkuaa	TOO ES MAH RAY SON DE VIV E AIR|`|eSV03XrZaa	it "tu eres me raison de vivre" not tu es.....duh|`|X1nWoUH7aa	(too-es-mah-rhe-son-du-viv-rhe)|`|WNB4Vojsaa	too eh mah rayzon doi veevra|`|AlZPIAtmaa	You said it beautifully!|`|smsmK2pkaa	Tu(two) es(a) ma(ma as in 'mama') raison(ray-zon) de(day) vivre(vee as in see, but replace the s with a v and vrru)    All togther:    two(strong french accent) a ma ray-zon day vee-vrru|`|bOgvUEzvaa	too ess mah ray-son duh veeve-vrah   :)  hope that make sense|`|zCSUlmmPaa	like this: two, the letter s, muh, ray sawn, day, veev ruh.  *The words with spaces are because they are different syllables.|`|R5UIMBvcaa	Tew ay [or eh] mah rezONH duh VEEVr.    "Tew" is the best I can type for "tu," but you'll get closer to the true pronunciation if you do this:  Round your mouth to say "oo"; then with your mouth frozen in that position, say "ee" instead.    The reason for the h at the end of "reZONH' is that in French a final n isn't quite fully pronounced, but is nasalized--pronounced up in the nose.    The r in "vivre" is barely pronounced.  Think of the Louvre--we tend to say "Loov," although the r should be slightly pronounced there, too.    BTW, the sentence is correct as it is.

Youll just have to make the best of it! Expressions such as these have been made time and again by one member of a family to another as an excuse or in justification of displaying certain personality traits that irk, or may even severely try, others. In particular is this likely to be the mental attitude of those addicted to alcohol or who follow a homosexual way of life.    But is it really so that personalities cannot be changed? The Bible indicates that they can be. For example, the apostle Paul wrote: For all things I have the strength by virtue of him who imparts power to me. (Phil. 4:13) For one thing, he was able, by virtue of this power, to put up with all manner of circumstances; he knew how to get along with much or with little. And, as we examine his life, we find him serving faithfully as an apostle to the nations, although often experiencing beatings, once being stoned, three times being shipwrecked, spending a day and a night in the deep, as well as having undergone or faced all kinds of dangers.2?Cor. 11:22-27; Rom. 11:13.    More than that, Paul was able to make a radical change in his personality. Before he became a Christian, he had been a blasphemer and a persecutor and an insolent man. Because of this, he speaks of himself as having been the foremost of sinners. (1?Tim. 1:12-16) However, upon becoming a Christian he became so exemplary that he could write: Become imitators of me, even as I am of Christ.1?Cor. 11:1.    No, this was not an easy thing to do. Paul had internal conflicts, so that at times he did the things he wished not to do and did not do the things he desired to do. But his weaknesses never got the upper hand. That is why he could exclaim in this connection: Thanks to God through Jesus Christ our Lord! (Rom. 7:13-25) Yes, great as were his responsibilities and privileges in being the apostle to the nations, he had a struggle. That is why he also wrote: I pummel my body and lead it as a slave, that, after I have preached to others, I myself should not become disapproved somehow. (1?Cor. 9:27) There is no question that, by virtue of the strength God provided, Paul was able to change his personality.    And not only could the apostle. He tells of the changes in personality made by some at Corinth who had been indulging in fornication, idolatry, adultery, homosexuality, thievery, and so forth. What enabled them to change? Their newly found religion. But you have been washed clean, says Paul, but you have been sanctified, but you have been declared righteous in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and with the spirit of our God. (1?Cor. 6:9-11) Similarly, the apostle Peter writes of some who had left off such bad habits. These Christians, too, had made changes in their personalities.1?Pet. 4:3, 4.    Then again, it is common knowledge that there is very little unselfish, self-sacrificing love shown by people in general, little even by those belonging to the same religion or church. But Jesus said that this quality, genuine love, would mark his followers. (John 13:34, 35) For that to be true, his followers have to make changes in their personalities, from selfishness to unselfishness.    But today there are some who do not agree. For example, there is a certain clinical associate professor of psychiatry at the University of British Columbia. To a leading fundamentalist magazine, he wrote a letter that was published under the heading No Help On Homosexuality. In it he objected to an article that had previously appeared in that magazine to the effect that homosexuality was not compatible with Christianity. According to him, it is too much to expect conversion to Christianity to effect a change in sexual orientation from homosexuality to heterosexuality. He referred to some who insisted that, at best, only 25 percent can change, and he quoted the evangelical British psychiatrist whose experience with 50 homosexuals caused him to conclude: If anyone believes that the experience of conversion will take away sexual desires and lead to a normal attraction toward the opposite sex, then he is mistaken. .?.?. I have met no single case of a man being set free from them by spiritual measures.    Why the contradiction? Who is mistaken? It could not be the apostles Paul and Peter, for they were not only intelligent and honest men but they wrote under divine inspiration. The only conclusion we can come to is that those who insist that conversion did not result in a change of personality did not use the right kind of spiritual measures. In other words, the professed believers were not converted to true, genuine, apostolic Christianity.    Why can true Christianity cause a change in personality regardless of the nature of the flaws? For one thing, because true Christianity inculcates strong faith in the Creator. He made us and he has the right to tell us what we may and may not do. Moreover, being the all-wise, just and loving Sovereign of our lives, he knows what is best for us. Faith in him will enable us to take his view on this matter, and his Word makes it very plain that he considers homosexuality a gross sin.See Genesis 19:1-29; Leviticus 18:22; 20:13; 1?Timothy 1:8-11; Jude 7.    So, from the first step onward, there must be an accepting of Gods view that this practice is bad and an obeying of Gods command to hate what is bad. (Ps. 97:10) Even as an ex-alcoholic must try to hate the inebriating effect of liquor if he would remain free from his addiction, so must the one who once was a homosexual hate his former sexual orientation. To be able to do this, he needs to heed the advice: Quit being fashioned after this system of things, but be transformed by making your mind over, that |`|BzrUWCsDaa	You have a choice.. but before you make a decision that affects your everlasting welfare.. make sure you know just exactly what you are giving up if you follow your fleshly desires.

At your age if you were to start on hormones (which arent that expensive here) you may not need cosmetic work. And surgery would be later anyway.     If you try and focus on everything all at once it may be too consuming. A journey of a thousand miles starts with but a step.  Start by just trying to find out exactly where you fit. Not everyone wants to transition completely.     Moms are usually the most understanding. Is yours? If so, maybe find a way to work it into the conversation sometime and see how she reacts. That will give you an idea how accepting she would be to your coming out.      Keep getting information. Make a plan. Keep going forward.

No one can really tell you HOW to do it, because each person's situation is unique.  I can however help you out with information for your other questions.    The operations are expensive, anywhere from $8,000 to $15,000 or more, depending on how far you wish to transition.  You'll first need to visit a gender therapist and live as the opposite gender for a length of time, as well as take female hormones.    Below I've placed a short transition guide as well as a bit more information on being transsexual.  I wish you the best of luck in your transition.|`|yOuVPRRXaa	You should just be straight forward in telling them.

Most transwomen don't have a surgeon dig a hole, and the procedure is crude and costs tens of thousands. Generally, hormones suffice, and if you have to self-medicate, easily hundreds a month for hormones in some cases. If you're actually serious, write a long letter explaining what's going on, and stick it into your parents mail box. If they're accepting, you'll see a wpath therapist, and after a while, possibly get to take hormones that will radically alter your mind and body.

vgyIefZpaa	Though I have not yet found a specific reference to "Heavenly Mother," our prophets have revealed to us that we have one.<br>  <br>  D&C 131:1-2  <br>  1 IN the celestial glory there are three heavens or degrees;<br>  2 And in order to obtain the highest, a man must enter into this order of the priesthood [meaning the new and everlasting covenant of marriage];<br>  <br>  “neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord” 1 Cor. 11:11<br>  <br>  You've probably also heard that we believe that we can become like God and this is how He became God.  This highest degree of glory is what we need to reach in order to become Gods and Goddesses.  If this system is the truth, then Heavenly Father must have a wife with whom our spirits were created.<br>  <br>  I understand polytheism is the worship of several gods.  We worship one God.  We do not worship Heavenly Mother or any other Gods.  These other heavenly beings have no power over us and are therefore "irrelevant" to our beings.  Yes they are holy personages, but we do not worship or acknowledge them in our services.  Essentially, we worship the one God.<br>  <br>  I'm not quite sure I understand the Trinity/Triad issue, but if you have read the Book of Mormon (kudos) then you understand we believe they are three separate beings united in purpose.<br>  <br>  I also understand the word "Christian" as someone who follows Christ.  We follow Christ, therefore, we are Christian.  Definitions of Christ vary with denomination.  "My Christ" may differ from what you believe Christ to be, but I derived mine from the Bible as I'm sure you did.  Latter Day Saints are Christians.<br>  <br>  Thanks for the sincere inquiry.  Feel free to PM me if you have any more questions.<br>  <br>  P.S. for Regina.  I didn't know a "very bad place" entailed trying to make the world better.  Members of the LDS faith are taught to strive to better themselves, their families, and their communities.  Your God must be a cruel one to punish us for trying.  If you are referencing the scripture concerning adding on to the Bible in Revelations (and Deut 4:2), then some of the Bible isn't legit.  Those scriptures talk about the books themselves.  Oh, and Revelations was written before other books in the Bible, so I guess we're all heading to the same place if you read the New Testament.|`|OLnmXeWDaa	I was just reading a book of Wm Clayton's diaries, and he wrote that Smith talked about how women would be goddesses and continue bearing children in heaven.<br>  <br>  Careful, LDS women who talk about heavenly mother get excommunicated.

There is a scene where the neighbors are having a combined yard sale along the block. They have a public address system set up too. Homer grabs the mike from Flanders and begins his sales speak for various items. Homer holds up a t-shirt from the 1980s with Ayatollah Khomeini's face on it, and says, "the Ayatollah thinks he's better than America, is he right?" Then you hear all these boos and right before it cuts off to something else, you hear one last voice say, "yes." <br>  <br>  Lol.

8394e5936aebef9ee10585a3366dcadfaa	te acabo de dar la estrella, hacen falta este tipo de preguntas con algo de logica e intelecto.... no, las clasicas de: ?estare embarazada? o ? mi novio me dejo, que hago? ....ya enfadan......  Mi interpretacion es la siguiente:   El tercer mandamiento se refiere unicamente a: Santificar a Dios y santificar sus fiestas.  Moises y su pueblo eran Judios y este mandamiento mandaba solamente santificar a Dios conforme a lo que ellos hacian y practidaban; como los sacrificios de corderos,  la uncion de los primogenitos, los dias de guardar como el sabado, etc. por que eran las practicas que en su entender honraban a Dios.  Que despues cada religion ( catolica, testigos de Jehova, cristianos, presbiteranos, protestantes, etc lo aplicaran a sus festividades ya es otra cosa.  El chiste es que el mandamiento dice muy claramente que santifiques a Dios y la manera como TU quieras honrarlo; llendo a misa, evangelizando, orando o como tu mejor lo quieras hacer y como te ducte tu religion.  Por eso los judios mataron a Jesucristo por que el hablaba de una nueva alianza donde se eliminaban las festividades de los judios y sus sacrificios.

Maybe...maybe not. Sex was created by God. God told Adam and Eve to have offspring to fill the earth but sex is not only for that purpose. It is for pleasure. <br>  <br>  Just because dogs and dolphins have sex for pleasure does not mean anything. They have sex.........then they have sex. That doesn't mean they go to heaven. <br>  <br>  Heaven is for those who RECEIVE the gospel and follow Christ. They get SALVATION. A lot of people don't understand that. Once you get that concept, everything else pretty much falls into place.<br>  <br>  Animals do not receive the gospel. They do not have "human reasoning." Animals don't get SALVATION. When they die, they whither away. They don't go to heaven, Bottom Line. <br>  <br>  God bless you!

Korea, Viet Nam,<br>  Kosovo, and now twice in Iraq. It's OK to defend <br>  yourself but none of those wars had anything to <br>  do with defense... they were ego trips and political<br>  distractions from problems at home.<br>  <br>  War is clearly the worst thing that can happen and<br>  our country has engaged in it far too many times<br>  without proper need and justification.

It is better to be ready and trained for them in a responsible manner than to surrender and see yourself, your family, or your culture either assimilated or destroyed. <br>  <br>  I'm an omnivore, I hunt to eat. If I couldn't hunt, I would be in serious trouble. There are those of us who see hunting as a religious thing, and the idea of getting meat at a store repulsive. <br>  <br>  Unnecessary violence is bad, yes, but being a doormat is worse, and pacifists are oven harmed worse, historically speaking. History is written by the victor, often in the losers blood.|`|ZcVkqwkcaa	I'm a pagan who doesnt believe in volience unless ones person or family is being attacked. (to the extreme only).  I don't think one needs to use violence to get their message across, I think it does the opposite, it weakens your message just as adding cussing and other words that aren't approate for the subject matter.  now yes Im more then willing to cuss someone out if they cross my own personal space/lines. <br>  but anyway, speaking clearly and using your mind is better then violence.|`|c503ad208e9d6b0524a3bc6f69ee2f8eaa	Non violence as in peaceful protest?  Sure, I would say that falls in line with my personal beliefs.  Non violence as in no war, ever... no, I fully believe that sometimes violence is necessary.  Non violence as in being a vegan?  No way - if a person chooses to hunt for their dinner, more power to 'em - as long as they are being ecologically responsible.  Worked for the Native Americans for millenia, surely they can't have been so wrong.. <br>  I don't think violence should be the first answer to most issues - and I think for MOST issues it could be passed over all together.  But when in the best interests of the majority, I fully support it.|`|fd5f2954d03f8ed32926400fe1b18cfcaa	Sounds like an interesting class. Personally, I would say to avoid violence unless it is a last resort for self-defense. We are avid gun owners for this reason (and because we like to go out and shoot targets). When I say we own guns for self-defense, I am speaking less about the random home invasion than I am a potential fundie uprising in which they seek out non-christians to either kill or run out of town. We live in a very ultra-conservative place and the idea of this is not too far-fetched.  We know we would be outnumbered, but we would take a few of them with us if we had to.|`|1yMuRnwdaa	Non-violence is a good thing, to a point. Violence never really solves an issue. I'am  a firm believer in not turning the other cheek. Because there are people who will take advantage of your passiveness  and interpret it as a weakness, even though it is not.

"Prlve une aum?ne sur leurs biens pour les purifier et les rendre sans taches" (verset103/9).    Le Coran contient plus de 80 versets qui renferment l'ordre de s'acquitter de la Zakat.     Les buts de la Zakat sont les suivants :    Purifier l'ame humaine de l'avarice, de l'avidit et de la convoitise    Subvenir aux besoins des pauvres et ncessiteux    Rallier le coeur des fidles    Instaurer les oeuvres d'utilit publique (coles, hopitaux).    Limiter l'accumulation des richesses chez les personnes aises et autres    Pour tre acquittable de la Zakat, la personne doit possder effectivement des biens et les avoir possd pendant un an. C'est  dire avoir prserv le minimum acquittable (nissab) pendant un an.    Biens soumis  la Zakat :     la monnaie (2,5% d'acquittement),    les bestiaux    Les marchandises    Les mtaux extraits du sol    Les fruits et les crales     Les bnficiaires de la Zakat sont :     Le pauvre et le ncessiteux : qui n'arrivent pas  assurer leur subsistance mme s'ils possdent un bien pouvant tre soumis  la Zakat    Les collecteurs de la Zakat qui se dplacent et font de grands effort dans ce travail de collecte    Les nouveaux convertis dont la foi n'est pas encore ferme mais qui ont une certaine influence sur leur entourage    Pour l'affranchissement d'hommes ou de femmes de maisons (domestiques) et le rachat de captif    Les endetts qui sont incapables de s'acquitter de leurs dettes provenant des transactions qui ne comportent pas d'offense  Allah et  son Prophte (saw)    Pour qui luttent dans le sentier d'Allah (ex. buts d'utilit publique)    Le voyageur qui se trouve loin de son pays et qui n'arrive pas  subvenir  ses besoins et pour y retourner    Et ceci conformment au verset 60 de la sourate 9 :    "Les aum?nes ne sont destins que pour les pauvres, les indigents, ceux qui sont chargs de les recueillir, ceux dont les c?eurs sont  gagner ( l'Islam),  racheter la libert des gens,  les acquitter de leurs dettes,  la lutte dans le sentier d'Allah, et pour le voyageur (en dtresse).

Il distribuait  autrui tout ce quil pouvait recevoir, et sen rjouissait plus que ceux qui se voyaient offrir ses prsents. Il ne laissait jamais personne quitter sa demeure les mains vides, et privilgiait toujours les ncessiteux  la satisfaction de ses propres besoins.  Dans la mesure o, le Prophte Muhammad est un exemple pour les musulmans, chacun essayant au mieux qu'il peut de suivre sa voie.  Toute personne possdant des biens matriels ou immatriels et que ces biens suffisent  satisfaire ses besoins vitaux est soumise  la Zakat.  la Zakat peut se dfinir comme un acte spirituel et purificateur, elle permet aux fidles de se dtacher de leurs biens matriels pour pouvoir se rapprocher de leur crateur comme le faisait l'Abbe Pierre.  la Zakat est d'abord donn aux pauvres aux dmunis et orphelins...les amis de l'Abb Pierre.  D'ailleurs la parole de Dieu inscrit dans le Coran met en garde les personnes riches:    ? Malheur au calomniateur acerbe   qui amasse des richesses et qui les compte !  Il pense que ses richesses le rendront immortel !  Non !.. Il sera prcipit dans la Houmata. ?    Sourate 104 versets 1  4.    A la lumire des textes islamique, un Abb doit vivre dans chaque musulmans (et en gnral dans chaque Homme)    la perte de cet homme qui aura eu le courage de vivre et de mourir en croyant, de mettre ses grandes convictions au service des plus faibles, des plus humbles et des plus pauvres.   je ne dirai pas Adieu l'Abb mais merci...|`|3c7838d73360f6b234d24278464c15a4aa	Ce nest tout simplement pas dans la nature de lislam !    L'aum?ne ne peut se faire qu'aux musulmans.    L'aum?ne lgale (ou Zakat), doit tre verse chaque anne par tous les musulmans en ayant les moyens (c'est  dire disposant de plus de biens que ncessaire pour assurer leur subsistance et celle de leur famille). C'est l'un des cinq piliers de l'islam , et cela est souvent mis en avant pour prsenter l'islam comme une religion de grande humanit. Mais ce qui est moins souvent prcis, ce sont les catgories de personnes pouvant la recevoir. Tout tre humain ne peut en effet en tre destinataire : la Zakat ne peut tre verse Q'A UN MUSULMAN.    Cette exclusion des ? infidles ? du bnfice de l'aide musulmane se retrouve d'ailleurs en d'autre domaine que celui de la Zakat, comme celui de l'aide humanitaire. Il existe en effet une organisation copie sur la Croix Rouge, et qui s'appelle le Croissant Rouge. Il s'agit d'une organisation internationale d'aide humanitaire ; mais contrairement  son modle, la Croix Rouge, qui intervient sur tous les terrains du monde o existent des besoins d'aide humanitaires, et ce quelles que soient les populations  aider, le Croissant Rouge, lui, n'intervient QUE  sur les lieux o sont en dtresse DES POPULATIONS MUSULMANES.|`|f9b8b6712e963deccd2b29725686a216aa	L'Abb Pierre et Mre Thrsa taient des personalits unique dans leur genre,ils faisaient le bien,ils aidaient les pauvres,ils assistaient les plus dmunis et ils ont passs leurs vies au cot de exclus de la plante,ils l'ont fait en leurs nom et pour Dieu et non sous les auspices de l'Eglise car ils taient en dsaccord avec cette institution et ces mthodes.    Pour revenir  ta question sache que l'Islam est une religion de paix et de bien.  Un des principes fondamentaux de l'Islam est que toute chose appartient  Dieu, et que les richesses sont par consquent confis aux hommes. Le mot 'zakat' signifie en mme temps 'croissance' et 'purification' : nos biens sont purifis en reservant une part aux personnes dans le besoin, et, comme l'lagage des plantes, cette "coupe" r-quilibre et relance la croissance. Chaque musulman calcule lui-mme le montant de sa zakat.    Une personne pieuse peut aussi donner autant qu'elle le dsire en tant que sadaqa, et le fait de prfrence en secret. Bien que ce mot se traduise par "aum?ne volontaire" il signifie plus encore : le Prophte Mohamed a dit : 'mme le fait de rencontrer votre frre avec le sourire est une aum?ne'.     'L'aum?ne est ncessaire  chaque musulman.' On demanda au prophte : "Et si une personne ne possde rien ?" Le Prophte rpondit : 'Il doit travailler de ses propres mains pour sa subsistance et pour donner quelque part de ce qu'il gagne en aum?ne'. Les compagnons demandrent : 'Et s'il n'est pas capable de travailler ?' Le Prophte rpondit : ' Il doit aider le pauvre et les personnes dans le besoin.' Les compagnons demandrent : 'Et s'il ne peut mme pas faire ceci ?' Le Prophte rpondit : 'Il doit motiver les autres aux bonnes oeuvres'. Les compagnons dirent : 'Et s'il n'y arrive pas non plus ?' Le Prophte rpondit : 'Il doit viter de faire du mal. Ceci aussi est une aum?ne.'     CONCLUSION:  Alors c'est simple si tout ceux qui se disent musulmans appliqus ces principes il pourrai y avoir des millions d'Abb Pierre et des millions de Mre Thrsa.|`|2b355c8ad977a6a3cbef9d8fcf00dce4aa	Pourquoi n'y a-t-il pas eu auparavant des mres Trsa ou d'Abb Pierre ?

Ever noticed how people who committ every other sin imaginable can condemn a homosexual?  They can't comprehend how someone would want to live like that.  It is not a sin most people understand or struggle with, so it is an easy target.  I don't agree with homosexuality, but why don't we ever see people protesting divorce or sex outside marriage?  Because those are much more common and many people are more tempted by and give in to them.

Mnm35sjNaa	Other than the New Testament, there is no evidence that Jesus ever existed. Some believe Jesus is a myth: a “wisdom cult” created from prior myths.<br>  <br>  There was ABSOLUTELY NOTHING written about Jesus during his lifetime. Those who question whether he was real or myth cite the following reasons: no eyewitness accounts; no direct archaeological evidence; no contemporaneous works mentioning Jesus; and the similarities early Christianity shares with other religions and mythology preceding Jesus.<br>  <br>  Combining liberal and conservative estimates, the books of the New Testament were written between 45 A.D. and 150 A.D. The Gospels tend to date Mark no earlier than 65 A.D. and no later than 75 A.D. Matthew is dated between 70 A.D. and 85 A.D. Luke is usually placed within 80 A.D. to 95 A.D. The book of John is the last of the Gospels to be written. First Thessalonians, an epistle of Paul, is considered to be the first book of the New Testament written (around 51 A.D.) and Second Peter is considered the last written (somewhere between 70 A.D. and 150 A.D.)<br>  <br>  The traditional view that the Gospels were written by Jesus' disciples: Matthew, Mark, Luke and John is suspect. The Gospels were written in Greek but Jesus' disciples spoke Aramaic. The Gospels were also written 2 to 7 decades after the life of Jesus. It seems likely that the Gospels were written by authors who used pseudonyms representing Jesus' disciples, Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. John is said to have lived to a ripe old age, perhaps as old as 100. He might have lived long enough to write the book of John but, once again, was a humble Jew who was unlikely to know the Greek language. For certain, the first books of the New Testament were written by Paul -- who converted to Christianity well after Jesus was dead. Paul never knew or saw Jesus.<br>  <br>  Other than the New Testament, the only historical references to Jesus were brief mentions by 4 early authors of the Roman Empire: Flavius Josephus (37 - 100 A.D.), Tacitus (56 - 117 A.D.), Gaius Suetonius Tranquillus (69 - 140 A.D.) and Pliny the Younger (61 - 113 A.D.). It appears that, except for Pliny the Younger, these authors were repeating second-hand information. In some cases, many historians doubt their authenticity.  At any rate, all 4 authors were born long after Jesus was dead.<br>  <br>  In the case of Josephus' mention of Jesus, even the Catholic Encyclopedia admits that, "The passage seems to suffer from repeated interpolations." There has been no consensus on which portions are corrupt, or to what degree. The overwhelming majority of biblical scholars question its authenticity, in part or in whole.<br>  <br>  Pliny the Younger's passage described to Emperor Trajan how he dealt with unruly Christians who worshiped Christ instead of the emperor. He described the Christians and "Christus" -- not the person of Jesus.<br>  <br>  Like Pliny the Younger, Tacitus wrote a short passage about Christians and mentions "Christus" -- but only as the subject of Christian worship. Tacitus doesn't discuss the person of Jesus.<br>  <br>  Gaius Suetonius Tranquillus, mentioned riots which broke out in the Jewish community in Rome under the emperor Claudius. He wrote, "As the Jews were making constant disturbances at the instigation of Chrestus, Emperor Claudius expelled them from Rome". "Chrestus", here, is thought to be a misspelling of "Christus" or Christ. However, Chrestus was also a common name in the Roman Empire. Like Pliny the Younger and Tacitus, he makes no mention of Jesus the person.<br>  <br>  So how do we KNOW Jesus existed? It's an article of faith backed up by the New Testament. There are NO accounts of Jesus' life other than the New Testament. There is only 1 mention of Jesus' deeds (healing) and that account is thoroughly discredited, even by the Catholic Encyclopedia.  Those who claim Josephus was reliable may be right.  That's not the issue.  The issue is later interpolations (inserting one's own words into somebody else's text).  Overzealous scribes have been known to interpolate in the name of Jesus.  As I said, in the case of Josephus, even the Catholic Encyclopedia acknowledges the interpolations.  Case closed. (Yes, JBT, a little bit of knowledge is a dangerous thing).<br>  <br>  As for who created God . . . there is no answer. The question leads to an infinite regression: Who created the creator? Who created the creator's creator? Who created the creator of the creator's creator . . . etc.|`|AuCnM6Qoaa	faith and prayers<br>  God created everything, good and evil, hi|`|g4AAZRuxaa	God alone as immortality.|`|tI1NHwfBaa	God, by definition, does not need a creator.  God exists outside of space and time, and is not bound by them.  Therefore, God wasn't.  And God won't be.  God simply is.  <br>  <br>  As for Jesus, well the evidence for his existence is huge.  <br>  <br>  Scripture testifies of Jesus.  Now, many people say that the Bible doesn't count, but these are people with no understanding of archaeology.  There are over 5,000 copies and fragments of copies of New Testament books that have been found, and they testify of Christ.  That's a hundred times more than the next most common book of antiquity.  These books were written and copied during the lifetimes of the people who witnessed the events firsthand.<br>  <br>  We don't have contrary accounts from the same time period saying that the whole Jesus story was made up, or a fraud.<br>  <br>  We also have the accounts of Flavius Josephus, a Jewish historian.  Again, naysayers will say that Josephus was a liar, but this again discounts archaeology.  Josephus is an exceptional historical source, and the contents of his writings have been verified again and again.<br>  <br>  We also have numerous other "lost" gospels, writings that the Christian church has discounted as being heretic, but which testify of Jesus Christ's ministry.<br>  <br>  We also have the amazing transformation of the disciples and the rise of Christianity.  If Jesus were simply a made-up hoax, would it make sense for the disciples to die to perpetuate the fakery?  If Jesus were just a magician, would it make sense for his followers to continue to do his magic tricks but give credit to the dead Jesus?  Why wouldn't they want fame and glory for themselves, instead?<br>  <br>  Yes, Jesus existed.  And he was God.|`|NFK3A68oaa	Good question.  Very BIG question!  Even if you're an atheist, you have to say SOMETHING (matter and/or energy) always existed, without explanation, so "who created God" is a pointless question at present.  But there is plenty of evidence of an intelligent Creator in the world of living things.<br>  <br>  For instance, a bird called the Blackpoll Warbler has been tracked flying from Alaska to New England and then out over the Atlantic, catching the Jet Stream back to South America, then flying back all the way to Alaska every year.<br>  <br>  If somebody asked US to construct a flying machine that can fly from Alaska to New England to South America and back unaided, could we? But suppose they also asked us to make it weigh less than one ounce. Could we? And no one may build it--it must build itself, because that is what the Blackpoll Warbler does in its egg, doesn't it? Feathers, dual TV cameras, flight computer and all. From a speck in an egg. Would we even try? Could the US government? The entire University system, with an impressive array of bright students, knowledgeable professors and able administrators? All those advanced human brains combined, connected together by the Internet? No? So how much sense does it make to say that blind, unthinking Chance just "accidentally" did so through blind, unthinking evolution? <br>  <br>  My young school friend pointed out that since we have about 100 trillion cells in our body and each has about 5 feet of DNA, that makes about 100 trillion times 5 feet, or 100 billion times 5000 feet (about a mile), or 100 billion miles of perfect code that is required to make us a body that works. Since the characters (the "letters") that that code is "printed" in are actually the size of molecules, that makes a lot of "typing" to give us a body. Could we type that much without making a mistake, since any mistake would cause a genetic weakness or birth defect? Could blind chance? <br>  <br>  Another thing. Ever tried to swat a fly? Not necessarily easy, right? Know why? It has to do with the fly's navigational system. It has a single vibrating rod in its abdomen, and as it changes direction in flight, it senses the changes in the vibrations of that rod and is able to dodge you, fly and land upside down and backwards. What would the Air Force pay to have flying and navigational systems that good?<br>  <br>  How did the fly manage to evolve such a system? Even if it evolved the vibrating rod, what good would it be without the nerves to send the signals from the rod to the brain? And the section of the brain to interpret the signals? And the correct instructions to interpret them? And the correct instructions to the part of the brain that controlled the wings as to what to DO about those signals? All AT THE SAME TIME. Wouldn't that be a remarkable coincidence? I ask people, "Could YOU sit down, right now, and write the code for such a set of instructions? And if your ten billion well trained and coordinated neurons put together can't do it with a computer, is it really reasonable to think that flies did it by themselves?"<br>  <br>  The fly has a complete navigational system that is self-constructing (in its egg), self-reproducing, self-programming, self-correcting, that can fly upside down and backwards, avoiding dangers and locating and recognizing fuel (food), that requires even MORE entire, completely developed systems that even large groups of highly educated humans cannot or are only now beginning to be able to copy (and only by intelligent design), all microminiaturized into a space smaller than the head of a pin, with the code for it in characters that are the size of molecules (I wonder how many characters per inch that works out to? Pretty hi-tech data storage). <br>  <br>  So I ask people, "In your experience, how many complete flying and navigational systems do you know of that have happened completely by accident, with no intelligent thought or design?" "Did you ever read the story of all the thought and work needed to design and build a flying machine, as told by the Wright brothers themselves? So how scientific is it to say that it just happened by blind accidents in the case of the lowly, incredibly complex fly?"<br>  <br>  All of the animal and plant world is full of examples like these. Your body is, too. Johns Hopkins University made the newspapers by making one enzyme. It must have been pretty hard to do. It was no accident. But your liver manufactures over nine hundred enzymes, all necessary for you to live, and no one thinks about putting THAT in the paper, or giving credit for that accomplishment to the One who deserves it. "Could have happened completely by accident" (which is what evolution equates to, isn't it?) But if it could happen so easily, simply by accidents of evolution, then why put the university in the news because it was able to produce ONE?<br>  <br>  This isn't defending the horrible things that have been done, like the Inquisition, and unscientific things taught, like a 7,000-year-old earth, by very fallible peo|`|jBYxEX8taa	God is eternal.

Also, do not feel shamed by the fact that you are a Christian who watches pornography. I guarantee that God will not send you to hell for watching pornography. Honestly, the only real advice is not to get worked up. You are at an age where sexual curiosity is wild and it will calm down, it does for everyone. Do not feel ashamed, know that the day will come where you either decide that pornography does not interest you or you will decide that it does interest you and you will view it as ok to watch. It is also perfectly normal for women to watch pornography, my ex-wife used to watch it all the time. She was one of those people who decided it was ok and she was a Christian. My present girlfriend used to watch it when she was your age but stopped around age 16. Do not worry, you will make a decision and you will view your decision as ok and will embrace it.

The more you let this stuff communicate with eyes and mind, the more that you are going to want to act out these behaviors.
