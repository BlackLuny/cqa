Just renaming the file wont convert the file, so it would simply be a gif with a wrong extension.    Paint.NET is also quite good as an editor, but i don't think you can get each frame from the gif, by using Paint.NET.    The build-in editor in windows, will only allow you to save the first frame as well, so getting Gimp would surely be the best option.    You can get Gimp from http://www.gimp.org/ Simply click (File - Save As) to save your image as jpg.

I also use both a PC and a Mac and have to say that the Mac laptops are great.

IwWmnUaVaa	Tape for a server.    Flash drive for your home PC.    Tape lasts longer and is more stable.  downside is it costs more.    AIT-3 is a good tape format.|`|x1YZgCCnaa	If you are on a network I would recommend having a backup server to store your backups on.|`|AA12336121	It really depends. Tape is pretty reliable, while flash drives can fail without warning. Tape is more proven.    At home, flash is probably fine, but for a business application, the cost to setup a tape backup will be easily outweighed by the value. Pop in a new tape, backup.Use it every night for a week, then use a new tape. After 2 weeks, send it to a different building (so fire/theft won't be a problem).    Hope this helps!|`|qqOW9JIMaa	You should seriously consider an automatic backup solution to protect your data. The problem with media is that it's horribly human resource intensive. I just wrote a business case on tape backup (and all media backup is similar)...    If you spend 10 minutes per day on backup, backup your computers 250 work days per year, and get paid $30 per hour (consulting or salary including benefits)... a media-based backup would consume $1250 of your time each year. This is a hidden cost that often makes a "more expensive" solution cheaper in the long run.    If you don't have much data, there are a number of online providers and local IT shops that offer online backup services using various technologies.  For people with small amounts of data, it's better to use one of these "shared" environments because it will reduce your overall costs.    If you have a reasonable amount of data (say 30GB to 50GB or more) then you could look at a dedicated appliance like the 3X Remote Backup Appliance (RBA). Obviously, I'm a little biased on this one, but we really do offer a very easy solution that can be stored in a business owner's home. We transmit the backup data across the internet, providing efficient backups without the labor cost or risk of damage/loss that is frequent with media.    Clayton Daley  3X Systems  http://www.3x.com
ELovXY9Paa	you'll be able to play crysis on medium at least.  with a slightly better video card, you'd be able to hit high settings.  one thing that's important to know is the actual processor product number.  For instance, is it a mobile Intel T7500 or a desktop E4500?  This is just as important as the clock speed (2.2 GHZ) because some core 2 duos run better than others, even at the exact same speed.    You should be able to hit high settings on all of those games except for crysis.  It might be in the low range of frame rates (around 20-40) but it will work.  I would just drop down a few of the individual settings to maximize performance and still have beautiful graphics.|`|AA11434633	A good site to keep in your favorites/bookmarks is the one offered below.    Simply select the game that you wish to know whether your computer will be able to run from the dropdown list, and allow the site to scan your computer.  (It will need you to download an ActiveX component onto your computer, but I've been using the site for at least a few years now and have never noticed anything untoward happening ... and you wouldn't believe the amount of security stuff I've got running on my computer.)    The resulting page will tell you what the relevant components of your computer are, whether they meet the minimum requirements, and what you need to upgrade if anything doesn't meet the minimum requirements.  (Sometimes there'll be another tab available indicating the recommended requirements.)    Of course, with so many games on the market, it's not always going to have the latest and greatest in the dropdown list.  You'll then need to look at other sites to find out what's required.|`|R8ZMaM9gaa	It should tell you on the box (or on the screen if for them) if you can run them on a PC.

It is a physical device - literally a stick of electronics that is on your motherboard inside your computer. You can add more RAM by purchasing it and placing it into extra slots, if you have any. I suggest you look at purchasing some and having it put in by a computer expert or technician.|`|XVpq4tOQaa	Yes, just need to make sure its the right kind.   www.4allmemory.com/  will show you what kind you need by brand and all  www.newegg.com   will have good prices!|`|WWxGAzYgaa	your maximum is 2 gig so go for it:  Memory  Type: DDR2  Installed: 1GB (PC2-4200)  Maximum: 2GB  Speed: 533MHz    http://www.memory4less.com/m4l_results.a...|`|hHLFgiQiaa	Yes, that machine can be upgraded to 2 GB RAM.  There are two RAM slots.|`|wXxIaLyxaa	RAM is very picky. It needs to be compliant with the same type of ram previously installed (DDR Ram won't fit DDR2 Ram, for instance). First of all, you need to make sure your RAM is compatible. When it comes to changing the RAM on a laptop, since i'm not exactly familiar with that laptop, check the back first, if there is a small plate with a screw it should say on the plate if it is for the RAM. If not, then the RAM is located under the keyboard, which I would recommend getting a professional, or someone who has done it before, do it for you.|`|MVwghmEMaa	Yes you can.  Check your manufacturers website for specific instructions and what size you need.  Then search the web for the best prices.  I upgraded my laptop to 1 gig|`|MQngKAJCaa	Yes, you can. You need to stop by your favorite computer store, locate a pair of 1GB DDR2 Sodimm 200 Pin PC4200 DDR533 Ram sticks, and figure out how to swap the new ones for the old ones.|`|BA2iv94qaa	Yes you can. On the bottom of most laptops is a plastic cover that hides the RAM, open that cover (it might have an icon next to it that looks like 2 boxes and a jagged edge) and look at the sticker, you need to purchase RAM that is the same type. If you google for a service manual for your laptop, that normally has instructions on installing ram. (also I just realised I typed google in yahoo answers). Anyway, if you do not feel confident installing ram. Pretty much all computer repair shops will do the upgrade for you.

XlyLakYAaa	Well, while Windows 7 might detect you have 4GBs of RAM installed, you still wouldn't be using all 4GBs of RAM, since it's a 32-bit OS.  You need a 64-bit OS, but it's odd that Windows XP 64-bit didn't work... it makes me think that you didn't install Windows XP 64-bit but just another 32-bit XP version.  If you want to use all your RAM, get Vista 64-bit (or Windows 7 64-bit)    By the way, the reason you need a 64-bit OS is because you can only address 4GBs of RAM in a 32-bit environment (do the math: 2 to the 32nd power = 4GBs).  However, this 4GB cap includes things like video RAM and pagefile so you can only effectively use about 3GBs of RAM in total on a 32-bit OS.|`|ZPBPwEQBaa	you have to get a 64bit version to get all 4gb a 32bit os sees 4gb total so if you have 4gb installed it will take out your graphics memory and subtract that from your total ram that's why it only reads 2.75gb a 64 bit os will see it all.

Dont delete all the .bin files in there unless you want to re-run all updates since your original installation (reinstallation seems to cause a problem in IEs Link Scanner which causes IE to Crash). Only rename/remove the avginfo files that end with .ctf    There are two .ctf files - avginfoavi.ctf and avginfowin.ctf in that folder which need to be deleted.    In  Windows Explorer change the folder options to Show Hidden files and folders, open Control Panel > click on Tools > Folder Options > View and locate Hidden files and folders and mark Show hidden files and folders or simply copy and paste this into Start > Run:    C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Avg8\update\download   then press Enter and delete the .ctf files    In Vista navigate to C:\ProgramData\avg8\update\download and delete the .ctf files    Do NOT delete any other files, only those ending .ctf    If the problem continues then the  update control files are probably corrupted.  There is a utility to delete these files from AVG, click here to go to the download page: http://free.avg.com/faq.num-1567 faq_156... and click on download deleteupdatefiles    Should this fail to resolve the  problem then it is advised to uninstall AVG with the AVG Removal Tool and then reinstall AVG after rebooting to clear any locked files.  http://www.avg.com/download-tools    Click here for the AVG Removal Tool|`|Veptmodnaa	Get rid of AVG and get AVAST .

Here are my suggestions (I tried all personally):    Stay away from AVG ( I have found it more defective than helpful ), it may be free but it has hiccups like the two errors that made the news recently on CNET, the first time it said that Zone Alarm (a firewall) was a virus and the second time, it advised to remove a key component of Windows causing those who did to lose their Windows system (they had to issue apologies publicly for this one).    Instead use Avira: http://www.download.com/Avira-AntiVir-Pe... along with an Email scanner ( http://www.spamdel.com/ OR http://www.glenn.delahoy.com/software/fi... )      Do not use more than one Antivirus on active mode (it is OK to have one active and others in passive (manual scan) mode), one Firewall (no options there as war between them will shut down your communication system if you have more than one), one good cleaner and two or three Anti spyware/Malware (they each detect something that the others have not seen) but have at least one of each (for security). There is no excuse to leave yourself wide open.      Anti-Malware/Spyware suggestions:    Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware: http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Ant... is a good choice and has gotten many people out of jams.     Spybot: http://www.download.com/Spybot-Search-am... is also a good choice if you use it regularly.      Cleaner suggestion:     Glary Utilities: http://www.glaryutilities.com/gu.html to remove junk files or remnants of installs (there is always some).    Do not use Ccleaner ( In my time at helping others, I have found it more destructive than helpful and I had to rebuild systems nuked by it in the past ).      ( A word of caution, be sure to read all help files completely so that you can apply fixes right the first time ! )|`|hnzV6yuBaa	Use Ad-Aware and Spybot Search & Destroy.

3dKy4C4naa	Many reasons...<br>  1. You are downloading file with few seeds or too many leechers. In this case several torrent trackers give more or all seeders to people who has high ratio. To get high ratio you need to seed yourself. I have a very slow connection and I found solution for myself. I'm using TorrentRatioKeeper to upload more and get higher ratio.<br>  2. Your ISP can slowdown your torrent download speed. To check it you need to see how many seeds you have, if you have many seeds and speed is bad, then it can be ISP.<br>  3. You can see many seeds on torrent, but no available for you. Like this 0(22). 22 is total count, 0 - available for you. It means tracker limits your downloading. Maybe you have low ratio... This way you need to upload/seed more.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|6TOdYBkaaa	well it all depends on seeders (people who help you download that have completed the download) and leachers (people who leach off of you). from what you stated before you have before downloaded fast which means one of 2 things: the file you dwonloaded had a lot of seeders 2. your internet is fast but this file that you been trying to download a 1.2 Gb file for weeks now has little seeders. if your internet is just slow use this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVq2GkzNrY8." rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVq2GkzNr...</a>|`|6dtAmXcAaa	Make sure the seeders are higher than the leechers on the file and also make sure you have a lot of seeders. You can also make sure that your internet service provider (ISP) has not throttled your internet because you were uploading too much. Contact them.|`|a8L9BBiDaa	go on youtube a search "how to inrease bit torent speeds" and if that doesn't work make sure the file has enough seeders or else it will go very slow|`|cxaUYijFaa	download the one with the most seeders!|`|x1YZgCCnaa	It all depends on the seeders, if there aren't a lot of seeders it wont go fast.|`|iLozr2aSaa	Depends on the seeders, and also when you make something (legal, fake) available, you get more bandwidth (when available).

OBIuPW2waa	Hello,<br>  <br>  It sounds like you are infected with a trojan. So I think you are having a hard time because trojan's are not exactly viruses. So most anti-virus programs will not remove them, because they do not see them as viruses.<br>  <br>  A couple of month's back I suffered a nasty trojan infection.  It completely screwed my computer up.  Every time I would get on the internet I would get blasted with pop-up after pop-up.<br>  <br>  It got so bad, I thought I would have to get a new computer.  So out of frustration I called Geek Squad.  They wanted $200 to look at my computer, and that didn't include fixing it.  No Way!<br>  <br>  It wasn't until I was searching google for a trojan remover that I came across the solution to my problem.<br>  <br>  I found a website that gave honest reviews of the best spyware removal programs.  So I checked into it, and the best product, AdwareAlert is also capable of removing Trojans.<br>  <br>  I quickly downloaded AdwareAlert and scanned my computer.<br>  <br>  It found all the trojan worms, and spyware infections that none of my other programs could find and delete. <br>  <br>  I have been running AdwareAlert now for the last couple of months, and it has been doing an awesome job at keeping my computer spyware free. <br>  <br>  I never have pop-ups anymore, and my computer is running like a dream.<br>  <br>  You can Visit the website I found in google below.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.honestspywarereview.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.honestspywarereview.com</a><br>  <br>  Hope this was helpful.
9eae15fd25d6b9552deee228486e0aaaaa	Heres how it goes:<br>  <br>  -CMS is good for constantly changing information and high interoperability with other things.<br>  -HTML is good for mostly 'static' website.<br>  -CMS is easy for any 'noob' to change as it has a WYSIWYG editor usually built in.<br>  -HTML usually requires someone skilled to make changes.<br>  <br>  I personally tend to like to use them as it cuts back a lot of work, and is easy for the customer to change.<br>  <br>  To learn about them, take a look at www.joomla.org, there should be some great information there to get you started.|`|SNBG0Y5eaa	CMS are not *crucial* in the sense that web sites won't work without them. Everything can be coded by hand.<br>  <br>  But especially for very large web sites and where you want other people to be able to edit content easily, CMS makes life so much easier for everyone. If a company has been using a particular CMS package, then it would make sense they would require that skill. <br>  <br>  There are a lot of different ones out there, so it's hard to recommend one spot to start because different companies might use different things, such as smaller sites might use a PHP based CMS, whereas larger enterprise web applications use Java or .asp.<br>  <br>  Just familiarize yourself by what they are and then start by focusing in that one area, such as PHP. Some popular open source CMS packages include: WordPress, Joomla, Drupal, Moodle.<br>  <br>  Not surprising you didn't learn about them in school. Schools teach you the foundational academic and theoretical stuff, which is important. But for practical technologies, especially newer ones that keep changing, it's hard to develop a long-lasting curriculum on them. If you want to get into an IT career, get used to the fact that you will have to study and keep yourself updated on newer technologies as they develop all the time. It's actually good if you don't like a static job.|`|75nbESJUaa	The online jobs listed request server-side technologies and that is usually tiered framework. Every installation will be a complex custom convergence of several technologies. But, think about it. The money is where commerce is happening. When commerce is the end-goal, then CMS is the reason for being.<br>  <br>  CMS is abstract, but allows a closer modeling of life, more so than OOPs. it was my choice in academia to pursue the math / coder side of CIS when perhaps I should have signed up for DBA with the business courses. It takes the business courses background to model that CMS as a unit.|`|mbgVo5vYaa	Let me answer your questions in parts.<br>  <br>  Are they really so important?<br>  If content updates are important, then CMS is important.Cos it allows quick updates with prodding code/design. Not to mention some CMS communities have huge extension libraries where you can find almost every single possible app you want.<br>  <br>  Does anyone here design websites that doesn't use a CMS?<br>  I don't do that cos I can't really program<br>  <br>  Can anyone provide me with any tutorials or good, cheap, CMS?<br>  I'm into Joomla cos it's user-level friendly. But heard a lot of programmers don't really like it. But all the same Joomla has a huge following.<br>  <br>  Others include Drupal(good one to look at also), Cushy, Wordpress, Mediawiki... and the list runs forever.<br>  <br>  All the sites Ive built, Ive never used a CMS and I haven't had any complaints.<br>  Yeah that's because they haven't a need to update. If you charge them on every update and your client needs updates very often, you will get complains.<br>  <br>  Bonus<br>  I dont want to have an IT career, I actually hate programming.<br>  CMS is your way to go if you intend to stay with web designs. Less programming more configuring. But if you are going to leave the web industry totally, then screw it. CMS doesn't make a difference to you. I assume the CMS you are talking about here is web CMS.

LF2oShTLaa	This is common for Itunes to auto add songs that it finds on your computer, It is not the songs, I have downloaded tons of music, from Limewire and everyone (happens on the newest versions of software) will get added automatically onto my Itunes library. If you are worried about virus' from downloads get some antivirus, OR and even easier way is to go to <a href="http://www.virustotal.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.virustotal.com/</a>  and scan your file you have downloaded before using the file. This is a widely used completely legal, and legit. Many people use this program before uploading (unless your a hacker) to P2P networks, it is of high quality itself since it uses many different virus scanning programs in one to scan a wide variety of virus' and other morbid software's which may be included with that new tune.<br>  <br>  Goodluck hope this helped.

pOaE0fWOaa	You seem a little confused about this. You can't partition 2 drives as one. Yopu could set them up as a RAID array, but with the quite different sizes and speeds, you may have problems in doing so. RAID 0 arrays would allow for this but if one drive fails you lose ALL data on both. Doing a RAIS 1 or mirror array would have to be done at the size of the smaller drive and wouldn't allow you to use the empty space. The only advantage to this is that you would have a back up of your data should  one drive fail. The major drawback to RAID in whatever array is that you would have to reformat BOTH drives in accordance with the array requirements., meaning both drives data would be obliterated<br>  <br>  I stumbled over this a few weeks ago. It will probably be something like what you want. No partitioning or RAID arrays, just a simple tool.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.j-a-associates.com/vdc.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.j-a-associates.com/vdc.htm</a><br>  <br>  Good luck.

xmST9yMAaa	I think the short answer is not without connecting to a switch of some sort.  Look - no point in reinventing the wheel.  If your only issue is the length of your cable - go get the proper length and be done with it.  or get a wireless adaptor and get rid of the need for a cable altogether.|`|stEFmt1qaa	You cannot connect you desktop to you laptop and get internet connectivity on you desktop.  What you need is a wifi PCI card for your desktop pc.  This will allow your desktop to pick up the wifi from your wireless modem.  Or get some connecters and link to ethernet cables you have together and plug them into your router or modem if they will reach.  You can grab a wifi PCI card at best buy for under a hundred dollars.  Good luck.

5GIQi96Saa	You will need a SATA HARD DISK of whatever capacity you want. Just remember to say SATA...open up the hard disk and measure its width. The sizes come as 3.5 and 2.5 and you probably need the 2.5 one.|`|t5sYXwSqaa	You need a SATA drive and as it sounds like it is a desktop machine a 3.5 inch of any size you want. As you have this drive already it would make sense to fit the other drive as a second unit. All you will need is a second SATA lead and of course a second SATA connection on your MOBO. Hope this helps.

pOaE0fWOaa	ATI used to have poor drivers. I feel they have managed to get past this. I find the last 3 years or so with the regular monthly driver updates that problems do not last should they crop up. I am less than happy with Nvidia's stealthy removal of various features and settings. These are usually related to older cards but to me, as a user of older hardware, it makes each driver change a struggle. I have used Nvidia cards since the Riva128 back in  1998 or so. I was very happy with the GeForce 4 series. My latest card is a GF 7600GS, which doesn't work very well with the one monitor I have allotted it under Ubuntu. It doesn't let me change the resolution to the proper one. My 3 other ATI cards, (9600, X1600, HD4670) all work perfectly under both Windows and Ubuntu, both using the ATI drivers.<br>  <br>  Good luck.<br>  <br>  BTW all my monitors are LCD and using DVI connectors.

stEFmt1qaa	You will need to call your internet service provider, Verizon, and ask them which modems are compatible with their service.  Or just go to best buy and ask them which are compatible with your service, usually it will say it right on the box, for instance AT&T has their own line of modems.  So see what best buy has for Verizon, and make sure you get a modem that has wireless capabilities so you will not need to by a router as well.  The new modems are modems and routers in one.  Once purchased follow the instructions that came w/ the new modem.  Usually you can set it up by yourself pretty easily by following the instructions Exactly.  But in some cases you could need a new or different type of IP address.  Sooo, set up the new modem as instructed and try to open internet explorer.  If the web page is not displayed contact Verizon technical support they will be able to easily walk you through the setup and get you up and running.  Good Luck.

AA10954273	A lot of them simply don't even know about open source software.  Others are simply afraid.  I work at a university, and my boss is a huge MS fan - he'd never even heard of open source apps like OpenOffice or Gimp, and he doesn't trust them.  It's frustrating because we have users who want Photoshop but could get by with Gimp or Paint.net, but I'm the only person advocating for that solution.  Another problem is that many people don't know how to use the open source applications.  I've worked at schools that actually teach classes on MS Office; students wouldn't have a clue when faced with OpenOffice, even though they're similar.<br>  <br>  It's very frustrating.  However, this is one potential good that may come out of the economic downturn.|`|KTz3qpCvaa	The smart ones already do. Microsoft relies on peoples ignorance to sell their products, other than the OS itself people do not require any other MS products, as there are always alternatives that are cheaper or open source. How are people suppose to switch to OpenOffice if they don't know about it's existence, or that there even is something other than MS Office.<br>  <br>  Think about. Most people call a word processor, Microsoft Word, they call spread sheets excel, and they always refer to slideshows as Powerpoint; it is that heavily brain washed into them.|`|slhPQvc3aa	You have a perfectly valid point there however if you start using different software to what the user is already used to you would have to train them on new software, this means you are paying people to learn how to use the new system and your work won't get done. If you think about the average office computer user, they wont have Linux at home they will most likely have xp or vista as with Microsoft office. That person will have gone to a computer shop and said i want a computer that i can type up work on and they gave them lets say a vista machine with office 2007, if they can then go to work knowing that its the same as at home and they don't need to learn anything new then they wont get confused or need any training. I have often wondered this myself but its probably best to keep the open source to the servers where only experts can access, that way less things SHOULD go wrong.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|CpHMmd2haa	It is basically a matter of education. <br>  <br>  Part of the education can start here at BOSS Publications...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jcbydwi.prophp.org/" rel="nofollow">http://jcbydwi.prophp.org/</a><br>  <br>  The current BOSS Publications "Profiting from the New Global Resource" details the advantages and benefits open source offers to business end-users.

KlRo6JLQaa	If you have a backup, you can just put it in the dishwasher.  If you leave it to dry for a couple of weeks it will work just fine.    If have to do it quickly, you can pop the keys off and wash them by themselves.  Use a lever to pry them off, but make sure that the pressure is evenly distributed, especially on the larger keys (spacebar, enter, shift).|`|4d0hRsYYaa	I would unplug it from your computer and wipe it down with a damp cloth, then wipe with a dry one.  If you have a lot of time you could pop off all of the keys and go that route.  I only do that if I have a particularly sticky area.  Then you can use a can of air to get all of the crumbs out. :)|`|scOcY1tMaa	I find that the quickest way to do that is to remove the keys.  Do this by "lifting" up the keys with a dull flat instrument like a butter knife.  Be careful not to "nick" or damage the keys.  They pop up quite easily.  Watch that springs under the keys don't fly off and you lose them, if that what type of keyboard layout ya gots.  Newer ones have the springs hidden and it is no problemo.  Put them in a container with a mild soap (dish detergent), an ya swish 'em around.  Yours may need some elbow grease, so use a rag or sumptin.    Oh yeah!!    Don't forget to make a drawing of yer keyboard showing the key locations if'n ya don know whar them thar key goes back to, heh, heh, imagine puttin em back if'n ya don't know where they goes ta.    Are yuh finished yet???  Keep smiling ;-)|`|g0ym4gdbaa	you can acutally pop the keys off and clean them that way.    there is also a dishwasher technique. recommend googling that one though.    one other technique would be     turn the keyboard so the keys are facing at a 90 degree angle towards you and gently tap the keyboard on the table and then pull off the bottom row so you can dump the crud out.

XlyLakYAaa	Dim has a good description of a CRT screen (Cathode Ray Tube).  LCD and Plasma screens are different.<br>  <br>  An LCD screen uses a liquid crystal that polarizes when a voltage is applied (like polarized sunglasses glasses).  Using this polarization effect, they cross it with another polarized layer and then have a back-light.  For the different colors, different colored screens are used.<br>  <br>  I forget how Plasma works exactly, but basically it's filled with a gas and when voltage is applied, the gas gets "excited" and emits photons in various colors.|`|ja7J2cE2aa	The inside of a TV screen is actually a vacuum: the colors that are displayed are electrons fired at a screen that is at the front of the sealed chamber, located just under a sheet of glass that forms the very outermost part of the screen you see.  <br>  <br>  Really, there isn't much matter at all inside a TV screen.  If you've ever taken one of a television, it really looks like a gigantic light bulb with a weird adapter at the end.  I forget why they make the inside of the screen a vacuum, but I guess it would be to make sure nothing inside the TV interferes with the picture being displayed.  <br>  <br>  I kind of wish I knew how LCD screens worked.  From what the name implies, I'd assume that an LCD screen is made of, well, liquid crystal.  I don't know much about things other than old-school TV's...

See if the command prompt or the registry is for student accounts. With these two, you'll have quite a bit of power, but unless you just want to cause as much damage as you can, which isn't really ethical, you'll need to be creative. The ethical thing to do would be to find your way into the system through cunning and intelligence, and only make it obvious that you've compromised the system, not abuse the power you've come by for yourself. For example, if you can access cmd.exe, then change the password of an Admin, and change their personal settings, change the wallpaper to something humorous(if you can't, open notepad and type in the following to get a something like a copy of it:<br>  <br>            @echo off<br>            cmd<br>            echo on<br>  <br>            or type in "start command.com" save as a batch file and change to all file not text). Don't delete the public drive. It's not cool, and it'll get you arrested or whatever.<br>  <br>     2. See if you can procure an administrator password. It depends on your school, as does the last instruction: if they're intelligent, you'll never get near one, if they're not so sharp, all you have to do is wait. or type in cmd (net users administrator *)<br>     3. Practise reading people's keystrokes with a friend, regularly have "problems" with your account during class requiring the teacher to log in, etc. etc. If an administrator or teacher leaves themselves logged in, see what you can do while they're gone. If it's an admin, find the remote desktop connection to the server and copy it to a place where you can access it on your normal account. This is a file, hopefully with the Admin's password saved on it, that will connect to the server, allowing you unfettered access to the network. Again, tweak a few things, etc., don't destroy anything.<br>            * Social Engineering is the single best way to access a system, or so say many. It often requires no techy knowledge to instigate, but the more you have, the better. For example, leave a USB stick beside the teacher's computer in the computer-room/library/classroom, with an autoexec file that compromises the account in some way, similarly you can doctor a USB mouse to contain a USB drive with a similar autoexec file. Write a program that looks like the login screen, or some login screen that your Admin might use, and ask him to enter their password. The possibilities are endless.<br>            * If you want, crack the Admin using software, or use software to do whatever you want to the system. It might be easy, but it isn't fun.<br>  <br>  Or<br>  <br>  1. Download pwdump to the computer that you are using. If the site is blocked then you should download it to a thumb drive and put it in the computer 2. Right click in a any folder and then New>Text Document 3. Open it and type "command.com" 4.

2LbTrlQnaa	You don't say what brand the cartridges are or what is wrong with your Lexmark.  If you have a big Asda close to you, they sell basic Lexmark printers for around 30 - and the cartridges are also much cheaper than in Currys or a conventional computer store|`|oOcQSylMaa	i agree to the person above. the best site 4 cheap cartridge's is  http://www.premierink.com
AA11340085	When you will install the driver for printer then you will find the icom in icon tray not on toolbar.
GQ6K85LPaa	NO you can't    For a start the carts should not fit, so doing so would damage the printer physically    Then running it with the wrong colour will take forever to flush out later, costing WAY more than the new ink would cost.    Just go buy some ink, it's simpler, safer and quicker|`|38MPmsaKaa	If your cartridges have no chip and all the same size it can be done.  But you would mess up all your printouts, because the driver has no idea what you did. If your printer refuses to print because one  cartridge is empty or missing, the cartridges surely have chips.  If you replace the catridge with another colour you have to change  the chips as well. Going back to normal, use the clean printhead function or your first printouts will get wrong coloures.  But first of all. If you just NEED a printout, tell your printer to  print black only.|`|7101ca25abf1e27ea43268cf9eca7944aa	I'm not sure if you can or not but I wouldn't advise it, in case it done some damage to your printer.|`|ulQcx5aGaa	no it won't mess your printer up, but it will mess up the things you print. Because for color printing, the computer mixes yellow, magenta and cyan, so if you put black in place of the cyan, where there should be cyan, there will be black, so when you print colored stuff, it might appear darker, or maybe even totally black. So no, it won't mess up your printer, but it's not very advisable to do so since it will mess up the things you print in color.

EdVjJQRCaa	With a quad Processor I would never go below 700w but the watts are not as important as the amps on the +12v rail they need to be above 15  amps. the more rails the better. Power supplies are the most over looks part of the computer but they are the power of everything if they do not supply enough power your system will die sooner and run hotter. I would suggest http://www.coolermaster.com/products/pro...    for one but do not go under 700w or you will have problems later if you are a gamer.|`|k8MaZA6haa	For me i would say .5 volt|`|DeCI2FaFaa	I would say probably 600-650W and probably 23-30A on the 12V rail.

Only bringing it out and turning it on to update the back up.    That said...remember this: It's not a question of IF a drive will fail, but when.      Like car tires, hard drives will fail eventually, some take years, others take months or less.|`|V5xHaIAcaa	With all due respect, you might be asking the wrong question.    Western Digital makes a USB Passport drive (I have two of them)  that are Password Protected, are 350 gb in size and are self-powered from the USB connector itself.  The cost, if memory serves, about  130 bucks each.  Try newegg,com - I have been very happy with them.    I have a big heads up for you though.  I can break just about any password.  I would not, if I were you, consider that to be a brag.    My point is, spend the 100 bucks for something called PGP (pretty good privacy) sounds simplistic, but it is an encryption program that is so powerful as to be considered as unbreakable by those in the know.  Go to pgp.com for more info    I am a computer forensics specialist for the Fed's    Good luck

1NBe2Jo7aa	Well, your computer only has a 300w power supply, so unless you upgrade that, that will be your biggest restriction. Also, I am pretty sure that ati cards work better with amd processors (that might be just a myth though). For your requirements, you would be best off going with an ati card, as ati beats nvidia at the middle range cards, and nvidia beats ati at the very high end range (check out the 295gtx). I personally would recommend the ati radeon 4670, only I don't know if that will work on a 300w power supply (worked on my 350w dell psu). I know for a fact that the ati 3650 will work on a 300w psu, but that is not much of an upgrade from your 8500gt. So, I would look around and see details about your power supply and see if it can handle the hd 4670 (or the 4650), as I have heard people have done that without problems. If not, then the next best choice would probably be the 8600gt (or 9600), as I know that will work on a 300w psu.|`|ChBK5Lv9aa	I would recommend this open box MSI 8800GT-  http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...   The open box just means that it doesn't come with the adapters or cables, just the new card. I have this card, and even though it is a few years old(mine is only 8 months old) it can still play most games, Crysis included, at respectable settings. I can play on mainstream settings on 1680 x 1050 and get about 40FPS average in Crysis Warhead. Just make sure that you have a PSU over 400W. If not, I use this Rosewill 500W one just fine for $45-  http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...|`|XlyLakYAaa	probably a 9600GT, though a $100 upgrade wouldn't be that big a boost.  If you could afford a 9800GT (around $120), that would be a significant upgrade.
wbiGMVqGaa	Try different USB port, or change the cable you are using to connect it.  I had similar problem with my ipod. When I changed the cable the problem was fixed.
AA12180741	winlogin.exe is added to the system as a result of the RANDEX.E virus.\r It is an IRC Trojan horse gives remote access to your computer using IRC.<br>  it depends if you have a anti virus on the pc, i would also advise downloading malwarebytes if you google for this install it choose update until it finds no more updates avail, and then choose FULL scan .. and choose al the hard drives DONT use the internet while its scanning it can take some time over an hour in some cases and it will find any trojans/viruses and remove them|`|V8FdzAAAaa	It is safe, without it you would not be able to login, logout, and load important user data.

MQngKAJCaa	It's not that great for gaming. It has a poor videocard. Even though it is nVidia, it's an onboard chip, that bums off the ram for memory. Also, the processor is slightly lacking. I would try finding a laptop with a dedicated videocard, and try finding a 64 bit processor over 2.4GHz. 2.1 isn't bad, but it could be better, especially since it only has 1mb of cache (my Intel Core2Duo 2.4GHz has 4mb). This computer appears to be more media geared than gaming.

BA2iv94qaa	That is perfectly fine. USB was designed to be hot-swappable. You will not stuff up your laptop.

I use Linux, and I'm plugging stuff in and out of my two ports all day with no issues. I know Windows can be a bit screwy about this kind of thing, so you take your chances.

Macs do not do the same thing. But I will admit, although their problems are fewer, they do have some. I do agree with some of the above posts, and would recommend getting a USB hub.

On those computers, unplugging the device without stopping it first can result in a frozen computer which needs to be restarted.    If you unplug the device and your computer is fine, I wouldn't worry about it.|`|1NBe2Jo7aa	Mostly, it is just to make sure that there is no data transfer between the device and the computer. You really don't need to safely eject the device as long as you aren't transferring data (music, videos) to the devices. It does no harm to your computer, and the only harm it would do to your device is maybe corrupted files that you won't be able to use.|`|PPIcNdAfaa	In Windows, you right click Safely Remove Ejectable Hardware, or whatever the option is.    Then find you're removable data and hit Stop.|`|wKpdzVMDaa	This is to prevent any information still writing to the device from being corrupted or lost. Stopping the service ensures that all the information has been transferred completely before removing. Sometimes if you remove the device without ejecting it properly may cause the computer to blue screen.

Select the Dialog box item and save it as something like "toppingsdialog.vb". In the dialog, add a label for text asking if the user want's toppings. place the code:     "toppingsdialog.ShowDialog"     (without quotes) where you want the user to be prompted. Use an If Then statement to tell if the user wants toppings, something like:    "If toppingsdialog.DialogResult = Windows.Forms.DialogResult.OK Then"     (without quotes) and add your then statement. For a cancel answer, just use:    "If toppingsdialog.DialogResult = Windows.Forms.DialogResult.Cancel Then"     (without quotes) and add your then statement.    Hope it works :)
rFUUmZgwaa	Alpha and Omega? Another crazy answer.  You don't prove something by quoting some statement that some guy once wrote or said.  Give it up.  Your only anwers will always be repeating something that someone supposedly said,  and even if he did say them (in another language presumably translated correctly),  what someone says is never the truth just because he said it.  In fact, considering the subject about which noone has any first hand knowledge, noone knows anything.

eYeMy8QSaa	well could be a couple of reason  first i got to piont out windows vista doesnt have anything to do with it  and just cause your computer can burn it doesnt mean it can play it  if you know about video coding like avi ect., im gonna say this on the asomtion you know what video coding is.  most dvd - rw (w - means it can burn) can burn almost any video codec (avi, mpeg, mpeg 4) but windows media player may not play it   try downloading a codec which will cost you  i suggest vlc player  its free and you can play almost any video coding.

RyvKws7Laa	ONLY if YOU prefer Macintosh OS X over any of the Windows OS choices.  Not what people on the Internet like, but if you can test it out and find it better for you.  Then, from what you describe, I would go Mac over PC.    Otherwise, you may as well save yourself the money.  The Mac won't access the Internet, play DVDs, run iTunes, or run MS Office that much better than a comparable laptop.  The key though is that you actually get a comparable laptop.  There are tones of Windows laptops out there.  Many of them are cheaper than Macs, but if you actually go into the specs (of what's offered hardware wise) they are not actually comparable.  So just read carefully when doing comparisons.    If you do really like the idea of owning a Mac though and maybe want to save a few bucks, you could consider getting a previous generation  laptop.  The new aluminum ones have the fancy new case and only a slight hardware improvement.  So go to Amazon or Apple Refurb store and snag one of the ones being liquidated.  You could get an amazing MacBook Pro for like $1499/$1599.    But again, you need to go and try out the Mac OSX hands on for a while.  Only if you truly like it better than Windows should you really make the jump.  Otherwise, the cost premium of the Mac isn't specifically worth it.    Edit:  The previous reply is wrong on one note, Macs are the primary base for editing of live action.  Whether its Avid or FCP.  Linux is second (especially for compositing).  PCs (because of Windows inefficiencies is used rarest of all in and out of the studio system).|`|2LHgmq97aa	Mercuri is 100% correct,  and the following is also...  Take a look at the Toshiba Qosimo  http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,232...    I know an Independent Film Maker who uses PCs to make films also...  http://news.cnet.com/HP-does-lunch-with-...  Look at Dreamworks Website, look at Studio and then Technolofy of Animation http://news.cnet.com/HP-does-lunch-with-...  (drkblze is wrong)    With the Mac you are paying significantly more for lower spec hardware.   Why? Because people don't realize that Mac uses a subset of PC hardware...    A number of PCs can also run OS X (Mac OS)  http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=os+... as well just that Apple makes it illegal in order to get Market share.. The reason why Mac can run native Windows  is because it is using a subset of PC hardware,    If you decide to buy a Mac for running Windows, you will still have to get the same virus/spyware protection, and run into the same issues as a regular PC.    Now is OS X worth buying a Mac?    I would say no... for the following reasons...    WINDOWS ADVANTAGES:    Aprox 90% of the market is Windows. Most PCs include windows already pre-installed.  1) A number of websites still require Internet Explorer to view and IE for Mac Stinks (it is really ies4osx which is the Windows IE version running really buggy on OS X and illegal if you don't have a legitimate copy of Windows, too many problems with it).  2) More supported peripherals (printers and other things you hook into the computer) on Windows.  3) Many more games  4) Like the Dock on OS X (Mac)? google/yahoo rocketdock, objectdoc.    LINUX ADVANTAGES:    1) Install Linux, and then get tons of software for free.Update software easily and automatically. (Checking a checkbox in either two ways to install (Add/Remove or Synaptic Package Manager), search for something you want, check a box and click apply)  2) Like the Mac OS X effects? go yahoo/google COMPIZ FUSION. It can do just about any cool effect a Mac can do and more...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Fbk52Mk...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3gkX9HDf...  (there is no flickering when you use it like on the video, not sure why the person has the flicker)  3) Like the Mac OS X Doc? google/yahoo Cairo Dock, avant window navigator.  http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x3rf5q_...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0hzi22g2...  4) It is faster/MORE SECURE.

Mac OS X has viruses (which is significantly on the rise), a friend of mine has a virused Mac. As more users use Macs, more viruses will come out for it. Especially when users think "they are safe".  http://infosecurity.us/?p=4005  http://blogs.chron.com/techblog/archives...  http://www.macsimumnews.com/index.php/ar...    Mac OS X was hacked in 2006 under 30 minutes, and hacked within 2 minutes in a contest in 2008. Linux and Vista were not able to be hacked until another day when restrictions were lowered.  All macs are standardized with Cameras, if your system gets hacked, the hacker would more likely be able to turn on your camera.  Please Note: All OS's have vulnerabilities.  |`|XlyLakYAaa	Well, it turns out you know nothing of Apple laptops at all then.  They are NOT better for video editing.  Case in point: Dreamworks uses PCs exclusively.  They are not more efficient.  And they can get viruses and spyware (it's just more rare).  "Hipness" is relative.  I think many Windows-based computers are more hip and have more style than most Macs. Macs are just too plain for me.    Anyway... umm... I can't think of any reason to shell out extra money for a Mac unless you just REALLY want a Mac.  You'd basically be paying more for the same thing and you'd still have to buy MS Office separately.|`|MQngKAJCaa	OSX is more resource efficient. My Macbook Pro runs 2 times longer in OSX than in XP per battery charge. Also, Vista, which is the only OS PCs come installed with now, is piled full of glitches, while OSX is a little more glitch free. Macs are thinner, better looking, are more stable (because the OSX programers know what hardware is going to be running it), and are more powerful than comparable laptops. PC Mag has done trials and found Macs can boot faster, shut down faster, and run the same programs faster in Windows than any similar PC. Besides, you can always put Windows on a Mac. You cannot (for the most part) put OSX on a PC.    Oh, and Dreamworks use plenty on Macs. They use OSX and Linux, no windows. Linux runs primarily on their servers and renderfarms while OSX runs on their desktops. Seriously. And who knows nothing?|`|WSgvL4Csaa	Apples are better and more hip.  It is a fact.  People that say otherwise do not know what they are talking about.  They are far, far less prone to virus, trojan horse, worms, etc and spyware.  It is rare for a MAC to get infected.  I have had MAC computers for years and never have had an infection issue.    The operating system is built in firmware and this is one reason that the computer is less prone to infections.     Many video editting pros do use MACs because they are seamless and perform very well.  They are splendid for music (Garageband) also.  My son, an 11th grader has done wonderful projects with a MAC laptop that has a built-in camera.  Many newspapers and publishers use MAC because of the power and ease of use also.  I have found that the MAC MS Office Suite is less clunky than the PC version.    MACs can also run PC applications and can boot-up in PC mode so that they function exactly as a PC.  Boot-Camp is one program that allows either booting-up as a MAC or as a PC.

NkTC4eGcaa	Photos on Flickr are under copyright. Basically meaning that you can't save or print them. The only way I know to get around this is to do a print screen (using the print screen key on your keyboard) and pasting to a Paint document. Then you can crop the photo and save/print from there.     Hope this helps! :)
iT4gn3z8aa	LCD's as with most electronics have what's called an ETO: Estimated time of operation. This is just what it sounds like; an estimate of how long the piece of equipment will work. You can call the manufacturer to find out, or it may be on a label or some place on the web. LCD's are no exception, because they only last so long (I'd guess 80-100K hours). I would say turn it off when you don't use it because you want it to last longer.    Plus!! Most importantly, you're saving energy! Don't leave it on when you don't need it. :D|`|GgBdQqrdaa	i beleive lcd has around an 80,000 hour life span.... so if  leave it on all the time, the chances are small that it gets a burn in or stops working...      i also leave mine on 24/7|`|ffqsWfZtaa	I use the monitor power switch if I'm leaving my PC on downloading or whatever when I'm out.  Saves power, reduces fire risk etc.    Can't think how the monitor could affect the computer performance or cause it to freeze.    If you realy want you can leave the monitor on all day for several years.    If your pc is sleeping and you hit the desk the pc will probably see a mouse movement and wake up. Hitting the desk much more likely to hang your PC than anything to do with the screen    Vibration generally is not good for electronics, sudden shock when on may damage or affect the life of the monitors back light tubes. Much more shock resistant when off.
Em5OE17caa	When you plug your iPod in, on the left-side panel click on your iPod. You should get the screen showing a picture of your iPod along with some option, and finally a memory meter at the bottom. Above it are a few options with some checkboxes next to them. To make your iPod work as a hard drive, place a check next to the box labeled "Enable Disk Use". You can then copy and paste files onto your iPod through My Computer as if it were a hard drive. However, if you put music or video files on it through that process, the won't play. Music and video files will only work when put through iTunes first.

You make a form in HTML that submits to a php page (or to itself with Javascript) to send the email.

2d1281aa57d4a1706e1d2a23da968188aa	It's not your video card... videos on Youtube are choppy because they are generally low-quality compressed files, and due to high demand the connection to their servers has ups & downs.    Your Internet connection may be the best in the world, but when the number of requests exceed what THEIR connection can simultaneously handle, you'll see stuttering and interruptions.    Even integrated graphics chipsets can handle smooth display of Youtube video clips.|`|b301fdd2f7f0f686b01337263980d14baa	The quality of videos on YouTube is generally choppy for everyone....it's not our video cards, it's that the videos are compressed for upload reasons & this compromises their quality.  You may notice that it varies from one YouTube video to another. This is because people use different compression ratios on their videos before uploading them to YouTube.    It's the source (the video file itself) that's the problem ... not your video card.

XuxZPdNdaa	Try changing the resolution on your screen so you can fit more stuff on your screen, kinda like widescreen for TV... go to control panel, settings, display, and change your resolution to the highest setting.      You will be required to restart your comp for settings to take effect.     Other than that, you'll just need to get a bigger monitor.      There is a last option, but it only works on text... while holding onto the CTRL key, scroll your mouse up and down, see if it enlarges or minimizes your images.

PPIcNdAfaa	Anything less than 1,024MB is bad. I recommend 4GBs atleast. I'd suggest uninstalling any programs you do not need, and get another hard drive to store movies and music on.    For example, I have two hard drives, my main 30 GB drive and a secondary drive of about 20GB for music and movies. That second drive saves me about 8GB for programs and other important stuff.|`|SeUHFnSmaa	That depends, How many programs do you have installed or more importantly how many of those are running at one time?Programs like antivirus and P2P programs sometimes sit in the background and eat up memory and resources even though you might not be using them at that time. Memory is one of the easiest and most cost effective upgrades a users can do. See if you can upgrade to 2GBs of ram, it should cost maybe $30.

7KkRkseUaa	well 100 to 200 is a pretty big margin so im opting for the top end of your budget!   the HD 4870 is 166 or the GTX 260 for 206  they are both very powerful cards and excellent value.   you'll need a pretty decent power supply and a fair sized case too,you can just whack them into any old pc.  if you cant power one of these cards then either the HD 4850 or 9800GTX for around 120-150 would also be good.|`|48e9baf113e4951f779199c900a19f63aa	Uhhh... anything in the 9000 series from Nvidia, GTX.

Whatever you do, dont get a GTX 260. They are the best card available but at it's price its a huge waste of money. the 8800s and 9800 can run anything you need at full resolution, making the GTX 260 surplus to requirement. The GTX 260 is more future proof but by the time GTX 260s are needed, they will be much much cheaper.    8800s can run programs just as fast as 9800s at the moment while 8800s are much cheaper. Get a high end 8800 would be the best option. (so like a 8800GTX, 8800GT)|`|vRImZ32Maa	In my opinion, go for a NVIDIA graphics card.  Now I would recommend a 9 series, probably 9800 GX2 or 9800 GTX+  Here is a scale for NVIDIA Graphics cards:  http://www.nvidia.com/object/graphics_ca...|`|837xgMwLaa	As long as you've got PCI-E you can have any of the newer range of video cards, you may need to get additional power cables if your PSU/card does not come with them. The 8800s are awesome cards, I'd go with either an 8800, a 9800, or a HD4850 (ATI). The 9600s are good cards also, but anything lower (like a 9500) is a waste of money. Get at least 512mb graphics memory. I always use eBuyer (a uk site).

3GmG8uQzaa	Many times I have stared at my computer thinking "How do I fix my pc because it keeps crashing?"<br>  Unfortunately there is no simple answer! I used to think this problem was related to buying cheap computers but after buying various laptops and desktops at different price ranges there is one common theme, eventually they will all crash at some stage! <br>  Friends will often think I am a pc expert and will call me asking "How do I fix my pc when it keeps crashing?" Well start by asking yourself these questions...<br>  Have your children be on the pc? Kids are great at downloading spyware by mistake! They will also click on numerous pop up pages and will often change your settings!<br>  Another possible reason your pc keeps crashing is that you have overloaded it! If your pc only has 64mb RAM memory and you install graphic, gaming and other software the chances are that your system will not be able to cope with your software! Most PC's now come with at least 512mb RAM so it is worth upgrading if your pc is not at this level.<br>  However the most common reason that your pc keeps crashing is that it has a virus! Many trojan virus can cause your computer to reboot immediately once all programs have been launched, this can drive you mad and it is not fun as you are helpless!<br>  Best option is to install anti virus software and make sure you only visit trusted websites. If all else fails it is time to reformat your hard drive and wipe your pc clean, this can take hours and you will probably need the data recovery disc that you should have got when you bought the pc.<br>  Recommend tool:  <a href="http://toptenantispywareviews.com" rel="nofollow">http://toptenantispywareviews.com</a> [if you do not have one]|`|xvuAQ0DAaa	Make a backup of the files you want to kep, then reformat and re-install windows yourself then put the photo and music files back on.

Skip the 9500GT- there's no reason not to get the 9600GT for just a few bucks more.

DjR6rKuUaa	hi  Possible Cause of Code 80048820  There are a variety of causes of this error:    1) Incorrect Proxy Setting for Internet Explorer.    2) softpub.dll may have become unregistered.    3) Your system clock may be showing an incorrect time -  or date! (Wrong time is the most likely cause of 80048820).    4) Firewall problems. Particularly with Netgear.    The Solutions to MSN Error Code 80048820  Internet Explorer - Try removing the tick next to Internet Explorer 'Proxy server' settings, instead, go with the 'Automatically detect settings'.     1) Launch Internet Explorer, click Tools and then click Internet Options.

See also Error code 81000314    3) If necessary, logon as a local administrator and set the computer's clock to the correct date and time.  (Check on the internet if possible.)    4) Turn off the firewall temporarily. Check firewall settings such as Norton: "Block access to secure sites".  If this cures the problem, make sure that Microsoft's MSN Messenger is allowed full access through your firewall.    NetGear problem, but also with some other routers   a) Enter IP address 192.168.0.1 in your browser's address bar.  b) Log on with ISP user name and password.  c) Enter Admin, password  d) Navigate to advanced menu, WAN set-up  e) Change MTU size to 1400    5) Try a password of no more than 8 characters.    6) If you are using IE 7.0 check the SSL Settings.

However, even if the site is down, you don't usually get error code 80048820.      8a) As a variation, of checking online, you could try phoning your local Microsoft Support office.  Local area numbers available from http://support.microsoft.com.    9) Have you just installed any anti-virus software?   Did the anti-virus software just make a big update?  Try disabling and see if that cures the error.    10) A drastic solution is to try uninstalling MSN Messenger version  and install a newer Microsoft MSN version     http://get.live.com/messenger/overview    ?.?**`?.? ?? ? ?l??.?**`?.?  ::: (\(\   *: (=' :') :*   ?..

zJnqvWqBaa	some ppl like thin technology. macbook air looks gud and for some ppl, this is all that matters. although personaly i think the normal macbook and macbook pro r thin enough. also some might think of it as owning the thinnest laptop on the market (these ppl r wrong*). for its price u cud get something with far better specs on almost any other laptop, but this is usually true for all apple products. however apple has a name. this is v important. y do ppl buy so many ipod nanos wen there r better mp3 players out there for cheaper? its cos of the apple logo on the back basically and it looks gud. compare ipod gen 3 to cowon d2 and ull c wat i mean:  -screen size: 2.0" on nano, 2.5" touchscreen on d2  -battery life: 24h music and 5h video on nano 52h music and 10h video on d2  -memory: 4-8gb on nano, 2gb, 4gb, 8gb, 16gb on d2 and expandable by microsd cards  -sound quality: d2 is much better  -price: $149-$199 for nano (4gb and 8gb respectively) $100-$140 for d2 and it came with a carying case (for 4gb and 8gb respectively)  so wat possible reason other than the apple logo and gud looks cud there be for buying an ipod nano gen3 instead of a d2?   and compare the d2 (which was out wen ipod nano gen2 was out) to ipod nano gen 4 and ull see that the d2 is still better.   prices: d2: $134 for 8gb d2, $149 for 8gb ipod nano 8gb, $170 for 16gb d2 and $199 for ipod nano 16gb  this is wats happening on a small scale but the same happens with the laptops.    *there r thinner laptops than the macbook air:  macbook air = 0.76"  mitsubishi pedion = 0.72" (1998, discontinued)  voodoo envy 133 = 0.70" (available and has some specs that macbook air shud hv, also consideringl the additional accesories u get with it its cheaper than macbook air, and has multitouch trackpad)  sharp muramasa = 0.54" (2003, discontinued)    its all in the name: apple vs something else. i find getting a macbook air a really stupid decision bcos in terms of specs its the worst macbook and its more expensive than a regular macbook with better specs. it cant do anything else that other laptops cant do or hvnt done before it. also is it really more portable? it doesnt hv an optical drive so u must carry that around with u as well if ur planing to use it. also it has worse battery life than other macbooks. so is it really much more portable?|`|FuGD0C5uaa	Its really not that great.

2KfQYXaiaa	Most older games (over a year or two old) do NOT support multi-core technology.  Therefor, it would only use one core (2.1GHz).  However, modern cores run better then older single cores.  It's worth giving it a try.|`|XlyLakYAaa	it's a common misconception that GHz = performance in computers.  This is NOT the case.  Your processor is many times more powerful than a Pentium 4 @ 2.4Ghz.    Also, you cannot just "multiply it out" like some other answers suggest.  It doesn't work like that.|`|41wnWIZyaa	it should work fine because a dual-core is the same as 2 single cores|`|2ccaffceef2cbb22892ad3a78f728effaa	the dual core 2.1 ghz will run faster for a game because the game will not run on only one of the cores. The game will utilize the dual core aspect of the prossesor and run different parts of the game on seprate cores like 1 core will run ragdoll physics and 1 core will run lighting and ect ect ect so in fact your dual core 2.1 ghz will run better than a single core 2.4 ghz.

EdVjJQRCaa	No you do not have to buy a graphic card how ever the performance will take a hit and will not look good, or play as well.|`|mQ7ZAFd6aa	YES! if you are uses a built in video card you can bet it's not powerful enough to play those type of game and if it does happen to run it will play very slow like unplayable slow even with the graphic at there lowerest.     If you decide to buy one check your computer for what type of video card it can handle. If your computer is still fairly new you should have either a PCI-E slot or a AGP slot. If you happen to have a shitty computer that doesn't have either then you will need to use a regular PCI slot.    Also Newer video cards from mid to high level range use extra power so you will have to make sure the video card you get can still use your power supply or buy a new power supply to support the card and your system.|`|XlyLakYAaa	You would actually need a graphics card.  First, the graphics card is responsible for the display of the computer.  ALL the display.  Even while in Windows or while using Office.  So without any graphics card at all, your computer would have absoluely no display and would therefore be unusable.  Second, Fallout 3 is a graphically intensive game and would require a good gaming video card to play well.|`|32dffe7e0eba9eb2c4e6c9418ec99ba5aa	Most games can be played even with built-in graphics, but the performance may be so poor that you'll give up in frustration after a while.    Any game that does a lot of 3D graphics generally requires a separate video card to produce acceptable performance.  The more you spend, the faster the game runs, but even a modest card is a great improvement over built-in video.  Prices start as low as $20-$30 and range up to $6000 or more.  At $50-$70 you're already getting worlds of improvement over anything you could have built in; beyond that, it just depends on how important the gaming experience is to you.|`|hUUWlLeBaa	they put minimum requirements on the side of the box for a reason. if your system does not meet them then the game will not run. if by some chance it does run it will not be stable. upgrading your GPU is not as easy as buying a card and sticking it the computer. you MUST run the system with a powerful enough PSU. you might get away with running underpowered for a while but eventually your system will start to become unstable...|`|wbiGMVqGaa	video card is definitely needed to run games like that.|`|Ko2q9mbEaa	For games such as Fallout 3, which is a demanding game, you will need a midrange graphics card at least such as the ATI HD Radeon 4830 (Best price/performance, the HIS one is great) or the Nvidia 9800GT (If you just hate ATI).    Make sure you have at least one PCI-Express X16 slot open and a power supply with a spare molex (4 pin) connector (you will then need the molex to 6 pin converter) or a PCI-E 6 pin adapter. If not, you may need a new power supply.      EDIT: To the previous poster, what if he has onboard? Then he wouldnt need another GPU for display.... And you dont need "High end".... Mid range will suffice.|`|AA12180741	well best way to find out if your machine can play these games is goto   http://www.systemrequirementslab.com/ref...  and choose the games from the drop down list and it will check your machines.|`|oCJ9UvjUaa	Well it depends upon your computers configuration. Some computers have an in built graphic card in the mother board which may have decent configurations to play games like fallout 3 but some might not satisfy for games like these. Usually on board graphic card has problems of pixel or vertex shaders, which is a must in today's games.  So you can buy a graphic card but first be sure of your onboard graphic card.  i would be better if you can give me the configurations of oyur pc and i may suggest you a suitable solution...  mail me at : redfireonsea@yahoo.com
mkprcdMgaa	My sister bought a new Gateway ML3109 in May of 2008 (I think) for $399 from Best Buy and I've used it quite a bit, including the fall semester at the University.  I think it's fast enough, especially if you get rid of unnecessary programs and tweak the settings.  I've never played any games on it, but it looks like there is plenty of RAM (depending on what your game requires) - the link for all the specs is below.  It has a nice wide and clear screen, built-in wi-fi, the battery lasts for a couple of hours if the screen brightness is turned down, and overall it's a nice laptop.

QO5uS8gEaa	This could be a driver problem, but it could also be a power overload.    USB devices draw power from the USB host. If you are using a powered USB hub (one with its own power plug) then it should not be drawing any more power from the PC, but if you are plugging directly into the PC or using an unpowered hub, each device you plug in draws a little more power.    It is important to note that electronic devices (including computers and computer peripherals) draw more power as they get older due to normal wear on the circuits. Likewise, power supplies are able to deliver less power as they get older, so situations like this can arise with machines that were previously functioning properly.    If your PCs power supply is just barely adequate to power all of the devices, plugging in another device can frequently cause an unexpected restart.    When your computer got Windows reinstalled, its possible that some piece of hardware was replaced with one that drew a little more power than the old one, or a device such as a hard drive may have been added. (Every device you add draws power).    One way to test your power consumption are to make sure there is no disc in your CD/DVD drive (they draw more power when there is a disc present) and see if that mitigates the problem. Another is to try using a powered USB hub (these are fairly inexpensive), such as this one from IOGear: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as... . If that resolves the problem, then you need a bigger power supply. You could also try disconnecting any extra devices (e.g. second and third drives or CD/DVD drive) to see if that helps.    If you suspect a driver problem, go to windows update and make sure the system is completely up-to-date. If the problem is still not resolved, go to the PC manufacturer's website or the website for the motherboard manufacturer and download the latest drivers.      Good Luck

d13ffb64b199e16801c20c68edf7e132aa	I have checked your printer model in official HP page and I didn't see that it has wireless adapter came with the package. So there is two thing you could to get it print wireless with with your laptop.      First option is  to buy this wireless upgrade kit  http://h10010.www1.hp.com/wwpc/us/en/sm/...    As you can see from the price, it is not cheap and it would cost extra 100 dollar minus shipping and tax. But if you only use laptop in your place and you don't have anything else,  this would be your only option if you wanted to print wireless. So buy it and follow the instruction, I am sure it would include one and would be an easy to install.      Second option is, if you have a desktop computer , just connected your printer to your desktop computer and install all the driver and stuff to make it work. And then after you have install the everything,  Go to control panel and choose printer setting, I don't know whether you used window Vista or Xp but it all the same. Then, after you open your printer setting you would see the list of printer installed in your computer. Right click on your HP printer and click properties. In properties , choose sharing tab and share your printer on the network.  Afterward, go to your laptop and install a new printer, choose printer from the local network and you will find your share HP printer , and window will usually handle the rest. If everything went smoothly, which usually it is, you should get one more printer on your printer option in your laptop printer list. And test a page too see if this work. You will have to open your computer which is connected with your printer everything you want to print wirelessly from your laptop.           To use the second option, your desktop or any computer that connected with the printer need to have network setup.   I hope this help

Vt0xnuWpaa	The best you can do is try to update the video drivers.    Unless you've ordered the laptop with the card you wanted, you can't swap it out. Unlike Desktop graphics cards, which are limited only by available slots, Laptop graphics cards are hard to find, and even harder to replace.    Laptop GPUs are not cards at all, but GPU chips soldered into the motherboard (which is why the ones with dedicated cards are said to have "discrete graphics" and others have the built-in "integrated graphics" rather than having "cards"), so as are some of the CPUs - meaning you have to melt the metal solder to even take them out. This is the way most laptops today are made. You'll have to be a real expert to be able to swap them successfully - even then success isn't 100%. Manufacturers will not take them back for an upgrade. Furthermore, your laptop motherboard chipset will not allow for you to upgrade to a discrete GPU if you ordered it with the integrated card.    Unless you have a laptop with a separate graphics unit or an MXM slot, you won't be able to upgrade/replace it. Check your manual to see if they allow any upgrades. Few laptops today allow you to do so (the Alienware line being one of the very last) I know for sure that recent Dell laptops use the soldering style.    -----------    The only option you have left is to use an Expresscard-adpated graphics unit, but not yet. Maybe in the near future; right now external graphics through Expresscard is in the process of development/release.    There aren't that many for sale yet in the U.S., but if you're lucky, you can find an ASUS XG Station for sale somewhere (but it won't be cheap considering its around $300 for the dock alone). You just need to have an Expresscard slot. They're only offering the 7900GS and 8600GT (desktop card) for the dock so far, but from the looks of the design you might fit other PCI-E x16 graphic cards into it in the future.    At this point, they will only work for an external monitor. Your laptop display will still be fuzzy.    http://www.hwupgrade.com/articles/print/...  http://img250.imageshack.us/img250/1671/...

Open "My Computer", open local hard drive C:  4.) Ctrl+A to copy all  5.) Open new hard drive (drive letters depend on what you set it at at time of install)  6.) Paste information (Ctrl+C)  7.) shutdown computer  8.) remove default drive from inside the computer  9.) change jumper settings on new hard drive to be default or primary drive  10.) start computer  This should fix it, if it does not, replace the old hard drive and change the settings on the new one back to slave drive. Optionally, you can also keep it set as a secondary drive to add the extra 500gb hard drive and have even more space!|`|AA10090963	Its easier to just do a fresh install of the OS if you can. Reason being that you could run into a complication due to the difference in drivers for the old and new hdd.     If you copy all your data from one onto the other, that part will work just fine, but then when you shut your computer off and change your jumpers and all that then turn it back on its POSSIBLE that your system won't think it has any hdd at all.     I guess it won't hurt to try but you might end up just having to reformat it and do a fresh install anyway. Personally my motto is that its better to do things right the first time if possible.

IMO elcipse is a lot better since it has a lot more features.|`|Fjy3f7czaa	http://java.com/en/download/manual.jsp|`|AA11480348	You need to download the free java compiler from Sun's website (JDK - Java Development Kit). This includes a JRE (Java Runtime Environment), so installing the JDK will not affect how your current Java applets runs on your machine).    Once you have the compiler, you can use Notepad (or Notepad 2) to write your Java programs and do the compilation at command prompt. If you want to do it the professional way, download an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) -- Eclipse and JCreator are great. I use Eclipse myself. Once you install that, the program will ask you for the directory of your Java compiler (or maybe auto-detect it).    Happy coding.|`|75nbESJUaa	I think NetBeans has better documentation, it was acquired by Sun and used in the tutorial examples.

Before the intel chips, you have to install only PPC version of linux and most of the smaller linux distro didn't have their version ported to MAC.        I don't know which computer field you would choose, I am computer science student myself. And the way I see it, you need to learn not only Window but also Linux too, and you can't left OSX in these day too.      So , mac is like buy one and get 2 free. With normal window based laptop you can only install Linux but installing OSX involved too much tweaking and frankly speaking.

If you have neither, you will need a PCI card.  I go by memory and reviews of video cards from places like cnet, pcworld, and other sites.  Generally an NVidia or Radeons will be ok with at least 512MB RAM (on the card). Depending on if your a gamer or not. If your a gamer the more RAM the better.  Spend at least $130 on NVidia/Radeon with 512DDR3 RAM or more and you'll be ok.

Click here to sign in again."    Cause: Account hijacking    Solution: Change your password at https://account.live.com      Do you get a message with an error code and a troubleshoot/help/ok button?    Most likely cause: Issues with the messenger service or your connectivity with the internet.    Solution: Google the error code for more info.      No message boxes appear, messenger Icon changes to a signed out one.    Cause: Dropped connection.    Solution: Check you are still connected to the internet, sometimes ADSL/DSL connections drop out for "no reason" this could be a loose cable, hardware glitch poor line qaulity etc.
qmWEGycFaa	All legal XP discs are one license per cd. What you are looking for does not legally exist.|`|7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	The largest license you can get is an enterprse-wide license - like if you have offices in different cities.  You CAN NOT get a license for Windows for "any computer".  Not even computer manufacturers can - they pay on a "per computer" basis.    If you really have that many computers you need to install Windows on, contact Microsoft.  (Licenses usually start at about 5 computers, and go up to "any computer on the premises", but if you have special needs talk to them.)|`|nmsbACHxaa	no need to buy    download bittorrent if you already dont have it    google it if u dont know were to get it    now go to thepiratebay.org and search ultra iso...this program can burn files to a disc so u can install windows with it    that website also has varieties of windows programs|`|32dffe7e0eba9eb2c4e6c9418ec99ba5aa	Many computer stores sell OEM versions of Windows XP, but you must be buying components to build a PC (motherboards, disk drives, etc.) if you want the OEM version.  The OEM version still requires activation, but it is often available in multiple languages.  OEM versions are cheaper but they come with no technical support or documentation at all, since they are intended for computer builders who will be providing their own support.    Microsoft doesn't sell directly to customers except for large corporate accounts (like computer vendors or large enterprises).|`|WPHVrLheaa	buy one from your college. It's typically around $15.

Generally most laptops today will suite your needs but you shold shop around because you can get an davanced computer for a cheap price. However  as you need advice I would recommend going for something with enough RAM for your needs(if you do photo/audio editing go for ot less than 2Gb) also if you do gaming go for as high a graphics card as you can and try to look for VIsta Home premium if you can. It has some good additional programs|`|heytv3Awaa	One of the best laptop is a century.|`|wikMFWRQaa	well there are a couple things you should keep in mind  First of all you should try to get a Core 2 Duo processor since they are the best for laptops but they do cost a bit more than turion. This is not mandatory but it will help  Personally I like anything other than dell in that price range due to bad experiences.   2 gigs of memory should be a minimum for a vista pc.   Battery life is usually around 3 hours standard but you can usually buy an extended battery if need be.   Make sure the weight is right for you  Check speaker quality  Make sure it has all the ports you need like USB etc.  Check to see if it has wireless built in.  Test the keyboard and check general quality of materials

It will reinstall Windows while preserving your applications and data. However, a repair installation does not fix all of the problems a reinstall fixes, so it's up to you to decide which way to go.      If you decide to do a complete reinstall, be prepared to spend a little time. Follow the link below for an excellent step-by-step guide - it covers all versions of Windows.

The installer will load and prompt you to install.  On the first menu choose "New Installation".  On the next menu page you will see the options to reformat the drive.  You will be asked if you want to reformat the drive or Repair the drive.  You want to repair the drive.  At this point Windows will perform something called a "Non-destructive Reinstall" a very unique feature of Windows XP.  It will run the installation but only by scanning and reinstalling those files it discoverers to be corrupt.    Depending on the state of the OS and the drive this could take 5 mins or 40 mins.  Set it up and let it do its thing.  After it is done it will restart and bring you to your login screen giving you that fresh install feeling.  :)

Or just press F5    There you can change the settings of the brush shape, texture, scattering, etc. But in order to change the settings you have to have selected the brush/smudge/doge tool.

From the improvements I've seen for iLife 09, it doesn't appear like there is any huge re-write that would cause you grief.    iLife '10 could be if its coded to take advantage of things Snow Leopard will offer.

SJM0rzHtaa	That's because old tube TVs are only capable of displaying very low resolutions.  They cannot do anything higher than 640x480.    So if you want to get an image on your TV, you have to drop your resolution down real low, and the image will look blurry and fuzzy.  Personally, I think it's not worth bothering with.    In the future, you might try hooking up a computer to an LCD HDTV that has HDMI or VGA ports.  The 1080p HDTVs can do 1920x1080.    EDITED TO ADD:    On old tube TVs, there is usually a dial or buttons for adjusting the vertical position of the image.

Lower the Res to around 1280-800 or so if it's a widescreen HD TV but you probably want 640-480 for a regular TV, thats about all your gonna get with a composite (one yellow for video) connection.

Laptops and PC towers kept on the floor are especially vulnerable.    The following methods may void your warranty, so use @ your own risk.  Also, make certain that you ground yourself with the metal of the unit, & work slowly to avoid touching any electrical components inside!    Laptops components are packed into a pretty small volume, so maximum air flow is extremely important.  If you're up to the task & have the proper small screwdrivers, some units have fan access covers (look on the back or under a cover) and reach the dinky fan.      Take Q-tips, dipped in alcohol to dissolve & rub off accumulated dust and crud from the fan blades.  Use 2 @ a time: one to brace the fan blade & the other to do the cleaning.  Working your way around the entire fan this way until the blades are clean.  After replacing any covers, blow out the fan duct opening to expel any loose rubbish before restarting the unit.  Make sure you've got plenty of airflow around the vents (bottom & sides) and you don't lay the unit on a cloth surface: use a piece of cardboard, book, or anything rigid.    Another possible cause is too many background services/programs running.  The more applications running = more CPU heat.  Try a 'Safe Mode' start up and let it run for a while to see if the random shutdowns continue... if not, then it may be an overworked CPU.  Cut these app's back if you can find out what is not necessary.|`|jU8CX1veaa	It may be overheating and shutting down to protect the CPU, ensure the vents aren't blocked, operate on a hard surface not carpet or bed to ensure good ventilation,  reduce the power settings to medium and get an airblaster can to clean the fans.    When it shuts down is it giving any error messages. It could be a virus so do a full antivirus and spyware scan|`|AA10711210	How old is it?

It worked when I 1st put it on and then would just freeze and turn itself off after bout 20mins. Then the time it stayed on got shorter and shorter.

AA10021018	Hi,    You have four options - build one yourself, hire someone to build one, use a forum on another site, or install a premade forum on your site. Most people go for option 4, understandably. It will still require some technical knowhow, but the installation process is generally documented pretty well with the software.    Believe it or not there are actually plenty of premade forum packages available for free. Of these, phpBB (an open source forum package) is well known and perhaps the most popular. I suggest you start with this.    Visit http://www.phpbb.com for more informaton and downloads.    If you wanted to learn the skills yourself it is most definately NOT easy, especially if you have no prior knowledge of PHP or MySQL.

d98d8bfb68b616f97b22344613a67cebaa	Very easy to do... Following code is vb2008. For simplicity FORM1 has a single textbox and a button and Form2 just has a label.      To make this work you make a public subroutine (or function) which accepts the data you want to display.  This Subroutine will do two things. First it will assigne the data to the label text property for display, Second it will call the forms show or show dialog methods.    On form1 the button click event contains code that first creates a FORM2 variable. THe  DIM f as New Form2 statement creates a new form2 in memory but it isn't displayed yet. THis allows you to call the public Sub you created and pass the data you wish to display.      Public Class Form1        Private Sub Button1_Click(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click          Dim f As New Form2          f.ShowMyData(Me.TextBox1.Text)        End Sub  End Class      Public Class Form2          Public Sub ShowMyData(ByVal MyData As String)            Me.Label1.Text = MyData          Me.Show()          End Sub  End Class      For your particular application, process the display string in FORM1 before you send it to FORM2.    DIm str as string    str = textbox1.text & " "& textbox2.text  & " Welcome"    once the srting is assembled and assigned to variable str then its easy to pass str to form1 for display in a single label box.    '===================================  EDIT    Another method that grabs data from form 1 when form 2 is loaded        Private Sub Form2_Load(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles MyBase.Load          Me.Label1.Text = Form1.TextBox1.Text      End Sub    Of course with this method you have to grab all relavant data from an existing FORM1 (hopfully its validated)  and from FORM1 you create a new form2 and then call the show method .   When teh form is created the load method fires and grabs data from form 1  =====================================  EDIT2:  You wrote:  >>>  Label1.Text = "Hello" &Home.PlayerOne.Text "And" &Home.PlayerTwo.Text "Hope you enjoy your stay"      You have syntax error in this statement.  You are missing ampersands (&'s) and proper spacing between sections of the string you are constructing. It should look like the following:    Label1.Text = "Hello " & Home.PlayerOne.Text &  " And " & Home.PlayerTwo.Text & " Hope you enjoy your stay"    Also notice that I added leading and lagging spaces to the quoted portions of the string to provide proper spacing between words in the sentence parts and the parts added by the textbox.text property.|`|7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	The full name of the label is Form2.Label1 (or whatever the form and label names are).  Form2.Label1.Text is available from any place in the entire program.|`|xBtf4h1baa	i am not familiar w/ vb 2008 unfortunately. i know a more neanderthalic visual basic lol. but you can  Try This:    lblForm2.caption="Hello"&txtName1.text... you enjoy your stay"    this is assuming that you have named your textboxes txtName1 and txtName2. it is also assuming that your form2's label is named lblForm2.    i however wouldn't approach it w/ several forms.  i would rather use an input box or message box. but i don't know what the program looks like exactly or what functionality it is for. so go ahead and use what i have stated and see if this works. hope this helps/works ;)|`|tRMgbldcaa	I haven't worked with VB '08 at all but I believe there is a simpler way to access other forms than there was in the past.    Try something like this:  (I think this is it)  Label1.Text = "Hello " & Form1.FirstName.Text & " and " &       Form1.SecondName.Text & ".  Hope you enjoy your stay."|`|2cq46sDeaa	You didn't detail the logic for displaying  the forms, but this works from the on click handler for a button on form 1    Private Sub Command1_Click()  Dim message As String    message = "hello " & Text1.Text & " and " & Text2.Text & " Enjoy your stay"    Form2.Label1.Caption = message  Form2.Show (modal)  End Sub    Contact me if you like

Turn System Restore OFF so any infection that you remove is not restored.    2.) Scan with a combination of the best detection utilities as youll find different scanners can sometimes pick up different infections.  E.g.       * McAfee Stinger  a free stand-alone utility used to detect and remove specific viruses.     * SpyBot Search & Destroy  a spyware/adware scanner     * Lavasoft Adaware  for spyware/adware    Note  it might be a good idea to disconnect your network connection once youve updated them with the latest virus/spyware definitions.  This is due to the fact that often an infection is trying to spread over your network.    3.) If the above fails or youre not sure if youre still infected, when you start your PC tap the F8 key, select Safe Mode and repeat the scans once youre connected.    I hope the above helps, as mentioned the guide above is a lot more detailed and the My Slow PC site is pretty useful.  Good luck!

If you restore, then certain files are restored to the condition they were at the time the restore point was created. However, your personal files are not affected by the restoration. The amount of restore points varies with the amount of free space you have on your hard drive. I think if nothing else is available, there is always one restore point that is the first one ever made.

This is due to the fact that often an infection is trying to spread over your network.    3.) If the above fails or youre not sure if youre still infected, when you start your PC tap the F8 key, select Safe Mode and repeat the scans once youre connected.    I hope the above helps, as mentioned the guide above is a lot more detailed and the My Slow PC site is pretty useful.  Good luck!

See what services in your device manager are enabled. I'm guessing there is one thing there that is causing everything to seize when it's run and needs to be turn off. Try turning on each service one-by-one to see which one triggers the freeze. Unfortunately this can take a very long time if you have many dozens in the list. If you can think of anything that you installed recently (a game, scanner, web cam, any software or device) try to uninstall it to see if that works.    If all else fails you might have to back up your data and re-install Windows

4yhGXh8kaa	Yes it will run it, however the video on it definatly leaves something to be desired. to get good speed you'll likely need to turn down the video settings.    As I said its the video on that one thats not as good, its not really a heavy gaming notebook.     If thats what your into I'd aim for a better video device. This one benchmarks well over the min requirements but less then half what the recomended devices do. The video on that Viao is a little outdated for the otherwise nice Core 2 duo and 4g ram if it's suposed to by for FPS.    To put it into perspective, when your choosing the attributes of your laptop at the viao site graphics is not an option, they're not gearing their laptops toward gamers but at that price range your not likely to get anything near as good with Dell or HP or Alienware. You could go well over the price without getting anything as good for gaming.    In conclusion you'll probably have to turn your settings down pretty far to ensure that the frame rates don't ever drop below 10 fps in the middle of some hot pwnage and cost you your life at a bad moment. For most of the single play you should be able to turn them back up and enjoy the stunning visuals.

For your Dell you can go to dell.com http://support.dell.com/support/topics/g...  and put in the 'service tag' (this is really the serial number, which is usually on a white tag on the back or bottom) and it will tell you exactly what the system came with and what kind of memory to get.    You can also go to newegg and put DIMM into the search box and it'll come up with all the DIMMs they have. You can then narrow it down by manufacturer and cost -as well as by if ti's discounted or has free shipping and more.     You may also want to buy enough RAM to replace as well as upgrade whatever you have in your system. It works much more reliably when all modules have the same specs and the prices are pretty good now.    Good luck.|`|aLc4uzXVaa	Go on www.crucial.com instead.  Let it scan your computer.

If you want wireless internet around the home, talk to your ISP about getting a wireless router. For that, you will need a phone line. Accessories for this direction would be a laptop with a wireless card (either inbuilt or USB/Pc Card [PCMCIA]), and filters on your landlines (provided by your ISP, and required for DSL internet).    If you want wireless outside the home, talk to your mobile phone provider about getting wireless broadband. They will offer you 3G mobile broadband, this allows you to access the internet wherever you are, within the range of the network. For this, your ISP will give you either a PC card or USB dongle.

2LbTrlQnaa	A formal complaint has been submitted to the Sunnyvale CA headquarters of Yahoo Inc. relating to the lack of moral responsibility displayed by Yahoo! Answers in indirectly encouraging the nations schoolchildren to access blocked websites whilst in school.  School computers are provided by taxpayers exclusively for school work.  Websites such as MySpace, Facebook, YouTube and similar sites are exclusively leisure activities which have no place within the school environment.  For a respected site such as Yahoo! Answers to provide the means for schoolchildren to exchange information about proxy websites (for the purpose of accessing blocked websites on school computers) is considered to be unacceptable and unpatriotic.  It is considered that Yahoo Inc. has a moral duty to require Yahoo! Answers to ban questions pertaining in any way to accessing blocked websites in the school environment.  As a sizeable minority of rebellious youngsters seem unwilling and/or incapable of obeying rules and respecting the authority of their school districts; Yahoo Inc. must itself take positive action to protect our schoolchildren from the error of their ways.|`|pEyDW7aWaa	Hey, Iv recently had the same problem as you when trying to get onto websites that have been blocked by my school.

Vt0xnuWpaa	Laptops tend to run hot, so it's rather normal.    Your computer should register around 55 Degrees Celsius during idle/normal use and 75 Degrees Celsius during intensive use (like gaming). If it's way over this value (around 85-100) you will need to get your laptop checked. If your computer shuts down because it gets too hot, then that might be a sign. It automatically does this to prevent any heat damage.      Here are my practical suggestions about any temperature problems:   1. Check that you are not blocking any of the fans/vents while you are using the laptop. This is a very simple but common mistake. I even put some thick cup coasters under my laptop (while on my desk) to make sure it has some extra ventilation.   2. Dust out the fans/vents once in a while with one of those cans of AirDuster. The buildup of material blocks any cool air from getting into the laptop.   3. Check whether the fan is running!   4. Do not use the CPU as intensively - run less programs at one time.   5. Buy a laptop cooling pad if you want to be sure to keep yourself and your laptop cool. Or be thrifty and run a fan nearby with a few books to prop the bottom of the laptop up.    -----    Do not use ice/water/any fluids to cool down your laptop unless you have a professional liquid-cooling system (which tend to be expensive and are a bit more elaborate than needed for everyday purposes). You might get water into the circuitry and fry it.    -----    If it's a little warm, you need not worry.

ZXAf1pOgaa	hi there,    stretch :-  say your desktop is 1024 x 768 pixels. basically that is the dimension of your screen. and the image you have is 640 x 480 pixels - if you use strech this will...yes you guessed it...stretch the image to 1024 x 768. so if its a face it may look a bit strange and malformed.    tile :-  tile will take the image and basically repeat the image over and over filling the desktop.    center :-  center will take your image and absolutely center it on screen, so if its smaller than your screen resolution, it will put white space, other wise it will just center the visible content.    the reason you may not be seeing a difference is because your image may be roughly the same size as your screen res. in which case i would usually go for center.    hope this helps :)

Then plug everything back in and see if the error message comes up again, if it persists you may have spyware or a virus on your computer which is causing it to crash. Norton makes great Anti-Spyware software that can be purchased at any electronic store or even Wal-Mart.|`|QTiTDz4yaa	This problem can occur for a variety of reasons.  It can be a hardware problem (like a video card, hard drive issue, processor) any number of things.    Or it could be software corruption from a minor hardware issue.    In either case, it is not easy to tell you how to fix it.    Among the listed ideas I see someone telling you to use the system disk that came with the computer.  Not a good idea unless you don't mind losing everything on the system.    Unfortunately, if restarting the system yields the same problem, you are at the mercy of technical support.    Saying "don't tell me to call tech support" is like someone coming on here and saying their car wont start but don't tell them to speak to a mechanic.    Except in this case..we are talking about a computer and operating system that is much more complicated than a car.

4yhGXh8kaa	It doesn't sound like you have a problem with your sound so much.    If ur using XP open up the volume control and make sure none of the different types of sound inputs are turned off or down.    Also, this could be caused by an issue with flash player, in which case stuff like youtube, myspace music, Deezer, and other sites that use Flash Player could cause this.    you could reinstall FlashPlayer.    If none of this helps you should repost with the following info.    1 what OS are you using (Win XP, Vista, Mac, Lepard ect)  2 What browser you're using (Internet Explorer, Firefox, Netscape, Safari)  3 what kind of games your referring to.  4 what sites your not getting sound from  5 can you get sound from playing an audio file on your computer such as an MP3. Test WMplayer if your using windows, also try another player such as winamp.

CCleaner is a freeware system optimization and privacy tool. It removes unused files from your system - allowing Windows to run faster and freeing up valuable hard disk space. It also cleans traces of your online activities such as your Internet history. CCleaner also fixes your registry. But the best part is that it's fast (normally taking less than a second to run) and contains NO Spyware or Adware.

However, for about 500 euros you can find plenty of laptops from companies like HP (avoid Dell like you'd avoid the Plague) that are good.    Sony's are great- if you are really willing to spend the extra cash to get one. They're not worth it comparatively speaking though.

XP uses Movie Maker 2  Vista uses Movie Maker 6/  My jpg(still photo's)used in slide shows usually require like--99-photo's..minimum..be sure and use a good size FRAME in Digital Still Photogrpahy--like 1600 x 1200--this will make a great FILE for viewing on the PC or Burning to a Blank DVD..I'm useing..2272 x 1704..you may want to use a TRIPOD for photography at this level..  ..  Read the TASK Menu and learn to LOAD your Files--either the Video or the Picture..or the MUSIC Files..  ..  When making a Slide Show..you need a Picture Duration..  I use a easy formula for my music video's..where the Slide Show operates..  /7-seconds/9-seconds/11-seconds..I use these 3-choices and just listen to my music choices to make a selection..  ..  Music Files that are allowed in Movie Maker are::[.wav]-[mp3]-[wma]-  I really don't use the [.wav]FILE..but my Music Collection contains these FILES..I then convert to MP3 or WMA to use in my MOVIES..for MP-3 I like to use 320(KBPS)..for WMA I like the NEW Lossless..File..which is just under the [.wav]FILE size..you will need a Audio Converter Program..I use CREATIVE Products..  ..  Making a Video Movie from a camcorder FILE(DV)..  This requires a Firewire(ieee1394)..and a Digital Sound Card..  The process is a matter of EDITING out the Video "mistakes"..and really is a matter of practice..//..its a more advanced part of Movie Maker..complete familiarity with Movie Maker 2 or Movie Maker 6 is really necessary..but the best editing is done in DV-avi..and this type of a file makes the BEST DVD Movie..  ..  There are TITLES..andf TEXT...and FONTS...and COLORS..Panels..animation..  There are 100's of these to choose from::  So I really stay with my Favorite FONT..which is Georgia..  and my Favorite Animation which is BASIC TITLE..  ..you'll need to experiment..and become familiar..  ..  Transitions and EFFECTS..this a difficult matter because in the Digital Video Editng Process there are "tiny" glitches that only practice reveal..without knowledge of technique your movie is going to be a BIT-skitter-ish at some tricky POINT..keeping basics and simplicity may serve you..BUT sooner or LATER..a tricky little TIME-glitch seems to smear the facts a BIT..smoothing out these GLITCHES--really is alot of practice and keen on detail...experiance../  ..  Basics..//  Picture Duration--7-seconds/..9-seconds/..  11-seconds/..(choose one)  Transition Duration--actually [1.25] seconds is a long time..so start there..for a quality movie..smooth..  BEST FILE...DV-avi for eding digital video files and making DVD Movies..  Digital Slide Shows..use JPG Files and MP3 files for simplicity..  IF YOU REMEMBER THAT..starting with LARGE FILES..and creating movies is the best practice..  You will soon realize that a RENDERING Process such as MPEG-2 is perfectly suited for your Collection..  Basically--DV-avi Files of 10-GBs in SIZE...render onto a DVD at 3.8 GBs..this is a good safety margin to stay with..you can get into riskier files later..  ..  That's really it..there are some steps in Movie Maker to speed up your Movie Making..check out..CLIP for ADD-to-STORYBOARD..always remember to SET your Picture Duration and Transition Time first of all..before loading the Storyboard..  ..  The Storyboard is made up of PANES..each of those SQUARE--FILES is a PANE..and has a TIMELINE associated with it..all for the editing of your movie..  ..  A nice trick--  Is to create a Color Panel that starts off your MOVIE..so people can be seated without the Movie Just jumping onto the Screen..  What I mean..is the same way you create a Beginning TITLE(color panel w/text)..just choose the same color and FADE the TEXT(transparency)Fully..you now have a color plank that you can DROP the EFFECT--SLOW DOWN..on..giving your movie a nice START(daa--daaa)..!!

But if you have both, you can try the formula below.    {=COUNT(IF((A1:A100) *(A1:A10""),A1:A10)) }    A1:A10 = Data range    Note:- This is an array formula, so you have to press CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER together when confirming the formula.

dc60ff3b5aa807768088e0759e3df6b5aa	Hello,    (ANS) First off, thats X2 questions but no matter really.     No.1 Meta data and meta programming, meta data is information or data thats used by overall systems to run them, its information thats used to keep track of a systems overall settings for example.     Meta data is data that's used to keep track of other data, in that sense it can be quite confusing to understand too. Therefore meta programming is programming that is designed to collect and manage the meta data in the first place.    No.2 Sunlight, is a stream of photons that originate from the nuclear process's that constantly take place within the heart of the sun. Our nearest star, without sunlight life isnt possible, it couldnt never have come into exsistence, & without it every single thing that has life force is dead. Without sunlight NOTHING!! is possible.    **The good news is that our sun has another 200 billion years left to go before it becomes a red super giant star and dies.    **The bad news is sunlight has no relationship to meta data in this question!!

J'ai essaye la demo sur ma machine qui ressemble a la tienne et ca marche pas trop mal avec un bon niveau de graphisme.  Avec DirectX10 avec Vista et l'update de MS pour FS (je sais pas si elle est sortie) tu devrais profiter de + de details si ta carte video est compatible DirectX10.   Maintenant, si t'installe des add-ons par tonnes avec des avions aussi vrai que nature et des sceneries en pagaille, et tu veux mettre les detail a donf sans que ca "saute", la par contre faut te tourner vers les meilleurs proc bi-core et au mini 2 cartes video en SLI chez nVidia ou equivalent chez ATi.

26GHiOOeaa	They are not necessary, but depending on the laptop they can keep your Laptop cooler.  This in turn will give your processor, and everything else inside of your machine, added life.  Laptops do not have nearly the "airiness" of a tabletop.  They generally only have one fan and can get quite warm if used for long periods of time.  Bear in mind that the new Core 2 Duo processors run cooler than their Core Duo and Dual Core predecessors.  If you purchased a Core 2 machine, you really don't need one.  If it was an older used machine, or a more cost effective new one, and has a single core processor, it is a good idea to get one.  Check your processor and let that determine whether to spend the extra money.|`|2157b0a10766c2eea0a40ad966604b07aa	It couldn't hurt but is not necessary.

Pero como te deca, XP toma todo lo bueno del Win2K y adems supone mejoras grficas, drivers, internacionalizacin, seguridad para los procesos de programas, seguridad de red con su firewall que se instala con el SP2.

13cb047ad0e39e961142afc8fc7fea79aa	IT's not about the Brand, but rather, it's what's inside.  Most Laptops share about the same processor maker, although, they may have different processor speed, RAM and Hard-disk space.    Depending on how you use your laptop, I suggest that you get these specs:    Intel Core Duo 1.75 Ghz, 1 GB RAM and 160 GB Hard-drive.    For durability though, trust Toshiba or Fujitsu.    About your Old Laptop, you can make it run the way it used to. Just delete all your junk files like Temp Files, or just about any useless files you think that's in your My Documents. Never delete files from C:\ Windows or Program Files.    Finally, do some spyware check. Spyware does affect your processing speed. Or if want to dare, do a full reinstall.    If you really want to buy a new Laptop, try a Toshiba, it's cheaper than Sony.|`|eJmSQ0utaa	Well id suggest u check out some toshiba laptops . U can also check out some dells and hp laptops too. those are pretty good. and if u want good customer care etc then go for an apple macbook. they really are in these days. ppl are going for them. so try these websites...and see what suits u and what u like...    http://www.toshiba.com  http://www.dell.com  http://www.hp.com  http://www.apple.com    hope i helped find u a suitable notebook that suits u.  good luck|`|e7073deda810b7dbd0f5a9afb258f6ecaa	I would highly recommend a Toshiba laptop.|`|Ls8JDSPWaa	You must spend your money for the best brand.

On www.hp.com you can even customize your laptop.|`|M38VNWXKaa	I would reccomend Sony as in VAIO..  its really good..  even though price may be costly, it is worth buying...

CUando ahora te compras un pc nuevo te trae instalado el Vista por defecto, pero ahora bien, no te trae el CD/DVD si no que te piden que lo egneres t (te suele venir con un cd/dvd virgen para hacerlo)  Pero lo gracioso es que si desinstalas el W.Vista y luego se te jode el pc NO TE VALE LA GARANTA a no ser que instales el Vista.    Da igual que el pc se haya estropeado por lo que sea.    Por eso digo que hay que tener cuidado, generar el cd de w.

RHVCK43paa	Rhino.   Yo creo que no es problema del lector sino propiamente del disco compacto, cuando los discos son viejos generalmente tienen rayones  manchas que dificultan su lectura.  Definitivamente trata primero con algn amigo que tenga una computadora nueva  que tengan una unidad de CD de las ms actuales pues con las velocidades de estas unidades de nueva generacin puede leerlo bien y grabarlo.  De lo contrario existen unos aparatitos como el skin doctor que "lijan" la superficie y quedan como nuevos, y la ms a?orada. Ponle pasta de dientes (tiene abrasivos microscpicos) y talla con las yemas de tus dedos en forma de crculos peque?os, no creas que con una vuelta ya queda, debes hacerlo muchas muchas muchas veces hasta que te duela el dedo y el brazo, lo lavas solo con agua y listo, ponlo a quemar de inmediato y salva en uno nuevo.

7663ea46c6ffa025bc1538b8258cad1caa	ive always had motherboard temp lower than my cpu temp but i do overclock my cpu which makes its hotter.  My mobo runs at around 34 to 36c and my cpu at around 39 to 42c when im just doing simple stuff on my pc. when im running skype and one of my games (wow or C&C 3) my mobo go's up to around 37 to 40c and my cpu bumps up to 48 to 52c.  for the speed of your fan i would have though it would be cooler as my fans are only running at 1895ish RPM. thats 2 case fans and the cpu fan. Just so you can see way my cpu heats up so much i overclock that from 3.0ghz to 3.66ghz which when i playing games does make hell of a difference.   I would suggest if you dont do it already making sure you clean inside your system fairly often, mine gets so dusty so quickly and that makes you temp rise alot.  old pc i had once i forgot to clean for months and was running at around 68c, i clean the CPU heatsink and fan from god knows how much dust and replaced the CPU thermal compound with new stuff and it dropped down to around 40c.    Lot of writing there but if you are worried about how hot things are then thats just a few things you can do to see if it cools down.  Dont forget case fans need cleaning too and keep your mobo clear of dust!|`|QFlEzgF4aa	is normal,!!! u can alsoget a water coolin system.and no more worries.|`|sJURfVrVaa	You've got some major cooling power on this machine, but an obviously hot processor.    46C isn't incredibly warm but at idle it could be cooler.  It's usually the CPU that runs warmer than the system -- it actually throws the most heat into the system (unless you've got a really hot graphics card going too).  It is a little strange that both system and cpu temps are identical.   A probe could be at fault.    You might look into getting a big cooler fan for the CPU -- you can often quiet things down and make the whole system run cooler as well.  Zalman makes some excellent coolers.|`|606bd6e268a7597fa099346bd8012a99aa	The CPU could reach temps much higher than the system.  If the CPU is at the system temp that is pretty good, but you could get it lower.  More fans and a hard drive cooler could help bring down the overall system temp.  And if your system temp is lower, then the CPU temp will be lower.|`|f8fa1394b28bb15cf41861d58df09bc3aa	with 3 fans for ventilation , there is no way you would have 46C for the system/motherboard temp . You may have a faulty probe. Take the side panel out and use a big fan to blow air directly to motherboard and see how the temperature reads again .

If it is rebooting itself, you may have an electrical issue with the power switch or the reboot button.  This depends on if you have one button on your pc or 2.  If you have only one, it is a dual function switch.  Depressing it momentarily will reboot the machine.  Holding it in will do an emergency shutdown (not adviseable if it can be helped).   Make sure your switch isnt getting stuck halfway in or have a loose connection inside the pc.  Check the wires for chaffing and spliting all the way to the main board, ensure they are not making contact with anything metal if there is a broken outer sheething.  Make certain the connection on the mb is good.  Good luck.

Este programa tiene varios niveles de seguridad y te permite bloquear carpetas con contrase?a y no slo eso. Las carpetas permanecen invisibles hasta que pones tu password, as que no hay forma ni de verlas, ya sea por windows o por command prompt.    2.-Si no consigues encontrar filelock, puedes manejar varios perfiles en tu computadora y no ponerles permiso de lectura y escritura a los dems usuarios. Para eso, cada usuario tiene que tener su propio perfil.

AA11815137	Anyone can find out what their computer's IP address is.  See below for a link to check.    Just about everyone who wants to know, will know your IP address.      Generally, if someone traced your IP address they would know roughly the state you're in and the city, but not your street address.  However, your ISP would know exactly who you are as they also know your IP address along with your account information with them.    As long as you're not doing things of an illegal nature, don't worry about it.    |`|bmCInR5qaa	If they had to go online to get your IP address, most likely nothing.

Unless it's an article nobody cares about/understands to see if information in it is true or false, then it will be changed back. There are bots constantly reverting vandalism, along with scores of users quickly reverting vandalism and other negative changes to wikipedia aided by various programs that make detection of these changes easier. Almost all of the facts on wikipedia cite a source on the internet or in print. So if you don't trust the accuracy of those facts, then there's really no point in trusting the accuracy of anything else on the internet. But to answer your question, there aren't a whole lot of sites like wikipedia, if any. None have comprehensive information on everything. Some, like WebMD, cover certain niches of information quite well. WikiHow has pretty good do-it-yourself instructions.

77PMVjAAaa	do you realise that CSI is fictional?? most of the things they show the computers and programs do are not even real. <br>  <br>  Anyway in forensics, computational speed doesn't matter that much. <br>  <br>  It's the quality of the applications and methodologies used that makes the real difference. <br>  <br>  in CSI, they get a result from a computer in 5 seconds, and the next minute they go arrest someone. In real life, you need to check, and recheck your data, verify everything, apply procedures etc. That takes hours of work, and very often even take days. <br>  <br>  So whether your computer is fast enough to give you a result in 5 seconds, or 10-15 mins, doesn't make that much of  a difference.

dc60ff3b5aa807768088e0759e3df6b5aa	Hello,<br>  <br>  (ANS) No.1 see: <a href="http://www.windowvistarepair.com/articles/Unmountable_boot_volume_XP.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.windowvistarepair.com/article...</a><br>  <br>  No.2 My guess is that the disk drives MFT (master file table) has become damaged or corrupted by something once again and this error means that XP cannot read or write to the disk correctly. Because the indexes are all messed up & so the OS (XP) cannot see the drive correctly. Hence unable to mount the drive !!.<br>  <br>  No.3 My sincere advise as an experienced computer person is NO!! <br>  I wouldn't advise you to use this disk again even as a slave or secondary drive. Especially because the same error has occurred more than once. The error could easily occur again with more devastating results in future, it sounds like this disk drive has a physical problem with the actual magnetic media itself. This means the disk itself might be about to fail catastrophically and if you are planning to store valuable or sensitive personal data on this drive its not a good idea really.<br>  <br>  No.4 My advise would be don't skimp!!! Given the low cost of brand new hard disk drives go buy yourself a new HDD or risk data loss which cannot be un-done i.e. what price do you put on your personal data?? A new HDD could cost you as little as ￡40-￡45 ish.<br>  <br>  No.5 Keep but dont use the HDD with the error or physically destroy the disk is my opinion.<br>  <br>  Kind Regards Ivan<br>  <br>  computer veteran.|`|eghsNMd7aa	Well, you can't throw it in the trash regardless lol. But it shouldn't be a problem if its a slave drive. Just make sure you set it right! :)

xEoCu5iXaa	There should be a boot menu of some kind. Hold down the "option" key when you boot. Choose your boot partition there.<br>  <br>  EDIT: The option key is the key with the little apple on it, just letting you know. I wouldn't know because i don't have a mac :D
2KuToOthaa	Yes, all Macbooks that are currently sold by Apple can connect to a wireless network out of the box.  This goes for most current PC laptops being sold today.<br>  <br>  Depending on your home network's security settings, you may have to configure the Macbook before it can make a connection, such as SSID and encryption type, and/or password.|`|Yu7vBUkOaa	Of course it can.
XmxN58XCaa	because theres no such thing as playstation live.|`|86e0fcff22774bed26d5e5f6773ca754aa	Your router may have a built in Firewall (many modern ones do) .. you will need to check what Ports have to be 'open' and then adjust the settings ..<br>  <br>  DO NOT just 'turn off' the Firewall (it's there to stop your PC being hijacked and turned into a 'spam zombie' whilst at the same time sending all your account names & passwords to the mafia :-)|`|1IVT7ClCaa	Make sure when you set up the connection you put in the security details and set everything to automatic so the PS3 can get the right settings. The only other possible problem is that the signal from the router isn't strong enough. But with a cable that shouldn't, so it must be the settings on the PS3, make sure you set up the router properly as well.

AA10929108	with readyboost you are adding a RAM alternative not actual RAM<br>  <br>  i think unless you have insufficient RAM you won't see much of an improvement with the readyboost<br>  <br>  and between using at 4GB and a 32GB flash drive for readyboost you won't see much of a difference|`|7BHIyMFmaa	It will help by not by much. Basically you're using flash memory as sort of a go between between the actual RAM and the HDD. It won't be nearly as effective as actually installing more RAM. If you think you are magically gaining 29 more gigs of RAM you will be underwhelmed. It simply doesn't work that way. In a best case scenario you can expect a 8%-10% loading time decrease in some apps. Some apps aren't effected at all.|`|b8tgCAQJaa	If the notebook has 1GB of RAM or less, you'd get much better performance by upgrading the RAM inside the notebook (to at least 2GB) rather than trying to use Readyboost.<br>  <br>  Readyboost is not really RAM - it's a form of "virtual RAM" using flash memory and is not as fast as genuine RAM.|`|3LHsCLVFaa	Probably not if you already have at least 2 gig of system ram. The 32 bit OS can only use 4gig and the 64 bit version 8gig.|`|BavxZqm8aa	32 gig of ram???????? are you crazy?<br>  <br>  i think this must be storage|`|FDEHTG6uaa	It wouldn't make much difference. I'd think 3GB of RAM with Vista would be pretty much it, unless you play games. Even then, you won't be filling 3GB in a hurry.

This is happening because you are using HTML email and your letter it will come built in with hidden tags to determine the size of the type and so the best thing to do is to dump it into a word pad or whatever and print it from there.<br>  <br>  But also, Yahoo email is a pretty lousy client to be using. I could go on and on about it's shortcomings, but one you should know about is that since it is using a frame to view you mail in, if someone sends you something that has the wrong word wrap tags, then Yahoo may "scrunch" it to fit inside the frame, which may be what you are seeing<br>  <br>  If this is the case, even if you dump it into a word editor, it may not help. You can try increasing the resolution as in going up to view, reduce text size, before you copy it. Or you can  forward your email to a better client, like Outlook, which is what I would do<br>  <br>  Or one last thing you can try, is go to your browser tool bar to view/page style/none|`|FDEHTG6uaa	The best thing you can do to print out emails is just to copy the text into a word processor, and then print. The reason is because even though the layout you see is optimized for reading on screen, because the words are warped (Try pasting a lot of text into Notepad without word wrap on), it might not be optimized for printing. My 2 cents:D|`|fPHjh4Jsaa	if it is just text, then you can copy it into a word program then print it

Also just blocking people easily allows you to unblock them when you feel like talking to them.|`|tGcNmDUZaa	Well you can only block the people. There are sites who tell you who has blocked you, but usually they are scams and add your email adress to mailing lists for their products so I wouldn't use them. <br>  <br>  What I do, is write down the name of those people (or their email) and delete them.

Es decir, yo tengo una cmara digital (fotos) que tiene la funcin de convertirse en cmara web, slo que tengo que cambiar unas propiedades en la cmara para que cambie de funcionar como unidad de almacenamiento (para sacar fotos) y pase a funcionar como camara web.    Esto porque la computadora reconoce la cmara como unidad de almacenamiento, y para que no lo haga, la cmara tiene que poder "transformarse" en camara web.    Tendras que ver el manual de tu cmara o ver las propiedades de la misma.. sin embargo, no todas las cmaras tienen esa funcionalidad.

vvcaO1xgaa	There is no concept of a "cursor" in graphics as it is meant for drawing. Thus, you can't expect C graphics.h to provide you a cursor for text editing!.<br>  <br>  However, as a programmer you can devise your own cursor. The logic is simple. Just create a small horizontal white coloured line that is drawn after the last character is taken from the user. Devise your own algorithm to keep a check of changing lines and line and character spacing. For a blinking cursor you could simply have the white coloured line over-written with a black one(in effect hiding the white line) say after every 1 second or so. This would create the desired blinking effect. <br>  If you can manage multi-threading in C then you should design this cursor to run on a separate thread.

DEW9YM7jaa	Definately go for the Intel.<br>  -Very few games will really benefit from four cores and the E8500 will be faster in almost every (real) situation!<br>  -Also, the Core2Duo is so easy to overclock I'd expect you to be able to hit 4.0GHz without really having to try too hard.<br>  -The socket LGA775 will allow you to use any of the Core2Quad processors if you feel like upgrading to quad and these processors should be getting cheaper now that the i7 chips are out...|`|0fc906a92f0d1030cf506aea74935a77aa	Well it depends on your GPU too...but...<br>  The way I see it, for the price, the Phenom Tri Core is a better deal as;<br>  -Has a generous amount of cache<br>  -For the price, runs dual core games great AND as that extra core for when you need that extra umph and for quad core games<br>  -AM3 (or AM2+) board would be better for upgrading your CPU in the future as they are newest mobo and new AMD chips would be amde for it for quite a bit while Intel are starting to move to their newer board that supports DDR3 ram<br>  -AM3 supports BOTH DDR2 and 3 ram<br>  <br>  Basically, it seems better value imo if your on a budget.|`|dDQLlVF3aa	i was in the same boat i got the pII 720 the 3dmark scores it 25% higher then intel i love in tell but for my buget build this time the 720 was the way to go <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/ComboDealDetails.aspx?ItemList=Combo.163705" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/ComboDealD...</a><br>  a combo with this cooler and i got 3.52 out of it with no prob and i can run up and down my friends pc with a e8500 @ 3.8 go amd for the cost and performans.|`|HtfqFgEgaa	These are both good/excellent ways to go; try and leave out the sound card and shoot for the 9800GTX video card. It is double wide with extra cooling. And a Cool Master 550w power supply.

KJmuHxcCaa	Yes! you can. you have to by a wireless cable modem. My answer is short but that all u need to  know  best answer would be nice (:|`|UxlL89rHaa	Yes if you have wifi, its what i do.|`|I5pUxwPbaa	yes just buy a wireless modem, you will find one at any computer supply store. Some say it's a bit less safe as far as being hacked|`|t5sYXwSqaa	Yes as long as you have a wireless modem router or modem and wireless router. You will be able to connect to the internet wirelessly from your desktop PC.<br>  <br>  You will need an internal wireless PCI adaptor or an USB wireless adapter.<br>  <br>  Look here to get some ideas:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_e?url=..." rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_e?url=...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.google.com/products/catalog?q..." rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/products/catalog?q...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_e?url=..." rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_e?url=...</a><br>  Source(s):<br>  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using..." rel="nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using...</a>|`|I4TLCFf7aa	If you already have a WIFI modem or router, all you would need is a wireless adapter card for you computer.  The card will connect via one of the PCI slots on your motherboard.|`|9bSCOZB1aa	You can, but you will need to purchase a wireless adapter.|`|hjCySeC9aa	DESKTOP??? NO WAY! If you mean laptop, then yeah. If your internet service provider is Optimum, they give Wi-Fi for some places. If you can't connect, buy a wireless network adaptor from Linksys. Trust me, it works!
NkbhHcIAaa	based on your post i would be willing to bet it's a dead power pack|`|0003934bb4332a9e445607b7d52efbdeaa	Well if you know to how to check a CAP, then you should know the drill for trouble shooting a MOBO... Strip the MOBO of every Component & listen for the post codes.... Then replace each Component 1 at a time & restart the computer after each install..|`|x1YZgCCnaa	Your PSU may be dead or it could be and random thing with your Motherboard or Processor, these are the only 3 things that will cause a computer to do nothing when the power turned on. The LED light may come on even if the PSU is not working correctly and any break in the circuit on the Motherboard or Processor will cause it to stop working|`|xEoCu5iXaa	You need to give us more information. Is there any sound coming from the machine? Can you hear a hard drive spinning? Can you hear the fan moving? Is anything showing up on your screen? It could be a number of things. It may be the GPU. It may be the processor. It could be the HDD.
2afVnStxaa	has she had access to your computer? If so she may have placed a keylogger or a parental control program on it. Or she may be checking your history if she has access to your computer. Or of you are using your boyfriend's computer she may be getting access to this. there are many ways to stop her from doing this, but she may have a friend that knows how to hack or has set up a remote terminal to access your computer, she may have sent you an email from a "dummy" account that had you open an attachment or click on a link that placed spyware on your system. I can help but need more info to do so. You can email me from my profile and i will be glad to help you. There is way too much to list in the space that YA allows. Just go to my profile on Yahoo answers and email me from there. good luck to you.|`|ukNw9cVgaa	she shouldn't be able to see what pages you look at unless she's some sort of hacker.  Are you looking at her page?  She may be using Traczor or Trackzor... it's a spy soft wear that you can put on your page to see who's been on yours.  That's all I can think of.  She shouldn't be able to access any of your info if your page is private.  Make a new page and don't put your real name on the search.  I had to do that once.  I had crazy stalkers, so I closed down my previous page and made a new one with a false name and just had my closest friends and family on it.  Nobody else even knew that I had a page.  If you're looking at her page, you need to stop because she may have something that can tell who's been checking her info out.  Better yet, get rid of myspace and get a facebook.  Way more friendly. WAY more friendly.|`|vDqWrAIoaa	Are you on a cabled network connection? If so, right click on my computer and tick on properties. On system properties, tick on remote. If there is a check on remote desktop, remove it. Or, you can change your user account to administrator and secure it with a password of your choice. Just open control panel and tick on user account. Also, tick on folder option, tick on view and tick on restore defaults then apply. And if still enable her to spy on you, the problem is in your my space account. My space.com is a public domain. Everybody can access into your blog specially a member. Edit your account in my space and change your account name and password. You can ask my space help!!!|`|o9Xq0rOlaa	sounds like you have a keylogger  get something that scans for keyloggers, you can also try (Snoopfree) and see if someone is hooking your keyboard.,|`|zM0ag4NLaa	make a new one|`|AORcLwTNaa	open a new acct
zorYTX59aa	If you keep getting "HELLO, YOU EITHER HAVE JAVASCRIPT TURNED OFF OR AN <br>  OLD VERSION OF ADOBE'S FLASH PLAYER....GET THE LATEST FLASH PLAYER",<br>  and people are telling you to either install or get something, DO NOT TOUCH A THING.<br>  <br>  You will get absolutely nowhere messing around with "Java", <br>  "Flash" or different web browsers -- and definitely avoid any<br>  software that sales-pimps (disguised as answerers here on <br>  Yahoo) are trying to "sucker" you into buying.<br>  <br>  None of those things will help you, because your computer <br>  and YouTube were working perfectly fine a while ago, right? <br>  The first rule-of-thumb and best option should ALWAYS be:<br>  don't disable, erase, uninstall, switch, download, alter, add, <br>  change or install anything. That'll only make matters worse.<br>  <br>  I'm 100% positive both your "JavaScript" and "Flash Player"<br>  are fine. Nothing about watching YouTube videos has really<br>  changed in the past couple of years. If anything, the newer<br>  Flash Players have been known to give many YouTubers a <br>  lot of trouble, especially all 5 variations of version 10. (Why <br>  in the world is there a 10.0.525, 10.1.218, 10.2.26, 10.2.54<br>  and 10.12.36? The only thing that most upgrades are good <br>  for is their potential to create all kinds of software conflicts).<br>  <br>  Your problem may fix itself within a couple hours, or by the<br>  next day, because YouTube often "shuts down" a bunch of<br>  their own servers every single day without warning anybody, <br>  in order to update all kinds of stuff. During those occasions, <br>  it is actually YouTube's data transmissions of "Java" and/or <br>  "Flash" that are poor -- not yours.<br>  <br>  If the following day your YouTube is still stuck and showing <br>  you those awful "JavaScript" and "Flash Player" messages, <br>  it is possible that your subdirectories of "temporary internet <br>  files" and memory (many times called "cache") are entirely<br>  maxxed out and cannot take anymore, the end result being<br>  that YouTube videos cannot even make it onto your screen.<br>  <br>  "Temporary internet files" are tiny bits of webpages that get <br>  permanently put on your computer's hard-drive. They'll stay <br>  there forever and ever, gradually plugging up your computer <br>  much like hair slowly clogs a sink drain, until you get rid of <br>  them. The solution to that is to first exit YouTube, and then <br>  clear your "cache" of all its "TIFs" as well as your "cookies" <br>  and "history". Then reboot.<br>  <br>  Note 1: if you've got Google Web Accelerator or something<br>  similar to it...dump it, burn it, trash it, disable it, uninstall it; <br>  do all you can to get rid of it -- even though this contradicts <br>  my advice uptop. GWA conflicts with YouTube. Clicking on<br>  "Don't Accelerate This Website" won't help you whatsoever. <br>  (Some downloaders and converters also ruin YouTube too.)<br>  <br>  Note 2: longer videos only require "Flash" and "Shockwave"<br>  in order to play smooth. Other than that, avoid all the sales <br>  pitches that some Yahooers are shilling, because they are <br>  really disguised sales-people and peddlers. Their "answers" <br>  have nothing to do with your problem, and their wares may<br>  worsen your problem. Besides, what kind of selfish answer <br>  is that? [my paraphrase] "Although you cannot even watch <br>  or access videos, buy our downloader."<br>  <br>  Note 3: a very odd fix that once worked for me was altering<br>  the URL from "www.youtube.com" to simply "youtube.com"<br>  (or you could even try "ca.youtube.com").<br>  <br>  Note 4: if you think that "Flash" might be the problem, you<br>  should perhaps consider 9.45 or 9.47. I have never strayed <br>  away from 9.47, and lots of "flashers" swear by 9.45. Think<br>  of those two as you would Windows XP compared to Vista.<br>  Please consider this previous "Best Answer" of mine, then<br>  check out the Asker's comments afterwards:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=20081125075929AABZpVS">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=2...</a><br>  <br>  I hope that my information proves somewhat helpful for you.|`|NkbhHcIAaa	wanna bet you do not have you Java configured correctly . and thats why your still getting the error . messenger me I will walk you through it .. very easy fix|`|46OYLEXWaa	javascript is usually turned on by default...so, it might be your flash player is outdated..<br>  <br>  you can try a different browser...<br>  <br>  these will help you...<br>  <br>  1. Use Opera browser, it will load faster and smoother,  and re-install latest flash (the correct way)<br>  <br>  get the latest flash player, and install it.. make sure all the browsers are NOT running during installation... this is the right way to install the flash player.<br>  <br>  by the way, the javascript is turned on by default.<br>  <br>  OR..<br>  <br>  2. It could be due to slow connection or high traffic.<br>  Try watching it during off peak hours, the video will be smoother.<br>  <br>  Or you could watch it offline smoothly... try using 'zillatube' .<br>  <br>  It works well - Just google search "zillatube" to get it.<br>  <br>  ==========================???|`|MCeYbZEOaa	Well, what browser are you using? all i can say is if you are using internet explorer 8 then try using compatibility mode, other than that i have no idea what it could be.|`|yMchHj9eaa	Install Firefox and try it. You should have no problems there.<br>  <br>  If you are using IE, go into tools - Manage add-ons - enable or diable add-ons, search for flash and enable it.
