QoVL5cDHaa	John is way out of date with his answer. You will find the correct rates of 20% and 40% with tax bands on the site given by dandan.|`|C5JxA8k0aa	There is a Starting rate of 10% for a person with an annual income of less than ￡2,320 ($3,324.57); which would only really apply to somebody such as a teenager with a part time job.<br>  <br>  There is a Basic rate of income tax rate of 20% for somebody with an annual income of less than ￡34,800 ($49,868.52) and more than ￡2,320($3,324.57)<br>  <br>  And there is the higher rate of income tax of 40% which applies to somebody with an annual income which is greater than ￡34,800 (($49,868.52)<br>  <br>  I bet that taxes are much lower in America than in Britain.|`|AA11064924	Remember that we do have a Personal Allowance which is an amount of income you are allowed to earn before you pay any tax at all.  This amount for 2008/2009 is ￡6,035.  There is a starting rate of 10% for income above the personal allowance for savings income only.  This only applies if you live mainly on the interest from your savings.  If you are an employee this will not apply and the first tax band is 20% which is called the basic rate for all income up to ￡34,800 in excess of the personal allowance.  Income in excess of this is taxed at 40%.  The rates of tax are different for dividend income:  10% and 32.5% if this applies to you.  Do bear in mind that everyone must also pay National Insurance Contributions on top of their tax.  The rate is 11% of your income in excess of ￡5435 a year but any income in excess of ￡40040 has a lower rate of 1%.  I hope this doesn't all sound too confusing.  I just thought I would mention National Insurance since you have no option of paying it or not and therefore some people think of it as a kind of tax (even though strictly speaking it isn't!).|`|wRIaKxsAaa	Go to <a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/rates/it.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/rates/it.htm</a>|`|kA4fWsR7aa	it was something like a third or something around there

This will help you prepare for answering them in a quick and natural way.<br>  <br>  Dress for success!  If you dress professionally (slacks, button down shirt, & tie) it shows you take them seriously, so they will take you seriously.

5KxklhJCaa	you can work without any schooling but not doing patient care.<br>  even as a CNA you must be certified/licensed by the state. <br>  <br>  there is, in many states,  a process to challenge the CNA requirements and immediately test for certification which many nursing students do after their first year (even sooner is possible).<br>  <br>  you can not work as an LPN/LVN unless you have taken and passed the NCLEX-PN test. <br>  <br>  <br>  many employers will hire graduate nurses who have completed their education but have not yet taken and passed the NCLEX-RN test. this is known as a Graduate Nurse or GN. they must be closely supervised and can not work alone until they take and pass the NCLEX-RN test.|`|90baecbe3029033e6f4b3cb1f967a617aa	you can work in a hospital when you have passed the lvn test|`|F59WYtNKaa	There are areas of a hospital that a nursing student may find employment, particularly in patient care areas. Working as a nurses aid would give you valuable experience in patient care and help in your assessment skills. Any job in a hospital where you deal with patients will be beneficial to nurses training. Lab and radiology need help frequently with transporting patients and results. Keep your eyes and ears open, you can learn a lot. There are no one year nursing programs I know of. Even LPN programs take close to two years, and their scope of practice is very limited in most settings. Associate degree nurses deliver more direct patient care then any other level of degree in nursing.
XxUsLqXRaa	Although it wont be a "walk in the park" I definately think you should do the LVN class first and, while you're working as an LVN, start taking your RN prerequisites at your leisure while waiting on the RN waiting list.  Being an LVN first gives you a huge advantage while in RN school because you will already be proficient in the basics of nursing, you'll already be familiar with what goes on in the day-to-day nursing profession, and you'll have so much more confidence when you go into the hospital to start your RN internship.  Other students who were not LVN's first will be overwhelmed and bewildered and wont do as well as you would.|`|kQA7SbY9aa	If there's a waiting list, get yourself on it and go for the LVN while you're waiting. Looks good on your academic records or a resume and you'll be gaining experience. Anything that helps toward your preferred career is not a waste of time, in my opinion.<br>  <br>  All the best. :)|`|90baecbe3029033e6f4b3cb1f967a617aa	is it a guarantee that you will get accepted into the program after the 3 years. i say forget about the lvn and do the prereq. and at the sametime do your research and see if there is another college or hospital based nursing program that you can apply to.|`|oHsxp5weaa	I just had this conversation with a nurse today lol. She is an RN and she said if I wanted to go all the way to be an RN it was worth it but there was a lot of bull s*it to put up with and do.

DAMZKbpDaa	Probably, if you were a full time student and lived with your parents, it would be hard to justify that you provided more than half of your own support with only $3400.'<br>  <br>  In fact, it would not do you any good to claim yourself anyway.|`|AA11284831	When you attend school away from home you are treated as living in your parents' home for tax purposes.  Given your age, the test to be met to not be a dependent is that you must provide more than half of your OWN support.  If you didn't -- a stretch at only $3,400 -- then you ARE a dependent and you lost your personal exemption.  <br>  <br>  At your income, whether you can be claimed as a dependent or not is irrelevant.  Your income is well below the filing requirement amount of $5,450 for a dependent unless this was unearned income.  As such you will receive a full refund of all taxes withheld from your pay either way.

AA10305589	There is a limited amount of time during which you can apply.  You need to check the web site for unemployment benefis in the state in which you worked - the rules are different for different states.

LYeMqJIRaa	If nobody knows about it then no.  However any transaction over $12,000 (I believe that is the current limit) is not considered a "gift" and is subject to taxation.  Cash is better and in smaller amounts|`|M0fymVnBaa	There are two levels of exemption from the gift tax. First, transfers of a present interest up to (as of 2009) $13,000 per person per year are not subject to the tax. An individual can make gifts up to this amount to as many people as they wish each year. A married couple can pool their individual gift exemptions to make gifts worth up to $26,000 per couple per year without incurring any gift tax. Gifting is limited to a cumulative amount of $345,000 per year [SOURCE?]. A lifetime gifting limit of $1,000,000 (gifts above the annual exclusions) is allowed before a gift tax is incurred.<br>  <br>  If an individual or couple makes gifts of more than the limit, gift tax is incurred. The individual or couple has the option of paying the gift taxes that year, or to use some of the "unified credit" that would otherwise reduce the estate tax. In some situations it may be advisable to pay the tax in advance to reduce the size of the estate.<br>  <br>  In many instances, however, an estate planning strategy is to give the maximum amount possible to as many people as possible to reduce the size of the estate.<br>  <br>  Furthermore, transfers (whether by bequest, gift, or inheritance) in excess of $1 million may be subject to a generation-skipping transfer tax if certain other criteria are met.|`|V5lt4hJlaa	First of all.... I wouldn't take a check from a TOTAL STRANGER... it can be a stolen check or something and you can be in trouble.<br>  <br>  But I think you will have to pay taxes.|`|u93oneUXaa	Yes - a gift is only up to 10,000 per year. So you would exclude that much. The rest.. include in your income and it will get taxed accordingly.|`|DAMZKbpDaa	It would probably be a gift. You would not need to claim the money on your return, but the stranger would need to fill out a gift tax return.|`|NrOg2hrZaa	No, it was a Gift.

LfTxzDBMaa	If you are looking for a proven legitimate online home business there are a number of things you can do to try and establish whether the opportunity is legitimate or a scam.

3mAgM405aa	Besides setting all margins to 1", the most important criteria for setting up a professional resume besides relevant text, is "scanability." Here are some helpful tips:<br>  <br>  1. Place just below your identification header [your hame, address, phone, email address] any Conditional Warning Statement such as "Confidential Resume,"Do Not Contact Current Employer," etc.<br>  2. Always fill-in an Objectives category [just below the Conditional Warning Statement] and make sure that he Objective will contribute to the profitability of your future employer;<br>  3. Select a mono-type font such as Helvetica, Arial, Courier or Times Roman; do not select any cursive handwriting styles which cannot scanned;<br>  4. Keep font sizes within a range of 10 to 12 pts.;<br>  5. Avoid styling text with a justified alignment, keep it flushed left;<br>  6. Instead of using tabs to set up blocked text entries, generate a table and use the column and row settings accordingly;<br>  7. Do not place an i.d. picture anywhere on the resume, this is a major taboo due to discrimination issues;<br>  8. Do not place any graphic text [saved as .gifs] onto the resume since it may be overlooked during the scanning phase;<br>  9. List at the very end of the resume your interests which should include travel experiences, language skills, social interactions such as golf, team sports, tennis, etc.<br>  <br>  In conclusion, the above helpful hints were designed to allow ease of scanning of your resume into PDF which can then be text captured for seach purposes by your potential employer. If the original resume was created in Word, WordPerfect or Mac Appleworks, it can be Saved As a PDF file which then can be saved as an email attachment. Otherwise, you can simply use a scanner and scan a hard copy of the resume and then save as a PDF file. <br>  <br>  Failure to conform the resume to appropriate fonts and styles as outlined above will result in rejection of the resume simply due to the inability of the scanning device to properly index relevant resume entries.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AA10091923	well first of all we send out resumes ---NOT set them out....<br>  so first learn your grammar, then we can discuss your resume.<br>  <br>  good luck  :)

Sexual health and "safe sex" are so important now, and I strongly believe in teaching young people about the value of protection.  Yes, it would be better if they waited until they were older, but we all know that the world isn't the same as it was fifty years ago.  Kids today are having sex, and they need to know how to prevent pregnancy and disease.  They need to be taught that parenthood at 15 is not good in any way, for any person.  They need a place where they can be treated for STDs, if this problem arises.  These are some of the important things that Planned Parenthood does.  <br>  <br>  I'm pro-choice, and I just wish that more people would act in a responsible way BEFORE getting pregnant, since so many of them are not mature and responsible enough to care for a child.

Vz5vjAWRaa	Tell me about yourself. <br>  My background to date has been centered around preparing myself to become the very best _____ I can become. Let me tell you specifically how I've prepared myself . . . <br>  <br>  Why should I hire you? <br>   Because I sincerely believe that I'm the best person for the job. I realize that there are many other college students who have the ability to do this job. I also have that ability. But I also bring an additional quality that makes me the very best person for the job--my attitude for excellence. Not just giving lip service to excellence, but putting every part of myself into achieving it. In _____ and _____ I have consistently reached for becoming the very best I can become by doing the following . . . <br>  <br>  What is your long-range objective? Where do you want to be 10 or 15 years from now? <br>  Although it's certainly difficult to predict things far into the future, I know what direction I want to develop toward. Within five years, I would like to become the very best _____ your company has. In fact, my personal career mission statement is to become a world-class _____ in the _____ industry. I will work toward becoming the expert that others rely upon. And in doing so, I feel I will be fully prepared to take on any greater responsibilities that might be presented in the long term. <br>  <br>  How has your education prepared you for your career? <br>  As you will note on my resume, I've taken not only the required core classes in the _____ field, I've also gone above and beyond. I've taken every class the college has to offer in the field and also completed an independent study project specifically in this area. But it's not just taking the classes to gain academic knowledge--I've taken each class, both inside and outside of my major, with this profession in mind. So when we're studying _____ in _____, I've viewed it from the perspective of _____. In addition, I've always tried to keep a practical view of how the information would apply to my job. Not just theory, but how it would actually apply. My capstone course project in my final semester involved developing a real-world model of _____, which is very similar to what might be used within your company. Let me tell you more about it . . . <br>  <br>  Are you a team player? <br>  Very much so. In fact, I've had opportunities in both athletics and academics to develop my skills as a team player. I was involved in _____ at the intramural level, including leading my team in assists during the past year--I always try to help others achieve their best. In academics, I've worked on several team projects, serving as both a member and team leader. I've seen the value of working together as a team to achieve a greater goal than any one of us could have achieved individually. As an example . . . <br>  <br>  Have you ever had a conflict with a boss or professor? How was it resolved? <br>  Yes, I have had conflicts in the past. Never major ones, but certainly there have been situations where there was a disagreement that needed to be resolved. I've found that when conflict occurs, it's because of a failure to see both sides of the situation. Therefore, I ask the other person to give me their perspective and at the same time ask that they allow me to fully explain my perspective. At that point, I would work with the person to find out if a compromise could be reached. If not, I would submit to their decision because they are my superior. In the end, you have to be willing to submit yourself to the directives of your superior, whether you're in full agreement or not. An example of this was when . . . <br>  <br>  What is your greatest weakness? <br>  I would say my greatest weakness has been my lack of proper planning in the past. I would overcommit myself with too many variant tasks, then not be able to fully accomplish each as I would like. However, since I've come to recognize that weakness, I've taken steps to correct it. For example, I now carry a planning calendar in my pocket so that I can plan all of my appointments and "to do" items. Here, let me show you how I have this week planned out . . . <br>  <br>  If I were to ask your professors to describe you, what would they say? <br>  I believe they would say I'm a very energetic person, that I put my mind to the task at hand and see to it that it's accomplished. They would say that if they ever had something that needed to be done, I was the person who they could always depend on to see that it was accomplished. They would say that I always took a keen interest in the subjects I was studying and always sought ways to apply the knowledge in real world settings. Am I just guessing that they would say these things? No, in fact, I'm quite certain they would say those things because I have with me several letters of recommendation from my professors, and those are their very words. Let me show you . . . <br>  <br>  What qualities do you feel a successful manager should have? <br>  The key quality should be leadership--the ability to be the visionary for the people who are wor

As a result, the new tax credit works like an interest free loan.

mwkfirjRaa	You can withdraw from your 401k at age 55, but you must follow the rules and you need to know whether in your personal circumstances that is the best choice.  You may be better off rolling over the 401k to an IRA and then taking substantially equal periodic payments.<br>  <br>  You can make penalty-free withdrawals from a 401(k) at age 55. You must wait until age 59 1/2 to make penalty-free withdrawals from an IRA. While this seems like a big break for a 55-year-old retiree, there are several things to consider; (1) Your employer must make it convenient for an ex-employee to make retirement withdrawals, many employers can't be bothered, (2) Rolling over your 401(k) funds to an IRA may increase the variety of investments available to you and lower your fees. If that's the case, the hassle of SEPP withdrawals from an IRA may be worth it.<br>  <br>  Note: There is one fine point that many people miss in taking penalty-free withdrawals from a 401k at age 55. To do so, you must terminate your employment no earlier that the year in which you turn age 55. (See IRS Notice 87-13) If you retired at age 54 and waited until age 55 to make withdrawals from your 401k, you would not be able to make unlimited penalty-free withdrawals. You could only make penalty-free withdrawals by using substantially equal periodic payments.|`|bVHnNqzBaa	You cannot touch your 401(k) until age 59-1/2 without penalty.|`|83844defcdcb7e19fa8aea7dad5a5561aa	One way of getting what you want is to roll over your 401(k) into an IRA.

tdkEpKG3aa	to be a nurse (not particularly ER nuse),you have to be passionate about the job.being a nurse is a tiring job,i tell you.maybe you're just drawn into the hectic and fast moves of people in the ER,but once you're there,it's not the same.having a social life besides this is really up to you.others can stay awake for many hours after their night shift,for example.others just wanna go home and go to sleep and recharge.the bottom line is,if you love the job,it won't matter whether it's hard or not,because you enjoy doing it,.|`|NrOg2hrZaa	ER nurse is good.<br>  Steady pay and good benefits.<br>  Your not going to get that in High Fashion and Art.<br>  Yes, long rotten hours and you work Holiday's.<br>  If you want a good, steady paying career, go with ER.<br>  <br>  My doctor hired a person which is a "Nurse Practitioner".<br>  She handles minor stuff.

I wasn't an ER nurse, but have always been in the ICU and we were always decompressing at some local watering hole. I don't know if it's what you'd call glamorous, but it sure was alot of fun!|`|1lF6vumIaa	I majored in nursing for a while and went through a few clinicals before deciding it was not for me.  I would say that nursing is the opposite of glamorous, but that doesn't mean you can't spend your off days doing whatever it is you love.  I know that many nurses work long shifts and can therefore get three days off per week instead of just two.  This would give you a long time every week to spend on your hobbies and social life - although, as you mentioned, you may be required to work weekends and holidays.  I think you can have your cake and eat it, too, with nearly any career, as long as you manage your time wisely on your off days.  Good luck with your dreams.  Nursing is a very admirable career.  I'm sure you will find it fulfilling, and will eventually be able to balance your social life and job!|`|90baecbe3029033e6f4b3cb1f967a617aa	observing ER nurses and thinking this is the job for you is one think. i use to be the same way but when youre on your own, no classmates or clinical instructors to help you, you almost wanna cry or go back to school somtimes. its different when youre no longer looking in. but i must say its an exciting, very fast paced place to work. which leads me to my other point. <br>  <br>  after running around the ER for 12 hours straight, many a nights with no break when you go home, you crash. i have slept for 16 hours straight sometimes on my days off. but the good thing is you only work 3 days a week, 13 days for the month so if you make your schedule right you can have the day off you need to do whatever else you wanna do.<br>  <br>  i dont think having a social live is hard at all. its just that you might wanna warn family members a friends to give you a heads up about certain events,so that way you can either switch with someone or request the day off. hope i helped
MJijF66Paa	I sold the majority of my gold last March when gold originally peak at $1000 because I figure people were going to start to notice GLD and intervene. Right after, the dollar rallied as these companies began trying to deleverage their stock prices up, creating this mass liquidation. In turn this took GLD back to $750, where I bought back my GLD, which I still have at this current moment.<br>  <br>  GLD is going to keep rising from here. I expect GLD to hit $2000 before the year is through. With inflation rates as they are now (Don't go by CPI reports) all precious metals are all going to highs with the dollar. The dollar maybe rising to these other fiat currencies, but as you can see, in real value assets, the dollar is falling. <br>  <br>  The only thing that you should be aware of now is the IMF. Recently the IMF came out discussing the possibility of selling their large gold reserves to help hedge themselves against the global recession. This would in fact push GLD prices down.<br>  <br>  Personally I hope they do sell their gold. Once their gold is depleted, so will their equity dry up, thus ending the IMF. Also the temporary low GLD prices would be a great time to buy some more gold, which is something I'll do either way.<br>  <br>  -Edited In-<br>  In truth, gold enter a bull market 10 years ago, which would of been the most ideal time to buy into the market. But be that as it may, gold is still going to keep gaining. People who are interjecting this idea that gold is in a bubble, obviously do not understand how commodities work or trade. The idea you should accept a saving account which rates of 3-4% are below the inflation rate is absurd! You'll lose money!<br>  <br>  I see you're a bit uncertain so I would suggest you look into silver, which is less stressful I suppose. Silver is another precious metal that will keep gaining in value as inflation rates continues to rise and the bull in commodities carries on. Although I do buy more gold, I, myself, own plenty of silver.<br>  <br>  Silver, like most other metals, was down due to the dollar rally, but is still on its way up. And either way, it's better then buying into the bond bubble or saving accounts.|`|AA12291184	people say gold is great just like they say real estate is great.<br>  <br>  honest answer- who knows???|`|ZOXoPgJbaa	honestly its a great time. I think we are only seeing the tip of the iceberg.|`|i0vcEyJtaa	Now! When the Dollar collapses, trust me, your Dollar won't be able to buy food. Gold is climbing up fast, so is silver, platinum. If I were you, I'd invest here, these guys have predicted the economic collapse 8 years ago. They are also free market economists. But look into foreign stocks, don't invest in anything here in the US, the stock market is unhealthy. I'd suggest to look at stocks in Hong Kong, or other valuable, foreign commodities.<br>  <br>  People would do anything for gold these days...|`|A2qbzxrfaa	Yes, paper money may not be worth anything before to long.|`|l1FfxlwAaa	very smart investment right now|`|AA11058119	The gold bubble will burst just like every other bubble does. When the economy is down, people like to flock to gold because society has pinned it as something that will always have value.<br>  <br>  This is not the case. Gold demand can decrease just like any other commodity. Luxury spending is where gold gets most of its value, and in this recession, people are pulling back on luxury spending. However, golds price is going up because of speculation (some fear inflation, others just see it as a safe haven).<br>  <br>  Now is not the time to buy. If you currently own gold, sell it off. There's not much upside, and it's already overbought.|`|qxkk9xX4aa	The worst thing to do is buy something simply because it's going up. Gold has earned an average of 4% compounded interest. Looking to play it safe? There are banks that offer 3-4% interest in savings accounts that are guaranteed against any loss up to $250,000.<br>  <br>  If you want to invest, you should look into stocks. A stock is a piece of ownership in a business. Gold doesn't make more gold. Businesses make money. You have to really pound away at the information pavement. I've been investing heavily in this downturn because people are going to look back to today, and say WOW I wish I would have invested X many years ago.|`|634ac4e210089e28eaeb432cc5aec16faa	i think you should wait for 2-3 months as the price will come down.

Dont buy gold thinking it's going to protect you from inflation.|`|6GOXC5g9aa	I think its still a good time to buy gold.

p83LGQIYaa	Under Sec. 168(b)(2)(B) and Regs. Sec. 1.263A-4(a)(4)(i), horse owners are deemed to be in the trade or business of farming; thus, their horses are depreciated over either a three-year or seven-year life, using the 150% declining-balance (DB) method. The normal recovery period and the applicable recovery percentages are presented in Exhibit 1 on p. 73 (see Rev. Proc. 8757, Sections 3 and 4 and Table A-14). <br>  <br>  According to Sec. 168(b)(4), salvage value is ignored.

If expenditures exceeded $400,000 for 2003, the $100,000 amount had to reduced, dollar-for-dollar, for the excess; the expense deduction fully phased out at $500,000 of costs

If no one shows up and it's uncontested, the debt is erased and the company claims it with the government as a business loss.  But you always run the risk of a representative showing up and fighting it, and ultimately that debt may not be removed at all.  A chapter 13 bankruptcy will stay on your credit report for 10 years.  Until then, you're pretty much treated like you have the plague when it comes to trying to buy something on credit.  Sometimes, even though it will still be on your report, creditors will start to worry less about a bankruptcy once it hits the 7 year mark, but you'll still be charged higher interest rates on whatever you want to buy.  Also, remember that you cant claim your house and car into the bankruptcy because those are things that the creditors can (and will) simply take away from you.

Zt2wk1FJaa	You'll need to consult with a Bankruptcy Attorney.  There are new BK laws that are in effect (unlike in the past when you can file BK, and everything is erased).  The laws have changed with what you can and can't do with your debt.<br>  <br>  Sorry, I'm not much help, but a specialty BK Attorney should be able to help you out with these questions.<br>  <br>  Check out this website for details re: the new BK Laws:<br>  <a href="http://www.bankruptcylawinformation.com/index.cfm?event=dspKeyChanges" rel="nofollow">http://www.bankruptcylawinformation.com/...</a><br>  <br>  FYI Only: In the event you end up filing BK, it remains on your record for 10 years.|`|2gFem71maa	First, know that you absolutely do not have to file bankruptcy and there are other options.  If you do file bankruptcy, you will NOT lose your furniture or other necessities. <br>  <br>  If you can, keep current payments on your vehicle.  As long as you are current, you will be fine and will be able to keep your car.  The only entity that has the right to take the car that you are making payments on is the lien holder and that is only IF you fall behind.  <br>  <br>  Concerning bankruptcy and what can be sold to satisfy creditors, it depends on the state that you live in and what the exemptions are.  Definitely check this out.  The items that are exempt can not be taken by creditors during bankruptcy and can't be taken if you are sued.  I live in Texas, have a whole lotta debt that I have not paid, and all of my property is exempt from creditors.  I have even been sued by a couple of creditors but I have nothing they can touch because in Texas my car, household goods and even house (if I owned one) are safe.  One thing most states have in common and that you will not be left without your necessities.  When filing for bankruptcy, you have the right to re-affirm debt if you can keep paying on it.  This is something you could do with your car.<br>  If you are looking for more information on bankruptcy/exempt property see <a href="http://www.bankruptcyaction.com/bankruptcyexemptions.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.bankruptcyaction.com/bankrupt...</a><br>  This is just one site I found real quickly that gives this info.  This site just demonstrates that you have property that will be safe--if you want to actually file--you should talk with a lawyer for more details.  <br>  <br>  Also, keep in mind, the amounts for the exempt property is not how much you paid, but how much it is worth (think garage sale prices).  So if you see you are exempt $1000 in furniture, that doesn't mean purchase price so that $1000 will go further than you may think at first. <br>  <br>  Another option you can consider is just not paying.  The same property exemptions apply and then you can properly take care of your family in these hard times.  I have done this and am extremely happy.  <br>  <br>  <br>  If you are looking for more information on the notion of not paying and continuing to live your life, I recommend you take a look at Mic Insky's book called Uncollectible: A Book about escaping credit card debt.  I have included an excerpt I found helpful and inspiring:<br>  <br>  "Because of the image the industry purchases, and the emotions the industry preys upon, people who fall into debt have a tendency to browbeat themselves.  Many feel that they are fools for becoming overwhelmed with debt, regardless of how it happened.  Still others are afraid of acting like an underhanded scoundrel or a low-life by not paying their credit card bills.  The industry is betting on most debtors succumbing to such thoughts and emotions, thus continuing in their life of fiscal servitude.<br>   Rest assured, you are not a fool for becoming indebted to the credit card industry, nor are you a low-life if you cannot (or do not) pay your bills.  The credit card industry has become abusive."|`|R3LnVSm8aa	Don't be afraid of bankruptcy.  Yes the rules have changed, but it is still an action that you could benefit from.

mwkfirjRaa	It depends on how much convenience you're offered and how much money you deposit.<br>  <br>  Generally speaking, more convenience or lower deposits = lower interest rates.  Basic savings accounts and many interest-bearing checking accounts pay .10% to .25% APY or less, though there are some exceptions.<br>  <br>  Certificates of deposits or time deposits can pay up to 5% APY if you take a longer term (e.g., 5 years) and offer $100,000 for deposit.  Again, there are exceptions.  You may find some banks offering special promotions in which you can take a shorter term and/or deposit less money and still get a very high rate.|`|bVHnNqzBaa	For a typical account, interest is around 0.5 to 1.0% per annum.

Embora a profiss?o ainda n?o seja regulamentada (ainda n?o existem leis exigindo esta ou aquela qualifica??o), os designers graduados costumam denuncia ao Min. do Trabalho aqueles "curiosos"que fazem "bicos" usando computador, o que acredito n?o ser o caso dele.<br>  <br>  Ent?o ele aprende português, vocês vêm para o Brasil, e, quando tiver montado o estúdio tipo "home ofice", você p?e o anúncio por ele nos jornais, na internet (Mercado Livre, por exemplo), etc.<br>  <br>  No início (primeiros anos) ele vai precisar bastante do seu auxílio, pois um bom designer gráfico (estou imaginando que seja designer gráfico e n?o, designer industrial) precisa saber como a sociedade pensa para poder comunidar suas idéias do melhor modo e assim, se destacar dos demais.<br>  <br>  Se vocês possuem  recursos para, a melhor op??o é abrir o próprio negócio como empresa doméstica ou trabalhar como aut?nomo.<br>  <br>  Eu recomendo a você o livro "VIVER DE DESIGN - Gilberto Strunck". <br>  <a href="http://www.submarino.com.br/produto/1/233259?franq=184133" rel="nofollow">http://www.submarino.com.br/produto/1/23...</a><br>  <br>  Nele, você encontra dicas de como conseguir clientes e como pagar o INSS na condi??o de aut?nomo, ou rpofissional auto-empregado.<br>  <br>  Beijos pra vc e boa sorte.<br>  <br>  PS.

XDSphbCeaa	Typically with a short sale the agent puts the house on the market at an incredible price to attract potential buyers. However, in order for a short sale to happen the bank has to approve it. Not the current owner but the bank. <br>  <br>  Most agents don't get bank approval for the short sale  which they need in order to sell the home before coming up with a list price. Instead, they put the house on the market at a great price. Then, wait for a buyer to make an offer. Once you make an offer your offer is sent to the bank for approval. The bank then let's the listing agent know whether they will or won't accept the offer. If the list price was set too low and you make an offer for the list price the bank will either reject or counter the offer. <br>  <br>  In your case they countered. The bank tries to get market value for the property. Typically they try to stay within 5% of the appraised value.|`|mIyUCey4aa	Well since there is no binding contract between both parties I suppose they can change whatever at the last minute. Greed seems to be the key in this case. If you offered to pay their listed price, I would stay at that. How many people actually offer to pay the listing price? And with the market as it is now, anyone who actually gets an exact offer should jump on that quick.|`|01f0dac47a423ecab2421c4e39d16905aa	Most properties in this market are going to jump on a buyer.  Tell them you want to walk.  There isn't a contract.  They can get what you bid or they can put it back on the market.  Walk away.  Tell them that you won't take it.  Otherwise you are walking if they say you need to pay ask for a contractual obligation for you.  If there is none and they want the money hire a lawyer.  Take care of this ASAP.  Or just don't ever respond to them again and they will get the message.|`|9c7d64a28e8acf14270f5aa9f8e3e1e0aa	How do you know there is not a higher offer?<br>  <br>  You don't...since they don't release offers.<br>  <br>  When you say "they" you need to clarify:  The homeowner or the lender?<br>  <br>  If it's a short sale you present the offer to the LENDER NOT THE homeowner.
AA11284831	The only thing you need to claim it is a Form 5405.  However due to the amounts of money involved this will likely be a fraud target so the IRS is already requesting proof of eligibility such as copies of the HUD-1 settlement sheet or copies of the recorded deed showing the transfer date or copies of the certificate of occupancy for new construction.  Have that handy if requested by the IRS.<br>  <br>  Real estate records are a matter of public records.  Sometimes the IRS can verify eligibility without contacting the taxpayer but if they can't they may be in touch for proof.<br>  <br>  You can claim a 2009 purchase on your 2008 return but you cannot claim it until AFTER you close on the purchase.  Loans are irrelevant to the credit.  The credit is based upon the purchase price of the home, not the amount of any loans.  A cash purchase qualifies as well.|`|PkCTYMbnaa	We didnt have to do that for our. Ours was just the 5405 tax form with our return. and so far have not asked for any proof.

I spoke with IRS and they told me in most instances they have everything already about the loans.|`|Z74rsWznaa	It isn't all that complicated.

So they may be holding you to a higher standard in preparation for this. It's a common practice to do this to see how a person will react to stressful situations. I personally don't think this is good management, buy employers still utilize these antiquated methods. If it persist ask your supervisor if you can speak with them in private and voice your concerns. It may just be that your position is the easiest to refill so no loss on their part if you quit.

You will also need great references since you don't have work experience. Talk to teachers, counselors, clergy, coaches, club sponsors, and directors of places you have volunteered or people you have done casual labor for and ask them about giving you a reference. Get accurate, current contact information for them and ask them to be ready to get calls for references from potential employers.<br>  <br>  Remember:<br>  Most businesses are individually owned and operated so it is the owner’s policy and past experience with minors that will determine if they will hire you.

DGFu03Q3aa	Dear Jay:  Sounds like you have two issues. The 2006 issue and the 2008 issue. If this year you had a refund, you did not have an underpayment penalty as you paid all of your taxes and then some. If an underpayment penality is due on 2006 the IRS will calculate it for you for 2006, they never combine years. <br>  <br>  This advice was prepared based on our understanding of the tax law in effect at the time it was written as it applies to the facts that you provided.

bd9b10c61be129eb44a25e767b74c0dbaa	Short version: <br>  <br>  - Renters insurance is used to protect your physical property (assets) declared as contents.  It also provides personal liability for the named insured in the event you are found liable for your actions.  If your dog was to get away and bite someone, you can be faced with a legal action of negligence due to your failure to properly safeguard and contain the dog.  Whether someone served you with legal action and is right or wrong, the liability portion will provide you with legal defense.  Meaning, the insurer will have its assigned counsel defend you in court to mitigate its risk.  When I say "its risk", yes it is the insurers risk as you paid a "premium" to transfer the risk to the insurance company and they accepted the risk for a premium equal to the risk.  If you owned a home, then you would insure it with a homeowners policy which adds coverage for the replacement cost of the dwelling (home/structure) and coverage for your contents. If you have jewelry that is rare or expensive (as defined by the policy), you may have to declare it and schedule it with an amount.<br>  - You would want renters insurance (a) to insure your risk of loss due to a covered peril against your property (b) your landlord may want it to ensure that in the event of a loss the landlord can be defended in court as their interests appear without having to pony up for legal advice and expenses. <br>  - You would not want renters insurance if you lived in your parents home or if coverage for property and liability were already present..this would present duplicate coverage. <br>  <br>  The overall cost is so small that even if your property values were under the minimum the insurer covers (say you had $5K worth of property i.e computer, clothes, furniture, kitchen equipment, tv and the min value is 25,000 by the insurer) you're getting coverage for a range of $100 - $200 annually....about $12 a month.

But you don't have that much money to start with so you start with a par value of just a cent per share, some $10 million of your own money.<br>  <br>  Next you try to raise some capital to do what you intend, which would cost about $30 million, minimum, but no one wants to buy these pink sheet stocks. So you try to borrow money, but the same problem faces you when you try to sell the bank on loaning you money. Then you approach some monied person and he says something like, "If you will issue me one million shares of preferred stock and pay me a dividend of 5 percent, I will buy them with $25 million."  Of course, you are elated. Now you have $35 million in assets, so you can start to buy what you need to get things going.<br>  <br>  Business starts out okay, but things get dicey and the competition issues a new product that you can't fight. You and your board of directors decide to liquidate the company. You have to pay off your current debts. Then you have to pay off the long term debts. Now you have the remaining stockholder equity, $26 million. There is a billion shares of common stock and a million shares of preferred. You think each share is worth something like 2.5 cents and start to multiply that times the number of shares you own and are feeling like you came out ahead because this was greater than that fraction of a cent per share you started with. <br>  <br>  Not so fast the owner of the preferred shares says. You have to pay me first, $25 million. You read the details common to preferred stocks and realize that you only have $1 million left for common shareholders. That means each share of common stock gets one-tenth of one cent. You put $10 million in and get a $1 million or less (depends on how many shares you have sold in the meanwhile).|`|DSLlioPcaa	The common stock is an equity share while preferred stock is a debt instrument of a company. So, if you become a common shareholder of a company, you would become an equitys holder. When you buy into preferred stocks, you effectively become a debt holder (a creditor) of the company.
DAMZKbpDaa	Unemployment is a state program, and the state you live in makes the rules, more or less. But most state programs are designed to support workers who lose their jobs through no fault of their own.<br>  <br>  In the state I live in, you would not be eligible for unemployment if going to school interfered with your employment. If it didn't, say, you went to school in the evenings, then you would still be eligible for unemployment.<br>  <br>  From what you describe, I doubt you would qualify for unemployment, although, like I said, it is a state program and you may just live in a very generous state.|`|AA11284831	No, sorry, but quitting voluntarily to attend school won't qualify you for unemployment compensation.|`|RxeQJcqhaa	Sorry, but you can't get unemployment benefits if you quit your job.

The information is going to be from the prior titled owner, the guy the bank foreclosed upon. <br>  <br>  It's pretty obvious, from that information, that the repairs were not made, which is why the claim is still open.  This is very common with foreclosed properties - it's very, very much buyer beware.<br>  <br>  You are probably not going to find anyone willing to insure this property, unless you've had an inspector go through it with a fine tooth comb, and certify that he can't find any existing damage.  Most likely, the utilities are not on, on this house, though, so that could be an issue.<br>  <br>  The information on the claim, is "private" to that prior owner.  Protected by privacy laws, etc, HOWEVER, it's going to show up on the clue report with every insurance company you go to.  Unless you can have someone contact that prior carrier, the insurance company, and get them to break the privacy laws, you're probably not going to get an answer on this.

Pjm9pg7iaa	It does not really mean anything. Everyone who opens a business has to become profitable. If you don't make a profit , you keep emptying your bank account until you have to close the business. Each person tries to explain the "critical success factor" that allowed them to make a profit. But it is almost impossible to put that "factor" into words.<br>  For some, it was advertising. But many businesspeople advertise and feel like they wasted their money. For others it was hiring great employees. But if you don't have a great product to sell, employees can't help much. For most owners, the number one "factor" was having enuf money in the bank to get thru long periods of "bad times". Every business has to endure periods where no money is coming in..

Next, for each web hosting X, do a “X sucks” search on Google. Read some complaints and see if you may encounter the same problems like them. Some of the complaints may relate to certain groups of users only such as VPS, dedicated server users or resellers. So you may not be affected if you are not from these categories.<br>  <br>     3.

Unfortunately collection companies only deal in money and block out anything else you say. I don't know what authority regulates collectors but you should be able to find out be googling or maybe another respondent will know. You should report their actions to them. The credit bureau can't help you since they do not negotiate with collectors and the information they have is correct.

They all have numerous complaints and NCO's number is due to their size. They are one of the largest and most respected collection agencies. <br>  <br>  2) Wyse Financial is probably another collection unrelated collection agency.<br>  <br>  3) NCO Financial Systems has a sister corporation, NCO Portfolio Management which purchases debts and sues on them. <br>  <br>  4) If you feel you have been harassed or abuse by any collection agency, find a consumer attorney in your area. Usually, if you feel you have been misled or harassed by a collection agency they have violated the Federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA). Even little things you would never think of could be violation. This could mean the agency owes you money. Find a consumer attorney in your area.

My store has been open for over a year. we've hired one person. in a year. (we take about 10 apps a day, so that means your chances of getting hired at our store are about 1/3650)  i hate to be the bearer of bad news, but any open position at starbucks is going to go to the thousands of starbucks employees that are looking for the same position as you are. <br>  <br>  oh, and that one girl that got hired, was mostly hired because she's the niece of one of the regional facilities managers.. so we didn't have much choice, unless we wanted to be the black sheep store.<br>  so unless you have relative connections, make that 0/3650.

M0fymVnBaa	Pizza Boy, I was once in your shoes. All this deal about stocks, markets, and news seemed like comtemporary kanji. Stocks are just like bills. Just like the US dollar represents a unit of value from the US governement, it is the same with a stock, just a unit of value from a certain company. The value of the dollar fluctuates against other currencies of the other countries, so do stocks against the stocks of other companies. <br>  <br>  Yet, making money on buying stocks is very tricky. You will hear that there are a lot of bums who claim they made millions trading stock. I am here to tell you that this is like hitting the lottery, it involves losing a lot of money to maybe make a little every now and then. Trading sites ($5 per trade) dwell on this fantasy and sell it very well. A trade is a transaction to buy stocks. Yet, the problem with buying single-company stocks is that the risk is very high (like the lottery, only with more money at stake). You must diversify your risk, you can do this with mutual funds (funds based on the stock of many companies, so if one goes down, the others are highly likely to do better) Therefore, the upside can be more profitable, conservative, but profitable. <br>  <br>  I use stockcharts.com, vanguard.com, and finance.google.com to research stocks or funds. Fidelity is a very good company which offers many programs for investing. The key to successful investing is to research, study, do your homework, and learn. Never take someone's advice and follow it to the T. That will lose you money quick, fast, and in a hurry. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|Ch9TedMcaa	Stocks are simply part ownership of a company.

zNPP0TdVaa	Ok.  I hope you live in Las Vegas.  Only because there are so many casino opportunities here.  I recommend getting a full-time security position at one of the Big Nice Casinos.(Venetian,Bellagio,Caesar's,Wynn...  Then try to get a job as a "surveillance agent"(that's the name of the job you want) at one of the many teeny tiny crap holes that we have here.  They are all over the place.  Get in at one of these places i.e. "Poker Palace" in North Las Vegas( a real sh!thole).  Here you will get the experience that you will need to be hired by a middle level casino.  Hopefully there will be a supervisor that can teach you how to spot card counters, dice sliders, past posters and the like.  Middle level swould be like one of the lesser Stations Casinos that we have in Las Vegas.  So you should also keep looking for internal postings at your job at one of the "nice casinos where you work security.  You don't need school for this job.
M0fymVnBaa	Well, sir, you raise a question on a very likely situation. The problem with fiat money (paper currency) is that it can (and it is) printed out in out of control amounts, which is what causes inflation. Hyperinflation is very scary, but unfortunately, we are cooking this recipe with the right ingredients. It would be almost impossible for the dish not to have the flavor of this scary financial phenomenon. <br>  <br>  Gold (Au) and Silver (Ag) have been used as money for over 5,000 years. The best thing about these two is that they cannot be created in a lab, or in a printing press. Therefore, they are safehouse against inflation. The most common way to invest in these two is by buying bullion coins, like the American Gold Eagle, American Gold Buffalo, the Canadian Maple Leaf, the Chinese Panda, and even the South African Kruggerand. These coins come in 1 oz, 1/2 oz., and even 1/4 oz coins. Like with stocks, you pay a premium to get these from a coin dealer. Premiums now roam around $50 to $70 per ounce, depending on the coin. The American coins are more desirable, therefore more expensive. But unlike stocks, it becomes harder to track capital gains. At the end of 2010, we will have to pay 20% in capital gains for stocks. With gold and silver bullion coins (paid for in cash) have no paper trails so capital gains are difficult to track. <br>  <br>  Another posible investments are the I-bonds and Inflation-protected funds, these pay out a dividend or grow in interest based on the rate of inflation. The problem with these is that they rely on the CPI inflation rate reported by the US government, which most know has been underreported for several years. <br>  <br>  Good luck. Invest in commodities, but also invest in guns and ammo. Hyperinflation will hit a lot of people and when commodities become scarce, people will continue to be hungry and those who cannot get food will venture outside morality and possibly into our homes. It is sad, but it is better to have the tools and not need them and not have them and need them in a moment of truth.|`|Ch9TedMcaa	no load growth and income stock funds, index funds|`|nzQw5jqXaa	Your best investment would be gold. Gold has been around for thousands of years and will always have value. You should have gold bullion coins ( not collector) because they are easy to buy and sell.<br>  You can aslo use silver coins.|`|LgOTo3NYaa	Future Hyperinflation has been a concern of mine as well.  Hard assets will always be of some value, and could survive a dollar collapse if it came to that.  Real Estate, Gold, Physical Commodities, all have intrinsic worth over paper assets.  <br>  My research into the issue has revealed an interesting take on the topic.  Oddly, Debt is also something that might be of potential benefit to the person that prudently takes it on.  Governments have often paid off war costs by inflating their way out of debts.  Low interest rate loans are paid off over time in currency which has less purchasing power.  Purchasing power of money is the key.<br>  The novel idea of using current Strong money borrowed at low fixed rates to acquire hard assets that could then produce income which could pay off those fixed rate loans in future Weak dollars which are worth less to the holder of the loan effectively transfers wealth from the loaner to the borrower.  Interesting idea.  Not something easy to get your arms around, but worth some reading.<br>  I would refer you to a free series I recently read, put forth by Daniel R. Amerman.  Its an eye opening read and free.  Its a series called Inflation into Wealth.   A link is below.<br>  Good Luck!

RqQDKEVHaa	It's too wordy and there's a lack of parallelism.<br>  <br>  It's also unclear what you're doing. You talk about "helping you generate a settlement." So, are you lawyers? Or paralegals? Or negotiators? Further, a lot of the items you list don't involve settlements. And some, such as the tax auction one, are very narrow.<br>  <br>  On top of that, the phrasing is odd. No other word for it.<br>  <br>  And you've got to sell the benefits. Don't just list potential problems. Show the customers the benefits you bring to the table.<br>  <br>  Maybe something like:<br>  <br>  Have a problem with the law? We can help you. We're here 24/7 to help solve your legal headaches.<br>  <br>  What sort of headaches?<br>  <br>  Trying to transfer home ownership of someone who has died or who can't be found? We can help.<br>  <br>  [Etc.]<br>  <br>  In a lot of the cases, I don't know what you're offering. You're posing the problem: Paying for the attorney, court, and property tax fees. So, do you pay for the attorney, court, and property tax fees? If not, what do you do?<br>  <br>  Similarly, you say "Representation in court without a written will." Unclear. Presumably the person without a written will is dead. Are you saying you represent the estate? Or relatives?<br>  <br>  You say "Filing paperwork to protect your stay within a property." Totally meaningless. Do you mean if someone's getting evicted you'll file paperwork to help them stay? Or do you mean foreclosures?<br>  <br>  Again, sell the benefits of what you do. Don't overcomplicate it.<br>  <br>  And the final line doesn't make sense, and doesn't sell. You haven't posed "unusual" questions above. In fact, the scenarios you lay out shouldn't be unusual. They should be things your potential clients can relate to. Thus, the hesitancy to call you won't be based on a fear that the question is unusual. The hesitancy will be based on a question about whether you really can help them.<br>  <br>  So, inject some urgency and a time deadline into the close.

F8Ac1pPNaa	This is a great article on how to budget. And another article on ways to cut back on spending.|`|2PDBxlYDaa	Through practice...just make yourself. At the end of the week or of the month, reward yourself. It doesn't have to be financial reward, just something fun for yourself.|`|VMemlkRUaa	Learning to budget your money is an important step in your financial health. Once you have written down your income and expenses you will start to see where your money is going and some of it may surprise you. It will be the small expenses that add up the quickest. Spending five dollars on lunch everyday, or that morning coffee you get on the way to work can add up to several hundred dollars a month. That is money that could be doing more good if used more wisely.<br>  The first step to learning to budget money is writing everything down. Start with your monthly income and write that down at the top of a piece of paper. Now you know how much money you have to spend through the month. Start figuring up all your monthly expenses. This includes everything from your mortgage and utility payments, car payments, credit cards on down to the smallest expenditures. Write these down keeping them in specific categories. <br>  Start by carrying a notepad with you, and everytime you spend money, write it into your pad.  At the end of the month sit down and put all the money that you've spent into the categories you created above.  Subtract your expenses from your income and see what's left.<br>  This is your first budget because it shows you what your money has been doing every month. Now that you do indeed have a budget you can look at it and it becomes much easier to not only see where the money is going but also to take back control of where the money is going. And when that happens you can start to set goals, both short term and long term, for your money.|`|FYjhtUx2aa	Start small by noting/writing all your daily expenses, so that you know how you spend your money.

But some people just don't like to even think of numbers so one of the chains (JH or HR, etc) could help you out. Depending on how complicated your return is, you could be charged $100 or more and people usually say the service is hit-or-miss. You may get a really good tax professional who has been working there for years or you may get someone who just took one of their "quick study" courses and is doing taxes to earn a few bucks. Either way, the company will stand by the return.<br>  <br>  You can also hire a CPA - there are many CPA’s online that you can use. Plus, CPA's are probably the most knowledgeable in terms of tax law and regulations and during this time of year, many charge extremely competitive rates - sometimes better than HR / JH or the software packages.  In fact, the one I use each year only charges around $50 for my return – it’s really a great deals compared to the other guys.|`|pueeMH6gaa	With the current President it's very simple.

Writing ebooks is also another great thing.<br>  <br>  submit to directories. get backlinks from other websites in exchange. <br>  <br>  you can explore in many ways.|`|3mAgM405aa	Here's the definitive tutorial from Google.com on how SEO really works:<br>  <br>  The most effective way to advertise on the Internet is<br>  to first set up a website and publish its domain name<br>  on major search directories such as Google.com,<br>  Yahoo.com [at <a href="http://www.google.com/addurl/?......" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/addurl/?......</a> and<br>  MSN.com since 85% of Internet shoppers rely on these<br>  search directories to provide them with goods and<br>  services. In a sense, these search directories are a<br>  very large Internet Yellow Pages.<br>  <br>  Nevertheless, should your website or opening webpage<br>  fail to contain "generic" keywords, then anyone using<br>  such "generic" queries will not be able to discover<br>  your website. Your domain name [URL] of your website,<br>  in a sense, will be invisible, undiscoverable.<br>  <br>  You may want to consider some simple algorithms which,<br>  when observed and committed in designing of a website<br>  with placement of various critical metatags that can<br>  surely achieve a high search engine presence and<br>  increase Internet traffic to your website. These<br>  metatag strategies work well with published webpages<br>  at Google and Yahoo.<br>  <br>  Design: Should you create an extensive Flash-based<br>  website, make sure to fill-in the property entries<br>  such as the Title, Description and Keywords. Failing<br>  to do so, leaves no hard HTML or ALT resource that can<br>  be readily indexed by search robots. Also consider the<br>  Internet audience and their incoming setup. For<br>  example, if they are on analog/dialup, Flash webpages<br>  take too long to load up and therefore analog users<br>  will likely lose interest and discontinue entering the<br>  Flash site. On the other hand, anyone on hi-speed DSL<br>  lines, will welcome Flash pages which load quickly. So<br>  before designing a pure Flash websitge, ask the simple<br>  question, "Who's my end user - is he on dialup or<br>  DSL?" And if you had to choose between these two users<br>  for maximum marketability, then select analog users<br>  since 80% of most resident users are still analog<br>  Internet subscribers and pure HTML designed webpages<br>  is best for them.<br>  <br>  A non-Flash-based website which relies on hard text,<br>  is far easier to be indexed by search robots. Limit<br>  the use of stylized text saved as .gifs since as a<br>  graphic, they are not indexable by search robots.<br>  <br>  Avoid use of frames since any number of search robots<br>  are unable to properly classify textual material.<br>  <br>  Placement of Metatags:<br>  <br>  A ranking or search order does take place with Google<br>  and Yahoo and it begins with the "Title" metag which<br>  should consist of no more than 65 characters separated<br>  by commas. The "Title" should describe in generic<br>  terms, the goods and services, followed by a location<br>  from which the resource is located, i.e., city, state.<br>  The placement of a domain name which is not generic<br>  within the "Title" is not appropriate, unless your<br>  domain name is a major recognizable brand name.<br>  <br>  The second metatag is the "Description" which is<br>  usually 25-30 words to form a complete sentence which<br>  best describes one's goods and services.<br>  <br>  And the very last category - "Keywords" are also<br>  somewhat limited to 15-16 words which can be plural<br>  and compound in nature. Again, avoid multiple entries<br>  which could be mistaken as "spamdexed entries" which<br>  is defined as the loading, and submission of<br>  repetitive words into a particular metatag category.<br>  "Spamdexing" when discovered on a webpage and reported<br>  to Google's spamreport.com can result in the<br>  elimination of your website from their search<br>  directory.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|LUoZC3ycaa	If you want to learn SEO, each and every step from fundamentals to advanced I can highly recommend <a href="http://www.seowizz.net/," rel="nofollow">http://www.seowizz.net/,</a> I am an SEO professional and this is my blog which has (in my opinion) some of the most comprehensive SEO lessons online, so much so that it has gained 67 readers in around 2 weeks.<br>  <br>  You should check it out :) I am sure it will help.|`|GdcQdJODaa	Hello!

There are enough elements to worry about that you could spend far more time than you can afford to invest in trying to achieve the SEO you have in mind. However, search engine optimization doesn’t have to be such an onerous task that it can’t be accomplished.

With approximately 3,200 companies, it has more trading volume per hour than any other stock exchange in the world.[1]<br>  <br>  It was founded in 1971 by the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD), who divested themselves of it in a series of sales in 2000 and 2001. It is owned and operated by the NASDAQ OMX Group, the stock of which was listed on its own stock exchange in 2002, and is monitored by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). With the completed purchase of the Nordic-based operated exchange OMX, following its agreement with Borse Dubai, NASDAQ is poised to capture 67% of the controlling stake in the aforementioned exchange, thereby inching ever closer to taking over the company and creating a trans-atlantic powerhouse.[2] The group, now known as Nasdaq-OMX, controls and operates the NASDAQ stock exchange in New York City -- the second largest exchange in the United States. It also operates eight stock exchanges in Europe and holds one-third of the Dubai Stock Exchange. It has a double-listing agreement with OMX, and will compete with NYSE-Euronext group in attracting new listings.<br>  <br>  The Dow Jones Industrial Average (NYSE: DJI, also called the DJIA, Dow 30, INDP, or informally the Dow Jones or The Dow) is one of several stock market indices, created by nineteenth-century Wall Street Journal editor and Dow Jones & Company co-founder Charles Dow. It is an index that shows how certain stocks have traded.[1] Dow compiled the index to gauge the performance of the industrial sector of the American stock market. It is the second-oldest U.S. market index, after the Dow Jones Transportation Average, which Dow also created.<br>  <br>  The average is computed from the stock prices of 30 of the largest and most widely held public companies in the United States. The "industrial" portion of the name is largely historical—many of the 30 modern components have little to do with traditional heavy industry. The average is price-weighted. To compensate for the effects of stock splits and other adjustments, it is currently a scaled average, not the actual average of the prices of its component stocks—the sum of the component prices is divided by a divisor, which changes whenever one of the component stocks has a stock split or stock dividend, to generate the value of the index. Since the divisor is currently less than one, the value of the index is higher than the sum of the component prices.<br>  <br>  Standard & Poor's (S&P) is a division of McGraw-Hill that publishes financial research and analysis on stocks and bonds. It is well known for its US-based S&P 500, the Australian S&P/ASX 200 stock market index, the Canadian S&P/TSX, the Italian S&P/MIB and India's S&P CNX Nifty.

Fannie Mae & Freddie Mac are the problem.<br>  <br>  About fractional reserve banking, THAT's THE FREAKING SYSTEM.  The Federal Reserve places the following rules on the member banks:<br>  <br>  1.  Demand accounts (i.e., checking accounts).  Must be 100% backed in cash.  That's why banks don't give interest on puny checking accounts.<br>  <br>  2.  Savings accounts.  Can be backed in cash, but the requirement is roughly 10%.  So, you go into a bank and open a savings account for $1,000.  The bank holds $100 in reserve, and attempts to loan $900 at an interest rate higher than the savings account.  (In fact, it has to be higher than the savings account plus a provision for the $100 sitting in the bank doing nothing plus a provision for the bank's operating expenses.)

If you sold shares of stock at a lower price than you purchased them for, you actually did lose. It's called a realized loss and you will see it on your next quarterly statement.<br>  <br>  To answer your question, if you have a long-term view you should be more comfortable with the ups and downs of the stock market. Think about it, you have 40 years left to retire. Historical statistics show that over the preceeding 80 years, despite economic depressions and war, the stock market has marched steadily upward. If you have 40 years to go, chances are extremely good that you will live to see the market recover. However, if you have your money in bonds and short term investments, your retirement assets may not recover. <br>  <br>  Some people see now as the best time to buy. Everything is at VERY low prices. No one knows how long they will keep going down, but if you aren't in it when they go up, you will miss out. But if you aren't comfortable with the stock market, then it might be best for you to stay in bonds or money market funds.|`|xkz8Logfaa	Diversify your investments.

Banks love this.  It results in overdrafts that they can charge you for on a $10 gas purchase.  You don't think it's fair?  Neither do I.  But banks are loose cannons that can do anything they wany and we can't do anything about it.  Did you know that the banks are charging about 2%-4% on every purchase made with a credit or debit card?  That's a hell of a lot of money that we pay on top of the normal interest charged on the card itself.  I fail to see why banks are in trouble.  They can't manage their money?

Now if it was during 2007 that you split and you have been the custodial parent for the time being what you did was perfectly legal because you have established yourself as the custodial parent. Now if you mistyped and it was Nov 2008 that you split, you may want to call the IRS and ask them because with second half of the year splits it gets hairy, especially with informal arrangements.

Unfortunately, you will owe taxes to Maryland, but you should receive a refund from Oregon, you don't have to file DC taxes because you are not a DC resident . Easiest solution to a messed up situation: use the refund from Oregon to pay Maryland.

What you have to do is complete surveys and offers for companies that want the public's opinion. No payment from you is ever required, not to sign up, not EVER.<br>  <br>  The sites don't get paid directly from you, but when you complete an offer or survey, they also get paid a small portion of what you earned yourself. For example, if you complete a survey about computers let's say, you would earn maybe $2 and the web site itself would recieve $0.50 from the company also for getting you to complete the survey. These surveys take little time at all, most taking up less than even 1 or 2 minutes of your time.<br>  <br>  They don’t need any information other than your name, email address and your home address.

If no one is busy and everyone in the office knows it one or more of your jobs could easily go away to give the remaining few more work to do.  Do whatever work you have very slowly and keep it up on your desktop at all times.  You don't want to be caught slacking or it could be your job!

cca49ec109f9e5d0addc5b1ed9e0a4c7aa	Hi, Im sorry, but you're in the wrong.  I know it isn't fair.  He hasn't supported this child.  He hasn't followed the divorce decree.  The thing is the IRS doesn't care.  He has a legal document that states he gets the exemption.  That's all they will look at.  You won't get in "big" trouble though.   If he does paper filed (as he can't electronically).  they will see that the child has been claimed twice.  The IRS will then send each of you a letter stating that whichever one of you was in the wrong to amend your return.  If you don't and he sends in the court order they will tell you, you were in the wrong and have you amend it. You will have until the april deadline to payback any money that resulted from claiming that child (child tax credit/earned income credit) If you fail to pay it back before the deadline you will incur penalties and interest.  The court order is what they look at first.  It doesn't matter that you have custody/he doesn't pay child support.  It sucks I know.  sorry I know it's not what you want to hear.  No you won't get criminal charges against you or anything like that....  I suggest contacting your ex and working something out with him so he doesn't file.... easier said than done I know, and you can't guarantee that he won't claim after you've worked something out...|`|NwkZ5OmCaa	Here's the problem.  If the divorce decree merely says he can claim the child, you lose because you had already given up the right to claim the child (and the IRS will demand the money back).<br>  <br>  If the divorce decree says he could claim the child but only if he was current on child support, your husband loses because the IRS decided in 1985 that  they weren't going to play that game.  The conditional has to be in the same sentence/paragraph as the right to claim the child.  Different pages don't count.|`|AA11284831	Sorry, but you'll lose this one.  Assuming that the court order does not attach any preconditions to the exemption such as being current on support, the IRS will honor it.  If he files properly and attaches copies of the decree pages to his return, the IRS will simply deny your claim automatically.  <br>  <br>  If he doesn't attach copies to his return, the IRS will contact you both and ask for proof of your claims.  When he sends them copies of the decree to the IRS, he will win.<br>  <br>  If there is unpaid child support, you'll eventually win however as his refund, if he's getting one, will be captured and sent to you.  But you'll have to play this one out according to the rules.|`|ro5vFj9Aaa	hes got paper showing who gets what and you have messed up if that is what you got you knw what you hve done and you'd best give it to him or he can get you. but if he goes to court you can get a free lawyer proably and then it will cost him but he could also have you pay for his lawyer to. so what hes ot paid in 8 years that means nothing you are still going to be against the court order and you will be in big trouble. you need to speak to lawye rin your state and see what type of things you hvae but maybe not good.

Ch9TedMcaa	Possible, yes.<br>  <br>  Advisable? No.|`|D19F6m92aa	It is too risky.  Years ago, before the internet, it was possible.  But today, too much information is available to too many people.

In general it's very risky; however, there are ways to bring the probabilities into your favor.  I used to day trade, but now I prefer swing trading.  In addition to this, I prefer to focus on identifying higher probability trades, using credit option spreads or options and careful money management to hedge the risk.  This approach is more conservative and can yield roughly 20-30%; however, a friend of mine who was an x-options trader at Fidelty uses a similar approach, but is much more aggressive and does a lot better than this.<br>  <br>  Thus, if you are a beginner, most will lose money.

h4V5VyRHaa	Although most people will jump at telling you to pay off your credit card first, it all depends on your financial situation.   Generally credit cards charge a much higher interest rate than car loans, and if this is true in your case and those are your only options, you should pay off the credit card.    However, there are many other options you may not have thought about.    1.) If your car payment is high and strapping you each month it might be better for you to have that big payment out of the way.  You also may be forced to carry full auto insurance (Comprehensive/ Collision) on your vehicle which is high, and when you own your vehicle you could choose to carry only liability insurance which could be less than half the price, and depending on the value of your vehicle and size of your deductible, this may be a good idea.    2.) Depending on your credit situation, you may be able to open a new credit account with a 0% APR on transferred balances.  This would be the best option, where you could pay your car off and have a low monthly interest charge on your credit payments.    3.)  If you are in the market for a new home, not having a car payment will greatly increase the amount of home loan you could qualify for.    It is best to research all available options before making one big move or another.  Sometimes when you think there are only two solutions to a problem the third choice can be best.|`|AjFA8qIxaa	Both. Credit cards are how you build your credit. Meaning you buy something and pay the whole amount when the bill comes. Then you buy something bigger and pay it again, then something more expensive and so on. That's how you build good credit for yourself. Don't ever pay the minimum on a credit card.  If i were you i would split the money and pay half on both of them. But if you want, check out you credit rate, it might be also a good idea to pay off the one that has a higher rate, this way you safe money in the end. I guess it depends what you are striving for. Do you have outstanding credit and your car credit rate is higher? Go pay off the car.  Do you have okay credit and the credit card rate is higher ( or only slightly lower ) then pay off the credit card.  Otherwise, split the money.  Hope this helps you!|`|0u6qy9Uuaa	credit card probably has a higher int rate and is therefore costing you more money|`|ZA11WBR2aa	Pay off the credit card first, they charge much higher interest rate.|`|HmiFGACXaa	Which ever has the highest interest rate|`|oojO4WAraa	Which ever has the highest interest rate should be paid off first.|`|bdc0c1d1aead267282553512169a9932aa	the credit card|`|zwJbUbWMaa	Pay off the one with the higher interest rate.|`|fyKydb6Iaa	Pay off the highest interest  rate first|`|iuY0sIL9aa	What is the interest rate of the two?

Much smarter.    Car loans tend to have much less interest on them than credit cards. If you have an equal charge on each, and the credit card is charging 10% interest but the car is only charging 5% interest, then paying off the credit card means that in the future you will only be paying an additional 5% per month (on the car, which you didn't pay off). Paying off the car would mean that you'd pay an additional 10% per month, which is just twice as much.|`|EiiVMtjyaa	Dear Friend,    It would be the wiser if you paid off the credit card first ...seeing that the "interest" will "hurt your feelings" a lot more than the car payment.

I guess one way to decide is to figure out which debt will cost you more extra money in interest by not paying it off.  The one that will cost you more to NOT pay off is the one you should pay off.  There may be other factors for you, however.|`|56f1fd3d7a65a9c7d7ff2c37ebbb1872aa	PS- I assume you have the same interest rate on both--because it is obvious which one you should pay if one is higher.  Credit card companies can change the rules on you in a second--especially now with the economy the way it is.  Car loans have a lot more stability on their terms.  I would pay off the credit card!!!  At least you know your car loan won't shoot up the interest rate.

49740c9daeea677fc86801fb2b3f41deaa	Yes, they are no different.    You need a down payment.    A minimum of 3% if you can get an FHA.   Many foreclosed homes will not pass the FHA inspection though.    It is usually noted in the MLS if the house will qualify for FHA.    If you only can make the 3% tell your agent to simply not show you anything you will not be able to buy.    The standard down payment is still 20% though, that has not changed.    The only first time buyer deal right now is the 7500 tax credit, which is really an interest free loan.    I really do not think they are all that risky.   Just use an honest and seasoned agent (like at least 20 years of sales), they will know a good one or a bad one and will behonest with you.

I happened to buy a foreclosed home, so I can help you out!    Yes, you can take out a mortgage on foreclosed properties, BUT not all.  The house has to be able to get financed, able to pass inspections.  They don't want you buying a house that you can't afford the mortgage because you are dumping TONS of money into it to make it safe to live in.      A couple of things that will keep a house from being able to be financed are:    -needs new roof  -copper piping was stripped  -no kitchen cabinets (they won't finance a house without a kitchen, and cabinets makes it so there is "no kitchen")  -same with no kitchen sink  -electrical problems  -no bathroom(sink, shower or toilet missing)  -no railing on steps with 4 or more steps  -and a NUMBER of other things    These are the things that seperate "normal" houses from foreclosures.    A MAJOR problem with foreclosed homes are that they are abandoned and people steal the copper piping because it is worth money.    There ARE NO MONEY DOWN mortgages (downpayment assistance mortgages), but the interest rate is higher.  FHA is deff. the best mortgage to get when buying your first home.  I got a 3% down payment which is super easy to come up with when buying a foreclosed home.  My interest rate was only 5%!  Also if you do the 3% to no down payment mortgage there is a mortgage insurance that will be added to the mortgage payments.  This won't be added forever, just until you are down to 80% of the mortgage is left.  And it's not that much, mine was like $50 a month.  They do this to make sure you aren't going to get foreclosed on youself.     The closing costs are what got me.  The closing on my home was $10,000 including a $3500 down payment.  They make you pay your first years worth of insurance before the closing, the first years taxes and "rent".  Instead of charging you a whole months mortgage, they charge you a certain amount per day that's left of the month.    The mortgage itself won't just be the house payments, it will also include taxes, insurance and mortgage insurance.    My house payment itself was only a little over $600 a month, but with everything added on it was $1050 which is still less than a lot of people pay for rent.    If you have any more questions feel free to write to me.  Good luck and right now IS the best time to buy!    ****Also the biggest perk to buying your first home is the First Home Buyers Tax Credit.  It only goes from July 2008-July 1, 2009 though, so hurry!  This is NOT free money however.  They will give you $7,500 back in your taxes for buying your first home, but you have to pay it back.  It is INTEREST free and they give you 15 years to pay it back through your taxes.  I think it's great because when you first get a home there are things that you would like to do, but can't afford right away, this makes it possible.  Also you didn't have to buy the home in 2008 to get the money this year.  Just buy it before you send in your taxes and you can claim it as if you bought it last year! GREAT!          ******OK, sorry I didn't look back.  No there was only a 3% down payment.  The downpayment is paid at the closing, so I put it in as a part of my "closing" costs.  The rent isn't a years worth, it is for the rest of the month.  Like I bought my house on January 7th, 2009.  Instead of them making me pay a whole months worth of mortgage (because I wasn't there a full month), they make you pay a portion (almost like "rent" for the rest of the month) at the closing.  Does that help?      You have to have insurance before they will let you close.  They make you pay a full year's worth (mine was only $700 to insure my house for double what it's worth).  They make you pay that so that you are always a year ahead.  I can't stress enough, make sure you shop around for Insurance qutotes!    Also remember to put in an offer you have to have a "deposit" the average is about $1000 for a deposit.  If they don't accept your offer, than you get your deposit back, if they do, they take the deposit and put it towards your down payment.  Let's say the down payment was $3500 and you give a $1000 deposit than you only owe $2500 of downpayment at the closing.|`|470dc9e84094d2130c1ec379a4271d28aa	While I don't have all the answers, you should try to find a loan officer and they will. I do know that foreclosures usually require more earnest money that has to be put down and if you go that route, get one heck of an inspection done!|`|8quTABk6aa	Do you know how RISKY it is to buy.....just kidding.    Sure, I think you can take out a loan on it.  In this case, the bank owns the property.  It may be in your best interest to find out which bank owns it and deal with them directly; you could probably get a good rate.  The bank certainly doesn't want to sit on a bunch of foreclosed properties.

ZdlRGYZXaa	Greetings ! <br>  The Great News is . Obama has signed into the stim package an 8k dollars  First time homebuyers cash credit to homeownership  in 2009 .. so Good Luck with that Great little treat . Take advantage of it , cuz your paying for it .<br>  Now , as for credit . <br>  From my loan officer days & underwriting experience, i recomend  you<br>  Pull a tri-merge credit report from any online company that you feel comfortable with . It may cost you as much as 70.00 dollars . <br>  A Tri-merge report pulls every little pc of dirt on you from all 3 mayor credit beurows.<br>  This will help you review and make corrections and show proof that things are paid so your report could be properly undated. It’s unrealistic to think things just fall of reports once paid. You actually have to push and pull to get things corrected on your credit report, but by law they have 30 days to make corrections if need be.<br>  Once you start fixing your report you must send a copy of facts to all 3 credit agencies and follow up with them 10 days later to confirm the corrections have been made. <br>  Wait a few months and pull another report .just to make sure everything’s looking right. <br>  Then Hold off on pulling anymore reports for as long as you can. Don’t let every loan officer pull credit for this lowers your score every time.<br>  This process can be done and may take as long as 4 months to accomplish. <br>  Maybe we will get lucky and Obama will abolish the current credit beurows, giving us all a clean slate. Now that would be sweet ..<br>  Good Luck.|`|2rkyKUFHaa	A quiick way to build some credit would be to get a few small credit cards and use them to purchase small things and pay them off in full ever month.

Every time you open/close a credit card you effect your credit score.  Keep one major credit card and either don't use it or pay off the balance in full each month. <br>  If you've paid off all outstanding debt your score should start to go up during the year as long as all of your bills are also paid.<br>  Just because your husband doesn't have a "credit history" does not mean that he doesn't have a payment history. Rent payments, bill payments and work history can also play a part in determining creditworthiness.<br>  Check out: suzeorman.com<br>  Get a copy of your credit report quarterly from annualcreditreport.com. Make certain there are no errors. If you find any mistakes contact the credit reporting agency at once.<br>  <br>  With a better credit score you'll receive a better interest rate from the bank. That equals savings for you over time.|`|Au2aI9a2aa	Try a FHA lender they have 3% down payments and you do not need a real high credit score.

He need to start now to build one different and distinct from yours.  Have him open a checking account, with out your name or social security number on it.

His credit score, will recover faster than yours.<br>  <br>  On the house, my mother in law purchased the house (she had a 800 score).

f9a39482114c5f9844fc5040ac337bd4aa	a. is not generally accepted as a basis for estimating bad debts<br>  because it violates the matching principle.<br>  <br>  The Internal Revenue Service permits companies to take a tax deduction for bad debts only after specific uncollectible accounts have been identified. Unless a company's uncollectible accounts represent an insignificant percentage of their sales, however, they may not use the direct write-off method for financial reporting purposes. Since several months may pass between the time that a sale occurs and the time that a company realizes that a customer's account is uncollectible, the matching principle, which requires that revenues and related expenses be matched in the same accounting period, would often be violated if the direct write-off method were used. Therefore, most companies use the direct write-off method on their tax returns but use the allowance method on financial statements.|`|wtQY6VEwaa	direct write off means when you actually know a bad debt is bad, that when you write it off.<br>  <br>  So, personally, i think the answers are very poorly written.

SN5dYkafaa	Assets you own jointly - as JTWROS - avoid probate at your death, and automatically become the property of the surviving co-owner by "operation of law." Your Will is disregarded. Your interests in a TIC account pass to the beneficiaries in your WIll and, accordingly, are probate assets. If you have no will, your interests in a TIC account will pass to your heirs in accordance with your state's intestacy statutes. If avoiding probate is an objective, TIC doesn't work.    If you'd like to maintain complete and sole control over the account, and avoid probate at your death, set up a Transfer on Death (TOD) account at the brokerage firm. Last time I checked, TOD registrations are available in 49 states; all but Louisiana. If your online trading company doesn't recognize TOD registrations, consider finding a different one. The registration would look something like this:    (Owner's name) TOD (name of beneficiary, or multiple beneficiaries)    PS - regardless of the way you title your accounts, don't forget to execute Durable Powers of Attorney - one for each of you - to handle your financial affairs in the event of incapacitation.

Mainstream finance companies, especially in this economic climate, are going to run from that ratio.  You're maxed.    You haven't mentioned if the $900 is your portion or the total mortgage.  If it is the total mortgage and the mortgage is in your name, you could try to declare the other person's portion as income to give you some breathing room.  If it is a spouse paying the other half, tell them that.  15% from a high risk company with that debt ratio, to me, means your score is solid...

Beginning with your one year old the only way your job would have been protected for a minimum of 12 weeks would be under the Family Medical Leave Act and to be eligible you must have worked at your place of employment for a minimum of 1 year &1,250 hours worked.  Also the company must have at minimum 50 employees.  If this doesn't apply to you I am very sorry, but you have no legal grounds.

You can always file a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission on the grounds of discrimination, but honestly I really do not believe you have a case even with such an asinine remark.|`|GHraE6Teaa	You were not laid off.  You were terminated for absenteeism and lateness.  If they had actually fired you for failure to show up to work when delivering your baby or taking maternity leave you would have a case for discrimination but they didn't and you don't.      While some employers may have been more sympathetic, the bottom line is that your former employers have a reasonable expectation that their employees show up for work and show up on time.    File for unemployment benefits if you otherwise meet the requirements in your state.  Perhaps your employers will not claim you are ineligible.    Edit:    Just to clarify something Shane mentioned, the 1,250 hours must have been within the preceding 12 months, not over the entire term of your employment.

7ab5cfb44c01bb054a6a928a94becb65aa	You look for cash flow.  Simple right?  :)    As a ROUGH rule of thumb, I look for a property that'll bring in about 1% of the purchase price a month in rent.    Lets say you find a 4 plex for $200k and it brings in $500 unit.  That would fit into that 'rule'.    At 1% of purchase price in income each month, that should cover your mortgage, expenses (common area lights, trash, water), taxes, insurance, etc.    If you can find something that brings in more -- great.  But 1% should be minimum.  The only time I buy something where the rents are less is if it's in a good area and I'm being helped by appreation.    I have some four plexes that bring in $600/month per unit (a bit more actually as they pay $150/week) that I was thinking of selling for ~$200k.  They have managment setup already and everything is done and managed online (so I can check status any time)    If interested, let me know  (PS:  I'm not a very motivated seller so I'm not going to low ball sell these as they bring in pretty good money for me :-).|`|0u6qy9Uuaa	well, the rent income needs to cover your mortgage, property taxes, insurance, utilities, maintenance and some extra to save up for major things like new roof and profit.    also - if the building has a history of being less than 100% occupied at all times, then I would avoid it - might not make enough to cover all your costs    make you you get complete inspections on any building you plan to buy - you don't want any surprises - talk to the tenants if possibly about any unaddressed problems|`|TpMvr1pyaa	depending on where you buy, a pre-bubble cap rate that was  average was 4-8, outside of Calif.

I am amazed that your buyer's agent did not state that verbally  to you when you hired him.    He should be reprimanded.    [also, if you do not sign an AGENCY agreement, you did not  have a buyer's agent!!!!]|`|yHl7RIuOaa	No you are not legally required to use that first agent.  Note they are not a buyer's agent unless they signed a contract with you. This is rather poor business ethics to take advantage of their time this way and then not reward them with the contract.  You should never have asked them to show you property. But lets assume you have good upstanding reasons.    If you elect to use another agent make sure the other agent knows you have seen the property before with the first agent.  They will know what to do so that dispute over commission is avoided. In all likelihood that 2nd agent will ask that he/she physically show you the property again.  He/she may need to argue in front of a judge why they eanred the commission instead of the first agent. And if they never showed you property that possibly could be an issue.    If you are buying a FSBO then they have no legal leg to stand on.
7ab5cfb44c01bb054a6a928a94becb65aa	Yes, if your business fails you're still liable for the lease.    And re: an LLC...

Just like if you rented a house and lost your job...  you're still liable to make those payments as you have a contract (legal and moral) to do so.|`|EXJfoGtAaa	The commercial market in many areas is like the residential market.  You shuold be able to negotiate a favorable lease.  If you can't, yes form a corporation or LLC to limit your liabilities.  Read your lease carefully.

Do not sign the 3 year lease. That was "the norm" when business was booming and the future looked bright. It is important that you rent month-to-month, even if you have to pay a premium to do so. If the landlord fights you, it might be smart to walk away.  The LLC protects you from getting sued, but only if the landlord does not ask for a personal guarantee (and they will ask for one). SO just keep it sole proprietorship for now..|`|qBCGH52haa	Talk to a lawyer to figure out which is the best method for protecting your personal assets (LLC, S-Corp, whatever), but if you sign as a sole proprietor, you will most likely be personally on the hook for the entire three years|`|ARAYm7BLaa	The bailliffs will come in so you wont have to pay...dont worry|`|8063947433f50c3e93546a4ba2133fdcaa	Yes, you probably will. You could do a couple of things in that situation- find a subtenant to take over the lease, or find someone to buy out the business and then it will be their problem. most landlords are wary of this too. they want to see creditworthiness, financial statements, financing from the bank, etc.|`|62a9fbfdcb48013f6dddecd39855b6a2aa	In short......... yes - make sure you go through all details with a fine tooth comb.

lp1LDMAYaa	Depending on which student credit card you apply for the rates start at 14.99% and up. And they offer CC's to full-time an part-time students. There is no annual fee, and even though the rate is higher than some other cards...you can use it to build up your credit profile if you haven't really established credit.  If they're rates are too high, than you may try Citibank, that's who i got my first student credit card from.        As for tips...don't charge more than you can afford and pay it off at the end of the month.  In my opinion, credit cards aren't bad, you just have to live within your means and should you be fine.  Using common sense, having discipline, and delaying instant gratificaiton will help and prevent financial turmoil.     Hope this helps.

meK0ziCJaa	From what I've read, student loan debt is considered "good" debt. If you pay on time, the history on the loan will have a positive effect on your credit score. Also, the interest on the student loan is far lower than on any other kind of loan. If I had the extra money each month, I would put it into an emergency savings account. Once you establish and reach your savings goal, then I would put any extra money towards student loan debt.|`|y4SUDnpaaa	I would continue to pay on the student loan. I would put the rest in savings until I had accumulated enough for a CD. You can shop around for the best rate. It may not earn an interest rate as some investments but it's not subject to being lost. Before I bought the CD I would set aside some of the money for unexpected emergencies, like car repairs, dental bills etc. I believe 6 months is the norm for getting you through a  crisis, like a job loss . It really doesn't matter, you're better off if you don't have a set date but just keep saving. You can't have too much.|`|qsLhVZd8aa	The first thing you need to do is establish at least an eight month emergency fund.  Once that is set up, start investing!  Right now is a good time to invest in the stock market as everything is pretty much "on sale" right now.  Go to T. Rowe Price - they've never let me down with their advice.|`|mwkfirjRaa	There are two approaches you can take, depending on how secure your job is and whether you want to have those student loans hanging over your head forever.  It might be "good debt" in the sense that it financed an appreciating asset (i.e., your education) but it's not all that great now!    Establish an emergency fund of at least $1,000, keep this money available (out of the stock market) and pay everything else against the debt.  If you lose your job, you'll have $1,300 less in expenses each month.    Or, continue paying what you are now on the student loan debt and take any extra funds and put these in a Roth IRA.  You can contribute up to $5,000 each year at your age, unless you exceed the annual income limit, which is just over $100,000.  Because you are contributing to your Roth IRA with post-tax dollars, you can withdraw those contributions at any time without paying taxes or penalties.  Therefore, the Roth IRA can double as your emergency account, and if you don't have an emergency, you're way ahead in terms of saving for your retirement.    Your contributions into your 401k and Roth IRA should be the money you choose to invest in stocks, in the form of broad market low-cost, no load mutual index funds.  Money you don't need for 40 or 50 years is what you want in the market.  Check out Vanguard for more information.

XdGjhbfMaa	As far as finding one, it's easy as long you meet the income requirements for the one you choose to apply for.<br>  <br>  As far as being financially stable...  Create a budget and strictly stick to it for the first couple of months until you get familiar with what your expenses will average each month.  It's easy to estimate rent, cable, and such but often we leave out the other essentials that don't just pop in the head when thinking about expenses, like toilet paper.|`|4fe4fa0093052951c5515ef2f32cefffaa	Getting an apartment is easy.  You apply, pay a deposit, sign papers, and you have the unit.<br>  <br>  But...  Are you sure you can afford it?  In addition to rent, you'll need to pay for water, electricity, cable (if you get one), telephone, etc, etc, etc.  You'll need to pay for furniture too.<br>  <br>  With only 1000 dollars in bank, can you pull it off?  What happens if one of you lose job?  <br>  <br>  My suggestion to you is to save up little more before you make this jump.  With your current saving, you can easily go from barely making it to can't make it.  When this happens, you have no choice but to lose everything.<br>  <br>  You don't want that.|`|6zzwFVTaaa	It is easy enough; the people renting them out will tell you if you qualify<br>  but make sure you have some money left to pay the rent if you fall on hard times or you'll be out on the street!

zNPP0TdVaa	Ok.  Go to SCHOOL.  Keep working at Big Lots.  Look for another job, that you think will be fun for you while you are in SCHOOL.  Maybe you could work at starbucks or something with some other kids so you can socialize a little at work.  Im sure Big Lots blows.  Look around at the "old people" who work at Big Lots.  Aren't their lives a little sad?  Alot of shattered expectations and unrealized potential in a place like that.  Anyway, you have to go to SCHOOL most importantly.  Not necessarily college.  You can become a paralegal in about 18 months.  You can then work at a law firm or many corporations employ paralegals in addition to attorneys.  You could expect to earn 50,000 in your first year.  Better than easy is a job that is mentally challenging and financially rewarding.  SCHOOL is the KEY.  Im not sure if you are a guy or a girl but you also might be interested in working with your hands.  Again SCHOOL will be beneficial.  Mechanical programs at "tech" schools are short.  2 years or so.  From this foundation you can do many things.  I know a kid 26 years old that makes 98,000 a year working on elevators for OTIS elevator company.  Not construction, just maintenance.  So just pick something that you think you can live with.  You don't have to love it, or even really like it.  The important thing is that the career will provide enough financial freedom so that you may pursue whatever your passion may be,as a hobby.  Having that freedom to pursue side projects often allows other opportunities to materialize.|`|QaJGkXp2aa	Hate to be blunt, but if you're looking for easy, then you're not likely to ever break from the work-hard-for-a-living-in-a-job-you-don'... paradigm. Nothing truly worth having in life comes easy.<br>  <br>  You can become a grumpy old man in a tollbooth or you can put in some sweat now, learn some skills, and do something more challenging and thus rewarding. Use your imagination. Learn a craft or get an education because if you don't, you'll blink and find yourself that old man bagging groceries.<br>  <br>  Only you can take some initiative and do it. Don't make excuses. There are internships and there's financial aid for education. It'll be tough in the short term, but very rewarding in the long term. But if you want to break out of the "just working" thing, you're going to have to act.

ug00j0S8aa	I work as a volunteer in a car donation program.  If the value is under $500, we don't even have to notify the IRS.  All you need is the receipt for the donation and you should claim the private party sale value.<br>  <br>  If the value is greater than $500, we have to tell you what we did with the car.  If we sold it, we tell you how much, and that is your deduction.  If we were to keep it for our own use (we don't, but some groups might) or we give it to a low-income individual (we do this with about 80% of our cars), you get to deduct the private party sale value.<br>  <br>  We do not tell you what that value is.  That is your responsibility.|`|24kFbAdsaa	You have to donate it to a legal charitable organization.<br>  <br>  They must sell the car.  At that time, they will mail you a receipt indicating what they sold the car for.  If they don't sell the car, you can't claim the deduction.  I don't know how it would be handled if they kept the car and used it in their organization.  You may then be able to use the blue book value.<br>  <br>  It is that amount that you may claim as a charitable contribution.  Not any of the amounts listed in any of the blue books.|`|bVHnNqzBaa	For vehicle donations, IRS rules require the charity to give you a receipt for the amount that was donated to the charity. You cannot deduct anything without that receipt.|`|fSlZQzS4aa	You can deduct what the charity sells it for.  If you say the car is worth less than $500, you don't get told what it sold for. I donated a car that was good for parts and claimed a deduction of $200 and was not questioned.

The shipping costs are not considered when calculating what you owe.|`|3vwBR9udaa	The final value fee is only based on the value of the item, and not the fees.  You still have to pay the initial listing fee of .35 on items up to 9.99 I think, or 14.99.  They have tiers based on the starting price.  You have to pay that price even if you start it at  .01 but then have a reserve of 15.00, you pay fees on the price of the reserve.<br>  <br>     The best way that I have found to get the most for them, is to use www.auctiva.com.  It's an approved vendor for ebay, but you can list 24 pictures, schedule your listings, create templates, and it is all for free!<br>  <br>     That is the best way that I have found.  Good luck!
l1VZkkOSaa	a. $200 decrease in net income.<br>  <br>  The expiration of part of the prepaid insurance is an expense and causes it to be moved from the balance sheet (asset account) to the income statement (expense account) - which has the net effect of reducing net income by that amount. The adjusting entry was/is:<br>  <br>  Debit 'Insurance Expense' $200<br>  Credit 'Prepaid Insurance' $200
ZXE0gCVCaa	Total Revenue $125 000 - Total Expenses $60 000 = $65 000<br>  A net profit increases capital, so add $65 000 to $80 000 = $145 000<br>  Then decrease $145 000 by the drawings $15 000 = $130 000<br>  Option C.

v4vQSzu4aa	It sounds to me like you're already on the "right track" according to what you've said.  You are picky about who your best friends are because they are special and rare, so being choosy is a great thing.  As for the people who are two faced, F them (forget them)........you are obviously NOT a nobody because you already have 3 true friends and have the class and awareness of the drama of superficial relationships, you are so far ahead of your peers, you don't even recognize it and that's ok at your age.  Being true to your own self, being  "just you" with everybody will bring more quality people in your life. Popular people sometimes focus on just that, (being cool, dressing a certain way, following the crowd into stupid adventures and opinions (so shallow and worthless))  you seem to want more depth in friendships and you are on your way. Being cool is not "whats in", being yourself.......is!  8th grade is NOT easy, what so ever and High School doesn't get much easier in these areas, but from your question, I read that you are already intellectually and mentally above your classmates, maybe YOU will teach them a thing or two about being a good friend and if not, you will have true friends on your side that may last a life time.  May you be blessed with Spirit, love and compassion for those who have not caught up with YOU!|`|SRzL2Wexaa	Well girl, you need to post this under family and relationships, then maybe singles and dating.  I don't think you'll get as many answers in the business section.  <br>  <br>  IMO, you probably are a cool person, and shouldn't worry about people when they're in bad moods.  Don't let their bad moods make you feel bad about yourself.  When they say nasty things to you, tell them thanks, I love you too.  Then ask for a hug.  That usually shuts them up.|`|IDRgZQKDaa	I was "popular" in 8th grade. I hope you realize that as you go on, especially later on in high school, there really isn't popularity in the sense that you are describing.

People don't like fakes. Maybe learn to use slightly better grammar as well.

Im gonna say with confidence that since I hit the big 50 I have wisdom to share with you.

Dont let the leader of the clique make you hate someone because she does not think that person is cool. Never ever talk about or tease geeks or fat people. They have feelings and go home crying. Always say hi to all and never take sides. And last but not least join all the school clubs and sports teams so everybody knows you. Good Luck..
fNoDk12caa	Yes it's possible that the cheque can be withdrawn by another person. You should always mention (on the top) on the cheque Payee's A/C, which means the cheque will be credited into the account of the person you have mentioned on the cheque, if you have not mentioned it  can be withdrawn by another person too. If the person you gave the cheque has deposited the cheque into his account and obtained a receipt from the teller than there is nothing to worry it will be credited to his account only. It takes 2-3 days to transfer the amount from one account to another so it's possible that the money has been withdrawn from your account but has not been credited into other account yet (as it may take 2-3 days).|`|vVTmJjJDaa	yes - by forging the signature of the person it was payable to, then making it payable to themselves on the reverse of the check, then signing their own signature on it, and then cashing it or depositing it into their own account - in which is highly illegal.<br>  <br>  btw, it's also possible that the person who you wrote the check to cashed it themselves and isn't telling you the truth - or, that a family member forged their signature and then cashed it via a joint account.|`|bVHnNqzBaa	That would be fraud and you should contact your bank ASAP, starting first with their 24-hour phone number, and follow it up in person at the branch.
4d3Ie5lCaa	Okay, so are you saying that if I owned a let's say a bookstore, and the name of it is "Always Cheap Books" you can get "Always Cheap Books" on the first page when I type "Always Cheap Books" on google? or are you saying that if I typed "cheap books" my business will be in the first page? In other words what am saying is that if you can a business in the first page for keywords that matter then I would charge $900. On the other hand if you could get my business in the first page for its name or make it the first link then I wouldn't pay anything since that's easy to do.

AA10305589	hourly means you get paid by the hour.  An hourly position can be regular, seasonal or part time.<br>  <br>  seasonal means a hourly position hired based on seasonal requirements (i.e. shops need more workers near the christmas holidays, resorts need more workers during peak travel periods, etc.)<br>  <br>  part-time can be hourly or salaried position that incurs under 35-40 hours a week.
2NhvZ6HRaa	Without knowing your financial circumstances I can't give you "a for sure answer"  However<br>  with a 620 score you should qualify.  The reason a trade isn't working is because the trad-in isn't worth enough to cover the value of the car you are purchasing, which would make you upside down anyway on the new car.<br>  <br>  Best thing to do is "suck it up"  Sell the car for as much as you can.  You will still owe the balance over and above the sale.  You can then ask the creditor to accept payments perhaps at a lower interest rate. This will save your credit score.<br>  <br>  Be sure to call your creditor before you do this.  Tell them you want to know if they will finance the difference after the sale.|`|h5wiXy5iaa	look at this one <a href="http://creditcardpay.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://creditcardpay.blogspot.com</a>|`|ysIVk3t9aa	Its not that you don't qualify because of your score, it's because you have too much negative equity a bank will not loan $8300 more than what a vehicle your trying to buy is worth. Because when you go to obtain a new loan and they have to roll over 8300 to a new loan highly doubt thats going to happen so pretty much you just need to focus on paying down that negative equity asap.
YYCjoqMvaa	I had the same problem a while ago. I found that it is easiest to get volunteer work done, then include that in your job history. Employers are hesitant to hire someone that has done absolutely no work in their past. Also, you need to follow up on your job applications. Call the places after you send in applications. I found both of the jobs that I have previously had on snagajob.com.

Learn calligraphy so that you can provide handwritten invitations and thank you notes to prospective wedding parties, birthday celebrations, etc. Seek out clients through wedding planners at nearby churches and temples. A starter calligraphy kit usually runs around $20 and anyone can easily pick up this skill. The going rate is usually $1 per hand addressed item.<br>  <br>  2. Seek from your neighbors a gardner position which involves planting, weed removal, plant/tree trimming, light brush clearance. You will be using the neighbor's equipment and tools. Again, do not represent yourself as a lawn mower since there are any number of safety issues involved. A door-to-door solicitation of surrounding neighbors is required and you can charge between $6 to $9 per hour.<br>  <br>  3. Offer policing/removal or clearance of trash services to surrounding neighbors which involve trash pickup within nearby residential area. Limit the extent of pickup to small areas and be aware that there are no hazardous terrain or elements involved in this process. Again, a door-to-door solicitation of neighbors is in order. You can charge between $6.75 to $7.50 per hour.<br>  <br>  4. Acquire a set of window cleaning tools [a bucket, liquid window cleaner, sponge, squeegee, handle with an extension and a small step ladder] and solicit local businesses for your window cleaning services. However, be careful to limit the height of the window cleaning to no higher than one story. Charge $1 per window panel.<br>  <br>  5. Visit your nearest beauty salon and ask to be trained as a shampoo person who is also willing to sweep up fallen hair on the ground and do set ups [arranging dye kits, curler holders, etc.] for a set hourly fee.<br>  <br>  6. Become a sign flipper by contacting your nearest realtor. A flipper is someone who stands at a major intersection and flips a "For Lease/Rental" sign in order to attract visitors to an open house or to a particular real estate listing. The hourly pay is at least the minimum wage.<br>  <br>  7. Why not become a paid feeder servicing the disabled at nearby nursing, convalescent, assisted living/care centers and hospitals. It involves feeding food to patients who are unable to feed themselves. The starting rate is $8.00 per hour. The only downside is that one has to take precautions to wash one's hands after each feeding. A posting of your services [by a business card or flyer] on a reviewable bulletin board would be enough to generate customers. The paid feeder position is one of the fastest growing occupation at this time.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|VZSNSzsLaa	There are a lot of potential problems for youngsters in work, many of them law-related, parents are required to be vigilant about that.

XdGjhbfMaa	You do have to give the amount of days notice that Oregon requires (which is probably 30) to the roommate that is on the lease.  Just as that roommate can't legally evict you with less than thirty days notice, you can't leave without repercussions on short notice.<br>  <br>  As far as the deposit, if the landlord has it he won't give it up until the lease is over.  You'll have to get that back from the remaining roommate, as they'll be the one who gets the entire deposit back upon them moving out.<br>  <br>  You cannot use the deposit as rent as it's purpose is to cover any damages and such, which is determined once the lease expires.  If there are no damages, it's returned in full after the lease is up.|`|iXgZHsXsaa	If you are not sign anything on the agreement I dont think you need to give a notice. Even you did sigfn a check to pay monthly rental or security deposit. the one you sign a rental agreement will have full responsiblity to take care the rental and security deposit unless therr of youguys have another agreement among three to rent and stay in the same apartment.<br>  You could not use the deposit to pay for the last month rent ..that alot of people did but it will not legal as the agreement saying.<br>  good luck!|`|wPNtVytKaa	No, you are not legally bound to give 30 days notice, but you are also can't really demand  your deposit back.<br>  If the security deposit was given to the actual landlord, they will NOT be able to get this money until THEY (the signed tenants) move out, so that won't help them at all.  But, you would have a hard time getting it back until they moved out, so there you go.  If the other real tenants retained your deposit, they should have no problem taking that for your 30 days "bye bye" money.<br>  If you never signed a paper, I doubt you have any dealing or can approach the land lord for anything.  your dealings would be strictly with the signed tennants.
