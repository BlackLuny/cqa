What do i do? apple will not do anything anymore and i'm tired of not having an ipod. i need help someone! please.

When you tap them they go to the first screen they would go to when you click it, but for only 2 SECONDS!

But now it started doing it again for ALL my app's except the ones already on the itouch when you get it. I don't have internet to retry this solution. Plus i believe it could do this over and over until it drives me insane.

I remember reading that graphics engine for the ps3 was based on one of geforce's 7 series cards. So the 8 series and the Gtx 2 families should perform a kickass show ryte?       i overheard some people saying how the ps3 graphics were way better than the one's on the pc. I dismayed their sayings but i read on a Red alert 3 articles that the creators launched a ps3 version and that the graphics for it were alot better than the version for the pc and that got me thinking...why? With cards such s the ATI 4870s, 4870x2s, Gtx 260,core 216,280,285,295 etc shouldnt the pc version outclass the ps3?      This has been bugging me for a whil.

20080707084327AArqej4	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;Xbox	Whats wrong with my Xbox 360?!!!?! Please Help!!?	This has happened to me 3 times since I bought it 2 months ago. This never happened to the previous owner.       It happened on two differnet games, twice on Star Wars Battlefrotn 2, and once on Need For Speed Carbon.       What happens is suddenly in the middle of gameplay the screen goes black except for like 3 lines of white text saying that the disc is unreadable and may be scratched or smudged. The only way to get rid of the error is to turn console off (manually by button). It works fine afterwards and before. Theres no telling when it would happen.       Would a disc cleaner (like a lens cleaner I mean) help? Like could the lens be dirty? If so how would I clean it?       Also is this a pre-warning to the RROD? I heard it is.       Also since I'm second owner (I have recipt and everything from the origonal owner) does that mean that if I do get the RROD am I screwed and it won't be valid warranty?       Should I just try to sell it asap before i get RROD if that could happen? Help please! Thanks!

I heard some girls chatting about their 18month contract and that they can update to a newer phone [or any phone of their choice for that matter] within 8/6 months of the contract finishing.    I'm also on an 18 month contract paying ￡35 a month. I was wondering if this normally applies to all contracts/phone companies? I am with T-mobile, the girls never mentioned who they were with.      Also when my contract comes to an end, will I have to send my phone back to T-mobile, or do I get to keep it?

20070711233900AAIMFRk	Consumer Electronics;TVs	Broken tv, power surge?	I have a 7 year old Mitubishi HDTV and a 15 year old sony tv.  earlier in the year the sony all of a sudden started cutting off the far right and left sides to any picture.  I later started using a mitusbishi HDTV and for a few months it worked great and then one day the power turned on but there was no picture.  I started using the old sony tv for about a weak and right in the middle of watching something, some sort of special effects looking thing happened and now I only get a vertical line of color from my tv.  How is it possible for 2 tv's to essentially have the same problem within a week of each other.  they are both downstairs but plugged into different surge protectors.  after about a week, the Mitsubishi can actually show a picture but the picture is still very screwed up.  the sony tv still has a vertical line of bright white and it has sound but no picture.  no power outages or surges that I know of so what could be causing this to happen?

20070806002023AAr3HbD	Consumer Electronics;Music & Music Players	Severe iPod 5.5G Problem(Severe)?	Ok so just 45 minutes ago I downloaded some music videos off of Limewire. With that that done I synced my iPod to iTunes and attempted to review the video. And then at that moment the black screen that appears with the battery in the top right and play symbol at the top left appeared and my iPod..... froze.... or rather it crashed. I connected it to my computer, but it wasn't recognized in ' My Computer', however if i kept it attached and then ran iTunes AFTER I had plugged the iPod in it would show up in iTunes tabs, but not vise versa.      The first message I see states the obvious ' You have a corrupt iPod blah blah blah please restore' or something along those lines.  Ok so I pressed restore and amazingly.... I get a message saying that the device can't be restored to factory condition.      So here I am typing this up wondering if I'm going to have to purchase a new one. Please help.

I can get it to work with itunes just fine, but I want to use other software so I can connect the Touch with multiple PCs and transfer files/songs easily.  I found on Apple's website where it says to Click “Enable disk use" and I think that is what I need to do but that option is not available to me. And when I do use software from a 3rd party it says "Your Ipod is not properly connected to your PC or it does not allow files to be written in." I am sure that is my problem, the enable disk use, but that option is not there for me.Any and all help would be greatly appreciated.
