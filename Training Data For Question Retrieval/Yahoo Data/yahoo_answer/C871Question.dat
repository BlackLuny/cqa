20090203115802AAmowwq	Business & Finance;Corporations	How do I get a refund on a volunteering project when the company just disagrees with everything I say?	I had a bad experience with an expensive volunteering project abroad; the project did not exist as it was represented by the company and I left it early. When I got home I complained and requested a partial refund. It took two letters (and four MONTHS!) before my complaint was answered. The answer is full of blatant mistruths about the project and slander against my character. Practically everything they said is wrong. They refused to offer any kind of refund because of the way THEY said things were. It is just my word against theirs - so what should I do next, if anything? It is not worth hiring a lawyer because I'd spend more money on the lawyer than I would ever get back.

They aren't making noise on purpose, but the wife is obese and their living room is right above my bedroom. Every step she takes makes my ceiling creak and my ceiling fan makes noise. Also their little kid stomps around and screams and cries all the time. I complained to my landlord and he told them they needed to be quiet after 10 PM. The problem is I work from 7 PM to & 7 AM. So, since the landlord didn't do anything, I bang on the ceiling from time to time. Yesterday, the husband came down after I had banged on the ceiling one time (after listening to his fat wife walk across their living room for a half hour) and he comes down and tells my roommate to stop banging on the ceiling and to "just deal with it." I have 6 months left on my lease and my rage is building up to the point that I'm not sure what I'll do if this doesn't stop. Any suggestions?

At the end of March I would like to apply for a home mortgage for approx $180,000.00,  I have about $5,000.00 down and also only have a credit score of 639,the co-borrower about the same.  While I know that this is not a great score, I do believe that FHA is not necessarily a score driven mortgage.   My combined income with the person i am buying the house with is approximately $86,000.00.  Other then the normal debt of car payments, the debt we have is very minimal.   There is one concern I do have, I do have a $400.00 dollar collection on my account from a credit card.  This is approximately 3 years old.   My question is do I pay this or do I wait to see if I can get a loan and then pay it off at closing?  I know there are Alto of varieties of what can happen and who can be approved for a mortgage, my concern is paying of this debt and it dropping my score lower then it already is, and with the time guideline of when I want to apply for a mortgage, I am not sure how this whole thing would work.

20090221055538AAlWQ7J	Business & Finance;Corporations	Harassment at Work: What happens?	A friend (John) of mine got into trouble at work. Another friend (Lucy) of mine broke down crying and told the boss John was bothering her. He was saying things like how she looked like his girlfriend (now ex girlfriend) and he jokes around all the time, nothing sexual, just silly stuff. Everyone knows that. Some people are just sensitive, and now personal I think he should stay away from her. I'm not picking sides, like everyone at work is doing...which is so childish.      But what will happen to him now? I heard he was sent home the one day after the boss spoke with him. But, he can't be fired, right? It would just be a verbal warning, right?

20090220201117AA6bHBs	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	I reported my landlord to housing dept. for inadequate heat?	this is long and involved, but i want to give as clear a picture as possible.      i moved into my apt. dec. 1st and signed a 1 yr lease.  by christmas i was noticing that my apt was not just chilly (i'm very sensitive to the cold, so i thought at first that i was just being a big baby), but other people came over and said it was freezing.  nyc law states that between 6am - 10pm, when outside temp is 55 degrees or below, temp inside must be min. 68 degrees inside; and from 10pm - 6am, if outside temp is 40 degrees or below, temp inside must be min. 55 degrees.  before 10pm, it's been as low as 63 degrees in my apt.  the last time i called the landlord to complain about the lack of heat, he came up to my place with a thermometer in his hand insisting that it was 70 degrees in my apt (even tho i have 2 thermometers of my own that i keep in two different locations so that i can be sure of the temp when i have to call him).  he brought his thermo upstairs and held it by its base in the palm of his hand.  OF COURSE his hand is warmer than the air in my apt!  he proceeded to berate me for not having heavy drapes and not having covered my windows with plastic (even tho that would be a band-aid on a much more serious problem - and if it's done, should be at his expense not mine).  then my phone rang and he left, only to call me 10 minutes later to yell and berate me some more.  only to have his wife call me an hour later and say all the same things he said but in a sweet voice (sweet or not, it's still bullsh*t).  so tonight, the temp dropped again, and i called the nyc municipal hotline (311) and filed a report.      my question is this (and thank you for reading this far already):  i have a 1 yr lease.  i'm guessing that the landlord won't renew my least next december. BUT can he evict me based on my filing this report?  can he force me to move out just because i'm complaining about a bad situation that he refuses to fix?

Hi,    I would like to know about if I should be taxed for what I earn.    I am 17 and am a student at college. From october last year I worked in a paper shop for 4 hours a week and was paid ￡14 (￡3.50 an hour). The shop owner then lowered this because he said that he needs to take off tax which he told me was 20% this meant it was 60p from each ￡3 I earnt he would take away. This then lowered my wage to ￡11.20. He gave me form to fill in (P46) and has sent it off and said that he will have to keep taking tax off until he hears back from them.    I have worked there until the end of Jan (31.01.09), as I was fed up with the amount of work i did for that kind of money while he sat there at the till just watching me and it was at odd times during the day.       I also do a paper round there and am paid ￡22 a week for this but he never touched this with tax.   I also have another job but this is only for 3 hours once a week and I am only paid ￡15 for this and have not had to fill in any forms about tax e.t.c.    this makes my total income per year ￡2652 which is well under the ￡6000 i need to start paying tax.   I have looked up on the different websites about paying tax and it all says that I dont have to pay tax until I earn ￡6035 pa and this is no where near what he is giving me.   Today he had given me a p45 form and on it it says that I have payed a total of ￡49.20 tax when I dont think I should have.   Can i ever get this back? can i take this to a citazen advice bereau and they can help to get this back as i am a student who could really do with that money?

20090221052053AAunoTt	Business & Finance;Investing	Regarding 529's......Is my financial adviser giving me the right advice.?	My daughter's fund has lost about 25% in the last year.......down to just over $77,000. from over $100,000. We were advised to continue our $600.00 monthly contribution despite this and are losing every single penny of it and then some. I am beginning to get very scared.         What should we do? Our daughter graduates from HS in just over 2 years. She plans to attend Boston College or Clarkson University where the tuition's are very steep. I feel like I am watching her dreams go down the toilet as money continues to be depleted from her account.      What should we do? Leave this money in there so we are not penalized or pull it out with penalty. Should we continue contributing? We have been contributing to this fund since she was a young child, increasing this contribution in the past 2 years.       What should we do? I know you don't have a crystal ball but if this were your child's account what would you do at this time.      Thank you so much.

I learned that the us gets their money from St Louis from the Federal Reserve, for every dollar that the the US gets from the reserve they charge a interest on it, so the US will ALWAYS be in debt. I also learned that only 4% of Americas money is in physical form. So my Question is why does the government allow the reserve which is owned by the Rockefeller family to charge them run our economy? Why don't we just make our own money so we are not in debt and make life better for us in the US and all over the world? I just don't get why we allow someone charge us for our currency and especially the times we are going through at the moment. Any in sites on this topic would be great.

She is in her 40s and she told me that she never trusted pensions. So when she never wanted to contribute to corporate pensions schemes. When she was promoted to management in a previous job, membership was compulsory so she had no choice. The day she left, she withdrew her contributions. She said many of her friends thought she was crazy, she told me 'the idea of giving all my savings to someone or some organisation, telling them I'd see them in 40 years & ask them to return it in tact with a good return doesn't make sense. I never trust anyone with my cash'. I asked her what she does with it..she said 'I have my own thing going on'. Is she a bit crazy or really wise?

I have a CD maturing in April with a face value of 1.5k  My equity in my townhouse, where I live is probably around 9K. My wife could kick in another 3k. Combined salary 44k.      I have been paying a motgage for 4 years in my townhome. Refinanced  in Oct 07 and is now at 7% fixed. A 30yr, with a monthly payment of 1150, which I pay on time always.  Balance is 137.5K , with 28.5 years left.       Value of townhome was 165k at refi in Oct 07. The property is well maintained and probably worth 148k due to todays markets reduced valuations and comps in the area..       My credit score as of my last refi in Oct 07 was middle score of 799. I have never missed a payment.      I raise 4 kids in a small 2 bedroom, so looking elsewhere is inevitable. My work life is stable.      Should I refinance. Should I just liquidate and pay down the mortgage leaving some in savings. Or should I look for a foreclosured house. The area where I live the houses are all over 270k.  Larger townhomes are 220k which is an option we would consider. Thanks.

Today I had gotten to bed around 8 am and didn't wake up till 4pm.  When I woke up I noticed that the hallway light was on which wasn't on before going to bed and my hallway closet that didn't have a door on it now did and there was wet places in front of the door like someone walked in.  At that time I realized a maintenance guy had come when I was sleeping replaced the closet door and had left.  I am a heavy sleeper so I didn't even hear him come in.  I never got a heads up that he were coming.  I was not dressed while I was sleeping and my bedroom door was open which is connected to the hallway where the closet is located.  Now if I had woken up and went to the restroom I would of had a surprise and I'm sure the maintenance guy would have been surprised as well. Now don't they have to give you a notice for the maintenance guy to enter your apartment.  We are paying rent and it's early every month.  Our lease isn't up till June. Is it normal for maintenance guys to come in and fix things without your knowledge? We requested them to fix it but that's been months ago.  My boyfriend says they are allowed my sister says they aren't whose right?      FYI I talked to the leasing office about it and they said it won't happen again...

Our lease states that we can have any pet we want if the landlord gives consent. (our land lord lives in rhode island and we live in North Carolina so shes never seen the puppy either, but she will give consent if we pay a pet deposit.) So the lease says nothing about not being able to have a pit-bull IN THE FIRST PLACE!      I guess what I'm asking is do I have to prove anything?

I live in the uk and i am moving to germany in a couple of months and was just wondering what happens to all your debts when you move abroad. I don't owe a massive amount, about ￡3,500, about ￡2,000 of that to a bank and the rest to loan company. I was paying in monthly instalments here but that is more than I will be able to afford once I go. Would  be able to get away with not paying the rest back? I pay them both by direct debit so what would happen with my bank? would I be able to cancel the direct debit or would it continue to be debited from my account then give me a new debt with my bank? Would they be able to trace me abroad? I don't want to sound like a big con artist, im not staying in germany forever and I don't want to ruin things for myself when I return but its too much for me to pay right now.

They are always yelling at each other, yelling at their kids, they make a ton of noise in the middle of the night, the police were called on them already and the one woman was taken in handcuffs because she assaulted the officer.  My brother has epilepsy so he needs sleep.  He told our landlord about this numerous times and nothing was done.  Yesterday, he wrote a harsh letter to the landlord, he called our neighbors animals etc.  I think he was too aggressive.  Anyway, are landlord read the letter and sent a copy of it to our neighbors.  That letter had our personal phone numbers on it, our names, and obviously our address.  So about 2 hours ago, our neighbor came pounding on our door and she started flipping out on my brother.  I wasn't here for this.  We have a dog and while she was yelling at him our dog got her ankle, he nipped at her, he didn't bite and draw blood.  But she was screaming at my brother and up in his face so really the dog was defending him.  Can they take our dog away?  Was our landlord wrong to send them that letter?  What can we do about it now?

20090219170644AAyPQLV	Business & Finance;Personal Finance	Unemployment debit card and fees... do you think it's fair?	I just read a post on Yahoo! about people on unemployment complaining that they are being charged small fees for using their unemployment debit card.  One user was quoted as saying "They're trying to use my money to make money, I just see banks trying to make that 50 cents or a buck and a half when I should be given the service for free."      It is not THEIR money, it is OUR money... the taxpayers and this new stimulus that is providing them with the money.  Bank analysts project that those small fees can bring in a revenue of over $6 million a year, which could help the economy in a roundabout way.  The more money the banks have, potentially the more lending options they have, or the more money they have to cover debts as opposed to asking for a handout, or even perhaps reusing that money for unemployment benefts.      What's your take on this?  Do you think this is fair and these complainers have a legitimate argument or do you think they should just be happy to be receiving something despite there being a 50c charge to call customer service with a question?

20090219165544AATdJXC	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Health Care	Question about medical professions?	I am in 10th grade, all high honors/AP courses, top three in my class, somewhere around a 3.9 - 4.0 GPA, scored high on PSATs, etc...      I have been thinking about going into the medical field for a while, as it seems to make the most money for the lifestyle I would like to have, but I had a few questions...      First, is there anywhere I can view a COMPLETE list of specializations (i.e. pathologist, cardiologist, pulmonologist), their average salaries, and their general descriptions?      Second, is there any way to cut down on the time it takes to become a doctor? After some research, I found that the average was 4 years pre-med + 4 years med + 4 year residency = 12 years? Is there any specific college that could cut down on that, or any way possible to transfer college credits earned in high school (18, to be precise) to pre-med and cut down on time?      Third, what is the best school for students to go for pre-med studies, and what is the best medical school (in general, for any specialization).      Fourth, which job has the highest paying salary, and which has the most flexible hours?      Fifth (and finally) , how much would a complete education for the medical profession cost, in total, including residency?            THANK YOU SO MUCH for reading this entire thing, and answering my very long question. I am hoping that this will give me some ideas as to what to do with my future, and how to go about getting an education in this beautiful country of opportunity,America.       thank you again !   :-)

20090219175633AAywIGC	Business & Finance;Insurance	She called her card in lost/stolen to avoid late fee?	So, a very long story very short, I work for a equipment rental company and a lady returned a piece of equipment 2 days late. She had called us and we had offered her a days grace so when she arrived with the equipment I wrote up an invoice for $20 (1 day late fee). She wouldn't pay it. I explained that we had a signed contract, and if she didn't want to pay now (cash, card, whatever) we would just use the contract instead and charge the card info on file for the amount. She yelled and yelled about "I do not authorize that charge" and I kept saying "you signed this contract, you already did authorize it."       So suddenly her phone rang and she went to grab it (she had plugged it into the wall by the door when she came in) and as she picked up the phone she said "I don't authorize any charges" and ran out the door! I was surprised and got my manager who ran out and spoke with her as she got into her car. She said "if you want to talk about this I'll come inside in a second I have to make a phone call." so we went inside. After about 10 minutes we got suspicious that she might be trying to cancel her card or something, so the boss asked me to put the charge through, which I did, and it went through. About 10 minutes later she came back in and said "I see you've charged my card already"      The saga goes on, but after she stole an item off the shelf, ran out of the place like a loonie and drove off, the cops were involved and (since we are a rental company and have her full name and number and address and credit card info and Drivers license..) we managed to get her back and get our item back.       My Question pertains to her actions: She called her card in and reported it Lost/Stolen to try and avoid a legitimate late fee that she was legally responsible for. Its likely MasterCard will be calling us to see if the charge was legit, and everything should be fine in that respect, but did she commit a form of Credit Card Fraud?
