I've had a lot of discussions today about PSU's for my new 9500 GT card. My current PSU is a 300 W Bestec , and I don't know if it'll operate with the card which has a min requirement of 350W. Therefore it's time to go PSU shopping.     The problem is there are so many offers , how do I know which PSU to get? There's a good one on newegg for 35 dollars , it was 100 dollars.  http://forums.slickdeals.net/showthread....   There's another good one here , was 50 but is now 30. http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...  So which PSU's should I get to go with my 9500 GT?     PS : I said this before in my other question about the 9500 GT and the 300 W supply , but I'm trying to find a power supply that isn't too expensive. Please don't suggest any 100 dollar monsters , I can't afford them at this time. Thanks.

20090203133726AAb6XSe	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	How can I break my laptop?	I need to break my laptop beyond repair. It can't be "intentionally broken" or look like it. So no spilling or throwing off buildings.       And before you shout "Insurance fraud!" Reason I need to break it is because I would like a new laptop, and my mom said that she would buy me one as an early graduation gift if it ever breaks. She knows a bit about computers, which is why it can't look intentional.       She also said she would bring it to a repair tech to see if the damage is intentional and how much it would cost if it was broken. :/ She knows I really want it, that's why she knows I am just going to break it :/      I heard paper clips work on the vents. That true?

20081222194231AANczS5	Computers & Internet;Other - Computers	Power Point: ?Cómo puedo reducir el peso de una presentación para enviarla por Email?	Hice una presentación y la envié por Email. Algunos no la reciben, otros dicen haberla recibido y visto correctamente pero sin la música que lleva incluida y otros mucho peor, la recibían acelerada y superpuesta sin tiempos para leerla o verla correctamente.   En mi máquina se ve perfectamente (está bastante buena, modestia aparte) con los ritmos y tiempos que quise darle, con la música adecuada, con las fotos precisas, etc.   como no la recibían en uno de los lugares a los que quería enviarlo la llevé en un cd. Insólito: Salía absolutamente distorsioanda, los tiempos acelerados, sin música, con los textos superpuestos... un asco, bah! Volví a pasar el contenido de ese mismo cd en mi computadora y se ve tal como lo programé.   La computadora ajena en la que todo salía mal es mejor que la mía...    Aquellos a los que les envié la presetnación por Email tienen máquinas más o menos actualizadas, algunos mejor que la mía.   Bueno las preguntas serían:   ?Cómo puedo reducir el tama?o del archivo para que no tarde TANTO TIEMPO en salir? (tiene unos 7 Mb, eso que le quité varias diapositivas menos necesarias no se redujo en absoluto)   ?Qué puedo hacer (o qué no hice) para que la presentación llegue a destino tal como la edité y veo yo en mi computadora?   Muchas gracias a quienes quieran darme una mano en este problema.

20090222183729AAnGuoV	Computers & Internet;Software	Computer freezing up several times per minute. How can I check the CPU usage of all programs on my computer?	I run windows XP.  My computer is running poorly due to spikes of 100% cpu usage about every 10-20 seconds.  I've tried to see which program is causing these spikes by monitoring the cpu usage of processes with task manager.  Unfortunately when the computer freezes up, the display doesn't change, so I don't get to see which process is being the troublemaker.  I can see the cpu usage spike on the performance graph though.  Anyone know an app I can use to see exactly how much chip time each process is using over the last few minutes?  Is there anything else I should consider when trying to fix this freezing up problem?

It's starting to really tick me off...and I can't fix it, so I'm asking you guys. =D      You know how you can take a video clip, drag it into the Audio/Music bar, and just have the audio?   Anytime I try to do that, WMM crashes. A window comes up:   "Windows Movie Maker has stopped working..."   Sometimes another window comes up that says:   "Another user is running Windows Movie Maker on this computer. Please close the other session of Windows Movie Maker before starting Windows Movie Maker again."      But, the thing is...I'm the only one who ever uses WMM.    It hasn't crashed until just these past few weeks...      Is there anything I can do? Has anyone else had this happen before?      Please reply... I really want to make some more videos..lol.
