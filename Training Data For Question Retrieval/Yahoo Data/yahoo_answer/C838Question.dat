Here is the recipe I have been following to make chocolate chip cookies:   Ingredients   3/4 cup white sugar    1 cup brown sugar    1 cup butter, softened    1 tablespoon vanilla    2 large eggs, slightly beaten    3 cups all-purpose flour    3/4 teaspoon baking soda    3/4 teaspoon salt    3 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips      How can I tweak this recipe to make them thick and chewy.  I do not like the light and fluffy kind, and mine seem to be closer to that.  And it seems like they could be better. Can anyone help me, maybe there is a different recipe all together?

I end up with really dense balls that are never light and fluffy, even if I let the dough rise for hours.      b.  Never browns!  My bread always is that crusty white color, and never that beautiful golden brown hue.      c.  Tastes like yeast.  I mean overpoweringly like yeast...and flour.  That's it.  No flavor at all!      Somebody, PLEASE!  Help me here!  I would love to make some dinner rolls or a loaf of white bread sometime, but no matter the recipe I try, it always is a disaster!  What am I doing wrong!?

20090131183436AAeYJGg	Food & Drink;Beer, Wine & Spirits	Getting wasted for the first time, any advice?	I have plans with some new friends to get drunk tonight and want to know if there is any helpful advice to keep this from going horribly wrong.  My friends have drank many times before, no they didn't pressure me into this, so this advice is just for me.  I don't want advice saying "Don't do it!" or something like that because I have my own reasons for doing this.  I'm of a skinny build, 120 pounds, and I'm 17.  I know with this small body mass that it wouldn't take much to get drunk but I'm mainly asking how to avoid doing something incredibly stupid, besides getting drunk.  If anyone feels uncomfortable giving advice like this to an underage drinker I understand and don't want you to feel like you are going unheard.  No my family doesn't know I'm doing this but my brothers are (*Ahem*) Donkey's behinds, and my mom keeps such a tight leash on me, none of my other brothers though, that I feel I need to explore this option because nothing else has ever worked.

20090131182116AAlxObX	Food & Drink;Vegetarian & Vegan	How to not be rude about being Vegetarian?	Most of the people around me know that I am health conscious, and love to eat well, but not many of them know that I am vegetarian (with a few vegan tendencies).  I'm not that annoying vegetarian who shoves it down other people's throats.  If somebody asks, I tell, if they don't want to hear it, I don't tell them.  However, holiday times are hard because most people buy me nice foods and candy.  Some of which I can't eat!   no food should ever go to waste, so I give away what I can't eat.  When it comes to closer family members is when the situation gets weird.  For instance my boyfriend's mother just sent me a valentines day candy box, most of which contains gelatin (which i have chosen not to eat).  If I don't say anything then she will continue to buy gelatin containing goods for me and the problem continues.  But on the other hand, it's not her responsibility to keep track of what I eat, and what I don't.  Thankfully she is a really understanding woman with her own weird semi vegetarian diet.   How do I kindly tell my relatives thanks, but no thanks.  Is there a way I can not come off wrong?  suggestions please!!!
