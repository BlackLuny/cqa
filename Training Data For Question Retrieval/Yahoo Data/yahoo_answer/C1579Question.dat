20090205012001AA1fqVD	Travel;United States;Other - United States	Where Can I Find a Rustic, Secluded Cabin to Rent in VA, NC, TN, or WV?	Hi! Ok, my friend's birthday is in April, and to celebrate, a few close friends have decided to rent a cabin and have an "Evil Dead" birthday celebration! We are all fans of the film!!       So, I have taken on the responsibility of planning this adventure! I have done internet searches, but only come up with rental companies. I have also searched on Craigslist under every possible location for each state! All I can seem to find are the super fancy "chalets" with hot tubs and big screen TVs. Which is all fine and well - just not what I'm looking for!      What I'd be THRILLED to find would be a rustic cabin out in the middle of the woods. We don't want anything fancy. Just very basic!! Small TV that we can hook up a DVD player (scary movies & S'Mores!!!!!) and a functioning fridge and stove! Oh, and a bathroom inside! There will be a max of 5-6 people, So a 2 bedroom with sleeping options in the living room would be perfect. Or a 3 bedroom.       If you've seen Evil Dead, then you should have an idea of what I'm looking for! Or the cabin from Cabin Fever! Something along those lines. Cheap, rustic, secluded, off the beaten path! Oh, and if there is a little country store relatively close by, that would be awesome! It's going to be an awesome way to spend his birthday! Good friends, great food, and just a nice chill, relaxed long weekend! I just don't know where else to look!      If anyone can point me in the right direction, or knows of a cabin in your area or anything, please let me know ASAP! I've been looking for cabins for almost a week now (about 5 hours tonight!!!). We are looking to spend 3 nights ( Fri, Sat, & Sun) the first weekend in April! Thanks! :)

20090205013555AA0w8pj	Travel;Europe (Continental);Other - Europe	Spending Money London, Paris & Amsterdam June 09?	Hiii!!! I am heading over to Europe in June 09 with my partner and our 3 year old daugher, we have booked and paid for hotels in all three locations all which are 4-5star in great locations and include breakfast I was just wondering how much spending money do you think we would need each day for tourist attractions (maddam tussauds, eiffel tower, canal ride, london eye etc - the main biggies) as well as transport and food, we have paid for our rail tickets between each country, our stay in EuroDisney cost over $2500 for two nights so a little apprehensive as to how much you think we would need. Not including extra spending ie clothes shopping etc just the travel (underground,metro,etc), food (but not maccas but cafes etc would be fine) and tourist things? any ideas? would really appreciate any feedback, thanks!!!

20090205015707AATrmX9	Travel;Asia Pacific;Philippines	Living like a king in the Philippines?	I'm 12 years old and my father is 73, and we are thinking about moving to the Philippines this Summer, and together we make about 3700 a month on social security, insurance fees, etc. maybe a little more. Anyway, would it be possible to live like a king in the Philippines. For example, a five bedroom apartment with 3 bathrooms, and such. And where could we live the best with that money. Not to much in the rural areas, but not in the heart of the city either. I've been reading up on the Philippines, and I've heard that you can get a cook or maid for about $30 a month, plus the cost of food, and a room. Thanks, David

As someone who has no experience in NY (never even been), I've always been curious as to how some things happen there. Small things. Like if you have a car, how often do you drive it? Do you have to park it and walk 15 minutes everywhere you need to go? (I lived in the UCLA area of LA so it can be that way at times there). How much do cabs cost? Say you were going to a bar or out to eat or to work, how much would a typical cab cost on a daily basis?       Another random question. As a sports fan, I would think of something like this. How do athletes (Rangers, Yankees, Knicks...) get to the Garden/Stadium? Do they just be normal and take cabs or what? Odd questions I know but I wanted to ask because I'm bored. Thanks.

I'm wondering, is it a product of sensationalism, or are people in the UK that cheap?

I'll never recommend the restaurant after, but I wont be the cheap bickering fool over the price of a meal? What gives? Would rather make a stink in place of saving face? Lost....

And Im already enrolled there because I feel like I have no choice. But I am VERY reluctant because well.......IT'S OTARA! Will there be  bulletproof desks over there? Im very scared because I had a very bad experience with Islanders. I was shopping at Manukau City Mall and when I returned back to the car park 4 or 5 islanders just grabbed me and beat me up and ran away with my bag. I didn't even stare at them. If that happens in Manukau City imagine what would it be like in Otara! So what is Otara like? Is it very dangerous?

20090204230431AABspIU	Travel;Africa & Middle East;Lebanon	Is this considered as Karma? ?	MAKKAH: The Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice and the Public Prosecution in Makkah are investigating the case of an Indonesian AIDS victim who was raped by 46 men, including one police officer, around a month ago.      The woman, a 38-year-old maid, was initially raped at a backstreet rest house by a police officer. The woman was picked up by the officer after running away from her sponsor in the Nuzhah district late at night one month ago, Al-Watan newspaper reported.      Forty-five other men then raped her over the course of the night and next day.      The woman was then left on an empty road where another police patrol found her and took her to the King Faisal Hospital in the Al-Shishsha district of the city.      Subsequently, medical investigations showed that the woman was suffering from AIDS. She is still recovering in hospital, the daily said.      Police raided the rest house and arrested a number of men who raped the woman.      One of the men then supplied police with the names of his friends who also raped the woman.      Al-Watan newspaper also quoted a medical source as saying the suspects would have to wait at least six months to confirm whether they have AIDS, as symptoms only appear six months after the virus enters one’s body.      The men have been released on bail while investigations continue.

20090204232229AAK0Sb4	Travel;Mexico;Cabo San Lucas	Wanting to go to Cabo?	I want to take a vacation to Cabo San Lucas MX w/ my significant other the first week of May, from May 1st until May 8th. I've been looking online at hotels and flights and, I know I need a lot of money. Just the flight with Mexicana Airlines would be about 440, Plus hotel if I stay at a not so expensive hotel I found the Siesta Suites for 65.33/ night that would be about 500. Plus whatever I plan on spending over there. So that means I need to plan on having about 1500 for the trip correct?      Has anyone been to Cabo, or have any advice.       I really want to take a vacation in May (May 5th is our anniversary) so do you guys have any suggestions on other nice places to visit?      Thank you!

20090205010727AAImVM2	Travel;United States;Honolulu	Best place for me to stay in Hawaii?	I've always wanted to go on a beach vacation and for my 18th birthday I've finally received the opportunity to do so. I looked into Cancun, but I'm a very timid type of teen-not into partying crowds so I guess that's ruled out now. I want to go to an island where I can see some of Hawaii's natural beauty, but still have a lot of things to do like snorkeling and fishing excursions. I love good food so having access to good restaurants would be great. I would prefer swimmable beaches that are close to hotels. If anyone has advice on hotels from personal experience it would be greatly appreciated. I would like a place with nice rooms and a great pool of some kind, but not obnoxiously expensive (under $300/day). It would be nice to stay someplace where we feel like we got our money's worth. I'm bringing a friend who loves to surf so a good place for that is a plus as well. Thanks in advance for any feedback :)

I'm considering the following places:      1.Little Bourke St   2.Great Ocean Drive (any1 knows a good & trustworthy site that I can book from?)   3.Yarra River cruise (worth the cost?)   4. Queen Victoria Market ( my dad told me it's overrun by asians selling overpriced stuff)   5.La Trobe St   6.Lygon st/ Gratten st ( not sure what's there)      Is there any where else I should head to? I'm not so interested in tourist-y things. More of experiencing melb as it is. (:      Thanks

I want to take a trip starting in Brazil and ending in Chile where I would meet up with some friends there.

20090205023806AAGh8rS	Travel;United States;San Diego	Going to San Diego tomorrow morning, do I need my passport walk across the border?	I heard you need your passport now, but I had forgotten that it was in my safety deposit box.  I booked this trip very last minute, and I might not have time to go to the safety deposit box in the morning.    I will be staying with a friend in San Diego, and I'm sure he'd like to take me to Tijuana as well.    Will I be able to get by on crossing the border with just some US ID's like my driver's license?  I do have a scanned photo of my passport that I could print out.  Would that suffice?    I heard that you do have to bring your passport now, but I was wondering if they could let me go on a warning for "not knowing."    Thanks for your help/answers

And why do they say the British accent is so elegant and intelligent sounding.      In fact I always say that I would like to give any North American who asked for a British accent because it sounds so 'elegant' and 'intellectual' and 'proper' a Geordie accent (Newcastle-upon-Tyne) or a Brummie accent (Birmingham). Then I'd ask them if they still think they sound 'elegant' lol      And I'm not knocking Geordies or Brummies neither - I have a thick Geordie accent but I know I don't sound remotely 'elegant'.

They took my vitals, an xray of my elbow (I hit it on the pavement when I fell) and a CT scan of my head. I was released and walked out of the hospital 5 hours later.   TOTAL BILL: $14,000      I have insurance that I believe will pay (GOD PLEASE)...  But even if they do I am still trying to research what a CT scan in the ER should cost. So far it looks like an average ER visit is around between $1,000 and $3,000.  NOT $14,000!
