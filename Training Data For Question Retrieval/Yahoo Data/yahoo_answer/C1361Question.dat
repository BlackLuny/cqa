20090222184255AA2I2S9	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	How can I love myself if I don't know who I am?	I've come to the conclusion that the reason I don't have many close friends nor ever been in a relationship at 21, is because of my inability to love myself. Part of the reason I can't love myself is because I haven't figured out who I am yet. For instance, I'm studying economics and business in college, but I know deep down, that these aren't my true passions. Basically I haven't found what I want out of life. I then tell myself that life has no meaning anyway, so nothing really matters.   Anyway, I realize that I do have some good traits...like I can be extremely funny at times and I'm easy to talk to. I then start thinking that maybe I am a decent person, just trying to find my way in life like everyone else and that I shouldn't be so hard on myself. But when it comes down to it, I don't know who I am or what I would like to be...so how can I truly love myself? Maybe I should just love that I'm trying to find myself..?

This question is as much a statement as anything else in an effort to share how fluid sexuality is.      I was in a gay bar in San Francisco and it has enormous video screens and the clientele is almost 100% male (gay).      Beyonce came up on the screen and performed and I was entranced.      I actually turned to the bartender and said:  "I think I turned straight watching her"      He laughed and nodded, knowingly.      I am most definitely gay.      Do you know what I mean?      Do straight guys ever find themselves of thinking:       "Wow  ....  I'm straight but he is very, very attractive"      I suppose it's an inkling of something ....

20090222184328AANUFzM	Social Science;Psychology	Can someone please edit my essay for social work?	The guiding principle of my life is that each of us has a duty to help and serve others, to seek out marginalized and less fortunate individuals of our communities and offer any aid that we can. I have always lived by the motto “do unto others as you would have done to you”, and feel that the best way to do this is by furthering the ideal of social justice in the way I live and work. Social justice, as I see it, is the value system that recognizes the inherent worth and dignity of every human being and the right of everyone to be treated fairly and with respect. I believe that every individual is worthy of dignity and respect and each individual has the ability to become self-sufficient and able to make the best possible choices for themselves. When we as a society try to see the world through the eyes of the less fortunate, we can empathize with and understand one another. Only when each and every individual of a community is afforded the same level of dignity and respect can a society truly be called civilized. Those who cannot demand social justice for themselves must have a voice to demand it for them. It is my hope that by earning a Master’s degree in Social Work I can be that voice.      Our well-being is about having meaning in our lives, developing as a person and feeling that our lives are fulfilling and worthwhile. Our relationships also provide for our most basic human needs. Through our relationships, we are sustained in our personal growth and development. Our relationships are the substance from which each of us grows and interacts. The relationship substance strengthens our bonds and builds trust. As we grow, we learn from our life experiences. Reinforcement of values is what makes us who we are as individuals. For example, support and confidence from others helps to mold us into being a positive part of society. What makes individuals who they are is contributed by everyone who has helped and guided that person. Whether our family structure is composed of one or both parents, or other family members, strong support from others is important for that individuals’ well-being.       Just as human relationships with others and our family are essential for our well-being so is being able to trust others. Trust impacts everyone. It affects the quality of every relationship, every communication, and every effort in which we are engaged. The ability to establish, grow, extend, and restore trust is not only vital to our personal and interpersonal well-being but for the community as well. I believe that within every individual is the ability for him and her to reach their full potential. We seek to act with integrity in our own lives, fostering trust in our relationships with family, friends, and others. As people’s lives become more fulfilled, so this makes a positive change in how they interact with those around them, and these in turn affect others. As a result of this, one person living their life according with who they really are can, in a sense, bring positive change to the world. We can be the ones to give others that sense of hope that they can change their lives and improve their well-being.       Being different is the essence of humanity. Therefore it should never be the source of hatred or conflict. The answer to being different is to respect it. There in lies a fundamental principal to peace: respect for diversity. We are all different yet want the  same things for each other: to be respected by others. We should respect everyone that is different from ourselves and respect their beliefs, traditions, values and opinions. In some ways, all these things put together makes us unique in who we are. Therefore we need to embrace our differences and uniqueness.        I grew up in a small community in Southern Texas where most of the individuals were of Spanish heritage. We all interacted with one another regardless of our economic status or ethnic backgrounds. My families background is mixed. My mother is Mexican American and my father is African American. I only experienced the Mexican part of my heritage because I was raised by my mother. I can never escape my heritage as it is a major part of who I am. My heritage is everywhere around me. It is in our names, the foods we eat, the way we dance, sing, move, and interact with each other. For example, I enjoy listening to the music, Mariachi dances, and learning how to speak Spanish fluently. I enjoy eating Spanish foods like enchiladas, tacos, and chimichangas. This will never leave who I am.        There were many times when I would have conversations with others from my Spanish heritage, and they would hear me speak the language and they would comment on how I could speak Spanish really well. As we knew how to speak the same language, we already knew that there was something in common. I always assumed that anyone who spoke Spanish were of Mexican heritage. This is where I admit that I was wrong. I began to learn about the diversity of the Spanish heri

I mean what woman would find it weird if their man wanted to see/touch/play/etc with her breasts during sex?      In contrast, a forehead isn't a sexual body part and most women would find it extremely awkward if men touched/played/etc with her forehead during sex right?

20090222205225AA0Fuqo	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Why is the breast so vulgar and obscene?	The female breast is not a sexual organ by definition and yet it seems to be treated as such by American culture.  Really, my question is, what's the big deal?  The over-sexualization of breasts has obviously lead to negative views of breast feeding.  Yet many European cultures don't have this problem.  Many European cultures allow women to go topless at beaches or topless sun bathing and they have far less of an issue with public breast feeding.  So what's the big deal?  Do we really think if a child sees a breast they're going to be traumatized?        Do you think America should catch up with many European countries and make breasts less of a big deal and stop such heavy over sexualizing of the breast?  Why or why not?

20090222221914AAWiP95	Social Science;Psychology	Childhood 'love'-- can't get him out of my head?	Where do I begin? For starters, I'll say that I'm still a child...a teenager. But I was crazy about this one boy when I was little, not so little, when I was growing, and when I was almost done growing. He's my best friend's brother. I think he liked me, he was my first kiss (we were about four...it was cute and innocent), would play with me, always stare at me and smile, sometimes talk to me etc etc etc. Well I was stupid and 10 years old and I told his sister I 'liked' him. Like is an understatement. I was head over heels in love with this kid. He was gorgeous and sweet and made me laugh more than anyone else. Huge mistake. She went and told him I liked him and asked if he liked me too. No answer. UGH! Me and this girl have such a good friendship, so I forgave her, but he's avoided me as much as possible since then. That hurt, of course. I thought I was over it, (it's been how many years??) but I'm really really not.      Now he's moved VERY far away, but I come to visit it his sister who is my best friend. He basically ignores me. He slightly acknowledges my presence, but tries as hard as he can NOT to look at me. He doesn't smile back. He answers my questions with one word answers. If I died tomorrow he'd probably wouldn't come to my funeral. I feel extremely awkward around him.      I have no hope of him one day falling in love with me and saying, "You know what, Macy? I love you, I always have. I've just been so blind and stupid and proud. Say you'll be mine!!" I would just like to know how either I can forget about all of this awkward stuff, make him forget it too and just be normal acquaintances, OR forget him completely and ignore him like he does me.      This is so stupid, I don't want to know if he likes me, I don't want to care anymore. I just want to get over him. I keep thinking that I have, but it just comes back in my face. I'm not obsessed, I don't think about it every day, not even once a week. Just every once in awhile when super-lonely or if I see something that reminds me of him. I can't talk to people about this, especially my parents. They have no answers, and the rest of my friends would probably just laugh.      Do you ever get over your first love?      Serious answers only, please. I do sound a little crazy and this is really dumb and long but it's stressing me out and my heart feels like it's being ripped up. Any solutions to help would be very much appreciated.

20090222232308AAhBplD	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	If homosexuality is genetic as some have said?	If homosexuality is genetic as some have said, then does that mean that there is no such thing as bi-curiousity.  Obviously homosexuals and bisexuals are the only ones who feel turned on by the sight of their own gender, so if same-sex attraction is genetic, then bi-curiousity will never occur.  If heterosexuals don't have the genes, they will never look at their own gender in a sexual way.  They don't enjoy anything that has to do with the same-sex.  So are bi-curious people in the closet because heterosexuals just don't have the genetic make-up for same-sex attraction.

20070627212011AARjuEe	Social Science;Psychology	Is it human nature to connect mentally/emotionally on negativity?	Do you ever notice when complete strangers are in a room with each other, or confined space (like an elevator) there is an awkward silence up until they find something negative to point out which breaks the silence and makes them feel more comfortable. Why is it that a negative comment both parties can agree on brings them closer? Why doesn't a positive comment have this effect? Is it because human beings naturally have more negative vibes?      for instance, you can be sitting in the doctors office with complete strangers and the doctor may be taking a while to get to each patient and everyone knows it. When someone finally says "God, this doctor takes forever!" The other person will say something to agree like "he sure does!" and then both people will feel connected... but if the doctor is getting to everyone in a timely manor, people aren't going to say "Wow im impressed at how this doctor gets to his appointments in a timely manor !"      people aren't going care... boggles my mind...

I listen to a lot of rap mostly gangsta rap. I really like a group called, "Jedi Mind Tricks". I am also somewhat religious, (I dont go to church but i pray to God whenever I get the chance).      Onto my dream...      This is a very brief dream.   All i can remember is me dreaming about me being in bed, and all of a sudden a song that I have never heard before in my life comes on. It is "Jedi Mind Tricks" singing it, and it is talking about leaving God to worship Satan, and it was encouraging me to do the same. This woke me up at around 5 am and I couldnt fall asleep agian.      I dont remember much of the lyrics only the last line," So we abandoned him (God) and formed the New World Order ( some satanic group im guessing).      After i was awake alot of thoughts were running through my head like, hopefully im not possessed by the devil.      Please help interpret my dream,   Thanks!
