Either it was found defective in some way in the factory, any thing from a button loose to doesn't make calls, was fixed and tested to be at factory standards. <br>  It can be one that someone returned through warranty and was fixed, again tested to be working properly.<br>  It can, and usually is that someone bought it, didn't like it for whatever reason and returned it within the 30 day period. People will return a phone because they don't like the color, found that the first bill was too high, or they needed a deposit. Even if the box was opened so the store can show someone how it works, it's no longer new and cannot be sold at full price. <br>  All phones have been tested to be working properly. And you sure can get insurance.|`|lFzFtiCBaa	refurbished is either repaired or returned and tested to work properly. They are usually okay but no warantee or insurance in case anything goes wrong.

VJ1C5JsYaa	Well if you are connecting directly with the modem then chances are that you just have to power cycle both the modem and your computer before you are able to get back online. You might only have to power cycle the modem. <br>  <br>  What you need to do is the next time you go on live and then want to go back on to your computer is when you connect the computer to the modem. Pull the power cord out of the modem after you connect it to the computer wait a slow count of 10 second and the plug it back in. Wait for the modem to cycle up and then try using your computer internet. If this does not work simply turn your computer off and turn it back on. This should solve your problem.<br>  <br>  EDIT: This method I told you works under the assumption you know that without a router you can not use both the computer and Xbox at the same time. When you are directly connected to the Xbox the only thing that has internet is the xbox. Just like when your connected to the computer the only thing with internet is the computer.

jKc7aDCwaa	I think it depends on what you're looking for. I'd say that you'd get more replay value out of Sluggers. You can play through all the minigames on Warioware in an afternoon, after that you're just looking to unlock the different variation mixes of the minigames and get higher scores. I don't think the multiplayer would be as good as Sluggers, either. I haven't played Sluggers but if it's like any Mario sports games worth it's salt, it's got fun minigames along with the typical sports play.|`|3yNmclJgaa	Got both - Warioware for me is more fun :)|`|77VYceu7aa	if you've played one baseball game, you've played em all.

If you are not comfortable with software hacks, dont even attempt.

I have a 1g and have had it jailbroken ever since a week after i got it and i love it even more. I like the themes you can install and all this software available that you need to jailbreak for. There is no risk if you do it right, except you can't allow it to turn off and you cannot power it off manually as it will not turn on. You have to enter a long code on your computer to get it to boot. But there isn't any reason it should do this as usually you just lock it; that has no consequences. go to <a href="http://shabzco.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://shabzco.blogspot.com/</a> to get more information and to get a guide on jailbreaking.
2sMA3HQCaa	To cut down on the circuitry involved, there are only two charging circuits: one for one pair of batteries, and one for another. (In a sense, there are two 3-volt chargers present instead of four 1.5-volt chargers!) That literally means that if you insert three batteries, one of them will receive NO recharging whatsoever. (When they say it charges "2 OR 4" batteries, they mean it literally!) Inserting a battery that is at a different state of discharge just to "finish out" the 4 will result in cell overheating and shortened life for one of those two batteries, so do avoid that temptation.<br>  <br>  One has to squint closely when buying a charger to see if it is "2 or 4" versus "1-4" batteries. I have several devices that use three batteries, and know the problem well. I think you would be best off with a smarter charger.|`|AA10262868	If i were you i would go ahead and charge 4, that way you have one fresh left over and the next time you will only need to charge 2.

Upham in Saving Private Ryan?<br>  <br>  PSN is fine. The servers have been essentially lagless since PSN was created. But as with any server, it depends on the game. The game developers usually make the server space. If SCEA was involved in development they may run the servers. They run Warhawk which would ping 99 across 11 time zones before they regionalized the games. I don't know how but they did.<br>  <br>  Connecting to PSN has always been easy too. You can save your password so you just press x to log on.<br>  <br>  Home is terrible, like I told everyone it would be, all except for Red Bull Air Race which is kind of cool. It is like the Sims, something that attracts only girls and perverts. That is pretty much the only people on Home at any given time. <br>  <br>  But PSN has always been excellent. It gets a bad rap. Not being able to voice chat with someone who isn't on the same game server as you is a trivial issue. If you need that much voice chat, you talk too much. Just use the text messages.

j5Apt8hWaa	If you are looking for cheap lenses, you are looking at generic lenses that can be used on Nikon, Canon, Pentax, Olympus and Sony DSLR's<br>  <br>  None of the lenses made by the above manufacturers can be considered cheap, maybe inexpensive, but certainly not cheap.  The word "cheap" implies something that is of low quality and not built to last.<br>  <br>  Built-in IS is a compromise ..  it tries to compensate for various focal lengths and as a result it has only okay performance .... that is why you see that the two makers of the cameras chosen by the pros, design SI/VR systems that match individual lenses and focal lengths.<br>  <br>  No IS/VR is offered on wide angle lenses because they are not needed.  IS/VR is only offered on lenses that can benefit from those technologies.  By the time a person had become a pro, they can hand hold a camera at 1/15th of a second with no camera movement and when using a wide angle lens there is no camera movement.<br>  <br>  The best brand to invest in is the one that has the most lenses available for he camera system.  In the digital world, cameras are being replaced by the pros every 18-24 months due to the advancements in technology, yet lenses never need replacing.  You investment, then is really in the lenses ... not the camera<br>  <br>  The cost of the VR/IS lenses are not much more than none VR/IS, in fact, my old 400 mm f/2.8 cost nearly $800 more than the current 400 mm f/2.8 VR.<br>  <br>  Video from the latest and greatest sub-pro Nikon ...

If you want inexpensive, don't get cheap, you should stay with the kit lenses for the camera rather than to sacrifice quality of your photo.<br>  <br>  To be totally accurate, however, there are few, if any, people answering this who can tell whether your shot your picture through the most expensive glass or a coke bottle.  Perhaps on the worst examples of lenses you can see a discernable difference, but on the whole, no one will.

If you're not doing work that needs more MPs 7MP is fine.  Master the camera you have and if you need a better camera after that get a DSLR then you can explore the other world of photography.<br>  <br>  I see so many people get caught up in the "I need a better camera" and then get mad cause their pictures look just like the ones on their other camera.<br>  <br>  For about 2 years I had a 2.0MP Toshiba camera doing all my internet pictures and it was great till it got dropped by another family member (who said nothing about it) I had another camera for my professional work.  Don't get caught up in the MP game... if all you do is stuff like Myspace pictures and only print out 4x6 pictures getting a high MP camera is just wasting your money.  Since you're going have to reduce the resolution to get them online.|`|9gdJNTajaa	Hi.  I am not just saying this because I own one, but in general canon cameras can produce very good quality photos.  The model I have is Ixus 90 i, 10 megapixels, and the thing I like about it is that It has never given me a blur photo (eving when I was testing it like a madman and shaking the camera and taking a photo of a still object)<br>  <br>  Hope I have helped :)|`|3TIBDgypaa	I had this dilemma as well. As a Christmas present I bought my boyfriend a digital camera and I was stuck between Fujifilm and Nikon. While comparing the two, most of Nikon's camera's are all great quality. I was almost considering purchasing a Nikon but I saw the look of the Fujifilm Z20fd and it is sooo nice! This camera is definitely unique due to its bright color, which I loved! So since you own a Fujifilm and wanted to know how the 10 MP is, it is amazing! I ended up purchasing the Fujifilm Finepix Z20fd and I bought it for about $150 at Best Buy.The camera takes super clear pictures, it looks nice, and the video quality is really good. <br>  <br>  My best advice for you is too look online at different websites like Best Buy, Walmart, Target or any other electronic stores and check out the reviews that the customers put. That helped me out the most since I didn't have time to actually go to the store and purchase it, I ended up getting it online. So overall, read the reviews! If you are looking for a certain brand name for example, Nikon, look at all their cameras and compare from there. As for price wise, I am confident that you can buy a great camera for under $200 for sure. I remember I bought a 8 MP Olympus camera for $300 about 3 or 4 years ago and now they are so cheap! <br>  <br>  Anyways, I hope this helps and good luck!|`|WAl3vvNnaa	Canon would be the best. I have a Canon Rebel XTI, not what you are looking for, but Canon's are very well known and used in the photography world. They take clear pictures and have feature that many cameras do not have. Nikon would be the second best. Fuji and Samsung are not used as much.

1d9LTqBOaa	First of all, your ipod will be much cooler. You will be able to put themes on it, view and change files using SSH, get special games and add-ons only available via jailbreak (like SBSettings), and there is almost nothing that can go wrong. If you have a 2g, go to <a href="http://shabzco.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://shabzco.blogspot.com/</a> for help and feel free to ask anything you want in the shoutbox. If you have a 1g, go to <a href="http://www.quickpwn.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.quickpwn.com/</a> and download quickpwn for your operating system. You cannot brick your ipod and it is not illegal to do this, so it is worth it unless you don't have the time. 1g can take up to 5 or 10 minutes and 2g between 30 minutes to 2 hours.|`|IXiNtDnEaa	what kind of ipod...?|`|hjSkYuYsaa	you can't jail brake a ipod you can only jailbreak a iphone<br>  <br>  jail break means that you have unlocked it and you can <br>  <br>  use a another sim card in it hope this helps

eVptHOOBaa	Yes, you can!<br>  <br>  But you'll have to get rid of the lens. Having a lens defeats the purpose of pinhole photography! The whole idea is that when you do pinhole - there is no lens, just a tiny little pinhole...<br>  <br>  Get a spare body cap for your camera (unless you're willing to puncture one it came with). Then using a very fine needle (heck - a pin, hence the name) make a hole right in the middle of that cap (mark the center, heat up the pin and carefully puncture it so that the hole is just through and nice and circular). Put the cap on the body instead of the lens, and you're ready to go!<br>  <br>  Of course don't expect to see much in your viewfinder, the hole would be so tight that little light will pass... You'll need to set your exposure manually of course (camera on manual mode, all others will refuse to work without a known to the camera lens attached anyway), and for that matter maybe even bulb. Aperture does not matter, that's your pinhole that will define that. Then start experimenting with exposure. Try starting with about 15 seconds or so (depending on ISO). If overexposed - cut it in half, if underexposed - double it.....<br>  <br>  Good luck,<br>  <br>  LEM.<br>  <br>  P.S. when doing this trick - make sure you don't let the dust inside the camera!!!<br>  <br>  P.P.S. Here's a good step-by-step guide with pictures to making a pinhole lens out of your spare body cap:<br>  <a href="http://www.camerahacker.com/EOS_Pin-Hole_Lens/index.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.camerahacker.com/EOS_Pin-Hole...</a><br>  <br>  P.P.P.S.

The cheapest way to go is just getting unlimited texting for the whole family for $30 because its usually $10-$20 for texting bundles on each individual line where as the $30 covers up to 5 lines.

FRrU2MUzaa	From a stereo system or player such as a cassette player or CD player, you can take the phono outputs into your PC sound card. The phono outputs are usually left and right stereo outputs, but they may be labelled AUX - it really depends on the device.<br>  <br>  There should be an input socket for a 3.5 mm jack plug on your PC sound card, so using a cable like this will connect the cassette player to your PC:<br>  <a href="http://www.maplin.co.uk/Module.aspx?Modu..." rel="nofollow">http://www.maplin.co.uk/Module.aspx?Modu...</a><br>  <br>  This is taking an analogue output from your cassette player into a digital input on your PC. <br>  <br>  To record your music you need a piece of software like CDWave (which is free):<br>  <a href="http://www.milosoftware.com/en/index.php..." rel="nofollow">http://www.milosoftware.com/en/index.php...</a><br>  <br>  Connect your cassette player to your PC using the cable above, start CDWave and start recording, then press play on your cassette player and play the tape for as long as you want/need.<br>  <br>  CDWave shows you the wave form of the music so you can see where tracks start and end and you can edit your file into separate tracks.

2btGvJexaa	Unfortunately the first bill is always the highest. Not only are you paying for you actual monthly charge but there is also a $35 dollar activation fee they almost never tell you about. Also the first bill is pro rated for the month you were using it and the month you hadn't paid yet. I always tell my customers the first bill can be up to double what you bill should be at highest. And then dont forget the $10-$15 in taxes that will also be your bills. For your boyfriends dilemma however I have no idea why his second bill was higher than the first, that's very odd. I would have him call his carrier and make sure all the features he thinks he added were really added by the sales rep.

08a542503113638ff89e9695a92c2c8baa	The simple answer is yes.<br>  <br>  If you have a GSM phone (that will accept an AT&T SIM) you can get them to activate it free at most ATT corporate stores.|`|0Ye3d4C3aa	you can just buy one of those and activate it and use the sim in another phone, but you will have to buy a phone that is GSM and is made to use with a att sim card. you will have to pay the full price of the new phone (usually aroung three hundred). you can just buy a sim card, but they are twenty five dollars, and the prepaid phones that come with a sim card are as cheap as ten bucks, so you might as well just do that.|`|QoLL2ucGaa	You will have to buy the phone (for retail price) and a prepaid SIM card.

legycdOFaa	The Xbox ports output standard USB spec I believe, that's 5V. <br>  <br>  I think they put out about 1A of current as well, it's above standard USB spec (500mA) but it means it's enough juice for things like iPods. It's technically enough to drive a (small) fan, but not fast enough to do anything other than impede the air flow your console already produces; most PC spec fans run at full speed at 12V. You'll make your console hotter if you try!<br>  <br>  You can BUY cooling devices that fit nicely onto your box and don't cause any problems, I really recommend going down that route instead, or powering your fans from an external source ;) Either way, it's gonna sound like an aircraft taking off!|`|8146e347ad7537c819ea87c18358a194aa	If you are worried go buy a powered usb hub.

VlzaXlNkaa	This is simple.  Look at what you want out of the purchase.  Do you want to play anything Resident Evil related?  If so, buy the Red Elite, if not get the regular Pro.<br>  <br>  Personal preference and past experience leads me to lean towards the Red Elite (or any special edition), for the simple fact if you don't even want or like the extra game that comes with it you can sell it at GameStop.  Mechanically it is EXACTLY the same, only the color is different and a lesser HD capacity.  Why make a big deal out of it?<br>  <br>  BTW... I still rock my 20GB HD and it works fine for me (first day release Premium Edition, still rockin' strong!), if you end up "cheaping" out, it's no real loss as you'll still have plenty of space to enjoy everything Xbox Live and the Original Xbox games have to offer.|`|VlmN3TLeaa	i would get the Red Xbox 360 Elite.<br>  Its better bcuz of its color and ya. 120 gb if u didn't knw that.|`|9AR6B4ELaa	of course get the red xbox 360 elite<br>  <br>  its better than the pro and more stylish so, dont get the pro if you have a better choice

rWZbtgXIaa	Go for Samsung RL-39WBMS1. This model have freezer in the bottom and the fridge in the top. The main advantage of having freezer in the bottom is it gives access to the fridge compartment without having to bend too much. Also those items that one access regularly, like fruits vegetables will be at the eye level. <br>  <br>  If you are going in for a fridge with freezer on the top, better check for freezer lamp. If you have small kids, better go for models with door locks. Also check for the fridge and freezer capacity. I would suggest you go for Samsung RL-39 WBMS1. The price is around Rs. 35,000 and it also have a water dispenser. The freezer is at the bottom of the fridge.

On a lighter note my favorite app is Shazzam, any song you hear you hold your phone up to the music and it tells you the song name, artist, album and a link to buy it. I use it everywhere I go whether I'm at a club, restaurant or just listening to the radio. If your phone is unlocked deff make sure you get PDANet, that app allows you to use your phone as a modem and tether to your computer, Apple hasn't allowed it yet but its amazing to be able to do.

You will not be able to play the games because DVD games require a DVD Drive also known as a DVDROM or DVD-RW drive (if it's a burner) to play them. <br>  <br>  You can easily find out what type of drive you have by double clicking on MY COMPUTER on your desktop. Look for your CD or DVD drive (generally the E drive). If it says CD with any letters after it, then you cannot play DVD's. If it says DVD with any letters after it, then you can play both DVD's and CD's on it. There is no program that you can download which will allow you to play a DVD game in a CD Rom drive because a CD Rom drive cannot read a DVD.|`|O0ojUIfvaa	u can use any friend's computer which has a dvd drive to create an image of the dvd u hav got. u can use nero to create the image. nero will create an image with extension ".nrg".<br>  <br>  then copy the image in a usb pendrive and put it in your pc. then download daemon tools. u can get it from <a href="http://www.filehippo.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.filehippo.com</a><br>  <br>  daemon tools will create virtual dvd drives in ur system. then load the image file and play!!!<br>  <br>  if the image file is too big and u cannot put it into one pendrive, u can use a file splitter like hjsplit. <br>  <br>  all the best!!!|`|YJoRHaYFaa	You need a dvd drive to play dvd's.
xTioPxaVaa	The correct answer is "when they need to be changed".<br>  <br>  How fast strings wear out depend on how often you play, how hard you play, how clean you keep the strings, and your own body chemistry.<br>  <br>  If you keep your hands clean, and wipe the strings down with a clean cloth after you play, they should last for a while.  When they sound dead (especially the bass strings, where they have a "thud" instead of ringing), or they won't stay in tune, it's time to change them.<br>  <br>  Just for a point of reference, I have to restring after 2 shows.  I'm one of those people with acidic sweat, so I can destroy a set of strings in just a few hours.<br>  <br>  And I don't know why a poster is down on Fender Bullets.  If you have a Fender guitar with a tremolo block, they're the best thing to use as far as tuning stability goes (because of the way they sit in the block).  For other guitars, I've been a fan of D'Addario XLs for years now.<br>  <br>  As far as other maintainence, it really centers around keeping the guitar clean.  If you have a rosewood fingerboard, then it needs to be conditioned once or twice a year (depending on how dry your climate is).  Most people use lemon oil, and that's just fine.  Remove your strings, put the oil on, let it sit for 10 minutes or so, and then wipe off the excess.<br>  <br>  Unless you change string guages, you should have to worry about setting your intonation.<br>  <br>  Finally, there's the truss rod adjustment.  This helps counter the pull on the neck from the strings.  Although some will disagree, a neck should not be perfectly straight.  It should be slightly concave, and the truss rod adjusts this.  Since you can do some damage to your guitar is you're not familiar with this, best to have someone experienced in guitar setup show you how to do it.<br>  <br>  Good luck.<br>  <br>  Greetings from Austin, TX<br>  <br>  Ken|`|RplkclzJaa	I change mine monthly, I would probably do it more if I weren't broke.If you want to save some money buy strings in bulk. <br>  <br>  And whatever you do stay away from Fender Bullets, just do the right thing and get Slinkys.

7387e6c115c3e73674c3ab5985e1e6e3aa	Paris Hilton's Sidekick hacked<br>  Feb 20 2005 - 08:30 PM ET | Danger, Security, T-Mobile<br>  Update: Here's how Paris Hilton's Sidekick was hacked<br>  <br>  Nearly all the data from Paris Hilton's T-Mobile Sidekick was posted online. A hacker group that calls itself DFNCTSC has taken the credit and the FBI is investigating.<br>  <br>  Rumors are going around the web that this wasn't really a hack--it was social engineering. Social engineering is a technique used to get information out of people by pretending to be something or someone you are not. In this case it could have been a call to Paris from something like the "T-Mobile Account Security Division" requesting her login.<br>  <br>  Her address book contained over 500 numbers, including some hot celebs such as Eminem, Lindsay Lohan, and Christina Aguilera. Matt Drudge spent the afternoon cold calling the celebs to confirm authenticity.<br>  <br>  Other posted information included many photos and her notebook which detailed appointments.<br>  <br>  Just last week a young man plead guilty to breaking into T-Mobile's computer system and stealing customer information. Among the stolen data were Sidekick photos of Paris Hilton (The two incidents are separate, but both oddly feature Paris Hilton).|`|AA11053501	wow like Paris whore is such important person and we should give **** .<br>  and here is the black lady saying its 2006 you can hack anything... you ppl dont use your brain....you just say what comes to your mouth... its the knowledge that counts..|`|50d7b9f394b9d54e940a04eda9c61a9baa	its 2006, you can hack in to anything sweety|`|903742442a5220ca7b667db79109e098aa	comptuer hackers get smarter and smarter everyday, and yes you probably can hack a phone, it's a computer ain't it?|`|da878ec739a1d54b8d6e2e8964bb695caa	i have three things to say.<br>  <br>  1: its made up just to get her more publicity<br>  2: who cares<br>  or<br>  3:she had some sort of virus i dunno i dont think you can hack a phone.

Some are games that are from past Nintendo Consoles, and some that are exclusively on the Wii.  Those that are exclusively on the Wii are in the WiiWare section there.  There are many quiz and trivia games.  In order to purchase these games, you can either use a gift card, or go to a store, for ex:Besbuy, and purchase a card.  You take the card home, redeem a code, and enter the code in the Wii shop channel.  This card will give you 2000 points.  The most expensive games there are less then 2000, so you can pick ANY game you want.  And if you have enough points left, you can get more games, or additional channels for your Wii.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|ygGr1nX7aa	Animal Crossing is a popular one, it's kind of hard to describe.

If you do this, you will be charged an upgrade fee of $18 and your contract will be extended. If you are not 21 months into your contract, then cingular won't give you any discounts on your phone. You will have to pay full retail if you want to buy through Cingular, but your contract won't be extended.<br>  <br>  You also have an option to buy an unlocked phone directly from the manufacturer like Nokia or Motorola, etc. Then you simply take the sim card out of your current phone and put it in the new one. You won't have to pay Cingular the $18 upgrade fee if you do this, however factory unlocked phones will cost more..|`|AA10103757	Did you try upgrading your plan, they might let you, I'm not sure. But before I had Cingular and they were really rude and persistent when we wanted to make a minor change(it was even w/in the 7 day period thing). Another thing you can do is just buy the phone you want off ebay and stick your sim card in that one. That's what I did(but I have T-Mobile).|`|AA11480488	Why would you need to cancel your account if you're planning on staying with Cingular?  Just buy a new phone and see if you can change your plan.  It'll extend your contract two years.

(infrared is free and u dont need a network to use it but only a phone with infrared)<br>  <br>  another way to connect is the bluetooth. the bluetooth can do the same things and more ((send data , headset, even controlling other divices like controlling a toy car(its a car made by sony ericsson and works with sony ericsson phones) with bluetooth)) and the good thing about bluetooth is that its faster and completely wireless (10 meters or sometimes more) (bluetooth is free and you dont need a network to use it only a phone with bluetooth)<br>  <br>  GPRS is a way of connecting to the internet through the gsm network (the cell phone network) and there are many faster ways to connect to the internet but the GPRS is the most comon one.

ohq6qrFaaa	Check each album you have. (I haven't used iTunes in ages, so bear with me) If you select an album, go into properties and see if the album art box in the bottom left corner of the window that popped up has the artwork. If it doesn't, drag the album art fro the bottom right corner of itunes (it's big, you can't miss it) into that box. This should embed it into the file.<br>  <br>  Another option is to remove everything from iTunes. And Tag all of your music through a program called MP3 Tag. Which can embed the album art too.|`|G7SL3YuLaa	I have a similar problem. I get all my music off itunes and the artwork is automatically downloaded into my music list. But do you get a black square on your iPod artwork box when something is playing? I either get that or just the default music note sign.<br>  I have just gotten used to it. I don't think there is a way to make it show. Maybe you have duplicates of songs? Try searching for duplicates as the same 2 songs may wipe the artwork out. Or click rest settings on your ipod or on itunes when the iPod is plugged in to your laptop/computer and maybe that might work.|`|YCqnmsrFaa	If it's from a CD it won't have Album work.

I have a DSC-N2 and I was having the same problem (took me a while to figure it out), and many people even told me that my camera didn't have that option - of course, it did :) Heh. <br>  Once you go to the menu from the still picture mode go to the first option on the top left side; you should see a little camera pic. and either AUTO, P, M, etc. right next to the little pic. Tap it (I think your camera has a touch screen too?) and then change the setting to P (Program). After that, go back and tap the menu option on the bottom left side. Tap color mode, and choose the color mode that you want :) <br>  Once you want to change it back, do the same thing :) <br>  Best of luck! I hope this works, I know how frustrated I was when I thought I didn't have any color options, and yet I loved the camera so much already (I just got it)!

f3586d5e0985f6e9f0447a70215d2b84aa	NO, the iPhone is an AT&T EXCLUSIVE. T-Mobile won't get it.

If so you can buy a bluetooth connector that plugs into a USB port on your computer. It comes with its own software programme and you just transfer the files to your PC that way.<br>  <br>  If you don't have bluetooth on your phone, you should still be able to buy a cable to connect your phone directly to the USB port (you may have got one with your phone when you bought it). Your phone should also have come with a software CD, so just load this up, connect everything and get tranferring!

AA10775666	Simply copy the ringtone to your phones music folder and then go to the same folder using your phone and select the tone > go to options > choose the 'set as ringtone' option AND if this option isn't there then move the tone to the phone memory and then go to the ringtones menu and check to see if it appears in the list. Most service providers block this free ringtone service inorder to force people to buy them instead so that might also be the reason IF you're unable to set it as ringtone.

You can buy a Verizon phone on eBay and activate it as long as its ESN number is clear.  It has to be a Verizon phone, though, as they will not activate a non-Verizon phone on their network since its ESN number will not be in their database of their phones.  Get the ESN number of the phone BEFORE you buy it so that you can make sure that it is clear.  If the seller refuses to give you the ESN number before you buy it, do not buy it from them.|`|QDB1UFWjaa	You can.  Though its not really upgrading through verizon after that point.

You can either activate the phone by calling 1-800-922-0204, or accessing your account online on www.verizonwireless.com.

b44144fd71d42797cb82f8664821a849aa	Warning: Restoring your iPod will remove all your songs. <br>  <br>  To restore your iPod, <br>  1. Make sure you've reinstalled the latest version of iTunes. <br>  2. Open iTunes, and then connect your iPod to your computer. <br>  3. After a few moments, it will appear in the Source list in iTunes. <br>  4. Select your iPod in the Source list and you will see information about it appear in the Settings tab of the main iTunes windows. <br>  5. Click the Restore button. You will be prompted with one or more restore options that may prompt iTunes to automatically download of the latest iPod Software. The 4 possible restore options are: <br>  Restore Option 1: Restore - Restores with same iPod Software version already on iPod. <br>  Restore Option 2: Use Same Version - Restores with same iPod Software version already on iPod even though a newer version is available. <br>  Restore Option 3: Use Newest Version - Restores with the latest iPod Software on your computer. <br>  Restore Option 4: Restore and Update - Restores with the latest iPod Software on your computer.<br>  <br>  6. A progress bar will appear on the computer screen indicating that the first stage of the restore process has started. When this stage is completed, iTunes will instruct you to leave iPod connected to your computer to complete restore. <br>  7. During the stage 2 of the restore process, the iPod will show an Apple logo as well as a progress bar at the bottom of the display. It is critical that the iPod remains connected to the computer or iPod Power adapter during this stage. Note: The progress bar may be difficult to see since the backlight on the iPod display may be off. <br>  8. After stage 2 of the restore process is complete and the iPod is connected to the computer, the iTunes Setup Assistant window will appear asking you to name your iPod and choose your syncing preferences similar to when you connected your iPod for the first time.<br>  <br>  For more help visit www.apple.com/support

iQxVio2paa	I would go with Tracfone, because Verizon and AT&T each have their own network, but Tracfone rents network time from them both so tracfone will give you the best coverage area.<br>  Price wise tracfone is also the best deal.  <br>  <br>  PS I also went to "phone selection" sites and forums, but the sites had outdated information in them, are often set up by brands and networks therefore biased; and the forums are populated by cell-phone-as-a-tech-gadget junkies, they generally look down on tracfone, to put it mildly.<br>  <br>  Bottom line if you don't call more than say 100 minutes per week tracfone is the best deal.|`|uC2yA9b6aa	for network att and price tmobile ( 10 cents ) >Also you shoulg go to <a href="http://cellphonesmarket.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=3" rel="nofollow">http://cellphonesmarket.com/forum/viewfo...</a> to get the complete list of all the prepaid phone list to have a little better idea. have fun|`|5b7d674a8bb4ba0ddfce9aa111229316aa	You can research and compare the services online at www.letstalk.com (see link at the bottom of that page for service comparisons--they'll ask for your zip code) and at other similar sites.<br>  <br>  Just google "compare cell phone service."<br>  Good luck!|`|q6REWQV4aa	I've tried em' all and net 10 is the easiest and cheapest, there's no roaming fees and you don't lose your # when mins expire.

kxMgUkmlaa	contact creative at your country. But if you live in Singapore, the service charge will be $40 dollars.I cant help you further as you did not state your country name.Good Luck! Normally you have to pay more if you do not have warranty or the problem is caused by you.
x1eXQNGJaa	Check your plan... Sprint does offer nights and weekends free, but you have to have the plan that offers evenings starting at 7PM.  They also have a plan that starts after 6PM, but again it depends on which plan you have... Sprint has a way of taking people for every dime they have so check your bill, and service plan to make sure you have the one that offers free calling after 7PM.|`|rvtOlXMDaa	Yes, weekends are free....  Does not have to be after 7 if you are calling on Saturday...  Can be any time after 7PM on Friday...<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!
hmjHavxOaa	*67 then the number. i will either appear as restricted or private but they're the same thing!|`|0GA5903Gaa	2 ways...dial *67 before every call....or call verizon and ask them to add the block for your called ID (if you do this one then you will have to dial *82 before every call you want to show your number to) its a free feature...you could also store the *67 or *82 in your phone book when you add peoples numbers in there so it auto blocks or shows your number|`|AA10394735	You can apply for it to be restricted or you can just type in *67 before the number.|`|6Wb4oS8taa	*67 then the number|`|R82useiWaa	*67
ZrVJx6kNaa	Ok, MP3 Rocket is a great program to donwload music that has good quality, but you cant download all songs you want. If you want good quality music, you want limewire, it'll download music that has good quality, and its all free, unless you want pro. here's a direct link to get the free one. <a href="http://www.limewire.com/download/version.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.limewire.com/download/version...</a>   all you have to do is choose you OS and you're pretty much ready to go!<br>  Hope this helped!

WHne itunes opens there will be a tab with your ipods name on the left hand column. Right click it press options go to music and press manually manage songs<br>  <br>  good luck
nElyuKoDaa	iphone!|`|z8qdz9WFaa	iphone cuz there cooler and use can use it all the time. and you  have all your life to buy a ps3|`|AA10073982	iPhone. It's cheaper, now (only) $399 after Wednesday's price drop, and also, no one wants a PS3. If you're gonna buy a game system, buy a 360.<br>  <br>  Or, get a Wii & iPhone instead, for the price of just a PS3 :)|`|81e5354b639a0a8a9b2d5ad02e2451d2aa	If you have at&t and an existing plan...get the iPhone...if not...get the PS3..wait nevermind get the Halo 3 360 instead|`|BQVvDSgJaa	i agree with mark n|`|NDX8Oqdjaa	I would take the PS3 because it would be funner plus the iphone is in its first stage if you wait like a year or two they will be better and less expensive
