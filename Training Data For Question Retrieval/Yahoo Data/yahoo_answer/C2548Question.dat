20090220180818AAdc40t	Cars & Transportation;Commuting	Shouldn't it be legal to speed excessively on the highway?	Yup I'm 17 but I'm partly correct      Like 120 mph instead 65. I know what it's like and as long as you have a car that's fast enough to not brake down at that speed and as long as you drive in a straight long line you should be fine oh and when there's very light traffic.         As long as you don't speed anywhere unsafe like ANYWHERE other than the highway you should be fine.       Oh and like me you have to be a well skilled driver not just a driver with 2 days experience.

20090220190335AA0gNZS	Cars & Transportation;Other - Cars & Transportation	Question About Getting My Driver's Liscense NOW?	I just passed the Drivers Ed course at my high school and got my permit, and then after I heard that we could go get the license as soon as we got hour 50 hours of parent supervised driving which I've done already. I have all that and I'm already 16. And I live in Illinois.   Does that mean I can get my license now? I'm confused because my Drivers Ed teacher said you have to wait 9 months until you can go get your license.So who to listen to? Also, another teacher says I can get my license already.   Any help is greatly appreciated and thanks to anyone that answers.

20090220181543AAKjUdK	Cars & Transportation;Aircraft	People quick to blame the pilots?	alright, so everyone has heard about the plane crash in buffalo recently. Also, everyone has heard about the big crash in the hudson.    Immediately after the hudson crash was over, the pilot was hailed as a hero. Immediately after the bombardier crashed into the house in buffalo, there were rumors of pilot error. My question is that do you think that people are more quick to blame the pilots when people die?       NOTE: I am not trying to take away from the landing in the Hudson, it was a spectacular event, nor am i implying that the pilot of the bombardier is responsible for that tragedy. I am using these just as examples because everyone has heard of them recently

20090220203049AAI2Bd4	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	My son has the permanent lite on in the dash for 4 wheel drive when its not on.  How do I get it off?	I drive a jeep liberty, and noticed my part time 4 wheel drive lite is on in the dash when the 4 wheel drive is not engaged.  When I un engage the part time 4 wheel drive, the lite comes on saying its in part time 4 wheel drive.   In order to get it off, I have to pull up the shifter to get into 4 wheel drive.  In other words, the dash says the 4 wheel drive is on when its actually off and the dash lite goes out when the 4 wheel drive is engaged. Do I have to take my jeep to the dealer to get that darned lite to work right.  Also, now my engine lite is on almost constantly,  I thought it would go off when I got gas and screwed the gas cap on tight, but its not working.  Heck, my whole dashboard is lit up.  What to do?

20090220205842AAQq1Tr	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	What would make the engine on my kia sephia suddenly hesitate when I floor the accelerator?	The vehicle is a 1999 Kia Sephia with a 5-speed manual transmission and 93,000K miles.  About 500 miles ago (last month), I had an oil & filter change, an air filter change, and the belts replaced.  Since then, I have filled the gas tank twice.  The first thing I noticed that was wrong was that when I tried to accelerate up a hill in 5th (something I did regularly to 75mph), when I floored it, the engine hesitated and bucked until I backed off the accelerator.  On level ground or a much lower grade, acceleration was not a problem.  The other thing I noticed was over a 20% drop in fuel efficiency.  I usually average 30-32 mpg, but on the two recent tanks, I'm averaging 24-25 mpg.  Neither my driving habits or even destinations have changed during this time.        Any ideas out there?

20090220164813AAyrJSD	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Jeep	Jeep Cherokee XJ....?	How are these vehicles? I'm thinking about getting a Jeep Cherokee XJ...probably not the latest version [2008, 2009, etc...] I would most likely want an older model just because it would cost less. I don't see the point in trying to get the most recent model. My friend owns a Jeep Cherokee XJ and he goes "mudding" with it, you may know what that means and you may not...but it's fun and I'd love to do it also if I do get a jeep. I guess my main questions are...is it expensive to keep a vehicle like this [and the things you do with the vehicle] maintained and have regular maintenance? along with extra things like lift kits, bigger tires,...etc... Just wanting a few opinions and maybe some suggestions on a specific model of jeep.       Thanks. If you have any questions I'll add details.

20090220173025AASBezE	Cars & Transportation;Buying & Selling	Car financing, A little misleading?	Today I went to see about purchasing a used vehicle, I need to get financed as I do not have enough money to pay cash for something, My credit is not really that great, but I went in confident that the dealer would try to find a deal for me. I filled out a credit app after test driving a truck that I really liked. The sales rep took the credit app and returned several minutes later with a credit report, and a form that had some monthly payments and interest rates on it, I looked it over, and then asked the person if this was an actual deal, is what you are showing me the deal that I am going to get, am I approved, YES he said, mind you this is a reputable car dealer, not one of those fly by night places. I said the deal looks great, and he took some more information and then went to talk to his sales manager, finance manager, whatever. Then he returned with her, and she proceeded to basicly contradict everything he had just told me. She didnt say that I couldnt get financed, but it didnt sound great to me, why would he tell me all of that and then have her tell the exact opposite, I know car dealers are like leaches, and jackles but what the hell is really going on here, dont you think this is a little misleading?

20090220174825AAMEhcI	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	What makes a car pull to one side when the alignment is good?	I have just bought a van recently that won't stop pulling to the left.  I have taken it to two places to get the alignment checked and at both places the alignment checked out.  It's also not correlated with the brakes.  It pull the same whether I am braking or not.  Both shops checked out the condition of all of the suspension parts and gave it a clean bill of health.  Regardless of all of this, the van is still pulling to the left, most notably at high speeds.  What else could cause it to pull?  I'll take any guesses.  cv axle, joints, wheel bearings(even though there is no noise)?  What could it be?      It's a 1999 Honda Odyssey, fyi

I was at a red light 3rd in line- the 2nd car backed into me as i was stationary..police were called - but lady pleaded with me that she would pay me in a few day- damage seemed small- plate holder on front bumper very cracked and falling off in pieces. i agreed - needless 2 say she didn't pay when she said she would. I have contacted her insur company * i did get her info*, someone called me asked me what happened,what car was being driven ect..she added that an adjuster would call me 2 come and look at damage and they were going to call the person that hit me.  I don't know what to expect, there was previous damage to my bumper but not at all in the area of the plate prior to this hit. The estimates that i have gotten have shown alot more than the 50.00 i asked the lady for!  Estimates state an alignment is now needed as well as other things in the plate area she it - amounting to nearly 800.00!     This is all new to me so someone please help me understand and have some knowledge of what to expect.   THANKS

20090220185039AAFsbGy	Cars & Transportation;Other - Cars & Transportation	Someone wrecked into my car and I dont know what to do?	Ok let me tell you the whole story.   I am 18, I come home from school and the roads are very snowy. So I park my 98 mustang GT in my drive way. My parents own a business that I work at. I had to go to work(like 2 minutes away) and couldnt get my car out. So I just ran to work in the snow. While I was at work one of the other employees came in and said he hit my car with the tractor. He wasnt told to be shoveling my drive way but he just did it on his own because he thinks he can do whatever he wants and the owners(my parents) dont have time to deal with it. So I didnt flip, I was calm and didnt say much. He said "im sorry and we'll get it fixed". So I wasnt sure what he meant by that.    Ok I have hated this emplyee the whole 3 years hes worked here. He is like 50 or 60 and thinks he knows everything about the business. Ive been here forever so we dont get along.    He hit my car 4 days ago, and hasnt said anything else since that night. I went and got a bid and it was $1340 to fix it.    Here is the issue...since he was using our businesses tractor, that means our business(my parents) have to pay for it!? I dont think that is right but its the law I guess. Should I go ask him what he is going to do about my car? I know he has the money, they drive expensive cars, and are old basically retired people. I feel really bad, and angry about my parents having to pay for his screw up!! I just dont know what to do. Any suggestions??? Please no rude comments! I am already frusterated as it is!

20090220203222AAtnHUO	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Electric fan wiring thermostat?	okay, I got a 66 stang with a 347, I just bought a electric fan from hot rod air. I got everything hooked up, but im facing a problem with it cutting on by itself. I hot wired it, it runs fine that way. But I want it to be thermostatically controlled. On my directions it told me to hook the thermostat control sensor thing into the head or intake. I already have my temp gauge installed into the intake hole. So I installed the thermostat control sensor thing into the water outlet. And it's supposed to be a 185 degree thermostat sensor thing. My temp went all the way too 210, and the fan still didn't cut on. I had to kinda strip the threads on the sensor thing to the water outlet. I need some adapter things to make it fit, or something, but I tighted it down hard. Why wont my fan cut on?

20090220193944AAlDtIy	Cars & Transportation;Buying & Selling	Is this a reasonable car to have for my first car?	My sister's fiancee has a 1998 Dodge Neon. He has taken very good care of the car. All work that has been done has been done by his grandfather (trained mechanic) and he has been up to date with oil changes. I don't know what the mileage is on the car. I know that it has mostly highway miles on it (good thing right?). His mother is thinking about getting a new car. And he is planning on buying his mother's car. He gave us first dibs on his Neon. I basically need something to get me to and from work for a few months while my boss and co-workers, find and fix up a car for me. It something that I plan on driving at least through the summer, or as long as it lasts. Its going to be my first car.       So basically is this a good car to start out on? I pretty much just need it to drive to and from work (50 miles round trip) and occasionally out with my friends on the weekends. So what do you think. Can this car do the job while I get more experience behind the wheel after I get my license?

I showed him everything licence,proof of insurance and the paper work I got from the dealer with the replacement tags placed on my window..   So I called the dealer and told them what was going on, why did this happend? the manager from the dealer is acting very shady telling me hes bearly going to send the paper work to the dmv since I still havent received my tags for "09" and said I should be getting them within 15 more days!   Now is this there fault? What can I do? Can I sue? Can I make them pay the expenses for the days my car is going to be in the yard?   I will be going to the dmv this monday!

Radiator was flushed 3 months ago. A new head gasket was put on 4 months ago (turns out it didn't even need it). That alone cost 675 bucks.  There is no body damage and has never been in a wreck. The horn doesn't work, neither does the power locks. A/C and heater work just fine. It sits with a quarter tank of gas. From what we can calculate it gets about 28 miles to the gallon.

It keeps  doing this thing where while I am driving I will try to accelerate, and my speed won't go up at all, but my RPM will go up really high (like 4) and make loud noises but not go anywhere. I've also noticed my car hasn't been accelerating the way it used to up hills and stuff. My grandpa says it might be the "torque converter". Idk.      Is it my fault?  Is it ruined?      it might also be worth mentioning that every time it rains my floor on the drivers side ends up wet, (not my seat or anything else). From what I've read that has something to do with the air, I just thought I would add it.      Any help is GREATLY appreciated! :)

20090203092139AAFRMLi	Cars & Transportation;Insurance & Registration	Can you name a place in so. California where I can purchase minimum legal auto liability insurance?	I would be greatly obliged if you didn't limit your answer to something like "contact your insurance agent".    For one, I don't have one yet, that's part of the problem. I currently have neither a car nor insurance. For my first car, I want to buy a car from one of the many people selling their used cars in my metropolitan area. But without insurance, I cannot drive the car home or even test drive it.     I would like to buy the minimum liability insurance that is required by California law BEFORE I choose and buy a car so that way I can go to nearby cities test driving cars, and drive back the one I buy.     I have tried shopping online for insurance. I went to all the insurance companies that are on TV plus several others. I came across two issues 1) they base the insurance on what type of car you have, and I do not know which one I am going to get yet, 2) they want to sign me up for complete car and driver's insurance, even though they claim to let me customize my plans.     I do  not qualify for the state liability insurance for low income drivers.     Can you specifically name a place where I can walk in and purchase only auto liability insurance?

Keeps dying but can keep starting. Someone made a comment that the spark plugs may be fouled, so the cylinders aren't firing properly...

20090220213346AAksZGB	Cars & Transportation;Motorcycles	Should I get a Motorcycle as a Freshman in College?	So, I've been wanting to get a motorcycle for the past 2 or 3 years.  Right now I'm in high school, and will be going to college in Florida in August.  So, my parents and I had a discussion/argument about me getting a motorcycle.  They said that as long as I live in their house, and I'm under 18 then I cannot.  So, I was thinking of when I turn 18 in college, getting a bike.  I'm going to college in Fort Myers, and turn 18 in mid october.  I pretty much have my mind set on what type of bike I want to get, 2007 Kawasaki Ninja 500R or the 2007 Suzuki GS500F.  Both of these are great first bikes.  I want to know the pros and cons of riding a motorcycle.  And don't tell me that it rains every day in florida because when I get it, the rainy season is basically over.  I would also take lessons with MSF.  I wanna get one because it is much more cost efficient then cars, and also because it's cool.  Also, I think that it would be very practical in college because I would not need to carry around a lot of things, I'm going to be living in campus.  Not all people get into a accident in a motorcycle, and frankly, I'm untouchable. Just Kidding. So do you guys think it is a good idea, or should I just get a at the end of freshman year because that's when I would get the Infiniti G35.

20090220215545AA8GWCb	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Chevrolet	Chevy 454 Questions - Please Help?	I have a few questions... answer whatever you can, maybe enough people can help that all my questions can get answered.      I am currently looking at purchasing a 1981 Chevy 454 big block out of a Suburban (or some other truck, don't have the casting numbers and I haven't looked at the block yet).    The owner doesn't know, I know I can pull the oil pan and look but does anybody know if this is 2 bolt or 4 bolt main in this motor?   Stock HP and TQ?      Any ideas or rough estimates on power output with 396 heads, airgap manifold and the cam is 280/280 duration and .510/.510 lift? I'll probably set the timing for 100 octane fuel too but if not defiantly premium.      Would the above mentioned setup require forged rods, crank or pistons due to the compression or cam selection?         I am shooting for 400+ hp at the crank and making it an absolute torque monster.

The only problem is that I have a very small budget (relative to most jeep costs), I can only go to about $8,000. There are quite a few Wranglers out there it seems, for that price or better.. but their mileage is around 100k-150k. My main question is how well do Wranglers hold up? At what mileage do they start having a lot of trouble? Thanks for your help!
