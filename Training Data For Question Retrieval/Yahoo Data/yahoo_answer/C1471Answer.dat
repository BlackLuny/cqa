We're just a bunch of chemical processes on a backwater planet. We're of little significance to the universe.|`|8Ddi57v2aa	Nope, just the opposite.  Its the Universe wanting *us* to figure out ourself.  Once accomplished; then all things are possible with God.|`|kM4D8e4Aaa	are our blood cells trying to figure out what the rest of our body is doing?|`|JWjlyztBaa	*inhales*   *holds it in*   *exhales*            that's some mighty fine stuff....|`|s7pqFa1eaa	I think that the universe knows itself quite well.|`|Ny7PHJiAaa	I think we are everything we are not suppose to be.|`|ntdhO8wsaa	You know, Stephen Hawking proposed once that we could be the Universe trying to explain itself.  But he quickly threw out that proposal as there would be no way in for which they could preform experiments to test his hypothesis.      It's an extremely profound question.|`|dDMOJWxwaa	We are made of it.|`|lh8Tn02Naa	We may be a humble part of a much greater experiment.  I like the idea but it's just a tad arrogant considering the size of the universe compared to this tiddly little planet.|`|KT7cllsLaa	As you said..we are part of it  Considering the sheer scale of our Universe, there is a possibility, we are not alone...it is yet to be discovered.  I wish it was in my life time..to learn  how other intelligent life perceives all of the beauty, our Universe is|`|HOQp0gA7aa	I think you are missing a point in this line of thought.  Why would the Universe at large even care about figuring itself out?  That is a whole lot of anthropomorphic reasoning to be applied to what is essentially a huge mass of primarily hydrogen gas.  Unless you are using the term Universe in a spiritual instead of scientific sense that is.      If you mean spiritually is the universe trying to figure out meaning through the machinations of intelligent life, then I think the answer is no unless you subscribe to the concept of a higher spiritual being.    I hope this helps.|`|2059629ba703ea51b813a449b0cb4431aa	You might be apart of the universe, but I'm a part of it. And yes, most of us are trying to figure it out. Those who don't walk around thinking they know it all already...|`|Z92LPUqaaa	Yes,  since we are part of the universe and trying to figure ourselves out then I would say we definitely are.      But is our intended purpose as a species a development of the universe to figure itself out?  I don't think so.|`|Ve18FAnGaa	CAUTION: though highly entertaining, hitchhikers guide... was a work of fiction.  please take a deap breath and begin to repeat to yourself "the answer is not 42"|`|cl4wdRnvaa	That's why I am a  diet pancreas, I mean Deist/Pantheist
nuCXcLUIaa	If your business relies on the attractiveness of the employee.  For instance at hooters, you have to hire better looking women.|`|4kqvnQtUaa	I rater have a Dr that is Butt Ugly & I can bearly stand to look at him, If he is smart, Compared to a Dr, that was sexy & Champion of Beer Pong in college.|`|oVeGMNsLaa	Legally, yes, people should be able to hire based on physical attractiveness.  But then again, I believe people who have jobs to offer in the private sector (but NOT the public sector) should be able to discriminate in hiring as much as they want- in terms of gender, sexual orientation, race, etc., etc..  It's your right as an employer to be a bigot and pick a sexy blonde white woman for your secretary and to overlook the qualified unattractive black woman for CEO to put in an inadequate handsome white man . . . the company will suffer for its choices.    Is it moral/ethical, though?  It depends.  In most cases, no, there's no reason to hire people based on looks.  But some industries thrive on it- modeling for instance.  Indeed, I'm sure it's quite true that clients flock more easily to the attractive, charming salespeople, tip better to sexy bartenders and waiters/waitresses, etc., etc..|`|AA10067344	That would depend on the job.  If you are hiring a spokesman to endorse your product, then obviously physical attractiveness will play a more important role than it does when hiring someone to do market research.|`|E5iFR6BJaa	Yes, you actually can.     Hiring process requires certain abilities and skill to be noticed. If he got those abilities and skill, and while he/she is such a good looking, then it's fine. As long as all other criteria is filled.    But, be careful of putting that physical attraction last after all other requirements filled. Otherwise, you're going to be guilty of the 'halo' effect.|`|kKACyAM8aa	Not physical beauty, like some ones features, but definately the way they keep themselves. If some looks sloppy and unkempt chances are that their work is not going to be organized and precise. Also many drug addicts and alcoholics have physical appearances of looking sloppy. For jobs where people have to be organized and clear headed such as people who handle money, or doctors operating on people, I think it would be very important for physical appearance to play a role in hiring.|`|p00nrT6Daa	I would think that it would be based on the job. For instance, if you were hiring someone to work at Hooters. It would be a job requirement to have certain assets. If you were, however hiring a secretary...it would be a little sketchy to hire them because you found them attractive, instead of basing it on their quality of work.|`|mEftCx29aa	no its not the best person for the job might be the ugliest u think about it do u want good looks around u or success

Everything else belongs to him.|`|IxhQtq5Eaa	Because He of all Beings is Worthy to be Worshiped.|`|SO9zZ7nzaa	No it is not an ego. Someone with an ego problem has it because they are insecure and want to be reassured that they are good.    God is the Almighty and Good and not insecure because that would be impossible, He is highest in the universe. He created the universe, He doesn't ~Need~ to be worshiped. He ~ Deserves ~ to be worshiped because he created all things. (Revelation 4:11)|`|DHBqlri6aa	Nobody knows the answer to this question and you're not the first to ask it, either.  What are you, some kind of Atheist or something?!  Why would you even think it has to do with ego?  God is perfect and doesn't have an ego.  How dare you even mock Him in such a way!|`|AA10265685	No it is not an ego thing.  He doesn't accept worship unless it is done in love.  He wants us and our love first....worship is only one form of that.|`|8PLee1wzaa	Would your mother and father like to be thanked for what they done for you.  And by praising Jehovah we dont stray from truth. Because remembering him is the only way the human race can keep their mind off of evil thoughts.|`|Z8lCw8Maaa	I think your question should have been:    Why do we THINK God wants to be worshipped?|`|xo4iux9gaa	Why do you care....is it a pride thing?|`|VncSMLMpaa	Because He made this wonderful creation and loves us.|`|kM4D8e4Aaa	The Christian God? Most definitely an ego thing.|`|WUjlEuTtaa	God doesn't need or want our worship in the sense that you are thinking...    God desired a relationship with us from the beginning..He walked in the Garden with Adam and Eve..He wants us to follow Him because we choose to..Forced worship is vain and worthless...|`|D9lMg7A2aa	FOR OUR SAKE     From the Catholic Mass    Father, all powerful and ever-living God, we do well always and everywhere to give you thanks. You have NO NEED of our praise, yet our desire to thank you is itself your gift. Our prayer of thanksgiving ADDS NOTHING to your greatness, But makes us grow in your grace, Through Jesus Christ our Lord. In our joy we sing to your glory With all the choirs of angels: Holy, holy, holy Lord ...|`|AA10818712	Because worshipping Him is a blessing to us.|`|e8a42257dd2b34817d2020222ee63839aa	He doesn't want to be worshiped.  He wants us to love one another the way Jesus told us to.    If you are going to a church where the preacher is telling you that God wants worship and not love, then I would get out as soon as possible.  That person is lying to you.|`|NlzlBV8Haa	I think you don't understand what worship is.|`|50UbJp14aa	He is the our creator|`|wZEGi1EHaa	low self-esteem?    goes right along with the jealousy thing.|`|e08eab35a22f0c6bf7f5ba2c6c22c1f9aa	God is our almighty who created us and the whole nature, we worship God to ask for help when we face problems like now, Also we thank God for any good thing we get.    Pray for God and see the differences in your life, Read the bible before you judge, it is hard to follow but you will get peace of mind and feel miracles in every step you go. God bless you|`|AA10894901	Really, isn't worshipping just a business?|`|WalnRzfGaa	If God doesn't care to be worshiped then why go to Church on Sundays? what would be the point of that?    i think he would want to be worshiped because he is insecure with himself. if you read the bible it will show you a Deity that is very emotional.|`|10818851f82ffad5915ce8b2f1c142f7aa	God must be insecure in his power if he desires human worship. Not to mention the constant praise of his "glory" in heaven, all day and night until the end of time.    If any gods or goddesses exist, I doubt they will view disbelief in their existence as a worse insult than religion.|`|feBJEgcgaa	He's got a small . . . well, you know.     He needs support.|`|7i6qj4OXaa	We all need our ego stroked occasionally.|`|0fnzDpKXaa	I don't think God cares about being worshipped.|`|Q4MqzxX7aa	Low selfesteem|`|s7pqFa1eaa	If there existed a god such as the Christian or Islamic one then it would follow that it was a ruthless, evil, uncaring being with massive ego issues.|`|492681182d7c9b1f14276670369e851baa	Well quite.  What would we think of a person who wanted to be worshipped and praised all the time?|`|Ny7PHJiAaa	Because one should always respect their elders, AND IF ONE DON'T.........OUCH|`|b23e3ca87d32dda5732ada9427cb2644aa	No God asking you to worship is like God asking you to choose his love over yourself. God created us and loves us don't you think he deserves all our attention instead of it going to our, money and sinful lives. Besides if you worship God he gives you the desires of your heart because God can do anything.|`|YOWnMp0Xaa	You actually hit on one of my favourite logical flaws in the Christian rhetoric. They claim the only way to salvation is to believe in God/Jesus, and praise his glory and all that, which implies that the Lord requires validation from mere mortals.     Which, as you say, seems to indicate an ego on His part.    But since God is supposed to be perfect, he theoretically shouldn't be bound by petty human weaknesses such as an ego.    EDIT: I see a lot of people suggesting that God wants our worship for our own good, not his.   But what use is worship in itself?  What if, hypothetically, one was to live a perfectly good life and do everything that God wanted of us anyway, yet not actually worship him?  According to Christian beliefs, we would still be punished for that.|`|AA10137068	exactment!|`|i835yPPGaa	Cause he's a prick|`|9CLmGBSLaa	Jon M is incorrect, unless he is going by a book other than the bible. God is a God that desires worship. If we were not to worship Him the rocks would cry out. But just as we worship Him, He returns that love to us with blessings and favor.     And I don't mean He is to be worshipped like he is a tyrant, He is to be worshipped by us loving him, praising him, abiding by his ways, and striving to live according to His standards. Because He wants nothing more for us than happiness.|`|8a959069c9bfd621c3034f08c2890d59aa	Very good question.  I don't think it's an ego thing.    I doubt you'll really get an answer because we will never know the heart and mind of God, but I don't think it's an ego thing.  He does get jealous when you worship other things though.    God most certainly does want to be worshiped.    Luke 10:27 'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind'|`|GWB1R0jQaa	God wants us to love him. Our way of loving him is praising him. He does deserve praise, if you think about it. Making us, and continuously keeping us together, not to mention helping us, listening to our worries (and, occasionally, insults) and everything else.    I think he deserves a LITTLE bit of praise.|`|vAbATcTcaa	do you, as a person, long to be loved?   God, as creator, has the same desire to be loved also, and when we worship, we give him love. Not forced, we give it freely. How would you feel if you had to alter someone's free will, to love you? It would not be the same would it? You want others to like you, because of who you are.  Same for God.

Its so much easier to be straight and similar compared to being gay where your constantly ridiculed for all the rights we want as humans?|`|Y9DCuWPIaa	Bi. I'd like to do anyone I felt attracted to.   I like gay guys, only real masc ones though. That work out and have serious muscles.My best friend has serious arms and I love snuggling into him for cuddles.     He hates being gay. It breaks my heart hearing him say that, he thinks it would be easier to be straight.   I dont think it is.
cPQ7TBcuaa	There were a lot of Italian gangs in America back when we had a large influx of Italian immigrants...that's why he's saying that about the mafia.    Guido is an Italian given name. It is also a derogatory slang term for working class Italian-American.  en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido    Italian stereotypes in my mind:  Food that has LOTS of meat and cheese.  Aggressive, loud, and confrontational (mainly because a lot of the Italians in New York act this way)  Sexy guys and pretty girls...well dressed, well kept appearance|`|WAoNhHB1aa	Well, mafioso (which I dressed up as for Halloween but I'm not Italian - but I am about every other European country) of course, from the Godfather.  Then they say Italian guys are hot - I think I know who inspired that stereotype ;).|`|Onzxe6ysaa	a guido is anyone you could tell is Italian.

Always bear in mind that it was an Italian (Columbus) who discovered America, another Italian (Filippo Mazzei) was among those who drafted and signed the Declaration of Independence, and many others made significant inventions and discoveries like the wireless telegraph (by Marconi) the telephone (by Antonio Meucci) and the nuclear power generation (by Enrico Fermi).  Not to mention the hundreds of thousands of Italians who migrated to the US and built its major buildings, bridges and railroads with their sweat and blood.  You can be proud of being Italian, people who call you names will hardly ever be proud of anything.
FmazIF6Maa	No, can't prove God or souls exist  yet, evidence has not been satifying or conclusive enough    No, no one can conclusively say what the nature of the Divine is, we can only offer speculation    No, it doesn't matter how many people believe in something    It's more rational to believe your own experiences but also to take what other's tell you under consideration    You can't prove any religion, or belief in God at all, is not a mass delusion.

Sweetheart let me tell you something. I AM God.|`|qDYzdz5daa	Don't assume that just because someone doesn't believe in your make-believe, that they believe in someone else's.    I don't really buy into the God or soul concepts, either.    If something is unproven by science, that means it either doesn't exist, or hasn't been researched enough.    However, most of what you're talking about is not UNproven, it is DISproven.   Psi, ESP, vampies, it's all BEEN tested, and it's all FAILED every test.    The problem is that the foolish do not want to accept the fact of the disproval, because believing is more comfortable.|`|m3f0Pa5oaa	Conditioning, dating back centuries and generations.  In days gone by, when the populace could not read or rebel, religion was enforced by Church and state ( think medieval times).  Though the hold has lessened somewhat, each new generation has been raised to rely on religion, and accept what they were told without question.     Now that we each have access to and can read the Bible (and, more importantly, the earliest versions that existed, which are different from the current versions in many ways), very few people have actually taken the time to learn, study, and draw their own conclusions. If they did, I think they might be much more open to other ways and others' experiences.|`|0l9YOgkBaa	Everybody is allowed to believe anything you want.|`|QqOUVukfaa	I think if any1 had answers to your questions... you wouldn't be asking them, it seems you've looked into it allot and still don't have the answer you seek...  which makes me think... you wont until u die.  sorry.|`|9hI653b5aa	I think that there is proof for a genetic disposition to believe in something else,beyond that I am still in thought.|`|4TX26viFaa	Who says pink unicorns are more real?    The accupuncture is real, remember that they do this with animals too, and the placebo effect doesn't work with them.  They do show improvement when treated with it as well as accupressure.  A dog with hip problems that can move the legs freely is NOT doing it because he's supposed to think it's all healed now, he moves that way because there is no pain there after a treatment.    I do think you're rather off base with the 'additional details', it's not a discussion, you're just stating your position.  Discussions are a give and take.

Either way, the imperfect recipient is going to have trouble receiving it, especially if they don't want to.|`|0sOnf2YQaa	Yes, Christians are imperfect.  However, the message they bring was preached on earth first and foremost   by Jesus Christ, God the Son - perfect and eternally existing.|`|rC6gL7KOaa	Because we are all imperfect and God knows that we will accept things better from someone who we can relate to. Just like Jesus. God is a spirit. He knew that it was hard for people to trust and believe in something that they can't see. So he decided to give us Jesus. Jesus was the word in human form. He walked with us, he talked with us, and most importantly he SAVED us.|`|8xP00pKjaa	His message is one of love and forgiveness.  No one is perfect so He came to this earth to show that the only way of eternal life for imperfect people was through Him (the Perfect Being).  so we are asked by Him as imperfect people to spread His purpose to other imperfect people because we can all relate to one another.  Jesus went through many hardships while here on earth, but always made the right decisions. we as humans are here on this earth to learn to be better people and be obedient and loving. that is why He has us tell others about Him-because we are not like Him and He wants us to work together with Him to learn to be more like Him.|`|iHDYncuXaa	Who are you calling imperfect??|`|2bfbda31517a40fd64c290f16464ec40aa	Do you want someone from the military to deliver your subpoena?  I would find that to be intimidating and preferred the toddler personally.  God is perfect and holy, He has done no wrong and the best way to show the power and potential that God has is to work through others.  When the imperfect creatures can testify that God is real through what God has done for them it helps to develop faith and trust in God.    If God did deliver his message personally I think He would get treated like a salesman and we would still shut the door in his face, not wanting to listen.  .|`|214a84419a27f7b719e60de8e61dbd12aa	Everything done on Earth , is thru the (Race) of Man;  When God came to Earth as Jesus, He Walked among us, He Came as a Child: God has set in Motion the Laws of Nature;  Jesus Christ is Qualified to Judge all,He is Qualified to Appoint unto Man Salvation,But Man has to ask;  Romans 10: 9-10  Psalms 115:16|`|AA12284392	Are you talking about Elvis?|`|jaAolejUaa	because the message is for imperfect creatures and imperfect creatures understand imperfect creatures more than perfect creatures|`|wqchA8B7aa	That's the only thing that's available.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	Wrong question and it shows you aren't a serious person.

If that is the sense you mean it then you have to find the correct spanish idiom to phrase this in.  I doubt if "ayudar" is the right way as it would be the other meaning.      Be it that I don't know that much spanish, I trust the answer with "evitar" to prevent, that one makes sense as an accurate translation.|`|GOk8dWAUaa	No puedo evitarlo.     Example:  Spanish: Trato de no comer, pero no puedo evitarlo.  English: I try not to eat, but I can't help it.    "No puedo ayudarlo", like the answerers above said, would translate to "I can't help/assist (someone/something)".|`|STO9qm4Faa	it depends. i cant help would be no puedo ayudar although it would depend on what "it" is.

a79b8a93426576f5d2c9cb6a23ba338faa	I've lived in California my whole life, and let me tell you something - if you think there is one "type" of Californian, you are wrong.  California is a very big and diverse state.  It has the 5th largest economy in the World, so you can imagine how many people live here.    Roughly speaking, Southern Californians are different from Northern Californians.  I have lived in Sacramento (the State Capitol), Los Angeles, and San Francisco - where I now live.  There are conservative pockets all over California, trust me.  California is NOT an easy State to stereotype.      I live in San Francisco, and sure - there are Liberals here, but remember, people move here from all over the World, including from Conservative places in the US, like the Mid-West.  Some of the most Conservative people I have ever met in my life live here in San Francisco.  Most of them are Business people.  There are also many Conservatives living in Southern California in Cities like Orange County, as well as the many smaller Cities.  California is very Conservative North of and including the City of Sacramento.    It seems like most of you think all Californians are like people from Los Angeles.  That is like thinking of all French people as Parisians, or all English people as Londoners.|`|IIhiSprlaa	Most people think I was some huge beachgoer with a tan.

283tO9j9aa	Aww baby bat ^_^    I think that if you show an interest in 'proper' goth culture then you'll be fine. Everyone has to start somewhere after all. At 12, I'm surprised you even know about Bauhaus and Siouxsie, so well done. I think that at first, older goths will think you're a poser just because of your age. However, if you stick with it then they'll realise you're serious.    I think a good thing to do would be to investigate lots of alternative culture- there's lots of stuff just within goth that's very different. Then if you change as you get older, it's not a massive deal because you'll know where you're going.|`|2g8m8USQaa	You might think you have the mind of a 20 year old but your grammar is that of a first grader.    Grow up.    EMT|`|BffKmRoYaa	I know you'll hate to hear this, because I did too when I was your age, but here goes:    Don't be worried about these silly labels.  Be yourself and don't worry about what some "community" will think.  Makeup and clothing make a first impression, but in the end people will either like you or dislike you for your personality, not for your makeup and clothing.  I'm sure you're a very mature 12-year-old but you do not have the mind of a 20-year-old, trust me.|`|aaRMPDIDaa	My opinion - Yes, I think a 12 year old should not be dressing all goth like, but I am basically just basing that on the fact the I think the goth style is just rediculous.  In my opinion, it is the most unattractive way to look.  All that black make-up only makes one looked washed out, and sick, and I don't understand why anyone would ever want to look that way, but to each their own.  Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.     My advise, just because you like a certain genre of music, it doesn't mean that you have to dress the part.  I love the Grateful Dead, and Phish, but I don't dress like a dirty hippie....get my drift?  Be who you want to be, but don't hide under a bunch of fake *** makeup.
rv2Iy1Y7aa	It only takes a second to change your attitude.  Maybe that is what you need to do if you consider your teacher a jerk AND wait until the day before it is due to seek help.  And then to ask in such a manner as you have done?  Do you really expect a dependable and accurate solution to your problem by doing this.  I would be thoroughly embarrassed.

Or, maybe he just ran of ideas...lol!!|`|ATPPWOpWaa	There is no reason to think that Adam didnt name all of the animals.|`|bbEZOoUTaa	where in the bible does it say that Adam named ALL animals uhm?    please read your bible before you post a question you don't even have any idea of what you're saying      All animals around him! all animals within the garden of EDen|`|YYsldZcYaa	Wow- these answers are all over the place...    NOTW- talk about the pot calling the kettle black...|`|GDexucXKaa	And if he did, why don't we have just one name for each animal?   Why isn't a horse a "horse" in English, German, Russian, and Japanese?  Why all the different words?|`|1ABo1ctEaa	LOL. Nice. No one can really answer this.|`|vrFH5AKraa	cause he got bored an gave up wouldnt you if you was given that task|`|AA11647127	Adam means "mankind", in this case. So, it is our job to name the animals we discover.   (This was an easy one. For example, I have just named an inferior animal who is right here, in this section: Magnus Stupidus Givingus Thumbus Downus. Yes, it's the scientific name of IT.)|`|4926be50d60aa020f0fcd455ac2541abaa	The Bible only says Adam named the cattle, birds and beasts of the field. It doesn't say he named any aquatic life....you fail.|`|fY6L4qlaaa	perhaps those animals didn't exist at the time and if they did, i'm sure names have been forgotten since it was so long ago that he was around. but, there are probably different species than there were at that time. when you think about it, yes, we are always discovering different animals but that because they change over time to accommodate to their surroundings. meaning, he didn't have a chance to name the ones that didn't exist at the time, and, that some animals that were in his time are most likely extinct now. hope this made sense for you.|`|aJLXBhoAaa	Maybe God didn't want Adam to have all the fun of naming all of them. Maybe God wanted others to have the chance later on. You know, that when God first created all the animals there weren't so many at first.|`|7kJFmyxdaa	How do you know they didn't get named by Adam? The Bible contains what God feels we need in order to live our lives right. There are many books of the Bible which were not included in the Bibles we have today. So how do you know Adam did not name these animals. Besides, God does not keep anything secret. How do you know they may have been named, but just now being discovered?|`|Ynsow6qbaa	Who say he named them all? Even we have not discovered and named all of them.|`|Kz7BsZk6aa	And how did Noah check them off his list if they didn't have names...|`|z5Wxwtrfaa	god created things, god gave us a brain for us to name things. god has a lot of secrets in this world that we dont know about. never question god just be thankful he never made u a donkey instead of a human.
Ho3lRmDMaa	Well obviously the limbs were sinning. Therefor they should not be saved.|`|9852ceb5b2e40e61d23ad4d12d5c84caaa	This is a very good question.  My guess is because it isn't in God's plans to do so.  It doesn't mean that He can't or won't.  It just means that he doesn't.    And anyway, if the amputee is a Christian - and he / she dies, it won't matter anyway.  When they go to Heaven, they'll get a glorified body - which is perfect with no lost limbs.|`|entRyNolaa	i have a friend who was healed of two amputated legs...they're called "artificial limbs" duhhhh|`|qtXsNipdaa	"why do the amputees get shorted"    Ah, that was just mean|`|4d5247fbc8be95ded60ba90440fe55ecaa	LOL! I'm a Christian, but I am not so sure that God "cures cancer all the time" and such at Lourdes. Life is what it is. The whole point in believing in God is that the spirit is eternal and this life is insignificant in the overall scheme of things, aside of serving as a test of our morality, fortitude, and humanity. So the amputees get "shorted" because via genetics, accident, or tragedy they lost their arms and legs. That is it. Same holds true for blind people, cancer victims, or victims of human depravity. It is just a part of life. Hell, that holds true even if God doesn't exist. Why should it be any different if he does?|`|HDbMh2YBaa	Why couldnt he? I believe he can. With God all things are possible. If he can raise the dead, why couldnt he restore your body parts?|`|c45f2cc9c9ad19623ffd1487918dea73aa	Because there is no god and everyone is fooling themselves.    Show me the proof that I'm wrong.|`|6f1fcb2cfa5061548f6538e313cc26e1aa	Do they get shorted?  Really?  Healing a damaged limb to avoid amputation is healing. Removing a damaged limb to save the life of a person is healing.   Creating artifical limbs to replace those that cannot grow back is healing. Strengthening the hearts and blessing the lives of those who have lost limbs is healing.      I guess it all depends on your definition of healing.|`|ZUlnZvaWaa	Because all that BS that people talk about people getting healed randomly through prayer is not biblical it is not in there at all. They make it up to feel better about them selves, most "christians" don't know their Bible at all, they follow traditions and fairy tales. That is why so many still believe in the catholic made up notion of "hell".|`|RyhluHk3aa	The gift of healing that was in operation when Christ walked the earth, and during the Acts period, ceased to operate when God judged Israel for unbelief, and temporarily set them aside.   The spiritual gifts of healing, casting out of devils, raising of the dead, etc. were SIGNS for Israel, which was the SIGN NATION, meaning that although they were God's chosen people, they would not believe that something was of God, unless they were given a sign. This was true in the days of Moses, when God gave Moses sign miracles to show to the children of Israel, as well as the miracles performed to facilitate the release of Israel from Egypt.    Although God IS God, and can perform whatever miracle He sees fit, whenever He sees fit, the gift of miraculous healing is no longer given to men, regardless of what the Pentecostals and other charismatic churches say.    As a note, people like Benny Hinn are frauds. I guarantee you that James Randi could expose him for the fraud that he is, were he alive. People like Hinn are only out to extort money from folks.|`|bxYWJAYNaa	Oh boy, that was an awful pun!!!    -- "Why do the amputees get shorted?"|`|8ZBsR4Rpaa	because according to christians, god chose to make people lose their legs. he also chose to kill all those african children with aids... he's a nice guy.|`|AA11607350	Ge can't miraculously make the amputee grow back limbs.  If he could, more people would believe in him, right???    The trick is, to have enough faith in God to BELIEVE that he COULD.  I believe he could, but there are reasons that he won't in this day and age.  Again, faith, faith, faith.|`|YkQNSPdYaa	Jesus healed one with a withered hand. And he still does, except none dare ask Him to heal a withered hand.'Asked and it shall be done unto you."|`|d94c5922ce90c815f0ead24d82e12632aa	'Cos  god is too busy punishing those who deny his existence -- god is vindictive, petty and impotent.|`|dDDAbqqhaa	Doctors > God|`|AA11849917	This is old hat, but God DOES heal amputees.  But He won't answer the prayers of mockers, skeptics and scoffers!  They'll NEVER see a miracle from God, and even if they DO, it wouldn't change their minds, anyway.  They would still join the crowds screaming out, "CRUCIFY HIM!  CRUCIFY HIM!"    When Jesus was being arrested, Peter grabbed a sword, and inadvertently lopped off the ear of one of the men there.  He was probably aiming for the neck, but wasn't used to using a sword, at least that's MY guess, because why would someone cut off the ear of an attacker?    In any case, Jesus put his hand over the man's ear where it had been cut off, and he healed it whole.    Don't ask this stupid question any more ever again.  It's only asked by mockers who want to criticize!  And, like I said, even if they DID see a miracle, they wouldn't believe!      Jesus said that even if they saw one rise from the dead, they STILL wouldn't believe, as was the case in Lazarus, whom Jesus resurrected, and yet the religious leaders refused to believe!    People don't believe in God - not because of insufficient evidence - but because they just don't WANT to believe in God!|`|aKiuCi9baa	^ and diseases can be magically cured?|`|LiOOF1Plaa	Because we are not Reptiles, fool.|`|xNaN3VkJaa	*groans*    I'll go with, the stumps are usually healed over very nicely.|`|6KpZ2fIRaa	God hates amputees.

Scientists and doctors do.  Just like the scientists and doctors who reattach body parts or give prostetic ones.  God plays no part in it.  And anyway, everyone knows that if you want a body part to grow back, all you have to do is rub a Jesus Lizard on the wound :p|`|GeoiGjbCaa	@Joe B "God doesnt do anything that would prove Himself out to those that hate him"    Benny Hinn does all kinds of "miracles" for those that purportedly LOVE him.    So why doesn't Benny Hinn heal THOSE amputees?    @Sandy S "I guess it all depends on your definition of healing"    Of course it does. Fundies constantly redefine words to make them look like they answer any problem posed by atheists.    "TRUTH" = Anything fundies want it to be.  ?|`|Eo7KcX3Waa	God does not need to go to Lourdes to perform miracles...He can do that right in my living room , all it takes it enough faith...  Most people do not have the faith that it requires for a miracle of that nature...most of the time I find God using miracle healing for the unbelievers to find their way to the Lord...  More often you will hear testimonies of believers having the elders of the church laying hands on them and praying with them and then they recover from whatever the disease might be...|`|b23e3ca87d32dda5732ada9427cb2644aa	Trust me this question is very illogical. I could explain but it would take to long so trust me and goto this website. This question is a trick question and is clearly stupid. Only uneducated athiest ask such questions. It's one of those if God doesn't do this he doesn't exist. Believe God not me you'll understand.|`|6s6wGCzxaa	Honestly I had to think about this a bit.  Cancer is a decease that causes death.  Being an amputee will not kill you.  Now God did not create either of these situations but we can grow from both.      I read a poem that stuck with me many years, in it people are praying for different things its called God Said No.  Here's a clipping from it.    I asked God to make my handicapped child whole,  And God said, "No."  He said her spirit is whole,  Her body is only temporary.|`|n68tCJ7zaa	ummm, because limbs can't exactly be grown back?|`|KleF4mohaa	Because it is imaginary.|`|ATPPWOpWaa	God doesnt do anything that would prove Himself out to those that hate him.

They didn't believe until they got to see it for themselves and then it was too late.      The same thing as today!  The rapture is ridiculed along with the end time bible prophecies and someday soon the rapture will take place and it will be too late to avoid God's wrath.  God gave us signs in the Bible to be watch for and to know when the coming of the Son of Man shall be.

If there was a man named 'jesus' he was just a nice guy who got nailed to a tree for telling people to love each other.    No resurrection, no ascending into heaven, and no second coming.    It is just as much a myth as the story of 'noahs ark'.|`|AA11188574	The signs Jesus said would happen when he returned have been happening since 1914 with WWI. The evidence shows he has already returned by taking kingship in the heavens, throwing Satan out, confining him the the vicinity of the earth and soon will remove all of Satan's system from off the earth. The bible tells us what we need to do to live in that new world under Jesus rule.

A lot of times women are attracted to men that are volatile because they feel like it is exciting, instead of scary.      I really think you should talk to your friends and find out WHY they dislike your fiance.  Your friends are usually a reflection of you and if they see something wrong with him you should really listen.  Friends always have your best interest at heart and they are probably worried about you and are concerned about what staying with this guy would do to your sense of self.    I'm also 25, and, being your age I think you should really make sure you want to marry someone, especially considering how young you are.  Your family dislikes him for the wrong reasons, it seems, but you need to be aware of what YOU feel.  From the sound of it, it seems like you subconsciously already know this is a bad idea.    Also, talking about an ex is not a good sign, it sounds like your still hurt from that relationship and you probably need to be single for a while to sort this all out.

They were right about him.      If I had it to do over again - I would trust what my mom had to say.  She loved me and would not have given me one minutes worth of trouble in my life.  If you have someone who loves you like that - at least listen to them before you set your mind.  Ask them to be as specific as possible and be open to whatever they have to say.|`|9mLOH7bpaa	Sounds like your fiance has some anger issues to deal with. He should seek help.

If Jesus is the Son of God,is it fair that God punishes his son for the sins of others?|`|zBqt99avaa	If Jesus is God, why did he crucify himself?  If Jesus is the Son of God, is it fair that God would punish his Son for the sins of others?    God didn't crucify Jesus.  The Romans, at the behest of the Jews, crucified Jesus.    God didn't punish Jesus for the sins of others.  Jesus offered himself as a sacrifice.|`|100912340942b82743a18af1cb658391aa	The words "he" and "himself" in the first sentence need to be capitalized.  Other than that you're fine.|`|Q8JeA1eNaa	Yes , i think your questions are correct.|`|MEOjwPCNaa	First sentence corrected: "If Jesus is God, how come he crucified himself?"...you don't need "the God," just "God."    While gramatically correct, "how come" is too colloquial/informal for a written report or letter. "Why did he crucify himself?" is more formal and appropriate.    Second sentence: "If Jesus is the son of God, is it fair that God punishes his son for the sins of others?"    "Is it" would be the correct syntax for a question, not "it is?"..."It is" denotes a statement, not a question.    "Son" is not capitalized unless it is the first word of a sentence. It is a pronoun, not a proper noun. The only exception to this rule is that the words "He" and "Him" are usually capitalized ONLY when referring to God.    Hope this helps.|`|5ee0364dd7d0159e953e987902e16956aa	If Jesus is God,how come he let himself be crucified?  If Jesus is the Son of God, is it fair that God punishes his son for the sins of others?    Thousands of years ago, the death of the sun every evening and its resurrection every morning gave man the idea of death as an offering to the supreme Creator in order to keep the world and its creatures alive. The fact that it happened EVERY evening must have made mankind very sure that this sacrifice was essential, and extremely effective (but eclipses must have terrified them).  Jesus was seemingly very much into this role, played out in rituals for thousands of years. No one can really say what he expected, or what happened when he was healed and left Palestine for some other country, or hid, or actually died...|`|WyjRm10jaa	I answer this question at the other link..

You won't see anyone who is paralyzed with those options, will you?  And how on Earth can being a healthy weight (as in, a weight that won't break down your body and kill you) be "unhealthy"?

That's the same reason we give up seats to people who are elderly, pregnant, disabled or appear to be in discomfort.     If 60% of Australians are overweight, they may well fall into the more common category. Many of them will also die prematurely as a consequence.|`|47FsMLlwaa	I totally agree.

Unless it is a medical condition that prevents you from being able to loose the weight you are just the same as everybody else.

Do not choose the tag of "disability" and place yourself into the same category as people who have no control or choice about their lot in life. Stop making excuses and get on with it just like the rest of the population.    For want of a better term "First come first served".    Perhaps you should look at your excuses and attitude as to why you are having trouble in the dating game.|`|WuhIoS1laa	Because a lot of people are overweight does not suddenly make it healthy.

You being normal realize the lack of judgement in pursuing that dangerous endeavor at that particular time.  Apparently, danger is a turn on for her.  I could be wrong.  Your mom would hate her, , if you have a sister, she'd hate her too.  She's a naughty girl, make no committments, and tell her you don't want a relationship just now but you love spending time with her.  WEAR A CONDOM (if she's freaky with you...she's probably been there with another).  Caution is the word of the day.   If her conversation seems shallow and pretty close to boring, why bother?

cPQ7TBcuaa	Dude, you can't just accept that you are unacceptable to society...that's just not true. You've been rejected a few times and now you are giving up. There are soooo many people out there that are like you...I'm the same way...so is my husband...and we have a couple of friends, and they are the same way. We just don't like people in general, and MOST people in our society aren't too fond of us either. But things are so much more enjoyable when you have at least 1 friend around. You could go to a bar, but you are just going to feel out of place because most people will be in groups of 2 or 3 socializing with one another. You could get into hiking or rappelling. But, believe me, it would be better to try and find someone that feels the same way that you do and you two could buddy up. I kind of do the hermit thing sometimes too and it makes me depressed and want to kill myself, but then I try and call up a friend and we go out and drink or go fishing or something. You should start fishing or hunting or spending time in the woods...I find that to be a relaxing thing to do alone. Or get a motorcycle and start riding solo to different places.

Only dying without having believed the truth about Jesus, is what keeps you out of heaven.  Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation.     The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what!     Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)|`|lVAe2SLXaa	I wouldn't bet on going to heaven.|`|NQnOw4Qbaa	Just don't bet on Pascal's Wager:  It's a chump's game.|`|X1jupF0paa	Just don't bet against God, or you'll find yourself in hell with all the other self absorbed heathens.|`|O1QBA5XSaa	2 to 1 says you go to Heaven.

It will affect your your chance of going to heaven--and I am sure you know it is not in a positive way. Afterall, no one will be thrown out of heave for not having gambled. Therefore if you are serious about going to heaven, start doing the things that will actually get you going in that direction.    What would you say to your child who says they want to be a doctor but don't think it is important to learn to read.  The point is, we have to plan (do things to ensure success) to go to heaven. Our innate nature and desires are not compasses to guide those plans either.|`|4fTiCNiKaa	First we must define what is gambling. Simply put, is the activity of staking something of value on a game of chance hoping to acquire gain. We put money or something else at risk hoping to acquire the money or goods of others who also put theirs at risk.    Why is it wrong? These five principles will help us understand the sinfulness of gambling.    First, it violates the "golden" rule. See Matt. 7:12. Here, Jesus tells us that we should treat our neighbor as we would want them to treat us. But, in gambling, our goal is to take all we can from our neighbor.     Second, Gambling is stealing by consent (just as dueling was murder by consent, and was outlawed in our nation). That is, all agree that, if the game of chance ends in a certain way, they will take from one another. We would not enjoy someone directly stealing thousands of dollars from us, but we consent to allowing others to take thousands of dollars from us in a game of chance. Eph. 4:28.    Third, gambling encourage covetousness and not hard work. The Bible plainly teaches us to work hard, providing for ourselves and for others. And, if we do not, we should not enjoy the privileges of eating and being cared for. 2 Thes. 3.    Fourth, although there may be some who try to make a direct parallel between gambling and making an investment, these are not the same. When you make an investment in the stock market, you are giving to a company who produces a product or a service. Both you and the company have a chance to profit (or lose) based on the performance of the company. If you do not like its performance or have made what you believe to be a reasonable profit, you can always sell your stock    Finally, we must consider God's attitude toward gambling. Gods people in Bible times apparently were not greatly tempted with gambling. It seems the vice manifested itself only when Israel was dominated by heathen nations. When gambling did occur God clearly indicated His attitude concerning it.    During their Babylonian captivity the Israelites came under the influence of people who gambled. As a result some of the captives also became involved. To these people God through Isaiah said, "Ye are they that forsake the Lord, that forget my holy mountain, that prepare a table for that troop, and that furnish the drink offering unto that number" (Isaiah 65:11, KJV). As indicated in some modern translations of the Bible, the Hebrew words translated "troop" and "number" were names of the heathen gods "Gad" and "Meni." To the heathen, Gad was the giver of good luck. Meni was the god of bad luck.    The translation of Isaiah 65:11 by James Moffat is as follows: "But ye who have forsaken the Eternal, ye who ignore his sacred hill, spreading tables to Good Luck, pouring libations to Fate, I make the sword your fate."    E. H. Plumptre, late Dean of Wells, has pointed out that Gad was worshiped as the greater fortune, the giver of good luck. Meni was worshiped as the lesser fortune. George Rawlinson, who at one time served as professor of Ancient History at Oxford, has indicated the name Meni "designated a deity who apportions men's fortunes to them."    The sin for which some of the Israelites were condemned was trusting in luck rather than God. Isaiah made it clear that trust in God and trust in luck cannot coexist. If people rely on chance it is evident they do not rely on God. Isaiah described those who trusted in gambling as "they that forsake the Lord" (Isaiah 65:11).    Hope this helps.

But think about the case of Judas  Iscariot.  He had been so called saved, he was a Jew who was born in favor of God.  He didn't have to do anything to be part of God's covenant.  But what did the bible say about him?  He betrayed Jesus and committed blasphemy, which is worthy of Death.

FtBqmFDEaa	I've heard about iPS research, I hope it proves to be successful for the millions of spinal cord injury patients and suffers of Parkinson's disease amongst other things.     To be honest I supported embryonic stem cell research anyway, the embryos used are "surplus" to the requirements of the parents, the fertility clinics only implant 2 or maybe 3 into the womans uterus each time and usually more eggs are fertilised than are needed to take account of the natural failure rate.  These "spare" fertile eggs would usually end up in the clinical waste bucket if they are not to be frozen for a future attempt at implantation.     They are not miraculously destined to become a "baby" by being transplanted into some other infertile woman who happens along so I think its far better that these embryos, at a very very early stage in the development process, literally a few cells, be used to try and secure a better future for millions of suffering people than end up in the waste bin.|`|AA11174056	enetbaron.com|`|GEfUTyi8aa	I look at it this way... the abortions are there.. if the cells save lives.. take them..... what is morally wrong with that?

Cord cells do not have this ability, thus making them inferior to fetal stem cells.    If so, than I think it is great.  We now have more opportunities to do research that can potentially save millions of lives.|`|66ae930022bf29f4c8379012ac4ae691aa	I suppose it depends on your definition of "moral".  I didn't find it to be "immoral" to conduct stem-cell research using human embryos.  Anyone who believes it constitutes a human life clearly has no problem being delusional as to what a human life is.    And I know of very smart people who opposed it, atheist Christopher Hithcens as an example.    However, I have no compulsion with saying that in the broader context of greater empirical events, it denied an embryo the ability to become a human being.  But in my judgment, the ends justify the means.  The non-suffering of non-pain, by a not alive, non-human, isn't as important to me as the very real suffering of very real pain by a very much alive cancer patient, who is cognitive, and therefore, able to live through every last one of his/her pain-staking days.  These people should not have to die the most horrible death imaginable outside the "Saw" series if we can stop it.  Not curing this when we can, that's immoral.
agwxFmITaa	Sex for money is a quick (in most cases) financial transaction which involves no emotion from either party.  And the thought of selling the only thing your own, your own body, fills me with utter sadness.  For, if not our own bodies, what do we have?  I condemn no-one who finds themselves in the position of having to do so because this is a hard road they have chosen to walk and it comes with too many knocks to mention.<br>  <br>  I have known women who used sex, within marriage, as a tool for getting what they wanted.

bMuwuAVOaa	NO! My friend this a really rude question, and even just a bit hateful. There is much in this life that one must take on faith and for those who are faithless it can be a very sad stark life indeed. Those who believe in Christ are not crazy anymore than you are for thinking they may be. This world is full of many different sorts of folks who think and believe all sorts of things. Just because you do not agree with their theology does not make it crazy. Peace&Love be with you...~M~  * edit) Thanks for the extra information. I do understand what you are going for now. As an eclectic witch myself I use many differing theologies to reach the desired out come when dealing with magic and the paranormal.

They have their own experiences with religion that proves it to themselves. That said, your hidden argument is really weak. For one thing, Christians don't base their beliefs just on "one book." They have an entire history of religious studies, theology, and cultural interpretations that back up their beliefs, in addition to the experience and eye-witness of BILLIONS of people. Besides, you don't have photographs or videos of Socrates or Joan of Arc, but you believe in them, don't you? You probably believe in advanced quantum physics, too, even though you don't have a full understanding of them. You probably even believe in love and friendship, abstract art, have a favorite movie, or like a musician or sports team... yet you can't prove the validity of these actions in a laboratory. So in the end, either the experience of religious people is proof enough for them to believe what they believe, or NOTHING can be proven as true or false, because in the end we all make interpretive decisions on what is real and unreal based on cultural, social, and biological factors that exceed our ability to "reason." And that is a scientific fact.|`|0e5f935e9054573151a3582b5cf18474aa	All I have to say is find your faith whatever it may be and leave others to believe and have their faith.  ;)|`|b6cd9d6fe5a0ec1d495444c45c2b75f2aa	Do I really believe that someone can turn water into wine, walk on water and come back from the dead?

If it is any consolation, I believe in witches and demons. Since you said that this question isn't supposed to be serious, I'll stop there before I go on preaching. (I guess I get it from my daddy, who is a pastor)|`|2AqU4SjYaa	All religions are based on FAITH . . . .    No one is going to harm you or force you into a death camp for NOT believing as we do.       What is known is that the 11 apostles (Judas hung himself) all "claimed" that they saw Jesus, AFTER his resurrection.  One, (Thomas) was even invited to stick his finger in the hole where the nails had been and stick his hand in the hole where the spear had pierced Jesus' side.    Now, that's a "claim" . . . but . . . we know ten out of eleven died HORRIBLE deaths . . . rather than give up their faith and quit.     Would you die for something you KNEW to be a lie?  No.    Would you die for something you KNEW to be factually true?  Yes.    You don't have to believe . . . . but you calling us "crazy people" and "fakers" is proof you are an intelectual bigot.  You are a bigot toward people of faith.      What's it like to be a bigot?    Dan in Miami|`|GpwwpW5gaa	No....Christians are just an urban legend!!      Ok, I'll be serious now.    No they don't have proof, they're completely off their rocker. They can't tell the difference between proof and a book that was written by humans! I find the most annoying thing is when they refer to it as a book written by God, even though it was actually written by a bunch of humans, who, let's face it were probably high as a kite on some magic mushrooms in Jerusalem at the time!    They have never conjured up any real proof and never will.      But this doesn't make them crazy, it makes them stupid that they genuinely think they have proof. But they are still not crazy, they just have faith. Stupid-faith but faith none the less and, although I think they're some of the stupidest people on Earth I do respect them for this extreme belief in what any normal person, like myself, would consider to be poppy-cock!      I don't think they're right but I respect their beliefs. And I respect them as human beings. I only hope they allow me the same liberty.|`|GB3MVI1Maa	Erm excuse me im christian and i dont beleive that stuff, that is really offensive too, i think people have the right to beleive what the hell they want!   and do any other religions have proof?   .... no    :@   :@    :@    and cheese sandwitch u are really an ignorant pig too. this is really offensive! they are not "fakers" . just because you dont beleive in it. this has really peed me off! u are ignorant for asking this question and people have the right to beleive what the hell they want!|`|8ff3196b10cd4c3afc116407535b3666aa	Yes Christians are real, I am one and I'm not a "faker" or a "crazy" person. I do believe that Jesus could turn water into wine, I believe Jesus walked on water, and I believe that Jesus brought people back from the dead. You see this wasn't just some person doing those things it was Jesus, God's Son, doing those things with the help of his father.     Do I need proof? What I call proof you deny, that doesn't change the fact that it's proof to me. That old book has stood the test of time. Sure there are plenty of books against it, if I write a book denying that gravity is real does that mean we will all suddenly float off the planet? Science does not have to prove God because he is outside of science, he is the inventor of science and doesn't live by it's "laws". Have you ever seen a photograph or video of the wind? You cannot see the wind but can see it's there by what it does (bends trees, moves things, etc). Just because you cannot see God doesn't mean he isn't there, I see evidence of him through what he does. Signed affidavits, no, but I have a book full of words of witnesses to these things and have witnessed some myself. Then there is faith, which is something you clearly lack.|`|tGtgbJsRaa	I am a Christian, and yes I am real. I walk,talk and breath just like unbelievers do.

Faith can't always be proven, but to me, this experience was more than enough to prove my faith that i had prior to that experience and enhanced it, so laugh, and poke fun at me and other christians for our faith, but everyone has faith in something. our faith is in God though. miracles are performed every day.  Be well.  ~stardriven09|`|2AoNw9Omaa	i know most of the people are going to hate me for my answer on this one but i feel that i need to express the truth. i am a christian. i have seen the things God can do for me and i am willing to take a stand for Him.if you have any questions at all on this matter i would be very happy to talk to you about it. email me. go into my profile. it is there.|`|qCzd5ekvaa	Yes Christians are REAL, I am a Christian myself and a strong believer in Jesus Christ.    The only proof we got, is if we look at the world and all of God's creation. there are many MANY facts you need to think of, plus Noah's ark is real, it was found in Turkey.  It is also believed that the tomb Jesus was buried in was found but that is still something we have yet to prove.    There is also the Creation Museum in Ohio.    But other then that, there is no other proof. I follow God by faith. It is by faith that we will make it to heaven.    John 3:16 - For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.|`|9vTWgiGgaa	I'm not a Christian but I think they are real just like all other religions and those who believe in them.|`|9hI653b5aa	I think that many people out there subscribe to Pascal's wager...

Simply keeping your sexual orientation private allows the status quo to remain in place.  The way things are presently is discriminatory.  Heterosexuals don't hide their sexual orientation.  Even if they don't publicly display their affection for someone - and most of them do - they still make it obvious that they are heterosexual.  Why do you think same-sex couples should do any different?  <br>  <br>  Because of the issues surrounding homosexuals, it is important for people who are gay to be out of the closet so that the issues can be addressed.   Hiding out in the bedroom is not an option.<br>  <br>  I am not saying that people should have sex in public places.  I am uncomfortable with even heterosexuals who choose to have sex in public.  I am saying only that sexual orientation shouldn't be hidden.  Heterosexuals don't hide it.  Why should lgbt people?|`|ErN3pbTeaa	It has always been acceptable. Girls and guys talk about other boy/girls constantly, whether it be heterosexual or homosexual.

Heterosexuals wear wedding rings and have pics of their spouses and children on their desks and in their wallets.  We always hear about their dates, their engagements, their weddings, their births, their spouses and even their conquests.  We see them flaunting their heterosexuality in ads, in movies, in books, in songs, in poems and on TV.  But God forbid that a gay person has the audacity to mention that he/she is gay!|`|AA11589320	Why do people wear a wedding ring?<br>  <br>  It shows they are taken.

It should be their personal business. Which is why the Church needs to stop minding other people's personal business.|`|ZzYy2szvaa	Who says we do?  You are focusing on the gay couples that DO show their affection or talk about it in public, but you don't actually see the gay couples that DON'T so you immediately think ALL the gay couples are the one's publicizing it!<br>  <br>  Also, heterosexuals have no problem showing off fancy engagement/wedding rings to show their heterosexual marriage, they talk about their kids, and all friends share sex stories among each other, just not in public!  Have you seen any TV shows lately?  How often do you come across a sitcom that doesn't involve innuendos, relationships or sex jokes?<br>  <br>  I think you have heavily criticized the tiny minority that live a slightly too-open life, and even then, they're allowed to do whatever they like - just don't stereotype every single homosexual in the world from a few poor examples please.<br>  <br>  Do you know how many disgusting heterosexual male pigs I have overheard loudly boasting how many girls they've screwed in public places?

How do you think we feel? Our entire live we're basically subjected to people who hate us because we exsist. And you don't have to go to a parade and I have never seen a sign. Except for signs supporting gay rights|`|3BzVOdzUaa	So I have no right to hold my wifes hand in the street like you would with your partner? Love is a special gift it is nothing to hide away in the closet.|`|AA11374522	But sexuality extends beyond the bedroom. It's part of what defines us as a person. If I keep a picture of my partner on my desk at work, I'm displaying my sexuality. If I tell a co-worker about my weekend and include the fact that I went to a gay bar, I'm informing them of my sexuality.If i hold hands with my boyfriend while walking down the street, I'm publicly displaying my sexuality.<br>  <br>  Now obviously some people take this to the extreme and decide to inform each and every person they meet of their sexual orientation. Most of these people are simply attention seekers and, were they heterosexual, would undoubtedly find some other way to put themselves on display. For the majority of us however, sexuality simply makes up a component of our identity and it would be next to impossible to completely hide it from the public's eye.<br>  <br>  Edit: I'm afraid I don't understand what you're saying. How exactly is sexuality being shoved in your face? What signs, symbols, and parades are you being forced to view?|`|zavZn6Szaa	as lots of other people have said... why should a gay individual not be able to have the same degree of public affection as a heterosexual couple (kissing, holding hand...)?<br>  <br>  but if in terms of publicly presenting homosexuality (in pride festivals etc) then that is more to celebrate the way in which homosexuality has become more socially acceptable opposed to actively celebrating homosexuality itself.<br>  <br>  EDIT<br>  <br>  As i said above the reason for pride festivals, symbols, signs and parades isn't to attempt to 'shove sexuality in other people's faces' and 'let everyone know we they have a different sexuality', it is to celebrate the overcoming of the hurdles that homosexuality has faced in becoming more acceptable by society as a whole. However, these demonstrations are neccessary for as long as homosexuals are denied equal rights (prop 8 etc) it is important to ensure that homosexual rights are not forgotten about. Hence, such demonstrations are neccessary in order to change the current attitudes towards homosexuality. <br>  <br>  I think you are being selfish if you think that your 'right not to have it crammed down our throats' outweighs the need to reverse the inequality and denial of rights to an entire minority.<br>  <br>  ADDITIONAL EDIT<br>  <br>  I came across this quote which is quite good<br>  I get sick of listening to straight people complain about, "Well, hey, we don't have a heterosexual-pride day, why do you need a gay-pride day?"  I remember when I was a kid I'd always ask my mom:  "Why don't we have a Kid's Day?  We have a Mother's Day and a Father's Day, but why don't we have a Kid's Day?"  My mom would always say, "Every day is Kid's Day."  To all those heterosexuals that ***** about gay pride, I say the same thing:  Every day is heterosexual-pride day!  Can't you people enjoy your banquet and not piss on those of us enjoying our crumbs over here in the corner?  ~Rob Nash

In fact I'm not sure how to take this question. Are you asking if atheists view theists as such or humans in general?

The program of life must be so simple that its code lies below my understanding. So simple I can't accept it as I am confronted with the complexities. Reducing problems to their simplest terms eases finding solutions. Identifying similarities is the key to reducing terms.

AA10493307	Depends on the type of fear.  <br>  <br>  There is a type of fear that is respect.  <br>  <br>  There is another fear, which is a fear of eternal punishing.  <br>  <br>  One man-made tradition is that "good people go to heaven when they die and bad people go to hell when they die."  <br>  <br>  However, no one has gone to heaven except the Son of man (John 3:13).  <br>  <br>  And hell?  <br>  <br>  Request the booklet:  <br>  <br>  Hell Is A Lie!  <br>  <br>  Free from 8v@8v.com<br>  <br>  Where are the people who have died?  <br>  <br>  They are in their graves!<br>  <br>  "...are in the graves shall hear his voice, and shall come forth; they that have done good unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation" (John 5:28-29).  <br>  <br>  The King James "damnation" is from the Greek word "krisis" meaning separating and contesting.  <br>  <br>  The "contesting" takes place in a second physical life after the 1000 years.

He must not be given to lust, he must not be a sexual pervert, and he must not be a rapist, a highway robber, a war criminal, a mass murderer or an assassin. One who claims to be a messenger of God must have a superior character. He must stand above the vices of the people of his time. Yet Muhammad’s life is that of a gangster godfather. He raided merchant caravans, looted innocent people, massacred entire male populations and enslaved the women and children. He raped the women captured in war after killing their husbands and told his followers that it is okay to have sex with their captives and their “right hand possessions” (Quran 33:50) He assassinated those who criticized him and executed them when he came to power and became de facto despot of Arabia. Muhammad was bereft of human compassion. He was an obsessed man with his dreams of grandiosity and could not forgive those who stood in his way. Muhammad was a narcissist like Hitler, Saddam or Stalin. He was astute and knew how to manipulate people, but his emotional intelligence was less evolved than that of a 6-year-old child. He simply could not feel the pain of others. He brutally massacred thousands of innocent people and pillaged their wealth. His ambitions were big and as a narcissist he honestly believed he is entitled to do as he pleased and commit all sorts of crimes and his evil deeds are justified.<br>  <br>  Why Quran is not from God:<br>  <br>  Muhammad produced no miracles and when pressed he claimed that his miracle is the Quran. Yet a cursory look at the Quran reveals that this book is full of errors. Quran is replete with scientific heresies, historic blunders, mathematical mistakes, logical absurdities, grammatical errors and ethical fallacies. It is badly compiled and it contradicts itself. There is nothing intelligent in this book let alone miraculous. Muhammad challenged people to produce a “Surah like it” or find an error therein, yet Muslims would kill anyone who dares to criticize it.

kVcy1VRyaa	People say that others are not "born homosexual." <br>  Fair enough.<br>  However; there's no proof to say that people are "born heterosexual" either- just the fact that the majority of the population are heterosexual. <br>  <br>  Sigmund Freud believed that everyone is born bisexual- and that it is our experiences that shape our sexuality. I'm inclined to agree with this. Granted that his concept of the "Oedipus Complex" is a bit 'barmy', I'm still inclined to believe that all humans are either born bisexual- or without a sexuality at all; and that we develop one (if we are born without one) over a set period of time. If this were true, it would explain those people that discover that they're homosexual or bisexual years after getting married- despite the fact that they claim that they had no idea at the point when they got married in the first place.<br>  <br>  Anyway, that's my two cents. <br>  <br>  (I did not mean to cause offence to any sexual orientation in this answer.

4sh2oRR7aa	It's not a bad idea. It's not a good idea. It depends on the cultures and the families who are mixing and where they are. In America or "white" majority countries, it's really open and pretty accepted by most. In other countries, especially in Asia, it's not common and some mixes are even considered unacceptable and taboo.|`|mRLYY14Yaa	Sometimes but not always.

They are not likely to get on or have alot in common if their way of living/belifs are totally different.

I still kindof have a crush on my straight roommate and its aggravating but then, I don't live in San Fransisco so I don't have quite as many "distractions" from the problem. in short, you should totally tell him your gay but keep the crush and all signs of it to yourself.

6beL9zycaa	Wow.  That's a whole lotta question.  If I was able to weed through it & accurately ascertain what you're really asking, I think you're feeling overwhelmed by a society that is quickly becoming one you don't recognize...or feel all that comfortable in.  I'm sure you are just one of many who feel the same way, but not sure that you understand or realize the complexity of so many different cultures living so closely together.  I'm not saying I understand it or am always that comfortable either, but possibly for different reasons.  As for anyone dating outside their race, social status, or within their same gender, I imagine that there will always be a very small percentage of people~especially young people, who will do something just for shock value, or to "get to" their parents, or even because they think it will make them "cool."  But if there wasn't an attraction there to begin with, I can't see anyone forcing themselves to have a relationship with someone they really weren't impressed with in the first place.  Does that make sense?  The world is globalizing, & that's not going to change. If you are in fact an avid Christian who embraces that dogma, (& no offense, I am a Christian as well, but I haven't known many who were truly like Christ... to quote Ghandi: " I love your Christ, I do not like your Christians. Your Christians are so unlike your Christ." So.  There it is. If you truly are accepting of others~ & there are always going to be azzholes in any group of people, but there will also be amazing people as well. My advice is to try & focus more on the positive because otherwise you're going to drive yourself (& others) crazy.  It does seem extremely "unfair" sometimes.  Especially when you consider that when Americans travel to (certain) other countries, we are not tolerated & welcomed with open arms as we try to do here in the U.S. But again, there are reasons for that, too. Try to be happy with what you have, & rack up some good karma!|`|SxejtImxaa	rich liberals love to talk about diversity in America .... they love to keep their Mexican in the back shed as he takes care of his garden and washes their car ... as long as it doesn't disturb their 50 acres and other respectful white neighbors .

Whatever one does in one's bedroom is no one's concern, but that of the person/s involved, as long as it is legal (to emphasis).<br>  <br>  However, not everything that Islam permits, is carried out by every moslem, example is polygamy itself, less than 1% of the moslem males practise it.<br>  <br>  Hence even a little bit of moral decency would suggest that, you should see your 'wives' separately indifferent rooms. The Prophet's each wife had her own room. Whom he used to visit in turns.<br>  <br>  "Islam permits a man to have up to F O U R wives, got it??!!'<br>  <br>  Yes i know that part ,but are you man enough to visit 4 women in  a single night? Theoretically, if they all four ask for sex on the same night, you have to comply. Even if you can, for how long can you satisfy four women? Practically in 5-6 years you will burn out, medicine included. <br>  <br>  In addition to the sexual side, you have to give them each the same affection. attention, their each children treated equality and their allowances. You have to be fair to them all, unbiased.  (If any man can do the above stated, then he is a saint).

iAXmdQOEaa	good question and great topic!!<br>  <br>  Ok,  first of all it wasnt a snake that Adam & Eve met in the garden.  It was somekind of creature, then after A&E sinned,  God turned it into a snake.  For some reason,  people think it was a snake at the beginning.    The Hebrew word for "serpent" is "creature".   It couldnt have been a snake because God punished it by making it now crawl on it's belly for the eternity.   So it had to have had legs.....<br>  <br>  When A&E sinned they now know that they are naked, so they made coverings of fig leaves.  God sent an angel down to kill an animal and to cover them with it's skins.   This had to be done this way.  It was the first sacrifice with blood.  Blood had to been shed for their sins.|`|lJ2baVliaa	You are referring to Genesis 3:21 "The LORD God made garments of skin for Adam and his wife and clothed them."<br>  <br>  There is no mention of which animal God used to clothe them, but it is highly doubtful that He used the skin of "the serpent".  I say this because as part of the curse to that serpent in verse 14, it's doubtful that the serpent died at all in the garden... and the animal must die to offer it's skin.<br>  <br>  What some fail to realize, is that the covering of Adam and Eve with that animal skin was the first sacrifice for their sins. Because an animal had to die before they could be covered.  Through out the Old Testament, in order to atone for their sins, they had to make a sacrifice to the LORD. Jesus was the last and final sacrifice for the forgiveness of sins.  Now all we have to do is look to Jesus for our salvation.  Through Him, we can reconcile with God.  That is the whole reason Jesus Christ had to die.<br>  <br>  So my personal answer... no, it was not the snake.  I re-read it and I'm not seeing where it says that the snake was the only animal in the garden... maybe in that part of the garden.  How big do you think the garden was?????<br>  <br>  Litha|`|2o6qrGKdaa	There was no Adam and Eve... that's just a MORAL story to teach people right-from wrong, but too many religious people take it literally.

We are told what happens.  God made clothes for them.  <br>  (fig leaves)|`|ZkBLNj6Vaa	Adam and Eve made themselves fig leaf clothes, but God made them garments of skins.  <br>  <br>  With the previous verses mentioning how God made all the animals, it might have been any skin.  Because the word used was "skins", it might have been of several kinds of skin.  <br>  <br>  Here is a quote from a webpage about a legend of Adam's garments (<a href="http://www.biu.ac.il/JH/Parasha/eng/noah/yai.html):" rel="nofollow">http://www.biu.ac.il/JH/Parasha/eng/noah...</a><br>  "... for those garments were the garb of the priesthood, and the Holy One, blessed be He, had clothed Adam in them, for he was the glory of the world; and prior to the construction of the Tabernacle, sacrificial worship was performed by first-borns.   Primordial Man bequeathed them to his first-born, and so they passed from first-born to first-born until they reached Noah.  Noah gave them to..."<br>  <br>  The garment was said to cause animals to bow down to Adam.<br>  <br>  I'm going out on a limb and saying it was unicorn skin.|`|QyAyQf3Laa	Genesus 1: 24 thru 25 states as Jehovah God was talking to his Son, Jesus before Jesus came to the earth and was born a human:<br>  <br>  And God went on to say: “Let the earth put forth living souls according to their kinds, DOMESTIC ANIMAL AND MOVING ANIMAL AND WILD BEAST OF THE EARTH ACCORDING TO ITS KIND. ” And it came to be so. And God proceeded to make the wild beast of the earth according to its kind and the domestic animal according to its kind and every moving animal of the ground according to its kind. And God got to see that [it was] good.<br>  -----------------------------<br>  After Adam and Eve sinned, this is how Jehovah God handled them...<br>  <br>  In Genesis 3: 14 thru 19 he makes mention of the animals and how he clothed Adam and Eve before he set them out of the Garden of Eden:<br>  <br>  And Jehovah God proceeded to say to the serpent: “BECAUSE YOU HVAE DONE THIS THING, YOU ARE THE CURSED ONE OUT OF ALL THE DOMESTIC ANIMALS AND OUT OF ALL THE WILD BEASTS OF THE FIELD. Upon your belly you will go and dust is what you will eat all the days of your life. And I shall put enmity between you and the woman and between your seed and her seed. He will bruise you in the head and you will bruise him in the heel.”<br>  <br>  To the woman he said: “I shall greatly increase the pain of your pregnancy; in birth pangs you will bring forth children, and your craving will be for your husband, and he will dominate you.<br>  <br>  And to Adam he said: “Because you listened to your wife’s voice and took to eating from the tree concerning which I gave you this command, ‘You must not eat from it,’ cursed is the ground on your account. In pain you will eat its produce all the days of your life. And thorns and thistles it will grow for you, and you must eat the vegetation of the field. In the sweat of your face you will eat bread until you return to the ground, for out of it you were taken. For dust you are and to dust you will return.”<br>  <br>  After this Adam called his wife’s name Eve, because she had to become the mother of everyone living. And Jehovah God PROCEEDED TO MAKE LONG GARMENTS OF SKIN FOR ADAMA AND FOR HIS WIFE AND TO CLOTHE THEM. And Jehovah God went on to say: “Here the man has become like one of us in knowing good and bad, and now in order that he may not put his hand out and actually take [fruit] also from the tree of life and eat and live to time indefinite,—” With that Jehovah God put him out of the garden of E′den to cultivate the ground from which he had been taken. And so he drove the man out and posted at the east of the garden of E′den the cherubs and the flaming blade of a sword that was turning itself continually to guard the way to the tree of life.<br>  --------------------------<br>  <br>  Obviously you can see that it could have been the skin of any of the animals, or plant skin, or any skin that Jehovah God decided to use to make clothing for Adam and Eve when he exiled them from the Garden of Eden. The scriptures do not state that it was snake skin. Only go by what the Bible states and don't add to or take away from the scriptures. This sort of behavior can infect the weak minds, or those who wish to draw close to Jehovah God and his standards; his ways.<br>  -------------------------<br>  <br>  Deuteronomy 4: 2 states:<br>  <br>  YOU must not add to the word that I am commanding YOU, neither must YOU take away from it, so as to keep the commandments of Jehovah YOUR God that I am commanding YOU.<br>  -------------------------<br>  <br>  Don't be adding to or taking away from the Bible; don't introduce myths and probablies, and "this is what he really meant" to the scriptures.|`|7e2dad446deb31af0e15a02d4e75fc9caa	Genesis 2:19 And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof.<br>  <br>  Based on this scripture it sounds to me that every form of animal of Gods creation was present in the garden.....<br>  <br>  <br>  Genesis 3:21 Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of skins, and clothed them.|`|xsuHDhIzaa	i think they were always holding leaves to cover themselves.<br>  <br>  =]|`|ij5Sv6staa	Too bad they didn't wear the snakeskin before they decided to eat the apple....the world would be a much better place!|`|OhhKRahTaa	bnm
lcxkK5MPaa	Brother, Muslims are not the only ones that are muslims....Musalem or muslim does refer to the people of the book. Religions that came from the other many great prophets are also muslims.....So already the majority of the world populations have the truth....How they choose to understand theyre holly book is entirely up to them,for all the scriptures say god is one........and for the jungle people,theyre fathers had made a choice when a previous prophet was sent to them,just cause we dont understand them does not mean they are wrong.And even now down the track ,the holly word is being preached by all religions to them...........So who will go to hell, well those who see(realise) the truth and reject it...cause everyone has a moment of wakening ,no one is spared.......if you do the simple things that seem hard,like stop stealing or lying or one of the many good that seem petty.That in itself creates a wave of purity that eventually wakens the truth in you,to a path of realization. And when the good word comes your way,you will have a chance to choose,truth...So it all starts with being good and pure like the jungle people..........now that you know who the non muslims are,then you know what is meant by the ones that will enter hell.|`|RVWyPicKaa	Only Allah (swt) knows...

They will go straight to hell fire.<br>  <br>  Of the people of the book (monotheist faiths like Christianity, judaism, saba etc), they are for God to decide alone. We can Only speculate.<br>  <br>  'What about people that have never heard of islam, like tribes living in jungles'<br>  <br>  A very good question, my religious instructor have said, say there is a man in the Amazon in around 800AD. As Moslems we know that there was no prophet, after Muhammed (SA). Lets say, the man has no knowledge any of the Abrahamic faiths, yet he doesn't worship the idols and think 'someone' ALONE above is Almighty and powerful. Needless to say he is a moral person, according to Islam he will be considered a moslem. Hence paradise is open to him.<br>  <br>   Reason: no monotheistic faith have reached the man, hence for him, his own crude belief is enogh. Same will be true for the Aborigines and the pacific islander till a monotheistic faith have reached them, ie around 1600AD.<br>  <br>  Muslims, for its all, owes the Christian missionaries this great favour of spreading the ONE God's word to the remote people of this world. No one can deny that. So said my religious instructor.<br>  <br>  I hope i made a point. your question was knowledgable.|`|R4KqEJekaa	We as  Muslims know that Islam is the last  religion is in the world and those who  involves another individual with Allah  will be in Hell With regard to rural areas that have never heard  about Islam at all, and this has become rare at present, this wisdom of Allah so  that the person must therefore consider and discuss even know what religion right and God has given us brains to think with and , we preferred to the rest of the creatures so hope to try to look what is right and what is wrong .what is our aim .that we want all of us to worship only one God and go to the Paradise|`|6L4n6CFaaa	I am hoping not because my whole family are non-Muslims(Christians)<br>  but <br>  Only Allah (SWT) knows best|`|Y9WZR4h2aa	Allah knows best! <br>  Only he knows who is going to heaven and who is going to hell|`|gndbaRgaaa	If you have never been called to Islam than you wont go to hell .

I m Indian and I know the perfect answer to this question.<br>  most traditional Indian families eat their dinner at or around 8 pm. but this is only a reference, the timing may differ if both parents are working and they come home late. in India people in villages generally eat earlier than their counterparts in the cities. this is primarily due to  work reasons. when do people eat dinner in your country?

AA11440601	A summary of Catholic beliefs is contained in the Nicene Creed (from the year 325): <br>  <br>  We believe in one God, the Father, the Almighty, maker of heaven and earth, of all that is seen and unseen. <br>  <br>  We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ, the only Son of God, eternally begotten of the Father, God from God, Light from Light, true God from true God, begotten, not made, one in being with the Father. Through Him all things were made. For us and our salvation He came down from heaven: by the power of the Holy Spirit, He was born of the Virgin Mary, and became man. For our sake He was crucified under Pontius Pilate; He suffered, died, and was buried. On the third day He rose again in fulfillment of the scriptures: He ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father. He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead, and his kingdom will have no end. <br>  <br>  We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life, who proceeds from the Father and the Son. With the Father and the Son, He is worshiped and glorified. He has spoken through the Prophets. We believe in one, holy, catholic, and apostolic Church. We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins. We look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come. Amen.<br>  <br>  For a complete description of what Catholics believe, see the Catechism of the Catholic Church: <a href="http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/index.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/inde...</a><br>  <br>  For an overview, see: <a href="http://www.americancatholic.org/Newsletters/CU/ac1086.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.americancatholic.org/Newslett...</a><br>  <br>  With love in Christ.|`|AA11796124	Get yourself a copy of the Catechism of the Catholic Church.

The best place to start, when looking to understand the tenets of faith is the "Nicene Creed". I will copy and paste the creed, and add explanations in CAPITAL LETTERS.<br>  <br>  I believe in one God,<br>  the Father Almighty,<br>  maker of heaven and earth,<br>  and of all things seen and unseen;<br>  <br>  THIS MEANS THAT WE ARE - LIKE ALL CHRISTIAN TRADITIONS - A MONOTHEISTIC RELIGION. THERE IS ONLY ONE GOD.<br>  <br>  And in one Lord Jesus Christ,<br>  the only begotten Son of God,<br>  begotten of his Father,<br>  God of God, Light of Light,<br>  true God from true God,<br>  begotten, not made,<br>  one in being with the Father;<br>  through whom all things were made;<br>  who for us men and for our salvation<br>  came down from heaven,<br>  and was incarnate by the Holy Ghost<br>  of the Virgin Mary,<br>  and was made man;<br>  and was crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate;<br>  he suffered and was buried;<br>  and the third day he rose again<br>  according to the Scriptures,<br>  and ascended into heaven,<br>  and is seated on the right hand of the Father;<br>  and he shall come again, with glory,<br>  to judge both the living and the dead;<br>  and whose kingdom shall have no end.<br>  <br>  THIS RECOGNIZES THE BELIEF IN JESUS CHRIST. IT ACKNOWLEGES HIS PLACE IN THE TRINITY, RECOGNIZES THE MEANS OF HIS BIRTH, AND EXPLAINS HIS ROLE IN OUR SALVATION. IT ALSO SPEAKS OF HIS SECOND COMING.<br>  <br>  And I believe in the Holy Sprit, the Lord, the Giver of Life,<br>  who proceeds from the Father and the Son;<br>  who with the Father and the Son together<br>  is worshipped and glorified;<br>  who has spoken through the Prophets.<br>  <br>  THIS SECTION ACKNOWLEDGES OUR BELIEF IN THE HOLY SPIRIT. THE THIRD PART OF THE TRIUNE GOD. THIS SECTION INCLUDES THE "FILIOQUE", WHICH SETS US APART FROM OUR ORTHODOX BROTHERS AND SISTERS. IN ORTHODOX TRADITIONS, THE SPIRIT IS UNDERSTOOD TO "PROCEED FROM THE FATHER" ONLY, NOT "FROM THE FATHER AND THE SON".<br>  <br>  And I believe one holy Catholic and Apostolic Church;<br>  <br>  THERE IS ONE TRUE CHUCH. THE UNIVERSAL CHURCH. THE CATHOLIC CHURCH. OTHER CHRISTIAN TRADITIONS HAVE BROKEN FROM OUR FAITH AT SOME POINT IN HISTORY.<br>  <br>  I acknowledge one baptism for the remission of sins;<br>  <br>  BAPTISM IS THE MEANS BY WHICH ORIGINAL SIN IS WASHED AWAY AND THE CHILD IS WELCOMED INTO THE FAITH COMMUNITY.<br>  <br>  and I look for the resurrection of the dead,<br>  <br>  STATEMENT OF BELIEF IN THE SECOND COMING OF JESUS, WHEN WE WILL BE UNTED WITH GOD IN HEAVEN.<br>  <br>  and the life of the world to come.

This means men need to become more effeminate and women need to become more masculine.  This is on a spiritual note.  <br>  <br>  On a physical note mankind can only be whole, or Holy, if everyone has both male and female sex organs.  "And god made them male and female."  We would all have to become hermaphrodites as it was in the beginning when Lilith was created by God.  <br>  <br>  The Alpha and the Omega, Lilith was a perfect whole being and hermaphrodite who decided to have a sex change operation and forever changed the course of mankind.  Lilith became two seperate beings (one male called Adam and one female called Eve).  We are all descendants of a single hermaphrodite.  <br>  <br>  This is the new body that awaits us in the book of Revelations.  This is why both heterosexuals and homosexuals have a strong spiritual connection to God.  In the end, as it was in the beginning, we are all to become hermaphrodites.  Maybe that will finally put an end to all the homophobia.  <br>  <br>  This metamorphosis would make mankind perfect and equal to God.  It would have a profound affect in society as described in the Celestine Prophecy, the Mayan Codex, the prophecies of Nostradamus and the Book of Revelations.

uuQrhnJ4aa	My parents were the same way. My medical conditions were precarious & they took it overboard. As an adult, I do appreciate everything they did, but I also see how extreme they were. It's a tough line to walk between keeping you safe, but letting you have as normal a life as possible. I moved out right after graduation, but they were still enmeshed. They've bonded tightly to you due your condition & it'll be difficult for them to let you do anything. Europe is probably out of the question. The only thing you can do is get on your own once you're 18 & out of school...(if that if physically possible for you)|`|4eaf3b65b8bcd61e0c28ed377fb53935aa	I would do everything I could to reassure them.  Locate a shul near where you're going to be.  Find out if there are Kosher restaurants so they can be at ease.  If you can't find Kosher places, you can take boxed/microwavable meals or shop when you get there.  Do your homework to show how responsible you are.  Make sure to be on top of your daily care and meds to show them you can do it|`|yluVQqcRaa	That is close to impossible. Even after I became 18, my mother stayed neurotic.

I was not allowed to go on such big trips without my parents either at that age and with good reason.But it took me 20 years to realize they were right, about a lot of things. <br>  I know you feel like an adult at 17, I did too. Try to trust in them and that they know what is best and are trying to do right for you. God gave you to them to raise so He must know what He is doing in making them your parents. <br>  Give yourself time to enjoy being a teenager, don't be in such a rush to find your independence. It will come in time, as will the HUGE responsibilities that come along with it. <br>  Be patient and try to understand how much they love you. Sounds like they are at the top of the list for #1 parents. Too bad all the other kids don't have parents that love them as much as yours obviously do.|`|UNsQC0DGaa	they are being protective of you because they love and worry of how each moment they share with you will effect the next or when it will be the last you're there pride and joy. It is hard not to seperate the worries of having a child with a disability from the everyday livings of a teenager each is difficult in its own right. I went through similiar issues with someone I loved with a disability it's not they are being prejudice they love you and want to share every moment with you they can. be open and honest with them, explain that you realize there fears, but your 17 will be 18 soon and that as you dont know what life will bring you want to enjoy the opportunities presented to you, just do it in a mature way and show them your maturity in your conversation with them ( showing them your mature enough to handle the opportunity) and talk to your Higher Power as you said they are very religious and the answer will come to you best wishes|`|BevylvVSaa	Going off to Europe for Spring Break is a BIG trip. Have you ever gone off on a trip by yourself? A weekend a hundred miles away? If not, I can understand their concern. You will be too far away for them to help if something does happen and you have no actual experience on your own.<br>  <br>  How much supervision is there - or is this just friends? Do your parents know the friends? Have they been over to your house so they can really get to know them? If there is no extra adult supervision and they don't know or don't like your friends I can understand their hesitancy.<br>  <br>  It is probably too late now as you probably have to get money in etc. for the trip. But I would suggest you take a weekend trip with one of the friends to prove you are able to take care of yourself. You know you can, but your parents don't. You not yet 18, and they have the right to say no. Prove to them you are capable and that at least one of your friends is responsible and supportive.<br>  <br>  If it doesn't work for spring break - maybe you can go off in the summer....what is happening for college? are they going to trust you to go off on your own???

Nv3eQenUaa	Prayer is a call from each one of us to enact God's will. The Holy Spirit compels each to act and pray in his own way.    Praying for someone in particular is just as much a calling and cause as finding a ministry is for a preacher or a devout follow of Our Lord.    God's word is living and active.   Each prayer changes the world in divine ways.    Even the prayers that don't end in healing may work to spur action that finds a cure or helps others in the same situation.  So pray, even if the one you pray for isn't healed, others will be.   <br>  <br>  Jesus I pray for the healing of Jade.    Give him comfort and strength to be a good witness in health or disease.

They are rare and that only seems to be a recent phenomenon... hopefully a short lived one. So there is probably some of that counter culture expression out there. Most of us are fairly serious about what we do and some are very serious to the point of getting advanced degrees in various obscure fields of scholarly endeavor.<br>  <br>  The mythology, for me and most heathens, is metaphorical. It is a way to conceptualize gods and is not literal. We don't believe there is a red bearded god wielding a hammer riding through the sky in a wagon pulled by flying goats every time there is a thunderstorm. <br>  <br>  It would be more precise to say that the movement is focused on reconstructing or revivifying the customs of pre-Christian people who spoke one of various Germanic languages like the Vikings, the Goths, Franks, Jutes, Angles, Saxons etc. So while the Norse myths are part of the materials used to reconstruct the customs and traditions it is only one piece, albeit an important one. <br>  <br>  The main things that we do are making offerings of some sort to one's ancestors, the spirits that inhabit the hearth, home and natural world and obviously to the gods. These offerings may include mead, ale, food, precious objects (cast into a body of water or destroyed by fire if flammable) In some rare cases the sacrifice of livestock is done with most of the animal consumed by the participants in a ritualized feast and left overs immolated. These various types of offerings are accompanied by some sort of ritual or prayer and referred to as "blot" (sounds like bloat) by most adherents. The other major ritual is called sumble and is a group of people sharing a beverage, most often mead, in a ritual where each person takes turns making toasts following a fairly formalized pattern. There are several rounds with the first three being and in this order- toasting to the gods or a specific god, toasting to an ancestor or hero, boasting of a deed one has accomplished or swearing an oath to accomplish a deed or ritualized gift giving or toasting to a gods or ancestors. There are variations on sumble depending on who is hosting it but that is the usual format. <br>  <br>  The ritual aspects of heathenry are important but the primary expression of Germanic heathenry is in the day to day actions of its adherents.

But the "rebuttal" points to global figures for the male/female ratio. The reason that women are fewer than men on a global basis is the massacre of female children - both before birth and after - in Hindu India and Communist China. Consequently, there is indeed a worldwide imbalance, with fewer women than men. But the global situation doesn't apply to Zakir Naik's examples of the USA and a few other western countries:<br>  <br>  "If every woman got married to only one man, there would be over thirty million females in U.S.A, four million females in Great Britain, 5 million females in Germany and nine million females in Russia who would not find a husband. Thus the only two options before a woman who cannot find a husband is to marry a married man or to become public property."<br>  Zakir Naik on Polygamy<br>  <br>  When the "rebuttal" discusses the USA, it also uses the most general figures without taking state or local differences into account. It is well known that there are many areas of the US that have disproportionate numbers of men and women. There are whole websites in the US devoted to showing men where the women are and showing women where the men are.<br>  <br>  The "rebuttal" also takes offense at the description of the women who outnumber the men as "public property" and tries to dodge answering this by saying "This is simply ridiculous, obnoxious and insulting to women and does not warrant a response." Indeed? If indeed this is "is simply ridiculous, obnoxious and insulting to women" then it is precisely for that reason that it is the most deserving of a response. The bogus outrage that the "rebuttal" takes in this area shows that there is no answer. Millions of American women are indeed "public property" in the sense that Zakir Naik intends and the sheer number of STDs and abortions help establish this.<br>  <br>  Nothing in the rebuttal shows that Zakir Naik is in error.<br>  <br>  And more important, we as Muslims do not have to "justify" polygamy. Whether the kaffirs like it or not, it's part of our religion.|`|VGsSxgvjaa	Peace<br>  Are you of those who believe that man walked on the moon? Time to get down to earth then.

Being gay may be a mixture of genetics, parents (or lack there of), and possibly hormones given off by the mother at birth. And it could be any one of these things or all of them. All of these things would point to it not being a choice.<br>  I know that underlying genes were given down to me from my father's side. His brother and sister are both gay.<br>  I was raised without the presence of my father. Which was not my fault. You can ask many gays and they will probably tell you their relationship with their father was distant or nonexistent.To blame parents even seems wrong because some gay guys were raised with perfectly normal parents. Parents are also incapable of changing how your brain reacts to male and female hormones. <br>  So...basically you are gay because that's just how you were made hun...|`|NwXnzARwaa	Because gay people are born gay.<br>  <br>  Discover Magazine has shown that "Two of the most convincing studies have proved conclusively that sexual orientation in men has a genetic cause."<br>  <br>  New Scientist has shown that "geneticists may have explained how genes apparently linked to male homosexuality survive" and "Mothers' genetic skew linked to gay sons."<br>  <br>  LiveScience has shown that "The arrangement of a mother's genes could affect the sexual orientation of her son, according to a new study."<br>  <br>  Scientific American has shown that "Having Older Brothers Increases a Man's Odds of Being Gay."<br>  <br>  WebMD has shown that magnetic resonance imaging studies reveal key differences in the brains of gay and straight men and women that could add to the understanding of the biology of homosexuality.|`|XjLvbfTZaa	Well, if you didn't choose that only leaves one option doesn't it?  You were born gay.  Most gay people are born gay, anyone who says otherwise is just fooling themselves.

TmjDXY9gaa	thankyou! Im a 16 year old athiest, and its hard sometimes; what with everyone always telling me I dont know what Im talking about etc. <br>  <br>  dont let anyone tell you you're too young! no one is too young to decide their belief. it's a relative.<br>  <br>  im an athiest because every since i was 5, i was brought up in strict catholic school environments. when one of my best friends died two years ago in a bus accident, in my grief, i asked a catholic what kind of god would terminate someones life at such a young age, and they told me 'who am i to question god? if god wants to terminate a life, he will terminate that life. it doesnt matter how young or old'.<br>  <br>  no freaking joke.<br>  <br>  i dont think god exists because he doesnt scientifically or logically make sense, and i dont see how people can decide that faith (which is basically a fancy way of saying that they have no way of proving what they believe) trumps science, which is what civilisation bases it's entire evolutionary and anthropologinary theory on anyway.<br>  <br>  hope this helps!|`|D4jZM26Paa	I probably lean towards Theism, but don't follow any particular religion, I think most humans are able to tell the difference between right and wrong without a religious doctrine.<br>  <br>  Reading the comments here, many people seem to have become atheist due to there being no evidence of a gods existence, but monotheistic religions are based upon faith and have no scientific backing, therefore you cannot use science to prove or disprove a god, you can only base your beliefs upon faith.|`|WmnE8GOVaa	I am an Atheist.

ewWUFWyWaa	In Heaven all you need is a good supply of pop-corn. You will be entertained for ever!<br>  <br>  By believing in Jesus and being “saved” the Bible writers tell you that you will get one of the first seats in Heaven to watch how the vast majority of all the human beings perhaps into the TRILLIONS including your “unsaved” family members and old acquaintances will be especially tormented one by one in a sulfuric lake of fire or what have you for ever and ever. You will be encouraged to poke fun at them showing a wet big finger for them to lick to quench their thirst because in Hell there is no fresh water and you can tease them all you want for ever and ever! That’s HEAVEN! No wonder Jesus said that you must hate your father and your mother and everybody else to follow him, especially if they are "unsaved" and go to HELL! You will hear a lot of “I told you so…” from Sweet Jesus! He thought of everything even some low IQ teasing games that WE CAN ALL PLAY with the damned in Hell! Heaven is for the childlike poor and uneducated so please bear with me in this story written by the authors of God’s Holy Word, the Bible!<br>  <br>  Luke 16:23-25-NIV (Jesus is telling us…) AND BEING IN TORMENTS IN HELL, he* (*Not a gay person, or a Godless Atheist, or and abortionist, but a rich Jewish person whom Jesus knew personally! In those days to be rich was the fad sin of the day.) lifted up his eyes and saw Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom* (*If you go to Hell you will recognize EVERYBODY in Heaven especially your family members, and vise versa!). “Then he cried and said, ‘Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue; FOR I AM TORMENTED IN THIS FLAME.’ (and Jesus all excited and turned on like mad continues the story telling… BTW, at this point you can tell the necessary IQ level to believe all this crap “in your heart!”) But Abraham said, ‘Son* (*Abraham was an ancestor of this rich man! Notice how little compassion any member of your own family will have on you when you end up in Hell!), remember that in your lifetime you received your good things* (*again. in this story to be rich is a sin! Christian preachers now use it to make it applicable to ANY SIN!), and likewise Lazarus evil things; but now he is comforted* (* for all eternity, for ever and ever, and ever! billions and trillions of years…!!!) and YOU ARE TORMENTED!<br>  <br>  Believe it or not, there is hardly any other specific description in the Bible of what else any Christian will be doing in Heaven except for “worshiping” this narcissist Bible God for ever and ever while poking fun at the damned in Hell…!!! Christians need to forget that as soon as God created the Heaven and the angels 1/3 of them were not one bit impressed with God’s beauty and “Holiness” and rebelled against him on the spot under the leadership of Lucifer* (*Light Bearer)!<br>  <br>  The Bible God promised the Jews to be “rich lenders and not borrowers” like this rich man in Hell, otherwise IF THEY DON’T OBEY they will be poor “slaves and borrowers” like Lazarus in Heaven! I know it sounds screwy, but what the heck that’s what the Bible says! That’s why I get a lot of email telling me that not everything in the Bible should be taken literally… short of seriously! Especially the silly teasing words that Sweet Jesus aka “Creator of the Universe” will personally enjoy hearing and watching the Christians POKE AT ALL THOSE IN HELL FOR EVER AND EVER for not believing in Jesus, or for never hearing about him, or not having the mental faculties in order to accept Jesus, or not being obedient to the clergy, or not being respectful at all the Christian religious displays in public places, or not paying the tithes and offerings ON TIME! It will be a long time before anybody in Heaven can possibly get bored! Only Jesus knows what other torments await for those in HELL…!!! Low IQ people will love to be entertained for ever and ever like that… or wouldn’t they? That’s about the only hope that they have on being right on anything! What the heck! It is all in the Bible that Christians hardly read!<br>  <br>  Luke 19:27 (NIV) (Sweet Jesus is very excited telling this other story, too!) But those enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over them–bring them here AND KILL THEM IN FRONT OF ME!* (*Not even the Mafia measures up to Jesus! Christianity surely is a “slaughter house” religion and the preachers know how to profit out of it!)<br>  <br>  Revelation 14:10-11 (NIV) [Jesus says] "he, too, will drink of the wine of God's fury, which has been poured full strength into the cup of his wrath. HE WILL BE TORMENTED WITH BURNING SULFUR IN THE PRESENCE OF THE HOLY ANGELS AND OF THE LAMB* (*i.e. Sweet Jesus Christ, and the Christians who managed to be saved in spite of all the hurdles that Jesus set up -John 17:24 will enjoy watching!) And THE SMOKE OF THEIR TORMENT RISES FOR EVER AND EVER. There is no rest day or night for those who worship the beast and his image, or for anyone who receives the mark of his name." (PRAISE THE LORD…!!!)<br>   <br>  On a second thought I give you my personal view on Heaven and Hell that some of the most honest Bible writers share with me. There is no Heaven and Hell. The whole idea is a religious people control device and a money making scheme banking on human religious gullibility! The Bible writers had God certify King Solomon to be the WISEST MAN ever to set foot on this Earth, and he has this to say... <br>  <br>  Ecclesiastes 9:5,10 (NIV) For the living know that they will die, but the dead know nothing; they have no further reward* (*The grave is the final reward!), and even the memory of them is forgotten* (*Not true in all cases, but what the heck this is God’s word!). [10]   WHATEVER your hand finds to do, DO IT WITH ALL YOUR MIGHT* (*without any restriction just be wise!), for in the grave, where you are going, there is neither working nor planning nor knowledge nor wisdom.<br>  <br>  Ecclesiastes 3:19 (NIV) Man's fate is like that of the animals; the same fate awaits them both: As one dies, so dies the other. All have the same breath; man has no advantage over the animal. Everything is vanity.<br>  <br>  The writers of the Book of Job admitted the same destiny for humankind… <br>  <br>  Job 7:9 (NIV) As a cloud vanishes and is gone, so he who goes down to the grave does not return.<br>  <br>  God, Heaven and Hell doesn't exist outside the Bible...!|`|1VaH8D3Raa	Nope <br>  .<br>  That is a flat out good day<br>  .|`|MU71ihZjaa	That would have to be determined by the result of how  you obtained everything and what they were.<br>  <br>  If they were a result of a godly life, then they were blessings. Otherwise - they would likely be a product of lust and greed obtained from self-sufficiency and not of God.|`|MTi7r9l6aa	I see words, but it just looks like gibberish.

Therefore unless you have attained it through other means it is another way of you being pure of soul.<br>  <br>  However those who inherit it often aren't.|`|MBKuLAmuaa	Yes,Absolutely.

Read the scriptures, they are coming and we live in the dispensation of time that they are coming in.<br>  <br>  P.S.  Would you call it a miracle if God and his son Jesus Christ came down and spoke to someone in our time?  Then directed him to establish Christ's church on the earth again?  How about bringing forth another book of scripture for mankind to read, would you call that a miracle?  Well, all of these things did happen, and the result is the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.  If you want to read about the experience Joseph Smith had go to this link.<br>  <a href="http://scriptures.lds.org/en/js_h/1" rel="nofollow">http://scriptures.lds.org/en/js_h/1</a><br>  <br>  Of course, as in times of old most people refused to believe even when they were told about it.  The question is, do you have an open enough mind to consider that God may have performed a miracle in this day and age too?  Could the story of Joseph Smith actually be true?|`|2MP9nYLdaa	ok lets see, I am now cancer free as I had no chemo as God steped i, I fell out of a tall building when I was 18 months of age and landed on hard concrete and had no mark or broken bones, I was blinded in my right eye by my dad who was voilent but as I had a praying mother my sight was restored by Jesus, I had a huge rock throw towards my temple when I was 15 and came out of it with only a tiny scar. God stoped me from going to prison in 2000 and gave me a supernatural dream two days before and told me I will not be going to jail and it came to pass and had the courts in shock, lets see, God sent an angel to my room in 2007 to stand on the right hand side of my bed so I could see for the first time an angel as I was problems at night, my house was protected from being burnt down when I had the stove on for hours with a fry pan on it, last year I was punched in the head mulitple times hard for a long time and that would have given anyone brain damage but that did not happen to me as this girl was on drugs and took her boyfreind problems out on me.

fL0wHyNNaa	FTM here<br>  <br>  <br>  Going bald wasn't an original concern of mine until a couple of years ago. Being born with a female body it never occurred to me that I might go bald. But after beginning testosterone therapy, my doctor asked me about all kinds of family traits. One of which was male pattern baldness. I've only met two of my close male relatives... one, my dad with fairly good (but significantly reduced) hair at age 68. And the other, my grandfather who was totally bald in his thirties!!! According to my doctor, my hair will likely follow the patterns of my male relatives... I hope it's more like my dad's rather than like my grandfather's!!|`|NMaCcyeKaa	I'm starting to lose my hair.

One-the person you mentioned is violating the TOS.  You are not allowed to vote for your own other accounts.  It is called Point gaming and you can report them.<br>  <br>  There is nothing wrong with answering christian questions in a harsh way.  It seems like your skin is super sensitive that you take offense to other people's questions being answered in a harsh way.  <br>  <br>  I haven't read your question on ghosts but if it was a joke question like most of these it probably was his opinion that you were making it up to seek attention.  There is also nothing wrong with asking a question such as your example or the answer.  Burning a bible is not illegal.<br>  <br>  However you should be quite careful.  It is a violation of the TOS to call out another user like you did.  He could report you for that and get you suspended.  Read the TOS carefully and start reporting what is a violation.  Otherwise if it's just a question that scrapes your thin skin like about burning bibles, that is not illegal and you have to just ignore it.

ky3B42f6aa	Finally an intelligent question.... this one I have been asking myself for more than 50 years.<br>  <br>  I guess it is partly due to "rewriting history".  Most of our beloved Founding Fathers were atheists to the core.  Atheists abounded, and abound, yet the masses insist that "America is a Christian nation".  They must never have read the U.S. Constitution [which promotes no particular religion] and certainly nothing describing how it came about.  But most of it is total and complete ignorance at every level.  This was proved time and time again during the reign of Born-Again Bush, culminating in all those votes for the dumbest "religious figure" to reach international fame in the last several hundred years: Sarah "fruit-flies-huh?" Palin.  Here is the ultimate symbol for the dumbing-down of America.  As one who "converted" to atheism long ago, as the ONLY logical thing to do, I have only one thing to say: "god help us!"|`|2WnbP80Taa	according to your original question, three large ships came over called the Nina, Pinta, and Santa Maria.....

Looking at comparative history I come to the conclusion that freedom of religion and not having a state religion did it.  The English Reformation resulted in a state church which everyone in any sort of official post had to belong to.  For example, Henry VIII had Sir Thomas More executed just for refusing to swear religious allegiance to the king.  This was defined as high treason and therefore the death penalty applied.  For a few centuries any other church was illegal.  You also had to be in the state church to attend Oxford or Cambridge universities (the only ones in existence at the time) - that was why London University started in 1836, so that non-Anglicans could get a university education now that nonconformity had been un-banned.  It was referred to in the early days as a "godless institution"!  Catholicism was not made legal until even later than that.  The result was that with so many people virtually forced to be church members, it diluted the church and that is perhaps why Anglicans/episcopalians have a very wide variety of Christian belief to this day.  It also meant the church was something of a social thing more than a religious organisation.  Certainly in the 18th century, the Church of England was very "dead to god" and that was how methodism started - John Wesley went out preaching to ordinary people because the church wasn't.  Then when other denominations were made legal.  the fact that the Enlightenment and the rise of science had already begun meant that from a religious point of view, the damage had been done.<br>  <br>  So it's all down to history and the fact that you had freedom of religion from the start.|`|jW0VqZcOaa	Anyone who suggest that our country was founded on "Christianity" has never read the Constitution.<br>  It does not make a SINGLE reference to "Jesus".

The only explicit mention of religion is the article VI declaration that "no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States." Otherwise, the Constitution is wholly concerned with the secular issues of defining federal power, and distributing that power among the various branches of government. Quite against the practice of state constitutions, the federal Constitution does not quote or refer to the Bible, does not set up any religion above another, does not refer to God, and does not raise or rule upon religious questions. It is a remarkably secular document for its day and age.

Holocaust deniers are very knowledgeable about specific aspects of the Holocaust and simply negate all other convergences of evidence, they mask these fallacies by using historical methodologies to sound legitimate. <br>  <br>  First you need to define Holocaust Denial- which is the denial that during the Second World War the Nazis and there collaborators carried out the intentional and bureaucratically administered destruction of about six million Jews, using gas chambers, crematoriums, killing squads (Einsatzgruppen) and other technologies, and basing their actions primarily on racial ideology. <br>  <br>  What denier do is fixate on the use of gas chambers in extermination camps (different than concentration camps: Auschwitz-Birkenau, Treblinka, Belzec, Sobibor, Chelmno, and Majdanek) and the estimated Jewish losses which is somewhere around 3.06 Million. Auschwitz alone is 1.1 Million deaths.<br>  <br>  Therefore, if you are looking at the death rates from one of those figures it is not including data which incorporates other methods of Nazi systematic murder.<br>  <br>  The other reason why people might be inclined to disbelieve the figures of estimated deaths is that no scholar has been able to come up with the exact same number.  In contrast, if they did all use the exact same figure, it would raise suspicions that the number would be contrived.  <br>  <br>  Most Historians have shown that with the convergence of evidence Six million Jews is a general estimate, but a sound one.  The figures are derived through population demographics, based on the number of Jews registered as living in countries throughout Europe before the war, the number who emigrated, the number reported transported to camps, the number who died of natural causes, the number liberated from the camps, and the number remaining after the war.  Historians use several methods of calculation to corroborate the figures for each location.  There is variation; however, it is within a reasonable range of error, within tens of thousands.<br>  <br>  Sorry it was so long! but a lot to be said on this subject!|`|MI22i1Bwaa	The figures were arrived at from the Nazis own paperwork - most of which was captured by the Soviets - who had no love for Judaism or Jewish people.  It is also based upon census returns for the Eastern Soviet Union and Poland before and after the war.<br>  So, either the Nazis, Soviet, and allied servicemen who saw and documented the camps were lying, and for some bizarre reasons Eastern European Jewish populations have been engaged in the most elaborate and long winded game of hide and seek or the figures are a reasonable estimation of the death-toll.<br>  BTW - denier is a measure of the thickness of pantyhose, denyer is someone who denys|`|5leLeZnUaa	With the incident being over 70 years old you will be hard pressed to find an accurate answer. Most people will say that "number doesn't matter" and use words like "evil" "denier" "nazi/nazi-supporter" and such if you even have the slightest doubt of the actual number (unless you want to think it's more). But, most of the times in most conversations I have with people, if you deny the number then you are denying the whole event itself. It is true that nazis/russians/gypsies/jews/christians/m... all died during the holocaust. This isn't refuted, really, in the scientific community. But, it is also true that (I can't quote these sources as I forget exactly where I read this) it is statistically impossible that 6,000,000 jews (alone) were murdered during the holocaust. And there's also research into the possibility that Auschwitz wasn't even a death camp at all. Rather, an internment camp (not the best conditions but no deaths).<br>  <br>  These doubts in addition to the clout of the jewish state of isreal are quite suspicious. Because if the holocaust didn't happen then Isreal would rightfully belong to the Palistinians. But, that's a whole other slaughter of a 'debate'.<br>  <br>  Now, I normally hate to give un-answeres to questions. But, in this case I thought I would give you some friendly advice on this topic. It'll be extremely difficult to get an answer but at least your doing what most people wont even dare to do.<br>  <br>  Happy research and free-thought! ^_^|`|urQQ6kbcaa	I'm sure no-one will ever know the true number of people lost.

You might say he was God's hit man. He took out whole cities by himself. He single-handedly killed 1000 armed soldiers with an old bone.<br>  <br>  But Samson had a weakness for the ladies and when he took up with Delilah she seduced him into telling her the Nazarite secret - that he'd lose his power if his hair was cut.

AA11485682	Wonder Woman was carved from clay by her mother, the Amazon Queen Hippolyta, and granted life by the Goddesses.

They show the extraordinary lengths to which civil servants were prepared to go to head off devolution, which was seen then as inevitably leading to independence.<br>  <br>  The proposals included suggesting to Labour ministers, for whom devolution was a manifesto commitment, that progress towards a referendum should be delayed, in the hope that enthusiasm north of the Border would wane.<br>  <br>  Treasury officials also advised that the boundaries of Scotland's coastal waters should be redrawn and a new sector created to “neutralise” Scotland's claim to North Sea oil – a step that was taken.<br>  <br>  One Treasury official even proposed that a local campaign for independence in Orkney and Shetland should be encouraged so that Scotland would be denied access to more than half the North Sea oil. The idea was that the islands would prefer to throw in their lot with London rather than Edinburgh.<br>  Related Links<br>  <br>      * Plan to hive off Orkney and Shetland <br>  <br>      * Oil industry 'needs tax breaks' to avert slump <br>  <br>      * Will auld acquaintance be forgot with Scots? <br>  <br>  Multimedia<br>  <br>      * GRAPHIC: Carving up the North Sea<br>  <br>  Among those advising Labour ministers was Sir David Walker, who is investigating the banking crisis for the present Government. As assistant secretary at the Treasury, he wrote in May 1975 that “progress toward devolution should be delayed for as long as possible consistently with honouring the government commitment to move down the devolution road and containing the SNP lobby in Parliament”.<br>  <br>  Sir David's advice was heeded. It was another four years before the Scots were allowed to vote on whether or not they wanted an assembly in Edinburgh.<br>  <br>  The documents – letters, memorandums and briefing papers from the Public Record Offices at Kew and in Edinburgh – show that some civil servants were alarmed by the threat that devolution posed to North Sea oil revenues, which were servicing Britain's external debt.<br>  <br>  One paper, by Graham Kear, under-secretary at the Department of Energy, suggested that the Northern Isles might be hived off from Scotland. He wrote: “If Scotland and the Orkney and Shetland Islands are both regarded as states, separate from the rest of the United Kingdom, median lines can be drawn to divide the United Kingdom Continental Shelf between Orkney & Shetland/Scotland and between Scotland/England.”<br>  <br>  One way of doing this, according to civil servants advising Anthony Crosland, the Environment Secretary, would be to realign the subsea border between Scotland and England, so that it ran northeast instead of east.<br>  <br>  Mr Kear's doubts were shared by his political boss, Tony Benn, the Energy Secretary, who wrote to Ted Short, the deputy leader: “There is general agreement that energy policy – its formulation and execution – should be a function reserved to the UK Government.”<br>  <br>  Mr Benn told The Times yesterday that he had favoured Scottish devolution. “I have always taken the view that power was too centralised,” he said. “I think you have to determine what it's appropriate to devolve.

A plane has crashed (though this plane is never mentioned nor seen again for the rest of the story), and it transpires that there are no adult survivors. Two English boys, the fair-haired Ralph and an overweight, bespectacled boy named "Piggy", form the initial focus, as they begin to make sense of their new surroundings. The boys soon find a white conch shell and Piggy suggests that Ralph use the conch as a horn to call for any other survivors who might be nearby. Ralph, thus, initiates the island's first assembly where all of the survivors are revealed to be male children, none seemingly over the age of thirteen: "biguns" (a few older boys) and "littluns" (several younger boys).<br>  <br>  The survivors rapidly side with one of two dominant boys: Ralph, and another older boy named Jack Merridew (the head of a choir group that also landed on the island, presumably in the same plane crash). A brief election is held among the children and Ralph is voted chief (losing only the votes of Jack's loyal fellow choirboys) and he calls everyone together to work toward two common goals, the first being to have fun and the second to be rescued by creating a constant fire signal, to be lit using Piggy's glasses. For a time the boys work together towards building shelters, gathering food and water, and keeping the fire going. The choirboys then create their own goal, to become the hunters of the local animals.<br>  <br>  Jack, a bony, freckled redhead, becomes an immediate threat to Ralph's leadership, obviously envious of Ralph's ascent to chief, and empowers himself instead by becoming the unanimous leader of the hunters. Together, Ralph, Jack, and a black-haired boy named Simon, become the supreme trio among the children, going on a short expedition to confirm that they are indeed on an island. Piggy, the most sensible of the bunch, is quickly outcast by his fellow biguns and becomes an unwilling source of laughter for the other children. Ralph, in addition to leading the project of building shelters, feels an instinctive need to protect the littluns.<br>  <br>  Many of the littluns have begun believing that the island is inhabited by a monster, quickly referred to by all as "the beast," that fills their nightmares. When those responsible for maintaining the smoke signal seem to be preoccupied with their worry towards the beast, Ralph calls an assembly to debunk rumours of such a monster once and for all. The assembly, however, turns into something of a riot and Jack gains control of the discussion by boldly promising to kill the beast, again challenging Ralph's authority as chief. Later, Ralph contemplates abdicating his position, though Piggy discourages him from doing so while the two of them and Simon wish hopefully for some guidance from the adult world.<br>  <br>  Identical twins Sam and Eric (often referred to collectively as "Samneric") are in charge of the signal fire that night, though they fall asleep. When they awake, they find the corpse and open parachute of a fighter pilot who has landed on the island, believing it to be the beast and reporting it during the next assembly. In an expedition to find such a beast, Ralph and Jack come upon a cavernous part of the island that they name Castle Rock. Ralph and Jack together find the dead pilot on top of the mountain and also fearfully mistake it to be the sleeping beast. Jack blows the conch to call another assembly, confirming the beast's existence to the others. The assembly results in a schism, splitting the children into two groups. Ralph's group continues holding the belief that preserving the signal fire is the necessary focus. Jack becomes the chief of his own tribe, focusing on hunting while exploiting the belief in the beast. Jack and the hunters, having killed their first pig, gain defectors from Ralph's group by promising them meat, fun, and, most importantly, protection from the beast. Jack's tribe gradually becomes more animalistic, applying face paint from coloured clay discovered by Sam and Eric. To Ralph, these painted faces represent the hunters' masking their more civilised selves in order to liberate their inner "savages."<br>  <br>  Simon, a part of Ralph's tribe, finds the head of the hunters' dead pig on a stick, left as an offering to the beast. Simon then undergoes a peculiar experience, presumably a hallucination, in which he sees the pig head, swarming with scavenging flies, as the "Lord of the Flies," and believes that it is talking to him, identifying itself as the real "Beast". It tells him the truth about itself - that the boys themselves "created" the beast, and that the real beast was inside him and inside them all. He also finds the dead parachuter which had been mistaken for the beast, and is the only one of the group to recognise that it is a cadaver rather than a sleeping monster. Simon eventually arrives at the peak of a tribal ritual at Jack's tribe, pursued by the ravenous flies, and tries to explain the trut|`|eH3Y9U6Zaa	he's the logical thinker

I know that not all girls are homophobic .etc. etc.<br>  <br>  But I think the ones that are homophobic are usually the type of girls that see males as a source of sexual attention. Like they expect all guys to be drooling all over them(even if they don't find all the guys attractive), and when they are around a gay guy they go crazy from the lack of attraction he has for her.<br>  <br>  Just think about it. Girls are always the ones who are approched by (straight) guys. (straight)Males on the other hand, usually have to work for the attention they get from girls. Like they have to pull all these stunts or something just to get any girl to find them attractive. They don't feel that they have some sort of birth right to be found attractive. To be found attractive, is seen as an earned privilige to guys, while its seen as a birth right to females.<br>  <br>  Therefore to some straight females, it feels like they are being deprived when a (gay) guys dosn't pay any attracted attention to them.<br>  <br>  Thats my theory anyway.|`|Htn9lxdQaa	Are they religious?

However, somewhere along the lines of your mom's family tree, there must've been some interracial marriage between a spaniard and a native. That's what gives us "stereotyped" mexicans out "stereotyped olive skin with big brown eyes look". However, our pure natives look a bit more like mongoloids (more towards SLANTED eyes) or something you can understand better, like thai or indonesian. In fact, i wish i had an article i found, stating it is believed that most of mexico's indigenous people were descendants of indonesians since they did genetic tests, but there were similarities, their genetic make up wasnt entirely identical. This might've been bc of evolution. Omg i went off on a tangent here lol So say you're biracial. Half indigenous mexican, half white.|`|syIp6d2Naa	You are most likely listed as being white since your father is. The archaic way of determining race always was decided by the fathers race. The nice thing you are white and Mexican and thus you have a wide and varied set of heritages to be proud of. Ask both of your parents to tell you about their families as far back as they can remember like great grand-parents. Write down things thar are interesting and ask your parents to go through all the family pictures with you and make sure when and where it was taken and who the people are in the picture is written on the back and very edge. I have about 150 pictures from my grandmother and there are a lot of people I can't identify. I'm doing our family genealogy and figured it wouldn't be to exciting as our family never really talked about the older ones or ones who had passed. Imagine my surprise when I found we are related to Bonnie Parker, yeah, from Bonnie and Clyde the infamous bank robbers. Then I found we are related to Judge Roy Bean of the wild west days and his hang them all and let god sort them out attitude. Just recently I found a real skull and crossed bones flag flying pirate that had five ships of the Royal Navy hunting for him. <br>  So you may be surprised at what you find if you look. If you have grandparents alive ask them about the family too I bet there are some good family stories just waiting for some one to listen to them.|`|fkQUCwUhaa	you are mixed race hispanic  or multiracial.|`|oHENw1AXaa	hispanic-american<br>  <br>  <br>  or you can just say " im mexican and american" but your did might be irish or german or italian . so i would find out mor.|`|S6MqrWdjaa	i will say you are half indigenous mexican half white american so biracial.|`|CvSKPHiqaa	half mexican

He learned to be one with the spiritual teaching and to use them without divisions, I think. I am not an expert and lazy in doing research. the book I read , written by a Jesuit father, was the first time I have ever heard of Gita. We need to be aware of others beliefs and men like Ghandi got closer to God who is truth.|`|j4n95V8gaa	Well, let's have a look at what the prophecies of gita says...<br>  <br>  hmmm....<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  looking.......<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  still looking....<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  hmmmm....<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  NO. Jesus didn't steal them.<br>  <br>  The question you should have asked is "Did gita steal the prophecies of Jesus?"<br>  <br>  Well then it's YES<br>  Let me explain it to you briefly.<br>  The gist of these prophecies is that the righteouss[according to Hinduism] will decrease & unrighteouss[according to Hinduism] will increase.<br>  <br>  Say.. is it happening?<br>  Have you ever heard the news that says hindus in order to cleanse & to be righteouss beating up the peoples at pubs in Bangalore?<br>  I guess you have. If not, then read it up.<br>  Does this kind of violence speak much of decrease of righteousness & increase of unrighteousness if people become animal to protect righteousness??<br>  <br>  Well let's have a look at these prophecies in Christian view. <br>  We're getting unrighteouss day-by-day. People are practing what is unlawfull according to Christianity, which exactly fulfills the gist of the prophecies spoken in the Bible. <br>  You must have heard of ISKON. A lot of people are turning to it from Christianity, which according to hinduism is an increase of righteouss people & according to Christianity is increase of unrighteouss people. <br>  So this prophecy doesn't fit for hindus, does it?<br>  <br>  Do you even know a prophecy that is made in gita? People of Kali-Yug will become less than 3feet. Can you believe in such a crap? And they call it the word of krishna.<br>  <br>  Do you even know what kind of character did krishna have?<br>  He stole butter from his house that makes him a thief.<br>  Despite that fact that krishna was forbidden to eat butter by his mother, he did it which makes him disobidient to his parents. He excused that he didn't steal it, but rather took something from his own house. But stealing DOES make him a THIEF & denying it as stealing DOES make him a liar.<br>  He fell in love with radha. He always ran after girls. Why did he do so? Because he was attracted towards the beauty of the girls, he lusted in his heart.<br>  <br>  TRUE GOD never oppose His Own Laws.<br>  <br>  Krishna did so.<br>  <br>  He even had more than 16,0000000 wives.<br>  <br>  Jesus was never married to anyone.<br>  <br>  Who is better? Jesus or Krishna?<br>  <br>  I go for Jesus

KXvjpBjiaa	yes, "ci potremo parlare" is correct. <br>  in this case you can also say "potremo parlarCI"<br>   the importance is that u don't put it 2 times like:<br>  <br>   "ci potremo parlarci" <--that is completely WRONG.<br>  <br>  in general put always the "mi, ti, si, ci, vi, si" before. for example, the verb LAVARSI (to wash yourself) is:<br>  <br>  io MI lavo <br>  tu Ti lavi<br>  egli Si lava<br>  noi Ci laviamo<br>  voi Vi lavate<br>  essi Si lavano<br>  <br>  with the verbs "dovere, potere, sapere" (to have to, to be able to, to know)  "mi,ti,si..." can go also after. exemple:<br>  <br>  i wash myself = io MI lavo (general rule)<br>  i HAVE TO wash myself= "io MI devo lavare"  or  "io devo lavarMI" <br>  <br>  <br>  i hope i've been clair<br>  <br>  ciao ;)|`|m4nKkFDUaa	I think it's "potremo parlarci", as you can't use both si and ci together.

Many people who profess to know God live as hypocrites- say one thing and do another. People with an analytical or inquiring mind ask a lot of questions and find no satisfying answers. Thus, they conclude that God does not exist.Before Jesus left He said that Christians are light and salt. When you consider the depth of these word, you will understand that it is not  just what a Christian says but what the person does that makes a difference. Continue to read your Bible. Allow it to guide you to be light and salt to those around you.The Holy Spirit will use what you say and do- how you live - to the honour and glory of God.|`|5809c406b87c68be7f3c5ecc70c41e8faa	I ain't christian, and semi athiest that my half heart still lingering in free buddism.  But I got one word to you guys that I really fed up to bump into anyone who came from church and asked me " do you belive in god?" when my time was about running late.  I just don't know most of christian missionaries are so blind and deaf that they can't sense that people answer returning to them that we don't buy it or we got another belief  and they wouldn't stop and change another direction to approach next target instead of me.  Frankly speaking, I really would like to spit out of those derogotory words as I knew to them, but I didn't cuz afraid of offending their religion.  But C'mon, life is so short and we, atheist also learning a lot ethical, moral, ettiques from the other resort rather from merely religions.  Plus, we learn not to talk two big taboo topics, religion and politics, in the public.  Seems you guys are really fool and lack of any common sense.  You guys try to persuade us into your world, but hey men we live in this free world.  We born to be free to choose our belief with the right on my hand.  I would not like to challenge anyone to believe any Buddism, but I keep seeing christians do so.  I really would like to speak out " Butt out" or Give me a break.  If you guy really want to catch a lot of these memebers, I got suggestion, go to lockup or jail... there are tons of wondering in this world who do not have any norm in their mind and don't know what is right or wrong.  Me, nehhhhhhhh.... I could learn from the experience of my family, friends, natures and myself.  I could go any temple at any time I want.  If you feel the god is the only one god in this world... I would tell you guys,... you are wrong.  Wake up and smell coffee and look around the world, then you will find out there were zellions of gods in the world where we live not only Jesus who is 2000 yrs old.  Muslim is the most ancient religion, do you guy know that ... which is still existing... and egyptian worship the sun which was sort of god for them... do you know.  Who said human being was only 2000 yrs old... bullshiting.  Egyptian culture about more than 6000 yrs ago... what is ur explaination to this?  Wake up , smell coffee, not diving yourself in only one bible book and to see the world by your narrow monocular to translate it.

Take care man<br>  <br>  let me say this after reading some responses to you. I used to be a catholic and go to church and the whole nine yards. It's not that I couldn't accept god, it's that is don't see how people could believe in something so made up. A god that is jealous? A god that strikes down sinners? or just the concept of a god. We need to explain why we are here and god works for so many. my thinking is, we don't need to explain why we are here and I'm certainly not going to say some kind of being is running the show. It's just crazy to me.<br>  <br>  Also, if you are trying to talk to an Atheist? Don't quote the bible, we believe that it's a fairytale.

Many have decided to not believe and there isn't really anything that we can do about it.|`|6d10d96d77b1df1496e4b66f2f0098bcaa	You honestly believe that you will have memory, thought, perception and emotion after the death of your brain?  And you are sad that we think of that as being delusional?|`|Fdo2G5BZaa	We can not reach them... God has to do that... what we are to do is be prepared to offer assistance to the seeker after God has softened their heart... if they are not open to hearing The Good News there is nothing you can do to open that door... that is between God and them... keep studying and... gently.... offering what you can... <br>  <br>  it took me most of a lifetime to become open to God... many tried over the years to "reach me" but I was not open... it was not until I needed God, and He was there for me, that I became willing to truly listen to The Word....<br>  <br>  our detractors do have a valid point, in that we must not "push"... we are to lead... by example... those God has prepared to hear.
lDqJhxfeaa	..yeah i really do believe in that...<br>  ..i have witnessed or i have thoughts on foreigners who love or like or prefer an asian women...<br>  ..some say filipino ones are love by english man more...<br>  ..some reason is that for them darker complexion than what was common in u.s.a....|`|IvIatEg3aa	Oh will you please shut up.

Good questions today !!!  Thanks !!!|`|GrKiEDb1aa	In September of 1965, I wrote a blank check to the government of the United States of America payable in full for up to, and including, my life.

So help me God."   Even though I retired in 1965, I personally feel that check is still available and the oath still stands.<br>  My life DEFINITELY changed drastically on 29 September, 1965.

When I recovered, I made some changes, some small, and some major. The major one was that I ended my marriage after many years of tolerating a serial womaniser. It was the best thing I could have done....after divorcing him I was able to look after myself, respect myself and learn to live an independent life. <br>  <br>  That experience was the best thing that could have happened to me !

I came to realize that most suffering in life (well, controllable suffering) is caused by our tendancy to take shortcuts in life.  Get yourself right before having kids OR getting married.

That was a change in my lifestyle.  My retirement was a specific event in my life and that did change my lifestyle drastically. It changed it to a better lifestyle by far. My marriage, a specific event forty-six years ago, changed my lifestyle, too. Actually my Sweetie is responsible for that change. I really had nothing to do with the  changing cause I was the one changed.
dPYotwUxaa	So we've got Richard Dawkins, but who was the other intellectual you were talking of?|`|CEs0w0c9aa	ohh i would love to see that!!!!! dawkins would destroy stein as stein is clearly a moron who gets his science from dr dino.  i would love to see that. the problem is dawkins would destroy stein so badly you'd end up feeling a little bit guilty. But hey whats wrong with a bit of a laugh at a creationists expense.|`|P7M7eco3aa	I would prefer to see a Dawkins -Chomsky match.<br>  I think Noam would "body slam" "The Dawkster" with his analytical abilities.|`|7a1853a34fef93b27c82b0bacf06c7c6aa	both are dorks|`|9BeUbORtaa	I rather like Dawkins, for all the fact that he clearly knows as much about religion as I do about molecular biology (which would be virtually nothing). Stein appears to be a waste of space. (Sorry to break up the Dawkins circle-jerk here - it's true that when people stop believing in religion, they believe anything). <br>  <br>  Dawkins is scrappy and has ridiculous hair. Stein is pudgy and has a ridiculous face. Both of them wear glasses. It's hard to say who would win in a fight. I'm inclined to favour Dawkins. Stein looks like he'd be slow on his feet.

XsTJPMHqaa	You can wash them off as you leave the Church. There's no requirment.<br>  <br>  Many choose to wear them for longer. Most people I know wear them all day. I do, and the reactions are either one of two things: "You have dirt on your forehead" or "Oh, it's Ash Wednesday!"|`|bXeHr69Vaa	it'll wear off naturally, don't be scared to tell people if asked|`|LYnuEdKUaa	Typically, they are supposed to be left on for the rest of the day unless your job means having to remove it. It would, for example, be unsanitary for a surgeon to leave on.  But - there are no official rules that says that it must stay there for any length of time.  I would suggest that you leave them on as long as possible and offer up the mild itchiness and the strange looks to God.|`|AA11466759	I have absolutely no idea.

Have you ever gotten a group of committee members to ever agree on anything?

I translate it "逍", in English means "free and unfettered ".

GAUnlXUfaa	I'm Muslim and would love to support my answer from a Holy Quran Verse that says : ?????? ????? ???? ????? which means we should keep the love and care in our hearts and share it with the ppl we know and strangers..it isnt specified for certain ppl...its for everybody no matter how different their age,race or religion is...our religion says if you even send your love to strangers God will give you more credits..i believe this is LOGIC since the ppl we know are always surrounded by our love..y not to give it to strangers?! :)<br>  so SPREAD LOVE AROUND WHEREVER U GO and YESSSS IT WORKS BIG TIME :D|`|CueEJOVFaa	If prayer works, all prayer works the same. Or to put it another way, if a god exists and this god is benevolent, that means this god would be more willing to grant a prayer for strangers than for family or for self, no?<br>  <br>  "no, prayer is suppose to be about thanking and praising, so praying for someone doesn't work."<br>  <br>  In the Christian view, that simply isn't the case. There is something called petitionary prayer, where the person praying asks God for something. Jesus, for example, prayed for his disciples (past and present).|`|1ec32bd76f3584208ce83bf42928a21faa	Prayer for any third party is intercession.  You intercede on behalf of others with the intention that God would intervene on their behalf.  It works when it is in accordance with God's will.  God bless you.|`|xxEhpytpaa	We may not know their names and sometimes for us this is important, but not necessary, for God know who we are praying for and will direct the prayers in the right direction. God bless you.|`|XKhNw221aa	no, prayer is suppose to be about thanking and praising, so praying for someone doesn't work.|`|LQsh261waa	It works the same way, remember GOD knows you're heart so he knows who it is you're praying for.|`|yEMRPW1Aaa	it helps i even pray for people that arn't love ones sometimes. and i know it will work.|`|rNaIRu4baa	Praying is a way to ask God for a miracle. Whether you are christian, catholic, jewish, or even muslim, you pray to your god asking him/her to intervene divinely either into your life, or the person's you are praying for.<br>  <br>  Now prayer for those who have already passed is mostly done by the catholics. It comes from the dogmatic idea of purgatory, which is a limbo between heaven and hell were souls go when they are not yet spiritually ready for entrance into Heaven. The catholics believe that by praying for their dead, they somehow help the person in their spiritual development while in purgatory.<br>  <br>  People of other faiths who do not believe in purgatory usually pray for the dead for a sense of comfort and a sense of an ongoing connection. I know my mother does this. She doesn't believe in Yahweh but she does believe that her brother is watching over her, and talks to him as if he were.<br>  <br>  Prayer is what you make of it, plain and simple.|`|WYk0zYdhaa	Speaking from a Christian perspective.. yes.  Prayer is powerful even if you don't know the person's name or praying for a situation.  We serve an all knowing God (omniscient) who knows before we speak.  He is also all powerful (omnipotent) and able to be everywhere at once (omnipresent).  He doesn't need us to know the person.  <br>  <br>  The main thing is knowing who you are praying to;)  I have a step mother, a self proclaimed agnostic and when she says she's praying it worries me...since she doesn't know lol.  Or the other way around non-believers ask for prayer?  My own mom prays to demons so yeah those probably not so good;)  Know who you are praying to.|`|fjidmhxsaa	First, remember that in John 14:13 Jesus says, “And whatever you ask... “Often we wonder, “What can I pray for? How much can I pray for?” But when Jesus encourages us to pray, He always uses limitless language — “whatever you ask.” Some of us pray as though God had just declared bankruptcy, but I believe that He is honored and glorified when we ask for bigger things of Him.<br>  <br>  Again in James 5:15-16 God declares - And the prayer of faith will restore the sick man, and the Lord will raise him up to health; and if he has committed sins, they shall be forgiven. <br>  Therefore confess your sins to one another, and pray for one another, <br>  <br>  I personally think its all about faith.|`|7dad943aeb0eea9ef53ff4446976257baa	Yes it does if you pray with absolute faith in God. I believe there are two primary areas where people miss the mark with prayer. They are that:<br>  <br>   they, on many occasions tell God what needs to be done and how to solve the problem put before God. Thus it becomes not a prayer of humility but one of arrogancy, this does not prevent God from answering the prayer but rather prevents us from hearing Gods response.<br>  <br>  The other is that they try to hedge their bets by giving God a way out. Here there is a lack of faith.<br>  <br>  James has a lot to say on this is a very short Gospel. Basiclly the essessence to prayer is:<br>  <br>  James 1:6  But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.<br>  James 1:7  For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.<br>   Jesus simplified it even further by stating "pray as though you have already received. In his example of prayer the basic needs of pray are there for all to see if they have eyes. Many miss the mark by the constant repeation of the prayer given as an example by Jesus the Christ. He did not direct that we repeat his words verbatim but to follow the example structure. Praise God, give God the problem having absolute faith that God will solve your problem.<br>  <br>  Un realsitic faith you may say. Not so we exercise that faith every time we step on board any form of transport believing that those who should have done their job have done it.|`|PlVMilvxaa	I think your question should not be who but what. Prayer is about sincerity. Sincere prayers are answered. But think of it this way, if you had a friend that had the power to do anything and you SINCERELY asked him to look out for Bob's friend (whom you don't know), your friend would probably do it! So it works!!|`|F1ug1Emzaa	priests pray for everyone ppl they no and don't no<br>  it doesn't matter if you no them or not its the thought that counts<br>  the more people praying the better|`|LcRLwwSmaa	"It all comes down to your intentions..."|`|NmG1FFSRaa	Gods not stupid, he knows who needs that prayer even if you don't
FhHklqkhaa	I agree that the christian right had this coming<br>  there are many groups that fight for equality|`|lDEGaK7Laa	Gay people marched around the Mormon Temple in Salt Lake City after Prop. 8 passed. That's the same thing.
VhtyM9Bpaa	In my opinion, the best relationship is one where both people agree to "suspend disbelief".  People, to be honest, are not all that attractive, they're not exotic, and they're not sexy.  Even the most beautiful woman in the world can become homely to someone that's used to her.<br>  <br>  But... if both people agree to "suspend disbelief", we can get around this.  Romantic comedies show us what everyone really wants in a relationship.  They show us unrealistic relationships, where magical moments happen, and the two main characters experience things that typically do not happen.  At best, a couple may have such moments once in their lives.<br>  <br>  But if both people are willing to "pretend" that their romance is like a romantic comedy, it can be magical.  It takes trust between both people, because at one point or another, you're going to have be pretty corny.  :)<br>  <br>  But if both of you can delve into your romance, no matter how corny or unrealistic it may be, your life can be a fairytale.<br>  <br>  The unfortunate thing is, most people eventually lose the moment.  They lose the ability to "suspend disbelief".   At that point, the relationship is reduced to a friendship.  <br>  <br>  As for myself, I've done this.  But I have yet to find a woman that was able to keep the romance alive more than a few months.  :)<br>  <br>  To your point though, yes... everyone wants what they can't have.  But that's very temporary.  After a few days, the "bad boy" or the "untouchable girl" become humdrum.|`|CnqGu1Taaa	I'm a good person and I get asked out quite a bit but normally turn 'em down............. after the first few dates,most men want to play grabb a-$-$|`|bK5MJCxhaa	I don't know about that.  My husband is a very honest and sincere man.  We've been married for over 20 years and I still have a crush on him.  I'm quite sure the feeling is mutual.<br>  <br>  I think it's easier for honest and sincere people to form long-term, romantic relationships.<br>  <br>  Don't go by movies.  A good movie needs drama and conflict, a good relationship doesn't.<br>  <br>  ADDED: Listen to what Maurice H has to say.  He's right on the money.|`|2MP9nYLdaa	so many people do not include God in this so of course it will end in disaster.|`|g4AAZRuxaa	Yes you are right.|`|yp8y1jrCaa	I think romance is as individual as each person is. Some might want to be "swept off their feet" while another person might consider understanding as romantic, still others may want someone know what to do or take the initiative without having to explain everything in detail. <br>  <br>  Whether you're a "quiet" person or whether you're "loud and boisterous", each person is worthy of having romance in their life, at some point.<br>  <br>  If you haven't experienced romance in this lifetime, yet ... then you may not be with the right person, or you may not have met your soulmate yet. <br>  <br>  I, myself, wouldn't enjoy someone telling me "yes" all the time, but a greater comprehension to my thoughts and ideas would be appreciated. <br>  <br>  Good luck on your journey.   ???|`|XHCoIo3zaa	It is not harder for honest people to be in a romantic relationship.  Assuming people are mature, I actually think it is easier if two people are honest with each other to fall in love than if one or the other is deceitful. A dishonest person usually is not interested in a meaningful life, much less the welfare of a potential partner.|`|a9r82MRIaa	Around where I live, there's what I call a "mating ritual" among what are called "chavs".

If someone is confident but still good hearted they have a better chance than the nice person who doesn't have the courage to ask anyone out.<br>  <br>  Once in the relationship though you're right that sometimes a predictable person can be boring...The nice person can provide stability and that is reassuring from someone you love but there also needs to be a certain amount of sponteneity and willingness to change for any relationship to last.  My husband is the "nice guy" who never really had girls and that's what originally attracted me to him 6 years ago...his stability and his level of devotion...but 6 years down the line I do sometimes feel that he is too predictable.  Not that our relationship is ruined we just need to work harder to keep things fresh.<br>  <br>  That's my opinion though...|`|H24DtUKOaa	I am an honest person. I do stupid things sometimes, and I am VERY unpredictable, but I am an honest person. My girlfriend is sweet, beautiful, funny, lively (I could go on)... so I very much disagree with the title.

She was gorgeous, but that didn't do the trick - excitement fuels lust.<br>  <br>  I know plenty of good-hearted girls who I'd happily be with, but good-hearted isn't the same term as predictable. Girls love it when you turn up at their door with flowers after school/work, or if you take them somewhere random just for the hell of it, or if you do 'something else' to spice things up a bit without telling them. Excitement fuels lust, and lust is one of the many factors that fuels love, in my opinion<br>  <br>  So no, it's not harder for honest, sincere people to be in a romantic relationship. Just make sure to try new things and be... exciting!<br>  <br>  Max|`|XTyAMS5yaa	Not to be stereotypical or anything of the such, but a lot of girls (in my experience) usually go for the hotter guys. And since I'm less attractive than compost I'm usually last in line in a attractive contest. Now while not every hot guy is like this, the vast majority that I've seen are @sswipes, so the girls usually get hurt. And most of the uglier guys are nice (once again not always the case) so when we try and comfort the girls, we go into the friend zone and they go back out to get hurt again. It's an endless cycle that won't stop until the girl realizes that looks aren't everything, and after being used, abused, and everything in between, finally looks at the less attractive of guys and realizes that nice guys are better.|`|JOankL0eaa	Put the movies down and walk away. <br>  <br>  Movies =/= reality. <br>  <br>  A lot of boring, predictable people find partners.

Just because our hearts are good, people (especially men) see this as an opportunity to run over the person's feelings.  It's happened to me a few times.  I now pray to God to give me the resources I need to live and REMOVE any emotional feelings I have towards men cause they are not worthy...anymore.  I just want to serve God and be a good human being.  And I feel there are more ways of being fulfilled other than necessary having a significant other in your life.  I look at it this way, you have to have the energy to nurture a relationship and after all the effort if a guy cheats on you then its a cycle that I no longer want to be a part of.  So to answer you question yes it is harder for pure good hearted people not to get screwed over when dating.|`|ow2gVYeqaa	This type of question is similar to "Why are bad people succesful and many good people aren't" or very simple "why do bad things happen to good people"<br>  <br>  <br>  The answer for those questions and the answer to yours is there are certain principals to being sucessful, and weather a person is saved or not saved, good or bad,wicked or righteous; if the lesser or wicked person follows the principals and the better or righteous person doesnt, it's no suprise that the wicked person is blessed cuase he/she did what it takes to be blessed and the righteous person did not.<br>  <br>  Same in dating if the jerk does what it takes to get a mate of the oposite sex, then God bless him/her; if the nice,queit, whatever you wanna call it person doesnt do those things to get a mate of the oposite sex, then shame on him/her;especially if they knew and did not.

VLv3Vzjnaa	If we are Christians, like myself, we focus more on God as we are commanded to do.  The sad thing is that we are forced to endure so many brothers and sisters in Christ who have elevated their homophobia to the level of idolatry.  Nothing is more important to them than promoting homophobia.  Prop. 8 is a great example.  Taking away civil rights (and calling it love) was more important than Christ's commandment to treat others as we want to be treated.<br>  <br>  Look at the heterosexist churches that forbid gay people as members.  Rick Warren being one.  I have yet to hear of a pro-equality church that forbids heterosexuals from being members.  If I have to support homophobia in order to worship God, something is really wrong.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  I never said YOU were homophobic.  Sounds like the Holy Spirit may be trying to convict your heart of something.|`|SOlh57iKaa	"Homosexual Christians"<br>  That's a contradiction. Homosexuality is a condemned practice in the bible.

Do YOU not know that unrighteous persons will not inherit God’s kingdom? Do not be misled. Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men kept for unnatural purposes, nor men who lie with men, ?nor thieves, nor greedy persons, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners will inherit God’s kingdom.?.?.(1 Corinthians 6:9-10) <br>  <br>   "?and likewise even the males left the natural use of the female and became violently inflamed in their lust toward one another, males with males, working what is obscene and receiving in themselves the full recompense, which was due for their error." (Romans 1:27)<br>  <br>  <br>  The word "Christian" means to be like Christ, or to walk in his foot steps, surely a person who practice homosexuality cant hope to please Christ when Christ condemned this practice. <br>  <br>  I know such statement wont make a person popular but its the truth.|`|ef4edd8f1c0d16fab298d474bf08b339aa	I talk to them almost every day about one thing or another.

ImgouTRIaa	When I was just a kid, us boys were supposed to whiz with the lid up, so as not to insult the womenfolk with a dirty toilet seat, so we did. Doing that bit of graciousness for the fairer sex, one would THINK that a damsel could at least LOOK at where she's going to plunk her precious derriere down and avoid Titanic scale mishaps in the throne room , or is that asking too much of these intellectually superior creatures? We use it up, they use it down, it's like opening and closing a door, is it too much to do it yourself? If we go to the bathroom AFTER  the lady, do we whine because it is down? No , we just go in , do our thing , and move on, no need to hassle others.|`|boWDjT9Gaa	If women's brains were truly as superior in logic and reasoning as you put it, they would also know how to work the toilet seat, instead of blaming men all the time.

I was left to make decision and didn't want to... I went to the chapel and prayed so hard... the next day i arrived at the hospital and the doctor said that everything was great and that she would be fine... he couldn't explain how her kidneys started working and the toxins in her blood were no more... and on other occasions I had seen "visions" of the Blessed Mother once with my own Mom along with other heavenly beings , My Mom passed away last October... I feel like an epiphany or a a miracle is what I need now more than ever... I used to feel lost back then... but never like now... I don't know how to reconnect with my God and the Virgin Mary the way I used to... I should probably feel lucky that they touched my life many times before... but I wish I could see them again or that I could get more guidance... I think it's ok to want this though... I just want to feel less alone and more connected... so those are my instances of greatness... who knows maybe this sharing with you will be conveyed into prayer and I will receive what I have sought for so long now...

Pay particular attention to verse 11.<br>  <br>  1Corinthians 6:9 Don’t you know that evil people will not receive God’s kingdom? Don’t be fooled. Those who commit sexual sins will not receive the kingdom. Neither will those who worship statues of gods or commit adultery. Neither will men who are prostitutes or who commit homosexual acts. 10 Neither will thieves or those who always want more and more. Neither will those who are often drunk or tell lies or cheat. People who live like that will not receive God’s kingdom. 11 SOME OF YOU USED TO DO THOSE THINGS. BUT YOUR SINS WERE WASHED AWAY. YOU WERE MADE HOLY. YOU WERE MADE RIGHT WITH GOD.

rV1uAtt3aa	Matthew T, I knew someone would say that.  <br>  <br>  If only it were so!<br>  <br>  The truth is the Federal government is made up of the people it represents.  It is one of the most open, non-discriminating employers in the world.  When I worked there, for instance, I had openly gay co-workers, Muslim co-workers, Evangelistic co-workers, blacks, whites, Asians, old, young, and everything else you could think of.  While it is true that politicians steer the government in a certain direction, there's a lot of inertia, and things don't change over night.  Most of the bad things you hear about are rare, which is why they were news worthy.  If the US government has one, main fault, it's that its employees are indifferent to the people they serve (unless it's themselves; then they're just as up-in-arms as everyone else.)<br>  <br>  If you choose to trust a group (or not trust a group) in its entirety, you're making a big mistake.

Though I wouldn't call SM life changing for me.<br>  <br>  The fact is that films like SM aren't designed and targeted towards a younger audience, they are for people that genuinely enjoy quality movies. What you need to do is tell all your friends how good it is and urge them to go and see it!
3BHPJweWaa	Can't say that i have.<br>  <br>  i occasionally appreciate the totally "free-wheeling" atmosphere happening at least *some* places, on-line.<br>  <br>  Why do you view questions like "Will the World end on Dec. 21, 2012?" or "Obama is Muslim" claims as being "dead issue questions"?<br>  <br>  Are ignorance, prejudice, silliness, idiocy & propagation/ proliferation of false information *ever* (really) "dead issues"? <br>  <br>  (*sigh*)  <br>  <br>  As far as i can see, not in *this* world; & if ego-personalities continue into the *next*, how can there be no conflicts, even there -- *whatever* people's expectations?<br>  <br>  The kinds of Questions you mention are just of the nature that i wouldn't waste my time opening up to read the answers or waste the effort responding to them.  (Especially since i'm the sort who spends from an hour to 3 hours, each, writing most of my responses.)<br>  <br>  Being a relative "newbie" (i joined about 2 months & a week ago) i think i've basically learned *not* to waste my time (at least very often) answering silly Questions from non-serious individuals.  & i've learned (o still again!) that there is a certain kind of ignorance that wants to *stay* ignorant.  They're just wanting somebody to "yes yes" them.  The *last* thing they want is real information proving what they don't *want* to know!<br>  <br>  Personally, i find the endless atheist repeats & the (*yawn*y) fundamentalist Christian repeats (that i've already heard or read an equivalency at least a thousand times over the past 66 years) to be the *most* tedious.<br>  <br>  i regret that there is so very *little* that impacts upon me as being genuinely *spiritual* happening here.  (Obviously one has to go elsewhere for *real* spiritual input.  & it's not like the Holy Spirit's & Yeshua's Presences aren't ongoing *real* options -- at any time -- if one is sincere about seeking such.)  i also regret that genuinely insightful & meaningfully intelligent answers are so few & far between (at least to my perspective).  So many of the answers, here, are at the level of high school freshmen carrying-on in the locker room & in the halls between classes (& i suspect a *lot* of these "juveniles" are in their 20's to 40's).  As an indication of the overall spiritual development of humanity -- & depth of religious awareness, it's pretty scarey.  Not as bad as SouthEast Asia Talk with the Hindu & Muslim juveniles flaming & verbally bashing each other (a few years ago)... but... overall, generally disappointing, to say the least.<br>  <br>  There are instances where compassion & caring *does* get expressed here -- but there are times when the *opposite* happens, too.  i happened to tune-in, near Christmas, when a fellow was so depressed & hopeless that he said he was going to commit suicide after hoping for a few final, caring thoughts from some people at Y!A.  Most of the responses (about 6 of 'em, if i'm remembering right) were harsh & heartless -- enough to hasten him over the edge, if anything.  3 showed some compassion, trying to perk him up, asking him not to do it.  It was *difficult* for me to adequately answer that one... & by the time i'd gotten my response written, the Question had disappeared.  i really believe he went & killed himself after removing that Question with the maybe 11 Answers.  i noted that it was a new profile, his very *first* posting.  The *savageness* of some of those responses was very disturbing to me.  <br>  <br>  As to the 2012 stuff... just the next permutation of Y2K & the Jehovah's Witnesses' expectations in 1914... & all these people expecting to be raptured away!  There just seems to be this percentage of people who go from one illusion to the next.  Presumeably it gives meaning to their lives.<br>  <br>  As for Obama, MiLady noticed his "The Audacity of Hope" in our local library, a couple days ago, & checked it out -- thinking i'd be interested (she figured i'd be wiser to spend my time reading that one instead of probably being disturbed in reading this book on Arnold Schwartzenegger -- "Why Arnold Matters").  (It's "Secrets of Mary Magdalene" that i'm *most* hot to be reading, now; it arrived in the mail yesterday.)<br>  <br>  But i sure am *glad* we have an *intelligent* & compassionately-caring man (that i can really believe in) as our President, now.  He'll probably be one of the Great Ones, like Lincoln (if those filled with hate don't manage to assassinate him).<br>  <br>  If i wanted moderators On The Scene -- i'd simply start up my own Yahoo list, & *be* the moderator!  Or activate at those lists which have good moderators (like *Goddess Christians,* *Magdalene List* or *Divine Feminine Ideals*).  Certainly those lists have a considerably higher level of spiritual, religious, intellectual exchanges happening than is most prevalent at Yahoo! Answers.  Most of the responsiveness, here, is pretty lightweight.|`|AA10031161	This potential moderator would have a HUGE task to handle... to know enough about world religions and politics, etc... be able to read every single question and answer posted in R&S... and objective enough to know when someone's being a smart-ash.<br>  <br>  I think we need a moderator for Pets-> Dogs.. do you KNOW how many people just post a question about housebreaking or potty training their dog without doing a simple search to see what others have asked/learned?? One time, I actually did that very search, posted the link and told the asker to pick any answer that included crate training.|`|xHfl4yzSaa	While I understand your reasoning, I'd oppose empowering anyone with that responsibility.

Or imagine a Muslim, who gets crazy by the statement, that Jesus is the son of God!<br>  Normally you are right. But try to defend your belief in any Christian forum. Here we are allowed to answer. In almost every Christian Forum it is allowed, to say about Mormons bad whatever can be imagined. Try to defend your belief and they cast you out.

If a person is good on you probably She's your mother or father. If theirs a person who abused you probably it's your father's sister or aunts.       To give a person a benefit of doubt is a normal reaction.  To council ourselves at times of critical reunion, their so many things of doing it.  Try to be diplomatic and silently council such paranoia in front of people adding more shabby personality to your self.

It may be going an airy reunion.  But never let them read your mind.<br>  <br>  Well only wives can shout on you..."Darling you are hiding something in your mind...

joWIgxZpaa	It is possible. Quantum physics edges towards the spiritual aspects of physics and nature, even if quantum physicists like to distance themselves from this concept.

R8upjPu8aa	Dear one,<br>  <br>  <br>  When you know something, you don't need to take resort to the act of belief and believing. because you already know it.<br>  <br>  and similarly when you experience something, you don't even need to take resort of knowing and knowledge as you have already experienced it yourself.<br>  <br>  and when the experience becomes your own nature, you don't even need to rely on experience. as you ARE the experience YOURSELF!<br>  <br>  this is the state near to enlightenment !<br>  <br>  and now coming to your question, specifically and technically :<br>  <br>  when you are completely free from the influences of three modes of material nature { Tri-Guna-rahitha  Tri means three , guna means modes, Rahita means devoid } <br>  <br>  AND <br>  <br>  when you are beyond emotions ( Bhaava-Atheeta   Bhava means emotions and Ateetha means Beyond }, <br>  <br>  THAN, really "what you see is what you get".<br>  <br>  you should understand that, there are stages beyond this too, but this is surely a significant stage in ascension and ones spiritual journey.<br>  <br>  but when you are in this twilight stage, or to be more accurate, when you are entering this short twilight stage, you feel, what subtle belief you have , that is what, which is materializing , for you to see, so that you can grossly believe the same thing once again. <br>  <br>  this is what is happening to you and this is where you are now.<br>  <br>  the distance between the understanding of this subtle belief of "higher manifesting mind", and than what you see ( the process of seeing )  and than finally the gross belief that is imposed on your "manifested" minds as a result of this "process of seeing" , this distance is too complex to cover. So, I request you to skip this whole phase altogether.<br>  <br>  but there is one thing VERY IMPORTANT to be understood and to be observed, from this stage of yours,WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT. that is,  you see here, the previous subtle belief of higher mind that gets materialized just for the sole purpose of you to see, and the belief which results after seeing, which is more gross, and are imposed on the lower mind.<br>  <br>  so, in yoga, when you don't see, that means the "PROCESS OF SEEING" is gone, and you are just "BEING" instead of seeing, than your higher mind, containing your karmic footprint cannot influence your lower mind. See how the chain is broken. and moreover see the state of yours , it is free from both, the higher and lower minds. this is called as the state of LAYA. means state of absorption in the experience of BEING, not KNOWING, not SEEING, NOT DOING, NOTHING, Just BEING !<br>  <br>  Hence, LAYA is a very important Sanskrit word, and also a great state to achieve.<br>  <br>  This is excellent observation and distinguishment between the higher mind and the lower mind. see the power of higher mind to materialize what you subtly believe or what you should believe as per your karma, with latent impressions. and also, see the helpless nature of lower mind to grossly believe what you yourself show it.<br>  <br>  This observation is of HUGE spiritual importance. Observe it in detail, than you will be able to really see "Karma" and its working in action.<br>  <br>  Also this observation is of very huge importance, because it allows you to for the first time experience , that you are "BEYOND", both of them , the powerful subtle mind and the less powerful gross lower mind ( manifested )<br>    <br>  So, Let you ascend, This is my wish for you. lord bless. be in light, be in bliss and achieve freedom, than become the light itself and become that bliss itself. and please remember i have all love for you.<br>  <br>  let the bliss become your nature. I wish as many people as possible read and truly understand the deep intelligence and truth conveyed here in. because this sacred knowledge i have received from the lord, sometimes as Shiva, sometimes as Hari , sometimes as Narayana, sometimes as other forms, and sages and various deva's or some other form of the same glory.<br>  <br>  in Sanskrit they call this knowledge as Durlabha which means " Very difficult to find and even more difficult to understand and still more difficult to digest/assimilate it in your intellectual layer" <br>  <br>  This knowledge is not available in greatest of books of this earth, and are true experiences and resulting understanding of my meditation on the divine.<br>  <br>  I wish many mind can understand all this and resolve themselves and make themselves free and make there stay in this Maya more comfortable.<br>  <br>  this is what exactly the great ancient civilization of Mayans did, they mastered the art and working of "Maya" and hence they call themselves Mayan. The Ancient Mayans were true masters of operations and architectures of this Material World, of this MAYA ! I remember and show my respect to this great civilization at this point of time. They were masters of the architecture of this universe and more.<br>  <br>  I invite the great change, in there name with all my respect and gratitude. The great change energized by Shiva, will start its activity in 2013, of Gregorian calender.<br>   <br>  I wish and pray so that all my fellow souls become free and see there glorious nature.<br>  <br>  Lord bless you all.<br>  <br>  -- Yours, one with you All, I am your own projection fo your own self, I am your mirror, Deito.<br>  <br>  Harirnama Harirnama Harirnama Kevalam.|`|6dL7UGvfaa	Believing ,making us see only what we believe and seeing with the mind(senses) and believing what we see both operated in my case. The spiritual dimension to it came when I became aware of how I am getting determined by 'believing' and/or 'seeing' that put me in uneasy unsureness because I began to feel that I am pushing myself into a make believe world often causing misery!<br>  Yes, both - 'believing'> and 'seeing'> - can be spiritual stepping stones but a very slippery/risky ones. Either we may slip and fall down or get an illusion of they being lifts and start moving in the fantasy clouds.Both divides/separates us from the source that sustains and  lifts us.It is then that I started being in the 'world'. that is beyond believing/seeing made ones but just be, be in the flow that already/eternally exist that does not call for any making from me(by believing and seeing). I also become aware that, that being ( just be with all that already exist and flowing ) is just giving, giving. Hence, I would phrase it this way:<br>  <br>  What we give is what we get.|`|A01w1dHqaa	Only seeing in the present is clear.<br>  <br>  When looking through the past and future we are never in the present.<br>  <br>  EDIT after a hot, soaking bath...<br>  <br>  We see in the Crucifixion and Resurrection what we want to see. Joy or sacrifice...Life  or death.<br>  <br>  God sees only One and in the present so do we.|`|1cwgJ6dIaa	As far as seeing and believing or believing and then seeing go they are the same in the judgmental ego-mind.  When one is able to bypass conceptualization a new kind of vision appears from within using the same energy in a higher dimension.  Fear perception is a combination of believing and seeing like when a rope lying on the path through the woods appears to be a snake.  Seeing without thought concepts and seeing from a stilled mind reveals what is. Being and seeing are one and the same phenomenon. also, they are codependent.|`|OUbNSXjJaa	I have also heard of such a theory. First believing, then seeing, then getting closer and closer. Then merging or uniting. This is from the angle of deep devotion to God. In Sanskrit, it is called 'saalokya', 'saameepya' and 'saayujya'. Every stage is considered a status towards the progress in devotional path.|`|09ef400ecd1475bf913602053ad3f68aaa	True vision is not with the eyes, it is with the heart. Many see but are deceived because they believe the lie is real. The lie is mans values and not gods.|`|fmHyfVmVaa	We make pictures here. We are the projectors of all we see. What we see is a testimony to what we believe, there is no separation. This seeing or making pictures is an analogy of what we really do since projection is only here. We see this because we believe it & we believe it because we see it. (I have got to stop seeing this, LOL!) The two act as one. This is why it is said "Change your mind & you change your world".<br>  In the Christian Bible if you take the word repent back to it's original language it does not have the same meaning that we give the word today. Repent means to change your mind! In Truth we are seeking to remember that which has always been & will always be. But here the process is perceived by us a seeking. Just as we perceive we are learning & growing when in Truth all we do is unlearn the illusion, unlearn the lies. Once done what is left is us.<br>  We were created perfect in the image of our Source. We err in thinking that that which is created perfect could ever be damaged, altered, made sinful, etc. But we can cover it up with lies & half Truths & believe that we have. So we come full circle, we believe what we see & see what we believe.<br>  Blessings!|`|mg6gAfwYaa	More than seeing or believing, it is 'experiencing', what you see may be an illusion, what you believe may be false, but what you experience is the 'Reality'. Like some one so rightly said, I have forgotten what I was taught I only remember what I have learnt. And one truly learns from experience. God can very cleverly manipulate your experiences in sync with your beliefs, if they are true and make you see what you believe. But in the final analysis, we are at the mercy of God for whatever we see, believe or experience.|`|OqveEUqkaa	It should be: what you do is what you get. As far as believing; I do not see air and I believe it is present, otherwise, we would die. I do not believe in a god, not because I can not see it, not because there books or people say there will be consequences; it is because there is no logical or scientific method to prove  or disprove its existence. It is the same as believing in Santa Clause or any kind of idol believers. "To thy own self be true...."|`|JjU6IdnDaa	This is true with technology.  <br>  <br>  The human condition must allow for illusion.  "Perception is reality". This may vary from the true product.  Faith is another realm altogether.<br>  <br>  Believing is a choice.|`|a9r82MRIaa	You can't see air, but you know it's there. (I know it ryhmes).

There are thousands of realities for every situation, so I can choose what reality I want it to be.<br>  <br>  Nothing is what it is, until we choose to make it something, by our belief of what it is.<br>  <br>  Just explaining it further - <br>  - If someone lost their job, they may see it as a disaster, whereas someone else may be able to see it as a an opportunity to get a better one, with more money.<br>  <br>  - If someone was cut off in traffic, they may see it as something to be angry about, whereas someone else may see it as an opportunity to forgive the other person.<br>  <br>  - If someone was broke, they may feel very down on their luck, whereas someone else might realise they had attracted that to them by their belief about it and therefore then use the opportunity to change how they think,  and end up wealthy.<br>  <br>  WE HAVE A CHOICE – we can choose anything we want, there are thousands of reactions we can have to change that reality (situation).<br>  <br>  So it has nothing to do with what the situation "is" as it isn't anything, until we make it something.<br>  <br>  LOVE, Peace and Light to all.<br>  peacefromken.|`|ghMJyzsOaa	Whatever belief we choose to embrace will have the potential to produce a gravitational force of feelings and desires, which seeks to corroborate the already existing knowledge, and will so naturally attract the elements needed from any correlating reality. This Knowledge is pertinent to constructing the appropriate conceptual formula, expedient to projecting a physical extension of the belief, which then becomes our experience.<br>  <br>  A belief that is nurtured and fuelled by determined desire, will always attract that, what you need to see, in order for you to progress to the next phase in your evolutionary higher self-developement. Our belief does influence the way we perceive, it can further expand our thinking universe, or restrict our capacity to fully walk with imbibing open eyes.<br>  <br>  I think everything that we encounter in life is a spiritual stepping stone, that can help to further enhance our experience, so that we gradually grow to know the fullness of our design in whatsoever we choose. A belief in this will navigate a seeking mind to TRUTH. It is this same belief that brings me here to read this question, that you have elequently presented.  <br>  <br>  Bless you! Good question!<br>  <br>  This is just my view on your theme!|`|9d87f8ac5ae928484a7411f0edfcc1e9aa	Greetings Friend,<br>  <br>  I like what you wrote.  Here's a quote from ACIM: "I am upset because I see what is not there.  Reality is never frightening.  It is impossible that it could upset me.  Reality brings only perfect peace.  When I am upset, it is always because I have replaced reality with illusions which I made up.  The illusions are upsetting because I have given them reality and thus regard reality as an illusion.  Nothing in God's creation is affected in any way by this confusion of mine.  I am always upset by nothing."<br>  <br>  We give everything we see all the meaning it has.<br>  <br>  <br>  Love,<br>  <br>  James|`|AA10745410	Belief gives us distorted/partial picture, whereas "seeing" gives us right understanding of "what is". For a beginner, crutches of belief can be helpful to some extent, after that it becomes a major obstacle.

hdFn4Dobaa	Revelation 14 is a prophecy written to humanity telling that communication with God is key. That's the cup that Jesus wanted to be spared, for He didn't want wrath to be poured out on His people. The Father must correct. Repentance is required. <br>   Our names and sins are written in the Book of Life. Everytime we sin, it is written in the Book of Life. Everytime we do good, it is written in the Book of Life. Everytime that we repent, a sin is erased in the Book of Life, and nothing but our good will be left in it beside our name. ( Philippians 4;3, Revelation 3;5; 13:8; 20:12; 21:27. ).<br>  <br>  Satan's biggest weapon is deception. False teachings is one of the things that fall under deceptions of Satan. <br>  Receiving Satan's / the Antichrist mark means to be fooled by him. God is going to give free reign to those ignorant in His Word. It will be allowed as a test, to see if His people will fall for it ( Ezekiel 14:4 and Isaiah 14: 5-15 ), the proverb against the king of Babylon ( Satan ).<br>   <br>  Stick to God's Word and have the Seal of Christ, or you will be fooled ( Revelation 9:4 ). The Mark of the Beast is not on your forehead----it shall be in your head / brain. Only the people who do not have the sign of God in their brains and memory will be tormented 5-months with pain like from a scorpion sting. During these days, people will want to die, but death will run away from them ( Revelation 9:4-6 ).<br>  <br>  You will be educated enough if you understand before this comes about and remember God's promises, and you will do just fine.<br>  <br>  Many will come in the Christ's name but God said that He didn't send them. Satan has appeared on Earth and he is having church everywhere ( Luke 21: 8 ). <br>  There will be 2-witnesses who will come 260-days before the Antichrist, and they shall have supernatural powers. Higher Critics or people going around claiming to be God ( scripture lawyers ) instead of following the Scriptures, they try to disclaim God, and have an agenda not favorable to God.<br>  Colossians 2: 1-9 teaches that the Antichrist come 1st ( Mark 13 ) before Jesus returns, and the Antichrist will take control for 5-months. He will be handsome, and come in prosperously and peacefully, according to the Book of Daniel. Keep roots in Jesus. There is a simple pattern through the Scriptures to bring us back to God. Be sure that no one leads you away with false and empty teachings including the Rapture Doctrine ( heaven shall be established right here on Earth ) , that comes from the ruling spirits of this world, not Christ. Most of the world will be deceived. <br>  Many of the churchgoers shall be deceived also, for they do not recieve the true words of God in their hearts chapter by chapter, verse by verse. There will be scatterers who claim knowledge of God, but just give you gravy instead of meat like 1 or 2 verses of the Bible; nothing to sustain you.<br>  <br>  This man ( the Antichrist ) shall claim to be Jesus, but he isn't. When he establishes himself, he will have the whole world wondering after him, and he will be accepted as Christ.<br>  There are 2-Beast:<br>   The 1st beast,  is a political system which affects politics which will cause governments to be jockeying, religion, education, and finances will be  up and operating, Christ will return in 5- months. <br>  The 2nd beast, is a religious man who will speak against Christ, and he will prosper through 1-world control.<br>  God's Elect shall make a stand against him. Read about God's Elect ( Romans 11, 8:1-26, Ephesians 1:4 ).<br>  <br>  People may try to tell you, or show you different, but know this:<br>  Unlike other creatures who operate their lives out of instinct, we ( humanity )  are equipped with sufficient " internal machinery " to connect to the Living God. In fact, when we become children of God through faith in His Son, that connection with Him takes on a whole new dimension. The Lord's Spirit literally communicates with our inner beings, called our spirit. In other words, an entire system of inner communication is established at the time of Salvation, making it possible for us to receive whatever it is that the Spirit of God wishes to communicate ! ( Romans 8:P14-16 ).<br>  Blessings and I hope that this not only bless you like it has blessed me, but I hope that it fall on fertile ground for all to receive it dear.<br>  Praise the Lord !.|`|W7l1awFPaa	The mark is something that you receive in your hand or in your forehead and is therefore probably something that has to be done surgically.

At present it is being told it is for good because that is how Satan works is by deceiving people.<br>  It will be a chip, like they are now putting in animals to identify them.<br>  They are saying now it will be good to put into older people that have memory problems and would get lost and for children that get lost.<br>  There are some places that are trying to get their employees to have it implanted as a type of  security (Missouri has banned it as of now)<br>  Look at all the kids that are going missing, they will say<br>  (mark my words) it will be good to implant them with a chip to locate them. Which will be ok for now, but when the Antichrist comes he will use it against people where they can't buy, sell or move about without him knowing where they are. The people that have come up with this idea has no idea at all where this is heading.<br>  The news said this chip, that looks like a tiny capsule will be implanted under the skin and will be scanned. This chip will have markings like they have on everything now with all those lines, each line will give all your information and will have a line that is marked "666"<br>  Guess where they said the best place to insert it under the skin?<br>  Your forehead or under the top of your hand because the skin is thinner there and can be scanned better.<br>  What does the Bible say about where he will make them take the mark?<br>  In the forehead or in the right hand! The Bible sure knows what it is talking about.<br>  With all these kids and even adults missing is another evil of Satans to get his plans set in place.<br>  So, in answer again to your question there will be no innocent Christians here when taking the mark God will take His people out first it will be forced upon people and it will be forced, the Antichrist will torture people to try to force them and then kill them if they don't and most likely by beheading them, because he will come from the Muslim nation according to the Bible and they do believe in beheading people.<br>  You can also google "Youtube about the chip implant" there are places on there even talking about this chip.|`|qcEzJDY6aa	All will have it, be poor or rich, anyone read:Revelation 13:16 And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads: It's MONEY and they IDOLIZE it.<br>  The ROOT of all EVIL.

So I suppose if you heed His words then you will have been warned and will not take the mark of the beast, but if you are lazy and do not take serious Jesus' words then maybe you will be lead astray.|`|VLv3Vzjnaa	I think we will all know when it happens.  It's a  mark that will be required to buy and sell anything.  So, it's not likely anyone will get something like that accidentally.|`|jTEB2cgsaa	I thought that being baptised wasshed out the sign of the beast.|`|yB0nVXfWaa	Dear Lisa<br>  You know the answer to the first part, for the Bible says that anyone who takes the mark on his forehead or forearm will be damned.  So, it must be a choice - there must be a choice involved as to whether to take the mark, otherwise God would be unrighteous in condemning folk, wouldn't he?<br>  <br>  As regards children, they clearly will not receive the mark until they are at an age to 'buy and sell' on a serious level - ie. adults.  I would think this would be after school, say around 16-18.  Anyways, the authorities would have enough to do to deal with us adults first!<br>  <br>  <br>  Well, no-one can see into all the finer details of the system which will be in the future, as regards the totally innocent and unknowing (eg. mental patients and those with emotional problems, etc.) but we are talking about the great mass of society who can think and use their rational choice.  If they have made the decision to get the mark out of their rational choice, then that is where the condemnation comes in.<br>  <br>  Do you not know that, in the Olivet Discourse, the Lord is at pains to underline how, in the time just before the end of the age, there will be great deception about, such as, if it were possible, they should deceive even the elect.  Even St. Paul says 'the righteous shall scarcely be saved' too.  Also see Matthew 7:21-23.  Do you realise what that means? - it means that the deceived will be many, multitudes in fact of so called 'Christians'.<br>  <br>  Why do you think the Lord was at pains (along with the rest of the NT) to warn us of these things, particularly about the danger of being deceived?  Because these things are very real dangers and, in fact, there will be many who think they are going the right way and in fact are not.  In other words, a great apostasy.  Not very acceptable in Christian circles nowadays, is it?  But, read the scriptures, and be warned.<br>  <br>  So, my answer is that all Christians will know what the Gospel is, even though it is currently being stifled in many a 'Christian' church, because the Bible, and biblical testimony, is nevertheless available to all who care to follow them.  The education is there, but many will, by that time, be 'fast asleep' like the proverbial 'foolish virgins' and many will be deceived, because they did not espouse the 'love of the truth' from the beginning, but preferred to receive 'another spirit', believe 'another gospel' and proclaim 'another Jesus' (II Cor.11:4).<br>  <br>  See, it is foretold! The scripture does not talk in vain about these things.

Jewish people throughout history have generally been a very close, tight knit family and later ethnicity and religion. They are, in a word, inclusive. Such self-imposed ostracism has often made them very suspicious to people outside the group. Furthermore, they've had a history of being defiant (see when the assyrians razed their city and then the Romans turned around and did it again). Lastly, their religion, historically at least, before the advent of Christianity (which is an offshoot of Judaism) has always been more than a little odd to people outside. All three cultural identities don't make for good relations with neighboring cultures. When kingdoms and empires looked for scapegoats, their societal eyes always seemed to fall on the little group of people that are always "different." This tendency has perpetuated itself to the point where it seems ingrained in the global mindset that Jews are "different" and "set-apart". When Jews were persecuted (not talking about Hitler) and ostracized throughout europe in the centuries leading to the modern age, they were often barred from normal jobs, forced to find a way to survive. Eventually they mastered the art of money-lending, among other things, which allowed them to make money but they weren't 'barred' from. Of course as Jews became good at this (why not?), they were again, looked on with suspicion now that they were making money.|`|f522078ffdf8786fcab6f8023c6befbdaa	How better to strengthen a people's will than by giving them struggles through which to strengthen themselves?<br>  <br>  If you want to become a weight lifter, you have to start with small weights and work your way up.

It's okay to like him but you will need the power of God to get through the problems that would come to you because of the Muslims that would cause trouble.  Jesus is the Way, the Truth and the Life.  No man comes to the Father but through Him.  John 14:6<br>  <br>  As it is written, there is none righteous, not even one….  Romans 3:10<br>  <br>  For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.  Romans 6:23<br>  <br>  For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believes in him will not perish but have eternal life. John 3:16.<br>  <br>  Behold, I stand at the door and knock, if any one hear my voice and open the door, I will come in to him and sup with him and he with me. Revelation 3:20<br>  <br>  As many as received him, to them he gave the power to become children of God, even to them that believe on his name. John 1:12<br>  <br>  Repent therefore, and be converted that your sins may be blotted out and that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord. Acts 3:19<br>  <br>  …that if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and believe in your heart that <br>  God raised him from the dead, you shall be saved.  Rom. 10:9<br>  <br>  If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature. Old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new. II Corinthians 5:17|`|UutLVO2Laa	Go for it.|`|vnEdfxeVaa	I wouldn't advise you to keep your love to him , some scholars say it is allowed for a Muslimah to marry a non Muslim but it's only few who are saying so , so I wouldn't advise you to risk it . <br>  <br>  You can forget him if you stayed away from him , this is the only way you can get over him .|`|2sgyGVkeaa	It is not wrong to like him.. if your intention is marriage. I would suggest talking to your parents about the situation first. In Islam, Allah gives women the right to propose to a man. <br>  <br>  Ultimately the issue comes up about religion. If he is willing to explore Islam and learn about it and maybe convert in the future. You would have to be sure that he is converting for Allah and not you.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck and may Allah be with you :)|`|7sqpiGgoaa	how religion wrecks this planet.... take a comprehensive look at how huge the universe is, google some things, do some research on the actually insignificance of our existance and the enormous size of of it all... come back and ask yourself 'does religion matter?' is it worth destroying your life for? <br>  <br>  think outside of your upbringing, it doesn't mean you don't love your parents, but you have a brain and a heart... they should be used, not some robotic form of existence in the name of religion|`|XxWovDNCaa	Everything is wrong in islam.<br>  Except bomb making of course, that get's you a gold star.|`|ow2gVYeqaa	I'm Christian and the Bible teaches that we ought not be un equally yoked with unbelievers.<br>  <br>  Obviously becuase sooner or later the oposing beliefs will clash and cause discord in the home/relationship.<br>  <br>  <br>  But I have a friend, a female friend who is Muslim and she has a boyfriend is not Muslim (Dont know what faith he professes) and from what she tells me she gets along fine with him and one statment I remember her saying was "He knew what he was getting into"|`|l2QUgSwzaa	Well you should know his feeling first then think about the religion bcoz if you both feel to each other i dont think the religion will stop both of you, look my sister is muslim and she married to not only  christian but american too and yes he convert to Islam, maybe you think its diffecult but once he read our religion and underdstand it he might convert too, our religion is good and not that hard but people doesn't know, anyway wish you a good luck|`|DYPeJsLmaa	I am a muslim as well and my family is very religious.

IUXgt7Llaa	garden of eden...(not in Mizzou but) in the Middle East <br>  <br>  silly mormons, tricks are for kids|`|uLgQ5lVQaa	Mormons believe Adam and Eve were living in Missouri? What happened to the Garden of  Eden?|`|5MVQrmMfaa	Not a big fan of that assertion.|`|JTu1cLkYaa	It is true, Mormons believe that the Garden of Eden was located in what is now known as Jackson County, Missouri. And, there are some who can even point to sites in that area of Missouri which correspond to the descriptions in Genesis of the land surrounding the Garden. There is also a very beautiful valley in that area that is believed to have been the place that Adam and Eve lived after expulsion from the Garden. <br>  <br>  This view is minor and has little, if any, impact on LDS teachings.|`|FyLfEPv0aa	I was often asked this on my mission by JWs as they had it listed as point #1 of 14 points to disprove Mormonism, it would go like this:<br>  <br>  them: do you really believe that the Garden of Eden was in Missouri?<br>  <br>  me:  yes I do<br>  <br>  them: that's ridiculous<br>  <br>  me:  where do you think it was<br>  <br>  them:  um, well perhaps it might have been, um, maybe close to, but the ark, um, we don't really know where it was.<br>  <br>  me:  we do, it was Missouri, next question please.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  So if you believe in the bible, that there was a massive flood in which land masses moved as well, and you think that a boat without an anchor can't float away?<br>  <br>  I only sound silly before you realize that you are mocking an assertion of knowledge from an ignorant viewpoint.|`|7d16b3b33c15681f9d53425cac12ac67aa	Yes. I know some may find this absurd.... but people seem to forget that the land masses of the world were constantly changing and geographic features of land are the first thing that change. The Earth is not a stable land mass and to assume that the Earth has been the same since the time of Adam and Eve is absurd.  They seem to throw out the fact that Noah's flood occured which also created geographic instablity.<br>  <br>  <br>  On a side note, I've also heard that the garden of Eden was under the Persian gulf in one of my Mythology classes at my university. So this is proof enough that people believe that the Earth has not been a stable land mass.|`|MJMsOFpiaa	I am a Mormon, and really when I saw your question I thought I wasn't really sure. I'm not an adult and in our sunday school it's not like they teach that everyday. But I do remember Jacksonville, Missouri being mentioned alot. Like someone else said, it doesn't really affect our main teachings. It only makes sense that after Noah and the flood that the people would live somewhere else rather than Eden.|`|AA11809403	i am sure there has been at least one family in Missouri where the adults were named Adam and Eve.<br>  <br>  but the ones from the Old Testament? no, not at all.|`|YHmr7nvsaa	Adam and Eve never existed.

Why does it matter if the murders committed by the Yorkshire Ripper were brutal or not?<br>  You are suggesting that Britain unravel 50 years of development to solve the issue of violence. This is a ridiculous show of double-standards.

Tougher sentencing and I think we need the 3-strikes rule here.

Bring back the death penalty, make punishments harsher and make prison hell, not comfortable living with good food and tv.

I suggest you wear the stuff occasionally and don't be so afraid to be a "poser".  Wear it occasionally, not when your going out, but when your round at their place or something.

Turn your desk into an altar to knowledge and memory, and victory in education; decorate the desk with empowering words and symbols.  <br>  <br>  Banish everything that gets in your way.

He is our most senior teacher, shepherd, and pastor.<br>  <br>  John 21:15-17 states: <br>  <br>  When they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, "Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these?" He said to him, "Yes, Lord, you know that I love you." He said to him, "Feed my lambs." <br>  <br>  He then said to him a second time, "Simon, son of John, do you love me?" He said to him, "Yes, Lord, you know that I love you." He said to him, "Tend my sheep." <br>  <br>  He said to him the third time, "Simon, son of John, do you love me?" Peter was distressed that he had said to him a third time, "Do you love me?" and he said to him, "Lord, you know everything; you know that I love you." (Jesus) said to him, "Feed my sheep. <br>  <br>  Matthew 16:17-19 states:<br>  <br>  Jesus said to him in reply, "Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah. For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my heavenly Father.

Whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven." <br>  <br>  The Catholic Church believes the Lord made Simon alone, whom he named Peter, the "rock" of his Church. He gave him the keys of his Church and instituted him shepherd of the whole flock.<br>  <br>  The Pope is the senior pastor of 1.1 billion Catholic Christians, the direct successor of Simon Peter.<br>  <br>  The Pope’s main roles include teaching, sanctifying, and governing.<br>  <br>  For more information, see the Catechism of the Catholic Church, section 880-882: <a href="http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt1sect2chpt3art9p4.shtml#880" rel="nofollow">http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt1s...</a><br>  <br>  With love in Christ.|`|X8LNbaKQaa	By whom?<br>  <br>  -- <br>  Regards,<br>  <br>  John Popelish|`|lDEGaK7Laa	He's supposedly the representative of god on earth.|`|7422ddf097669bd7b6e3d48e56258b87aa	The Pope is the Pope.<br>  <br>  He holds a unique, holy office that was personally established by Jesus Christ, while he still walked the earth.<br>  <br>  One the last absolute rulers on the planet, answerable to God alone, the Pope holds the keys to the kingdom of heaven, and he has the awesome power to bind and loose, on earth and in heaven, with virtually no limitations or reservations.<br>  <br>  That doesn't make him better than anybody else, but it sure does give him a lot more power and authority than the average guy.|`|XsTJPMHqaa	Catholics consider the Pope a man.<br>  <br>  He is an important man to us, because he is the one chosen by the Holy Spirit to guide the Church. When speaking to the entire Christian World, on a matter concerning only Faith and Morals, from his position as the sucsessor of St. Peter, he cannot teach us something that is false. That is what infallible means. <br>  <br>  So that's who the Pope is. Catholics view him as sort of a grandfather, so we care for him very much too.|`|LQQAQDkIaa	That would depend on your mindset. We Catholics believe he was chosen by the Holy Spirit to lead the Eternal Church. That is all 1.3 Billion of us. As a leader, that is pretty impressive. How many does Obama lead? Or Elizabeth II? Or any other world leader that people think are so high and mighty. I think he is above most other men. Pax Christi|`|8P64hgL3aa	No one is above anybody else no matter what title they have not even God's messengers because they are also humans.

We consider him blessed being part of the succession of popes from Peter. Are his blessing "extra powerful"? Yeah, that is the belief. He's wearing the world's oldest ring on his hand. There is so much mystery and tradition he knows that we have no idea about. . .<br>  <br>  We also respect his infallibilty in matters of faith.<br>  <br>  But as simply a man, no -- he is just a sinner like the rest of us. He goes to confession daily. He has a pretty big burden, with being the head of the Roman Catholic Church and all. Can you imagine? <br>  <br>  Above other men as a man? No. Spiritually speaking and in his position? Yes.|`|LYnuEdKUaa	No.  He is not considered above other men.  He simply guides us as Catholics.  He's like your boss at work - equal as fellow man (or woman), but above us in leadership and knowledge of the "workplace".|`|bSsb5Yavaa	If you consider someone who was once a part of the brown army, AKA nazi germany, who wears 5000 dollar prada shoes while trying to preach humility actually ABOVE other men... there's something wrong with you.|`|AA11173241	NO.

We must all try to bear our sufferings with joy, some people become bitter when things happen to them and some are more optimistic that things will turn out OK in the end. Life is funny isn't it. I find people with faith can handle things more easily than those who don't have faith.

Friends, guided by God, saved him from their evil clutches.<br>  <br>  The impact on the society of the day was amazing - thousands upon thousand left the Catholic Church in protest of its false doctrines, hence the birth of the title "Protestant". <br>  <br>  The impact of Luther's ideas resulted in the destruction of Germany during two World Wars - revenge on the stamping ground of the Vatican's arch heretic.|`|pTkjGfBRaa	The main thrust of Martin Luther's concern was that the church through corruption was placing itself between parishioners and God.  He thought that the church was actually getting in the way of people's relationship with God rather than helping them.  <br>  <br>  Because of this, the 95 thesis focus mainly on a system of indulgences that were presented as control that the church had over people's afterlives.  Luther was concerned that the practice of indulgences, and corruption in the Church interfered with people's assurance of salvation and assurance of God's grace and love.  <br>  <br>  This was a time when masses were considered to be sacrificial, that the performance of mass was not to celebrate and worship God but rather to minimize time in purgatory.  "Private" masses were performed in empty chapels only for sacrifice to reduce purgatory punishment.  It was a time when masses were presented in Latin, in a language that common people could not understand.  It was a time when the Bible was not translated into local languages because it was feared that they would not understand.  It was a time when tradition was placed in higher importance than scripture.  Luther worked to reform these things.<br>  <br>  In response, the Catholic Church responded with the Council of Trent in the sixteenth century.  Though indulgences remained in the Catholic Church, abuses were corrected.  The Bible eventually was translated into local languages.  In the latter 20th century following Vatican II, masses were celebrated in local languages rather than in Latin.  Many of the problems that Luther saw have now been corrected and the modern day Catholic church looks much like the Catholic Church that Luther longed for in his day when the reformation was first beginning.  That said, important differences still do remain -- ordination of women, papal authority, indulgences, the number of sacraments and how we think of them, the importance of tradition and church canon, allowance for the variance of local pieties, and the role of the laity.

Couldn't he have just thought of a more logical way to approach this? He's God, after all. It's like he made a game out of doing things in the most flamboyantly outlandish and unnecessary ways possible.|`|aac509d23ce8da767d68e4f377f3f4c7aa	Jesus had the promise, the mental assurance, that he would be resurrected, but from Gethsemane onwards, his faith in God's word was tested to breaking point. Even with an angel coming to minister to him, he still was assailed with dread. Don't forget that he had voluntarily restricted himself to the bodily condition of being human, which included the thought processes. He couldn't flick a switch and go into solitary deity mode for the crucifixion. With all the human emotions we have, he faced not only degredation and torture, but what is unimaginable for us - his beloved Father rejecting him (when he baceme sin on the cross.) His knowledge of the scriptures forewarned him that he would become an accursed thing, even though he had done no sin. Given his eternal existence with God and the Holy Spirit prior to his incarnation, none of us can begin to comprehend what that momentary break in their triune fellowship did to his mind and heart.<br>  <br>  Jesus had to go to the cross in faith; we have to fall at the foot of the cross in faith. Jesus' faith was immensely more tested than ours will ever be. What if Satan's taunts (questioning whether God really meant it when he declared Jesus to be his beloved Son) turned out to be true and that God would reject him eternally? Unthinkable? Well, Jesus could not know the reality of the promise of the resurrection until he had sacrificed his all. What if - as a man - he had misunderstood? Jesus had to cast himself utterly on the Father and the Holy Spirit. He showed supreme faith in sacrificing his life.|`|u2BVwAKNaa	Once again Jesus was found guilty of crimes and sentenced to death he was not sacrificed|`|yie2UE0naa	Jesus died, He was dead  -  only after 3 days was He resurrected, and He sacrificed His life for us so we can live|`|qY9svA3taa	Great point!

As a human, Jesus dealt with many things, as the scriptures says that he "learned discipline". He suffered death as any of us would. He was resurrected as we who have the assurance of everlasting life can be confident that we will sacrifice our life in doing God's will.|`|RDxbbCHwaa	Crucifixion is horrible way to die including the flogging that came before it. I wouldn't want to do it even if I knew I was going to be revived.<br>  <br>  The point of His sacrifice was that all people sin and sin must be payed for. Like if someone conducts a crime nowadays our courts convict the criminal and determine what the appropriate punishment will be. Jesus paid for all our sins because he was without sin, and by letting himself be killed his sacrifice was payment for all the sins ever done after provided you come to Him.<br>  <br>  I don't believe this gives an automatic out to murderers and other such people, however. I don't think they're capable of pulling a fast one on God.|`|QluBTwCvaa	Jesus Christ gave his life for three years in ministry, always focusing on doing the will of the Father, teaching His disciples, displaying the will and the heart of the Father, never rebelling once.  He knew of His horrible death to come because He had to fulfill every scripture. He knew of the death described in Psalm 22 and quoted its first line while on the cross.  While in agonizing pain of crucifixion He prayed for the forgiveness of His torturers, He called for the care of his mother, He forgave a criminal of his sins while he was crucified next to him, He said every word specifically according to the will of the Father, all the time knowing if he failed you would go to hell.    <br>  <br>  The sacrifice is just that. He died so you would not have to pay for your sins. He became sin for you so that you might become the righteousness of God in him and therefore eligible for eternal life, avoiding eternal separation from God.  <br>  <br>  Look around and see whose punishment that you would take for them. Scarcely for a good man would one die, but Christ commended His love toward us in that while we were yet sinners, Christ Jesus died for us.  Without this act of sacrifice on your behalf, you have no hope.  The Father's just nature demands punishment for sin.  Jesus Christ / Yashua Ha Meshyiach took that punishment, not for his own sin, but for yours, and for all who will believe.  How will you have hope if you neglect so great a sacrifice.There remains no more sacrifice sufficient to rescue you. He says He will give you abundant life.  Resurrect is what Christians will also do who loved His appearing. Some of us will remain alive though and be changed to meet Him.|`|uXsiHJtnaa	Why must Jesus easily surrender himself on the cross?  It makes no difference between a man committing suicide or lacking of hope.  <br>  <br>  Moreover he was God's son, and not an ordinary person.  Why he had  no power to save himself.  He went to heaven but left us to suffer on earth.  He said he is coming anytime, so you wait........wait.......when?<br>  <br>  I have no intention to hurt this humble and compassionate son, but the whole incidence was a pity, which is still a question mark which last till today.

To keep us from destroying our selves, trying to create life  other than our own (not in child birth in cloning-- ), and to keep us from committing sins against him. It certainly wasn't from seeing him as he truly is.... I can tell you that. GOD was trying to keep people pure and with a pure heart.

And the punishment that was then handed down, the woman gets to bleed and the guy's got to go to work, is the result of a man desiring, because his woman suggested that it would be a good idea, that he get all the knowledge that was supposedly the property and domain of God. So, that right away sets up Christianity as an anti-intellectual religion. You never want to be that smart. If you're a woman, it's going to be running down your leg, and if you're a guy, you're going to be in the salt mines for the rest of your life. So, just be a dumb **** and you'll all go to heaven.

Like sex, but better. And also, if this was targeting murder as a crime and the response of law makers to make this crime unfavorable to act out, than I need only combat your ideal by further explaining this particular type of crime with a similar comparison based on how you explained the punishment: a finite moment of weakness, or hatred, or passion resulted in the infinite unwilling rest (if you can call non-existence rest as I do not believe in an after-life) of the victim.<br>  <br>   I am a firm, FIRM, believer in the "An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth" justice system, that is no longer used in today's courts in most of the modern world.<br>  <br>   A maximum-security prison actually isn't that bad if you have your act together (I knew a guy who was in prison for 13 years on some bogus legislature) and while being free is much better, I believe death is much worse. <br>  <br>   So no, to answer your question, an infinite punishment is not too much for finite crimes.<br>  <br>   However if you are asking about morality from a Christian perspective, then <br>  <br>  1: If you are a Christian and repent your sins than are forgiven in the eyes of god and in the afterlife will go to heaven, making this not infinite.<br>  And,<br>  2: Christianity has always threatened non-believers that they will go to hell if they do not submit to the Christian faith and suffer ETERNAL damnation, so you have no right to judge the morals of modern lawmakers. <br>  <br>  And also if you view this from a polytheist perspective and believe in the mother earth "everyone has a right to live in freedom and peace" belief, then you should consider that the only way for everyone to do that is to do what they want, and for them to do what they want, the minority of the thinkers (those of use who are used of singular thinking-only thinking of themselves and their own wants) will harm others, and if that happens, than everyone isn't happy and having peace and complete freedoms now are they? Remember that people will not have the same cognitive reactions as you do you situations. Which makes thinking on a mass scale, (As a collective of people and not as an individual) require punishing the minority of thinkers.<br>   So support the majority of mutually respective citizens of the world and punish the minority infinitely for crimes that they are likely to commit in the future. <br>  <br>   As a side note I would suggest you look at your morals, readings, and teachings more critically and with the assumption that everyone is not perfect, and thinks differently.<br>  <br>   Keep in mind that behavioral influences change and that you should think as a mass and not as a single unit, this is what has lead to the various civil rights movements in the world’s history. <br>  <br>   As an example, from my knowledge, 2000 years ago if you were to rape a virgin, you then had to marry the virgin, and pay the father 50 shekels, and then the sin of rape was then the woman's fault and not the mans. In today’s society, a rapist can get life in prison, which I believe is completely reasonable, as the victim can sometimes suffer a lifetime of mental problems and nightmares and relive their experience over and over effectively punishing them infinity. <br>  <br>   And antithetical in crime and punishment, as in the same time period as instanced former, a woman who was to marry and couldn't prove her virginity, was hence stoned to death. Whereas today promiscuity and smut is celebrated in some cases and in most of the modern world: Porn, Adult Movie Awards, Paris Hilton, Etc.<br>  <br>   The grand moral of the story is: What is moral today, might change in the future, parallel with laws in that which may be illegal today, might be legal tomorrow. As also in the past in what was or was not immoral and/or illegal in the past is now, today in modern society, legal and/or moral, and they will have punishments which will or will not be fair but will be put into action by those who are thinking for the mass, and not the singular.|`|zUMvC6QEaa	The main punishment of hell is the state of definitive self exclusion from communion with God and the blessed, reserved for those who refuse by their own free choice to believe and be converted from sin, even to the end of their lives.

They are getting what they want - eternal separation.<br>  <br>  EDIT...We do not own our bodies and souls. They belong to God.

Since the Bible should be the basis for Christian belief then any beliefs which contradict what the Bible teaches does not meet the standard of the genuineness of that label.<br>  <br>  Eccl. 9:5,?10: “The living are conscious that they will die; but as for the dead, they are conscious of nothing at all .?.?. All that your hand finds to do, do with your very power, for there is no work nor devising nor knowledge nor wisdom in Sheol,* the place to which you are going.” (If they are conscious of nothing, they obviously feel no pain.) (*“Sheol,” AS, RS, NE, JB; “the grave,” KJ, Kx; “hell,” Dy; “the world of the dead,” TEV.)<br>  <br>  Ps. 146:4: “His spirit goes out, he goes back to his ground; in that day his thoughts* do perish.” (*“Thoughts,” KJ, 145:4 in Dy; “schemes,” JB; “plans,” RS, TEV.)<br>  <br>  <br>  Matt. 25:46, KJ: “These shall go away into everlasting punishment [“lopping off,” Int; Greek, ko′la·sin]: but the righteous into life eternal.” (The Emphatic Diaglott reads “cutting-off” instead of “punishment.” A footnote states: “Kolasin .?.?. is derived from kolazoo, which signifies, 1. To cut off; as lopping off branches of trees, to prune. 2. To restrain, to repress. .?.?. 3. To chastise, to punish. To cut off an individual from life, or society, or even to restrain, is esteemed as punishment;—hence has arisen this third metaphorical use of the word. The primary signification has been adopted, because it agrees better with the second member of the sentence, thus preserving the force and beauty of the antithesis. The righteous go to life, the wicked to the cutting off from life, or death. See 2?Thess. 1.9.”)<br>  <br>  *** Reasoning from the Scriptures p. 174 Hell ***<br>  <br>  What does the Bible say the penalty for sin is?<br>  <br>  Rom. 6:23: “The wages sin pays is death.”<br>  <br>  After one’s death, is he still subject to further punishment for his sins?<br>  <br>  Rom. 6:7: “He who has died has been acquitted from his sin.”
0WB5Tru5aa	DC: I'd like to elaborate a bit further on your point.<br>  <br>  The picture gets even weirder when you consider that god is supposedly all-powerful and omniscient. This would mean that god knew in advance what people would choose. This means that he truly did create the devil evil, since by manipulating the starting point he could have altered the outcome of things and made people to choose differently. Yet he did it even knowing that were he to create the devil "as he is" he would essentially cause him to become evil.<br>  <br>  What kind of mental gymnastics do people need to actually believe this? It's bizarre behaviour to say the least for a supposedly good entity.|`|OtKzExi3aa	I know this is long, but at least it answers your question...so...<br>  <br>  SECOND QUESTION<br>  <br>  <br>  Why are devils created? Almighty God created Satan and evils; what is the wisdom in it? Isn't the creation of evil, evil, and the creation of bad, bad?<br>  <br>  <br>  T h e A n s w e r<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  : God forbid, the creation of evil is not evil, the desire for or inclination towards evil, rather, is evil. For creation and bringing into existence look to all the consequences, whereas such desire looks to a particular result, since it is a particular relation. For example, there are thousands of consequences of rain falling, and all of them are good. If through ill choice, some people receive harm from the rain, they cannot say that the creation of rain is not mercy, they cannot state that the creation of rain is evil. Rather, it is due to their ill choice and inclination that it is evil for them. Also, there are numerous benefits in the creation of fire, and all of them are good. But if some people receive harm from fire through their misuse of it and their wrong choice, they cannot say that the creation of fire is evil, because it was not only created to burn them. Rather, they thrust their hands into the fire while cooking the food through ill choice, and made that servant inimical to themselves. <br>  <br>  In Short<br>  <br>  <br>  : The lesser evil is acceptable for the greater good. If an evil which will lead to a greater good is abandoned so that a lesser evil should not be, a greater evil will then have been perpetrated. For example, there are certainly some minor material and physical harms and evils in sending soldiers to fight a jihad (here, it is not talking about the jihad that kills innocent people...it means if a country attaks you, you should defend it from the soldiers who are trying to harm you...I just said this in case you misunderstand...), but in the jihad is a greater good whereby Islam is saved from being conquered by infidels. If the jihad is abandoned due to those lesser evils, then the greater evil will come after the greater good has gone. And that is absolute wrong. And for example, to amputate a finger which is infected with gangrene and has to be amputated is good and right, although it is apparently an evil. For if it is not amputated, the hand will be amputated, and that would be a greater evil.<br>  <br>  <br>  Thus, the creation and bringing into existence of evils, harms, tribulations, satans, and harmful things, is not evil and bad, for they are created for many important results. For example, satans have not been set to pester the angels, and the angels cannot progress; their degrees are fixed and deficient. However, in the world of humanity the degrees of progress and decline are infinite. There is an extremely long distance through which to progress, from the Nimrod's (Nimrod is a bad person...I don't know if you know him...) and Pharaoh's as far as the veracious saints and the prophets.<br>  <br>  Thus, through the creation of satans and the mystery of man's responsibility and the sending of prophets, an arena of trial and examination and striving and competition has been opened so that coal-like base spirits may be differentiated and separated out from diamond-like elevated spirits. If there had been no striving and competition, the potentialities in the mine of humanity which are like diamonds and coal would have remained equal. The spirit of Abu Bakr (the Prophet PBUH's friend) the Veracious at the highest of the high would have remained on the same level as that of Abu Jahl (the Prophet PBUH's enemy) at the lowest of the law. This means that since the creation of satans and evils looks to great and universal results, their being brought into existence is not evil or bad. The evils and instances of bad that arise from abuses and the particular causes known as inclination or choice pertain to man's choice, not to Divine creation.|`|4tmmPb3Kaa	God cannot be considered evil because God is perfect.

Even with Jesus dying on the cross to get that relationship back with the lord...Satan has been busy........think for a moment about the non-believers...........they are a result of Satan being busy.<br>  The Lord is tired of all that, so He shall return and take Satan out of time-out and punish him and his followers. But before that is to come about, Satan will be busy for a short period, before Jesus returns to do judgment. Then heaven and earth can rejoin and God's people can live in peace and harmony with the Lord, like in the time that the Lord intended to be for Adam and Eve.|`|AMkMHOAyaa	1ST THING GOD IS KICKING IT IN HEAVEN WITH HIS ANGELS EVERYTHING IS ALL GOOD,THEN YOU ALWAYS AS USUAL GOT A HATER LIKE YOU HAVE HATERS NOW, THE DEVIL WANTED GODS POSITION SO GOD COULDNT LEAVE HIM IN HEAVEN BECAUSE HE WAS BAD,, SO GOD HAD TO GET RID OF HIM AND HIS ANGELS,, THEN I DONT NO QUITE WHAT HAPPENED FIRST BUT ADAM AN EVE WAS IN THE GARDEN AND THE WORLD WAS SAPPPOSE TO BE GOOD BUT HERE COMES THE HATER AGAIN HATNG ON GODS ESTABLISHMENT AND TRYING TO TEAR THINGS UP AND MESS EVERYTHING UP IN GOD THERE IS NO BAD THAT IS WHY HE KICKED SATAN OUT OF HEAVEN,, GOD ALWAYS FORGIVES AND GOD TESTS AND THE DEVIL TEMPS SO WHEN YOU FEEL LIKE THINGS ARE GOING BAD THAT IS GOD TESTING YOU TO MAKE YOU STRONGER TO SE IF YOU ARE GOING TO STAND ON HIS WORD READ JOB IT WILL BLOW U AWAY|`|VQmHIrStaa	God made a couple mistakes...<br>  <br>  <br>  That's why he spent the Old Testament wiping people out, regretted making man(Noah's Ark story), got jealous over the other gods, etc.|`|LQsh261waa	The Bible teaches that all good things come from GOD.Satan had a free will and chose to be evil.

aGRJ6MPdaa	One reason is the confusion created when tradition and culture clashes with discovered fact and translation between languages, especially between ancient and modern ones.<br>  <br>  Personally, I think people tend to create their own version of God in their minds. The more "creative" they get, the more "fascinating" God becomes to them. The idea is that the more "fascinating", "unique", and "inexplicable" we make him, the more reason to be in awe of him. <br>  <br>  I don't see God that way. When I read the Bible, I see that God is just a regular "guy" like the rest of us, except He's supernatural and knows everything. One thing that always sticks out in my mind is the fact that He feels hurt like we do. As inferior as we are, we can still hurt His feelings.|`|wkmdKFxJaa	Greedy people wanting thier own respect and power start thier own religion.|`|SOlh57iKaa	Unfortunately many don't have an accurate knowledge of the scriptures. In alot of home the bible has become a piece of furniture on the shelf. Most just take another persons word for it meaning or just believe what the family has always believed. Additionally we have to factor in Satan's influence on religion. According to 2 Cor. 4:4 Satan tries to confuse people, he ultimate doesn't want us to even believe in the bible, nor God.  <br>  <br>  Today, many religions don't teach from the bible. Jesus condemned some of the religious leaders that were around during his days on earth. He called them hypocrites and said “You know neither the Scriptures nor the power of God.”—Matt. 22:29, 23:27,28. Those men held a position of authority and was prominent religious leaders. The same is true today many men hold a position in their religions organizations to teach others. But just because they hold a title "Priest, Preacher, Minister, Deacon, Pastor"etc... is not a guarantee that they are a man of God. Some priest have done some terrible things to children in recent history.<br>  Last thought, <br>  Jesus said this “Not everyone saying to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but the one doing the will of my Father who is in the heavens will.<br>  When you get a chance read Matt 7:13-23.<br>  Those religions didn't have Gods approval and the same applies to many religions today.|`|N4AyqN5Baa	theres one truth difference between me and the rest of the world excluding some is i know the truth and its out there! for example let me make you think!<br>  <br>  IS THERE A SINGLE SCIRPTURE FOR SUNDAY WORSHIP ......NOT ONE! all the churchs admit it<br>  IS HELL ETERNAL NOPE AGAIN ................ talks about sodom and gomorraha being a example for eternal hell fire.<br>  UNCLEAN FOODS YEA THAT RULE IS STILL BINDING!

Jesus went to the cross to be victorious over death. He rose on the third day. He is the Lamb of God. This means he is a perfect sacrifice for your sin pardon. Otherwise God poured his wrath of judgment on his Son. Jesus was innocent, but took your sin's as the perfect Lamb of God for an atonement. The reason you hear of the term Born Again, is a person who trusts in Jesus and repents of sin, and trusts his soul to the saviours atoning power. He has a new life, and is forgiven, and free of sin. You and I are still sinners, but know who to go to for forgiveness.  Jesus is his own interpretation, and the religious crowd cried crucify him!

She sends her with a trousseau, a waiting-maid, and a horse for each of them; the princess's horse is named Falada and has the ability to speak. The queen takes a small knife and cuts herself, putting three drops of her blood onto a white handkerchief and bids her daughter to keep it with her, as it will aid her on her journey.<br>  <br>  The princess and her waiting-maid travel for a time, then the princess grows thirsty. She asks the maid to go and fetch her some water, but the girl refuses and so the princess goes and drinks water from the stream from her goblet. The princess sighs and the drops of blood - hidden in the princess's bodice - reply, "If your mother only knew, her heart would surely break in two." The princess and the waiting-maid travel on, and the princess grows thirsty again. By that time, the princess had forgotten the waiting-maid's rude speech earlier and asks the waiting-maid again, "Waiting maid, please fetch me some water with my goblet for I have grew thirsty again." "No," she replies, "if you are thirsty, go and get it yourself. I shall not be your waiting maid any longer." The maid sounded stern and furious, so she stops by herself and drops her goblet to be the same as everyone else. She drinks with her hands. While she is not paying attention, the handkerchief with the drops of blood on it falls out of her bodice and into the stream. The princess does not notice this.<br>  <br>  Deprived of the magical protection of her mother's handkerchief and blood, the princess is defenseless when the maid makes her change places, including horses and dresses. When they reach their destination, the maid continues the charade, going so far as to have the princess' horse, Falada, butchered, for fear he will reveal the secret. In addition, she informs the king that the princess is merely a peasant girl procured for the journey and now unneeded. He puts the princess to work in his castle.<br>  <br>  The princess - now a goose girl - promises the butcher a piece of gold if he would give Falada a proper burial. The butcher hangs out Falada's head on the wall of the gate. Every morning, as she drives out the geese with Conrad, the goose herder, she sadly greets Falada's head and Falada's head repeats the same words previously spoken by the drops of blood: "If your mother only knew, her heart would surely break in two." Every day, she combs her hair in the pasture. Conrad always tries to steal some of the golden locks, and she charms the wind to blow his hat far away, so he can not return until she is finished.<br>  <br>  Conrad goes to the king and declares he will not herd geese with her any longer because of the strange things that happen. The king tells him to do it one more time and watches; when they return, the king asks the princess to tell him her story. She explains that she took an oath not to tell. He tells her to tell her troubles to the iron stove and eavesdrops while she does so. The princess, in her sorrow, tells the entire story - that she is a princess and that her waiting-maid has conspired against her.<br>  <br>  Upon learning this, the king causes royal garments to be given to her as befits her station, and brings her to the prince's attention. At dinner later that evening, everyone has eaten and drunk and are quite merry. The princess and the waiting-maid are present, although the waiting-maid does not recognize the princess in her new finery. The king tells the princess's story without naming any names, and asks the waiting-maid what the appropriate punishment would be. The waiting-maid answers that such a person should be put naked into a barrel lined with nails, which should be dragged by horses from street to street until the person is dead. The sentence is carried out on her, and the prince marries the true princess."<br>  <br>  One of my favorites.|`|XVYe1MnYaa	a midsummers night might it be

The first about Moses and the second about the entire story.  These are really questions that are not one and the same.<br>  <br>  To try to answer both of your questions, archaeological evidence does not support evidence of Moses, but might support evidence of an Exodus event in some form, though probably not to the extent as depicted in the book of Exodus.  The archaeological evidence suggests that there might have been an Exodus event around 1250 BCE based on alignment of other scriptural texts and the Egyptian history.<br>  <br>  Archaeological evidence gives some credibility to the story, but not exactly as written.  We don't really know because it was at least 3000 years ago.  People today doubt events in living history in which there are living witnesses, tape recordings, photographs, physical evidence, and careful documentation.  Extrapolate this to 3000 years and you can see the margin for doubt.<br>  <br>  In responding to your comment about Jonah, a more careful reading of the text will reveal that Jonah wasn't swallowed by a whale, but rather by a big fish (Jonah 1:17).  We read whale into the story because that's what we know of big fishes, that they're usually whales.  That said, a whale is not a big fish because a whale is a mammal.<br>  <br>  Why do you ask?  What bearing does the answer of this question have for you?  Is it necessary that the story be factually accurate for you to have meaning in your life?  While it may not have happened exactly as written, this does not mean that it is without meaning or truth for our lives.  In connecting back to Jonah, we have to be careful to not read into the text more than is there, and yet conversely must also look into the text to discern what it means for our individual lives.|`|LuN1unJ3aa	Given that Moses is credited with writing the first five books in the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament), which is considered the Law, it is highly likely that he was a real person, particularly from the Jewish perspective.<br>  <br>  One of the problems with history, is that external (non-Biblical) history is limited to certain parts of the world. Egypt is well-known for having rulers that liked to wipe out existence of previous rulers or political forces. It would be a little like George W. Bush wiping out all evidence of Bill Clinton. Or Barrack Obama wiping out all evidence of George W. Bush and his father and the influence of the Republicans on government.<br>  <br>  A better example comes from revisionist history that makes the claim that the holocaust did not take place and that it is all fictional tripe.<br>  <br>  Given that the dead sea scrolls contain significant copies of some of the first five books of the Bible and date back at least 2,000 years, I would suspect that anyone making the claim that Moses was a fictional character is barking up a tree that doesn't have much substance.<br>  <br>  It should be noted that lack of evidence (and personal belief) does not prove that something did (or does) not exist.<br>  <br>  I don't believe in rape, yet it happens.|`|VQmHIrStaa	Outside of the Bible, there is zero evidence to show he existed period!<br>  <br>  In fact, the Egyptians never used Hebrew slaves and the pyramids were built 100% by paid workers.

It was written in its current form many centuries after the period it purports to describe (the chaos of the Mediterranean world at the end of the Bronze Age). It is possible that there was some kind of social group in Egypt called the Apiru, as some of the Egyptian sources suggest, and it is most certain that there was a period of social disruption and migration around the end of the Middle Dynasty. It is possible that the Exodus story contains a remote memory of this. But the Hebrew people of Old Testament times were socially and ethnically indistinguishable from their Canaanite enemies. All the available evidence suggests that the Hebrew people emerged from Canaan as just another Canaanite tribe worshiping a Canaanite deity.|`|dmTVbpcWaa	Sure he existed. Consider the Modern Day Jews who in fact celebrate the Passover which is a Jewish holiday beginning on the 14th of Nisan and commemorating the Hebrews' liberation from slavery in Egypt.Moses was there at the time- in the thick of things when Pharaoh finally let the Hebrews go.<br>   Jews back then & today know  that Moses was Used by God to liberate the Hebrews, so to ask if Moses existed is an Insult to Millions if not Billions.|`|eO2rnf7yaa	Moses was very real.  I would call the pyramids pretty darn solid evidence that the Egyptians used slaves.  <br>  <br>  I find it interesting that you ask if there is any historical documentation of Moses.   What do you consider The Bible?   I my opinion,  the book of Exodus may include some allegories,  but that does not mean Moses is  a fabrication.  The Jews were enslaved by the Egyptians,  and they were led out of bondage by Moses.   I think some of the details might be allegorical,  but the main story is true.|`|uFAoq4idaa	Yes Moses exist. Although there are writings now a days that says that the Jews had not been in Egypt and the story of Moses is an allegory but the Bible does not lie. God will gather all His people from all parts of the earth in these last days. God considered the Egyptians as His people because Moses was a part of the Egyptians. He even considered the Assyrians as His handiwork because Abraham and Sarah were part of them. And He will unite the three of them, Egypt, Assyria and Israel in the later days before Christ Jesus returns here on earth. Isaiah 19:23-25In that day there will be a highway from Egypt to Assyria. The Assyrians will go to Egypt and the Egyptians will go to Assyria. The Egyptians and Assyrians will worship together. In that day Israel will be the third, along with Egypt and Assyria, a blessing on the earth. The Lord Almighty will bless them, saying , "Blessed be Egypt my people, Assyria my handiwork, and Israel my inheritance." How blessed will be that day when Israel will be at peace with all His brethren with Abraham. This was one of the reasons why God did not destroy Nineveh when they repented upon Jonah's preaching. Because they are His people. Remember when the king of Assyria  besieged Samaria in 721 BC the Jews living in Samaria were taken captives to the lands of Assyria. They were the Ten tribes of Israel. And Samaria was resettled by the people from Assyria. God knows where His people are and He will gather them all in the land of Israel. God knew Moses. He was mentioned in the New Testament.|`|lAMdAKmzaa	Literal person.<br>  <br>  There IS evidence.

First, you believe that religion is too strict, but religion is also profoundly permissive. It just depends on the theological paradigm. You cite cliques and unacceptance in your church, but assuming you attended a very large church, you have still only met some 0.00000025% of all Christians, so you really can't characterize Christianity or religion with any rational accuracy. You cite bloodshed caused by religion, which makes me inclined to believe that your opinions on history are based less on actual scholarship and more on what you have read on the internet. You mention "priests" making money on TV, which means that you don't even know enough about Christianity to differentiate between its largest factions (those aren't priests that you see on TV). <br>  <br>  See, you aren't thinking for yourself. Everything about this question indicates that you are still letting others think for you, you are just listening to different people now.

LuN1unJ3aa	It took some digging to get the spelling right, but the name rang bells. Huldrych Zwingli (1 January 1484 – 11 October 1531) was a leader of the reformation in Switzerland and like Luther, he worked toward reform in the Catholic Church.<br>  <br>  The referenced wikipedia article can help with many of your questions. Like Luther, he fought against the earliest of the Protestants, the Anabaptists, from which my Mennonite ancestors came.<br>  <br>  Unlike Luther, his ministry resulted in no church being formed, even though he preached his own unique brand of doctrine. He was influenced, to a certain extent by Luther, but not completely.<br>  <br>  While his impact on the reformation, particularly in his native Switzerland, is unquestioned, I find it interesting that he did not develop followers such as those who worked with Luther. His life and works are fascinating for several reasons, one of them being when he lived (at the very end of the middle ages) and the amount of material that is known about him.<br>  <br>  I strongly recommend the wikipedia article as a starting place for your study.|`|CQm0DJOHaa	lol lica do ur own hw|`|bVHnNqzBaa	Gosh, there's this wonderful invention called the Internet search engine.

iuarBJ9Aaa	As far as I know...it says NOTHING. Christians believe in celibacy and that all sexual behavior before marriage is wrong. <br>  <br>  I was raised around Jehovah's Witnesses who were taught all of this. The bible says "remain chaste" BUT NEVER DIRECTLY SAYS ANYTHING ABOUT MASTURBATION|`|ebcfaff0504724aa2ad756522576c3b2aa	Sexual impurity is definitely outlawed in the Bible and being involved in relationships which yield families and glorify God was how God first told us to use our sexuality:<br>  <br>  Then God blessed Noah and his sons, saying to them, "Be fruitful and increase in number and fill the earth. Gen. 9:1<br>  <br>  4Marriage should be honored by all, and the marriage bed kept pure, for God will judge the adulterer and all the sexually immoral. Hebrews 13:4<br>   <br>  Ephesians Chapter 5:3-5:<br>      Immorality or any impurity or greed must not even be mentioned among you, as is fitting among holy ones,<br>  4<br>      no obscenity or silly or suggestive talk, which is out of place, but instead, thanksgiving.<br>  5<br>      Be sure of this, that no immoral or impure or greedy person, that is, an idolater, has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.<br>  <br>  <br>  So if not even "obscene or suggestive talk" is allowed, how could masturbation then be allowed?<br>  <br>   I think this teaching from a Catholic website puts the whole thing into perspective. You could substitute "masturbation" for "contraception" in the first sentence and understand the logic here:<br>  <br>  "Contraception was so far outside the biblical mindset and so obviously wrong that it did not need the frequent condemnations other sins did. Scripture condemns the practice when it mentions it. Once a moral principle has been established in the Bible, every possible application of it need not be mentioned. For example, the general principle that theft is wrong was clearly established in Scripture; but there’s no need to provide an exhaustive list of every kind of theft. Similarly, since the principle that contraception is wrong has been established by being condemned when it’s mentioned in the Bible, every particular form of contraception does not need to be dealt with in Scripture in order for us to see that it is condemned."<br>  <br>  <br>  Likewise, every form of sexual impurity/immorality does not need to be listed in the Bible in order to conclude that it is outlawed. God also teaches us in the Bible by telling us what IS the right way to live our lives. If you want to read up on sexual morality and marriage verses in the Bible, this will become even more clear to you. This is like a case of "spirit of the law" rather than "letter of the law".|`|AA10574017	It says somewhere " Let thy nuts swell and become blue for in thy sleep willst thou be visited by the angel of relief"|`|qRue8Xdraa	It says you must rub real fast to feel the holy spirit.|`|fKyc1ccUaa	maybe you should go read the bible and prove it to yourself.|`|zTWmbN4Waa	it only applies to men.|`|7cjn2u9uaa	LOL at Solly, good one I will have to remember that one|`|an1b4pXxaa	I doesn't say anything about it.<br>  <br>  Onan spilled his seed on the ground so as to not get his sister in law pregnant as God had commanded him to do not because he was having a toss.|`|CjRfJbncaa	Masturbation is not mentioned at all in the Bible. The practice was common in the Greek-speaking world during Bible times, and several Greek words were used to describe the practice. But not one of these words is used in the Bible.<br>  <br>  Since masturbation is not directly condemned in the Bible, does this mean it is harmless? Absolutely not! Though it is not classed with such gross sins as fornication, masturbation is surely an unclean habit. (Ephesians 4:19) The principles of God’s Word thus indicate that you “benefit yourself” by strongly resisting this unclean habit.—Isaiah 48:17.<br>  <br>  “Deaden, therefore, your body members,” urges the Bible, “as respects . . . sexual appetite.” (Colossians 3:5) “Sexual appetite” refers not to normal sexual feelings but to passion that is out of control. Such “sexual appetite” can thus lead to one’s indulging in gross acts, as described by Paul at Romans 1:26, 27.<br>  <br>  But does not masturbation “deaden” these desires? No, on the contrary, as one youth confessed: “When you masturbate, you dwell mentally on wrong desires, and all that does is increase your appetite for them.” Often an immoral fantasy is used to increase the sexual pleasure. (Matthew 5:27, 28) Therefore, given the right circumstances, one could easily fall into immorality. <br>  <br>  How Can I Conquer This Habit?<br>   - Dealing With Guilt<br>   - The Value of Confiding<br>   - A Relapse Does Not Spell Defeat!    <br>  <a href="http://watchtower.org/e/200611a/article_01.htm" rel="nofollow">http://watchtower.org/e/200611a/article_...</a>|`|CODYtcwkaa	"Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with all your might" <br>  <br>  ka POW!|`|AA11466759	If your left hand offends you, cut it off.<br>  If your eye offends you, pluck it out.|`|jwKOANhpaa	"And it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD shall BEAT OFF his fruit"<br>  Isaiah 27:12

VLv3Vzjnaa	They wanted to save them from living in a country which actually followed the Constitution.  "All men are created equal" is a scary prospect to a group of people who redefine morality in a way which teaches that "treat others as you want to be treated" becomes "take away the civil rights from law-abiding, taxpaying, gay Americans."<br>  <br>  Also, they know that those promoting the anti-gay agenda have been using this scare tactic since the mid-1970's.  Anita Bryant used it first.  "Those awful gay people are out to get your children!"

VLv3Vzjnaa	The Mormon Church has been perfecting its ability to hide its involvement in anti-gay campaigns for years.   What we know is that the Mormon Church raised upwards of $30 million from their members, ran all the Yes on 8 advertising, and set up the biggest door-to-door statewide voter outreach effort that California may have ever seen.  They also ran phone banks in California and several other states, created an elaborate web site www.preservingmarriage.org with 13 very slick commercials and videos, bussed in thousands of people from Utah and sent out lots of direct mail.    <br>  <br>  They did not even admit they donated anything but a few letters and stamps until a lawsuit was filed against them. Then they admitted spending $190,000 in non-monetary contributions which most people believe is not even close to what they really did.<br>  <br>  As long as people are allowed to take away the civil rights of other Americans and call it "love" and hide it behind "religious beliefs," this problem will continue.

This shows more hatred than what is claim the Church has against gays. You are bashing a Church for a view of marriage that it holds extremely sacred.<br>  <br>  Where is the outrage against the Roman Catholic Church, Knights of Columbus, Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America, a group of Evangelical Christians led by Jim Garlow and Miles McPherson, American Family Association, Focus on the Family and the National Organization for Marriage. Rick Warren, pastor of Saddleback Church, California's largest, also endorsed the measure. The Bishops of the California Catholic Conference, the Grossmont Union High School District in San Diego County, California, the Asian Heritage Coalition? And the majority of blacks and American-Mexicans who also donated money and voted yes on prop 8?<br>  <br>  And no, the Church did not give these people any money to donate. Plus, they would not have lost their tax exempt status. That is only when a church supports particular candidates, not referendums. And, I didn't see any listing of what religion these people really were. Just because they live in Utah or Nevada does not mean they're all LDS<br>  <br>  Gays scream that their rights are being violated, yet it's okay to try to take away a church's and people's 1st amendment right to practice their religion as they see fit?<br>  <br>  And, FYI, there were a lot of Mormons who voted no on prop 8 because they felt that gays deserved the right to get married. So gays are also bashing people who support their position.|`|LJ6vHfgoaa	Maybe they put "student" to make it harder for you crazy stalkers to find them.

But I have a feeling that the 7th Seal will be opened in my lifetime.|`|ad08fe27604f983a2b098f5c3a9bdfa5aa	The rapture is an idea that was invented by American evangelicals in the 19th century.  It is based on Millerism, the school of "thought" that lead to 7th Day Adventism and to the Watchtower Society, which branched off Millerism early on.  In turn, Millerism is based on the visions of a woman in Scotland around 200 years ago.  <br>  <br>  I had never even heard of it until just over 30 years ago, when I heard that the son of some friends had been dissuaded from studying medicine.  He had been assured by his pastor that the rapture would occur before he could finish his medical degree.  That was about 1978.  <br>  <br>  The rapture has no basis except in a peculiar reading of scripture, designed to find evidence for it.  In other words, you believe in it first, then go looking for Biblical passages to support your belief.

Some peoples change with their moods/emotions.|`|YXGdwwTJaa	I think it depends on the lighting which causes various parts to reflect more than others.

Islam has nothing against leisure, whether it be games, watching movies, listening to music or hanging out with friends. Going to the beach, sightseeing or taking any sort of decent hobby. It just should come in a decent form, respectful of other human beings and respectful of oneself. Allah wants us to live in harmony to be beneficient to our communities and our surroundings. So the measures u need to take before any is: 1) Estafty Qalbak (which is listen to ur heart) 2) Ala'amal Belneyat (You should mean well by your deed) and 3) Your action should not harm any other human, should be respectful and decent .. and should not be excessively time consuming taking off time from more beneficial work..|`|a4crNiGdaa	of course muslims can play chess and other boardgames but we cant play it by the winner gets money from the other players<br>  you know...gambling<br>  thats bad muslims arent allowed to play it like that<br>  because it isnt good to play a game and the winner takes a the money of the looser<br>  i would never play it|`|zAfKvhW4aa	No, It is not true!!!<br>  <br>  Although, anything that would include Gambling, then YES!<br>  <br>  Any game were a dice is rolled, and a chance may happen upon is not allowed.|`|LMv6P1kNaa	This is the far extreme <br>  You will find the same with extremists in any other religion <br>  Majority of Muslims live normal  enjoyable life.|`|42pr8akBaa	Shite, sir.

The idea of them ustilising martial arts is preposterous, they didn't fight the Samurai, they avoided them since a fight with a highly trained professional swordsman could pretty much only go in the swordsman's favour.<br>  <br>  The notion of men sneaking about in black clothes is fiction too (had they actually done this they'd have worn blue which provides much much better cover at night than black).<br>  <br>  Modern Ninjutsu is reconstruction at best, utter nonsence at worst incorporating fighting skills designed (apparently) to combat the unarmed fighting styles of the Samurai and using weapons designed to disarm a swordsman.<br>  <br>  Most of what people associate with Ninjas comes from either the James Bond movie You Only Live Twice or from 60's/70's martial arts flicks (mostly American made ones too).<br>  <br>  It's true they were secretive but this is because were they discovered they would be wiped out, even by Samurai loyal to the one who hired them because what they did was considered the hieght of dishonour, killing without a fair fight.

utbfT0APaa	The Measure of a Lady  <br>      <br>    <br>   As most of us know, throughout the Victorian period there were strict codes of conduct that must be adhered to if you wished to be considered a lady or gentleman of good breeding.  Light on Dark Corners gives a complete list of do's and don'ts to ensure that you were always on your best behavior, when in the company of others who had also read the book. If a young lady desires to visit any public place where she expects to meet a gentleman acquaintance, she should have a chaperone to accompany her, a person of mature years when possible, and never a giddy girl.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	I think it's less of an age bracket and has more to do with the age difference between the woman and the person calling them a lady.  To a 14 year old, a 28 year old woman is a "lady."|`|EYqTV2EYaa	It depends on the person's age. For example, I'm 20, and my 4-year-old sister's friends call me 'lady.'

OZhQ7iO2aa	This is true...Beth Sarim means "house of Princes" It was supposed to house the faithful men of old from abel onward to be used upon their resurrection. In Fred Franz publication "the new world" it says"those faithful men of old may be expected back from the dead any day now". this was published in 1942 just a few years after the house was sold. The idea of these men being resurrected was abandoned in 1950 at a district convention in a talk given by Fred Franz (the same person who wrote "The new World"). He stated in his talk that the view had changed that the Society's (watchtower bible and tract society) appointees in the congregation already filled such a princely role.|`|lSqzljoCaa	It was a mansion that the JW's built to house Elijah and Moses when they returned on a specified date.<br>  When they didn't return, Rutherford moved in, and parked his cadillacs in the adjoining garage.<br>  The place became such an embarassment to the JW's that it was eventually demolished.

It's when there's a accident, an assault or even murder and no one does anything because they're expecting someone else to do something.<br>  <br>  EDIT: <br>  Found it.<br>  The Bystander Effect.<br>  The bystander effect is a social psychological phenomenon in which individuals are less likely to offer help in an emergency situation when other people are present. The probability of help is inversely proportional to the number of bystanders. In other words, the greater the number of bystanders, the less likely it is that any one of them will help.<br>  <br>  The case of Kitty Genovese is the most famous example of the bystander effect. It is also the case that originally stimulated social psychological research in this area. Ms. Genovese was stabbed to death in 1964 by a serial rapist and murderer. According to newspaper accounts, the killing took place for at least a half an hour. The murderer attacked Ms. Genovese and stabbed her, but then fled the scene after attracting the attention of a neighbor. The killer then returned ten minutes later and finished the assault. Newspaper reports after Genovese's death claimed that 38 witnesses watched the stabbings and failed to intervene or even contact the police. This led to widespread public attention and editorials that the United States had become a cold, uncaring society.|`|ttCkz39aaa	Geeze could it be they just don't care?|`|09ef400ecd1475bf913602053ad3f68aaa	I am so incredibly sorry for this loss. Your situation is heartbreaking. It is at the worst times , we know what people are really made of. It is so incredibly sad that people are so into themselves that out of decent instinct - they fail to help a fellow brother. <br>  <br>  I remember an incident about twenty years ago... where I witnessed something pretty bad. I was absolutely shocked that out of about twenty plus people, no one did a thing - they completely ignored the horror of what they were witnessing and went about their business. It was instinct that made me jump in action, and in less than a millisecond. My rational mind told me that everyone would feel the same as I and I could not believe I had do this by myself. I am blessed that nothing happened to me. I have no idea of the psychology behind this, but it is baffling. I know you will see your boy again one day, and I pray for the lord to comfort you.

It was originally a pagen fertility fesitval. Even the name is the name of their goddess of fertility, Oestre. All of the symbols of easter, the eggs and the rabbits, were also symbols of fertility. The date is the spring equinox, the time when daylight starts to exceed the hours of darkness and when verything starts to grow.|`|PaVyuYVUaa	its the day jesus was resurrected. meaning he died on the cross then came back to talk to the apostles. thats all i can remember off the top of my head. he was dying for our sins though and thats why we celebrate|`|24253948712de5dd1f43afb45a3a6dcbaa	It's about eating a whole load of easter eggs, yum yum can't wait|`|6p94a2fyaa	Every question has a short and long answer. Here is the short answer.<br>  <br>  The word Easter appears only once in the King James Version of the Bible, in Acts 12:4, where it is an obvious mistranslation. Why do I say that? Reputable scholars and reference works point out that the word Easter in this verse comes from the Greek word “pascha”, meaning Passover. Most modern Bible translations correctly translate that verse with the word "Passover". In fact, the same King James Version correctly translates that same word pascha to Passover in other verses like Matthew 26:2,17, 19; Mark 14:12; 1 Corinthians 5:7.<br>  <br>  So what is my point?<br>  <br>  My point is that the word Easter does NOT appear anywhere in the Bible. Nor is there any instruction concerning Easter found anywhere in the Bible! So where did we get all these Celebration ideas from?<br>  <br>  With all the popularity of Easter parades, Easter bunnies, Easter eggs, Easter sunrise services, Easter this and Easter that, ad infinitum, one would expect that the HOLY BIBLE would be replete (filled to the brim) with Scripture after Scripture mentioning the word 'EASTER' or at least instructions concerning the observance of it. Shouldn’t that be so?<br>  <br>  The best definition of Easter is found in the root of its meaning. It is taken from the PAGAN mythical goddess 'Eostre' (also known as Ostara or Ishtar), a goddess of the fertility, dawn, and spring. Such gods are pagan. They are NOT Christian. So Christians shouldn’t even have anything to do with them. And whatever such gods symbolise has nothing with to do with Christianity whatsoever. Whatever celebrations that are attached to such gods should not be observed by Christians in any way. They should not be attached to, combined with, or mingled with any Christian celebrations either.<br>  <br>  The celebration of the resurrection of Christ Jesus is called Passover. It is NOT called Easter. Passover is commemorated by the drinking of fresh grape wine, and the eating of yeast-less bread. It is NOT commemorated by people sending each other Easter bunnies, Easter eggs, or Easter whatever. Passover celebration has no specific date that it is to be commemorated on. The instruction from the Lord Jesus was that Christians must REMEMBER Christ’s sacrifice. Luke 22:19; Matthew 26:26 - 29; Luke 22:8 - 20; John 6:48 - 56; 1 Corinthians 11:23 - 29.<br>  <br>  Christ did NOT set a date or time for the celebration of the Passover. Christians must commemorate Passover whenever they can, preferably more often, NOT once a year on a specific day or date.<br>  <br>  The story with Easter begins supposedly that an angelic being descended from the heavens in a fertile egg (sound familiar?) to bring blessings to all the inhabitants of the earth. Somehow, by the time Christianity assumed a major role in society (around the third and fourth century A.D.), the leaders, also known as the church fathers, began to hunt for some form of symbolism to associate with the Resurrection of The LORD Jesus Christ. Thus, the fragmented and fictional account of 'Eostre' has become embroiled with the factual account of the Resurrection of our Lord Christ Jesus. Today many people celebrate Easter thinking they are celebrating the Passover. It is just a great deception. What people are actually celebrating is the pagan Eostre, the goddess of fertility. They are not commemorating the death and resurrection of Christ Jesus, the Son of God who taketh away the sins of the world. Easter is NOT the Passover. The two events have nothing to do with each other.<br>  <br>  Bottom line is, Easter is NOT a Christian celebration. Easter is NOT the Passover. Easter is NOT the commemoration of the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. Easter should not even be associated with the resurrection of Jesus Christ. Easter does NOT honour or symbolize Jesus Christ in any way. Easter is a pagan fertility celebration in honour of pagan goddess Eostre.|`|W0iF9wBYaa	EASTER IS ALL ABOUT REMEMBRANCE OF THE SUFFERING, DEATH AND RESURRECTION OF THE LORD JESUS CHRIST.

Seeing that you and your friend Liz do not see each other that much may be part of the reason why it happen. This is some thing that we all go through. For me it has been a life struggle. Being young it is just learning a bout sexuality and love. Being older it is just being battered by life's ups and downs for me.  As for being a lesbian I do not think so. This could be your first love of a norther person. You need to sit down and talk to Liz and talk about what happen and how she feels about it. You know that she is just as up set about this as you are. You do not say any thing about ever having a boy friend or kissing a boy.  You may like that better than a girl. As for your mom hating you I do not think so. As for me was this a wrong no. Liz and you have a great bond. she is your best friend and that is some thing hard to find. What you and Liz was a great thing to have happen to you Keep it in your hart as a greatest event of your life. If it never happens again it will be all right. As for it being wrong for liking it that is up to you to decide.No one has the right to say any thing about this but you and Liz. I know I have do a lot of things in my life that most would say it was wrong. but for me it was the right thing to do.

Even Jesus killed animals.  Clearly, God's admonition of killing was restricted to humans.|`|tW86bOMNaa	I think it's generally understood that the injunction was 'Thou shalt not murder' - ie, not kill illegally...
Gw1LLzDgaa	I have a friend, Everett -- he is mostly straight -- years ago he used to go to gay bars with me.  He would dance with me, hang on me (we were always very close and Everett has no hangups) -- and then let one of the prettier young women there to "convert" gay men (which is why they came to gay bars back then, I don't know about now) take him home.  Over the years we did that, dozens of women thought they had converted a gay guy to being straight.  He used to get a chuckle out of it (and laid) and it kept them off my gay friends. <br>  <br>  In my experience they seriously think they are going to change you to straight.<br>  <br>  Kind thoughts,<br>  <br>  Hermes|`|RSv2E2KNaa	I think women feels gay men are much nicer and good-looking of course. That's how women wants gay men so much than to straight men. That's interesting question I'd have to say. I would like to get some good answers from this question, obviously! :o)|`|vLzLk4m0aa	i'm guessing because of the absence of rejection....<br>  if they are strait and in a gay bar, there is no pressure....<br>  kinda dumb I'd say, but w/e|`|AZ6Z0pXJaa	Because -  they look hot!!|`|KG7hgsouaa	In my experience, It is because women don't want to get chatted up by straight men who only want them for sex, and they feel safe around gay men, but then when they get drunk, a man is a man and they chat them up. <br>  Not only that, but some might just be downright rude and just do it for fun.|`|ka6yGZWbaa	The last part of your question answer your question for you, it is 'cause they get "get completely shitfaced drunk" & then they don't realize what they are doing & there inhibitions get moved aside from there intoxication.|`|WvevK4n0aa	I've got a theory: straight women go to gay bars to hit on gay men because gays are more attractive and handsome than straight men,or at least in my country is like this|`|4qgggTE9aa	I think it's because they feel like that they don't have to worry about some guys making the move on them just to have sex with them. They do it because they want it and they think they are not being used. That is my opinion.|`|NS3BxXEmaa	It sounds weird why would that happen gay make love to men not women weird I guess because gay's understand women better then straight men do. I do not know ask a gay man no body knows better them them|`|HH90Eghaaa	Because the tables have turned! Girls finally get to be the aggressor! I know it sounds weird but when girls go to a straight bars, girls get immediate prowled upon by men. However when they go to a gay bar the guys don't think of them as fair game so they will actually talk to them without any strings attached! Then as the night goes on they get drunker and drunker and think that the nice gay guy wants them, but is just to shy to ask! So they go on the prowl! Lol!|`|HAHDipTAaa	Perhaps there is an element of Challenge in a woman that goes to a gay bar - perhaps she thinks she can turn us straight

I know what the bible says about who God is.  But I know of someone else who boasted like you did, he was once God’s most beautiful angel but God cast him out of heaven when he claimed he would be as the most high… his name is Satan.  Are you saying you’re related to him?  (I hope not). <br>  <br>  If we love Jesus the bible says God in heaven is our father, but if we reject Him than Satan is your father and he is the father of lies.  <br>  <br>  Best to you and whatever your choose.|`|OBh7uEd1aa	ALRIGHT.nos postulo nonnullus hic,, please|`|QlBLZ4tVaa	God, don't you have much more important things to do than wasting your time on Y!A?|`|MTi7r9l6aa	I'd ignore your question and move to a less boring-looking one.|`|mlxkiujYaa	Father please forgive me for I am a sinner|`|tuOe65Pcaa	My mind has been playing tricks.|`|YPtNr2O6aa	prove it|`|jinyM8fyaa	You're a c.u.n.t!!!
c1anFbMaaa	If I had a "religious experience" I'd probably research it scientifically - all of them can be answered by science, if it couldn't i'd do the same as you, look into spirituality as an answer.|`|VcM9zyikaa	i am an optimistic atheist, i go to church with my wife.  mainly to support her in her beliefs, but if there is a god out there then i am giving him every chance to prove it to me.  i have found my life is better now that i dont waste my time trying to have a god make it better.  i do it myself|`|qYZ2QFlbaa	Been there done that. I was an atheist. I've had a strange path to God for sure. I am now a Christian, I praise God, I love Jesus, I try not to sin. I'm married now so that's one sin down :) I am driven to spread his word, but will not beat someone over the head with my beliefs, some people like to debate. Which is fun at times.|`|kksq9BtOaa	if i had some sudden change of heart i would then simply be a deist because all the "holy" texts that exist are so pathetically human that they would be a insult to a god if it existed.|`|ORDjVHY4aa	I believe in an absolute Truth.  And whether I look at life through anyone's eyes that Truth is still the same.|`|rfMLIqMpaa	Doug8888: I bet you waste your time looking at porn and playing video on sunday.|`|PWankIUpaa	In other words you reject known Scientific fact which has already disproved your theories currently and you would then after seeing The Hand of God would chase after Satin as your god ! You already serve him why would you do That ?  Satin dose not care if you believe in him ,He only wants you not to believe in God so That  you will forever be the tortured in Hell with him! This will bring Him Comfort as he writhes in pain for eternity with you, his minion!<br>  <br>  Just what would it take to for The True God to get  your attention;<br>  <br>  Would coming to earth and showing Himself to You , would That work? <br>  <br>  Oh Waite He did that. <br>  <br>  Oh but you were not here on earth at the time... but He left witnesses to His comming......<br>  <br>  but you refused to believe them .......<br>  <br>  He even left you a book telling you about Himself but you refused to believe that too......<br>  <br>  mmmm <br>  <br>  seems to me you have made a religion out of Not believing Scientific Fact that God has put before your eyes to ignore Him.<br>  <br>  What more can He do!<br>  <br>  Of course if you Chose to Repent and Go th God He will accept you and then you foil satin's goal for your life but it is completely your choice?|`|aYVVwjBXaa	i'm an atheist and my best friend is a christian. i do understand why she believes what she does, and i support her, as she does me, even though i'm sure she would be glad to have me change my mind. i just believe what my heart tells me, as i know she does, even though i will never say with any definate surity that she is wrong and i am right.<br>  <br>  people believe different things, and thats okay. to all the people who say that the world would be a better place if everyone was a christian or if everyone was an atheist, i say the world would be a better place if we could all accept each other no matter what our beliefs are.|`|mDQZnI7gaa	Thats deep.  I think I would do something similar to what you said you would do.|`|OP6NUlvEaa	That would be interesting...but it wouldn't change my opinion|`|fL0wHyNNaa	I've been in both positions. Well, I've been a devout Christian. I can't say I've ever been an atheist, but agnostic would be a better description. I do feel something more exists beyond the physical realm, but I don't know what it is. I guess you might call me spiritual, but certainly not religious.... anymore.|`|OUbNSXjJaa	I think it will be a difficult mental exercise. Only highly experienced and adept people can try or attempt.|`|rV1uAtt3aa	I would write a gospel because clearly I was chosen to spread the word of God as I understood it.  I would found a church that would champion everything I believe in, and I would wage war on the false religions (which I would know included every other religion.) <br>  <br>  That's what prophets do.|`|9ozLBt5Qaa	Looking through someone elses eyes/life does not guarantee I'll become what they are. I may understand what they're going through but it does not mean I want to be them or believe in what they believe.|`|apcRdPhIaa	Waste a lot of time praying and going to church.|`|W7BZcdynaa	I did when I was on acid. I felt strange, but I would need to be on drugs to believe in anything that preposterous.
59f2d1b5dbf888248273d5883e729f99aa	Credit cards<br>  <br>  When my parents were young, very few people had credit cards.  The thinking was--if you wanted or needed it bad enough, you saved for it.  If you couldn't or wouldn't save for it, then you didn't want or need it all that badly.   It made you appreciate it, and take care of that purchase so much better.<br>  <br>  Nowadays the thinking is--I want to buy everything I've ever wanted this very instant--zip--put it on the credit card, and worry about paying for it forever.  Maxxed out in no time, and bankruptcy coming right up.|`|qGh1HhPwaa	sugar|`|AAgX0SDcaa	Methamphetamine is the first thing that comes to mind. Devil's candy. It is doing so much harm here in Oklahoma, even in the rural areas and all walks of life, even professionals get involved with it. Parents in prison, young children in foster homes or living with elderly grandparents, murders and other violent crimes, poison houses and cars from the meth labs, houses burned down, home invasions, gang violence, thefts from vehicles, auto accidents, chaos in families and child abuse, ruined teeth and health, additional burden on the state's budget from foster care expenses and increase in prisoners.  There was a triple murder here this week, a man turned in for meth dealing and he killed his cousin and 2 others.|`|MdyHKQRGaa	Good question. I'll have to think about that. Hold on.<br>  <br>  I think banning any substance is pointless because there are countless other substances that can take it's place.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ...I got it! Ban automotive racing! It's a completely meaningless activity!<br>  <br>  And golf! By all means ban golf!|`|fHcXBkN0aa	Illegal drugs. They have destroyed our youth and is the down fall of Society.

2R3iJnFPaa	The process started 2 years ago when my dad died.  I was 54.  When you've never married or had children I think you feel like a child while your parents are living.|`|XEbrGfZuaa	I think the full impact of that realization, came on the evening of my<br>  21st birthday. I was married, and we had our first born, and I was<br>  standing and ironing, wondering why my parents had forgotten my<br>  birthday. My husband and I were unable to afford a night out to cele-<br>  brate, and I was feeling the drudgery of housework, and the housewife<br>  routine. I was sad for being broke, I was sad mostly, that reaching<br>  21 was no big deal. For I'd already been drinking, and I was a married<br>  mom. So I felt there wasn't anything more to look forward to. I remem-<br>  ber that it was a very bleak day and evening.|`|ehnxg6Utaa	when I got in bed with my wife for the first time. :>)|`|64f1b88825b292a751bffc216f38edbaaa	when my sons started asking me to help planning for a pension for them.<br>  enjoy the day|`|AA12038658	It was when my daughter went to kindergarten and I realized "I'm an adult!!!!"

I am rather short and when I was eighteen a child asked me if I was a kid or a grown up and I realized that I didn't know.

Parents are always parents. My oldest children are now in their mid 30s, but I still regard them as 'children'. <br>  Sometimes I step back and think of my mother. When I was 36 and visiting England after 6 months in India on a  warm October day and knowing that my father had a heart problem, I said I would mow the lawn. A neighbour was relaxing in the garden in her bikini. My mother came to me, and said, 'Your dress is see-through.' <br>  My reply was, 'Do you want me to mow the lawn or not?' That's when I really knew I was grown-up.|`|SxI6y9GWaa	I don't think I'll ever grow up.  I've always been considered sensible, even as a child.

uVQ6OSu3aa	I love constructive criticism. And if its delivered well, then its accepted and I implement it.|`|0Ei3ePJzaa	I truly hate that term constructive criticism, let's face it, it's just corporate nonsense for "I'm going to tear you to shreds now, and if you don't smile and endure it, it's YOU who is in the wrong!"<br>  <br>  No criticism is "constructive" it doesn't help as most of the stuff they are complaining about, is in your nature and therefore, there's not much you can do about it.<br>  <br>  I always feel attacked if someone starts on that angle.|`|bf4cc388616ba9cb48357f54373c609eaa	Everyone likes to be complimented and a few of us seek praise.  None of us seeks criticism. However, I believe that if you are operating a business the customer most valuable to you and your business is the customer who criticizes you and the way you do business, if they are unhappy with you.  The customer who is unhappy, but does not tell you, is the customer that really hurts you.  That customer does not reveal your failures and you cannot improve if you are not aware of the areas in which you need to improve. You may find it difficult to accept constructive criticism and, more certain, straight out criticism but, that is actually a gift and a valuable gift if you are wise.|`|89d8b42fd2f09137ee437b1d438fa9a8aa	Although it shouldn't matter, I tend to consider the source. It's particularly difficult to accept criticism f/ those I don't respect.<br>  I had to go through rehab where criticism was encouraged/mandatory on a daily basis.<br>  I had to live w/ "If it doesn't apply, let it fly"<br>  But I still had to listen to it.<br>  Yes, there were times I felt attacked/disrespected.<br>  When the source was acceptable, I listened closely, pondered my interpretation and was grateful for their effort.|`|fpbLkbJzaa	Yes.<br>  My stock excuses are (i) I was raised under a torrent of critical jibes (large Irish Catholic family) which racked me off something rotten and (ii) so called 'constructive' criticism is often expressed in a destructive fashion.<br>  So I do have a problem - a knee-jerk sense of being attacked.  But I've learned, albeit with great difficulty, to control the spontaneous sense of fear/anger.<br>  And I've always reflected on conversations, exchanges, rows, etc in a detached way so as to check whether despite what is often expressed clumsily, badly, or offensively there might well points which are justified and taken on board.|`|AA11366224	I'm always glad to hear from someone who knows better.  Unfortunately, most people who think they know better, know nothing.|`|ku2tP4eEaa	No.  I am one tough hombre.  Constructive criticism comes in many forms.  If it is work related then yes it has to be considered.  If it is about a personal relationship then it depends on the value you place on said relationship.  It also depends on the source of that criticism.  We all know people we would ignore no matter what they say.|`|syIp6d2Naa	I think I do most of the time but there is always someone who comes at you with an attacking manner. Those I take with as much grace as I can and then later I will look at what was said, for it's meaning not it's offensive way it was presented. So many people have the problem of it not being what they said but the manner in which they present anything not just criticism.|`|mp1hh7dMaa	Hello,  Criticism i say bring it on i can always learn from it, so long as the criticiser can take criticism and just not a bully. Sometimes it takes someone looking from the outside to see the habits that we all form, some might be good others might be not so good, so a little criticism can put us on the right path so to speak.|`|o6MQWMo5aa	Depends on the constructive criticism. If I have written an article in "as I speak" chatty mode, I detest being told that a its not grammatically sound and their suggestions would make it read like an annual financial report.<br>  Couldn't understand the second bit as I am a bit dim.|`|Dmaahsc3aa	No it is not difficult when someone tells me I am doing something wrong . . .

I work with asylum seekers. I have to be neutral about politics and keep a certain detachment when listening to accounts of torture and inhumane treatment. <br>  Sometimes it is difficult. When an African, who has come to me for help with his asylum case, shouts at me, 'You whites are all the same', it's difficult to keep calm.<br>  I can accept constructive criticism, but when a complete stranger, having over heard my conversation with a good friend, from his country, suddenly says,'You know nothing about my country,' then I explode.  <br>  What right has anyone to make such assumptions?|`|DJLeObm4aa	Constructive criticism is easy to accept if delivered in the right way. Should someone nicely ask a word with you, give their opinion/criticism in a polite and rational manner then I would defnitely think long and hard about it and I think it most cases admit it was probably helpful. However if a person barges in head frist, perhaps be correct in what they are saying but shout and scream what they have to say it would immediately 'ruffle my feathers" and more than likely boil over and take no notice of what they were attempting to get over.|`|W8bs2VQSaa	I do have trouble with that one. "Constructive criticism" is almost always seen in the workplace, and when you've been putting in 100% effort into your work, and someone decides to do a "CC" on you, it can be pretty hard to take with a smile of humble gratitude ! <br>  <br>  At this stage of my life and my career, I figure that what you see is what you get. If my boss ever decides to give me a dose of "CC", I might just start deliberating upon the idea of retirement !|`|SxI6y9GWaa	Yes, if the person doing the criticising is using THAT tone of voice.  Some people can criticise constructively and in a gentle fashion that makes you listen and take in what is said without becoming upset.  Others - most - just heckle and attack; which makes one immediately close one's ears to everything that is said.  I think it comes down to diplomacy and few people have that talent.|`|AA11182621	No, I no longer get that personal attack feeing on any criticism coming my way.<br>  <br>  I truly believe that everyone get change the way they think and ultimately feel. In fact we do it all the time. Today we like Strawberry icecream tomorrow it must be nothing but pistachio. Today we like the person living next door, then something stupid happens and we avoid them. how crazy is that. <br>  <br>  When we get angry, we do not just make the world around us unhappy, but in fact we are unhappy too. OK we vented our feelings with aggression and force, but have we achieved what we wanted ...NO. In fact I fell downright miserable during the anger thinggy and afterwards for hours. What the hell was all that about, I ask myself.<br>  <br>  By understanding tht we are all fundamentally insane hahahahah, we then can begin on our road of finding sanity.<br>  <br>  By asking myself this question, I finally arrived by finding out it is all about my personal Ego, which has achieved nothing and never will. The hardest art finding this out, is actually admitting to myself. OMG was my Ego really that strong. Geez, so I set about trying of getting rid of it.<br>  <br>  In fact this Ego thinggy, got so bad that I became suspicious about peoples motives, always wanted everything My Way, and it resulted in me getting miserable and making other people miserable too.<br>  <br>  So I went to a local Buddhist centre where they gave some teachings on Anger management and just seeing the world and myself with different eyes or mindset. <br>  <br>  No it is not like  Born Again cult thing or something like this, or having to embrace another religion. These Buddhist are just so different in their approach, to anything I have ever come across in any so called Christian community. Totally unassuming and non judgemental. They are not trying to convert you to Buddhism either, which made me feel relaxed of going there.<br>  <br>  Now I can take any form of criticism and bear in mind that people meant it out of kindness, as they are trying to help me. How kind of them. <br>  <br>  I still go to the centre, jsut to remind me and especially to meet many of the new friends I made<br>  <br>  Anger gone, Ego reduced to a trickle, OK I am not a saint or an enlightened one, but no harm in trying .  hahahaha<br>  <br>  Just relax, remember not everyone is out to get you and people are just trying to be kind, even when they go about it in a bit of a clumsy way sometimes. No one is perfect - not even me ------- HAHHAAA|`|8ZpgIHMcaa	Sometimes - yes.  Sometimes - no.  It depends on who it has come from, when and how it is delivered.  I think constructive criticism is can be good and if I ask for and opinion on something then I have to be prepared for the answer.|`|R49w1Dr7aa	Try as I do I usually end up taking personally and feel attacked. I do consider if the person is correct but at the moment it is hard for me to detach.<br>  <br>  Great question.|`|ymQnEQigaa	I appreciate constructive criticism if it is done constructively...as it helps me to look at aspects of myself that will improve my character so no I do take offense...only take offense when it is not done constructively.|`|34090baae43bdcb8c4c4335f475f6aa1aa	Sometimes, it depends on how the criticism is stated.<br>  Some can be very ugly and sarcastic, others explain why it may help and how it will improve your overall being.|`|ac825b3aff0d9322a9befa72bcf651f6aa	That's what the gaffer calls it when he tell to stop nagging :)<br>   If I'm doing something wrong,or someone can tell me a better way of doing things,then I'm always open to constructive critism|`|EgXOeDP2aa	I don't do the constructive criticism anymore,<br>  I figure at my age I have been doing it my way<br>  too long to change.|`|AA11845254	sometimes I do.It depends on if my basic personality is being attacked.<br>  If its just who's team is best or my views on the candidate...or if I made a mistake at work...then I am good with that :)|`|59Wg2cI3aa	It would depend on the manner that the criticism was presented|`|AA12050428	I do find it difficult but in a major situation I was able to act ón my problem areas and I suppose sorted them out...a bit.|`|I83wdsIvaa	It's not a problem as long as it really is constructive.|`|9KBqN0KAaa	It's always nicer if someone agrees with you.<br>  <br>  but if it's done in a polite way then it's easy to take.

That's what I'm tryin to keep doing now that I'm outta the military.<br>  <br>  I like your last part:  "Or is it up to the rest of the world to accomodate you?"

AA10565336	I certainly do.<br>  <br>  The Preamble to the Constitution says in part, "promote the general welfare".  That does not mean to create a welfare state, and it does not mean to spread the wealth.<br>  <br>  We, the citizens of this land, do not have a right to an automobile, a color TV, a home or even health care.  We have a right to those things that allow us to earn those privileges.  And, when we pay (even if we are forced as in Social Security) we should expect to receive what we paid for.  A few years ago a money magazine published an article.  It traced SS tax on $10,000 a year for a working lifetime.  In the end a standard savings account would have had $880,000.  The SS "trust fund" has been hijacked so instead of anything real the people who worked and paid their taxes will be getting the shaft.  That's what happens in our country.  If a politician sees a pot of money it keeps them up at night until they figure out some way to steal it.  I lived in Alaska for a few years.  They have a permanent fund from the oil company's activity.  Each year each citizen get a check from the interest on that fund, and each year some politician tries to make an end run to get at that pot of money.

AA11047076	Blood sacrifice was never the only way to atonement. A Korban Chatas (sin sacrifice) was only brought for an accidental transgression of the most severe sins. A Korban Asham Tal? (A sacrifice for doubtful guilt) was only brought if a person was uncertain if they had transgressed a sin for which they were compelled to bring a Korban Chatas. What sins were these? Only those for which the punishment was kares (spiritual excision).<br>  <br>  edit:  Ignore the rubbish in that ole bingo caller's answer- its just the standard lies that anti-Semites like to spread about the Talmud<br>  So why am I not worried even about those? Firstly- the number of sins that have kares as a punishment is minimal- so the need for a korban chatas is unlikely. But their is another thing- even for a korban chatas no blood was needed. Where do we know this form? Simple- the type of sacrifice was dependent on status and financial applicability.<br>  <br>  So- a king or Kohen Gadol (High Priest) had to bring a bull. A normal person (kohen or otherwise) had to bring a female lamb, a poor person brought two birds (either pigeons, doves or swallows- the exact species is subject to debate) and a really poor person brought flour, oil and frankincense. Now, in my experience there is no blood in flour (change your brand if your experience differs!) so from there we can see that it is NOT the blood that is important, but the act of atonement in accidently having broken a major commandment.<br>  <br>  So, how about for deliberate sins? There NO SACRIFICE was brought. Instead, the ONLY atonement was from the persons sincere desire to repent, and them taking actions to change their lives to not repeat the same offense. That's it. The Talmud states that some had the custom to bring a Korban Todah (Thanksgiving offering) or a Korban Shelamim (Peace offering) when they repented- but that was from a personal desire to do something- there was no requirement to do so!|`|3ZgOAUOTaa	there are three methods of atonement in the tanakh, sacrifice, as already mentioned, (not all sacrifice was blood either); repentance; and charity (as in 2chr 6:36-39, and elsewhere)<br>  <br>  the concept of blood being required comes the christian interpretation of leviticus 17:10-12; the jewish interpretation is "Don't eat blood, because blood is used in atonement rituals; therefore, don't eat blood."; not that blood is required to atone for sin.<br>  <br>  micah 6:8 is primary - "what doth the LORD require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy god?"|`|X5hTmAkBaa	Sanhedrin 58b.

When people come to know the love of Jesus, there is an eagerness, a "burning desire" to tell others the good news of salvation. At Pentecost, the image of the Holy Spirit is depicted as fire. That fire symbolizes zeal. Paul the Apostle was zealous before God met him on the road to Damascus; and Christians know that zeal remained in his pen as he wrote many books or epistles.<br>  <br>  Doubt steals the joy of a Christian. Like the seeds that the sower sowed, sometimes our faith as Christians is attacked- eaten up, choked or starved. Some people find that life is no longer worth living or they may begin to question where God is when they need Him most. This leads to a form of godliness- going through the motions - but lacking the power that comes from fellowship with God and relying on guidance from His Holy Spirit.<br>  <br>  Finally, think of the present unemployment situation. Do you think those who are involved in crime love their fellowmen or even themselves? Do they love and obey God? During a time of test, only those who emerge successfully from the vicissitudes of life will survive. The same is true of the Christian experience. Faith,hope and love will endure to the end. The greatest is love because God is Love. Those who maintain a relationship with God to the last breath will be saved.|`|D3sFM6cyaa	Many people will reject the Lord, but whoever accepts the Lord will be saved.
vVfH8yBYaa	I was always surprised by this, too. Catholicism is the largest Christian tradition in the world, so by definition there's no way we're a cult. And yet, people love to use that word in reference to us.<br>  <br>  I think a lot of it has to do with the history of the church. Until the 1960s, the Mass was said in Latin. That freaked people (non-Catholics) out. Made the Mass seem mysterious to a fault... but it's not said in Latin anymore. Hasn't been for nearly 1/2 a century. Then there are the priestly robes and garments. This bothers people, too. But other Christian traditions wear robes and holy garments without being labeled a "cult", so what's up with that? And we have (what I loving refer to as) "smells and bells". The "rituals" of the faith. For us, this is comforting. Ritual ties us to our roots. It is a way of binding people together in community. We chant, we burn inscense, we ring bells. Wow! That makes us a cult?<br>  <br>  The fact is, people who label the church a "cult" don't really know what they're talking about. They are misinformed, uneducated, and unwilling to be instructed on the faith. You could talk 'til you're blue in the face and they're not going to change their beliefs about our beliefs.<br>  <br>  Thanks for asking this question. It helped me reinforce the reasons I love my faith. I practice the rituals of my faith in order to become more a part of my religious community, the Universal Church. Catholicism.<br>  <br>  P.S.

It uses psychological coercion to recruit, indoctrinate and retain its members.<br>   <br>  2. It forms an elitist totalitarian society.<br>   <br>  3.

You sounded confused.<br>  I'm not blaming you.<br>  Well, some people call Catholicism a cult because they think too highly of Mother Mary, even to the point of worshiping her. while the Bible clearly states that we should not worship other Gods, let alone humans.<br>  <br>  Except, personally, I think calling Catholicism 'cult' is a little too harsh.<br>  After all, Catholics do believe in the trinity and Jesus as their personal Saviour, and in the end that's what matters most, doesn't matter if you are Baptis,Methodist,Anglican or Catholic.|`|ewWUFWyWaa	All religions are plain crap for the low IQ masses.to function in our society...|`|AA12213253	I never heard it referred to as a cult,  but I do know that it's closer to paganism than true Christianity. Catholics pray to virgin Mary more than they do Christ. They bow down and pray to statues of Mary. Catholics also pray to different saints much like the Hindus pray to different dieties which again is forbidden by God Almighty. <br>  <br>  "Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth: Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God..." -Exodus 20:4-5<br>  <br>  "I am the LORD: that is my name: and my glory will I not give to another, neither my praise to graven images." -Isaiah 42:8<br>  <br>  Catholics treat the pope as if he's some god on earth. He's only a man. He's not worthy of being worshipped. <br>  <br>  Ever notice Catholicism emphasizes the worship of the virgin Mary over Jesus Christ? This can be traced back to ancient Babylon with Nimrod and his mother/wife Semiramis, who claimed that after Nimrod died he became a god thus making her a goddess. There is absolutley nothing in the Bible that says we should worship Mary. <br>  There are so many other things I could discuss like rampant pedophilia within the Catholic church which the Vatican knew about but only tried to cover it up instead of trying to stop it. Think of all the lives that have been damaged!<br>  But why be surprised? The roots of the Catholic church are satanic. That pretty much would explain it all.  Just do some research.

kKXZsaLyaa	Will science and logic work? Or was this just more mindless rhetoric from the atheists that use this forum as a means to slap each other on the back for asking the same questions over and over and over and over and....<br>  <br>  If you are inclined to study science or engineering, you'll run into a principle called the Scientific Method.<br>  <br>  The Scientific Method stipulates that any theory, postulate, idea, etc. worth investigating further must meet the following three criteria:<br>  - it must be predictable<br>  - it must be observable<br>  and<br>  - it must be repeatable<br>  <br>  Evolution states that, at infinitesimal odds, the offspring of a certain species will be of a different, "more evolved" species. Evolution doesn't know when it will happen; therefore, it's not predictable. We haven't observed any evolutionary speciation; therefore, its not observable. And evolutionary speciation is certainly not repeatable...or else George Carlin's "why are there still monkeys" line would be painfully true.<br>  <br>  Creation states that the offspring of any species will always be of that species. That's the prediction. It is observable and it is certainly repeatable. Therefore, Creation meets all three criteria.<br>  <br>  So, according to the scientific method, Evolution is a garbage theory and Creation is legitimate.<br>  <br>  Using logic, doesn't the existence of creation necessitate a creator? By definition, we call that creator God.<br>  <br>  For all the others that like to practice selective, subjective science, please give me thumbs-down.

The thing was the whole country [UK] pretty much seemed to come to a grinding halt both on that day and the day of her funeral, yet my children 6 & 5 wanted and quite frankly deserved a nice day out, so half the local places where closed up like she was a member of their family, so we took a picnic to the beach where we all ran around having fun, but some miserable old sod HAD to come up and suggest that we showed more manners towards the dead etc etc sorry but my kids are alive and just as important [if not more than any one else]    The day of the funeral was a nightmare, we had to get into work at least 2 hours early so that certain jobs could be done so that for the duration of the funeral there would be silence........we was allowed to stop and watch the thing but I had brought in home work / reading and spent my time doing that. BUT to be honest each and every minutiae of the whole thing was done to death and by the time she was buried I was more than glad that it would be at an end, NOT glad that she died in anyway but the whole nitpicking etc was sending my crazy.|`|9XAqnmOQaa	None on my life, but then I find the idea of "royalty" silly.|`|AA12288062	It certainly effected her sons,especially Harry.There would be no question about who Harry's father "really" is,because Hewitt would never have dared to make money off of the subject.Hewitt had already betrayed Diana with his book about their affair.But he would never have hinted,erroneously,since Harry was two years old when the affair started,that there was a chance Hewitt was the father,because Diana would have sued him. Harry's troubles at a young age that involved drinking would possibly not have occurred;he would not have that nagging Hewitt factor hanging over him,people commenting about him behind his back...Diana's guidance would have also prevented the "Nazi Costume Fiasco" as well.

hIuWPD3xaa	Remember the stirring words which Sarah Palin used as the climax of her speech at the GOP convention ?<br>  "It was Ronald Reagan who said that freedom is always just one generation away from extinction. We don’t pass it to our children in the bloodstream; we have to fight for it and protect it, and then hand it to them so that they shall do the same, or we’re going to find ourselves spending our sunset years telling our children and our children’s children about a time in America, back in the day, when men and women were free. "<br>  Few people knew of that speech, because it was from a recording distributed nationwide, but intended to be played only in private coffee-klatches organized by a conservative campaigned designed to prevent the adoption of MEDICARE. THAT was the threat to American freedom he was talking about! This campaign instructed its participants not to let this recording be publicized, for fear that some other than their brain-washed participants might learn of it and expose its ludicracy.<br>  <br>  During this same period, Reagan ended a campaign speech by predicting that if Goldwater and his plans — ncluding making Social Security voluntary— were defeated, the consequences for “our children” would be dire: “we will sentence them to take the last step into a thousand years of darkness.”<br>  <br>  A Conservative Rep of the Canadian gov. was asked on C-Span (or Canada's equivalent) about the "problems" with the Canadian health care system and his response was that there are always wrinkles to be ironed out, but he didn't know of ANY Canadians who would give it up.<br>  (Not even for our U.S. "best system in the world"?!?)<br>  Only idiots who believe Rush Limbaugh types imagine that Canadians envy the U.S. health care system!|`|b62aa03435c366476a024d6636bd1414aa	I have to agree it would have helped everyone in the country from the doctors who are always getting sued to the insurance companies who are breaking all of us.<br>  To family's who loose their  homes because they got sick and the hospitals are vicious when they go to collect medical bills.<br>  The insurance companies only insure working men, so when you get sick and can't work the insurance drops you.  How do they get out of it?  They say well  you can continue the insurance but it will cost $thousands of dollars a month to keep it.  Knowing at this point you cannot come up with that kind of money.<br>  We need to do something to get rid of these big insurance companies.<br>  Pay all that money into a government fund and when the house gets blow away, the government fund pays to have it rebuilt.<br>  Make it non-profit fund.|`|om7oslzcaa	Liberato has said it all.

Not to mention the profiteering and UBER-opportunistic pharmaceutical companies.<br>  <br>  But, please allow me use an analogy to support the rest of my view.<br>  <br>  In 1900, there were over a thousand different producers of automobiles. They were mostly for the very, very wealthy. As such, most people rode horses, walked and, for longer trips, took a train. <br>  <br>  We've all walked and taken trains and many of us have ridden horses. So, we know how poorly adapted we'd be in getting around without cars. <br>  <br>  Imagine, though, that the government were expected - in 1900, when each car was hand-made, not very dependable, impossible to repair, etc, and cost about a million of today's dollars - to provide automotive transportation to all Americans.<br>  <br>  The government would be bankrupt in no time. Instead, the government supplied only education and the promise of railroads, both of which laid the concepts for finer craftsmanship, engineering and auto roads. <br>  <br>  The rest took care of itself. <br>  <br>  Same here. We know we need more professionals in medicine. <br>  <br>  The answer is certainly not to just pay whatever the inefficient AMA wants but, rather, to outlaw organizations like the AMA and ABA, quadruple the number of doctors, nurses, pharmaceutical engineers, etc, and get competition to a fever pitch so as to bring down prices. <br>  <br>  Dealing with the profiteering mongrels who control the upper mgmt of the pharmaceutical companies might be reasonable govt intervention. Correct me if I'm wrong. <br>  <br>  ...|`|sxXoLSPxaa	real socialist or communist scheme. why should i pay your medical bills?

This Gospel (The Good News) actually contained the Words of God because of course, it was the Gospel of The Kingdom of God which was preached ONLY by Jesus. There is not even anything as the Gospel of Jesus as noted by Mark 1:1. The words of the Gospel which Jesus (pbuh) preached, were not his words as he says: <br>  <br>  JOHN 14:24 He that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings: and the word which ye hear is not mine, but the Father's which sent me. <br>  <br>  Matthew and John were actually the disciples of Jesus (pbuh). But did they really write these Gospels by themselves. Do we have Gospels “BY” Matthew and John? From an account in the Gospel of Matthew, we can clearly see that this Gospel is not written by Matthew himself: <br>  <br>  MATTHEW 9:9 And as Jesus passed forth from thence, he saw a man, named Matthew, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he saith unto him, Follow me. And he arose, and followed him. <br>  <br>  If Matthew would have been the author of this Gospel, he surely would have written that “.. and he saith unto “ME”… and “I” arose and followed him.” <br>  <br>  Luke and Mark were not even the disciples of Jesus. Luke was a physician and a companion of St Paul and Mark was an interpreter who probably worked with St Peter in Rome. <br>  <br>  The Gospels also differ from each other a lot: <br>  <br>  Was Joseph the Son of Jacob (MATTHEW 1:16) or was he the Son of Heli (LUKE 3:23)? <br>  <br>  Why isn’t the ascension of Jesus (pbuh) to heaven mentioned in Matthew and John? <br>  <br>  These Gospels which were written down 100 Years after Jesus (pbuh) ascension, circulated anonymously, no names were attached to them until almost 200 and the Christian theologians who came up with the idea of having a New Testament was condemned as heretic. <br>  <br>  Do we have that True Gospel which Jesus Christ (pbuh) Preached in Hebrew or Aramaic? <br>  Did Jesus (pbuh) asked Matthew, Mark, Luke and John to write these Gospels? <br>  How can Christians rely on the accounts in these Gospels which are the basic Pillars of their Faith?<br>  <br>  All Christian doctrines are the work of Paul, based on his desire to gain favor--and new converts--among the non Jews of his time. By incorporating pagan beliefs into the teachings of Jesus, Paul achieved phenomenal success in his ministry, but at the price of tearing down everything that true monotheism stands for. In so doing, Paul abrogated all teachings of Jesus and gave mankind a set of beliefs that have plagued his sense of reason ever since. It is here --the true nature and role of Jesus, as opposed to the Christian view of such -- where we find the fundamental difference between Islam and Christianity.|`|RPLsG63caa	then are they really believers? the kingdom of God is the theme of the bible from Genesis to Revelation. it is the fundamental teaching of Jesus. i only see one religion out there preaching about God's kingdom daily. they believe. i guess others just talk a good game but prove nothing|`|AA11648578	Lakely, there is only one Gospel and the good news has always been the atonement and resurrection of Jesus Christ.<br>  Jesus said,<br>  <br>  John 6:51 I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.|`|1VaH8D3Raa	Because someone has to tell someone all about it <br>  .<br>  And it is not common knowledge that all are born with <br>  .<br>  All have to be convinced that it the bible is real<br>  .<br>  And not just a story in a book<br>  .<br>  And people are still trying to convince others <br>  And try and try<br>  .

Only God knows all about you, and only He knows what is best for you. Why trust anyone or anything else? Furthermore, He loves you and He wants you to bring every problem and every concern you have to Him. The Bible tells us to turn to God and "Cast all your anxiety on him because he cares for you" (1 Peter 5:7).<br>  <br>  Begin by turning to Christ, confessing your sins to Him and by faith asking Him to come into your heart and life.

PoxcQk5Gaa	If morality is only an opinion, then we are forced to concede that pedophilia isn't necessarily immoral.  I hate to have to use such a distasteful example, but if we believe morality to be subjective, that's where we end up.<br>    Also, if society determines morality, then what shall we do about the theocracy that decides atheists will be exterminated?  In their minds, that is moral, but is it really moral?<br>    We could try popular vote, but suppose 51% of the population decided that certain minorities shall be denied basic human rights?  Does that vote make this practice moral?  Those of you in America upset about proposition 8 should identity deeply with this false concept of democracy deciding ethics.  If gay marriage were to be prevented, it certainly shouldn't have been decided by popular vote--good grief!!<br>    Morality transcends human experience, and human beings recognize that an absolute standard of right and wrong exist, otherwise, how could we have laws, if the immorality those laws are based on are not absolute?  If morality is subjective, then the laws based on that morality would have to be subjective, but they're not, they are objective.<br>    I contend that we recognize absolute rights and wrongs because God, the moral law giver, endowed us with that awareness.<br>    Just remember, if morality really is only opinion, then you cannot call anything right or wrong--even the most disgusting crimes you can possibly conjure up|`|MU71ihZjaa	The bible is the foundation all morality should be formed from.

I have compassion for people, therefore I must kill as many as I can" (Aum Shinrikyo cult, who released poison gas on Tokyo's subways as an act of good morality, because to them it didn't count as 'murder').<br>  <br>  Everyone knows basic morality like not stealing, killing, showing compassion etc., but when it comes to the practicality of how these ideals are to be viewed, interpreted etc. it becomes a contradictory mess.|`|kTaa8ejpaa	Of course it is.

AA11688085	I dont feel intelligent.  rather i feel that most religious folk are cognitively compromised|`|d7c8ecd624fbbc0797b1502ba6682e8baa	Occam's Razor<br>  <br>  Since there is no data that requires a deity to explain, putting one into the equation is an extra hypothesis, and unwarranted.|`|g4AAZRuxaa	Well I know this for sure it as nothing to do with intelligence, to decide if God exist but Faith.|`|XTyAMS5yaa	It's not that we feel any more intelligent in looking at the evidence (or lack thereof) and saying, "Ok, deities don't exist." I at least feel intelligent when I can look at other things and learn things. Just because I'm an atheist doesn't mean my I.Q. goes up ten points. I bust @ss to be smart.|`|LGBNKuxRaa	I suppose declining to agree with several thousand years worth of fossilised opinions isn't so easy, if you happened to grow up believing it. I kind of agree with you though, it seems a bit of a no-brainer.|`|6d10d96d77b1df1496e4b66f2f0098bcaa	Most of us had parents who tried to indoctrinate us into a religion.  At some point we used our ability to critically examine the assumptions and evidence and found it wanting.|`|UutLVO2Laa	You don't have to be intelligent to realise God doesn't exist. All you need is common sense.|`|FwdBKodSaa	The existence of God is not a scientific question in its prime importance but a prime deliberation about how I view my life and existence. To believe in God means I am responsible to God for what I do and things or events, even the most minute or least significant, have eternal value and worth. As I have not given life to myself I look for the aim of my life elsewhere than in my own desires. To deny God means that whatever the reality, I choose myself as the ultimate determination of my life and existence. With God non-existing reality does not matter for if I die everything is lost for me. So while I am here on earth I do whatever I like, live my life without principles that others have given me since I believe everything is just a question of viewpoint. Now from among these views the former is viable and humane, the latter inhumane and destructive, plus logically nothing can originate in itself, the existence of God is given as a  necessity preceding the existence of all else. God is the ultimate existence  being the cause of all else to begin to exist and go on existing. It is only in God as the Creator that things and events get sense, value, worth and meaning. I wish we all meet in heaven one day.|`|JCG4aLCPaa	As a Christian I can only offer my opinion as to the reason anyone would not believe in God and that is that their hearts are hardened to the truth.  They rely on their own limited intelligence rather than on the infinite wisdom of God.  The hedonism of the end time generation is becoming more prevalent every day.|`|1LZdc4K5aa	Like the others said, most atheist just stepped back at one point and realized the silliness in religion. It's really just a way to deal with and explain things that people don't understand, like their own mortality. In fact, many times it's a political lever to manipulate the population into that nations beliefs. So, no, you don't have to be intelligent. You just have to be able to see the big picture, without parts being blurred by your religion. Then you might realize why some of us are atheist.|`|TmjDXY9gaa	I guess it's because we're in a minority. being in a minority of people always makes you feel different, special, like you're standing out. That's exactly what we feel. That we MUST be intelligent because we've somehow managed to find our common sense enough to realise something that the majority dont seem to see.<br>  <br>  hope this helps :)|`|qhvGdLufaa	If you deny God, then you have to deny your own existence, which is impossible. No matter how knowledgeable or intelligent you are, you cannot deny that there has to be a supernatural force that has created our planet, our bodies and the universe and, that creator is God weather you believe it or not, but trust me they're too dumb to understand that and I don't know why lol, not like I care.|`|H24DtUKOaa	Well we're not all that intelligent - we're just capable of abstract thought. If you step back from the situation and look at it, it's pretty clear that god doesn't exist. If you don't, and you believe only what you are told to believe, you are incapable of abstract thought - which is said to be the only thing that separates us from animals.<br>  <br>  Also, bear in mind that many religious cults/groups have been CERTAIN that the world was to end. Hundreds of different religious groups expected the world to end on the year 2000. But we're still alive.<br>  <br>  There is no god. Live your own life, don't expect him to live it for you.<br>  <br>  EDIT: If there is a god.. I'll see you in hell! LOL|`|ZxUAyv3Caa	Atheist feel this way because they dont have faith in Gods plan.

tW86bOMNaa	Hard to know how to assess it for you, to be honest...<br>  <br>  As a piece of prose poetry, though, it appears overly literal and lacking in sufficient imagery, metaphor and so forth to be assessed as particularly good.<br>  <br>  Sorry... Maybe try re-reading some of the other psalms and assessing what makes them work as poetry?<br>  <br>  ADD - Try, for example, giving some imagary that relates to the 'judging' aspect: We should not seek to sit upon his chair - for example... Something like that, which takes it out of the literal.<br>  <br>  ADD 2 - In a way, yes... You could think of it as making it more 'abstract'. By this, I mean think of an image or a scene that you would associate with the act of, say, judging. For example, you might imagine God sitting on a high, white throne as he judges. You may not, can not sit on that chair... So how would you express yourself in that context?<br>  <br>  Your second effort is *much* better: you use the image of being 'high' to stand for the act of judging - and thereby remove some of the literal phrasing in favour of something that paints a picture.<br>  <br>  Generally, in poetry this is what you want to achieve: to paint a picture in your reader's mind, so that from that picture they take away the image that you wish to communicate to them. Don't simply *tell* them what you want to tell them; but rather, make them tell themselves.<br>  <br>  Does that make sense?<br>  <br>  ADD 3 - May I suggest something like this?<br>  <br>  All of his creations, God loves; but<br>  We ourselves aren't worthy for to judge;<br>  For He alone has height enough for this.<br>  <br>  I've tried to give it some rhythm and a little pacing, but to keep the images and the tone that you selected.<br>  <br>  Okay?|`|3IXDx9nhaa	No comment then!|`|lJ2baVliaa	I think it sounds great!

No person inherits original sin, nor is anyone held accountable for the sins of others.<br>  <br>  This is in contrast to various Christian concepts of original sin, which teach that people are born in a sinful state with the ancestral burden of Adam and Eve's sin. Salvation in Christianity is achieved through baptism and belief and worship of Jesus, whom Christians believe is God incarnate, and whom they believe died to atone and redeem mankind's sin.<br>  <br>  The Naturally Pure State of Fitrah<br>  Islamic doctrine teaches that all people are born fundamentally good with a natural inclination to worship one God (Allah). This innocent, sin-free state of birth is called fitrah. An upbringing in a religion other than Islam can deviate a person from this natural state.<br>  <br>  Although born without original sin, a person is vulnerable to committing sins and becomes accountable for them after the age of reason.<br>  <br>  Adam and Eve and Islam<br>  The Qur'anic account of Adam and Eve holds that both were equally responsible for their sin of eating the forbidden fruit. Although they were banished from Paradise as a punishment, God forgave them after they sincerely repented. Their sin was not passed on to future generations, and Adam became the first prophet and messenger.<br>  <br>  Jesus and Redemption in Islam<br>  Muslims highly revere Jesus as a prophet, and like Christians, believe in his miraculous virgin birth and in his second coming. However, the Qur'an explicitly states that Jesus was man, not God. The Qur'an teaches that Jesus ascended body and soul into heaven, and that another man was crucified in Jesus' place.<br>  <br>  Since Muslims believe that people are born inherently good, and that God loves those who obey Him, there is no concept of redemption in Islam. Muslims strive to earn God's pleasure and rewards based on their own merits.<br>  <br>  Concept of Sin in Islam<br>  God created man with free will to either obey Him or not. In Islam, sinning includes all actions which contradict the commandments or Will of God.<br>  <br>  In Islam, no person is held accountable for the sin of another. The Qur'an states: "Whoever goes right, then he goes right only for the benefit of his own self. And whoever goes astray, then he goes astray to his own loss. No one laden with burdens can bear another's burden. And We never punish until We have sent a Messenger (to give warning)." (Qur'an 17:15)<br>  <br>  Repentance (Tawbah) and Forgiveness<br>  <br>  While Muslims fear their accountability on the Day of Judgment, they are hopeful for God's mercy. Muslims believe that sincere repentance (tawbah) and good deeds can help atone for their sins, and that God is Merciful and Forgiving.<br>  <br>  "Say: O my slaves who have transgressed against themselves! Despair not for the mercy of Allah: verily Allah forgives all sins. Truly He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful." (Qur'an 39:53)<br>  <br>  Islam teaches that there is only one sin which won't be forgiven: shirk. Shirk is the association of partners with God, or any other compromise of Islamic monotheism and the divine Oneness of God.<br>  <br>  Salvation in Islam<br>  Muslims do not believe in salvation on the merit of faith alone. On the Day of Judgment a person will be fairly judged according to his Islamic beliefs, his actions, and his efforts to sincerely repent. Ultimately, however, it is the Mercy and Forgiveness of God which will admit a person to Paradise, and not just his faith and deeds|`|MTi7r9l6aa	Why would every prophet have to make this offer?

QqxZzvbAaa	Lion= King of Kings<br>  <br>  Lamb= sacrifice|`|QjlWEapVaa	Jesus Christ is the Lion-Lamb.  He is the Lion of tribe of Judah, full of strength and fierce towards the enemy, Satan.  As a Lion, He defeated the old Serpent, Satan.  Christ is also the Lamb of God who takes the sin of the world.

In fact ‘lion’ and ‘lions’ are mentioned more than 100 times in Scripture. In Nahum Chapter 2 they are referred to figuratively as royal leaders ruling over Assyria.<br>  <br>  In Genesis chapter 49 Jacob blesses His twelve sons and prophesies over his son Judah declaring, "Judah is a lion's whelp; from the prey my son, you have gone up, he bows down, he lies down as a lion, and as a lion, who shall rouse him? The scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh comes, and to Him shall be the obedience of the people."(Gen 49:9-10)<br>  <br>  The above prophesy speaks of Jesus as the Lion who would come from the tribe of Judah. The Messiah would also be the Lawgiver and his people would obey Him.<br>  <br>  In Revelation Chapter 5:5 John is told "Behold the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has prevailed to open the scroll and to loose its seven seals." (Rev5v5) Interestingly John then sees a Lamb, as though it had been slain being worshipped!<br>  <br>  Jesus the lamb<br>  In the Old Testament lambs were continually being slain as an offering for one’s sins. In the New Testament, following His one sacrifice for sins forever, Jesus sat down at the right hand of God. When Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist, he announced "Behold the Lamb of God who comes to take away the sin of the world!" (John1:29)<br>  <br>  During His incarnation Jesus was subject to His Father's will before He was exalted with the Father, reminiscent of His former glory. Jesus was even silent before His accusers, like a lamb to the slaughter, though He gave His life and it was His love for the world, not the cruel nails that held Him on the cross.<br>  <br>  Jesus explained this clearly when He said "I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd gives His life for His sheep." (John 10:11)|`|5c9011543d498dda04d1562813072559aa	He came the first time as the Lamb of God---the sacrificial offering for our sins.

Where is your school located  I wonder ?|`|ddWK5JRKaa	Dear Cameron:  I have to say, you are sort of lucky that you have the chance to hear what the religious people have to say and form your own educated opinion about it. You can decide for yourself what it's about.  Right now, all you hear is the talk about sin and doing bad things.  I think the maid idea of religion is to admit to ourselves in front of God that we are human and we can make mistakes (I don't mean that murder is a mistake, I'm talking about law abiding people who don't always act perfectly). Sins are the mistakes we make every day in not doing what we should. We know we are doing the wrong thing but if it doesn't really do harm it isn't so bad, right?  Okay, so we admit this to God and ask for forgiveness.<br>  You may not think it's necessary to do that, but some people do think it's a good thing. In your case, Cameron, you have been exposed to it and you can decide for yourself. Some people are forced to accept religious teachings and are not free to decide for themselves.  After this year you may not have to go church again and that is your right. At least you have the freedom to decide on your own.  <br>  You said your chaplain was reading it straight from the Bible. I don't think it was a Bible he was reading from, but probably a book of Daily Prayer. It has a whole section devoted to prayers that can be said each day. Some people think it's good to say the same things every day, but the Bible actually encourages us to make our own prayers and to pray as often as we feel the need to, not just in chapel or church services.  <br>  I think it's great that your school is ranked high and you obviously have a lot of intelligence.  It's good that you can take your knowledge of religion and decide how to proceed in your life.  For me, I am in the US and we have the same freedom you do. I like the fact that I have the freedom to look into all religions and decide for myself what I'd like to do about keeping it or not in my life.  <br>  Best of luck to you, my friend.<br>  ~Rob|`|Jj457iyJaa	Communion, it is a Christian Sacrament, communion, or the Lord's supper.

5ofS2qQYaa	yea...especially since we live in a society where children of those ages are pushed to make superficial relationships w/classmates and learn the reality of having a bf/gf the hard way<br>  seriously, ever since the kids in school are introduced to "valentine's day" they start seeing how society would like them to channel their interests in people: by putting it all out there and trying to get the others' attentions, etc.<br>  <br>  They complain about a "child" marrying the Prophet(sws) who was known for the best character throughout his friends and enemies !<br>  but they don't want to see the reality of children running away w/their b/f and g/f b/c it's "LOVE", but in reality it's lust rushed into affection and commitment. <br>  <br>  How can you pick on Aisha(ra) who was noted to be happy and well cared for under the Prophet(sws)'s roof...where everyone was generally happy and okay w/the situation<br>  but disregard your own "societal norms" where a girl her age can run away w/someone who doesn't love her, who just wants to use her, and NO ONE is happy?<br>  <br>  it's ridiculous, to be completely honest...this concept of having many temporary gf/bf-s is okay but being married to ONE person who is of the highest character and best example for humankind is not okay?<br>  <br>  there are clearly a whole lot of problems w/the "girlfriend/boyfriend" issue<br>  are there really any problems w/a young girl marrying a revered man for the sake of Allah(swt) and living a relatively happily ever after?<br>  any documented issues that you are fighting for?<br>  no<br>  <br>  the people who make such arguments are picking on every aspect that could be considered "weird" in their own society and attributing problems to where there really are none....<br>  that whole claim of "pedophilia" is disgusting...it's merely society's projection of their own problems onto a situation that doesn't have it in order to level it out in their own eyes...<br>  <br>  -.-;<br>  <br>  Allah(swt) knows best|`|Rb84jDiEaa	yea well i don't get it eitehr :-\ i mean if taht 12 yr old had a kid with his 15 yr old gf and ppl are okay with that, they should accept Prophet Mohammed (pbuh) marriage to Aisha.

This took place 700 years after that of the Prophet. How can you justify this? Does this mean, it was still the norm? At least Aisha (raa) didn't have any kids, but this one gave birth to two. <br>  <br>  Why are you judging someone 1400 yrs, by the current moral standard? That time people didn't find it unique or offencive, hence we can assume the practise was prevalent.

When in fact, she went on to be a narrator of hadith, and is the Mother of believers! Does this sound like an oppressed and abused female to anyone?? I think that ppl need to stop comparing the perverse and evil nature of child predators, to the actions of our beloved Prophet (Peace be upon him)-  Aisha was neither beaten, nor sexually abused, nor oppressed, nor stalked, nor tortured, nor murdered.<br>  <br>  peace (even to the ignorant, I pray that they may become enlightened).|`|EqMDbXPHaa	if you are bored by it don't read it or answer it. child brides were normal back in the 7th century but not kids with a 50 year old man. this man who is supposed to be setting an example as gods representative. you lot make me laugh, you  excuse mohammed for being a pedophile saying thats how things were then but not anymore but then you impose all those rules from the koran which are also out of date. you can't have it both ways therefore you think it is ok for me to have sex with a 9 year old well sorry but i don't think so.|`|6niE3wSCaa	yes...but from a neutral POV, the non-muslims do have a point.

That he "molested" her (nouzobillah) or watever you claim.Do you think if the Prophet (saw) ever did something bad to Aisha  (ra), she would have talked ill about him in the hadith she narrates. Do you think if the Prophet Muhammad (saw) ever did something bad to her, she would be the one that narrates the majority of hadith and out of all of those hadiths she never talked about the Prophet doing something bad to her.  You call yourself "Soilder Of Christ", Buh I bet that you dont even know what youre Bible says. You dont follow what Jesus taught in the Bible. Isnt there a verse in the Bible that says something like  "Dont judge others, or you too will be jugded"?  The only thing people like you can do is say stuff like "Jesus loves you" or "Jesus died for our sins" or "Islam this" "islam that" getting your info from Anti Islam web.But the reality is that you dont know SH1T!|`|iH7ZB5Soaa	From the age of fifteen to forty when the blood is fiery and exuberant and the passions of the soul enflamed, Muhammad PBUH sufficed and was content with a single older woman like Khadija the Great (May God be pleased with her) with complete chastity and purity-as is agreed by friend and foe alike. His then having numerous wives after the age of forty, that is, when bodily heat subsides and the passions are quietened, is evidence proving decisively and self-evidently to those who are even a little fair-minded that such marriages were not to satisfy the carnal appetites, but were for other important reasons and instances of wisdom.<br>  One of those instances of wisdom is this: like his words, the actions, states, conduct, and deeds of God’s Messenger (PBUH) are the sources of religion and the Shari‘a, and the authority for its injunctions. While the Companions transmitted the outward, public things, the transmitters and narrators of the private matters of religion and injunctions of the Shari‘a which were manifested from his private conduct in the personal sphere, were his wives; they performed this function. Perhaps half of the personal matters of religion and the injunctions concerning them come from them. That is to say, numerous wives of differing temperament were required to perform this necessary duty.|`|xuiwFNFYaa	Be bored! But that fact that your prophet Mohammed had took away Aiesha's childhood and was highly pervert enough to indecently have sex with a 9 year old child will never be erased of history. And what makes you know no body criticized him for it? It surely isn't going to be written in the Quran, and neither in the hadith. He got married to a child - FINE. If you're talking about child marriages, then you're right...no body minded about it back then. But we're talking about shamelessly sexually molesting a child. Would YOU, yourself give away your 9 year old child to marriage knowing that she is going to have sex with a man who is in his 50s? No. Why? Because you know that she is not at the age of having sexual relationships. It is just a matter of common sense.|`|H8WqMK1eaa	So when exactly is morality going to stop being subject to societal "norms" and traditions?<br>  <br>  When exactly is right RIGHT all the time and wrong WRONG all the time?|`|757ce30489e7f56556925d17f1f49f76aa	Yes, I'm sick of it really.<br>  <br>  And somehow something gets added each time.

d3VV4b6vaa	ugh don't get me started, especially about government jobs|`|s34GP3Ioaa	And what kind of work do you do?|`|poeWy4YCaa	I have wondered the same thing when I am standing in line. It happened at Office Depot the other day and I was assertive and said to the cashier I have other things to do and I have cash can I please pay and go and you can explain the ad  to her later! Sometimes at a convenience store I have thrown the money on the counter and walked out with my purchase. The problem is work ethics and incapable supervisors and managers.|`|HoZN9ab2aa	Yes, I do believe they are slow, but sometimes the procedures require them to find out further information or speak to the customers while they wait for the computer to finish what it is doing. It is not just the tellers and postal workers you should be blaming, though. It is the banks and post office managers who don't put on more staff. Instead, they leave it to the slow ones to take on the lunchtime customers. <br>  <br>  If you must do your personal business during the working day, why not ask your boss to let you take a break during the not so busy times and make up for the time off during lunchtime. Lunchtime is not the best time obviously to do the banking or going to the post office. There has to be a quieter time in the day to do these things.<br>  <br>  (I didn't think you'd like that answer, it would require a solution. You don't want a solution, you just want a quick fix - someone to get fired. Ever heard of internet banking? Or putting your cheque into a special bank envelope for quick deposits in the chute at the bank so you won't have to line up? ATM, perhaps? Or going to the post office on Saturday mornings? We have these services in Australia, you should check them out where you are.)
2o6qrGKdaa	HAHA. That made me laugh... I totally agree. I don't understand rap and how it's so big all over the world. It should be banned.|`|EYqTV2EYaa	Do you know the meaning of art? In the dictionary, the meaning is "The products of human creativity; works of art collectively." If a human , key word, CREATED something, it can be classified as art. Just because you think it is simple or nothing special doesn't mean it wasn't created. First of all, in Rap music, you have to compose a good instrumental to place a vocal on. The vocals, often times, are NOT merely talking, but reciting poetry in rhythm, and/or, while singing simultaneously. Also, you have to rhyme the words to go along with the beat too, which can be done simple (and that's not good rapping) or advanced, which is, rhyming an entire bar. Lol, people that don't rap may think it's simple, and may compose a very simply rap, but that doesn't mean it's considered good, unless your fan base are all preteens. Therefore, Rap is art, just an art that isn't well-liked by many. As for Rock music, people again, keyword, CREATE music by the use of instruments. Therefore, it's all art. Also, people that say Rap is crap don't even know crap about Rap. lol. They just listen to all the simple stuff from the South or contemporary radio. Better Rap is underground, characterized by which topics are different, and actually talk about things people want to hear, and simultaneously dance to. Rock on the other hand, is great depending on the genre, but usually, it's nothing more than overly loud music with a screaming voice on top. I'm guessing all genres have its bad points.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Well, it depends on what you want to call it. Actually, I SHOULD have mentioned you have to create it with your mind, then carry out the will create that certain thing. The shιt you've taken this morning was created AUTOMATICALLY by your body. For something to be considered art, you have to do it yourself. Fuc?, you CAN call your shιt art, but make sure your intestines get the credit. Also, to be considered an ARTIST, it has to be either a hobby or profession. Do you get paid to or find it as a hobby to shιt? I doubt it, but you can call yourself what you want.|`|poeWy4YCaa	Some people call it poetry in motion, but its mainly crap. Rock bands that create music with their hands and minds are not so bad.
tI7QP3dkaa	I shower in the morning because it wakes me up and makes me feel fresh for the day....   If a don't - I feel dirty all day and cannot function.  showering at night wakes me up and I can't sleep..|`|P544Sbmqaa	I shower before bed because it relaxes me.  And then I shower in the morning because my hair is just miserable if I sleep on it wet.  So to make my hair look half way presentable and professional, I shower in the morning to wash my hair. And, sometimes I sweat pretty bad in my sleep, so I actually do need a shower in the morning.|`|9ozLBt5Qaa	The same reasons why some bathe in the morning - to clean themselves. I know some people use the 'to wake me up' reason but thats so for them. You save more watre showering -if you dont take too long showering.|`|1CgCx1E2aa	Actually it is a scientifically proven fact that taking a shower in the morning wakes you up. but also. it feels better to wake up and take a nice shower, they feel so nice. I do shower during the week at night sometime for convenience (showers take time and if I do it at night i can sleep a little later in the morning) but it makes my hair look greasy sometimes.|`|qGh1HhPwaa	It depends somewhat on your job<br>  If you have a dirty job, you like to shower after work<br>  An office job, in the morning so you are clean and fresh for the day<br>  A shower makes you feel better, and its up to you to decide when you want to feel at your peak|`|apcRdPhIaa	One reason might be that people tend to unwind at the end of the day. Showering requires activity - its not relaxing as such, more refreshing.|`|FejlYWMBaa	I don't know if this is helpful but I do it because I get a bad rash for some reason (usually when I wake up) a shower just helps get rid of it!|`|pext8whdaa	on your bed has many many sheded skin. everytime you sleep on your bed many skin layer shed off. when you wake up in the morning sometimes it does give you that odd feeling. so that is why you shower in the morning.<br>  im not sure about office workers but all i know is that there surrounded by lots of dust and electricity applice.|`|DWqyK0Mbaa	I dont shower in the mornings..i cant.

rV1uAtt3aa	Because people are superstitious.  They fear the unknown and associate bad things with it.<br>  <br>  Could you imagine what it was like to be a caveman (or woman) and be cowering in your cave on a dark night, just a dying fire between you and whatever creepy crawly was out there waiting to eat you? <br>  <br>  Humans have probably associated devils with the night a lot longer than there's been a Satan.

Satan tempts all the time. The other thing I like to share with my coloured friends is that black is not the sin colour. The Bible relates the sin colour to the murder colour which is the colour of blood(red or crimson). Dark people(And I wish I was) are not more sinful than white and are not under some curse. My greatest friends are Aust Aboriginal Christians. We all have different battles with sin but there is no group that is any worse. Human history is bad because we are all equal sinners. Some religions have and still do promote racial inferiority. The man who carried Jesus cross was coloured, There is one race in the Bible, the human race.nev r|`|GGUDvicaaa	Ancient humans feared darkness and night? On the other hand, he is sometimes called Angel of light...|`|Ne3XNDRJaa	Funny, Lucifer is called a bright and shining star.....Son of the morning....<br>  <br>  Maybe we've read different accounts|`|PWankIUpaa	Because He obscures the Light of the Truth of God! He desires you to continue acting as you are and ignore God!  <br>  <br>  It is ironic that an angel who was made to Reflect the Glory of God as the angel of Light should help the creation of Gdo to keep their Spiritual eyes shut and worship the Darkness which satin is instead of Reflecting the Truth of God which he was made to do and instead brought himself and his angel followers down to eternal pain and torture and to top that off he defiles the earth and the people of earth God's greatest creation by deceiving them into darkness and Eternal torture.<br>  <br>  His motives are purely selfish , He wants to see God's Creation suffer in hell where he will be and this will give satin Comfort!|`|7FPvEWb4aa	You are right that satan is associated with darkness.<br>  <br>  You are mistaken that satan ONLY runs around at night.<br>  <br>  Ask your police department when most crimes occur.  Broad daylight or at night under the 'cover of darkness'?<br>  <br>  If you are a building owner and you want to help stop crime in your area, the first thing you do is install alot of lights.<br>  <br>  Criminals (and satan) don't like to be exposed.

It's only natural - humans sleep at night making us vulnerable to predators (in our evolutionary history) and this carries over then and even now.<br>  <br>   Also, as children are mostly afraid of the dark, it correlates with those who are scared of the 'devil' - at least in terms of intelligence.|`|49niWB6Qaa	Before street lights were invented, many crimes were committed at night, because no one could see the criminal well enough to arrest them, beat them up, etc. This may account for the association between evildoers and darkness.|`|9KBqN0KAaa	Because i guess bad people are meant to come out at night, it all boils down to stereotyping.<br>  However the name Lucifer (the devils name) means dawning of light, so i don't know how that makes sense.|`|ORDjVHY4aa	He is known as a beautiful Angel, an Angel of Light, a fallen angel, nothing about him lurking about in darkness.|`|MSHxYrLEaa	maybe he is the phantom of the opera?<br>  <br>  "the darkness of the music of the night...."|`|19d2b605b1e026eb10b142185a1dcabeaa	Because since ancient times predators lurked in the night.|`|Iq0b4FTwaa	ppl think evil and the night go together for some odd reason

This is a serious eating disorder that can lead to health problems and ultimately death.<br>  <br>  Your mother loves you and is worried about you.  Perhaps you could ask your mother to make an appointment for you to see a doctor about your eating habits and why you want to throw up after eating.|`|e50e6ca9411acd39c8aec91e4abe2b89aa	Why are you not eating in front of her? You need to speak with her about vomiting after eating and feeling ill. This is not normal and you need to seek medical attention. Obviously, as your mother she is concerned for your health and well being, she loves you that is why she is asking. She is seeing some changes or something which is causing her concern.<br>  <br>  Bulimia Nervosa is a disorder where the main characteristics are binge eating and compensatory behaviors in order to prevent weight gain. Bulimics are caught in the devastating and addictive binge-purge cycle.<br>  <br>  For individuals suffering from Bulimia Nervosa, the binge can be seen as a reward within itself and a way to cope with daily stresses and feelings. Bulimic binges usually consist of a larger than normal quantity of food, that typically are high in caloric intake. For individuals with Bulimia Nervosa, the binge eating usually occurs in secrecy and rarely in the presence of others.<br>  <br>  The types of food vary but are often sweet and/or high in fat content. Some binges are planned in advance by the Bulimic, but generally they are impulsive. Triggers for binges in Bulimia Nervosa include dysphoric mood, interpersonal stressors, boredom, prolonged dieting, and body image dissatisfaction.<br>  Bulimia Nervosa<br>  <br>  The binge eating in Bulimia Nervosa may temporarily numb the negative feelings, but this state is quickly followed by feelings of failure. The Bulimic is often ashamed of their binges and views the Bulimic behavior as a loss of control and a reason for low self-esteem. This is why it is often hard for Bulimics to come forward and seek help.<br>  <br>  Individuals suffering from Bulimia Nervosa follow their binge-eating behavior with compensatory behaviors in an attempt to counteract the binge episodes. The most common form of compensatory behavior for individuals suffering from Bulimia Nervosa is vomiting. The Bulimic usually induces vomiting directly following the binge.<br>  <br>  For the Bulimic, the act of purging may temporarily reduce the feeling of fullness and reduce their fear of weight gain from the binge. Some individuals with Bulimia Nervosa even look forward to the purging behavior as they enjoy the feeling of release the purging behavior temporarily affords.<br>  <br>  Other compensatory behaviors that individuals with Bulimia Nervosa use in an attempt to prevent weight gain include use of laxatives, enemas, diuretics, diet pills, ipecac, strict diets, fasts, insulin abuse, chew-spitting, and vigorous exercise.<br>  <br>  Bulimics, like Anorexics, are also obsessively involved with their body shape and weight. An individual with Bulimia Nervosa will often obsessively check their body size and weight through frequent weighing, measuring, pinching, and viewing themselves in a mirror. For the Bulimic, the individual's self worth is directly tied to their body shape and weight.<br>  <br>  Some of the common potential medical complications of practicing Bulimia Nervosa include cardiac arrhythmias, esophageal tears, electrolyte disturbances, gastrointestinal problems, and dental problems. For a complete list of potential medical problems for Bulimia Nervosa, visit our Medical Complications page.<br>  <br>  The medical complications of Bulimia Nervosa can be severe and like Anorexia, if left untreated can become life threatening.<br>  Bulimia Treatment<br>  <br>  You can and will overcome the binge-purge cycle, but you can’t do it alone.

8d4mZoPJaa	Ogni estate vado nella Spagna settentrionale con la mia famiglia; tuttavia, l'anno scorso ci sono andata con il mio migliore amico (if your friend is a female, then the translation is: con la mia migliore amica). Tutta la mia famiglia vive in Spagna, così, per questo motivo, non dobbiamo stare in un hotel, il che è fantastico perchè si risparmiano parecchi soldi. L'anno scorso siamo stati nell'appartamento dei miei nonni; è piuttosto grande e ha una bellissima vista della città. Poichè faceva molto caldo, abbiamo potuto andare nella piscina all'esterno, dove ci siamo abbronzati, abbiamo nuotato e giocato a tennis. In seguito, eravamo soliti andare in città per pranzo. I ristoranti sono fantastici lì, io adoro il cibo spagnolo. Quando finivamo di pranzare, facevamo un giro per la città. Mi è piaciuto moltissimo, perchè mi interessa molto la storia e la città aveva molti bellissimi edifici e monumenti antichi. C'era anche un museo molto interessante. Di sera eravamo piuttosto stanchi, ma questo non ci impediva di uscire a fare la 'fiesta'. Questo era il momento saliente dell'intera vacanza. C'erano così tante persone diverse da differenti parti della Spagna con cui abbiamo parlato. C'erano bancarelle con bellissimi vestiti e concerti all'aperto con musica tradizionale. Siamo andati nei bar per un drink e siamo rimasti svegli tutta la notte!

The Bible says the Church is the bride of Christ (Eph. 5:23–32). Jesus can have but one spouse, and his spouse is the Catholic Church.<br>  <br>  His Church also teaches just one set of doctrines, which must be the same as those taught by the apostles (Jude 3). This is the unity of belief to which Scripture calls us (Phil. 1:27, 2:2). <br>  <br>  Although some Catholics dissent from officially-taught doctrines, the Church’s official teachers—the pope and the bishops united with him—have never changed any doctrine. Over the centuries, as doctrines are examined more fully, the Church comes to understand them more deeply (John 16:12–13), but it never understands them to mean the opposite of what they once meant. <br>  <br>  The Church Is Holy (Eph. 5:25–27, Rev. 19:7–8, CCC 823–829) <br>  By his grace Jesus makes the Church holy, just as he is holy. This doesn’t mean that each member is always holy. Jesus said there would be both good and bad members in the Church (John 6:70), and not all the members would go to heaven (Matt. 7:21–23). <br>  <br>  But the Church itself is holy because it is the source of holiness and is the guardian of the special means of grace Jesus established, the sacraments (cf. Eph. 5:26).<br>  <br>  The Church Is Catholic (Matt. 28:19–20, Rev. 5:9–10, CCC 830–856) <br>  Jesus’ Church is called catholic ("universal" in Greek) because it is his gift to all people. He told his apostles to go throughout the world and make disciples of "all nations" (Matt. 28:19–20). <br>  <br>  For 2,000 years the Catholic Church has carried out this mission, preaching the good news that Christ died for all men and that he wants all of us to be members of his universal family (Gal. 3:28). <br>  <br>  Nowadays the Catholic Church is found in every country of the world and is still sending out missionaries to "make disciples of all nations" (Matt. 28:19).<br>  <br>  The Church Jesus established was known by its most common title, "the Catholic Church," at least as early as the year 107, when Ignatius of Antioch used that title to describe the one Church Jesus founded. The title apparently was old in Ignatius’s time, which means it probably went all the way back to the time of the apostles. <br>  <br>  The Church Is Apostolic (Eph. 2:19–20, CCC 857–865) <br>  The Church Jesus founded is apostolic because he appointed the apostles to be the first leaders of the Church, and their successors were to be its future leaders. The apostles were the first bishops, and, since the first century, there has been an unbroken line of Catholic bishops faithfully handing on what the apostles taught the first Christians in Scripture and oral Tradition (2 Tim. 2:2). <br>  <br>  These beliefs include the bodily Resurrection of Jesus, the Real Presence of Jesus in the Eucharist, the sacrificial nature of the Mass, the forgiveness of sins through a priest, baptismal regeneration, the existence of purgatory, Mary’s special role, and much more —even the doctrine of apostolic succession itself.<br>  <br>  Early Christian writings prove the first Christians were thoroughly Catholic in belief and practice and looked to the successors of the apostles as their leaders. What these first Christians believed is still believed by the Catholic Church. No other Church can make that claim. <br>  <br>  <br>  <<full of pagans>><br>  <br>  Given the Four Marks of the Church, obviously the Church is not conducive to attracting Pagans - unless they want to convert to Christianity!|`|XJHtNTXxaa	Like so many other questions 'round these parts, the answer to this question depends upon your definition, in this case, "catholic church."<br>  <br>  Dictionary.com defines "catholic" like this:<br>  1.  broad or wide-ranging in tastes, interests, or the like; having sympathies with all; broad-minded; liberal.<br>  2.  universal in extent; involving all; of interest to all.<br>  3.  pertaining to the whole Christian body or church.<br>  <br>  When I was attending a Lutheran church years ago we recited a creed which spoke of the "catholic church." I recall my dad telling me that "catholic" means "universal" and that's the meaning I take when I read a question like this.<br>  <br>  There is a "church," a group of people, who attend religious services say, on a weekly basis who have no desire to know God any further than they have taken Him. I would say these folks DO NOT belong to the "catholic, universal" church but only God knows their heart.<br>  <br>  Others have made a heart-commitment to their Savior and Creator. Those are the ones who, I would say, are part of the "catholic, universal" church.<br>  <br>  These souls can be found across the country, throughout the world being involved in various and sundry "denominations."

"Bring forth your strong reasons," says the King of Jacob.  22  "Let them bring forth and show us what will happen; Let them show the former things, what they were, That we may consider them, And know the latter end of them; Or declare to us things to come.  23  Show the things that are to come hereafter, That we may know that you are gods; Yes, do good or do evil, That we may be dismayed and see it together. <br>  <br>   Deuteronomy 32:29  Oh, that they were wise, that they understood this, That they would consider their latter end!  30  How could one chase a thousand, And two put ten thousand to flight, Unless their Rock had sold them, And the LORD had surrendered them?  31  For their rock is not like our Rock, Even our enemies themselves being judges.<br>  <br>  Acts 17:10  Then the brethren immediately sent Paul and Silas away by night to Berea.

When under trial, let no one say: “I am being tried by God.” For with evil things God cannot be tried nor does he himself try anyone. But each one is tried by being drawn out and enticed by his own desire. Then the desire, when it has become fertile, gives birth to sin; in turn, sin, when it has been accomplished, brings forth death. <br>  <br>  2 Peter 3: 8 - 10<br>  <br>  "However, let this one fact not be escaping YOUR notice, beloved ones, that one day is with GOD as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day. GOD is not slow respecting his promise, as some people consider slowness, but he is patient with YOU because he does not desire any to be destroyed but desires all to attain to repentance. Yet GOD'S day will come as a thief..."<br>  -------------------------<br>  <br>  Proverbs 3: 5 - 6:<br>  <br>  Trust in Jehovah with all your heart and do not lean upon your own understanding. In all your ways take notice of him, and he himself will make your paths straight..<br>  -------------------------<br>  <br>  We humans were not made to live independent of Jehovah God, and now we are imperfect because of Adam and Eve. Why would we look towards Satan or any other imperfect human to live our lives by, to look for perfection and intellect... There is no suspension of reason here but only if you choose to live outside of God's pure standards do you make serious errors in judgment.<br>  <br>  Those living and looking to imperfect men/humans and Satan for answers are doomed. Smart people look to what is good, what is from Jehovah God as a way of life. There is only one narrow path to salvation.<br>  <br>  Don't whine and fuss, but if you so choose to live your life not of Godly standards, guess what? That's your own choice.<br>  <br>  I choose to look to Jehovah God for answers; not the world for the world is currently lying in the power of the wicked one.|`|K2nbcyKSaa	To walk by faith and not by sight is very challenging. The New Testament speaks of receiving spiritual gifts and the earnest of your inheritance. These are living gifts to validate your small faith with the life of God. To get closer to Jesus and then have the Father reveal Himself to you is a spiritual rock. Remember the cornerstone Jesus loves you and in 1 Peter, the trial of your faith is more precious than gold tried in the fire. Mother Teresa teaches that Jesus wants to be loved and to love. The science of love, and receiving of lifesaving grace is a study that no one should neglect. Read the books of Peter in the New Testament please! In 1 Peter chapter 2, it speaks of making spiritual sacrifices remembering that God is a spirit. What if Jesus could be loved in our homes. Love between the husband, wife,and children with the Lord Jesus in the midst. Mother Teresa loved the poor and possibly, especially me to get closer to people in need.

But I think the Bible is the word of God.<br>  <br>  4) It's perfectly acceptable from my point of view to oppose religious doctrines, just not to ridicule them.<br>  <br>  5) I'm not a Catholic. And for people standing on street corners, I think they need to assess what they're trying to achieve from doing that.

I live in France, where there is a division of church and state, and it is probably easier for atheists to get elected than religious people.<br>  <br>  7) Is there anything wrong with worshipping the same gods as in the past? People in the past were equally intelligent as people today; they experienced the same range of emotions, of beliefs, of eternal conflicts, of prejudices of people today.

It governs many actions in today's politics, in history, and in our understanding of the world. It has played a complex and mixed role in world history.

I don't talk to her about my feelings though, why hurt her and make her feel guilty over "my" feelings. She's my kid no matter what and I want her happy.

WFkhQyGZaa	If you're looking for a definite answer, there are many international and national organisations that define youth with different ages. Youth is the period where a person is neither a child nor an adult. In many undeveloped countries, this concept of youth or adolescence is very short virtually non-existent since a person must assume the responsibilities of an adult very soon after childhood.<br>  <br>  In this country (the United States), most restaurants stop letting people order off of the children's menu at twelve, and people cease to be in the care of their parents (and therefore responsible for themselves) at the age of eighteen, I will say from twelve to seventeen, but I'm sure that in common parlance, some people might use the term to describe someone even in their late twenties as that time period is often considered to be the pinnacle of human physical fitness.|`|AA11717874	1-2 baby<br>  3-5 infant<br>  5-10 child<br>  11-12 pre-teen<br>  13-19 teen<br>  20 -25 young adult<br>  25-up adult<br>  <br>  13-25 is what i consider youth|`|AA11198190	l would say ....13-20<br>  Prior to 13 you are a child.<br>  When you turn 20...you are an adult.|`|HNRAJOAEaa	The ages from zero (0) to nineteen (19) years old is considered the class of youth because it's the tome of childhood and teenagehood.|`|Y16olPxlaa	0 - 4 child/baby/toddler<br>  5 - 17 Youth<br>  18 - up Adult|`|VJ2aG6znaa	Infant - 0-2<br>  Toddler - 2-4<br>  Child 4-16<br>  Youth -16 to 25's <br>  Adult 18+<br>  <br>  You can be a youth and an adult.|`|Gq1PVHHyaa	18 to 35

65QqZBnjaa	Sex is your physical body shape/form.  As the first poster indicated chromosomally this can be complicated.  XX doesn't always indicate female because their are MEN who are XX.  And XY doesn't always indicate male because there are millions of women who have Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome who were born XY.  THere are lots of other combinations (XXY, XXXY and so forth).<br>  <br>  <br>  Gender, or gender identity, is how you percieve yourself.  Contrary to what most people think gender identity is inborn and unchangeable.  We know this from tons of research on transsexual and intersex people:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://ai.eecs.umich.edu/people/conway/TS/TS.html#anchor107763" rel="nofollow">http://ai.eecs.umich.edu/people/conway/T...</a><br>  <br>  What's the significance of that?  Most people think gender is a social construct and that is mostly wrong.  Babies come into the world with their brains gendered as male or female.  Socialization only builds on that innate programming.<br>  <br>  That is why intersex children who were "corrected" as infants sometimes rebel because their parents thought they could choose a gender.  As I said gender identity is inborn.  It also explains why transsexual people feel the way they do.  During gestation their bodies got mixed signals as to how to form:  The brain went one way and the body the other.  That is why transsexual people transition to bring their body into alignment with their mind.<br>  <br>  <br>  Gender and sex are MUCH more complex than the average person believes.|`|SSGaDKlJaa	This is my personal views:<br>  Sex is a biological fact<br>  Gender is a social termanology<br>  <br>  Gender can transition, from one gender to another, but more importantly there are an infinate amount of genders as gender is self-identifying thing, you can consider yourself to be male, female or anything you consider yourself, there are no boundrys to gender in my view.<br>  <br>  SEx however is a bioloigcal fact relating to chromozones, and even then there is more than 2!!!!<br>  we all got taught there is XX & XY at school but there are more than that!<br>  <br>  all the following could be counted as a seperate sex<br>  XX/ XY/ XXX/ XYY/ XXY/ XXYY<br>  <br>  Im fed up of the medical comunnity saying that those whos chromozones dont match the xx xy format have "conditions"<br>  intersex people make up 1.7% of the population and if you do the maths thats a fair chunk, thats 119million people world wide!!!!<br>  of course most are the subject of IGM (intersex genitle mutilation) by doctors
e50e6ca9411acd39c8aec91e4abe2b89aa	An erection is a normal reaction to stimulation; men/women are stimulated when viewing a naked body they find sexually attractive or appealing.

98UY3WMpaa	I'm 19 and fairly new to organized nudism/naturism. This is something I don't understand. Nudists say they are tolerant and are very accepting of the human body, but EVERY nudist club or beach has etiquette saying men should have to cover up an erection. I think this is very unfair. While I've only been around a few nudist men, and none of them had an erection, I don't see the issue. As a woman, I could be sexually excited at a nudist club just as easy as a man except aside from hard nipples (which doesn't always mean we are excited) it's easy to hide. A woman could walk around with a swollen clitoris all day and no one would really notice. <br>  <br>  I don't think men should have to cover them up. Eventually they subside. I think some nudists are so obsessed with the non-sexualization of nudism that they take things to an extreme.|`|ybn6beqiaa	Honestly?

AA12016863	All people everywhere have psychic abilities, but most ignore it when they see strange things. Mostly because they believe people will think they're crazy. But your not crazy, and what you saw was probably real. Problem is that you are born with the gift, and like any other gift, what you don't use, you lose. But you can get it back, with will power, commitment, and training. buy one of those books that teach you how to improve your psychic abilities, decipher dreams, and determine the difference between a vision, spirits revealing themselves, hallucinations, and other clairvoyant phenomena, and then you'll know what to do next time you see something you couldn't previously explain.|`|ZkBLNj6Vaa	Sometimes the mind sees what it wants to see.<br>  <br>  Some people want to see psychic, others want to see mental illness.

I know that I've always had an extremely active imagination, and I'd be the first to admit that a lot of it is probably down to what you allow yourself to believe. As for the 'feelings' about things, I think everyone has the capacity to sense when their actions will result in something good/ bad. I just think some people are more open to trusting those instincts.<br>  Having said that, I do think some people are able to communicate with spirits, and I'm sure some do have genuine premonitions. I'm just not sure what you're describing is particularly unusual.

Unless one of the exceptions from 10 U.S.C. § 654(b) applies, the policy prohibits anyone who "demonstrate(s) a propensity or intent to engage in homosexual acts" from serving in the armed forces of the United States, because it "would create an unacceptable risk to the high standards of morale, good order and discipline, and unit cohesion that are the essence of military capability." The act prohibits any homosexual or bisexual person from disclosing his or her sexual orientation or from speaking about any homosexual relationships, including marriages or other familial attributes, while serving in the United States armed forces. The "don't ask" part of the policy indicates that superiors should not initiate investigation of a servicemember's orientation in the absence of disallowed behaviors, though mere suspicion of homosexual behavior can cause an investigation.

At his gate lay a poor man named Lazarus who was covered with sores.  As Lazarus lay there longing for scraps from the rich man’s table, the dogs would come and lick his open sores.<br>    Finally, the poor man died and was carried by the angels to be with Abraham. The rich man also died and was buried,  and his soul went to the place of the dead. There, in torment, he saw Abraham in the far distance with Lazarus at his side.<br>    The rich man shouted, ‘Father Abraham, have some pity! Send Lazarus over here to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue. I am in anguish in these flames.’<br>    But Abraham said to him, ‘Son, remember that during your lifetime you had everything you wanted, and Lazarus had nothing. So now he is here being comforted, and you are in anguish.  And besides, there is a great chasm separating us. No one can cross over to you from here, and no one can cross over to us from there.’<br>    Then the rich man said, ‘Please, Father Abraham, at least send him to my father’s home.  For I have five brothers, and I want him to warn them so they don’t end up in this place of torment. <br>   But Abraham said, ‘Moses and the prophets have warned them. Your brothers can read what they wrote.<br>    The rich man replied, ‘No, Father Abraham!

216d90e6aa749da6fe51585ee054ef87aa	Do introduce yourself to everyone in the room in the chat room. <br>  State your question clearly in the room, should that be your reason for arriving. Simply asking for help, saying you need help, or telling the room you have a question will not turn attention towards you. People are not mind readers, and they cannot help you unless you ask for it. Be specific in what you are looking for, and provide all relevant details to your question. <br>  <br>  Be civil to others. This is important in any situation, but even more so in a chat room, because only text is seen, and you can not see facial expressions or hear tones of voice<br>  . <br>  Give the room a chance to answer you. Patience is a virtue. <br>  <br>  Don't spam or flood the room with repeated questions, statements, or links. <br>  <br>  Avoid using colors. mIRC users will be able to see them, but the more hardcore irc users will see nothing but garbage. Often, IRC channels have a mode that will prevent your message from being displayed if it contains color codes. <br>  <br>  Avoid typing in all caps. It is hard on the eyes to read and considered rude. It is the Internet equivalent to shouting. If you want to call attention to a particular word or phrase, Do so in the same manner that you would in conversation. Just ask, and see who answers. <br>  Avoid using the phrase 'A/S/L' or its variations. ASL is the common greeting and asking for a persons age/sex/location. Considered rude and unneccessary in most chat rooms, often you will give the impression that you are either ignorant or have no real reason to be there. If you want to know something about a person, stick around a while and find out. People are more willing to reveal such personal details about themselves once they get to know you and feel more comfortable around you. You wouldn't instantly walk up to a person in a bar and ask them for their age, or where they live, so don't do it in chat. Or, read their profile. <br>  <br>  If you want to PM someone, that is chat privately, like in an IM, ask first. It is an invasion of privacy to assume that you can open an instant message window with someone you do not know. <br>  <br>  nfd?|`|And9dyrwaa	be calm and waiting for a nice person to chat.|`|dsqm0x9Waa	When you get in, don't imetietly jump into other peoples conversations.

I think of it as sharing, because stealing is taking something from somebody else. Piracy is making a copy of it, so there are two. A victimless crime. Sure, some people will argue you are stealing money off of some super-rich record company or something, but would you really be able to afford the CD if you were forced to buy it (or would you just go without)? Would you even have the opportunity to buy it? (Many copyright materials are very hard to get legitimate access to - they don't get sold in most local stores). The government should really do something about copyrights, so that they expire after a year or two, because the bureaucracy trying to comply with the copyright laws for material after this time is often too difficult.<br>  <br>  That being said, piracy is often illegal, and as Christians we are to obey the law where we are able. I would suggest you pray about it, and maybe take it up with a trusted Christian friend or pastor. Jesus loves you, and will certainly help you conquer the sin in your life. The most important thing is that you rely on Him as the complete sacrifice for your sin - we are not saved by our good works.|`|KVVD3B9vaa	I'm assuming that you mean video/DVD  piracy and not piracy on the high seas!<br>  <br>  Just look at it this way.

AA10676836	The Pontifex Maximus (which literally means "Greatest Pontiff") was the high priest of the Ancient Roman College of Pontiffs. This was the most important position in the Ancient Roman religion, open only to patricians until 254 BC, when a plebeian first occupied this post. A distinctly religious office under the early Roman Republic, it gradually became politicized until, beginning with Augustus, it was subsumed into the Imperial office. Its last use with reference to the emperors is in inscriptions of Gratian,[1] Emperor from 375 to 383, who, however, then decided to omit the words "pontifex maximus" from his title.[2][3]<br>  <br>  Peter was dead a long time when this church started. But lets not  let facts get in the way of a good story.
AA11440601	John 21:15-17 states: <br>  <br>  When they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, "Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these?" He said to him, "Yes, Lord, you know that I love you." He said to him, "Feed my lambs." <br>  <br>  He then said to him a second time, "Simon, son of John, do you love me?" He said to him, "Yes, Lord, you know that I love you." He said to him, "Tend my sheep." <br>  <br>  He said to him the third time, "Simon, son of John, do you love me?" Peter was distressed that he had said to him a third time, "Do you love me?" and he said to him, "Lord, you know everything; you know that I love you." (Jesus) said to him, "Feed my sheep. <br>  <br>  Matthew 16:17-19 states:<br>  <br>  Jesus said to him in reply, "Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah. For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my heavenly Father. And so I say to you, you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church, and the gates of the netherworld shall not prevail against it. I will give you the keys to the kingdom of heaven. Whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven." <br>  <br>  The Catholic Church believes the Lord made Simon alone, whom he named Peter, the "rock" of his Church. He gave him the keys of his Church and instituted him shepherd of the whole flock.<br>  <br>  The Pope is the senior pastor of 1.1 billion Catholic Christians, the direct successor of Simon Peter.<br>  <br>  The Pope’s main roles include teaching, sanctifying, and governing.<br>  <br>  The Emperor Constantine called the Council of Nicea together but did not enter into any of its decisions.<br>  <br>  For more information, see the Catechism of the Catholic Church, section 880-882: <a href="http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt1sect2chpt3art9p4.shtml#880" rel="nofollow">http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt1s...</a><br>  <br>  With love in Christ.|`|rV1uAtt3aa	There were conflicting gospels on who Jesus chose as his first pope; it was politically expedient to choose Peter and brand the disagreeing gospels as heretical.

The first was Linus who was appointed by Paul. <br>  <br>  The claim that Peter was the first was something that appeared hundreds of years later when the Roman Catholics first tried to implement their primacy over the other Churches, including those that pre-dated them such as Jerusalem, Antioch, Alexandria etc.|`|HrQDQvUUaa	"Pontifex Maximus" was a title given to the Roman Emperors, the actual title being "Summus Pontifex Maximus" (Supreme Builder of Bridges) a religious title originally given to the High Priest of the College of Pontiffs of Rome which title was later given to the Caesars starting with Augustus, making him and those after him both Emperor and supreme religious authority. <br>  <br>  <br>  The Roman Catholic Church says that Peter was the first Pope and that he was crucified in Rome after being tried and sentenced to death by Caesar. However it is almost certain that Peter was never in Rome, because;<br>  <br>  Peter was not a Roman citizen, therefore had no right to request trial before Caesar as did Paul. <br>  <br>  Paul or Luke would have written about Peter being there, if he had been in Rome.<br>  <br>  Sending Peter to Rome to be tried before Caesar would not have brought Caesar glory as would have a barbarian chieftain that Rome was fighting.

NO governor wanted to be recalled by Caesar for anything like that!<br>  <br>  Remember, Pontius Pilate executed Jesus for greater crimes than Peter would have been accused of, following the Roman tradition of handling things at the lowest possible level.

Price<br>  <br>  The organization of the Roman Catholic Church is a maze of complexity. Developed through centuries of apostasy, its arrangement is a behemoth of interlocking levels of ecclesiastical and political power. Papal authority oversees the moral and religious lives of one billion Catholics worldwide. Yet, the Bible speaks nothing of the Roman Catholic Church and its vast organization. It is a departure from the faith (1 Tim. 4:1-3).<br>  <br>  The organization of the New Testament church is a model of simplicity. The church of Christ is composed of Christians, not churches (Acts 4:27; Eph. 1:22-23; Heb. 12:23). Independent congregations accomplish their God-given work without universal arrangement and oversight (Acts 14:23; 20:28; 1 Pet. 5:2).<br>  <br>  The complexity of Catholicism and the simplicity of the New Testament church are seen by observing the organizational structure of the Roman Catholic Church.(1)<br>  <br>  1) The Hierarchy. Hierarchy means sacred rule, and the term has been used since the sixth century to “denote the totality of ruling powers in the Church.”(2) This hierarchal power exists “for the guiding of man to his eternal salvation.”(3) The hierarchy of order administers matters relating to public worship and the sacramental services while the hierarchy of jurisdiction formulates and administers the laws of the Catholic Church.(4) Catholic hierarchy is not in the Scriptures. Following the New Testament pattern, Christians organize themselves into local congregations that function under the oversight of elders (bishops, pastors) and are served by deacons (Acts 14:23; Phil. 1:1; 1 Tim. 3:1-13; 1 Pet. 5:1-4). Each member has a place of value, purpose and service in the local church (Eph. 4:11-16; 1 Cor. 12:12-27).<br>  <br>  2) The Pope. The pope (“papa”) is considered the Vicar (agent) of Christ, holding “supreme headship of the Church on earth.”(5) The pope is viewed as the “Holy Father,” the Roman Pontiff and the successor of Peter (whom Catholics say was the first pope). In contrast, the Bible teaches Christ, not a man, is the head of his church (Col. 1:18; Matt. 28:18; 23:9). The Roman papacy usurps and rebels against the authority of Christ.<br>  <br>  3) The Cardinals. A cardinal is “a dignitary of the Roman Church and counsellor (sic) of the pope.” It is “the usual designation of every priest belonging to a central or episcopal church.”(6) Cardinals are the administrators of the Catholic hierarchy. The New Testament church has no central church and thus, no place or need for Cardinals to administer it.<br>  <br>  4) The Roman Curia. This is the governing administration of the Catholic hierarchy: “Strictly speaking, the ensemble of departments or ministries which assist the sovereign pontiff in the government of the Universal Church. These are the Roman Congregations, the tribunals, and the offices of Curia.”(7) The Curia is composed of committees of cardinals called congregations; for example, the Congregation of the Sacred Consistory, the Congregation of the Inquisition, the Congregation of the Holy Office and the Congregation of the Sacraments. Thus, the Catholic Church is a Church composed of Churches. The New Testament church is composed of Christians, not churches. Christians compose local churches (Acts 2:47; Heb. 12:23; Eph. 2:16-22; 1 Cor. 1:2).<br>  <br>  5) The Roman Tribunals. These are the judicial instruments of the Catholic Church, judging crimes and violations of Church law. New Testament churches (congregations) did not organize tribunals to judge right and wrong. Under the oversight of its own elders, each church is expected to judge righteous judgment concerning sin and error in its midst (1 Cor. 5:1-5; Rom. 16:17; Titus 3:10-11).<br>  <br>  6) Apostolic Legates. The Pope is also considered the Head of State who rules over the Roman Catholic Church’s government. As such he sends representatives to governments around the world. These ambassadors represent the interests of the Catholic Church among the nations. No such legates are found in the New Testament church, for Christ’s kingdom is not of this world (Jno. 18:36).<br>  <br>  7) The Councils. These are assemblies of bishops arranged into three types: General council (these are called by the pope and composed of all Catholic bishops in the world. Its actions on doctrine and discipline must be approved by the pope.); Plenary or National Council (bishops in a country, its actions must be approved by the pope.); and Diocesan or Provincial Council (composed of bishops in a province, it applies the decrees passed on by the other councils). New Testament churches are lead by their own shepherds (bishops, elders), not by provincial, national or general councils (Acts 28:20; 1 Pet. 5:2).<br>  <br>  8) The Episcopacy. In the hierarchy of Catholicism, this is the governance of churches by bishops and archbishops. Catholicism is structured with a plurality of churches under one bishop. In the New Testament the opposite is true: one church is under

AA11440601	"The dogma of the Catholic Church" does not agree with evolution.<br>  <br>  The Catholic Church states that the theory of evolution is the most logical scientific explanation at this time. However tomorrow someone may come up with better ideas.<br>  <br>  Most Christians do not take the stories of creation in the Bible literally. Catholics believe the book of Genesis tells religious truth and not necessarily historical fact. <br>  <br>  One of the religious truths is that God created everything and declared all was good.<br>  <br>  Catholics can believe in the theories of the big bang or evolution or both or neither. <br>  <br>  On August 12, 1950 Pope Pius XII said in his encyclical Humani generis: <br>  <br>  The Teaching Authority of the Church does not forbid that, in conformity with the present state of human sciences and sacred theology, research and discussions, on the part of men experienced in both fields, take place with regard to the doctrine of evolution, in as far as it inquires into the origin of the human body as coming from pre-existent and living matter - for the Catholic faith obliges us to hold that souls are immediately created by God. <br>  <br>  Here is the complete encyclical: <a href="http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_12081950_humani-generis_en.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_x...</a><br>  <br>  And here is the Address of Pope John Paul II to the Pontifical Academy of Sciences on October 22, 1996 speaking of the Theory of Evolution: <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/library/docs_jp02tc.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.newadvent.org/library/docs_jp...</a><br>  <br>  Here is an interesting article about Pope John Paul II's opinion in the matter: <a href="http://www.americamagazine.org/content/article.cfm?article_id=4627" rel="nofollow">http://www.americamagazine.org/content/a...</a><br>  <br>  The Church supports science in the discovery of God's creation. At this time, the theories of the big bang and evolution are the most logical scientific explanations. However tomorrow someone may come up with better ideas.<br>  <br>  As long as we believe that God started the whole thing, both the Bible and responsible modern science can live in harmony.<br>  <br>  The Clergy Letter Project an open letter endorsing the Theory of Evolution signed by over 10,000 clergy from many different Christian denominations: <a href="http://www.butler.edu/clergyproject/rel_evol_sun.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.butler.edu/clergyproject/rel_...</a><br>  <br>  With love in Christ.|`|yQNit56Qaa	1) Fundamentalists, the dogma of the Catholic Church agrees with evolution<br>  <br>  It is more accurate to say that the doctrines of the Roman Catholic Church do not contradict the *general* theory of species evolution.  Their doctrines, however, do not "agree" with the theory of species evolution any more than a Harry Potter book does.<br>  <br>  <br>  2) is this going to cost them their souls?<br>  <br>  Of course not.  There is nothing in the bible that says, "Unless you believe that the theory of species evolution is a crock, you are damned to Hell."<br>  <br>  <br>  3) Is this belief lethal to their spiritual health or just more like a head cold?<br>  <br>  Neither.  It's more like the state of Massachusetts making possession of Marijuana a misdemeanor.  There's no law in Massachusetts that says you have to go out and buy marijuana.  There's no Roman Catholic doctrine that says that the theory of species evolution is valid - only that it does not contradict Roman Catholic doctrines.  Whether or not an individual Roman Catholic chooses to believe it is entirely up to them.<br>  <br>  Jim, <a href="http://www.bible-reviews.com/selector_rc.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bible-reviews.com/selector_rc...</a>|`|ridu0Rtwaa	The Pope, Catholic Church, Church of England and mainstream churches all accept evolution and the big bang!!<br>  <br>  Lord Carey the former Archbishop of Canterbury put it rather well – “Creationism is the fruit of a fundamentalist approach to scripture, ignoring scholarship and critical learning, and confusing different understandings of truth”!! <br>  <br>  Christian Fundamentalist is a complete contradiction in terms!!<br>  <br>  CHRISTIAN – A follower or believer in Jesus.<br>  <br>  FUNDAMENTALIST One who believes the Bible is literally true and must be followed exactly.<br>  <br>  Therefore they are followers of the bible and not Jesus making them non Christians!!!<br>  <br>  But worse is to follow it also makes them ideologists.<br>  <br>  IDEOLOGY An idea that is false or held for the wrong reasons but is believed with such conviction as to be irrefutable.<br>  <br>  So Christians have a loving and forgiving god and fundamentalist - well - Just are not Christians!!!!<br>  <br>  So the fundies are now becoming the laughingstock for christians, atheists and all the other religions!!|`|tqQIcLb5aa	The Dogma of the Catholic Church does NOT agree with evolution. It does not rule on science. It merely states that someone who believes in evolution can be Catholic too. It merely says that the theory of evolution does not contradict the teachings of Christ. Many in the Catholic Church do encourage other lines of thought and some in the Catholic Church are creationists.<br>  <br>  I believe evolution sounds like a pretty good explanation. However after 3 years at university studying science I'm still a little unimpressed by the lack of evidence evolutionists are at liberty to base their theories on.<br>  <br>  Have a read of this:<br>  <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05655a.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05655a.h...</a>|`|AQBow7Glaa	According to fundamentalist Protestants, the Catholics are already going to Hell because they don't believe in the 'simple plan of salvation' or the primacy of the Bible.  Plus they pray to idols and ask a human (priest) to forgive their sins.<br>  <br>  So accepting evolution won't make any difference.

Moreover, those who make the same claim with regard to Allaah (should know that) this is kufr, deviation and misguidance.<br>  <br>   This belief implies that Allaah is present even in dirty places like bathrooms etc. – Glorified be Allaah far above what they say. <br>  _________________________________<br>  <br>   Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) died as decreed by Allaah and as Allaah said (interpretation of the meaning):<br>  <br>  “Verily you (O Muhammad) will die and verily, they (too) will die” [al-Zumar 39:30]  <br>  <br>  According to a saheeh hadeeth, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:<br>  <br>   “Allaah has angels who travel about in the earth and convey to me the salaams of my ummah.” <br>  <br>  And he (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: <br>  <br>  “There is no one who sends salaams upon me but Allaah will restore my soul to me so that I may return his salaam.” <br>  <br>  And he (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: <br>  <br>  “The best of your days is Friday, so send more blessings (salaah) upon me on that day, for your blessings will be shown to me.” They said, “O Messenger of Allaah, how will they be shown to you when you (your body) have disintegrated?” <br>  <br>  He said, ‘Allaah has forbidden the earth to consume the bodies of the Prophets.”  <br>  __________________________________

Mohammad is a false prophet because Islam does not accept that Jesus is the son of God.  Islam teaches that Jesus was only a great prophet and not the Son of God, but Jesus must be the son of God, here is the reasoning:<br>  <br>  1) either Jesus is who he says he is, the Son of God, and Islam is wrong.<br>  or<br>  2) Jesus was a raving lunatic. For no great prophet of God would also blaspheme God by declaring himself the Son of God.  Jesus cannot be a great prophet and a great liar at the same time!!!<br>  <br>  We KNOW Mohammad is a false prophet because he denies Jesus is the son of God, here is the test:<br>  1 John 4:1-3<br>  1Dear friends, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world. 2This is how you can recognize the Spirit of God: Every spirit that acknowledges that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God, 3but every spirit that does not acknowledge Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you have heard is coming and even now is already in the world. <br>  <br>  2 Corinthians 11:13-15<br>  13For such men are false apostles, deceitful workmen, masquerading as apostles of Christ. 14And no wonder, for Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light. 15It is not surprising, then, if his servants masquerade as servants of righteousness. Their end will be what their actions deserve.<br>  <br>  <br>  Jesus himself declared before multiple witnesses that he is the son of God (Jesus cannot be a great prophet if he also blasphemes God):<br>  <br>  Matthew 26:63-64 <br>   63But Jesus remained silent. The high priest said to him, "I charge you under oath by the living God: Tell us if you are the Christ,[a] the Son of God." 64"Yes, it is as you say," Jesus replied. "But I say to all of you: In the future you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven."<br>  <br>  Mark 14:61-62 <br>  61But Jesus remained silent and gave no answer. Again the high priest asked him, "Are you the Christ,[a] the Son of the Blessed One?" 62"I am," said Jesus. "And you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven."<br>  <br>  Luke 22:70<br>  70They all asked, "Are you then the Son of God?"  He replied, "You are right in saying I am."<br>  <br>  John 4:25-26<br>  The woman said, "I know that Messiah" (called Christ) "is coming. When he comes, he will explain everything to us." Then Jesus declared, "I who speak to you am he."<br>  John 10:25-30 <br>  25Jesus answered, "I did tell you, but you do not believe. The miracles I do in my Father's name speak for me, 26but you do not believe because you are not my sheep. 27My sheep listen to my voice; I know them, and they follow me. 28I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one can snatch them out of my hand. 29My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all[d]; no one can snatch them out of my Father's hand. 30I and the Father are one." <br>  <br>  John 17:1-5 <br>  After Jesus said this, he looked toward heaven and prayed: "Father, the time has come. Glorify your Son, that your Son may glorify you. For you granted him authority over all people that he might give eternal life to all those you have given him. Now this is eternal life: that they may know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent. I have brought you glory on earth by completing the work you gave me to do.

b6b30e5dbaa0c133dc8bee37f4337866aa	That is a tough one.  I think your essay will depend on the context.  <br>  <br>  Christianity includes so many different groups, many of which would have vastly different outlooks on the role of women in Christianity.  For example, the role of women in the Catholic Church will be different from the LDS, and both will be different from the Methodists or Episcopalians.  If you are writing this essay in the context of one particular denomination, you should look at the teachings of that denomination for guidance.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, if you are writing this as a reflection of your own opinion, ask yourself what YOU believe.  To me, this theme seems reflective of the rights of women in general.  People who think that women are equal citizens in every way will usually think the same thing about their place in religion, whereas people who think that woman are not suited for certain tasks (leadership, military, mentoring) will generally see them as support figures in a religious sense.|`|iAXmdQOEaa	Great question!

Prayer to God is like a child's conversation with his father. It is natural for a child to ask his father for the things he needs.<br>  <br>  There are many promises in God's Word to encourage us to pray, such as: "He shall call upon me and I will answer him: I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him, and honor him" (Psalm 91:15); "And it shall come to pass that before they call, I will answer; and while they are yet speaking, I will hear" (Isaiah 65:24); "Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you" (Matthew 7:7). The Scriptures tell us that we are to pray for one another and also assure us that God hears and answers prayer. <br>  <br>  When you receive Christ into your heart, you become a child of God and have the privilege of talking to Him in prayer at any time about anything. The Christian life is a personal relationship to God through Jesus Christ. And best of all, it is a relationship that will last for all eternity.|`|BMQlzUkfaa	If you want to communicate with God you will have to do it in the way that he communicates.

BAlntsndaa	There are many reasons people are homeless. The changes in the US welfare system in the 90's kicked a lot of people to the curb that don't even show in statistics because they don't qualify - like how the Unemployment Rate only counts people getting unemployment checks. It's about finding a job within your interests/skills, being able to keep it and having the support to carry you through. Not everyone has family or friends able to help them out. Certainly alcohol, health and other issues can contribute to joblessness and eventual homeless situations, but there are well trained and educated people forced to live on the streets for a variety of reasons. And once pushed further and farther down, it becomes so much harder to get back up.|`|poeWy4YCaa	I agree. A person can learn a job but what about the job politics that happen in the workplace.

96AQZUGyaa	I think it is just a natural evolution of words. Gay used to exclusively mean things like colourful, merry, happy.

I know when/if I say something is gay in that sense I'm not making a comparison between homosexuals and the thing I speak of.|`|EYqTV2EYaa	It's because people in the first generation didn't like homosexuals, so they referred to things they didn't like as 'gay.'

oK5jf106aa	I don't watch the Tudors but historically that would not fly. Henry didn't even allow talk of Anne after she was beheaded, and considered Jane Seymour his true wife that he loved best. Jane died after childbirth - to a male heir, Edward. A portrait of the royal family included her posthumously (despite his latter three marriages after Jane's death).<br>  <br>  It was not until after Henry's death, and upon Elizabeth I's coronation, that Anne was again part of the history.|`|sFaLyG0Naa	<a href="http://allforyou.amstrad.at" rel="nofollow">http://allforyou.amstrad.at</a><br>  A very informative website you can also get much information in website|`|02bNMUxoaa	i hope so i do not like the new jane she gets on my nerves faking sweet and innocent i wonder if she was really like that because if i were like that and i know 99 percent of other women are too it would be because i was with a king remember the real king was fat and obnoxious not cute like this one <br>  i mean did she really love him or did she just want to be queen<br>  at least anne was honest about it
oK5jf106aa	Historically - she didn't bear him a son. She had Elizabeth, and miscarried a son later. She became a bit of a shrew - I think she was jealous that what she had pulled on Katherine of Aragon would happen to her - and the king was a product of his time, and wives were expected to obey. Her looks also faded, and Henry fell as hard for Jane Seymour as he had for Anne. Additionally, Anne was also very flirtacious and once accused of adultery (though it's unlikely that she committed adultery; there was a conspiracy against her there), that was it for her.<br>  <br>  If she had given Henry a son, I think things would have turned around.|`|tUOUy2Ewaa	because her 1st son was born stillborn and he got cross that the split with the catholic church may have been for nothing|`|NYU37jfGaa	Well, the birth of Elizabeth was a disappointment, but not a disaster.  Anne had proved she was fertile, and could bear a healthy child, and there was no reason to suppose a son would not follow.  However, when she conceived for the second time, and suffered a miscarriage, it seems to have been the beginning of Henry's disillusionment with Anne.  It appears that sometime after her miscarriage, Henry was involved in amorous dalliance with a lady-in-waiting, which made the Queen very angry.  She felt her position to be insecure, since she had not given Henry a son, and she became angry and made scenes about his flirtations.  <br>  <br>  However, it seems that towards the end of 1535, they were getting on well again, and Anne was once more pregnant.   But she had a miscarriage in January 1536, and it was a son she miscarried.  Henry began to wonder if God was against him once more, denying him a son.  Another major factor in the fall of Anne Boleyn was that Cromwell turned against her.  It seems to have been easy to convince Henry that Anne was an adulteress, perhaps because he was tired of her and attracted by Jane Seymour, he may have decided that God was not going to let him have a son with Anne, and he may have been worried that he was getting old and wouldn't have many more chances.|`|kA5H9uqqaa	Failure to produce a male heir - thats it in an nutshell

Anything short of that,no.|`|60a3bbdca78e74fb19db426e27b9a087aa	You can add her name to yours (without hyphenating). If your name is Jane Lilly Doe and wife to be is Mary Dear you can make your name Jane Lilly Doe Dear.    Best of both worlds. That way legally you still keep your name but have hers too. And in the average setting where you use only first and last you would be Jane Dear. My sister, who has no middle name, officially changed her name so that her maiden name became her middle name and she took the last name of her spouse.    Congrats on your wedding and hallelujah for MA!!|`|alAtUXvyaa	i would, when i get married i am TOTALLY taking his name. but if you really like your last name, you could do like one of my teachers did and make your maiden name be your middle name and take your fiancees last name as yours...or you could always hyphenate like my mom did  = ] ....... congrats!!|`|Sm9cq8KKaa	I would never ever change my last name, but that's just me being the stubborn person I am.

Your last name can be a big part of you, and the biggest question you need to ask yourself is if it is okay with you to give up your current last name and take hers. I decided very young that I was going to keep my own last name, no matter who I married, because it is just so much a aprt of who I am. Changing your last name is a great choice if you are searching for a clean start with your new life. There is always the option of using both last names, also, which I think may be the best for someone in your place right now. I know that this is not a very direct answer, but I hope it helped. Just ask yourself what your intentions are on starting this new relationship--do want a clean start, or is your heritage too important to you?|`|WSUfk9Rxaa	i think the question is are you going to hyphenate the last name or take the entire one.  If you were an heterosexual couple this would be the question so why is it so difficult for you.  We wanted the rights now we have them so use them!!!!! The professional crap you gave about her not changing her name.  My question is what is that about.  i'm a very professional women in a very prestigious company with mostly men but i would never take away from me and mine for the sake of saving face for someone else.|`|DoooQw77aa	Well, I think that if you like your fiance's last name better than yours, then you should take it! Unless you are really emotionally connected to your last name in some way; then you can think about doing a 'double last name'. For example like "Smith-Thompson" or whatever.|`|nsZuZ1O9aa	if you like her name better then yes. you should do it.|`|SCVGcAyAaa	i think yu should hyphen it|`|20d09b00f62ad79a5e4a77484ecead92aa	I could never change my last name, nor could I ask my partner to change hers should marriage become legal here in NC.  My daughter's last name is the same as her father's, which is also my married name.  Now that I'm divorced from her father, I am keeping that last name, ONLY because my daughter has the same last name.  I wouldn't change my name if I were straight and going to marry another man.  Now when my daughter is out of college, I may change it back to my maiden name.  I just don't want kids to say anything to her about my last name being different from hers.  I don't think getting married is a reason to change your last name unless you want to.  It's a personal decision, based on how comfortable you and your partner are with it.  The best to you both!!!!|`|p3juprpzaa	asif we know what the names are or anything  jus keep your own  it wont last anyway|`|3TdT5mG2aa	If I had a choice, I would hyphenate the last name.

However, both sides have their own pros and cons.|`|rmwivveRaa	personally i'd go for it. if the girl i love asked me to marry her and take her  last name i'd say yes in an instant. it's all personal preference really, although i think you should    good luck getting married! :)|`|8ZUVToXgaa	I would keep my last name. I like it too much. It rings together with my first.|`|QYy0vU4maa	I say either take her name or hyphen it. It is really up to the two of you. I believe taking your partners name is a good thing and shows in a way how committed you are. But not every couple chooses to do so. Just talk with your partner about it and im sure the two of you can come up with a solution.|`|0rpS2b97aa	use a hyphen.
vf9g9bExaa	Hermes is the son of Maia (a daughter of the titan Atlas) and Zeus.

But it all works out eventually :)|`|vrVVQgqwaa	no but my first husband was and he left me for another man and then decided he wanted me and him also but i said no and got him the crap out of my life, he still dates men and women, the women breaks up with him after they find out about the guys,|`|FHLKpNv4aa	Eh.When i first came out i was bi,but i also knew really that i was only attracted to girls,it just helped me ease into it i guess.|`|2DahzSWvaa	I was in denial, but I never labeled myself during that time.|`|n8xr5dg7aa	mm no not really. i have questionned of course. it's good to try to find out your preferences.|`|edb8091d08e70995c94b8aaf70084a4eaa	yes and then i realized I love what a man has in his underwear. its so warm.|`|AA12088442	no im straight|`|aaCK25mGaa	nope.. i dont have to worry much there bc i am straight :D|`|Fac7qW8haa	Yeah.

ulwXFrrJaa	yes    gnorance more frequently begets confidence than knowledge.  It is those that know little, and not those that know much, who so positively assert that this or that problem will never be solved by science.    ~Charles Darwin    Question with boldness even the existence of god; because if there be one, he must approve of the homage of reason more than that of blindfolded fear.    ~Thomas Jefferson    I never submitted the whole system of my opinions to the creed of any party of men whatever in religion, in philosophy, in politics, or in anything else where I was capable of thinking for myself.  Such an addiction is the last degradation of a free and moral agent.    ~Thomas Jefferson    And the day will come when the mystical generation of Jesus, by the supreme being as his father in the womb of a virgin will be classed with the fable of the generation of Minerve in the brain of Jupiter. But may we hope that the dawn of reason and freedom of thought in these United States will do away with this artificial scaffolding, and restore to us the primitive and genuine doctrines of this most venerated reformer of human errors.  ~Thomas Jefferson    Religion is the opiate of the masses  ~Karl Marx    When the Nazis arrested the Communists,  I said nothing; after all, I was not a Communist.  When they locked up the Social Democrats,  I said nothing; after all, I was not a Social Democrat.  When they arrested the trade unionists,  I said nothing; after all, I was not a trade unionist.  When they arrested the Jews, I said nothing; after all, I was not a Jew.  When they arrested me, there was no longer anyone who could protest.  ~Martin Niem?ller    Properly read, the Bible is the most potent force for atheism ever conceived.  ~Isaac Asimov    Imagine the people who believe such things and who are not ashamed to ignore, totally, all the patient findings of thinking minds through all the centuries since the Bible was written. And it is these ignorant people, the most uneducated, the most unimaginative, the most unthinking among us, who would make themselves the guides and leaders of us all; who would force their feeble and childish beliefs on us; who would invade our schools and libraries and homes. I personally resent it bitterly.  ~Isaac Asimov    No man who ever lived knows any more about the hereafter ... than you and I; and all religion ... is simply evolved out of chicanery, fear, greed, imagination and poetry.  ~Edgar Allen Poe    If you want to save your child from polio, you can pray or you can inoculate.  ~Carl Sagan    In science it often happens that scientists say, "You know that's a really good argument; my position is mistaken," and then they would actually change their minds and you never hear that old view from them again. They really do it. It doesn't happen as often as it should, because scientists are human and change is sometimes painful. But it happens every day. I cannot recall the last time something like that happened in politics or religion.  ~Carl Sagan    You can't convince a believer of anything; for their belief is not based on evidence, it's based on a deep seated need to believe.   ~Carl Sagan    To sin by silence when they should protest makes cowards of men.  ~Abe Lincoln    "Men never do evil so completely and cheerfully than when they do it from religious conviction."     ~ Blaise Pascal    "The church lives on the fact that modern research about Jesus is not known amongst the public." - Hans Konzelmann    "One of the most frightening things in the Western world, and in this country in particular, is the number of people who believe in things that are scientifically false. If someone tells me that the earth is less than 10,000 years old, in my opinion he should see a psychiatrist." - Francis Crick  "Walk with those seeking Truth. Run from those who think they've found it." - Deepak Chopra    "Dear Lord, the gods have been good to me. As an offering, I present these milk and cookies. If you wish me to eat them instead, please give me no sign whatsoever.  (...short pause...)  Thy bidding will be done. {(Munch munch munch.)}" - Homer Simpson  "Religion is an insult to human dignity.  With or without it, you'd have good people doing good things and evil people doing bad things, but for good people to do bad things, it takes religion." Steven Weinberg - Nobel Laureate  "I have examined all of the known superstitions of the world and I do not find in our superstitions of Christianity one redeeming feature. They are all founded on fables and mythology. Christianity has made one half the world fools and the other half hypocrites." - Thomas Jefferson (1743-1826)  "Anyone who has two shirts when someone has none is not a christian." - Lenny Bruce    If you believe in the existence of fairies at the bottom of the garden you are deemed fit for the bin. If you believe in parthenogenesis, ascension, transubstantiation and all the rest of it you are deemed fit to govern the country."   ~ Jonathan Meades    One man's religion is another mans' belly laugh."   ~ Isaac Asimov    "Writing science fiction for about a penny a word is no way to make a living, If you really want to make a million, the quickest way is to start your own religion."   ~ L. Ron Hubbard    "I read about an Eskimo hunter who asked the local missionary priest, 'If I did not know about God and sin, would I go to hell?' 'No,' said the priest, 'not if you did not know.' 'Then why,' asked the Eskimo earnestly, 'did you tell me?' "  ~Annie Dillard, Pilgrim at Tinker Creek, 1974    "... I am convinced that I am acting as the agent of our Creator. By fighting off the Jews, I am doing the Lord's work." ~ Hitler  |`|N8Im0nQLaa	It would also have to be irrelevant to the question at hand and end with a hokey canned prayer.|`|AA12346187	he would not want to  so why would  he even try.|`|AA11282654	No. He baught his computer in 1965.|`|AA11124121	Dudette, where's my car?|`|31e0283ff8bc957ec9168709f61d5bf0aa	Are you married? or do you have a boyfriend? does his word "I love you" repeatedly everyday or every moment of your being together is getting to your nerves and you want it stopped?

Sx6vlEUbaa	I am not "born again" yet. I will be at the resurrection. <br>  <br>  Jesus made it clear. Flesh and blood cannot inherit the Kingdom of God. I am still flesh and Blood. I have not put on my eternal Spiritual body yet. <br>  <br>  At this time I have only been begotten by God's Spirit. My birth is when I am resurrected. That is when I will be born again as an eternal Spirit being..<br>  <br>  I know this is completely different than what traditional Christianity teaches but I know it is the truth.|`|WjRqYf6naa	Act 16:31  And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.<br>  <br>  Water baptism is a sign of regeneration, not a requirement for it.|`|6Whz1p5Eaa	No:<br>  <br>  "19 You believe that God is one; you do well.

It is not hard all you do is pray for Him to forgive you, tell him that you believe He died for you and paid the price for your sins. If you don't believe that you can still ask Jesus to give you the faith to believe. He is looking at the willing heart not our lips. To repent means to turn to Christ away from rejecting Him. As you grow in your Christian faith sin will be less appealing to you. If we had to wait until we were sinless to come to Christ then no one would be saved. Christ continually washes our sins from us, past, present and future.|`|AA11856921	When Jesus walked the earth as a man before His execution He was called the ONLY BEGOTTEN.<br>  <br>  Joh 1:14  And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only BEGOTTEN of the Father,) full of grace and truth. <br>  Joh 1:18  No man hath seen God at any time; the only BEGOTTEN Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him. <br>  Joh 3:16  For God so loved the world, that he gave his only BEGOTTEN Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. <br>  <br>  After His resurrection He's called the FIRSTBORN.<br>  <br>  Rom 8:29  For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the FIRSTBORN among many BRETHREN. (Brothers) <br>  Col 1:18  And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the FIRSTBORN FROM THE DEAD; that in all things he might have the preeminence. <br>  <br>  The short, quick answer is that I have to die and be resurrected after having been baptized by one of God's true ministers. The explanation of the Bible on this point is very involved and only those that truly want to know will follow the reasoning.<br>  <br>  We can't be "born again" as physical beings!<br>  Joh 3:6  That which is born of the flesh IS flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit IS spirit.<br>  Jesus is clearly saying here that we have to be spirit beings to be in the Knigdom of God. He has been!<br>  <br>  So then the question is how do we become conceived as a spirit fetus? The answer to this question shows why Satan HAS to deceive the world with the false doctrine of the trinity! The answer lies in the meaning of the word "spirit".<br>  <br>  Job 32:8  But there is a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding. <br>  The word "understanding" in this verse shows that "spirit" is an energy of "mind". The "Holy Spirit" is Gods energy of mind - NOT a third person.<br>  <br>  Act 2:38  Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. <br>  <br>  God's mind, joined with our mind to give is complete understanding.<br>  Rom 8:16  The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God: <br>  So, His mind shows our mind that we are His children. It feels like our own thought. It IS happening in our mind. God's mind is giving our mind understanding.<br>  <br>  This spirit is more than that though. It is, for lack of a better term, the sperm that is now producing the fetus of a future spirit being.<br>  We have already seen how Jesus was explaining that we have to be changed from pfysical to be in the Kingdom. Looking elsewhere in God's word for "change" we find:<br>  <br>  Job 14:14  If a man die, shall he live again? all the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my CHANGE come. <br>  Job 14:15  Thou shalt call, and I will answer thee: thou wilt have a desire to the work of thine hands. <br>  1Co 15:51  Behold, I show you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be CHANGED, <br>  1Co 15:52  In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be CHANGED.<br>  More evidence:<br>  We will be GODS.

Reborn is the word and choice your looking for. Jesus said you must be reborn and become a new person. When you take a crack baby off the street and a loving family adopts it. The life (or death) that it would've had is no longer applicable. Instead, it will enjoy a wonderful, happy life with their adoptive family. The baby will grow up to think, act and react very differently than if they had not been adopted. Same rule applies to all of us. It may take some time, but eventually the ways of thinking and acting leave us and His ways become ours. In a nutshell, Your heart and mind must become like His. Filled with love and wisdom.|`|hObp9GPPaa	no just because you believe in something doesn't make you born again. Im guessing the Gospel being the Bible there's only one way to be born again and that is to believe upon Jesus, we shall repent manny times but each times not being reborn either, I really stay clear of the term born again tho. you cant be a Christian before becoming a born again either you are one or not Christ payed the price for all of us.

c9a60fdb57c6d0b3e097f61fc57c9d3daa	I was in Italy visiting someone who was Iranian.  His friends were too.  Well, the first night that I was there the friends all came over.  One of the Iranian guys was dating a Italian girl.  Well, me and that girl and my "friend" were talking about passports and visas and all of the sudden they started talking to each other and switched to Italian.  Now, I'm not normally a nasty person and cussing out people is never really something I do but nobody in that room was speaking English and it was really rude and the more I thought about it the more pissed I got.  Needless to say he got the ugly side of Shrunken Fro a lot of times when I stayed there and I was there for a month.|`|iLFYj6Qgaa	No, I don't see this as rude. I live in a multicultural city (Brussels) and you hear all kinds of languages here. Where I work, we use Dutch, French and English, and we switch from one language to another all the time, depending on who we are talking to. Same thing in the family. We consider it as normal.|`|0835d5aaaff88c49c30c004c7854c920aa	Why do people post this question every day? Answer - it depends on the situation. It's kind of like "is it rude to drink a Coke in front of somebody?" I guess it could be, depends on the situation.|`|gvx9Jiteaa	We can very easily read their body language even we do not understand their conversation in other language which are not known to us.|`|Mq9GSSHhaa	It isn't rude unless they are speaking to some one who doesn't speak their language.

It would be rude however, if you knew Japanese and you were speaking English to some one in Japan who did not know English. So, no. I don't believe it to be rude.|`|vTzeB854aa	I think it is really normal because in my country most of us knows a few languages, so when we couldn't find the right words we'll just switch to another language without even thinking about it..

G4vFjh0yaa	I feel that he made a bad choice. He has said that.  He is not a child and has the right to make mistakes and to learn from them.  As far as others children go this is an opportunity to open that dialogue and discuss why it was a bad decision and why it may cost him.  When these people, any sports figure is placed on this pedestal and we as parents say to them, see what you can do with hard work and dedication we need to accept the responsibility to continue to guide them.  He is a human being and will make mistakes. He didn't deny it. Stood up and made a statement and accepted responsibility for it.  It is more likely that your sons will get the "cool" pressure from the kids they are around every day that you aren't even aware of or that they will encounter in life.  Use it as a learning tool.  We don't own Michael and he has no obligation to do as we see fit.  People need to stop assigning the responsibility for their children to "hero's" and be the hero's themselves.  Just my opinion on a very interesting question.|`|ffbbb387bd63bd0363e7b715ef26680caa	In my opinion, any kid who would smoke pot because Michael Phelps did it would eventually have smoked pot anyway the first time some cool kid at school offered it.  Michael Phelps is human.  He got caught breaking a law that probably would be appealed if the nation was allowed to vote on it.  The fact that he is a hugely talented athlete does not make him a hero or a role model for the moral behavior of our children or grandchildren.  It just makes him a talented athlete who worked hard to achieve a goal.  As far as I'm concerned, the only standard he has to uphold is that standard that he sets for himself, his family, and his friends.|`|LQ52bOFFaa	I am in full agreement.  As long as it's illegal he shouldn't have done it.  Everyone looked up to him.  He is a role model.  When your in the public eye you should have higher standards.|`|c058a8802f5627063b81819d961b2c72aa	Hi Resi . GREAT QUESTION ! I can sum it up with one word, said three times..  STUPID, STUPID, STUPID !!!    Surely, his moment of "dumbassness", must have caused some embarassment to his mother. I wonder if he thought of her, as he was "huffing" away.  He'll be very lucky if they don't take his medals away from him, because they are going to sure as heck, crawl all over him with investigations and such, while he was in China.|`|CMSmwIPhaa	i mean it isint kool. but i mean he has a life to|`|AA12185428	I missed the whole drug thing(in society) and not only don't get it but wonder why it is such a wink-wink on TV, like we all do it. Sorry Charlie leave me out of that experience. Hope he learned to grow up and say no. I'm guessing his athletic schedule gave him more fun than being dopey.Now if the picture was from last week that would be a different thing.|`|vOYyFqxRaa	At least he did not do steroids. I guess being a child of the 60's and 70's, I am not shocked by this. I don't think it is a big deal really.

What's wrong with a little peace as long as you stay away from camera phones!!!  Actually I think it's an invasion of his privacy and who says "pot" was in the bong?????  I do agree with you about him being a role model!!!  But trust me it's nothing new to society!!!  I'm sure he's learned to make better choices by this unfortunate happening!!!  And as far as your sons let's hope they learned a lesson from this!!!!|`|to5BW9Apaa	i think it's no ones business. i think he should do the american thing. sue the hell out of the photographer. like it or not, your son's are likely to try whatever happens to be around when they grow up. as i'm sure you did also. people need to get off their holier-than-thou horses and leave the kid alone.|`|AA10570396	Too bad about this but I hope parents does not blame Micheal for what their family  members do. Parents are the real role models and heroes . I just hope this does not mess up a lot of opportunities that winning gold medals can bring.|`|59Wg2cI3aa	His choice sux,  not a role model nor a jock.    Had this taken place before the olympics he would be stripped of his medals.|`|4KF4v3Dcaa	I agree 100% with you.   Yes a lot of people do it, but just the fact that michael does it helps influence people into thinking every single person does it and if some olympic star does it and is still amazing and successful (which he wont be for long) then they can do it too.  And im not angry with him either... well i am. But im more angry with everyone in general for doing it, not just him. But he doesnt even CARE that what he did was a bad example!   >:( im sick of people calling me a 12 year old too and saying "its no big deal" well it is and im more mature than all of them.|`|c2dfad4dc1f663f9f98d8667a84e7f6daa	He is a human being with human qualities. Obviously his marijuana usage has not led him down the road to destruction. Personally I think it should be decriminalized. Pot, like wine or other substances, shouldn't be so demonized. When it's done in moderation it's less harmful than many other substances.  I doubt he had any idea that the pictures of him smoking weed would put on the front pages of the tabloids. There isn't a human alive who is perfect. Wouldn't it be terrible if every single thing we did was scrutinzed and placed out there for millions to see?  Try not to be disappointed in him.|`|jjt2enntaa	I never heard of Michael Phelps, but I gather he is some kind of an athlete?  I think all kids would be much better off if their role models were humanitarians, scientists, great teachers, or missionaries.  Sorry, but in my opinion athletes, actors, music bands, etc. are not worthy to be role models for my children.  Too many of them are overpaid, and highly overrated for what they contribute to society.|`|IWyrJ7o3aa	I feel really bad, Our kids has few enough heroes and here is another one to let them down.==========why the thumbs down for expressing my opinion?|`|dXrHoLMCaa	what the man does on his own time ain't nobody's biznez.... I for one am happy to see that he's not only great, but human , too...    when you realize that a few hits of weed is less damaging than what the DEA has made it out to be, you'll  ease up a bit... and truely, if that had been a beer, or mixed drink, no one woulda said spit....    past all that, the creep that took the picture didn't HAVE to sell it for the highest bidder, now did he?.... I think all those paparazzi need to be outlawed so folks can live in peace....|`|Dmaahsc3aa	What do I think of it ? ?    A kid is a kid. . . you tell them no they can't have something and they are going to try it just to see why you said no !  They know drugs are illegal, and have had it preached to them for years, but if offered it, they may try it just to see what the hype is all about !  Once you are 18, you are an adult, and able to make your own choices.  To me this is a perfect example to start teaching your kids about CHOICES and the consequences these choices make in their lives. . . Don't preach, explain !!!  I have said over and over, EDUCATION is the key !!!!|`|4cd2c7649e1949de04b5f7bdd1c51814aa	We all make bad choices in life because we're human. I'm not condoning what he did by any means. We have to live with our mistakes & he will too. He has let those who looked up to him & idolized him, including my two oldest granddaughters, down. What a shame!|`|AA10067344	Michal Phelps is an amazing athlete and competitor.  US marijuana laws are backward and detrimental to the society.|`|fFqzD3aMaa	What is wrong with his personal choice? I think it makes a statement about how little pot affects motivation and lung capacity. The only standard he has to uphold is to his sponsors, it's not as though he cheated at the Olympics. He wasn't using steroids or a stimulant, he worked hard and won, and if he wants to have a toke or two, I see no problem. Would you be this angry at him if there was a picture of him having a beer?    I think he makes a better role model than before because he refuses to obey an unjust law.    Our generation is very ho-hum about marijuana because we have the luxury of looking up the facts about it, not just relying on old wives tales and the anti-pot propaganda put out by the government. Pot is safer than alcohol and tobacco, it is less intoxicating and less addicting. Read the facts before you judge, don't judge and then twist the facts to suit your predisposition. Why is there this sentiment is western society that everything pleasurable must be evil?     Prostitution-Perfectly safe when legal(see: Nevada) but still demonized by those in control. Why are the reasons a person has sex anyone's business but their own?    Gambling-Perfectly fine if it's a state controlled lottery, but have a poker game in your basement and you're a criminal    Drugs(all of them)- a suburban mom who has an oxycontin habit is treated a lot differently than if she had a heroin habit, why? They both do the same thing to the brain, but one is prescription and the other is *illegal* and the government knows whats best right? Just ask anyone in the tuskegee experiments if the government is infallible.    If you do not like a drug, don't use it, but don't condemn people just because they don't think the same as you.|`|GdvzZRFMaa	i have to go with the fact kids need to pick family members, doctors , etc... as role models   Athletes are for the most part young kids and as such act like young kids with way too much money.  i don't think what Phelps did was right, it was of course against the law. Should his life be ruined by it or should he be crucified for it, heck No. What young teen or adult in any generation hadn't made a mistake. I just thank the Higher Powers that everything I did or my children did was not photographed.    As far as the kids, they are pretty smart. They know pretty much it is not cool. I ask/ talked to my grand all the time about stuff like this and ask her opinion and we discuss it.|`|63c46881d0aa0376d34c1858ee0f160faa	i understand how u feel its not a good thing for a role model to "get caught" doing that & ya it's illegal, for people in a position were they are a role model they should keep behind closed doors my opinion there's nothing wrong with adults to do but it but it should not be shown to kids

For God, Preservation of Life is not priority number one. Sadly, even Preservation of Humanity is not priority number one with Him. For Him Managing the Grand Design of Evolution and the Giant Wheel of Universal Melodrama are of prime importance. His Ways may appear cruel and uncaring but I am sure His Loving Benevolence continues to be available to all innocent people who died anywhere in the world for whatever reason. He is also always Forgiving for all who seek forgiveness.
zBqt99avaa	I don't mean any disrespect at all, but I was only in a mosque once and it was awful.    First I was yelled at by a man in the parking lot (I've posted about it before, honestly I think he may have been unbalanced) and then the guy who finally came to open it up kept staring at me the whole time.  I was so intimidated (and I'm no shrinking violet) I ended up hiding behind Mustafa while he spoke with the guy (who was very western in his dress and manner and spoke english with no accent).    I met other Muslims who have been to this mosque, and they all had good experiences.  Maybe because I'm not Muslim?  I wasn't there to pray, but to try and take Arabic lessons; and no, it wasn't Friday and no, I wasn't in a flashy outfit.  I had Mustafa go through my closet and pick what would be most appropriate to wear.    I'm sure this is an isolated sort of experience, but I have never gone again, and I just can't see myself going again without it being some kind of "infidel night" or something.  (JOKE, but what a good idea for dawa, to have some sort of "open house" for non-Muslims to learn about Islam.)

I ran out of salt for cooking and borrowed some in a small cup from my neighbor and I put this on the kitchen counter and then got distracted and forgot to put it away for awhile. One of my daughter's friends was spending the night and my daughter had earlier heard me say we were out of salt and I was going to borrrow some from our neighbor, so my daughter knew it was salt, but when she and her friend went into the kitchen the friend picked it up off the counter and made the assumption it was sugar. So she says to my daughter, do you dare me to eat a spoonful of this sugar and my daugher, knowing full well it is not sugar, says, yes, I dare you and so her friend gets a spoon and takes a spoonful of salt into her mouth and as soon as she was done spitting it out in the sink and rinsing out what was left, she joined my daughter in laughter, not mad for one second that my kid didn't warn her that it was salt and not sugar.|`|AA12133859	My 3 year old nephew did as 3 year old do and fell in love with his penis, he had to show everyone.

The one and only time we used a realtor it was obvious that he didn't care about us, only his 7%.  I feel that if you are outgoing by nature and believe in the product your selling, why would you turn that ability over to a stranger?  Who knows your property better than you do.

If a house sold in less than a week I would be afraid it was too cheap. Make an agent work hard. That's why we get paid.<br>  If it stays on the market 4 months and hasn't sold reduce the price a little. A house is an investment that people pay entirely too much to lose.  <br>  I need my money, times are hard. Get all you can.  <br>  My daughter was gonna sell her house and I told her it was worth much more. She sold it for more than she was going to. She got several thousand more than what she originally wanted. It stayed on the market less than 6 months; thats about right.|`|2Ta73Ejtaa	Well the whole system may be different here in New Zealand. I believe in some countries the Agent actually works for the person who hires him but not so here. I have had such bad experience with Realtors here that I would never use one again if I could possibly avoid it.<br>  My daughter had a house on the market on and off for two years through an Agent. They kept telling her she would have to put the price down, down, down. It was already less than she paid for it. Eventually she put it on the market herself and sold it the first week at more than the agents suggestion which would have included their commission!.|`|IbbQK960aa	Sell it on your own.

zBqt99avaa	I wouldn't go.  But...YOU have to go.  You have an obligation to go to Jumaa' prayers.  You must attend.  Find a way to survive it, and don't associate further with the group, unless and until people start treating you like a human being.    You could simply approach someone and tell them you don't know what to do, but you accept God and the Prophet Mohamed (pbuh) and you want to learn to be a good Muslim.  If you have, and it hasn't worked, then I have some other suggestions.    You *could* speak the Imam, but he hasn't been very good at reaching out to you until now, has he?  And as a new member of his group you would think he would want to reach out to you ASAP and make certain your faith/deen is grounded.    (BTW, what do you guys call yourselves in this setting?  I mean, a Priest might call a new member of "his" church a member of his flock, so how does an imam refer to those that attend "his" mosque?)    Suggestions:    I know that there are many youtube videos that will teach you to do wudu and pray.  I have a book that has the writing in Arabic, then transliteration, then english (all on one page, step by step) that I'm using to learn.  It is VERY inexpensive and I would be happy to buy one and mail it to you, wherever you are, if you have an address you're willing to share (PO box or work or home if you're okay with that) just e-mail me.  I purchased it at an Islamic bookstore, and Mustafa has read through it and said it's correct.    Finally, in Christianity there are television shows, "Mass for Shut-Ins" etc. where they broadcast sunday services for people who can't make it to church (health issues).  Is there something similar for you in Islam?  Maybe on the web?  My mom (believe it or not) watches a Muslim preacher/teacher of some sort here in Toronto on television.  I don't know that it's Jumaa' prayers, but it's something...    I'm sorry your journey has been beset with problems, but things may change.  You have to trust in God.  Inshallah something soon will happen for you, that will make things better.  Perhaps an opportunity will come up for you to move to another centre?  Pray for guidance, and let me know if you want that book.|`|dPJr1Lbmaa	I am a revert and I have never found Muslims anywhere, anything but welcoming and accepting. Which country is this town you live in, UK? I would speak to the Imam explain how you feel and I am sure he will listen to you and give some advice and help, Insha Allah...    I know you said before you are intersexed, so do you pray with the men or the women? I am not being flippant or trying to be rude I am just trying to understand that you being intersex most intersex people take either a female or male persona. I am just curious as to which you choose if any. As I do realize also many intersex people dont choose either and am just wondering if you are one of those maybe its just that people dont understand your medical issue and your appearance may be confusing for them and this is where the lack of communication on THEIR part comes. Just a though.  I promise you I am mearly asking out of curiosity, I am in no way trying to belittle your medical condition just asking as it may be part of the reason for the issue you are having.      EDIT  If you have not had contact with a single female how do you know they are all talking about you? You dont need to wait for an Imam to "return your calls" walk up to him face to face and ask him to speak to you, could you have a moment of his time. He is there to help you. I dont know of a single Imam that would behave like that. What country is it you are in? What Mosque is it? I know many small towns in the UK only have one Mosque but you are not obliged to go to Mosque to pray, you can do it in your own home. If you are intersex and praying with women its not your obligation to pray at Mosque if they are treating you so bad. Why not at the end of Prayer ask to stand up and address the issue. Ask them why you are being rejected? I find it hard to believe that an Imam will not talk to you. I am not saying you are lying but being a Muslim is about the relationship you have with Allah. I think you are putting to much enphasis on these people. I am not saying that as a person you should not feel welcome in any Mosque and accepted, we all want to feel accepted but I would talk to the Imam address the women after prayer and if all else fails pray at home.      EDIT  Hold on now. I did not say you can pray with either. I ASKED as in intersex person which sex you identify with. There are many intersex people who will not be defined as either male or female and some who choose to live as the prodominant male persona and visa versa the womens persona.  I have no idea what you look like so as you stating you are intersex I was not going to assume you where either male or female and ASKED you I did not assume the gender you live as, so excuse me for asking.  There are many intersex people who are neither male nor female but choose the female role and would pray with women there are those who choose the male roll and would pray with men. That is why I asked, so not to assume. You did not answer my question when I asked you, so as you said females would not interact with you from that I assumed you prayed with the women because if you where praying with men why would you be trying to get responces from the women.  I was confused that is why I asked. Sorry if my genuine question offended you that was not the puropose of the question.    The relevence to your question is some times intersex people can be confused if male for being femanine or if a women as being buch. I was thinking that this may be the reason they are standoffish that they think you are gay.    It was not a judgment. I was not judging you. That is why I asked and did not assume. I am well aware its a medical condition as *I* stated to you in another question you asked. But how easily you forget. It would not be an issue for me because I do understand that intersex is a medical issue but as you have clearly stated yourself some people do judge you for it and this is why I was asking as in intersex person could they be confused about your sexuality assuming you are gay rather than knowing your intersexed.    Its not for me or anyone else to tell you to go or dont. Its you experiencing it no one else, its your call.  But please dont try and put words in my mouth. I was not trying to offend, sorry if you do not see the relivence I thought it was a genuine question myself...    http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...  I answered this question 12 hours ago. As you can see I stated it was a medical issue.        I am not changing anything. I say what I have to say. Whether someone agree's, disagree's ,likes it or lumps it..... My answer will be exactly the same when you get back trust me...      AGAIN.....  If your appearance as a male is femanine or if you as a woman are butch, people at mosque NOT knowing you are intersex might assume you are GAY, and that may be the reason you are having a hard time with people accepting you. I only put it forward as a suggestion, not a judgment. Surely as an intersex person you can see that sometimes the appearance of an intersex person is ambiguous?  I was only asking as I did not know as an intersex person if your persona was female praying with women or male praying with men. I thought it was a pretty simple question myself. I thought it held some relevance to the subject matter. I was not trying to offend that is why I asked and did not assume. Sorry if you where offended that was not my intention, but I am not going to explain it a third time, Paul...      OK Paul I see you have blocked me with your Joe account but this is what I was trying to edit before you blocked me....

Yet gossiping is NOT a sin not to mention their responsibility to make a brother fell welcome and assist in every regard. Love & Brotherhood between Muslims was very important for our beloved Prophet(PBUH), & said it is even more superior than Salah, Fasting and Sadaqa.     Mosque is the house of God, for Allah(SWT) there is no better place than a place of worship. It is central to our identity as it is the center of community, the mosque is NOT and shouldn't be just for prayers. We have our own obligations and our own responsibilities & they theirs. It is condescending & of putting but you must not give up merely due to hostility from some people.     You're not going to carry their burdens you are only responsible for how you behave. As for what they do they will be responsible for their own actions. If you have any problems ask the Imam and even if Imam doesn't help still offer your prayer in the Mosque if you can. You ignore them . . find somebody who will be able to help you invite him and ask him for help on how to pray. If there is NO one remain steadfast Allah(SWT) will open up a way for you. If there is a puddle you don't step in it you just move around it or jump over it. Keep your Eman(Faith) strong and Put all your Faith on Allah(SWT).     You do what you can on your behalf Inshallah who knows Allah(SWT) might bless you with that responsibility. We shouldn't just look too others but do what we can.     "2.44":    What! do you enjoin men to be good and neglect your own souls while you read the Book; have you then no sense?    "2.45":    And seek assistance through (sabr)patience and prayer, and most surely it is a hard thing except for the humble ones,|`|757ce30489e7f56556925d17f1f49f76aa	That is VERY sad to hear, I can't believe NO one is willing to help you. But remember Islam is what attracted you, not the Muslims. You don't want to let these people influence your decision. I suggest you rely on books and websites, since these people aren't very helpful and are not making any attempt to help you. What kind of Muslim does that?     Just be careful what you go on on the internet. Are there any Islamic book shops in your area? Some are very helpful in teaching you how to pray. That's what I used. But you can always try speaking to someone who is on their own in the mosque, I'm sure someone could help you.     Don't worry about their childish gossiping. They shouldn't be gossiping and they know that, yet they're doing so, and in a mosque! How embarassing. Just follow your heart, read some books and teach yourself, if nobody is willing to help you. I'm sure Allah will be happy that you at least made an effort to learn, yet no one made an effort to help you out.    Best of luck.|`|LmKVepcXaa	I've read of your misfortunes with this masjid a few times before. From all that you have described I would say either they have no tolerance or you are not doing a very good job telling them what you want.     Try to post a flyer that says you are looking for private Islamic instruction. Leave a contact number and then describe to any of the callers exactly what you are looking for.     Don't give up on them just yet. You still haven't found the reason you keep coming back to them.    EDIT:  Brother Yousif, Bridgette is not a troll and is not posting virus links. I really think she means well.|`|BOxqd0lXaa	I think that if you quit going, it won't be a sin or anything. Allah is merciful and totally understand why you are not going. If you are really having problems and feeling uncomfortable, then you do not need to force yourself to go in the name of Islam.     It's your choice.    On the other hand, I think that you should keep going if it is not THAT bad an atmosphere. I have never known a Mosque community to be unwilling to help reverts; most Muslims tend to be missionaries within their hearts. This reaction to you is very strange for me to understand. Again, I will du'as for you. I sincerely believe that there will be someone at the Mosque who is kind and would love to help you, but perhaps you have not found them yet.    As for people gossiping about your praying; ignore them. This is highly unislamic and very cruel and immature of them. When you are doing a communal prayer, just copy everyone else in the room untill you learn to do it yourself. This is what my mother did when she first reverted to Islam.

At my mosque we have numerous programs:    For example we have classes for those who want to convert  and classes for teens, children and adults.

e8a42257dd2b34817d2020222ee63839aa	Maybe you're not losing your faith.  Maybe God is calling you from a "baby faith" to a "grown up faith."    Is it really the Bible you feel is a joke, or is it some people's views on the Bible?    Because the whole point of the Bible is to point us to Jesus and His preeminent commandment to us:  Love one another.  If the people around you are trying to say that it's completely literal, or that it contradicts evolution, or that it condemns you for questioning, or whatever, they THEY are wrong -- not the Bible.    Focus on God.  Listen to what He is saying to you in your heart.    Christianity is about worshiping Him, not about worshiping the Bible.|`|ewWUFWyWaa	Darn... we ought to institute a tithing system for grateful ex-Christians!    Before his conversion Saint Paul was instrumental in the death of countless followers of Jesus Christ. He must have left behind a lot of widows and orphans. He never repented. He only wised up! God picks the scum of the Earth to be his prophets and preachers! After his conversion Saint Paul doesnt have people killed anymore, but he still has a special hatred for certain people. He doesn't like gays and lesbians, he hates women, and he doesn't like Cretans. He hates widows, especially the ones that he left behind in his past DUNG (plain sh*t) life as he call it. Now Saint Paul is stretching out to reach the supreme calling in Christ Jesus! So he is denying any church help to most widows and no apologies, either.  He hates escaped slaves and he orders them to return to their masters! Can you imagine sexually abusing masters especially on young little boy and girl slaves? In fact, Saint Paul dedicated the whole book of Philemon to teach escaped Christian slaves to return to their masters and Saint Peter goes along the same lines, too!     1 Peter 2:18 (NIV) (Saint Peter, the First Pope commands!) Slaves* (*including young little boy an girl slaves!), submit yourselves to your masters with all respect, NOT ONLY to those who are good and considerate, BUT ALSO TO THOSE WHO ARE HARSH.* (*Hey! hey! hey! how kinky can the Christians get today? As kinky as they want as long as the secular arm of the law wont catch them! Smart preachers do it in their closets until they get caught! Christians have no moral standards to draw from the Bible! They borrow from the real secular world!)    Titus 1:12-13 (NIV) (Saint Paul writes) Even one of their own prophets has said, CRETANS ARE ALWAYS LIARS, EVIL BRUTES, LAZY GLUTTONS. THIS TESTIMONY IS TRUE! Therefore, rebuke them sharply, so that they will be sound in the faith!    Saint Paul wrote the bulk of the New Testament. He laid down the basis for the new Christian religion. Apparently he doesnt like the people on the Island of Crete. He is accusing them of being ALWAYS LIARS, EVIL BRUTES, LAZY GLUTTONS just for the heck of it on hearsay evidence alone! Christians ought to know that the born again transforming power of God the Holy Ghost has no effect on the Cretan Christians. The Cretan Christians need to be rebuked sharply that they are no good people!  If any Cretan fills out a job application anywhere Saint Paul is tipping the hiring manager that the Cretans are ALWAYS LIARS, EVIL BRUTES, LAZY GLUTTONS! So good luck all ye Cretan Christians! What if Saint Paul would have made the same statement in the Bible about the American Christians? How long would it take to remove a Divine statement like that from the Bible? Obviously, the Bible is in desperate need of an update because it is too primitive and barbaric to say the least!    I know I know Saint Paul was moved by God the Holy Ghost to write what he wrote and he was not aware of it According to the Fundies the eternal Bible is 100% the Word of God and Saint Paul is one of his mouthpieces! It takes a lot of gullibility oops, sorry faith to believe all the Holy Crap in the Bible! And the Christians get extremely nasty at me for telling them like it is in the Bible! Actually I don't know why Christians get nasty unless it is sublimely inserted in their mind to be so as they read their Bible!|`|25Cu0kjFaa	Ah, the sound of a mind waking from it's induced coma.

Or you don't.     If you believe that Jesus saves you, then you go to heaven and will never be sent to hell, that simple  :)     Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation.     The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross and rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what!     Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)|`|WalnRzfGaa	people get happy when they hav a moment of clarity. the realization that you determine how to live your life and not some ficticious childish overlord dictating what you can and cant do.|`|PKULDaC7aa	Probably because you feel free for once with the ability to live your life how you want without worry that a mystical being is going to punish you.|`|ttTDiJWfaa	2 funny LOL    If you go to hell pack what you would for Aruba.

Now that's the faith to believe without seeing, how come you have seen and don't believe? the Spirit is not with you.

To jump start your relationship with God become active in your church or find a good Bible based church.    Become involved in your church and its daily workings.  Help with ushering.  Help with pot luck meals.  Help with clean up day.  You will fill your life with Christian friends, thoughts and deeds.  In doing this you will push out the deeds of the flesh and its lustful self serving desires.  Remember, our every thought should concern our God and others and not gratifying the lusts of the flesh.   You will feel as though you belong to one another and depend and care for one another.  You will feel loved and you will seek to prosper others ahead of your own concerns.      Today, society tells us that would should aspire to become the full pattern of pop culture.  To attain beauty, wealth and status.  To put on a show of  '"look at me and how I have it all together".

As science and technology advances, religion will slowly fade away as the human race becomes more intelligent.

An easy cop out by the christians.|`|zbAKxm0daa	We are not Christian, so you are not going to get a bunch of recruiting BS or propaganda from us.    HOWEVER, we will tell you this;    DO NOT let others tell you what path you belong on.  Not all paths are right for all people.  Our path may not be yours and your path may not be ours.  FInd the path that feels like "home" to you.    The religious path, if any, that you choose is up to you.  NO ONE ELSE has the ability to tell you where you belong.      Whether you choose to stay on the path that you have been on, a different Christian path, or a non-Christian path is up to you and no one else.      Only you know what path makes you comfortable; feels like "home".    Asking the opinions of other Christians is like asking a salesman if you should buy what he's selling (the answer will always be yes, buy it).    Follow your heart.  Start with some serious self reflection and introspection.  That is where the wisdom to make this decision will be found, not in the opinions of others.  Go where you feel that you belong.|`|9kg4eeCIaa	Honestly it sounds like youve grown up and are becoming more intelligent. You need to be free, you are yourself not what others tell you to be.

I'm as skeptical as they come (I'm a lawyer and spent many years outside the church), but I find loads of truth in the Bible every single day.    If you haven't read it much, I suggest you start with something like Ephesians or Mark to make sure you get the big picture.  If I had to summarize the Bible in one word, it would be:  LOVE.  Jesus' main message is to love God with all our hearts, minds and strength and to love others more than ourselves.  What could be more beautiful (and less of a joke) than that?    Hope this helps!

Perhaps you are hearing the call of another God.  Don't be scared, be open minded, and investigate everything.  Take a look at some other people's religions and go where you are feeling the pull.  There are many, many more choices out there than Christianity and Atheism.  Research!  You will find your true path -- don't let anyone scare you or ridicule you into believing the same as them.|`|YfwgvPaCaa	You may not be losing your faith but releasing yourself from the man made dogma you have been taught and following your beliefs with your own insight and personal understanding of your own faith. Just as Frater Pan had stated maybe you are seeing a different side of spirituality and religion that you had never experienced before.   Look up other denominations of Christianity. If that doesn't help then look at other beliefs and religions. Study their historical references, how long it has been studied, who, what, when, where, and how. Maybe the way you have been taught is not how you need to learn anymore. Like - twoasonesfl - stated. There are many paths to enlightenment and the understandings of the divine. This the time you need to reflect on you rather than what others think you should be or how you should feel. I will never tell someone to leave their God/s/ess ever. This part of your spiritual journey is on you. It is very freeing and you will feel much happier. This is where you decide what you believe, how you perceive it, and start asking lots of questions of yourself and others. Sorry I couldn't be of more help, but in this part of your life, this is where you are the only one that can determine your own personal spirituality, with the Christian God, another divinity, or no spriritual belief at all.|`|UsUOZMLoaa	Yea sure Ill pray for you bro|`|SWP4m1cLaa	yes, Christianity is a great religion, but there is something wrong in it > I always feel like this.|`|yL5osbcjaa	well if your faith was tight then it needs to be loosened

vf9g9bExaa	First of all, for the Greeks, his name is Zeus.  The Romans called him Jupiter.  <br>  <br>  He is a sky God of thunder and storms. Although king of the Gods, he is not perfect, nor more than people are then or today.<br>  <br>  He dabbles in the fate of people yet he is ruled by fate and cannot alter nor control it. For example, Zeus was fated to over thrown his father Cronus and it was also fated that Zeus would be overthrown by one as yet unborn. Zeus, as we are today, was challenged to bring about change in the world through people and their actions.  Zeus could not change events or circumstances; any more than we have absolute power over our lives.<br>  <br>  He oversees the rules hospitality <br>  <br>  His numerous affairs lead to an age of heroes who inspired and challenged people to reach beyond every day life.  Yet again, not all of his children ended well.  Helen of Troy was considered cursed from birth for her beauty.  So being a child of a God did not help her through live, nor more than a loving mortal parent can dictate all events in their child's live.  Children cannot not know joy without sorrow, gain without loss.<br>  <br>  Zeus was not an absolute ruler, any more than a mortal ruler or leader today.  Zeus could be tricked by other Gods and Goddesses, just as people are today.<br>  <br>  Zeus is an example of there is no perfection in the world, only the will to strive to exert one's will on nature and others; which doesn't mean you will always get your way all the time.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Lk4aCBACaa	Well first of all, the Greek name for this god is Zeus. Jupiter is a similar god of the Romans, but there are differences between them. :)<br>  <br>  At any rate, it may help for you to actually pick *one* specific myth and find a way to relate that to today's society. There are many stories about Zeus, and it seems like you're trying to write about Zeus in general, and trying to squeeze everything you know about him into one paper. No wonder you're having trouble!<br>  <br>  Here's some links:<br>  <a href="http://www.theoi.com/Olympios/Zeus.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.theoi.com/Olympios/Zeus.html</a><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeus#Zeus_in_myth" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeus#Zeus_i...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.greek-gods.info/greek-gods/zeus/stories/" rel="nofollow">http://www.greek-gods.info/greek-gods/ze...</a><br>  <br>  Remember, keep it simple: pick one story and then try to relate it to modern times! Good luck! :)

It does not diminish the responsibility that we have as parents to make certain that the tools our children and grands need are there for them  I too feel very strongly about this.|`|ffbbb387bd63bd0363e7b715ef26680caa	It will force schools to make choices.  Usually these choices mean that the arts and extra curricular programs will be cut. Parents might have to pay higher fees for supplies and even a book fee.  Transportation might be more limited in many school systems.  Building projects will be put on hold.    Schools are not going to cut their academic programs except as a last resort because they will lose federal funds if they don't meet state and national standards.|`|0115b8162e3b4d1bdce5ffb45890b1d8aa	In UK it may concentrate some "Educationalists" minds on what is essential and what is not. sadly knowing this lot of politicians and their ilk they will get it wrong. i live  in hope|`|AA11296212	Education will not change until we elect a teacher President.|`|M9VMBBpBaa	"Do you think our school systems will survive this financial crisis?"    Why? Are you worred about your non-contributory pension, dear?|`|VQNHDTeQaa	Education should be  put before 3/4 of the junk that money is suppose to go for.  It's really sick.|`|vOYyFqxRaa	It does scare me because I teach art and in many school districts it is being replaced with art night and or nothing at all. We have after school programs that include art but no real program. It is sad because without the commitment to this in the curriculum many students will never be exposed and never discover their talents.|`|IS7Xubkfaa	Yes but the schools are going to have to do as much or more with less money. Schools are public and paid for with taxes. The taxes are paid by the tax payers. More and more tax payers are becoming poorer and poorer. You cannot support a system where the worker in the system makes 3-5 times the salary/wage that the average tax payer makes.|`|9RvOhmY1aa	If the schools would learn how to budget correctly they could survive a lot of financial problems.|`|59Wg2cI3aa	There are a LOT of Michigan schools closing (even with the lottery  and reservation gamboling)|`|wy54YPuQaa	If it gets really bad and they start to lay-off teachers, they will pack more students into each classroom cutting down on the amount of attention each child gets.  The US government does need to get its priorities straight.|`|XVZMXBwNaa	A portion of our lottery money is supposed to go to the Schools, but it isn't, so were is it going to?   Several Catholic Schools in our area are having to shut down, due to lack of attendees. They will now have to go to other schools, out of their neighborhood , or go to public school.   I asked my mother yesterday,  how much we had to pay to attend grammar school. And she said it was about $3.00 to $5.00 a month "per family". I had six brothers and myself attending Catholic grammar school.  I myself was the only one to attend Catholic High School and only had to pay for my books, and uniform. The only caveat  to that is I did graduate, but they did not give me my diploma. They wanted ME to pay them back for tuition after I got a job. Like that was ever going to happen!!! This was in the 50's & 60's.  Catholic grammer schools now cost about $3800 a year, and the High Schools, cost $11.500.  The teachers are having to pay out of their own money, for supplies,  and other essentials to run their classrooms.   Yes, Education if a number one priority, but is is not happening. It is a sad state of affairs. It will reflect on our future generations to come.  If we only were able to get the politicians off their butts, to do something about it. But He-- we can't even get our politicians to pass the budget here in California. The state workers are having to take two fridays off a month, without pay. But the politicians get their perks, and per-diem. And I don't see them taking any pay cuts, or time off without pay. They need to stop the political in fighting and get things done.   I'm sorry but this is a sore subject with me. Thank you for letting me rant.|`|jjt2enntaa	I think our school system has been in dire straights for a long time.  I think it's pretty well accepted,  American children generally get an inferior education than many other countries.   There is a lot of waste in any government run business/organization (can't think of a better word).   I don't claim to know all the answers, but we are falling behind and need to get it together for all our sakes.  i do know, throwing money at the problem probably won't help.  We need to determine where the problem is and why the problem exsists.|`|2R3iJnFPaa	They will do what they always do:  take away from the poorer schools to save the better off schools.  I know, I went to the poorer schools.

UnG3dS7xaa	I wish I could be a gold digger, I'm always broke. I'd gladly bang for cash.I need a sugar momma, stat!<br>  <br>  Seriously though, I think that stereotype comes from Asian women from overseas marrying American men during times when we had military operations in Asia (WW2, Vietnam, Korea) and coming to America with citizenship. That whole "Me luv u long time" mentality is so degrading to Asian women though, especially in modern times as we move into a more racially diverse society.|`|jgpYS0oEaa	I'm not dating a white guy, I'm actually not that attracted to them...of course I'd date them if I liked them! <br>  <br>  I see a lot of Filipinos date white guys, my mom tells me how hard it is over there.

If he is a broke azz cracker like myself, then you are OK.|`|0tNCtgzbaa	I don't think Asian girls are gold digger if they dated the white guy because the white guys will not give all the Asian girls the money everything is 50/50 not like Asian men who gave all their money to their wives to manage and some of the Asian men' wives don't have to work if they don't want to because with their cultures most of the women can stay at home and men work out side the house to provide for the family. I think people make up those rumors because most of the white men are attracted to Asian girls and I don't blame them because Asian girls are nice.|`|4Vmlf902aa	I'm sure they hate it, but that's how it is. I was watching family guy, episode when peter supposedly killed, well tried to kill Lois. But really it was Stewie who tried. Either way their was a scene with Lois's dad on a boat, or something. Then this Asian lady popped up and said "You pay me now?", then he shot her. I thought it was wrong, but that's just a awful stereotype, and there are plenty more of them for Asian women & women of other races in America.|`|hHjPFxEdaa	That is precisely why I don't date white guys. I hate that so many Asians are contributing to that stereotype and I refuse to.|`|GPznIhzMaa	Huh?? You're not Asian but you've been called an "Asian gold digger" just because your boyfriend is white? That doesn't make ANY sense at all. I have dated white guys and if anyone calls me a gold digger, I'll just remind them that I have a college degree, I work full-time, and I pay all my own bills. Who says only white guys have money anyway? If I wanted to be a gold digger, I would throw myself at pro athletes (and most of the guys in the NBA and NFL are not white).|`|fia9gMHpaa	You are most likely White like your boyfriend.

You have the Italians in the South who are dark-eyed, dark-haired and dark-skinned.  Then you have the Northerners with their German features.  Same with Lithuanians, some of them are Slavic and some of them look more Scandinavian.  I've spent a lot of time in Scandinavia and you look very Swedish like IMHO.

The very next day he is going right back to what he loves most  *a mans bod not yours; ).  If a man wonted to be with a woman he would be with a woman.  <br>   I think the only reason why a man says that to a lesbian is because he wont's to feel special in his own mind *so just pat them on the head and say awee* haha.   I think the reason why a woman does that to a gay man is because she knows she could never have him and it bothers her, so she tries to feel good by talking about nothing *Poor thing time to bark up another tree* :)|`|pBJH34lYaa	they don't think that at all you are confused and just see things it that way.  <br>   every one knows that your living a fantasy.,., and they are just being polite to you.<br>   someone once told me that if i turn gay ,its just a "cop out" and now i get it . its to easy.,. and you are hiding from any responsibility as a member of society, and what your doing is basically bad for the social conditioning of our communities children, and you know it.<br>  it no point giving this answer a negative response either, you are posting this question to try and get support, when you need to learn that <br>  the choice you've made will never be accepted as normal by the community, and people are always going to say stuff like that|`|uHUyAzGnaa	its sooooooooooooooooooooooo annoying !!!! but unforunately.. the bisexuals feed into it... and ppl tend to think that all gay girls can be coaxed into sleeping with guys.<br>  <br>  heres a video i did on this topic lol <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgzKhr_tmrc&feature=channel" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgzKhr_tm...</a>|`|FHLKpNv4aa	ME!<br>  <br>  Yeah i was outed one day in gym and a douche bag walked up to me and said"well maybe if a guy had a bigger dick?"<br>  <br>  I called him a scum whore.He didnt laugh.|`|akvrwpywaa	Not me.|`|kwMBBzq2aa	speakk the truth power to the people.

That is how they are created and we are created to need love from them.  I'd heard those terms before but it wasn't until our seventh year of marriage we really started applying that concept.  <br>  <br>  A great resource is Family.org they have numerous podcasts and books on this subject.  We heard about one and ordered it instantly called Men Are Like Waffles and Women are Like Spaghetti.  LOL I know it sounds funny and it is..in an awesome way.  Written by a couple that are Christian marriage councelors who have learned to walk the walk.  The book is full of fun quizes and all biblically based but written for real married couples.   Sounds like Im selling it I guess but it;s that good!  Other than that and reflecting daily on the Word is all I do striving daily to support my husband and be a Godly Proverbs 31:10-31 woman!|`|24d92bd0241aeea71cccfaf017c6c707aa	Think for yourself. <br>  <br>  One churches says he owns you, the next one says have respect for yourself.<br>  <br>  be your own person and dont worry about religious peer pressure.<br>  <br>  Remember Jesus was friends with a hooker called mary magdalene.<br>  <br>  He said love your enimies, he said turn the other check, he said a rich man has as much chance of getting into heaven as fitting through the eye of a neddle, litterally meaning, if your rich you care for material things and will be sent to hell, also there are 12 commandments, rather than the popualrlly believe there are only 10, and one of them was, no man needed suffer a wage.<br>  <br>  Mikhail Gorbachev hit the nail on the head, jesus was a socialist.<br>  <br>  He wanted a world of peace, tolerence and equally.<br>  <br>  Sadly all that was sold out for roman empire style power by main stream christians many years ago.|`|qwExCj0Yaa	Are you freakin' kidding me?

Here is my opinion:<br>   First, your query implies submission on the part of the wife. That is incorrect. The Higher Power created all humankind, and I do not believe that one race or sex is superior. If you believe otherwise, that is because you are not investigating all the possibilities.<br>   Secondly, I believe the title "husband" or "wife" has to be earned rather than granted. A person can marry almost anyone, but all legal repercussions aside, unless both partners cooperate and communicate, all is lost. Your question also dismisses the option of same-sex unions, which I believe are also due equal status. ( And no, I am not a lesbian; I am extravagantly heterosexual!)<br>   Thirdly, I feel that all unions are NOT the result of divine intervention...completely the opposite, in fact. Divorce is not an abomination in the face of God, it is simple human fallacy. Humans need to take responsibility for their own actions. The higher power has bigger fish to fry and should not be held responsible for finding the "ideal" partner for everyone on this planet. He/She gave you a brain for a reason, hmmm??<br>   Finally, I believe that the capacity to LOVE is one of the greatest joys in our lives, no matter weather it is love of a partner, a child, a parent, a pet, etc. When religion starts to put limitations on LOVE, and insert rules of conduct according to the religion's agenda (and believe me, most have hidden agendas!)  THAT is when the whole point is lost, and LOVE becomes just another set of rules, and therefore diminished. What a shame.|`|kn2glb6zaa	Don't let him hit you with a stick bigger around than his thumb and never ever do or say anything without his express permission.

Leviticus 25:44 states that I may possess slaves, both male and female! , provided they are purchased from neighboring nations. A friend of mine claims that this<br>  applies to Mexicans, but not Canadians. Can you clarify?<br>  Why can't I own Canadians?<br>  <br>  2. I would like to sell my daughter into slavery, as sanctioned in Exodus 21:7. In this day and age, what do you think would be a fair price for her?<br>  <br>  3. I know from Leviticus 11:6-8 that touching the skin of a dead pig makes me unclean, but may I still play<br>  football if I wear gloves?<br>  <br>  4. When I burn a bull on the altar as a sacrifice, I know it creates a pleasing odor for the Lord--Leviticus 1:9. The problem is my neighbors. They claim the odor is not<br>  pleasing to them. Should I smite them?<br>  <br>  5. I have a neighbor who insists on working on the Sabbath. Exodus 35:2 clearly states that he should be put to death. Am I morally obligated to kill him myself, or should I ask the police to do it?<br>  <br>  6. A friend of mine feels that even though eating shellfish is an abomination (Leviticus 11:10), it is a lesser abomination than homosexuality. I don't agree. Can you settle this? Are there degrees of abomination?<br>  <br>  7. Leviticus 21:20 states that I may not approach the altar of God if I have a defect in my sight. I have to admit that I wear reading glasses. Does my vision have to<br>  be 20/20, or is there some wiggle room here?<br>  <br>  8. Most of my male friends get their hair trimmed, including the hair around their temples, even though this<br>  is expressly forbidden by Leviticus 19:27. How should<br>  they die?<br>  <br>  9. My uncle has a farm. He violates Leviticus 19:19 by planting two different crops in the same field, as does his wife by wearing garments made of two different kinds<br>  of thread (cotton-polyester blend). He also tends to curse and blaspheme a lot. Is it really necessary that we go to<br>  all the trouble of getting the whole town together to<br>  stone them (Leviticus 24:10-16).

It's time for Americans to support AMERICAN business and products made in USA!  they're out there and it's our responsibility to find them and patronize those businesses even if we have to spend a little extra $ to do it.

He should let them fall so that new, better businesses can rise. The government (especially the corrupt American government) should stay the hell out of business. Historically they've only made it worse (except for child labor laws, those were good).     And if some Americans are unpatriotic, it's either because foreign cars are legitimately much better, or because the media has made it "uncool" to be patriotic, and if there's one thing Americans fear, it's being uncool. Pathetic of us, really. Not too long ago, the rest of the world slammed us for supporting our country, now you're complaining that we're unpatriotic? Americans are simply not going to make decisions based on what France thinks is best!    In America we have free choice to say, do and purchase what we think is best. A lot of countries do not have that.
ry6vQwwSaa	there's three reasons i can think of, i dont know the hadeeths by heart so i'll sum them up...    1) you're not suppsoed to alter your appearance (you should be happy how Allah made you)    2) most hair dye gives a coating on the outside of the hair, its hard to explain, but the colour doesnt get absorbed into the hair...its as if there's a physical layer of dye on your hair...so when you do wudu, technically, your hair doesnt get wet because of this layer of dye, so your wudu isnt qubool    3) the prophet said in a hadeeth that only henna and some other plant really similar to henna can be used to dye hair and if its being dyed, it shouldnt be dyed black...    read this link, its got a few things you should know...    http://www.islam-qa.com/en/ref/6455/hair...    if everyone knew that the prophet said some of those things, they deffinitely wouldnt even consider dying their hair black...|`|UpIjgNV5aa	________________________________________  "Children of Adam, dress well when you attend any place or worship.

The basic principle concerning things other than acts of worship is that they are permissible. Based on this it is permissible for a woman to dye her hair if she wishes, unless it is black dye that is used to conceal grey hairs, which is not permitted because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) enjoined changing grey hair but he said avoid black; or if this dye is something that is used only by kaafir women such that if this woman was seen, people would say that she is a kaafir woman, because no one uses this dye except kaafir women. In that case, it is haraam for a woman to dye her hair with it, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Whoever imitates a people is one of them. If the dye is free from these two elements, i.e., black to cover grey hairs and dye that is used only by kaafir women, then the basic principle is that it is permissible, so the woman may dye her hair if she wishes. End quote.   Shaykh Muhammad ibn Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him).   Islam Q&A  2-http://www.islam-qa.com/en/ref/7227  Firstly: dyeing grey hairs is Sunnah and is part of the teachings of Islam. It means dyeing grey hairs on the head and in the beard, for men. For women, it refers to the hair of the head.   It was reported that Abu Hurayrah said: the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: The Jews and the Christians do not dye their hair, so be different from them. (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 3275; Muslim, 2103).  It was reported that Abu Umaamah (may Allaah be pleased him) said: O Ansaar, dye your hair red and yellow, and be different from the Aaajim (Persians). (Narrated by Ahmad, 21780. The isnaad of this hadeeth was classed as hasan by al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar in al-Fath, 10/354).  Secondly: changing grey hair by dyeing it black is haraam. This is the opinion of the majority of scholars, who forbid it completely, because of the hadeeth of the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), when he saw Abu Quhaafah. Jaabir said: the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him_ said, when he saw his head looking as white as the thaghaamah plant, Change this (Narrated by Muslim, 2102).  And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: There are people who dye their hair black like the crops of pigeons; they will never smell the fragrance of Paradise. (Narrated by Abu Dawood, 4212; al-Nasaai, 5075).  3-Ruling on dyeing hair with black :http://www.islam-qa.com/en/ref/476  I would like to know if Muslims are allowed to dye their hair (not including henna).    Praise be to Allah.    Jaabir ibn Abdullah reported that Abu Quhaafah was brought on the day of the conquest of Makkah, and his head and beard were white like "thaghaamah" (a plant whose flowers and fruit are white). The Messenger of Allah (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) said: "Change this with something, but avoid black." (Reported by Muslim, no. 3962).    Ibn Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: "The Messenger of Allah (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) said: At the end of time there will be people who will dye their hair black like the crops of pigeons. They will never even smell the fragrance of Paradise." (reported by Imam Ahmad, see also Saheeh al-Jaami, no. 8153).    It was also reported from the Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) that one should change grey hair, using any colour except black. Abu Dharr reported that the Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) said: "The best things with which to change grey hair are henna and katam (a plant similar to henna which is used as a dye)." (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, no. 1675; he said: This is a saheeh hasan hadith).    Dyeing hair with pure black dye is haram because the Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) said: "Avoid black," and because of the threat of punishment reported with regard to this matter. This ruling applies to both men and women.    But if the black dye is mixed with another colour, so that it is no longer black, there is nothing wrong with it.   See Fatawa Islamiyyah, 4/424, and Fatawa al-marah al-Muslimah, 2/520.  4-http://www.islam-qa.com/en/ref/1008|`|GPBRLG2saa	its not, although u are supposed to cover your hair, so dye it any color u want, of course i used to get highlights before i wore hijab, its not haram, although really your not supposed to show your hair.|`|FMiCHxHgaa	Oh... :S  That's why my Mum wouldn't let my sis dye her hair black..

It is true that the Prophet(SAW) used to dye his gray hairs with henna, which gave a yellowish, reddish or brownish hue. When Abu Qahafha, whose hair and beard were as white as thughamah (a plant with intensely-white leaves and flowers) was brought to the Prophet(SAW) on the day of the Conquest of Makkah, the Prophet(SAW) said:   "Change this with something, but avoid black".[Muslim, 3/1663].       Basically, you can use black hair dye if you want to look beautiful e.g. for a wedding etc... but not just usual like goths and emos do it to try and look evil.     To be honest, these days, people don't boast about whether you dye you hair or not so its really halal. Allah swt knows best and its between you and him and he will understand your niyyah. I mean, nowadays, you can never judge a woman to be natural, likely fact is that she had dyed her hair one way or another.     But, please girls, don't dye your hair at all. Natural hair is from Allah swt and is the best hair colour and texture and nobody can judge natural hair.|`|OPFsDMk5aa	Lolita has the correctest answer :)    Don't listen to Ziggy (Astaghifirullah), it's haram to die your hair black and it's haram to not wear a Hijab.

He wrote: "At some future period, not very distant as measured by centuries, the civilized races of man will almost certainly exterminate or replace the savage races throughout the world. At the same time, the anthromorphis ape will no doubt be exterminated. The break between man and his nearest allies would be wider for it will intervene in the more civilized state as we may hope, even in the caucasian and some apes as low as baboons instead of now between a ***** or australian gorilla."

I am reminded of story my pastor told a whole back.  A group of scientist announced that they have created life, and were suprised when God showed up wanting to see the process.    So they fired up their machines, and measured their chemicals, and carefully weight and mixed and process everything, finally emerging with a single cell swimming around in a beaker.    God clapped his hands, and said "Nice job.  Now, let's see you do it with your own chemicals."    So we are figured out how to mix up what God already made, and think we have created something.  {Insert Twilight Zone Theme}|`|SMOgjcIraa	Troll!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

8IHfytEvaa	Thank you for pointing out this problem in a tactful way.    Sometimes God gives non charismatic Christians a "Word of Knowledge" and if they don't know the terminology, they might say, "God laid something on my heart".    I am a Charismatic or Pentecostal Pastor and yes, when problems like this occur we do talk to the person giving out the false messages as well as to the body about it.    The same rules apply to Words of Knowledge and Words of Wisdom that apply to Words of Prophesy.  Those rules are found in First Corinthians chapter 14.    The person in charge of a meeting and the Elders of that local church or fellowship should listen and evaluate all things which are said which the person speaking claims that they received from God.    Evaluate is another term for judging.    Here is the passage I am referring to from 1 Cor 14:    26What then shall we say, brothers? When you come together, everyone has a hymn, or a word of instruction, a revelation, a tongue or an interpretation. All of these must be done for the strengthening of the church. 27If anyone speaks in a tongue, twoor at the most threeshould speak, one at a time, and someone must interpret. 28If there is no interpreter, the speaker should keep quiet in the church and speak to himself and God.    29Two or three prophets should speak, and the others should weigh carefully what is said. 30And if a revelation comes to someone who is sitting down, the first speaker should stop. 31For you can all prophesy in turn so that everyone may be instructed and encouraged. 32The spirits of prophets are subject to the control of prophets. 33For God is not a God of disorder but of peace.     Now I have been in churches were these rules were violated.    When that occurs I call the Pastor and attempt to tell him about it.    They don't always call back.    When that occured in bodies where I was the Pastor or an Elder I took corrective actions immediately.    However what should occur is that the group should be educated about these rules and when someone breaks these rules they should be talked to and gently correct.    If they fail to heed the gentle words of correction, you must, to protect the rest of the flock ask them to NOT speak anymore at your meetings and if they won't agree to that, they you have to ask them not to return.    The rules are there to control us, not the Holy Spirit.    The problem is when someone claims the Holy Spirit is telling them something when it is either obvious right away or eventually that the Holy Spirit did not in fact say it.    The Pastor and Elders of each local body are responsible for making sure everything happens decently and in order.    Keep in mind that sometimes even Pastors and Elders get it wrong.    I remember being in church on a Sunday evening when a man in the church began to either prophesy or speak in tongues or perhaps he was giving the interpretation to tongues.    Anyway, Brother Mario was speaking and just as soon as he started, the Pastor cut him off from the platform, and this is what the Pastor said:    "People who don't attend church Sunday morning, should not be exercising the Gifts of the Holy Spirit Sunday evening."    While that sounded good on the surface, the truth was in that case that Pastor was incorrect.    The man who was speaking, had that morning, been conducting a church service, with his wife and others in the church in the women's division of the county jail where 80 prisoners repented of their sins and gave their lives to Jesus.    In that case that Pastor was out of order.    That Pastor was not very good when it came to returning phone calls, so he didn't know what was going on at the jail that morning.    If he was better at returning phone calls, he would have known.    So yes, there should be an accountability process.    There should be church discipline, when needed.    This process is not always visible to visitors and in some churches it should exist but does not.    When I become aware of a problem in this area, I try to say something to the Pastors and Elders of that church.    However, if they refuse to listen, there isn't much I can do except not return to that particular local church.    About 15 years ago I attended a service where Benny Hinn was preaching and he gave a prophesy, which had a time line in it.  Either the prophesy was fulfilled in that time line or it wasn't.    The time given was a year.    The event stated was that Oral Roberts was going home to be with the Lord.    Well its been over 14 years and Oral is still living and therefore as soon as the one year past it was clear this man spoke falsely.    The date of that service was Sept 11, 1994.    Benny Hinn was the Pastor of that church in Orlando and before that year was up Benny moved out of town.    Why anyone would listen to someone like that after that is beyond me.    I've never even heard of an apology about that.    I'm pretty sure Benny knew it was a lie when he said it.    Why?    Becaus|`|RoqxGbgRaa	yes, the pastor and other spiritual leaders within that church should have oversight of those types of ministries.  and if a person is consistently giving false words knowledge, then a meeting with the pastors and/or elders should take place.  this person should be prevented from sharing any further words until GOD resolves the matter to HIS satisfaction.    i also caution you, though.  sometimes prophecies and words of knowledge take a while to come into view, or to make sense--sometimes years.  so be slow to call a word of knowledge or a prophecy untrue.  if, however, there is something consistently amiss in the words from a person, the church leadership should handle the situation with decisive action to protect the flock from false prophecy.    prophecy is one of the most important, but most misunderstood and poorly used ministries in the modern-day church.  unfortunately, there are occasional abuses.|`|ewWUFWyWaa	You don't have to go that far... check the Bible in the first place and see how much knowledge can you get!     Before his conversion Saint Paul was instrumental in the death of countless followers of Jesus Christ. He must have left behind a lot of widows and orphans. He never repented. He only wised up! God picks the scum of the Earth to be his prophets and preachers! After his conversion Saint Paul doesnt have people killed anymore, but he still has a special hatred for certain people. He doesn't like gays and lesbians, he hates women, and he doesn't like Cretans. He hates widows, especially the ones that he left behind in his past DUNG (plain sh*t) life as he call it. Now Saint Paul is stretching out to reach the supreme calling in Christ Jesus! So he is denying any church help to most widows and no apologies, either.  He hates escaped slaves and he orders them to return to their masters! Can you imagine sexually abusing masters especially on young little boy and girl slaves? In fact, Saint Paul dedicated the whole book of Philemon to teach escaped Christian slaves to return to their masters and Saint Peter goes along the same lines, too!     1 Peter 2:18 (NIV) (Saint Peter, the First Pope commands!) Slaves* (*including young little boy an girl slaves!), submit yourselves to your masters with all respect, NOT ONLY to those who are good and considerate, BUT ALSO TO THOSE WHO ARE HARSH.* (*Hey! hey! hey! how kinky can the Christians get today? As kinky as they want as long as the secular arm of the law wont catch them! Smart preachers do it in their closets until they get caught! Christians have no moral standards to draw from the Bible! They borrow from the real secular world!)    Titus 1:12-13 (NIV) (Saint Paul writes) Even one of their own prophets has said, CRETANS ARE ALWAYS LIARS, EVIL BRUTES, LAZY GLUTTONS. THIS TESTIMONY IS TRUE! Therefore, rebuke them sharply, so that they will be sound in the faith!    Saint Paul wrote the bulk of the New Testament. He laid down the basis for the new Christian religion. Apparently he doesnt like the people on the Island of Crete. He is accusing them of being ALWAYS LIARS, EVIL BRUTES, LAZY GLUTTONS just for the heck of it on hearsay evidence alone! Christians ought to know that the born again transforming power of God the Holy Ghost has no effect on the Cretan Christians. The Cretan Christians need to be rebuked sharply that they are no good people!  If any Cretan fills out a job application anywhere Saint Paul is tipping the hiring manager that the Cretans are ALWAYS LIARS, EVIL BRUTES, LAZY GLUTTONS! So good luck all ye Cretan Christians! What if Saint Paul would have made the same statement in the Bible about the American Christians? How long would it take to remove a Divine statement like that from the Bible? Obviously, the Bible is in desperate need of an update because it is too primitive and barbaric to say the least!    I know I know Saint Paul was moved by God the Holy Ghost to write what he wrote and he was not aware of it According to the Fundies the eternal Bible is 100% the Word of God and Saint Paul is one of his mouthpieces! It takes a lot of gullibility oops, sorry faith to believe all the Holy Crap in the Bible! And the Christians get extremely nasty at me for telling them like it is in the Bible! Actually I don't know why Christians get nasty unless it is sublimely inserted in their mind to be so as they read their Bible!|`|oHrqbdydaa	Prophesies that have proven false (that is, all of them)  have not discouraged Christians for 2000 years so i don't imagine more failures of prophesy will bother them at all.|`|1ce25e71aa4dd2eb1e82121617a06b87aa	Even the Catholic Church recognizes the charismatic gifts.

Prophecies are already written in the bible  and the bible is not to be used as some 'magic tome'  as it almost seems this chruch is doing.    Do you ever feel like you are not getting the 'meat and potatoes' of it?  Like its fluff that is pretty generic and general? Well you can get to really understand it and not hae to rely on someone else.    Through study of the bible and getting to know Jehovah it is very clear what each person is do to , every day of their life.    It should not be left up to some photocopied piece of paper and a person who might not really know you to send you on a mission or to have you give more money or for you to to anything.    If you really want to understand the bible and hear what Jehovah God is telling you I invite you to look up your local kingdom hall of Jehovah's wittnesses.    They offer a free bible study tayilored to your time and needs and speed and at the location of your choice.There is NO tithing,no collections no pushy ness. But they will explain things in the bible from your own bible to you that will really help you.    http://www.watchtower.org/    Or you might find this article interesting:    In search of Trustworth Prophecy  http://www.watchtower.org/e/19990715/art...|`|xBGEcPvCaa	in the charismatic circle everyone says God "laid" something on their heart, its true for some and not true for many imo.    many times it seems like its turned into a glorified psychic hotline kinda thing, but thats the charismatic denominations for you, some are genuine but as its based on signs and wonders it is extremely easy for false stuff to enter.    The good point is, if a person gets it wrong then you have little reason to take them seriously next time because the bible says a prophet will NEVER NEVER NEVER be wrong and if you are... then you did not hear from God      @Joseph M... the bible has made many predictions ALL have come true|`|1oYjjp0Daa	In a scientific context the scientist admits his mistake and re-drafts his theory to fit the new evidence.

What ever best intentions men may have they still have flaws. God's word is flawless. God's word is reality. It is honest.

I feel a lot of pressure to be unique and different just b/c there are so many of us.     It is tough being American because so many people hate Americans... for stupid reasons like politics or the media image. Our country is so much more than that!

I have not lived in another country so I cannot compare it to anything. I feel free and defiant. I know some other countries limit free speech more than we do (yes there are limits in the USA).     I wear my hair and pick choose my clothes any way I want. Others (a majority) criticize me but I tell them to shove it (yes I am free to use more explicit language but I choose not to). The community does not have the power to coerce people through the threat of shame (that is just how the culture is).    When I do not like a politician, I say whatever I want about them.     I did not like going to church as a teenager, so I stopped going. And no one can make me go there.     We can sue the government and we can own guns.     Unless there is a "probable cause", the police must have permission from a judge to search a person or their house. When a police officer asks if he or she can search me, I say no just because I can, even though I have never toted any illegal substances in my life.    My favorite part of being American is election time. I can vote for anyone for any reason. If I don't like a candidate, I can write down someone else's name, even my own!!!    All of these things I have listed feel really good.     The downside is that people are also free to express their dislike of my ways. There are things on TV and the internet that offend me. From what I have heard, such things are censored in other places.

He's not on the DL about it either. Im not gay, but i dont shun gays for being who they are. I think its hard for a gay to be a gay altogether, because our society says it's wrong. It really doesn't matter to me. They're still human.|`|VsamHLPOaa	All of my family is very accepting of the gay community. I believe they are just the same as the rest of us and the fact that this is still an issue is very sad.|`|rHHm4XNpaa	why gay people want to be like so much?<br>  <br>  why I need to sympathize them for?  <br>  They are free to do whatever.<br>  <br>  What are you talking about?

ppTanSqXaa	The origin of Slovaks is SLAVIC the same as Russians, Ukrainians, Belorussian, Polish, Czechs, Croats, Slovenes, Serbs, Bosniaks and few other Balkan peoples. Slovaks together with Czechs, Polish and some Eastern Germans of Slavic origin belong to Western Slavic familly.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavic_peop...|`|Qt3Zqfviaa	Neither! A slovac is a slovac. It is like asking ''is an english french is spanish?''    Well russians and slovacs are both slavic people, but slavic people are not really racial close, they are an ethnic linguistic family meaning they speak languages that are close to each other. So yes russians and slovacs are culturally close, kind of like an irish and english.    But remember, slovaks are as close to russians as the majority of eastern europeans are, mostly through language.
geJM58L2aa	I'm not home sick but I got let go from my job last week and have no car [husband drives it to work] or nobody else here to keep me company.

Ku4adPkWaa	first of all, i think you should just sit down and talk to your best friend about this other girl that you like talking to, and tell her that this girl will never replace her as your best friend. she's just a girl that you talk to a lot, and nobody should get mad at you for making a new friend. and a best friend shouldn't just avoid a subject they know you need to talk about.<br>  <br>  something similar-ish happened to me last year. actually, it started two years ago.... but i had this joke with one of my two best friends where i would pretend to hit on her, and she'd pretend to be all like AHH, but other times she'd do it back to me. it was just a game, and it was funny to us. then i guess she started to see something into it (she's very damn intuitive; she can tell if you like a person before you even realize it yourself...) and she finally asked me if i actually did like her. at the time (it was eight grade) i was like NO! but then i started thinking about it, and i realized that maybe i did. just a little bit. it scared me though... but then i was like, alright, i know that at this age a lot of people go through stages like this, and who knows, maybe this will go away in a little bit. but it got stronger.... we still played that game, but less and less, just in the heat of the moment, not a regular thing like we used to. and finally she asked again, and i had to say yes. because whether it was a stage or not, i knew that i did like her, and that she had the right to know. but then i realized something.... sometimes she acted like she liked me too, just a little bit. there was this one sleepover, when we were both laying on my bed, just laughing and talking, and we got on that subject somehow. she asked me what makes up a lesbian, and since we were messing around and cracking jokes, i just started listing all the things we were doing at the time. "well first... you have to enjoy laying very close together in the same bed." "and then, you have to get all giggly around them" just stuff like that, as a joke. but we were both in this weird mood... then, that summer, i took her to the dells with my family, and we spend the entire week in swimsuits, sleeping in the same pull out couch bed... it was kind of the same mood. but right after the dells trip, i came out and told her that i thought that i was bi for sure, and it was hard for me to talk about. but she understood completely. she told me that she was pretty sure she was straight, and that she just went through the stage that i considered earlier. just the fact that she completely understood what i was going through, and that she didn't freak out when i told her that i liked her a lot... it helped me so much. a true best friend will know when you really need to talk about something, and my best friend would never intentionally avoid a topic like that. i really did need to talk to her about it, so i did. and it turned out great. now i know that her (and my other best friend) will always be there for me, and they are the only people that truly understand me. they accept what i'm going through. i will always love them for it. i think you should not only talk to your best friend about the fact that she's getting mad about this other girl unnecessarily, but talk about the fact that you DO like her, and that it would really suck if she acted differently around you because of that. she should accept you for who you are.|`|5TKy9Fhhaa	Your friend might be jealous of the time your spending with the new girl, but not because she likes you.  Sorry but if she says she's just into you as friends than you need to accept it. She is straight.  She is either jealous or truly doesn't like the girl.  You need to find out why she doesn't like her. If she doesn't have real reasons and is just jealous(in a friend way) than there is no reason you can't be friends with both. You also need to consider she might just be being a friend and trying to protect you from a not so great girl.|`|AXes50RBaa	do you even know what periods are !!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  ur friend is jeaolous but not in the romantic jealous away. she mite think that the other girl may become ur best friend and not her.|`|eIQ5MEy0aa	oh im sorry thats difficult for you. and that must piss you off when she talks about a guy, its incosiderate of her, but i think maybe shes testing your reactions to see if you still like her? <br>  she does sound incredibly jealous but you have to find out wether that jealousy is becuse maybe she has developed feelings for you, or she just likes the fact you have feeligns for her, and the attnetion she gets.<br>  <br>  i was ina  similar situation back in school and i liked one of my best friends. i told her and her initial reaction was she actually looked shocked and walked away from me saying nothing! now for months she went hot and cold, and similar to your friend got jealous about other girls who were friends e.t.c and eventually she admitted she had feelings too. but she didnt realise until after i told her, so she didnt have the reaction when i first told her, like your friend didnt, yet, eventually she did realise she liked me too, and we were together for a year afterwards happily. <br>  <br>  i dont mean to say she definitely has feelings but, you never know from just her reaction when you told her, and she is definitely jealous like you said...mybe you should try and just have a serious talk with her, and ask why she is so bothered by this girl? she may open up to you...good luck!|`|PSzzjf4naa	Pursue girls that you think might like girls .

XxPhbwNfaa	That's a pretty persuasive suggestion.  I would back off.  There are people who feel it is their duty to help others heal, by giving examples and hugs, and suggestions however.  If these are the types of people you are talking about, just explain that you are dealing with your grief in your own way, and to please give you your own space.  That's a little more descriptive.    Everyone deals with grief and loss in a different way.  Some people need those organizers, huggers, and helpers, otherwise they would not continue to be that way.    Look at the number of people who ask in Ann Landers, why people shy away from them in their time of need.  Why do their friends refuse to talk about their past loved one.  Some people are just more needy than others.|`|AA11481224	i have great friends    my husband and i have had 3 grandparents pass away in the last 7 weeks    the pain is still raw for us but out of respect they dont mention it. they have said when or if we want to relive the good times they would love to sit and listen to us.    there is always a politer way to say things to others some people find it easier to heal by constantly talking about the person who passed on|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	I have never had anyone do that except one lady in an email and I told her flat out she was bringing up things that opened up the hurt all over again, she apologized but did it again a while later and that time I just ignored her.

I am one of those that go over and over details in my mind of things that happened and led up to the death.  Once issues are resolved mentally, the person continues their grieving in another phase.  I think it is normal.  However, if someone does not want to talk about it, then I back off.|`|rThIVk2maa	I would say "Thank you for thinking of me, but I don't care to discuss it." That would be repeated.

F0UF9DDeaa	Yes my religion has been defiled in many ways. One for all of those who have answered and do not know what defiled means, here is the definition:<br>  to make foul, dirty, or unclean; pollute; taint; debase.<br>  to violate the chastity of.to make impure for ceremonial use; desecrate.<br>  to sully, as a person's reputation<br>  <br>  Now that is out of the way. The proof is that my religion : Christian catholic, does not believe in having false gods or worshiping of statues before GOD. Our religion does not believe in the making fun of GOD or those who follow him.<br>  We are ridiculed for a few fallen priest. Yes it is terrible that those priest molested children. It is terrible when anything happens to children. That does not make all priest bad. Cayle the little girl in Florida's young mother supposedly has killed her own daughter. That does not make all young, single mothers bad does it? All priest should not be looked at or ridiculed for a fews actions that fell short of grace. My brother-in-law is a catholic priest and he would never touch nor harm a child in any way. All you atheist out there that are trying to attack our sacrament, do not worrie you are special to and blasphemy is not forgiven. There will be a special place for this on judgment day and you will see soon enough. All good things  will shine and over come in the end. <br>   All of these things are done every day in our world and in our society. Our country was made for Christians and by Christians and we are not even aloud to pray in our schools any longer, quote the bible to our children in schools any longer, nor can we do any of these things that our Christian beliefs tell us is right, because others whom worship idols or false gods may be offended by our practices. <br>  If you are offended by our practices then follow your beliefs where they are welcome, because before you came here our beliefs and practices were. That is why were are all here. I would be here anyway, because I am Native American Indian, but that is why everyone else is here. To worship publically with out ridicule or imprisonment.<br>  Now as if our world was not bad enough, we are fulfilling scripture day after day and no one can even see it and ridicule you for bringing to their attention, including Christians.<br>  <br>  My proof is we can no longer hold public ceremonies out side of church gatherings in honor of the one and only true GOD.|`|ki0tOVUYaa	Yes; by me. I am not capable of putting my hands on anything without me ego using it as a source of attachment. Human ego corrupts everything it attaches itself to, so to practice religion without using it as a source of identity is the only way to treat religion with any reverence|`|eO2rnf7yaa	I am Roman Catholic.  <br>  <br>  Anyone who thinks Catholicism is not under attack is missing a heap of evidence to the contrary.    Anyone who thinks all atheists just want to be left alone also is missing some very powerful evidence to the contrary.<br>  <br>  I almost never "cut an paste" in this forum, but here's a big exception.  I got this from Catholic.com.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  This article, published on Catholic.com,  was written by Karl Keating:<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I don’t like using the phrase “make your blood boil.” But the story I’m about to tell you will probably do just that.<br>  <br>  It’s about a Minnesota college professor named P. Z. Myers who is an outspoken atheist and a member of a loose-knit group of writers called the “New Atheists.”<br>  <br>  One day last year, Myers heard about a college student in Florida who got into trouble for desecrating a consecrated Host. The student went to Mass . . . took Holy Communion . . . and then carried the Host home with him even after the faithful present at Mass saw what he was doing and begged him not to.<br>  <br>  When Myers heard about this incident, he decided that he too should desecrate some Hosts in order to show his utter contempt for the Catholic faith and our core sacrament.<br>  <br>  So he advertised on the Internet that he would like people to send him consecrated Hosts that he would then proceed to desecrate. He promised to treat the Hosts “with profound disrespect and heinous cracker abuse.”<br>  <br>  He received multiple Hosts in the mail. Then he proceeded to take the Hosts . . . pierce them with a rusty nail . . .<br>  <br>  And Then He Threw the Hosts into His Garbage Can with Coffee Grounds and a Banana Peel!<br>  <br>  Not only that, but he took pictures of the whole travesty and posted them on the Internet for all the world to see.<br>  <br>  He made headlines, which is exactly what he was after.<br>  <br>  Now he’s a hero among the small but smug group of angry atheists who are attacking the Catholic faith like never before.<br>  <br>  As I mentioned, they’re called the “New Atheists”—even though there’s really nothing new about their atheism nor their arguments against the existence of God.<br>  <br>  The only thing remotely new about them is their deliberately offensive, hateful, and disrespectful method of attacking the faith and the faithful. (All in the name of science and reason, of course.)<br>  <br>  Normally I wouldn’t give these rabble-rousers the time of day.<br>  <br>  Trouble is, they’re making headlines and getting people by the millions to listen to their screed.<br>  <br>  And that’s why I’m writing to you today.<br>  <br>  To put it simply, the New Atheists are growing in their influence.<br>  <br>  No longer are they merely preaching to their own choir of angry atheists.<br>  <br>  Now they have a worldwide pulpit—thanks to publicity stunts like P. Z. Myers desecrating the Blessed Sacrament.<br>  <br>  Furthermore, these New Atheists are using their scientific credentials and university platforms to write books that the liberal media can’t praise highly enough. The New York Times fell all over itself when it recommended the books that these<br>  New Atheists have written.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT:  In case you didn't know, Catholics recognize a consecrated host as the Body of Christ.  We don't think of the host as a mere symbol.   The host, after consecration, is the Body of Jesus Christ.|`|VLv3Vzjnaa	Religion has been defiled by those promoting the anti-gay agenda.  Radical anti-gay activists have turned homophobia into idolatry and they're trying to redefine morality.  They seek to convince everyone that "treat others as you want to be treated" really means "take away the civil rights from law-abiding, taxpaying, gay Americans."  Some proof would be Prop. 8 in California.  The Mormon Church spearheaded a campagin to take away the civil rights of gay California taxpayers.  Other large, pro-homophobia advocacy groups and churches lended their support and money to this misguided, evil agenda.|`|pgWv8VaLaa	My religion used to be Roman Catholic.<br>  <br>  My religion was defiled when the pedophile priests molested children and the church hierarchy covered it up, transferring the pedophiles to other locations where they molested more children.<br>  <br>  That was how my religion was defiled (at least most recently). Catholicism will never fully recover from that.<br>  <br>  And I will never be a Catholic again.<br>  .|`|60YOy0rHaa	I hate religion. Religion is what drives people apart.

That's how I live.<br>  <br>  So I guess my religion is defiled anytime there's hate or pain directed at someone.<br>  <br>  Because it hurts me to see people hurt.

RoHjjzXWaa	How about a bit of Italian history? You could talk briefly of the fact that Italy used to be divided into a lot of states, all at war with each other (there are still a lot of castles in Italy, exactly because of that), until the unification in 1861.  Or you could talk of how the language came into existence: the fact that Florentine dialect was taken as the national language (because of Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy), and how every city, and every town, still have their own dialect nowadays (dialects which are often incomprehensible to people of other towns).  Or you could talk of the great Italian scientists and inventors - see here fro a brief list of the most important names:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy Scien...  Best of luck with your homework!

Some Muslims disapprove of commemorateing the birthday of the Prophet (pbuh), on the grounds that it is an innovation, and novelty in religious matters are prohibited.<br>  <br>  Some Muslims say that if amended were made in sacred issues it would entail that Islam was not absolute when it was exposed to the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh), or that the Prophet (pbuh) did not tell Muslims everything that was revealed to him. This would be seen as extremely irreverent by many Muslims.<br>   <br>  Eid ul Fitr:  (1 Shawwal):-<br>  <br>  This marks the end of Ramadan, the month of fasting, and is a festival of great celebration. In Islamic countries it is a public holiday.<br>  <br>  The first Eid was celebrated in 624 CE by the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) with his comrades and kins after the triumph of the battle of Ghazwa -e-Badar. Muslims are not only celebrating the end of fasting, but expressing gratitude to Allah Almighty for the assistance and potency that he gave them throughout the previous month to help them carry out self-control. The fiesta begins when the first view of the new moon is seen in the sky.<br>  <br>  The festive feeling is enlarged by everyone wearing best or new attire, and decorating their homes. There are extraordinary services out of doors and in masjids, parade through the streets, and of course, a special celebratory meal-eaten during daytime, the first daytime meal Muslims will have had in a month. Eid is also marked as a time of pardon, and making atonement.<br>   <br>  Eid ul Adha:  (10 Dil Hijja):-<br>  <br>  This fiesta symbols the end of the Hajj or holy pilgrimage, which is one of the 5 pillars of Islam. though it is celebrated by all Muslims, not just individuals who are on the pilgrimage.<br>  <br>  This is a 3-day public holiday in Muslim countries. The festival memorizes the prophet Ibrahim's readiness to sacrifice his son when God decree him to... Ibrahim's whole compliance to the will of God is celebrated by Muslims each year. Each Muslim, as they celebrate, reminds themselves of their own submission to God, and their own willingness to sacrifice anything to God's wishes.<br>  <br>  During the festival Muslims who can afford to, sacrifice domestic animals, usually sheep, as a sign of Abraham sacrifice. The meat is dispersed among family, kiths and the deprived, who each get a third share.<br>   <br>  Ashura: (10 Muharram):-<br>  <br>  Shi'aat in particular use the day to commemorate the martyrdom of Hussain, a grandson of the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) in 680 A.D.<br>  <br>  It marks two past events: the day Nuh (Noah) left the Ark , and the day that Musa (Moses) was saved from the Egyptians by Allah Almighty . Shi'aat in particular exercise the day to honor the martyrdom of Hussain, a grandson of the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) in 680 A.D. In Shi'aat communities this is a somber day: plays a replica of martyrdom, repeatedly staged and many take part in bereavement ceremony.<br>   <br>  Al-Hijra:  (1 Muharram):-<br>  <br>  This carnival celebrates the Hijra (or Hegira) in 622 A.D when the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) moved from Mecca to Medina .<br>  <br>  Al-Hijra, the Islamic New Year, is the first day of the month of Muharram. It symbols the Hijra (or Hegira) in 622 A.D when the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) moved from Mecca to Medina , and set up the first Islamic state. The Muslim calendar counts dates from the Hijra.<br>  <br>  There is no precise spiritual service required on this day, but Muslims will think about the broad meaning of Hijra, and observe this as a good time for "New Year Resolutions". The Qur'an uses the word Hijra to mean moving from a bad place or state of affairs to a good one - and so Muslims may believe about how their belief helps them leave behind bad ways of living and attain a healthier life. The date marks the opening of Islam as a community in which pious and earthly life were completely incorporated. It was a community inspired by God, and totally obedient to God; a group of people bound as one by faith.<br>  <br>  By breaking the connection with his own clan the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) established that tribal and family loyalties were unimportant compared to the bonds of Islam. This Muslim community grew progressively over time, unifying the many tribes that had made up the Arab world in advance. Islam now evolved as a joint spiritual and earthly community, with political and military power working hand in hand with spiritual authority and direction. At the same time the community developed the religious and ethical codes of actions that still provide the base of Muslim existence.<br>   <br>  Lailat al Qadr  (27 Ramadan):-<br>  <br>  The fiesta of The Night of command symbols the night in which the Qur'an was first opened to the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) by Allah Almighty .<br>  <br>  Muslims observe this as the most important event in history, and the Qur'an says that this night is better than a thou<br>  <br>  Hope that helps :)|`|U5zcbHuZaa	I only really know about Ramadan, that it comes once a year on a lunar calendar and you fast from sunup to sundown for about 30 days and do extra prayer and contemplation and charity, the rest are all fuzzy to me and I'm learning as I go along.

Don't be so willing to give up when things get tough.  This life is not just about having a fun good ole time. Just pray for strength and let God guide you.  Yes, you will make mistakes in life, but when you do just get up, dust your shoulders off, and keep on pushing on. Last, but not least Jesus said that He will never leave us nor forsake us.Hebrews 13:5  May God Bless.|`|XCQDebdtaa	May I ask you a question? <br>  <br>  Isn't love more real when you know the bad as well as the good? <br>  <br>  What I mean is this. When you love someone, truly love them, it's in spite of their faults. To me, when someone says they love me without knowing the parts of me that are horrible and selfish, it feels fake. I think, "What will you do when you find out? Will you still love me? Will you abandon me because I'm not good enough anymore?" I'm that kinda cynical person sometimes, but it's because I know that there are people who are really that shallow. <br>  <br>  When people tell you that Jesus loves you, they aren't trying to tell you that He loves you any more than anyone else, that you're more amazing and fantastic and all around more perfect than other people. It's because He knows you. Not just the you that you show to the world, the ways that you protect yourself from being hurt, the armor and weapons that you use against others. He sees everything that you are and, more importantly, can be. There is a great potential in all people, untapped greatness that hasn't been reached yet. And it's so hard to see in ourselves. I hurts, it makes you angry, it makes you want to hurt something, am I right? That's how it is for me. Like there's this total goddess, this powerful, wonderful, amazing creature, just outside my reach, and I'd give anything if I could just reach her, just BE her, RIGHT NOW, not later. It's still comfoting to know she's there.<br>  <br>  I would suggest that you look at the positive things about yourself. I won't tell you not to see the negative, because you can't do that, they're part of you and you can't just forget about them. But all people have something in them that is beautiful. Everyone has at least one talent. You mentioned one already. You help people, yes? To the exclusion of all else? Isn't that what Jesus asks? I'll tell you right now, not everyone has the capacity to put everything aside to help another. I don't. I like to help people, but I pretty much come first in my life. Very few people can honestly say that they don't do the same thing, even if they feel bad about it. Personally, I hate it about myself. I admire that quality in you. I admire your ability to be honest with yourself, another rare gem. I admire you speaking your mind. I'm trying to teach myself not to be an introvert and it sucks because I can't talk to people very well. I'm a grown woman with the social skills of a middle school kid. I've been depressed for almost exactly 20 years. It's deadening, makes everything harder, especially loving yourself. It just means you have to try harder than other people, but that's okay, it also makes you stronger. Spiritual weight lifting. Will you punch me in the face if I say something as cliche as "no pain, no gain"?<br>  <br>  And, because I can't not say it, here's this: If you don't like the person you are, change it. Trusting people sucks, but try something simple, like telling your mother you love her. That might not be simple for you, I don't know, but it'll be good for both of you if you mean it.<br>  <br>  Wow, do I ever shut up? Sorry. If anything in all this actually answers a part of your question, I'm glad. If not, feel free to discard as irrelevant.|`|fgwzCiNWaa	How Kind is Allah!<br>    <br>  There lived an idolator in the past who made an idol out of stone and would worship it everyday. He would call it upon it by saying "Ya Sanam." For seventy years, he worshipped this idol. One day by mistake he uttered "Ya Samad" instead of Ya Sanam. Samad is a name of Allah which means The Self Sufficient Master. Allah Ta'ala immediately replied back to this idolator by saying "I am present oh My slave." The angels asked Allah why He replied to him since he didn't even call upon Him intentionally. Allah told the angels that for seventy years I have been waiting for this servant of mine to turn towards Me!<br>  <br>  If a mother has only one child then how much would she love him? He would be the coolness of her eyes and the comfort of her heart. But if this son calls her saying "Mommy" more than four or five times, she would get irritated eventhough she loves him more than her ownself. On the other hand, when we call Allah once, He replies back to us 70 times by saying "Labbaik Ya Abdi (I am here oh My slave)." How unfortunate we are that we have not recognized our Allah who is so Kind, Merciful and Forgiving.<br>  <br>  Source: Extracted from the lecture by Shaikh Tariq Jameel.<br>  <br>  I know that you are a christian followers, but i just give you the discription of how Allah loves all his creations no matter who they are. He shows all the truth in Quran, and yet, people don;t see it because they read it with blind heart and not with the intention to find the truth. <br>  <br>  This simple story explains to you how much actually Allah loves us even by just calling out His name once. In islam, a person is not judge by his or her talents or beauty, but it all depends on how we use all the the things Allah has given us in the right way. That is islam the submission according to Allah's will. Allah has created everyone so special. Only that we must discover ourselves to get to know. Be kind to yourself and others by having good behaviours becoz with that, Allah will love us more. . Everyone can change to better if they want. You must have the strong will power to do so. Do not ask "Why would God Love Me"............because Allah need no special reason to love His Creations, He will just love them by showing them truth of life all the way. You just need "eyes" to see them.|`|mfOXtl9eaa	Because nobody else does. U ever stop to think that's what He wants? For u to be so sick of being in 1 place there is no way you'll stay. God sometimes makes places unbearable so you dont stay in them. Its His way of putting you in a better place cuz He loves you. Its messed up, but it works. And who's gonna say otherwise? U? what ur gonna stay behind and show Him u dont have to listen? My kid brother used to love turning on the stove and trying to touch the flame. 1 day, I got sick of having to watch him all the time. So I let him touch the flame. he got burnt, started crying and never got near that thing again. God does the same thing. The thing He wants the least for u, He will make the most unbearable. I hope that explained it.|`|XAkzG13gaa	I've had a out of body expeirience before that felt like a near death experience. That love that God has for us is OVERWHELMING! Why would he love you even if others don't seem to? The Bible says, "My thoughts are higher than your thoughts, My ways are higher than your ways." In other words, we cannot really know. But he does not think of you the same way that others do.|`|8MonI7umaa	Why would you not love you. Who is better than you? Who can say Im sinless. Love yourself correct YOURSELF and allow God to change YOURSELF.|`|ZKQgAtBsaa	God DOES love you.  God is not like humans.  For humans, love is like money.  For humans, we love each other because we can get something out of them.  They provide something for us.  We love them, because we get some sort of fulfilment out of being around each other.  Our love isn't pure, because WE aren't pure.  God, however, IS pure.  So he loves us purely.  And that means that love isn't a system of 'if I scratch your back, you scratch mine' kind of thing for him.  Like you said 'And God loves me because?  How am I useful to him?'  God isn't looking for any favors from you, he just loves because you are his child.  He wants the same love in return from you.  Thats all God wants from you, is a relationship.  He isn't looking to USE you, he just wants a RELATIONSHIP with you.

(dont literally piss on them..it is just an expression i use meaning forget about them heh heh ;D )|`|bNLeCM1Oaa	The answer to this question isn't singular like some people would like to believe.  Here is the U.S for instance people with darker skin were often seen as ugly and not even human.  When the slave owners started sleeping with there slaves creating lighter skinned slaves those slaves were often given better jobs like working in the house and raising the kids.  This is one way a division amongst slaves was created.<br>  <br>  In addition white (as with today) was seen as most beautiful.  So much so that people were and still are bleaching there skin to get lighter.  There is still and unequal representation of whiteness in the media, advertisement and Hollywood.  Turn on any T.V. or go to any movie theater and you can continue to see that whiteness is represented more than any other color or culture.  Even when using people of color one will see that advertisements, movies and TV shows tend to select people of color with fairer skin, curly or straight hair, thin lips and slim butts.  Now of course this isn't always the case but take and earnest look around and you will see what I am talking about.  Even the word white is often associated with pureness, innocence, right and privilege. <br>  <br>  To further alienate black people in this country, the African features like full lips, their hair, dark skin and full butts where made to be ugly and not wanted (funny how white people are paying top dollar today to get some of these same features today).  This kind of thinking still exist today.  While not as prevalent as in times gone by.  Darker skin and kinky hair can seen by both people of color and whites as something bad. <br>  <br>  This is a very basic look into why there is a division among people of color.  To really understand this further one must really immerse themselves into studying what I am talking.  There is great literature out there written by people who have really study this issue if you really want to learn about this issue.  Don't simply rely on what the media is telling you about what is going on.|`|ytGaDM7Haa	because these people are identifying the body as the person or self instead of seeing it as just a temporary covering over the soul.|`|yetTAB2vaa	ignorance.

VYMOwgc3aa	6th grade was by far my most memorable. It's the year me & my best friend, Tiara drove our teacher crazy. Seriously though, we literally drove her crazy. This was her first & last year teaching & apparently she needed stress therapy after.<br>  <br>  In the beginning of the year she would blame random stuff on all the black kids because she thought they were "bad" & since I hung out with them everything got blamed on me too. So after taking it for a while we were like hey, we might as well be getting in trouble for things we actually do. So from then on we were TERRIBLE to her. We'd talk back & never listen, wrestle on the floor, & talk when we were supposed to be quiet. She hated us even more after that & the principal made this "Behavioral Program" for me, Tiara, & like 2-3 other kids in my class. By the end of the year I had gotten 143 detentions & 30 in-school suspensions. I was even in ISS the last day of school & they only let me out for the 6th grade graduation ceremony.<br>  <br>  It was bad & I'm not really proud of it now, but I had fun at the time. Detention was in the Special Education room & it was always interesting in there. One time this kid threw his milk at me & the teachers in there were these lazy, old fat ladies with poodle hair that would let the kids run wild & glare at me all the time. It was weird lol ISS was fun though because I usually had it in the principals office with her & I'd listen to her phone calls & she'd get my sodas out of the teachers lounge. When kids would have birthdays they'd bring her cupcakes & cookies & she'd give them to me because she was on another diet all the time.<br>  <br>  lol & all the girls had a crush on this Alex kid. He was really cute. Whenever my teacher would move our desks around in these groups, me & Tiara would sneak in before school & move our desks right by his & our teacher would get mad. Me & him would joke around a lot & one day he stole my candy so I hit him with a chair. He started crying & i had detention yet again. Another time he stole my shoelaces & stuffed them in his underwear. I was yelling & trying to make him give them to me so he took them out & stuffed them in his mouth. It was gross & I let him keep them. On the last day of school, me & Tiara stole one of his shirts & took it home lol Now that I think about it, we were pretty freakin weird back then.<br>  <br>  lol & one time at school I sprained my wrist in gym & had to wear this brace thing. I couldn't really do too much at recess because of it so me & Tiara went to the swing & were havin a great time when this creepy perverted weirdo kid comes over & starts trying to grab my butt while I'm swinging. So I'm yelling & I'm about to jump off to get away when all of a sudden the dude grabs my butt & pulls me back. I fall off & I break my wrist while trying to break my fall. I didn't know it was broken though because it already hurt a lot from spraining it & I go home & more than 8 1/2 hours later I look at my wrist & notice this bone sticking up. It was nasty looking. So then I had this stupid cast on my arm for the rest of the school year.<br>  <br>  But I'm a Senior now & trust me, I'm a WHOLE lot more mature than back then. I don't know how I could've been so stupid lol<br>  <br>  <3|`|MP1nA5fRaa	My junior year in high school.  We had a fresh out of college English teacher and teased him to no end.  We would throw books out the windows, take his books & drop then to the bottom floor (we were on the 3rd floor).<br>  <br>  He loved chocolate so at Easter some of my friends and I made him a basket of Easter chocolate.  1 friend was a diabetic so we used her needles to inject different flavors into the chocolate @ garlic, vegetable oil, any liquid extracts we could find.  It was hilarius, and mean :(|`|Ym9bRgcDaa	This year! I'm in seventh grade. I have made so many new friends!<br>  <br>  I was at a new friend's house, and we went to wash our hands for supper. I wasn't paying attention and used her Garnier Fructis Shine Serum instead of soup! At the same person's house a different time, we put lipstick on and kissed a piece of paper and her 5 year old cousin's cheeks. We gave the paper to a random person on the street! That night she spent 1 hour and $41 at Build-A-Bear! We are wildly insane!
7GAqoFUWaa	There are things we cannot touch or see or measure still they exist, e. g. mathematical truths like 2x2=4 . They exist on a not material level. Ideas can travel faster, than light. I think about the sun, and its picture is here - it did not need 8 minutes to reach me. These things seem to be parts of our Universe, still somehow not parts of it. We can say, that 2x2=4 was true even any small fracture of a second after the Big Bang, even before any particle existed. <br>  <br>  So information is something different, than material world. It is manifested in it, but is still different from it. <br>  <br>  The interesting thing is that all the information we see realized in the world today - birds and sky, stars and clouds, songs and snow - all this information was there in the blind chaos of rays after the Big Bang of the Universe. The small probability of this special version of possible versions of the Universe is hardly countable, it was so small. And also it is remarkable that Big Bang theory in its essence is very similar to concept of Creation.<br>  <br>  Atheism cannot explain Big Bang, cannot explain where this world come from and why it exists at all. We have an "open" Universe, not a "closed" one - so not one exploding and falling back periodically -, according to cosmology. Had we a closed one, multiversum theory seemed to have some probability. But this way it is hard to imagine it would be true. Otherways even if ours was closed it would lose its energy after an enormous but not infinite number of explosions and fallings back. And it is a question in a multiversum where a single universe system gets its energy and material from. When other such systems are closed, then they cannot give materials to each other, because they are self-centered. When other such systems are open, then their material will be infinitely thinned at the end, so they probably cannot give material or energy to each other again. But it is a question, too, if they might have ever any touch with each other, if they - so a multiversum - existed at all. (It is also a big question if any other single Universe with any structured material other then rays could exist at all with just a little bit different physical constants, than our has.)<br>  <br>  Atheism cannot explain the wonderful natural order of the Universe with its hierarchy (mathematical principles, physical constants/rules, particles, elements, molecules, living beings, consciousness). These are built upon each other so that the level with objects (factors) "containing" more information is built upon a previous level with less information. <br>  <br>  Atheism cannot explain why we, conscious beings are here on earth. <br>  <br>  It is interesting that information is organized and connected to material so that the development of the Universe produces the more complex forms - an upside down pyramide of information is built up -, despite entropy. Throughout this development such forms of material are produced that at last information becomes a dominant, independent factor. Material asks "who I am and what is this world" - so human beings and personal consciousness appears. Particles (humans are made of) begin to research their very structure or create new particles (e. g. in CERN). <br>  <br>  Our world is like as if a hardware and a software was planned to fit to each other and at the end they (forces and materials, rules and information of the Universe) create concious human beings. And then conscious human beings can create new things never existed before - paintings, songs... computers... So they begin to reproduce the process that produced their existence. This sounds to me like the book of Creation in the Bible - the creatures were created by the Creator's  image - so they became conscious and creative themselves.<br>  <br>  According to quantum physics personal consciousness seems to be weaved into the fabric of material world such a way physics cannot explain. Electrons behave differently, when someone observes them. The whole Universe needs a conscious observer outside of it to its existence. <br>  <br>  From Christian side Teilhard de Chardin seems to be a first pioneer to me who tried to explain Christianity and creation to be compatible with all the information we had got to know about the world in modern era. He was only partially successful in this (since the question of Adam, Eve and the original sin is still discussed).

If you box them into a corner they always go for the God works in mysterious ways, and we are incapable of  understanding gambit. It is blind faith. Reason need not apply.|`|52fc15f3a628fde8d25145163ff38134aa	How come you dont want me to answer just because I am wearing underwear?|`|acaJLTYVaa	Join the dark side with us atheists.|`|3m00lxxuaa	If you wanna know more about God, why not allow other viewpoints as well("No fundies, please"). I have to admit, I like the dude with  undies's response.|`|SsB7aRExaa	"If God created everything that exists and God exists, doesn't that mean God is part of the universe?"<br>  <br>  No, that doesn't follow at all.  In fact, that is logically impossible.   Simon is correct that your initial premise is false.  You have made a category error concerning existence. Also, a person ("being", if you prefer) cannot create himself. <br>  <br>  "So perhaps, the answer is this: God does not exist as we exist, but is something beyond being or life."<br>  <br>  Of course!  Of necessity, God cannot be of the same existence as we, if He created us and our universe.<br>  <br>  "But what is this existence beyond existence? And how can we understand it? Perhaps we may never know... or maybe we will."<br>  <br>  By definition, such a God would not be knowable to us, as He is outside of our universe.  We can derive SOME information about Him from the nature of the universe He created (such as the fact He exists), but that can only provide limited information, because the universe itself is limited.<br>  <br>  The only way we could know about Him is if He chose to tell us.<br>  <br>  The question is, has He, and how would we know He had?|`|hQDapmICaa	But for now, the issue remains an unsolved condundrum, an enigma that drives me completely insane, and something that even the greatest minds cannot fully grasp. But can you???<br>  <br>  Any thoughts??? ;)<br>  <br>  <br>  Why the confusion? GOD is the CREATOR. Everything you is HIS creation. How can you compare and say the CREATOR is part of the CREATION?<br>  <br>  Peace!|`|mYAbq6fnaa	absolutely god exists. he does not live here, he lives in heaven of course. and we will know some day when god comes back to rapture his church (see the book of revelation in the bible.) and most of the answers that you are looking for is in the bible. check it out, its pretty darn awesome. and for people that have god in their heart, there is no question of his existence.|`|wuPTBIIuaa	in my understanding! God exists outside the universe. <br>  <br>  at least in the bible it says he exists in the heaven above the "heavens".|`|29X6EEsKaa	Well if God created us, who created him? And if he created himself, why couldn't the universe?|`|VcD1Q6cUaa	I hope I am not a fundie.  You are correct, we can never fully grasp the real meaning of God's existence or even ours' for that matter.  We are mere mortals and there is a limit to our understanding. Can't we just accept the fact that we may never fully understand everything?  Life is complicated enough, as it is.|`|kdo6qnS9aa	God has always existed in eternity. God created the universe during the same week He created the Earth, animals, and mankind. Pick up a Bible and read the first book "Genesis". It's all explained there in simple terms.<br>  <br>  BTW, just what is a "fundie"? If this word is a derogatory term for fundamentalist, then I am one. Praise the Lord.|`|da3f31f0285fe3fe3296aa9f25dca37eaa	You are correct in stating that God does not exist as we exist.  He is spirit.  He has eternal and has always been.  We has humans have a hard time with this because we are finite beings with finite minds. He is infinite.  Therefore, His ways are not our ways and His thoughts are higher than our thoughts.  We will never be able to fully understand all that God is on this side of heaven.|`|T8X7mrtHaa	We don't know for sure that the universe has a 'beginning'.<br>  <br>  We haven't even begun to understand the scientific principles governing time.

I won't say anything else thou. I will agree to your demands|`|GHdscZ2Haa	Your initial premise is false.<br>  <br>  If a deity exiting beyond our universe were to create the universe then they would still exist beyond the universe but also would be able to interact with the universe that they had created.<br>  <br>  <br>  Be very careful about what you claim as cause and effect when talking about the environment beyond our universe.  Time may well act very differently outside of our constraints.  We see time pass a a fairly constant rate, even with relativistic effects we can not reverse time.   But what if we do not have this limitation and time is just another dimension?   "Cause and effect" becomes meaningless.'     Is New York before or after Washington DC ?   What if you are standing somewhere else?  This is what happens in time when you can move freely in the dimension.<br>  <br>  Think about that too hard and it will really torque your brain.   If it does not, either you are incredibly smart (99.5 percentile) or you are not thinking about it correctly.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The real question is this:<br>  <br>  Which is more likely and reasonable:   That some super intelligence exists, for some unknown reason, in this super-universe and it wants to create a universe of trillions of trillions of galaxies with trillions of trillions of stars each, the vast majority of which we will never see or be effected by in any way, just so that life can occur on one planet around one star.<br>  <br>  <br>  Or that the natural laws of the super-universe can create mundane universes, some of which will have physical laws which allow life, as we know it, to occur.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I find the concept of this entity spontaneously existing and creating universes totally ridiculous.

Given the state of the economy today, I am leaning more and more toward socialism...you might enjoy reading "The Jungle" by Upton Sinclair, it's an old book, a classic, and Sinclair wrote it out of his socialism and his desire to open America's eyes to the terrible disparity between the classes, but his book focused so much on slaughterhouses, that became the part that got all the attention. He said "I aimed for America's heart but hit it in the stomach." His descriptions of butchering and using spoiled tainted meat caused Teddy Roosevelt to put into effect the Pure Food and Drug Act when people reacted with horror to what was going on with their meat.  One bit in the book stated: "Mary had a little lamb and when she saw it sicken, she sent it off to Shantytown and now it's labeled chicken."|`|3wyxasucaa	Yes, you are a socialist.    And no, we shouldn't share.  Why should the fruits of my labor go to someone who is less qualified than I?

My wardrobe would be the envy of many a g/g I'm sure, along with my 42 pair of HIGH HEELS..<br>  Sometimes forced feminization  doesn't always work out..<br>  It's far better to have a willing participant in matters such as this, and that way you can wear PROPER fitting apparel and even go on shopping trips together.<br>  Game playing is fine for some, but if you have a genuine "feeling" about crossdressing, you have to first make sure you have the right mindset, and then do much research and studying of women, their traits, and all that go with them.<br>  To put on a pair of panties, a skirt / dress, top etc and call yourself a crossdresser - trust me - it doesn't work that way... You have to make a lot of concessions<br>  Rachelle In High Heels

But of course it is the tribal shaman who claims to speak for the god of the tribe that has defined good or bad, not a god. So it is not possible that Fred Phelps is right. He's just found a pernicious religion that agrres with him. The reality is that Fred Phelps hates gays and his preferred version of god is just an excuse for him to express his rabid homophobia and his hatred for America and its liberties.|`|xZ1GD4zbaa	He has absolutely no right to disrespect the dead.

He seems to be ok with it, why can't you just accept it?|`|UbvglIS6aa	If he says he's gay he probably is.  Tell him to be himself.

In other words, there are about a million accidents in the US every year.  In some occasions a very serious crash results in no injury.  In other cases a very slight crash results in a serious injury or death.<br>  <br>  The problem with using god to explain the miraculous escape from injury in the first case, is how to describe the second case (slight crash = death).  Was that then the work of satan?  Or an inattentive god?  And why did the crash happen in the first place?  God playing games?|`|waz8ONEEaa	smash<br>  <br>  v.

68ee405bb00c52b1f70ed3481fd154f2aa	it's a bloody stupid idea....mainly because you don't need to make a pledge... you just don't have sex. and the ring is an even damn more stupid idea ... people see it and take it as a challenge to make you break your pledge...<br>  <br>  it also is kind of freaky ... maintaining one's virginity or not is a personal issue... and what is the point of making a pledge .. does it make you a better person than somebody who doesn't ... NOT IN THE SLIGHTEST...it might however make you look like a real goose if you take the pledge in February  and then in a heated moment of passion ( and DON'T tell me that teens aren't ever in that situation)  you give in to your desires....you would be left feeling terribly guilty for something that is NOBODY ELSE'S business....<br>  <br>  If you want to remain a virgin ......that is your business .. and nobody else's .. you make a decision for yourself .. not to please your parents ... or to make people think you are sweet and innocent.. It is FOR YOU.<br>  Pledges are not necessary .|`|iTEf1dP3aa	I think thats a great way of setting your own high standards and goals...and you should definitely wear your ring anywhere you go if you want.

If you're not going to have sex, then don't.  But what if you make the pledge and then a year from now you find that you want to have (presumably safe) sex?  Are you going to want to beat yourself up for not holding yourself to something that for intents and purposes is just a way for you to tell yourself not to have sex?  <br>  <br>  Wear a ring?  On what part of your body?|`|MJdUkar5aa	On the whole I think this is a rather impulsive and in the long run meaningless gesture. It may mean something for you now, but you might think differently in a couple of years time. The statistics show that most people who make these sorts of pledges break them. <br>  <br>  So if you want to make a discreet commitment to yourself to stay chaste, that is your privelege, and I would respect you for that. But the ring is just window dressing and drawing attention to yourself, singling yourself out as being somehow superior to others. I don't like that aspect of it.|`|2ydF6OTAaa	If you are committed to this and plan on being a virgin until marrige, then go for it!|`|cnyU6KXzaa	As a Junior in high school, I would say stick to your guns and take the pledge. The ring on the other hand is a tough call, if you are thick skinned and perhaps ready to take some insults like "Prude" or something of that nature, I would say yes. I, on the other hand, would not because it bothers me to be made fun of.|`|V5GtTrtsaa	If you're serious about it, make a pledge.

hXQnR2Scaa	If you mean suicide, it is neither fast nor painless. And not always fatal.
vDr5aROwaa	Heaven is the place where all Christians hope to someday be, They don't have to hope, they know they will go to heaven one day. As for not practicing suicide, If we did that, then Christ would not have anyone to work through them and try to reach people like you. But as for dying, trust me, if you are a Christian you are not afraid at all when that day comes. To be afraid to die and claim to be a Christian is an insult to God, because to die is to be with God.|`|65acc76e92b58370c5ab4fb1e64d7746aa	Remember that death is inevitable. No matter if you are a Christian or not. We die because of our sins. For the wages of sin is death, but through the gift of God' Jesus Christ is Life ( Romans 6:23).  We are to do the best that we can while we are down here on earth.  Our goal also is to teach and spread the good news of Jesus Christ and to tell of our salvation through Him.  I am too joyful to kill myself.  Death itself will take my soul one day and yours as well.  Death is not our ultimate goal. Eternal Life through the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ is the ultimate goal. Nice question though. I hope that I opened your mind on that issue. May God Bless you.|`|qpjorXRnaa	Whoa, Whoa. We do not want to die, we are prepared to die if necessary, but our goal is to live a life that glorifies our Lord Jesus. We live as examples of Christ's great love.

65acc76e92b58370c5ab4fb1e64d7746aa	I would not renounce my Christian faith, because He is the source of my life.  God will never put me in a situation where he won't be able to deliver us from.  He delivered Jesus after death from the cross and pronounced Him King of Kings and Lord of Lords. Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends. (John15:13)  You have to be willing to be a living sacrifice like Jesus.  He gave up his life so that we may inherit life as well.  Also note that when you believe. You give up living your life for your own sake, but you live the way the Holy Spirit instructs you to do. I hope and pray for your safety and for God to deliver you from your enemies. May God Bless you.|`|VcD1Q6cUaa	I am very human with human faults and weaknesses.  I might tell them I renounce my faith even though I keep it burning in my heart.  I will have to leave the place and go elsewhere where i can continue my missionary work.  I think this is more realistic in this day and age.  I also believe that God is not an unreasonable God.  He knows our need for self-preservation, and if it serves his purpose, I don't see why there's a need to be a martyr so soon.|`|5tEd4ZBLaa	i would take my chances with not renouncing just because i really do believe in god so i believe he would help me out a bit but if he didnt theres no reason to be really angry because youll be going to heaven    btw im kind of complacent i have a very calm look on life so dying isnt hard for me so this might be very different from other opinions|`|WOBTw8jzaa	I wouldn't really pick any, because I wouldn't renounce my christian faith just to live.

It makes me feel guilty when i think about things like THIS, because Jesus got on the cross for us just like that. he was beaten and tortured all night just for us. and i can't even answer what i would do. When you're scared when your life is threatened, you don't know what to say. all you can do is pray to God that you will say the right thing. so its impossible for me to answer until i'm in the moment.<br>  <br>  Lastly why would any christian move to a foreign country where Christianity is despised? almost as if you're asking for it. not a smart move.

h46Oxo95aa	NO, you are not a failure. Keep this in mind, always try your best in whatever task it might be. I used to feel like this when I was in elementary too. You see life doesn't always  turn out the way you expect it to. What you should do is work to your fullest potential and never ever give up. Keep on trying and trying. I too wasn't the best student in elementary but by the time I got into middle school I got much better keeping my grades up. It takes determination,self-esteem,and belief in your own self. Trust yourself and have an impression on yourself too. By working hard and trying your best, who knows you maybe become the smartest kid with the best grades in your class. And you got so many years ahead of to  you get better and better. The most important time of your life is when you are in highschool. This will determine what college you'll go to.|`|r3o10XbAaa	maybe you need to work harder?  i think almost anybody can get good grades if they work for it. besides, colleges really pay more attention to high school grades instead, so you have until high school to get it together.|`|h0XtWUW3aa	Work hard and stop being so negative....

They are not looking fo an honest answer so when they are blocked and ask a question I see the blocked symbol and do not waste my time giving an answer.

There are actually quite a lot of Jews and Muslims who want to get on.|`|zbAKxm0daa	It has never really been about theology.    Here's the Reader's Digest condensed version:  Israel did not exist until after WWII.  The Jews were given a place of their own, carved out of Middle Eastern lands by the Allies immediately after the war and this pissed off the Islamic groups/people that were ousted because of it.    It was soon turned into a holy war by Islamic groups to help obtain aid from other Islamic nations to oust the Jews and return the lands to their original owners.    This is also one of the reasons that they hate everything about Westerners; because it was Westerners that divided the land up to give the Jews a "homeland" of their own.    Prior to the end of WWII, the Jews and Muslims did not have any serious issues between them.      Christians, on the other hand, have a long history of aggression toward the nations of Islam, going back to the Crusades.  For that one, Christians have only themselves to blame.|`|jq85LU0gaa	First let me correct you Its not Jews its Jewish    Israelites are the original  followers of the Jewish faith     The story goes like this  Prophet Abraham  had two sons'  Ishmael  and  Isaac each from a differnt Mother    Muslims trace their roots to Ishmael and the Jewish to Isaac     Israelites the descents of the Prophet Jacob who is the son of Isaac are the true Jewish People     The conflicts with the both is    Jewish People reject All the Prophet that God sent and are still waiting for their Prophet , Islam does not     Jewish People do not acknowledge Jesus, Islam dose      Jewish People do not like to associate themselves with Muslims even though the blood of  the Prophet Abraham runs through both of  their veins  through  his sons  Ishmael  and  Isaac   Jewish People feel they are the chosen people because they fever Isaac who they feel is the chosen one instead Ishmael.     Muslims believe both Ishmael and Isaac were chosen as Prophets     Muslims are not bias towards neither Ishmael or Isaac and recognize both them equally.    Yes at one point the Israelites" "Descents of the Prophet Jacob" who is the son of Isaac "were" the chosen people of God. Not the "Imposter's Zionists" who clam they Jewish     Islam acknowledges the Jewish People "were" the chosen people of God, However lost that privilege because they broke the covenant "Laws" of God     Not all Jewish and Muslims People hate each other     End of Story

AxAsMsAZaa	4 leaf clover = According to legend, each leaflet represents something: the first is for hope, the second is for faith, the third is for love, and the fourth is for luck. Another Irish legend tells that the three leaf clover, or "Shamrock", was what Saint Patrick used to represent the Holy Trinity.     Shamrock (Ireland) = The Shamrock, at one time called the "Seamroy", symbolises the cross and blessed trinity. Before the Christian era it was a sacred plant of the Druids of Ireland because its leaves formed a triad.    Rudraksh = Rudraksh beads (nuts from the Rudraksh tree) represent Lord Shiva, part of the divine Hindu trinity. This very powerful and auspicious charm bestows spiritual powers, good health, fame and material happiness.   They are used to make the 108 prayer bead stings used for chanting mantras.    Black cats/white cats = depends where you are in the world.  They're either good or bad luck.     horseshoe = keeps your luck in and the devil out if held upright although this isn't always the case, some traditionsv hold you should place it upside down.    Feathers = The feather is an ancient charm for good luck and represents the journey of the soul to the other realm.    The word swastika is derived from the Sanskrit word 'svastika', meaning any lucky or auspicious object, and in particular a mark made on persons and things to denote good luck, although it has now been stigmatised and even outlawed because of its negative connotations.|`|r1D9P4Vyaa	Ok this is  lucky for me.

There are all kinds of "good luck" charms, it depends on you. Baseball, football, and other sports players have all kinds of good luck charms.

PEVkrOVVaa	The festival marks the victory of good over evil, and uplifting of spiritual darkness. Symbolically it marks the homecoming of goodwill and faith after an absence, as suggested by the Ramayana.    On the day of Diwali, many wear new clothes and share sweets and snacks. Some North Indian business communities start their financial year on Diwali and new account books are opened on this day.    Hindus have several significant events associated with it:    Return of Lord Ram to Ayodhya: Diwali also celebrates the return of Ram, King of Ayodhya, with his wife Sita and brother Lakshmana to Ayodhya after a 14 year exile, and a war in which he killed the evil and demonic king Ravana. It is believed that the people of Ayodhya lit ghee lamps along the way to light their path in the darkness. Since Lord Ram traveled from South India to his kingdom in North India, he passed through the south earlier. This is the reason why the festival is celebrated a day earlier in South India.   The Killing of Narakasura: Celebrated as Narak Chaturdashi, one day before Diwali day, it commemorates the killing of Narakasura, an evil demon who created havoc, by Lord Krishna's wife Satyabhama. This happened in the Dwapar Yuga during this time of Lord Krishna's avatar. In another version, the demon was killed by Lord Krishna (Lord Krishna provokes his wife Satyabhama to kill Narakasura by pretending to be injured by the demon. Narakasura can only be killed by a woman) himself.[citation needed] Before Narakasura's death, he requested a boon from Satyabhama (believed to be an Avatar of Bhudevi), that everyone should celebrate his death with colorful light.   Austerities of Shakti: According to the Skanda Purana, the goddess Shakti observed 21 days of austerity starting from ashtami of shukla paksha (eighth day of the waxing period of moon) to get half of the body of Lord Shiva. This vrata (austerity) is known as kedhara vrata. Deepavali is the completion day of this austerity. This is the day Lord Shiva accepted Shakti into the left half of the form and appeared as Ardhanarishvara. The ardent devotees observe this 21 days vrata by making a kalasha with 21 threads on it and 21 types of offerings for 35 days. The final day is celebrated as kedhara gauri vrata. In eastern part of India, specially in Bengal, Kali puja has been celebrated on the day of Diwali.   Birth of Goddess Lakshmi: According to the Puranas, the goddess of Wealth, Prosperity and Luck Lakshmi was born from the churning of the Milk Ocean, along with other magical beings and objects including Amrit, Kamadhenu,Chintamani, Halahal aka Poison, etc. She was sought by both the Devas(Gods) and Danavas(Demons) but she chose Vishnu as her husband.   Krishna defeating Indra: Govardhan Puja is celebrated the day after Diwali. It is the day Lord Krishna defeated Indra, the deity of thunder and rain. As per the story, Krishna saw huge preparations for the annual offering to Lord Indra and questions his father Nanda about it. He debated with the villagers about what their 'dharma' truly was. They were farmers, they should do their duty and concentrate on farming and protection of their cattle. He continued to say that all human beings should merely do their 'karma', to the best of their ability and not pray for natural phenomenon. The villagers were convinced by Krishna, and did not proceed with the special puja (prayer). Indra was then angered, and flooded the village. Krishna then lifted Mt Govardhan and held it up as protection to his people and cattle from the rain. Indra finally accepted defeat and recognized Krishna as supreme. This aspect of Krishna's life is mostly glossed over[citation needed] but it set up the basis of the 'karma' philosophy later detailed in the Bhagavat Gita.|`|yyn6ES94aa	every1 has answered u the reasons of diwali.so i don't need to repeat them again.wat i feel is that hindus have some love towards fire.in every festival there is a component of fire/pollution|`|1tLmTjBxaa	why not links please?it can be found on google,well its coz God Krishna killed narkasura the demon,its firing crackers,rockets and for women just lighting lamps..and i used to clelbrate it in childhood with crackers and lotta thingz but now i confine myself to 1 pack of rocket.|`|8wHg5MECaa	Deepawali is due to return of Raja Ram in night in small town of a district in UP in India.|`|331444a2b76e68eeff0a4ce275773130aa	Long story short, it is the Hindu New Year which is a celebration of light.|`|AA11845103	Diwali is the festival of light(usually celebrated with burning lots of candles and fireworks and eating loads of sweets).It represents the day when hindu lord Rama returned from  exile.

The attitudes are more like the 1950s than the early 70s when feminism was something people really believed it.  Nowadays, feminists are made into a charicature, a bad joke, someone to avoid emulating...and I think that's truly a shame that so many in the younger generation (under 35) have bought into the negative publicity out there about feminist and feminism....usually stuff started by right wing fundies and pundits. It all goes back to the old "boys won't like you if you're smart" mentality.  So a lot of women would rather "play dumb and coquettish" and have/keep a man than use their talents God gave them and truly be intelligent and independent and risk not having a boyfriend/husband or perhaps making the man angry or vengeful.    It's seems like the price a woman pays for independence these days is to forfeit love...and that just sucks!

CfZn9kK5aa	I think it's noble to be a single parent period.  These people try their hardest to take care of their children.. They could give up and give the child to the state, but they don't.     You're also assuming that all single parents are unwed. Some divorce, some times one of the parents dies... Things happen that separate parents.|`|7q78bhAaaa	I don't think its noble to be a single mother. I think it can be really tough and some don't/can't even pull through creating damage to the child. Maybe it's respect that someone can pull it off but it's not noble at least not to me. No one should have children until they are stable and secure enough to. So if a single mother is secure and stable with her situtation then by all means do what she likes.

You are selling-out because you are not contributing and your life/legacy will mean nothing.  Being edcauted/prepared/well-mannerd never goes out of style.      You have a point, however, with the cultural lines being blurred in America as they currently are, and more people of color trailblazing, who then re-defines 'selling-out'?  I'm not so much concerned with that as I am educating & preparing the youth of this nation and flooding them with images like the Ralph J.

The black people of the 60's and 70's would not take any of the black youths who worship mainstream rap and hip hop today seriously.

I think it's odd that the so-called "stereotypical" black people think that it's wrong to educate yourself and live a diverse lifestyle.  Those qualities would have been praised by all blacks in the 60's and 70's.

Brush sage into the four corners of your household that is were a demon will stay if they are there. Be sure to say aloud this prayer when ever you feel the demon its an exorcism ritual. <br>  <br>  CHAPTER III: EXORCISM OF SATAN AND THE FALLEN ANGELS<br>  <br>  {Whereas the preceding rite of exorcism is designated for a particular person, the present one is for general use--to combat the power of the evil spirits over a community or locality.}<br>  <br>  The following exorcism can be used by bishops, as well as by priests who have this authorization from their Ordinary.<br>  <br>  In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.<br>  <br>  Prayer to St. Michael the Archangel<br>  <br>  St. Michael the Archangel, illustrious leader of the heavenly army, defend us in the battle against principalities and powers, against the rulers of the world of darkness and the spirit of wickedness in high places. Come to the rescue of mankind, whom God has made in His own image and likeness, and purchased from Satan's tyranny at so great a price. Holy Church venerates you as her patron and guardian. The Lord has entrusted to you the task of leading the souls of the redeemed to heavenly blessedness. Entreat the Lord of peace to cast Satan down under our feet, so as to keep him from further holding man captive and doing harm to the Church. Carry our prayers up to God's throne, that the mercy of the Lord may quickly come and lay hold of the beast, the serpent of old, Satan and his demons, casting him in chains into the abyss, so that he can no longer seduce the nations.<br>  Exorcism<br>  <br>  In the name of Jesus Christ, our Lord and God, by the intercession of Mary, spotless Virgin and Mother of God, of St. Michael the Archangel, of the blessed apostles Peter and Paul, and of all the saints, and by the authority residing in our holy ministry, we steadfastly proceed to combat the onslaught of the wily enemy.<br>  Psalm 67<br>  <br>  P: God arises; His enemies are scattered, * and those who hate Him flee before Him.<br>  <br>  All: As smoke is driven away, so are they driven; * as wax melts before the fire, so the wicked perish before God.<br>  <br>  P: See the cross of the Lord; begone, you hostile powers!<br>  <br>  All: The stem of David, the lion of Juda's tribe has conquered.<br>  <br>  P: May your mercy, Lord, remain with us always.<br>  <br>  All: For we put our whole trust in you.<br>  <br>  We cast you out, every unclean spirit, every satanic power, every onslaught of the infernal adversary, every legion, every diabolical group and sect, in the name and by the power of our Lord Jesus + Christ. We command you, begone and fly far from the Church of God, from the souls made by God in His image and redeemed by the precious blood of the divine Lamb. + No longer dare, cunning serpent, to deceive the human race, to persecute God's Church, to strike God's elect and to sift them as wheat. + For the Most High God commands you, + He to whom you once proudly presumed yourself equal; He who wills all men to be saved and come to the knowledge of truth. God the Father + commands you. God the Son + commands you. God the Holy + Spirit commands you. Christ, the eternal Word of God made flesh, commands you, who humbled Himself, becoming obedient even unto death, to save our race from the perdition wrought by your envy; who founded His Church upon a firm rock, declaring that the gates of hell should never prevail against her, and that He would remain with her all days, even to the end of the world. The sacred mystery of the cross + commands you, along with the power of all mysteries of Christian faith. + The exalted Virgin Mary, Mother of God, + commands you, who in her lowliness crushed your proud head from the first moment of her Immaculate Conception. The faith of the holy apostles Peter and Paul and the other apostles + commands you. The blood of martyrs and the devout prayers of all holy men and women command + you.<br>  <br>  Therefore, accursed dragon and every diabolical legion, we adjure you by the living + God, by the true + God, by the holy + God, by God, who so loved the world that He gave His only-begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him might not perish but have everlasting life; to cease deluding human creatures and filling them with the poison of everlasting damnation; to desist from harming the Church and hampering her freedom. Begone, Satan, father and master of lies, enemy of man's welfare. Give place to Christ, in whom you found none of your works. Give way to the one, holy, catholic, and apostolic Church, which Christ Himself purchased with His blood. Bow down before God's mighty hand, tremble and flee as we call on the holy and awesome name of Jesus, before whom the denizens of hell cower, to whom the heavenly Virtues and Powers and Dominations are subject, whom the Cherubim and Seraphim praise with unending cries as they sing: Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of Sabaoth.<br>  <br>  P: Lord, heed my prayer.<br>  <br>  All: And let my cry be heard by you.<br>  <br>  P: The Lord be with you.<br>  <br>  All: May He also be with you.|`|NRAE17UUaa	I'd say get a priest to come to your house and get the demon out.

EjyD1sXeaa	just walk away saying that you're fed up with her bad manners and self centred attitude. if she can be rude, so can you|`|Uy58ixnvaa	It would involve a long conversation, but the main thing would be say, "I just don't think we're working out, and it would be best if we weren't friends anymore." And state politely why you don't want to be friends. <br>  <br>  Always wondered how do you stop being friends with someone....Do you just stop being nice? Just avoid them or something?|`|AA11984147	It's always hard when you have had a friendship with someone and you find that you no longer have the same goals or aspirations; that you have both gone separate ways.  You can do this the cowards way out - refuse or ignore calls and opportunities to meet; or you can write a letter explaining your position; or you can invite your friend to lunch and let them down easy.  Be honest, but not brutal. <br>  <br>  I had to let a friend go once. It was difficult because of the number of years we had been close but it was the best for both of us.  We had lunch and I began to trace our history and eventually how we became distant.  I had become more involved in the church and studying the Word and she wanted to continue to party and hang out.  I explained that my life had changed and I no longer had the desire to do the things we used to do. I wanted to be an example of Christ and in order to do that, the Word said that I must continue to love people, but that I needed to select those whom I decided would be in my life carefully.  Since she had no desire to change, I told her that we could be friends, but distant.  <br>  <br>  Eventually, the phone stopped ringing (she didn't want to hear about my church, or Jesus) and I moved to another state.  I hear about her through others, but the friendship was never the same.<br>  <br>  I pray for her and think about her, but I know I made the right decision.  She, unfortunately, has had three marriages, several children, and delved into drugs; lost her job.  That's not the life I wanted for myself. <br>  <br>  You have to think about who you are and the person you want to become.  Along life's road, you will find many people who will be friends, some associates, and some just people you know.  You will know in your spirit how to discern those people who are truly friends.  <br>  <br>  Now, I have three very good friends at work; and two at my church.  They hold me accountable and responsible for my life and the things I do.  They pray for me and stand with me through every circumstance.  They remind me to remain true to myself and hold fast to my character and integrity and faster to my God.|`|zQ6bd8Z5aa	When you find out, please tell me too - I'm in the same boat!  I don't want to hurt anyone but I don't like pretending or avoiding someone either.|`|7gH7sgi6aa	First make sure you honestly don't want to be friends with this person, that you've spent a lot of time thinking this through and know in your heart that this person has a negative effect on your life and you don't want them in your life anymore.<br>  Honesty is the best policy.  Ask to speak to the person in private and simply explain the reasons you feel your friendship is no longer healthy and productive and that you feel you no longer need this person in your life.  DO NOT be bitter or rude or mean.  Be polite and professional and kind, but explain that sometimes these things come to an end, and this friendship is over.  Give the other person a chance to talk and listen to them without interrupting.  If you feel you need to talk  more then talk, otherwise let it be.  Do not contact the person for any reason as you have severed the lifeline of the relationship,  Good luck<br>  Peace, Love & Happiness|`|7dZ5F3dnaa	the easiest thing is to just move on. stop calling and just stop hanging out. you know just "grow apart".   its a little less harsh than just saying "hey I dont want to be friends" it sounds mean!|`|MY292Xvhaa	Just stop hanging around her.  Eventually, she'll get the picture.|`|t93CQekvaa	just tell them to leave you the hell alone. Then spit in there face|`|2ydF6OTAaa	why do you not want to be friends anymore?

iWaU76T5aa	I am Black and I have dated girls of different backgrounds, let me start from the ground up.<br>  <br>  1. Wanisha (Black) - a light skin girl just like me, I am Black and Asian mixed. She was great looking and everything, the only problem I had with her is that she got SO SO SO pissed over small stuff and she would start fights for no reason.<br>   <br>  Why I broke up with her : One day I walked in and she threw a tantrum because I was busy with school work and spent less time with her. I dated her when I was 16.<br>  <br>  2. Leondra (Black) - this girl was middle skin (orangish skin color). She was great but the problem was that I did not feel comfortable around her so we were DEUCES. Dated her when I was 16.<br>  <br>  3. Dani (White) - A nice looking 5"4 Brunette. Pale skinned and extremely intelligent. She was the girl I lost my virginity to and MAN it felt good, sex with her was a joy. At that time, I was with her for 6 months and I loved it but then I was mad that day and cussed her out for calming me down. She left and cried a lot but then we ended up being cool with each other, I feel remorse till this day for doing that to her. <br>  This is how she looks like now<br>  <a href="http://i468.photobucket.com/albums/rr49/IKnozWhoiz/fc_13317_600.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i468.photobucket.com/albums/rr49/...</a><br>  <br>  4. Adrianna (Hispanic, Puerto Rican) - shortest I have ever been with her, lasted for 1 week. This girl had more tempers than anyone I have ever known, pale chick and FEISTY! Dated her when I was late 16, never even kissed, just hugs.<br>  <br>  5. Vanessa (Hispanic, Mexican) - We went out for 2 months and it was a joy, we always chatted and we made out some times too, she was a great person but one day I caught her cheating on me. She kissed a guy right in front of my face and I was so shocked, could not talk for a day. <br>  Old picture, this is what she looked like<br>  <a href="http://i468.photobucket.com/albums/rr49/IKnozWhoiz/fc_131136_600.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i468.photobucket.com/albums/rr49/...</a><br>  <br>  6. Jessie (White) - She was an easygoing person but I met her while I was exhausted at this party, We went out for 2 weeks, this is a pic of her<br>  <a href="http://i468.photobucket.com/albums/rr49/IKnozWhoiz/fc_131136_600.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i468.photobucket.com/albums/rr49/...</a><br>  <br>  7. Chyanne (Black and Korean mixed) - I dated this girl for over 8 months and I say I loved it. We had sex like 20 + times and I enjoyed every single moment of it. We always texted each other and helped each other out in class, lovely. Unfortunately on June 2008 I had to move out of Chicago, I miss her but she said "Sorry, this is for your own good, we need to go our separate ways Darrent". She blocked me from Myspace and IM, I wish I could still talk to her but oh well, my 18th birthday was at least a joy (it happened in August) thanks to my current GF.<br>  <br>  8. Melissa (White) - Girl I am with right now and I am almost done with my senior year of HS. I am going to Harvard probably for college or Cornell since it is closer to my current home in Upstate NY. Melissa is my current GF and hopefully my future wife someday.<br>  This is how she looks like<br>  <a href="http://i468.photobucket.com/albums/rr49/IKnozWhoiz/fc_152542_600.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i468.photobucket.com/albums/rr49/...</a>|`|jdKTs3aHaa	it's good =) I'm black and my boyfriend is Arabic.

I was kind of scared at the beginning of our relationship because his family is very conservative and I thought they would judge me. But they welcomed me with open arms and my family did the same with him.<br>  <br>  Personally I don't think it matters on the race as long as you love them<br>  <br>  :0)|`|ncdTxID9aa	It's fine by me.  I'm biracial, so it's natural for me to not care about race when dating or seeing other people date inter racially.

I don't think love should even put race in the equation.<br>  <br>  However, I do feel that many IR' s are made for the wrong reasons. To me, the fact that Black men/White women couples and White men/Asian women make up a disproportionally large amount of IR's, means  that something other than true love is at work in many interracial relationships.|`|66fMJo6raa	Girls I've dated-<br>  <br>  1.Mariah-Black;light skinned;was very controlling and manipulative<br>  2.Jessica-White;she was just not my type<br>  3.Sherri-Black;dark skinned;was ghetto and loud<br>  4.Sharon-White;we broke up because she wanted to date other people<br>  5.Carmen-Black;Light Skinned;we met in college and we've been happily married 4 years and have a baby girl|`|HimBbU6caa	I've dated plenty of women from many ethnic backgrounds.

Plus, mixed kids are some of the cutest kids! lol. But, really, that's no reason to reproduce with someone of another race, solely because you hope to have cute mixed children. xD When I hear "interracial relationship", like most Americans, I immediately think black guy/white girl. So, I often forget that I'm in an interracial relationship. I'm a white girl, and my boyfriend is a Japanese guy. He's maddeningly adorable too! I really never think about our difference in race/culture though, because we love each other, and that's all that matters.|`|cBNm64u4aa	i like it bcos  im mixed wit black and white<br>  but its sad bcos alot of black girls were mean, rude and jealous of me bcos i have long curly hair, light eyes, blonde highlights, and i mixed<br>  it is so sa how alot of black people r so racist of mulattos cos were bootyfull|`|ZtKzg1pCaa	it makes me happy that different races can see past their difference[color] and join their lives together. i mean color shouldn't even matter so why do we classify people by color?!!!|`|dDprsKZYaa	You mean outside of the Human Race?<br>  Other than that I don't get what being born in another country or having a different skin color matters at all.|`|VjyCjdHjaa	It's okay, as long as there is no interracial marriage.|`|mKbFvrecaa	How is it any different than regular dating?|`|BYnjh1EBaa	it's wrong. people should stick with their own kind.
1U8bg8zvaa	Those jocks must be checking him out in the restroom! They must really have an eye out for him. lol!|`|AA11984147	Honestly, you don't. Why would you want to know? What someone wears under their clothes is a personal issue I would think.<br>  <br>  The guys in your school seem to be people who are hurtful and careless about people's feelings. <br>  <br>  Please don't you be a part of it.  Be separate and sometimes, people have to stand alone. <br>  <br>  God is watching.|`|MJdUkar5aa	Well, a thong, where I come from, is a sort of rubber sandal thing you wear on your feet. In Queensland, they are used to throw at the giant sized cockroaches, while drinking beer and getting stoned. (The giant cockroaches are real). <br>  <br>  So I take it your guy is wearing the girly kind of thong? Well, he can wear whatever he fancies I guess. And so can the jocks. Maybe they will take to wearing these thongs themselves on a regular basis. The only known way to make sure is to slip your hand down the back of the waistband and if you find a little band there, yank it sharply. If the voice goes up an octave or so, it answers your question. Do have fun.|`|vYAgIMLdaa	How do i know when they are wearing a thong?<br>  There will be no visible panty line at the back and their package will be right upfront.|`|UojyaVglaa	those jocks sound like ***holes. why would you care if they are anyway? i think it's horrible to pick on someone just because they're different.|`|d7769329bd0a2936e9a45b35adc6db88aa	If they walk funny|`|3YLTBfzzaa	These jocks must be all of 3 years old.

iuoB7pf0aa	You could go to craigslist. <br>  <br>  I'm sorry you've had a lot of bad experiences with american women. Yes, american woman have acted like idiots since feminism started. Women act like men are total idiots and since feminism women act like men aren't needed. Women think they should be spoiled to death, and if you don't give them what they want they'll go get it from someone else. Sorry to tell you this, but not every woman is bad... it's just that there are too many sluts because of feminism, the media, and the way society tells women to behave. BUT!! You can't expect a woman to have a full time job and still be a good wife, a good lover, a good mother, a good housekeeper, a good cooker, and run errands,and be what a real woman should be. By the time their done with their work week they're dead tired. That's why feminists are so stupid! They think that they're keeping up with being a woman AND a full time worker but if they haven't noticed, families are falling apart!! And that's because women are too stupid to realize that divorce is because THEY are causing it by doing too much and thinking they CAN do it, they can't but after they realize they can't do it all it's already too late to undo the broken family. Sadly, these days women are stupid. You gotta find a good one, one that wants to treat you like a man, one that wants to put you first, one that wants to make sure you have what you need.....
O4jGlC2caa	1. If you go out to eat with friends, should you offer to pay, and should this be something you offer everytime?<br>  Nope.  In fact, I believe in separate bills.  It's called tough love.<br>  <br>  2. What would you say to people who basically excommunicated themselves with you for several years and are all of a sudden calling?<br>  Sorry, you are busy.  Can't talk.  Bye.<br>  <br>  3. How can you feel comfortable and explain to people how you've acquired the things you have?<br>  Just say you've been saving wisely to buy nice things.<br>  <br>  4. How can you let your guard down basically, like, when your thinking people are only hanging out with you because you have money and nice things?<br>  You can spot a fake.  People who are there for money will give hints that they are totally disinterested in what you have to say.<br>  <br>  5. For instance, say your in best-buy, and this clown you are with jokingly asks you if you would buy him a new laptop, what would you say back?<br>  "Haha... no... how about you buy me one?"  Follow with a giggle.<br>  <br>  6. People in which wouldn't ever even give you the time of day before are calling you and wanting to hang out...what should you say? I say yes, but don't let them take advantage of you...<br>  Ignore them.  Why be nice?  They wouldn't be nice to you.<br>  <br>  7. How do you make yourself feel better when you are constantly feeling used, and people keep saying "lighten up" but they have no clue what your going through?<br>  Don't understand the question.<br>  <br>  8. If someone asks for you to help with their rent, what would you say? Because you don't want to be the one who everyone comes to when people can't (or don't want to) pay their rent.<br>  Nope.  Rent is their responsibility, not mine.  They are a big boy/big girl.<br>  <br>  People won't know you have money if you don't flash it.  I figure if I ever win the lottery, I'll still keep my day job so people don't catch on that I fell into some good times.|`|O7SshRl6aa	First of all, congratulations!  What a relief to know you won't have to worry about money for a looooooong time.<br>  <br>  As for your "friends" who are basically begging from you, I guess I would do my best to avoid them.  They obviously are not true friends and are only trying to get stuff from you.  That's just wrong.  Advice on the old crush?  Tell him you are happily involved with someone else and not interested.  He's just as bad as the friend who are begging from you.  Only I have visions of him trying to convince you to marry him, then in a lot of states, that money is half his.  Avoid this guy like the plague.<br>  <br>  I hope you have hired a small team of experts to invest and protect your money (although that's a bit of an oxy-moron these days).  You sound like you have a level head on your shoulders and it would be great to ensure you have the life you want for as long as you can.<br>  <br>  I should buy a ticket one of these days!  Congrats again!|`|24cfb9540386b800bb43a544c412b806aa	Just to sum up, if I won the lottery, I would spend absolutely no time with anyone who is not around me now. If they don't have time for poor me, then rich me has no use for them. There would be no large gifts for "friends" and certainly no support like rent. Maybe a dinner here or there, but anybody who takes it for granted is cut off (even now I cut people off who take me for granted). <br>  I would certainly give a lot to charity (I'd keep my day job also, to throw off fortune hunters, then donate my entire salary), but that doesn't mean that everybody who shows up with their hand out is "charity."|`|AA12095766	You have my sympathy. Seriously. If I won the lottery, I would go hide somewhere and tell as few people as possible,  LOL!<br>  <br>  1. If you go out to eat with friends, should you offer to pay, and should this be something you offer everytime?<br>  <br>  Of course not.  You should offer to pay as often as you would before you won. <br>  <br>  2. What would you say to people who basically excommunicated themselves with you for several years and are all of a sudden calling?<br>  <br>  I would get caller ID and screen all my calls.  I do this anyway.  I don't feel obligated to answer the phone or door unless I feel like it.<br>  <br>  3. How can you feel comfortable and explain to people how you've acquired the things you have?<br>  <br>  That's a tough one.  It's nobody's business where you got your money, though..<br>  <br>  4. How can you let your guard down basically, like, when your thinking people are only hanging out with you because you have money and nice things?<br>  <br>  I think I would be extremely selective whom I spent my time with, and would take a "vacation" from socializing.<br>  <br>  5. For instance, say your in best-buy, and this clown you are with jokingly asks you if you would buy him a new laptop, what would you say back?<br>  <br>  I guess it would depend on who it was. <br>  <br>  6. People in which wouldn't ever even give you the time of day before are calling you and wanting to hang out...what should you say? I say yes, but don't let them take advantage of you...<br>  <br>  I think I might be so cold as to have a message made up for the machine that stated in the politest terms possible that I would not be "taking on new acquaintances" while I was making this lifestyle adjustment, and I think I would be a bit of a hermit for a while.<br>  <br>  7. How do you make yourself feel better when you are constantly feeling used, and people keep saying "lighten up" but they have no clue what your going through?<br>  <br>  Spend more time with your one true friend, and let her help you get through this.  I also don't think it is unreasonable to get therapy, because a change this drastic has got to be stressful, and you will need coping techniques.  From what I understand, winning the lottery has caused much heartache for many people.<br>  <br>  8. If someone asks for you to help with their rent, what would you say? Because you don't want to be the one who everyone comes to when people can't (or don't want to) pay their rent.<br>  And you also don't want to sound like an uncaring scrooge.<br>  <br>  I would do it once, maybe help them try to figure out a long term solution to their problem so it doesn't have to happen again.|`|cnyU6KXzaa	I would live my life as it were and invest a bunch into a charity, not give it to people who don't need it. If anyone had the nerve to beg for money after that, they are most likely Machiavellian and don't deserve it. I would spend/invest the money in stocks as well so people weren't waiting for a chance to jump in front of my car to sue me. As for that crush, tell him that it was bad timing and to come back in five years and see what he does, in case he is genuine.
eNR2iot8aa	It means that the person is straightedge. Which means the person doesn't do any drinking, drugs or sexual promiscuity.|`|hXQnR2Scaa	It marks people of questionable taste and low intelligence. IMO|`|38nZrac5aa	It is both for the identification of underage drinkers (it's hard to miss a big black x when the drinker raises his/her glass) and is a symbol used for   straightedge kids who choose not to use drugs or alcohol.|`|5N8PpI6haa	That last answer sounds right but I know I have gotten a black X put on my hand at clubs.

AA11984147	Ooh...I like your question.  If I were you, I'd email your mentor.  Reason?  You can ask for his/her help AND provide them with immediate information they will need in order to write the recommendation.  For example: I have students who want my recommendation for them to attend private or magnet schools for high school.  I always ask them to write a short note telling me who I am writing, what it's for and if I have to send the letter, provide the envelop and stamp.    In your case, make sure they know what you need and when your mentor completes the task - send him/her a nice "thank you" card or note.|`|wsQwfKn4aa	If you are close, email would be a little impersonal. If you don't hang out socially or anything, go for email.
WvWrlZkeaa	either she is bi or gay(lesbian)or maybe she just wonders what its like to be like that.etc does she have big breasts?maybe shes putting it in her own perspective and envies her..its sometimes normal.have a sit with her and be calm and relaxed.ask her to tell the truth unless she is uncomfortable if she is then do not force her.but anyways sit down with her somehwere where nobody is around and have a good friend related talk it should help if u can trust each other hope i helped(:|`|mIPX1dLOaa	She might be sexually confused. Especially in the teenage years, boys and girls fall into this stage. The best way to handle it is just to accept it, and if she talks to you about her feelings, listen to her, and if she comes out as being gay or bisexual, don't let that change the way you look at her.<br>  <br>  Just because a girl is lesbian, that doesn't mean she's attracted to every girl she sees, or a gay guy is attracted to all guys. <br>  <br>  You just should keep an open mind. And if it bothers you tremendously, carefully word what you plan on saying, you wouldn't want to lose a friend over something like that.|`|uvgXHrSYaa	i think shes trying to be open with the opposite sex but she maybe just wants to like wemon or something you know thats her really. She might stop later but probalby later. Idk whats gonna happen next.

Even if you can't be yourself  in front of people yet. The biggest thing you should start with is accepting yourself  before anyone comes first.  You fine Men attractive then that is that.  You have every right to feel that way :)<br>  All and all you should go with something that makes you happy. <br>  <br>  But if Attractive guys make you hot then I would say that is a happy feeling :)<br>  <br>   Happy thoughts warm wishes to you :)|`|Vu726Q18aa	*hugs* if you dont accept yourself how can others?

Dt06gcbIaa	If you'll forgive me, I'll reword your question slightly to what I think you're trying to say:  <br>  I think you're really asking "Why do certain militant Muslim extremist elements who appear to hate Britain want to live here?"<br>  <br>  I think the answer is, these extremists don't hate Britain, per se, but rather they hate anyone who does not share their views, believe it is acceptable to wage war over this point, and are prepared to use any country as a base of operations to wage this war on any front they feel appropriate.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately you're presupposing that they'd be prepared to live and let live under certain circumstances, but the truly militant extremist, regardless of their religion, believes their deity has justified unilateral and perpetual efforts to convert or slaughter.  These types will never "go back home or live and let live."<br>  <br>  I believe we should at least ponder the distinction between an extremist terrorist that kills because they believe they have the right to kill others, and a "guerrilla terrorist" that kills in an attempt to stop a perceived enemy from killing them first.<br>  I suspect there are both, so there may be more than one motive.<br>  <br>  By the way - I agree that Britain is one of the “most atheist” in the west... but I don’t know about atheist-founded.  <br>  People still say "Happy Christmas," use the term "Christian name" as synonymous with "first name," businesses have a bank holiday on Good Friday, etc etc.  <br>  The queen does, just about, have a "Church of England" to be head of.<br>  Atheist/ secular - perhaps - but still I think “founded” on western Christian concepts and traditions.  (Sorry – I’m a compulsive pedant.)|`|AA12133859	because they can do things they cant in their own country and they have rights they dont have in their own countries.  This Muslim cleric who has been called Osama's man in Britian and has been in jail forever in Britain and just recently got approval from the courts to be deported, had no problems using the democratic system he so despises to block his deportation.  He argued he couldnt be deported because he will be tortured in Jordan.   He is not leaving soon, now he gets to go to the European courts.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/feb/20/abu-qatada-jordan" rel="nofollow">http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/feb...</a>|`|UxlL89rHaa	atheist-founded country now thats a joke, I am Muslim, British and Proud. I think Some Muslims hate the people rather than the land, Its easy to see how a few people from abroad manipulate the young of this country, this does not represent Islam, it is all about politics but a religious reason gets them more support.|`|757ce30489e7f56556925d17f1f49f76aa	I dunno. Never met one who hates Britain.<br>  <br>  I don't hate Britain. I'm free to practise here. If I didn't wanna be here, i wouldn't stay here.|`|b0c58cc0b655a543b52a5ab7c8f62835aa	Nope, because they're invading Britain buy giving birth to their children here so after a century or 2 the Muslims would be the majority of England and the original British people in terms of bloodlines would simply disappear as they either moved country (a lot have done this already) or had children with Muslims meaning Muslims are in one sense the British people themselves.<br>  <br>  Also Muslims loves to damage the law systems of countries buy forcing their traditions upon it as a part of invading these countries.<br>  <br>  Majority of Muslims understands the laws and can follow them, but they know they can break the law in such large numbers that it would make the law they broke break and it would then become legal to break that certain law as much as they want as it's on longer illegal to do.|`|bloGqdBqaa	Of course, it's proof that islam doesn't work. Any muslim that chooses to live in a non-muslim country under the infidel is an example of this.<br>  They know it deep down and they are scared their god will punish them, hence they try to pretend they are persecuted in the name of islam. They believe this tricks their god.<br>  <br>  Look at Pakistan for example, created for muslim and looked what happened to that. Once of the most corrupt countries in the world! 170 girls schools bombed for giving girls an education. Once again, once islam really gets hold of an area the muslims themselves don't want to live there.

If Muhammed was alive today and perpetrated the same behavior today as he did when he was alive, Muhammed would probably have ended up like Saddam Hussein, or at least put in prison for life!    Bukhari Volume 5, 58,236:   Narrated Hisham's father:     Khadija died three years before the Prophet departed to Medina. He stayed there for two years or so and then he married 'Aisha when she was a girl of six years of age, and he consumed that marriage when she was nine years old.     Bukhari Volume 7, 62,64:   Narrated 'Aisha:     that the Prophet married her when she was six years old and he consummated his marriage when she was nine years old, and then she remained with him for nine years (i.e., till his death).|`|Qgtw2t23aa	omg. i wanted to read dat but didnt get the chance. but now i am going to borrow it out from my public library. thnx xxx|`|pzMsRJsjaa	no i have not read the book|`|ILc1XIPraa	I just bought it for my trip to india.

R9TobyWBaa	The reason for not trying to convert is that they scorn people not born and raised as Jews. Jewish attitudes towards the "goyim" range from cool disdain to vicious xenophobia and racism. Despite all their supposed tolerance towards others, they believe their religion is inerrant and in their own moral superiority over non-Jews.|`|celVUtGeaa	People are getting increasingly frustrated by the fact that people try to push their religions on them. Also if you push a religion on someone they wont truely believe in it and Judaism only wants dedicated people who actualy believe in their religion not a bunch of fools who are just going around saying they're Jewish because their mates told them it was cool because those people have about half an idea what the religions about and are destroying the sanctity of it.|`|rHGCfKc7aa	Not everyone is obsessed with trying to get every single person on this planet to believe the way you do.  Some people place higher values on tradition, and understanding.|`|CTM29j3Aaa	I think it's a good thing they don't try and get others to convert. <br>  <br>  And FYI: they do let all nationalities 'in' & Judaism is not a race.|`|Dt3AkTgmaa	I am grateful to anyone who doesn't proselytize.|`|QiBBgOA5aa	uhhh......<br>  you're stupid|`|lDEGaK7Laa	Because it's the nice thing to do. Jews realize that proselytization is rude and offensive to most people.<br>  <br>  And Jews are not, and never were, a race. Racial purity is something only Hitler was worried about.|`|vEEeq7kYaa	You post utterly false information about Jews while *asking* about Jews? Jewish identity is not and has never been defined by Jews according to RACE.  That is a concept born in antisemitism of 19th century Europe when ideas of "racial superiority and inferiority" of pseudo-scientific "intellectuals" was created and then later adopted and spread by the Nazis. <br>  People related to one another share genetic markers.  Jews began as a family, then as a small group of tribes and has remained tribal in nature.  However, Jews are NOT considered an ethnicity. There is simply NO single Jewish ethnicity. And Jews are not a race.<br>  <br>  Jews are a nation people, Israel (tribal origin) bound by an eternal covenant of the faith (religion) of Judaism. We are like a huge family and only the family can determine who is a member of it. It is the laws of Judaism, given to the covenant nation, Israel, in the Torah, that determine Jewish identity.  It is not a matter of “blood” but of self-determination through the laws of the Jewish people.<br>  <br>  The Jewish people are considered both a nation and a religion. Our connection is primarily one of faith (religion) through the covenant of Israel, yet membership is also conferred by birth, through matrilineal descent .One may also become a part of the nation Israel by adoption of the faith of Judaism and formal procedures of conversion.<br>  <br>  One who converts to Judaism is considered as FULLY Jewish as one born Jewish and their children are Jews. This has been the case since the times of the Torah.<br>  <br>  However one can be a Jew and not belong to both. One may technically be a Jew if their mother is a Jew, but apostate to the covenant of Israel and no longer considered a member of the nation if they leave it for the covenant of faith of another religion. <br>  <br>  We are Klal Yisrael, the community of Israel. . **MANY** different and distinctly Jewish cultures and ethnicities have developed over the millennia in Diaspora lands.  The Diaspora refers to the Jewish presence outside of Israel after the destruction of the First and Second Temple periods and the Bar Kochba revolt. <br>  <br>  There is no ONE Jewish ethnicity, but a great many ethnicities that are distinctly Jewish. There are the Mizrahi (from the Middle East and North Africa).The Sephardi (Spanish) and the Ashkenazi, (German, Polish, Russian and other Eastern European)that are all slightly different, even within those three designations as to cultural practices and foods, but it is the faith and covenant that binds them all together as Klal Yisrael. <br>  <br>  The Jewish nation began as a group of tribes and our connection to one another is still from the perspective of a tribal nation. (example:  as the Lakota nation has tribal procedure and law to determine who is a member of their tribe, who is not, who is expelled and who is adopted, so does Judaism)<br>  One born a member of the tribal covenant nation Israel (Jewish) may not be observant or even believe in God and they’re still a full member, a Jew. They may not be a good member or an active member but they’ve not renounced membership by following something ELSE instead of Judaism. An atheist or a secular Jew is not trying to call something ELSE Judaism. That is how one may be an "atheist Jew", they still may live Jewish ethics and identify with their people, but they did not take on foreign beliefs contradictory to monotheism or Torah<br>  Now if one born into the covenant becomes apostate to it through rejection of the covenant by adoption of another belief contradictory to the covenant, they are still be considered a Jew, but for all intents and purposes, they're not given the status of a member. According to Jewish law they're not counted in a minyan,( the minimum number of adults required for certain prayers and other mitzvot), they can't be buried in a Jewish cemetery, they cannot be given honors to go up to read Torah at a synagogue, and they may not be allowed to speak for the Jewish people. They CAN however, return without formal conversion should they so desire and then be embraced again as full members. One who has left the Jewish people for the foreign faith of another people must undergo the steps of TESHUVAH , which means repentance and return to the God of Israel. Some groups may require that the individual also requires immersion in the mikveh before being accepted back, but they do not require the formal steps of conversion should the person wish to return.<br>  <br>  <br>  Jews are in NO way a RACE..other than as members of the human race.It is Jewish law alone, not Christianity or any other entity that determines the status of who and what is Jewish. When a Jew adopts a belief that is in conflict with the Jewish religion, the belief does NOT become a " Jewish belief" just because a Jew chooses to believe in it. THAT is the conflict Jews have with the Christians who call themselves Jews if deceptively try to present their Christian belief AS Judaism. A Jew who converts to Hare Krishna is just as apostate, but there exists no Jews for Hare Krishna or Hare Krishna Judaism evangelic groups spending millions of dollars a year in campaigns to convert secular Jews by convincing them it is a form of Judaism. <br>  You can become a member of a tribe or nation if you meet the criteria of citizenship. And the covenant people, Klal Yisrael, remain as in the earliest days of the covenant..a nation. It hasn't changed.<br>  <br>  Reform Judaism ( of which I am a member) will consider as Jewish one whose father is a Jew IF the child was RAISED in Judaism actively and exclusively. Even in Reform Judaism, simply having a Jewish father without exclusively Jewish upbringing, would require conversion on the part of the person with only a Jewish father to become a Jew.<br>  <br>  It is against Jewish law for any Jew to discriminate against a convert to Judaism. Since the time of the Torah converts have been accepted as fully Jewish, and this is the case in all branches. We are not even supposed to refer to the fact that they are converts! It is up to them if they wish to identify themselves as such. They are Jews, period.<br>  <br>  The covenant people, Israel have been MULTIRACIAL since the days of Torah, Moses' wife, Zipporah was a black woman. There have been Ethiopian Beta Yisrael since the days of Solomon! And I repeat, one cannot convert to a race. One may convert and become fully Jewish.<br>  <br>  The Jewish Bible ( Tanakh ) tells from the beginning book to the end that the righteous of all nations ( Jew or Gentile ) have the capacity to connect directly to God, merit blessing and a place in the world to come.  Every human is equal before God according to the Jewish religion. Atonement is directly from God. Shalom<br>  With regard to Israel, Every nation people has a beginning, a homeland.  For the Jews, Israel is that land.  It is a part of the very identity of the covenant nation, our eternal tie to the land of our patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, and to our mothers, Sarah, Rivkah and Rachel.<br>  The modern state of Israel does not need to base it’s legitimacy on a belief of promise from God, even though many claim that is it’s only reason for legitimacy.  For centuries Jews worked to  reestablish the national homeland through legitimate means and the course of the development of the state of Israel certainly reflects this process.  The hard earned efforts of Israel to gain statehood, stand as a shining example of process of law, if people would study it, rather than the often so bizarre it borders on insane propaganda spread about it.  A study of the actual documents and recorded history would certainly invalidate the charges by extremist voices who would attempt to negate the right of the nation people, Israel to exist in the home LAND of Israel.  Why is it acceptable to hate the nation people Israel/Jews for wanting a homeland in our homeland of Eretz Yisrael? That is what Zionism is. It is not anything racist.<br>  It is no more racist to be Zionist than it is for any of the Muslim nations to have their own nation. In fact, because Israel is not a theocracy, it does not violate the UN Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, as do many Islamic nations that complain that Zionism is racist!  Why are the Jewish people excluded from the basic human right of self-determination afforded to all other peoples under the guidelines of the Declaration of Human Rights?<br>  It is no more racist than the idea of any nation/people to have a homeland. Any nation/entity should have the right of self-determination. The Palestinian nation (PLO) people who formed in the years after the state of Israel was established at the organizing of Gamal Abdul Nasser and Yasser Arafat and other Egyptian nationalists, have the right to their own nation, but not at the expense of another established nation. A state called Palestine COULD have existed already for 60 years if the surrounding Arab/Muslim nations had followed the example of Israel in establishing through legal means, a state that was in accordance with UN Charter rights. Instead, they chose to declare war on Israel and make permanent refugees of millions of their own who have now gone into a fourth and fifth generation of people who are nothing more than their political pawns to be used to justify elimination of Israel. Every time Jews in Israel and throughout the world have tried to help the Palestinians with establishing their own nation, it is met with attacks, assaults and escalation of rhetoric that it should not exist. <br>  Israel allows non-Jews full rights of citizenship, voting and other rights. Many other nations do not allow such things for Jews. Zionism is in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights that affirm the fundamental importance of the right of self-determination of all peoples,|`|38vza5Gxaa	answer: not sure where you've learned about Judaism but you're off target by a very wide mark. Mama P and Allon have given you Jewish answers, correct answers.<br>  <br>  There are Jews of all ethnic groups - Irish, Asian, Anglo-Saxon, Italian, etc.<br>  <br>  Why did you need to throw in the comment about the Middle East? It's not relevant to the question you pose.  Your veiled attack and accusation that Jews think they are superior fails.<br>  <br>  Jews don't try to convert everyone because, unlike Christians and Muslims, don't believe you have to be a member of their religion to reach G-d and many people find that extremely tolerant and refreshing.<br>  <br>  Mare Winningham - Anglo-Saxon heritage = Jew-By-Choice<br>  Sammy Davis Jr - African-American - JBC<br>  Elizabeth Taylor - Anglo Saxon heritage - JBC<br>  Ruth - Moabite woman - JBC<br>  Abram and Sarai - JBC<br>  <br>  just a handful from a long list going back to the founding of Judaism|`|rGEZup0Zaa	Judaism isn't a race, so no, that isn't why.<br>  <br>  I would think the last group of people on Earth to support the idea of "racial purity" would be the Jews. That was Hitler's ideology, not theirs.<br>  <br>  It's a religion; the fact that you can convert to it should tell you it's nothing more than that.<br>  <br>  They get praise for not trying to convert because they leave people alone.|`|2ogimlBxaa	I don't care about they're reasoning, they leave me alone.<br>  <br>  And I imagine they realize that trying to convert people is annoying.|`|AA11047076	We allow conversion and a convert is 100% Jewish.  Their is no Jewish race, their is no issue of racial purity since we are a religion, not a race<br>  <br>   The reality- we are forbidden from treating converts any differently to those born Jewish and they are as holy as anyone else in Israel. You want proof? Ruth, the great grandmother of King David was a convert, a Moabitess- and from her we will eventually have the Mashiach, our ultimate redeemer.<br>  <br>  So, whats the big deal? Why do Jews make it such a big deal to convert? Why the tradition of turning people away three times, hoping they won’t come back? You see- converting others isn’t just about them- it has implications to the person who does the conversion! Converting others to Judaism is actually a massive responsibility for the person who is doing the conversion- and an activity which can lead them to erring and sinning themselves! Why? There is a commandment “Do not place as tumbling block before the blind” Its easy enough to understand at a literal level, but at a deeper level it also means to not do something that will cause another person to err and thus be worse off than they were before.<br>  <br>  Where this comes into play is as follows: Everyone, regardless of religion, has a path to righteousness and a place in the world to come. For the non-Jews, if they behave in a manner that is in line with the 7 Noahide laws, then they will be righteous and merit a place in the world to come- for Jews, it is through the 613 commandments.<br>  <br>  So, coming back to the first point- what is easier, to follow 7 laws or 613 laws? Its a no brainer- 7 laws are much easier to follow. So, when we convert somebody, we are giving them an additional 606 laws that previously did not apply to them previously. Its not just a stumbling block- its a concrete barrier across the road! The person doing the conversion has to educate the convertee well enough that they will know enough about the laws to undertake to follow them, and know how to do so at a practical level- if they don’t, the person is going to err and thus the teacher is in violation of the commandment!<br>  <br>  So making sure someone is serious about conversion is imperative. Turning people away, testing their commitment through lengthy classes and immersion into Judaism; testing their desire, and commitment thus becomes an essential part of the process- ensuring their, and their future teachers, spiritual health. If the person is not serious, and the teacher has not tested them, the teacher is in violation of the commandment and, additionally, has caused another person to sin. If the person is serious- then it is a massive mitzvah to bring them into Judaism.

You are offended because you CHOOSE to be!|`|e58d7aa2292998ae82fe1b8e6639092faa	Well the hospital may have a strict policy on that.  I think it comes down to what was actually said, the choice of words may have not been appropriate.  Also was this the first time the nurse has had that kind of compliant is something to consider. Surely the gesture was intended to be compassionate but policy stands above all in a medical facility.|`|G4vFjh0yaa	As a Nurse it is our responsibility to make certain that the religous needs of the patient are met. If the Nurse was acting in a professional manner and not forcing prayer on the person then it is the right thing to do.  To pray over a patient that has not asked for or indicated through profile a desire is not acceptable.  Providing and making clergy available to a patient and family is an obligation in my opinion.  But it is not the right of a Nurse to place their religous values on a patient.|`|32e46f5365de97f08e8132dd292b1761aa	I think it depends how it was done, and if the patient wanted someone to pray for them or not.  I think it is a nice gesture, but then maybe it was not said in a nice way, or maybe it was inappropriate for that patient in some way.|`|o6MQWMo5aa	I can see why in some cases. I tend to belittle my health problems but if a nurse who understands that chart at the bottom of my bed offers to pray for me, I would wonder if she knows something I don't and get very depressed. I have a very basic code:- Doctors cure me, nurses tend me and I would prefer a passing priest or vicar to pray for me if I so requested, that way I don't read anything life threatening into it.|`|vOYyFqxRaa	This sounds awful but without really knowing the circumstances it is impossible to judge the situation. Do you have the article on this incident?  I am totally in favor of praying with and for anyone but if they prefer you don't then don't. I am brought to mind of the people that petal religion on the door step. Maybe the nurse was forcing them or maybe they felt like that was the only thing that could be done. I don't know the rest of the story.|`|9RvOhmY1aa	She should just do her prayer in her own time.  It is a nice gesture, but some people don't know how to accept gifts from others.|`|ZCh0OHuhaa	That's an odd investigation.

9mLjDa5kaa	Exhortation -- Pushing you to get you to do what you ought to be doing    Rebuke -- Correction about doctrine or activities in your life    A wise person is one that believes the Bible is 100% true and is the absolute Word of God.  So if the person believes that AND is rightly dividing it, then they are benefiting you by telling you what they tell you.      A wise person accepts the Biblical rebuke.  An unwise person despises it.|`|njxxUBjeaa	that stuff is in the bible!  but i dont know what it means =[ sorry|`|cAnha6sjaa	Exhortation is encouragement. Rebuke is criticism.

Sorry, now I have to go throw up.|`|61a1bb75a10bf426d979acfca18b8d63aa	An exhortation is a strong encouragement to do something. A rebuke is a disciplinary statement that something needs to change.

They can rip you a new one about sin in your life and feel like god wanted them to do it!  Clever huh?|`|AA11008046	To Exhort is a ministry in Scripture.  In this minstry one is encouraging another with scriptual factors to assist them in doing more for Christ.  exhotations are sometime mistaken for "word of wisdom" which is another type of ministry.  Check Romans 12:8  a rebuke in ministry is correction of ones actions and/or views.  A rebuke can also be a strong word of advise usually with God given foresight as your guide.  Prov 27:5 & 1 tim 5:2, 20 7 Jude 9|`|r8rykCkGaa	I felt that exhortation is a very strong teaching but not like someone failed but more like a prevention to keep them from failing because they will unless they pay attention, but a rebuke is more than a criticism.  It's acknowledging that the person did something bad that was at the point of grief in a sense.  We should listen to those who are wise or we will just be spoiled rebellious brats who go their own way without learning which results in bad character and hurting themselves and everyone around them.

You probably don't read much the Bible...<br>  <br>  God set up a flaming sword “moving back and forth” to protect the “Tree of Life” so no matter how much “free will” Adam and Eve may have had they couldn’t eat of it and live for ever. God also PREVENTED anybody from killing Cain. God could have done something similar to protect Eve!<br>  <br>  God personally intervened and PREVENTED that the Heathen King Abimelech had sex with Abraham’s sister/wife/hooker Sarah so he wouldn't “SIN against God"! God himself (NOT A GUARDIAN ANGEL, BUT GOD HIMSELF) was present in this King’s Bedroom to PREVENT a questionable sexual activity that King Abimelech might have enjoyed with Sarah! (BTW Abimelech means “my Dad is the God Moloch” not related to any Bible God) But neither the Bible God in all his bragging of “omnipresence” nor a Guardian Angel was anywhere to be seen near Eve or the untouchable fruit tree to prevent that the WHOLE HUMAN RACE that God loves so much go to be tormented for ever and ever in a sulfuric burning Lake of Fire! It doesn’t take too many neurons in anybody’s brain to figure out that the Bible writers were a bunch of wanking perverts creating a God so full of Holy Crap that some Christians are willing to kill to defend! Actually, it takes years of schooling to keep Christianity marketable today!<br>   <br>  Genesis 20:2-6 …and there Abraham said of his wife Sarah, "She is my sister."* (*incest [inbreeding] was ALLOWED, COMMANDED and ENFORCED all along by God’s Holy Law [Numbers 36:8]!) Then Abimelech king of Gerar sent for Sarah and took her. But God came to Abimelech IN A DREAM ONE NIGHT* (*only God knows how many nights he was already watching him perform in his royal bedroom!) and said to him, "You are as good as dead because of the woman you have taken; she is a married woman.”* (*It would have been perfectly OK with God if Sarah had no husband. God didn’t question on whether the king was a married man! God enjoyed watching King Abimelech perform sexual numbers! God declared King Solomon the wisest man “EVER TO SET FOOT ON THIS EARTH”, too maybe because he watched him perform in bed with over 1,000 wives and lovers! By the Time God in the person of the Holy Ghost had to visit the Blessed Virgin Mary in bed he KNEW A LOT about how to please mortal women!) Now Abimelech had not gone near her* (*at least that night, but he was aware that God was watching him perform all the time because of his lack of surprise!), so he said, "Lord, will you destroy an innocent nation?* (*God and this Heathen king discuss National Security issues in a dream!!! Too bad CNN or even FOX NEWS for that matter was not there to interview the king!) Did he not say to me, `She is my sister,' and didn't she also say, `He is my brother'?* (*can you imagine this holy man of God Abraham handing over his horny sister/wife Sarah without any objections for the unrestricted sexual pleasure of this Heathen king? BTW, Abraham already pimped his sister the same way before to the king of Egypt and he came out filthy rich out of it!) I HAVE DONE THIS WITH A CLEAR CONSCIENCE AND CLEAN HANDS."* (*It is just like EVE did, but sorry to say Sarah was a “sinful” sexy woman not an honest person like King Abimelech!) Then God said to him in the dream, "Yes, I know you did this with a CLEAR CONSCIENCE* (*as long as you do it with a clear conscience and clean hands you can’t possibly commit a sexual “sin” against this Bible God!), and so I have kept you from sinning against me. That is why I did not let you touch her.”* (*Hey, what if God would have applied the same protection on Eve, wouldn’t the world be different today? Christians tell you that this God was very apologetic preventing Sarah from enjoying having sex because she was going to be one of the ancestors of Jesus Christ! Practically all of Jesus’ ancestors were loaded of sexual escapades! It is all in the Bible scrip!) <br>   <br>  Compare the Bible writer’s sexual tryst story of King Abimelech and the Holy hooker Sarah to the story of King David and Bathsheba… King David and Bathsheba committed adultery of the kinkiest sort! She was a beautiful married woman. After Bathsheba was done having sex with King David she was probably drenched in royal sperm so she took a shower to "purify herself and be clean” (2 Sam 11:4). She became pregnant, too with a baby boy while God was delighted watching them perform in bed! No sin here because God planned for Bathsheba to be the ancestor of Jesus Christ through King David, not through her original husband! King David had to have Bathsheba’s husband killed for fear of reprisals! She was so happy to become King David’s favorite wife that she never grieved the death of her husband. God had their baby boy killed in a long and painful death so everybody in Israel can watch him suffer and learn a lesson!  The baby boy was born in adultery and had to be killed! Pregnancies as result of incest or rape are most sacred to the Christians today, but not so babies born in adultery to this Bible God… God hates them and he uses slow painful death tricks to get rid of children like that! <br>  <br>  Later on, Bathsheba mothered King Solomon another ancestor of Jesus Christ! Like in the case of King Abimelech this wanking God enjoyed watching King David performing in bed all along, but he didn’t do a thing to stop King David from having sex with Bathsheba. God didn’t stop King David from killing her husband, either because God loved King David, “a man patterned after God’s own heart”! So as long as you are a Christian you can get away with murder before God…! The only thing that you need to watch for is the secular authorities that can arrest you for questioning as a “person of interest”…!<br>  <br>  The Bible God didn’t hesitate to stop the Hell bound Pagan King Abimelech from having sex with Sarah so he won’t sin in spite of the fact that Sarah was a horny old lady age 90! Later on God didn’t stop King David from having sex with Bathsheba and killing her husband! In the case of a Heathen King God feels that sex is wrong and it has to be prevented, but with King David sex and murder is OK… it is all within “God’s plan of salvation.”<br>  <br>  In due course God was “pleased” to send his ONLY BEGOTTEN SON to be totally beaten, tenderized and thoroughly marinated in Roman soldier spit so he can be nailed to the Holy Cross as a “spotless lamb of God taking away the sins of the world”. Now Christians need to snack his spit flavored Meat and drink his Holy Blood in the Holy Communion so they can go to Heaven when they die. Jesus was terrified about dying on the Holy Cross that he was sweating blood praying “to pass the cup.” He must have asked his Sadistic Heavenly Father, “Hey Dad, wouldn’t have been much easier to stop Eve from eating the forbidden fruit?”<br>  <br>  Hardly any Christian reads the Bible objectively… and the few who do don’t last long as Christians unless they have no scruples. Most preachers tell you that the Bible doesn’t mean what it says and that it needs to be read in a “King James Version” or interpreted by specially schooled “men of God” full of the Holy Ghost (and BS)! Isn’t it ridiculous to live in a Country that chose to be a Nation under this peeping-tom GOD? Christianity is about the most dishonest big business in the world! <br>  <br>  A God that acts like that needs to see a shrink! Actually, God doesn't exist outside the Bible.

God hates idol-worship , because it blindens human eyes  in the name of spirituality . It is the Duty of God's people to help (practically) the poor and the needy ones when they are in needs and wants . If a Christian has a cup of milk ( and in order to show his loyalty for God ) he gives it to a poor baby who is crying of hunger and thirst or suffers from malnutrician . A Christian  will never think which side or which group  the baby belongs to . The baby may belong even to his enemy camp.     An idol-worshipper on the other hand ,just ignores the suffering baby ,( and in order to show his loyalty to God ), he walks steadily towards an idol and with all piety and devotion for God, he pours the milk upon the lifeless ,hungerless , thirstless and senseless idol and with great satisfaction he returns home . We must know one thing that in a nation like India , millions and millions of gallons of pure milk is poured upon many millions of idols daily in the name of piety and worship. Many things costlier than milk and ghee is wasted upon millions of idols daily ..    An idol- worshipper ,( of course , his religious teaching is such that he)  looks down upon the poor oppressed ,suppressed and the working class people ,which the Bible strictly forbids .   " Love your neighboutr as yourself " is Jesus' Teaching .    The idol-worshippers  never care for the poor and the needy people who suffer from cold , heat , hunger or thirst  . But they clothe the idols with costly, silky and gold embroided garments , gold and diomond crowns , swords , foot- wears , breast-plates , shileds , foot-rests , thrones ...jewels ,,, so on and so on .. But America (purely under Christinity ) helped one anoher in needs and thus have come up socially , economically and so on .It was the Bible Principles which enabled nations like   America to come up. An idol-worshipping nation will waste all its costly economic products upon the idols and send it to the gutters . But in nations like America such economical and food nutriants reach the stomuch of millions of chilren , and that is why the American children remain  healthier than  the children of the  idol-worshipping nations.    The Bible -God Who build up America has banned idol-worship.Hence it should not be in any way encouraged in America , of course whose founding fathers intented America to Praise and Worship the Bible -God .    The knowledge of the Bible keeps any people away from sinful and loveless deeds . But idol -worship brings all sorts of imoralities and abominations taught by their god's themseleves . Idol -worshippers stand always against human equality . They believe in oppressing and suppressing the poor and the needy working calss people saying they are sinners / sandals . To be frank , the Bible -God , the just God hates idol-worship. The LORD has strictly warned His people to keep themselves aloof from such abominations .    Christians know well how Gideon dealt with idols .  Of course Abraham was Separated by God from an Idol-worshipping people in the city of UR .    " ...They brought the sacred stone out of he temple of Baal and burnt it. They demolished the sacred stone of Baal and tore down the temple of Baal , and people have used it for a laterine to this day ."   ( Bibel : 2 Kings 10:26-27 )    Scientifically and literally , an idol-worshipping nation can never  Come Up. The idol-worshippers will never be bothering over the downfall  of a naiton .But they will continue to be selfish , self-interested and self -centered .They won't come up to banish things which remain a great hurdle for the naitons growth or upcoming . They totally remain incapable of calculating the great economical Loss of the nation due to their false   way of worship.    To honor God ,Christians spend their money upon the poor and the needy ones and try to bring them up.This is the secret of America's Growth .But such a knowledge is far off for an idol-worshipper. He wants to satisfy God by pouring  and throwing  costly properties upon the liveless idols and send it to the gutters and not to the stomuch of their fellow men .Surely any nation where idol-worship flourishes , will never come up. Poverty ,needwant ,inequality ,injusticce ,corruption and exploitation will flourish in any idol-worshiping nation .It is a very easlily understandable scientific  fact which an idol-worshipper can never understand .    Idol is unbiblical ,irrational and unjust .It promotes human oppression .It is totally against "Love your neigbour as yourself " policy . The idol-worshipper will honor and respect the lifeless idol the most ,and  dishonour and disrespect the fellow human beings  the  worst .Such ungodly and unkind practices will flourish in a nation where idol-worship flourishes . Idol-worship will lead a nation to her sooner down-fall . The more the idols flourish in a nation ,the greater downfall she will experience soon . This is what has begun in the American Ecomony also .Idol- worship will blunt and blinden human reason and thinking power. If America wants to flourish , she should not in any way encourage this irrational idol-worship. Or it is sure that America is going to slip down still deeper into the Econmical Pit .She won't be able to come up again. Many ungodly races will pounce upon America , strip off her garments , lay her down ;naked , gang-rape her and bury her away alive .Then Barbarism will rule the hard -found American soil.    Americans must come back strictly to the Bible -Culture . Or , the Muslim extremists are going to calculate America to be a nation of Satan ,and also they will feel it their Duty to destroy any nation of Satan . The more America becomes unbiblical , the more she will be suspected , hated , disturbed and be destroyed by the Muslim Ext
Dt3AkTgmaa	In the old days when most people were Pagan, many people raised their own food. Which meant that they slaughtered animals to feed themselves. So it was not such a big deal to slaughter a sheep or goat for a God. It was a way to offer something of value to God. It was food. It wasn't about cruelty. It wasn't any more cruel than what people did to feed themselves.<br>  <br>  The ancient Egyptians would offer the food to the God, then after the God had taken spiritual nourishment, the physical food would be divided among the people. So nothing was wasted.|`|NvOro0igaa	must be something in our brain stems that make us do that.  <br>  <br>  Here is one intersting theory about the Incas.  They cut the heart out of their victims because they misunderstood what the aliens were doing when they did open heart surgery to save people's lives (hey I didn't make it up, i read it, ok?)|`|WOBTw8jzaa	Its not true. God made the living and non-living things on Earth, and he doesn't want to kill them! It's like you creating a new animal or human and then just killing it when it didn't do anything!|`|wGlifxrzaa	This is your typical atheist question.|`|mYAbq6fnaa	well christians believe and in my opinion it is true and i believe it 100%, that there is only one god, which we read from the bible. idk what people are thinking that killing something gets them to heaven or whatever, because it doesnt. god says that the only thing we have to do is accept him into our lives, believe in him, and ask him to forgive us for our sins.|`|cr6VohxSaa	Wait a sec, don't we meat eaters sacrifice animals for our stomach?  Why is that okay, while sacrificing to a deity is not?<br>  Just food for thought!|`|sMLK4hDeaa	God required blood for the forgiveness of sins. It is just how God operated. <br>  <br>  The sacrifice was a lamb.....and it had to be unblemished.<br>  <br>  That is why you eat lamb on Easter.<br>  <br>  Because Jesus Christ was the lamb of God. He was the blood sacrifice, once and for all, for all sins! For all who would repent and believe.<br>  <br>  These sacrifices are no longer needed, because Jesus was the sacrifice....<br>  <br>  As prophesied by the prophet Isaiah hundreds of years before Jesus:<br>  <br>  Isaiah 53:2<br>         He grew up before him like a tender shoot,<br>         and like a root out of dry ground.<br>         He had no beauty or majesty to attract us to him,<br>         nothing in his appearance that we should desire him.<br>  <br>   3 He was despised and rejected by men,<br>         a man of sorrows, and familiar with suffering.<br>         Like one from whom men hide their faces<br>         he was despised, and we esteemed him not.<br>  <br>   4 Surely he took up our infirmities<br>         and carried our sorrows,<br>         yet we considered him stricken by God,<br>         smitten by him, and afflicted.<br>  <br>   5 But he was pierced for our transgressions,<br>         he was crushed for our iniquities;<br>         the punishment that brought us peace was upon him,<br>         and by his wounds we are healed.<br>  <br>   6 We all, like sheep, have gone astray,<br>         each of us has turned to his own way;<br>         and the LORD has laid on him<br>         the iniquity of us all.|`|QrBReRQbaa	Obviousily they are brainwashed.|`|JfoWgwhoaa	I've wondered that too. I mean, what makes them believe god would want the thing they sacrificed?|`|8Ff80pV5aa	I was kinda wondering the same thing
bxYWJAYNaa	That story cracks me up.    I mean, seriously, can you really imagine a bunch of angels trying to stage a coup-de-etat against Omnipotent God? They must have been brain-dead if they thought they could succeed, failing to grasp the meaning of the word omnipotent.    It sounds more like some ancient Israelite kingdom, with an unpopular king and a few unruly nobleman than the Kingdom of God in Heaven.|`|Xfhfz7wsaa	The story goes that Lucifer was Jealous; however, I was always taught that no such damaging emotions existed in Heaven and all knowledge of loved who may have gone to hell is wiped away because it will make u sad or angry... Very valid point! Asking anyone else i get the "Divine Plan" answer... Good question tho!|`|aGynBPbCaa	i thought it was because of this     "it was rather because he loved and adored God so deeply and intensely that he could not bring himself to bow before anything else, and because he refused to bow down to something that was of less superiority than him. (Since he was made of fire, and man from clay.) And it was for that that he was flung into Hell, condemned to exist there forever, apart from his love."    but that would make God a dick...    There are many different stories for one belief that no one can agree on.  Easier not to care.|`|2bfbda31517a40fd64c290f16464ec40aa	God created the earth and heavens in 6 days.  We as humans here on earth don't seem to be unsatisfied or completely unhappy with being here on earth as long as we have throughout time.   If God can do that in 6 days and He is putting thousands of years into heaven and the New Jerusalem, I wouldn't think there would even be a question to doubt happiness in heaven.   God's presence is so peaceful and fulfilling that you could get comfortable in His presence in a dumpster if need be.  It is not heaven but the presence of God that makes the ultimate difference.    Lucifer thought that He was better and more powerful than God and wanted to take the throne away from God.  He was the most beautiful angel in heaven, sat at the right side of the throne and became boastful about being better than God.   God showed him who was better and had the power because Lucifer was cast down to earth.   Lucifer wanted something to rule over and God let him and 1/3 of the angels rule the earth. He is mad because he failed,got kicked out and can't get back into heaven.  All he has to look forward to now is hell and he doesn't want to go by himself.  Maybe he is kicking himself in the butt for getting kicked out of heaven!!|`|CcHUacLPaa	Lucifer challenged God. Lucifer told God he could rule the affairs of Earth. So God is giving him a chance. This world is Satan's world. How is he doing so far?|`|8pS0oT4faa	because lucifer is a jack a$$|`|qjMP3EiGaa	You have no idea how close you are to unlocking the mystery of why we are all down here in human form.  And why some will go back to heaven, and most will not.  I am a born-again Christian, and I am totally unafraid of speaking of these mysteries, whose answers are cleverly tucked into the pages of God's Word for those willing to look, study, and dig for the treasure!  Most people cannot handle these truths, so few there be that will discuss them.  beware though, you sound suspicously like one of those who will not want to be God's presence in eternity.  Bad choice...but then, it really wasn't yours to make (yes, another mystery!)|`|AA11404315	satan was on his own sheet of music.............|`|oHrqbdydaa	How could anybody be happy in Christian heaven? It sounds like some sort of totalitarian kindergarten where you drool over God for eternity.|`|89MKzLl3aa	Lucifer is pure evil. But, evil won't be allowed in heaven.|`|aWcD7Ou5aa	He wasn't unhappy in Heaven, He wanted to rule Heaven.  He wasn't content being an Angel, he wanted to be God.  Heaven is a wonderful place, but it is not meant for the evil and that's what Satan was and is, evil.|`|AA10249608	Christians do not think about it ? We know why Satan rebelled ,the Angels serve man Satan thought he should be above us.|`|UH1ipgJmaa	Lucifer was not sad in Heaven but Jealous because the Lord loved us more than Angles like him|`|AA11276208	Lucifer thought he was as awesome as God.|`|QL0FOQMmaa	It wasn't satan's dissatisfaction or discontent with heaven that got him thrown out. It was his desire to be like God. He was full of pride and wanted to be worshiped. The angels that followed after him were deceived by him. He was the most beautiful angel God ever created. (Which may have contributed to his pride.)     But once God finalizes his plan of salvation, and creating a new heaven and a new earth, the author of sin, will be destroyed. Is it possible that someone else down the line could develop a sinful heart? Perhaps. But I am absolutely certain that God, knowing the beginning from the end, already has a plan in place for any of those possibilities.|`|b660102b2fc9513dd1125d9410450d92aa	I see your point on that one. Lucifer wasn't happy as an angel and wanted more.   Well since God had that homeland disaster, He has implemented new and improved protocols to keep that from happening again.  The real miracle in that is that it did not cost the American taxpayers a thing...LOL!|`|i48kxrbaaa	It wasn't because he was unhappy, it was because he wanted to take over God's leadership.    God gave him hell.|`|140b1c561177bc5cc3baf4ae5b15a6a8aa	Where do you get your information that Lucifer wasn't happy in heaven?  Scriptures simply tell us that Lucifer was lifted up in pride, and being cast OUT of heaven was the consequence of that.     Nowhere, nowhere, nowhere in the Bible does it say that Lucifer was unhappy in heaven.     Isaiah 14 describes Lucifer as being on a head-trip concerning his position under God's authority. Ultimately, flexing our muscles against God will result in severe consequences .    Once we get to heaven, we find there is no sadness, no more tears in heaven. Are you making plans to get there?  The alternative is with Lucifer.|`|GrqsnWtiaa	Lucifer was jealous, because God didn't include him in his plans so he rebelled heaven had nothing to do with it|`|AA11946554	Lucifer couldn't have been completely content if he wanted more. And, no...I seriously doubt one man's 'heaven' will be the same for everyone.  Assuming this deity existed (God-YHWH), he would have known what would happen...therefore, he created evil. (It's also in Isaiah 45:7)  But, 'Lucifer' was actually a 'code' name for Nebuchadnezzar-a Sumerian or Babylonian king...who tried to build some building higher than the Israeli temple of worship...there's a description of 'Lucifer' and it's all metaphor about that king.  You'll notice, the anti-God Satan character is not mentioned until the New Testament. There's a 'satan' in the Book of Job but the word 'satan' used means adversary..questioner. He's a human disliking angel/servant of God but he's working WITH God, not against him.|`|xBGEcPvCaa	show me were in scripture it says Lucifer left cus he wasnt happy    its funny how the ignorant post questions with zero biblical knowledge.|`|sHywpmaraa	yes.    i know i just blew your mind|`|hWuhsCxVaa	i don't know about you, but heaven sounds pretty boring to me.    that's why i'm going to Valhalla :)|`|3ea5199bfc214dd30a610b6a9a12f8e4aa	It wasn't because Lucifer was unhappy that He rebelled against God....It was that Lucifer didn't want to bow and give the same repect to humans as He gives God.  Lucifer thought He was better than humans in every sense and refused to bow and praise them as the creations of God.  Lucifer got some of his boys together that felt the same way and the war began....ulitmately resulting in the banishment of Lucifer and his cronies.  So you see it wasn't because he wasn't happy, it was the fact that He wanted to be better than Gods children.
WjRqYf6naa	Luke 1:36 cousin    ??  suggene?s  soong-ghen-ace'  From G4862 and G1085; a relative (by blood); by extension a fellow countryman: - cousin, kin (-sfolk, -sman).      Mark 6:3 brother    ???  adelphos  ad-el-fos'  From G1 (as a connective particle) and ?? delphus (the womb); a brother (literally or figuratively) near or remote (much like [H1]): - brother.      sisters    ??  adelphe?  ad-el-fay'  Feminine of G80; a sister (natural or ecclesiastical): - sister.|`|47sALOGfaa	Here's the answer you picked as best the last time you asked this very same question:    It's mainly the Roman Catholic church and her breakaway offshoot the Orthodox church who maintain that the brothers and sisters of Jesus were either cousins or Joseph's children from a previous marriage.    Why do they say this when there is nothing recorded in history or the New Testament about Joseph being previously married, and Greek is a very precise language with seperate distinct words for cousin, relative and sibling?    The reason is having combined Christianity with Roman Paganism and Greek Philosophy they needed a Biblical character that would satisfy the Pagan's desire for a Virgin Goddess to worship. They chose Joseph's wife, Mary and promoted her to "Queen of Heaven", but for this to be acceptable to all they needed to be able to say she was an eternal virgin and therefore they needed Mary's biological children to become either cousins or step-children, so they ignored the plain obvious meaning of the Greek and changed it to suit their doctrine.|`|tsgP2JfBaa	The word used in the Greek does not specify "cousin" but simply "blood kinsman or kinswoman."    And it's used there rather than "brother" because you wouldn't call Mary and Elizabeth brothers.    From the Hebrew, "cousin" is usually translated from a phrase, not a single word.  The phrase literally means "uncle's son" or "uncle's daughter."|`|AA11382947	Go back and learn the original texts.    These have been translated.    This is the very reason we need the Catholic Church, who better to tell us the original meaning of the texts than the Church that compiled them, and has been teaching and studying them for 2000 years?    Peace!|`|AA12203324	It's true, at least in Greek.    ??  (sungenis) "kinsman, blood relative" Luke 1:36    ?? (adelph) "sister"  Matthew 12:50    Adelphos is from "a" (connected to or by) and "delphus" (womb); and means a sibling (literally or FIGURATIVELY)     I think the argument was about Aramaic.|`|19922ecff123841b68f933197d10192baa	Because "cousin" referred to **DISTANT** relatives, back in those days.    It was the first generation cousins that were regarded as "brothers & sisters."|`|WQvqLnnhaa	You would have to go back to the Greek and see if the same word was used for both terms.|`|140b1c561177bc5cc3baf4ae5b15a6a8aa	People like to think that Mary was "ever virgin."    Compare your question to Matthew 12:46-49.    In the verses, Jesus is clearly speaking of those inside with Him, and His mother and family outside.     In all the verses, the use of "brethren" and "brother" are both translated from the Greek word "adelphos."|`|HMteUyRdaa	Isn't it funny how the translation has changed over time? Satan does work hard to confuse the masses doesn't he?    Brethren is the original word and it was the same through out all the Gospels until newly translated Bible additions changed it. You could try a Greek or Latin version to find the truth it is plain and simple.     Pray the Rosary|`|D6yEjfciaa	i don't know but this is what i think.like me i'm mexican america and in our family  we still use the term "primo armano"which means brother cousin,  which means 1st cousin.    when we talk about our 2nd cousin we just say 2nd cousin. but the thing is that we only use "primo armano" for the boys and never for the gilrs.   so maybe that has something to do with it.the fact that its a male gender thing.   so i think the answer you are looking for needs to be found under the languages section.|`|1cf043a3a9ab83f394dc727e4871340caa	It's basically the catholic church propping up their false doctrine of Mary never having sex with Joseph;    That Jesus had brothers and sisters resulting from a normal marriage relationship between Joseph and Mary is obvious from a simple reading of the scriptures.    First, in Matthew 1:25, the Bible states that Joseph "knew" Mary sexually after the birth of Jesus.    Then it goes on to state that Jesus had brothers and sisters in Matthew 13:56 and Mark 6:3.    The Catholic church tries to say that there is/was no word for "cousin" in the Greek, and so when Jesus's brothers and sisters are mentioned, that it REALLY means cousins. Isn't it odd then that the King James translators (scholars of Greek, Latin and Hebrew) translated the word cousin from the original  in reference to the relationship between Mary and Elisabeth?    Isn't it also interesting that when Jesus Himself specifically forbade His followers to call their leaders "Father", the the Catholic church persists in blatant disregard of this directive?    Matthew 23:9|`|AA10239241	Because you are obviously reading an English version of the verse.  According to the original Greek, "syggens" (??) means kinsman, someone related by blood. Patristic Greek had no word for cousin, sister-in-law, nephew, niece, etc.  A method of description called circumlocution was used instead:  See Acts 23:16 on that.  "So when the son of Pauls sister heard of their ambush, he went and entered the barracks and told Paul".    The son of Paul's sister clearly refers to a nephew -- but again, patristic Greek had no such term for this relationship.  That's why Jesus had many "brothers and sisters".  After the fall of the Byzantine Empire to the Turks in 1453, the Greek language made a huge shift to the modern Greek that is used today -- and so Greek does now have a word for cousin:  ??; first cousin is ?? ?? while second cousin is ?? ??.  Syggens (??) is now only used for the generic term of kinsman.|`|zPfgFXU5aa	The Roman Catholic Church has a theory that these brothers were actually Jesus cousins. However, in each instance, the specific Greek word for brother is used. While the word can refer to other relatives, its normal and literal meaning is a physical brother. There was a Greek word for cousin, and it was not used. Further, if they were Jesus cousins, why would they so often be described as being with Mary, Jesus mother? There is nothing in the context of His mother and brothers coming to see Him that even hints that they were anyone other than His literal, blood-related half-brothers.    An alternative Roman Catholic theory is that Jesus brothers and sisters were the children of Joseph from a previous marriage, before he married Mary. An entire theory of Joseph's being significantly older than Mary, having been previously married, having multiple children, and then being widowed before marrying Mary is invented. The problem with this is that there is no historical record of this and neither does the New Testament suggest that Joseph was married or had children before he married Mary. If Joseph had children before he married Mary, why are they not mentioned in Joseph and Marys trip to Bethlehem (Luke 2:4-7) or their trip to Egypt (Matthew 2:13-15) or their trip back to Nazareth (Matthew 2:20-23) and how could Jesus be Joseph's legal heir when that status is always held by the first born son, which in this case would have been one of Jesus' older brothers?? The bible on the other hand suggests Jesus is the first born son which means the other children came along later.|`|HBp5r76haa	They just find it difficult to accept that Jesus had brothers and sisters, Mary's and Joseph's children, therefore they have to make up excuses.    Of course the word cousin existed. And James, Jude and others were Jesus's half brothers

XZiABvdgaa	I'm not sure if the werewolf needs to be born on Dec. 24th, but it seems likely that the myth would have started here:    "It may seem surprising that werewolf superstitions would also be present around the Christmas holidays in Romania and Moldova. The practice of singing carols, or colinde, historically corresponded with the practice of dressing up as animals or masquerading as demons or other figures. It has been thought that werewolves or other were-beasts are more likely to appear on special holidays like Christmas, and the conception of a child on the eve of one of these holidays can lead to a were-child being born to the parent who did not abstain from sexual activity during the Advent fasting period. The singing of the colinde has been practiced over centuries and used to be, before the tightening policies on celebration by the Communist powers, a rigorously observed ritual that was planned and implemented by a group of young men who lived in the village. These colinde were often themed around hunts, animals that spoke, and the cult of the dead. Mysticism, folklore, superstition, and religion collide during this important season, which was, in pagan times, significant with rituals related to the solstice.*    *Senn, Harry, Romanian Werewolves: Seasons, Rituals, Cycles. Folklore, Vol. 93, No. 2. (1982), pp. 206-215."|`|soFJptgyaa	thats proper scary and i have never heared of it|`|AA10810835	This untrue, the person he posted the line on Wikipedia did not verify the citation, perhaps someone they knew was born on Christmas Eve, if not, you should know by now that Russian folklore is very extensive and full of lies, just like its politics, and the German tale was invented after Russians could even say that, meaning that either the Russians are selfish and want to be renown for the lore fact or the person who wrote it is a plain faced liar.  Anyway, the werewolf does target times around special occasions, that's a declaration in German folklore.|`|0Yj0my65aa	This Russian lore doesn`t exist.|`|Ou6adNVsaa	As far as I know, the 24th and 25th of December have the longest nights of the year. Some people even consider Christmas a pagan ceremony because the birth of Jesus brings light to those long nights. So its only reasonable for werewolves to be born on that night because its the longest night; and that lores should spring from that reason.

You could look at it from your point of view or you could ask yourself How is it fair to keep a murderer alive when that murderer took another's life?|`|SmFcDx4waa	we don't do it to show them its wrong - we do it so that there is no way they can kill again...also it costs much more $$$ to house a murderer than it does to just off him. Also it might be a deterrent to someone who is thinking of killing...they might not do it if they know they will get the death penalty...|`|AA11346438	a lot of us still believe in eye for an eye. hopefully we can eventually move beyond this way of thinking.|`|I2Hh3kRQaa	its called law and order
HJ9eOk37aa	The sky mirrors the unflagging heart,<br>  everyday showing a different colour.<br>  <br>  Becoming a smoke-like cloud shot with white<br>  hiding almost overflowing tears<br>  When trust is broken,<br>  I shut my eyes and pray<br>  <br>  Even on lonely sleepless night,<br>  with eyes shut in the darkness, I can hear the brilliance of the shining stars<br>  <br>  When I stop for a moment on this long lone journey<br>  the heart wavers and the days are wasted wandering around<br>  <br>  the strength to surrender this stained body  and<br>  the weakness of always looking for hope in the future<br>  With pride and a lofty gaze, a vow made<br>  Because I do not want to lose ...<br>  <br>  Because I can't give up, even barefooted, I will go on.<br>  I want to reach out and embrace this transience, like the moon in a clear sky.<br>  <br>  Fly far far away, like a migratory bird.<br>  Bring to you, tomorrow's wind.<br>  <br>  Even on lonely sleepless night,<br>  with eyes shut in the darkness, I can hear the brilliance of the shining stars
F3nlVXJ5aa	it is not your place to correct your sister, however if I were in your shoes my natural reaction would have been to do exactly as you did.  Next time tell your mother what occurred and tell her why you respond the way you do.  That very few things are yours, only yours, and in this case they weren't just cookies but were a present from a friend and that although you don't mind sharing, if asked, that you felt your little sister should have asked first and that you felt it was important that she learned etiquette so that she wouldn't do that to someone else and hurt peoples feelings.|`|O7SshRl6aa	I think your approach is mostly right.  But instead of "correcting" her, coach her.  Everyone needs guidance, especially little kids.  A kinder way of saying what you did might be, "Sally, those cookies were a gift to me from Jane.  While I think it is nice that you wanted to share the cookies with BIll, it's much more polite to let the person received the cookies decide how to share them."|`|UojyaVglaa	you need to let your mom handle the issue. she's the mother, not you. little sister's look up to their older siblings so if you want to teach her manner's and etiquette, lead by example. she'll learn from you that way. if you try to scold her or correct her she'll only resent you and behave more badly.|`|phznG0mnaa	Coming from a older brother with a sister and brother walk away from it . No matter what you say your always in the wrong|`|d13578e482d3857d77517c7fe7bebaedaa	I don't think you're doing any harm.  Maybe next time give her an example after you make your point. Like "You shouldn't give my cookies away because they're mine.  How would you feel if I gave your *whatever* away to my friends?",  and see how she responds to that.|`|tV1xFDWwaa	Maybe you could soften the tone up a little but what you did was absolutely correct. It's best if you remind her of these tiny details.<br>  :] She'll understand soon|`|RoqxGbgRaa	you should definitely correct her.  you're helping her to learn to be aware of other people, and to be conscious of their things and space.  this will make her relationships with people outside the family--who may be a little less forgiving of her slip-ups--as she gets older.<br>  <br>  it's easy to say that she's only seven, but she won't always be, and training starts early.|`|2BmGwbvYaa	Yes correct her, but do it so that she understands, and so that it doesn't sound mean.
58c1864fc2a8d2789667b87f88379138aa	Yeah i live in London and have seen gradual rot set in over my short life. This country is being suffocated by health and safety, political correctness and increasingly low standards and increasingly oppressive government. I agree with you about Health care yet the population seem willing to vote against it and vote Tory who have been undermining it for ages and it is being largely sidelined to being an accident service and increasingly rationed. What is increasingly making me think that Orwellian society is not that far of is the excessive amounts of government adverts, commercial adverts just want you to buy the products, these adverts are manipulating you to exercise, stop smoking,  wear seatbelt, don't speed.....in short be the perfect citizen. the blatant manipulation and disrespect for the individual is readily apparent. That the government chooses to spend it's people cash in this way and that people accept it really tells me that there is no values left in this country.|`|b0c58cc0b655a543b52a5ab7c8f62835aa	No and I live in England as well although like you I do like the health care although the one thing I hate about this country is how weak it is with immigration, because of that England is not England at all, one minute I go to Green Street and its fvcking Pakistan, other minute I'm in Canning Town and it's like some of the slums in America although I see the gangstas there as a load of wannabes of the gangstas in the American slums. <br>  <br>  Idiocracy, I saw that film recently, the slang and the retarded people make up for most of the population of America assumingly and the smart considered gay (or for guys at least).|`|HIav9sVuaa	i live in england i love living here and i love my country theres problems in every country you visit i think englands great for those of you who dont like it move|`|BtK9nSalaa	No. the U.S is too business, not enough culture<br>  but it's not my country so,,<br>  <br>  answer mine?<br>  <a href="http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AkikLROajuy3id_ML8_WqnETBgx.;_ylv=3?qid=20090218175427AA8r6Ur">http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|mPsNadNUaa	Yes i live in the usa but im sick of people talking about economic needs and OBAMA omg wow hes been out of the white house for like 1 week hes not doing his job!|`|XZTf8Eahaa	No i would like to live in the USA i live in ireland and its always raining and cold.|`|KFu7596Paa	england <br>  original one came out wrong i was tired sorry|`|u18GBKmiaa	yeah i live in england too i would never move but it has changed over the years massively|`|6dQzmsXuaa	I like Pakistan because it is a Muslim country, I born here, I grew up here, I have all my relations here and my all friends here also. <br>  I do forget the financial conditions here because it is not a rich country but It has a rich culture of Islam and brotherhood.<br>  It is fighting against terrorism and I am hopeful that it will won and finally it will be a great that I can hope.|`|pF3z9l5uaa	No. <br>  <br>  Welcome to America, while super-skinny people shovel down as much food as they can in as little time while over one million people are starving. <br>  <br>  Welcome to America, where White House officials rape 11yo girls and the media covers the shoes worn by the Crown Prince of Bhutan. <br>  <br>  Welcome to America, where it is is suddenly necessary to teach sex ed to 5yo. <br>  <br>  Welcome to America, where half of us are obese or overweight and a quarter of the other half are anorexic/bulimic.<br>  <br>  You getting the gist of it?<br>  <br>  ETA- Sdfdfs (did I get that right?)- I'm sorry, I got carried away. No need to call me a retard, and no I'm not going to say it was an "estimation" or an "exaggeration" because it was a rant and I was thinking more about how it seems like nobody's HEALTHY anymore. I wish I could leave buddy, but I'm 14. <br>  <br>  Oh, and it's an insult to retarded people to call un-retarded people retarded. And if anyone's "retarded" it's you.

I love my country Russia for many reasons.<br>  <br>  However I am distraught and disgusted at the racism, ignorance, homophobia, prejudice, anti-semitism and xenophobia here.|`|441GSyaMaa	I don't, but I'm patriotic, I like the fact that I'm british and take pride in it.. yet the country is so bad... not that I knew what it was like when it was good... but hey lol<br>  <br>  Do you? :-P|`|e5VUwaRsaa	No, I live in the U.S. <br>  <br>  I miss my home country (Australia) because it's so much warmer and prettier and laid back.
O7SshRl6aa	I sure don't want to sound like a negative Nellie, but he sounds kind of controlling.  His need for constant contact raises a red flag for me.  And his lack of attention to your needs raises a second.  I would not feel comfortable continuing to date this guy.|`|eRAT6u8Raa	i really dont think so at all sorry =/ its just that if he talks about his problems and not about yours it just shows he is kind of selfish i guess aint sure i dont know tha dude but thats what i think plus you guys are dating which makes you feel even worse that he shows no passion|`|d13578e482d3857d77517c7fe7bebaedaa	He's playin' ya.

Telling you that everything will be ok. I don't know if its love exactly, but he cares about you.|`|tjLbXhtEaa	If you have to ask the question... then you know the answer.Be assured he only want your pants off. He doesn't care about you on an emotional plane. He is selfish .. run baby run..|`|4m3z1ztEaa	or he is not sensitive type of person<br>  men and women need different things<br>  some women are not sensitive to men, yet can you say that they don't love their boyfriends?<br>  here is a simple test<br>  if all he wants is sex, he would want to have it with a beautiful girl<br>  so bring him to parties and other friend gatherings where beautiful girls are around, and give him the opportunity to cheat, and see what he does<br>  the thing is<br>  if a guy is going to cheat, he is going to cheat; even without the opportunity now, there will always be opportunity later. When the opportunity is present, he the will cheat off you<br>  but if he is loyal, he will be loyal to you no matter what<br>  either way benefits you<br>  if he cheats, find another guy and move on with your life<br>  if he does not cheat, it means he is loyal and you love him back

That is, unless someone brings them up in a conversation. As long as people are marrying solely for love, then I see nothing wrong it.<br>  <br>  However, I dislike the people whom are pro-interracial marriage. Sometimes militantly promoting interracial marriage can be just as bad as militantly promoting non-interracial marriages (or "anti-race mixing"), and unintentionally turns into a form of hypocrisy. Like I said, if individuals are to marry for anything other than love, then the marriage will most likely end in failure.|`|S6MqrWdjaa	??? this too shall pass....<br>  <br>   edit 2 biracial ppl in a relationship<br>  or an interracial relationship????<br>  either way its bound to happen in a  multiracial country it is to be expected...|`|AA10430184	What about them.<br>  If two people love each other then something like race should not matter.|`|DQZK3eKfaa	I love them!
