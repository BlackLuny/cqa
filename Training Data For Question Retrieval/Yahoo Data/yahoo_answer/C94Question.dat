Si el presidente Chavez cumple con su amenaza de cortar los envios de crudo a Estados Unidos, la primera victima seria su regimen sostiene el prestigioso periodico Washington Post. Resulta que la industria petrolera venezolana es dependiente de las capacidades de refinerias existentes en USA.   Si la administracion Bush realmente estuviera decidida a derrocar a Chavez,  la administracion podria ser tentada a declarar un boicott al pretroleo venezolano (por culpa de Chavez). Esto provocaria un pequeno pero facilmente reparable abollon en la economia de USA, pero devastaria a Venezuela ya que produce petroleo altamente sulfuroso y que en su mayor parte puede ser solo refinado en refinarias especiales de los Estados Unidos.   Opiniones...?

One base that was attacked was Marine Corps Air Station Kaneohe Bay which today is MCB Hawaii. There were huge firefights there from ground forces and many Zeros were shot down.      Other bases were also hit before the Pearl attack. So why then do they consider the attack a surprise? I know they must have had communications and they had to have those loud *** sirens that can be heard across to Pearl harbor from the other bases.      I was always raised thinking that the Japanese just totally caught Pearl Harbor asleep,  but ive come to learn this is not true as the attack came from the other side of the island first. Most Americans also do not know that several bases were bombed well before the Pearl Harbor attacks.      So was this a great sneak attack as we are taught or not?   And what were the names of the other bases out there that were attacked before Pearl?

20081107144833AA5WTAB	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Why do people have such a hard time with gun control laws?	It doesn't seem like anybody wants to nullify the 2nd amendment; that wont happen.      The gun control laws just want to ensure that:   A) We know who owns the guns and that they do not fall into the hands of criminals      B) that if a gun is deployed, we know whose it is      C) that nobody can walk into a store without ID and pay for a  gun with case (as in a criminal or a minor)      D) That nobody is walking around the streets with a concealed weapon      E) that any criminal who is incurs a very severe penalty      And while people have the right to protect their homes and family, that this is not the Wild West, and therefore there can be no potential for gun fights in the streets.      It seems like all the proposed gun control laws want to do is ensure that guns are possessed and used in a safe manner.  It doesn't seem like anyone wants to take them away.      Again, nullifying an amendment would be a hard sell, and I don't think it would happen.      It just seems that there should be precautions should be made that guns don't fall into the hands of criminals.      Maybe people believe that regualtion is the slippery slope towards banning them.  Is that the case?

20081022164911AA74pxg	Politics & Government;Elections	Is it true that after all the Republican rhetoric the Al-Qaeda is voting for McCain & Dislikes OBAMA?	I found this snippet in my email box.  It seems that Al-Qaeda feels that John McCain would be the BEST President to lead the USA down the path of ultimate destruction and that the Al-Qaeda REJECTED Senator Obama as THEIR presidential hopeful.  INTERESTING!  Here's a snippet and you can read the entire article in the link below.   After ALL this rhetoric from McCain about Obama being on the side of terrorists we get the WORD straight from the Camel's mouth ...errr ... I mean the Al-Qaeda themselves that 9 out of 10 terrorists would vote for JOHN McCain ... IF they could vote.  Maybe McCain will let them send in their write in votes as long as they pretend to be US troops overseas.  Better check all the votes coming from the troops in IRaq ,,, especially if they are PRO McCain.   V ---- This is part of the article ... the whole article is in the link below--V   The Web commentary was one of several posted by Taliban or al-Qaeda-allied groups in recent days that trumpeted the global financial crisis and predicted further decline for the United States and other Western powers. In language that was by turns mocking and ominous, the newest posting credited al-Qaeda with having lured Washington into a trap that had "exhausted its resources and bankrupted its economy." It further suggested that a terrorist strike might swing the election to McCain and guarantee an expansion of U.S. military commitments in the Islamic world.      "It will push the Americans deliberately to vote for McCain so that he takes revenge for them against al-Qaeda," said the posting, attributed to Muhammad Haafid, a longtime contributor to the password-protected site. "Al-Qaeda then will succeed in exhausting America."      It was unclear how closely the commentary reflected the views of al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, who has not issued a public statement since the spring. Some terrorism experts said the support for McCain could be mere bluster by a group that may have more to fear from a McCain presidency. In any event, the comments summarized what has emerged as a consensus view on extremist sites, said Adam Raisman, a senior analyst for the Site Intelligence Group, which monitors Islamist Web pages. Site provided translations of the comments to The Washington Post.      "The idea in the jihadist forums is that McCain would be a faithful 'son of Bush' -- someone they see as a jingoist and a war hawk," Raisman said. "They think that, to succeed in a war of attrition, they need a leader in Washington like McCain."      Islamist militants have generally had less to say about Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois. Leaders of the Iranian-backed group Hezbollah expressed a favorable view of Obama during the primary campaign but later rejected the Democrat after he delivered speeches expressing support for Israel.   -------------------------End of snippet ... entire link below -------------------------   Granted this is an article coming from the Washington Post and we all know that to be a left wing liberal paper but the truth is the truth whether it is reported by the right or the left, is it not?

20081118083432AA7HHE7	Politics & Government;Politics	Why doesn't the Dem congress do something about Bush undermining Obama's transistion?	Despite all of this potential lawlessness, the Democrats are either openly defending the administration or refusing to intervene. "There is only one president at a time," we hear from Barack Obama. That's true. But every sweetheart deal the lame-duck Bush administration makes threatens to hobble Obama's ability to make good on his promise of change. To cite just one example, that $140 billion in missing tax revenue is almost the same sum as Obama's renewable energy program. Obama owes it to the people who elected him to call this what it is: an attempt to undermine the electoral process by stealth.      Yes, there is only one president at a time, but that president needed the support of powerful Democrats, including Obama, to get the bailout passed. Now that it is clear that the Bush administration is violating the terms to which both parties agreed, the Democrats have not just the right but a grave responsibility to intervene forcefully.

It seems this election is about whether humans are cooperative or competitive by nature.       Republicans, I believe, think man is competitive and pure capitalism is the best system.

I personally think we are a combination of the two. What do y'all think?

Some black people are upset because some white people and black call him "multiracial" instead of a black man.      Ok so we should all call Obama Multiracial then....since that is what he is. What about "other"? That is what's on some of these questionnaires on job applications.      I mean, the argument is ridiculous because you don't call people like Hale Berry multiracial...you say she's black ( even though her mom is white). You don't call Miriah Carey black.....because she looks white ( even though she's biracial as well.      I point this out because, the bottom line is ( as much as some of us wish it could be this way) most Americans are multiracial. I mean my mom is black, my day is half black and half white. My grandmother is half Chinese and half black....and so on and so on.....            Exactly why can't he just be President Obama without his color being such a big factor to some of you?

Obama got lots of cheers at his rallies when he said he would get rid of missile defense because the technology does not work.      This is what a general said       ""What we have discovered is that a lot of the folks that have not been in this administration seem to be dated, in terms of the program," he said.

I am already a jumpmaster and want to get my master wings but if there is no one airborne in the Coast Guard then I won't be able to go that route.

20081008175710AAJHyvs	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	What can be done about cops that are out of control?	As some people may have heard, Massachusetts has done away with police details on small roadway construction sites as flagmen.  Needless to say, the police are outraged because they count on the money from the details.  But that money comes from the tax payers who can find better uses for it.  These police are making money hand over fist, double and triple what the troops are making in Iraq and Afghanistan, but the cops are the ones putting their lives on the line?  In the town of Woburn, MA the police protested the new flaggers, breaking the laws several times.  The police chief had to be called to the scene to calm the situation down.  But no actions were taken against the police (driving down the wrong side of the road, illegally stopping traffic).  Would this be the same if they were not police officers committing the offenses?  So my question is what can be done about these problems with the police?  Are we completely helpless?  Can I write my congressman about these concerns?

20081101064854AAh8JmO	Politics & Government;Elections	Why does Obama keep saying that he will have an opportunity to replace conservative justices on SCOTUS when..?	"in fact HE WON'T"      It appears unlikely that any of the other justices (Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Alito, Breyer, Kennedy, Scalia, and Thomas) would contemplate retirement before the 2012 election. The oldest of these six is Justice Scalia, at 71, but he shows no signs of slowing down, and surely is eager to pursue further the Court's rightward swing. Justice Anthony Kennedy, at 70, is the pivotal justice in almost every significant case - and seems to relish the enormous power associated with this role. The other Justices, too, have miles to go before they rest.

20081031053747AAIyeeK	Politics & Government;Elections	Our constitution won't be worth the paper it's written on ?	Obama has openly lamented that he feels the constitution is fundamentally flawed and is full of negative biases, he was disappointed that the Supreme court didn't address the issue of economic justice even though their job is clear to uphold constitution as written not liberally add to it to create new standards.    Obama says he wants to appoint justices that have empathy toward poor blacks, gay's, unwed mothers ect...and who would use that empathy to effect constitutional interpretation.      He has already shut down free speech against him,   He is very anti second amendment,   He would have a congress and media totally on his side as he brings back the ' free speech muffler ' the Fairness Act.   He want's a 250,000 member standing peace force stationed state side for use only here on our own soil.      Think about it, anything Un-American he would propose he would get away with because public outcry would be stiffled and any uprisings put down by this new young peace force he want's.   This is Marxist and socialist thinking and it will be the end of the last free democracy on the planet......      DON'T LET IT HAPPEN, AMERICA IS STILL THE LAND OF THE FREE FOR 4 MORE DAYS.

It doesn't WORK that way, guys! The representative for the Socialist party even commented that what Obama was suggesting was the furthest thing from Socialism that he could think of.   GO RESEARCH before you start slinging mud and jumping to conclusions. Find out what ACTUALLY was said by Obama, and I don't mean the sound bytes.   Take a look at the tax cuts W instated years ago - Obama would only be rolling those back. We are in a pit of bad economic policy, and all you making over a quarter of a million dollars a year are freaking out because you're going to have to pay what you used to so that our middle class can keep their homes.    Wow.   Joe the plumber, you're a greedy son of a *****.   Love they neighbor as thyself. Help your neighbor if you can, and the most effective way is cutting taxes to the people who can't afford to pay them anymore. That isn't their fault, and punishing the middle class is the way of a civilization's demise.    Why is this suddenly the evil and dreaded "Socialism"?

20081116140836AALXDfZ	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Is it illegal to shoot a dog with an airsoft gun in city limits?	About a week ago, I went outside to walk my dog, when my neighbor's dog started to attack. The dog wasn't on a leash, and it was in my yard. It attacked my dog, and when I got in between them it growled and showed it's teeth at me. A visitor of my neighbor was out on his steps just watching the whole incident, then about 20 seconds later my neighbor walked out and in a low and sarcastic voice said "No, stop, don't." Today, I let my dog out in the back yard, it's fenced off, the neighbors dog then tried to attack my dog through the fence. There is a leash law, but my neighbor has a lot of thuggish friends, if I call the police and have his dog picked up, I have no doubt that there will be trouble. I'm not afraid, I have more family and friends, and I can hold my own, but I'd rather there not be that kind of trouble where someone can be put in jail or worse. I don't think that my neighbor would be as mad if I shot the dog with a toy airsoft gun, than he would if I called the police. So if I shot his dog, on my family's property, but within city limits, just to get it to go away, could I be arrested or would my neighbor have any rights to sue?

And would taking the size of government down only give more power to fewer people, getting closer to what we were trying to get rid of by writing the Constitution.

20061231022802AAv7HOT	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Why come people can't drive their car fast on the road especially if no one's around to have a wreck?	I can understand speeding when other cars are around that's dangerous. However, if you're driving and there's no cars around you. You should be able to drive as fast as you want. It's your car and you paid for it, you should be able to drive as fast as you want. I hate police always giving tickets to people. Let them drive fast who cares.

Silvio Berlusconi, in tenuta casual, felpa e pantaloni blu, siede sotto un gazebo nel parco di Villa Certosa, la sua residenza estiva a Porto Rotondo, in Sardegna. Non è in compagnia di Veronica Lario né di mamma Rosa, ma di cinque giovani ragazze. Tre more, una castana, una rossa.  L’atmosfera è intima, l’ex premier fa accomodare due delle ospiti, le more, sulle sue ginocchia, abbracciandole con fare confidenziale. In un’altra foto si vedono Berlusconi e la signorina dai riccioli rossi passeggiare mano nella mano per i vialetti del parco. La coppia è poi raggiunta da una terza ragazza, anch’essa presa per mano dal Cavaliere. MA QUESTA VOLTA A VERONICA COSA GLI DICE?

Ex-boyfriend received judgement for half his original demand of $2800.00 that he charged on his credit card (I have to pay him $1400.00), however this amount was not from his pocket, it was a credit card charge.       He stated in court that he has not made any payments on the credit card, so could I send the check directly to the credit card account because the suit was for a "credit card transaction?"       Also- Now he claims to have "paid the card off completely" and wants me to send the check to him directly (but I know that this delinquent account has already ruined his credit, so he's not planning on paying it anyway) could I send the check to the credit company anyway and they could mail him a refund, if he really has paid off that account- which he has NOT.       He basically just wants the cash for his pocket- free money. He hasn't paid anything to this credit card, so he isn't out any money at all!!

Do you believe that it is the responsibility of government and your "right" to have everything you want by taking from those that worked for what they have? Do you believe that you should be bailed out when you make the wrong decisions? If so, you will probably vote for Sen. Obama in the upcoming election.       Did you work to pay for a new car for yourself and your family? Did you work and save and struggle to pay for your house? Did you go without the finer things in life for years so you could afford to send your kids to college? Did you work for years at a job you hated because it offerred reasonable pay and health benefits? Or, are you just starting out and are living that sacrifice right now so you can eventually give yourself and your family the good things? If so, you should be voting for John McCain in the upcoming election.      The ideas from Sen. Obama are a form of socialism. If you worked hard and "made it", he wants to take that away from you and give it to those that didn't work hard...and didn't make it.      I for one prefer that my "charitable" donations go to those people and organizations of my choice.....not to the government. I want the "right" to decide for myself who gets any extra money I might have. I refuse to allow government to make that choice for me.

20090226120844AAv562h	Politics & Government;Elections	Is this a summary of a Obama tax system?	I found this blurb on a blog and found it very interesting. Is this what Obama wants?      Our Tax System Explained:      Suppose that every day, ten men go out for beer and the bill for all ten comes to $100. If they paid their bill the way we pay our taxes, it would go something like this:      The first four men (the poorest) would pay nothing.   The fifth would pay $1.   The sixth would pay $3.   The seventh would pay $7.   The eighth would pay $12.   The ninth would pay $18.   The tenth man (the richest) would pay $59.      So, that’s what they decided to do.      The ten men drank in the bar every day and seemed quite happy with the arrangement, until one day, the owner threw them a curve. “Since you are all such good customers,” he said, “I’m going to reduce the cost of your   daily beer by $20.” Drinks for the ten now cost just $80.      The group still wanted to pay their bill the way we pay our taxes so the first four men were unaffected. They would still drink for free.      But what about the other six men - the paying customers? How could they divide the $20 windfall so that everyone would get his ‘fair share?’      They realized that $20 divided by six is $3.33. But if they   subtracted that from everybody’s share, then the fifth man and the sixth man would each end up being paid to drink his beer. So, the bar owner suggested that it   would be fair to reduce each man’s bill by roughly the same amount, and he proceeded to work out the amounts each should pay.      And so:   The fifth man, like the first four, now paid nothing (100% savings).   The sixth now paid $2 instead of $3 (33% savings).   The seventh now pay $5 instead of $7 (28% savings).   The eighth now paid $9 instead of $12 (25% savings).   The ninth now paid $14 instead of $18 (22% savings).   The tenth now paid $49 instead of $59 (16% savings).      Each of the six was better off than before. And the first four continued to drink for free. But once outside the restaurant, the men began to compare their savings.      “I only got a dollar out of the $20, “declared the sixth man. He pointed to the tenth man,” but he got $10!”      “Yeah, that’s right,” exclaimed the fifth man. “I only saved a dollar, too. It’s unfair that he got ten times more than I got”      “That’s true!!” shouted the seventh man. “Why should he get $10 back when I got only two? The wealthy get all the breaks!”      “Wait a minute,” yelled the first four men in unison. “We didn’t get anything at all. The system exploits the poor!”      The nine men surrounded the tenth and beat him up.      The next night the tenth man didn’t show up for drinks so the nine sat down and had beers without him. But when it came time to pay the bill, they discovered something important. They didn’t have enough money between all of them for even half of the bill!      And that, ladies and gentlemen, journalists and college professors, is how our tax system works. The people who pay the highest taxes get the most benefit from a tax reduction. Tax them too much, attack them for being wealthy, and they just may not show up anymore. In fact, they might start drinking overseas where the atmosphere is somewhat friendlier.

Did you know that, if Obama had been born outside the US, it wouldn't be enough for his mom to have been a US citizen?  His father needed to be either a US citizen or a US national that had lived at least one year in the US.  BO the first (Obama's dad) was neither. But, with McCain's citizen parents, he could have been born anywhere, even Iran.      The question: does anyone know what the requirement is to go to school in Indonesia?  I know that Indonesia is much more strict about non-citizen education than we are, but was BOII eligible for school in Indonesia simply because of his stepfather?      I'm not arguing the point that BOII is not eligible to be president, I just hope somebody can really clarify this curiosity question.

20081014081714AAUtb4k	Politics & Government;Elections	Why do Republicans blame ACORN for everything?	The mortgage crisis was not caused by ACORN.  The loans that ACORN pushed for were government backed FHA loans.  Sure, some defaulted, the vast vast vast majority of loans that defaulted were conventional loans through large banks.  ACORN backed loans only accounted for less than 1% of all defaulted loans.  Furthermore, those loans were government backed and secured.  The loans that caused this mess were not government backed.      For example, in my neighborhood of Northern Virginia, there are foreclosures everywhere.  Not a single one was done by ACORN.  How can you blame ACORN for this mess?      Furthermore, Do you get all your news from Sean Hannity and FOX?      Even more, why do you Republicans blame want to blame the poor for everything?  You blame them for the housing collapse, you blame them for the poor economy.  Why is the poor always to blame, or is it because the poor are black?
20081014073711AAHJCd7	Politics & Government;Elections	Republicans, What does your party stand for?	Please explain this to me.      Since George W. Bush became president, the Republican Party has presided over massive, out-of-control government spending, converted a federal budget surplus into a half-trillion-dollar deficit, and looked the other way while Wall Street's greed and stupidity turned the hallowed free market into scorched earth. Now the party has to watch as a Republican president orchestrates the biggest government intervention into the workings of the private sector since the New Deal.      Can any Republican candidate claim with a straight face to represent the party of small government? For that matter, can any Republican candidate plausibly explain what the party is supposed to stand for these days?

But when it comes to paying up, they are full of stories and false claims about "not covered" or "preexisting" or "it takes time" etc. I am fed up with all this nonsense, and if "it takes time" for them, well time is not free, since I am paying a hefty monthly fee. I just got some mail from my doctors stating that they did not get any payment from my insurance nor were they contacted in any way to verify the services rendered. when I call their customer service I get the usual run around and confusing talk about "things take time" and "still under consideration", etc. I am thinking of going to a lawyer to put some legal pressure on them.

My friend came out about 7 months ago to try to find a job and live with me.  He couldn't get his stuff together so he went back to where he came from in January. Before he left he didn't have enough money to cover his rent for December and January, and ended up owing me over $400 when he left the island.     Before he left however, I wrote up a contract saying he would pay me back such amount in such time, I signed it and he signed it.  I noted in the contract that if he did not pay it would result in legal actions.   So now his time is up and he didn't pay!!  This is so stupid to take to court because obviously he has to pay me, he signed a contract, and I don't know what he is thinking.  I don't know why he is being so dumb about this, but I now need to know who to contact and what to do?!   He was in the same state as me when this all occurred, now he is in Missouri.  Since the offense happened here in Maui, what do I do?   Any and all help is very much appreciated.

20081020072920AAY1FdO	Politics & Government;Elections	Who has more values, Obama or McCain?	Obama is a christian, who has never been divorced, and who has opposed the war in Iraq from the begining.  McCain had been married twice, he left his first wife, Carol, after she became disabled in a car accident.  Cindy, the woman who he is married to now is admitedly a former drug addict, and I've heard it been said that John used to give Cindy Carol's pain medicine to support her habbit.  McCain wants to continue the war in Iraq despite the fact that Iraq never possesed WMD's and the war was started based upon faulty intelligence.  Obama wants to make certain that single mothers are able to support their children.  Obama wants to make certain that all have the oppurtunity to go to college.  McCain uses the fact that he was a POW, Prisoner of War, as a stage for a qualification for president.  McCain's injuries to his arms were not sustained from being a prisoner, but rather from the plane crash that he had prior to becoming a POW.  When they captured him, they in fact treated him for his injuries, and he chose to continue to stay as a POW despite the fact that he admitedly recieved special treatment while he was in there.  If someone was truely being tortured, I think they would have left.  I mean, who among you, if I am pulling off your fingernails with plyers, and crushing your bones with hammers, and giving you regular shock treatments, and making cuts upon you in various places and rubbing salt in your wounds, and pouring honey on you and placing you by a mound of fire ants and offer to release you are going to choose to stay?  And further, if you do choose to stay, who would be mentally stable after such treatment?

I bought a wii, wii fit, xbox 360, ps3, nokia e71, paid my cable bill, tivo service for one year, and withdrew the rest in cash from the ATM.  The bank called me and said that it is rather suspicious behavior.  I explained to them it was my tax refund, but they want to know why i spent it so quickly, then withdrew the rest in cash.  I told them it is my money and I'm free to do as i wish with it.  I don't understand why they are acting like this.  Don't most people go on shopping sprees when they see 4 grand hit their bank account?  They want me to come into the bank.  I already stopped my paycheck from being direct deposited in case they try to hold that money hostage.

Then the janitor came and told me his son was inside working out and was not going to open the door for me since there was not a staff member in there to "view" the occupants. I asked why was his son was in there "unsupervised" and he told me that since he was his son he could be in there. I said, he can? Without a "staff member" in there? He told me that he knew he was in there. Anyway I waited to see if someone else would show up so I can get in and nobody did. about a half hour later the son came out with a friend and they locked the door and left. I was so pissed. I feel like going to the school and complaining. I signed a waiver before where if anything happened to me the school would not be liable. I live in a very small tow and there is not a gym anywhere close. I just want to work out. Now I know they dont have to let me in but I felt like was treated very unfairly.

He was a progressive, and He was judged and hated for it.      “Bleeding heart liberals” have long advocated for the homeless, the hungry, the less fortunate, and the disenfranchised. The women of America owe liberals a big thank you for their almost equal rights. “Tree hugging liberals” fight for clean air and water standards instead of favoring industrial polluters and short term profiteering that destroy God’s green earth.

I was working through a temp agency that had a separate payroll agency that they worked with.       My payroll account representative was extremely unresponsive and was frequently late with my pay checks. There was always confusion with my paychecks because there was never regularity to it.       A year and six months ago I was apparently overpaid by $400.00 and did not know it because I had thought the check was just late as usual.       After six or seven months of no longer working with the temp agency, the account rep contacted me to get the money back. I wrote her a letter stating:      I will require a letter in writing from your manager fully detailing the mistake made and the validity of the re-payment as stated in the codes of law under the State of California.      I received the two paychecks highlighting the overpayment but never received a letters of codes of law.        The account rep has been contacting me often and threatening to take me to court.       I am having trouble finding my rights regarding this issue.      Does anyone have any answers, advice, experience, thoughts??      I appreciate it very much.      Thank you,      Becky

20090226114421AAeqWjf	Politics & Government;Immigration	Immigration to the UK...?	Hello.      I was just sitting and wondering if it's easier for European Union Passport Holders and Nationals to Immigrate to the UK than Nationals from other parts in the world?      Is this because of the Treaties in the EU that allows free movement and employment within the Union, which parts of the world (Africa, Asia, South America, North America, Canada, Pacific Ocean) does not have?      Is it true that one of the major reasons that it is harder for other countries in the world to immigrate to the UK, is because "Place of Interest" (Whatever it's called) such like Iraq and Afghanistan and other Middle Eastern countries because of the wars?       And countries like Cuba and Brazil because of the drug smuggling? And their former dictators?      And Africa because of all the diseases such as AIDS/HIV, Meningitis, Malaria (Spelled?) is spread out in Africa?         Could you ever imagine China being in the EU?         This is all just a few questions that I have been thinking about.
20090226114804AAZJ1xb	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Do you think the President broke his oath of office?	On January 20th, and again on January 21st thanks to a flub the first time, Obama swore an oath that he would "to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States".  How can he hold true to this oath while at the same time spend probably millions of dollars tenaciously fighting any court case that would require him to do no more than release the long form version of his Hawaiian birth certificate?  This is a different document than what the President released during his campaign.  I am not doubting the authenticity of this document, this document does not guarantee that he was actually born in Hawaii.  Again, the only reason that the release of this information is being sought is so that it can be verified once and for all that Obama meets the very simple and minimum requirements to hold the office of president as established in section 1 of Article II of the constitution. The same constitution that President Obama just so happened to take an oath to protect and defend.  By hiding this information, isn't the President breaking his oath of office to protect and defend the United States Constitution?

Every winter my husband and I go south for a vacation. I have always wanted to bring home specimens for my home aquarium, but i know that the only way to do it legally is to get some sort of permit.

And before anyone goes off on me about reef conservation. I certainly do not intend to damage coals, or deplete the reefs. Im talking tiny frags, that i will care for and hopefully watch flourish in my tank. Once they reach appropriate size, i plan to sell frags from them to local reef aquarists, and LFS. There is literally 2 stores within 3 hrs drive of here that sell SW live stock, and there stock it quite limited in selection, quality and amount, not to mention grossly overpriced!! Actually my dream is to begin a coral aqua culturing farm. That way there is less pressure on reefs. Of course this is going to take time...

When they don't look at the relatives in the eye in the court, they are called cowards.      When the offender eyes the relatives the family leaves the court and asks how they can look at them.         It seems weird, back or front, eye-to-eye or not they are called cowards.

20090225110611AAv1Fvb	Politics & Government;Politics	Have you ever noticed that Obama supporters are incompetent at driving?	Every day on the way to and from work I observe them trying to drive their vehicles on public roads. How do I know they are Obama sheep? Simple -- I just have to note the collection of Obama related bumper stickers on their car ("Change", "Hope", "Obama",  )      Observation #1:      Obama sheep do not understand that a turn signal should be used to ...well SIGNAL! Some of them will actually turn it on, but not until they have actually started their turn. Others will continue down the road at the posted speed limit, then cram on their brakes, coming to a complete stop and then turn on their signal. But most O-sheep don't even use the signal at all.      Observation #2:      O-sheep rarely drive the speed limit. I actually witnessed one entering an Interstate on-ramp going 25 mph (despite not having a car in front of him for several thousand feet). As a result, all the poor people behind him (including me) were forced to dangerously enter the freeway at hazardous slow speeds. It was entertaining to see an 18-wheeler almost hit the nut as he had no merging skills either, but seriously O-sheep should just turn in their licenses and their cars. Obama doesn't want to lose his supporters this way.      Observation #3      O-sheep will ALWAYS begin braking for a stop light so long as said stop light is red and within their sight. They don't understand they are 1,000+ feet away and that they need to arrive in the vicinity of the stop light to trigger a sensor to cause it to turn green. I suppose when you barely graduate high school and don't pursue college they don't learn about the world and how it works :( Sadly, I wish the DMV drivers test would catch such incompetencies.      Observation #4      Although O-sheep are often found driving tiny "green" cars like a Prius (I won't even mention the vast amount of pollution those cars require in their production and disposal costs), the O-sheep feel the need to pretend they are driving a tractor trailer -- for example, if they intend to make a left turn, they feel they must first turn sharply right, swooping into the right line traffic and then over-correct to complete their left turn. They haven't quite grasped the concept of staying in their lane.      I'll post some more observations later as I want to eat my lunch. What have you noticed about O-Sheep? Personally, I think they should just stick to public transport.         PS. My wife just read my question and she suggested that it may not be the Obama-ness that is causing people to drive so poorly, but more simply that it is a reflection of the concern that person has for others. She points out that good drivers tend to be concerned for others in real life and that leads to them sharing the road and being mindful of other drivers on the road.

I'm gonna use satire to explain my point....why the mortgage bail out plan will not work as intended.      You see... Hawaii ended Universal Health Care for Children (after only 7 months in existence) because citizens were dumping their private plans for a government subsidized one (i.e. because it was free)..      my point?      so this mortgage bailout is only supposed to help the 8% percent who can't pay their mortgages..,      Well why don't I just declare that I can't pay my mortgage either (by being shady) and have the government pay for portions of my mortgage too...(even though I can pay for it). I mean it's free money      So this 8% now becomes 15% and then to 20%....and then to 25%...because you know people mainly Liberals will take advantage of this and lie to the Federal Government that they can't pay their mortgages. It is already being crafted by many...      oh you don't think people are not capable of deceiving their incomes to the feds....      So just like Hawaii the Federal government will figure out quickly that it cannot sustain this...         and this is another example of an Unintended Consequence of Liberal Policies....cause Liberals are truly One Dimensional Thinkers.      I'm gonna suck the taxpayers dry  (sarcasm)

20090226121652AA5WyCe	Politics & Government;Government	OK, Obama wants to be responsible. When's he going to take the responsibility?	This is straight off the Yahoo site-      WASHINGTON – Pledging "a new era of responsibility," President Barack Obama unveiled a multi-trillion-dollar spending plan Thursday that would boost taxes on the wealthy, curtail Medicare, lay the groundwork for universal health care and leave a string of deficits dwarfing any in the nation's history.      In addition to sending Congress his $3.55 trillion budget plan for 2010, Obama proposed more immediate changes that would push spending to $3.94 trillion in the current year. That would result in a record deficit Obama projects will hit $1.75 trillion, reflecting the massive spending being undertaken to battle a severe recession and the worst financial crisis in seven decades.      As part of the effort to end the crisis, the administration proposes boosting the deficit by an additional $250 billion this year, enough to support as much as $750 billion in increased spending under the government's rescue program for banks and other financial institutions. That would more than double the $700 billion bank bailout passed by Congress last October.      In his budget message, Obama sought to draw a clear distinction with the Bush administration, saying "the time has come to usher in a new era — a new era of responsibility" both in government and the private sector.      When is he doing to take responsibility for lowering the deficit? He asked for the second half of the TARP funds before he even got into office. Once in he asked for a "stimulus" package that authorized another $787 Billion. Now the last time I tried to do math $350B (1/2 of TARP) and $787 B added up to $1.137B. He could have reduced the deficit he's going to face by saying to Congress figure out ways to fix things that don't cost so much.      The Congressional Budget Office estimates if Obama had done nothing by 2012 the deficit would be down 70%.      That's OUR money they are spending. And they are lawyers. If I have a tooth ache I'll go to a dentist. If I have a car with a bad transmission I'll go to a mechanic. Are we that stupid we think lawyers are going to come up with solutions to business and economic problems?

Roland Burris is a federal tax deadbeat who landed a $75,000-a-year state job under former Gov. Rod Blagojevich five months ago, the Chicago Sun-Times has learned.      Blagojevich's administration hired Roland W. Burris II as a senior counsel for the state's housing authority Sept. 10 -- about six weeks after the Internal Revenue Service slapped a $34,163 tax lien on Burris II and three weeks after a mortgage company filed a foreclosure suit on his South Side house.      A spokeswoman for the Illinois Housing Development Authority indicated Wednesday there was nothing improper about Burris II's employment by the agency, whose mission includes overseeing mortgage programs for low-income home buyers and anti-foreclosure initiatives.      Burris II's hiring, however, raises more questions about Sen. Burris' interactions with Blagojevich and his inner circle at a time when the governor was soliciting Sen. Burris for campaign contributions and Burris was angling to have Blagojevich appoint him to the Senate seat once held by President Obama.

On my 21st birthday (February 24) I went to dinner at a restaurant in DC with my friends and family and ordered a glass of wine. When the server looked at my ID, he consulted his manager and they told me that they could not legally serve me alcohol until midnight (at which time it would technically be February 25, the day after my birthday). In addition to being humiliated, I believe he was wrong. I have never heard of anyone having to wait until the day AFTER their 21st birthday to drink alcohol.    PS I looked online and all I could find was some info about a cinderella bill in Texas which said that people had to wait until 7 am on the day of their birthday to drink... but nothing saying people could not drink on their 21st birthdays and have to wait until the day after. I also checked the DC code and could not find anything about the actual date.

20090226125757AA5FPtn	Politics & Government;Immigration	How could this happen? Quick, launch an investigation! This must not be allowed to stand right?	Oh, the open-borders crowd’s heads are exploding.      Under President Obama and DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano’s watch, federal immigration agents had the nerve to — gasp! — enforce immigration laws.      How could this happen? Quick, launch an investigation! This must not be allowed to stand!      Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano on Wednesday ordered a review of a raid at an engine plant in Washington State that resulted in the arrests of 28 people suspected of being illegal immigrants.      A high-level official in the Department of Homeland Security said that Ms. Napolitano had not been informed about the raid on Tuesday before it happened, and that she was seeking details about its planning and scope.      “She was not happy about it because it’s inconsistent with her position, and the president’s position on these matters,” said the official, who agreed to discuss the matter on condition of anonymity because the secretary had not authorized the conversation.   You can be sure the taxpayer-funded National Council of Raza will use all the earmark money it will be receiving to lobby aggressively for comprehensive shamnesty:      The National Council of La Raza urged supporters to call the White House and demand Mr. Obama lay out his immigration policy, while the National Immigration Forum said the raid was an unwelcome continuation of Bush administration policies.      “What are Latino and immigrant voters to think? They turn out in massive numbers and vote for change and yet ‘change we can believe in’ turns out to be ‘business as usual,’ ” said Ali Noorani, executive director of the forum.      He called for a halt to the raids while Homeland Security conducts its review of immigration policies.   As for the poor, innocent workers nabbed in the raid, guess what? The raid was the result of a gang investigation:      “Information derived from two gang members previously arrested in an ICE gang operation led to the initiation of the work-site investigation at Yamato Engine Specialists,” said press secretary Kelly Nantel. “Follow-up investigation uncovered a potentially large number of illegally employed workers. ICE conducted the operation in order to identify and if appropriate, apprehend any unauthorized workers and to further determine potential criminal activity.”   Homeland Security officials worried about gang and criminal activity?      This must not stand!

To prove he is eligible to be president. Two active duties soldiers both serving in Iraq (one is a commissioned officer) have joined a suit.      Why has obama never produced the real birth certificate showing which hospital he was delivered in? Was he maybe actually born in kenya? There seems to be enough questions that he needs to come clean with all the documents. The point of active duty soldiers coming forward and joining the suit is that they are sworn to uphold the constitution so it is assumed they would have standing in the court, unlike other unsuccessful attempts to get courts to require obamas birth certificate to be produced.

Barack should cut down on the Iraqis and put some more money back into our schools, or something that will help America in the future.

We are trying to sell. He is now 4 months behind and just not making the payments. My attorney says I can hold him in default of the decree. He would be ordered to pay or get fined or jailed. My question. Will it help my credit? Will it help me at all? Or will this cause a bigger problem than what I want?

With Cigarette and Alcohol taxes being one of the highest revenue sources for the Federal Government and ‘No taxation without representation’ where are our representatives?  We collectively pay an enormous portion of the taxes in this country yet where are our reps, the tobacco corporation lobbyists? Yeah right they do not represent smokers they rep their shareholders.  Obama said “Not One Dime” more in taxes would be paid by lower middle class.  Well my cigs and beer just went up nearly 10 dimes over night, AGAIN.  And I do not get Fed Health CARE, so I do not want to hear that argument.  What about your Big-Mac?  Let’s tax that too.
