4TZsKgAUaa	Translation follows:<br>  <br>  You traitorous citizens, who disturb the peace.  You people who dishonor your weapons by killing your neighbor.  Why can't you listen?  HEY!  You people are like animals!  Your muscles bulge with anger, and you seek only power.  Put down your weapons for good, or you will be tortured for your crimes.  Listen to me, I am your prince, and I will pronounce my sentence!<br>  <br>  Three times you have let words cause you to fight amongst yourselves.  And the blame is on both of you, patriarchs of the Montagues and Capulets.  Three times you have disturbed our streets with your violence!  You have forced our peaceful citizens to choose sides!  They have thrown out their beliefs and brought back hatred into their hearts out of fear.  You have poisoned our peace with your hate!<br>  <br>  If I hear about this again, you will both be killed, because we cannot have peace with you two fighting.<br>  <br>  Old man Capulet, and you too, Montague;  You are both coming with me.  We will go to Freetown, where judgment has been made in the past, and will be made now as well.  Of course, as usual, everyone listens, when their lives are threatened.<br>  <br>  End translation.<br>  <br>  He is lecturing them on gang warfare in their city.  He is explaining that when things get this bad, everyone has to choose sides to protect themselves from violence, and he is saying it will no longer be tolerated.  He directly blames the fathers of the families for the violence and explains that they are fighting over something stupid.  He says they will die for their crimes if they are caught again, and that they will now face a judgment for the good of the people.<br>  <br>  I expect you to use this wisely.  Use your own words, and learn what you are told to learn.  Shakespeare has a lot of valuable things to say about the world today.  Those who are ignorant of the past are doomed to repeat it.<br>  <br>  Do not dishonor yourself by cheating.  Read this, and study it.  Use your own words to explain it once you understand it.

X6rFPI2laa	You generally start your sentence with your overall goal, and then finish the sentence with the three major activities to achieve the goal.  An example might be something like "The goal of the public health department is to improve the health status of county citizens by reduction of incidence of disease, by proper nutrition, and by improvement in sanitary conditions."  One goal -- three activities.  I've written a lot of these, and if they are generally agreed to they can be helpful reference points.  Otherwise, they are just so much stuff that is ignored.  Good luck!

f225326bcf00f7734680a1c78941fabbaa	Usually the best way to help you study is taking the class itself. For my calc AP exam, I only bought a study book about 1-2 months before the exam. This might not seem like sufficient amount of time, but the test is in May so I've been taking the class since September. I did the same for my other AP classes and received 5's on all of them.<br>  <br>  If you want to know how the test will be like, collegeboard posts all the previous years exams on their website with the answers. This is the best way to see how the actual exam is and how much you need to study.

EuMtcP33aa	Nobody knows for sure the origin of the term "hot rod." <br>  <br>  Hot rods are typically American cars with large engines modified for linear speed. <br>  One explanation is that the term is a contraction of "hot roadster," meaning a roadster that was modified for speed. Open roadsters were the cars of choice to modify because they were light. Hot Rod may also refer to the connecting rods, cam, or pushrods inside the engine or to the exposed frame rails of such an automobile. It has also been noted that burning out the connecting rod bearings was a very common failure mode for souped up four-cylinder Fords, particularly the Model T, and "hot rod" could refer to that phenomenon. It was adopted in the 1930s or 1940s as the name of a car that had been "hopped up" by modifying the engine in various ways to achieve higher performance.<br>  <br>  The term can also apply to other items that are "souped up" for a particular purpose, such as "hot-rodded amplifier".|`|ckxpknr0aa	Erm..... what is the exact meaning of "egsact"?!?

If you are taking the SAT after 2 months, then I suggest getting a SAT book / privite tutor depending on you budget. If you have less then two months, I would go over the math section specifically and learn how to solve problems that you don't know. Reading and writing are mostly applying knowledge, but the trick to math is that you usually have to know how to solve the problem before applying it.<br>   <br>  btw, if you have extra time, I warn you not to check your problems and instead work on some other problem: remember this isn't a mmath or english test; you don't have time to check your work and change answers, you only lose a fraction of a point if you get it wrong so it's better to go on another problem for a whole point! <br>  good luck!

pVMUSUEBaa	1. Material wealth, like gold, does not guarantee happiness and the pursuit of it brings conflict and even death. Tons of examples in the book.<br>  <br>  2.

People succeed or fail often by luck, not by hard work or merit.<br>  <br>  But the moral is probably that you just can't tell.

09rf8Hrfaa	Hi <br>  <br>  Dawes Act or General Allotment Act,1887, passed by the U.S. Congress to provide for the granting of landholdings (allotments, usually 160 acres/65 hectares) to individual Native Americans, replacing communal tribal holdings. Sponsored by U.S. Senator H. L. Dawes, the aim of the act was to absorb tribe members into the larger national society. Allotments could be sold after a statutory period (25 years), and “surplus” land not allotted was opened to settlers. Within decades following the passage of the act the vast majority of what had been tribal land in the West was in white hands.<br>  <br>  The act also established a trust fund to collect and distribute proceeds from oil, mineral, timber, and grazing leases on Native American lands. The failure of the Bureau of Indian Affairs to manage this trust fund properly led to legislation and lawsuits in the 1990s and early 2000s to force the government to properly account for the revenues collected.|`|xfqHi1tRaa	Another effort to screw the Native Americans.<br>  More here:<br>  <a href="http://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/fed-indian-policy/" rel="nofollow">http://www.archives.gov/education/lesson...</a>

5sdLN7vLaa	This is a common source of confusion in English. <br>  <br>  Fortunately, there's an easy way to decide whether to use I or me in such sentences. All you have to do is drop the word you then try the sentence with I and me one at a time. For example: <br>  <br>  I should have lunch. <br>  Me should have lunch. <br>  Clearly the preferred form in this case is I; thus, it is correct to use you and I. <br>  <br>  Here's another example: He'll blame you and I. Drop the word you then try the sentence with I and me one at a time, like so: <br>  <br>  He'll blame I. <br>  He'll blame me. <br>  You can see that the second of these is correct.

They all are computer literate, and being remote, have quite a lot of equipment and ability and connections from their pasts.

You will not have to worry about it, the student loans company inform HM revenue, and it will be them on behalf of your employer who will deal with re-payment. Paying back your loan is just like an additonal tax on wages each month. You will also be able to make additional payments - how you do this will all be explained when you apply for the loan (you'll get a nice glossy booklet explaining everything about your loan)<br>  <br>  The students loans company do not monitor your bank account, thus if money is going in your bank account fromm other sources this is irrelevant. The student loans company only take your bank account details so they can deposit your loan in your bank account. The money you are awarded will not be given to you all at one - it is given in installments over the duration of your course.|`|93mUETz7aa	Yes and no!  There could be fees in regards to actually taking out a loan with that particular company. Make sure your looking at the APR % and how long the loan is going to be taken out for.

Ask all the questions you want, your going to be the one paying this back over time<br>  GOOD LUCK!!|`|7deb425958c53615415ce326bcbf08e0aa	If you tick maximum you will have the maximum credited to your bank account.

Well, she hired me, so she had her moments of lucidity.  However, she spent a lot of time hiding in her office instead of supervising the faculty or even observing us.<br>  <br>  I used to have a job that didn't challenge me.  I discovered that the more I did, the faster the day went.  I cleaned the coffee pot, bagged up the waste from the shredder, and kept my desk and files insanely tidy.  I volunteered for projects.  If you can go around your boss, get work from other departments to keep you occupied.  I learned quite a bit about making cold sales calls while I was there, helping a co-worker refine his list of cold leads.  He had more than he had time to follow-up, and I had more time than tasks.  It worked out for both of us.  Among the things I learned was that I don't have the temperament for cold call sales jobs.<br>  <br>  It might be the boss's fault that he is not supervising you to keep you productive, but it is not his fault if you don't show some initiative and learn all you can about any aspect of the business, product, or market while you are there.  It may be a step in the ladder to something different, but you never know when those skills might come in handy.<br>  <br>  Many years later when I was teaching, I needed to get some parents to enroll students for a special project.  I knew the basic techniques for cold calls, and got pretty good response to our calling effort, mostly by teaching someone else what I knew and letting her do it more effectively than I would have.<br>  <br>  Your boss may be a moron, but you don't have to follow that lead.

im8xN545aa	There's a neuronal connection between the tear duct and the areas of the human brain involved with emotion, when we cry the body goes through physical or chemical changes. So when we get upset a response to that is triggered in the brain that causes us to cry.<br>  <br>  I also did a google search and found this, it's quite interesting:<br>  <br>  "But crying is a more complicated process than one would at first imagine. First of all, there are really three different types of tears. Basal tears keep our eyes lubricated constantly. Reflex tears are produced when our eyes get irritated, like with onions or when something gets into our eyes. The third kind of tear is produced when the body reacts emotionally to something. Each type of tear contains different amounts of chemical proteins and hormones. Scientists have discovered that the emotional tears contain higher levels of manganese and the hormone prolactin, and this contributes in a reduction of both of these in the body; thus helping to keep depression away. Many people have found that crying actually calms them after being upset, and this is in part due to the chemicals and hormones that are released in the tears."|`|FtTx6cLdaa	onions|`|DNX9M6nAaa	okay women have a body self imagen promble usally and that can make us cry. if you cant apretiate your baody that could make you cry alone. i have had a hard time looking in the mirror and when i did it wasnt what i wanted to see but i have learned that i am the way i am for a reason and if i cant accept myself then no one could accept me.|`|frdLMK5laa	Onions

mmD4MEnGaa	As the role of technology in our lives steadily increases, one has to wonder the AFFECT that it will have on today's students. Although, we could not imagine life without cell phones, it is important to realize that owning one can have negative effects on our lives. Cell phone use with students can cause detrimental affects on etiquette, lead to addiction, may tend to portray a superficial communication and social gap and can cause serious accidents while driving. The use of cell phones can be very disruptive to others around us and can be perceived as improper behavior in many situations.<br>  "You're at a four-way intersection, trying to make a left, when your best friend calls you. Obviously, it must be important since SHE IS texting you. Looking down at your phone's screen you laugh while reading the message and take your foot off the brake. Your car drifts into the opposing lane, just as oncoming traffic is speeding by." A DISASTER waiting to happen? You bet. That is just one example of the many accidents that can occur while DRIVING AND texting or talking on a cell phone. Studies have shown that driving while talking on a cell phone is as bad as drinking and driving. Why? When you’re talking on A cell phone OR TEXTING, this requires the driver to take their attention off of the road, even if it is only for a matter of seconds.<br>  <br>  -------------<br>  when something is bad you say "affect"<br>  when something is just being effected, like special effects you say "effect"<br>  <br>  and in essays, avoid doing things like "it's", or "she's" . it's better to use the proper stuff like "it is", or "she is"<br>  <br>  you missed out a few things, i added them in. you also misspelled one word. most of the word corrections i put in capitals

ayMYfxcfaa	When a quadratic function is in the form <br>  <br>  y = a(x + h)^2 - k ,<br>  <br>  this is called vertex form or sometimes standard form (depends on who you're talking to but doesn't make a difference really).<br>  <br>  Many of your questions are involving this form of a quadratic function.  Recall that the point (h, k) is the vertex of your parabola.  The y value (in this case, k) is either the minimum of the parabola, if the parabola "opens" up, or the maximum of the parabola, if the parabola "opens" down.<br>  <br>  The value of "a" determines if your graph "opens" up or down.  A negative value will open down, and a positive value opens up.  The value of "a" will also be a measure of how fat or skinny the parabola is.  You can calculate a if you know the vertex and one other point in the graph.  Substitute h and k from the vertex (h, k) and substitute x and y from the other point (x, y) into your equation, and solve for a.<br>  <br>  If the parabola passes through the origin then the point (0, 0) is on the graph.  Since the x value of the origin is 0, it is also the y-intercept.  Since the y value of the origin is 0, it is also an x-intercept.  <br>  <br>  The x value of the vertex (in this case, h) is also the axis of symmetry.  If you know the x value of the vertex, then you also know the axis of symmetry and vice versa.  The equation of the axis of symmetry is of the form <br>  <br>  x = h .<br>  <br>  The x-intercepts are the x values of the points on the graph where the y value is zero.  The coordinates of the x-intercepts, also called the zeros or the roots, are identifiable as having the form (x, 0).  A quadratic may have 2 roots, 1 root, or no roots.  It is possible to calculate the roots by substituting 0 for y in your equation and solving.  This may involve the Quadratic Formula or factoring or graphing, but it will typically be easiest to solve by completing the square, since the square is already completed for you.  Simply solve for x.<br>  <br>  The y-intercept is the value of y when x is equal to 0.  To calculate the y-intercept, substitute 0 for x and solve for y.  All quadratic equations have exactly one y-intercept.

AxkYUq56aa	The Rower Who Rowed Christopher Columbus Ashore<br>  <br>  <br>  "Just a little bit further, fratelli," the burly rower hissed at Chris, who attempted his best sage nod, even though it nearly caused him to fall over into the clear waters of what he assumed to be India.<br>  "Hmmmmm....not bad for a poor woolweaver's son from the lower eastside."<br>  "The lower..."<br>  "Lower eastside of Italy, son.  You better recognize!"<br>  The rower referred to his charts.  "Let's see...turn right at Blindman's Bluff, left at the Blue Lagoon, and straight on till morning!"<br>  "How do you even have charts for an uncharted land?" Chris retorted.<br>  "I gave it to him," a native islander popped up from underneath their supply of bialies.  A little known fact about Columbus is that he was crazy for kosher food.<br>  "Oh, wow, a sultry Indian," Chris smiled.  "Yo ho ho!"<br>  "Don't yo ho ho me, now, matey...I'm busy," the rower retorted.<br>  "I was talking to this ravishing young Indian beauty in front of me," Chris re-retorted.<br>  "Lucky for you, I know Italian," the native islander said.  "But you clearly don't know what a proper Indian looks like."<br>  "Huh?"<br>  "You clearly approached this land in the belief that you've circumnavigated the globe, but your far-fetched scheme seems to have backfired."<br>  "My far-fetched scheme seems to have backfired?"<br>  "COPYCAT!  COPYCAT!" the rower sing-songed.<br>  Chris rubbed his head, feeling a headache coming on.  "Where the hell did I put my dramamine?"<br>  "You don't need Western medicine..." the islander began, pausing to acknowledge the dramatic irony of her statement, "well, here, we have these weird things in the water."  She pulled out an ugly looking, wriggling monstrosity from the sea, and slapped it onto Chris' head.  A glazed look of relief came into his eyes.<br>  "You'll want to pull that thing off soon," the islander said.  "The life cycle of the sheelpliver fluke involves spontaneous combustion."<br>  The rower sighed, "we've made it!  We're on land!  Land ho!"<br>  "Let's go back, immediately," Chris suddenly shouted.<br>  "WHAT?  MY ARMS!!!!" the rower screamed.<br>  "We have what we came for!  A beautiful Indian babe!"<br>  "My name is Pam," the islander derided.<br>  "We will bring her back with us against her will, as proof of our illustrious adventures!" Chris yelled.<br>  "WHAT an impractical, moronic idea...I LOVE IT!!!" the rower rubbed his calloused hands together.<br>  "Sorry, buddy, but I'm just not that into you," Pam stuck out her tongue.  "Besides, the moon is messing with my cycle."<br>  "The lunar eclipse has nothing to do with my feelings for you, babe," Chris winked.<br>  "I'm sorry, Chris, but I find your imperial dogma to be a turn off.  I'm only into jerks who ride motorcycles, not domineering explorers from Europe."  Pam jumped into the crystal clear waters of "India," and disappeared.<br>  "What should we do now, sir?" the rower asked.<br>  "Row, you idiot.  We'll find some other form of proof.

Isabella just told me the bank's closed!"   "I've got my own money, Danforth.  Millions of dollars even if we're in a depression, recession, regression, whatever you want to name it.  I did really well in the real estate biz when that market was booming and I cashed my stocks in when they were at their highest.  Plus, I am highly paid, you know," smiled Chris.  "I'm taking aboard all good men, but 10. The Santa Maria has no room for losers."  3. "Hmmmm....Not bad for a poor woolweaver's son from the lower eastside," Danforth the town crier (some called him a liar,a coward, and possibly effeminate) woefully and jealously yelled back so all could hear.Danforth fumed inside his corpse-like body about his own inability to steal from Chris.<br>  <br>   "Yo, ho, ho, you are taking me?" Danforth inquired.  1. "Don't 'yo ho ho' me, now, matey.... I'm busy," Chris sneered. 2. "Let's see.....Turn right at Blindman's Bluff,left at the Blue Lagoon and the Atlantic Ocean.  Yes, that should get me there.  Snicksnack!  I have to do this entire job alone.  But once I get there, I'll be even richer!  More $$$$$$$$$ and alllll for me!" Chris sang out joyfully.  5. "COPYCAT! COPYCAT!" snivelled Danforth as he swiped some drool from his alzheimered chin.  Just then the first mate, Sunshine, strode by in his rubber boots and rain gear.  "Stop drooling, Danforth, and go take some dramamine.  Maybe it'll put you to sleep , hopefully for good,and you'll stop that drooling,"  the gnarly foul smelling Sunshine chided him.  6. "Where the hell did I put my Dramamine?"panicked Danforth.  "Alzheimer's..that's why you can't come along, Danforth!" Chris reminded him for the 10th time in as many minutes.  "You could take me along and I can entertain you with my boring stories, amateur and crummy pictures and stoopid asinine magic acts," Danforth pleaded with a tear in his cruddy eye.  8. Sunshine looked Danforth in the eye, both men clearly and deeply in love, and said, "Chris, WHAT an impractical,moronic idea..... I LOVE IT!!!!!  Take him along."  "Hmmm, Sunshine, have you lost your brain, too?" questioned  Chris.  "Babe, I love you!" cooed Danforth to Sunshine,"Let's get married.  It's a lunar eclipse."  "Okay, Danforth, but remember this. The lunar eclipse  has nothing to do with my feelings for you,babe.  It's just that I've been abducted by aliens and after all their experiments..you know," added Sunshine with a sickly toothless grin on his face.  "You know what? We're taking off without either one of you cuckoos. 7.   Go contemplate the life cycle of the sheepliver fluke!" yelled Chris as he and his crew left the shoreline.<br>  <br>  Danforth and Sunshine embraced on a rock as the ships sailed out of sight. Danforth said, "I guess since California passed proposition 8, a trip to the new world is a waste anyways.

There’s a whole world out there waiting for you to discover.  And you just sit here inside these four walls with quill and paper.  Look Chris, forget about the waterfall.  Just put some land over at the edge instead. Since you are using India Ink, we’ll call it India. No one’s going to travel that far.  It won’t matter what you put there. Then we can get out of here.”<br>  <br>  “WHAT AN IMPRACTICAL, MORONIC IDEA.... I LOVE IT!!!!!” said Chris.<br>  <br>  Paulo, sketched in some islands and took a look at his work. “HMMMMM.... NOT BAD FOR A POOR WOOLWEAVER’S SON FROM THE LOWER EASTIDE  Now, let’s go down to the docks.  I’ve got a beautiful, passionate woman there waiting for us.”<br>  <br>  “Paulo!! I didn’t think you were into a manage a trois. I think I remember how to get to the docks...LET'S SEE.....TURN RIGHT AT BLINDMAN'S  BLUFF, LEFT AT THE BLUE LAGOON AND then go past the Jolly Roger.” If we can stop at each inn for a pint along the way I'll have enough nerve for it myself.”<br>  <br>  By the time the two would be sailors arrived at the docks, they were staggering.  Paulo went up to the Santa Maria.  “This is my woman Chris.  THE SANTA MARIA HAS NO ROOM FOR  him who is not passionate about her. She’ll transport you to places you can only dream about.”<br>  <br>  Meanwhile, back in the map room, Giuseppe, had taken the map Christopher made to Queen Isabella.  The Queen, took one look at the map and asked who had made it.  When told that Christopher Columbus had done it, she ordered him into her presence that very daY.<br>  <br>  "OUR FAR-FETCHED SCHEME SEEMS TO HAVE BACKFIRED.” said Columbus as he waved good-bye to his friend Paulo.<br>  <br>  Now you know the rest of the story.<br>  <br>  So long Mr. Harvey.

2f364660a9e7be4d45ae529341311f50aa	here is some info I found on line - hope it helps -<br>  <br>  Don't forget that the expansion of the colonies from Virginia - to the Carolinas, took lands from the Native Americans - the Indians fought a hard battle trying to keep their sacred lands, however the government's unkept  promises, and indian massacures led to<br>  the demise of the Native American population in our new southern colonies.<br>  <br>  It is important to note, however, that these epidemics were just some of the causes of population decline during European contact. Intermarriage, slavery, wars, massacres, political disruption, economic changes, malnutrition, destruction of traditional subsistence patterns, and alcoholism also changed the composition of many Native American groups, whether they favored the changes or fought them. Eventually, these changes caused substantial depopulation and cultural change. This Native American depopulation occurred during the contact period, causing the Native American population size to decline from 1-18 million before European contact (c. AD 1500) to an estimated 530,000 by 1900. <br>  <br>  This paper looks at social implications of the smallpox epidemics because this disease may have contributed significantly to Native American population decline. Ethnohistorical sources document smallpox's effect on Native American morale, health, social structure, and population size. Some researchers argue that the way Native Americans viewed the disease, as well as their methods of disease treatment and response to the epidemics, exacerbated mortality from the disease. Traditional indigenous medical treatments such as sweatlodges worsened smallpox mortality rates, and significant population loss from the epidemics caused drops in fertility, loss of cultural knowledge, and high suicide rates. However, Kelton (2004) argues that actions such as quarantining, burning infected sites, and incorporating the disease in their religious systems (e.g. Smallpox Dance) decreased the mortality rates.

eY2wtf2Jaa	A love story. Definately. It may be true that the Capulets are fighting with the Montagues, but somehow, Romeo and Juliet fall in love. and in the end, Juliet's "death" (im pretty sure you've read the story if you're questiong its meaning)  causes romeo to go to Juliet's tomb where he drinks poison and dies. When Juliet's potion wears off, she awaken's to find her lover's corpse. She then proceeds to stab herself with Romeo's dagger. And that is love. They overcome their families and fall into a deep love. <br>  <br>  -I hope this helps ! =)|`|3S4E3WXAaa	I think Romeo And Juliet is a play about how people fall "in love" and don't ever truly think it though.

Because there's terrible conflict between the Montague's and the..Cant remember the other family! But, that's a great topic which can be explored in great detail.

It shows great passion through out the play. Especially in Act 3 Scene 5 as Romeo and Juliet are in bed together, which is soo exciting as the reader knows that Juliet's mother is on her way to wake her, but Romeo and Juliet are so in love, they stay in bed and are arguing whether it's night time, or day time!

She wanted to be a vet or a writer!<br>  <br>  In her childhood she had polio for nine months, but made a nearly full recovery. I guess her difficult childhood has made her very sympathetic towards children. And her love for animals is also quite special. <br>  <br>  Here's some cited text:<br>  <br>  <br>  She wrote radio commercials, plays, and magazine stories. She also published two nonfiction adult books. Her first book for kids (Winning Monologs for Young Actors) was published in 1985. Since then she has published many popular books for young people.<br>  <br>  She has won dozens of state Young Reader awards as well as the PEN Center Award in Children's Literature, the Golden Kite Award from the Society of Children’s Book Writers & Illustrators, and the Henry Bergh Award from the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA.)<br>  <br>  She has spoken at schools, libraries, and children’s literature conferences.<br>  <br>  Her's a link:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pegkehret.com/Biography.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.pegkehret.com/Biography.html</a>

I agree the use of satire is an interesting topic but personally I don't think there's enough 'content' to write a paper about it.  I suggest a topic like: Truth versus Happiness. or the Ultimatum of Savage versus Civilized.<br>  <br>  www.paperstarter.com has a great list of thesis topics to pick from and information on each one to get your brain thinking.

Suddenly, an angry bear appears in your path. Do you stay and fight OR do you turn and run away? These are "Fight or Flight" responses. In these types of situations, your sympathetic nervous system is called into action - it uses energy - your blood pressure increases, your heart beats faster, and digestion slows down.<br>  Notice in the picture on the left that the sympathetic nervous system originates in the spinal cord. Specifically, the cell bodies of the first neuron (the preganglionic neuron) are located in the thoracic and lumbar spinal cord. Axons from these neurons project to a chain of ganglia located near the spinal cord. In most cases, this neuron makes a synapse with another neuron (post-ganglionic neuron) in the ganglion. A few preganglionic neurons go to other ganglia outside of the sympathetic chain and synapse there. The post-ganglionic neuron then projects to the "target" - either a muscle or a gland.<br>  <br>  Two more facts about the sympathetic nervous system: the synapse in the sympathetic ganglion uses acetylcholine as a neurotransmitter; the synapse of the post-ganglionic neuron with the target organ uses the neurotransmitter called norepinephrine. (Of course, there is one exception: the sympathetic post-ganglionic neuron that terminates on the sweat glands uses acetylcholine.)

AA10023710	There are a lot of types of accreditation out there. Any university you consider should be, specifically, regionally accredited, or you may have difficulty having employers recognize that degree, and you certainly will have difficulty with grad schools. <br>  <br>  You also want your engineering program to be ABET accredited. That's a specific type of professional accreditation for engineering programs. <br>  <br>  If your engineering program is not ABET accredited, then yes, you will have issues with grad schools, and in some states, you may have issues re: employment or with being able to actually practice as an engineer when you graduate. In many states, if your program isn't ABET accredited, you can not become a licensed professional engineer. You need to speak to the engineering advisor at your school to find out what's up in your state, and with your program.  <br>  <br>  This website may also help:<br>  <a href="http://www.eng.wayne.edu/page.php?id=4689" rel="nofollow">http://www.eng.wayne.edu/page.php?id=468...</a>|`|Moz2d806aa	It won't really matter.

Then use the napkins to soak up every bit of water in the puddle.  Make sure no dripping is allowed.  Then put wet napkins in the container and measure its mass again.  Subtracting the original mass from the new one you will have the mass of the water.  Knowing that the density of water is 1 g/cm^3 you now know the volume in cm^3 (mL) of water in the puddle.

ktOqm7cgaa	Yes, Sigmund Freud made a number of statements relating to science.  Below are four, plus two more in my "Edit."<br>  <br>  "No, our science is no illusion. But an illusion it would be to suppose that what science cannot give us we can get elsewhere." <br>  ~ Sigmund Freud <br>  [From "The Future of an Illusion" (1927), in J. Strachey (ed.), "The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud" (1961). Vol. 21, 56.]<br>  <br>  "For I am actually not at all a man of science, not an observer, nor an experimenter, not a thinker. I am by temperament nothing but a conquistador—an adventurer... with all the curiosity, daring, and tenacity characteristic of a man of this sort." <br>  ~ Sigmund Freud <br>  [From a letter to Wilhelm Fliess, February 1, 1900.  Quoted in Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson (ed.). "The Complete Letters of Sigmund Freud to Wilhelm Fliess" (1985). 398.] <br>  <br>  "It is unreasonable to expect science to produce a system of ethics—ethics are a kind of highway code for traffic among mankind—and the fact that in physics atoms which were yesterday assumed to be square are now assumed to be round is exploited with unjustified tendentiousness by all who are hungry for faith; so long as physics extends our dominion over nature, these changes ought to be a matter of complete indifference to you." <br>  ~ Sigmund Freud <br>  [From a letter to Oskar Pfister, February 24, 1928. Quoted in H. Meng and E. Freud (eds.), "Psycho-Analysis and Faith: The Letters of Sigmund Freud and Oscar Pfiste" (1963). 123.]<br>  <br>  "Sexual love is undoubtedly one of the chief things in life, and the union of mental and bodily satisfaction in the enjoyment of love is one of its culminating peaks. Apart from a few queer fanatics, all the world knows this and conducts its life accordingly; science alone is too delicate to admit it."<br>  ~ Sigmund Freud<br>  Please see:<br>  <a href="http://www.spaceandmotion.com/Philosophy-Sigmund-Freud-Psychoanalysis.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.spaceandmotion.com/Philosophy...</a><br>  <br>  Edit:  Stacey, in the second quote above, Freud is certainly not complimenting science!  However, perhaps one of the following is that for which you are searching:<br>  <br>  "Poets are masters of us ordinary men, in knowledge of the mind, because they drink at streams not yet made accessible to science."<br>  ~ Sigmund Freud<br>  Please see:<br>  <a href="http://www.gaia.com/quotes/Sigmund_Freud" rel="nofollow">http://www.gaia.com/quotes/Sigmund_Freud</a><br>  <br>  "In the course of centuries the na?ve self-love of men has had to submit to two major blows at the hands of science. The first was when they learnt that our earth was not the centre of the universe but only a tiny fragment of a cosmic system of scarcely imaginable vastness... the second blow fell when biological research destroyed man's supposedly privileged place in creation and proved his descent from the animal kingdom and his ineradicable animal nature… But human megalomania will have suffered its third and most wounding blow from the psychological research of the present time which seeks to prove to the ego that it is not even master in its own house, but must content itself with scanty information of what is going on unconsciously in its mind." <br>  ~ Sigmund Freud <br>  [From "Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalyis" (1916), in J. Strachey (ed.), "The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud" (1963). Vol. 16, 284-5.]

This is not high school, your choice to go to college was your own (or maybe your parents), and you need to do more then just show up. <br>  As far as the theory of making people always feel like a winner, when you're younger that's great. But you're in college, you're an adult. In a job, if you're not doing something as well as your co-worker, they get promoted and you don't. You get no credit in the real world for just showing up. I think college is supposed to prepare us for the real world. We can't expect to be cuddled our whole life.<br>  Now, there are some exceptions to this. One of which happened to me. I was taking a course on Dialects for Theater. I can't remember any class I worked so hard in. I received a C (my lowest grade in college). I have always had trouble in regards to speaking correctly. I had to have speech therapy as a child for 9 years. So dialects were hard for me to grasp. I felt that a C was a little harsh considering how hard I worked. In this case the grade was based solely on my performance of the dialect and not at all based on how much work I put into it, although my teacher noted how hard I worked.<br>  There needs to be a balance of participation and ability.|`|AA11383464	Education is a process, not a product, so the concept of "student as consumer" is nonsense.  Students get the grades they deserve in my class.  I teach in the healthcare field and the idea that I should let someone "slide" so as to retain them as a "customer" is malpractice and could very well cost someone their life.  I will NEVER allow that to happen.|`|Sozc3MyFaa	I think this is a fabulous though question; I just wish I had the time to really write an essay response to it!  My feelings are that higher education is not a right or an entitlement; but a opportunity: so no, professors are not the employees of the students.  And you pay to get a a highly educated professional open doors for you; so why would you want to short change yourself that opportunity by demanding minimal work for a higher grade? Americans have such a huge sense of entitlement (something for nothing) that is why we rank so far down in work ethics, productivity & and educational intelligence. It also cheapens the degree (to get one with no effort), which is why a bachelors is viewed as almost nothing in some areas, now requiring a masters or higher. And yes, I think they are whiners.  My BFF teaches in high school, and boy are they entitled whiners as well.  One reason people graduate and can't spell, use good grammar, and get & keep a job.<br>  <br>  But, great question--which this was a college course (LOL) to explore further!!

AA10176626	Niah:<br>  <br>  Financial aid applicants with an Expected Family Contribution score of zero qualify for the special forms of financial aid known as "need-based" aid. In fact, any applicant with an EFC of less than 4041 qualifies for need-based aid.<br>  <br>  The programs that make up the need-based aid category include the Pell Grant, the FSEOG Grant, the ACG Grant, the SMART Grant, the Perkins Loan, the subsidized Stafford Loan, and the Federal Work Study Program.<br>  <br>  Though a student may qualify for all of these programs, the only one that is guaranteed is the Pell Grant. Your school may, or may not, be able to offer you the FSEOG, or the Perkins, or the other programs that I mentioned.<br>  <br>  A common fallacy is that your EFC score represents what you must pay for school. People here will tell you an EFC of zero means that you just need to show up, and that all of your school bills are taken care of for you. That's not true at all.<br>  <br>  The maximum Pell Grant award for this year is $4731. The new economic stimulus bill includes funding to increase that award by another $500 for the 2009-2010 school year.<br>  <br>  When your school sends your aid offer letter, they will tell you what forms of aid they have available for you. You will receive the Pell Grant that I mentioned, and you will also be eligible to borrow up to $5500 from the Stafford loan program. Other than those two programs, no one can possibly predict what other forms of aid (and how much of each), your school will be able to offer you.<br>  <br>  Some schools are able to be very generous with aid assistance, while others are less helpful. It really comes down to how many of your school's students will qualify for aid, and how much "need" those students have.<br>  <br>  If you're one of a handful of students at your school who need aid, it's likely that you'll receive everything you need. If you attend a school that accepts many students who need a lot of aid, your school will do the best it can, but they'll have to split their pool of money a lot of different ways.<br>  <br>  If it's any consolation, your aid eligibility IS based on what you'll need for tuition, fees, books, school supplies, room and board, and other miscellaneous education-related expenses, including transportation to and from school. Your school will try to provide as much of that money as they can - and as much as you qualify for. Aid is not just for tuition.<br>  <br>  Your financial aid will be paid directly to the school, and they will deduct whatever you owe them for tuition and fees (and possibly room and board, if that applies). Any remaining money will be returned to you, and that money is meant for you to use for books, food, gas, school supplies, and all of the other expenses of school that are not paid directly to the school.<br>  <br>  Good luck - I hope this information helped.|`|zmszFkXCaa	I qualified for two $ 2500 stafford loans and my EFC was zero as well.

W1xs3vYBaa	Get it done by a professional. To get the contact information go to your local university or high school and they should be able to give it to you. No online sites actually test IQ's; though, the can be fun and randomly give you the same score as a legitimate test. Only way to be sure of your score is to get it tested by a professional.|`|X4O7W1Vvaa	There's loads of free IQ tests on the net. It's worth doing a few different ones as the results are a bit variable.|`|bab98853150b199df79ea228be16f757aa	It depends on what you want or need the IQ tested for.  You were probably tested in school by a professional. If you are still in school, you should first go to your school secretary or counselor and ask to see your score.  You should have access to all of your school records through college, unless your records are 'sealed' for some reason by the court.  <br>  You can use a test at many different locations on-line, but the results of those tests won't give you an 'accurate' IQ level.  They do test 'what you know' but there are good reasons why this doesn't work in general.  People are able to 'cheat' ... to go to other on-line sites and find the right answers, to fool the clock, etc.  If your school has no good IQ on file, then you'd need to go to the closest large university and check with the Psychology Department/School and/or the School of Education and see if they won't test you there.  You will be given an appointment, taken to a 'testing room' and given the test.  IQ tests are carefully timed, and are calculated from your 'score' on the exam, with your age and even your gender in many cases factored in.  It takes approximately half a day to take the tests, and up to four weeks to get the results.  You are not allowed to see the answers to the test at any time, nor would you be 'included' in the calculations.  Even then, the IQ test can be accurate only to a point.  You may 'know far more' than the test you'll be given requires, or you may have a high intelligence but be 'handicapped' in some way that throws the numbers off.  It costs money to be given an IQ test, and up to six months in all from the time you 'ask' to taking the actual test and being given your results.  I know this is probably not the answer you wanted to be given, but this is the only 'real and accurate' way to be tested for 'intelligence.'|`|xwZV9jgPaa	meyer's briggs intelligence test....they have a website|`|u1XplU3Xaa	<a href="http://www.iqtest.com/prep.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.iqtest.com/prep.html</a><br>  <br>  Hope I helped <br>  Lubbyluu x|`|7IVEMAg8aa	You can do it online.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.iqtest.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.iqtest.com/</a>|`|qUa82wDNaa	How many Fingers am I holding Up ??<br>  <br>  LOL<br>  <br>  Actually there are websites that do this for free, Google them, But I wouldn't put too much stock in the results.|`|Hmi5DngLaa	if you have to ask then no retart

Ever since I realized this, a commercial just isn't the same. After the commercial is over (and I'm sure my family always hates me for it), I say, "Oh, I see what they did there, they redirected your attention to the logo on the screen to get it into your head."<br>  <br>  eg. Pedigree dog food commercial:<br>       First, there's a white background, forcing you to look at the bag of dog food, with the large logo. Then, you begin to look elsewhere, as the human brain cannot concentrate on one thing for long with great mental strength, so you see the dog, but you can't really look at it, because it is eating out of the bag, making you continue to look there. <br>  Then words come on the screen, such as "no artificial flavours..", because of the white background, you are now pretty much forced to look at them, getting them into your head too! Eventually, you go to the store, and for some reason in your mind, you think that Pedigree dog food would be a good idea, but you don't really know why. <br>  <br>  This only works because you aren't expecting it to happen, you're in a subliminal state, after all, its just a commercial.<br>  <br>  Other ways of advertising are scaring you into thinking something bad might happen to you if you don't listen to them, making you think that their a warm, nice company that gives money to charity all the time (although some actually are), and also making you think that their a local business, that is personal to you. <br>  <br>  Even if you don't do your speech on it, I just wanted you, and anyone who reads this, to know this. Tell other people too.<br>  <br>  Be aware during any advertising, to see what their really doing to you. Some, you can realise are honest people just telling you stuff, but don't be brainwashed by them again.<br>  <br>  Good Luck on the speech anyways!

Fnp2MIycaa	QWERTY KEYBOARD<br>  <br>  In 1875, Christopher Sholes with assistance from Amos Densmore  rearranged the typewriter keyboard so that the commonest letters were not so close together and the type bars would come from opposite directions. Thus they would not clash together and jam the machine. The new arrangement was the "QWERTY" arrangement that typists use today. <br>  <br>  Inventor: Christopher Latham Sholes    <br>  Birth: February 14, 1819 in Mooresburg, Pennsylvania <br>  Death: February 17, 1890 in  Milwaukee, Wisconsin <br>  Nationality: American<br>  Invention: "QWERTY" keyboard  <br>  Definition: A standard typewriter keyboard -- called also QWERTY keyboard . Name derived from the first six letters in the second row on English language computer and typewriter keyboards.|`|SCm2mOzsaa	The first commercially successful typewriter was developed by Christopher Latham Sholes in 1873. Originally, the keys were arranged alphabetically. However, a problem soon arose. People became so adept at using the keyboard that the keys would stick or jam when struck in quick succession. In order to overcome this problem Sholes decided to make the job of typing as slow as he possibly could. He placed the most frequently used keys as far apart from each other as he could. His keyboard became known as the QWERTY keyboard.|`|oO4TUkVkaa	The most commonly used letters are on the middle row for easier usage.  That would be my guess.

sNnWreZbaa	You are certainly well-qualified :)<br>  You have great academic records, many extracurriculars (including leadership!), and a ridiculous amount of community service hours.  <br>  <br>  Your admissions now depends on your application (AKA your essay and your interviews).  <br>  <br>  Usually the essay will make or break your admissions chances, so be sure to write a good essay.  Choose a topic that you are passionate about; write about an interesting personal experience.  Most importantly, write about something you know (not something made up or something you are only writing about just to get into the school of your dreams).  Don't try to cater to the admissions officers by trying to write what you "think" they want to hear, but rather, show them your true character, sincere passions, future goals, etc.<br>  <br>  Show them what you got!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|C4WlEbIOaa	Look in the University of California schools-- UCLA, UCSD, Berkeley, Boston University, Boston College, Georgetown, George Washington, University of Virginia, New York University.

SIhxrxD3aa	The dependency question regarding homelessness isn't specific about how long you were homeless.  However, it does say that you had to be declared homeless by a director of a homeless shelter, runaway program, or emergency shelter on or after July 1, 2008.  If no one determined that you were homeless then it doesn't count.  But, if someone of authority such as the director of a shelter determined that you were homeless for those ten days, then I guess that would count.<br>  <br>  Remember though that being independent doesn't guarantee you a pell grant.  All that it means is that you do not have to report your parents income.  In many cases, that actually has a negative effect on your financial aid.|`|z7FEj9QSaa	Nope, you probably don't want to be independent unless your parents just don't do anything, cause if you claim yourself independent then your parents cant claim you on there taxes as dependent and most likely that will cost you more money anyways.<br>  If you do want to be independent, You could get emancipated or get married|`|hMSVmJN5aa	nah son, you gotta be independent for atleast a year...not living off your parents|`|014NXPfFaa	No you need to be either 24, have a child or other dependent, married, or have served active duty military.<br>  <br>  Otherwise you could always get an independent student status evaluation at your school, but it will take lots and lots of paperwork, letters from friends, family, employers, educators who will all say that you get absolutely NO HELP from your parents and fully support yourself (they can't pay health insurance premiums, be on any of your accounts, you cannot live with them or share a mailing address with them, they cant pay your car insurance) . . . Even if your parents are dirt poor and don't pay for anything, if they still put a roof over your head for one day in 2008 then you're considered dependent.|`|6a0f5242e106e58c4ca1b110e61eb592aa	NO.
2646a4e9d6d4e936660d70ff922397f3aa	I'm a Cal Poly Pomona business grad who has been following what has been going on at the school for the past few years, and until a year or two ago, I was proud to be from there.  Then I started hearing that they were having major problems, with a lot of very unhappy faculty (and losing some of the better ones).  I haven't heard any more about that this year, but of course right now all of the CSUs are struggling seriously because of the state's budget situation.  There is some hope because they have selected a new Dean who will be starting in summer, but it is hard to see what is happening right now because their website is lacking some critical information.  Having said that, they have had one of the better CSU business programs for years, so even if they have had a recent meltdown, they are probably still at least as good as a lot of the other campuses.
H7r2kcctaa	You said 2 years, so I think that you're thinking of like a nurse's assistant or something. You can become a P.A. either through a 5 year accelerated program or do an undergrad in a science and then do a master's program in P.A.<br>  <br>  EDIT: To person below, Physician's Assistance is a professional degree, you can't have a Bachelor's and become a P.A. You either go to grad school or do the accelerated.|`|Lfh0DWppaa	If you're speaking of a 2+2 program, then that means you attend your undergrad courses (generally premed, mostly science) then transfer to the 2-year program when you've completed the 2 years prereqs. So it's still 4 years total, and a BS or something when you graduate.<br>  <br>  Some schools are doing 5 year programs, too, but they're master's. <br>  <br>  "Experience" generally means yes, you've been in the health field. But different schools have different definitions, so you'll need to contact and admissions officer for that PA program and find out what they're referring to. <br>  <br>  Good luck!

AqDson6zaa	Your weighted GPA (4.59) is your GPA, but with boosts from AP classes and honors courses. For example, my GPA is something like 4.11. I have an A in Honors English (4-->4.5), an A in History (4), an A in PE/Health (4), an A in Religion (4), an A in French (4), a B+ in Honors Algebra 2/Trig (3.5-->4), and a B+ in AP Biology (3.5-->4.5). I'm not sure if all of the numbers are right, but that gives me a 4.11 or something. AP is +1, honors is +0.5.<br>  <br>  Unweighted is without the extra boost from AP/honors. <br>  <br>  Percentile means the amount of people you scored higher than.<br>  <br>  You've got awesome grades. All As, I'm jealous... I screwed up first semester.<br>  <br>  EDIT: For the Valedictorian thing, I would hope it would be the non-weighted, because just because someone takes more AP courses to show off it doesn't mean they're a better student. It might be the weighted, though, or maybe a combo of the two? I think it varies school-to-school.|`|WZbox5nhaa	unweighted is out of 4.00. so that means u got all A's in all of ur classes. (nice).<br>  <br>  weighted is like giving u more than 100%. 4.00 is like a hypothetical 100% so 4.59 is like 115%. it gives u extra points for taking hard classes, probably AP classes or honors classes. those A's are given even more credit, like A+ or something. so ur rank is 13 in ur class becuz some people took more AP classes and also got all A's.|`|iyweojLoaa	raw score you probably have the best, but there's people who take more advanced classes than you, or a larger amount of advanced classes, so their GPAs are higher..<br>  <br>  i think the weighted GPA is counted for the school and what they decide when doing ranks and valedictorian..i don't think there would be a point in having weighted GPAs if they didn't..they want to recognize the kids who took challenges and add more on their GPA to show for it..i think having a less than 4.0 unweighted GPA due to lots of AP classes looks better than a 4.0 AP unweighted GPA with just honors or only like 1 or 2 APs, so don't be hesitant to take some more AP classes because a B+ is okay|`|ZKVlF2pKaa	If you take AP courses, then it is possible to score higher than a 4.0, because they consider it extra credit because it's a college level course, so you're going above and beyond the requirements of high school and your GPA reflects that. It also means that you have the best scores of anyone in your class that did not take AP courses, but if you include everyone in the school you ranked 13 as there are 12 other kids who did better in their AP courses or took more AP courses than you did. Depending on your SAT/ACT scores, with these grades you could easily get into any college you wanted too. Congrats!

Obama does not have "real-life" experiences in which to gauge what reality is.... thus, he see's a distorted la-la land.  In his book, his role models (he said) were communists and socialists...  that's not real-world thinking.<br>  <br>  Lincoln was a man of the people who knew about hard work.  Obama has had everything, the very best, given to him all of his life and exception made for him because he was perceived to be "special".<br>  <br>  Lincoln knew about heartache.  Obama has had the comfort of heavy duty money to insulate him from reality.<br>  <br>  Lincoln had wisdom borne of life experiences.  Obama has zero wisdom and no real-life experiences that the average family or man has.<br>  <br>  There is no comparison.  Lincoln was a great man.  Obama is more an adolescent in a man's body.....  one doesn't "grow up" simply by getting older.|`|9c0ebf2284780ff9c1a5dcae51b5d90eaa	It's all true.  The Democrats have always been about taking away our liberties.  They want big government in every part of our lives.

AA12063813	a lo largo de mi vida, un monton de intersantes los accidentes ocurren. De uno de mis muschos interesante aun fue el dia mas triste de mi pajaro volando. Aves de mi nombre fue soleado. Ella era mi mas querido de aves. Hasta que un dia, cuando yo estaba en la escuela, yo y mi amigo vio un cuervo muerto. Mi amigo me dijo "sabia que hay un mito de que cuando vea un cuervo muerto mala suerte vendra a ti?" yo solo se rio y no le cree.<br>  <br>  Cuando llegue a casa de la escuela ese dia, toda mi familia estaba actuando extrano a mi alrededor. Fue la que me entere que mi pajaro sol se ausente de su jaula. Estaba tan alterado que llore en mi habitaction para el resto del dia. De esta eperiencia, i ahora creen mis amigos mito.

W1tx1p2iaa	Currently you can get a master degree in PT and be eligible to sit for the PT boards in the US.  However, there are only 13 programs in the US that still offer a MS degree in PT and they need to convert to the DPT in the near future.  So most people coming out of college at the present time are earning a doctor of physical therapy (clinical doctorate).

This word is overused nowadays. If you're no longer in the sixth grade, avoid it like the plague.<br>  <br>  "Themselves": I would leave this.

Now, to honestly answer your question about education.  When I was young I felt the same way as you.  Now I'm a teacher and I see why kids desperately need education.  I remember being a kid and having people looking at me like I was a total idiot most of the time.  Come to find out...I was an idiot most of the time.  Not because I was young but because I was uneducated.  The things that the kids in my classroom don't know never stops astounding me.  And I'm not talking about things like ridiculously hard math formulas, but things that are just basic common knowledge for a well rounded person.  The school I teach in is approximately 20 minutes away from the Atlantic ocean but more than half of the kids in my class didn't know, before I taught them, that the ocean was salt water because their parents never bothered to take them there.  You need to go to school so when you get out into the so called "real world" you can get a good job and understand everyday common conversations.  I know how you feel, I remember feeling that exact same way.  Trust me, your understanding of why you need to learn will come with time.  And no, if you are moving somewhere that only Japaneese is spoken I don't think that you need to learn English but I know that most schools require a foreign language be one of your classes.

AA11770802	Public Law 107 -110, which is more commonly known as "No Child Left Behind" is a law that President Bush put into effect in 2001 that states that all states have to make standards and then test their children to make sure that they are learning those standards. The law also states that each year, more and more children have to pass the tests, until in 2014 when ALL children will be passing. Every year that schools don’t raise the number of students who pass the tests in all of 48 different subgroups, the school is labeled as "failing" and will be greatly penalized.|`|MyUi3Blyaa	Essentially it is a national basic skills test with the main focus on reading.<br>  The Act was brought in to centralise education so that all states would have a national focus in literature skills. <br>  In reality it meant that government agencies such as the military had an updated record of every childs phone number and address. It also meant that many schools started teaching to the test and some would argue that this wasn't the intention of the act.<br>  It is interesting that these types of national initiatives take away a lot of power from the state jurisdictions but consequently this doesn't lead to more funding from the national body. <br>  This type of bureacracy takes up a substantial amount of funding that really could be more beneficial to the states that need it instead of an even share to all fifty.|`|zknQnJgUaa	SPONSOR RESULTS<br>  No Child Left Behind <br>  www.faster-results.com - Great No Child Left Behind Information, All You Need Here.<br>  <br>  Left Behind - CBD <br>  Christianbook.com - Save at Christianbook on the Left Behind Series and more today.

AA10911602	Christian music, a modern phenomina|`|NI8pKCEpaa	legalizing marijuana. Look at all the things that prosecuting marijuana users has done to society<br>  <br>  1. The moeny were spending keeping non violent offenders in jail<br>  2 the money were spending for anti drug classes, for people who just smoke marijuana and dont necessarily have a problem<br>  3 We could tax marijuana and get ourselves out of the recession we are in<br>  4 A kid buys a dubsack from his dealer with the money his dad gave him for allowance. His dad buys a dubsack from the same dealer and sits there and smokes it and thinks to himself "how could i bond with my son...?". -Sounds ironic... but in the meantime both of their twenty dollars went to a drug dealer, who is not paying taxes on his income, and might even be one welfare GAINING money from the government. This is a huge reason the economy is in the state it is in, that is overlooked and blamed on the banks and realestate.<br>  5. Marijauna was made illegal in america in the first place because mostly blacks and mexicans smoked it and the white man tried to say that it was making them rape and kill people (lies). So basically it was made illegal and remains illegal to this day because of racism... and noone cares.<br>  <br>  The reason why the government WONT make it legal:<br>  <br>  1. Economy of special interest groups: the tobacco industry, the alcohol industry and the timber industry (hemp produces 4 times as much paper as trees) all lobby to the government with money to keep it illegal. They are also the ones who fund those AboveTheInfluence commericals... ya thats right the cigarette companies are telling you what is right and wrong.<br>  2. The effects of marijauna, as a comedian once put it: Hungry, Happy, Sleepy. The problem with this to the government is that if people are happy and lazy, they aren't pissed off and their life's AREN'T being ruined. Therefore they never develop an enormous amount of rage. But why would the government not want us to be happy???? Because they want u to join the military, and the only way that will happen is if there are pissed off people who wan't to kill, and marijuana stops that. (Not saying people in the military are immoral in any way, its just the military would have less members if marijuana were legal, and the government knows this.)<br>  3. The aristocracy of america is not as democratic as it seems. If you were to have a nation wide vote for legalizing marijuana, it might just be on the legalize side these days: 42% of americans admit to have trying  marijuana atleast once. And im guessing theres a group of people who has never tried it, but has the common sense to realize that it isn't harmful, to anything but the minor effects to the smoker. (compared to ciggarettes... and it REALLY doesnt make sense why noone is pushing to legalize it.

40c85b996c134163f45223b2c362cd80aa	The first Viking raid, the one that most historians take as the signal that opened the "Viking Age" was the raid on the monestary on Lindisfarne Island in AD 793.<br>  <br>  The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle for that year records that the attack was committed on "the sixth day before the Ides of January."  The Ides were originally the full moon of a month, but by the late Roman period the dates had become fixed, and this was sense of "Ides" that medieval writers used.  The Ides of January falls on the 13th.  So the attack on Lindisfarne monestary was on 7th of January - or the day after the Feast of the Kings (aka Epiphany).<br>  <br>  I'm not sure we can know what time of day it occured.  The Chronicle mentions lightning, so it was apparently a stormy day (or night) ... which, of course, just adds to the "pathetic fallacy" of the day.  The weather itself seemed to be against the monks just as much as vikings!<br>  <br>  Monks lived in Monestaries, usually under the Rule of St. Benedict, which offered a regimented life, with specific hours to eat, work and pray.  Each monk has a small room (called a "cell") to sleep in, but otherwise shared everything in common with his brother monks.  Monestaries were usually founded in somewhat remote places in order to allow those who had chose the contemplative life to be free of bustle and distractions of more settled areas and towns.<br>  <br>  The Monestary at Lindisfarne was located on a tidal island - a pennisula that is connected to the mainland only twice a day at low tide.

There are all sorts of different types of puppets, and to consider a marionette to be merely a 'doll' is wrong.<br>  <br>  As for when the first marionette was made, I'm not sure.

Your best bet is to head to your local library and find some books on puppetry.|`|JoyIIiZ6aa	Marionettes are not puppets, and that is one major distinction you need to know. Marionettes are basically dolls with strings attached so they can be manipulated into various movements from above.  The oldest marionettes were found in Egyptian tombs and it is believed that they were used as far back as 2000 BC.  The first marionettes may have been used for sacred rituals in temples, and were manipulated with wires instead of strings.  A puppet is a character worn by the puppeteer on his or her hand, like the traditional Punch and Judy characters.

(what i have been told)<br>  <br>  <br>      *  Take challenging high school coursework in and out of the sciences.<br>      * You need chemistry and physics - they provide a solid foundation in the physical sciences for biological study at the university. In general, students with good chemistry and physics backgrounds from high school have a better chance of succeeding in biology.<br>      * Additional biology or science classes, such as anatomy and physiology, genetics, or advanced science are often taken in high school. These are beneficial classes, but do not neglect solid chemistry and physics classes! Take biology as a sophomore, chemistry as a junior, and physics as a senior. Then while a junior and senior take additional science courses if they are available. Tackle a challenging Science Fair project, too!<br>      * Math courses are also important. Algebra I, algebra II, and trigonometry are common high school math courses you should have. If you have the chance, take calculus, or wait for a university class. Math is important because it is a "way of thinking", as much as anything else, and helps prepare your mind for chemistry and biology.<br>      * Take a computer course that allows you to develop real skills using spreadsheets, word processors, and databases. While Internet browsing is fun and interesting - we use it all the time - you can learn the net anytime.<br>      * English, literature, history, and speech? Yes! You will become a biologist, but biologists read, write, and speak - a lot. Reading is so fundamental to success that student test scores on reading are often better predictors of success in science than is a science background.

34VXCyvVaa	Generally, yes, you have a better chance of getting in.  Now that colleges are ranked by U.S. News and other sites, they all want to look better than the competition.  They can do that by getting a higher yield of students, meaning that a high percentage of students that they accept eventually agree to come to their college or university.  One way they do that is by allowing students to apply for early admission with the understanding that if they are accepted, they WILL enroll at the university.  Obviously the university can pick and choose among the students who apply via early decision, but generally a higher percentage of early admission students are accepted to the university.  Students that they don't accept are usually deferred to the regular admissions pool.  The advantage to the student is that if you have one clear top choice, one school that you'd prefer to attend above all others, and that school accepts you via early decision, then you generally know by New Year's Day whether you are in or out.  If you're in, you don't have to write any other college essays or fill out other applications.

If you are asking will a higher education provide you with opportunities to make more money the answer is yes.  However, I know many people who have very good educations but haven't really done anything with them.  I mean they have jobs that are completely unrelated to their academic background - which makes me wonder why they spend so much time and effort studying something they don't use.

34VXCyvVaa	I think the most important aspects to being successful in life are personal ambition and perseverance.  But people who have a lot of drive, determination and perseverance generally DO go on to college.

A college degree doesn't mean you'll be successful, and not having one doesn't mean you won't.  People always point to Bill Gates, but he dropped out of Harvard - he didn't finish a degree but he was smart enough to get into Harvard in the first place and very driven.  For every successful person without a college degree, there are 20 working at McDonalds.  If you don't have a great plan for your life that doesn't involve college, consider college.

I am an eighth grader and my teacher has gone over this alot so say you were talking about taco's One of the 2-4 sentences i would have are taco's can be made very many ways. So my next paragraph i would say Taco's can be very easy to make. then ways on making them etc. so basically your introduction paragraph will just be stating what your body paragraphs will be saying.

1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	PA training won't overlap with premed much, just like nursing doesn't overlap with premed.  And both are more technical training than general education, which most students will be getting.  You probably won't finish all your premed in two years before transferring to a PA program, so you might not be eligible to apply to med school, and if you do all 4 years before going to PA its an unnecessary masters degree.  You can just do the 4 years in a bio degree or anything else and take premed and then apply to med school like most students.  It's not like you'll have time to work as a PA in med school.

Also to keep you informed on the development of children in the setting.<br>  <br>  Learn from each other, if you don’t fully understand how to deal with a situation in the setting , or if you need help with an activity you can watch and learn from other team members and adults.<br>  <br>  Support each other, supporting and being loyal to you colleagues is very important with in a team. If problems arise it is comforting to know you have the support from your work team within the setting. <br>  <br>  Aid social skills and share knowledge, offering help to each other with opportunities to interact with the children, staff and parents in the setting by sharing your knowledge . <br>  <br>  Sharing responsibilities, this is a great benefit while working within a team and with other adults as there are a lot of responsibilities working in childcare.<br>  <br>  Sharing the work load, by sharing the work load with adult or team members the day to day running of the setting can go quit smoothly and without any flaws.  <br>  <br>  Other benefits associated with team/adult work are : exchanging ideas and skills, giving moral support and encouragement to each other when needed, hope this helped !|`|QwbOCHSTaa	You want the child to be able to trust adults and feel comfortable around them.

SOSsN6mpaa	Have you learned/ are you learning quadratic equations?  Because this is one! <br>  <br>  One of the numbers can be x and the other x-5 <br>  "the square of the larger number" x is the larger number. so x^2 <br>  "increased by 27" so x^2 + 27 <br>  "the result is the smaller number multiplied by -7" the smaller number being x-5 so: <br>  x^2 + 27 = -7x <br>  add 7x to both sides: x^2 + 27 +7x = -7x +7x <--- zero <br>  rearrange: x^2 + 7x + 27 = 0 <br>  this is a quadratic equation!  <br>  The formula is -b ± square root of (b^2 - 4ac) <br>  and that entire thing divided by 2a <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.enchantedlearning.com/math/algebra/quadratic/gifs/formula.GIF" rel="nofollow">http://www.enchantedlearning.com/math/al...</a>  <br>  that's a link of a picture of it. <br>  <br>  so what are a, b, and c? <br>  the quadratic formula only works when you have a quadratic equation: <br>  ax^2 + bx + c = 0 <br>  <br>  you have: x^2 + 7x + 27 = 0  <br>  the coefficient for x^2 is 1. So a = 1 <br>  the coefficient for + 7x is 7. so b = 7 <br>  c = 27 <br>  <br>  plug in the numbers: <br>  -7 ± square root of (7^2 - 4 times 1 times 27) all divided by 2 times 1 <br>  <br>  7^2 (7 times 7) is 49. <br>  -4 times 1 is -4 <br>  that times 27 is - 108. <br>  2 times 1 is 2. <br>  <br>  so -7 ± square root of (49-108) all divided by 2 <br>  -7 ± square root of (-59) all divided by 2 <br>  EXCEPT you cannot have a negative square root. <br>  So, there is no answer. which kind of stinks after all that hard work. excpet that means you don't have to do even more! <br>  <br>  BTW the first answerer is wrong because he/she had (x+5)^2 + 27 and converted that to x^2 + 10x +52. <br>  (x+5)^2 is NOT the same as x^2 plus 5^2! and 5^2 is twenty five, NOT 10, and definitely not 10x.
