AA12170560	You'll probably want to think about a receiver or cornerback position.<br>  <br>  Both are well suited to slim, athletic body types.<br>  <br>  Saftey, which is a DB position like Cornerback, requires a great deal of experience and skill.<br>  <br>  But as much as we here can conjecture, the bottom line is, you play where the coach puts you.|`|3IQq3FPSaa	I think you should try out for WR or DB. Your build suits those positions perfectly! Since you're about equal with the other guys, I think you have a good shot to make the team at one of those positions. Good luck and have fun!|`|cPc2Q6MHaa	Free Safety would be a nice starting position.  Not too much responsibility on the D.  Don't have to cover the TEs.  Kinda like the last line of defense roaming around back there.  <br>  <br>  And you'll have time to learn the defense and can eventually move to strong side.|`|KsoUiryAaa	How fast are you as in 40 speed? If you dont know being as skinny as you are and in your height range I would say that you should try out to be a WR for your team. If you are still growing, keep eating and put on some more weight and turn it into muscle and try to be on the D-Line|`|VU6ODC5Baa	Tight End|`|e2zEchaYaa	dback or saftey. fits your disctription|`|pwaRd8y8aa	I would say depending on how fast you are, being a wide reciever or a tight end. If you are on the upper end of speed just WR, on the middle or lower pick TE. They aren't too hard, just have to run a route and catch a ball.|`|Rjedkvi1aa	Probably Wr/Te
I1w0HfQbaa	Why are you asking these question on the Wrestling section? Why don't you start a new hobby instead of asking such stupid questions like wrestling a fat, shirtless guy for $500 or an attractive woman for $100.

AA12170560	You can expect a lot of competition for the position you want to play.<br>  <br>  Guys that have played on the team for the last 3 years will work extra hard to beat you out wherever you try to play.<br>  <br>  You can also expect that once the dust settles and the season begins, those same guys will accept you as a team mate whether you are a starting player or not.<br>  <br>  And you can expect to have a great Senior year.|`|4eLzY2hfaa	if you don't get your nose broken at least twice you're not playing the game correctly.|`|0L5wlQlJaa	Lots of hard work|`|QJzno2Mgaa	Well if this is your first year, be ready to get a lot of crap from the coaches...they wont give you any slack, so try to do what they tell you and don't mess up. Also, don't expect to come in and immedialty be good, or expect to get the starting position cause most likely you wont, you just got to work hard and play harder, football is a tough sport so expect to get beat up a little...|`|Sm7Oev8Iaa	You probably won't start unless you prove to be the best at your position. You will more than likely find it a little hard at first but you should adjust. It will take a lot of sweat and guts but if you work as hard as possible you could start.|`|a2O4qDpnaa	To get laid by a lot of sluts.|`|2pMVnCIpaa	I'm not sure what position you are going to play, but varsity football is 90% mental and 10% skill. You have to learn and know the game. Knowledge of the game is the most important thing to your coach, teammates, and your performance. In addition you should expect a great deal of physical wear and getting hit.|`|KfFb9vowaa	be ready to do a lot of team workouts.

usxeet5vaa	I've tried out for a few club teams and made them. Don't be so serious! The only way you play well is when you have fun! Chat with some other girls and loosen up. Focus on the drills and try your hardest. If you make a big mistake, shrug it off and tell yourself that you'lll do better, because you will! After you do one good move, trust me, you will get the confidence. <br>  <br>  And worse case, you won't make it...only worse case. So what? You don't make one soccer team. Maybe you wanted to make it. But it's not your life. Try out for another one. It's not like anyone's going to make fun of you if you don't make it. Even though you need to try your hardest, you just need to know that you gave all you got, and if the other girls are better- who cares? Because you tried your best and that's who you are. <br>  <br>  Just play! Pretend it's a practice. Run hard. You will be fine. <br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK AND HOPE THIS HELPS!|`|iHjD7Nj7aa	well , i have tried out for a couple teams and made them all starting... so what i try to do is just don't make bad mistakes, and always push yourself in all the drills, coaches like when you put all your effort in. Then they know they can train you into a great player. Even if you don't get first string you will still be experiencing a travel team that you aren't use to, so it's a good training technique to play with players above your skills, i mean my team is playing the top teams in the u.s. so good luck

gUMucKOkaa	Absolutely, i would do this trade.  Chris Davis one of this years finds.  Nolasco is an obvious upgrade. Davis is 3B eligible. Not certain what Fields will do but it still seems to be a good trade.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|p3rnyBoYaa	I would make the trade as well.<br>  <br>  I think Ricky will out pitch Maholm and both Teixeira and Longoria should have good years.|`|ZDlZ5vwxaa	If I were in this position, I would accept the trade in the blink of an eye.  Teixeira is one of the elite players in the league, even at a deep 1B position.  Especially if Davis is your 1B.  Also, receiving Ricky Nolasco is quite the deal.  He is one of the biggest sleepers of the year.  As much as I like Longoria, I like Teixeira more; accept.|`|qFuIfIqSaa	definitely. maholm is junk, nolasco is the ace in florida, tex and longoria are pretty similar. switchin davis over to first is a great idea.

tuwHboNnaa	Yeah, i think i know what you mean. I've experienced this before or something similar.

jXCHQOU3aa	no you don't have to take out the spikes out of your shoes. whoever told you that doesn't know what they are talking about. Im not sure why you would want lotion in your spikes it probably wont make a difference at all, otherwise they would sell special lotion for spikes at stores like sport authority and ***** sporting goods, which they don't. ask the person why it would help to put lotion in your spikes and if they don't have a good answer for it its probably pointless

AA11720887	This is not an important trade. No way will you get BJ for the price of Saunders. You can pick up just as good of players in the free agency. Dump JJ Putz as he isn't even a closer this year. Pick up another starter. I have seen Gil Menche in many free agents lists. Grab him if he is available. You are solid. Not sure if I would mess with anything but pitching if I were you. Your outfield is your weakest positions and you don't stink there. Upton is not going to help you much. Even a Taveras will help you. His base-stealing will be more this year than last. Good luck.|`|qFuIfIqSaa	i would take it too. saunders could most likely be replaced by someone on the waivers/free agents.<br>  <br>  On a side note, want to join a another fantasy baseball league.

b7JS16dyaa	I think the fact that Jericho, HBK, and Undertaker are put below Cena and Big Show is strange, but Edge belongs where he is, even if he's lacking momentum right now. Triple H is also above most of them, in my opinion. I'd say he's about fourth after the previously mentioned three veterans. <br>  <br>  They're building up Orton as a future star, so that's why he's there, and I guess they're testing Big Show as a top heel for Smackdown. Show's not that bad, he's quite impressive for his size, actually.<br>  <br>  P.S. MITB is supposed to be used to boost someone's career, which is why it's full of mid-carders. It worked for CM Punk, RVD, and Edge to become World champions, and would have worked for Kennedy if he didn't get injured.|`|2KIRdfIcaa	The MITB is purposely full of Mid-carders because main-eventers have a world championship opportunity at WM.|`|LW6MW7Lhaa	Well Triple H has earned it moreso than Cena. He's been in the WWE for 13 years, Cena was handpicked much too quickly. But I agree there are too many mid-carders thrust into the spotlight too quickly. However, Big Show and Edge are not mid-carders, not sure why you brought that up.|`|ajZpLLNlaa	yea|`|oY4Asqdpaa	triple h is a title holder- he's a main eventer at wm25!!! edge is a title holder- he's main eventing wm25! they cannot put big, huge stars in the mitb coz they are champs! so you saying tht you'd rather see these mid carders in the main events? get a grip and sort it out! wwe have to put big star vs big star! every match is classic at wm anyway! see big stars cannot be put in a mitb coz they are going for the title- nobody else left accept mid carders! jeff hardy isnt a mid carder, rey mysterio is a former champ so he is no longer a mid carder! see its common sense! kane is huge anyway so he could win! kane is a big star too!

gfmTgLDKaa	Yes, ask him face to face. You have to, sometimes they just forget, you have to take a chance.<br>  <br>  My football coach never played me because he always forgot me, and I am as good as any of the starters. I am the fastest person on the team, but my technique is on par with the rest of the running backs, yet I do not get played, because my coach is too in to the game to notice anyone else. <br>  <br>  You have to take a chance by asking, or you'll never get put in. I'm a starter now, because I asked to be it, and they examined me and now they know to play me.<br>  <br>  Just be bold and ask him straight out, at this point you have nothing to lose anyway.<br>  <br>  Good Luck! Hope you get in, it's really fun play in a game with your team!|`|usxeet5vaa	From my experiences, coaches get annoyed when you keep asking them in a game, "When am I playing? Am I playing now?", so try avoiding that. Just tell him one day at practice when you're alone, "What do I need to work on to get better?". Also, don't fool around during practice. The ones who try the hardest in practice are the ones who get to start.<br>  <br>  You will definitely get your chance, but remember: Not everyone gets to play (you probably already know that). Don't feel bad if you're not playing...even for a while. Just keep a good attitude. Hey! At least you made the team. And at least you still love soccer. Our high school soccer coaches are MEAN! REALLY MEAN! You hardly get to play even if you're good. Just play well at practice, and don't worry. Because even if you don't play in the game, soccer is not everything. You're chance will come after you have proven that you are special and have the ability to play. It's shining in your heart. All you have to do is be right htere and show it. <br>  <br>  HOPE THIS HELPS! =]|`|Nd76xrFyaa	i absolutely cannot stand being off the field, but i will have to get used to that for high school, since my dad is my other coach, i play the entire game, which i like. just ask him during practice|`|7BIiofbaaa	make sure you confront him viciously, shouting at him loudly without letting him get a word in edgewise. When he tries to explain to you why you didn't start, quickly condemn his reasons without the slightest thought as to what they are. Finally, when he benches you for the season for doing so, sit down on the field every game until he's forced to play you. hahahahah i'm jk if you do that you'll become infamous and hated everywhere.|`|5w2CJehZaa	i drove three hours to get to a soccer game and i was benched all 90 minutes.<br>  best thing to do is impress your coach alot in practice.|`|H1DUPkm8aa	ask him if you could get in easy or impress him in pratice|`|4XYH9Tgdaa	I would just ask kindly if there was a problem in practice.  If not, ask what you can do to start a game.  But whatever you do don't be nasty.  Have a good attitude!

HQieH8lvaa	Hi, I'm the varsity captain for my high school squad. The best and simplest advice that i can offer (that no one else has), is to pull your legs toward the front when jumping. Often girls pull their legs directly to the side which does not allow the hips to rotate. Imagine you are sitting on the ground doing a center stretch (but not in a stadle!) that is how your legs should be positioned.|`|6U4sl15uaa	I was a cheerleader in high school 2006 in 2006-2007 I did dance and some of the stretches I did was for doing splits and jumps but here are a few of the stretches<br>  Seated Stretch: <br>  1) Sit with your knees bent and feet together in a criss-cross fashion.<br>  <br>  2) Gently press the tops of the knees down toward the floor with your elbows.<br>  <br>  3) Stop when a slight stretch is felt.<br>  <br>  4) Hold for ten seconds and repeat five times.<br>  <br>  Supine Stretch: <br>  1) Lay on the ground, but position your legs as in the seated stretch position.<br>  <br>  2) Slowly let your legs stretch toward the floor.<br>  <br>  3) Stop when a slight stretch is felt.<br>  <br>  4) Hold for ten seconds and repeat five times.<br>  <br>  Standing Stretch: <br>  1) Stand with your legs shoulder-width apart.<br>  <br>  2) Shift your weight to one side, bending your knee slightly.<br>  <br>  3) Stop when you feel a gentle stretch in the opposite leg.<br>  <br>  4) Hold for ten seconds and repeat five times.<br>  <br>  5) Do steps 1 to 4 on the opposite leg.|`|hnkMa69taa	im a cheerleader at high school<br>  im a freshman<br>  most of the girls on my team don't have a toe touch<br>  and only a few can do a pike<br>  unless ur school has some insane rule that you have to have those tumbling skills down<br>  i cant really help<br>  for a toe touch<br>  just really TRY and get ur legs up<br>  really really try.<br>  its hard to explain<br>  pet ur eyes|`|DSDuvYTfaa	I'm a middle school cheerleader. If your having trouble with your toe touch and pike. You should work on that. Stretch on them EVERYDAY. It helps.<br>  <br>  Toe Touch:<br>  Open your legs as wide as you can go to your right side for 30 seconds. (try to have both of your hands on your toe.) then do the same on your left. Then go to the middle for 30 seconds. Do that daily. It helps ALOT. I do it.<br>  <br>  <br>  Pike:<br>  Put both of your legs right in front of you and bend over and touch them and stretch them out real good. For atleast 30 seconds. I point my toes for extra flexability.<br>  <br>  <br>  ALWAYS KEEP YOUR BACK STRAIGHT. :)|`|lRFjaAfoaa	ok this will hurt what you need to do is put on the tx and go into your middle split dont push to far yet. just to where your comfy, then when you get to like the second commercial go lower ( you can stand up and shake out your legs so you wont pull anything) then go back down and push farther down. that wil help with toetouches<br>  <br>  with pikes sit down and touch your toes for a while ( pretty simple)<br>  <br>  i know itll hurt but trust me it will pay in tryouts|`|qcnHFwSaaa	You need to stretch as much as possible, especially in straddle splits. When you are doing your toe touch, rotate your hips back. You're legs cant go high if your knees are facing in. <br>  <br>  For pikes, bend over and touch your toes, pushing your body down as far as you can and holding for twenty counts. Also, work on your abs. Thats what helps you pull your legs up.|`|QdhTNPvXaa	hahaha, this may not sound really good, but i like to practice on the trampoline, it was better, i can actually touch my toes when i jump on there. sometimes i get up and i just start touching my toes :)

She was a starter when she first came to UMD, which sucked, among the worst in the ACC when she was an underclassman, but after Brenda Frese came in Gary Williams-land and Shay Doron started playing for the Terps, Brick basically was out of the starting rotation as if she were shooting bricks the whole time she was there, pun intended.  <br>  <br>  There was also a Duke point guard a few years ago, Vicki Krapohl, and she is not in the WNBA, but she was also pretty good looking, better than everyone else on the Blue Devils' team.|`|2db7f31f8de2a63df2848a630426eea7aa	You show me a recent picture of Drew Gooden. lol :)<br>  <br>  lol @ MVP

8qtm4qkUaa	The most important thing if you want this to be helpful for your relationship with him is to know what his role in the team is. Is he a pitcher or a batter? Is he a catcher or a fielder? If he's a pitcher, then is he a starter, a middle reliever or a closer?<br>  <br>  So, in your reading, find out what you can about these different roles in a team and then ask him what his role is. So, let's say he's a middle reliever on the pitching staff. You could then say to him, "wow, there's a lot of pressure on you to get batters out and not make mistakes. What an adrenaline rush that must be!"   Or ask him how he warms up when he's never sure when he's going to get called on.<br>  <br>  But more important, I suggest you ask him if he wants you to be able to talk to him about baseball some more, or whether he wants you to be the person he can go to to escape from the game and relax. He mightn't want you to be another baseball buddy, but to have a different sort of relationship with you.<br>  <br>  Hopefully, if the relationship with him is going to work out and be a good one, then he likes you for who you ARE, not for someone you're trying to be just to impress him.<br>  <br>  Asking someone else what they want out of a relationship is a much better way to go forward than just trying to impress.<br>  <br>  But if you have a genuine interest in baseball and can speak to him in a natural, easy way about it, and he's happy with that, then great. As I said, focus things around his role in the team.<br>  <br>  And good luck to him, whoever he is. What a great opportunity!|`|5yZICXImaa	The most basic thing that even if you don't know you would have to be a complete dumby and that is that 3 strikes and your out!<br>  <br>  Difficult to do especially if you don't know a lot about baseball is while your watching a game act like your coaching it and calling the coaches on bad choices too.|`|5Wo8cvrzaa	You should know that 3 strikes and your out!

BE YOURSELF.|`|e0M5lpc2aa	There are a million basic things about baseball, but rules aside the most important thing to remember as a player or fan, is to never give up. That's probably the most basic thing. Nothing is ever over.<br>  The Red Sox came from behind from a 3 game to 0 deficit in the ALCS a few years ago, and no one said it could be done, because no one had done it. But they didn't give up, it wasn't over yet. They won 4-3.<br>  Players have hit pop up's to center field and should have been out, but hustled and gotten into 3rd base because they didn't give up, and it wasn't over.<br>  <br>  Aside from all the rules and strategy, the number one thing about baseball can be summed up by Yankee Great, and the man with all the lines, former Catcher Yogi Berra, who frankly stated. "It ain't over till it's over." It's so true, for anyone who has played, or been a fan, this speaks truth!|`|rJR0puvmaa	if you can explain the infield fly rule he will be impressed.  ive played ball my whole life and i still dont get. here it is<br>  <br>  The infield fly rule applies only when there are fewer than two outs, and there is a force play at third (runners on first and second base, or bases loaded).

"not full semi". and not as bad but still, "manuel cocking gun".<br>  <br>  The term for "full semi" is automatic. <br>  The term for "manuel cocking" is single shot/single action/bolt action.<br>  <br>  semi refers to "a little bit" or "some". "Some automatic", meaning a bit automatic, since you just have to squeeze the trigger for another round, rather than recocking for every shot, but is not fully automatic, where you just pull the trigger and hold it for shots. It's "kind of" automatic. <br>  <br>  Sorry but I thought you should be corrected.
QtPdrKfuaa	Yeah but it would be hard because a lot of coaches will have their favorites.  Still being a hard worker, great defensive player, hustler, and a fast player with energy would really impress most coaches.  Find out from other past players what type of player the coaches like.  You could focus on that as well as your defense.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|VXcp8hvHaa	you can try out but probably won't make the team due to lack of experience|`|eJ1yhF9Aaa	only if it's JV|`|uY9Pef3jaa	Yeah, you can try out. From personal expierence a lot of coaches have the majority of the team set, but that doesnt mean you wont make it.<br>  Coaches love players who work extremely hard, you can show your working hard by hustling, going after lose balls and playing defense etc. They also like smart players, try to make it look like you know what your doing, even if you dont.|`|QU5neCD5aa	yea of course. i think wade did it. but please make sure your in condition at least. then make sure you have solid defense, coaches love that, how much you work on your shot depends on your position
bvVG3Xnhaa	Atleast a 100lb bag. If it is to light the bag will swing around to much and since you are starting to kick you will want a heavy bag.|`|K1Nnzq3Jaa	Whatever you want and whatever you feel you will be comfortable with<br>  <br>  <br>  But I think you should get a heavier one cause a 40 lb one would move around too much|`|c4d3e30573f7765b16b9bbddef2168d6aa	get around 100lbs.  If you are any where near light heavy weight, 100lbs should be good.<br>  <br>  Try to avoid water bag, I heard it's not good for kicking and could hurt you.  I'm more of standing bag fan for round house kick, but push kick would be better with the hanging bag. (standing bag falls with push kicks)
8AraxNSEaa	I disagree with the statement that all electronic markers are better than mechanical markers. Some mechanical markers like Tippmanns are extremely reliable and do not break down easily like some electros and you don't have to worry about batteries running down. Electric markers do have more firing capabilities like 3 shot burst, 6 burst, and full auto. Both kinds can run on co2 or HPA with the exception of high-end electros that only run on HPA.|`|xfRwel49aa	Some elcetronic markers work with both CO2 and HPA and all mechanical markers with both HPA and CO2. Anyways electronic markers have multiple firing modes and are more air efficent, accurate, quieter, smoother and are way better overall.  Mechanical guns can not shoot as fast as electronic guns.

utJYCCvaaa	if you wanna be faster like 40 trust you shouldn't at your age work on skill because in grade 10 my schools RB was FAST and i mean like most people could even get to him and our team could never block for him... this year we had a new RB becuase he won the 100m race last year for track so he was put there but he ran way slower on the field... if you want speed on field you need to work skills and awarness if you want to be a A to B runner then i would suggest investing in a video recording device and see how you run.. you should be running like your doing high knees note physics   mass x acceleration = Force   <br>  this formula shows that your acceleration will increase your speed and you can do this by raising your knees higher... When i was training with my team mt Trainer Always said during 1 v 1 races "this is Technique vs Speed lets see who wins" and just to let you know Technique with Speed will win|`|AA12170560	Plyometrics are a great pre-sprint workout.<br>  Once you've completed a good evolution of short sprints...<br>  then move on to sprinting steps.<br>  <br>  Step work to fatigue or exhaust muscles is an ideal way to gain speed and explosivity.|`|Hkb7xoaQaa	Plyometrics, it's a type of exercise designed to produce fast and powerful movements. It involves a lot of jumping (Box jump, dot drills, broad jump, high jumps, even jump rope). If you combine this with a good lower body and core strength work outs your 40-time is guaranteed to go up, in high school my 40 went from 5.2 sophomore year to 4.6 at the end of my junior year (granted i never really worked out before my first timed 40, it still made a big difference). I topped out at 4.56 by my senior year. Get your abs as strong as you possibly can, if you can work with your track coach he can show you the parachute excercises and rope excerses, these resistant training excercises greatly increase your drive and explosion,(the parachute one made me work extra hard and it paid off.)|`|dKi2R2oHaa	You need to do lots of short sprints, twice a week, for a couple of months. There is no effective alternative. Even that may only get you down to 4.8, you can't be your genetics.<br>  <br>  Each session <br>  <br>  Run 1 km<br>  Stretches<br>  10 * 10m sprint (walk back between each)<br>  <br>  10 * 20m sprint (walk back between each)<br>  <br>  10 * 30m sprint (walk back between each)<br>  <br>  10 * 40m sprint (walk back between each)<br>  <br>  Run 1km <br>  <br>  Bounding can also help your technique and development if you are really serious.<br>  <br>  ===============<br>  <br>  This is  a pre-season regime, because it will take it out of you.|`|3IQq3FPSaa	All of those will help. I've had success using all of those at one time or another. I've also had success from running hills and sprints. Work on good form when you're running. It can mean running +/-  .2 or more on your 40 time. Practice running your 40 periodically so you can chart your progress. Working with a partner will help out tremendously b/c you will push each other. My cousin and I shaved almost .2 over spring and summer training. I went from running almost a 4.6 to a low 4.4. I even ran a 4.37! So with hard work it can be done! Good luck joe!|`|AA10404797	a good RB has good footwork , average speed like yours, and strength, if i were you i would focus more on how to get past people and how to get through people.|`|2pMVnCIpaa	I play for the University of Florida. Things that work for me:<br>  <br>  Keep your head still and concentrate on that. Keep your focus at the end line. Lower your center of gravity and stare down the finish line like an enemy or challenge. It's all about getting the adrenaline flowing. Another thing that works for me is I put my lips as if i'm drinking from a straw and i breathe very heavily every other step. It pushes you to get there faster. Take larger yet, choppier strides. The thought that always runs through my mind is one of the U.S. Marines slogans: The body can always do 80% more than it thinks it can. Train your mind. Its all about hard work and DETERMINATION.

v5MP0KJ8aa	A women's college team can not beat an average boys high school team so they're definitely not beating an all star team.

FpGDoRQiaa	Yeah, I can do it. But I find it a hard time finding monkey bars tall enough. I normally just can walk and hold them whilst going.<br>  <br>  Keep with the flow. Don't stop, just keep swinging and having a steady rhythm to it. I generally find stopping and trying to go to the next one is a lot harder. You'll need to obviously be able to hold your weight fairly well and have a decent grip. Same as everything, practice makes perfect. But as you raise that point, as my teacher said "Perfect practice, makes perfect". Meaning you need to practice the correct way to become perfect. Some possible ways to train would be to attempt to stay and hold onto them as long as possible, possibly doing chin-ups. But generally the idea is just doing it.|`|bqisLny9aa	well make sure you can hold yourself up. and make sure that your arms are strong enough to with hold your body weight. also having a good grip. you could use powder. and then just swing your body and reach for the next bar.

I totally recommend you to join soccer it is a ton of fun and it creates a lot of fun memories with teammates. Don't really worry about all the basics in detail and don't worry about being perfect because there will be conditioning and practice once you join that will prepare you to play and over time you'll just get better and better. You could however look up the rules and information like that to gain a better understanding of how the game goes because that's something that most likely they take as you already know. As far as choosing the position you play it depends they could ask you but most likely they will have a scrimmage in which you play a game and then the coaches will look at what position you fit best in. Hope this helps :) &+ Have fun : )

No, I had a dream once where me and Dan Haren went to Orlando Hudson's new soul food restaraunt!|`|xHc3KGDmaa	I can't wait for baseball season go BRAVES|`|6tGYe5roaa	I can't wait for baseball season to start. I love everything about the start of baseball. First off it is my favorite sport. It means the warmer weather is here or almost here. And it means that the semester is almost over. Seriously, what's not to love about the start of the baseball season? I just am sad because I will not be able to watch the Yankees first game. I have school.  :(<br>  <br>  BQ: That's not weird at all. I have had dreams about baseball players before.|`|8qtm4qkUaa	Yes, the start of the season still seems a long way off.<br>  <br>  But there's going to be some great ball played in the World Baseball Classic so this year it's not so much a test of the patience.<br>  <br>  Especially for an Aussie. Did you see the result of their match against Mexico? They had to invoke the mercy rule, the Aussies were so dominant! Great stuff.|`|P1bO87l1aa	I am ready for baseball.  I don't work on Monday so on April 6, I will be planted right in front of my TV for all of the opening day ceremonies (no body does opening day like St. Louis) and the Cardinals Pirates game.<br>  <br>  I don't recall ever dreaming of a baseball player but I wouldn't say it is unusual.|`|aUyopOWiaa	Yes!! On Opening Day I'm not going to school so I can watch some afternoon games and I'm going to the Twins game that night!<br>  <br>  EQ: Nope! I've had a few dreams about baseball players before. I had a dream once I was going to Target and when I got there Kevin Millar and Brian Roberts were there and I went up to Millar and just started talking, but I was too nervous to talk to Roberts. What the heck?? :)|`|5yZICXImaa	Oh yeah Im going to watch Halladay on opening day kick the Tigers buts. Its not weird to dream about a Baseball Player, I have dreams about baseball games all the time so thats like 18 players and a bunch of bench players.|`|V430UrvFaa	Of course I can't wait for baseball season to start, but right now the wbc is great to watch and any of the other players in spring training  need to shake off any rust they may have.|`|P93I8CHtaa	cant wait for giants season<br>  <br>  Extra Q;its not weird,its just something going on in your head i guess|`|utTFiz3gaa	You're not going to school? Well fortunately for me the angels' opener is a night game so i think i might get to see it on tv :D yay!!! I really want to go to a opener one day... <br>  <br>  and even if i find out i have to do something i shall do everything in my power to rearrange my schedule because reallly who misses opening day for crying out loud? ;)<br>  <br>  EQ: oh that's not as half as weird as mine, one time i dreamed about meeting Chase Utley (weird player choice because i don't really like him that much i mean he's a good player but he's not my favorite favorite you know?) The weirdest part was he was like really tall, like Dwight Howard tall and had an australian accent! O.o???<br>  <br>  p.s. I LOVE timmy's commercial its so funny! <br>  "our favorite color's green"<br>  "we like to be dominant with the fastball"<br>  "and we DON'T listen to that" <br>  lol|`|AA10263761	Yes Just Start<br>  <br>  EQ:I Have Dreams Of A-Rod Every Night..|`|1uSoU8Lpaa	I do! I do! The Brewers and I have a date for April 7th!<br>  <br>  EQ: Not at all, you dream about the things on your mind. Have you seen that 2K9 commercial with Lincecum, it's hilarious! Maybe that's why...unless you're a secret Giants fan.j/k I know you're a secret Brewers fan.<br>  <br>  I had a dream that Ryan Braun in I were in school together. School, dream about Braun and it has to do with school. Boring...|`|mml9J88caa	yes i can't wait!!<br>  i wish i could skip school.<br>  <br>  and no. i had a dream last week that i had to play catcher at a mariners game and was super nervous. and felix hernadez was pitching to me and i was really nervous and so he was telling me to relax. and instead of having paddings i just had about twenty pillows surrounding me. haha.|`|HtYGxZcCaa	id like it to start but I could bare without it because of March Madness in College Basketball,and the NBA Playoffs shortly following<br>  <br>  BQ-nope when I played baseball I dreamed of myself all the time lol,and the fact that I was in MLB|`|Ty4Hdm2Haa	Yes, I can't wait.  Baseball season is truly great.  I love football too but 16 games played mostly on weekends seems like only a part time thing.  162 games made up of 2-4 game mini series takes it to a whole other level.|`|pfuU6BQWaa	I want it to start sooooo badly!!!!!

gfmTgLDKaa	1) Be yourself.<br>  2) Always stay calm, never get frustrated, or angry, trust me it'll make you mess up more.<br>  3) If you mess up, don't worry just keep trying, nobody is perfect. <br>  4) Tip, show off your good moves near the coach, :D.<br>  5) If it is indoor, and trust me I know how bad it is indoor. Keep the ball on the ground, don't try any of the fancy footwork. Keep the ball stable and just slide it around.<br>  6) Save the fancy foot work on the outside field, just show how good you can perform the basics. A good basic, is a good foundation, the coaches love that.<br>  7) When you pass, do inside passes, they are more accurate in indoor soccer, if your comfortable like me playing indoor ( I play indoors a lot more than outdoors) make those long accurate passes, they impress the coaches especially since it's indoor.<br>  8) Just have fun, it's just a game, and your there to have fun!<br>  9) Good Luck! Hope you make it! :D|`|5w2CJehZaa	dont curve your foot when you shoot.<br>  dont put it on an angle like <br>  |<br>  |---<br>  lol those ---s is your foot<br>  just shoot with your foot vertically, and smash the ball as hard as you can<br>  a hard shot will always impress the coach.<br>  also, if its in the gym, make short give n go passes if you can.|`|BSlVGJ62aa	Sorry can't help.

Brad Hawpe was good in '07 but has been underachieving the past year.
9wItgN6Taa	One thing which is great for handstands is push-ups, they work all the basic muscles you need for a handstand. Also pull-ups work great, even better if u can find a wall then do a handstand but rest your heels and some of the back of ur calve on the wall to gain balance. Also pushu-ups in this position work great as well|`|lRFjaAfoaa	well you need to stay tight, tighter that anything Lol you don't need any balance or arm strength. if you feel your about to fall walk towards the direction your about to fall towards|`|X3QBqLSHaa	you don't need arm strength you need balance and core strength|`|PTWnWkPRaa	If you are having issues staying up and fall (not on back) try looking up to the ceiling when you are doing your handstand. It will help you get up easier. Try working on your core and arm strength.|`|djNeNEOuaa	All you need is a 5 or 10 pound weight plate, a strong thin rope about 3 feet long and a 6-8 inch stick or bar. Securely fasten the rope to the middle of the bar/stick and tie the other end of the rope to the weight plate. To begin this exercise, grab the bar/stick with both hands using an overhand grip. Extend both arms straight out in front of you, parallel to the floor. Next, roll the weight up from the floor by rapidly twisting the bar/stick with your hands and wrists. Once the weight reaches the top, slowly lower the plate back to the floor by reversing the motion of your hands and wrists.<br>  <br>  If you find that you can't balance you may need to work on some core exercises. Try some of these the Bridge, Side Bridge, High to Low Woodchoppers,  Low to High Woodchoppers, V-Ups. You can find out how to do them here:|`|Bu0TePOUaa	u dont need much arm strength to get in the handstand position, the stronger you are though the longer you can stay up, or the further you can walk on your hands. <br>  To gain arm strength...lift weights.|`|e8649657b804fea365c29625450c4610aa	i think it is more balance than arm strength. i would think your shoulders play an important role, so try strengthening your shoulders and see how that works|`|K0LvwAmJaa	no, u dont rly need much arm strength for a handstand, but u do need balance
tzrLDbHWaa	He's not really any good.  I mean, what did he do to even deserve a head coaching job?  He was in Oakland and won like 20% of his games, he doesn't do well in the playoffs, and he's never been any good anywhere he's been.  No offense to the Chargers, but they didn't deserve the playoffs last year.  They had a good team, but 8-8 is not playoff worthy.  There were 4 teams with equal or better records that missed the playoffs because they weren't lucky enough to be in an awful division.  In his previous 9 years he made 1 playoff appearance.  The ONLY reason he actually makes the playoffs in San Diego is because he inherited a 14-2 team.<br>  <br>  As for people hating on AJ Smith, do you realize you wouldn't even have a contending team if it wasnt for Smith.  Yeah, he let go of Drew Brees, but thats because you have Philip Rivers.  Wtf is a team going to do with 2 top QBs, pay one top dollar to one to sit on the bench, yeah, thats smart.  If it weren't for Smith, you probably wouldn't have Rivers, and even if you did, you wouldnt have gotten the extra picks that got you Merriman and Kaeding along with it if it weren't for his trade.  You probably wouldn't have LT either, instead you'd be the team dealing with the whole Vick thing.  I really don't see why you're hating on him.  He built a team that was the worst in football and people didn't want to go to, into a contender.|`|MxHIdyVAaa	does well in the playoffs?  you can't say a team does well in the playoffs unless they're in super bowls.<br>  norv turner is an idiot.  any team that makes the playoffs with an 8-7 record is just PURE lucky.  as a matter of fact, as much as i hate the Patriots, I FELT snubbed when they're 11-5 record wasn't good enough.<br>  Norv Turner is a crack-pot.  He doesn't know how to control his players, and doesn't discourage their disrespectful behavior.|`|rjuqrHK7aa	I agree with what a charger player said last season. He is a good offensive coordinator. It was Kassim Osgood.|`|AA11502346	I still think Marty is the better coach for some reason.|`|8wmjYlfaaa	He has a funny name.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  and i really don't like him, he's ruining a great football team with lots of talent.|`|gBfPkdroaa	hmm i dont like aj smith ill give you that, he let go of so many good players<br>  -rodney harrison, dree brees, etc.<br>  <br>  but turner isnt so bad...as a HEAD coach..hmmm i like him better an offensive coordinator.|`|drhWMyoWaa	Its the chargers, the Owner gonna screw them anyway|`|YPQTXOQ5aa	One of the best offensive coordinators in the game, but as a head coach not so great.|`|ILW3vkhEaa	better offensive coordinator than a head coach|`|gRXy66dOaa	They should have stayed with Marty|`|7RziqsDcaa	They should have kept that Marty Schottenheimer guy who got them the 14-2 record in his last season with them

P3Hec0Olaa	I think you should just type "ninjitsu" in google search and the name of the state you are in.|`|3DnX9NmAaa	There are some Bujinkan dojo that have an age limit. Try to find another dojo in your area, or just wait until you're old enough to join that one.<br>  <br>  Don't listen to Lindz or Tim, they apparently know nothing about Bujinkan Budo Taijutsu.<br>  <br>  Lindz, just because you receive a 7th kyu greenbelt from a crappy instructor doesn't make you qualified to deem a martial art as worthless. The training is the way it is for a reason.|`|6p9I889Iaa	That's ok ninjutsu is BS.  They train 100% compliantly.  You never perform your skills against a resisting opponent.  So you won't be able to pull them off if you really need them.  And they can teach you all kinds of stuff that looks like it works (because you can do it wheny ou're going slow with a compliant uke) but doesn't work for real.  <br>  Take up something real instead.  Make sure there's lots of sparring and you'll be on the right track.<br>  <br>  Dear Bujinkan Ninja I do know what I'm talking about.  I got my 7th kyu (pretty sure it was seventh got the green belt the patch and then one or 2 stars to put over it) in Bujinkan from Richard Norman Sensei in New Westminister Canada.  We trained soft and compliantly.  Just like Hatsumi wanted us to.  Hai play does not make you a fighter.|`|xQ6KwzhMaa	I would advise that you do not pursue ninjutsu as a martial art; Bujinkan or any other style. Their methods of training are completely compliant and fail to develop skills which are applicable to real-life combat. Any martial art which does not involve regular, hard sparring is worthless. If you want to learn to fight, you need to fight. Most Bujinkan practicioners have never sparred in their life, because their instructors claim that sparring is 'too dangerous' for their style. The reality is that their techniques crumble under the pressure of fast, hard combat. <br>  <br>  Watch this. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YVaG9BL0hw" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YVaG9BL0...</a>
VkXrImFwaa	The players ahead of KOBE would be Michael Jordan, Wilt Chamberlein, Shaq (for now, kobe has years left to pass him), Oscar Robertson, Magic Johnson, Kareem, Bill Russell...... So i guess that would make Kobe #8 all-time. But Kobe is still in his prime... he has got many years ahead of him and a couple more championships to win.  He could easily move into the top five.|`|13XU8cCKaa	9,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,99...|`|yWcPOTsAaa	Easily in the top 10 with MJ, Magic, Kareem, Wilt, West, Dr J, Big O, Russell, Cousy.|`|zoDEqv6Zaa	Most of the haters can't even answered this question with an open mind, they just go to the rape allegation and ballhogged, lol losers. Since you said skills as the base of the answered, Kobe skills set is the best in the league right now and probably on par with Jordan skills set. This man game skills is just above everyone else right now, plus he's the best closer in the league. If the game is on the line, Kobe is your man and his skills is far beyond the league. The most skills player in the league is Kobe Bryant.|`|04kzGYL9aa	Behind Shaq, Lebron and, Nowitzi in every category except rape and ballhogged points.|`|tloiSeoQaa	8 all time|`|6yoQhXsOaa	100

Yslq4OYhaa	Wow, that was a lot for your first lesson. Yes, it does get easier the more you practice. It is usually physically demanding when you first begin. You will get stronger. You will get better at off balancing (kuzushi). It is a good thing they teach it both sides. At one time many schools didn't teach the left side until you reached advanced ranks. My instructor taught us left first. It confused a lot of people the we competed against. The group came in under me we began teaching them both side from day one. I had the opportunity to meet, train, and randori with O' Sensei (Phil Porter), he complimented us on our use of the left handed grip.<br>  <br>  Keep practicing and you will have a lot of fun.|`|xQ6KwzhMaa	It gets much, much easier after a while. All the complicated stuff will soon become natural and eventually you wont even think about it; it is the same with any technical discipline. Judo is trained very intensely and against resisting opponents, so you will have a lot of opportunities to develop your techniques into smooth, fluent transitions, throws and submissions. Don't worry, just keep training regularly, eat well, and get lots of sleep.|`|KCLr2cRGaa	yes, it should get easier more you practice.|`|CCtqtnzlaa	the best advice i could give you is to keep practicing . it will become a habit once you get used to it and master it after a few year <br>  (or months ) .|`|46YTN2BYaa	Clinch your fist when you grip. I broke a few fingers not gripping like a pit-bull.|`|hQWucH5uaa	Yes.  Judo does get easier the more you practice.<br>  <br>  Ask this same question 10 years from now.
ztT2d60faa	I just ordered a pair of Victory's a week ago and they are really big.

But that name was used long time ago.|`|7BIiofbaaa	eh, it depends where you are. Some academies are better than clubs and vice-versa.

3Wj8ZDMXaa	if i were u id be a corner back in football. u may be small. but thats wat i played and u can still block the reciever good. but if he catches it then u can take out his legs and tackle him for a short lloss instead of a long one|`|h2X7sNn6aa	i would try for wide receiver or running back. You could get a lot of the short passes and screens. Just like Wes Walker. And he gets 90 to 100 catches that way. Or running back. If your fast its going to be hard for the defense to see you running behind the offensive line.|`|e95c60def7314e19e9021c46eaa5fea1aa	Try Safety, you may be small but you can work on your speed and get stronger to be a good safety, or corner back|`|A5FjN63Uaa	Wrestling.  Then you could be the 5ft tall guy everyone in your school would fear, lol.|`|W7hMHyVuaa	If football is what you feel you want to do than be my guest.

Be safe.|`|yWcPOTsAaa	Gymnastics or Wrestling|`|ZVSZZ6qHaa	Water boy.  You should try something else because you are going to get hurt.
6nRVGNl7aa	ya im getting a little tired of the same ppl getting the titles, edge cena and hhh even though all three are great all-around I getting a little tired of seeing the belt on them, I would rather see the undertaker, hbk and rey and maybe even throw randy in there too but the same three ppl are getting old.<br>  <br>  I would LOVE to see jeff with it and keep it a while but I like the whole bro v bro they are building up fro WM 25<br>  <br>  :)|`|6ueL0gkAaa	Koko didnt contribute enough and wasnt a big enough name to get into the HOF.

GERlmBIUaa	I no im so proud of us pistons... i think that we can stay a solid 6 seed for the play offs and ai will lead us to atleast the second round... cuz the magic are up and down...best answer plz<br>  <br>  Edit: Lol matt update ur records...|`|EM6hbihFaa	k so Rip Hamilton has been forced to the bench and Allen Iverson replaced him.. great move huh?  Iverson's shoot first mentality has the team more focused on him rather than the old Piston way.  Pass for the open shot.  Rasheed has not had a great year and that also has contributed to the lack of wins because of the forced three point and deep shots.  Another downfall to the Pistons season has been Rodney Stuckey.  Sure he is extremely athletic and quick but he has no experience on how to run a team from the point.  He cost turnovers and helps force Allen into shooting the shots that he does which therefore has cost the Pistons offense and defense because of the quick fast paced backcourt and slow frontcourt|`|qtwYHyH5aa	The pistons are a very good team, if they knew how to use AI they would of been at the top of the EAST.|`|rYqBGkwjaa	You take good teams seriously, but when you play bad teams you don't.<br>  <br>  That is a problem with a lot of good teams.|`|sjnzoERfaa	u guys are 31-30 with a .508 winning percentage so u guys are average stop talking like u guys are the best|`|JsVZQkWyaa	you guys never one against the hawks we swept yall. but you guys had a hell of game beating the magic
RiFtRVs8aa	I like it but the Jericho match is harsh. Like he faces so much legends just to get the Intercontinental Championship. UM.... Dont think so.<br>  <br>   Overall good match card.|`|3o8jPdWQaa	Good except Orton vs HHH is probably a street fight<br>  Hardy vs Hardy Hardcore match<br>  Jericho vs one of the legends voted by the fans throughout the night.
NRs72Afxaa	Ignore those people. Here is some advice for them. I admit wrestling was great back in those days, but those days are over. You can still watch those memories on Dailymotion. I believe their will be another good wrestling era but thats is something to remain to be seen and when it does come will be ready to enjoy. <br>  <br>  This Raw in my opinion was the best of 2009 so far. The starting point was epic, and the ending was exciting. The best match was the 6 man tag match, but the worst was Marse vs Melina.<br>  <br>  WQ1: So far I've been enjoying this program. It has made me look forward to this friday.<br>  <br>   Note: Didn't that segment remind you of the Austin/Pillman gun segment. It almost looked like the same house in my opinion. Now thats Deja Vu.<br>  <br>  WQ2: The storyline should of ended after Summerslam. Looks like we might see a Big show and Vickie love storyline, but lets hope not.<br>  <br>  Wq3:Now thats a way to start off a show. Undertaker finally got to use his mic work which really helped the storyline.These two have good chemistry together on this mic since 1997. I'm looking forward to the tag team match. It would be a good match next week,|`|uS8hK7Zhaa	NO you wouldn't. <br>  <br>  1. Excellent, best thing in WWE now<br>  2. It was disgustingly funny to me, lol. It can go on for a little while longer<br>  3. Epic. No words can describe|`|F3lyP5XLaa	Taker/HBK  Thats the best mach for  Wrestle Mania|`|a3z7ZjVtaa	Yeah, I mean it's still noticeable at times but when that's all you hear about is it being PG it makes a lot harder to forget/overlook. <br>  <br>  WA1: Yeah, It's been awesome. It makes WWE so much more interesting.<br>  <br>  WA2: YESSSS! It has gotten really old, boring, and predictable.  <br>  <br>  WA3: I love it, I especially liked Takers promo before his entrance. Its goin to be a great match. Taker & HBK are the only ones left that were on the 1st episode of RAW. Now they get to wrestle each other on the grandest stage of them all in their home state.|`|AP5bCHA3aa	Its just because its before Wrestlemania dude<br>  <br>  I think the build up of the orton/hhh fued is perfect<br>  <br>  Yes I hope the edge nd vicki love storyline is finally over nd I think it will be :)<br>  <br>  I was shocked, I havnt seen shock like that on the undertakers face in awhile|`|PJH9vHf1aa	Yes it's all good. I do hope the stupid storyline with Edge and Vicky is over.|`|5qqko0DOaa	YOU'RE RIGHT I THINK|`|TAPBWPJLaa	Not really.<br>  <br>  I didn't watch it, but from what people told me, it seemed like nothing different from what WWE was doing years ago.<br>  <br>  WQ1: I guess it's fine as it is. HHH does need to look weaker against The Legacy, though.<br>  <br>  WQ2: No. In fact, I was thinking Cena being thrown into it with Big Show would actually create some much needed controversy and add a hilarious twist. The fact that people hate it shows that Edge and Vickie Guerrero can continue to be the most hated entity on SmackDown.<br>  <br>  WQ3: From what I heard, it was bad, mainly the Undertaker's part of it. The Undertaker shouldn't be talking much anyways, not because he's bad at promos but because his character doesn't need to talk. He looks weaker every time he speaks.|`|rphR4pXKaa	I like th build up for Orton and HHH cause now it's getting really personal and out of the ring!!! And I think majority of the fans love seeing Orton get kicked around by HHH.....Well I know I do!<br>  <br>  I hope the Edge and Vicki thing is done and buried I sick of that sh*t now! lame lame lame. I like how they added Show to the mix though....sweet...<br>  <br>  Taker HBK promo was cool Cant wait for that match!!!!! YEAH!!!!|`|0Dm3WEMcaa	If you paid close attention you would notice the little differences but the TV rating doesn't affect the writing, is heroes a good show because of its writing or the tv rating? Point proved.<br>  <br>  WQ1: Too fast for me, how can they keep this pace up for the next 3/4 weeks? <br>  <br>  WQ2: yeah now we get a love scorned story of edge getting revenge on Show, anything is better than Edge/Vickie<br>  <br>  WQ3: I was kind of disappointed both seemed to stumble over there words a bit but it was still a brilliant moment
3o8jPdWQaa	Yea, they shouldve made the actress who was playing ortons wife a better actress, that actress was just really bad at acting. but the other parts were really intense|`|VlvektSJaa	Still, very good.|`|GQWGLSexaa	i still enjoy it tho|`|uS8hK7Zhaa	Who cares? We all know it's a TV show. I honestly can care less if it was his real house/wife or not. It was still good|`|935636d3b6664dec7ea7a99f58de4023aa	wasnt an actress it was his real wife and that is why she couldnt act.  and also i LOVE wrestling but isnt it all "scripted" aka "fake".  and on top of that it still was one of the best story line progressions in recent wwe history.|`|8pAjkFZJaa	what was so "fake" abt it. i loved the ending. you actually think orton is going to let paul smash up his real house hahahhaahhah. why is this bothering ppl so mutch<br>  <br>  watch this<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48T_Y8Bj_rI" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48T_Y8Bj_...</a>|`|UYPfC5YVaa	Whether you continuously saying that wrestling is fake.

65e0c93e39fac0974cefe1be5c93b58daa	Ok, seriously, first thing is first:  go to math class!  That goes for the other answer as well.  If each lap is 400m (standard outdoor track), then 7 laps are 2800m.<br>  <br>  Now to the meat of the question.  Yes, it will get easier.  It sounds like you've already got the thing you need most, the thing that's hard to teach:  you won't give up.  These early workouts are designed to make the kids who aren't serious leave.  The coach doesn't want to waste their time on runners who aren't there to give their best.<br>  <br>  By the time you read this, no doubt you will be home from your 2nd workout.  If you keep running, it will get easier, you will adjust.  Not only that, you will lose weight (especially at 70 mins a day!).  Just go out, give 100%, and do the workouts the way they are designed.  When it comes time to race, think back on how hard these early workouts were, and use that to bring confidence about how tough you are and how you refuse to quit.<br>  <br>  Good luck, I hope you have a great first season!<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  Dave E - 3rd place?  Awesome.  I'm running my first one next month.|`|Jr9j5f6naa	(7 laps would be 2000 meters, each lap is 400 meters.) <br>  <br>  it sounds like your coach is doing this so that people WILL quit...well, not that she wants people to, but to see who would quit easily and who would stick with it. and yes, it will get a lot easier quickly. remember to drink a lot of water through out the day, (just not an hour or less before) stretch, all that, and it'll be easier in no time.|`|1UID5JtNaa	yea the laws of physiology are in your favor- keep running and your fitness improves- unless you get injured first.   Stick it out and see how your body responds- some get fitter faster than others.  Unfortunately, if you have weight to lose it will probably take longer.  <br>  <br>  My best advice is to run at your own pace- let the others go, and walk if you have to.  Distance covered is more important than speed at this point.  I am impressed with your attitude.
Cl6KbcAGaa	NO, not in this economy!|`|DOVbF4Piaa	I don't think they do, if you want to join a junior cycling club look for one in your area.  You can try out for the teams when you get older.

QBdO8VYlaa	haha yes this raw was craaazy, ending was AMAZING. the only thing better than 2nights raw is TiVo ;-)|`|srSbVHyqaa	Boring:<br>  <br>  Just a re-hash of the "Pillman has a gun" set up from many years back. Possibly the same house too. That COULD mean that so far the following people have lived here: Randy Orton, Steve Austin, Jake Roberts, Mr Perfect, Jerry Lawler and the Brooklyn Brawler (why not?)<br>  <br>  WWE have done the "home crash" for years. Doing it again now doesn't impress me any more than when they did it the first time around.<br>  <br>  To the guy who was watching axmen.... probably a better call watching that.|`|cLWOtPeYaa	That was a good ending.

rseD4OG2aa	Trish Stratus seems like the most likely candidate, but I wouldn't like it if Mae Young came out again. I mean, I'm not trying to be disrespectful or anything, but they keep repeating the same thing with her over and over again. It's like a Triple H title reign.<br>  I would pick Trish Stratus. I've heard that she's going to come back to face Michelle McCool and the battle royal seems like the perfect place for that to happen. I'll bet you that Lita comes back as well. <br>  I would like to see one of the regular roster divas win it, as long as it isn't Beth Phoenix. WWE management hasn't pushed another diva in like, two years. <br>  My personal favorite is Mickie James, I've always really liked her. But she isn't being pushed right now so I wouldn't count on her winning. Past divas like Trish and Lita probably wouldn't come back if they weren't going to do something big so one of them seems the most likely.|`|yEsw7UkWaa	Lita won't be there because she was invited to attend the charity thing being run by Booker T.<br>  So I guess it will be down to either Michelle Mc(not so)Cool, who they seem to be pushing alot lately, or Gail Kim.<br>  <br>  And sticking with the whole sophomoric prom theme, Miss WM will close the event by dancing with Mr. WM|`|3o8jPdWQaa	Maybe Lita if she returns but yea probably trish or mcCool|`|a3z7ZjVtaa	My guesses would be:<br>  Mae Young, Trish Stratus, Sunny, or Lita(doubt it though)|`|8pAjkFZJaa	They are really pushing mcCool.

4Td7hgqBaa	Well, if we take notice of James129 no player should ever move or chase a future with any club other than the first club they sign up with. David Beckham has lifted the profile of football in the U.S. and has also helped the Galaxy raise it's profile around the world. These are positives for U.S. football. David Beckham has a reel chance to make the England squad but to keep his game at the level required he must play with and against teams that will continually demand the best. Unfortunately when you play at a lower grade or level your own game will suffer.The U.S. must keep looking for positives to bring them up as a world power in the world game. Remember that American clubs have paid a lot of cash for top world players in the past but none have lifted the profile of football in the U.S. any where as near as David Beckham. And James those players you mentioned as being ok, well the money they sucked out of the fans could run a country the size of Australia. Good luck Beck's.|`|1fwo8HqMaa	I agree 100% with this dude james|`|dBsOqHjsaa	The question is not that he wants to stay , but rather how fast he will tuck his high yellow tail and leave? I say go now don't bother coming back I'd rather the galaxy let him leave on a free transfer so we never have to deal with his likes again. He is no leader or ambassador for the american game, he has not the testicular fortitude to lead a team from the depths of mediocracy to glory of championships! He couldn't do it for england he will never do it at club level. He needs other great players around him to even function. Here in america we have athletes that put their teams on their backs, rise to the occasion and make others around them better for the greater cause. Jordan, montana, gretzky to name a few. Those are all team sportsmen and they refused to give up unlike this trash of a person beckyham.|`|7BIiofbaaa	Of course he does, that's why he requested to be let go by the galaxy instead of an extension of his loan. Trust me, at the end of the MLS season, he'll be wanting to go back to Milan again.

0b3fb66208fb224508015af3d7cd6ff6aa	Bonjour à tous.<br>  <br>  Voici la règle telle qu'elle est écrite sur le site de la FIFA:<br>  <<<br>  Un joueur se trouve en position de hors-jeu quand il est plus près de la ligne de but adverse qu’à la fois le ballon et l’avant-dernier adversaire <br>  Un joueur ne se trouve pas en position de hors-jeu quand : <br>  - il se trouve dans sa propre moitié de terrain ou<br>  - il se trouve à la même hauteur que l’avant-dernier adversaire ou<br>  - il se trouve à la même hauteur que les deux derniers adversaires <br>  >><br>  <br>  Alors maintenant, comment juge t'on qu'un joueur est sur la même ligne ou non? La base du cou? la ligne des épaules? eh bien non!! <br>  Voici la règle:<br>  <br>  <<<br>  Dans la définition de la position de hors-jeu, l’expression ? plus près de la ligne de but adverse ? signifie que n’importe quelle partie de la tête, du corps ou des pieds du joueur est plus près de la ligne de but adverse qu’à la fois le ballon et l’avant-dernier adversaire. Les bras ne sont pas inclus dans la définition.<br>  >><br>  <br>  Donc si le bras de l'attaquant dépasse, pas de hors-jeu.<br>  Si la tête dépasse, hors-jeu.<br>  Donc, ici, hors-jeu de Wiltord.<br>  <br>  Rappel: Lyon a pris un but à Marseille dimanche sur un hors-jeu non sifflé<br>  <br>  Alors le débat devrait plut?t etre le suivant: comment voulez-vous que l'arbitre de touche puisse juger du hors jeu (d'autant plus quand la passe vient de 20m ou +)|`|1981022cd110a73fde341a32cf08588daa	pas besoin de regarder on l as tous vu sauf que comme tous les arbitres aulas avait du le payer!!<br>  c pas pour rien qu ils sont toujours premier et chaque année c la meme chose!! moi je dis quand est ce que quelqu un aura le courage de le dire publiquement|`|5650ed27dbe4ffa60ec2ff05f5b706f3aa	ouai y avait hors jeu !! moi je suis pour l'arbitrage video, grace a cela le psg aurait peur etre pu gagner !|`|5f2dedc085d41d657478c862fdefcfc8aa	Il y a eu des erreurs d'arbitrage dans les deux camps ...<br>  Le carton rouge que l'arbitre ne met pas a rodriguez, la simulation qui entraine le peno<br>  jusque ici, sans erreur d'arbitrage, il y aurai un 10 contre 11, et 0 partout<br>  Puis evidement ce hors jeux.<br>  Au total, l'arbitre n'a t'il pas fait des betises des deux cotés ?|`|69166e0df4086700ea986a3bdaa7be8daa	deja c dur d'etre arbitre assistant...il a couru pdt 80 minutes et il etait mal placé...ceci di ca arrive|`|a07f7677c77cc20ae13af16f7a220cc3aa	Le probleme n'est pas l'horloge ou pas <br>  il est que tant que la FiFa ne voudra pas de la vidéo, on pourra toujours contesté tel ou tel but ou hors jeu ou faute etc etc etc....<br>  <br>  Blatter n'a t-il pas declaré lors d'australie-Italie que le fait de discuter le penalty Italien "faisait parler du match dans les demeures".<br>  Doit vraiment  y avoir du fric enorme en jeu pour oser dire cela.<br>  <br>  Remarquer, suffit de voir comment est devenu Platini pour voir qu'il ne manque rien a manger a la FiFa|`|a6a4b0cc97e403af25a279d21584dd97aa	OUI  et  OUI .|`|d75af4a6ed8da836613bc399a271c140aa	Wilou a marqué à la 88ème pas à la 90 + 2ème c'est bizzare par rapport à ton image, ce n'est pas celle de l'action du but|`|23f98fa8dd993f9a9571ae759445a4d9aa	C'est sur qu'il est HJ...

Dommage , mais c'est joué !|`|10f17853d1ffb00769e8613b375f6d59aa	Il y a hors-jeu mais de pas beaucoup. Le ballon partant de loin, il est toujours difficile pour un arbitre de voir le départ du ballon et la position du joueur en meme temps. Faut pas etre trop rageux, si Paris était réellemnt meilleur il n'y aurait pas du y avoir de second but après. <br>  Et puis pour le penalty accordé a Paris on voit quand meme que rodriguez vient s'empaler sur Vercoutre. Alors penalty à la rigueur vu que le choc entre les deux l'empeche de jouer le ballon mais pour ceux qui réclament un carton rouge c'est un peu de la mauvaise foi car toutes les équipes sont unanimes pour dire que la sanction qu'est le penalty suffit et qu'il n'est pas obligé de sortir le goal.|`|3b9c8e3b0d54f5745200d5b385943c0caa	horss-jeu celui qui le voyait il était aveugle|`|74678fae2b568b54c1ae6a23b553d1b4aa	Cette action ne correpond pas au but lyonnais car regarde le temps en haut à gauche 90+2........alors que le but lyonnais a été inscrit à la 88e minute.............|`|af3977be0071cf8b3ad5c47fea843cc0aa	Ton histoire d'horloge me laisse perplexe, mais bon...

bSsBGrZVaa	Koko B. Ware<br>  ---<br>  I think that WWE made the right decision for inducting him<br>  into WWE hall of fame & i know that he is a semi-retired wrestler<br>  but i know that Koko B. Ware has been working in wrestling industry<br>  for a longtime during his legendry career he has achieved enough<br>  & his major achievements are NWA Mid-America Heavyweight Championship<br>  & USWA Unified Heavyweight Championship but he had a great<br>  success in tag team division in old times & he is also a former<br>  NWA united states tag team champion,AWA southern tag team champion<br>  & USWA world tag team champion & i know that Koko B. Ware was<br>  never a main-eventer but i think that he is one of the most hard-working<br>  person's in wrestling history thats the reason WWE has inducted him<br>  i have never watched his legendry career because i was started to be<br>  a wrestling fan since 1996 but i know that what makes a real legend<br>  like Koko B. Ware & i am totally satisfied with WWE hall of fame because<br>  they have given wrestling fans such a legendry class of 2009 & it rules|`|XEGBUFwAaa	Yes, it is cool.<br>  <br>  R.I.P Frankie.

iVd1pNNCaa	search the net for gyms in your area, check the yellow pages.  You will come up with something quickly unless you live in the middle of nowhere.|`|dc6f042f0a1f241b0647713f95aefc3aaa	There is no art to MMA. It is a sport. That being said just look in your yellow pages or search your local area in Yahoo. At 15 you should know how to do that. I would recommend that you find a real martial arts school instead of an MMA type school since your post actually is about learning real martial arts and not MMA. MMA is all about fighting in the cage to win events. It has no philosophy, no art...it is just a sport that borrows techniques from the real martial arts. Good luck.|`|W0NpcICwaa	mma is a sport <br>  it consists of all kinds of martial arts <br>  u can learn techniqes online using this link- <a href="http://www.mixedmartialarts.com/?go=training.browse&l1=164" rel="nofollow">http://www.mixedmartialarts.com/?go=trai...</a>

ULSUqmeZaa	Orton hit Triple H first. Orton came out from the closet and hit Triple H first so technically HHH was physically provoked.

This is going great, better than anything in WWE for a while. They're not going to take him out of WM|`|AP5bCHA3aa	Triple H would pedigree his wife to go to wrestlemania|`|yl86ZQ6Daa	YES orton provoked him so HHH will still be @ wrestle mania...|`|F3lyP5XLaa	IT WAS FAKE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|CC3FZj9Caa	I hope so...Triple H would have to forfit title. So vacant WWE Championship to be defended. Randy Orton vs. ???? Out comes Triple H's protege, the same man who was put out by Randy Orton....BATISTA!!!!! And within 5 mins Batista destroys Orton and Priceless to win the WWE Championship at WM25!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
nHlf8vDYaa	Yes. My friend does gymnastics and says that her legs get sore and cramp when she works really hard or too much. Don't push yourself too much.

8e35cfeded3c3b900607388410347b4caa	Aside from knowing the frames per second, you could get a rough calculation by estimating the rider's apogee. <br>  <br>  You know that gravitational acceleration is 32 feet per second per second, and you know that the rider is not accelerating once his rear wheel leaves the ramp.   <br>  <br>  Estimating the speed in the second to last shot will be difficult because the ramps appear to be of different heights, and I didn't see any clear height reference points.  <br>  <br>  No, I'm not going to do the math for you.<br>  ---<br>  Edit: Now that I think about it, wheel diameter is probably the only reasonable size/distance reference available in the picture.|`|DOVbF4Piaa	There is no way to tell, for a science project you need accurate measurements.|`|AA10615355	Do you know how many frames per second the camera is?

OkCUxhuxaa	Congrats for joining your high school team. You will improve a lot through the season.<br>  <br>  Okay, so as for freestyle, it's wonderful once you get down the rhythm. Here are some pointers<br>  <br>  -Keep your body parallel to the surface of the water <br>  <br>  -Keep your kicking on the surface (not in the air and not fully in the water).<br>  <br>  -Keep your head DOWN. "Chin to the skin" they call it. It's much more efficient.<br>  <br>  -Big, fast arms.Pull, pull, pull!!<br>  <br>  -High elbows on those arms and pull your fingertips past your hips.<br>  <br>  -Rotate your body from side to side! You will cover more distance this way!<br>  <br>  -Try to take as few breaths as possible. This does mean not to breathe right before or right after your flip turn.<br>  <br>  -Tight, fast flip turns. Dolphin kick off the wall (on your side).These little things can make or break a race. <br>  <br>  -Make sure your dive is good. Get out far and shallow, not deep and close. <br>  <br>  -Believe in yourself. Set your goals high and don't swim away from them. Reward yourself after the hard practices and good races. Talk with your coach after every race. Congratulate the people that beat you. Don't be rude to those you beat. Have fun at meets. Hydrate. Eat up. Swim fast, always!!<br>  <br>  No pain, no gain.<br>  <br>  Best of luck, swimmer! <br>  Manda|`|voaMM1GQaa	Okay. Well That breathing is probably a big factor, because every time you move your head you lose momentum. But if you just joined, it's likely you have some other technique problems, as well.<br>  Make sure:<br>  -You're rotating your shoulders in coordination with your strokes.<br>  - You're keeping your head facing forward in the water, not down.<br>  -You're getting good pull with your stroke.<br>  -You keep a ferocious flutter kick going at all times.<br>  <br>  Those are just some classic mistakes, and as for your breathing... unfortunately the only way to improve this is by getting in better cardiovascular shape. Try swimming outside of practice on your own at a rec center, and doing Pyramid Sets (you should know what these are if you're on a team,, if not add add. info to your question and I'll explain.) Make sure you go from 8x 25 Meters with 10 seconds rest between up to 1x200 Meters. and then back down. It will be difficult, but you will get better. furthermore, try breathing every third as much as you can. Also really hard but you will improve faster than if you breath every other stroke during the entire thing.<br>  <br>  Best of luck!<br>  Any additional questions, please add into your question.|`|KsZQQkBfaa	Try doing no breathers- swim underwater for a lap (or as far as possible) without breathing.<br>  <br>  Then you just need to change your habit. Breath every third stroke so you get accustomed to breathing on both sides.  <br>  It's going to feel awkward but you just have to force yourself.<br>  <br>  Make sure your body is straight and you rotate your shoulders. Take long strokes and just keep working.|`|6shdQtghaa	pyramid sets and no breathers, especially underwater kicks. These will improve your breath holding skills!
VlvektSJaa	NWO would own|`|FGmEoXw9aa	why not Cody, Ted, and Randy vs.<br>  Dusty Rhodes, "Million Dollar Man" Ted Debiasi, and Cowboy Bob Ortan. Now thats more like it.|`|d89nMnu6aa	daft question never mind there prime the NWO would beat legacy today cos hogan hardly ever loses lol.|`|uS8hK7Zhaa	Cody and Ted haven't even reached their prime yet, so that's an unfair comparison. Of course it would be Hogan, Hall, and Nash|`|AA11482019	The New World Order  would beat Legacy.|`|khU8m4gxaa	As already said above, the Legacy are far from reaching their prime, even Randy, so it's an impossible comparison. If you compare Hogan, Hall & Nash during the NWO days to the Legacy, then the NWO was far more dominant. The Legacy would be better than Hogan, Hall, & Nash now, considering that Hogan & Hall are inactive & Nash is way past his prime.

uS8hK7Zhaa	So what? It's a TV show. I wouldn't have known his house or wife was fake if none of you said anything about it. They storyline is about Triple H and Randy Orton. None of the other stuff even matters<br>  <br>  <br>  I still thought the ending was great!|`|wMh38OzVaa	I know what U mean.They kind of jumped the shark this week.It was great but only if you don't think about it to much.|`|AA10691319	i actually thought it had more of shades of 'pilman's got a gun' to it|`|xKXu0Qb2aa	Do do do do , Do do do do , Do do do do....<br>  <br>  <br>  Ending? - Try Pillman/Austin Horrible Rip-Off...|`|KWtjVW9saa	It was an exacting ending, even though the screams were fake.|`|85aWKsptaa	Orton is a jackass|`|3o8jPdWQaa	Lol yea. it wasnt his real house you know lol. It wouldve sucked seeing everything in your house get destroyed in front of you. It was just a fake. And ortons wife was a really bad actress, it seemed like she never bliinked or looked scared when HHH confronted her.|`|VlvektSJaa	Haha agreed!<br>  <br>  Also fake police!!<br>  <br>  Where did HHH actually go?<br>  <br>  Far beyond.<br>  <br>  Welcome.<br>  <br>  <br>  To The Twilight Zone|`|tuwHboNnaa	Yeah, it was a decent ending segment, but i found it somewhere between funny and plain weird.|`|HmCtooORaa	They could have made it flow a little better, it seemed out there and kinda awakward even for wrestling.|`|8zwL5YwFaa	LOL. Join the club|`|GQWGLSexaa	LOL i thought it was funny|`|2CAtj8d5aa	The lady made it all weird to me, she was a really bad actress.
KJMOvKcSaa	That is the EXACT same problem as I had! I was always scarred to land on the board. I was afraid it was going to slip out from under me and I would fall. So one day, I was goofing around in my house skating on my carpet. I learned pop shove its this way. Then I tried to kick flip and I did it. So practice in your house or on your rug. Maybe even in the grass. And when you do it, put your front foot beside the bolts at a 45 degree angle.When you pop, dont push forward out backward because this will cause the board to rotate. Watch the board flip and stomp your feet down RIGHT when you see the black grip tape. Also, you cant try holding on to something like a pole or even landing on the board upside down.<br>  <br>  I hope I helped! =D
rYqBGkwjaa	Seems more like a Small Forward to me.  From there all you need to do is score, defend, rebound, and pass.  That suits you perfectly.<br>  <br>  Have any other Questions? I use to be a Trainer. <br>  <br>  E-Mail me... MaximumYP@yahoo.com|`|VkXrImFwaa	Small forward for sure. If you arent a good ball handler you probably shouldnt play the point.  BUT if you are as good a passer as you say you are, then the point should get you the ball so that you can find an open cuter or open shooter.  Plus if you are a good rebounder you prolly want to play forward.|`|gprdq8E2aa	Im taller than you but same as you with the skills, but i can play guard on defence or big man, yer i generally play sf - c any pos.|`|sjnzoERfaa	power forward or small forward but definitely a forward|`|qtwYHyH5aa	SMALL FOWARD|`|OKyVQoruaa	Since you stand below 6 feet, it would be better for you to be a point guard. BUT you should improve your driblling skills.|`|tbW4bDKJaa	Point guard?|`|8tEvmSpWaa	work on ur ball handling and u would be a really strong solid guard, tough to handle...... focus on the handles|`|KzbZH4T5aa	small forward
bSsBGrZVaa	Koko B. Ware<br>  ---<br>  I think that WWE made the right decision for inducting him<br>  into WWE hall of fame & i know that he is a semi-retired wrestler<br>  but i know that Koko B. Ware has been working in wrestling industry<br>  for a longtime during his legendry career he has achieved enough<br>  & his major achievements are NWA Mid-America Heavyweight Championship<br>  & USWA Unified Heavyweight Championship but he had a great<br>  success in tag team division in old times & he is also a former<br>  NWA united states tag team champion,AWA southern tag team champion<br>  & USWA world tag team champion & i know that Koko B. Ware was<br>  never a main-eventer but i think that he is one of the most hard-working<br>  person's in wrestling history thats the reason WWE has inducted him<br>  i have never watched his legendry career because i was started to be<br>  a wrestling fan since 1996 but i know that what makes a real legend<br>  like Koko B. Ware & i am totally satisfied with WWE hall of fame because<br>  they have given wrestling fans such a legendry class of 2009 & it rules|`|rMq9D06Faa	PLEEEEEEASE tell me you aren't serious?!!!!<br>  <br>  Before I saw this I JUST posted a question saying this is a stupid induction.<br>  <br>  I can think of 100 wrestlers more deserving.|`|wEST8CCUaa	I think he deserves it, he's one of those guys that people loved to see, but they might need some names to fill in for that night, because I feel there are more deserving guys, to me KoKo's would seem like one of those guys who made a name for himself, but I don't know if he's had the accomplishments to put him in. Still I'm happy for him and I'm glad one of those guys I grew up watching is in.|`|b7JS16dyaa	Does anybody else feel like they're doing this because he's in the new video game?<br>  <br>  He was fun and all, but did he really have an impact on the WWF or the wrestling business? Who knows, I might have missed it when he did.|`|ko5ZPP80aa	I could of thought of over 100 other people who deserved it... But they will get their chance so it's okay..<br>  .<br>  .<br>  .<br>  Yeah He is actually a good inductee.|`|vweoheAvaa	I actually thought they were gonna run the same ad where they announce that "Cowboy" Bill Watts would be inducted.|`|ruz4EBkkaa	I don't believe he had that great of an impact on the wwe to be inducted.|`|rMlq6waNaa	Yes, it was just announced!
6yoQhXsOaa	TMAC by a little bit! Man when TMAc is healthy he is  amazing!|`|L2gILDzIaa	I am going to go with Tmac, he was sic when he was younger and what you saw tonight was a a preview of what he was able to do when he was younger and when he led the league in scoring,<br>  <br>  But you see what an injury can do to a person,  for those of you who are younger fans I know Tracy from what you seen these past few years is not even close to what he was able to do before his injuries.<br>  <br>  Dwade was injured last year and the year before and that why people are starting to discover him now.|`|wGO7thhwaa	McGrady was DEFINITELY the more prolific scorer.<br>  he could drop 30 a game without breaking a sweat.<br>  wade however is more team oriented.<br>  McGrady is more talented and definitely more athletic.<br>  im not taking anything away from wade, but i have to say mcgrady|`|AsIGEd2daa	Wow this is a close one... <br>  <br>  <br>  T-Mac was effin CRAZY in his prime... but Wade is in his prime right now and he is also pretty darn good. <br>  <br>  I'm going to go with Wade by an extremely small margin, just because he's a bit more clutch than T-Mac. <br>  <br>  <br>  Also, you can expect a bunch of Wade answers, because half of the people saying it know NOTHING.|`|7ybUYnGCaa	T-Mac was better at scoring.<br>  <br>  Dwyane is better at everything else, and not too far back when it comes to scoring.|`|JgAE7eV9aa	T Mac is good but if you want the best player to play in your team in the NBA Finals then you would pick Dwyane Wade.|`|3PWXaOgjaa	D-Wade better all around.|`|jki8W5khaa	D Wade was f*cking sick tonight...we almost cried at my college, everybody on my floor was in our dorm watching this guy|`|xtuyRToAaa	T-Mac is a scoring machine.<br>  <br>  But D-Wade is a scoring and everything else machine. And he has one thing else that T-Mac doesn't have - will to win. That is why Wade has already won a championship.<br>  <br>  And I think D-Wade has just started to hit his prime. Next year maybe even better.<br>  <br>  D-Wade no question.|`|VZr8PCoYaa	D-Wade hands down. He's better in the clutch, doesn't choke every time he gets to the playoffs, and doesn't get injured every five games (jk) but seriously he is better period. Plus he is still in his prime.|`|GswnLKtQaa	T-Mac has more of a scoring machine, but D-wade gives more dimes/assist and plays defense, D-Wade's the better player during both their primes.|`|aUGM3ju6aa	Dwyane Wade|`|fuYYRJXtaa	That's a tough question.<br>  <br>  T-mac was a much better scorer than Wade, but Wade can hit 40 anytime of the week.  Today's performance by Wade shows that he is a big time player who is deserving of the MVP no matter what record his team has.<br>  <br>  T-mac is so injury prone that he stopped shining & his overall numbers just came down every year.  Wade is young & in his prime so is still too soon to tell...|`|hzttr76Maa	T-Mac is a bigger scorer, as mentioned by the other users. I like MCgrady's offense better than Wade's, but Wade is faster and can add just a little bit more to the table ( like assists or steals ) I'll take Wade in a small hair over Orlando T-Mac.|`|HiuNSScLaa	wade but t mac was a better scorer i love t mac hes sick wade gives more assists blocks steals and same boards there close but wade a little bit|`|piZ4xDBqaa	D-Wade has a ring and a finals MVP trophy.<br>  T-Mac is 0-for-playoffs<br>  <br>  Gimme Flash!

vnzSTerjaa	its not because of how they treat they players, its because it was a bad team at the time, so he whined to his dad to get him a trade. true story :/ im glad that happened though, if he was in SD today, even the raiders could beat them|`|paIUgtLRaa	Cause he is a spoiled little puss and his loser father thinks that he's football royalty.<br>  <br>  Archie Manning never had a winning season, and didn't do a damn thing with the Saints, yet he thinks that he's important enough to tell franchises who they can and can't draft. He can go to hell.<br>  <br>  They felt that SD wouldn't have given Eli the best chance at having a winning career. Rather than being a part of a team as you create the winning atmosphere, and turn the club around, they opted for the easy way out. Which makes me think that maybe both Archie and Eli both knew that Eli isn't as good as his older brother. At least he took his lumps and turned the Colts around. I guess dear old Dad and little brother didn't have that kind of confidence in Eli. San Diego went 4-12 to close out the 2003 season. They secured the first pick in the draft, and little Archie boy didn't want his son playing for a loser.|`|Hkb7xoaQaa	Because Archie Manning thought the Chargers were going to suck and that they were more focused on the run than the pass. Eli mentioned how he discussed the decision with his family and THEY decided to ask for a trade. As a charger fan i am glad he didn't come here, he'll never be as good as Peyton and Phillip Rivers and Shawne Merriman were pretty much what we got in that trade. I'll take those two guys over one Over-rated Eli any day.|`|fiaFQAWWaa	Because the charger GM is a nut-job. Also California is like a socialist country.|`|Rjedkvi1aa	Because the Chargers as a franchise were knowin for not treating players vey well and not trying too win like the Giants were.|`|IOpOEMnQaa	he felt he had a better chance of winning anywhere outside San Diego some where he had a gm who doen't spend his saturdays screaming at mice|`|NiMluxNDaa	he didnt like san diego<br>  he thought he could do better in ny<br>  nd he was right!<br>  shocking the world and winning superbowl XLII over the 16-0 patriots<br>  who doesnt want that?|`|gRXy66dOaa	i heard because he didnt like SD|`|XLXncQu9aa	The Giants was a better situation overall for Eli Manning.  Even though Phillip Rivers has the better numbers slightly, overall I would say that Manning got the better end of the deal.  He did win a world championship the season before this one past.  But that being said, the Chargers have been known not to treat players very well.  A great example of that is how the Chargers are handling L.T.  They are so called "restructuring" his contract when in reality he is going to be getting paid less than what should be for L.T.  The situation is horrendous and I believe that Manning knew that going to SD wouldn't be best for his career.  He was right.  Why go to a team that would show unfaithfulness to you as a player?  The Giants have put more faith in Eli even when he deserved to be benched.  I don't think he could have said the same for SD.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	He didn't think he could win in San Diego.  They had a history of being bad, and even though the Giants weren't much better that past year, he at least thought the Giants were a team that would try to get better, as opposed to San Diego, who he felt wouldn't compete.|`|s1Q9vnqmaa	Cuz he didnt think he had a future there so he cryed to daddy and had him get him a trade cuz he doesnt like the chargers!<br>  Hmp!|`|yg3Pveakaa	He is more of an east coast guy he didnt want to play in a west coast team like the Bolts|`|gBfPkdroaa	because aj smith is an ***.|`|yWcPOTsAaa	Too close to Mexico, he could pass as a half breed.
KeeYIvcYaa	I would recommend taking a tumbling class.  They have them at all star gyms most of the time.  There, you probably will be working mostly on our tumbling skills, but you can also work your jumps.  Like toe touches, hurdlers, pikes and fronts  ect... lol.  Also, strech a lot!  And when cheer tryouts come around remember to smile no matter what! Be  as loud as you can, but not screaming, stay as tight as you can.  Its almost like your flexing while doing the motions.  make your motions really tight.  And don't forget.... RALLY! Make sure they are peppy, try to make it as long as you can without going overboard tho! l!  Lets see... I think thats it!  <br>  <br>  Good Luck Girl! :)|`|ienvtCUVaa	in cheer we mostly do <br>  jumps<br>  splits<br>  back walkovers<br>  backhand springs<br>  back tucks<br>  and stunting<br>  you should probably know how to do a backbend and maybe a walkover before you sign up<br>  but you will learn a lot of new things during that cheer season|`|pHsohDjpaa	practice your splits, jumps, tumbling, and always smile! even if you mess up pretend you didn't and keep going! oh and if you make the squad you learn dances, do stuning, and learn cheers!
7BIiofbaaa	You pretty much just have to practice. Here's a website that could help you:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.nasl.com/drills/daily_foot_drill.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.nasl.com/drills/daily_foot_dr...</a><br>  <br>  You may also want to lift weights with your legs to make your leg muscles bigger, but don't go for heavy; go steady. You want to have lean muscle, not brawn, in football.

uBrTu7OBaa	It's funny because I've seen really good players knocking off Ryu. Depends who's playing the character from street-fighter, Ryu can be a monster or a button-masher. It's just like martial arts, where it's the person behind it controlling the movements.<br>  <br>  Though if you want a personality opinion, Ryu is one of my favorites but Ken will always be my childhood favorite.|`|9d2aOK36aa	better in what?<br>  <br>  whatever it is that's positive, Ryu is better|`|e77578463fbd806dcbdafb3d76d04018aa	RYU fir sure|`|4ca485ab10aead5ea4089df6e7d8f86aaa	I don't know, really. Ryu's background has him spending all his time training, wandering the world to improve his martial skills, eating, living and breathing karate: Ken's has him as a karateka with a life, even a wife and kids. Yet they're, competitively speaking, just about even in each game in the timeline, from the early Street Fighter Alpha days to their latest chronological incarnations in Street Fighter 3.<br>  That suggests to me that Ken is the one who's just supernaturally talented at maiming people, while Ryu is as good as he's going to get physically and not substantially improving.|`|QSsU9gxGaa	ryu.|`|rl0NfUZFaa	ryu|`|6t68dbfoaa	No question - Ryu is better
E0SrMarNaa	well i'm hoping your friend said basketball. Because baseball is by far the hardest sport ever!!! You have to hit a ball that on average is coming at you 95mph sometimes 100, you have to catch a ball in bright lights from the sun or even the lights from the stadium. It is not a game for a hyper person, i.e. if you are in the outfield keeping focus on every pitch is a must, Also there is a thought process that goes on with this sport, you can be a great player but if you don't know how to run the bases, you are almost guaranteed to lose. Don't get me wrong I love Basketball , its my favorite sport, unfortunately i am a Chicago Bulls fan, which right now,its tough, but nothing beats going to U.S. Cellular field where the White Sox play and having a good old fashioned Chicago hotdog while watching America's favorite pasttime|`|3e342b4c35254658976e2faf3d9365f0aa	Apples and oranges.|`|TLZ3GEEXaa	Since I played both in high school, I thought both were quite easy, but in basketball, there's more running than baseball.|`|HiuNSScLaa	i play all sports except soccer baseball is hard think about it the best hitters hit the ball 30 % of the time the best 3 point shooters are around 40 % then theres easy shots theres no easy hits but basketball is up there golf is hardest football is funnest basketball is easiest to do cause all you need is a hoop and ball|`|9XxQJLqUaa	basketball is way harger baseball is stupid and they dont do anyhing, they go up to bat like 3 times a game and get paid more than any athlete, baseball is pathetic|`|uFqkgwhQaa	Baseball is harder<br>  <br>  You know how many Players tried and use Steriods to improve their skills?|`|iRDbzU6saa	Many women want them to wear thongs or pink underwears.|`|WD4oYqLFaa	basketball is harder because in baseball you don't really need eye-popping athleticsm like basketball and football to have great sucess and really it's all hand-eye coordination, i still love it though but in basketball you have to be in shape to be able to play offense and defense back to back with no rest running up the court for 5 minutes straight until there is a dead ball it gets tiring. and out of basketball, baseball, football, and track i sweat the most in basketball|`|ptrGNp3Qaa	I have a lot of respect for both MLB and NBA players but I<br>  think basketball is a lot harder.

MSIf48X7aa	I've skied all my life and decided to try snowboarding a while ago. It is VERY hard initially to even be able to go down a green (easy) run. It has a very steep learning curve and is very frustrating initially. Once you get it though, it's super fun but it takes a while to be good enough to do anything. I have a lot of friends that have snowboarded for years and have also just decided to try skiing, and like it so much they are selling their snowboards :)|`|jTaW3goeaa	Snowboarding is harder than skiing to learn.  After a few days you may be able to stand up and ride the beginner hills, but don't expect to be an advanced rider after just a few days, because it takes longer than that|`|MBlY3pw1aa	i skiid for two years then learnt snowboarding. it is fairly easy as you are used to the feel of being on snow, but you have to remember it is a completely different technique and it is easy to become over confident. it only takes a few days to pick up anyway|`|jTFdG8xqaa	Of course you can learn it and it is easy and hard for certain people it is different than skiing in many ways but it isn't necessarily to hard to learn.|`|AA11594996	Im a good skier and like you i wanted to learn snowboarding as well.Snowboarding is harder to learn but once you get it you can progress pretty well.

When i would run, i would always get cramps in my stomach. I also have looked this up and found that if you drink a glass/bottle of water before you run it will help. Just make sure you don't drink loads of water though.  If you forget to drink water before, it helps to drink some right after you get a cramp, speeding up the "recovery" process :) Also it helps if you eat some food with potassium a couple hours before. If you eat right before you run. your body sends it's blood flow and oxygen to your digestive tract, rather than to your muscles. Some foods that have potassium are: bananas, cantaloupe, kiwi, apricots, meats, fish, oranges, and tomatoes. <br>  <br>  hope this helps!
XfClBIP8aa	here's the thing, she can buy the gun for you but technically you can not give her the money for it otherwise that would constitute a "straw sale", basically meaning someone buying a gun for someone else.  but really if you give your mom the money and keep your mouth shut about it at the gun shop no one will be the wiser and you'll be able to get what you want.|`|8ivnzNi5aa	Federal law requires that you be at least 18 years old to buy a shotgun or rifle from a licensed dealer.  If your mother is willing to buy it, and give it to you  (NOT "gift" it to you!), that's legal in most states in the US.  The dealer should be able to let your mother know about any applicable restrictions in your state.  If you're able to buy a gun on-line, it'll still have to be transferred through a licensed dealer, unless the seller is in the same state as you.|`|yetGbkdBaa	you can't sell a gun to a minor unless it's illegeal and you know you don't want to do that|`|J67gQaUaaa	In Oregon you can own a rifle if your under 18, You can buy it from a oregonian if they get you moms permission, and check your I.D. to make sure your from Oregon. I don't know if a store can sell one to you, but my aunt tried to buy one from walmart for me, and let it slip that it was for some one else, and they wouldn't sell it to her. My uncle went in the next day and bought it. may just have been walmart, may just have been that clerk, but I would pick it out, tell mom, and have her go buy it.<br>  Gun stores here don't care if you buy guns for you kids though, so it probably was just a noobie clerk.|`|dpSr0icwaa	first, you are going to need to tell us what state you are in.  Some states have special rules.<br>  <br>  However, in ALL states, your mom can gift you a firearm.  You can pick it out and she can pay for it, fill out the forms, etc etc, and then gift it to you.  Note, if you give her money for the gun this is no longer a gift.  You can, however, at sometime later, give an apporoximately similar amount of cash to your families 'general family fund'/<br>  <br>  Exactly what paperwork your mom needs to do varies by state, but for most states it is none.<br>  <br>  Second, yes, your mom can buy a gun from a private citizen at a garage sale, add in the newspaper, or ad on-line.  Again state specific info is needed, the vast majority of states require no paperwork, but a few may.  She then gifts you the gun as before.<br>  <br>  Craigslist does not allow firearms on it...even though firearms are legal, and craigslist allows prostitutes, including child prostitutes to post there, even though that is illegal.|`|yqx9YTBJaa	What do you mean "register" it in her name?  The Bill of Rights isn't completely gone yet...<br>  <br>  Most people who don't grow up in the urban gutters get their first gun long before 18.  It's nobody's business but yours and your parents'.  I don't know what store wouldn't sell you guys a gun that's going to be yours, unless maybe you go in there dressed like a thug and talking ebonics.<br>  <br>  Get the gun, follow the 4 rules, go to the range, and become as good a shot as you can.  Our Founders would be proud.<br>  <br>  When you grow up, teach your kids to do the same.  Have fun.
z7JsVzcnaa	All the major sports with the exception of MLB have salary caps already.  The NHL, NFL and NBA have salary caps, and as a result, you don't have dynasties so much anymore.  The playing field is a little bit more level in that you can't have one team over pay every player they want when it comes to free agency like the Yankees do.<br>  <br>  More importantly, there should be a minimum salary that the teams have to pay too.|`|hFX5UQGdaa	Ya|`|sKObPf76aa	with north americas economy in the tank. not only salary caps. this would make the sport watchable for families as a unit. pro sport prices are out of control. live close to vancouver canada. n h l franchise canucks. cheap ticket 60 dollars canadian the highest in the n h l . parking 22 dollars. car broken into. 75 percent. fuel cost 25 dollars. cannot afford food beverage prices. restaurant meal cheaper. 20 dollars. less than 75 miles 2 and one half hours. very poor traffic. drive to long. salary cap. would assist the true fan base. not just people who attended games to be seen. caps needed also ticket prices droped to allow sports to be returned to the real fans . thank you

He is a member of the Argentine national basketball team and the San Antonio Spurs in the NBA. The NBA All-Star shooting guard is <br>  <br>  Biography<br>  <br>  Ginóbili comes from a basketball family. Older brothers Sebastián and Leandro have played professionally in Argentina and Spain respectively. Their father, Jorge, was a coach at a club in Bahía Blanca, where Ginóbili learned to play. Like many Argentines, Ginóbili is a descendant of Italian immigrants, and he has dual citizenship with Argentina and Italy.<br>  <br>  Professional career<br>  <br>  [edit] Argentine and Italian years<br>  <br>  Ginóbili made his professional debut in the Argentine basketball league for the Andino Sport Club[1] team of La Rioja from 1995–1996, and was traded to Estudiantes de Bahía Blanca the next year. He played with his hometown team until the Italian league attracted him, and in 1998 he moved to Europe, playing in the 1998-1999 and 1999-2000 seasons with Basket Viola Reggio Calabria, after which he was traded to Kinder Bologna, which he helped win the 2001 Italian Championship, 2001 and 2002 Italian Cups, and the 2001 Euroleague, where he was named MVP. Team's coach Ettore Messina helped him improve his shooting, defense and leadership. He also made the Italian league's All-Star game three times during this period.<br>  <br>  San Antonio Spurs<br>  <br>  In the 1999 NBA Draft, the Spurs selected Ginóbili late in the second round with the 57th overall pick, the penultimate choice in the entire draft. However, he did not sign with the Spurs until the 2002 FIBA World Championship in Indianapolis, where he made the all-tournament team alongside future NBA star Yao Ming and established NBA stars Dirk Nowitzki and Peja Stojakovic. Ginóbili helped lead Argentina to a second-place finish. When he did return, he suffered an injury to his ankle, and was forced to watch training camp on the sidelines for two weeks. In the years since, some commentators have deemed him the greatest draft day steal in modern NBA history, and perhaps all-time.<br>  Manu playing for the Spurs<br>  Manu playing for the Spurs<br>  <br>  In his first season in the NBA, Manu fought to get minutes playing backup for veteran Steve Smith. He spent much of the early season injured, and found it hard to adjust to the NBA's style of play. The Spurs didn't have much need for him and went 60-22 for the season. They entered the playoffs eager to upset the highly-favored Lakers. As his injury improved, so did Manu, winning Rookie of the Month in March. In the postseason, Manu became an integral part of Gregg Popovich's rotational set up. The Spurs proceeded to wipe out Phoenix and Los Angeles. In these games Manu's scoring threat took opponents by surprise, giving them one more thing to cope with against the now highly-favored Spurs. He helped guide them past the Mavericks and then the Nets in the Finals. After the win, Manu was named Argentina's top sportsman in the country's main newspaper, Clarín. He met Néstor Kirchner, the Argentine president, had a gym dedicated in his honour, and often required a police escort wherever he went.<br>  <br>  After some issues with San Antonio over his contract, with agent Herb Rudoy, Ginóbili re-signed and he became a starter for the Spurs in 2005. On February 8 of the following year, Ginóbili was selected (by a vote of NBA coaches) to the 2005 Western Conference All-Star team as a reserve, his first time making it to the elite midseason showcase. On June 23, Ginóbili won his second title with the Spurs playing as starter in a very defensive 7-game series against the Detroit Pistons, with a game 7 score of 81-74. In the NBA Finals MVP Award voting, Manu was edged out (6 votes to 4) by teammate Tim Duncan. He finished the 2004-2005 season as the second leading scorer on the team.<br>  <br>  The 2005-2006 season started with troubles for Ginóbili, who suffered foot and ankle injuries that hindered his ability to play.<br>  <br>  On February 21, 2007, Manu set a Spurs franchise record with 24 straight points against the Atlanta Hawks.<br>  <br>  Olympic gold medal 2004<br>  <br>  On August 15, 2004, Ginóbili led the Argentine team to the gold medal. Ginóbili was named the MVP of the Olympic tournament, sporting heroics like in the 83-82 win over Serbia and Montenegro with a shot he made while falling to the floor with less than a second to go, in Argentina's basketball opener at the Olympic Games in Athens. Ginóbili led the team in both scoring (16.7 ppg) and assists (3.3 apg).<br>  <br>  Player profile<br>  <br>  Ginóbili is a 6 ft 6 in (1.98 m), 205 lb (93 kg) shooting guard. His NBA career averages are 13.4 points, 3.8 rebounds, 3.3 assists and 1.6 steals per game. He is a relative late bloomer, entering the NBA at age 25 in a period where entering the NBA as a teenager was very common.<br>  <br>  Initially a sixth man, Ginóbili soon established himself as a starter. He is known for his up-tempo style of play, behind-the-back moves when attacking the basket and for his dunking skills. Ginóbili is also known for his clutch play, documented by his numerous European league MVP awards, becoming 2004 Olympic tournament MVP, and proven by his strong play in the Spurs' 2004-05 championship-winning campaign, where he narrowly lost the Finals MVP vote to team mate Tim Duncan by 2 votes.<br>  <br>  Ginóbili's modus operandi is the source of much consternation for opponents (for example, lowering his head while driving toward the basket, and willingness to draw charges on defense), among the most vocal of whom have been coach George Karl of the Denver Nuggets. These critics frequently accuse Ginóbili of "flopping," or exaggerating the amount of contact that occurs when he is playing defense.<br>  Playing against the Lakers<br>  Playing against the Lakers<br>  <br>  Ginóbili also deserves mention for being one of the few players who are successful under both the physical, one-on-one play of the NBA and the more technical, jumpshooting rule set of the FIBA. He is the only player in basketball history to win the Euroleague, an Olympic gold medal, and an NBA Championship ring. He is also the only non-U.S. player ever to win both the NBA Championship ring and the Olympic gold medal, and only the second Latin American to be selected to play in an NBA All-star game (after Panama's Rolando Blackman).<br>  <br>  Ginóbili's career high in points is 48, which he scored vs. the Phoenix Suns during an overtime game in January 2005.<br>  <br>  Argentine National Team<br>  <br>  Manu made his Argentina debut on the 30th of July 1998 at the World Cup in Athens. He is considered one of Argentina's most skillful and important national players ever, despite his age. His greatest accomplishment as a member of the national team came at the 2004 Athens Olympics when he and the Argentinians became the first non-American team in 26 years to win the gold medal. His highlight of the tournament was probably his game-winning buzzer beater with 0.1 seconds remaining, on the opening day of the Olympics, in a game versus Serbia & Montenegro.<br>  <br>  In the media<br>  <br>      * During the 2005 Playoffs, Ginóbili and teammate Tony Parker starred in an NBA-produced advertisement promoting the Finals where NBA players phoned in to the "Love Doctor" (portrayed by NBA legend Julius Erving) to get advice and to give their opinions about how much they loved the trophy.<br>      * Manu Ginóbili speaks three languages fluently: Spanish, Italian and English.<br>  <br>  <br>  Jersey Numbers<br>  <br>  6 Bahiense del Norte, Andino de la Rioja, Kinder Bologna<br>  10 Estudiantes BB, Reggio Calabria<br>  20 San Antonio Spurs<br>  5 Argentina National Team<br>  <br>  Titles<br>  <br>      * 2001 Italian League Championship (Kinder Bologna)<br>      * 2001 Italian Cup (Kinder Bologna)<br>      * 2001 Euroleague (Kinder Bologna)<br>      * 2001 Americas Championship (Argentina)<br>      * 2002 Italian Cup (Kinder Bologna)<br>      * 2003 NBA Championship (San Antonio Spurs)<br>      * 2004 Summer Olympic Games Gold Medal (Argentina)<br>      * 2005 NBA Championship (San Antonio Spurs)<br>  <br>  Ginóbili is the only basketball player to win an Euroleague, an NBA ring, and an Olympic Gold medal[2].<br>  <br>  Awards<br>      * 1999 Italian League All-Star<br>      * 2000 Italian League All-Star<br>      * 2000 Italian League Most Improved Player<br>      * 2001 Italian League All-Star<br>      * 2001 Italian League Most Valuable Player<br>      * 2001 Euroleague Most Valuable Player<br>      * 2002 Italian Cup Most Valuable Player<br>      * 2002 Italian League Most Valuable Player<br>      * 2002 All-Tournament Team, FIBA World Championship<br>      * 2004 Ideal Olympics Team<br>      * 2004 Summer Olympic Games Most Valuable Player<br>      * 2005 NBA All-Star<br>      * 2005 Nike Baller Of The Year (fan poll)<br>      * 2006 All-Tournament Team, FIBA World Championship|`|DrAGdXmqaa	Emanuel Davíd Ginóbili|`|GSdU92yHaa	Eva nail....oh sorry lad, thats what that lad Parker doi

AA11397363	I'm pretty sure that every NBA player enjoys what they do and would prefer to win a championship than lose all the time. Sometimes, however, players get greedy and ask for more money (Spreewell!).<br>  <br>  As for the person who says Kobe only plays for the money:<br>  <br>  Kobe has made millions just from his endorsement deals. He also has 3 championships to his name and he always goes out and plays hard. If Kobe wasn't trying hard he wouldn't be scoring anywhere near as much as he is, and his team is pretty good this year too.<br>  <br>  To answer your question, the only players who are playing for the $$$ are the ones who specifically ask for more and refuse to sign for less when no one meets their request (Spreewell!).|`|18377ef088cd687356676e25a00726b2aa	Yao Ming and Kobe Bryant are in it for the money.|`|a6d2e028d59f188b3d1cf9b8ae151a50aa	all of them!|`|f87a847aeef4cccadce4214608dc2ad5aa	KG also plays for the love of the game why else would he stay in Minnesota.

Yo diría que Utah puede sacar uno o dos juegos pero la fuerza del equipo demostrata fue realmente superior independientemente a que el resultado (100-108) no fue tan abultado.<br>  <br>  En el Este la cosa es un poco más pareja, bueno, "pareja"  entre comillas. Es bien sabido que Cleveland depende demasiado de LeBron James y que la defensa de los Pistones es mucho muy superior a la e los Cavs.<br>  <br>  Creo que ese puede ser el factor determinante para ver una final Spurs - Pistons.<br>  <br>  La verdad es que por apoyo no se puede quejar James, pero creo que la rotación más amplia de los Pistones es mucho mejor que la banca que podría tener en cancha Cleveland. Mucho dependerá de como manejen a LeBron quien seguramente no bajará de 30 puntos, pero el resto del equipo es la gran incógnita.<br>  <br>  Esta serie terminará 4-1 o 4-2 a favor de los Pistons.<br>  <br>  Como lo dije en anteriores preguntas, San Antonio se jugó la final contra Phoenix.<br>  <br>  Un saludo.|`|b0a98527be358709adc96acb509c2b3eaa	San Antonio Y Detroit|`|e754a37898b1f833eaa2563ccc3dbc7daa	Spurs y Detroit y gana los Detroits Pistons|`|68pYqVn1aa	spurs y pistons.....GO SPURS GO...|`|EBwBAy2taa	los spuers y los cavaliers ,<br>  <br>  <br>  campeon los spurs|`|MFZznJb2aa	Yo creo que la final de la NBA va a ser San Antonio Spurs contra Detroit Pistons, los Spurs sufriran para eliminar a los Jazz ya que tienen una plantilla extensa y de gran calidad pero la mayor experiencia en Play Offs sera definitiva y luego en la otra eliminatoria los Pistons ganaran de manera mas o menos facil a los Cleveland Cavaliers de Lebron James, esta es mi apuesta para la final y en la final yo creo que se impondran los Pistons.|`|V3QjgN5Gaa	pues ami m parece qq puede haber sorpresas y la final sera jazz contra los cavs he aqui mis rasones<br>  <br>  el jazz tiene un gran equipo con carlos boozer... ak-47 entre otros y yo pienso q los spurs llegan muy debilitados despues de la serie con los suns...y en el este yo veo super fuerte alos cavs y lebron ganara su primer titulo d muchos q le faltan por ganar|`|gzp0G9lAaa	Los Spurs y los Pistons.|`|oy9BH1XIaa	Bueno mi opinion es que los Spurs y los Pistons irán a la final.

c1f486046450d139713d0cf2b95d59ffaa	hell yeah the steelers will be back next year, they are a much better team then there record would indicate.  there have been problems this year and some can be attributed to health, like bens situations, troys shoulder was bothering him all year, and hines did have issues with his hamstring.  aside from that defense wasn't looking hot and neither was the o-line or special teams, but they have a strong core of players and next year when they come back people are gonna underestimate them based on their performace this year, and thats not a bad thing.|`|4474df2b4054e32c1e81ef9ca9491e00aa	I'd doubt it. The lose of Bettis wasn't that big of a loss. He wasn't that good at the end anyways. He was just popular, he wasn't even close to being the best back on the team. Basically the team over acheived in the playoffs last year. They were lucky to win two games, much less the Super Bowl. Probably the least talented team to ever win it all. Just take the championship and be happy with it.|`|d18a7c1a67198c269bf100c4f1e7500caa	yep i can see them bouncing back bigtime they will continue to have good drafts and they will use this disappointment of a season as motivation to do better next year|`|f672096a5f5d6b901b5c27f4f3255e68aa	this teams performance this year tells you how much jerome bettis was the factor. BUT....statisically, this team is much better than last year. the only problem is that the steelers have to cutt down on the mistakes. bug ben has thrown 20 int's this year and some players have been injured. but.. yes...i think they will be back in 07.....remember the patriots?...they had a 9-7 year after winning sb 36 and they rebounded to win 2 more...anything can happen|`|236518cbb3e766554f0596e2e1faef59aa	They will be back.. they need a solution to the secondary problems and they need to stay healthy. Getting a good draft will help a lot but in the past we have made the right moves in the draft in order to return to top notch status. A few years back the team was 6-10 and then went to the AFC Championship the next season. <br>  <br>  Retaining Porter is the main concern right now... but the Ravens can only get older as they are aging veterans and the Bengals continue to have off the field struggles.<br>  <br>  <br>  BTW The steelers lost a few games just based on dumb turnovers and if not for them then they are in the hunt.|`|6e81d8d8f2ec067ab2f248677b3ae9c1aa	The Steelers always put together a good team. They almost never field the BEST team. In many ways, this makes it a lot of fun to be a Steelers fan. Last season, they went way beyond their supposed capabilities to defeat teams that were considered to be much better. The Steelers barely made it to the playoffs at all last year. It was exciting to see an underdog Steelers win it all in those circumstances - becoming the first Wildcard to win it all.<br>  <br>  This season they have pretty much the same team, but not the same fight. There are some problems with various injuries, but every team has those. They just aren't as inspired. Next season I think we'll see much of the same team, but if they play like they did last season (and have some of the same luck), then I think they could do as well as they did last season. At least making it to the playoffs. <br>  <br>  There are more exciting teams to watch this year, anyway. The Saints! Where did that come from?|`|f8cc2156bf6f6457c7469b3f37166e83aa	no because the panthers are so much better and will run out anyone in there path in the playoffs|`|4045eeb32c4ef2d7acd08239fb1eff37aa	They have a good shot at it.  I believe that if they can stay injury free and Roethlisberger can stay health in the off season and preseason he will be in better synch with his offensive unit.  This year they have moments of good...and a lot of poor execution.  Bill should get them straightened out.  I just think with Ben's conditions this year it has made it difficult for this team to win.|`|49fb907f8f47b88505f722a9cf905848aa	Cowher is too good of a coach for the team to stay down long...assuming he is still around next season.<br>  <br>  I doubt the Steelers will be championship contenders again next year, but they will likely be back in the wild card hunt.  It all does depend on Big Ben getting his groove back, though.  If he can't, they'll be in for another rough year.

012416e77a484361186f94e255a70a9aaa	Not this season maybe next year. Russel is going to Oakland he is gggooooddd but not the next Manning. They got a new head coach and it'll probably be a while before they get themselves together and if they can get Moss to play then they'll be that much better.|`|b17d326fa3bdf4dc44d09f61d90ad780aa	(1) There is only one California team worth rooting for. That is San Diego!<br>  (2) There is no way in hell that the Raiders make the playoffs this year.<br>  (3) Al 'Crypt Keeper' Davis will probably pick Russel, and slowly suck the life out of what could be a very good player. Even if Russel does not get picked by Oakland, he will not be the next Manning. Maybe he will end up the next Culpepper or McNabb, but that is about it.|`|1SI1ZLidaa	08 season is too far away man. Do you mean 07 season? <br>  <br>  They will have a better record and offense but no playoffs.|`|2YpujXoGaa	Definately not a playoff-caliber team next year. Just dont have it all together yet. Depending on JaMarcus Russell's progression, and assuming they draft him, they could be the dominate team in their division because their defense is young but very, very good and Russell has more upside than just about any quarterback in a long, long time. He really is not limited in any way and is an absolute beast. The future looks bright, but if he doesnt live up to expectations it will put the Raiders back for years and I wouldnt expect them to compete for anything.|`|a0F37Xpdaa	I hope the Raiders dont pick Russell and NO hes not the next Manning hes the next Ryan Leaf. I hope they draft Clavin Johnson. They can sign a veteran Qb like Carr or Green to battle Walters. Their running game should be great w/ a health Jordan and new additions Rhodes and Griffith. A new coach will bring the team to their potential. They are a potential playoff team. Last year ranked 3rd in total defense yardage given up. Hopefully they draft some offensive linemen and become this years Jets.|`|b049a16b088ae659bea6303630b7a404aa	i'm not a raiders fan, but i do live in the Bay Area and i like to see them do well. but in the 08 season they probably won't be a playoff team. they are in the AFC and they are in the AFC west, probably the most competitive, with Kanas City (play off team), San Diego (playoff team AND #1 seed in the AFC) and Denver Broncos (just missed the playoffs)<br>  <br>  no Russel will not be the next manning (as much as it pains me to say). Russel will be a great QB, but not of Brady/Manning's Caliber. Russel reminds me alot of Culpeper, a big guy with a big arm. and remember how good Culpeper did with R. Moss, now if the Raider can only get Moss to play, i think the raiders would do alot better than last season, but not playoff contention yet, especially since they are in the AFC west|`|jeXwL19taa	I don't believe Russel will be the next manning because they have their own strengths. Russel will have the arm for the long ball like Al Davis would like and some speed to go along with that. I think he won't do too good the first few years because of a few reasons. 1. The raiders offensive line is horrible 2. They don't have the experience at head coaching and 3. Unfortunate to say but Al Davis is controlling that team into the ground. You need an experienced head coach that would be given more control to better handle that team. Until that can happen I see it unlikely to them win too many games. Unless their defense can play offense I doubt it. Too much underachieving here|`|18n2dVf2aa	No to both.|`|55aa20c46e6f8afa4ea23da08b147350aa	the raiders have alot of work to do. the o line is terrible and they haven't had a halfway desent qb since kerry collins...(i know...)... anyway, jemarcus russel will probably be good- vince young good, NOT peyton manning good. we'll see... not a playoff team, though.|`|5Ku6iSPqaa	I am a die hard Raiders fan and I would love seeing them go to the playoffs, but I dont think it will be this year, maybe a 7-9 season. But anything is possible in the NFL (see: 2006 Saints). And with the addition of Dominic Rhodes, pro bowl FB Justin Griffith and former pro bowler Center Jeremy Newberrry, and one of the best WR corps in the NFL, the offense is already better, especially if they get JaMarcus Russell, whom I do not think is gonna be the next Manning, or Brady Quinn, who is also very good.|`|6vI6Yutdaa	No on the playoffs<br>  <br>  HELL NO on the Manning|`|AA12260803	Raiders need a backbone  period,they have fans but to have the most penalties and to have no new talent..it will be another year of crap...sorry!Almost all is lost on the west coast except for chargers...|`|t0An16jWaa	Raiders will suck<br>  <br>  ....like always|`|xytDZ533aa	they should not even be called a football team

c1f486046450d139713d0cf2b95d59ffaa	i hear ya, i'm a steelers fan, and i've supported ben roethlisberger from the beginning and still do, but every where i go all i hear is "they shoulda started charlie batch" or "put batch in," the way i see it is fans always wanna rationalize why their team is losing and it's really easy to blame the qb, and as they say, "the grass is always greener on the other side"<br>  <br>  now my opinion on KC, they aren't that good, the fact that the Colts won with their defense (which is generally terrible) proves that.  KC got into the playoffs by default, only KC diehard fans would have thought they could do any good, and I have respect for anyone who is a diehard fan, but KC has not performed consistantly this year, and that's something you need to win games.|`|eedbc9e134db1a07185f9cca66280063aa	rydaldude, until you know what you're talking about, shut your pie hole!<br>  <br>  And to the question no, there are some bandwagon fans out there but for the most part fans are loyal as can be!<br>  <br>  Eagles SUCK !!!!!!!|`|AA11433419	I like to watch the game in fair weather...lol<br>  <br>  no i'm not a fair weather fan.  cheesehead for life|`|2c030bdf465f2f554b495437b65f8b1faa	I'm always going for Miami, no matter what.

I worthy unless you are hitting .400 with lots of power.  You sound like a good D III prospect.  I'm not trying to put you down at all, but just speaking from experience.  During my 3 years of varsity I batted over .450, and broke 3 school records that were 30 years old, and was on the All-Area team 2 times.  All that got me was interest from Div. III schools, and only a few Div. I schools.  A friend of mine that was 6'3 and played 1 year varsity and was a so-so player got a lot of calls from schools, and I couldn't understand why.  The one time I went to visit a school with him, they looked at me, then looked at him and spend most of their time focused on him.  It stinks that they focus on height and not talent.  These programs think they can build a player rather than sign one that already has the tools, but is a few inches shorter.|`|5sGAyW3caa	you sound like youll be a good leadoff or 2 hitter if youre pretty good. i answered your question already when you didnt put in the details for yourself. you shouldnt be worrying about whether or not youre a power hitter or whether you hit for average or whether the college will move your position. if youre good, youll get noticed and you should start from there. also know that if you can hit the ball, whether u hit singles and doubles and steal bases or whether u hit shots, if you can hit, there will always be a spot for you on any college team, even if its not d1. d1 is pretty hard..<br>  for you to get noticed, its good to have connections but first ask your coach and im sure he'll help you out if he thinks you are good enough. but for now, you need to work out and put on a lot more muscle and continue to develop your skills. im sure you can go to a d1 college if you work hard. <br>  also, as for scouts theyre looking for the best talent so unless youre a headline maker theyll be hard to come by.<br>  so just work hard, keep hitting, keep fielding, and im sure you will get noticed one day or another. good luck to you as im doing the same thing =). if u wanna know more and talk to me email me i know it sounds gay but i can help.  therotenganator@yahoo.com|`|XPWDnL8paa	You're kidding right? Shortstops and third base men are not known for power. Most power hitters play OF, DH, or 1st. I think you will get noticed if you continue that pace and keep on playing good defense. I hope I can hit .400 next year in high school, considering that I've never played fast baseball, other than the batting cage and some softball experience.

3oHTV9Mtaa	you mean roger the dodger??  dusty baker named him that when he walked bonds 4 times straight at yankess stadium a few years ago.  I havent had any respect for him sense.  Bonds has the most homeruns ever off glavine,  with johnson, smoltz and maddox coming in second.  Why??  because those good pitchers go after him.  Makes the game fun, that is what it is all about.  Those pitchers have also got him out more times than he has reached base in which roger the dodger cant say that.|`|AA11459670	I dont think that its right that all the other pitchers have to attend everygame, and Clemens get to only show up for games he plays. This is going to hurt the yankees even more now. There will be discention among the team. Im sure that the pitchers do not like the idea of clemens coming back now|`|0qDcmqRyaa	Do I detect a bit of jealousy here, who cares what he does when he is not playing? Does where he spends his off days really effect you that much?  If I was good enough to be able to command that wherever I went to work I would definately take advantage so quit hating on Roger he is a sure fire first ballor hall of famer!|`|1965ead99baf2ec1ddbabc367b952978aa	I cannot blame him for coming back.  Seriously, would you turn down 28 million dollars for pitching a few games?<br>  <br>  There is no way in hell that he should be making that much, but if that is what someone is willing to pay, then you have to take it|`|BTvweQKdaa	i agree, the Rocket is a prime donna.<br>  He is past his prime. look how long<br>  it is to take him to get in shape.<br>  <br>  Further, the yankee's problem is more<br>  serious than that<br>  <br>  They lost a great leader when they<br>  let shetfield go. I believed that they<br>  should have try to get Matsunzka and<br>  keep big unit|`|K16FgdL7aa	well i think that its stupid that he decided to quit the astros   they were good when he was playing for them but this year they suck  but like now hes gonna start to get warmed up and play for the yankees   : )|`|Wk6cKmjYaa	I really disapprove of how he gets to wait nearly a quarter of the season before deciding whether or not to play at all, and then hand-selecting the suitor who seems most appetizing to him.<br>  <br>  And then when he finally joins the team in June, he gets to choose when and where he pitches, gets to leave the team when he's not pitching, and still comes in as the highest paid pitcher on the rotation, despite the fact that he will make over 1/3 less starts than the rest of the rotation.<br>  <br>  And on top of that, his ability to contribute is in no way guaranteed. Yes, he did put up a 2.3 ERA in Houston last year, and he probably could have won 10 games if he got better run support. However, he's pitching in the A.L. now, which of course will mean tougher batters. Not to mention that he is a year older, and despite his notorious workout ethic and discipline, 45 years old is 45 years old. I would not be surprised one bit if his ERA goes up to 4.0.<br>  <br>  Also, his contributions are not only limited by his schedule and possible physicial limitations, but his role on the team as well. Mussina, Pettite, Wang, and Clemens could potentially form a frightening starting rotation. However, much of the Yankees' ails derive from their bullpen, which is cluttered with Farnsworth, Proctor, Myers, and so forth. And worse of all, their legendary closer has only 3 saves so far, with an ERA perilously close to 6.0.<br>  <br>  Therefore, I don't believe he deserves the despicable amount of pampering he receives on principle alone, but especially since he most likely will not, and in many ways cannot, help turn the team around.

A Toulouse, c'est l'ambience sud ouest qui règne, traditionnelle, simpa, cool, agréable, teintée d'un délicieux accent de soleil, en un mot, rugbyesque!!!!! Après ?a, j'ai des potes qui soutiennent le SF( études à Paris obligent), et ils sont super simpas!!! C'est peut-être les suporteurs du BO qui sont les plus sop, non? <br>  Bon, je plaisante, mais il ne faut surtout pas que le rugby devienne comme le foot où les suporters se tapent dessus pour un rien, de vrais barbares!!!!!<br>  Et c'est clair que le ST est le meilleur club d'Europe.|`|9590bf84d0436b263c78612dbd67f0d4aa	Je pense que cette rivalité est savamment orchestré. Dans tous les sports il y a cette notion de rivalité. Les deux clubs représentent deux visions du rugby. Le Stade Fran?ais est un club jeune et très inventif dans sa communication, le Stade Toulousain est un club historique et donc plus traditionnel mais ces deux clubs sont les moteurs du rugby fran?ais.<br>  On peut reprocher au Stade Fran?ais un coté un petit peu trop Jet-Set mais il faut reconnaitre à ce club ses bonnes idées et son travail vis a vis de ses supporters (tarifs réduits, circuits organisés, Stade de France).|`|9Lv7OF0Uaa	un peu d'histoire. il est vrai que paris a gagné plus de Brennus que Toulouse ces dernières années. mais pour l'instant, Toulouse a 16 titres et paris 12. 1ère différence!! 2nde, si ce n'est pas de l'esbrouffe, pourquoi paris affiche ses 12 étoiles sur le maillot si ce n'est par nombrilisme? n'oublions pas que les premier titres obtenus l'ont été entre club parisiens, fin XIXeme, début XX siècle!! et que paris n'a rien gagné durant 90 ans!! de 1908 à 1998!! me trompe-je? et puis, combien de parisiens compose l'équipe de paris? l'accent est bien chantant lors des interview!! et puis, si on se fait iech en Province comme le dit un parigo supra, reste chez toi! et comme les parisiens ne supportent plus tant que cela le psg, même gillardi s'est mis a aimer le rugby parce que paris gagne, cela ne m'étonne pas de ce qui est arrivé au sdf en février à notre Toulousaine! j'étais à Toulouse contre le Leinster (perdu) avec des Irish un peu plein de bière! super ambiance, no fight! so? et puis, combien de coupe d'europe paris a t il ? ZERO je crois. Nous, ce serait plutot, et un, et deux, et trois (zero!!) LOL. Bon match à tous samedi|`|XPx6H0HRaa	aucune rivalité puisque aucun des 2 ira en finales<br>  <br>  <br>  asm asm asm asm asm asm asm asm asm asm asm asm asm asm asm asm asm asm asm asm ...........................................

Paris qui joue au rugby, c'est beaucoup de frime, de m'as tu vu....du Guazzini, du spectacle, du show.....tout le toutim quoi. Dans le meme temps, il y a peu de clubs a Paris ou on investit dans la formation. La preuve en est: combien sont issus d'un centre de formation local?<br>  On peut critiquer le Stade T. pour recruter ses joueurs dans d'autre clubs, Colomiers, Graulhet, Agen, Narbonne et tous les autres clubs du sud ouest brillaient, au moins jusqu'a la professionalisation. Colomiers a ete demantele par les parisiens...pas par Toulouse. <br>  De plus, le region est tres riche en clubs, et le stade toulousain est un club formateur titre maintes fois.<br>  La mentalite dans le rugby a (presque) toujours ete celle d'une lutte entre deux groupes. Lutte physique, mentale...mais toujours respectueuse. Toujours sobre et finalement inscrite dans une longue tradition. Paris n'a pas cet esprit.<br>  La starisation, je n'apprecie pas trop. Meme si certains joueurs sont loin d'etre reserves et modestes (ce qui leur sierait bien mieux), on voit l'attitude des equipes. Le souvenir de ces equipes parisiennes lors des matchs des phases finales contraste enormenent avec les matchs tout aussi engages des autres equipes. Paris a une attitude generale, une atmosphere qui contaste fortement avec celle des terroirs rugbystique traditionnels, qui, convenons en reste toujours le coeur de notre sport prefere.<br>  Cela sans parler de l'antagonisme capitale contre "le desert" francais....Une finale doit se jouer dans les honneurs, pas dans des tutus roses. <br>  Autre chose, en tant que meridional, j'ai le plus grand respect pour toutes les equipes, petites ou grandes ainsi que leurs supporters. Maintenant tu parles de "footix" et de "beaufs"....Mais c'est meconnaitre les amateurs de foot (qui ne sont pas tous des hooligans) et les beaufs (qui ne sont pas tous des bofs).<br>  Ne t'en deplaise|`|HhdUc1K2aa	Eh oui Toulouse est le meilleur club d'Europe qui sera peut-être dépassé par les Wasps s'ils gagnent encore deux titres. Je pense que la rivalité n'est pas si grande que ?a c'est juste que les deux Stades sont très forts et qu'ils ont eu les mêmes problèmes comme cette année Toulouse n'a pas été génial en début d'année avec une ligne de 3/4 méconnaissable mais ils ont su revenir tout comme Paris il y a quelques années, c'est là tout l'art du rugby. Je pense que cette rivalité n'est pas vraiment présente dans l'esprit des joueurs cette pression c'est les médias qu'il la mette, les deux Stades nous offrent à chaque match que de la magie!!!|`|YizgPNQHaa	supportrice toulousaine, je n'aime pas les supporters de Paris! Pour la simple et bonne raison que j'ai été prise à parti par un gros c..... de supporter parisien, en février dernier au stade de France, et que si je n'étais pas sportif, je lui aurait fait chier ses dents à ce bip bip bip bip!!!!!!<br>  Sinon les autres sont sympa!!!|`|ccec0d8d41512147cb96fb36b89babeaaa	Ben le rugby est un peu une religion dans le sud ouest. Et c'est un peu mal vue de se faire battre par des parisiens. etant toulousain mais ayannt vécu à paris je pense que c pour ?à. En même temps il ne peut pas trop y avoir d'animosité venant des supporters parisiens car il y a beaucoup moins de vrais connaisseurs dans les gradins que dans tous les autres clubs du top 14. et je pense que le rugby marketing a du mal à passé en province même si ce que fait le president du stade fran?àis fait est tres bien pour le rugby. (grande affiche au stade de france avec des tarifs peu chers).

Not only is he the best hitter, but he also has a gold glove.<br>  <br>  The most over rated player is Gary Matthews Jr. The guy made a web gem, he's not going to make the angels any better, he had a career year and still didn't even get a gold glove, he's garbage.<br>  <br>  Most under rated player, probably becuase he's in canada, is Vernon Wells. All together, he is one of the best outfielders in baseball, he hits, fields, and does it consistantly.|`|WRSKhWbEaa	Since im an Oak A's fan i have to say my boy SWISHER in the AL. In the NL i have to say HOWARD. The most overrated player is A-ROD b/c he gets paid so much money and still no RING. He always sucks in the playoffs.|`|7MLHrmKBaa	The best player in baseball is Johan Santana he is by far the best pitcher and the number 1 pick hands down by any major league coach if they could have 1 player of their choice for their team.  He is the guy you put in when you need a guaranteed win even wins with a week team behind him the most dangerous weapon in baseball.  <br>  <br>  The most overrated player which i hate even hearing about his highly overpaid worthlessness is Alex Rodriguez.  plain and simple iam not going to go into talking about him anymore cause that's just how it is you know why hes over rated.<br>  <br>  and finally the most under rated player in baseball is probably Grady sizemore he is the perfect 5 tool player and really doesn't get the respect he deserves for all he provides a team kinda like Shawn Marion in basketball he doesn't have the highest number in any single category but is almost the best or the top in every single one.  (a perfect fantasy player too)|`|0zaHXtUyaa	You can't really say who the best player is. You can have Ryan Howard, can hit the Home Runes but can't play defense.<br>  <br>  You can have Derek Jeter, can hit, but lacks Home Run compacity (He averages about 13 a year).<br>  <br>  Schmit, great pitcher, but lacks pitch speed. Liriano, great pitch speed, but lacks control.<br>  <br>  Every player in the league has a weakness.<br>  <br>  As for most overrated, it all depends on how you like that person.|`|2d2mjOGHaa	Over Rated: Alex Rodriguez<br>  Best Player: Player who wins the MVP<br>  Under Rated: Ken Griffey Jr.|`|AA10775305	Best:  Albert Pujols<br>  Over:  Rodger Clemens<br>  Under:  Chase Utley|`|40LuSGmaaa	The best player is (as much as this hurts me to say being a phillies fan) Albert Puljos<br>  The most overrated player in the major leaques is <br>  BARRY BONDS<br>  The most underrated player in the major leaques is<br>  Justin Morneau|`|I22asPV1aa	There is no doubt that Johan Santana is the best player in the big leagues. Santana has dominated the major pitching categories over the past three years and, given his age, he is likely to continue dominating for many years to come.<br>  <br>  As for the second part of your question, I would say that Derek Jeter is the most overrated and underrated player in MLB. While that may sound silly and impossible, it is very true. Many Derek Jeter fans think that he is much better than he is because they place too much emphasis on his "intangibles," which really doesn't mean anything. Also, many Jeter fans praise his defense, which really is well below average, his two consecutive gold gloves notwithstanding. But Jeter is also the most underrated because there are so many MLB fans who dislike him because he represents the hated Yankees. These fans refuse to admit that he is a tremendous player who excels in many facets of the game. <br>  <br>  What the underraters and overraters should be able to agree on, however, is that Jeter is a fantastic player who will be in the HOF five years after he retires.|`|fPdNBoPpaa	Best: Albert Pujols<br>  Most Overrated: Derek Jeter<br>  Underrated: Michael Young
4b1ceaa46aa120eb6b53d8602b81f757aa	Baseball is about pitching primarily and they have the pitching to be in for the long haul.

cf2152f391507f4007682eae5f0c5665aa	Laporte ne me para?t pas être le genre d'entra?neur à garder à joueur s'il n'a pas sa place. Regarde Magne, qui était un des leaders de l'équipe de France, il ne joue plus. Pelous, en France comme à Toulouse, c'est une énorme gueule, qui sait parler et motiver ses joueurs, plus les cadrer quand ils s'énervent : TOUT ce qu'un capitaine doit faire. De plus, physiquement, il tient encore la route. A part Thion, personne n'est meilleur que lui en 2ème ligne. Alors, c'est sur que 80 minutes, en plus contre les Blacks (qui avaient aligné leur meilleure équipe), il a eu du mal (mais comme tout le monde, même Jauzion ou Rougerie ont souffert). Certes le carton jaune a porté préjudice à l'équipe (ce qui témoigne d'une rage de vaincre, un peu mal contr?lée), mais le résultat pendant 10 minutes n'a pas trop changé (même si la fatigue a du se faire sentir pour les 14 restants).<br>  Et, pour achever mon propos, malheureusement, qui mettre à la place, qui saura faire aussi bien?? Nallet et Papé sont bons, mais ils ne disposent pas de l'expérience de Pelous. Quand Pelous parle, ce sont 110 sélections qui s'expriment... Durant la coupe du monde, ce sera toujours ?a de plus pour bien gérer les futures difficultés. Et Pelous, qui la veut cette coupe, saura transmettre cette expérience, et cette rage au combat. On en aura bien besoin pour gagner la coupe.<br>  ALLEZ LES BLEUS !!|`|9b5f29ea6753ec2de97660dafe9edf75aa	Comme joueur titulaire NON, il est épuisé, au bout du rouleau physiquement...<br>  Comme cadre rempla?ant, capable d'apporter sur le plan humain OUI, car il a une grande expérience et un bon mental!|`|0e160f94fa5773977ba47c0f69c66766aa	La coupe du monde arrive 1 an trop tard pour lui, peut-etre que Laporte, lui aussi meme chose, le mettra au vert suffisamment longtemps afin qu' il retrouve la peche et qu' il se concentre sur le jeu, car difficile de trouver une autre locomotive de cette qualite|`|3c878a39d487a3c0f2753f7f99412ba6aa	Non c'etait un bon joueur mais il est en fin de carrière, il y a quelques années  que de nombreux jeunes 2eme ligne auraient du le remplacer mais ce n'est pas la politique de l'encadrement qui préfére perdre avec d'anciens joueurs que de risqué de gagner avec l'explosivité de la jeunesse c'est un peu le mal de l'hémisphère nord|`|61928f3e0fa270caadc72b70d037100baa	Il ira à la coupe du Monde en 2007 sauf blessure et ?a sera fini pour lui !<br>  Il a beaucoup donné en EdF et en rugby .<br>  Place aux jeunes !|`|8b25a0fe27e9206983b7cf439743c651aa	je ne crois pas qu'il ait encore sa place en équipe de France.

Il devrait laisser sa place à quelqu'un d'autre.|`|fe24149fe815782e50c280bf1c7ae138aa	Il a 100 selections... il est un peu usé, maintenant... entre Toulouse... les matches FFR , matches test etc... il a largement gagné... au sens propre comme au figuré; une retraite dorée!!!!|`|12e49b172394fc842570f4385cff64a2aa	je pense que non, cela fait bien longtemps que la PELOUS n'a pas été tondu|`|17550b3d8dd800a0192d9cceaaa1d1e9aa	il faut qu'il quitte la pelouse.|`|2874f225864906426e87099687dae2f6aa	Oui en jouant une mi-temps comme lors du 1er test contre les All-Black.<br>  Et en le ménageant un peu lui évitant les matchs inutiles en club et en sélection.|`|3be09198dd62082d03d7fbc9a8120af6aa	Bon au titre de me répéter encore un peu. Oui Fabien Pelous est plus proche de la fin que du début. Oui il est un peu fatigué. Oui il a du mal à tenir 80 minutes de jeu intensif. Mais, oui il a encore de la ressource. Déjà en 2001, après une saison cahotique nombre était ce qui lui avait réservé une chambre avec vue dans une maison de retraite. Mais il est revenu à un très bon niveau. Ok, vous allez me dire c'était y a 5 ans, il était jeune à l'époque ! Mais, il peux encore faire la différence sur les percussions. Regardez bien les regroupements et les placages, il y est. Et honnêtement j'aimerais pas me retrouver face à lui.<br>  Il a envie d'aller jusqu'à la coupe du monde et ?a peut faire pas mal la différence. Il a le mental pour amener l'équipe jusqu'au bout.<br>  Mais c'est vrai que l'on peut se poser la question au vu de cette mi-saison, mais je pense que les autres joueurs fran?ais sont un peu dans le même état de fatigue. Ils ont de grosses saisons (entre les différentes compétitions, les entra?nement l'EDF, les stages et compagnies...) vous vous rendez compte comme ?a doit épuiser.<br>  Et je ne suis pas s?re que Laporte comme Noves garderait un joueur qui n'a plus rien à donner. Ils sont pas philanthropes...|`|3cc1218da8b72ffb56918b1e62e6c2c1aa	Il me semble clair qu'il s'approche de le fin. <br>  Il manque plus de ma?trise qu'avant comme le démontre le carton qu'il prend samedi.<br>  <br>  Ceci dit, qui s'impose de manière indiscutable à sa place ?<br>  <br>  Le grand silence suivant cette question est une réponse.|`|b2f786c0eb2967f3847b470abca1b09caa	Franchement, au niveau de l'engagement physique, rien à dire... Papé et Nallet ont fait moins bien. Mais il ne se ma?trise plus, il collectionne les mauvais gestes et pas seulement au niveau international...  Trop, c'est trop! 10 minutes a 14 et 3 points de plus pour l'équipe adverse, personne ne peut se le permettre dans le rugby moderne.|`|e3cfa3212b3f1e22526595c4b899ca5baa	fabien pelous a été un grand joueur de l'équipe de france. J'ai bien amployé le passé dans ma réponse c'est volontaire. <br>  Ce cher fabien est usé par les longues années qu'il a passé au plus haut niveau et a du mal à etre performant autant en club qu'en sélection.<br>  Il n'est même pas un vrai leader pour son équipe car il ne dirige même pas les echauffements de l'équipe. <br>  Mais j'ai bien peur qu'il aille tout de même à la Coupe du Monde et qu'il soit capitaine|`|12c377e7572fa757e09c7f72b31e96a7aa	Non. Je pense qu'il faut laisser ca places au jeunes.|`|8fcd7dc40ddb066e2cfbb59f765d8a6daa	Clairement il n'a plus sa place en tant que titulaire, même s'il est toujours bien présent dans le combat. <br>  Ses derniers matches avec les bleus ou avec Toulouse ont été bien médiocres, en plus des cartons jaunes qu'il prend régulièrement. <br>  <br>  Comme rempla?ant apportant son vécu et son expérience, pourquoi pas...|`|b4077a4dfeaed77bb0c83b6ab2da4129aa	oui il a sa place malgré son age s'il est toujours à son poste il doit y avoir une raison par contre en tant que capitaine sa retraite a sonné. Les jeunes n'ont pas réussis à le détr?ner|`|c9288cf2734693bcd6f4db4115aadfbdaa	Non car il est rouiller et faitguer palce au jeune|`|efa254d93ada599d726399e902ef0ff0aa	Fabien PELOUS a été un très grand joueur et capitaine.Maintenant,c'est vrai,il est moins performant,mais c'est pas pour autant qu'il faut le jeter.Il attend de participer à sa dèrnière coupe du monde en France et,meme s'il souffre en match,il est indispensable d'abord de par son aura et par lefait qu'il rassure les jeunes et qu'il les conditionne.Mais sa situation n'est pas simple parcequ'il doit "bosser"sur tous les "tableaux"(je m'explique:championnat,coupe d'europe,équipe de France) et qu'il ne sait pas quoi mettre en avant.Pour ma part je le laisserai en place meme comme capitaine.
b743f8cf8cfd798cfa534265c00a2ee7aa	en France il y a effectivement une césure forte entre le sud où c'est un sport majeur et le nord où le rugby vit dans l'ombre du football et dans une moindre mesure d'autres sports collectifs (basket, hand, volley ...) hormis l'Ile-de-France qui est depuis longtemps le plus gros comité (ce qui n'a que peu de rapport avec la réussite - remarquable d'ailleurs - du stade Fran?ais, auparavant le RCF et le PUC en étaient les fleurons ). <br>  Qui plus est, le succès va au succès. Je veux dire par là que lorsque tu résides dans un département où il y a deux clubs (?a m'est arrivé !) il faut une sacrée motivation pour jouer sachant que les déplacements les plus courts c'est cent bornes.<br>  Dans les autres pays, même ceux où le rugby intéresse comme le Japon, l'Italie, l'Argentine, ce n'est pas un sport majeur. Si l'on trouve toujours quelques passionnés qui joueront quoi qu'il arrive, le grand public a tendance à voler au secours du succès et à se pencher sur les sports qui réussissent. <br>  Ces derniers temps, les handballeuses ou les biathlètes sont arrivés au moins de manière épisodique sur le devant de la scène. J'imagine que dans les autres pays c'est pareil, or l'écart entre les nations historiquement fortes et les autres demeure important, les seuls championnats professionnels et bien structurés s'y trouvent, du coup faute de résultats vraiment marquants les autres pays ont du mal à faire parler d'eux et à susciter des vocations.<br>  Dans ce sens, il est bien dommage par exemple que la prochaine coupe du monde ait été attribuée une fois de plus à la Nlle-Zélande plut?t qu'au Japon, avec ce genre d'attitude conservatrice le rugby risque de demeurer longtemps un microcosme.<br>  C'est pourtant un sport porteur de valeurs fortes et dans lequel rêgne un excellent état d'esprit, tachons déjà de faire en sorte qu'il le reste.|`|60fda6a312a65c0197ec1a753e6232abaa	Rome ne s'est pas faite en un jour... et je te trouve bien sévère.<br>  En France, on a vu la renaissance d'un grand club à Paris... ce qui porte le nombre de licenciés dans le comité IDF (+grand comité en nombre de licenciés!), ce qui crée des débouchés immédiats pour les jeunes d'IDF via d'autres structures qui se développent (Bobigny, Massy...). Et d'autres clubs viennent (lentement c'est vrai) à un niveau correct (Nantes/Saint Nazaire). A titre d'info, le petit club de Livry-Gargan dans le 93 a envoyé des gamins jouer à l'USAP ou au SF, et a doublé l'effectif de son école de rugby un an avant la coupe du monde... Enfin, jamais les stades de l'élite n'ont été aussi pleins (rends toi compte que le foot n'a jamais mis 80 000 spectateurs dans un stade pour un match de L1... chose qui arrive 2 fois par an avec le SF (même si la qualité des spectateurs laisse parfois à désirer) !<br>  Enfin, au niveau international, l'Italie et l'Argentine sont maintenant de vraies nations de classe internationale, la Roumanie revit peu à peu, le Canada et les Etats-Unis se replacent de même que la Géorgie, le Portugal, l'Espagne...<br>  NON : crois moi, ?a ne va pas si mal que ?a !<br>  En revanche, si on eut accélerer le processus, il serait peut être bon d'intégrer dans la Pro D2 (pas la peine d'espérer en Top 14) 3 sélections régionales (Ouest, Nord, Est) prises en charge par la fédé avec garantie de maintien (une sote d'investissement)...|`|6d4eaa645427e1aa3a3d6163378dc9f9aa	Même si tu noircis un peu le tableau, il est évident que le Rugby peine encore à s'imposer je vois plusieurs facteurs à cela :<br>  <br>  - Une trop grande disparité de niveau entre les nations historiques et les nations émergentes : on sait à peu près quelles seront les affiches de 1/2 finales de la prochaine coupe du monde ( les 3 nations de l'hémisphére sud et la France ou l'Angleterre). Donc finalement peu de surprise et de suspens.<br>  -Une complexité au niveau du réglement<br>  -Une image brutale qui peut déplaire même si la violence reste cantonné au terrain (et c'est tant mieux)<br>  -Un sport peu facile à pratiquer hors club contrairement au foot ou au basket qui ne nécessite finalement que 2 ou 3 amis, un ballon et un terrain.<br>  <br>  Maintenant est ce forcément uen mauvaise chose que le rugby ne soit pas au même niveau que le foot, je n'en suis pas convaincu.|`|a83c3fcbb1fabefddd9045e38a17520caa	A mon avis, parce que s'est un sport très viril, avec des règles un peu plus compliquées que les autre sports.<br>  Exemple le hors jeu n'a rien à voir avec celui du foot.<br>  Pourtant c'est bien dommage, car c'est certainement le sport le plus éducatif qui existe.<br>  Par exemple les spectateurs respectent les joueurs;<br>  Les joueurs respectent les arbitres. <br>  C'est ce que l'on apprend dans les écoles de rugby.<br>  De plus c'est le seul sport où l'on voit huit joueurs qui se regroupent pour gagner et conserver le ballon, pour en faire le sport le plus collectif. <br>  Giraudoux disait " le rugby est la représentation parfaite d'une société très équilibrée" en citant les différents postes et les qualités pnhysiques nécessaires pour les occuper. <br>  Sa promotion passe par le professionalisme malheureusement et je pense qu'il y perdra une bonne partie de son esprit et de sa raison d'exister.|`|d3354d0684972e7f16c6e0eaca68c159aa	Pour ma part, je pense qu'il a déjà beaucoup évolué, j'ai vu récemment les premières images d'un match avec le stade Toulousain et avec la présentation des joueurs. Je peux te dire qu'il y a un gros changement, les joueurs ont un gabarit bien différent depuis 10 ans, les masses que tu peux voir évoluer sur le terrain n'étaient pas là avant, des joueurs d'un gabarit moyen ont de la difficulté à s'en sortir.<br>  <br>  Pour ce qui est de son expansion, il devrait y avoir plus de diffusion à la télévision, c'est un canal très fort pour promouvoir un sport, regarde le tennis avec la populaire retransmission annuelle de Roland Garros (avant cela le tennis n'était pas un sport aussi populaire, il était réservé à une élite). Donc je vois bien une bonne évolution après la diffusion de la coupe du monde, surtout si la France figure bien dans la compétition.|`|0110115d83094e048fc17b56dbc5184baa	parce que les gens ont des préjugés. ils pensent que c'est un sport de brutes. <br>  mais si ?a peut te rassurer de plus en plus d'enfants se tournent vers ce sport (dt bcp de filles).il suffit d'assister à des rencontres entre les clubs pr s'en rendre compte. <br>  faut être patient!!! de plus le rugby véhicule une image plus positive que le foot. les gens commencent à assister aux matchs, à aller voir de grandes rencontres car ils sentent que l'ambiance est conviviale.|`|3263ef0ac10816091fb1a81303b920e9aa	Une réflexion personnelle sur la difficulté du rugby à se développer :  l'argent à contribuer à l'expansion du football et en particulier dans les agglomérations et donc à créer un mouvement permettant une réussite  sociale  ( l'équipe de France est l'illustration de ce mouvement)<br>  Le rugby est rester trop longtemps hors du circuit argent et donc à pris énormément de retard dans son développement malgré la mise en place du professionnalisme et des efforts  de certains club ( stade Toulousain, stade Fran?ais).<br>  La promotion du rugby passe par  une diffusion télévisuelle sur les cha?nes non payantes, par l'organisation de match du style stade Fran?ais au stade de France ( 80000 personnes  il du potentiel hors des régions de rugby) et une mise en place dans les écoles ( primaires, secondaires, facultés) d'un programme d'enseignement de ce sport.|`|4cd794626bff95dfbcc03b1644abd87aaa	C'est tres bien comme ?a, il ne faut surtout pas que ?a devient du foot !.|`|8a78f72d9c1672e97b85fc8032abacb5aa	car il y a pas beaucoup de pays dans le monde qui y joue et il viens jusque d'être professionnel|`|cd8cd808b0ddc3fc96408f15ef20abccaa	Est-ce vraiment une difficultés ?

It is a very valid question because one guy gets alot more touches than the other and both play bad rush defenses.  To answer your question, I'd have to say Brees or possibly P.Manning.

When an athelete acts that way he not only gains negative publicity, but no matter how good he is, nobody wants him on their team because he is a headache. Two good examples are TO, who we all know, and Albert Bell. Bell was a phenomenal player who had a bad temper and attitude, and therefore bounced around many different teams, not because people didn't like his abilities, but people couldn't get along with him. Certain sports, especially basketball, need good team chemistry to win.

G8F2zkn2aa	The Lions front office personell knows that if they fail to compete this year, heads will be rolling out the front office door. Therefore I foresee them trading the #2 pick to Tampa for the #4 pick and a third and fifth rounder. With pick #4 they will either take defensive lineman Gaines Adams of Clemson or Joe Thomas of Wisconsin. Either of those players would help the Lions win RIGHT NOW.<br>  With their additional 3rd rd pick they would take QB Troy Smith, Ohio St and find a total gem who could watch and learn from Kitna for a year or two.<br>  With their additional 5th rounder they could take either Ahmad Bradshaw, Marshall or Garrett Wolfe of Northern Illinois. These two players are so talented, yet underrated, whoever gets either of them in these later rounds will be very, very pleased.<br>  One thing is certain in my mind...if the Lions take Brady Quinn at #2 instead of trading out of that spot, their team will have the best QB in the draft. However, the Lions need many other pieces to win right now and the draft could provide those pieces if they are smart enough to make some moves.|`|1965ead99baf2ec1ddbabc367b952978aa	ESPN is predicting they will take calvin johnson.  That would be the fourth receiver in the last five drafts taken in the first round.|`|AA11396390	I think they are looking to trade their pick but if they don't, they'll take Clemson defensive end Gaines Adams.|`|MJ0kxZM2aa	the lions have alot of picks they can do including Calvin Johnson, Brady Quinn, Adrian Peterson, but i think they will pick Gaines Adams the defensive end out of Clemson|`|UzXSf5Dbaa	Matt Millen has to turn things around quickly or he's gone. <br>  <br>  I think he's going to gamble, hope he pans out quick and take Brady Quinn. <br>  <br>  Joe Thomas or Gaines Adams potentially can't save his job.|`|YV26m89paa	I don't think that the Lions will stay at number two. I believe that they will trade with the Bucs so Tampa can secure their pick in CJ and Detroit would be able to take Gaines Adams at fourth and have more picks in later rounds.|`|aADpNGWVaa	They should get Joe Thomas but they could end up trading their pick, Brady Quinn is possible but not likely.

McyNKwqTaa	Toi, bien s?r. <br>  Si tu as les qualités combinées des trois autres.<br>  Skrela, Traille, Michalak.<br>  Quant aux réticences vis à vis de Michalak...on en a trop fait en 2003, et en même temps, personne ne l'a protégé de la pression, et de ce nouveau statut de chouchou du public et d'idole des femmes, pendant la compétition. Il a explosé en vol, c'était prévisible. Il n'a pas été le seul à perdre la demie finale. Il a le talent de revenir. Il a d? réapprendre un peu l'humilité sur le terrain (en dehors, je ne sais pas, il est très sollicité, ?a doit pas être simple de trouver l'équilibre). <br>  Ce qui me rend sceptique, c'est notamment la finale du TOP 14, où il a une très grosse responsabilité, un festival de feintes de plaquages (Toulouse lui doit 2 essais), de coups de pieds approximatifs, de manque d'audace, de vista. <br>  Et c'est un peu méchant mais je crois assez vrai, s'il n'était pas sorti sur blessure, il serait une fois de plus sorti sous les sifflets. On attend trop de lui ? qu'est-ce que ce sera face à des adversaires plus coriaces, dans des conditions plus tendues ? <br>  Entendons-nous, il est peut-être plus magique, plus brillant, plus étonnant, que les autres 10 sélectionnables, mais moins fiable. <br>  Et ce ne serait pas si inquiétant s'il n'était pas à ce point défendu bec et ongle, mais sans argument, par le staff.|`|4e7197cdbe29fe67b02cd6a50d931507aa	Un 10 sans pied et a la defence aleatoire, non merci!<br>  <br>  Skrela est pas un genie, mais il a les fondamentaux du poste, et c'est monstre defnsif.

En tout cas c'est le mieux placé pour gagner le respect de ses ainés. T'as vu la réaction quand il s'est fait sécher par un anglais pdt le dernier 6 nations.

En effet fort de leur colonnie, la prospérité faisant de l'Angleterre une grande puissance, la jeunesse de ce pays s'ennuyait ferme et le sport  était un éxutoire pour ses enfants de bonne familles desoeuvrés. Ces sports faisaient partis du cursus scolaire.<br>  <br>  Le rugby, comme d'autres sports arriva en France par l'intermédiaire de l'éducation nationale (qui ne s'appelait pas encore comme ?a).D'abord cantonné à la région parisienne, peu à peu, les maitres d'école formés à Paris et mutés dans le sud ouest ont fait connaitre ce jeu. Ce sont eux qui distillérent la passion du jeu à leur éléves. <br>  Dans le sud existait déjà un jeu similaire appelé "la Soule"(basé sur la conquête d'une panse de brebis, qui se jouait entre village), aussi c'est naturellement que ce jeu basé sur le contact, le défi physique, le collectif trouve echo dans ses populations fiéres et bagareuses du sud ouest.|`|e3cfa3212b3f1e22526595c4b899ca5baa	pour ton info le plus grand comité de France en terrme de licenciés est précisement celui d'Ile de France. <br>  Je pense que cette passion pour le rugby est un gout pour le sport ou le défi physique est prépondérant|`|ce59136458a31504821dad8487457fefaa	Je n'en ai aucune idée si ce n'est que cela s'apparante plus aux jeux de force basque que la choucroutte partie dans le nord...<br>  <br>  <br>  Pardon, je m'en vais...<br>  <br>  <br>  Je suis né en alsace....<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Mais je suis 8 maintenant depuis 4 ans...|`|392cf5881280016803e7201448077a7baa	je sais pas du tout...<br>  Parce que l'on fait souvent la fete ? les ferias... et que ca rappelle les 3eme mi-temps...<br>  Non sans rire clairmeent j'en sais rien !

Was this because of Tevez?! or because they finally realised that they were really in the dog do if they didn′t earn their weekly crust. <br>  <br>  There is no doubt that the whole team were putting more effort into their game, NRC who was absent for most of the season,  for example. He showed more determination at the end, as did most. Again was this solely down to Tevez?! One man a team does not make. But he can be a catalyst i suppose.<br>  <br>  What ever the reason for our upturn, our future was forged out on the pitch amidst furore fired at the club from teams whose performance was lacking the final kill. These teams have been looking for an excuse for their own poor showings by deflecting the blame onto a club who just got on and did the job in hand. Something they themselves should have done instead of taking their eyes off the ball.<br>  <br>  Like you said, they should except the decision and get on with it they are only making fools of themselves.|`|4a664168ba86620d2fde5f63a1063082aa	They cheated.<br>  <br>  They lied.<br>  <br>  The knowingly cheated again.<br>  <br>  They lied about cheating.<br>  <br>  They then admitted to everything when it looked like they were in trouble.<br>  <br>  It's a disgrace, if it was done at amateur level they would of been moved down two or three divisions.|`|fe0c03f518a923667c11dc4d2077c0a2aa	i am a neutral so i dont have any axes to grind west ham broke the rules and only got a ￡5 million fine its peanuts in terms of staying in the premiership they should have been deducted points no arguements the fa shouldnt have let them off i hope fifa recommend that it is dealt with properly as to who stays up thats a different issue altogether but west ham should go down orall premier clubs should protest|`|s6PKsxDTaa	The Hammers were always the best team out of the relegation lot anyway, but the whole Tevez Mascherano affair allowed the likes of Warnock to paper over his own teams short comings|`|u0BbsR2saa	yes and to win all them games towards the end of the season, they worked hard and deserve to be in the prem!!

After that's out of the way, punch the most fragile part of a person's body, the throat.<br>  <br>  --If it's only one person, and they're unarmed, it's easy.

AA11518036	Bill Hall.|`|nUBHs0dAaa	it depends what you need more for your team. i don't know that i would go for verlander this year but if it was me i would probably dump lowell as youkilis also plays 3B so lowell isn't an everyday guy. on the other hand hall might not be either, i haven't followed him this year to know his situation|`|ebaad9ef6100d3944ecaad5bbf4b8a1aaa	lowell|`|eq2fpWnNaa	It's hard to say without knowing who else is on your team.  If you really need the pitching help, I'd trade either of them.  Hall has better position eligibility, so if you like moving people around, he comes in handy.  Lowell is performing well above his career average, but he is a more disciplined hitter and is playing great this year.  I'd probably trade Hall.

AA10651628	I have it, and its great. Aside from blacking out games in your area, they are usually very good with games. The quality is pretty good. Once in a while they will have serious issues with a game and you wont be able to watch it. At the beginning of the season, it was terrible- you couldn't watch anything and when the video showed up it was slow, dragging and the audio was 5 seconds ahead of the video.<br>  <br>  Its not perfect, but if your a baseball fan, or a fantasy baseball fan, its good to watch whichever games you want anywhere you want.|`|lECv9Adaaa	It depends.  If you are not within your favorite team's market, then it is worth it.  There are several games that are transmitted to the net on their 700kbps feed from the game's HD feed.  It won't be full HD, but it'll still be awesome.<br>  <br>  MLB.com has a utility that determines if you have any blackouts.  You put in the zip code and it will tell you.  It's on the bottom of their MLB.tv home page.<br>  <br>  If it doesn't black out your team, then go ahead and get it!<br>  <br>  NOTE: they also have Gameday Radio, which is only $20 each year and has NO BLACKOUTS!!!  You can listen to up to four different feeds for each team! (home feed, away feed, spanish home feed, spanish away feed, all as available)  Gameday Radio is included if you get MLB.tv.|`|102215196f619982b2e950cc0192cc61aa	You can try <a href="http://www.freebaseballradio.com/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.freebaseballradio.com/index.h...</a> and see if it works for you first before you pay, you can see some games online.|`|1965ead99baf2ec1ddbabc367b952978aa	I have the standard mlb.tv package and I love it.  If you are looking for 1 team to watch that is out of market then I would suggest going with the standard package.  DO NOT PURCHASE IT TO WATCH LOCAL GAMES.  It will be blacked out in your area.<br>  <br>  One nice feature is that if you miss a game and don't want to watch the whole thing, you can pick an inning to start in, or watch a condensed version of the game.<br>  <br>  All the games are archived as well, so if you miss a game, you can still see it days later|`|75If2Wkjaa	no becaue if you pay it will be $120 next year and more and more and more. Do not pay and do not subscribe and they bring it down to $30 a year. this is a rip off.|`|R8ISgeN3aa	To me it is because where I live, I only get to see roughly 30 Yankees games a year.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, if I liked the Cardinals, I could see them all.|`|RwvNjAL3aa	If you're a baseball fan and if you live out of market of your team, yes it is.  However, you also have to be willing to watch from your computer and not the comforts of your couch.  <br>  <br>  I can live with watching on the computer and in this house, baseball is always on.  Even when there is an "off" night for my team, I'm watching something else.  Maybe even a favorite game from last year, last month or last week.

The diamond and the field itself are also much smaller so that you wouldn't have to run as far because they thought girls couldn't throw the ball as far or as fast as boys.<br>  <br>  Well, no kidding.  It's that big heavy ball's fault!  It's harder to hit, catch and throw than a baseball (and we have smaller hands)!<br>  <br>  I think girls should play baseball.  Stress studies have shown that women have better stamina then men and make better decisions under pressure.  The smaller, lighter ball is easier to catch and throw.  When you hit a baseball, it goes farther.|`|AA10009548	The answer to that, as with most sports question is: Then had to decide on some parameters, and that's what they picked and codified.

yBLKdu6raa	**I highly recommend you do not try any of this**<br>  <br>  It purely depends on the type of bat being used.  Aluminum softball bats can be juiced by shaving the inner walls of the bat. However, doing this to an aluminum bat greatly reduces the lifespan, and it can weaken the walls of the bat to the point of breaking when a ball is hit.<br>  <br>  Composite bats can be juiced in a few ways as well; however the same loss in durability will occur.  What a lot of guys do in my league are three things: <br>  <br>  --Pop the end caps and end-load a lighter bat (26oz) thus creating more bat speed through impact due to inertia<br>  <br>  --Have the bat compressed to "break-in" the composite material<br>  <br>  --Buy a non-approved bat like an Ultra II, remove all the labels and re-label it as a legal bat.<br>  <br>  I was pretty shocked to find out that a lot of the people I play with every week do one of the following to their bats. Some claim they do it purely for Home Run Derbies or Exhibitions, but I think it's a lot of junk.  <br>  <br>  The biggest problem I have with the practice is the fact that people get hurt.  My third-basemen had his left forearm broke by a short-hopper hit by some dude that still had the needle hanging out of his ***.  Come to find out, he was using a Miken Ultra II that was re-labeled as a Miken Freak 98.  It can get really dangerous when you're playing on 60' bases and guys are swinging juiced bats at you.  I have guys that hit bombs constantly say they wished they could hit the ball the way I do, and I don't hit home runs often at all.   I've got to the point where I can place the ball just about anywhere I want.  To me and a lot of other people, that's more dangerous than someone that constantly hits bombs.|`|AA12200210	you can't really juice aluminium bat.  juicing bats is applicable in wood bats because cork is a more reactive material.  power in metal bats is based on compression so there is no way to juice a bat without adding compression to the chamber|`|aDPZghKOaa	you don't need to juice a softball bat .. its already done for you .. just buy a rockettech made by anderson, a catalyst by louisville slugger, or a synergy by easton .. they have special technology that makes the ball fly .. trust me. . if you try a regular bat and then one of those .. you can see a huge difference|`|5RdhKI5Iaa	You can't, smart.

And I'm only a sophmore|`|AA11232991	WR!!!!!!!!! wr arent that big anyway and tes are soo, shoot for that, but you got to have great hands and speed|`|GULTdj4Eaa	you probably dont weigh quite enough to play tight end.  at most schools you need to be a pretty good blocker.  you could play reciever or any of the db spots.  most tight ends need to block linebackers that can be 6'3" and 230lbs.  good luck at whatever spot you choose to play.|`|OT9Z9dYraa	if u want to play tightend u need to put on more muscule to help with blocking i suggestwr if u have good hands|`|yWDjl2ZLaa	Since you're skinny you're probably pretty fast and you could play WR if you can catch or RB if you can run and evade. TE is for people who like to do both basically.

MsPoQHVzaa	The previous answers are good tips, but they have nothing to do with creating arc on your shot.  Arc is a direct result of your follow-through.  In order to get arc you need to make sure your follow through is high.  The way you can check to see if your follow through is high enough is that your elbow should be above your eyes.|`|PCFn3Vveaa	There isn't necessarily a drill, focus on shooting the basketball aimed somewhere on the back rim (or just over the front of the rim). Other than that, head to the gym and take 500 shots tomorrow, and don't leave until you're satisfied with the way you're shooting. Its the only way to get better.|`|FUelQMGjaa	Make sure you are bending your knees and getting good elevation and not just standing flat footed when shooting.  Be sure to follow thru properly (flicking the wrist as it is sometimes called).  Don't shoot with your palms.  Make sure the ball rolls off of your fingertips.

AA12115018	Let's see: <br>  3 championships <br>  TD record. Highest single-game rating<br>  Highest single-season rating<br>  Highest total passing touchdowns in a game<br>  Highest total passing yards in a game<br>  Highest total passing yards in a season<br>  Lowest interception total in a season<br>  Largest touchdown to interception difference<br>  87 - 24 regular season record, 14 - 3 postseason as a starter for a total of 101 - 27<br>  Fastest QB to reach 100 wins. Second place? Joe Montana.<br>  I'd say he was pretty darn good. Good enough to be a first ballot hall of famer. I personally think that he is the greatest of all time. Two years ago I would've said Joe Montana, but now it's definitely Super Tom.<br>  <br>  1 - Brady<br>  2 - Montana<br>  3 - Marino 61,000 + yards but no championship<br>  4 - Graham<br>  5 - Favre<br>  6 - Unitis<br>  7 - Elway<br>  8 - Manning<br>  9 - Tarkenton<br>  10 - Bradshaw|`|9d537b726f4a147f0e61858f11a6b659aa	yes of course he'll be in the HOF. What he's done and brought to NE speaks for itself look at them now their garbage. And honestly yes I would consider him the greatest of all time. Not for the records but because of the calm resilient cool QB he is . Also based on his success . No QB in NFL history has been as consistently successful in the postseason as Brady he's 14-3 with 3 superbowls and his level of difficulty keeps increasing.|`|y8MI97bAaa	What the hell. Greatest QB? That's absolutely ludicrous. Peyton is better than him.<br>  <br>  Even if he retires now, he'll still be a HOF. Probably not first ballot though.<br>  <br>  I'll rank him in top 10. Maybe 5-6.|`|vnj2VDYraa	Hall of Fame Yes. Greatest QB ever no... There are many QB's that deserve to be ranked higher than him... Joe Montana, Joe Nameth, Brett Favre, Dan Marino, Terry Bradshaw, Steve Young... So I'd give him a top ten but no number one|`|AA11511615	Well, I wouldn't call him the greatest QB of all time by any means, but he has won three Superbowls, so I guess that would get him considered for the Hall of Fame.|`|19nQDjEmaa	100% yes! 3 Super Bowls speaks for itself! He is a true leader! I still think Joe Montana was the greatest quarterback ever!|`|TCehI17kaa	No doubt he's good but far from the greatest of all time in my opinion.|`|oKlD65njaa	yes he is|`|42a808600b09bd222d75e11f7e961238aa	You might make a case for him to be a Hall of Famer but I just don't give it to him. Yeah he's been good for a few years and yeah he's won 3 Superbowls but its just a few years. Talk to me in another 5 or 6 if he goes that long. The Rings may get him in alone. I would rank him in the top 25 of all time and that's damn good considering all I've seen. Like Unitas, Jurgenson, Namath, Tarkenton, Gabriel, Marino, Montana etc etc you get the picture. |`|nC3V9e5jaa	Brady will be in the hall. You seem to go in once you win a Super Bowl as a QB. He does have good numbers but he is not the best of all time. Maybe top ten. I look at some of the greats an they all have the same guys around them. A great receiver, good TE , a good line and a great back. One credit I will give Brady is he always stands in the pocket and follows thru with his throw even when he knows he is going to get popped.<br>  |`|KFvfXx2faa	Is this a serious question?  3 superbowl wins? 16-0 regular season? WOW  watch some football kid<br>  <br>  How can manning be better than Brady? First idiot who answered this does not follow football at all.|`|IQZNkeNzaa	I don't like the pats but you have to give credit to the guy.  He will be a first ballot hall-a-famer if he retired today.|`|XLXncQu9aa	Well, I would say he is 3rd on the all time list.  You have Joe Montana, and you have Joe Namath.  If Brady were to never take another snap, I would have to say that he is a hall of famer.  His numbers point to this, and the amount of championships.  The reason why he isn't number one on the all time list yet, is because he still hasn't completed his career.  Also Montana and Namath had a lot more success in their era.  Not championship wise but statistically they were slightly better.  But as his career winds down, he will move up to number 1 if he continues to play well. |`|fHxpycJSaa	Three Super Bowl rings as a starter. A season with 50 TD passes. First ballot, guaranteed.............The people (ESPN) who get all jacked up and call him the greatest ever are stupid. Top Ten, yes. Best ever, absolutely rediculous.|`|pDwQgwvRaa	He will be a HOF.  On my list of quarterbacks I have him tied for fifth with Peyton.  Ahead of them are Montana, Unitas, Graham and Elway.  People tend to forget about Graham in that he played ten seasons and his team went to the championship game each year.  They won 7 out of the 10.  When Montana was asked who he considered to be the best quarterback his answer was, "Otto Graham."|`|q0rDcTSRaa	Yes he would be a hall of famer. He would be a top 10 QB. Tom Brady has done enough and he has accomplished enough to where you can say if he never takes another snap he is a first ballot hall of famer.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|4045eeb32c4ef2d7acd08239fb1eff37aa	I would imagine he will get into the Hall even based on current stats, and his Super Bowl wins.  As for greatest QB of all time...I'm still more likely to say Joe Montana, or Brett Favre are better choices for that title.|`|hfEGHKePaa	Nope. His number just aren't HOF status yet. Don't worry, it's not like he's never going to play ever again anyways, so need for such a scary philosophy!

BwFZJ9Nraa	How bout 'em BABY!! I love how we've played so far, but with our division clearly the best in football, our season is far from deserving major credit.  Okay, we did go to Dallas AND Philly and come away victorious, but we also got embarassed by the Giants.  Yes, it was only a 9 point game but anyone who watched it knows it was more like a 20 point game because we weren't about to put many more points on the board.  Now I know that was week 1, and we've gotten better, but let's stay humble so we don't eat our words like Cowboys fans do when they guarantee wins against us.  I believe our true tests are here in the next 2 weeks.  We have 2 home games vs. 2 pretty awful teams in St. Louis and Cleveland.  If we take care of them, with Shawn Springs, Marcus Washington, and Jason Taylor hopefully coming back soon, we'll have legit talks about postseason sucess.<br>  UNTIL THEN, GO REDSKINS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|qov5T21Daa	Im impressed<br>  Beating the Eagles and Cowdung on the road is NOT easy.

LJY7agfYaa	Yes! An interesting question at last! I've been browsing this section and all I saw are questions about King and his whole family!! What a horrible thing to happen don't you think?<br>  <br>  Well to answer the question I think it's George Mikan. Back in the days where he was the most dominant figure, teams employed a play where when they lead the game against the Minneapolis Lakers they would hold the ball so long even letting the game end just to ensure the win!<br>  <br>  That's how terrified teams are against Mikan's Lakers! So the NBA opted to end all this by instigating a new rule where they try limiting ball possesion. Thus the introduction of the 24-sec shot clock.<br>  <br>  Additional: <br>  <br>  Hey everybody have references so I'll add my reference just to be sure I'll be picked hehe<br>  <br>  Rule changes Mikan made:<br>  <br>  Mikan became so dominant that the NBA had to change its rules of play in order to reduce his influence such as widening the lane from six to twelve feet ("The Mikan Rule"). He also played a role in the introduction of the shot clock, and in the NCAA his dominating play around the basket led to the outlawing of defensive goaltending. Mikan set the stage for the Modern Age of the NBA dominated by tall, powerful players.<br>  <br>  "As an official, Mikan is also directly responsible for the ABA three-point line, which was later adapted by the NBA, the multi-colored ABA ball, which still lives on as the "money ball" in the NBA All-Star Three Point Shootout, and the existence of the Minnesota Timberwolves."|`|UciBM0Vkaa	george mikan cause he was unstoppable...until they made that rule he also was the reason they made the paint bigger, 3 in the key,and the defensive 3 seconds rules|`|mBQXDYmsaa	i think it was because the year before all the bad teams would just dribble out the game clock so they'd have a better chance of winning. and it led to low scores and the games weren't very exciting to watch.|`|fPMmN2p5aa	Danny Biasone, the owner of the National Basketball Association's Syracuse Nationals, experimented using a 24-second version during a scrimmage game. Biasone came up with 24 seconds by dividing 2,880 (the number of seconds in a game) by 120 (the average number of shots in a game at that time). He then convinced the NBA to adopt it. His team went on to win the 1955 championship.<br>  <br>  For more check out the link below...|`|783285a2545343ba9e80dd2f8d516c67aa	Way back when, whenever a team was leading they would stall. For the entire game. ( I believe there was once a regulation professional match which ended 5-4) This, as you can imagine, was pretty boring for the fans and pretty unfair to the losing team. Thus the shot clock was born - introducing a much faster, exciting style of play, and saving basketball.|`|8qMeo9GSaa	Howard Hobson,who coached the University of Oregon in the 50's,is credited for it.It was first used in Syracuse,New York, when Danny Biasone(owner of the Syracuse Nationals NBA Team.) divided 2,880(total seconds in a game.) by 120(In the 50's,120 shots per game was the average.)and came up with 24 seconds.It was made to speed up the game and produce higher scoring games too.Then the NBA adopted it and the Nationals went on to win the championship that year(1955.)

pQiAv0phaa	get the Cutters linebacker gloves or the Under Armour demolition gloves. They're both quality brands. Never get Nike they rip and lose grip in a couple weeks. Under Armour and Cutters are the top brands. Under Armour and Cutters should last you a whole football season or two.|`|YaNHKSyjaa	yeah go to nikegridiron.com or something but i get my skill position gloves at sports chalet but they also have linemen gloves. anyways get the Nike ones.|`|2bf7f125d731a10ee2971fa95c9e26e7aa	dude its all about comfort n wut works for u.....i was a linebacker n i didnt wear gloves just because it was uncomfortable to me to play in them...so its all about comfort|`|EXuFLpakaa	Hey man, the best gloves in terms of grip are Cutters.  They also have padded gloves too.<br>  <br>  www.cutters.com|`|R4bObyFkaa	yes you should try them. Try under armour|`|mXTcrVmTaa	To answer your first question, I would say get gloves if you think they're comfortable and they help your performance on the field.  A good brand of gloves in my opinion are Nike or Under Armour.  Now for what type of gloves, it all depends.  If you do get the lineman ones, they will offer padding which helps for the tackling and stripping the ball.  The only problem is they will most likely make it even harder to catch the football.  So...if you bought the receiver gloves, that would help your catching and ball handling.<br>  If you want my honest opinion I would say don't get gloves, it may boost key attributes, but also may have a negative effect on some other key attributes to a week side linebacker.  Another thing you can maybe try is taping your fingers, it may help and it makes you look tougher in my opinion.  That way you might intimidate a back coming around the outside, and that's when you put the hurt on em'.  That's the greatest thing in the world in my opinion.  Watching a linebacker crush a back at the line of scrimmage.  The only thing better than watching a defensive player crush the running back at the line of scrimmage is BEING the player crushing the running back at the line of scrimmage.|`|v09oVo7Aaa	no cause everyone have great hands you need to work at it gloves r will gurls i know everyone wear them to shop to they care more about what they wear then play football

6GCwNLk4aa	what the ***?|`|tI53w21saa	Because the NFL itself has contracts with the national networks.  The NFL tells the networks which games they will show in which markets.  That's part of what they are always refer to as revenue sharing.  It works because there is national interest in the whole league. In Baseball, teams negotiate their TV contracts individually with their local markets or cable. Its mainly because there are only 3-4 teams that could get a national audience, and those 3-4 teams don't want to share with the small markets. Fox has a national contract for saturday afternoons and their ratings are horrible. There just isn't very much interest in baseball anymore outside of NY, Boston, and Chicago.|`|afee0e29771cb18093e76307e67462e8aa	Think about it.  Football is only 16 games a year for each team.  Baseball is 162 for each team.  Its tough to nationally televise that many games, especially on weeknights when primetime shows like Heroes, LOST, CSI and ER are on the air.|`|DibFrwxlaa	Because no broadcast network is going to show all 162 games.  <br>  <br>  Go to your local sports bar to see the games for free.|`|MT9vBy3Baa	Please note if you saw the signs in the ball parks during the playoffs, coming in January will be a network for strictly Major League Baseball but that would be on your local cable or satellite provider. Also why not get MLB Extra Innings from your local cable provider or Directv because for the cost of the entire season [$140 approximately this past year] you get to see so much baseball it isn't funny

vRmsvSb6aa	It does look that way. There are a lot less rays band-wagoner's in here today. I like it. The Rays had their best chance to win a game last night, and the couldn't do it. |`|MT9vBy3Baa	Boston does have a history of choking [Bill Buckner from 1986] so until Tampa gets eliminated, don't count out the Rays. Also how is this for a Rays-Phillies World Series.

Not that many teams have every come back from an 0 - 2 and Phillies are hitting all over the Dodgers pitching.  The Dodgers hitting is doing nothing that should be done, so I think that you have the Phillies correct for the World Series. Now, for the Red Sox, don't count out the Rays, they can come back easily.  Rays had a bad game, but they can always make a comeback.  The only problem is that they lost at home, which means that they would have to win at Fenway which is hard for any team.  So the Red Sox and Rays game could go any way, so you could definitely be right.|`|NXwI7ucDaa	Congrats! Although I would rather see boston and LA.

S51x5vK3aa	Das ist schwierig zu sagen. Denn es gibt Rugby League und die Rugby Union. Ein Schisma vor 90 Jahren hat das ergeben. Es gibt also zwei Arten von Rugby mit kleineren Unterschieden. Wenn man aber von Rugby spricht, meint man meist die Rugby Union (momentan sind die Weltmeisterschaften in Frankreich, echt spannend! siehe <a href="http://www.rugbyworldcup.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.rugbyworldcup.com</a> ). Die erfolgreichsten Mannschaften aus der südlichen Hemisph?re spielen im "Super 14" (<a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_14" rel="nofollow">http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_14</a> ) und jene Europas im Heineken Cup (<a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heineken_Cup" rel="nofollow">http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heineken_Cu...</a> ). Der Sieger des Heineken Cups "London Wasps" und der Finalist "Leicester Tigers" sind erw?hnenswert, aber die europ?ischen Teams spielen nicht auf dem Niveau südlicher. Daraus kann man schlie?en, dass die weltweit besten Mannschaften momentan die "Bulls" und "Sharks" (beide Südafrika) sind.|`|m2fzyAKgaa	Indien/Sri Lanka.<br>  Manchmal auch Australien...<br>  <br>  Gru? choclate.|`|WUy0QvmPaa	*lach* das ist genauso leicht zu beantworten wie es die frage: was ist die erfolgreichste fussball- liga mannschaft weltweit! <br>  wie schinderhannes ja schon anfuehrte, gibt es zwei "grosse" ligen, wobei ja das 15er rugby erst in den letzten jahren professionell wurde (in einigen laendern) <br>  was ich ja normal nicht mache, ich verweise mal auf wikipedia, denn da kann man sich mal gut einlesen.. aber die frage, wie du sie gestellt hast, wird dir wohl nicht beantwortet werden koennen..<br>  <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_Union" rel="nofollow">http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_Union</a> (weiter unten bei den laenderfahnen gibt es auch statistiken.. also sowas aehnliches.. aber vergleichende gibt es wohl bis jetzt nicht..)<br>  <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby" rel="nofollow">http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby</a><br>  <br>  nachtrag: ich frag mich ja, wer hier die daumen runter verteilt... *aetz* mal weniger bewerten und selber antworten!!

YZpSZZVAaa	I think Boller is an underrated QB, but he won't see much playing time this year unless McNair gets injured.  Generally speaking, McNair received praise for his play with the Ravens last year and was seen as a great fit for the team and its style of play on offense.  Boller will most likely watch from the bench barring an injury of a poor start to the season.<br>  <br>  Have you been to RootZoo yet?

You'll also win free prizes for earning the same types of points you earn here. Check it out and set up a free screenname there, you'll love it.|`|AA11457592	Boller is an ok quarterback, but Steve Macnair is just AWESOME!!|`|LIK2Ekmbaa	Kyle Boller will be a backup for the rest of his career, but who ever he backs up, he should do decent job. His experience helps, but he is defiantly not better than steve mcnair|`|i0qMg47Caa	why would u want boller to start over mcnair? mcnair did good last year and when he decides to retire troy smith will try to take his place|`|z5ayJQfBaa	Oh, most definitely, Boller is not given his due. For me, he's like David Carr. A average to good quarterback that had the misfortune to be on a team that just couldn't seem to get itself together. Remember, the Ravens only really started kicking it up when the Billick  took over calling the plays. I think we could all agree that the offense never really had much clicking until then... And, jeez, with the wideouts they had for Boller, it's no surprise he couldn't do better. McNair also had some crazy chemistry with Mason, which helped him.|`|zVyWLaU9aa	You're not serious are you?  You think Kyle Boller... the man that the Ravens openly admit is a bust... will start over Steve McNair?  I hate to break it to ya babe but the only way Boller is starting over McNair is if Steve gets seriously injured in some way shape or form and can't play for the rest of the season.|`|b3d5e01b61690541f093b9b7eaaacaf8aa	As long as the team believes in McNair and he gets the job done, I don't see where Boller will have much playing time. The team is commited to McNair, and they aren't making much of a secret out of that. <br>  <br>  I think as long as McNair is healthy and productive, Kyle Boller is going to be backing him up. Boller did well in the two games he played against Cleveland and Carolina, but that doesn't seem to put in favor over McNair. <br>  <br>  As for ticket sales, pay attention to the Ravens website, and the Baltimore sun. Secondly, Ravens regular season tickets usually sell out in about 15 minutes. And I would venture to say that tickets for the Colts and the Steelers will probably sell out in about 30 seconds . Ok, maybe 30 seconds is a little extreme but your looking at the matchups that everyone else wants, think it about it. What games do you think are likely to sell out first?<br>  <br>  It seems to me that your best bet is to work any connection of Ravens fans you have amongst family, friends or co-workers to see who has tickets that can't go. Otherwise I say you'll be paying through the roof to get tickets online from brokers an individuals selling their tickets online in a bidding war.

NVgTo4L6aa	That's soooo sad, i am glad he wasn't upset andy,  that could of shattered a little kids dreams,  the players  are all excited about winning the grand final i guess.<br>  <br>  It's good he got to meet Dipper, he's a legend.|`|elB3EeDWaa	yeah, we should have expected that though, he climbed up on that dias like he was a bloody rock star or something.  wouldn't expect anything less from buddy.  also, bateman didn't even give the little kid who was up there when he went up his cap, he kept it himself.  all class.|`|oSw7VxWvaa	I thought buddy had a broken thumb or something right? Maybe he was feeling the pain and thought better of it. <br>  Still a good moment to remember for your nephew though, he was the one to hand the medal to Buddy in history forever.<br>  <br>  stop whinging|`|lzVF1diNaa	yeah i saw that.<br>  i know buddy was prob excited about winning and kinda forgot about the kid but hey i bet shane crawford was excited too and he still remembered to give the kid a hug. <br>  |`|c3tc7Evfaa	yea i saw that<br>  did you see one of the hawthorn guys thaught the hat was for him to keep and didn't give it to the kid<br>  he was about to cry you could tell you should of seen his face|`|nHyV2mnhaa	No one believes you.  Buddy feels like he can conquer the world at the moment, he was still in shock and not really thinking about the kid.  He still gave him a tap on the arms.|`|Kw1qPPjoaa	Aww, I didn't see it, it's good that your nephew didn't get upset though!|`|hshNAN4waa	I remember mark williams not giving his hat to the kid. What a dick!|`|c9F1SDmEaa	Yeah i saw it,but as RFC said they get caught up in all the excitment of winning a grand Final and the kids are the last things on their minds,you think they might have learnt what they are meant to do to the kids after West Coast's debarcle a few years back..<br>  But still i think there is no excuse for forgetting to shake a little kids hand though..<br>  A few players even got down on bended knees and gave the kids a cuddle..<br>  I hope the little fella was'nt too upset Andy.But at least he is 1 kid who will never forget the 2008 Grand Final(i see he did get his wish to present to Buddy too)..:-)|`|m56yVg2Haa	Yes, I think I saw a couple that didn't respond to the little kids as well as they might, but give them a break, probably the biggest event in their (the players) lives. Imagine the fatigue, and having to stoop so far. A very minor distraction really, and a nice touch by the usually heavy handed AFL. Stop whingeing Andy, you won the flag. You're just  bl00dy stirring.|`|MVdEciHwaa	so 2 years ago i cant remember many eagles players shaking the kids hands mabey its the over rated garbage players that dont shake peoples hands|`|bEB1kGYnaa	EMOTION AND EXCITEMENT GOT THE BETTER OF SOME PLAYERS!!!!|`|NNSuugEmaa	Omg you had a kid. <br>  *run run run*|`|KYaM65gzaa	I believe you I def noticed he didnt shake and also noticed Mark Wiliams didnt give the kid the hat ut they were likely just caught up in hte moment and forgot well the hat one probably just forgot theyre focusing on getting the medal not on giving away hats|`|2s244jGgaa	awww, that was your nephew, congratulations!<br>  <br>  I noticed that, he pat him on the shoulder which was alright in a way - but i think he got too caught up in the moment which does happen a fair bit.|`|265fd4cbb93fdd2558477d6a36b37857aa	I saw the pat on the shoulder which I still took as a show of affection for the kid. My friends nephew also presented a medal which is a gr8 opportunity for kids to get a taste of grandfinal day but I do think that its the players moment and I dont think that its fair for people to have a go at them for forgetting proceedure when this is what they play for all their career. <br>  <br>  As I understand, Mark Williams corrected his mistake after the presentation and at least Buddy acknowledged your nephew. The West Coast players didnt do so well a couple of years ago either and it was sad to see on tv, but then like I said, its their moment and who can blame them for being caught up in their ultimate achievement?<br>  <br>  Footy players are not perfect people all of the time and are human just like anyone else|`|4wRyTY9Raa	Never seen that, but that is the exact reason why the kids shouldn't present medals after the game, some get a handshake, some might miss out.<br>  Let them provide a guard of honor at half time or something,  players have just achieved something they have dreamed of their entire life, some players just get carried away with the moment, who can blame them.<br>  |`|xmg9CBnCaa	yeah i remember. i dont think he woulda reallly cared though, i mean, even just a pat on the back would be great if i were a kid|`|7Ek9YkUhaa	And your complaining that he only got a pat on the shoulder!! Do you know how many young kids would kill to be in your nephews position, meeting lance "buddy" franklin eligibly one of the best players of all time and give him a premiership medallion on footballs biggest stage!<br>  <br>  <br>  FREO DOCKERS - you have got to be the most one-eyed fan i have ever come across, your calling Buddy Franklin and the Eagles team over rated garbage. If Eagles are were over rated and won a flag what does that make fremantle - one of the only AFL clubs never to win a premiership let alone play in a grand final!! And Buddy wouldn't have become the 28th man in VFL/AFL history to bag 100 goals in a season!<br>  <br>  About '06 they were caught up in the moment, for most of them they just won their first premiership. And also the ones that didn't shake the kids hands offered by putting their hand out at the start - what your meant to do - but the kids didn't offer until after they gave out the medal! Anyway one person who didn't shake the child hand was Micheal Braun, after wards he felt bad so he brought the kid merchandise and went to visit him in country W.A, and another David Wirrapunda also took another little boy out for dinner - his shout! - now that's dedication!!!<br>  <br>  Leave your opinion when your teams half as good as mine!
265fd4cbb93fdd2558477d6a36b37857aa	I totally agree Andy! I saw at least 3 free kicks to the Cats that resulted in goals that brought them back into the game, and those free kicks were soft and decisions didnt go the way of the Hawks when the same scenario occured against them!<br>  <br>  Edit; I noticed the so called 50m penalty that Laurie is talking about and it looked more like 100m to me!<br>  <br>  Another thing I have noticed this year is the number of one sided frees early in games, and that the opposing team only starts to be awarded frees once the score is at a point of no return!|`|4wRyTY9Raa	Mate, come on,  the majority of free kicks paid were there, i saw two throws within 15 seconds that should of been geelong frees but were called play on, the result, a goal to the hawks,  if you have blokes putting arms around opponents as the ball is kicked into the forward line they are going to be free kicked, simple as that.<br>  <br>  Enjoy your win, don't come across as a bad winner, which you sound like in this question, be happy you won the grand final, we could all get on here posting how hawthorn repeatedly ran the ball through for a behind and geelong missed so many easy goals but that would be taking the gloss off the hawks, just be happy mate.|`|xmg9CBnCaa	i thought the umpiring was great. no concerns whatsoever in the umpiring. i think u were just extremely emotional that day and everything that happened was magnified by like 100000 times|`|W8SgRKo7aa	i found the umpiring pathetic it was a disgrace to see in a great game of footy|`|m56yVg2Haa	Don't often agree with your biased comments Andy, but you're spot on with this one. Definitely Geelong were favoured, and so many resulted in goals. Bad decisions for sure. Perhaps our AFL umpiring correspondent can explain the free down the field after Ablett nearly lost his head after handballing. A free right there is OK. What actually happened is that the guy who received the hand pass then (after Ablett was infringed) kicked downfield, and a free kick was given to Geelong 10 yards from goal. Not a 50 metre penalty, for McLaren ran from the centre to the edge of the goal square.<br>  <br>  Lozz you're also right, payback time when the game was already won by Hawthorn. Bl00dy weak umpiring, and indecisive, all favouring Geelong. Bring back one central umpire.|`|6ewXJx4oaa	The Cats are very much ball players which tends to win more free kicks.  The Hawks on the other hand play a hard game which includes doing things outside the letter of the law.  Consequently they tend to give more free kicks away.  <br>  <br>  I don't think the umpiring was up to scratch in the GF but I also don't think it was biased.  To me the biggest puzzle was how the hell did Sam Mitchell manage to not get reported several times?  He is one, lucky SOB.|`|Kw1qPPjoaa	I agree with you, the umpiring was shocking, there were so many soft free kicks!<br>  <br>  But I did notice that the umpires tries to balance the free kick count towards the end of the game, and that why the free kicks were:<br>  Geelong - 29<br>  Hawthorn - 21<br>  <br>  You should see the free kick count for the whole year - It is evident which teams are favoured!|`|NBxsXhYkaa	lol, yeah. The umps got geelong a win in round 17, but the hawks were just too good for both the umps and the cats in the big one.|`|monjTmzUaa	i guess taking abletts head off several times & not receiving frees is legit.<br>  <br>  sore winner....<br>  <br>  cats r styill the best team having won the minor prem by a mile.<br>  hawks will be smashed next yr. cats wont take prisoners...<br>  <br>  |`|oSw7VxWvaa	Scott Mclaren should be stabbed/shot for his bias against hawthorn in the finals series|`|5H9nEpiyaa	Were we watching the same final????? I don't think the umps were bias towards the cats..... quite a few of the hawks mishaps against Geelong went unrewarded...... |`|KYaM65gzaa	I agree.....with the previous two posts. Hawthorn were the better team but they were also thugs. Geelong for me next year too|`|2s244jGgaa	It was  SO ONE SIDED.<br>  <br>  My uncle (whom i was watching the game with) was getting really angry & started using really bad language, because it was shocking. Did you know that at the end the umpires started giving away lots of frees to the hawks to even up the free kick count because it was highly in geelongs favour. At the start of the 4th quater the free kicks were 14 - 28. SHOCKING.<br>  <br>  I couldnt belive it, i spotted about 7 occasions where the cats held the ball and nothing happend. It got me so angry - BRETT ROSEBURY BEST WA UMPIRE EVER, SHOULD HAVE UMPIRED!

We had Damon's long hair, Manny's dreads, Youk's wicked sweet beard.. some teams aren't allowed to have facial hair (cough cough Yankees). We do! I don't think the actual team is going to all just change their hair. It's a cool idea but it's also kinda.. I dunno, it's what high school teams do at my school.<br>  <br>  I read an article about a Ray's 12 year old fan wearing a mo hawk to school, and getting suspended for it. The boy refuses to cut his hair. I thought that was a pretty cool story.|`|33f4c852804fa42db9a7cbb912480080aa	Hmmm...How about they shave the championship trophy onto their heads...|`|rLDB7ZwJaa	Yes, a reverse mohawk that runs from ear to ear.  Rather than the mohawk that runs from the front of the head to the back of the neck.  |`|PaMTtUXbaa	more bandwagon fans like yourself
Ps0e8926aa	Non credo c'entri molto il fatto della "vittoria azzurra". Io vedo più il numero di squadre partecipanti come un incentivo, per le nazione meno "rugbystiche" ad avere un palcoscenico di rilievo. Questo porta a far conoscere questo sport, che è ammalato da sempre dalla mancanza di popolarità nelle nazioni con meno tradizione. Una vittoria(esempio) del Portogallo sulla Scozia porterebbe molti Portoghesi ad avvicinarsi al mondo della palla ovale. Ipotesi remota, d'accordo, ma la visibilità rimane, e con essa la possibilità di far ingrandire la grande famiglia del rugby...|`|AiHlyR8raa	Io penso che le squadre chiamate da te cuscinetto debbano avere occasione di crescere se non gli dai modo digiocare con le grandi non hanno possibilità di migliorare. Perciò benvengano. Fino a 6 o 7 anni fa anche l'Italia era una squadra cuscinetto. Solo iniziando il 6 nazione abbiamo fatto passi da gigante.|`|9trNRru2aa	Se si chiamano modniali devono partecipare tutte le nazioni che hanno una squadra!!!Non stiamo mica dicendo di far entrare la romania nel6Nazioni!!!|`|57XuraETaa	Secondo me sono davvero troppe 20 squadre per i mondiali di Rugby. In questo sport c'è una differenza abissale tra i top team e le più deboli. La formula andrebbe rivista.

Et je vais faire un petit pamphlet en l'honneur de mon club, pour le défendre des agressions non justifiées.<br>  <br>  A tous ceux qui disent "club de mercenaires sans ame", "les gros sous tuent le sport et Toulon", je vais juste faire remarquer que le Stade Fran?ais, s'il en est là, c'est grace à <br>  qui, et comment ? Ouais, je me souviens d'un Guazzini qui a sorti son chéquier pour faire venir des joueurs et remonter ce "petit club" champion de Top 14 cette année. <br>  De plus, les joueurs qui viennent ont été motivés par le challenge et l'aura de Tana Umaga, ils viennent certes pour des sous, mais aussi et surtout pour relever ce challenge. Parce que, si c'était pour les sous, certains auraient pu signer ailleurs, dans un club mieux classé.<br>  Allez, je vais répondre un peu individuellement: <br>  <br>  Despro_99> Des mercenaires? Des sportifs qui relèvent un challenge en échange de gros sous? Alors, tous les sportifs sont des mercenaires ! Ne t'inquiète pas, les joueurs, bien qu'étrangers, ont très bien compris ce qu'était le Brin de Muguet, je ne m'en fais pas du tout. Tana a compris ce que c'était, a déclaré avoir vécu une expérience extra à Toulon, et il l'a très certainement transmise à tous ces joueurs. Quant à l'ame de Toulon, il suffit de voir que le public répond toujours (encore plus, même) aussi présent, pour se dire qu'elle n'est pas morte. Viens à Toulon, personne ne voit d'un mauvais oeil ce recrutement.<br>  <br>  Allblacks> Là où tu te trompes, c'est que la plupart des recrues ont signé pour 2 ans (avec possibilité de reconduire). Donc l'année prochaine, elles seront encore là. Après tu parles d'argent pas propre, permets moi d'en douter. Boudjellal  est un homme intègre, riche, et il hésite pas à injecter pour remercier cette ville qui lui a offert sa richesse, sa vie. C'est tout. Quand on brasse des millions comme lui (une des plus grandes maisons d'édition de France, et il en est actionnaire largement majoritaire), on a pas besoin de tricher sur l'argent.<br>  <br>  Karlym> Tu te trompes. Contrairement aux idées re?ues, il y a beaucoup de jeunes dans l'équipe toulonnaise, il y a beaucoup d'espoirs qui ont décroché leur contrat pro (d'ailleurs certains jouaient déjà cette année, comme Marc Andreu, très prometteur, ou Olivier Grimaud, qui a juste été "Oscar du Midi Olympique" du mois de Février...alors bon), comme Bastères, Agnesi, Feldis, Mérabet, Maestri, Vervoort, Béal, Sourice, Giacobazzi, Chouquet, Serviens, Zagar, Andreu et Grimaud. 14 jeunes Fran?ais, presque 1 par poste ! Alors qu'on ne vienne pas me parler d'une  équipe de vieux trentenaires croulants. Cette remarque vaut aussi pour "Topoftheline". 14 jeunes Fran?ais dans l'effectif, plus les autres (Rué, Alazet, Banquet, Douy...), c'est clair que ?a a une gueule de Pacifique uniquement...<br>  <br>  Cheyenne66> Cet esprit n'existe plus au RCT? Tu les as vu jouer, récemment? Tu suis un peu l'actualité ? Tana, qui est venu jouer pour très cher, il a complètement assimilé l'esprit toulonnais... il a joué, avec les autres, il a sauvé, tout ?a pour le Brin de Muguet... que faire de plus ? Boudjellal, assassin de la culture rugbystique de Toulon? Au contraire, il l'a déterrée... suffit de voir le nombre d'abonnements (10000, 1er club fran?ais, tous confondus, au nombre d'abonnés).<br>  <br>  Les jeunes du RCT ont une chance énorme : non seulement ils ont pu signer un contrat pro alors que de gros joueurs arrivaient, mais en plus ils suivent exactement la même formation, le même entra?nement qu'eux, coaché par Mr. Umaga en personne. Ils ont les moyens de se forger un rugby solide et surtout varié, aux c?tés de stars et d'excellents joueurs. C'est la meilleure opportunité qu'on pouvait leur offrir.<br>  <br>  Toulon sera toujours Toulon, avec son centre de formation exceptionnel (regardez les résultats des Reischels et des Espoirs, si vous doutez), son ambiance magique, son enceinte résonnant au son du Pilou-Pilou... combien de grands joueurs viennent de Toulon (Dominici, Mignoni pour ne citer qu'eux)? Autant en sortiront dans l'avenir...beaucoup de nos jeunes tra?nent déjà à Marcoussis...|`|0f15fe026a6063b64c5282ff2b98f066aa	Ils ont l'air tous motivés pour faire du bon boulot, et les entra?nements ont l'air sérieux et rigoureux. Avec Tana, on ne peut que gagner.<br>  On va y arriver !!!|`|2a1oJIntaa	C'est pas parce qu'on a été un des meilleurs joueurs au monde qu'on est un bon entraineur ou manager, d'ailleurs il est manager et non pas entraineur car il a pas les diplomes requis pour etre entraineur d'un club en France.<br>  Laissons faire les choses, et surtout esperons que la bande de trentenaire tiendra les matches jusqu'au bout ainsi que la saison, car le principal défaut de l'équipe c'est l'age des joueurs, ils pourraient quasiment tous jouer en vétéran.|`|4fc87ad62df5d3ffd815d3da7539cb67aa	J'y crois à fond aussi! Aller Toulon!|`|A5Tdvs1paa	Je vous le souhaite de tout coeur. J'ai joué à Mayol, il y a dejà bien longtemps  ( nous étions juniors alors..) les équipes premières jouaient après nous. Quel enthousiasme dans ce stade pour supporter les équipes des rouge et noir tant des juniors que des seniors. Je m'en souviens encore avec ferveur J'espère que vous allez continuer cette tradition et continuer à pousser avec  votre équipe même s'il y a beaucoup d'étrangers maintenant, mais c'est aussi le cas de beaucoup d'équipes fran?aises|`|FrvKkztzaa	Les efforts au niveau du recrutement de cette année ont pour objectif la montée en TOP 14, mais aussi de redonner une impulsion à l'école de rugby qui forme les joueurs de demain. L'école de rugby du RCT compte parmi les meilleures et a formé bon nombre d'internationaux. Si les toulonnais qui ont été aspirés par les autres clubs du TOP 14 à gros budget jouaient à Toulon le RCT serait imbattable. <br>  Vive le RCT et le PILOU PILOU et tant pis pour les esprits chagrins.|`|RlDwWuH6aa	RC Toulon un des plus gros budget de France, une équipe de emrcenaire un entraineur mercenaire, mon dieu on dirait du foot, toulon a vendu son ames, qu'ils aillent en enfer|`|e3cfa3212b3f1e22526595c4b899ca5baa	LE RCT pourrait changer de nom et s'appelet le RCP Racing Club Pacifique. Mais ils ont une équipe taillé pour jouer les devants de la scène attention quand même rien n'est joué. Et il y a deja eu des équipes belles sur le papier mais moins belle en vrai|`|f4c5a06c19216c969fe107cca15443b0aa	Je suis un amoureux du rugby en général, et du RCT en particulier: j'ai joué (et gagné) à Mayol quand j'étais jeune, et franchement ce stade est à part;  pour jouer là-bas, faut les avoir bien accrochées. La fierté et les vertus "hormonales" des Toulonnais ne sont plus à démontrer.<br>  <br>  C'et pour ?a que je suis d'autant plus dé?u quand je vois cette équipe devenir une vitrine marketing à l'instar des "galactiques" du Real Madrid, et perdre son ame. De plus, ce qui a été un fiasco au foot, sport du vedettariat par excellence, ne peut pas marcher au rugby. <br>  <br>  Si tu veux gagner au rugby, faut être prêt à te faire mal pour les copains, faut l'amour du maillot.  Cet état d'esprit a toujours existé au RCT, mais plus maintenant. La faute M. Bourrougne-Jellal, le "président " du RCT. <br>  <br>  Très bon en marketing cet homme, très bon businessman. Mais assassin de la culture rugbystique Toulonnaise.
k3vMjwJYaa	One thing that you can do either at home or in the gym are one-leg calf raises. Using a stair and having something nearby to hold on to for balance, raise your entire body with the calf muscles of one leg (always good practice to do your weak leg first then match the number of reps with your strong leg as to not make the imbalance worse).|`|wlHuwyDAaa	get into the habit of walking around home or other places on the tiptoes of your right foot.

UEDavzPIaa	First of all I do agree to hold on to LJ he's bound to put up huge numbers.  The more he puts it off is just the more compressed his stats will be later.  He will have monster weeks for you so if you can hold off I would.<br>  <br>  Second I would go with Hasselbeck he is playing with the guys he always does give Griese a week to figure things out.<br>  <br>  Now back To your first question I would bench Watson guy like he never existed.  Didn't anyone see New England hold LT to 43 yards on 18 carries in week 2??  Yeah, Now try to tell me your considering this Watson guy again.  By the way I just read the yahoo news on Jacobs and the latest is that he is unlikely to play.  Go with LJ and Ward.|`|UoT86gbiaa	RB: Brandon Jacobs is due back this week, meaning Ward hits the pine indefinitely.  Watson it is.<br>  <br>  QB: Griese isn't half the player Hasslebeck is.  This is a no-brainer.<br>  <br>  Trade: At this point - about 16 hours before games begin - hold off until next week.  If LJ continues to struggle this week and you can get this deal, go for it then.<br>  For the record, I think LJ will be a monster during fantasy playoff time, so if you can keep him and squeak into your league's postseason, he'll be a major asset then.

Doing things over and over again will help build muscle memory and allow you to do things more consistently.<br>  <br>  Also, practice with friends and play 2-on-2, 5-on-5, whatever.  Maybe put some kind of punishment on the line (pushups, running laps, doing something embarassing) to simulate pressure.  <br>  <br>  There are drills where you practice shooting when someone is trying to block your shot.  These kinds of drills can help you concentrate and get used to playing in those kinds of situations.|`|OiC501ibaa	oh men.. getting the nervous feeling in every game cannot be taken away in just days.. it takes alot of time to get used to it and be able to handle the pressure that it gives you.. just be cool in the tryouts, dont worry about the other players, just play your game and never fail to get them impressed. if you messed up, just think its not the end for you, you can still improve.|`|nvx8RoQMaa	the only things you should be thinking about are<br>  <br>  who i am guarding's weaknesses and how i am going to force them into their weaknesses<br>  my advantages on my opponent (size, quickness etc.)<br>  how my defender is playing me(close=drive, space=shoot)<br>  not giving up no matter what and giving 100%, not 99%<br>  <br>  this seems simple but these are the only things that you should be thinking about.  don't think about anything else and you'll be fine.  don't even try to not think about something b/c when you think about not thinking about it you are thinking about it(if that makes sense @ all)|`|pQRvscYgaa	I know how you feel, ive been there.  When you're on the floor, don't worry about mistakes, one missed shot won't get you cut from the team.  What always made me feel better about how I did was hustle.  As long as youre hustling as hard as you can, its kinda hard to get nervous.  I always feel more confidant after getting a couple of baskets off of offensive rebounds (which are hustle points).  Besides that, coaches love to see hustle.  Good luck in tryouts.

They are one of the best teams and the way your batting order is I think you should switch Soto and Fotenot. Soto's an awesome hitter so I think he should be in the 7th spot. Jeff should be a relief pitcher, not a closer. He should be pitching in the 6th or 7th inning|`|7j75DhQQaa	Nice team on paper. But so do the Mariners if you write Ichiro's name nine times.|`|G4wGCghdaa	Where is all the money coming from? <br>  First off Lilly is signed for 2 more years at about 10 Million per year and Marquis is signed for next year at around 7-8 Million I think.<br>  Next If you add in the contract that Sabathia is going to ask for, and the Money that Abreu would command even through he will turn 35 before the start of next season. Not to mention that Abreu has only hit a home run every 35 at bats the last 3 seasons which is just slightly less than Mark DeRosa's 34. <br>  <br>  The Cubs aren't going to just dump 28+ Million dollars in the salaries of Lilly and Marquis. Then go out and spend another 20-30 MILLION on Sabathia and Abreu.<br>  <br>  This is the Chicago market not the New York Boston market.<br>  <br>  I don't think Lilly is going anywhere after posting a 17-9 record. C.C. as good as he was this year only went 17-10.<br>  But it would still be great to have him on the Cubs staff.<br>  <br>  But I wouldn't hold my breath.|`|V8JXAYvHaa	remember, the cubs aren't made of money. also, how do the yankees pay their players, staff, and stadium?|`|UI04rrWVaa	I believe Kosuke is RF|`|NK5O1Ielaa	There's no way in HELL that the Cubs are getting CC.|`|kGjk15CPaa	No they will have 101 Years without winning a world series by the end of 09'

SIKuOevVaa	No.  In fact, there have been NFL games in October that got moved because baseball teams sharing their stadium were in the Playoffs on the same day:<br>  <br>  1969: Atlanta Braves win NL West, Falcons have to leave Fulton County Stadium and go across town to Georgia Tech's Grant Field.  Minnesota Twins win AL West, Vikings have to go from Metropolitan Stadium in Bloomington to the University of Minnesota's Memorial Stadium in Minneapolis.<br>  <br>  1973: Oakland Atheletics win AL West, Raiders have to leave Oakland Coliseum and play at University of California's Memorial Stadium in Berkeley.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure, but I think the interruption of the 1989 World Series due to the San Francisco earthquake forced the Giants to use Candlestick Park on a day when the 49ers had a home game, sending the Niners down the Peninsula to Palo Alto and Stanford Stadium.  I know the 49ers eventually played three home games at Stanford, but I'm not sure if it was because of the Series being pushed back in addition to the difficulty with fixing Candlestick Park.<br>  <br>  Also, the New York Jets played one 1977 game at Giants Stadium, before moving there full-time in 1984, but the Mets were not in the Playoffs in '77 (in fact they were dead last, though the Yankees won the World Series), so I don't know why they couldn't play at Shea Stadium that day.  (Maybe they ran out of gas masks.)|`|edad267e5e16626b81d6897a20a1ed58aa	Not in the same day...Once, the Minnesota Twins played a game in Sept at night, and they worked all through the night to get the field ready for a Minnesota college football game the next day at 1:00 pm.  <br>  <br>  The baseball game ended on Friday at like 11:00, and they had the field ready for football by 1:00 pm the following day.  |`|GyJqMWdUaa	there was that one time where someone charged the mound against Kyle Farnsworth when he played for the Cubs.  the tackle he put on the hitter was good enough to make me think he could easily suit up next to Urlacher any day.|`|ODogL6A5aa	Nope<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I LOST THE GAME|`|ImHvd8F0aa	Kansas City, 1985, the Chiefs played a day game at Arrowhead Stadium and game seven of the World Series was played at night at Royals Stadium.

For instance, for the 07 they would use the 2006-2007 roster. However, there is usually a option on the newer games where you can connect online and download newer rosters. This is a pretty cool option as the seniors will be drafted and new players will be inserted in the rosters by either #'s or anonymous names.|`|VAHhqdDCaa	they actually use the 07-08 rosters|`|jNmc8HfQaa	They use the 06-07 roster.

7e0c01587b445ba9702d403df3de0521aa	Well.... for 850 dollars, you can have a top of the line AR15. Chambered for 5.56NATO, chromed bore and chamber, 1:7 rifling twist. MangPhos coated under the FSB. Chromed interior bolt carrier and gas key. Mil-Spec receiver extension. Collapsible stock. Flat top upper with a BUIS, so you can add optics later on. Barrel made of 4150 steel, instead of the common 4140. <br>  <br>  It is about 1200 dollars worth of rifle, but if you put it together yourself you can get it for about 850. <br>  <br>  And, since you are putting it together yourself, you can get exactly what you want. You also can spend a little money at a time, so it is not one big cost. <br>  <br>  A lower receiver locally, for about 100 bucks. <br>  A lower parts kit for about 50. <br>  Put on a CMMG upper from AimSurplus for 525 bucks. <br>  Put in a collapsing mil-spec stock from BCM for 100 dollars. <br>  A BUIS for 30 bucks. <br>  The tool you need for 10 bucks. <br>  <br>  Magazines vary in cost, I like PMags at 15 bucks each. You can get military surplus mags for under 10. <br>  <br>  So.... while you are gathering parts, you can raise the extra 250 bucks. It will be worth it in the end, since your rifle will last longer and perform better. <br>  <br>  In addition, it is fun, and you learn a lot about the workings of the rifle, so maintenance is easier.<br>  <br>  If you want details like directions for putting one together, or where to buy parts, send me a message and I'll be glad to offer whatever knowledge I may have.|`|TnaeRXJkaa	Well an AR-15 will stand up against anything. I have a Bushmaster that looks like an M16A2 (BUT it was a M4A1 until i put a fixed stock and a 20" upper on) that after tax costed a little over $1000.00 i think it was around $1188.00 or something like that. But you will need some more money. But you could get an AK for $600.00 and the AK almost never jams it will not jam even if you drop it in mud,sand,dust, rain,snow,and water. Now i have never shot an AK but that is what i hear. But from experience i know that Bushmaster AR-15's are good. But for one of those you will have to spend more. |`|jJ4kf2xkaa	Sounds like you want a survival gun (one for just about anything). I wouldn't get an ar for this purpose. The main problem with an ar (5.56) is that is lacks power. The ar may kill a deer (after several shots)  but for the most part don't see it getting the job done.  All in all the ar is a nice range weapon for putting holes in paper targets but its gas system is what makes it a bad survival weapon. An ak is nice but an sks is the least cheapest for the ticket.Some sks's go for as cheap as $100 and are accurate out to 450m. Sks have the ruggedness and power of an ak without the price. How could you go wrong with this weapon? The only flip side of the weapon is it capacity for ammo (believe it is just 8rds). So for $100 - $150  you could get the rifle for maybe $100 a nice scope, ammo for 1000rds will run just about $150-175. So for about $350-400 you get a weapon, scope and ammo.|`|AA11930628	well, as an all around rifle, i'd say go with something else really. AR's and AK's are nice and the mere name is known and understood. However, if you want something you can use for more all around, i'd suggest going with either a lever action rifle like a Marlin 336 or a compact semi rifle like the Mini-14 or Mini-30. A lever action rifle can be used for home defense, hunting, targets, plinking and its cheaper than the AK and AR. Ammo is also readily available and usually cheaper than .223 and .308. If you want the rounds to be .223 or .308 or even a 6.5, get the mini 14 or the mini 30. Good all around weapons. Not the best at any one thing but rated towards the top on all around.|`|jALkYivbaa	There are AR's that fit your requirement for that amount or a little more, and one can still purchase an AK style rifle for a bit more than half that price. Both style rifles have their very vocal fans who seem to know quite a bit. Most AK's shoot an older style heavier round that is usually less expensive than the ammo for the AR, and some newer AK variants use a round similar to the AR's ammo and those rounds are about one third the price of a .223 or 5.56mm round.<br>  Use the web to check out all the pros and cons of each; an in-depth discussion would run much longer than is allowed here. In considering, take into account the immediate local availability of whichever round you'd need, the future availability of that round and it's long term cost.|`|06Z1LFkQaa	I own two AR-15's (Bushmaster and DPMS) and four AK-47's (two Romanians, one Chinese and one Hungarian) and for all around use, I prefer the AK-47 in 7.62x39 mm myself. I have killed more deer cleanly with that round and wouldn't even consider using a .223 if I had the 7.62 available. I feel the same way when it comes to a firefight. I unlike the military could care less for just injuring any possible assailant. The 7.62 will also penetrate through both doors of a standard automobile and still be lethal whereas the .223 will not. You also cannot find a new and probably not even a used AR-15 for $600, but you can find used AK-47's for as little as $350, leaving you an extra couple of hundred dollars or so for ammo. 7.62x39 mm is the lowest priced military caliber ammo for semi or full autos on the market right now too. It can be had in FMJ, Hollow Point and Soft Point all for around $200 for or less per thousand rounds.|`|o658LD60aa	The AR15 is a great choice. the upper and lower receivers are separate, and only the lower has the serial number, so you can have one AR-15 and have an upper chambered in .223, one in .308 Winchester, one for 6.8SPC, and even one in .22LR for plinking and practice. You can change calibers at the range in a matter of seconds.<br>  <br>  You'll be hard-pressed to find a complete AR-15 for under $600, but you can easily build one for close to that. They are a very simple gun to put together.<br>  <br>   Buy yourself a lower receiver, buttstock and lower parts kit, and visit AR-15.com to learn how easy it is to assemble. Next, buy yourself a complete upper from a good manufacturer like Rock River Arms, you can get a nice mid length A2 style chrome lined upper for around $470. It comes with the bolt and everything. <br>  <br>  If you shop around, you should spend about $140 on the lower, $60 on the buttstock, and around $60 on the parts kit, so you have a complete ready to fire AR-15 for $730, which is more than $600 but you can build it in stages. The big advantage is, you can customize it as you go so you end up with exactly what you want, rather than spending $800 on a complete rifle and having to spend extra money in parts and labor to have stuff like free-float rails installed, when you could've easily done it yourself as part of the build.

I always wonder how they became a fan of the Yankees. But you shouldn't just assume that all people who root for the Yankees or Red Sox and aren't from the Northeast are bandwagon fans. They might have another reason for cheering them on besides the fact they are successful.<br>  <br>  As for me, I was born and raised in New York. Everyone in my family is a Yankee fan. It's just the way I was raised.|`|7j75DhQQaa	Having family in Vermont it's normal for me to be a Red Sox fan, besides my mom was a Brooklyn Dodger fan, so I knew from an early age I would hate the Yankees|`|ARuJLITUaa	Hahaha... I'm sorry, I just laughed when I saw John say that the red sox are "consistently successful."<br>  <br>  Do you not remember 86 of the last 90 years?<br>  <br>  To answer the original question... the fact that they two teams do have such a storied history, and that both receive nationwide media attention (where a team like... the rockies, or brewers, do not) leads people to know the team, players, and management more than smaller market teams.  Plus, many people have friends or family that come from either boston or new york.  I know several people who are fans of a team because their father is from that city, or something similar.<br>  <br>  For me... being born and raised in NY... it was sort of a no-brainer.  The mets aren't really an option.|`|WaaFCtuOaa	Just because a fan likes the Yankees or Red Sox & they don't live in Boston doesn't necessarily mean they are bandwagon fans.  I have been a Yankees fan since 1970 & at the time they weren't doing so great but my friends & I liked them anyway. I live in Alexandria Va, close enough to go see the Orioles in Baltimore & can take the subway to see the Nationals & I do go to see both of them from time to time & always go to Baltimore when they play the Yankees & I always hear from the Orioles fans about why so many people who like the Yankees or even the Red Sox come to Baltimore & watch them play & some say it's not fair but I have nothing against the O's but if they don't start producing a winning team, maybe the Yankees & Red Sox fans won't be in the seats & more O's fans will be going to the games. |`|AA12234713	My Amigo I am from the big apple and my team is the Yankees, yes you are hundred % right why people not from New York like the Yankees or Boston. The answer is easy. Everybody like winners and dislike losers. The best two teams in history are the Yankees and Boston and because they are winners people love them. Besides those fans who may follow teams because they are force in any way or other some or later may find his own team. Check your self.|`|VA1N3aMGaa	Relax....Sure there are lots of bandwagon fans.

Just so happens I'm from Boston. ;)<br>  <br>  Hate to say this but yeah we got a lot of bandwagoner fans so half of these red sox fans probably are from New England, but they weren't fans since '04. Sometimes I wish the Sox would suck again so all the bandwagoners would go back to their caves.<br>  <br>  I WILL say though, that before '04, we had a hell of a lot of die hard fans. Fenway was still packed before we won the championship in '04. Boston is a baseball city. Kids grew up learning about the curse of the Babino (and now the newer generation will learn how we reversed that curse!), and kids grew up having a growing hate for the Yankees. It's a rivalry. Since '04, we've gotten a lot of 'bandwagoner fans', usually being females (I'm a girl. Hope no one takes that too offense, but I don't know 1 single bandwagoner male in my area. It's the girls with the pink sox hats that are the bandwagoners).|`|qn50rmQOaa	I live in CA. I have been a Yankees fan since I was real small, when they were the first pennant l picked out to decorate my room with (I was 4 or 5). I'm not a band-wagoener, I picked them as a child, before I understood their history and legacy. <br>  <br>  Trust me, I hate all the people who come out of no where and say "I'm a Red Sox fan" or "I'm a Yankees fan" and then their only answer as to why they are, is because "They're great" That's not a reason to like them, thats just a way to describe them.<br>  <br>  And by the way, what team should someone in Oregon pick? The Mariners? The A's? Giants perhaps? Are those the only teams Oregon natives can chose? <br>  <br>  What about Hawaiians? They;re pretty close to Japan, so I guess they can only chose Seibu Lions? Hanshin Tigers? The Hiroshima Toyo Carp maybe?|`|zgPr8HQyaa	I like the RedSox and I live in DE, closer to the Phillies and the O's.  <br>  <br>  I root for the Phils and always hope they do well just to bring some joy to the city of Philadelphia where I grew up, but let me explain my RedSox fanhood....<br>  <br>  First of all, I got into them when I went to Univ. of Connecticut, I was basically between New York and Boston, so I had to pick one.  The Yankees consistently try to buy championships by paying free agents to come in and they basically have a LEGO team where they just pay more than anyone else can for blocks, build a team, and hope for the best.  I hate teams that do this.<br>  <br>  Then there's Boston....to begin, the RedSox have a storied, deep history, which I learned about after going to school up there, and their rivalry with the Yankees is probably the best rivalry out there, so it makes it extremely fun when those teams play eachother to be a fan.  I'm a fan because I respect where the franchise has been, what it's done, and how it's done it.  The RedSox have a high payroll, but mostly because they pay to KEEP players, not bring new guys in.  They picked up some superstars before they were superstars, ie Ortiz and Lowell.  They've also built from the ground up, and continue to recruit and develop players better than anyone in baseball.....just look at who they've lost over the years....Johnny Damon, Nomar Garciaparra, Roger Clemens, Bronson Arroyo, Pedro Martinez, Doug Mientkeiwitz, Bill Mueller, Trot Nixon, and now Manny Ramirez.  Aside from Damon and Clemens, all those players were lost between 04-08, yet their back in the playoffs playing championship level baseball BECAUSE OF THE STYLE AND CULTURE OF THE REDSOX.  With the loss of all those players, they've added Dice-K (who, yes they paid for, but from Japan, not another MLB team), Beckett (who is their one huge free agent signing), Papelbon, Pedroia, Ellsbury, Jed Lowrie, and some others that have worked their butts off to get where they are.  It's a culture of winning and being competitive year in and year out no matter what players are in place or what other teams are doing.  It starts from the owner and goes down to the minor leagues.  <br>  <br>  Rooting for the home team is just lame...how bout finding a REAL reason.  Imagine being born in Chicago and HAVING to be a Cubs fan...you're set up to be a depressed individual for life from birth, that's not fair.<br>  <br>  Back to the Phillies...they've had some OK teams, but nothing ever great due to the fact that the owner and management won't go out and do what it takes to win, i.e. bringing in a big name player that can set them over the top, and paying their free agents a ton of money to stay (Ryan Howard had to go to arbitration to get his salary upped).  They don't have a winning culture, and it's depressing.  Yet they still allow beers to be $6/cup, and charge you $10 to park, $70 for a hoody, but they don't spend the money to win!!!  ITS FRUSTRATING.<br>  <br>  The Yankees and RedSox both consistently have a winning culture and always have, which is what makes them so much fun to watch.  Im all about the hometown teams, but if the hometown team has management in place that can't get the job done, being a fan is just depressing (could you imagine living in Detroit and having to be a Detroit Lions fan?)  I'd rather be a fan and spend money on a team that's fun to watch and wins than pay $10 to park and watch my middle-classed team with average players get spanked.<br>  <br>  Oh, and by the way, Fenway has always been a magnificent ballpark which is full of rabid Bostonians night in and night out, and has been for years.  If you want to look at frontrunners, look at the Rays...before this years, I thought Tampa Bay was a small town based on the number of people at their games, now they're selling out???  C'mon, same with the Marlins.<br>  <br>  People hate on RedSox fans because the Sox are consistently successful.|`|kGjk15CPaa	im from Seattle...i used to be a Mariner fan but the GM got rid of every single good player they went from having the Best Record Ever 116-46 to not having a winning season since.<br>  <br>  Im a Sox Fan since 2002.

Then dig a big hole behind the logs.  unless they sneak from behind in which case you can have guards, you're good to go.  For snipers you can do virtually the same thing but have a roof on pillars.  The roof should go about 6 inches to a foot above your head when you are aiming at someone, maybe lower, depending on the cover you want.  Lower will give you the most cover.

hb5xEICZaa	All of the Wideouts and RBs on their schedule will be utterly humbled like some 5th grade sissies|`|8WrHQbi0aa	Have you seen LaRon Landry play? Im an LSU fan and saw every game he played in college. The guy is a monster, and hits harder than a truck. He will make an immediate impact as a rookie. He will demolish several RBs and QBs if they use him on safety blitzes. I am not a skins fan at all, but I will watch some games just to see Landry play again....he is awesome.|`|AA10940370	One.

6b1bf199d9dadda3342dac8a3aab92f5aa	i agree back flips are a little scary.The first thing is you need to trust the person who will be your spotter. Make sure you are comfortable with this person maybe watch her spot a few others  before you.Also in most cases the spotter at first is there to help with rotation and form.Make sure to pay close attention to his or her instructions.In our gym we start with a wedge back flip, the wedge is designed to help with rotation.Never try a back flip without a spotter unless your coach has cleared this for  you.....|`|raXuH9lxaa	i dont know ive never done one ...but one of my friends said her cousin almost cracked his head or somthing i dont know if i belive them|`|tlXFvE2baa	I'd practice on trampolines first it makes it easier or go from high ground to low ground.

d0c2ebZsaa	here is the order I think they are <br>  1 alomar<br>  2 sheffield<br>  3 mcgriff<br>  4 schilling <br>  5 vizquel<br>  The only real Hof is Almoar|`|2wgEsVmsaa	Oh, no doubt at all about Schilling or Roberto Alomar. Vizquel -- um, depends on the mood of the writers. They need to feel romantic, then maybe. Sheffield should go, but, then again, the writers might be in a huff because he doesn't court them. McGriff -- probably not, but Murray made it. Neither was dominate in any way. Both had long careers so they put up big lifetime numbers, so McGriff might make it, but I don't see a sure bet there. GREAT nickname, though.|`|ZguH9N8Haa	I agree with Letschat based on historical HoF votes.  <br>  "1 alomar, 2 sheffield, 3 mcgriff, 4 schilling, 5 vizquel with<br>  The only real Hof is Alomar."  <br>  <br>  Alomar was very good among all hitters, and as a second baseman during his era, there is no one you would select ahead of him.  He also made a tremendous impact on his teams (except with the Mets).  He also was very strong in the clutch.<br>  <br>  I am a big fan of McGriff, Schilling, and Vizquel; but I'd rather have McGwire, Thomas, or Bagwell,  I'd rather have Clemens, Johnson, or Maddux, and I'd rather have Trammel, Rodriguez, or Jeter.  <br>  <br>  Although I'd guess that seven of those nine will make it in very easily, I think that their entry will bar many other very good players from getting in.|`|AA11125043	Schilling and Sheffield are.  McGriff is likely.|`|PDF2NUZKaa	Well, I could tell you who I'd vote for out of your list.<br>  Vizquel - close, but not quite<br>  Schilling - same as Vizquel<br>  McGriff - no<br>  Sheffield - if he has a few more years like this year, yes<br>  Alomar - close, but the spitting thing is what I remember most|`|edad267e5e16626b81d6897a20a1ed58aa	Vizquel -  should be for his glove<br>  Schilling - yes<br>  McGriff - could go either way<br>  Sheffield - yes<br>  Alomar - yes|`|NogDWEvDaa	Vizquel - No<br>  Schilling - Borderline<br>  McGriff - Yes<br>  Sheffield - Yes<br>  Alomar - No|`|Y20tsffoaa	I'd say yes to all of them except maybe Schilling.<br>  <br>  For Vizquel, he is just as good as Ozzie in the field, and hits better.<br>  <br>  Schilling I think is close.  I think if he had maybe 2 or 3 more good years he would be in.  His post season numbers are awesome which will help. Now I see him just missing out.<br>  <br>  A lot will say no to McGriff, but he was a consistant 30hr 100rbi threat for nearly 15 years, and I don't believe he used roids like a lot of other 1B in the late 80s and 90s.<br>  <br>  Sheffield will be a 500 HR guy.  It doesn't mean as much now, but there are still only a handfull of guys to have accomplished this.  He is also a .298 career hitter.  That is very good for a power guy, and will probably drive in over 1700 runs.  At the end of this season he should be around 2550 hits.  At 38, he shows no signs of slowing down and may have a shot at 3000 hits if he can a solid 3 more years.<br>  <br>  Alomar declined fast, but he is one of the best 2B to have played over the past 30 years.  Very good numbers all around for him at 2B.|`|p3V8tu2laa	Vizquel - No<br>  Schilling - Yes<br>  McGriff - No<br>  Sheffield - No<br>  Alomar - No, but probably the closest of all the No's.|`|uRCCJbvtaa	Vizquel - no<br>  Schilling - he still needs to put up some good years, but i would say no if he retired now<br>  McGriff - no, absolutely not<br>  Sheffield - yes<br>  Alomar - no

oX8qIQcYaa	He is currently wrestling in OVW (Ohio Valley Wrestling). OVW is the minor leagues of the WWE. I believe he is the current champion. He got sent down because the pirate character was dry and there was nowhere to go with Paul Burchill, protege of William Regal.<br>  <br>  So for now he is working on a new character and wrestling as one of the WWE's top prospects. So look for Burchill to make a return in the not too distant future.|`|Oghmj1KJaa	Paul who? oh i forgot that idiot that used to be on smackdown. that pirate wanna be. let me tell you something i was not impressed with him one bit. if there were more like him in the company i would just stop watching. he really sucks and you should be glad hes out of the wwe because he was a rating killer|`|hMtwZ0Sjaa	He went out with an injury, but recently returned in WWE's farm league, OVW. He's not a pirate anymore, but is now known as "The Ripper" Paul Burchill. He looks to have gained quite a bit of muscle mass, and based on his gimmick, look, and excellent ring work, I would look to see him back in the WWE soon.|`|qoUQ84praa	he went to ovw and has held the world championship on many occasions...i think he has the championship at the moment actually<br>  hope this helps|`|AA11047704	i think he got released because they had no story line with him becasue william regal didnt want to work with em|`|UfKtvSpJaa	His pirate gimmick was dead, so they shipped him off to ovw, he is currently champ and is fine tuning his skills and new gimmick ready for a return in the near future.|`|1luRrZyqaa	Ovw|`|hwa6g4UUaa	After recovering from the surgery, Burchill returned to the OVW development territory under a heel gimmick more reminiscent of his original WWE appearances. First he was billed as "The Most Dangerous Man in OVW" and later he called himself "The Ripper" Paul Burchill (reminiscent of Jack the Ripper). Burchill became the first British OVW Champion after defeating Chet The Jet for the title on December 15, 2006. On February 17, he lost the title to Cody Runnels at a house show. He won the title back the next night at another house show. On March 14, 2007, Burchill lost his OVW Championship to Aaron "The Idol" Stevens.<br>  <br>  On 10 April, 2007 at a Smackdown! taping, Burchill beat Flash Funk in a dark match.<br>  <br>  On 12 May 2007, Burchill defeated Aaron "The Idol" Stevens to once again become the OVW Heavyweight Champion. Two weeks later on 26 May 2007, Burchill was given a 3 count at the same time as Aaron "The Idol" Stevens to force a rematch for the then vacant title (the OVW website still recognized Burchill as their champion) on June 1st. Jay Bradley got involved and it was made a 3-Way Dance for the title. On June 1st, Jay Bradley defeated Burchill and Stevens to become new OVW Heavyweight Champion. However, Burchill regained the title from Bradley on the TV tapings at June 27, the show aired June 30.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Burchill competed in a dark match before the 14th July SmackDown! taping, teaming with fellow Brit Dave Taylor against the team of Funaki & Shannon Moore.

Then you take your off hand and keep it stiff and shoot until you don't even notice it's there.  Then slowly start using your off hand to support the ball when shooting and try not to flick it.  Watch some Jordan tapes, and see how he keeps he off hand stiff, even in his follow through.  Practice this for a month or two, and before you know it, you'll be a sharp shooter.  It worked for me and my friends.|`|6mr7nljBaa	the best way without shooting one handed would be to shoot free throws. dont worry about the feet and jump yet. hold the ball with your strong hand near the bottom closest to you. the weak hand should face straight from you to the basket, not grabbing the ball too hard, hold the ball up softly. You should be able to see a triangle-like shape made from your arms if holding it right.<br>  bend your knees, slowly extend them while also raising the ball above your head, and then flick the wrist; make sure the ball rolls off your fingers and not the hand; the weak hand should remain in the position in which it started<br>  <br>  practice that and begin practicing a jump shot. jumping somewhat high is important so you dont have your shot blocked<br>  <br>  also, high arc is not a problem as long as you are strong enough to get it to the basket. it is actually a slight advantage because it is harder for the opponent to block it<br>  <br>  just practice until the shots consistently drop then you can call yourself a shooter; then keep practicing<br>  <br>  good luck|`|SfvEemscaa	If you have watched Kobe shoot the ball, he steadies the ball with his left hand on the side of the ball and follows through with his right hand! Watch him and practice, practice, practice. If you are comfortable with a high arch, then stay with it and remember follow through with the wrist. Try it!

Sans précision supplémentaire, je pense qu'on attend des pronostics chez les hommes et chez les femmes. De mon c?té, je vois bien chez les hommes la victoire se jouer (pas original) entre Federer, Nadal et Djokovic. Contrairement aux autres, je pense que Federer et surtout Nadal ont été enterrés un peu vite. Souvenez vous de la large victoire de Federer sur Nadal à Hambourg : on faisait de Roger le favori numéro de Roland-Garros et on a vu le résultat. Je vois Nadal gagner "la belle" en finale contre Federer. Est-ce que Djokovic est près à assumer la charge de favori qu'il vient de s'octroyer à Montréal ? Ce n'est pas impossible, mais n'oubliez pas à qui il aura à faire.<br>   Chez les femmes, si tous mes espoirs et pensées vont vers Marion Bartoli (depuis toujours et pour toujours), je vois bien la victoire se dessiner entre Ivanovic (très en forme(s)), Sharapova (tenante du titre) et une des soeurs Williams (on ne sait jamais laquelle va surgir) : les américains sont toujours très forts dans "leur" tournoi. Petit avantage à Ivanovic.|`|7sW46OgCaa	Bonne question.

Ps0e8926aa	Io ho fatto un'esperienza del genere (e la sto facendo tuttora). Al momento ho 29 anni, ho cominciato a giocare a rugby 2 anni fa. Certo è un po' dura all'inizio, non si ha l'elasticità mentale nè fisica dei 18 anni, però si puo' fare... eccome! Ho giocato questi due anni nel campionato di serie C (più che abbordabile anche per noi novellini) e sto per iniziare il mio terzo campionato. Nel frattempo abbiamo fondato una nuova squadra e cerco di condividere tutto ciò che vivo con i nuovi ragazzi che vengono a giocare... Di sicuro non arriverò in serie A, ma mi diverto davvero tanto e sono sicuro che tu potrai fare altrettanto. Ti consiglio di cercare un club nelle vicinanze e cominciare, solitamente anche le squadre più grandi hanni una "seconda squadra" che, vedrai, ti accoglierà a braccia aperte. Il rugby è ottimo per tenersi in forma e divertirsi con gli amici, anche a 30 anni.

sPJPKUhpaa	Theres not much for you to do right now, really. I'm guessing you're gonna try out next year, so ask the coach why you were cut and ask him what you should do to make the team next year, don't be embarassed or shy about it, if you worked hard at try-outs, you have the right to know where you went wrong in the coach's mind. I am sure you've heard of Michael Jordan being cut from his high school team (as a sophomore), he didn't cry about, he came back stronger the next year. I mean, if there's 50 kids trying out then your schools basketball team is probably top notch, no? Schools with top notch basketball teams usually don't have room for freshman. As far as I know, they mostly take people who're coming back from the team last year. Maybe that one kid who did 30 suicides and made it knew the coach, was coming back to the team from last year and had ashma, you never know but don't worry about anyone else, it's all you. Don't let it get to your head. Instead, allow it to make you stronger and thats the only thing you can do if you truly want to improve. Keep playing/practing while maintaining a love for the game and having fun. Be sure to work on your off-hand and constantly having your shot under maintenance. You'll definatiely have a better chance next year. Never give-up and make a positive out of the negative, it was a good experience, right? Goodluck, man.|`|gqoIfbH0aa	Thats just messed up.. but let me tell you something.. coaches say hustle is the most imprtant thing.. they are LYING THROUGH THEIR TEETH! I hustle and got cut too. And here's another thing.. your freshmen.. your the first ones to go in a coaches mind. Oh yeah and if the kid knows the coach well then he makes it automatically.. as I said, thats messed up..<br>  <br>  Well then.. He must know the coach or otherwhise he averages 25 points a game.|`|HRcgM1YXaa	First of all good job in giving it your all that is it matters. But I understand on how you feel because you feel like your hard work did not pay off, that is part of life and is not fair but what does not kill you makes you stronger. What I would do at this point is talk to the coach and said the following ( coach I was wondering if I could talk to you, first of all I want to thank you for the opportunity to try out for the team, but was wondering if I could get your honest opinion on my performance by pointing out my strength and weakness. Also can you give me  tips on what and how I could improve my game to  make sure I don't miss the team next year) let him answer all your questions and at the end tell him this ( well since I did not make the team this year I was wondering if I could still be part of the team by practicing or helping around) what this is going to show that coach is that you want to play so bad that you are willing to pay your dues and I think that if he lets you practice with the team that will help you for next year....Do not give up keep on trying, life will bring this kind of challenges but there is allways a way around them just explore your options and ask question like you did here..... I wish you good luck and let me know what the coach says, but make sure you talk to him other wise you are back to square one it will help you one way or the other if you talk to him......."IN LIFE YOU WILL MISS EVERY SHOOT YOU DON"T TAKE" remember that so take every shot you can.... By the way I was also a freshman in my high school when I try out for the varsity made the team but I was told that I was not going to play much, well I prove them wrong because by the third game I started for the rest of the season. The way I did it was by taking advantage of every minute I was giving, did not score many points but I dove for every ball play tough defense got rebounds and more than anything pump my team up by doing all this and created tempo for the game. I loved every minute off it... GOOD LUCK|`|r8CVFUTIaa	The thing with high school coaches is that they tend to have favorites ( mostly juniors and seniors ) whose try-outs are a mere formality ( the sad truth is that whether they were awful during try outs or not, they get picked) I can't say that I'm surprised that you got cut because you're a freshman.  Because it happened to me too
AA11548269	The 49er game was a great game because if Arnaz Battle fumbled the ball and one of the Arizona Cardinals got the ball, the game would have been over.  Alex Smith and the niners went on fourth down and he ran the ball himself saving his team to have a chance to win the game. <br>  <br>  I was listening to the 49ers game on the radio and I felt that they are going to lose the game if they did not make it on fourth down.  I almost turned off the radio if they did not make it until Alex Smith ran the ball and got the first down, then I was thinking okay the exciting part is going on.  The game ended at 10:45 p.m. PST.<br>  <br>  Ravens-Bengals game was not that exciting because at the end the Bengals intercept the ball.  The Ravens would have the opportunity to score a touchdown and tie the game.

1DvVlrejaa	Menurut pendapat saya, sejarah sepak bola bermula dari kehidupan zaman dulu. Biasanya, terlebih dulu membentuk 2 kelompok dengan jaring yang digunakan untuk gawang. Siapa yang memperoleh gol terbanyak, kelompok itulah yang menang. Sedangkan siapa yang memperoleh gol terendah, kelompok itulah yang kalah. Pada perkembangannya, sepak bola menjadi salah satu olahraga yang sangat populer di dunia. Tak hanya itu, yang dulunya tak ada peraturan dalam bermain sepak bola, sekarang terdapat peraturan-peraturan yang harus ditaati dalam bermain sepak bola.|`|wYCn2Sqyaa	menurut saya sejarah sepak bola g usah jauh jauh ke eropa. di negeri tercinta ini dulu pada masa kerajaan majapahit sudah memeinkan sepak bola dari sabut kelapa yang dibakar,,<br>  <br>  malahan kelihatan keren,,<br>  <br>  so sejarah sepak bola dari bangsa kita sendiri,,<br>  <br>  hehehe,,<br>  <br>  maaf kalau jawaban saya salah,,,|`|9xJlsakbaa	Halo,<br>  <br>  Menurut saya, sejarah sepakbola termasuk hal yang konyol.<br>  Berawal dari anak-anak bangsawan Inggris yang bermain 'tendang-tendangan' sabut kelapa, tanpa aturan yang jelas, tanpa jumlah pemain yang jelas, yang hanya sekedar bersenang-senang.<br>  <br>  Lama-lama peminat permainan itupun banyak, dan akhirnya bukan hanya anak-anak bangsawan yang bermain, tetapi anak-anak lainnya pun meniru permainan itu.<br>  <br>  Akhirnya permainan itu dimasukkan ke dalam kategori olahraha. Dan peraturan-peraturan dalam sepakbola lambat laun muncul sebagai penutup 'cacat'-nya permainan ini. Seperti permainan kotor akan diberikannya tendangan bebas atau tendangan penalty kepada regu yang dirugikan, lemparan ke dalam atau tendangan sudut atau tendangan gawang untuk regu yang bukan terakhir kali mengeluarkan bola dari lapangan, munculnya kartu kuning dan kartu merah sebagai peringatan bagi orang yang bermain kotor, dan lain sebagainya.<br>  <br>  Semoga jawaban saya memuaskan,<br>  Terima kasih.
GJqkSs7Eaa	I think the German side is going to take this one.  I like the way they came out in their last match and I've thought they are the team to beat from the get go.  Ballack finally played well.  Podolski has been paying great ball.  Klose is going to get involved sooner or later.<br>  <br>  Portugal is tough and Ronaldo is a force - no question about that.  <br>  <br>  It should be one heck of a match, but I think Germany will advance, then beat Croatia, and face Italy in the finals - a rematch of that classic World Cup Semifinal game!|`|A4LuL503aa	It all depends on how well the German defense plays. They looked pretty solid against Austria but could have been better. Both Germany and Portugal are strong offensive teams and will likely score at least one goal each. I'm going to go with Germany 2 Portugal 1 simply because Lehmann seems to be a bit more solid in net than Ricardo, who let in some unimpressive goals against the Swiss.|`|Y6aAy2hoaa	Germany to win on penalties - They always win & always win penalty shoot-outs - I should know.... I'm from England|`|DNxaK0hJaa	Germany Vs Turkey|`|UJoNqCLPaa	Germany have just won! <br>  <br>  Germany looked like beating portugal all along. Germany have a better team. <br>  <br>  Germany v Turkey in my opinion.<br>  Maybe the final will be Germany v Spain or Holland.<br>  <br>  Spain/Holland will definately be in the finals as they have a top class football team.

IYm9a3SUaa	5-11.|`|AA10456571	11-5<br>  <br>  EDIT: Jarrid, I don't think you understand that the Raiders O-line iz very good at run bloCKing ever since they moved Robert Gallery at LG. They were 6th in rushing last season while using average runningbaCKs. Now that they have an above average runningbaCK, they will dominate in the running game. JaMarcus Russell started only one game against the Chargers and he complete over 70 percent of his passes in that one game and he attempted more than 30 passes while throwing 1 TD, 1 int, and over 250 yards.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Sorry, I meant he has above average speed. The Raiders zone bloCKing scheme will benefit any fast runningbaCK.|`|tSDhcGOUaa	I can easily see 10 to 11 wins, but I don't know if that'll be enough for a wildcard birth.  The AFC is much tougher overall than the NFC, and with NE, Ind., Jacksonville, Pittsburg, and the Browns alone the playoff spots are leaving quick.  I just actually want an improvement, a solid offensive showing and defensively stop the run.  Many will hate on the Raiders, but #1 McFadden is SEC speed and that can't be taught, or most times caught up with.  Additionally while the Raiders did finish 6th in rushing, the offensive line got better with the run by using a zone blocking scheme that takes the linemen a little while to catch on, so they'll even be better the upcoming season.  Some x factors many don't count are Michael Bush who was a top 10 pick before his injury 3 years before, and this is his first season healthy since then.  Fargas rushed for over 1000 yards and was hurt, and the defensive backfield was solid getting 18 picks last year.  Though Hall can be mouthy, the Raiders have spent enough picks on DB's to back him up as well as Asumonga who is probably one of the best shut down corners in the league.  The DT's must be strong and healthy all season, and Javon Walker was a very pricey WR who may not pan out, but... with the TE they picked last year, Fargas coming out of the backfield, and McFadden coming out of the backfield, Curry, and Higgens will occupy the long and medium routes.  People will see that when McFadden gets past the D line, LB's will be too slow to contain him, and dbacks will be to small to stop him.  Thats my take, and if they don't make the playoffs, the draft picks will be to fill up on the o line, d line, and maybe a high priced wr, everyone else will be role players and won't get large dollars were already spent out for the future.|`|27A8TvXuaa	11-5<br>  at best<br>  <br>  they have made great off season additions and are finally ready to win|`|f1HKgd4Gaa	they will do great , and i think their record will be at least 10-6 and maybe even a wild card|`|PAL1xEp8aa	0-16|`|73005772047668391bb3ee6a5ceba354aa	6-10. They still have no offensive line and they were ranked towards the bottom on several defensive categories. They are improved, but how much better can McFadden be than what they had. Fargas made them a top 6 running team and yet they make him a backup for someone that is just as good? I think Dorsey would have improved their team more. Javon Walker's chances of playing 16 games is about 15% right now.|`|eUK4k20maa	11-5? cmon be serious all they did in the off season was draft an unproven running back. With an awful o-line wich means no good for Mcfadden<br>  <br>   and sighed a somewhat decent cornerback.. they have a QB that has started one or two games  that has like a 57% comp. percentage<br>  <br>  Raiders in 08/09----6-10<br>  <br>  Raiders fan:D-Mac HAS NOT PLAYED A SINGLE NFL GAME.. we dont know if he is above average yet|`|zY1fdz3Eaa	im a diehard loving raiders fan myself,but im always completely honest, i hope we win 5 games instead of the 4 we won last yr.,it was stupid of us to trade away all our picks in the draft for complete garbage(COUGHCOUGHWALKERCOUGH),hes fragile and wont boost our offense or have an impact i think mcfadden will,i hope 5 games even though it wont get us anywhere,but other than that atleast jus match what we had last year to be honest..|`|pxvngCCDaa	i say 11-5<br>  <br>  raiders are my favorite team and now we have a pontenially elite running back d-mac and justin fargas too<br>  <br>  our d is amazing and underated, 2 fantastic CBs asomugha and hall, derrick burgess, kirk morrison<br>  <br>  russel to walker all season Baby!!!|`|j400rGRCaa	6-10 not making the playoffs...but in two years..they will go farther.....there just rockies...mcfadden ain't no adrian peterson....and russell ain't no tony romo......so they need more time to read the game.....|`|gjKmR6Iraa	8-8.

5arjzJEtaa	i played and was captain in middle school<br>  <br>  As far as things to work on..<br>  --get a vball and pass it to someone or on a wall its perfectly fine. make sure u have a good stance and u aren't too stiff.<br>  --on the wall work on setting, make a diamond with ur fingers at ur forehead and push outward towards the ball. like superman. um then work on spiking.<br>  --practice jumping as high as u can. then do ur approach. THEN add the ball. hav someone toss or set it to you.<br>  --for middle school its not as important bt u shud try an overhand serve, do it so ur most comfortable and u get it in most serves. but underhand is fine.<br>  <br>  they will proabably run u alot to see who REALLY wnts to make it. so dont give up. but since its middle school the coachs will probably explain everything to you that they want you to know. i cam in in middle school having never played before. make sure u know basic rules and things. just have a smile and hustle, run EVERYWHERE. and dont bad talk the coach. be coachable. <br>  <br>  hope this helps<br>  =D|`|cbveo27haa	I'm also an 8th grader trying out for volleyball. Our tryouts were and are yesterday,today,wednesday,and thursday. I played Last year so I had learned a lot. But in your case i would work on setting and bumping the most becasue that is the most important thing. So get one of your buddys from the team and practice once a day before tryouts. Get your setting down and bumping down and you'll be in good shape. =]<br>  <br>  second time volleyball player |`|qlcX9TbBaa	work on serving and passing. Those are the 2 most important things that coaches look for. Attacking is a plus and so would blocking. But have confidence and dont worry!!!! good luck!|`|pt8UHQJmaa	practice with a friend |`|CJBDOyM8aa	Well, you wanna work on everything. I wouldnt so much worry about over hand serving but you could practice that to. you should practice bumping definetly try bumping it up in the air to yourself or practice with a friend.if you have a volleyball net i would suggest setting it up to practice serving or setting, and even spiking. I've been playing volleyball since 5th grade. It's and extremely addictive sport. as long as your head's in the game you should do fine. just focus and dont let other girls intimidate you or anything like that. do your best! <br>  good luck! |`|Wu0XyNspaa	Even though you're tall and good at spiking, you're missing the most important skills in volleyball; passing and serving!<br>  <br>  I coach grade 8 girls volleyball, and I like my players to be able to underhand pass and serve before I start teaching them how to spike.<br>  <br>  Just start passing against a wall about 100 times a day (or more!).  Make sure you get someone to show you how to do it properly.<br>  <br>  But don't worry, at grade 8, a lot of people are still developing their skills, and because you're tall and good a spiking, you'll probably make the team.  Just keep on improving!|`|R4mgRY3daa	Work on that approach and sets if you plan on being a front row player (which I would suggest since you're tall). Work out your legs to build muscle for your jumps and work out your arms too. OH and don't hit the poor back row libero-esque player in the face. PLEASE. It hurts really bad.

3a54cf17051a047dcddaa46497cca406aa	Twins will hopefully win...<br>  <br>  Twins play KC with home advantage and they are on a hot-streak.<br>  <br>  Sox play Indians next and I don't think they can win all 3 games.|`|P1bO87l1aa	I really don't care who wins since I am not a fan of either team (Cardinals fan) .  Its going to be exciting athcing this last weekend of the season,  Not only the Twins White Sox but the National League hjas a real interesting matchup for the wild card.  Weather in a problem in New York and Phildelphia which may force some games into next week.|`|6tGYe5roaa	I think that the Twins are going to win it. They have a better chance of winning their last series than the Sox do. |`|G4wGCghdaa	I think now it will be the Twins. Both the Royals and Indians are playing the spoiler but the sweep of the Sox probably will give the Twins just enough momentum to win by a game. Wouldn't even be answering this question had Carlos Quentin not broken his own hand.<br>  |`|MT9vBy3Baa	I have to say the White Sox because they have a make up game with Detroit in Chicago and if necessary the 1 game playoff game is also in  Chicago. Also Minnesota has a bad road record if it came to that. |`|TCehI17kaa	I'm pulling for the Twins to surprise everyone & win the Central.|`|b4y4eYRyaa	 twins will!|`|f050411b882c8087b6c8256c1e5c7699aa	The Twins, that half game lead is going to look nice while playing KC, and don't forget the momentum they will carry into this series after the sweep. Plus I don't think there is anything Cleveland would love to do this weekend then play spoilers to the Chi Sox. Just imagine how many Indians fans would love to give the choke sign to Ozzie, just like he did to them in 2005. Perhaps this is karma coming back to get the Sox.|`|847c36ccb0451d939a175eefa01ab502aa	Sad for me since I'm a sox fan but I think the twins will pull it off unless K.C can beat the twins 2 out of 3 and the sox sweep Cleveland at home (which they have done already)|`|20iCt13Faa	The anti-yankees win the division...

mj1bC73gaa	Just goes to prove all clubs have their wannkers hey?  What a tosser?<br>  <br>  I don't know why he didn't go for the 3-for-1 deal.  Some of the users on here had us down as certainties for that too.  For the record GFC-B and I have both been saying "Don't count on it" - same goes for Amada and most of the other long term Cats fans on here.  Haven't seen those blow-ins since the granny have you?|`|265fd4cbb93fdd2558477d6a36b37857aa	Haha thats quite funny! Well yes some of them may have been cocky but I think that they have been knocked down a peg or two now and thats not such a bad thing! <br>  <br>  When Aker came out with his comments about what Scarlett allegedly said, I knew right away that if Scarlett really did have that attitude, he was playing with fire because we all know that as soon as one gets cocky things will go the opposite way, and they did!<br>  <br>  I have also noted that Sam Newman and Billy Brownless behave as though they are personally responsible for the Cats success over the last two years. Perhaps someone should remind them both that neither of them could do it when they played for Geelong! Anyway, the g/f loss might quieten them down with some luck.<br>  <br>  I would like to take this opportunity to offer my commiserations to Quandry and GFC B and point out that they are NOT 'cocky Cats supporters'. Better luck next year guys.|`|UZlMpj5Raa	haha. funny story.<br>  <br>  i think stereotypically yes, but otherwise no.|`|Kw1qPPjoaa	Hahaha, I hope the Storm lose just so he has to live with it!<br>  <br>  He probably put the moz on them!|`|nB2sVcbBaa	haha<br>  that was like collingwoods premierships in '27 '28 '29 '30<br>  then in 1931 we were in the GF against geelong<br>  the president at the time was so sure we would win that he got all the players mini premiership cups 2 celebrate 5 premierships in a row<br>  well guess wat?<br>  we lost didnt we<br>  the president was so pissed so he just gav all the cups 2 any primary schools that wanted them<br>  my old primary school got 1 n ever since that cup has been used 4 the schools house footy competition<br>  geelong were neva 100% certain 2 win so dont no y he would do that<br>  yep very cocky|`|NVgTo4L6aa	hey, i'm not cocky, i just like my catters,  if your team had won so many games you must admit you'd probably be a little cocky,  good on the hawks, they were too darn good on Saturday, they played like we normally do, but were just a bit harder at the ball i thought.<br>  <br>  i will admit that that guy was way toooooo cocky though, what an idiot, he could of waited for saturday night to come, it's pretty funny though, hehehe.  <br>  <br>  i know i'm a girl and have neva played but i have two eyes, and my whole family is a footballing family, my dad, uncles, brothers all play or played the game.<br>  <br>  smile people|`|mblS6feBaa	i cant be bothered to look at the link<br>  but even tho some geelong supporters may be cocky.. not all are<br>  my dad was so nervous all through the finals.. he even thought that st kilda could beat them<br>  i was more relaxed than him...<br>  so he definitely isnt cocky|`|3CWvM9ZFaa	Most geelong supporters aren't cocky, we just had confidence (and why wouldn't you) that guy was just an idiot.  No true supporter counts their chickens before they hatch!!|`|1ff29dbd5a6d251ec49f367844b20ba0aa	Yes.  What an idiot.|`|VCHCanJnaa	NO and im not a geelong supporter they enjoy there wins like all supporters do and if your team was doing as well as they are im sure we would all rub it in|`|iVctzFEQaa	no|`|oSw7VxWvaa	Haha!

4045eeb32c4ef2d7acd08239fb1eff37aa	I would suggest a good fitness routine.  Looking at todays top golfers they all work out on a regular basis.  Focus on core exercises, and movements similar to golf.  Also don't forget your cardiovascular system and get some time on the treadmill etc.  Also work on things that will improve your basic body movements.<br>  <br>  Also I would watch some golf on the weekends.  Look for "new" shots you may want to practice the next year.  Maybe learning a good flop shot etc.  Then read about them, and how to execute it.<br>  <br>  Practice your putting.  Drive for show...putt for dough.<br>  <br>  Read about the game, and the history of it.  Check out books like The Match, A Good Walk Spoiled, Tales From Q School, Caddy for Life, The Forgotten Men of Pebble Beach.  All great books.|`|WiIUEObTaa	with the weather in Western canada it may be 2 months. best bet. little bit of treadmill gym work. local Arena 2 dollar day. have a training grip put on a sewed medic us, or just a old weighted iron. plus the old putting carpet trick. dumb ell 25 lbs wrist curls. how could you lose to canucks. |`|NHM5pS0daa	You could suck it up, throw on the old thermal underwear, get your a$$ down to a piece of land / driving range / field etc etc that nobody is gonna mind you hitting golf balls into and then just smack the living hell out of 100 balls.

[yep, shameless plug]<br>  |`|EdDOBUC1aa	you can go to an indoor driving range and practice hitting balls...practice putting in your living room...go to a park and hit plastic balls (even if you live in a cold area...you can hit balls in the snow (just make sure they are not white!)<br>  <br>  Read some golf books...to get pointers from pros...and try them out in the spring.  <br>  <br>  Or, you can always go to the gym and work out.

He can't change his name on his jersey this season..|`|lR40HgdEaa	all of his sponserships are to chad johnson not chad ocho cinco so if he changed his jerseys it would be violation of contract and he would most likely have to pay money back |`|TX13gCoTaa	It has to do with licensing. The products sold by the NFL market him as Chad Johnson, so he has to maintain that until they are able to make jerseys and other PRODUCTS with his new surname. I don't think it is really that big of an issue because they make the switch quickly when a player is traded. I think that the NFL just doesn't want to cooperate with Ocho Cinco because they were the ones against him putting it on his jersey to begin with. They don't want players drawing added attention to themselves.<br>  |`|94cYJd5qaa	The NFL policy says that if he wants to have his jersey say Ocho Cinco before the end of the season, then he has to buy every piece of  Chad Johnson merchandise off the shelf's so it can be replaced with the stuff with his new name.  and since Ocho doesnt want to pay the estimated 4.8 million dollars to do so, he has decided to keep the C. Johnson jersey until the end of the year. |`|QuofdtDhaa	If he wants to change his jerset to Ocho Cinco, he has to buy all the remaining Chad Johnson jerseys that are in the market from Reebok. That is the only way he can have Ocho Cinco on his jersey. if he wants to buy them all it will cost around $3 million|`|lArnXvfraa	the  buy all the jersey thing is the shizzle|`|GqayfBlWaa	ocho idiot is a stupid fag that needs to be shot.

The scientific marvel in question is the Phiten necklace. It is a fabric-covered PVC rubber cord that apparently contains powdered titanium. The purported effects of wearing the necklace are increased energy, better blood flow, reduced muscle pain, and supple joints. The product is advertised on national TV, and the company runs a large number of stores selling the necklaces and titanium impregnated underwear, t-shirts, gels, creams and plasters. Many famous Japanese sports persons, including the entire Japanese Olympic volleyball team, wear the products. It's also being endorsed by major sports personalities (eg Randy Johnson) in the US. The US website is www.phitenusa.com/index.asp. The necklaces sell for about $40.<br>  <br>  The Phiten stores use an interesting "test" to convince potential buyers. In an idle moment I went into one of the shops and let the staff demonstrate the miracle to me. They have a brown paper carrier bag that contains a brick shaped object wrapped up in newspaper and tape. They ask you to stand, extend your arm and lift the bag from a chair. You then put the bag down, and they drape the necklace across your arm and ask you to lift the bag again. It's supposed to be easier with the necklace on your body. Three of my Japanese work colleagues were so impressed by this that they bought the necklaces and eagerly repeated the demonstration around the office.<br>  <br>  Randi comments: This is the old "Applied Kinesiology" scam, for which Gary has a rather good explanation:<br>  <br>  I have an idea why this "test" might appear to work. When a person tries to pick up an object the brain makes a rough guess as to how much strength it's going to require. With an unknown object wrapped in paper, we have no idea how much it's going to weigh. The Phiten brick is actually quite heavy, and most people are likely to underestimate the effort required. The test with the necklace draped over the arm is always the second attempt, by which time our brain has recalculated and knows exactly how much effort is required. Hence it seems much easier to lift.<br>  <br>  I also let the Phiten staff smear "titanium" gel on my neck and shoulders since I had bad neck pain that day. The shop assistant was rather startled when I reported that the pain hadn't instantly gone away. She stuck some titanium stickers on me and told me to give it more time. Well, that didn't work either. The whole thing is just a modern reworking of the familiar magnetism quackery, which incidentally also has a large following here in Japan. Interestingly, a chain of discount stores is now selling a knockoff non-branded rubber necklace that contains not only titanium but also powdered tourmaline (Why? For the negative ions, of course!) at 100 yen (about 90 cents). Just goes to show what the markup on Phiten necklaces must be.<br>  <br>  Thanks for all your valuable work and your fascinating website. It's good to know there are people out there battling the forces of ignorance and hogwash.<br>  <br>  The apparent success of "Applied Kinesiology" goes further than this, however. When I get the time, I'll tell you about my first encounter with this nonsense, back in New Jersey, about 1973….<br>  <br>  Junk science abounds on the Phiten website. For example:<br>  <br>  Phiten proprietary technology, PTi (patent pending), results in an aqueous solution of titanium that is considered insoluble in water. Our most popular series of products employ fibers deeply impregnated with aqueous titanium solution to help relax your muscles.<br>  <br>  A lie, plain and simple. Titanium is a very hard, corrosion-resistant, silvery metal, atomic number 22, insoluble in water — no matter what these idiots claim. Oh, but don't doubt that they'll get a patent on their "proprietary technology." It doesn't have to actually work, to get a patent; it just has to sound good to the clerks at the US Patent and Trademark Office.|`|LAH2HquDaa	Hey get a piece of string and cut one 22 inches and one 18 inches and tie it on ur neck and see for urself. |`|UpTkcH72aa	get the 18" .

0P71zlECaa	No doubt he wants to play. I think the coaches will hold him out against the Rams and target the Tampa Bay game for a return. But J Jones can veto the coaches and tell them to put Romo in. |`|ymqWa8GNaa	Don't count on it. He's an expensive asset. |`|rNUyV1EYaa	He is practicing on a limited basis. Romo can throw well, but the issue is the possibility of injuring the finger further. Right now Romo has a "non-displaced" fracture that does not require surgery. <br>  <br>  Should he play and perhaps take a helmet to the hand or fall on the finger, he will be out for an extended period of time.<br>  <br>  I think the Cowboys will play it safe and likely wait until next week to play Romo. Perhaps Jerry Jones saying Romo might play Sunday is just trying to throw the Rams off.|`|QuofdtDhaa	It is said that he might be able to play. He is going to be a game-time decision.

c6q3EERdaa	My guess is that he won the 82nd overall PGA Championship in 2000. I think the ball that says 32nd probably has paint worn off of the 8. It's probably the same kind of ball, maybe from the same person.|`|4045eeb32c4ef2d7acd08239fb1eff37aa	Possibly the same person...but not Tiger Woods.  I have never seen him have anything other than his name or marking on a ball.

WqwNmfDDaa	As was stated above, as a beginner you won't notice much difference between the sets.  The Wilson is a better set all around.  I personally started with and used a set of Dunlop for 5 years.  No real gripe that lead me to stop, just bought a better set.<br>  <br>  Most people (myself included) that buy boxed sets and use them over time do not keep the box putter, driver, and fairway wood.  Instead they end up purchasing singles of those that fit them, their swing, and the local golf conditions better so look at the quality of the irons over all the other included clubs and get the set with the ones you like more.  <br>  <br>  I would recommend replacing your putter first.  Out of 18 holes you will only make 10-12 strokes with your driver total, maybe 6-8 with your fairway wood, but you will use the various irons (3-Wedges) 2-5 or more strokes per hole, and your putter at least once per hole most likely more for a while.  <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|6InJBeweaa	if $50 doesnt mean that much to you i would go for the wilson's. they make an o.k club for beginners and they would give enought forgiveness also. lif its within ur budget buy the wilsons|`|b1eacc63c481ff40082f035f83d011d1aa	If I was in your shoes, I'd use that extra $50 for other accessories that grab my eye.<br>  <br>  A practise driving net for the backyard or that better putter you see someone with. Maybe a lesson with a pro.<br>  <br>  Have fun and good luck|`|4045eeb32c4ef2d7acd08239fb1eff37aa	You should go with what is in your budget right now.  Find out if this is going to be a game that you are going to continue to play.  Also ask a local golf shop what they might reccomend (might have some used clubs on the cheap).  As for which one...as a beginner it isn't the arrow...it's the Indian.  You need to learn the swing mechanics...then worry about other clubs.  Both would probably serve their purpose.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and welcome to a wonderful sport.

Overall I give you a B+|`|qnfEEpS6aa	yeah you definitely need help in rebounding. i would trade one of your guards since you have a lot of them for a center. there should be a team that needs a good shooting that would be willing to give up a center. |`|8FLRoxEqaa	Nice including when you have Williams, Williams, and Roy as your guards PERFECT!<br>  <br>  <br>  9

3DQYjddeaa	Has to do with the history between the programs. Also the close proximity of the two cities and the fact that they are in the same division. But, to be completely honest, it is something made up by Browns fans to try and make it seem as though they are on the same level as the Black and Gold.................... GO STEELERS!!!!|`|16e94bf24b6e37847feefaa920420580aa	there is a rivalry because they are in the same division, so they play each other twice every regular season, also because the teams are fairly close to each other. some people live in pennsylvania and are browns fans, some live in ohio and are steeler fans because the are actually closer to pittsburgh than cleveland. and although the browns do suck, they used to beat the steelers a lot years ago. the two have met 113 times including the playoffs, and the steelers are winning the all time series (since 1950) 58-55. the browns were winning overall until 2006.|`|0880ac45fbb6456e1e6cd4a33571a64faa	It doesn't have anything to do with this season in particular, it's more about being in the same division and past history. There have been several times in history where both teams were good and had to "fight it out" to win their division.  Besides, every NFL team has a rival.  They have to hate someone!|`|dbpq1wGDaa	as a steelers fan from california lol, its a rivalry cause cleveland and pittsburgh are close and also their used to be no baltimore ravens and the browns used to be good as well as the steel curtain|`|dywILy7oaa	you have to look at the history of the rivalry. yes Steelers have dominated lately but the rivalry is close PIT 58 wins and CLE 55.. so it is close over the 113 game series. the first game was in 1950 so it is a old rivalry it just hasnt been much of one this decade.|`|Z8hGA5Tgaa	Its like the Chargers/Raiders rivalry they are still bitter division rivals even though one is dominated every time but some teams have bitter rivals like the Cowboys/Redskins or Steelers/Browns.|`|SpAv1g2maa	I don't care about  the rivalry, what i know for sure is that it's the Steelers all the way.  |`|VSqrlskDaa	They play in the same division so they play each other twice a year. I think it also helps that Pittsburgh and Cleveland are located only about 2-3 hours from each other!|`|c14Am13laa	cool|`|15wwA3jjaa	Division rivalry my dear... it doesn't matter how good or bad each team is, if their in the same division, there is always going to be bad blood.|`|1ccf4408a6862b6272c7872e63b19c51aa	Well the Steelers are always the Better Team every Year since 1972, The Browns haven't Succeed since Jim Brown last Played Football, Its Been BLACK AND GOLD Since the 70's and The Steelers have 5 Super Bowls that matter and The Browns have none since 1964, so best take the Steelers If you don't live in the State of Ohio, You'll sleep better at night.
2nmFFFQ4aa	If youre looking for the coin type thing you put on the ground, I found this website that for $25.00, you can upload 3 photos (or designs) that will be imprinted into 3 ball markers. I plan on taking some pictures of the kids and giving them to my wife for christmas.<br>  <br>  If youre looking for something to put on a ball, go to Golfballs.com. They can print on any type of ball and its not that expensive (depending on what ball you use)|`|6basoRGDaa	I think it will depend on what ball, but lets say he likes titelist Pro V1 golf balls( most people love these high quality but expensive balls). If you go to Titleist's website they have an option in which you can get your balls personalized with a name or a few words on the ball. If you want a logol, that can happen to... with these same balls I think though it may not be Titleist or the manufacturer of the golf ball that does it directly. So you can definitely personalize the golf ball with your dad's name on it or some nickname or insde joke or whatever, but if you want like some sort of coloring or logo/artwork, there are companies that do that. (I find golf balls all the time with company logos or golf course names on them, but I have never seen one with a personal drawing thing... Names on golf balls are very common though). Google personalized golf balls or something and you can add to the custom lettering that Titleist will do for you. Maybe Titleist will do the artistry themselves but I doubt it. It can be done by other companies however.|`|aX8nee8gaa	This is a great gift idea and very thoughtful but may be tough to pull off. The companies that all do this specialty sort of work have a minimum number of pieces that you are required to buy (usually 100 is the starting point). Then you have to pay set up fees, artwork and all that. It ends up being something that is cost effective only if you are doing lots and lots of them. If you are set on a ball marker then you can search the internet for lots of different sites that carry custom ball markers. You could look for 1 from Scotland, or his alma mater, something along those lines. Or you could try to get a gift box with a ball marker and divot tool from his favorite golf course, or maybe the 1 he played as a kid, or when he was dating your mom, something in his past that would have a strong attachment. That may mean more to him than a custom one.<br>  Good luck, its a very nice idea|`|d0PFbP3Taa	Go to a hobby shop,an auto repair shop and see if they have a piece of soft metal like zinc strip Get a small piece slightly larger than a dime and smaller than a nickel. Scribe a heart on the metal. Now get a file and file away everything outside the heart. That will make a ball mark not soon forgotten.Round the edges slightly so that everything is smooth. Have a jewelry store give you a free ring box for the ball mark..|`|3kwC67H0aa	Hi Micky-<br>  <br>  If you want to design a ball marker...how about a small (coin sized) round frame (jewelry store can help you out here) with your photo inside.  What dad would not love that from his daughter?<br>  <br>  If it's a design on a ball you want.  Buy the balls and some sharpie markers and design him something that you draw.  The "from the heart" gift will be appreciated and should delight him.  Having it professionally done is way too expensive.  If you really can't draw, get some golf ball stencils from a golf shop and put his initials on the balls you buy and repackage.<br>  <br>  Put a voucher for a "free" round of golf with a cart from his favorite club inside the box.<br>  <br>  Have a great holiday!<br>  <br>  J|`|BovpXrk1aa	tie clip pin will work with his initials|`|4045eeb32c4ef2d7acd08239fb1eff37aa	I agree that they are expensive to have made.

P0g8Niqoaa	No, its because he's a train wreck...<br>  <br>  I doubt WWE wants to risk the negative publicity (since the media always take every opportunity to report anything negative in wrestling) if he should have another "wellness" violation while he's the champ (which, by the way, would be his third and mean instant dismissal). His wrestling style, although better than it has been, is also pretty slack and could lead to him injuring himself or others. On the other side, he shifts a lot of merch so I think he'll always have a job, unless the aforementioned occured.<br>  <br>  I doubt Matt has anything to do with Jeff's chances at being champ.<br>  <br>  Oh and ignore Trend Killin' he's clearly a douche. And add, pathofreason to the list too. Douche.|`|dywILy7oaa	sadly i agree with G P.  Jeff hardy is one of my all time favorites but he can be bad publicity. if he would get his act together he would have the potential to be a great champion. <br>  <br>  Just throwing this out there. Jeff hardy was going to get a push a while back but Steph mcMahon didnt want him to because it would interfere with HHH getting back in the title hunt and getting back the title. That wwas in an article i read a couple months back. dont know how much truth was in the article but thought it was interesting.|`|wm5d9ZEUaa	That most certainly is not the case!!! I mean it makes sense but I just think that they are holding him back because of his personal life no joke. It's like hey you can be in the spot light but since you made some bad decisions in the past you cant have the prize just yet!!!|`|TZWGWAHdaa	jeff hardy is sh*t and they will not make him champ he is not big or anything|`|31o7hLghaa	No it is all about politics, Jeff is not in the good books with the son in law of the power ie. HHH. Due to this anything that Jeff does will be taken highly into account, not only that there is his problem with recreational drugs that also lets him down. Matt Hardy's position atm has nothing to do with Jeff's as they are both traveling completely different paths. <br>  Don't you think that WWE would benefit from having both of the Hardy brothers holding the major titles of two of its brands? <br>  But when it comes to WWE politics always cloud the judgment of popularity and what is really going to boost ratings.|`|quBjcgtkaa	Jeff Hardy's lack of a world title run is purely due to his inability to stay clean long enough. He was scheduled to win Money in the Bank last year but eneded up being pulled from the match because of failing a drug test.<br>  <br>  Triple H BTW has pretty much nothing against Jeff as he wouldn't allow the creative team to put Jeff Hardy over on him several times if he didn't see a star in Jeff.|`|lghVPWA6aa	I don't think that it's the case, I think it's more that they don't see Jeff as being full-on main event material in relation to winning the championship. To be getting the title shots they see him as a part of the main event but not the main part of the main event.|`|1ced09090a18210ce355123ea9003d99aa	Jeff has not been a World Champ because of his immaturity and drug violations.<br>  <br>  There's no denying his popularity and his exciting in-ring style.  I'm sure Vince would love to have somebody that popular carrying one of his World Titles.  Jeff's got the right look to appeal to the younger fans, the ones buying the most merchandise.<br>  <br>  But, as others have said, Jeff's on his last chance with the WWE, one more violation and he's gone.  The WWE can't take the chance of having their World Champ fired like that.  After all of the drug-related deaths of the past few years, having their World Champ lose his job for that would make Vince and the entire WWE look like hypocrites, and might even bring the government back into their business.<br>  <br>  I really believe Matt being in the WWE has helped Jeff keep his job.  This is just my opinion, but I think Matt's probably had to do a lot of convincing to Vince and JR and who knows who else to keep Jeff in the WWE.  Jeff is not some mid-card minor player; everything he does is big news, and he's brought negativity publicity on to the WWE.<br>  <br>  I'm sure Vince and Creative (and Marketing) would love to have both Matt and Jeff holding singles titles.  That would be a great selling point and create new marketing angles.|`|05RmoBJ6aa	Once upon a time they had all four members of Evolution hold all the titles on RAW. Also once upon a time Chris Jericho, The Rock and Stone Cold Steve Austin held both the WWF and World Heavyweight Championships as the Undisputed Champion. Rey Mysterio is a cruiserweight and yet he won the World Heavyweight Championship. Also back before WCW folded David Arquette and Vince Russo both held the World Title---and they're not even wrestlers.<br>  <br>  I know these analogies are pretty off but I just wanted to illustrate virtually anything is possible in wrestling, even two brothers holding the company's top titles at the same time.<br>  <br>  There are loads of possible reasons why Jeff Hardy isn't WWE Champ yet. In my opinion Jeff Hardy still has that sort of midcard aura about him that makes him unready for the championship. I don't think he has really matured enough character-wise to hold a title of such prestige as the WWE or WHC. ECW Championship, maybe, but not the other two. Also as far as I know people are still keeping an eye on him because he might blow his chances again by doing something selfish and stupid.

9arF0TIEaa	idk team A gets a good player and plaxico has been having some trobles lately and julious jones is really bad this year so ya|`|eYvZJELxaa	based on fantasy points and stats, i think that marshawn lynch is overall more valuable then both buress and jones. however is you are in desperate need of a WR take buress and jones. the point value doesnt differ by a whole lot, and buress and jones..although not spectacular, are consistent players.|`|XGEXlFhDaa	team a is getting the deal|`|tFIfWplRaa	Team B|`|VcvAikvpaa	Team B defienetly. MArshawn LYnch is a great player. HE will give you a lot of points. But if you are getting Plaxico and Juilious, then B is better. Plaxico will get touchdwon passes especially since they are facing good run blocking teams in the next four games. ALso Juilios JOnes will get a lot o carries since Hasselback gone.|`|txWqw4F6aa	depends on the point valuation within the league, but if it is standard i would have to go with b|`|1ede4cc94df9e085429a06f916f5ae4faa	Team A. both burress and jones have been bad recently. |`|bgIYQS5Oaa	Team B|`|StLHlvySaa	well usually I would say team B, but who is team A's halfback?|`|AA11403020	A. Lynch is hot, Burress and Jones has troubles.

DmzXOTMFaa	Randy Moss definitely...He's been racking up 100 yard games as of late. I would start Hines Ward over TO at this point. Brad Johnson sucks hard.|`|e8998d8c8bdf12a545b0dfe2fd77052caa	Randy, ward|`|O4dkkqj2aa	1. Johnson<br>  2. Ward<br>  3. T.O.<br>  4. Moss|`|yE7ugLuyaa	Andre and TO are projected to have double digit weekends,and Roy Williams has learned enough plays to help take the double team off TO.Yes,Johnson does suck,but,Whitten(TE) is hurt,so I would go with TO.Moss is going to Indy.Ward is going to Washington,so drop Ward this week,he is a single digit projection.|`|9arF0TIEaa	I would go with ward and moss they both have better qbs at the moment and ward is on fire lately and moss is starting 2 get better every game sence the loss of Brady |`|tKWQvjyUaa	go with TO he is way over due and he always kills the giants ..also with moss because he and cassel are starting to get in rhythm
1ede4cc94df9e085429a06f916f5ae4faa	defntly start warner even though its very tempting to start orton i would take go with the best wr trio in the league with boldin, fitz, and breaston. i mean carolina has a better defense and warner did realy good against them|`|9arF0TIEaa	That would be really tough <br>  So like ya I would go with orten I think he will have a great game plus if him and the bears can win with 48 points mostly all passes then I would go with him bcause ya he is going againts the lions so good luke man|`|dfeb00a8727feb0b038ed889d65e5c7aaa	Cardinals love to throw the football, and Warner is getting great points because of that.|`|XGEXlFhDaa	wow definetely go with kurt warner hes been on fire lately.|`|AA11403020	I say Warner. |`|AA10863855	You got to stick with Warner.  He was pretty good against the hard Panthers' pass D.  The Rams suck.  The Lions suck more but the Bears are a run 1st team.
TbO83l3yaa	as long the rest of our division keeps losing too, we will be fine. But we really need to get a better D-line, and a dominent linebacker (someone like Joey Porter). With D-backs i think we are good but Dre bly needs to be more consistent. AND we definetely need to be getting the ball to Marshal 15 times a game.|`|XaFYUMRSaa	I hope they do go 4-12,|`|8UTJ0kFNaa	I still see the Broncos going 10-6, but realistically I do not see them going deep into the playoffs if they make them. The defensive line is a problem, just like it usually is. They are too light and get pushed around by the other teams. When the line gets pushed around the LB's are not as effective, and the secondary has to do too much to cover for them which leaves them vulnerable against the pass.<br>  On the offensive side the turnovers need to stop, and the red zone offense needs to put up TD's. They have a lot of talent in the passing game as far as QB, TE, and WR and this talent needs to be utilized better. They cannot be utilized better when the undersized line is being pushed around and Cutler has no time to get the ball to his receivers.|`|4blCVEvOaa	Our defense is atrocious! The offense needs to work on cutting the turnover count and putting points on the board like we all know they can. If that happens, we'll still win the division with perhaps a 9-7 or 10-6 record.<br>  <br>  Keep the faith.<br>  <br>  Go Broncos!!|`|UGAr0M3laa	NO WAY!!!!! broncos wont go 4-12! thats the raiders! broncos will go 9-7 or something like that! GO BRONCOS! |`|XuGFt3boaa	You guys are going to win some games.  I'm predicting that the Broncos will win 6 games to make the playoffs.  Don't give in.|`|Cm86ddQQaa	you guys need a defense like crazy. |`|55d7a229ce4c50d6ac9459065b8f50abaa	No, they are not a 4-12 team... they have 7-9 or 8-8 written all over them.  They are in first and still have games against the Raiders and Chiefs at home.|`|lXYOR8Ixaa	No they will do better than that. They have a weak division and their offense when clicking can throw up a large amount of points<br>  they will win two more at the very least

qnfEEpS6aa	how many teams are in this league?? The other guys don't know how to draft or something. thats a pretty solid lineup. I agree with the other guy. Turnovers might be an issue but other than that its looks pretty good. |`|5cBGMTdhaa	looks good to me, Turnovers will be a problem, you should have good numbers in all the other categories. 
uxiXwyvUaa	I just don't see a Northern Hemisphere team beat the All Blacks soon. And espescially with the new ELV's it will be even more dificult. I think the gam will start close and it will seem like Ireland has a chance but the the All Blacks will score 2 tries and game will be out of Irelands hands. Ireland might pull it together towards the end but it will be to late.<br>  <br>   Half time score 12 NZ - 9 Ireland<br>   Final Score 28 - 15 to the All Blacks|`|n2cetqXOaa	ALL BLACKS.<br>  <br>  AB- 32<br>  IRELAND-9<br>  <br>  BUT BE CAUTIOUS THE LUCK OF THE IRISH:<br>  BRAIN O'DRISCOLL,PETER STRINGER,RONAN O'GARA....<br>  <br>  GO ALL BLACKS BRO!!!!|`|mber3JoAaa	All Blacks 28 Ireland 16|`|zXK9hVCPaa	30 + to the AB's|`|qEzwnbAxaa	Ireland will lose, NZ won't get the grand slam though.|`|qpxveIfzaa	hopefully Nz will win... but irish should make abs play hard for the win...  Nz win by 20+ lol bring it =P|`|EJVLM5v0aa	Allblacks will pull through once again.!<br>  I have t.a.b odds on them so they better :P<br>  <br>  Go the ABs|`|MbSR290maa	Oh please, have you seen the line up. Too good, too strong, will stay undefeated!!! go the AB's|`|NyWQb5Ymaa	yes|`|gz2M5hsBaa	Ireland has never beaten the All-Blacks. Ireland has one of the world's best forward packs, but they'll need plenty of rain to win this game. Even then, i'd still back the All-Blacks to win.<br>  <br>  My predictions<br>  All-Blacks 37-15<br>  <br>  If wet<br>  All-Blacks 17-12|`|mwGancPWaa	Look at the allblacks lineup: All Blacks: 15.Mils Muliaina, 14.Joe Rokocoko, 13.Conrad Smith, 12.Ma'a Nonu, 11.Sitiveni Sivivatu, 10.Daniel Carter, 9.Jimmy Cowan, 8.Rodney So'oialo, 7.Richie McCaw (capt), 6.Jerome Kaino, 5.Ali Williams, 4.Brad Thorn, 3.Neemia Tialata, 2.Keven Mealamu, 1.Tony Woodcock. <br>  Res: Corey Flynn, John Afoa, Anthony Boric, Kieran Read, Piri Weepu, Stephen Donald, Isaia Toeava. its great isnt it? well Ireland have never beaten the allblacks that will be with the allblacks but im wondering if the irish crowd will bring a irish win mabey luck? nah allblacks through and through
XHhJ8ffRaa	It may not be a bad idea since both Lee Evans and Boldin are pretty good. Especially Boldin, he is a monster when healthy.|`|9arF0TIEaa	god that is hard he isn't sucking though he just isn't doing as good as last year cause romo is stinking but if u really want to I would go with lee Evans he is really good this year I have him on my fantasy team and he is rocking for me and he is my best WR out of randy moss wes welker and hines ward ( I guess the ward thing is debatable but ya) so ya do wut u want but I wouldn't do it  |`|SQ4ud2eyaa	Hell no....wait? Anquan Boldin?!? Pick up Boldin right now.!
dfeb00a8727feb0b038ed889d65e5c7aaa	Lloyd...<br>  <br>  Holmes is coming back and Washington will be back to the #3 WR...|`|9arF0TIEaa	definatly brandon loyd he is just over all better then Nate he has a better qb also so ya I would start brandon insted good luke man|`|t43ZhzjNaa	Its tough to say because you got Lloyd who hasn't played in his last three games and then you got Washington who has a td in each of his last 3 games. But, Santonio Holmes is coming back who will take the 2 sopt on the team while Lloyd is back fresh and ready to go as the lead reciever of the Bears. It's a tough call but I'd favor Washington. While you got Holmes coming back, I don't think Big Ben will forget about Washington. Washington will have a solid week, and you have to wonder how Lloyd will bounce back after that long rest off? Washington has 3 tds Lloyd just 1 td. You could also make the argument for Lloyd for the sole reason of him being the primary target for the Bears. It's a tough call, but go with your gut decision.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  
U684YBEzaa	idk.....but DUDE...GET A LIFE|`|D7x9GQoDaa	It would bleed blood from the skin and milk from the udder sack if milk were present.<br>  <br>  They milk them all year through artificial insemination. Just like humans, cows don't produce milk unless they are pregnant. <br>  Learn something new everyday huh?|`|bqmLWTfYaa	If the cow is not in the late stages of pregnancy or has a calf it will not have milk. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>   Also,  you are a moron|`|CuyKW1TAaa	If it were producing milk it would let the milk out but your going to get blood too and hurt the cow.

There is a chance you will kill the animal and likely to ruin it for milk production.<br>  <br>  Why would you want to do this. I think it would likely be a felony for animal cruelty or at least destroying the farmers livestock.<br>  <br>  First try shooting yourself in the nads or vaginal area.|`|SBBnWsJJaa	Milk and blood will come out of the UDDER.<br>  <br>  BTW - this is illegal.|`|xboDUtI2aa	No, it will BLEED blood.

Zg0kIoxGaa	Baltimore is starting to open up their passing game. They are beginning to trust Flacco's arm and with Mason and Clayton's great hands, I'd start him.  Also, Rice has filled in well for an injured mcgahee and houston will try to stop the run first which will open up one on one coverage. Favre is just too inconsistant. You dont' want him to drop a huge egg when you are in a close match.|`|JVkKdVuMaa	i like Favre this weekend because he plays a st, louis D that is pretty weak.  He also has more experience and even though he hasnt been producing lately,  i think he will against the rams.  Flacco will play against houston on sunday and most likely wont do much eben though houston's D is bad too.  Start Favre.|`|oGbrlN9kaa	Farve has sucked ever since that 6 TD game whereas Flacco has steadilly improved.  Go with Flacco.|`|dfeb00a8727feb0b038ed889d65e5c7aaa	Toughy...But I'll say Flacco.<br>  <br>  Other than the 6 TD party he had against Arizona, Favre has been a dud lately.  Flacco will get you passing yards and rushing yards as well as TDs in any other way possible.<br>  <br>  Go with Flacco.|`|dywILy7oaa	FAVRE.... he has better WR's to throw to and he is playing the Rams. Flacco is playing Houston which has a better defense than the Rams. I would go with Favre
