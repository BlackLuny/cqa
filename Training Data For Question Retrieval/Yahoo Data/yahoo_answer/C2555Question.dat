20090218111821AARReWE	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Car Ignition problems???	I got a alarm and automatic starter put in my car last year. I put my car in storage in september and disconnected the battery, I tried starting my car with my key and it would not work. Then I tried my Automatic starter from my alarm and my car starter, but I have no reaction from the car with my key. Any ideas on the cause? It worked perfect before I disconnected the battery. Oh yeah also the old alarm system was a ignition disable system that was disconnected with the new alarm.         Thanks for the help
20090219184814AAx7XJw	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	The "service engine soon" light keeps coming on....?	2 months ago I got a 70,000 mile service at the dealer. Then 2 weeks later the "service engine soon" light came back on. I took it to the dealer and they just said it was a "false code" or something, and that nothing was wrong. Then it came on yesterday and I took it back today. They said nothing was wrong, not even with the sensor.      I always figure that the dealer is the least honest and that even if the smallest thing is wrong they will try to get me to fix it. But they keep saying nothing is wrong.      Any ideas?

Thinking on getting an agent to buy a Land Rover Sport for me here. It'd be an 06 model. He'd charge 800-1000 for getting it at that rock bottom auction price. I would hope the car is coming off a lease and is not being sold for any other reason. A car off lease is being given up by prior arrangement and not because of another reason like a problem with the car. Thanks!

20090219232047AAQashD	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Other - Car Makes	Does GM lack quality in it's cars and is that possibly part of the reason its going under.?	We bought a CadillacEscalade fully loaded almost $90,000 truck, in less than a year the chrome strip on the side fell off because it wasnt glued on correctly, the escalade its loosing its sheen, the roof is sagging in the rear, the tire pressure montoring system broke and the flat tire light wont turn off, etc. While meanwhile our Mercedes-Benz C-Class (the entry level) car has been free from such defects. Im just curious to hear what people think about this and hear if other GM owners have had similar problems.

20060627073253AAlBXSs	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	1999 Chrysler LHS Won't Start?	When I try to start my LHS I get a clicking sound from under the hood. If I turn it a few times it used to start right up eventually. But now I can't get it to turn over at all. I don't think it's the battery, because when it did start it didn't sound like it was straining. And I don't think it's the starter, because when it did start it started up immediately. There wasn't any grinding or any strange noises like that. I just bought the car about 6 months ago, and I hate to have to take it to a mechanic. Cha-ching, if you know what I mean. Any suggestions will be appreciated. Thanks in advance.   -DKline00

The thing is I thought if it was the head gasket it would start smoking.

20070710054925AA6xfzb	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Rear bumper repair on ford mustang?	My son had a "paint transfer" accident in a parking lot with a parked car as he was parking his car.  He hit the rear bumper of a Ford Mustang (appears to be a new model but don't know the year).  Pissed me off because the chick who owns the Mustang accused him (when she called the police) of trying to flee the scene.  Because it happened on private property, they didn't cite my son, but we do have to handle the repairs.  It's a vinyl bumper.  Question one is:  Will the bumper damage (again, no dents, just paint transfer) buff out?  Question two is, if so, how much should I expect that to cost?  Question three is,if it won't, how much for a new bumper?

20081007200857AAOnTh4	Cars & Transportation;Boats & Boating	Mr. Boatee, a pleasure-boat retailer, entered into a signed written contract with Mr. Boater to sell Boater a ?	powerboat for $12,000. The manufacturer’s price of the boat delivered to Boatee was $9,500. As the contract provided, Boater paid Boatee $4,000 in advance and promised to pay the full balance upon delivery of the boat. The contract contained no provision for liquidated damages. Before the delivery date Boater notified Boatee that because of financial difficulties he could not buy the boat. Thereafter Boatee sold that boat to Mr. Sail for $12,000. Can Boater sue for restitution of the $4,000 that he had paid? Discuss the arguments and the likely outcome.

Recently, on a whim I bought a little 4 seater team picton speedboat with a Johnston 60hp outboard, looks quite a nice wee thing but the hull is heavily stained, I think it is because it sat in Loch Ness for such a long time.   What would be the best cleaning product to bring the hull back to the original colour without causing damage?      So far I have tried mer car polish on a small area but it would not shift and also some kitchen surface cleaner which contained a little bleach, also to no avail. I am reluctant to continue experimenting due to not having a bloody clue as to the best stuff for this application.      Thanks in advance.
20081027053811AAzzP43	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Whats wrong with my van?? heads or gaskets?	i have a 98 voyager van v 6 3.0 and it overheated. the thermostat sensor made the fan not kick on. and then there was water and white smoke coming out of the tail pipe. not a little, it was alot. there was also pressure bubbles in the radiator. there was no water in the oil at all. the van sounded perfect. no missing no nothing. after we got the fan working it was perfect except the white smoke and water/coolant in the tail pipe and the bubbles in the radiator. so i had a mechanic come over and he changed the head gaskets. there was evidence of burnt coolant where the gaskets were on all six cylinders and the valves not just one. he said that was odd because there was not water in the head itself. the mechanic said normally it would be clear where water had gotten into the head and that it would have been washed clean by the hot water pushing through but it was covered in oil and there was no water at all inside. he was confused because it didn't explain the tail pipe situation. there was no evidence on the head that it had been cracked. the block looked fine too.but he couldn't promise it wasn't cracked without sending it to the machine shop. keep in mind the head had no water what so ever in it. so we decided maybe we couldn't see the leak in the gaskets and went ahead and put the new gaskets back on and put it all back together. well nothing changed, there was still pressure in the radiator and coolant still in the tailpipe. i don't know..... neither did he... we are going to change the whole heads next. should i. am i missing something? have you ever heard of something like this. this is getting expensive and i cant afford to make another mistake. please help. the mechanic is going to think on it but he said this is a first for him and he owns a shop. so no water in the oil no water in the heads but evidence of residue on the gasket on all six cylinders and all six valves. white smoke and water in tail pipe . air pressure getting into the radiator. all the while the van sounds great. what is the deal......          * 8 hours ago       * - 3 days left to answer.      Additional Details      8 hours ago   we replaced all the gaskets in the kit. including the exhaust manifold gasket... and no he did not use new bolts. are you always suppose to. will i defiantly have to buy a new gasket kit again. or can i re use that one since we barely put it on. why would i not be able to? i need to know so i dont get screwed...      8 hours ago   and intake manifold gaskets were changed too.      7 hours ago   yes this is a nice vehicle and i need it. i cant afford another one and i have 4 kids i need a big car. i am hoping that i can find a good used head, for cheap and the labor isnt to bad so i think i shoud fix this car instead of getting into a note that i cant pay right now. you have been very helpful. do you know where i can get a used head at a good price? online maybe. its a plymoth voyager v6 3.0 1998 thanks so much      7 hours ago   question??? if the head is bad is it common for both heads to have the coolant residue around all six cylinders. or does just one go out at a time. would one cracked head effect the other. do i need to replace both. it would cost as much to send off as it would to replace one, or i can just buy two new ones. is it worth the extra money to buy new one instead of sending it off?

20090220022845AA0pLuv	Cars & Transportation;Safety	Is this a good driving courtesy when I'm on the road driving or is too dangerous?	When I drive sometimes I slow down or stop to let a car on the other side of the road cross onto my side of the road to complete their left hand turn.  I do it as a courtesy when I know I have there is a long line of cars behind me so that driver doesn’t have to sit there forever waiting to make his turn.  And also, when I let someone through, technically I help keep traffic running smoothly on the other side of the road. Me stopping for 2 seconds is better than a car on the other side of the road sitting there for 2 minutes holding up traffic behind him.  I refrain from doing this when I know it might cause cars behind me to rear end each other because my stop could "unexpected" to the cars behind me. However, I only do this as a courtesy because I know what its like to be stuck waiting to cross onto the other side of the road to turn left. I’m wondering if I’m doing the right thing or if I should stop doing this altogether if it might too dangerous. Some cars behind me might not expect me to slow down or stop, but It’s no different than me slowing down or stopping for a car that is front of me that wants to turn…which the cars behind me might not know there is a car in front of me that's going to be holding up traffic, therefore I don’t’ think it’s a problem of what I’m doing, but I’m wondering what u all think about it.

He also has a provisional British license (I'm not sure why he has both).       The other day the police stopped us for no apparent reason and basically they told him to leave the car and apply for a British replacement to his Greek license and if they saw him driving later they would arrest him.    They said the problem stemmed from him having a provisional British license as well as a Greek one. They are both in date, so are both valid. And you ARE allowed to use any EU license in the EU so it's not because it's a Greek license.      He phoned the DVLA the next day and they are basically saying that he is OK to drive. He has sent off to get a British license now just to avoid problems, but what is the deal exactly? Does anyone know?

20090220010621AAJwxrY	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Best way to secure a loose/broken front bumper until I can get it fixed?	I got in a minor car accident and the front bumper is coming off.  It's kind of connected to this plastic piece on the front of the car.  It's driveable, but I need to mke a 3 hour trip soon and I need to secure it better before I can do that.      I have heard duct tape is a bad idea because it will mess up the paint and leave residue thats impossible to get off - in your experience, is this true?      I also thought of bungees or tying it in some way but I don't know how this would work..any ideas?      thank you!
