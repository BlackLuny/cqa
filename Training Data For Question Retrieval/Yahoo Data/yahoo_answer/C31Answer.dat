They are obviously products of higher breeding that can't be bothered with mere mortal duties. You should be grateful to contribute to their wealth. How dare you question their morality and ethics!!! Now, shut up and drink the Kool-Aid!!    Real answer: They're hypocrites.

QlrIUIfOaa	Matthews would float like a butterfly and sting like a bee.  Limpbrain would waddle and, if he tried to fight back, would suffer a massive (like his girth) coronary.|`|4zO1Yvjsaa	Rush.    Chris would just feel thrills up his leg the whole time.|`|MKrNZMVDaa	Fist fight?   Mmmm ... it would never happen ... but I'd love to see a real debate!   In a word fight they'd be like the 'Two cats of Kilkenny' ...  They fought and they fit and they scratched and they bit and except for their nails and the tips of their tails instead of two cats there weren't any.  And good riddance to both of them too!|`|3TjiJls7aa	Hard to say, both are pretty out of shape.  But Rush is in poor physical health all around, so probably Chris...with one big "Ha!"|`|8EbJJ0zZaa	Matthews....he's quicker...|`|0d6d73c79e6856ec69bb6c658154c1ccaa	Rush because libs are into appeasement rather than fighting for anything|`|spuz7DvNaa	It would be a difficult fight with Matthews always trying to get to Limbaugh's back. Matthews is after all the guy that tingles up his leg when looking at a man.|`|G49lKR56aa	You dems sure are violent people!|`|QDFj9JPfaa	...Rush wouldn't need to fight with anyone... He commands an Army of Millions !  (don't piss off the Commander and Chief, in exile)|`|vOYyFqxRaa	Well in a battle of witts Rush is handicapped. But then to make up for this he would lie and fight dirty and in the end their would be no winners only one big fat whiner.|`|hMLmrPbgaa	Chris Matthews isn't fit to wipe Rush Limbaugh's pilonidal cyst.|`|YpjYmxcIaa	What would they do beat each other with a chicken wing?|`|BpcgaJd4aa	Limbaugh. Chris Matthews would run for the hills.|`|4TkzoZThaa	Rush.  He can't feel pain due to the oxys and Chris Matthews was a journalism major.|`|seeRRQkraa	Rush Limpdick would demand a contract where they both got oiled up and rolled around in mud.    He's a pervert, you know. Can you say, "Dominican Republic vacation?"|`|jzedZUhaaa	Tough question.  Both are Nam draft dodging mommas boys.  It could be a lot of hair pulling and posturing but not many blows landed.|`|k1jwNKbgaa	At first I would say Matthews, because he would fight dirty.    But then after thinking about Chris' tingling leg.......    I think he would purposely, barely put up a fight, just to have a big man on top of him.|`|AA11496527	If it was cage fighting I suspect the first five minute round would go to Matthews, in that he would be far superior in grappling.    In the boxing ring (the sweet science) Limbaugh would have the advantage as their is a rule called "general ring-man-ship". Limbaugh would dance and jab until the 12 round rendering Matthews the loser.    Wrestling would be a whole other story. Limbaugh or Matthews jumping from the ropes would probably kill them.|`|OlcC4hwcaa	rush would win with his spatial powers, after all he is the CON MESSIAH|`|AA12191521	Surprisingly, I'd have to guess Matthews. He actually used to be a police officer. So I bet he has at least some hand to hand combat training. Whether he remembers how to use it is a different story. Rush has a size and strength advantage, but I don't know if he has any training at all. In just the will to fight I think Rush is a bit more combative and will not punk out. Matthews generally seems a bit cowardly to me. But its all speculation. And everything changes when the first punch is thrown.    Kieth Olberman is a psychotic liberal attack dog and a physical giant. His extreme liberalism and blind hatred for all conservatives would propel him into a rabid killing frenzy. Rush would stand no chance in that fight. But Olberman would have to be shot to protect the public from his psychotic rampage. Come to think of it we should just put him down pre-emptively.|`|Souvww0maa	Matthews is a Journalist?  When will he actually commit "Journalism".  All he is capable of is political whoring.  No objectivity, not a journalist.    Limbaugh would win hands down.  All he would have to do is show Matthews his contract and tell him how many more listeners he has compared to people who watch hardball.  Matthews would then cry himself to death.|`|35ZJauLkaa	Chris Matthews would pee his pants
AA11268819	That's an understatement!|`|BpcgaJd4aa	That's one of many examples.|`|rF1fpyenaa	what are you talking about?  do you even live in America?  have you not seen what republicans did to the US economy within the last 8 years?|`|Ov65rYIAaa	Oh yeah... it's like that time when Mark Foley spent all that time pushing for legislation to protect children, while the whole time he was touching little boys? Like that, right?|`|bbb27cdfa4d31a5dc4086e1215fa4577aa	Everyone has their opinion but as I recall the Republicans are the ones that got us into this mess.  Everyone who voted for George Bush is at fault for what happened to the economy.  Especially the ones who voted for him after he started the war in Iraq.

ad3ORARNaa	The United States Government is a Republic which means that the voters vote for whom they wish to represent them in Washington.  They vote for Senators and Congressmen making up the Legislative branch.  The people vote not for president but for the electoral college which picks the president.  Legally the electoral college can vote for whomever they choose.  The person they chose becomes president.  That is the Executive branch.  The third branch is Judicial.  I could go into more detail but it would be easier for you to read the Constitution and the Federalist Papers.|`|PG7WfGpHaa	An oligarchy.|`|0ZnX6Qjyaa	they are sort of like a legal Mafia, they take our money and if we don't pay up instead of breaking our legs they throw us in jail|`|dj00wdjKaa	A federal presidential democracy, since the head of the executive is the president, also head of State. If he were a prime minister it would be a parliamentary democracy. Federal because it's made up of self-governing states that are united by a central government.     Lawrence, note that democracy means the right to vote, while republic means that it is not led my monarchy. Take People's Republic of China for example. They are a republic because there is no Emperor anymore, but people there don't vote. But it's true, USA is a republic - a democratic one with an indirect voting system.     Cheers ~

And like 9/11, when warned of impending doom, did NADA!    Obama is president. Republicans are so bipartisan they don't want to do a thing to help people out who have lost their jobs, their income, their homes and their dignity!

The states have been threatening to hold a constitutional convention (of the type not seen since our constitution itself was created).  Such an event would essentially be a no confidence vote in our government, even our system of government itself.  With the states co-opting all congressional, presidential and supreme court authority and rewriting our constitution as they see fit.  The number one issue they want to bring up is balanced budget....to force congress to spend within its means.  Such an act would essentially shut down government spending for a long time.    How close is it to that?  We are two states away from such a convention being called.

0s09peMQaa	My 'sediments' exactly. She would be a functional president even if you don't like her.|`|EenbVs8Oaa	Yes.  Because you can disagree with her positions without being called a racist.    On top of that, her motives are far less guided by socialistic tenants.|`|m1HVh5YUaa	No, she is just a lukewarm version of the same. Personally, I prefer the extreme atmosphere that is happening. The government for decades has been building itself up, all the while destroying America piece by piece. Obama just comes out and says "spread the wealth" and instead of praising the Bill of Rights, he just says in response to 2nd Amendment questions, "Just because you have the right doesn't mean that the government can't regulate it," and he just came right out and said, "government is good".     Malcolm X said an honest man, no matter how wrong is best, because you know where they stand. He even preferred Goldwater over the other schmos pretending to be a "sheep" which was a big no-no at the time. I have to agree with him on that. Hilary would have talked "double-speak" out of both sides of her mouth and people would have just gone back to their denial, like they did with Bush and his "compassionate conservatism" domestic policy, all the while government power grew as did the debt.    I prefer the wolves not pretending to be the sheep.|`|54a8e0354bc847720c2fa2bf164d4cc3aa	no    I like Obama|`|YonedWiEaa	yes ,,,,bill is a much prettier first lady....|`|oVmGcRVtaa	N O.|`|I8M5kw5Saa	i think calling her an ugly name is uncalled for and yes that is who I wanted to win and just because she didn't have enough money to buy her the white house then the man that did is there now.|`|zEVpA4WCaa	NO WAY !

AA11163314	Nobody automatically gets a security clearance.  Clearances are based on need.  If you are looking at a job that requires a clearance then the clearance process will be begun after your clear MEPS.    The granting (or denial) of a security clearance is based on the 'whole person' concept.  In granting a clearance the adjudicator is going to try to predict your _future_ behavior based on what the investigation discovers about your past.    Excessive debt is something an adjudicator is going to look at but the biggest killer will be evidence of financial mismanagement.  For example - you you are a recent college graduate with $60,000 in student loans they will not be too concerned.  If you have $1,000 in credit card debt but a history of late and missing payments then this will be of greater concern.    One thing to remember about applying for a security clearance:    Tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.  Do not attempt to hide something because they _will_ find out.  At that point they will question whether or not you can be trusted at all.|`|9XAqnmOQaa	Security clearances are granted only to those who need them after you finish basic.    Debt may impact on your ability to pass a clearance background check.|`|AtXoQlY3aa	You will not have a Security Clearance at that time, but one has already been started on you.   Debt can be used against your security clearance, but the most important thing is DON'T EVERY LIE ON A SECURITY APPLICATION! They will find out, and it stops.       Good Luck.|`|rYNM67oyaa	The recruiter would have already told you if you have too much debt probably. They look at what your debt to income ratio will be. If you can afford your payments it won't be a problem. As a lower rank you won't be making a lot of money so they won't let you come into the service if it looks like you can't pay it. The issue for security clearances is if you have so much debt you'd be liable to being bribed for classified information if you had access. You won't have a security clearance yet when you go to swear in. You may need one for AIT and in that case they'll grant a temporary one.|`|WpxhXXKMaa	The MOS that you chose will determine if you need a security clearance or not. Certain MOS don't require a clearance and others only require a secret. By the time you get to AIT, you should at least have an Interim Clearance. This allows you to go through the training required in AIT. Before you graduate and receive your certificate your clearance must be completed before you are shipped to your duty station. Somethings that can hold up you getting your clearance are huge amounts of debt, arrest warrants, non US citizenship, etc. You won't necessarily get denied for debt, sometimes it depends on how much debt you have and if you can make enough suitable payments that the CCF will accept. The CCF does a thorough check of all clearance applicants which takes awhile, which is why they start it while you are in Basic Training. If you are denied the clearance required for your MOS, they will let you chose another MOS that doesn't require a clearance and you have to go through that AIT!|`|pr5TKgtCaa	don't understand what you're applying for? can you elaborate?|`|XrwCJJleaa	I asked this same question to my cousin who was a ranger. He said security clearance is affected by debt, past drug use, and arrests.

UTP1UBIRaa	Different states have different statutory rape laws.  In Oklahoma there has to be a four year difference in order to qualify as statutory rape.  I do not know where you are or what the laws are there.  A lawyer should be able to assist.  If the father did not sign the birth certificate there is nothing to dispute unless he petitions the court for a paternity test.  Your friend she seek legal advice.  There are many lawyers available at different prices.|`|AdIrjmV7aa	The baby should become a ward of the court.  In my mind she is an unfit mother and should be arrested for rape of an underage child.|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	He should get full custody, for what she did to him.  She should be charged with:    1. Contributing To The Delinquency Of A Minor  2. Statutory Rape  3. Aggravated Rape|`|AA12103453	Well we'd need to know the age of the Father, the State(so you'd know the age of consent). If she goes to Court and they find out who the father is then depending on his age she may get busted on Statutory Rape when they show that he really is the father so she really had sex with him.|`|lU8e0VQFaa	Tell her not to put any name down the the birth certificate or unknown for the father. Then if the father decides he wants rights to the baby he'll have to fight for them and prove he's the father. However, by doing this she's looses her ability to get child support (unless she fights him for it but again would need to prove it and that would give him parental rights).|`|V4BaRBtnaa	At 18, your friend has reached the age of consent, and is legally considered an adult. She should already have full custody. She is lucky that she has not been charged with unlawful sex with a minor.
H7SQEM4Daa	How many days you miss depends on the case. The last time I had jury duty,the case was expected to last two days. I didn't get picked as a juror,but that was the time they stated for the case.  If you are a full time student,you can probably get excused. Send your paper back and state that missing school would cause you a hardship. Do the same if they call you again in the summer. As long as you are a student,they should honor your excuse.

Just as he's about to start a ceremony on the jetty next to where HMS Ark Royal was berthed, the Chief Yeoman onboard orders the Communications rating up on the signal deck to hoist the Chinese National flag up the mainmast. It's a standard mark of respect to foreign dignitaries and when you are sailing inside another nation's territorial waters.     Anyway, up goes the flag. No problem, you'd think. Until the Admiral mutters something to an aide, who looks up, gasps, then mutters a frantic volley to the translator.    It's not the Chinese flag. It's the Taiwanese flag. Cue one rapid radio call up to the signal deck along the lines of 'get that f*cking flag down now!'    See, the problem there was not wilful disobedience. The problem there was the fact that the names of countries are printed along the edge of the flag so you can tell what they are without unfurling them completely. So, when the Chief had gone to the flag store onboard to find a Chinese flag, he'd checked that. The flag definitely said Republic of China, and it's red. And that's exactly what he told the Captain just as he was about to get new orifices ripped for him.    Except the flag for China says PR China.... Peoples Republic of China. The Republic of China, however, is a large offshore island more commonly known as Taiwan.    Judy's Rabbit... what the hell are you on about? Oh, wait, you're a rabbit... stick to eating lettuce next time. For your fevered information, that flag is mixture of the Scottish Cross of St Andrew, the English Cross of St George, and the Northern Irish Cross of (I presume) St Patrick. Relationship to the Swastika, which is originally a Hindu symbol and more recently reversed and bastardized by the Nazis, precisely zero. It's younger than the Hindu symbol and older than the Nazi version, so f*ck knows where you get your 'Zionazi' nonsense out of.    Ray... you've said before  you used to live in the UK... so how come you don't know the difference between the Union flag and the Cross of St George?

Z5U5uYv0aa	Yes, most likely they will. Once you are married, your property, wages, and debts = his property, wages, and debts, and vice versa. Before you get married, you should both insure that you have no outstanding debt. Especially if that debt can get one of you thrown in jail. (Nowadays, they throw deadbeat dads behind bars, and rightly so.)    But I do have a question for you. Why would you want to marry someone so irresponsible that he is unwilling to support his own children? Does he not love them? Does he not realize that he is cheating them out of a better life? Is he so selfish that he does not care about his own kids? You may love him now, but eventually a man who can treat his own flesh and blood that way will show you his true nature. You may want to wait even longer, even after he has cleared up his debts, before you marry someone who is that uncaring and selfish towards his children. Perhaps you are currently blinded by rose colored glasses, unable to see the bad as so many people are when they first fall in love, but do try to take them off. It will save you time, money, sanity, and heartache in the long run.    I wish you much luck and hope that you do find happiness.|`|AA11206283	Nope. His tab, his issue.

However, his child support is his responsibility and not any way connected to you; except if he don't pay and is found in contempt for not following court orders.  You might want to help him pay so he doesn't have to go to jail.    Alimony is the only support that is effected by marriage.

The start of this business came from the subprime loan market crashing in 2007.    Politicians do these short-sighted measures to gain them popularity and re-electability in the short term.  Few looked at the long-term benefits and it has come back to bite us.

8cLV2OPYaa	Wow, there sure are a lot of silly answers to this question. Shows how few people really understand global politics and strategy. Let me see if I can clear several matters up for you.<br>  <br>  First of all China will not participate in a World War 3 unless they are directly attacked. The limit of China's involvement in any war would very likely be to attempt to swerve the war one way or the other by proxy. For instance, sending weapons or aid to N. Korea. China's rather fragile economy relies rather heavily on consumption by America and many other places in the western world. Trust me they are not waiting in line to smack the horse that feeds them. It is their ability to profit from imports sent to the west that keeps them from being in complete poverty. People seem to either forget that, or never bothered to make the attempt to understand that when attempting to measure any possible "threat" from China.<br>  <br>  Russia also is not exactly waiting in line to cut off it's income stream. Russia has an economy now that is significantly dependent on the sale of oil, primarily to Europe. Now I am not saying that Russia wouldn't attack if they felt threatened. I am sure they would, and rather quickly I might add. I am just saying that unless the west attempts to "close in" on Russia's traditional sphere of influence they are far more likely to act like China, and be content to feed participants of the "world war" with aid and equipment from a safe distance, so as to not disturb or destroy their economic stability any more than it already is.<br>  <br>  A world war might more likely look like this:<br>  <br>  Israel pre-emptively strikes one of Iran's nuclear facilities, who in turn decides to counter-attack Israel with missiles and aircraft bombing raids. America is drawn into the conflict by alliance obligations to Israel. England supports America's move but in a somewhat muted role, while N. Korea offers assistance to Iran in an attempt to strengthen it's position in the conflict. I am not sure if this cooperation would actually happen, only that N. Korea and Iran both stand to gain from cooperation, in that, N. Korea clearly has nuclear weapons technology, and Iran clearly has money. It would make strategic sense for some type of cooperation to ensue there.<br>  <br>  Palestinian resistance groups and other groups out of Lebanon would act as "hired mercenaries" for Iran, which would drag other countries in the middle east into the conflict in unclear ways. I believe that moderate Arab nations would try to stay neutral for as long as they could, however, it is unclear how domestic opinion might change the positions of some of those countries.<br>  <br>  Regardless of the finer details, the most likely scenario for at least the "beginning" of WW 3 combat, would arise from the middle east, and almost assuredly involve Israel. It would inevitably end up being the famed "war of civilizations" that many people have predicted and wrote about. This war has been brewing for many centuries and positioning right now is optimal for something to spark the conflict.<br>  <br>  If the US ever was dragged into a middle east war that turned into a world war, you can almost bet your bottom dollar that the other big players on the field would do the best they could to stay out of it, in their own interest of using the opportunity to profit from the expense and failings of the other nations involved, particularly the US. Nations like China, Russia, and probably India would likely remain outside the main sphere of influence of the conflict, and if they did participate, it would only be in a limited support role in whatever capacity serves their interest best. Believe it or not, Russia and China might actually stand to gain from assisting the US in such a war. Although I am sure that if they ever actually did assist us, they would never admit it publicly, nor would anyone likely notice the difference.<br>  <br>  The US, China, and Russia are connected in to many different ways for war between them to do anything but hurt everyone involved in many VERY expensive ways. The days of western democracy and eastern communism being at each others throats have been over for a long time. If world war was ever going to break out in that kind of capacity it would have happened in the 80's and if it ever had, the entire northern hemisphere would likely still be a smoking ruin.<br>  <br>  Hopefully this opinion proves helpful to you.|`|xzSuXnvpaa	"What will the teams be for the next world war.?" Cubs, Pirates, Reds, etc.  I'm still hoping for an eventual World Series win for the Cubbies. MLB does not use nuclear weapons.<br>  <br>  As far as football goes, I still want the Bears to take the Super Bowl. No nukes here, either.<br>  <br>  If you are asking about military conflict, nation against nation, then 'team' is the wrong word.  And nobody knows which nation will ally with which nation. But it is a near certainty that nuclear weapons will not be used.<br>  <br>  Violence in Africa appears to be on the rise, but that may only be an illusion due to increased media coverage.<br>  <br>  Russia is flexing her muscles again; could mean nothing.<br>  <br>  The Middle East is a pressure cooker waiting to 'blow'.<br>  <br>  European nations have their own problems; but they appear to be handling them.<br>  <br>  There is growing unrest on the US-Mexico border. As predicted, armed conflicts are increasing in frequency, and duration. For all intents, and purposes, there is the beginning of a civil war in Mexico.

9q3PSPIgaa	No, many are protecting their own rights in anticipation of what he wants to happen.  Check out House Resolution 45 (Blair Holt Act):<br>  <br>  (1) "Qualifying Firearms" will only be permitted to be POSSESSED by LICENSED importers, manufacturers, dealer or collectors - meaning, if you are just an ordinary citizen you have to be a "collector" or you have effectively been DENIED your rights under the Second Amendment.<br>  <br>  (2) A requirement on the application is a general release of ANY mental health records for the Attorney General or "authorized representative".  Does not specify what types of records.<br>  <br>  (3) The "Inspections" clause states that the Attorney General (during business hours) may enter and inspect ANY location that manufactures, stores or holds firearms--the only potential protection of citizens is the phrase "for distribution in commerce", but that is vague enough that they could get by it with little effort.<br>  <br>  So, that sound nice?

HUlyRTrraa	Wrong. It causes mental stress, anxiety & depression in the long term. It does not make everyone schizophrenic, unless the user has some sort of underlying psychotic history, but it DOES cause long term users depression. 100%    Edit. Andrew/Val. Not worse . Cigarettes do not give you mental health issues and take your life away slowly, in hours, weeks, months, years. All smoking is bad but cigarettes are. not worse than weed combined with tobacco.|`|HsrCk2J1aa	Marijuana is illegal and bad for your health and life.|`|2f6d591b87634e2c1909160eb45e94a1aa	A) it is spelled Wrong dear, not rong.  Use the spellchecker, I do. I have to. Without the spellchecker my writing would make everyone think I was a drunken dyslexic who only spoke Hindi and was using a bad translation program.  You don't want people thinking you are stupid or lazy, so don't post writings that imply that you are.    B) Re Marijuana. The biggest argument pro-legalization people like to use is "Look alcohol is legal! Pot isn't any worse than alcohol."  Well maybe it is, and maybe it isn't (there is data both ways).  But let's concede that point.    Look at all the problems alcohol causes in our society. Look at the ruined lives and careers,and  marriages from alcoholism. Look at what happens to the children of alcoholics (abuse, both physical and mental, and neglect.)  Look at the cost of accidents related to alcohol. Not just DWI, but work accidents and boating accidents, and people who have a few beers while they are out hunting and have an accidental shooting. Heck what about the "OMG! I slept with HIM?!?!" that are caused by alcohol, and the sexually transmitted diseases, etc.  (How many people do you think got AIDS when they were sober?)    The point is, we can't eliminate alcohol from our society. (We tried, it was called Prohibition, it failed.)     So we are stuck with alcohol and all the problems it brings...but with all the problems alcohol causes in our society...why on Earth would we want to legalize ANOTHER drug that was just as bad??|`|yPkZX6x7aa	I think cigarettes should be illegal.

Zed- LOL it causes depression 100%? must have got a few bad bags...it might have made you go mental but it doesn't mean it will for everyone...    Adam L- everything you listed, booze does the same thing and is 100% legal...|`|Q8fcepcZaa	i think it's totally wrong that it is illegal. its a plant provided by nature for us to enjoy, so what gives some government the right to stop us from enjoying something sensibly?  I am very aware that it is harmful, but so is alcohol, tobacco, mcdonald's, car exhaust fumes, and so on. everything is bad for you but life is about moderation in everything we do.    I'm also sure if people started picking up grass from the ground and smoking it, it wouldn't be banned because, although it would be harmful, it wouldn't get you high.      PS. larry r makes the point about alcohol ruining lives, and it is a good one, but, that is the minority of people who use it. the majority of us can enjoy booze without all the $hit that goes with abuse, so why should the stupidity of the few spoil the fun for the masses?  Also, i dont think cannabis is as destructive as alcohol in that sense, it does not impair judgment or inhibitions, it doesn't make people violent or sick. If i had to choose between alcohol or cannabis being legal i'd probably choose cannabis. are you more worried about being attacked by a drunk or a stoner?|`|HRNll2bfaa	Wrong people use it and always will so legalize it and tax it to help this economy and help us with homeland  ssecurity if marijuana was taken off the drug list we would not import any and then we could get rid of all the illegal importation of it and could focus more on the heroin that the taliban is getting in along with cocaine and other illegal drugs like the meth coming in from Mexico that is so cheap but costs us billions in social problems like medical and law enforcement alchohol is more dangerous than marijuana but you can go anywhere drink a few drinks and then get in a car who hasn't done that it is very dangerous but accepted for the most part everyone says people would show up to work stoned haha well no that would not be right do you show up drunk no you do not how are cigarettes legal when they are addictive and will kill you but marijuana no one has ever died from using it and it is not physically addictive but has medical benefits far outweighing the harmful addictive drugs like xanax that is readily available everywhere in this coukntry because it is pharmaceutical lobbying along with lobbyists for smokes and alchohol that keep marijuana illegal everyone knows pot is good and is not nearly a problem like it is made out to be if it wasnt everywhere and so readily available so that millions of Americans could not get it and easily for most it would be more of a discussion but unfortunately by it being illegal it costs us tons of money and problems socially that could be fixed otherwise unfortunately we are in the mess we are right now Clinton agreed recently that it should be legal many in congress agree but are afraid to bring the fight to the floor. These are ******* that is not what our country is all about we should fight to change unjust practices by our government look into the recent government official that is not worried about reelection after being in congress for well over 20 years now feels he can speak up and say the truth because we all know it is time to change the law we could really use the money in taxes right now also tourism and our economy would flourish with a black president and legal marijuana we would really be a country the world could look up to oh yeah and by the way I do not even smoke marijuana I just do not care for it but I do not drink either and whether you like or dislike something does not mean it is right or wrong
i7oHTo9haa	Hi.  I happen to like this question it wasn't me and I think these questions are important.  It was probably some extremists that did it or someone from the West appeasing them.  I have signed the petition already and I think it's an important topic.<br>  <br>   I say let the show go on and I approve freedom of speech. I like it because it "outs" who is the extremist and who is the peaceful person so we can deal with them more effectively.<br>  <br>  I like protests but ONLY peaceful protest. The moment it turns violent or unruly or chaotic, that thoroughly repulses me. That is what civilized peoples and societies do, people get to object.  Just because we voice our opinion, does not make it bad.  It is how the opinion is expressed.  So, I will express my opinion on this Seven Children play:<br>  <br>  Dear Britain:<br>  <br>  I happen to think there is double standard. One can't show a Fitna film about Muslims but one can show an antisemitic play about Jews? What's up with that?<br>  <br>  The threat of violence from 10,000 extremist British Muslims quieted Wilders' Fitna showing in Britain<br>  <br>  So what do Jews do? We write a letter and sign it and make people think about their actions and the show goes on.<br>  <br>  Britain, I'm trying really hard to not give up on our allies here. I keep telling myself that America and Britain are sisters thru thick and thin we have such a deep history together. We're currently fighting an Afganistan terror campaign, so what's up with the internal issues? I shake my head when I remember another matter that Jewish peaceful protests get blocked off from society because the Muslims there will go crazy about it and start a ruckus (understatement,) hence nullifying the point of a public protest by Jews, it is no longer public but private the Muslims silenced our voice. And, while the protest is going on the Muslims shoot rockets anyways and the police are totally nonchalant about it. So what gives?<br>  <br>  FFS, please let the Fitna guy into Britain and let both the shows go on. If anyone acts up then arrest them and handle the extremists before the situation gets worse. Do not push the problem under the rug. The threat of 10,000 Muslims silenced Britain and Geert Wilders but Britain has what, 1-2 mil Muslims now? Europe has 55million Muslims what will happen next when they don't like something else, what will they do and what will you do? Are they going to do a burning riot in London like they did in Paris?

WlpdXEQqaa	I spent 5 1/2 years active.. it was the best decision I have ever made.  I grew up and matured quickly, made the best friends anyone could ever ask for, and was able to do things people only dream about.  If I had a choice to go back and do it again I would in a heartbeat|`|K6zkGj7Zaa	My service in the military has helped make me who I am today.<br>  <br>  It has opened doors for jobs, helped me own my house go to school and allowed me to see places regular people only dream of.<br>  <br>  It was not always great.  There were crappy times and great times.<br>  I met some of the lowest people that you could imagine, but I also met people that I would give my life for, and I know they would do the same for me.<br>  Something I will never regret.|`|W7BZcdynaa	Made me grow up , but the military is for people who need to be told what to do all the time.  If you have no direction life it helps you find some. It worked for me<br>  <br>  That being said it is not for all people, if you are independent and for free thought themilitary is not for you. The military is about conformity.<br>  <br>  "If you dance with devil, the devil changes you, you don't change the devil"|`|nfXbqCgZaa	I served during peace time, so I can't relate to what many troops are experiencing now, but my experience was mixed.  I hated the bad food, poor housing, run down city near Fort Bliss, and all the police calls, that seemed largely designed just to occupy time, but I loved the friends I made and it helped me grow up.  I am a better person because of my time in the military.<br>  <br>  However, I don't regret joining.|`|2iWwIYoLaa	Of course it was a good decision, of course there were some crappy times, but what else would you expect from a physically demanding and time consuming job?  When you start out you get told what to do and how to do it, then as you progress you get put in charge of new soldiers and tell them what to do and how to do it, and then it just grows from there.  It instills motivation and shows people what they can do with their lives.  You meet some real *******, and you also meet some totally awesome people along the way.  I recommend it to anyone who wants to do something different in their lives, and if they don't like it, serve your time and resume a regular civilian life.|`|l5O6CTzJaa	There was no decision to make.  I did not have a choice...I was forcibly removed (its called being drafted) from my civilian life and put in the Army for over 2 years.  During which time I contracted tropical illnesses, got wounded (shrapnel still in my head near my brain), saw a lot of misery and probably hurt innocent people through my actions.  I did some growing up, but I still wake up in a cold sweat at times.|`|RDgyb7W8aa	I am retired with 29 years of service and I will answer the question.  Even with service in Viet Nam, I wouldn't have traded the experience for anything.|`|k56mmj2eaa	I think mine was a good decision. it made me grow up
tNk6j437aa	I think that taking it a bit far calling a swiss army knife an offensive weapon!! was it in your pocket or did you have it out and the blade out? I think if you explain the circumstances and grovel to the best of your abilty then you will get a fine<br>  <br>  If you pulled the knife on hi mthen it's a different story totally<br>  In the light of the current anti knife drive you may be made an example of|`|HP1pToMOaa	Most probably a suspended sentence. This will affect your CRB check which will show up when you apply for teaching positions.<br>  If you have a Solicitor you need to take advice.
AA11696297	certainly hope so.  one of the stupidest things Ron Rayguns ever did was to shut down state mental health programs.  resulted in an incredible spike in the numbers of homeless on the streets of America.|`|3MM64geHaa	No. It is very expensive and there is no funding.  The mentally ill have more rights and you can't just lock them away. There are group homes and psych wards but there will never be many long term places.|`|wvY31IaNaa	I hope so, but i'm not sure
80fWQyDnaa	May be . But to make up the deficit America may attack Iran to acquire its oil reserve .|`|yU7urgLxaa	Let's start with the federal government. Not until I see the politicians in Washington vote to cut federal employee wages (across the board )  will I believe there is hope to salvage our economy. If there's a chance to return to the economic stability we once enjoyed we need to reduce the tax burden on the American people. We were once an industrial nation but now we are a nation of services. We need to start by producing the products that are important to our survival. We need to produce the food for our nation plus an export base. We no longer have the ability to be self sufficient. Our jobs have gone overseas. Our food is being imported. We are dependent on foreign countries for most of our needs. A good part of our problem is that the American people have priced themselves out of the world market with higher wages, and the I've got to have it attitude. So to answer your question wages will be cut if not by choice then by necessity.|`|QQsIPlV2aa	Yes, and more jobs lost to the Public. Instead of bailing out these banks - believe me! they are NOT broke! The Government should stop these lay offs! They should be helping THOSE businesses to keep their employees working! Those guys will be paying taxes to the Government, instead of the Government doling out unemployment checks!  The Government is paying the wrong people! They talk about creating jobs! That's a laugh! WHERE will these jobs be?  If you have 625,000 people loosing their jobs every week, multiply it by 52, that's over 32 million people out of work! And that's only for one year!  They give the unemployed 46 weeks of benefits, just enough to feed their families and little else! If YOU are or were in this situation, where would the money go? Definately NOT to pay the mortgage, so here is another Catch 22! More people loosing their homes! And what pray, do these people do on Week 47? Go on Welfare? More money coming out of the Governments pocket , or rather, OUR tax dollars! And something else, which came in the mail yesterday! The so-called RESPONSIBLE people, who have watched their money, paid their taxess, and soforth, are socked with a raise on their property! even though the value of their house has gone down! This is NOT a stimulus package at all! It's just a quick way for everyone to come crashing down to earth.  The only thing it IS creating is a WELFARE STATE!  And the rich get richer, and us poor suckers are screwed!|`|NsYIUu3caa	for a lot of people it'll be a 100% decrease in pay, for others the may get thier first job, and the majority will stay the same for now.|`|yoytdRGTaa	It's possible, and it's happened before.<br>  <br>  From my own perspective, the loss of overtime pay is starting to hit home.|`|RK6hXEJcaa	If the choice is a cut in wages or losing a job, people will take a wage cut|`|HzVE4kz1aa	wages are already being cut.|`|eFhk1HB8aa	what wages no one will be working|`|oTAPazvcaa	yep, it only makes sense.|`|jA2VJXzFaa	hopefully|`|6100f239c1abd562ada33e5323d1c871aa	Unemployment often represents a drastic and dramatic change in income.|`|3890f326e072192e79ea3f718551dfb8aa	People who keep their jobs probably won't see their real wages cut, but some may see a reduction in hours or a cut in benefits (health care, 401(k) contributions, tuition reimbursement, bonuses, etc) . <br>  <br>  Many who lose their jobs will find it difficult to find an equivalent job with the same pay.|`|EPe2p55Eaa	NO, G2 is on the ways! hee hee China and USA! oh dear, excuse me, does anyone know what happen to india ah especially we are needed for the financial crysis?<br>  <br>  CNN|`|2fGHF3RQaa	Yes, especially if we go into a depression.  For every job available there will be 500 people in line wanting it.|`|a118b8144112704be52f2ab81596333baa	No, those dollars will just be worth less.
yoytdRGTaa	Good question.<br>  <br>  The more I think about it, the less I'm sure.  My instinct is Republican, but I think it could be skewed by geographical location.<br>  <br>  Cops in general tend to key on things as either black or white, with no shades of grey (note:  this does not have anything to do with race).  They view the people they deal with as either on the right side of the law or the wrong side.  This can also describe those on the far flanks of either political party.|`|gPOoJnwtaa	Where I live, the police and firefighters are predominately Democrats.  It isn't what I "think," its how they vote.|`|4xOXiZcNaa	I have never known one that was not a REPUBLICAN.|`|Shp5riE6aa	They are kind of conservative because conservatives like striker laws, and support the war over drugs.|`|PcW8H1Asaa	AFL-CIO  what ever they tell them to vote.

That he thought the war in Iraq was a distraction from the effort in Afghanistan. And that he wanted to send more troops to Afghanistan.<br>  <br>  *Probably, as usually was the case Obama supporters didn't hear any of that*|`|b88afc0dddc3aea6958a0772f8b3c5b3aa	Actually Bush got that idea from Obama.<br>  <br>  Before Obama suggested it, Bush was staunchly against interfering with the sovereign nation of Pakistan.|`|6B3ojD2Laa	I think it's important to shoot in the right direction, unlike Bush and Cheney.  If there are Al Qaeda operatives in Pakistan, shoot them.  Iraq never attacked us though, so I don't see how Obama is expanding on Bush's policy.|`|VuaOKpYXaa	I'm all for it and, frankly, it is one of the few positive things I have seen out of this incompetent administration.  Thank God he kept Robert Gates on the job at Defense.|`|HzVE4kz1aa	He's going to take out Osama Bin Laden, he's promised this from the beginning of his campaign in what.. 2006?|`|JvXUTTqJaa	the war in afghanistan would  be done and over if we would have invaded<br>  the right country first.

Pass laws that don't allow for sub-prime lending of any kind (simply cuz sub-prime lending is a bad risk in the first place), outlaw credit cards, re-vamp the entire welfare system to require some kind of accountability or work in exchange for financial support.....<br>  <br>  And then let the dust settle for at least 2 years.<br>  <br>  The whole stimulus package, stimulus checks- they won't work. It simply won't acheive the desired result.|`|1ymL5LKlaa	Very accurate.|`|25ff3871078732b22945836ac848d623aa	hits the nail on the head|`|3v9rL5xLaa	Right on!

25Cu0kjFaa	Best time for Fort Benning is Spring. Which occurs between 1215 and 1645 on April 6th of every year. Other than that, it's either hot and muggy (with occasional end of the world thunderstorms) or bloody cold with snow and sleet (with occasional end of the world thunderstorms).<br>  <br>  Your brother needs to contact Fiance.  They always screw up bonus payments.<br>  <br>  Yes, your training will be at Fort Beginning, Home of the Infantile. If you're like me, you'll finish Infantry OSUT and be in Airborne School the next day. After that, straight into RIP. That's the best way to do it, since you're in great shape and still have the trainee mindset.<br>  <br>  Start memorizing the Ranger Creed *now*|`|ASixHKWKaa	Ah, Fort Benning! Any time is a good time to go to Benning, 13 weeks of OSUT, One Station Unit Training. <br>  <br>  Bonuses are normally paid 1/2 when you finish training and the 2nd half at the one or two year mark.|`|2iWwIYoLaa	Georgia's weather isn't bad any time of the year, as far as bonus go, you get it once you get out of training and go to your unit.  usually you get part of it then and will get it in increments each year.  A bonus is determined by your job you choose and how much the Army needs to fill it.|`|KYGGglowaa	I would like to sign up for infantry 11x or 11b...and I was told that you get your bonus money; after basic training. You'r suppose to get it in instulments...like monthly payments or something....|`|b8c928e09eefd27ea254b36a713d1566aa	its better than Paris Island S.C.|`|a4LGeeI9aa	When I went there Aug 25 2005, there really were no insects. Though I don't know what the insect situation is before August. Maybe there just naturally isn't that much insects in that area. I would hate to train with mosquitoes. <br>  <br>  As the months creeped closer to December, that's when the weather became just straight out rediculous. Friggin freezing *** cold in the morning.(you wake up at 4am) So cold you can see your breath. Then, it's super ***-steaming sweat-pouring hot during the day. And then it's back to freezing your balls off when you try to go to sleep. Didn't rain much in the 15 weeks I was there. I just remembered, it rained the entire week of FTX. FTX + rain = lots and lots of cold/hot/freezing muddy fun.<br>  <br>  That was my experience at Ft. Benning anyway, and I'm from Hawaii. The weather threw me off there.|`|oGFmotXRaa	I went through 11B school at fort benning from feb 2002-june 2002.  Towards the end it got really hot, and the weather sucked to the point where we sometimes had to rest at least 15 minutes during every hour of traininig in the shade.  I would try to go from february to june like I did because if you go any earlier than that it will be freezing cold and any later than that too hot, and especially humid down in georgia.<br>  The army is changing their whole bonus structure around starting march 1.  Make sure you check into everything with at least 3 credible sources and make sure your ship date/bonus money or anything else in your contract is in writing.  Recruiters never lie haha jk<br>  Most of the time your bonus money does not come in a lump sum.  It is given to you over a period of time and is usually taxed about 15-20%<br>  You usually get part of your bonus money upon completing AIT (not just basic) and every year after that until you fulfill your contract obligation.  Now that the economy sucks, and lots of people are out of work, retention and recruiting numbers have gone way up hence the reason for the military to start cutting back on bonuses.  Bonus money is the best when the economy is in a slump which it is not in right now.

EcuCO4LCaa	I might sound like the party pooper here but McDonald's and any other company warn employees about such incidents when they are training you. The employee went out of his normal elements to break up a fight. This was not in his job description. Make the person who shot him responsible for his medical bills and losses. You cannot legaly sue the person who is more likely to pay you first then make that person sue who is responsible. The system does not work like that. McDonald's actually has every right to fire this employee for not following procedures.<br>  <br>   If you were shot in Wal-Mart while shopping because you intervened in an argument, Would Wal-Mart me liable for your medical bills and pay while you were out of work? Maybe but I'll guarantee that you would have to fight them in court to get it. 911 is available for these kind of events and I assure you that 100% of the time they tell you not to get involved and allow the police to get there and do their job. The police are usually only 1-2 minutes away.<br>  <br>   Would you all be saying the employer should pay if it were to happen at a mom and pop small store? I doubt it. You only feel as if McDonald's should pay because they are a trillion $$ corporation.|`|TAYErNRkaa	If the Judge started a fund for him by kicking in 100 dollars, he'll do what he can for this guy. And other people will start stepping up and by the time it's all said and done, the medical bills should be manageable enough for McDonald's to repair their image, with regards to this matter, and kick in the remainder.|`|cO9lH8f6aa	Workmen Comp should pick it up, it's not McDonald's that will pay.|`|HzVE4kz1aa	A giro with garnish?  mmmmmm I'm lovin it.|`|n5Fkuxz5aa	First answer was very funny. <br>  <br>  <br>  Sounds like a good idea, and McDonald's is going to have a serious PR problem if they don't pay it. Small price to pay for potentially losing millions in sales.|`|AA12254690	your right|`|gO1iAm99aa	Work Comp is the insurance for this and McDonald's pays for that.<br>  They Work Comp would send him to the lowest biding, third world, prison, witch doctor, in a trailer (out back) if he doesn't object. Who'll then dance about with feathers, shake some rattles, paint the injured areas with bloody chicken feet, attach some leeches, give him a band aid, aspirin, and "light" duty for two days.<br>  Smart guy. He refused to go to their (Work-Comps)(cough-cough) doctor.<br>  Work Comp still has to pay (unless McDonald's fired him before he hit the floor), and for disability, physical therapy as well.<br>  Sue Workers Compensation! <br>  Need a number for a tough Irish Lawyer? He eats this "trash" for lunch, and they don't have a leg to stand on. They force everyone to buy their insurance (by law), and then they weasel.<br>  Delay/Deny/Delay/Deny/Delay/Deny/ ... you get the picture.<br>  They say don't get involved (says something about society), because they know they're liable, and work comp will either drop them, or skyrocket their rates. They probably get a good deal from work comp because of so many employees (the more the cheaper). After an incident, who knows.<br>  Perhaps if work comp agrees not to raise rates, they and McDonald's should split it. <br>  Don't let work comp get away with their useless TAX again !|`|sLEdPDkHaa	Yes McDonald's is wrong for that

Thatcher tried several times to bring back hanging - she allowed at least 3 free votes on it in the house of commons during her ten years in office and she always maintained that if the commons voted for it to be restored then she would adopt it. Thatcher was in favour of hanging for all cases of mureder I think! As it turned out the commons has always voted hanging down since it was abolished in the 1960s because all the Labour MPs, all the Liberals and even half of the Tory MPs vote against it so there's never enough support for it to be passed, and since Cameron is against hanging it won't be restored in the near future either.|`|PG7WfGpHaa	No.  She was in favour of a free vote on the matter in parliament, but it was never brought up.<br>  <br>  Margaret Thatcher was in favor of the death penalty in terrorism cases.<br>  Her husband, Dennis Thatcher was very strongly against it.<br>  <br>  -|`|fL0wHyNNaa	I don't know if she did or not, but she was the type who would have.

8cLV2OPYaa	I would pass an executive order striking down the stimulus bill permanently. I would allow any company that cannot make it's books to fail if that's what it is going to do. As it turns out most people have had to find other jobs anyways even WITH the stimulus bill, so obviously we aren't saving any jobs that are already lost any how. I do not believe that the government should give an unfair advantage to banks that agree to buy other banks with bribe money, or unions who have muscled this economy into nearly bankruptcy. I am surprised ANY union shop in America can make a profit. The government needs to stay out of economics and quit picking favorites. That goes for the right wing also by the way. <br>  <br>  Capitalism doesn't work unless you LET IT WORK. Which nobody seems to want to do. Funny we didn't have any problem at all for the first 200 or so years of our history, NOW all of a sudden we got problems. Same thing with a socialism.

In fact not too long ago Russia itself actually warned us about the evils of socialism, and what it did to them. YES ! That's right ! Mr. KGB Putin himself tried to warn us, but do you think we will listen? Do you really think Mr. Obama cares what Russia warns us about?<br>  <br>  I don't understand how anybody in this country could ever possibly, even for a second, think that ANY form of socialism is a good idea for America, unless they fully intend on being a recipient of someone else's hard work, and they know that they personally would benefit. Would you believe that some of these people have the nerve to call US capitalists greedy? It is the biggest joke in America right now. We are all just waiting for wall street to just shut it's doors permanently and move to Dubai, which I am sure would be just fine with Obama.|`|715f1626818f5d62fcf3ef5c3b86c820aa	i would cut spending and cut taxes,time will heal it,interest rates are low ,oil is low,those 2 things take money out of the economy<br>  Attention,you are very smart,you know how evil the federal reserve is|`|4zijn0cgaa	cut government by 30% and government by 40% and cut taxes by 20% and install term limits for all politicians both state and federal.

EOZsYlZkaa	Immigrating to the US is not easy. You might be eligible for the diversity lottery which awards 55,000 green cards to people from countries where there are few requests for immigration. I couldn't find out if the UK is one of those countries or not. Other than that you must have a sponsor, which means you need an employer. And even if you find one, the categories under which an employer can sponsor a foreign employee are limited. You must be highly educated (post university graduate degree, with a Master's or PhD degree in an appropriate field), or highly skilled in an area where there are no suitable candidates available in the US. The best way is to get an education and find an employer in the UK that has international offices located in the states. After a couple of years you can ask for a transfer. From what I could see from the immigration and naturalization web site of the US, filling out and filing the forms runs about $1,000.|`|K4bJgTF4aa	I am not sure how you would go by that.

You will have your return ticket and providing you have never previously been denied entry, been deported, are not a convicted felon and have sufficient cash or credit cards to prove you can support yourself until your return date you should not have a problem. This may be a situation where the least said the better, I base this opinion on many visits to the U.S as a businessman and as a tourist.

It was given as a gift to Emir Abdullah by the British.<br>  <br>  The so-called "occupied" territories of Gaza and Judea and Samaria, known as the West Bank never belonged to the so-called "Palestinians"; Israel won them in a war of self-defense from Egypt and Jordan respectively. Furthermore both countries relinquished their claims to the territories, so whose territory is Israel occupying? The answer is they are not occupied; they are rightfully part of Israel, as is the Golan Heights which Israel also won from Syria in the same war in self-defense.

In the course of the fighting, Israel captured some of the territory that 181 had allotted to the Palestinians, and Jordan and Egypt captured the rest. (Here's a map of the territory in 1949: <a href="http://www.theglobaleducationproject.org/mideast/info/maps/israel-1949-map.html)" rel="nofollow">http://www.theglobaleducationproject.org...</a><br>  <br>  In 1956 there was a war in which the borders did not change, then in 1967 there was another war in which Israel captured the Gaza Strip and Sinai Peninsula from Egypt, the West Bank from Jordan, and the Golan Heights from Syria. In the peace process with Egypt in 1979 they returned the Sinai Peninsula. And that's essentially where we are today in terms of the division of territory. In all of their negotiating, the Palestinians demand that the Israelis return to the pre-1967 borders (out of the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and Golan Heights).<br>  <br>  As you can see, the UN attempted to split up the territory, but because the surrounding countries (and the Palestinians themselves) were not ok with the division, they attacked and the conflict has been going on ever since (really it had started even before that, but that would make things even more complicated).<br>  <br>  The UN cannot do anything that even one of the permanent 5 members of the Security Council members doesn't want. And even though it did pass a resolution requiring Israel to return to the pre-1967 borders, Israel has refused to comply. It would therefore be a little unreasonable to expect the UN to solve the conflict on its own. The UN is part of the "Quartet," however, the group made up of the United States, EU, UN, and Russia, which is tasked with negotiating to find a resolution to the conflict. <br>  <br>  If you're interested, I suggest you get a book on the conflict, as it's so complicated and the history is so long that it's really impossible to do it justice here in Yahoo Answers.|`|Pd4Fh0Ymaa	That conflict will never be solved and might  possibly be the reason of Man's demise.<br>  <br>  I sound like one of those wacko street preachers but nope I ain't one I am just a normal person that just wanted to put this on record! <br>  <br>  You never know one day this statement might show that not everyone of my race was as dense as  its  leaders.|`|g5I3tlQDaa	No it’s a British Empire Made conflict.

8cLV2OPYaa	World War 3 has already started. If we were living in the WW 2 era right now, it would be like 1937 or 1938. Simply because we have not been dragged into the full scale conflict yet, doesn't mean the war hasn't already started, or at least is imminent.<br>  <br>  It doesn't matter though. Nobody listened in 1938 either, and look how far hitler went. We may have delayed WW 3 somewhat, or slowed the march to it anyways, by taking out Hussein, but we still have 2 countries left in the "Axis" to deal with, both of whom are more than capable of dragging the world into war. N. Korea and Iran. All that would have to happen is if N. Korea attacked Japan or S. Korea, or if Iran attacked Iraq or Israel.<br>  <br>  Not to mention we have Pakistan moving closer and closer to Islamic extremism and they are already nuclear. That area could go south very quickly as well. We are far closer to the brink here than anyone cares to mention. However, as I said, nobody listened in 1938, and nobody will listen now. Our taking down Hussein is somewhat analogous to what would have happened if we had taken out, say, Italy, right before WW 2 started, in 1937 or so. The war still would have happened I am sure, but Hitler would have had one less tool in his toolbox to prosecute the war, and therefore, would have lost the war much sooner, or advanced significantly less in the same period of time.<br>  <br>  It will never cease to amaze me how very few people learn from history, and insist on trying to re-inventing the wheel.|`|2a9MLpZRaa	Well that's not necessarily true.  A one megaton nuclear warhead would destroy a six mile radius.  First everything would be burnt off instantly, and up to twelve miles away any area exposed to the light from the blast (or radiation) would be burned, basically any unshaded area relative to ground zero.  Then for the next few weeks there would be a cloud of radiated dust that would settle back to earth and of course electronic devices would be knocked out because of EMP.  Now the larger problem with this isn't so much with countries that are developing nuclear weapons programs but the ones that have a well defined nuclear arsenal.  See the only way that a sizeable landmass could be destroyed by nuclear weapons would be to blanket a large area with blasts, so rather I would worry more about a nuclear standoff between say the US, Russia, UK, France, China, India, or Israel if they have between the 100-200 devices that is claimed by the NRDC|`|teKeLxX2aa	It's not a matter of 'if', but a matter of 'when'. Understand that as it stands, no class of weapon that has ever been created has gone without use. Chemical weapons found their usage in WWI, despite being some of the most horrendous means of enacting death and destruction known to mankind (which is why rules and regulations regarding chemical and biological weapons have been put into place, despite all major world powers having stockpiles much worse today).<br>  <br>  At the end of WWII, we entered the atomic age with the dropping of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, killing around 200,000 people instantly, and many hundreds of thousands more from the radioactive fallout. And understand that those bombs are weaker than anything in the nuclear arsenal today<br>  <br>  As the progression of World Wars have brought about progressive death and destruction, the next one would most probably be inconceivable on an international scale. The size and scope remains unknown, but the probability is most certain. Understand that the time we live in is the intermediary period, as was the end of WWI (1918) to the start of WWII (1939). during that roughly 20 year period, there wasn't a day that went by when people weren't discussing the likelihood of a second world war, let along could anyone of imagined that around 45 million people would've died as a result.<br>  <br>  People speculate about the size and scope, but that will always remain uncertain until after the fact. Somewhere along the lines a nuclear war will breakout (probably in the Middle East involving Israel and some other Nuclear armed Islamic country). How fast the international community is able to stop it before it expands will be the decisive factor in the ultimate outcome. Had the International Community been able to come to some sort of understanding following the assassination of Franz Ferdinand, those 15 million people wouldn't of died in WWI, and WWII never would've happened.|`|r8rykCkGaa	Since everyone knows it would destroy the whole planet, they are holding back on it as far as the nuclear goes, but they do have the weapons (even though some nations say they don't or have said they are not producing them).|`|qYZ2QFlbaa	Anything is possible.|`|rDLjE3Fuaa	You make it sound like there isn't a wolrd war already. This war is exactly like the Cold War. Everything done out of fear of nuclear annhilation.

K6zkGj7Zaa	It depends on what MOS he is going into.<br>  The Combat Arms jobs are usually more proactive with leadership training.<br>  While some basic leadership is taught in the very beginning at basic training, more is taught to Combat Arms in AIT (A school).<br>  <br>  The first formal Leadership training is known as "Warrior Leader Course" formerly known as PLDC.  This is for E-4 & E-5 soldiers.<br>  <br>  The next is BNCOC for E-6 and then ANCOC for E-7.<br>  <br>  There is also the Sergent Major Academy.<br>  <br>  All of these courses are from 4 weeks to 9 months long.<br>  <br>  That is the formal training.

Instigating under the guise of a manufactured identity, their attempts to remain incognito are infantile at best, and moronic when you consider they actually think their fooling anybody. Posing as christians, they deliver a doctrine of intolerance and hatred, when in fact, true christians are more tolerant than most people because they believe that God is the judge, and that throughout his ministry Jesus hung out with some pretty perverse personalities. And of course there are those who<br>  like to play Democrat or Republican so that they can lob the verbal grenades. Why they need a disguise to instigate something as simple as heating up Libs and Cons I don't know. Unless they're the insecure personality types who can't take what they're willing to dish out. Then we have the trolls who want to heat up the racial prejudice debate. There is no debate. Racial prejudice is alive and well, and Living in the USA. Why most people always want to limit it to blacks and whites can only speak to the insulated environment that they live in. I grew up in Los Angeles, Lived in San Francisco, Tulsa, Ok, Kansas City, Mo, Atlanta, Ga, and Dallas, Tx, and the amount of racial tension in larger cities is oppressive. I am Native American and I have also experienced racial injustice and bigotry, usually from the very people that accuse others of racism. In order to conquer racism, someone has to give ground, and our independent spirits have a tough time with that. Even when I visit on other reservations, I sometimes run into the un-welcome wagon, which turns out to be more of a pissing contest between jealosy and pride. On the streets, those who have gained ground are not wiling to part with it, and every stranger is a threat. Safe passage is never guaranteed, even if you know someone. It's the same everywhere. So, Mandy, there's nothing to be ashamed of. Your perception may be that white people are the real problem with racism, but that's not true. They are no more to blame then the black people, muslims, Indians, Asians, Mexicans, or any other ethnic group. And anyone who says all of us don't have some bigotry and racism in us is <br>  just lying to themselves. I have longtime friends I played music with, sports with, grew up with, broke bread with, surfed with and partied with, of probably every persuasion, all brothers, all well loved, all the same.The racism that lingers among us is not about skin color or dialect or a language barrier. It's about attitudes, and stubborness of mind. I don't go into someones territoryand lock eyes, puff up, and grow wide, because it's disrespectful, and can lead to absence of breath. And likewise, I don't accept that kind of behavior on my land. Until we learn how to comprimise, provide safe passage, change our attitudes, and make the first move toward peace and equality, racism will have a home right where we live.<br>  I can feel the love...koo.

ewbuVeTTaa	Technically, no. As stated, due to the Lawrence v. Texas decision by the U.S. Supreme Court, all such laws in all states against oral, anal and sex in general before marriage are unconstitutional, void and unenforceable.  True, some states try to enforce them by arresting and even trying to try the case, but all any lawyer has to do is show this decision to the judge and more likely they will dismiss it as the law cannot be enforced. Even before the decision, such laws were rarely enforced anyway. Technically, no it is not illegal anymore in any state due to the ruling of the U.S. Supreme Court, some states try to defy the ruling with no success.|`|2NRCJgq2aa	The U.S. Supreme Court ruled 6-3 that sodomy laws are unconstitutional on June 26, 2003.<br>  <a href="http://www.sodomylaws.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sodomylaws.org/</a><br>  <br>  However, some states still attempt to enforce their laws.

285c8243564acc36040f290206c3ff28aa	In your case, "grounds for committal" means that, in the opinion of the writer, you could be committed to a mental institution for up to three days for observation, because you "represent a danger to yourself or others."  It means that someone thinks you should be observed by a psychiatrist because you may have a mental illness.  Hitting your head means that you are a danger to yourself.  This is not the way normal people behave.|`|c3DqvgE4aa	In law, a committal procedure is the process by which a defendant is charged with a serious offence under the criminal justice systems of all common law jurisdictions outside the United States. The committal procedure, sometimes known as a preliminary hearing, replaces the earlier grand jury process.<br>  <br>  In most jurisdictions criminal offences fall into one of three groups:<br>  <br>  There are less serious (summary) offences which are usually heard without a jury by a magistrate. These are roughly equivalent to the older category of misdemeanors (terminology that is now obsolete in most non-U.S. jurisdictions).<br>  <br>  There are intermediate offences which are indictable (equivalent to an old-style felony) but which can be heard summarily. For instance, theft is usually a serious offence. If however the charge is that the defendant stole a packet of biscuits worth only a very small amount, it would probably be heard by a magistrate. In England and Wales, these are known as either-way offences, and can only be heard summarily with the defendant's consent.<br>  <br>  Finally, there are serious matters which must be dealt with in the higher courts, usually before a jury. When one is charged with an offence of the third type, a preliminary hearing is first held by a magistrate to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to warrant committing the defendant for trial. That is, whether there is sufficient evidence such that a properly instructed jury could (not would) find the defendant guilty. It is a very low-level test, although stricter than the grand jury procedure. The majority of committal proceedings result in a committal to trial.<br>  <br>  In some jurisdictions the prosecuting authority may directly present a defendant for trial regardless of the result of the committal proceedings by filing an ex officio indictment. Equally, the prosecuting authority usually has the power to stop any prosecution by entering a Nolle prosequi. In many jurisdictions the right of a defendant to cross-examine witnesses during the committal is reliant on the defence establishing that it is in the interests of justice or to illuminate some relevant point. The defence rarely calls witnesses at a committal.<br>  <br>  Though the majority of committal proceedings result in trial, the majority of committal proceedings for those accused of rape does not result in trial in the UK, something that campaigners have tried to change for decades

It does not say that all govt policies and buildings etc have to be void of religious references. They did not want the church running govt or govt running church like had happened in England. Even Washington ended his oath of office with the words "So help me God."|`|yDP9xHNnaa	Are you serious?  The government does not recognize RELIGIOUS marriage.  You have to get a marriage license to be married the government only recognizes the properly executed license holders as having special privileges (and responsibilities).  If a couple wants to have a religious ceremony that is their choice but the government does not care.<br>  <br>  If it were just base on religion then the government would not grant a divorce unless you first got an annulment from the church.

Murder victims from decades and centuries past are discovered regularly.  Some people get away with it because there weren't laws that covered the crimes when they committed them.  Many people get off on a technicality.  Criminal record or no, it's possible.  But just having a clean slate prior to committing a crime doesn't necessarily mean a 'get out of jail free' card.  There are several factors involved.  Which crime did you commit?  Which judge did you get?  Where was the crime committed?<br>  <br>  Need more info. :)|`|40c1ffcd5b8b2365fee3350d24bfb09eaa	With forensics there is almost no chance of getting away with anything  especially a violent crime.

AA11707728	Neither.  He was elected by people who wanted more handouts from the government. Sure, the most visible supporters were all about "change" and the whole rah, rah, things.  But the vast majority of Obama voters were votes bought by promises of more socialist handouts.<br>  <br>  Which Obama is right now implementing.  His "stimulus" bill is nothing of the sort.  You have to smoke alot of crack before the immediate 1000 point crash in the stock market, the very second that bill became law, can start to look like something stimulating the economy.  What it is, is a gigantic entitlement spending bill.  Obama is paying off all those people who voted for him at the expense of the productive people in society (who he plans to tax to death....but, we'll just see if he gets away with that crap).<br>  <br>  I guess, from the point of view of these people who voted for Obama, he is doing a great job.  He's doing exactly what they voted him into office for.|`|QluBTwCvaa	It is all a lot more complicated than you ever dreamed. Pray for Him for his protection from all the devices of the enemy, Satan himself. He will try to use him and manipulate him. He desperately needs our prayers.Pray for the LORD's wisdom to be given Him and all the devil's plans to be foiled.  I understand why black's would want someone who they related to as president.  I wish they could have related to a man or woman who they knew would willingly serve God. When men wish to do good, God will give them good leaders.  When people want to do evil, the LORD will let them have evil leaders. When people do not pray they will be deceived.  When someone perceives  a leader as one who will get them what they want, then what they want determines their vote. The slaughter of the innocent, the abortion of millions of our nation's children is not even enough to effect a vote against one who backs abortion. I think the liberal press got their men in there.  Did you know in the midst of the stimulus package is hidden that which will require you to get government approval for health care? Here come the goodies they wanted with poison in the middle.|`|RuUUPWYUaa	The Presidential election came down to two viable individuals: Senator McCain and Senator Obama. In essence, President Obama came to the arena with his thinking cap on, where as McCain appeared to be sleep at the wheel. McCain selected Former Senator Phil Graham as his chief economic adviser. The very person who informed American citizens that our growing dismal economy was all in our minds. In addition; McCain select Palin as his running mate. This coupled with the fact she made no sense; provided most voters security and rest that Obama was the better candidate.

It is simply not my place.   I did not vote for him because I do not think bigger government is the solution.  I think big government is what caused the problem.  People who like to tell me I voted against him because of race,  those people do infuriate me.   They are the racists because they imply I should vote for race.|`|Z03zgM0maa	since when was being the minority an advantage when running for presidency? he was the underdog and was suppose to lose to hillary. then people listened to him and loved his speeches. by the way obama won by 8.5 million votes. there were more white people that voted for him than black anyways. keep in mind, a lot of people DIDN'T VOTE FOR HIM because he is black. unless you live in a fantasy world where racists don't exist.<br>  <br>  White evangelicals voted for mccain because he is white...so there you go. Of course there are ignorant voters on both sides.
AA12181502	We no longer move as frequently as it costs too much money.  Arms plotting as it was known was supposed to have stopped totally after the recent amalganmations,  however it is impossible to stop this completely as there are two battalions posted at anyone time in Cyprus and they are rotated every two to three years, this in turn causes other battalions to move. For the record Limahl is talking cr@p!<br>  <br>  Edit<br>  <br>  Neil T is fundamentally correct in his answer and for the majority of infantry Battlions this will be the case.  However as I have already outlined Cyprus is the fly in the ointment as far as this subject is concerned, at present the battalions here will rotate between 2-3 years depending on operational tempo.  The only other major moves is the draw down from Germany which started earlier last year with the move of 4th Armoured Bde to Catterick from Osnabruck.|`|968837a2f6943f22a9655689e9626ee9aa	generally the only 2 year post was Northern Ireland, an Infantry unit would go over for a 24 month posting then move to another camp in Mainland Britain or Germany for between 5 to 7 years.<br>  <br>  Some units have a permanent base and the soldiers are posted from unit to unit individually, these are normally the Corps units like Artillery, Engineers, Logistic Corps etc. where the infantry move as a complete battalion|`|8YBiVlcTaa	Yep, arms plot has gone. But that was for teeth arms only, as they tended to stay together so the army moved them around to see the world and get a variety of postings. However as moving around is a big push factor and the cost of it, 600 people per month to move every month it was stopped. Support arms personnel move individually, they move from regiment/Brigade to another regiment/Brigade. What you do if you're in the wrong place when the music stops I don't know, change cap badges?<br>  It all depends on what role you want, I see you said armed forces, postings in the RAF and RN are very different. Ask at your local AFCO, if you've a trade in mind or even if you haven't. Good luck.|`|jqLWuLkDaa	They do not any more.  What was called the "Arms Plot" has now, I believe been discontinued and most units now stay in one location.  To give you an example the newly formed Mercian Regiment has three regular battalions, one is based in Catterick, one in Northern Ireland and one is due to move to Germany later this year.  These three locations will be their "home" for a considerable period of time.  It will not stop them from being deployed (as the battalion in Northern Ireland has just been) to Afghanistan.<br>  <br>  If I have given any incorrect information, I am sure their are regular personnel who will correct me.|`|f43be0279e4f60717eb598a32d93faa0aa	I didn't realise they do, but if so it's probably a similar reason to why the diplomatic services can only take 3 year postings. It's to limit the relationships that can be formed with certain local groups/people to restrict the possibility of corruption and undue influence.|`|xKuWE9gfaa	All the answers you have had are correct, but it's also good to move of you don't like your neighbours LOL|`|obgLrzq3aa	In the RAF, personnel move as an individual, rather than a formed unit and the average posting length is 3 years, but can be less if you ask to be posted, from the 18 month in-post point.  You can also stay at a base for more than 3 years, so long as no-one else requests a posting to where you are.  Not sure why it's always been done like this, but it suits me - I get a new job every 3 years, new colleagues, new local area to explore, just means its a bit of a pain for my other half who has to follow me around the country!
n8EIxO9Faa	I my opinion, it doesnt look that good- DHS upholds the law not breaks it

Doubt it though.|`|42SDcehQaa	He sent 40% of the troops to Iraq to win the war when he first said that the war is meaningless before he became President and that he'll withdraw the troops if he becomes President. He pulled the curtain on helping homeowners for that new law which I'm not too sure of. He is also taxing based on the amount of gas people buys instead of the mileage because it's just not enough to support the transportation system. <br>  <br>  He just started out. We'll just have to see how his actions would effect our country. It's too early to come up with a conclusion.|`|R1LvhhTeaa	Oh Man!  I couldn't be more pleased with Obama.  In the first couple hours he was president he reinvigorated the Freedom of Information Act that Li'l Bush killed 8 LONG years ago.  <br>  <br>  The Stimulus package - nobody really knows - nobody's god.  However, I'd trust Obama to get it right before anybody else.  He's a brainy guy - Constitutional Scholar.  He is a 100% departure from the utter stupidity and contempt of Li'l Bushy.  <br>  <br>  More Freedom!  Obama!|`|zdQGden1aa	I agree with what he's doing thus far. I strongly believe that the tax credit for first time home buyers will definitely be an incentive and up to this point America hasn't seen anything like it. The stimulus plan has yet to be proven, but him rapping the infrastructure tax to promote rebuilding better highways I feel WILL increase jobs for skilled workers.<br>  He's grabbing this thing by the reigns and trying to re route what has created a catastrophic downfall in the economy. <br>  Soooo...GO OBAMA-So far so good in my book.<br>  <br>  <br>  you'll notice that those who secretly lobby against obama keep mentioning "the stimulus package" as if they can honestly say that this course of action has deeply affected anything that they do day to day. people just need something to complain about. the package hasn't "touched" the average americans pocket nor hand yet. if there's widespread propaganda its not from obama's preachings, these naive americans honestly thought that the great white hope would be McCain and it wasn't. americans were waiting on bipartisan politics, none of which McCain nor his constituents<br>  could deliver. I honestly believe that this country would have been ran pursuant to how any typical republic party would run it. Look at the track records. There has always been some "major" catastrophe when these republicans get in office, Nixon, Regan, Bush both 1 & 2 they have horrible track records and have always spent billions of america's dollars on sugar coated BS.|`|xCSZ3M3Raa	He is our president, so i support him.

jw1bNJMCaa	You receive a score for each of the eight subtests, as well as a score for three "composite areas" Verbal Ability Composite, Math Ability Composite, Academic Ability Composite. Your Raw Score is calculated with the following formula:<br>  (Word Knowledge Score x 2) + (Paragraph Comprehension Score x 2) + (Arithmetic Reasoning Score) + (Mathematics Knowledge Sore) = Raw Score<br>  <br>  So for example, if you score 20 on Word Knowledge, 10 on Paragraph Comprehension, 20 on Arithmetic Reasoning, and 20 Mathematics Knowledge, your raw score would be 100.<br>  <br>  The raw score you obtained is also calculated as a Percentile Score. For example, if you scored in the 60th percentile then 40% of the candidates that were tested scored higher than you and 59% had scores that were lower than yours. This score is very important to a recruiter.<br>  <br>  The last calculation derived from your scores is the Military Careers Score. This score is a combination of Academic Ability Composite score and the Mechanical Comprehension and Electronics Information scores. The score range is 140 to 240 with 200 being about average. A book titled Military Careers will accompany your test results. It is designed to describe most of the careers available in the military as well as the job requirements for each career. In addition you can reference a graph that shows your chance of acceptance based on the Military Careers Score.|`|sgEloO1Jaa	wherever i go if the thermostat is accessible i change it to 69.......yes WHEREVER i go|`|jUdqsRfOaa	the number 69 can NEVER be taken serious ever again lol.|`|K6zkGj7Zaa	A score of 69 is a bit above average.  <br>  Minimum to enlist is 31, Max score for test is 99.<br>  <br>  Your actual "line" scores will also be a factor.

Not a GED.  A GED limits you also.<br>  <br>  Finally after getting qualified at the MEPS, it depends on what is available in your service of choice at that time.  <br>  Some jobs you are qualified for, may not be available at the time you are there.  <br>  There may be jobs you want, but are not available because you are just not qualified.  <br>  You may want to come back if your heart is set on one job.

d20feb0d03f94b65cc82fb1a12566011aa	The Federal Reserve is a unique legal entity that can be described as an independent government agency with member bank participation. It is organized with a 100% government agency at the top (the Board of Governors), and branches beneath them that are organized like corporations with member banks as shareholders.(Ref: <a href="http://www.federalreserveeducation.org/fed101/structure/" rel="nofollow">http://www.federalreserveeducation.org/f...</a> , <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/generalinfo/faq/faqfrs.htm#4" rel="nofollow">http://www.federalreserve.gov/generalinf...</a> )<br>  <br>  The Board of Governors are all appointed for 14-year terms by the president and confirmed by congress. It operates per it's charter and laws set by congress. it is overseen by congress. There is no structure or mechanism for private ownership at this level; it is a government agency. You can confirm this from a number of government sites that list it as a government agency (e.g. <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/government/independent-agencies.html)" rel="nofollow">http://www.whitehouse.gov/government/ind...</a> Board members are forbidden by law to have any economic interest in a private bank. (Ref: Title 12 chapter 3 of the U.S. Legal Code). The Board determines monetary policy and provides high level oversight of the branches. <br>  <br>  The 12 branches can be considered highly regulated private corporations. Member banks are required to buy shares in their branch. Each bank has one vote.  They can vote for 6 of their 9 board members, the other 3 are appointed by the Board of Governors.  Though the branches are called non-profit, the member banks get a standard 6% dividend on their shares. The remaining 'profit' is turned over to the Treasury at the end of the year. <br>  <br>  For confirmation on this, check out how Hoovers classifies them: <br>  <a href="http://www.hoovers.com/free/search/simple/xmillion/index.xhtml?query_string=Federal+Reserve&which=company&page=1&x=91&y=2#HooversCompanyNameMatchesH2" rel="nofollow">http://www.hoovers.com/free/search/simpl...</a> <br>  <br>  And those shares that the member banks own? Some say there are so many restrictions that it falls short of true ownership<br>  <br>  From Edward Griffin, noted anti-fed intellect (<a href="http://www.bigeye.com/griffin.htm)" rel="nofollow">http://www.bigeye.com/griffin.htm)</a><br>  <br>  "It's a hybrid, part corporation and part government, part private, part government.<br>  .. <br>  Every bank that's in the system is an owner of the Federal Reserve...  But that's as far as it goes because those stock certificates do not carry with them any of the attributes of private ownership. For example, the holders of these certificates cannot sell them. If you can't sell something then you don't really own it, that's one of the tests of ownership, your ability to dispose of it. You cannot sell it. Furthermore the larger banks put up more money than the smaller banks, it's a ratio to their assets, so the larger banks have more stock certificates in the system than the small ones and yet regardless of the number that they hold, every bank has just one vote. There's another violation of the principle of private ownership. Furthermore that vote doesn't buy them anything. They can't vote for anything of substance; they cannot vote for their national management which is the most important thing, isn't it? The board of directors and chairman of the Federal Reserve System are appointed by the President, they're not elected by the banks that are part of the system, the President does that."|`|9wrMpXRyaa	Look at the back of a dollar bill<br>  It says Federal Reserve System<br>  How many of you know that system is privately owned?<br>  How many of you know that the Federal Reserve System is controlled by a few banks and a handful of very rich people?<br>  How many of you know that the chairman of the Federal Reserve System is probably the most powerful man on the planet?<br>  <br>  The Federal Reserve System controls our money supply<br>  Prints our money<br>  Controls our Interest rates<br>  encourages you to be in debt<br>  lends money to our government while you the tax payer are paying interest on that debt.<br>  That our money is not backed by anything tangible, such as gold or silver, but only backed with a promise.<br>  <br>  In short, they control just about every aspect of your life, your money, your credit cards, your mortgage, your car loan, student loans, your retirment, etc.<br>  Including having their hands in getting us involved in money making wars.<br>  <br>  The smartest thing I ever did was chose to live debt free about 20 years ago.

Really things are fine in Canada except for seeing specialists. Sometimes that can take up to a year. So you have to be your own advocate.

It's those situations where it's not easily detected, and you can't just pay to see a specialist, where you have to be your own advocate. That's mostly where the problem is in my opinion.

All political leaders that eventually made it to the top post in governance were involved one way or the other to certain affinity with military activity. Whatever form of government, either communism or democracy the key personalities behind every governing body must create the image of that a strong leader and by that impression military are by far the most prominent example. Stalin and Hitler respectively, are virtually equated with being a strong leaders, thus reinforcing their image with shades of militarism. Also, in any government set up the head of state, whether president or prime minister are also bestowed with the title of commander in chief making the army/military reports to the head.

Obama was the junior United States Senator from Illinois from January 2005 until November 2008, when he resigned following his election to the presidency.<br>  <br>  Obama is a graduate of Columbia University and Harvard Law School, where he was the first African American president of the Harvard Law Review. He worked as a community organizer in Chicago prior to earning his law degree, and practiced as a civil rights attorney in Chicago before serving three terms in the Illinois Senate from 1997 to 2004. He also taught constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School from 1992 to 2004. Following an unsuccessful bid for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives in 2000, Obama was elected to the United States Senate in November 2004. Obama delivered the keynote address at the Democratic National Convention in July 2004.<br>  <br>  While serving as a Senator, he belonged to several committees, including the Foreign Relations, Environment and Public Works, Veterans' Affairs, Health, Education, Labor and Pensions and Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.<br>  <br>  After a particularly close campaign in the 2008 Democratic Party presidential primary against rival Hillary Rodham Clinton, he won his party's nomination as a candidate for president, becoming the first major African American candidate for president. In the 2008 General Election he defeated Republican candidate John McCain with 52.9% of the popular vote and an margin of 365–173 in the electoral college. He was sworn in as the 44th President of the United States on January 20, 2009.|`|B1XT60WEaa	In my opinion- no. It was Clinton,s turn and she was better qualified.

fmHyfVmVaa	I hope it will, I fear it will not work. I have no credentials for economics & make no pretense to know the answers, but to me it seems we just keep making the same mistake. We live in a society of consumers. When we bailed out the auto companies they still cut jobs. When we bailed out the banks they still made it impossible now for anyone with less than perfect credit to get a loan. I have read reports that there are as much as 10,000 jobs a day lost. Unless the people are bailed out & can begin to buy again it matters little how much money you feed into any company. It just seems to me that the whole approach is a bit backward. If the people can buy then the companies will sell again & need no bailout. We live in a society where people have become the "evil consumer", but the "evil consumer" is what has driven our economy. I just am not getting my hopes up that any of it will work. Too much government & corporate corruption I fear! I will however remain hopeful!<br>  We are much closer to collapse than I fear many realize. Many banks hold on by a thread. The government itself is already so in debt, yet if we keep pouring money we don't have into things that don't work the government economy itself could collapse. I fear we are on a dangerous road here & I am not sure we could even turn it around now. At some point we must stop spending money we don't have & let the chips fall where they may. Only then will the system reorganize & recover.<br>  Blessings!|`|1ymL5LKlaa	This is a quote from the current Pres.<br>  <br>  <br>  Obama's expensive and ambitious package of federal spending and tax cuts is designed to revive the economy and save or create 3.5 million or more jobs. It will inject a sudden boost of cash into transportation, education, energy and health care, while aiming to help recession victims through tax cuts, extended unemployment benefits and short-term health insurance assistance. It also will add to a rapidly growing national debt.<br>  <br>  <br>  "It is only a first step on the road to economic recovery. And we cannot fail to complete the journey." He said the country also must stem foreclosures, repair the banking system, get credit flowing again and revamp financial industry regulations.<br>  <br>  Reading that, I interpret he is just getting started on economic packages and will spend even more of our grandchildren taxes.  It doesn't make any sense whatsoever.|`|AA11142708	When the 1929 stock market crashed, Herbert Hoover was the the Republican president and his policies of no government intervention in the economy helped to cause the great depression. The great depression was "great" because, essentially, the practice of the "survival of fittest ethic" was, back then, the ethical standard government held in high regard. People turned to crime, starved, no health care took many, etc. From '29 to '33 the economy tanked. The tanking numbers (the mortgage crisis, banking crisis, unemployment, no credit, etc.) are being mimicked (if not duplicated) in today's recession. In 1933 Roosevelt won a landslide election. All the social safety net programs that we accept as "normal" were put in place by Roosevelt's new deal--old age insurance, unemployment insurance, relief programs for the poor, FDIC, spending for job creation, bank rescue, --in short, his progressive government model was more about creating the conditions for a stable society as opposed to the destabilizing "winner take all society" that lead to all the suffering of the Great Depression. <br>  <br>  Obama's financial advisers--Republicans and Democrats, recognize that if the America  dream is not worth investing in, then that American dream may cease to exist (or, at best, only exist for a select few). His economic stimulus package may not work in all areas, but doing nothing is what Hoover did, and our history shows how incredibly wrong that was, not to mention all the unnecessary suffering those policies caused. I hope this helps. Writing it helped me.|`|6100f239c1abd562ada33e5323d1c871aa	As salaamu 'alaikym, my dear friend.<br>  <br>  So far, his plan has not worked.

The housing situation is dire.|`|lRmhwiYpaa	That 96% is a high number<br>  What is happening is that some people who can afford to pay their<br>  mortgages are now going into default hoping the government is going<br>  to bail them out.<br>  <br>  I think this is a stinking reason but if you have a $300,000 home and it now is worth $200,000 you would probably think this was unfair too<br>  <br>  My house went down in value A LOT but it is paid for but I think <br>  <br>  it was everyone's dream to have a home and when they sell ~~~they<br>  <br>  would make a tidy profit<br>  <br>  Now that is not the case.<br>  <br>  Most people are probably not having problems but enough of them<br>  <br>  will in the near future when the Big Three and other companies lose<br>  <br>  millions of workers.  Obama will not replace these jobs no matter what<br>  <br>  he says|`|WCkOUF9aaa	True.|`|s1LfdCdsaa	Sadly, that's false. If you look at the sociological patterns, you see that warm weather areas like Florida, Arizona, Vegas, California, have the highest foreclosure rates in the country. Coincidence? No.<br>  <br>  The majority of foreclosures involve the "interest only ARM". Remember the old saying about "if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is?" This kind of mortgage is proof positive.<br>  <br>  I don't understand why it hasn't been publicized more, since I'm not sure people realize how many of these bad loans were doomed from the start. Think about it, an "interest only" mortgage. Wow! You mean I just have to pay the interest amount each month for 2 or 3 years? Oh man! That's under a thousand dollars a month (for many people, under $500 a month) !<br>  <br>  It wasn't just the brokers who did the scamming. Borrowers started trying to figure out what they could get away with, having to pay such a small amount per month. Let's say a couple had one person on some type of long term or permanent disability, or even unemployment. The other person said "hey! if we refinance into one of those interest-only bad boys, I can quit my job too and "hang out" on unemployment for a year and a half." Smart, right??  WRONG, but people in the warm weather states did this left and right!!<br>  <br>  This kind of borrower didn't want to know about what happened when the initial two or three year period was up. They got all the paperwork, the information was right there. They just chose to "ignore it" or "deal with it when the time comes." And when that time DID come and the rates ratcheted up, these people were looking at double or even triple their monthly mortgage payment.<br>  <br>  Now what? Were these people going to hurry out and get jobs, or two jubs if needed, to make that payment? Hell no!! After all, when they refinainced, they did so at 97% or 98% of the present "market value" of their home, a value that is now lower, meaning they owed more on the house than it was worth!!<br>  <br>  When the going gets tough....well instead of "get going", these people just said "screw it, let the bank take the house"!<br>  <br>  There are people who face foreclosure through no fault of their own. They may have lost jobs or become incapacitated, and are unable to find another job to keep current on their payments. However, these numbers are greatly eclipsed by the number of people who are in foreclosure because they flat out refused to go out and work their butts off until their house sold or they refinanced. Their credit cards were maxed out while they "skated" on unemployment, and they stopped paying the credit card companies. Since their credit scores tanked, the banks won't refinance them.<br>  <br>  I don't think the D.N.C is crying wolf, but once again, they expect hard working taxpayers who are mostly white, to bail out the "distressed" homeowners, most of whom are not white.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind however, that it's not "PC" to tell the truth (even though it's TRUE!)|`|u23sBafTaa	I can say I live in a small town, and there is not one house being repoed.  Then again there are only maybe five on the market at any given time here.  It is very hard to find a house to buy here, and when one comes on the market it isn't there very long.  Strangely enough our values are not dropping  either.  We haven't had much manufacturing in this area since Jimmy Carter, but the area has survived.

859181a141fdd56da93ac49e98b54247aa	Some of the answers you have already received trouble me.  It shows just how out of touch with reality some people are.  Lets talk about what Obama said and what he has done.....  The campaign slogan was all about "Hope and Change".  How much hope has he given us?  Leaders instill confidence in people, he does not.  So how hopeful are you since you elected Mr. Obama?  I remember when President Reagan inherited an economy worse than this one and he turned things around in  18 months not by raising taxes of talking gloom and doom to the American people, but by cutting taxes and restoring peoples pride in being an American.  Reagan showed real leadership.  His efforts gave us the longest running bull market in history.  Lets get back to Mr Obama.  He promised change and on that he delivered.  He has changed the country in less than 30 days.  The bill he signed, the spending bill, rewards those who have been irresponsible, gives more power to the federal government, repeals Mr. Clinton's welfare reform, and will make more people dependent on government on our way to a socialistic society.  The problem during the election is that not enough of us asked Mr. Obama to clearly tell us what "change" meant to him.  Not all change is good and we all are seeing that now.  Mr. Obama said that troops would be out of Iraq in 90 days.  On this one I am glad he told a lie.  He is sending 17,000 more troops to Afganistan and there is not a single word from all the media sources that complained loudly about our military involvement prior to Mr. Obama's administration.  Mr. Obama said that he would have no place for lobyists in his administration.  News flash, he has lobyists and he is trying to tell us he could find nobody else so had to make exceptions.  He told us that his cabinet would be held to a higher standard and that his administration would be ethical.  Well now when you receive a notice from the IRS telling you that you did not pay all your taxes please remember that the head of the IRS failed to pay his taxes and only did so when his nomination for the cabinet post came up.  Dont forget that two other nominees for his cabinet also had tax problems.  Ethical huh?  The latest slap in the face is that Mr. Obama talks down the economy daily.  The Dow has lost 2000 points since his Ignauguration!  He also tells (scares) the American people that the "stimulus" bill has to be passed right away or dire consequences will follow for the economy.  Trouble is he did not write the bill and has not read the bill and no Congressman or Senator read it either, but it passed and supposedly it will save us from disaster.  That is like going to a used car lot and hearing the salesman say "If you don't sign now that car may be off the lot tomorrow.  This is your chance!"  Who of us who is a responsible citizen rushes into a deal costing big dollars without evaluating the expenditure?  It would be like buying a mansion without seeing it or even knowing it exists.  That ties into Mr Obama's rhetoric about "responsibility"!  What he means is that you who pay taxes need to be responsible, but government that spends your tax dollars and those that they have put on the welfare rolls can do as they please.  If you voted for Obama, this is what you got.

raImBqwraa	Why are you replacing them instead of fixing them?    In the Marines, we don't have ACUs, apparently we can figure out our clothes without assistance from velcro :D, but our new MARPAT cammies have the same problems to what you're talking about.    As far as the fading, just treat it like you do any other laundry, and only wash cammies with cammies (And socks, undershirts, etc). It'll help that in the army, they only have one uniform now, and apparently grey matches everything, so you could do it all in one load, and make sure you're using color-safe detergent and such.    As for the hole in the crotch, for some reason, military pants are notorious for this, and I had to sew mine up about once a month. Is there some other problem with the hole placement as to why it can't be sown and needs to be replaced?

6OLiuM9Gaa	Apparently, the people in Australia aren't irresponsible morons. Those of us in the US seem to tend to that lofty station.<br>  <br>  In the US anybody can acquire a weapon... of almost any description. If you purchase legally from a dealer, there's paperwork, and usually a waiting period before you can walk out of the store with the weapon. But, one doesn't need to go to a dealer. There are gun shows where people sell weapons. There are weapons sold via newspaper "for sale" ads. There are gun thefts. A great many of those are illegal. There are so many of that latter type, and because they're not registered anywhere, the police are unable to go after them proactively until the owners commit some other type of crime. But we're talking about weapons... not the criminals. The point is that we don't have any way to deal with these irresponsible morons.<br>  <br>  In our Constitution we have an amendment that allows: <br>  "Amendment 2 - Right to Bear Arms. Ratified 12/15/1791<br>  <br>  A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed."<br>  <br>  Our irresponsible and moronic populace can only comprehend, "the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed." It is no longer a freedom to them, but license. Every little boy (regardless of age) who feels his masculinity is in doubt wants to get the "biggies and baddest" weapon he can find to prove he's not just one of the girls. So we have irresponsible morons with fully automatic weapons (illegal) to "defend their home," or with which "to hunt." Some of them don't go quite that far -- for fear of incarceration or for lack of funds -- who purchase something like a .44 automag, or a .357 magnum for "self protection." If they fire that kind of weapon in their house the bullet will go through a neighbor's house before it stops. The point is that he is actually dumb enough to think he has the right (and need) to own that kind of weapon, and he's irresponsible enough to acquire it.<br>  <br>  Not all Americans are dull normal. Some actually do hunt. Some actually do shoot at target ranges. Some actually are responsible and have IQs above zero. I had a great uncle who owned a ranch in California. He had half a dozen shotguns, a couple of deer rifles (lever action) and a .22 (I seem to recall it was bolt action). He used them for hunting (legally) killing unwanted critters about the ranch (protecting his property).<br>  <br>  Laws (in the US) only apply to those who abide by them. Those who violate them don't care. They're outside the law anyway... so what's another law or two.<br>  <br>  The idea of adding more laws is about as moronic as those who can't read the Constitution. "A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State,..." The purpose isn't to be an immature, quasi-masculine idiot trying to prove that you can, in fact, stand on your hind legs and that you are, in fact, male. It's purpose was to not be caught again with our britches around our ankles were we ever invaded. The problem is that, because of the irresponsible morons, laws have had to be enacted to prevent us from being prepared to contribute substantively to a "well regulated Militia," and, because of those irresponsible morons who whine about their "rights" we clearly don't have a secure of particularly free State (read "Nation").<br>  <br>  Now, that said, one would think that somebody with a college education would see the ignorance of such a move... and its futility. However, it is only a degree in law... and the guy is a politician. Lawyers and politicians don't know how to do much of anything else but make more laws... oh... and spend money they don't have.<br>  <br>  More thoughts:<br>  <br>  When the Constitution was written, the area was pretty rural. Most of the people were farmers who supplemented their diet by hunting. There was no "Army" per se. It was more of a militia. They trained haphazardly, and they were required to provide their own weapons. Back then a battle consisted of two groups of guys lined up on opposite sides of a disputed piece of real estate and shooting at each other until one of the groups got tired of the game and gave up, or was killed. The maximum range of some of those early weapons was a couple hundred yards. The maximum effective range of most of them was between fifty and a hundred yards. Until the development of the grooved barrel, accuracy was not the main concern. The main thrust of an engagement was to put as much shot in the air in the direction of your enemy as possible. Some of it was likely to kill a few.<br>  <br>  Today things have changed... just a little. Now the groups don't line up on opposite sides of a piece of disputed real estate. We don't fight over real estate much anymore. We fight about ideas. The weapons we use have maximum ranges of several miles and effective ranges of maybe a couple thousand meters... and that's the small stuff. We have weapons that can hit a target half way around the world. <br>  <br>  The small stuff will shoot through a building almost as if it isn't there. The big stuff will obliterate the building... and those for miles around. <br>  <br>  When the founding fathers wrote the Second Amendment, they had to be thinking of the weapons of the time and the needs of the time.<br>  <br>  Today we have an Army. It's trained and well regulated. Anybody wants to play war games... all they have to do is join. They'll get to shoot really big "guns" with real bullets. It'll be a little different than hunting because deer and ducks don't often fire back and they almost never fire first... but that aspect might add to the excitement.<br>  <br>  Point is, with a standing Army, we really don't have a pressing need for every man to own an Uzi, or a Tech-9, or even a Magnum. What if we're attacked? Well, with only about 10% of the country possessing any military training, there won't be much the few wannabe heroes can do about it... except get themselves killed.<br>  <br>  Want to protect you home? Get a 12Ga shotgun. You don't have to be a particularly good shot, and when you miss, the shot will probably do some damage to a wall, but it'll stay in your own home and not put your neighbors in danger.<br>  <br>  But, what if we're invaded? Join the reserves, or the National Guard, or the Coast Guard... that way you'll be trained and can do something productive. And you'll be armed legally with some pretty potent weaponry... and you'll be trained how to use it. Or you could engage in a more preventative role and join the Marines, or the Navy, or the Army, or the Air Force. But, if we're attacked, I guess all of them, and the FBI, and the CIA, and the local law enforcement agencies will be involve in prevention.<br>  <br>  And those who say that we have a right to have weapons to protect ourselves from the government are in the same boat as those who pretend to own weapons to protect themselves from invaders. The government has a pretty much unlimited supply of hardware at it's disposal... unlimited at least compared to what the average John Doe has in his closet... or even stashed away in his cellar armory. You get too tough, and they'll simply call in an air strike.|`|sagjCRvKaa	Crime in Australia has risen since those gun laws where put in place. Can you name the one time in history where there was complete gun control? Oh let me see, Does HITLER ring any bells?? In states where you are allowed a gun, a criminal will think twice before he enters some one else's property, because there maybe a gun there. A gun evens the playing field, if I was attacked by a 250 lb man and I have a gun, I have an advantage of shooting the s.o.b. before he harms  me. There have been cases when a shooter came on a school campus and was shooting students, and someone who had a gun stopped the shooter.

One thing these people don't get is that what works out in the rural areas doesn't work in a rough part of a big city.  Nobody's interested in taking away country folk's hunting rifles, but some stricter controls on semi-automatic handguns in east Los Angeles might be a good idea.  However, it's really impossble to control.  New York already has strict handgun laws but it's very easy to buy a Saturday night special on the street.<br>  I kind of wish they would put hidden metal detectors on the streets of some big cities or at least at the doors of schools, and if they find a gun, make sure the person has a license, or at a school cannot bring a gun in.  <br>  But nothing will happen.  Any law that's passed will be ignored.  And I don't believe any restrictions will be passed anyway.  We have the 2nd amendment that says we have the right to bear arms.  I'm sure it wasn't meant to mean semi-automatic handguns, but it would take a constitutional amendment to change it. Violence in the USA will continue to grow, and our softy courts will kiss criminal butts while doing very little for victims.|`|AA10881156	In the US gun ownership is a guarantee afforded by the Constitution. There is no equivalent in Australia. When law abiding people are required to give up their firearms; then only the criminals will have guns....so no, less guns is not the answer.<br>  <br>  Australia has always had a lower homicide rate than the US, but according to government studies in Australia ... your gun control measures have had little effect on overall violence: <br>  <br>  The head of the New South Wales Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research, Don Weatherburn, noted that the level of legal gun ownership in New South Wales increased in recent years, and that the 1996 legislation had had little effect on violence. In 2006, the lack of a measurable effect from the 1996 firearms legislation was reported in the British Journal of Criminology by Dr Jeanine Baker (SSAA) and Dr Samara McPhedran (Women in Shooting and Hunting).<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_politics_in_Australia" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_politic...</a><br>  <br>  So, obviously gun control doesn't work even in Australia.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|4af080f759d6efef5b302ef31e62b04daa	Its a plain and simple truth.<br>  Most people get offended by B O.<br>  That is why so much deodorant is sold world wide.<br>  In France B O is tolerated, but in America most people do not care for B O.<br>  <br>  As far as guns go there was a story, years ago, about a town or city where a law was proposed and passed that mandated that all households must have a legally obtained firearm on the premise.<br>  The end result, virtually no crime in that municipality.<br>  I guess the bad guys figured it was not safe to ply their trade in that neighborhood.<br>  The end.|`|Zf2KhCJSaa	Democrat's are big on control and sneak laws and bills through riding on the coat tail of Other good bills and laws.<br>  They will pass laws to control guns.  <br>  They will change the contitution to suit themselves as they have done so many times before.|`|JXMVNEQoaa	Its the law of the land that we have the right to own guns gauranteed by the 2nd amendment in the Bill of Rights of our Constitution for defensive purposes whether it be from our own government or other people. Criminals dont abide by the law so if you restricted guns then only criminals would have guns. its also been a proven fact that in areas of the USA with lax gun control there is less crime. The USA is a gargantuine nation compared to australia and much more densely populated so naturally we'd have more crime. 40% of american house holds have a gun and theres about 280,000,000 owned firearms in the USA. what good is a dog or security door going to do if your walking down the street? or even a dog? without the right to bear arms we would not be a country and we'd be facing british oppression.

Our government is set up as a system of the people, by the people, for the people. When you take away the people's guns then it's the criminals and the government who has them.<br>  <br>  The point of Obama's gun laws is to find out where the guns are and make it increasingly more difficult for citizens to arm themselves. This is a violation of our Constitutional rights.<br>  <br>  P.S. The Constitution is the law of the land in America, but nowadays our politicians use it as toilet paper.|`|58TDAT1zaa	You are a troll that is not from Australia.  IF you were you would already know that when Australia stripped out all the legally owned guns from only the non-criminal citizens, that violent crime statistics went up by double digits the next year.

I am happy to explain it to you.<br>  <br>  Firstly there are several differences that are glaring between the US and Australia. The biggest difference is in population and population density. The next difference is in the general crime rate. We have MANY more people, and MUCH more crime. In addition to all of that, Americans are GUARANTEED the right to keep and bear arms in the constitution, primarily so that they have to capacity to arm themselves against the government becoming oppressive and operating illegally outside the constitution. It is so we can PROTECT ourselves, mainly from our own leaders and their agents. This was written in to the constitution after lessons learned from being under the heel of British rule.<br>  <br>  A government by the people isn't likely to remain "by the people" for long if they have no capacity to defend themselves against government corruption or oppression. In addition, we historically have needed the right to bear arms in the prosecution of our own survival, primarily in the frontier days when this country was still being tamed, but also lasting well into the 20th century, where many areas in this country were reasonably far from any more "official" means of justice.<br>  <br>  Having the ability to arm and defend ourselves, as well as effecting our own survival independent from oversight or "assistance" from the government is ingrained in our mindset, and has been there for our entire history. To make any attempt to remove those rights from us would be akin to taking away our right to speak or travel.<br>  <br>  Also as has been said many times before on the subject of gun control. Guns don't kill people. People kill people. If you attempt to outlaw guns, the people that would use guns to commit crimes will simply fashion their own or obtain them illegally by other means, meanwhile none of the law-abiding folks have any guns to defend themselves any more from the criminal who is going to get them anyways. Any way you slice it, it isn't fair or right to the "law-abiding" folks that they should have to live with less security in a poor attempt to socially engineer a criminal segment of the population that will simply find other means to perpetrate their crimes.<br>  <br>  Those school shootings could have easily been a crime involving explosives instead, made out of common household chemicals that no one could effectively outlaw anyways. You see what I mean? It isn't the guns, it's the mindset of the criminal themselves that is the problem, and whatever environment or condition that contributed to that mindset. No where in America has gun control ever been successful or EVER reduced crime. However, it has been shown many times that well armed communities are LESS frequently the victims of domestic crimes, such as car-jacking, burglary, armed robbery, rape, and even domestic violence believe it or not.<br>  <br>  A man isn't as likely to beat his wife if he knows she has a .44 magnum in her purse. Anyway, hopefully I was able to shed some light on this subject for you. There are many opinions about guns in America, but our right to have them is consistently upheld regardless of how vocal the extreme minority is that want to take them away from us.|`|xzSuXnvpaa	America would not even exist with out private gun ownership.<br>  <br>  "But with less guns wouldnt there be less reason for people needing them?"  But there won't be fewer guns. There will be fewer legally owned guns, and more criminals with guns. There will be roughly the same amount of guns.  I occassionally scan news from Australia, you have gun crime. The UK has even more oppressive gun laws than you, and they have gun crime. <br>  <br>  Taking guns from law abiding citizens does nothing to reduce crime.<br>  <br>  The 2nd Amendment is our insurance policy against an oppressive government.<br>  <br>  <br>  for the silly people who have not read the 2nd Amendment:<br>  Okay, I thought everybody with the reading comprehension of a 10 year old knew that the 2nd Amendment is NOT about hunting, it IS about defense.<br>  <br>  "I find having secuirty doors to also be a helpful deterant...or a dog?" But if your country has such restrictive gunlaws, and you claim such safety and security due to those laws, then do you need security doors, or a dog for protection? What are you protecting against? Could it be some criminal that just refuses to obey the law?

To undergo radiation treatment when either unnecessary or contraindicated;   ? To undergo hospitalization when either unnecessary or contraindicated;   ? That pesticide and herbicide residues in your foods will not hurt you or your children;   ?

The Butchers Bill   But, as we know, these experts  who are supposedly so smart and capable  almost always get it wrong. And, worse, when they get it wrong, they do a spectacular job of it too. Although the data varies depending upon the source, just look at what the butchers bill comes to:   ? 106,000 deaths annually, at a cost of $12 billion, from adverse drug reactions;   ? 98,000 deaths annually, at a cost of $2 billion, from medical errors;   ? 115,000 deaths annually, at a cost of $55 billion, from bedsores;   ? 88,000 deaths annually from infections, at a cost of $5 billion, caused by medical intervention;   ? 37,000 deaths annually, at a cost of $122 billion, from unnecessary medical procedures;   ? 32,000 deaths annually, at a cost of $9 billion, from surgery-related medical intervention   The above figures do not include those outpatient deaths from medical intervention (some 199,000 annually at a cost of $77 billion), or the astounding figures from Dr. Lucien Leapes 1997 study of medical and drug-error rates (3 million deaths annually, he reports!) (Leape LL, Error in Medicine, JAMA, 1994 Dec 21;272(23):1851-7).   On the more conservative end of the spectrum, even an expert panel from the Institute of Medicine (of the National Academy of Sciences) found that medical errors kill from 44,000 to 98,000 Americans each year. (British Medical Journal, 1999 December 11; 319(7224): 1519.   Medical errors in the United States alone cause more deaths annually than car crashes, AIDS, or breast and prostate cancer.

Back in 1976, the following ad began appearing in New York newspapers:  Last Chance for gay men to join the Hepatitis B* Vaccine Program!  *A sexually transmitted disease. Enrollment closes in June, after which the vaccine may not be available for several years. Take the FREE blood test to determine your HEPATITIS B status and eligibility for the program.  Over 1000 gay men took the free vaccination at a time when there was no such disease as AIDS. Then, by 1978 the infection began popping up all over the gay community. Strangely enough, it was predominate among the volunteers who had taken the free Hepatitis B vaccine. Within 5 years, 60 % of these men were infected with HIV.  [Ed. It goes without saying that you should avoid ANY government sponsored vaccine program, no matter how noble the cause may seem].    The program had been repeated the next year in San Francisco and Los Angeles, and as in New York, shortly after the vaccination for Hepatitis B, the west coast volunteers also began presenting with symptoms of AIDS.

For some time there are NO phone calls allowed.<br>  Depending on how well he does as how well his platoon and company does, will determine if and when he can call home.<br>  Then for the first few times, the calls will be limited to a short time (a few minutes).  So when he calls, DO NOT waste any time, or telling him to call back later, or putting him on hold, etc.  His phone time is gold.  As he progresses through training he will get more and more opportunities to call, and for longer times.<br>  <br>  As for leave, the earliest would be after basic, but probably after "A" School.  If he is deploying, before that.|`|OBnNGcfHaa	Unless you are Married it is unlikely that you will receive a call from your guy at all.

He will be allowed some time after boot camp and then have to go to his primary school to teach him about the job he has been assigned to.
o1PuFnWmaa	There is an element of socialism in the US, you are correct in that.  Welfare is a socialist aspect, as is anything else where the GOVERNMENT "assists" you. <br>  The difference at this point in time is that there is also a major attack on the democratic part of our country, the part where the PEOPLE choose, the part where our freedoms are being curtailed.<br>  Few Americans would knowingly commit to full scale socialism, but give it a different name, as Obama has done, and they seem to be accepting it.  Though there has been a trend toward this for a long time, Obama is the very first one to OPENLY push our country toward it, and being very flagrant in doing so.  He and the "democratic" congress has already started this, in putting the beginnings of rationed health care into the "stimulus" package, along with a little section that gives the President full power to decide whether a federal investigation can or cannot go on, in ANY capacity.<br>  The steamrolling toward nationalizing the banking system is yet another aspect of socialism, controlling the finance system is a MAJOR aspect in fact, along with health care.<br>  Beginning a "civilian security force" which is also in it's infancy at this moment per an Executive Order released a couple weeks ago, is yet another major aspect, controlling the populous<br>  Yet another major aspect is controlling the media, which, as you already know is in full swing and will get even further along with the new version of the "fairness doctrine" which Obama is working toward as we speak, which btw, will include the Internet (hence, Obama's creation of his "technical advisor" job given to Eric Schmidt of Google fame)<br>  Once the media is under full control, (loss of 1st amendment) the attack on the rest of the Constitution will be in full swing, with the 22nd amendment already being attacked, as well as the 2nd, and coming soon to a town near you, the 10th amendment as well.<br>  Do I really need to go on?

What your APD (assuming you cannot afford your own attorney) needs to do is make sure she or he gets the calibration information with regards to the specific DUI unit that was used to test you at the scene.|`|YPLydxcXaa	He likely had you for 45 prior to you slowing for the turn,as for the BAC. No  0.30 isnt letal tho it can be,anything much passed 0.20 can be under some instances but in regular heavy drinkers BAC's that high(0.30) arent uncommon,tho it is a toxic level..if both PBTs show a reading for 0.30 or close then its going to be accurate,they generally do 2 tests (or possibly more than 2 depending in the officer) at least one roadside test with the portable unit,its purpose is to determine if taking you in is warranted or if you should be allowed to go on home /taken home..and the 2nd with the stationary unit at the police station (thats the one that counts in court)..If your accused of 0.30 then you had to have been very drunk,and unless you absolutely werent drinking that day,your guilty of drunk driving regardless of the BAC (as long as its over your states limit 0.08 or less in most) and even if they tossed the BAC meter most states now allow the officers perception of your level of drunkeness when supported by proof you were consuming to be admissible,as well as any tapes made of you at the sttion or at the scene of the traffic stop (a lot of cop cars now have cameras) so even getting the PBT tossed wont automatically get you off..if you havent had a OUI prior then your best bet is fight it long enough to get it lowered to impaired or whatever your states lowest charge for OUI is and referred to treatment or probabtion,vs a long court fight,which would result in conviction and max sentence for OUI/DUI ...fighting it for a little while is always the best way to get the charges reduced or dropped,but unless you can prove you werent drinking anything at all,your guilty under most states laws,regardless of BAC.

That tax credit would have been better served had it been a deferred credit over time, in which the first time home buyer, providing proof, could get up to $8,000 in future tax credits, for direct improvements to the home that they bought. I.E. In 2010 maybe you bought a new furnace, so you get a $1500 line entry credit with your bill of sale. In 2001 you had roof work to the tune of $4000, ditto the tax credit.

bTguVXMjaa	I doubt very much that any significant protectionist economic policies will be implemented in the United States. The "Buy American" clause in the stimulus package brought protests from various trading partners, and was quickly yanked. Besides that, just yesterday Obama called for a coordinated global response to the economic crisis, while Sec. of State Clinton was assuring China that our economic relationship with them would not be affected by their human rights abuses and their repressive actions in Tibet. So I'd give protectionism less than a 10% chance. <br>  <br>  As for the second part of your question, if we actually did take steps to protect American trade, we'd have to explain why we broke our free trade agreements with so many nations, and we'd suffer in various ways for doing so. Ultimately, however, it might be best for the U.S. anyway - other signatory nations violate those treaties whenever it benefits them, and as far as I can see, the whole globalization push has hurt American workers, just so a few multiinational companies that were formerly based in the U.S. could profit.|`|pnZssBg9aa	There is a very high risk this might happen.

They were also the victim of a number of economic mishaps which they were partly responsible for in the part of bad timing (e.g. joining the ERM at a high point in the pounds value), and partly beyond their control (e.g. the UK being forced out of the ERM in humiliating circumstances and the Bank of England base rate up to 15% as the value pound fell through the floor because of currency speculation).<br>  <br>  Perhaps in summary, the current situation that the Brown government finds itself in isn't hugely different to the final days of the Major government.|`|82981bdf8a4b0ac0c84ad5280e52bff8aa	You will be lucky to get anyone admitting to any direct involvement. They will end up getting lots of abuse.<br>  I did vote for them at the time as Blair promised so much and was a fresh breath of air in politics after being a tory since voting age. <br>  The thing I have come to realise as I get older is that there is very little difference from the 3 main parties when it comes to the practise of policy, all will make a complete mess and blame everything and everyone else except admit a mistake. <br>  In my opinion we need a radical shake up of the political system and a new kind of thinking in politics which is total transparency and honesty. <br>  Sorry gone off on a rant but you get my point|`|twdXT5wOaa	No, I voted against them - Lib Dem by default - having left the Labour Party when it was effectively bought by Newscorp Labor and their employers.<br>  <br>  I had loyally supported Neil Kinnock and John Smith - just as I supported Wilson, with reservations - but at least all of these believed in the values of Attlee and Bevan, and everything for which the Labour Party had always stood.<br>  <br>  What Blair and the rest of the criminals did was akin to the Archbishop of Canterbury taking the Church of England over to Satanism.<br>  <br>  Today, we see the result.

He started the break-up of the UK in readiness for it to become EU 'areas'. He created a police force that don't fight crime but prevent the ordinary citizens protecting themselves. He bypassed Parliament in discussing legislation and generally undid the rules, freedoms  and customs that made the UK what it had been.<br>  All in preparation for his great 'Project', which was to prevent any other political party from ever gaining power, and ensuring that the UK disappeared in a European Federation..<br>  The guy should be tried for treason (a fair trial of course) and then imprisoned for life.|`|JhC6BvPpaa	He was a liar.

mMnRmYvNaa	I would change the state and federal laws allowing capital punishment. It's not reliably applied in a way that assures that no innocent people will be put to death. The Innocence Project has proven 200 cases of clear innocence (that the Courts were finally forced to accept) of people who were on Death Row scheduled for execution.<br>  <br>  In three southern states the judiciary is so perverse, stupid and amoral that they have said that as long as the proper procedures were followed in the appeals process then conclusive, undeniable proof of innocence, makes no difference whatsoever, the person should be put to death anyway. One of the Carolinas said this, Georgia said it, and Texas said it. <br>  <br>  We are just not "perfect enough" to be trusted with that power. George W. Bush, as governor of Texas, used to laugh and joke while reading death penalty appeals -- and he granted no reprieves, or almost none, out of several hundred cases. We know that this stupidest of all Presidents is a lazy bum. So lazy bums get to the top of our judicial process, and when they get there, they laugh as they glance at the appeal files, and send everybody to death. This same guy couldn't bother to make sure that sending 5000 Americans to their deaths in Iraq was justified or not. He couldn't bother to do anything but play his guitar during Hurricane Kartrina.<br>  <br>  If mankind didn't contain hideaously cruel idiots, I might have a different view of capital punishment. But it does, so I don't.<br>  <br>  Plus the fact that capital punishment has been proven to not deter -- often it's just a form of suicide by police.<br>  <br>  Plus the fact that it's about three times more expensive for the taxpayer than life without the possibility of parole.<br>  <br>  In my state, Maryland, the governor is trying to get rid of it, and I support that. I was a Federal prosecutor -- have been a lawyer for 25 years -- handling civilian and military cases. I've seen "the system" at work. It is highly fallible. People like W are highly flawed -- ex-alcoholics on a Bible crutch, lazy bums, hideously amoral people. <br>  <br>  I would take the power away to execute people.<br>  <br>  I would loosen up the rules for certain Federal authorities -- like the nuclear emergency swat team -- and the FBI to take life in the course of hot pursuit or street combat. If you catch th perps while they are doing the crime, and if the crime involves massive loss of innocent life, and if the perps shoot at you -- then kill them right there on the stop -- let's not call it an execution -- let's just call it returning fire. Let's make the rules for that loose enough so that properly trained authorities can save society a lot of trouble and expense by just wiping out the perps while they are threatening innocent lives. I feel this way about Air Marshalls too. Somebody threatens an aircraft in flight -- the Air Marshall gets the jump on him -- just double tap the guy right there (two rounds to the skull), bring back the body, it's a half page report -- no muss no fuss no bother. This is combat in the field --- not execution in cold blood done by incompetent civilians. I trust the man on the spot whose life is on the line and whose training has prepared him/her to decide rightly -- and do only righteous shoots. <br>  <br>  The total number of innocent people killed using my alternative to capital punishment would be zero.<br>  <br>  This is a personal opinion. There are 7 billion people on this planet, and I'm not expecting agreement from any of them. They have their own ideas -- OK -- to each his own.|`|z9ey2Uqkaa	I would reinstate the Lochner decision and make Freedom of Contract a constitutional right.|`|U95m4LhAaa	I would make it a law that everyone is entitled to get seen by a doctor regardless of their ability to pay.

They die miserable in jail anyways. Being executed is better than spending life in jail. Also, look at America and Guantanamo Bay. Look who's violating Human Rights- The supposed Champions of Freedom and Liberty... that's SHAMEFUL.<br>  <br>  And if you think the one-child policy is a violation of Human Rights, I can prove it isn't. If you really wanted more than one child, you can go to the countryside and have two instead. Most people cannot afford to support over one child, and China will not have the ability to support this huge population. Look at India, your democratic counterpart to China. Which is doing better?

The mountaineous region offers many hiding places and ideal sites for ambushes. Plus Afghanistan is the world's largest heroin producer and undisciplined solders could get hooked, just like Russian soldiers did. Then you have the women's lib issue to content with.

yj3GT7jOaa	It depends on a number of factors.  Caseload, severity of the crime, the ability to obtain prints, and the possibility of the crime scene having been contaminated.  The investigating detective make these decision coordinating with the department standard procedure and other parties connected to finding and prosecuted the perpetrator. Most of the time it is just standard procedure.  Tracking criminals is a pretty much a universal procedure.  Any hint found at a crime scene may lead to an arrest.

PI8VfiY1aa	Ancient Rome went through various different political cycles. <br>  <br>  When Rome was founded in 753 BC (ancient) it was an absolute monarchy ruled by Kings. Romulus founded Rome, and took office by that virtue, but thereafter every other king was elected by the people. There was also a senate of 300 individuals selected by the king. The senate was more of a council to the king, as he exercised most of the political power. This continued until 510 BC, when a revolution overthrew the monarchy. <br>  <br>  From 509 - 27 BC, the Roman Republic thrived. The Republic of Rome was an oligarchic democracy- the senate, a legislative assembly of citizens, elected executives and other more prominent members of society governed Rome as a sort of aristocracy- but guided by an unwritten constitution. The Roman Republic died around 27 BC from a combination of events, the more prominent of which was the Senate making an Emperor out of Julius Caesar's nephew Gaius Octavianus (If you've ever watched the HBO series "Rome," this is when it takes place). The Roman Empire was born. <br>  <br>  From 27 BC until 476 AD, Rome was an Empire, an Autocracy, and a Dictatorship. The Emperor was largely unchecked. Although the senate was still present, they had little influence over government. <br>  <br>  The Roman Empire fell when the last Roman Emperor was dethroned by the Germanic General Odoacer in 476 AD.

ivsKcwwvaa	Oppose for several reasons. Excessive government spending, increasing the debt, and borrowing to do it, is what caused the problem.  So borrowing, spending, increasing the debt, probably isn't going to solve it. <br>  <br>  Like nature and the climate, government cannot control the free market, or it's cycles. We will end where the market dictates. At some point, it will hit the bottom, then correction. At best, this stimulus will soften the free fall, but also extend the time it takes to hit bottom. And we will still have to hit bottom regardless.<br>  <br>   Even though it relieves gas prices at the pump, tumbling crude oil prices along with a depressed housing market often are precursors to deflation. This does nothing to address the problem if deflation occurs.  If credit is still frozen and not eased soon enough,  and deflation begins to set in, if massive tax cuts are not in place, and credit is still frozen, deflation can spiral out of control, and the real nightmare begins.|`|eqDXoCeTaa	I make what my company makes.

Note: the illustration was penned by a BLACK artist, which quickly capped the outrage from the media tuned black community.<br>  <br>  The NY Post can, and I'm sure are quite prepared to, show that past presidents all have one OTHER thing in common than being white: Political art satire depicted THEM as monkeys.....and NOTHING decried racism back then.  So, is it OK to denounce white political leaders as monkeys and not black ones, like our new President?<br>  <br>  Kinda an "shoe on the other foot" thing, when we know factually that it's racist for white people to verbally fly the "N" word---but blacks feel they have privilege to let it AMPLIFY it loud from their mouths.<br>  <br>  AG Eric Holder should have done some more edit work on his speech, for I saw the clever veiled racist references HE expressed, evidently from his anger concerning the NY Post political satire.<br>  <br>  But I DO agree w/ him: It's time for an civil, intelligent forum on the REAL facts about race and racism in America today; I kind of have an idea where Holder is going with this.  But that's for another time, perhaps.<br>  <br>  The second Sharpton's comments flew out his ignorant mouth, Homeland Security should have elevated the threat alert level in NYC--emphasis on the NY Post building; I'm sure security there has been heightened.  I'm curious to see the "or else" Sharpton threatens will happen IF the NY Post ignores him.<br>  <br>  Some 26 years ago, Sharpton nearly caused a race war with his participation in the Tawana Brawley hoax.  Amazingly, Sharpton weaseled out of being arrested for what he nearly caused...and consequently enough, it was a BLACK investigative news journalist who busted Sharpton.<br>  <br>  Al Sharpton won't rest until he sees blacks and whites shooting it out across America's streets in what he envisions to be the second "civil war".  Sharpton really needs to be told to shut up---and I think President Obama needs to tell him to do so, before people get hurt.|`|xOd10VBNaa	there is no point of this cartoon other then to show a monkey being shot and refer to a stimulus bill. <br>  -  stimulus bill passed <br>  -  monkey clearly reefers to Obama (singular)<br>  - why would police shoot  him? <br>  <br>  ...  all together makes it a very stupid cartoon which main point was to stir racism.|`|75358d4fb890522547a8f3145f0b6fbeaa	No, it was no more racist than when people compared President Bush to a monkey - and enough people did that over the last 8 years.<br>  <br>  It's a shame that some people are just looking for a way to be offended about something.

mZi7R0Enaa	I am missing GWB more everyday as I do NOT feel that BO knows a damn thing!|`|TAYErNRkaa	Nope. Realistically, GW was in over his head  right around the middle of his fifth year. By the time the senate won enough seats to become the majority in 2006, the handwriting was visible on the wall. Put in a Poison pill, Nancy Pelosi, and all you need is a minister to administer " last right ." Enter the freak show ( presidential campaign ) that lasted for two years, add the subversion by the three wise men ( Reid, Franks, and Pelosi )to the power of 2 ( Fannie mae and Freddie mac ) then multiply it by the number of times the democrats blame the first stimulus package on Bush, although it was crafted by both parties, then finally the three wise men finished it off by packing so much pork in it , it would make a bull blush. By the time it was signed the stimulus package was doomed, and so was GW. That guy took so many hits, Im surprised Laura didn't have to carry him home. As a matter of fact, the democrats got pretty good at timing their hits, because McCain and Palin got blindsided a few times when their backs were turned also, unless you call branding McCain a Traitor, and accusing Palin's husband of screwing his daughter and getting her pregnant, giving birth to their special needs baby, then covering it up by pretending it was Sarah's and Todd's ! So no, those were not the good old days, but I took something very positive away from all of it. It reaffirmed my belief that supporting a political party is the instrument of division in this country that keeps from becoming the United States. We are so divided in this country we will never reach our potential strength due to lack of unity. The other lesson I learned is that there's no level that a democrat won't stoop to to win an election. I'm not talking about all democrats or their supporters, but the embarrasments up on the hill, and their leftist newspapers, would wallow in there own remains, then warm it and eat it if it would win them an election.

Employers are currently required to offer COBRA continuation health coverage for up to 18 months when you leave your job. But former employees must pay the entire cost of the insurance plus a 2 percent administrative fee. Many workers eligible for COBRA never take advantage of this health coverage through their former employer because the premium cost is too high. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act says that workers who lost or lose their job between September 1, 2008 and December 31, 2009 as a result of the economic downturn would be eligible to receive a 65 percent subsidy towards their COBRA premium for up to 12 months.

plZFYzlZaa	Well, running through the military lifestyle myself, there were a lot of questions that I asked when they came to my house.     The biggest thing of all that got me was the pay rate.     The recruiter will come prepared for all the questions you can possibly have, and even for a few you don't. He'll go over the whole recruiting process and pay rates when you get into the military, college funds, G.I. bill, uniform allotment, e.t.c.     He'll also go over with you about the military lifestyle and how it's run, and the jobs that you'll be able to choose from depending on your ASVAB score, and about the soldier service that'll help you keep yourself on your feet when you finish your career and discharge.     As he goes over his spiel, you'll wind up thinking of questions otherwise. It's nothing to be worried about, but more or less something to be proud of. He/She'll probably be at your house for a couple of hours. It's almost like a doctor going over things with you before a surgery.     The best advice I can give you is to just relax.

When the time comes when blacks and other minorities address that there are other racists besides white then, I'll back out and subside.  It's not just Republicans that are racist.  Honestly, can you say that with a straight face?  No, of course not.  My ancestors were Hungarian's, they were hung for racial reasons.  Is there blame on others who did the hangings?  No, the blame has disappeared.  The whites came here long before that and stole the Native Americana's land, raped their women, and killed their food.  Did the Native Americana's cry out racism?  No, pride comes before laziness and blame interacts. Racism in this country has been going on far earliar then when the first black slaves were brought over. But still history overlooks what happened before the black slaves were here.  Two wrongs don't make one right.  Shall I cry out racism?  Politically it's not an issue.  There are blacks in Congress.

In 1996, four years after Arpaio was first elected and while Janet Napolitano served as a Clinton-appointed federal prosecutor in Arizona, a petty drug offender named Scott Norberg was attacked and beaten to death by nearly a dozen county correctional officers. Much of the lethal violence was committed while Norberg was shackled to a torture device called a "restraint chair": Bound and unable to defend himself, Norberg was beaten by the brave men of the MCSO until he died.    Arpaio didn't order the murder of Scott Norberg, but he was deeply involved in the cover-up. "Notes taken the night of the killing were destroyed," writes Phoenix New Times' Michael Lacey. "Critical X-Rays were destroyed. County authorities, under the watchful eye of the sheriff, hid the fact that Norberg's larynx was fractured." What evidence did exist was forwarded to the FBI. The Norberg family's attorney, Michael Manning, provided Napolitano  by way of her assistant US attorneys  with much of the evidence that had been suppressed by the MCSO.     And that's where the case died.    Before the investigation found traction, Napolitano was dismissive of Arpaio's critics, insisting that he ran "a strict jail but a safe one."    The Justice Department's final report, which was issued two years after Napolitano punted on the issue, fleshed out the skeletal term "strict" in interesting ways, noting that excessive and abusive use of force was common and often involved unjustified use of restraint chairs, hog-tying and beating of inmates, and other forms of deadly restraint.    The report likewise scored Arpaio's staffing decisions, which left the jail "below levels needed for safety and human operations." The Justice Department, as former Arizona Republic reporter Tom Zoellner pointed out in Slate, "filed suit and settled with the sheriff the same day" in exchange for promises of various reforms.    Napolitano was at Arpaio's side when the sheriff called a press conference to call the settlement a personal vindication. Napolitano, recall, had been handed clear evidence of murder committed under Arpaio's authority, and a criminal conspiracy led by his office cover up that crime; she simply threw it out and refused to prosecute.|`|AA11041009	Because Bush sucked so much azz (or seemed to suck so much azz), the media doesn't feel the need to make a stink, and the general public decides not to care.

I would educate the American people on the realities of oil (which most of the public do not actually know), so that they would understand how we could have much cheaper gas.    8.    I would work to get the truth back into news reporting, and have the opinions stay in the editorial sections as they should.    9.

AcWMpmPwaa	well, i'm going to answer from an american perspective, right now we seem to be having the same problem here in the u.s.. they seem to have forgotten what the ideology stands for which i think is the same problem you are having. they seem to want to make nice with the liberals so people will vote for them...this never works. you cannot make nice w/liberals, they are never satisfied. they have to start remembering that wherever conservatism is layed out it works, even in your country. don't give up, keep pushing forward the battle lines are drawn, let them know how unhappy you are and vote out the weak ones out and get the strong ones in. hope this helps...do not give up, we conservatives can't afford to lose another soldier.|`|AA12349988	After reading the conservative website I cannot see a reason to vote for them.    Immigration - carbon copy of labour    Economy - they will borrow 50 billion and lend it to business via guarantees without asking for a share of the business - meaning the tax payer takes all the risk and the banks take all the profits.    I remember the education and health systems under the last tory government and frankly they were shocking.    Plus Dave Cameron is just a PR man - he has more spin than Blair....    What is the biggest thing effecting the country today?  For me it is the strikes and the need to change EU law - what does Dave have to say on the subject?  Nothing because he is tied into the same EU as Labour.    I am sticking with Labour - least I know what to expect with them - I dont want 5 years of spin|`|JmdnlQsHaa	new labour are many things.  marxist isnt one of them - new labour have shown far more regard for the filthy rich city of london slickers than the working man.  the tories wouldve shown even more.  thats one of many reasons why i'll never vote for them|`|efQGWAoMaa	I think there are a lot of people who agree with you, namely those who did not suffer or were not conscious of the damage that the Tories did last time i.e. Miners strikes and poll tax in Scotland.    I find it very difficult to sympathise with Brown even though I am centre-left and always have been however I remember the damage done by the conservatives last time even though I was only a girl and because of that I am going to vote tactically in the next election.    Tactical voting is going for a party you wouldn't normally support to try and prevent a rival party from getting a seat. Hence why the LIb Dems have been doing so well lately - nobody wants Labour but they don't want Tories either!|`|c9aaa62ae49fd88ebc431c66a11f06b1aa	Its got to the stage now where I dont even bother to vote.

It consists of changing the EFFECT of the Constitution without changing the CONTENT merely by altering the way "we" look at it.     As such, it's not really an "amendment" at all. It's either an "application" (such as when Congress exercises its authority to determine Presidential Succession and changes the Law) or a "violation" (such as when Congress delegates a non-delegable responsibility to the President or an Administrative Agency.)     It's a trick to make you think that the Constitution is flexible enough to go from being the document that preserves your Liberty to being an instrument to curtail it.

SYkQWhnBaa	There are two different types of welfare recipients, the "working poor" who actually have jobs but must still receive assistance in order to live and then there are those who do not want to work, drawing a check at taxpayers expense is their preferred occupation.      The "working poor" should receive training and/or skills to an occupation that will provide them with a income that provides for their basic needs.  After that, they should be cut off.      Those who will not work should be boot kicked out of the welfare office.  Taxpayers are NOT a source of income.|`|318386389c51a5739cd225edcf165aaeaa	"Require" and "volunteer" in the same sentence is oxymoronic.  You can't "require" anyone to "volunteer" for anything.

If I have to get drug tested--they should too!|`|Ulff1hcDaa	Ok, "welfare" is a generic term that many people use to refer to many many many different programs.    If you are talking about TANF (cash) assistance then my state has work requirements.  We will do a volunteer placement if the person needs work experience but our main goal is to get anyone who is able into a PAYING job.    If you are talking about a food benefit then they have work requirements too.  In fact any program through my state has a work requirement if the person is able to work.  Most of the folks I work with are working.....they simply are not able to make enough to cover the insanely high housing costs here and would go hungry without the help.|`|1amF7oNwaa	NO ALL THEY HAVE TO DO IS SIT ON THEIR FAT REAR ENDS AND COLLECT THE MONEY AND POP OUT THE KIDS|`|1bfd6f647a73749c637495a4c269b837aa	Because most of them work very long hours as it is. Requiring them to volunteer either means they can't look after their family as well, or they spend less time at work, making less money, and requiring more welfare.    Neither is good.|`|B6c7BeDnaa	how about with out a disability get a job! but i like your idea.|`|AA11268819	Yes and no.  It's more like forced.    The very problem with this so-called "volunteer work" program is, Children and Family Services is more concern that you do the work program than for the individual to go out and look for a job (to make a long story short).  The very reason this is the problem is because by the time you can get home to ready to go out and look for work, most business are already closed for the day.  And the ones that are still open are not accepting application at that time of the even because their HR manager has already gone home for the day themselves.    And if you are one of the individuals that are on the program without any form of transportation because you are that poor, they will help you get to and from the work site but other than that, forget it.  So if you can't get a job because of the lack of transportation... Get the picture?    This is what makes it so hard to get off the program.  The system is so full of hypocrites, it's ridiculous!  So unless Obama changes this part of the welfare program, nothing will improve for anyone.  This is just one reason why I didn't vote for NObama because he's just another wind bag.|`|L1SeinzRaa	I know I could use some volunteer help or even some hard working paid help......Here in Kentucky we are going to need help of months cleaning up...repairing houses, .lot's of tree cutting,,,etc.    But that means somebody will have to actually WORK...you know get dirty, sweat, use a muscle or two....I doubt anyone on welfare is going to give up a government check for a chainsaw or hammer.

NO|`|t8JlnuqFaa	Are you in a sugar comma?|`|fec25f298a046824d209e22ca386b7f1aa	First off, I did not vote for him because I am Republican with many views that run middle of the road. As an American, I want to see him succeed, because I don’t want any President to fail because that means more Americans will suffer because of it.  <br>  <br>  He claimed he wanted to change Washington and how it worked, thus far he has had multiple people be positioned for cabinet posts and they were found out to not have paid their taxes.  I believe it was Joe Biden who stated "Its patriotic to pay taxes".  Since many of those cabinet choices failed to pay their taxes, I think they were essentially saying they were not patriotic and the president should have done more home work into his cabinet choices before trying to pick them for those posts.<br>  <br>  President Obama's second major failure, in my eyes, was the decision to close Guantanamo Bay.  Instead of closing the prison and bringing terrorists onto American soil, he could have overhauled the legal system there and put in civilian style court system.  How are we going to be able to house terrorists on American soil?  By putting them in American prisons?  First off, if you did that, they would be killed if put in the gen-pop (General Population).  Prison inmates have their own code of honor and child molesters are usually bottom of the barrel and are often killed in prison by other inmates. Can you imagine how terrorists will be treated? You could put them in solitary confinement, but then you would have Amenity International, the ACLU (American Civil Liberties Union), and the terrorists lawyers claiming that its inhumane to put these men in those type of conditions for that long of a period.<br>  <br>  The third mistake President Obama has made is his stimulus package that he pressured through the senate and congress.  It started out as a good attempt to try to help people, but instead of working with both Republicans and Democrats, and crossing the aisle, as he so pledged to do during his inauguration speech, he let Democrats take control of this bill and turn it into a liberal spend-a-thon.  Many people have not taken the time to read the bill, I have not either, but there are things that worry me. Eight billion dollars to build a high speed train from Disneyland in Southern California to Las Vegas, Nevada.  Fifty million dollars to help support high school drop outs and another fifty million dollars earmarked to help save a California mouse.  I am also pissed that he now wants’ to bail out people who got foreclosed on.  I understand if you because unemployed and now can’t make ends meet, but I am pissed about helping those who took these mortgages knowing they couldn’t afford them.  Why help people who try to live outside their means.<br>  <br>  The President had an open chance to win me over after I listened to his inauguration speech, but thus far he I feel like he lied.  He claims he wants to be his own person and blaze a new path in Washington politics, but all he has been doing is appease those who helped fund him and get him elected.|`|3ivEoxzaaa	No.  The American public is not happy with the bailout of the mortgage companies, or the banks, or the auto makers.  Let them fail.  There will be struggles by all Americans for a while, but all will even itself out.  Many of his appointees and particularly cabinet members have been involved with tax evasion or ethics problems.  The billions of $$$ of pork in the stimulus package doesn't sit well with the average person.  He has not been transparent as his campaign promised.   His performance rating is considerably lower than it was when he was sworn in.  I personally feel everyone will regret electing this man.

They really hit the ground running, said Steve Beshear, interviewed by  CNN. Theyre working very hard to get all the equipment and supplies here that we need.    Crews have been working to restore power and water service to hundreds of thousands of people. Beshear said that while he realizes nothing moves fast enough, he said the federal assistance has been a great help to us so far.    Beshear, a Democrat, explained that when the first wave of bad weather came through on Tuesday and Wednesday morning, officials realized that they needed additional help.    I called the White House directly at that time. I had my other folks  talking to FEMA, but I went straight to the top because we needed fast help, he said.    He said he spoke to the director of intergovernment relations and said  she walked Kentuckys paperwork through. He said President Obama called him and  told him he was announcing an emergency declaration for the state.    I cant tell you how appreciative we were, the governor said. He not  only expressed his concern, but he obviously had the Kentuckians in his thoughts and prayers, and he communicated that to us.|`|ng7Zon0Haa	he's a prick!|`|Sm9cq8KKaa	This question makes no sense.|`|TfijWwsYaa	Obama doesn't have those powers only Bush does.  he made the hurricanes you know.|`|Nx4mJZVxaa	umm...,he cant control the weather,mother nature and god controls the weather|`|qOqm6j2Saa	Because he hates white people just ask his Reverend|`|V44ARW4maa	he doesn't|`|XEcoJnt4aa	Obama is really Father Nature. Most folks didn't realize this at election time. He makes it snow in Kentucky so Kentuckians can experience the beauty of snow. He realized that Kentucky was one of the most beautiful states there is, but thought to himself "how can I make Kentucky even more beautiful". Snow was the answer!|`|e4J0OfjDaa	Because Kentucky went to McCain in the election.

AA11963685	Of course he's real.  It seems as though no one but the Republicans expected perfection from this guy.  I don't know anyone who voted for him that expected him to walk on water.  But the cons seem to think unless he does that he's useless.  He has made some great choices for his cabinet.  Hillary Clinton was a brilliant choice for example.  What he has a problem with right now is his vetting process.  That sucks canal water.      As far as his comments regarding football, are you serious?  Presidents ALWAYS make comments about the Superbowl, and the World Series, etc.  And it's ALWAYS publicized.  Search your memory - there should be a memory of Bush and Laura appearing on American Idol for crying out loud.      Why are so many people who didn't vote for Obama so over the fricking top about any problems that arise?  It just showcases their bitterness.  If we've ever had a perfect President I'd like someone to tell me their name.|`|S7iQ9FkGaa	News flash!     Barak Hussein Obama IS THE 44th PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA!

XoYaFgkyaa	Basically, there is no money, and none involved in helping you.  In addition there is no political gain at this time from helping Kentucky.  It would be better for him not to help as much (actually administer rather than just provide support), that way you vote out republican representative for democratic ones that will in the future blame them for not handling the crisis correctly.

Only a few people within Government are as angry and ready to fight for liberty. Ron Paul is able to channel that anger:<br>  <br>  “The issue boils down to this: do we care about freedom? Do we care about responsibility and accountability? Do we care that our government and media have been bought and paid for? Do we care that average Americans are being looted in order to subsidize the fattest of cats on Wall Street and in Government? Do we care? When the chips are down, will we stand up and fight, even if it means standing up against every stripe of fashionable opinion in politics and the media?

The system is broken and needs to be rebooted and restored to the founding fathers' principles outlined in the Declaration of Independence, Federalist Papers and US Constitution.<br>  <br>  And I don't entirely blame the lenders for taking advantage of the system that the government set up that made it possible for them to do so.

Thanks but we are capable of speaking for ourselves.<br>  <br>  My whole life I have heard economists tell us that growth is the only measure of a healthy economy. It should be obvious to anyone with half a brain that perpetual growth is a myth. It simply isn't possible. Obama and Bush shared the same flawed logic, that the goal is to get back to the self-same failed economy we just left.<br>  <br>  The federal government makes nothing, it grows nothing. Wall street makes nothing, and grows nothing. Banks make nothing, and grow nothing. The current economy is destined to fail unless we recognize this basic fact and get back to a government of the people.<br>  <br>  The solution, run the federal government like you run your household. We get rid of all the failed federal agencies, pay down the national debt and start earning more on the global market than we spend.<br>  <br>  We need to become an industrial nation again. We need to make goods, and grow food that we can sell on the open market to the rest of the world.

People could forget looking to the feds for a free meal ticket. They would be too busy getting the machines fired up again. Cities like Allentown, Pittburgh, and Detroit would return from the haze they have been in for 20 years under the service economy we have built for ourselves. Money is a tool for doing buiness, not the end product of business. That is where liberal and conservative thinking both fail. They believe it is all about the money.

Banks did fail, but do NOT need a bail-out. Those failing banks would have re-structured into new institutions with better managements, not throwing them money so they can sustain their financial failures.<br>  <br>  We need to let the markets work itself out, but it won't work because the Gov doesn't let it grasp air to survive.

Everyone knows that it is a human lfie growing and developing.  We don't not know.  No body asks what are you pregnant with, a turnip? an apple? a glob of tissue?  After the pregnancy tests, each without an exception say that "I'm pregnant with child."  Why one would say otherwise is a fiction?  A fiction that only comes from political reasons, and a fiction that may arise from social architecting,engineering and legal confusion.

xwG6e7IQaa	I'm in Criminal Justice...maybe I can help!  You're wrong about private property....It's a public property.  If they caught her on the intent to shoplift....or thought she shoplifted and coincidently found extacy pills on her of course they have to charge her with it.  Just think if she was driving in the same parking lot and they found a kid in the back of her car tied up...do you think that they are going to let her go because she wasn't really shopping?  No...they are going to charge her with intent to distribute (because she had more than one) and possession of drugs.  Sorry....There is no way out of it!  That sucks though...I feel bad for your friend...it's going to stay on her record all through her life.  She could however plea out or perhaps set a deal with the DA if she gave the name of her dealer and who she sells to...Just  a list of names....Hope this helps  *best answer*|`|70aa0db8082ddead46f656ecb978193aaa	Private property or not, police still have jurisdiction.  They cannot search you without probable cause but they must have had PC based on the shoplifting thing...there seems to be something you're leaving out of the story here.  Yes, she can be charged with possession of an illegal substance even if the cop was looking for something else.  The sentencing terms are going to be based on the local laws of your area.  If she wants to fight it, she needs to either hire a lawyer or talk to the public defender.|`|JI7NQ9TNaa	First of all I thought that parking lots were private property and cops had no jurisdiction on them?      Nope...they are private property, but the mall owners allow them jurisdiction.    Can a cop search you without probable cause?    If the mananger thought she was shop lifting, that IS probable cause.      If he suspected her of shoplifting, can she get charged for having something on her that they weren't looking for?    Of course.. Possession is still illegal...and 15 pills could be considered dealer quantity.      Her bail was set at $10,000 last night. What are the minimum and maximum sentencing terms for this offense?    That depends on the state.      Is there any way she could get out of this?  With a decent lawyer...maybe...but she's no longer a minor so the rulles change.    Good luck to her.|`|kPWGVeWhaa	First - get a lawyer.      Second...what did they suspect her of shoplifting?  You cant be searched unreasonably.  IE:  If they suspected her of stealing a TV, they cant search her pockets.      E is a tricky drug to get busted with.  It has all sorts of problems.  I'm sure they will nail her for distribuation...and when they test the pills they may contain heroin, meth, or cocain.  All additional charges.      But being that she is only 19, the chances are if she gets at least a decent attorney she will probably only face drug awarness classes, fines and probation.    $10,000 seems kind of high for a 19 year old with a few pills.  Has she had any prior convictions?|`|GZzmcDeGaa	she needs to get a lawyer. and she needs to know that if cops are asking her questions she needs to not say anything. she also needs to know that cops are legally allowed to tell her lies, such as she will get a lesser punnishment if she admits to the crime now or to confess if she has anything else because of the same reason... ect. controlled substances aren't ever a little thing when your dealing with the law and she should take no chances.|`|JH9IMMDtaa	SHE DID SOMETHING WRONG!!! QUIT TRYING TO GET HER OUT OF HER OWN MESS SHE GOT HERSELF INTO!!!|`|pHmKGLMoaa	She's screwed.  And I'm sure she wasn't shoplifting, they never are right.  Totally innocent she was.

Cops have jurisdiction in parking lots. LOL for thinking they don't. Seriously. Besides, even if the didn't normally, they were called there by the owner.    2. No. But in this case the probable cause was the shoplifting allegation. He had to search to see whether or not she was in possession of stolen items.    3. Of course she can get charged for something they weren't looking for. "Gee your honor, this shouldn't count because he was only looking for the pot I had in my car. He wasn't looking for the dead body in my trunk, so I should get a pass."    See how dumb that sounds? Same principle.    4. Depends on how much she had. With her bail it sounds like she had enough for "intent to distribute." So that's some good time.    5. Very unlikely.|`|JEnsHADCaa	First, if they suspected her of shoplifting, they had to wait til she made it out of the store and into the parking lot before they could stop her, as long as you are still in the store with the items ....it's not shoplifting. So, yeah, they had every right to search her person!    Second, cops have jurisdiction pretty much where ever they are directed...if the mall called them, again, they are well within legal right.    Third, yes, they can collar you for illegal substances if even that wasn't their original intent. Think about this...a cop pulls you over for speeding...you stop...you smell like alcohol...he pulls you out of the car and searches you and finds illegal substances....he collars you! No way around it...illegal is illegal.    Now min and max sentencing is hard for me to say...it depends on her criminal history, if she had it with the intent to sale it, her support group in the community and state law..would need more information to answer that.    Sure there is, cooperate and plea out, tell them where she got the drugs, agree to community service and a drug program...if this is her first offense, she just needs a good attorney and some common sense.     Hope this helps!|`|WPbwiGafaa	well tell her to tell them to look at the camera at the stor that she was at when she was shopping|`|AA10621418	I suppose if she were accused of shoplifting in a store that only sold large sized items, and she had 2 or 3 bags, of which her purse had the drugs and was an evening bag or smaller in size, she may have a defense that they did not have probable cause to search the purse because none of the potential items that could have been shoplifted could have fit in the bag...lots of ifs though|`|fyKydb6Iaa	She needs a lawyer................|`|AA10465540	Police have jurisdiction on both private and public property.  Suspicion of shoplifting is probable cause, and if the police were called by either a store or mall security, they had sufficient cause to search her.  Yes, she can be charged with drug possession, even though the search was for  shoplifted items.  She may be able to slip out of the charges with a very good attorney, but that will be quite costly.  She will most likely be given a plea agreement that will involve probation and perhaps a small fine|`|2k9KU3ZDaa	well, first of all parking lots are not your private property,they have to belong to somebody and if somebody gave authority to someone then yada yada yada .My suggestion is to hire a lawyer,.|`|d4cf52959f97cc6ef63e1ad730f1436caa	The police have executed the arrest correctly as previous answers have stated.

55NKPb82aa	Yes, very actively before and during the Civil War. After the war of course there was no slavery to support, but the Dixiecrats were solidly against equal rights for former slaves. It wasn't until John Kennedy and the 1960s that the Democrats began supporting racial integration and equality.|`|r6JskEtxaa	Yes, that doesn't apply to all though|`|AA10079277	I am not sure they were "pro-slavery", just not opposed to it.

It was a question of conscience.  There were those in both parties who opposed it, as well as some in both parties who supported it.|`|cVEHvqxEaa	It wasn't about party affiliation.  It was about cash.  Besides, the Dems were the conservatives at the time.  Things change.  Imagine that.|`|FVDhYH6Baa	Yes<br>  you are correct<br>  the democratic party was pro-slavery|`|7DuVshl5aa	Good question, actually.  You're right, the Republicans of the 1860's generally opposed slavery under Lincoln.  The Democrats supported it.  But the parties today bear little resemblence to the parties of those days.  In the 1940's, the "Dixiecrats," racist Southerners led by Strom Thurmond, broke from the Democratic party.  The Democrats had by this time become too progressive on both social policy and race issues for these Dixiecrats.  These "Dixiecrats" were absorbed into the Republican party, and have largely remained there until this day.  So, it was the GOP of the 40's and 50's that incorporated the racist remnants of the modern Democratic party.  I think the near absence of African American support for the GOP during the '08 elections, and indeed, for decades, is evidence of this huge shift.  <br>  <br>  James McPherson's "Battle Cry of Freedom" is an awesome book that is mainly a history of the Civil War, but also has great background info on how Lincoln's party emerged in the mid 1800's.|`|fRCoMzXkaa	Slavery came to North America almost two centuries before there was a United States or a Democratic Party. During the antebellum period (pre Civl War) the Democrats were the conservative party and the Federalists/Whigs/Republicans were the nationalist parties. The northern wing of the Democrats were called "Doughfaces" because they supported Southern slavery and were generally ok with the extension of slavery into the territories. The Northern wing of the Whigs was generally opposed to the spread of slavery (which caused the Southern wing to collapse) and there were virtually no Southern Republicans (party formed in 1854) until after the Civil War. The Republicans were formed as basically a Northern party opposed to the extension of slavery and supportive of nationalist economic policies (pro-industry, indifferent towards agriculture).|`|B07sKfdvaa	Slavery has existed since the beginning of civilizations on the Earth.  Dominant civilizations enslave militarily inferior civilizations...indigenous civilizations that are militarily superior to their counterparts will sell them into slavery to other cultures...it's not okay by any means, but you can't pin it on an American political party...that's very disrespectful to the history of the world, to assume that anything in the past 250 years would dominate the entirety of history.|`|isbGvDRZaa	The Democrats were the conservative party in those days.

How do they know we would have been attacked during these 8 years?     Being the biggest country in the world, people should trust their beautiful country. Instead, they fear attacks that wouldn't happen anyway, only because people of our previous government wanted to control us. Sometimes, reading books help see these things ...
YupMCYHlaa	I think their domestic policy hurt them both, also failing economy hurt them both--more the dad than the son.  They both had very different styles of presidency, though.    Papa Bush was really a foreign policy expert, having been head of the CIA, an American ambassador to China and the UN.  He wanted to be a foreign policy president from the start.  GW promised during the 2000 campaign that he -wouldn't- be a foreign policy president, that he had no interest in foreign affairs.  But all presidents learn that foreign policy is place where they can make their mark, because it's the one are of their job where they don't need congressional approval.  So while GHW's foreign policy got mixed reviews, GW's foreign policy screwups really hurt him in the end.|`|CBx6qHztaa	What decade are you in pal?|`|XoYaFgkyaa	No, I think he pissed off someone in the corporate world, or he wasn't providing enough support to the rich people in America.  So the CEO's sent out word, found a replacement, and started their campaign to replace him.|`|PVMsr2Faaa	I think it is very interesting that both had real estate collapses along with banking failures.|`|vNaAZU3gaa	I understand what you mean, but he was not the worse president we've ever had. Imagine if we had Al Gore for 8 years do you think he would of done as mucfh of an effort on foreign policy. Do you actually think that he would of keep the US safe. To many dems are lack luster when it comes for foreign policy( they turn there heads, and say that the repulicans are just creating scare tactics). Were so much in debt but it was a neccasary expense to keep us safe..  The Dems also want to spend us into dept what the **** is that going to do.. The media is acting Obama isgoing to pull us up out of this great depression, like FDR did buy creating new jobs through infrastructure. One things for sure is that America has been through the toughest times and has always prevailed..Im just a moderate who thinks we need a whole style of goverment. I geuss you could call me a liberterian..Bush senior was a good president. I think that Jeb Bush, George Bushs' older brother the governor of Florida will try to run in 2012.. We'll see...But who am I, just go ahead and believe what ever is on the liberal news...|`|m1HVh5YUaa	The media did not report on his domestic policy, but this does not mean it didn't happen. He was as busy as a beaver. Notice how not one single thing has changed in foreign affairs? Not one. But the media has taken their attention from the Middle East, and put it on America, just like they did when Clinton was bombing who he pleased around the world while the world called the US a bully. No one heard because as my father says, they were too busy examining their belly buttons, or more specifically, they pay attention to what the media tells them to.

I thought it was about more about trying to lure blacks into voting republican in 2010 and 2012.    The attack Obama without being deemed racist just might be what their agenda is.  However, I never viewed the white republicans attacking Obama as racist.  Obstructionist, elitist and anti-American yes.  Racists, that never occurred to me.

I would say they are obsessed with demonizing the MSM because it is far closer to the truth than the propaganda source that they call news.    If the media was as liberal as they claim, why does the media ask more hardball questions of Democrats and even interrupt them while trying to answer their questions because they don't like the answers they are given, but when they question republicans, the republicans don't even attempt to answer the question and go directly into spewing party talking points.  Then the interviewer just sits quietly waiting to ask the next question that will be totally ignored and more party talking points spewed.

You can do it yourself... and that will help you file your taxes tooo... what you need to do is go to your local taxes filing office and ask them that you need a TAX IDENTIFICATION NUMBER.. that will help you fill your own taxes and you can claim your own kids... Do NOT let anyone else file your kids tax.. it is not only dagerous but ILLEGAL and you can get in lots of trouble!|`|ERjGLJaEaa	Wow!! This is messed up. The first though that comes to mind is just like the guy before me said. If they are willing to defraud the government what makes you think they won't stick a rod right in your rear to. If you could use some extra money you should try seeking a job!!! Not using your daughters to try and get you some money. Oh the nerve!!|`|I8M5kw5Saa	WTF are you crazy.I hope someone that knows who you are and turns you in.You are the reason we americans are so tired of people like you.Your daughters and their fathers what a joke.Do us all a favor and have your tubes tied please.|`|AA10187742	NO that in itself is illegal.  The only way someone can "claim" a child as a dependant is through legal means.|`|ZzHE0lvtaa	If you don't work then you are not entitled to a tax refund and it is illegal, you probably wouldn't get caught but it is not legal.  The reason I say you probably wouldn't get caught is because I work with a girl who just recently claimed someone elses child on her return because the mother doesn't work, she said she is going to get back almost $6,000 and she will split it with the mother and that she has done this for the past 3 years using different kids each time, looks like the IRS would catch it but so far she has been a lucky cheater.|`|XTDeAfTqaa	You should try it. You might get a position on Obama's Cabinet!    No. It is illegal.|`|CbeNLpb3aa	Sure|`|MeeJWmGtaa	Not just no, but hell no.    Look, if they are willing to defraud the federal freaking government (the balls!), they sure as hell won't even think once about cheating you out of your cut. That's just to begin with. Also, you're pretty much setting up your daughters to be victims of identity theft.    Also, it's extremely illegal.|`|LX6AQ4kuaa	No way, once an SSN gets assigned to someone, nobody else can use it, that's a serious crime.|`|fe1FiF0Paa	If you do that you'll end up a guest of the Feds or State just like so many other illegals that clog up our system and use up our resources without paying a dime in taxes.  Make yourself legal or go home.|`|6sjphNcPaa	no one is suppose to you a SS  except that person. It is illegal and will cause MAJOR problems! Once you give out a SS  you have no idea what it will be used for.|`|VKriZIefaa	You make me sick. Using your daughters for money. Just be like the movie nor bit and sell them for yak next time|`|7Z9U4f5paa	Go home or get a job. That's the way we do it here in this country.|`|413999ce3344ac9070b2bf70d21ebe12aa	You are an ***, It is definitely fraudulent.  I hope to hell you get caught before they ever do amnesty.  You do not deserve to be in the US, you need to be deported.  Only her father can claim her if he's paying child support.  Two people can not legally claim the same person.|`|GMJCjMqmaa	sure, if you want to go to jail!|`|BeyVvfLFaa	That would be potential fraud on many levels, particularly with many possible government agencies/branches.  Lazy government moochers are pathetic, but the illegals here trying to pull fast ones at the citizen/taxpayer expense is deplorable!!  Deport ALL illegal alien invaders!!!
AA11206283	If "THEY" want to watch; they will.    Always have; always will.    Who cares. I'm not doing anything interesting. (Unless you count the sex stuff).|`|ZA11WBR2aa	No, I'm actually bothered by it.|`|1VaH8D3Raa	You mean there is a   .'  Big Brother watching us  .  Wo now what   .  Can I take a crap knowing Big Brother is watching me  .  Man talk about Science Fiction coming true   .  What next   .  Soylent Green for lunch  .|`|5d9pCmjyaa	I'm going to use the same argument as the Republicans always use.    You should have no problems with it if you have nothing to hide.  or  The only people who have problems with it are the one's who have something to hide.  Of course, they're talking about Govt. tapping phones, intercepting e-mails, and going through your mail without a warrant or needing court approval.    Unfortunately, they have a point when it comes to PUBLIC surveilance, imo.  Guarantees of liberty does not include anonymity.|`|S8RL9lieaa	We already have camera for every 14 people and if the government keep going it will soon be down to 4. Then who knows we might get one each so they can observe our evey move. Should make interesting viewing don't you think.|`|zahy4Brqaa	I have a gut feeling that in a case of national emergency, all these surveillance eqpmt will only come handy to save the official's behinds. The rest of the people can all go to hell for all they care. Governments need surveillance to stay in business. It has become a necessity for survival to them. Fifty years ago if the government tried to pull a stunt like this on the people they would have been blown away in a day as spies and traitors. But today, and with all that fear and terror which they have implanted in people's minds and hearts as an alibi, surveillance was not only acceptable but welcomed with open arms. Mission accomplished.|`|7i6qj4OXaa	Yes, I'd like a camera on every corner.  I am sick of the crime and thuggery.|`|iVapI5JPaa	Are you talking about Britain with the cameras?    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-ZDgVrP5...    Watch that its funny:)|`|2pOl8PU6aa	We don't need surveillance. That would be leaning towards 1984.    We just need social change.    And we also need. .       BATMAN!    :D|`|d4cf52959f97cc6ef63e1ad730f1436caa	I suppose it depends on if you are doing something you shouldn't be doing. They are good for capturing violence etc and the courts also accept them as evidence, so that has to offer some reassurance. I understand that people think that they are being watched 24/7 but if they are not doing anything wrong, what is the problem they have with it all.|`|3qa3BftUaa	It does'nt bother me. I would rather feel safe. If I'm caught on camera 200 times whilst I am out shopping and another 100 on my way home why should it worry me. Me doing my shopping and going about my business is not that interesting. I'm not going to steal anything, mug an old lady or kick someones head in so I don't care if I'm being watched. Only the guilty have something to fear. If you're not going to do wrong, theres nothing to worry about.
026ccc37bd36bd551332232d59c0c4a2aa	At the present time I don't think there is any clause in British law as to why a foreigner cannot sit as a judge in England providing they have the qualifications required. Unless the future law is reformed in England, the said person in question should be able to sit as judge for Queen and country.|`|5cf10b9f247ea700ce15c2a77c990d36aa	My understanding is that foreigners wanting to practice law in the UK are required to meet qualifications criteria.<br>  If they meet the criteria, they are then entitled to practice, and may apply for more senior positions, including that of a Judge.<br>  All Judges, as I understand it, have to apply for appointment, and each and every one has to provide substantial evidence of his/her knowledge, experience and practice of British law.<br>  So, if he/she has been practicing British law for 20 years, there would seem to be no more difficulty for him/her becoming a Judge than anyone else.<br>  BUT I may be wrong.<br>  I suspect that he/she will know anyway. People of Judge quality would have the knowledge about what is required.<br>  It seems unlikely that a foreign national could, as it were, come to this country tomorrow ( no matter what his/her legal background in the country he/she came from ) and be appointed as a Judge from the word "go".|`|yldVFIcXaa	Nothing actually stopping them due to laws and guidelines, but they might not have enough experience of the English justice system.|`|64f1b88825b292a751bffc216f38edbaaa	they should be given the same chances as any one else<br>  hope things go well|`|bYtCfdwbaa	I would imagine Irish and British rules on this are much the same and here in Ireland one of the judges who sits in our local jurisdiction is from Lebanon originally.
zAhlNl6oaa	He obviously did not come into U.S. illegaly-if his visa expired-.Since you are getting your citizenship, you can sponsor him, from his country-assuming he gets deported-after you get your citizenship. Since immigration is getting ready to deport him, there probably is no way for you to stop it right now, but to make sure...talk to an immigration lawyer-first consultation is always free of charge...|`|G4TJ8nibaa	He is going to be deported and banned from the US for 10 years. Nothing you can do but go there and live with him. If you were a citizen AND married prior to his deportation you might of been able to file for a waiver. As it is his chances of returning to the US at any time do NOT look good!|`|iWLeHnlnaa	Contact an immigration lawyer as soon as you can.<br>  <a href="http://www.usimmigrationlawyers.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.usimmigrationlawyers.com/</a><br>  <br>  HA HA! Docar does not know what he's talking about. He cracks me up.|`|7HdgMaOnaa	Let the criminal leave he is a drain on the economy your bf pablo took pauls job away|`|m1Iu4eVSaa	i am currently in the same situation only my fiance was nto deported he came back on his own to fix the visa.he was punished to mexico for 10 years because they had found out he had been here illegally but  there is a loophole youll have to go and tlak to the american consulant .there is nothing you can do now to stop the process he will get sent back.i would suggest talking to a well known immigration  lawyer becuase alot of them only pretend to know.|`|X532nRVBaa	Rulez R Rulez...|`|jHDeIPEfaa	If he is here illegally, we don't want him here. I suggest you follow him and forget about bringing him here.|`|AA10187742	Sorry, he needs to be deported if he came into our country illegally.  THOSE are the rules.
nr96BgWfaa	no, but they will push for a US sponsored Paki abortion plan.|`|pYRZcfsJaa	we need to bomb Pakistan into the ******* stone age, they are now giving in to the Taliban and haven't really done **** to fight them, they only sent minimal amounts of troops to fight.|`|UJbNNtxNaa	The 111th congress will not support another war. Trust me.
0lU0ndAxaa	ABSOLUTELY, but then you would have to have someone to keep the illegals from jumping the fence since its much easier for them  to get licensed than a american citizen.|`|lEaT5q06aa	nope<br>  <br>  the last thing that we need <br>  <br>  is a politician's union|`|jEqISBnQaa	Of course, most of the tests you list are fairly worthless. Hairdressers? Puhleezzee, GIVE ME A BREAK - a "test" that would better be known as The Hairdresser's Full-Employment Act is meaningless and so are most of the others.<br>  <br>  But, to get to your main point. I seriously doubt it would change WHO it is that wishes to represent us and that's the main problem; so, no, I think it would be a waste of time licensing politicians. Although - it WOULD be entertaining being reminded just how stupid they really are; "It took you HOW MANY TRIES to pass the test!?!" roflmao|`|lJGnuMbbaa	no we need to vote all the dinosaurs out and get people that care about Americans and their needs. politicians that will not spend money on needless bills in order to take over.
dfo8gSaraa	No.  However the GOP thinks so since they now have their 'black guy' to offset Obama.  It failed with Sarah Palin to offset Hillary.|`|e9YFTyzZaa	DREAM ON!  It will take a helluva lot more to 'SAVE' the Republicon Party.   bushie has done enough damage to last for quite a while. At least 'they', well the Majority anyways, realize there is a BIG Problem but, the BIGGEST part of their problem was bush and now he's GONE!|`|9XvWqZChaa	No - no chance|`|BpcgaJd4aa	Save is implying that the Party is doomed, which it is not.  It would be more appropriate to say he's taking on the task of improving the image of the Republican Party.|`|wbIEau0qaa	lets vote him president and see how many racists are democrats!!|`|Ge6oHWQ1aa	Failed out of college, failed the bar. Ran for senate, lied about his affiliation, lied about his endorsements, lost by double digits anyway. And stem cells are the same as the Holocaust.    I certainly hope they are not pinning their hopes to this guy.|`|D5A9JUDMaa	The Democrats are CLEARLY the party of Liberal ideas.    Steele will take this opportunity to draw the CLEAR distinctions between Liberal and Conservative ideology, finally giving voters a CLEAR CHOICE of an alternate party.      This "reaching out" crap was a losing strategy.   If dems didn't cross over to vote for ULTRA-moderate, war-hero McCain... they'll NEVER bother to cross over, so to heck with them.    STAND TRUE AND FIRM on Conservative principals.
cjlANTG6aa	He'd have my vote|`|lSnHR3mTaa	i think he's amazing. how could anyone call him liberal though? he is obviously conservative. just the way he should be. he wouldnt do it though.|`|AA11813034	i would consider it, but for the fact that he is a bit to "into himself" for me. I like humbleness.|`|UWIWC1Iyaa	No one in their right mind. O'Reilly is a caricature of a thinking man.|`|1eouzAd1aa	hell yea go bill|`|6v7PvU7Jaa	I would be fine with Bill or Dr. Savage anyone but the socialist who are destroying this country|`|5d9pCmjyaa	I would<br>  <br>  so I could watch his crushing defeat - and his post defeat tirade.<br>  <br>  I'd sell popcorn.|`|x12mMdApaa	yea, I like Bill|`|v1dnnMQuaa	I would love that! A great attempt to ridicule a blowhard that sexually harasses the help and writes porn like "Those Who Trespass" while claiming to stick up for "traditional American values!" Oh, that would be so much fun! And then to watch him get virtually zero votes which would crush his ego and make being the "King of Cable News" seem not so great anymore! I'm all for it.|`|6eoMqJF0aa	no I don't think so.|`|937d8516b6bac65675aebed05fbfdfc9aa	i would like bill as much as i would like nancy pelosi<br>  ughhhh what a nightmare|`|1amF7oNwaa	HE WOULD NEVER CONSIDER IT.  PLUS COULD YOU SEE HIM LOCKING HORNS WITH THE FAR LEFT LOONS IN CONGRESS|`|uithGZOwaa	"This is man that will tell it like it is and stand up for all Americans."<br>  <br>  Apparently you didn't see his February 13th show, where he basically attacked people who live in the Appalachian mountains.<br>  <br>  I used to watch O'Reilly occasionally but when he stereotypes a whole region of hard working people based on the circumstances of a few,  I find him to be offensive.|`|kNCCrjOeaa	NEVER!!! i think he would be worse than bush!<br>  that man has an ego the size of china and he always interrupts people!|`|TJtifnxPaa	No, because then his show will not be on anymore. A day without the O'Reilly Factor is like a day without sunshine. <br>  <br>  I would like to see more people pay attention to him and Fox News in the next few years and understand why they made the wrong choice this election.|`|b3fcaed1380d38d593a8cb71556b4d96aa	I'd like to see him do it so I could enjoy watching him get his a*s kicked.  <br>  The man is a right-wing egomaniac.  Or maybe just a plain old maniac.  President?  Now, that's a scary thought.  Fortunately, even a country that would put GW Bush in office for eight years isn't THAT stupid.|`|FVDhYH6Baa	that would be exciting to watch.....|`|HGIuXxnRaa	He would have my vote so fast.|`|kH0IxFa9aa	No<br>  He'd want to do it "Live"<br>  lol<br>  and if you are a follower of his, you  have seen the YouTube clip.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  I just had a nasty flash of white gooey stuff all over the oval office. Something worst than Mr. Bill.|`|17ff1a09056aeb1f5d9144a39ec4436eaa	Fair for all Americans?  He's a documented liar and isn't even decent to people who disagree with him.  He's a bully.|`|VfA96qyOaa	lol he wouldnt make it|`|7c5d1a76836b7ed2ed52eb7c751f6331aa	I like him, but no. Every once in a while, he refuses to hear things he doesn't agree with, which in my opinion, sticks him on the fence with the issue. I like it when he does maintain his roots and says it like it is though.|`|H31hxKHJaa	Oreilly is a pandering showboat. I mean, geez, "Body language sehments"? "Culture quiz"...come on!  Dont get me wrong, I like a lot of his ideas, but he is nothing but an entertainer - for his own gratification. Nothing wrong with that but not as president.|`|TYGgRjqDaa	I'd like to see it, but if he wins I swear I'll be in another country.|`|1c6Jwbevaa	I am republican but O'reilly is a complete moron, he is just the same as all the idiot dems that only see things their way we need someone who isn't afraid to hear what the American public has to say.|`|FgRe5D33aa	four- cheney, rove, bush, and hannity. scratch that-five- ann coulter too, she would run for herself, but she doesn't think women should be president or have jobs.|`|Sd7c0867aa	Sorry, it's not a very good idea.  They would have to make enormous renovations to the White House just to make room for O'Reilly's ego.|`|OHn91mP1aa	A falafel in every pot and 2 loofahs in every garage!<br>  <br>  F*** it!    He'll do it live!|`|03vbT9olaa	He would not like the decrease in pay.|`|5lflypTiaa	Oh yeah, I hope he does! Obama won't be able to fix the Bush Depression in the next four years and will need another term.|`|4eLzY2hfaa	why would he give up the power, and take a pay cut!|`|8a47bf1d6854793a25a251563ff9d837aa	No, he might sexually solicit us over the answering machine.|`|mUMMLjDdaa	he is the last person i would like see run for president.|`|e2tE6EI8aa	IT WOULD BE AWESOME.....HE WOULD NOT BULL SH*T AROUND LIKE THE REST OF THESE PRESIDENTS....HE WOULD DEMAND!! FAIRNESS FOR THE PEOPLE...AND HE WOULD TELL OTHER COUNTRIES WHAT'S UP TOO....HE WOULD HAVE MY VOTE 110%.|`|lECmz3SEaa	I would but he is too smart for the Democrats it would be a landslide victory and they will complain about that|`|VM300US7aa	His you tube videos would say otherwise
AA11288277	Absolutely...fair is fair.  ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, & MSNBC should be forced to hire conservative co-anchors for their news programs.  The New York times should be forced to publish conservative editorials.  Anytime a Hollywood blow hard like Alec Baldwin or Rosie O'Donnell spout their liberal B.S. Mel Gibson or Chuck Norris should be there to spout the conservative point of view.  For every liberal professor a college hires a conservative professor should be hired as well.  After all this "doctrine" is supposed to be about "fairness" right?  Why are liberals so afraid to allow the conservative point of view to be heard?  Are they afraid to lose some of their sheeple?|`|1ce25e71aa4dd2eb1e82121617a06b87aa	Talk Radio gets people to start thinking and this leads to mass anxiety attacks.<br>  <br>  I had never listened to Rush, Hannity or Savage before "O" said I should not.<br>  <br>  Thank you, Mr Obama!|`|70DZWz2Baa	because it is only talk radio that is conservative. Silence opposition so they can't be revealed for their lies. come on thumbs down.|`|AA10382849	That pig won't fly.|`|c3vPZfghaa	Yes when you find the opposite political view of a mathematical equation, we'll sit down and consider it.<br>  <br>  But the fairness doctrine isn't even a concern, just more drivel from the right to charge up their sheep.<br>  <br>  Why would we want something that actually improved American morals and helping Americans be more informed? That is fascism! (not really but it sounded about s intelligent as the guy above claiming liberals are fascists.)|`|TJtifnxPaa	The Unfairness Doctrine is not going to fly. Even Barack Obama is against it. It's one of the few things he's said that I agree with so far.|`|3MM64geHaa	If we are going to throw out the first amendment, we should do so in every form--not just the one that is the most successful.|`|AA10008110	yes, force everyone to buy NY Times before it goes bankrupt.|`|LqBIKJbcaa	Take note that it's liberals who want to limit free speech.|`|r6JskEtxaa	What a unnecessary question.<br>  <br>  We all hate the Fairness Doctrine|`|4zO1Yvjsaa	Sounds good to me.|`|sOaqLLS6aa	yea...i agree, we all know the true liberal agenda. They are the true fascists|`|3oz4r6Nraa	It's a business... if people wanted to listen to liberal talk radio, Air America would not have failed.  It's not about being liberal or conservative, it's just that conservative talk radio does better than liberal talk radio.  It's not political and talk radio should NOT be censored.  <br>  <br>  Besides, if they actually listened to Limbaugh or Savage they would find that they aren't 100% partisan... Savage hates everyone equally and Limbaugh goes against the Republican party line every now and then.  They give their own opinions, not a conservative agenda.  (And by the way, I can't stand either)<br>  <br>  I hate the "Fairness" Doctrine.  And MSNBC is more biased than Fox News!  (Look it up!  Pew Research!)|`|e6894a4cbc6e299276d8fc7fdb4c6a5eaa	I agree.<br>  But if they did reinstate the Fairness Doctrine, the "conservatives" they would put in those places would be moderate, if anything. It wouldn't be true conservatism, and so it would actually hurt us, if anything.<br>  Additionally, this is just a small interesting fact that has nothing to do with anything:<br>  did you know that college professors are five times more likely to be atheist than the general public?|`|sa4meK3jaa	I think it should apply to everyday conversation with others.  Just kidding. The only reason this is even considered is because liberal talk radio was such an abysmal failure. They just couldn't find enough people to call in to demand higher taxes and more government control over their lives to sell enough advertising to make money. Not even pablum puking liberal crybaby Al Franken could save Air Amerikka. So instead, they want to stomp on the First Amendment and muzzle the only talk radio enough people bother listening to, because they don't like what people like Michael Savage or Rush Limbaugh say. Just like the Nazi's, they fear the spoken word more than anything else. The Nazi's made all other political parties illegal. They told radio stations what they could broadcast. They controlled the newspapers. Sound familiar? It sure does to me. History has a way of repeating itself, if you remain ignorant of it.|`|0eFcXyZ6aa	The fairness doctrine should never even be considered. We all have the right to listen to what we want. If this changes it won't be long before everyone is denied the right to voice their opinion. I for one will fight for the right of free speech. A lot of people are getting sick of what's going on and feel the same as me, so I am afraid soon,,,,,, it's on.|`|cBvxv316aa	Ironically, Senator Chuck Grassley was talking about that in the town hall meeting yesterday and I was recording this.  :)|`|defae93221649626bf40294eaaa8ae9daa	I think it is because the Libs are so powerful they think they can do everything they want without question. to anybody... <br>  <br>  <br>  and they will eventually.|`|sI3kqp7xaa	We shouldn't have the Fairness Doctrine at all.<br>  <br>  It's censorship....the Government can not determine what is acceptable political speech.|`|AN9HVBZoaa	The fairness doctrine should be delegated to the garbage can where it belongs!|`|AA11401901	1st amendment applies to all..freedom of speech they call it.<br>  liberalism is a mental disorder.|`|DebIsZViaa	The dems are utterly transparent when they call for this "fairness doctrine."  If the American people cant see through this crusade against free speech, then we have a serious problem.|`|5KjvNg2oaa	government doesnt work|`|vlwmSIX0aa	No, that would defeat its sole purpose.|`|ZqA7qDWAaa	Very well said.|`|maBzn6v7aa	Should censorship be banned from the U.S??<br>  <br>  Oh wait!! WE DO have a first amendment.|`|R9i9EAeoaa	don't ask Libs...<br>  <br>  they give you inconsistent answrs|`|lEaT5q06aa	public school, yeah<br>  everything else is voluntary participation<br>  it is illegal to not present the children for public school indoctrination|`|AA11313983	If they're going to implement it, it needs to apply to ALL media.
AA11268819	I would find it funny if someone did throw a shoe at him.|`|fLH4ILzbaa	Yes, because he would be disrespecting the office.|`|AA11369432	That would be a low thing to do. Yes, It would bother me.|`|hZJ6xx1Kaa	As much as I dislike Obama, I would be thoroughly pissed if a foreigner disrespected him. . .regardless of what nation he was visiting.<br>  <br>  Besides, just wait a few weeks and the Iraqi shoe-thrower will be serving ten years in an Iraqi prison.|`|VUgCSQ6Daa	Yes, I concur. Regardless of your feelings about the man in the position, the position itself is being disrespected.|`|f9oAVdH5aa	Weren;t you pissed at Jesse Jackson when he called Obama the N word and threatened to cut off his nuts.|`|OnWmqs4paa	No, I would like to see how he would react if he didn't have NAACP or "Affirmative Action"  covering him...|`|KnwsvnTjaa	I don't like or dislike Obama.  I'm just disappointed things are getting worse.  Did you see the delighted half smile on Bush's face when the guy was throwing those shoes?  I think he enjoyed the break from the monotony.|`|rghk8yMeaa	i would think it a little funny but completely out of line! he shouldnt be assaulted unless its verbal because i think we americans deserve the right to know whats going on and have the right to call him out on his faults and stupidity.|`|AAzYDYXcaa	i think is someone threw shoes at him it would be funny.<br>  i thought it was funny when someone threw shoes at bush too tho, so NO, I'M NOT RACIST.<br>  something about throwing shoes at a president tho..<br>  gotta love it.|`|40559ac88dd0ea7e2a8e896483eee069aa	Yes! Because he is OUR president even though i dislike him  he still gets  respect as the president of the country that i love.|`|AN9HVBZoaa	The shoe incident was not only an insult to our president, but to all Americans. It would be the same no matter who was president!|`|AA11813034	i agree, and it got soooo out of control with the Bush hating. it made my stomach upset.|`|Qbf4KSRUaa	What if the just talked some sense into him?|`|CPJ9jDfgaa	Yes, I would be ticked off.  I may not like Obama but he is the president of the USA and that office alone demands respect, regardless of who is sitting in the chair.|`|l9Xg8Dv4aa	I think Bush was in that foreigner's land when the shoe was thrown.<br>  Not here. Who was the foreigner, now?|`|pslJQ0Jfaa	NO. I'd laugh because he'd probably catch them with his big ears. Then we could watch his WWE physiqued wife beat the living **** outta the perp with her massive primate jaw.|`|36uns5nRaa	Sorrry, but no.
1Fg7Tybvaa	It doesn't matter if the stimulus works or not the end result is that our country will be so deep in debt that everyone's taxes will go sky high just to pay for it.<br>  <br>  Consider that Japan faced similar problems with their financial institutions and the Japanese government did the same thing we did; Bailed them out. That was 20 years ago and they still have the same problems.<br>  <br>  I am not a Republican, I am a conservative Independent and it is my opinion that we should have let the likes of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac fall flat on their faces, the stronger banks could have bought up the assets and loans from these two companies for pennies on the dollar and then re-write the loans for those most in need. <br>  Those that took out loans that they knew they could not afford should not receive any type of a bailout and the crooked CEO's of the failing financial institutions should be thrown in jail.<br>  <br>  Our constitution allows the government to print money however the Federal Reserve Bank is not a government entity and should be removed, all they do is print more money and then charge us interest to borrow it. <br>  For years our country was on the gold standard, this meant that each dollar that we printed was backed by our gold reserves then in 1971 Richard Nixon said we should get rid of the gold standard now our dollar is basically worthless.<br>  <br>  I would suggest that everyone take a hard long look at the stimulus package, very little money makes it down to the little people that have to pay it back.<br>  <br>  Will it work ? I don't know but in the end all we will have done is to transfer the problem from one place to our national debt, my hope is that things do get better so we will have more workers paying the debt.<br>  <br>  Here is where I lay the blame for this mess that took years to create<br>  <br>  Nixon for getting rid of the gold standard<br>  Carter for his Community Re-investment Act (remember we had the Saving and Loan crisis during his term)<br>  Clinton for demanding that Freddie and Fannie more than triple their riskier loans.<br>  Barney Frank for not listening to the Republicans in 2005 when they raised the flag on this issue and wanted to increase regulations.<br>  GWBush for not blasting this information to the public so that we could put pressure on our congressmen and women to do something about it.<br>  The current Democrat congress for adding to much PORK and not adding any restrictions to how financial institutions use these funds.<br>  <br>  Kudo's to Obama for limiting the CEO's of finance firms salary to $500K per year and their bonus to be no more than 1 years salary.|`|tdQTZPI7aa	We will be extremely proud that the politicians finally got something right.  But if it fails then what?  Who suffers but future generations that get stuck with the tab.  We pig out at the banquet and the grandkids get the bill is not right either|`|lEaT5q06aa	it is hard to imagine that this will work<br>  and certainly nobody has offered any "benchmarks" or "time-lines"<br>  but if it works the Dems will have my sincere apology<br>  <br>  future generations will pay dearly, regardless of wether it works or not<br>  <br>  and there will be CRAPII, and then CRAPIII, on into the future|`|u23sBafTaa	Well if it does you had better look out for the pigs that fly !  They will be every where !|`|AA12229787	What if pigs could fly?|`|AA10187742	If it works I say great.  The problem is that Obama will be spending many more trillions of dollars in the coming days.weeks, months.......he has only just begun.    We, our kids and grandkids and future generations will be STRAPPED with paying this bill off.  Our way of living is going to be downgraded severly because of all this trillions and trillions in spending.  THAT'S THE PROBLEM.  Furthermore, when this spending bill is SO FULL OF PORK........that in of itself is a crime against we the taxpayer.<br>  <br>  Sorry, but it's not a Republican or Democratic thing here.  This affects the prosperity of all concerned.|`|1ce25e71aa4dd2eb1e82121617a06b87aa	First, put down that bong.<br>  <br>  Where is the so-called stimulus???<br>  <br>  Something that doesn't exist cannot work.|`|1219d6000cca01c9f3c4489d1c7b4a16aa	Economists the world over would analyze it for the rest of their lives.  It could very well be the birth of a new economic theory.<br>  <br>  But you really need to define "work".  Does the economy recover (probably)?  How do you measure the stimulus' impact on that, when economists the world over can't tell us what is going to happen whether it does or does not work.|`|otYOxmnuaa	Did you know the DOW hit a low that hasn't been seen since 2002?  <br>  <br>  The market believes the stimulus will fail -- as will the housing bill -- just wasted money.<br>  <br>  Did you know that Gold is on the rise?  Gold serves as a hedge against inflation.<br>  <br>  Investors know where this is headed -- and they know the bill was loaded w/ government spending...they're positioning themselves to maintain their wealth.<br>  <br>  If the economy rebounds, it won't be b/c of the stimulus.|`|NA38sBLqaa	That is an oxymoron, the misnamed Stimulus Bill is welfare over work, failure over success, polictics over reason,  corruption over honesty .

But the economy will recover in spite of it not because of it.<br>  <br>  There is little doubt that we will recover, Spending like this has failed several times in the past.

The same thing's going to happen that's happened a million times before; there will be major spin on the matter and then all will be forgotten and things will go back to normal.  What?  Did you think the party would collapse?  It's nonsense to believe that the principles used in the stimulus will work for every situation, and that's why one party hasn't come to completely dominate the country since their establishments.|`|CVVl4U4caa	What if pigs could fly?

However, since the economy has been worse as recently as the 80's, I can't help but believe that it would recover anyway.  I'd love for someone to point out what signs we'll look for to prove that the stimulus is working.  Since we don't know what's really in it to begin with, I think that there will be problems proving that it has anything to do with the recovery.|`|IAfCPyAAaa	the dems will take credit for any positive economic movement, regardless of its cause. some repubs will argue the stimulus had no effect and the markets recovered naturally. though i'm sure some will give obama props for it.<br>  <br>  i don't think there will be any way to know how well it works, if it works at all. look at the differing opinions on what got us into this mess in the first place. dems blame repubs and vice versa, the media experts leave most folks confused.<br>  <br>  if there's a legitimate link between something obama did and our recovery, this conservative will have no problem admitting it. though i really think he's only making more trouble. when government intervenes things only get more complicated.|`|ShhOXGuQaa	I guess Obama gets re-elected, appoints more supreme court justices, repeals the constitution and he will become a dictator for life..two days ago, hugo chavez did that in venezuela, and OUR OWN STATE DEPT.

For example, there is an appropriation of $1 billion to “improve” the census. Which must be judged in the context of Obama’s move to take the responsibility for running the census from the Commerce Department and place it in his corrupt hands.<br>  <br>  That billion dollars isn’t going to create jobs: it’s going to be used politically to ensure Democrats get a big advantage in redistricting congress after the 2010 census. <br>  <br>  The stimulus package isn’t aimed at creating jobs. Its purpose is to buy votes for Democrats and create more government-dependent constituencies.|`|R9i9EAeoaa	it won't.<br>  <br>  mathematically it won't|`|vlwmSIX0aa	In my question Santa Claus wears purple, but that don't make it true.

3MM64geHaa	You could be arrested for indecent exposure and if they wanted to, they could probably find your DNA. However, I don't think they would go to the trouble.|`|tdQTZPI7aa	Of course you can.

You never mentioned what state you are in, so it's impossible to give you a specific answer with regards to your statute.  Here in Florida, "relieving" yourself in public is considered a sex crime - you are exposing a sexual organ.  <br>  <br>  Florida Statute 800.03 prohibiting the "exposure of sexual organs."  <br>  <br>  800.03  Exposure of sexual organs.--It is unlawful to expose or exhibit one's sexual organs in public or on the private premises of another, or so near thereto as to be seen from such private premises, in a vulgar or indecent manner, or to be naked in public except in any place provided or set apart for that purpose. Violation of this section is a misdemeanor of the first degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083.

The other is just plain arrogant and ignorant.      EDIT:  Reality has a liberal bias, Clinton broke the law!!!!     And he did it in a civil court of law for having sexually harrassed a female. I am really sorry, but you liberal socialist democrats will crucify a republican for a speeding ticket while you let Ted Kennedy actually kill another human and get away with it.     You hypocrits!!!!!|`|8EbJJ0zZaa	F**k Bush.|`|lvyEnAtAaa	Richard Nixon was not, repeat not, the worst President in our history.    When he found himself in the position where he had to choose between abuse of the Presidential pardon to obstruct justice and honourable conduct, Richard Nixon chose not to violate his oath of office.  Had he pardoned John Dean and company the way George Bush did Scooter Libby the comparison would be fair.    Nixon handled foreign affairs and economic stablity better than most Presidents of either party.  George W. Bush did not.  To compare Nixon to Bush demonstrates a poor grasp of Presidential history.    The only President to compare Bush to is James Buchanan, who immediately preceded Lincoln.  Buchanan's partisan divisiveness and personal lack of honour did more to promote the outbreak of the Civil War than anything the abolitionists said or did.  Look him up.    For plain moral blindness and intellectual stupidity not even Harding can be compared to Bush and Buchanan.  Nixon was so much better than them that you insult your history teachers by bringing him up.|`|19L99wvCaa	I am not sorry about my criticisms of Bush and Cheney. In fact, I suspect that further evidence will come to light, to not only support those criticisms, but raise new ones.     You are free to criticize the new President all you like. I may or may not disagree with you in the course of his presidency.     It sounds as though you want President Obama to bring disaster to the US. Legitimate question: If he instead improves our lives and standing in the world, will you be happy or disappointed?    David I is correct. Nixon did a great deal of good as president. It still breaks my heart that he left the office in shame.|`|fa6e0b6297e7e184947dc2477a900a48aa	Nyet.........COMRADE!|`|Tue5oCljaa	It actually wasn't 8.

That would be a different story.|`|VvU76vJxaa	One of the main platforms for gay rights I thought was tolerance.  Attacking those that oppose you physically goes against most of what gays have fought for all these years.

There is a precedent - a court ordered those who published the names and home addresses of doctors performing abortions to pay the family of someone killed using the information from that site.    How would this case be any different, if people are posting home addresses with an intent to intimidate, or worse?|`|CGxQ9vSuaa	When you have a controversial topic like Prop 8, its bound to incite resentment within the LGBT community.  That judge made a huge error in releasing those names because even while you may not agree with those supporters, they have the right to support any/all proposition's as they choose without it being public knowledge.  This however, shouldn't ignite violence amongst anybody, but especially within the LGBT community.  We all know of the many countless hate crimes that take place in this country and so by doing anything remotely close to that to these supporters would be taking steps backward.  Prop 8 will eventually & hopefully be overturned.|`|ti3AEcIFaa	everybody has they own opinion|`|V44ARW4maa	happy|`|1VaH8D3Raa	Well today   .  Anybody can attack anybody   .

I think it was foolish to release the financial backers of prop 8, but doing so does not give anyone the right to threaten physical harm on them.    Regardless of the issue, violence is never the answer. The whole point of our legislative and judicial system is to resolve matters like this without resorting to violence.    Violence against people who oppose gay rights is just as wrong as violence against supporters of gay rights.    HBJ|`|PRQ7ryOWaa	It makes those that do that look like what they are- hypocrites.     Like liberals who feign to support civil rights, instead support false leaders like Jessie Jackson, who incite racial conflict, radical gays who drink the Kool-Aid (among other things) justify their attacks, believing they are the victim. Its a classic example of liberals and their selfish interest groups, who all commit wrong doing, in the name of their cause.     All gay people don't advocate these attacks, they just get sucked into it.|`|X9F0nTygaa	what's prop 8?|`|XoYaFgkyaa	It sounds to me like the politicians are trying to use this issue to create consensus around campaign donation disclosure.  They are using the gay issue as a stepping stone.    This will be the sequence of events.  The issue goes to the supreme court.  The supreme court rules it unconstitutional and a breech of privacy law to disclose donations by individuals.  This ruling overrides campaign finance law.  Campaigns no longer have to disclose where they get their money from.      If there are gay people out there, the amount of hateful comments posted here should let them know exactly where they stand.  If I were gay in America I would consider moving to another country.  It doesn't look like America is going to except you any time soon.|`|669e0ad002f4e22de7cf7f91ca18058faa	Of course it's never right to attack anybody.

XD42367paa	my ex husband was missing a finger and he wasn't considered disabled. <br>  <br>  And just an FYI, in the USA, the Social Security Administration will issue disabled people disability payments based on their degree of disabilty. If the SSA won't pay for a missing toe, you aren't going to be considered disabled.|`|3593990737e2529f3d37c4d45d8ea4dfaa	not being able to play football due to a missing toe is a disability.|`|1NSPKg1baa	i don't think so. Maybe if you were missing both big toes, but just one toe? I suppose you can argue that it caused you to walk funny.  <br>  <br>  Also, what's the job? A foot modeling job can probably get away with saying that. But a job at McDonald's, not so much. In that case, yeah, I think then you could file under ADA. <br>  <br>  I guess it depends on how good of a lawyer you have.
0hjvOg7Oaa	A Theocratic government in Canada or the USA would be akin to the Taliban in charge.  During Bush the Younger's reign, the evangelical Christian Right were allowed to infiltrate all levels of government, particularly at the federal level.  These folks sat on policy making committees in the White House, the Pentagon, in military colleges, boards of education, social planning, etc. etc.  Most foreign aid was funnelled thru faith based groups which then dictated policy at the field level. For instance, in Africa anyone requesting help to combat AIDS had to first sign a pledge to abstain from sexual activity.<br>  Military strategy in the Middle East was influenced by these evangelical Christians that the second coming of Christ would only happen after Israel and the rest of the region went up in fire and smoke. These folks tried to influence policy in that direction to try and fulfill that particular prophecy.<br>  Thankfully, the election of President Obama has brought that insanity to a screeching halt. In summary, the separation of Church and State by the US Founding Fathers was put into law for very good reasons. George Bush tried very hard to circumvent that principle, but the majority of Americans saw what was going on (as above) and put a stop to it by the rule of democracy.  To answer your question, a Theocracy in America controlled by the Evangelical Christian Right would be a dictatorship in the supreme and atheists would definitely be either marginalized, imprisoned or put to death.|`|AA11635487	By terror. By intimidation. By social ostracism. By ignorance (withholding education) and brute force (political enforcement and suppression of dissent). People who would be free-thinking would be coerced into submission by fear. Theocrats (the rulers) would claim to interpret the divine word. Goodbye freedom and democracy.|`|V5GtTrtsaa	Theocracies are based on the principal that the religion is law.  If you're functioning on a level that allows there to be atheism, you aren't thinking properly.<br>  <br>  Assuming you're in the U.S., it would be like you no agreeing with democracy, not a certain religion.  Religion is a freedom in the U.S., you get to choose how you believe and what you think -- however we are all forced as a society to work within the bounds of a democratic government -- even people who are traditionally of other types of cultures must assimilate to our democracy if they come here because that is just the way the country provides order.<br>  <br>  Going back to a Theocracy, order is provided through religion, so the entire mindset is different.  Religion isn't an open and free belief, it is the you're government, you're president, you're congress, your king.  There is no questioning it, because it rules and organizes millions of people and just is.<br>  <br>  So, to answer your question, if you take out the premise that religion is a belief system that's personal and unique, and relate religion to a democratic system, then atheists (and any other type of religion that contradicts the Theocracy, as I'm sure the atheists would be a small minority of any large population) would be outruled.|`|1219d6000cca01c9f3c4489d1c7b4a16aa	That is a tough question.  The government wouldn't tolerate any form of organized religion.  It's beliefs would be based on its people's beliefs, or its leader depending on what type of government it is.<br>  <br>  The supreme court has classified atheism as a religion, as paradoxical as that sounds.|`|axiA5mMoaa	God told Elijah for I have a set a remnant for Myself 7000 men that have not bent their knee to Baal.

Get accepted to a college in California FIRST. Then, file the necessary paperwork and see just how difficult this will be. <br>  <br>  You would need money and lots of it to live in California.

By basically giving back what we spend on taxes to us, the government is hoping we spend our extra money on goods we cannot afford right now due to the recession thus helping the economy. Also, you can hang up hoping for social security, people are living too long for us to have any hope of getting it, before it is used up:(      And, while I am a democrat I must agree with you that Bush was vilified, but don't worry, I'm sure they'll find something to bring down our new President.

The money is going to support actual public works.  This is not unusual.  Without Federal funding, there would have been no transcontinental railroad, no nationwide mail delivery, no interstate highway system, no telegraph and later, telephone system, no interstate commerce, no Erie or Panama Canals.

What can the government give me today cause I  can't do it for myself.|`|rttm1SLaaa	Where are you getting your facts?  Some of them are just blatantly wrong.  If you want to call the spending handouts, go ahead.  That's your prerogative, but that's like saying that free public schooling is a handout - it costs the government money, but it benefits the people at large, and in turn eventually benefits the government.  If you want to call it spending and not investment, that's also your choice, but I can use the same analogy here; you're spending to help people out of tough economic times, and when that happens, they can become tax payers and cycle money through the economy.  It's the same as "spending" in the stock market, you don't expect a large, immediate return on your "spending," but down the line as things get better for the company because of these investments, your stock goes up in price.  How can tax cuts go to people who don't pay taxes?  That doesn't even make sense.  The tax cuts are mainly focused on the lower and middle classes.  If 90% of these classes weren't paying taxes, would you deny that 10% are getting tax cuts?  Social security taxes are not being lowered specifically for the reason that they need to remain so that funding can go into social security.  Any amount they lowered the government is going to have to fund itself.  Actually, Bush termed it a bailout.  No one said he was evil for trying it either.  What people were annoyed about was that he was putting a bunch of spending into a "handout" with no transparency.  Meanwhile, Obama's plan has become probably the most transparent in the history of this country.  He'll have a website detailing every penny he spends and where.  He already has the entire plan laid out for the public to see with details as to where everything is going.  What's hard to understand here?  People realize their economic situation is terrible, and they know they need government help.  They're mostly happy to see a very upfront system for once.  The point of the plan is to REDUCE DEPENDENCY.  Most of the funds are going to job creation, and even conservative estimates say it will create 2 million jobs (the more common number is 4 million, which most economists agree on).  You're blaming everyone for the spending issues of a small group of people in our country.  Should we not pass the stimulus just because some people made bad choices in the past?  What's wrong with those people getting money anyway?  Even if they did spend it all, they would just return to their previous state, and that money flows into the economy.  What's wrong with that?  Creating jobs directly helps the private sector, I don't know what's so hard to get here.|`|xagiOb80aa	Well, it is a SPENDING package (for stimulus) not an INVESTMENT package|`|NdrO7u79aa	The thing that you have to remember is that when a Republican does it, it's "deficit spending" and "bailouts", but when a Democrat does it, it's "economic stimulus" and "tax cuts".|`|ntj9WfzYaa	Look, whether or not taxpayers get a "handout" is not gonna solve the economic crisis.  We're still in it.  And Obama is just trying to help us middle class citizens (hard working I might add) to get by.  If they didn't give it back to us, then they would just give themselves a higher paycheck.  And sweetie, I really don't think you should depend on Social Security.  Start your own retirement fund... cuz you are the only one that can secure your future.

y4yVmcOVaa	Members of the federal judicial branch are all picked by the Executive, and confirmed by Congress.  This essentially means that the Judicial branch cannot build power in the ways that other parts of government can. <br>  <br>  Courts only interpret laws, and can only interpret laws that are brought into court.  Congress can write any law it feels like, but the Court cannot choose which issues to deal with.<br>  <br>  Courts have jurisdiction only on certain areas.  Some courts can only hear certain kinds of cases.  The Supreme Court can hear any kind of case because it holds original jurisdiction in America.<br>  <br>  Courts cannot enforce their own decisions.

Black people seldom have land lines, so they are not in the telephone books when a survey is taken  At election time the unemployment rate was reported at 5.2%, black unemployment at around 10% by the Department of Labor.  Yet house to house surveys in black neighborhoods showed an unemployment rate of 50%.  Yet everyone ignored their plight.  I suspect that Obama will opt for a full employment economy.  This will mean more inflation, but a more efficient use of our labor force, and a stronger America.  The war we are engaged in would have caused much inflation if it were not for all the unemployment.

c3vPZfghaa	YES<br>  <br>  Free trade agreements are responsible for the growth of large industrial cities on the mexican side of the border close to America.<br>  As American companies produced more in Mexico, more people migrated from central areas of southern mexico and central America to take jobs in industrial centers near America's border.<br>  Because more people were migrating to those areas than jobs available, once they could not get a job they continued northward into America.<br>  If you haven't realized what I am talking about, I am speaking of illegal immigration.<br>  interesting that the free trade agreements the right supports is responsible for a large portion of the illegal immigration that they oppose.<br>  <br>  Then you have China flooding America with cheap products made by laborers making less than $10 a day to begin with, which has now grown to about $2 an hour.<br>  Soon corporations will be looking for other underdeveloped countries to exploit for even cheaper labor.<br>  <br>  while we have dropped many of our tarriffs, some of our trade partners subsidize their products, so it has the same affect as having tarriffs on American imports.|`|i0vcEyJtaa	It definitely hurt America.

0QJnCLssaa	A federal Parliamentary Democracy with a Constitutional Monarchy. It basically means that they have a federal system like the US, where power and jobs are split between the National government, and the provincial governments and local governments. It has a parliamentary system like in Great Britain, with two Houses, the Senate and the House of commons. The winning party of Parliament elects the Prime Minister. It also contains a monarchy, but like the UK, it is only a figure head. They also have a Governor General, who is appointed by the head of the Monarch, on advice from the Prime Minister. Its system of government is controlled by a constitution like in the US and UK. So Canada is kind of a mix of the US and the UK.|`|eW0MSS1uaa	A Liberal-run Socialist government.|`|d5RbVpnRaa	The politics of Canada function within a framework of constitutional monarchy and a federal system of parliamentary government with strong democratic traditions.

Illegal immigrants-100% chance that they should/will get deported, either voluntarily or involuntarily once they are caught.
AA10925759	The US does not realy care. Nor does the UK. But the US might hassle you at some point.     What you do for just a visit is to fly out on the US one. Take the slow lane... which is really not that bad at Heathrow or whatnot. They are going to see that you were born in the UK on your US passport which is no big deal.

vgNELAQIaa	May I answer the question this way by posing a question with the obvious single answer for all.....      If it was correct to support France when Germany invaded in WW1,  .. correct when supporting England when Germany was bombing and threatening invasion,  .... correct to liberate the Jews when they were being murdered in their millions,  ....correct for the UK to liberate the Falkland Islands when Argentina invaded,  ..... correct to support south Korea when China flexed it's muscles through the north and caused civilians into oppression and torture,  ... correct to liberate Kuwait when Iraq invaded,  ...correct to liberate Afghanistan when bin Laden and company tortured oppressed and murdered civilians, (and let's not forget 911),  ... correct to enter Somalia when civilians were being murdered in their thousands by war lords and militia,  ..  ..  then what makes Vietnam any different?    Soviet backed Ho Chi Minh and his successors ordered the death and torture of civilians, the seizure of lands, the torture and death of POW's, the destruction of public property, the looting of wealth from successful investors and more....  He also attempted to force upon the people a dictatorship with the abolition of democratic elections, and subsequently ordered the death of anyone who spoke against him.      Let us also not forget the 4 week occupation of the Vietnam city of Hue, where the NVA occupied and bound, tortured, murdered and buried alive some 5000 civilians.    Let us also not forget that the neighbor of USA, Cuba, had it's own equivalent of the CIA or KGB in Hanoi torturing US prisoners. So Cuba supported Vietnam and were just a short boat ride from Florida. Would that make you feel threatened?  Think about it.... Cuban soldiers in Vietnam, and they had nuclear missiles.

Did you know that even today children are born in Vietnam with  terrible deformations caused by agent orange and that many American  soldiers suffer from this poison too.  Some of the answers given here show me that my opinion about a  certain type of Americans is unfortunally still correct.|`|x39jwlUBaa	One has to understand the bigger picture when it comes to the reasons why Vietnam or our involvement, graded against the outcome where the North unified the South and has now become one country.   Ever since the creation of the 17th parallel after WWII it divided a people and idealology .  If you wanted to be communist - you went North to live.  Remain in a free world society.... live in the South.  The problem overall which the leaders of the North saw was that the south was the rice bowl of asia..... their food bowl which they should rightly have as a united people....They  had plenty of mineral wealth, but not a lot of rice growing areas... as they once had before WWII.  Anyway, before I went to serve in Vietnam in 1967 we were addressed by a journalist who had lived in the South East Asian area for the past eighteen years.  In the very week he spoke to us and in the talk he gave us, he predicted the Irish uprising in Northern Ireland... based on research and political and journalistic nouse.  I guess in saying this, he wanted to qualify what he was about to tell us by giving the answer to the question ... Why is America in Vietnam. and to answer our question ... why are you going to Vietnam...   His simple answer was to "Draw the line", by creating the "Bamboo Curtain", a similar creation they made in Europe after the 2nd World War ie "The Iron Curtain.".   The main effect of Communism was not so much that the North under Ho Chi Minh was communist, but that China was beginning to flex ifs own flavour of Communism in the region.  After having thrown the Russians out of their country for fear of their dominance and ideals... they had said to the Russians that they should now recognise China as the new "Mother of Communism" and adopt their new form of practice.  This angered the Russians no end.  They of course had been supporting North Vietnam with arms and military expertise.  A lot of their goods were shipped by rail across China... who obviously intercepted a lot of it and grew its own flavour of weaponry... they are great copy cats.  The "Domino Theory" was very much a cause to stop the control of communism spreading into the South, to Laos and Cambodia and into Thailand itself,and of course down through Malaya, Singapore etc.  Even though the war went different as a result of the involvement of the Western World Forces....., I believe that our presence helped to create this notional "Bamboo Curtain"  It stopped the influence of the Chinese from controlling that region of countries,  However, even today, in a sense they still do, and under the same cover and strategy which created the Vietnam condition.  If you study carefully about what is happening in the region you will find that China effectively contains the security of its southern borders through covert and indirect support of cadre staff which plan is to create the minor wars and skirmishes which continue to errupt between Drug Lords and indigeonous peoples who inhabit the highlands and mountains of its border regions. .    Now the question... why did China do that and continue to maintain this condition.  In 1967  General Lin Piao, head of the Chinese military forces was preparing his country for war with Russia.  A five year time frame was given by this journalist - saying that if he was to remain as the head of the army for the next five years... there would be a war between the two countries.  Strategically  he needed to secure the great expanse of its northern borders against a pending Russian invasion..... it could still happen today.  This meant that they had to deploy many of its divisions in the South,to the north which would leave their southern borders open to attack.  Their strategist decided to put in cadre staff to indoctrinate and train the highland indigenous people to use modern weaponry of the time,  to secure their mountain homelands  and then claim back from the lowland people what used to be theirs on the premise that... thats where they once lived but were forced off by its present occupants.... Effectively, tribal warfare were created amongst them for whatever reason..... all China wanted was for these skirmishes to effectively contain their border regions - being then able to deploy more of its army to the North.    Interestingly enough, General Lin Piao disappeared some two and a bit years later... said to have been killed in an aircraft crash.  China, although unstated in todays world.... continues to prepare itself for war.   they know the day will come when what they have reserves of  ie oil, gas, minerals will be wanted by the others..... they are currently using the resources of the world to power its economy, and even some of that is being stockpiled.  Although Russia is neutral, both counties still have artillery and infantry skirmishes over ownership of an island in one of the rivers which divide both countries.  We dont hear of it... but it happens even today.   Anyway, to answer your question I believe as a small but effective fighting force representing New Zealand... we with the other countries who contributed their resources alongside America, created the notional "Bamboo Curtain".... for the length of time it was needed to allow the countries of the region to become stronger and  autonomous as the rulers of the destiny of their own country and people.    Perhaps the outside question is... was the sacrifice we made worth it.  personally because of my health I would have to say no, but to they who now live in relative freedom as a people and the growth that is beginning to be seen and experienced by tourists from New Zealand, I believe it has been worth it.  Understand however, that this whole question of regional security is not over....  division and war will happen again.... history will repeat itself and your children may have to defend their wives, their children and their country.

But if we were going to ship it or the resulting energy fuels back here, then no. We would just be trading one foreign fuel for another.    It is for this reason that I believe it is vitally important that we here in the U.S. seek to develop our own source of energy. Abundance of lectricity is the obvious answer, but by what means remains the question. Nuclear power is overall the cheapest and quickest means to get lots of energy quickly but because of the issues of potential danger of leaks and of spent fuel rod storage, we have some thing we need to consider with that. Wind turbine power is a good option, but it will take a lot of money and a lot of land to build enough of them to equal even one nuclear plants output. Clean coal technology could also make a difference, but would be very costly. GeoThermal is good, but is also quite costly as it would work best used in individual homes and businesses rather than for nation wide use. Personally, I prefer the nuclear option.

moe1CJTyaa	I believe so, yes. I've been saying it for years. The EU costs the taxpayer billions of pounds every year. If we weren't spending it on the EU, think what we could spend it on, schools, hospitals, public services etc. Heck! We might even get lower taxes!    (I very much doubt that last one though.)|`|91916cdfcacbfc10a3cb8d35b35bb07daa	yes|`|a66nvk0taa	You can't leave Gordon Brown signed the Lisbon treaty. The British won't do the work the Polish worker are willing to do in the UK because of cheap wages.|`|efQGWAoMaa	I don't think so.    Our farmers would lose their EU subsidies bringing the prices of food up to cover the cost, we would have to reorganise our consistution and our legislation as EU law is so embedded into our own now and we would lose the vital support from being in such a powerful international network.     The free movement of capital is encouraged and we still have control over our own economy as we are not a part of the single currency and we have just as much say in what happens in the EU than any other nation state in the European Parliament or in the Council of Ministers.    Plus we use the EU courts which come in very handy when the UK courts can't resolve an issue.    So no, we wouldn't benefit at all in my opinion.|`|4TT8lSgwaa	Yes, of course.

We have had nothing but trouble since we did join, and it is getting worse.This Government and the previous lot are made up of complete fools, and only think of their own pockets, and certainly not ours.Plus   the idiots who are also in this Common Market ( and it is common ) are like us     and also say that they wish they were not in it. I have some Dutch friends who told me that if we did join we would find out very quickly that it is not what it is cracked up to be.They did not have a choice either , and then to their horror all the prices went up as they got the Euro as well. They said if the UK comes into it we would soon find about all the excuses they give, as prices keep rising.

For years the UK has paid more into the EEC than we have got in return.  We have had to subsidise inefficient farmers and pay money to countries such as Greece to assist with their pensions.  That money could have been spent here for our jobs and services.    The UK is now unable to protect its fishing waters and increasing amounts of laws are now implemented from Brussels and are overshadowing the people we vote to represent us.  EEC law prevails over our law.     We are unable to protect our citizens jobs from countries such as Poland  due to the Article treaties which permit foreigners to have free movement of labour.    Soon we will lose the British pound and have no montary control over our economy or taxation laws.   You will find VAT will be in line with France and Scandinavian countries at up to 35%!    We are told we rely on it for "jobs"  but what they dont tell you is that 50% of British goodds and services are earned abroad and it may have a temporary loss of jobs but those jobs are replaced in a free economy.

zuZntfiwaa	Let's get a few things out of the way first:    Warren Buffett, when he became a member of Schwarzenegger's economic advisory body, called for greater taxes on the wealthy, including himself. He said the tax burden had shifted too much to the middle and lower class, giving the wealthy all the goodies w/o making any sacrifices for an infrastructure whose benefits are largely for them. He pointed out that his California property taxes, for instance, were infinitesimal compared to his Nebraska property taxes, all this owing to the radically right-wing/libertarian use of the California proposition system to scale back taxes left and right. (One major result has been that California public universities, once the envy of the nation, have gone downhill fast with the exception of a handful of campuses.)  Republicans squawked over Buffett's public statements, so Schwarzenegger canned him.    Many here don't know that Bill Gates amassed his vast personal wealth by (1) buying someone's already existing OS, (2) making modifications to it that have never been ironed out, even with the vast number of "Microserfs" who've worked on the code over the years, thus yielding the numerous crashes we're all familiar with, (3) having the admittedly brilliant idea ahead of everyone else that software is more important/revenue-generating than hardware, and (4) committing egregious monopoly practices that effectively killed every other software competitor using Windows and PCs. The U.S. government sued them; the European Union (EU) sued them. At one point, U.S. courts ordered MS to be broken up into two companies, but, in the end, the government (under the new corporate-giveaway G. W. Bush administration) decided not to seek the breakup. Instead, it sought a settlement agreement (partly monetary, partly change in practices) whose compliance is still being monitored. In 2004, the EU ordered MS to change its practices and to pay ~$800M for its anti-competitive ways, a record fine. In 2006, it fined MS another ~$450M for failing to comply with the earlier agreement. In 2008, the EU fined MS another ~$1.45B for still failing to comply, setting a new record.    Interestingly, though, Bill Gates's father agrees with Buffett. He's even co-founded a group advocating for more taxes for the rich, esp. the retention of a meaty estate tax.    Research has shown that the wealthy contribute far less in charity than do the poorest people. Lower-class people in Mississippi contribute a greater portion of their income to charities than do the wealthy, just as the U.S. gives foreign aid in much lower portions of GDP than any other industrialized country. And so-called "supply side economics" is nothing more than socialism for the rich and corporate welfare. Corporations wanted GATT and NAFTA, which have destroyed workers' rights, pay, decent jobs, and environmental regulations throughout North America; multinational food corporations have destroyed subsistence farming throughout Latin America and other countries, driving Indian farmers to suicide and desperate Latin Americans (mostly men) to seek jobs illegally in the U.S. while they leave their families behind. The war machine makes huge profits from misery inflicted on others; most don't know that the majority of military or political "commentators" on TV and elsewhere during the run-up to the Iraq War were lobbyists for or on the boards of corporations that stood to make billions from war w/ Iraq. And hundreds of the biggest corporations in America pay no income taxes. None. Does this sound like a "level playing field" or a "free market"?  _____________    So there is no mere "working hard." There are no "self-made" people. So many environmental factors go into "success" and the making of wealth (including simple inheritance and the continued returns on it from investment, not work) that no one should be able to pretend to have no obligation to "spread their wealth around" in a way that a democratic/republican society sees fit. The efficiencies of scale government gives us all (and could give us all in areas like health care) make investment in it very wise.

Insurgents are using IEDs because they are one of the few ways they can fight the US military. In a face to face fight, they will always lose. Guerrilla armies usually resort to such tactics.      The people that strap on bombs are not heroic, they are suicidal. Suicidal people are trying to escape the consequences of their actions, not face them. They are trying to escape and go to Paradise to be treated like royalty.       You'll notice too, that the men who are praising the suicide bombers and encouraging them are not strapping on bombs and joining the heroic martyrs they are helping to create.

However, watch the heroic comments, more on that later....    The truth of the matter is, cowardly or not, this is the way they fight. Yes, ANYONE would rather fight an enemy he can see, but this is the nature of guerrilla warfare. It's very frustrating for those doing the actual fighting, especially when the military in general is slow to adapt to changes outside of conventional warfare.    When I left, stateside exercises were still being conducted based on Eastern European warfare scenarios (Cold War stuff), when the real focus was a growing insurgency in Iraq and Afghanistan. The only way to combat it is through small, non-linear thinking teams, devoid of the "big-unit" oversight. We're changing, slowly but surely, and there is bound to still be elements thinking in conventional manners which cause the perception of "unfair" fighting.    Nothing is fair in war, and you seem to grasp this to some degree. IED's are indeed their tools. No amount of complaining will stop that.    But what makes it worse is the sympathizers such as yourself who portray the insurgents as heroic and willingly downplay our own military's actions and sacrifices without any sort of first-hand experience. These people are not brave freedom fighters as you describe. These people hide behind children, target food markets full of civilians with car bombs and torture people in ways you can't even imagine.

JTyd7X9Yaa	It takes 5 years to get a green card thru marriage. Because too many people faked marriages in order to stay in the USA. With the majority of green card marriages being fraudulent, the government watches the couples closely for a number of years to make sure the marriage is real and not a paid business deal where the immigrant buys his way into the USA.<br>  <br>  *Sara S and *Honestly are correct. The statistics are against your marriage lasting. Do not have children until he gets his green card. You are thinking with your heart and not your head. Marry this man and you will not be protected.<br>  <br>  The only way you can insure this relationship will last is if he has been your boyfriend for several years so far.

If he entered without inspection (i.e. crossed the border without a valid visa), he will have to go back to Honduras for the interview process. There is no way around this as it's impossible to adjust status unless he entered with a valid visa.  <br>  <br>  In this case, he will be denied and you would have to file an I-601 waiver to try and overcome the bar placed on him due to his illegal entry and presence in the US. You need to prove extreme hardship to yourself should he be denied and you're forced to move to his country and for that, I'd recommend talking to a good immigration attorney.<br>  <br>  To clear up some of the misinformation, if the marriage is less than 2 years old at the time residency is approved, the spouse is given conditional residency which is a 2 year green card. They then need to apply (3 months before the conditional card is due to expire) to have the conditions removed.  If a marriage is over 2 years old at the time of approval, the spouse is granted permanent residency and gets a 10 year green card.<br>  <br>  When residency is granted through marriage, the spouse can apply for citizenship after 3 years rather than 5, provided they are still married to the sponsoring spouse and meet all the other criteria.|`|Zrq8vjaXaa	All that LV-Gnome stated above is correct.  <br>  <br>  Somce addition notes:<br>  <br>  You should consult an immigration attorney to assist you in this matter.

Some offices allow you to file for an immigrant visa, along with the I-601 Extreme Hardship Waiver, at the same time.  Others, such as the Juarez Ciudad office in mexico required that the Consular Office deny your husband's immigrant visa first, then file and obtain an approved I-601, then only to refule the I-601 waiver again.  <br>  <br>  As such, do consult an immigration attorney prior to filing any documents for immigration benefits.

For serious.  <br>  <br>  If, alas, you are from the U.S., and/or are male, don't despair completely.  <br>  <br>  You need to be fluent in one of the additional UN language besides English.  You should think about studying abroad to gain this language experience, plus cultural experience.<br>  <br>  You can try to intern at the UN or a UN agency when you are in college.<br>  <br>  For your major, there's no magic one.  The UN is so big, and works in so many fields, they typically hire specialists.  I would say your chances are increased the more specialized degree you have.

If you are an economist, or an agronomist, or a finance wiz, or a development expert, your odds are much better.  <br>  <br>  Overall, my advice would be to learn a 2nd language (Russian, French, Spanish, Chinese, Arabic), study abroad, do an internship with the UN or a UN agency, and start getting to know people.

o13oejiuaa	Not as much drug is entering the U.S through Mexico b/c the drug lords are too busy fighting with each other that nobody is working. The goverment benefits from the drugs, how? Seized property, restitution fines, etc. They don't get taxes from all that drug that is sold but they sure do get billions in restitution fines. I personally live in Mexico and read the newspapers here, lots and lots of drug lords have moved to San Diego, border city with Tijuana (where I live) and cross the border like nothing, also there has been lots of kidnappings in the Chula Vista area of S.D. I am just giving you info of the border city I live in but I feel these are ways the drug war in Mexico affects the US, I am sure there are many more ways that I am not aware of.|`|Z0KQenm9aa	i have heard that the united states or some politicians or crooked others benefit from the drug business and war in mexico so i wouldn't think the drug issue will ever be under control|`|Q4PCupuqaa	Their fighting it in the US.

The first place it would arrive is the MEPS in your state. Then it will go to USAREC (us army recruiting command). From there it will be shuffled, left or plain forgotten on multiple people's desks. Finally, after the slow process, depending on your MEPS, you will get the call. Don't worry, your recruiter will do everything in his power to expedite your entrance into the service.

7DuVshl5aa	I think you could trace it back to 1960, when it got its independence from Belgium.  <br>  <br>  The government immediately began infighting, and could not govern effectively.  New PM Lumumba courted the Soviet Union, and earned the ire of Europe and the U.S.  He was eventually killed, whether by Belgium and the US, or by Congolese has never been determined.  <br>  <br>  Then a guy named Joseph Mobutu, an Army Colonel, took over, and ruled as a military dictator for the next 20 years.  He provided some political stability, especially during the Cold War when the world was a chess board between the USA and USSR, but stole all the country's money, and did nothing for its long-term prosperity.<br>  <br>  For the past 15-20 years, Congo has been in a near constant state of war.  Millions and millions of people have died, literally, it's one of the biggest tragedies in the world you never hear about.  Of course, the economy is not going to grow in such an environment of chaos and violence.<br>  <br>  So in conclusion, while it's a hugely complicated historical process, I'd assert that independence was the major event that hurt Congo's economy.  This is not the politically correct thing to say, and I am NOT sticking up for Belgium, which by all accounts, particularly in the 1800's, was a brutal colonizing power in Congo.  They committed many atrocities.
7DuVshl5aa	They never had much in the way of resources to begin with.  But sadly, like so much of Africa, Sierra Leone has been a case study in how bad governance, poor education, corruption, and civil war dooms a country to misery.  <br>  <br>  The civil war there unquestionably was the source of the woes that plague the country today.  <br>  <br>  For future success, the country will have to avoid a return to war, and manage their natural resources so that exports can bring the country hard foreign currency, which they can invest in infrastructure and education.  <br>  <br>  I've included a link to Wikipedia, a good start for some basic information.

KTM5JEkLaa	Yes. It is illegal for a police officer to use any force or threat of force for any reason other than what is legitimately required for carrying out their duties, protecting another person, or defending themselves.  Period.|`|DFJ9m4WKaa	In no way is the badge above the law. If a spouse can prove that their partner, who's a law enforcer drew a gun on them, on or off duty without any just cause, that officer is totally liable and would most likely be dishonorably discharged from the force and probably be charged for criminal offenses.<br>  <br>  It does not matter if you are a cop, a soldier, a firefighter or Jesus Christ the son of God, it is illegal to use any fire arm for intimidation in any case. Any more cops taze more than they shoot.<br>  <br>  An officer is only able to use his weapon when deadly force is necessary.|`|F5YAwC7Aaa	yes it is illegal  only for self defence

You can get the passport exactly on the 15th day of your application. If you dont have the required ID & address proof, you need to apply through normal process which takes more than 45 days(sometimes more than 6 months also.).

73f37851c35d22949c704d293473d5cbaa	The WORDS "separation of church and state" are not in the amendments, but the First Amendment establishes the freedom to exercise ANY religion (as well as the freedom to NOT exercise any religion).<br>  <br>  Thomas Jefferson clarified this in a letter he wrote to the Danbury Baptist Association in 1802, and used the phrase.  Here is the full paragraph:<br>  <br>  Believing with you that religion is a matter which lies solely between man and his God, that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship, that the legislative powers of government reach actions only, and not opinions, I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should "make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof," thus building a wall of separation between church and State.<br>  <br>  I hope that helps.|`|58607c6ba5c8f548e69203c94d723527aa	THe government isn't making you follow a certain religion. Putting you in camps if you don't pray and such.|`|QvF8dR7Taa	it means churches cant promote a certainer politician openly,and the state cant appoint a certain religion as the state religion,but they have done it already,its atheism,and evolution|`|AA12022384	It is when the church stop (separate) having political influence and power in how a country is run in government and legal matters.|`|AxIXg8bmaa	It just means that you keep religion and politics seperate|`|AAzYDYXcaa	don't bring religion into the government.<br>  voila.|`|AA11215432	The term separation of church and state does not exist in the united states Constitution.  You are granted freedom of religion in article 1 of the Constitution.  It reads as follows: Amendment I (see source links)<br>  <br>  Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.<br>  <br>  <br>  The idea of separation of Church and State in America emerged from the struggle for re-ligious freedom and tolerance. This principle does not imply suppression of worship but is designated to protect liberty in the exercise of one's faith. The State is presumed not to be hostile or beneficent to any specific Church, but is equally benevolent to every Church. <br>  <br>  But the legislators of Soviet Russia were<br>  inspired by quite different ideas. Thus, begin-<br>  ning with the first Decree "On Separation of<br>  the Church from the State and the School from<br>  the Church" issued January 23, 1918 (in the<br>  third month of the Soviet regime), such a<br>  separation was not aimed toward religious free-<br>  dom or tolerance, but was designed to under-<br>  mine the very existence of the Church in Rus-<br>  sia.<br>  <br>  This was made clear in retrospect in the<br>  publication of the Central Institute for Anti-<br>  religious Correspondence Courses, printed by a<br>  Soviet Government printitig office in 1932.|`|GHPZlhAwaa	"Separation of Church and State" is not a Constitutional right, it is something that has come out of a USSC court case.  The only right is the Government has promised in the 1st amendment not to tell the people what religion they must follow, meaning that the US, unlike other countries, will not have an official national religion.<br>  <br>  whale|`|YjG1TEJoaa	It is NOT in the Amendments, nor the law! That is a LIE. Modern secularlists want you to believe religion has no place in government. But the actual meaning is the government has no place in religion. Religion is free to interfere in government all it wishes.<br>  <br>  THIS is where the phrase actually comes from: <a href="http://www.lonang.com/exlibris/misc/danb..." rel="nofollow">http://www.lonang.com/exlibris/misc/danb...</a><br>  <br>  The idea is the government has no business getting involved in religion. Period. I can be any religion I want. I can teach religion to kids as a school teacher, apply as a religious organization for federal funding, or any other thing I want. The government will do nothing for nor against any ORGANIZATION of religion. That means a religious organization is to be treated exactly the same as any other organization.
AA11494150	Yes, many states have a law preventing entering private property to avoid traffic control. Here is an example from Michigan:<br>  <a href="http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(wlm5p555f0jkq22m5ivm5a45))/mileg.aspx?page=getObject&objectName=mcl-257-611" rel="nofollow">http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(wlm5p55...</a><br>  <br>  Keep in mind the average motorist who intentionally cuts through private property is in a hurry. People in a hurry are less likely to be paying attention, causing an increased chance of an accident. <br>  <br>  In addition, private property owners do not want the increase in unneccesary traffic.|`|AA11858035	Yes, in Texas it's a law, I got one once myself when I cut through a store parking lot to avoid a light.|`|1KGXts5Daa	It is illegal in California to do as you described.  It is sufficient cause to be stopped by law enforcement and issued a traffic violation notice (a "ticket").<br>  <br>  Legally, it is viewed as trespassing on private property  (even if only momentarily and while mobile).|`|ShhOXGuQaa	it's illegal to use private property to simply manuever in traffic. at least it is here in st. louis.|`|KTM5JEkLaa	There are laws on the books that are intended to prevent people from using private parking lots as shortcuts or ways to avoid a traffic control device.  The intent is to prevent parking lots from being treated as traffic ways since it would cause issues with safety for business patrons and cause safety issues for traffic actually traveling on the roadways.  That said, I have not heard of anyone writing a ticket for something like you describe, but it is possible that the church has complained about this being a problem.  In any case, that is the rationale behind the law.|`|c61bf05c11575801063cc3be9957813caa	Yes it is the law that you can not drive through certain property.  It is even true of cutting through gas stations.  I have seen people get pulled over for doing just that and getting a ticket for cutting through gas stations.  Not so much of cutting through church parking lots though.<br>       I would imagine that it depends upon the city and/or the state where you are living, what their state laws are regarding this matter.  I think to get more information you could call the City Hall or even the Police Department to find out what they say.|`|Zr0fShabaa	I think it goes back to the old days when there were gas stations on most every corner.  People would often take shortcuts through them to avoid the light at the intersection.  It created a real traffic hazard.
c07v7O80aa	Sorry. You are asking in the wrong place. I've never known one of them who could read enough to know what you were asking, much less use a computer. <br>  <br>  "Oh. The Ultranet.

b4c080d0f4c39aa94fde4b1f35a009fbaa	This can be possible in India if you got married according to Religious form of marriage, this Religious marriage was registered under the Act (such as the Hindu Marriage Act,1955) which covered the religious marriage & by some mistake wrong information got typed in the marriage certificate.<br>  <br>  In such case either this mistake in typing can be got rectified by making an application to the Registrar of Marriages to make necessary changes in the Marriage Certificate or issue a fresh Marriage Certificate with the changes as requested. The changes which are to be made should only with regard to typing mistake & not with regard to the factual details of the parties which were mentioned by the parties in their application or affidavit attached with the application.<br>  <br>  In case this is not possible then the parties can get their Religious marriage Registered under the Special Marriage Act,1954, the Civil form of marriage. Section 15 of this Act provides that any marriage solemnized according any religious form can be registered under the Act & a Marriage Certificate is then issued under this Act to the parties. By doing this the typographic mistake made in the previous Marriage Certificate can be avoided & a new Marriage Certificate is issued by the Marriage Officer/Registrar of the same district where the previous marriage was registered or any new district where now the parties after their marriage resides.Once the marriage is registered under the Special Marriage Act,1954 then all the provisions of this Act only apply on the marriage.|`|AA11764194	you must get it corrected where the certificate is issued.. <br>  <br>  don't neglect the matter.. in case if you apply for a passport or other legal documents incorrect name or details can cause lots of problems..|`|AA12109395	Legally, you must change the original document which is filed at the courthouse in the county and state where you were married.

A dumb war. A rash war. A war based not on reason but on passion, not on principle but on politics....<br>  <br>  I know that even a successful war against Iraq will require a US occupation of undetermined length, at undetermined cost, with undetermined consequences.

Look at the scandals that are in the news with all of the tax problems the sex, legal problems.  The average citizen doesn't have that much in their life.  We have elected a group of rich lawyers that want to become richer, that do not have the country or the people at the center of their actions.  We need to clean out Washington. Vote the incumbent out.|`|c4170bc35cde247fdf8b6d3009f00b7eaa	The worst part is the banks gave out half the tax payers money to their CEO's in bonuses.

There is nothing about money for Planned Parenthood that will help stimulate the economy.  It may be a worthy goal, but "stimulus" it is not.     There is nothing about new requirements for fuel efficiency on domestic automakers that will stimulate the economy.  Again, it may be a worthy goal, but a stimulus it simply is not.      Given that most of the "stimulus" is anything but "stimulus," I oppose it all on the grounds that it is not being marketed honestly, and is therefore likely to be bad.|`|9PoGLVmXaa	The stimulus packages are rewarding greed, mismanagement and out right corruption.

I couldn't believe it when stories broke about another nominee and more tax evasion issues (eye roll).
DEaIiT79aa	Another one bites the dust.    I know why democrats don't care if taxes go up now... they aren't going to pay them anyway.     This is such an embarrassment to he democratic party.  Was "Are your taxes current?" on the Obama questionairre that they had to answer before being considered for positions?|`|2CO7pPdoaa	gotta watch out for the "Obamanator", he's one SCARY dude!!|`|PG2gd1tOaa	And the real icing on the cake is the IRS dropped the penalties on Daschle's $140,000 and this is the same Tom Daschle that stood on the floor of the Senate in May of 1998 and said, " Tax evaders should be prosecuted to the nth of the law!".|`|AA11963685	I voted for Obama.  But I've never thought, not once, that he can do no wrong.  I don't really know anyone who thinks that.  The conservatives like to believe all Obama voters feel that way, but that's nonsensical and calling people retards says more about you than about them.  That being said, it's not Obama who has problems with his taxes.  What he has a problem with is his vetting process.  To me, that's just as serious.  We already had a vetting problem with Bush and his appointments, and Obama's team should have learned from that.  Obviously they didn't.|`|Ga3lCQTNaa	Daschle is now out, But your right about the other two, She was a small  time hit, But the Obaman man stood by the daschle man for a ever, Just  hard to swallow when you thought you could do no wrong, Obama is   finding out the Honeymoon is long over,|`|goHKCuyraa	Obama's tough vetting process at work once again--rofl|`|qjH3Tigbaa	Haha im sorry but MICHAEL J.

5rQnJZ8uaa	I am glad you asked this question, 1)I almost voted for obama like the rest I felt we needed change I realized when the DNC convention took place and I saw all the old Democrats come out of the wood work in support of obama I immediately realized that we were in for a long four years. 2) after He was voted in I said hey lets give the dude a chance. 3) any non biased person must be starting to be concerned  about the decisions this man is making and the personnel he has chosen. 4) what is really problematic that if he Truly did not know about these peoples indiscretions when He became aware of these why is he not disassociating himself from these people?5) Did this man not look us in the eye and tell us he wanted a new type of government transparency, honesty and people with integrity.  Every body's in love with this guy because he is the first black president. some times in love when the infatuation wears off you really see what's what. Hold on to your hat fella the craps gonna hit the fan shortly. He is not the right man for these difficult times|`|Oh1Hi8iMaa	The same people saying "Well Bush did this or that" were the ones saying you couldn't bring up Clinton's scandals.|`|X4z3GqAeaa	HAHA! Don't you love how liberals just start spewing insults when they can't counter a valid point?|`|N3S9S1joaa	I agree with you. Our ENTIRE government is corrupt. Fed, state and local.

"by comparing Obama to past presidential scandals aren't you just reinforcing the fact that he too is just as corrupt?"    Obama PROMISED to be the "change".....  Obama PROMISED to NOT be like "broken washington".....    Your post is 100% accurate  in pointing out ONE in the LONG list of things that is WRONG with Obama  being our President.    We (he) can start with the fact that FUNDAMENTALLY, he is NOT the man he sold "us" on ......  can anyone deny that FACT?|`|QJTOvC98aa	It's how people work. They can't face that they may not have known all the facts about the guy they elected. They can't stand to admit that he may not have been the best one - even from the democrats side. There were others running on the democrat ticket that were much better candidates.     If you can only argue a point by putting down someone else - you don't really have a point.    Annnnd bluestatebobby just completely proved your point.|`|QLW28Wqmaa	Well, they can't back up their president properly with positive things to say about him, since he hasn't done anything yet.  He has done plenty wrong though, so we have a lot of ammunition.  The only resource they have is digging through past republicans.|`|yoytdRGTaa	You're asking a serious question in this category?

With regard to comparing is copping out.    No its putting things into perspective, there's a reason people say its the choice of the lesser of two evils, and your acting like its not now is either partiality, or recognizing that you actually do think he's the best president you've seen because for the firs time that doesn't apply.    With regard to Clinton's scandles, those were person maratal problems, not how he was effecting the country, and I wouldn't be the firs tto suggest that: perhaps if your people had't usurped the intellegence network to ferret it out we wouldn't have had 9/11|`|de711i5Vaa	Loons on both sides try and defend or attack based on their Political beliefs.

They are fueled by their emotions, not their common sense or a common good purpose.    I prefer to ignore those question that are obviously intended to demean the opposition...either side. I just won't waste my time anymore trying to bring a common sense perspective to those that have no desire to do the research or to think for themselves. I think it is much more productive to answer open ended questions like this one...and I thank you for the opportunity.
9rkatDE9aa	because thats the only way he can TRY to justify what he wants to do as commander in cheif. He's trying to make the war just seem like a field trip and simply surrender our troops. Hopefully, we figure out how to be prepared for another attack on US soil (which we havent had in over 7 years). Because that's exactly what will happen when Obama thinks we can shake hands, call a truce, and waltz back home.|`|38MPmsaKaa	A famous artist once said:  Terrorism is the war of the poor, war is the terrorism of the rich.

Also only the very weak minded hinge all their expectations on the name alone - "war on terror", "war on drugs", "patriot act"...only the very stupid think that these things are legitimate because of how they are named.  What you call it doesn't necessarily have anything to do with what it is.|`|5d9pCmjyaa	Because the whole "war on terror" is absurd.  Even the most hawkish conservative think tanks say that a war on terrorism itself is so broad and vague that there is no possibility of winning.    It's a concept.  How do you militarily defeat a concept?  You might as well direct the military to attack Oxygen, or consciousness or the octal number system.    The whole purpose of the "war on terrorism" was so one Administration could rationalize their own terrorism.    If they were serious about fighting a "war on terror", they would have handed over Luis Posada Carriles to face terrorism charges.  Instead, we harbor him, and even set him loose on American soil.|`|SSLekPAnaa	He is appeasing terrorist overseas.

This sort of thinking won't solve the problem.

Corporate welfare is contraconstitutional, sinful and the norm. Nowhere in the Constitution does it mention capitalism, profits or letting business run the country.    Most opposition to social welfare is in the red herring category, to distract you.    Added. I do think that all the disguising of welfare was a mistake. Poor farms and poor houses (not to be confused with 19th. century English work houses) took care of families and had a much better success rate as far as getting people back on their feet and working. A certain amount of stigma  should attach to being on the dole.|`|6B1sxgtOaa	OUT OF CONTROL.  They were designed to temporally help people to get them back on their feet.

We have lost our uniqueness as a country with the invasion of illegals wanting these benefits.|`|aGockbqUaa	They are merely indoctrination programs to get people hypnotized and used to socialism which is nothing more than dependency on another person, place, thing or institution other than ourselves.    Bank Of America spent over 10 Million dollars of federal bail-out money for Super Bowl parties- and the President spent over 180 million dollars for an inauguration celebration.    All of this money came from tax-payers at a time in our history that we are completely bankrupt.    This is what social welfare programs are nothing more than tax-payers paying for the elect's social gatherings.|`|TTJ4k5uBaa	A means to an end is outstanding.  Help back on your feet.  Assistance finding work.  Subsidies because the work that is there is still 3rd world and just "outsourcing" our market to their shores.  Anything more than a short term fix though is not what it is there for or should be there for.  Other countries have other answers.  100% enlistment is the norm in Korea.  Some form of work for wage was the plan when many of these programs were set up.    A means that the partiers can pay for their children and keep their Heroin addition going is not.
ISMWh4Zaaa	generally speaking it is worst if states have free reign.  There are certain economies of scale that come about in regards to freedom that are best using federalism.  For example, if states were left to their own device, we might still have slavery, etc.....  Its also better for the stability and cohesiveness of the country to have policies that we embrace as a nation rather than a hodge podge of individual fiefdoms.    The only place I would like to see more state leeway is in taxation. I would like to see the federal government tax less and have the states tax more.  I also would like to see most taxes taken in as income tax and see sales taxes go down and have property taxes go down. Lastly, I would like to see tariffs be mostly tariffs....

California has welcomed illegal immigrants, who are costing the state billions. That state, and its signature city of San Francisco, which is a self-designated Sanctuary City, are in trouble.  Most of us oppose sanctuary cities.  So why would we want to help California out?   I dont.      I live in Florida and we have our own budget problems.

jgRRsG8Daa	It is not only very easy but has even become common to blame the government for anything and everything.Government can only enact laws and exercise a modicum of supervision in areas that you describe.  The government doesn't have either the machinery nor the wherewithal   to control the organised sector leave alone the unorganised one.Also the owners and petty officials are usually hand in glove in ripping the government off that when it comes to exploitation of labour,the owners'  writ is law as far as the workers are concerned.And in the matter of women these owners take by force what they want because no victim  dares to raise her voice for fear of not only losing her job but also fear for her near &  dear ones' lives.In such a scenario,the government is powerless for even if an official is deputed periodically to ascertain the  needs of the workers and enquire about their welfare as also to hear   their complaints and grievances,the official is either bought or intimidated so that the workers are afraid to speak out.The only way is for the central government through its ministries of welfare,labor,  industry etc.in association/conjunction with NGOs such as Women's   Welfare and such others as are concerned,depute officials on a regular basis with a quarterly visit by a senior official from one of the ministries in rotation to meet with the workers and arrange for their grievances and complaints to be heard,recorded and submitted to higher authorities for suitable action.Punishments to owners and officials who collude with them to give a raw deal to the workers and who exploit them in any way including sexually,should be so severe that they serve as deterrents for other officials and proprietors.

rulCYZXkaa	depends if the radar gun is on AND active.  I got popped once in Maine while I had my radar detector on.  The cop told me it does no good to have the stupid thing and then took me to his car and showed me why.  They have a button that they push to engage the system, so although it is 'on' it is not sending a signal until they hit that little button when they see you.  Your detector will detect the radar, but by then they have you pegged.    can it detect just the presence of an officer?  No.  You need pig hunting hound for that.|`|YAiKlPkMaa	No, it detects radar
G6yyceAxaa	ok, issues    normally all recruiters know each other in a area, so if you live in an area, and go to another recruiter, the recruiter will have to let the other one know (it is called poaching)  that recruiter will in turn tell that you are not qualified.    if you had childhood asthma, you can get a waiver but it is just a pain in the butt.  you will need to show that you have not been effected since you were in your early teens, a doctors letter will help    suggestion, call the first recruiter, and let him know what you want to do, he will probably clam up to help his buddy, but be honest with the first one, he may help you get in anyway.|`|v6l3o2kvaa	Well if they could have gotten you a waiver then whats the problem?

Yes.  If you mean something different, then perhaps you should give more detail.    Legal Rights - Legal rights are read to each person arrested.  A victim of crime does not have those same rights in reality.  The U.S. Constitution says that all men are created equal.  The amendments indicate that everyone should have the same rights, but what is on paper and what is recognized by the legal system, are not the same.    Political Rights - In the US, everyone of legal age is allowed to register to vote, if those voting privileges have not been revoked by being sent to prison or being declared of unsound mind by a judge.  Those who choose to vote, vote in an election and from there, it is a matter of opinion.  For presidential elections, your vote may or may not count.  It depends on how your state's laws dictate how your state's electors must cast their votes in the electoral collage.  The electoral college is the group that does the actual voting for the president, not you the individual.  For all other offices, your vote counts.  Once in office, there is nothing in our constitution that says those in office must vote for what is  best for their constituents (this means you, the voter).  If you follow the news, you will notice that most, if not all, elected officials vote on bills the way those that contribute most to their campaigns want, even if it is not in our best interest.
