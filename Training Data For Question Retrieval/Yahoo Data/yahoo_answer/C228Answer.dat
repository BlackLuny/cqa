RE6GBw0Baa	i dont think i can say anymore than febreeze and freshair chick, but its awalys raining here lol.    iv never heard of the vinegar thing, but def worth a try hun xxxx|`|Tv8MjT7kaa	I have the same issue with my in-law's house.  Vinegar is the best thing.  You can use 50% vinegar 50% water.  It will not smell like vinegar after it dries.    I will be honest, I got sick of doing this so I just took a few toys over there that became "Grandma's toys"  This also helped us clean out a few toys from the house and she always had different toys at grandma's.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	If  the weather permits, leave them outside in the fresh air for a day or so.|`|IlyS8KGzaa	I'd say vinegar.  The odd thing is that I smoke (outside of course) and none of my babies things smell like smoke.  I would totally know too because my boss is ALWAYS telling me how much I stink, but she never says anything about my baby.  My baby comes to work with me everyday.  I smoke here at work also (outside of course)     I guess I don't understand why your child's things would smell like smoke if they weren't smoking around her.  Just my thoughts though.  Like I said, my boss is ALWAYS telling me how much I stink, but never says anything about my daughter, and she holds her all the time.|`|Z7V7AbBQaa	Try wiping them down with white vinegar. I use vinegar in baby bottle that smell (  the one that get forgotten in the car for a few days and it gets the smell out) so it should work on plastic toys.|`|AA11773731	You should tell your parents that they can't have her until they stop smoking all together. Even if they smoke outside the smoke gets into their clothes and when they hold your baby, she inhales the fumes. Smoking is very very bad for children especially newborns. I work in a pediatrics office and see so many children developing symptoms of asthma so much earlier. Today we had a 3 month old with bad breathing problems and his parents smoke. Tell them to stop now.|`|dXVA1wHDaa	Febreeze is your friend!  I think it might just take time and a fair bit of strong smelling cleaners.|`|SU8z0TUoaa	Try mixing a few tablespoons of vinegar with water and using this to wipe down any plastic toys. But really, the smell will not hurt her.    A bigger concern is that it is very possible that your parents, one or both, let her smoke. You didn't say how old she is, but even if she is very small, it is possible. A lot of older folks think little kids are "cute" smoking, so they will hold cigarettes to their lips and let them puff, teaching them to smoke. If you have cigarettes, take an unlit one and pretend to smoke it in front of your daughter, then hold it close to her and see if she tries to suck on it. If you don't have cigarettes, make a fake one using a piece of rolled-up white paper. If it looks like she is trying to smoke, your parents are probably guilty of this, and you can confront them.  Good luck!|`|3Rr5SAhhaa	febreeze, airing them out or washing them with a bleach and water solution and rinsing afterwards arethe only things i can think of|`|aMZ7IKysaa	Use the febreeze laundry detergent, then rewash them in a baby detergent.

2wyDALHgaa	Although I'm sure most will say I'm nit picking, nothing makes kids qualified to be taken away.  Its what makes the parents allegedly unqualified to care for them that results in them being taken away.      Once social services are involved however they can do only so much.  Even if they did feel that they had reason to remove you from the home it still takes a court order to make that permanent.  As far as I have ever seen there is always a degree of judicial oversight so if it went on for that long I'm inclined to believe that there is more to the story then you know or that your mother will admit.  For sure investigations were done although that doesn't mean that your mother was aware of it at the time.  She certainly would have been made aware of it during the subsequent legal phase.|`|4TqERLSgaa	I had to call Social Services on my own daughter. She was smoking meth, and she was neglecting my grandchildren. I kept them as much as I could, but they were her meal ticket and she kept taking them back. It took a long time before they took them away from her, probably 6 months. You are right, they have to investigate, and it takes an act of Congress, to take someones rights as a parent away. I am happy to say, my Daughter has been drug free for 4 years, and she has turned out to be a wonderful Mother.|`|zLoyo24Taa	They probably did do an investigation. It may just take one phone call. Your mother did not have to be told who they talked to, could have been family, friends, neighbors, and teachers. They are still checking on your family to make sure everything is ok. As long as nothing is going on you have little to worry about.|`|q7sgWqZ3aa	I know in my area, if someone calls and "reports" about someone mistreating or neglecting their children, the social services do have to come out and do an investigation. If the children are being mistreated in any way, then they can legally take the children from the home and place them in children shelters/ foster homes until the problem is resolved or the parents are deemed unfit .    Sometimes it does take more then one phone call to get a family investigated. Some neighbors do do it out of spite but in most cases it is usually out of concern for the children.    Even if you get to go home with your mother, and the case isn't closed but you still live with her, then they can come in for home visits and check up on your progress on school to make sure your homelife and school life is going fine. If they suspect anything during this time, they can take the children away again until court decides where to place the children again. I know this because I've been through the foster care system. I've experienced this as well. My sister and I were living with our mom, in what the call a trial period, to see how well she can care for us and etc. After they determine that the mother/parents do a good job then they close the case for good. That can take years. One time it took 6 months for them to permanently close our case, the other time it took a year and a half.|`|ETcBRko3aa	When social services gets a phone call, it is actually triaged based on "level of severity."  For example, some cases are investigated with 2 hours and some are investigated within 72 hours.That being said, an investigation is always done before a child is removed from the home.  The workers talk to everyone in the child's life, so the phone call may initiate the investigation, but a phone call does not make children necessarily get taken away (unless the initial phone call reports a severely injured child).    This chart shows how it all works....  http://www.kidsarewaiting.org/tools/down...    Many reasons exist why kids are taken from their bio-parents:  abuse, neglect, parental drug abuse, abandonment, parents leaving children alone, parents mental illness, are usually the MAIN reasons cited.  But sometimes if your parents are not supplying enough food or adequate shelter or clothing, or if they are not seeing that you goto school, children might be removed.    The reason the workers continued in your life was because your case was not closed.  IN your situation, you were probably returned to your bio-mother under the understanding that she would continue to do what the Courts told her to improve.  The caseworkers were making sure (a) that she was doing what she was supposed to be doing and (b) that you and your siblings were ok.|`|fjkRIUSnaa	dss has to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that the childs  health is at risk. there are also several other factors such as livign conditons, if proper food and clothes are avail , abuse the list goes on. the parent may also temporailry sign the child or children over to the state until they get their affiars at home in order|`|hG0KgHyYaa	its because to the social services they can "see" that your in a bad environment but not all cases are about that.god forbid you could have been abused then they can take away your kids in a heartbeat.|`|gHn6dNGsaa	one thing social services BEND the rules so much, and none of them are your friends NEVER believe they are!    by right they should come around first but in many cases they don't care or don't even bother doing anything at all (e.g baby p)    one phone call wouldn't of got you taken away that would of been a home visit,many people would of had to of rang numerous times,     i know it might be hard to take it but your mum could of been doing something that your neighbors or other son didn't see right, it shouldn't of been just to spite her, but thats in the past so just try keep your head up.      && about the social services coming to visit it is just to make sure you are all coping fine, as you are all going threw quite alot of stress,but just remb if you ever feel stressed and wanan go out ring your social worker (they do it for free), and they have to ask how your school work is doing as if you were failing it MIGHT be because your stressed or under pressure at home     hope i have helped you :)|`|AA12127693	Well, I can tell you that I have had three children in my home over the last two years and one we ended up adopting him.    He was taken away because of Meth abuse  our smallest one (who goes back home next week) was taken because of past history with the mother / meth use / alcohol use  another we sent home was taken because of abusive behavior by the mothers boyfriend and pot use.    Children can be taken away for many reasons.  Investigations are done and should be conclusive before the children are removed in any case.    Case workers come around to check on "their" kids to make sure that the parents are still following their case plan - that no new issues have come up - that the parents are getting the help / resources that they need to raise their children.    For what it's worth to you - I am glad that your mom got you kids back.  She must have worked really hard.|`|VDWzEw3aaa	They do BAD things.  Like murder people.  And commit rape.    Rawr.|`|2gPpx6vmaa	it is not the kids who need any qualifications to be taken away from their parents,but the parents who are deemed incapable of looking after their kids for various reasons.Taking a child and placing it in foster care means,to me, just that.Adoption is a lot different especially from birth as the child and it's mother and sometimes the father are usually put in to the same circumstances and it is usually the parent/s who make the decision as to what they deem best for their child and not someone in authority.|`|dqZrq7Zeaa	I think something must have been wrong in the home.

There are so many things that people thing should be done or would like to do before they have a baby, but most of the time its just impossible. Like people saying they want to be financially stable before they have a baby, you can never really be financially stable enough for a baby, unless of course your a multimillionaire.

Most women who miscarry only have that happen because there is something wrong with the actual fetus.  And itsno due to anything the mother did.  Unless your doctor said that you have a certain condition that can increase the risk of misscarriage then I say get done what you would like to get done THEN try for another baby.

0Ei3ePJzaa	hello,  I know exactly the problem you are having - I had it with my first.  He screamed and writhed and simply would not have a bottle.  Eventually, as I had assumed he would only take it from other people, I tried him with the bottle myself, holding him in close as I would to feed from the breast, and he took half a bottle!  I was overjoyed.    Now, you can get Tommy Tippee "breast shaped" bottles, they are called closer to nature - to be honest, I have no idea if they will work, my 2nd child would drink milk from a mug because he is so greedy, he didn't care if it was coming from me, a bottle or a passing cow!  Now he is exclusively bottle fed.    Keep trying, I know it's frustrating, but just sit down, in the quiet, and relax with her with a bottle.  If she still fights, don't worry too much, just try again later.  She will take it eventually, she must just enjoy feeding from you more.|`|jipqICzVaa	I tried my youngest with a bottle - once.

If that means rearranging your schedule, and even leaving some things undone, learn to delegate so you can get enough sleep.|`|vmWEm4Jzaa	isnt it annoying when other peoples babies sleep through the night and yours doesnt? i think it depends somewhat on how old your baby is-if she is really young this is unfortunatly normal, if she is at least a couple of months old you may just have to let her cry a little after her feeding. and even though its hard you might need to let the dishes wait and do them in the morning and go to bed earlier! i always had a hard time doing that but if she isnt sleeping at night something has to give and it might be the housework. just remember it wont last forever!!! thank God!|`|eiJOdPgxaa	Learn to live with it!

You don't say what age she is.  If she is over 4 months she should be sleeping through after her dream feed around 10.30 pm at night till 7pm.    If she is happy enough I would leave her in her crib to amuse herself instead of getting up to her.  Otherwise try comforting her but not lifting her every 5-10 mins.  If she wakes up at 5.30 am there could be a couple of reasons eg light getting into her room -try black out roller blinds.  Also she may need a comforter such as a teddy to cuddle as these can give babies a great deal of security.  If she wakes up early, again I would not lift her - you could offer some cooled boiled water but again just comfort her every 10 mins or so until 7am.|`|ahipNp9Naa	how old is your baby? depending on age nine hours of sleep a night is brilliant! maybe try giving a bit of baby rice with her milk on her last feed before bed time to help fill her up if shes old enough|`|Ok4lJYVYaa	Sorry but you should have thought about this before you had a child.

Your baby is not going to sleep through the night for awhile especially if she is still waking up to nurse twice a night.     When she does get up to feed, don't talk to her, don't turn the lights on. Try to feed her in the dark. This will tell her that it is still time to sleep and she should just go back to sleep once she is done. Do this with each feeding.     Some babies are just early risers. Both my kids are, they are up by 6am everyday. I work FT, M-F and sometimes only average 5 hours of sleep a night. It is part of being a mom. Sometimes my kids sleep through the night and sometimes they don't. It just depends on the day.    I hate to say it, but you are just going to have to get used to not getting much sleep. Especially at the beginning. Try napping when the baby naps during the day. Also try rearranging your schedule so you can go to bed earlier. Try making your dinner earlier in the day, so all you have to do is re-heat it. You can also try crock pot recipes. Those are pretty easy and don't have much clean-up.     Let things go as well. It is ok. I am a clean freak and I had to learn to let some stuff go. The mess will be there tomorrow. Listen to your body and get the rest you need. It is not going to kill anyone to leave that load of laundry in the basket or dryer. You know what I mean. It just takes time to learn how to manage everything when you are a new mom. Good Luck Hun.|`|PbBWJGsTaa	Sorry but mine had that sleep pattern till she was around 8 months old.  Now every night she sleeps through i'm gratefull for.  As somebody else has already said, yes you need as much sleep as you can get, so aim to be in bed by 9ish.  It might seem hard at first to go to bed early, like youre missing out on your evening, but the benefits are worth it.  Believe me i understand how ill you are feeling with it.|`|2dvXGnQPaa	I know where you're coming from.  Our daughter doesn't even have a "normal" routine yet.  Lately, she'll fall asleep in her swing at around 10:30.  She fusses at around 1:30, I feed and change her and I put her in her crib, where she'll sleep from about 2:30 to 5:30, at which point she fusses and I feed and change her again.  She'll go back down in her crib, but she whines until about 8:30 when the whining becomes full-blown wailing until we feed and change her again.    I haven't managed to fit a nap in during the day because 1) I'm trying to keep my house reasonably clean, neat and tidy and because 2) the few times that I've tried, my daughter decides no, she's awake now and she wants attention.    I'm the sort of person who needs 3 or 4 hour stretches of sleep in order to feel rested.  There are times when I am so exhausted that I've just broken down and cried.  My husband then says things like, "Why didn't you come and get me?" and when it happens when it was supposed to be his shift, I just want to slap him!    I'm trying to get my husband to pick up the slack after supper so that I can go lie down, but his idea of watching her usually involves her swing or bassinet while he's on another floor entirely, which means that when she starts fussing, I hear her and end up tending to her.    Other than getting really firm and nasty to my dear hubby, sometimes I enlist the help of a relative or a trusted friend to keep an eye on the baby while I grab some sleep.|`|scAdfIJdaa	my youngest baby slept through the night the day he was born, but my eldest still wakes in the nite n up at half 6
HabNtVcKaa	I wanted to name my son Josiah Blue, but I got so much flack over the Blue part, I just decided to stick with my second choice in names. Then my husbands cousin names his son Elijah Blue and I was pretty irritated I buckled under pressure and they took my idea :(|`|T72MvudVaa	As a teacher, unique names are really hard to pronounce and I almost always get them wrong...especially if its a common name that's spelled weird. Gissel I pronounced as gih-zel but it was really Giselle. I had another that was named Licedy so I pronounced it Lice-dee, but it was really luh-say-dee. Very pretty name, but I just don't get the spelling.     I just wouldn't get too crazy with the name. Especially like you said, you may think its unique, but it turns out it might not be...    This is mostly for other people though. Zion is pretty straight-forward.|`|2dvXGnQPaa	We named our daughter Eris after a reference in a little known book.  It's the name of the Greek goddess of discord.  I found out a week ago that the friend of a coworker named her girl the same name two years before we did.|`|RmopZbXWaa	I named my daughters Christiana and Rosalyn. I think those names are neither too unique or dreadfully common.|`|IlyS8KGzaa	I named my daughter Tresa Dawn.  My moms name is Teresa, my dad's name is Don, and my sister's name is Dawn.  When I was little, I had a mug made for my mom and I spelled her name Tresa instead of Teresa, and as I got older I always vowed that if I had a girl her name would be Tresa.  I figured that no one would have that name.  Then after she was born, I found out that one of the nurse's at the hospital in the E.R. was named Tresa.  I couldn't believe it!!|`|M5E3mDBJaa	My daughter's name is unique - and I have yet to meet anyone with the name.  I do get some flack for it.  People either love it or hate it.  My brother's name is Myron, and we only know 1 other Myron.  He likes his name and I think I will use Myron as a middle name should I ever have another son.|`|W8UZebRWaa	Yep! I named him Corbin and people are always saying how they are hearing that more and more. I stole it off a movie and I guess other people did too!  My name is Jenna and back when I was born I never found anyone with it, now every other kid is named it!|`|7C9Ett7Caa	im 36 weeks pregnant and Im naming my baby girl Khiarae Karen. I love the name Khia (pronounced Kya) and my dads name is Ray and my moms name is Karen. So instead of Ray, i spelled rae and added it to khia and of course my mom's name is the middle name. I think its pretty and unique. i dont think anyone else would have this name..|`|rAkWoweOaa	I named my son Hurley. Come to find out it is a popular clothing line. Go figure.|`|VDvdrCjmaa	I'm not a mother, but my name is quite unique, but if I ever get a baby when I'm older, I'll name it something unique, maybe like Likayla or Joppen, sounds weird, but uniqueness is unique :)|`|ttbho89Vaa	my mom named me kayleigh and i always thought it was a unique way of spelling it but its not really. haha:]|`|P37lIBr2aa	My sister named her daughter Mika Skye. When she got to preschool there were TWO other Mika's in the same class! :-(|`|83j1ThU7aa	we named our son a unique name and it is unique. people ask what his name is and when i tell them they are like "?WHAT?" haha his name is Yero Messiah|`|sAAnquoTaa	Well her name isn't all that unique, but the sspelling is.|`|nfJU6jCXaa	I named my daughter Rubi ( its my middle name), but i never met one before that, now i hear every little girl named Ruby. I know it wasnt unique i just hope it doesnt become so overused. My name is Christabel and that is a unique name, i myself have never met a Christabel ever my entire life. So i gotta say i love my name.|`|aWkp6AJOaa	i have a Qeylee pronounced Keely, that is becoming very popular, not the spelling but the name.  :)  i also have a Hopper but only know of one other person with that name.  either people love it or hate it though.|`|jlpRbJpMaa	My sister has a fairly unique name: Carissa  It is unique in itself, and also the spelling of it.  I think my name, Shannon, is unique as well, though I am find more Shannons.  The only really good way to give your child a unique name is to make one up, either by combining 2 names, or otherwise.|`|hrMhhB4Saa	yep. i had only heard the name landon of few times until i had him. now i hear it EVERYWHERE!
NY2fpmvPaa	No way is that ever okay. I would never do something like that either. What is that girl thinking? What is her HUSBAND thinking, letting her do something like that to their baby?! I mean, when you drink, you get a little tipsy. You might get drunk. The next morning, you might get hungover. Okay, think about how all that feels. Then think about that happening to the little tiny unborn baby! How sad is that! Why not when it's born just give it a little bottle full of beer. I would think it's the same exact thing!|`|ZVqEDvZSaa	I dont know what kind of doctor shes going to.probably an alcoholic doctor..but anyway thats WRONG..dont ever risk it|`|RtIGiGrkaa	NO! You are not supposed to, your friend has been seriously misinformed.|`|joPJtKemaa	My doctor is very conservative so he would not allow his pregnant patients even an ounce of alcohol.    However I have heard that some doctors allow once in a while a glass of red wine. But that is once in a while not everyday and DEFINITELY NO BEER OR ANY OTHER ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE.|`|hXoUFWL1aa	No, it is absolutely not okay. Never ever okay. That woman is an idiot.|`|efyp5CaRaa	Doctors do NOT condone any type of drinking what so ever during pregnancy.|`|vdIZU4ePaa	I was told by one of my old midwives (British by the way) that a glass of wine a week wouldn't hurt. By glass of wine she did not mean "an american glass" as those are twice the size as most glasses of wine in other countries. She told me it was customary in other countries for pregnant women to partake in a glass of wine for holidays and family gatherings. I had never heard that either. I called my grandmother in ireland and she told me that they toast pregnant women with a pint! She said the doctors out there allow for a pregnant woman to have a pint of Guinness in the beginning and that sometimes they are allowed to have some from time to time for "medical" reasons.  I was also told that when struggling with milk supply, a half a can of beer can help your milk boost.    As far as your friend, I think she doesn't understand what someone was trying to tell her. I think she misunderstands. Sorry you had to go through that hun. I hope things turn out well for her.....|`|ITu6gONdaa	I dont know for sure if its ok or not but im not risking it. I wasnt a drinker before and i def am not now,nor will i be.|`|mFC2RBL3aa	No it is not right. You can have a glass of wine, but nothing else.|`|dkVAH0OKaa	it's NOT ok.... alcohol during pregnancy has been linked with mental and physical deformity......|`|d3jtRA8caa	Absolutely not, any amount of alcohol affects the fetus and can cause a variety of birth defects. She has a quack for a doctor. He should get reported or something.|`|hlq3Eo0haa	it still totally shocks me how with all the medical imformation we have people still drink alcohol. next time when u see her drinking jump on the com and type in alcohol when pregnant,let her see the damage she is doing. i hope  she never touched anything till she was at least 12 weeks cause that is when all their organs and brain is developing. call her a selfish cow for me,will you|`|rC6gL7KOaa	Most doctors will tell you it's ok to have a glass of wine every now and then. There is really no scientific proof as to how much or how little alcohol can harm the baby so that's why most women choose not to. My mom had an occasional beer when she was pregnant with me. I drank a glass of wine the other night at dinner but I would never drink hard liquor. I'm not saying it's ok or not ok though, to each his own.|`|b4d9549d46983fced7e264d76911b93aaa	If her doctor really told her that, then he is a bad doctor. The kind that should be avoided.     Alcohol is not ok while pregnant. At any amount.|`|qH6ecSa3aa	Now I heard it's ok to have a glass of wine with dinner but not like a full glass. That's it though and I would not even do that. I'm 21 weeks pregnant and my 21st birthday is next month and I'm going to a bar but bringing a "designated drinker" lol. I would never risk ANYTHING like that.|`|Nq3nuAlraa	I agree with everyone that a martini on top of a beer is a little excessive. However I have also heard that a wine or a beer VERY rarely is ok. When i was about 20 weeks, I had cramping I was concerned about. I called my Midwife and she told me to have a small glass of wine and lie down and try and get some rest and to see if that made the pains ease up. (I had been on my feet all day and running around). Granted I was worried about drinking so I didnt have anything and just laid down and it went away by morning but I have heard before from many doctors and midwives that in your second or third trimester a drink once in a great while (nothing strong like a martini or anything) is not harmful. So I guess there are two camps out there. I don't feel comfortable drinking while pregnant so haven't but I dont think a beer would hurt anything if your doc says its ok.    And I agree, just to "have a beer or a glass of wine" to say you had one makes no sense to me. The only benefit I would see from having one while pregnant is if you just had a modest amount (a glass/or botle of beer or less) to help your body relax because sometimes I think if you are starting to cramp up due to stess that it sometimes helps to get your body to relax so maybe a few sips of wine would do the trick and be less harmul to your baby than the phsyical stress your body is in....if that makes sense??     Just my opinion but again I personally do not feel comfortable having anything alcoholic while pregnant and haven't! :)|`|gve4T0Ahaa	anything you eat or drink goes to the baby too, and just think about it.... a beer can make someone buzzed what do you think the baby feels like. your pretty stupid if you think drinking even a drink now and then is ok. Any drinking is wrong, and my doctor said the same thing when i was pregnant, that doctor should be fired.|`|Z8Ui1ugLaa	I have heard the opinion that one drink is okay once in a while.  A glass of wine, but not a martini on top of a beer or a glass everyday.  I personally didn't drink anything with any of my pregnancies but there are a lot of selfish ignorant people out there who only care for themselves.|`|54cf275d0238f8dd4d90351c9a055b00aa	Some people will say that it is safe to have a mild alcoholic drink a day but I was never capable of believing it. So I guess it all depends on the person.|`|3K1QW7Oeaa	Is she retarded!?!? OF COURSE NOT!    l==the key28==l - I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU SEEM TO FIND ME BUT IT'S REALLY GETTING ANNOYING THAT YOU FOLLOW ME AND ANSWER EVERY QUESTION I ANSWER!! PLEASE STOP!!|`|UYfqzCoMaa	NO it is not ok to drink while you are pregnant. I don't know what the hell her doctor is telling her. She needs a new doctor that ISN"T crazy!!|`|abT0o6hHaa	light to moderate drinking during pregnancy has never been linked to any problems

ZVqEDvZSaa	how do we know if your late!! god damn it..take a test.|`|NFt3h7dHaa	You could definitely be pregnant--but I wouldn't be suspicious if I were you unless there were other symptoms, which would could be having if you are pregnant.    If you're not pregnant, and you'd like to stay that way, I'd VERY strongly recommend more active birth control methods.  My then-boyfriend, now-husband did it ONE time for ONE minute and we've got a little girl who's due in less than 3 weeks now.  They aren't making that stuff up.    Lots of things can make periods late, though.  Pregnancy is only one of them.  If you're sure you are late, it wouldn't hurt to take a test.    Good luck!|`|egpVC6uMaa	You should be less worried about being pregnant and more worried about getting HIV. Seriously!|`|cY8DgJv5aa	Yes, it sounds like you are late.  Take a test to see if you are pregnant or not or just wait a few more days to see if your period comes.  Periods can be late for lots of reasons.|`|qgHnSVKoaa	I am five months pregnant their could be a chance you are pregnant but Jan. is not even over yet so I would trip just yet.  You wont get signs until like two to three months into your pregnancy so far your ok but if you dont want to be pregnant then you better go check it out before its to late
GZn5VNlSaa	It is very likely that you've made yourself infertile.  That's a consequence of abortion.    However if you're trying for a baby now, and it's been over a year then go to a doctor. BUT if it's only just a few months since you've tried, then there's still a chance you can get pregnant.    Even healthy women take forever to get pregnant.  Stay positive, don't stress and hopefully that will bring you a baby.|`|7zf05NWsaa	It could mean that the doctor who you allowed to kill your baby made you sterile.    This is a typical outcome of an abortion.|`|mFC2RBL3aa	You need to go get a check up. My cousin had an abortion and now she can't have no kids. She needs to adopt.|`|H0fXySX9aa	having an abortion does not mean you cant conceive   it could be your not having sex when you ovulate or your not ovulating properly  if you want a baby maybe a health check will help you good luck|`|EZcBe3C8aa	No just because you had an abortion doesn't mean you will never be able to have kids. Stress could be the reason you are not pregnant. Go see a doctor. They will tell you for sure but i think you are fine. sometimes getting pregnant the 2nd time around is a lot harder. Believe me it took me over a year to get pregnant with my daughter.|`|AA11476782	It is possible, but not likely.  Many women who have had abortions go on to have healthy babies later in life.  Many women (whether or not they've had an abortion) don't get pregnant the first month or two that they try.  If you have regular periods, I would think you will eventually be able to have a child.  It took me three-four months after stopping birth control pills to be able to conceive.|`|hSJnaysiaa	Sorry about all the rude people on here. And to the rude people- you know, its hard enough to go through an abortion and all the emotions afterwards without hearing people call you a murderer, she probably feels bad enough without your input. It was her choice, and on her conscience, you don't know her story. Who the hell are all of you to judge her? Religious fools.    Anyway, I had an abortion in 2005 and now am pregnant. Sometimes it just takes your body a while to get back in sync with ovulation. The only way the abortion could affect future pregnancies is if you had NUMEROUS abortions which lead to scar tissue, which can make it tough to get pregnant. Typically with just one abortion though you should be fine (they would have told you if anything had gone wrong during the procedure).    It could be that you haven't had sex during the ovulation window, could be due to stress or diet, could be you're not ovulating regularly.    You could try ovulation prediction kits.    No matter what though don't listen to people calling you a murderer. They are no better than you and are not in a position to judge you. And for the one lady who said god is punishing you- did god give you the right to judge her? Christians are the most judgmental people I will ever encounter. And I'm not religious, but I do know that Jesus didn't want people judging each other.|`|wrw7Yk8Gaa	go have sex|`|LTEdoVQwaa	There is a slight chance that something could've gone wrong with the abortion, but if so your doctor would've let you know about it. Abortions are very safe nowadays, and women that have them are able to go on and get pregnant. It could be that it's just taking you longer this time around to get pregnant. I wouldn't give up just yet. But if you are feeling worried about your chances, go to the doctor that did your abortion and talk to him/her about it. They'd be able to give you the best answers. Good luck.|`|eFQgVjTjaa	Well this first part is for all the people in here who are being nasty to you.....whats done is done.  Do not harp on her now because of her past.  some people make mistakes and learn from them, we arent human if we dont and its not right for anyone to be condeming her.....And for you!  If god doesnt think that you are ready or that you have learned your lesson I dont think he will bless you with a baby.  It will happen when the time is right and when it does embrace it and cherish it.  Some cases of abortion have been associated with women being unable to have kids.  Thats not true for everyone though.  I just think that maybe the time isnt right.  Dont do it if you arent ready...|`|6a0cd0391065cc81ea4518dae3754040aa	No. If anything had gone wrong with the abortion to affect your fertility (be it injury or infection), you would've known then. Abortion in and of itself does not negate fertility, at all. My mother had an abortion when she was fifteen (she had been raped by her cousin), and went on to have seven--that's right, SEVEN children. (You can see a picture of all of us here: http://www.shareapic.net/zoom.php?id=845... )    If you're really concerned, you can see a doctor. Odds are good there's nothing wrong and it's just taking a little longer. (It might not even be taking longer, so much as seeming longer, because you're paying such close attention.)    Good luck, and I wish you all the best!|`|VB5midTraa	you could have kids all you need to do is go to a doctor and have them check you. dont worry about it too much, just be patient and please go to the doctor. its your health. take care of urself and good luck!

Tell her that you know things like this was not as important to her when she was a kid, but she was tougher then you and different, That this is important to you. also tell her that if she doesn't want to go with you to the store to get it that you could go with a friend if she wouldn't mind giving you some money. (like 10-20 dollars)|`|owpjHPOxaa	You know, there are bras between "no coverage" and "padded" like just a normal bra... it won't show nipples!    But just ask her, she'll understand (mine did XD)  or, go shopping with her and say you need a new bra.  Pick one out but don't tell her it's got padding in it...  or just buy one yourself.

AA11543924	False positives are extremely rare - if the pregnancy hormone HCG is there, even in a minute amount, it will show up. If you're not pregnant there's no HCG and therefore the test won't be positive.  It could be a false negative, but test again at the end of the week. It should be clearer by then.  Also, some pregnancy tests have a 'discard result after 20 minutes' thing, so the test result could be due to that.|`|QB5D0rG4aa	I have the same symptoms.

I am a regular at the gym every morning and I am finding it hard for me to get up to go and I am more sleepy than usual. I tool two tests said I was negative. I asked a nurse who I work with and she thinks I am taking the test two early and I need to wait another week. I would try again in a couple of days when the hormone is stronger in your body. Good Luck. Baby Dust.....|`|VBOroQKUaa	i wouldnt take notice of the first test as your ment to get rid of it after 20mins!! i would wait and see if you get them by the end of the week and then go to the doc!  but good luck!!
HCmAoNjzaa	I would probably ask him not to go if it's not going to be a big deal to his employer.|`|MAh2yKFnaa	well think of if it is beneficial to get hubby to stay away from his job if it is not a big deal have a happy lovey week at home with him if he really needs to go start the clomid later.|`|tfTQ6Cuuaa	Can he go midweek or is it all or nothing? Can you go with him? You going with him would be the ideal situation if it is feasible.     If neither of those are possible, I'd say try next cycle if him skipping out could cause any sort of hardship (ticking off his boss, extra work on his coworkers, losing his job, loss of revenue) but if it really is no big deal like he says, have him stay home.     So my final answer...go with him if you can. If not, tell him to stay home as long as its really ok and he's not just saying that to be nice and supportive (which is nice of him too lol).    GOOD LUCK!!|`|GcJszsMnaa	If you've been trying for at least 6-mon to a year..An if ur hubby don't mind calling off then I would let him...If he's willing to to that...That's a very nice thing to do for his wife...I'd also...Baby dance everyday...that he is home in case he can't after all...Good Luck hun....|`|d233c5a2e4e12b8e3298613c249d71b4aa	If it were me I would wait until next cycle.  How do you know when you will ovulate on Clomid?  I ovulated around cycle day 19 or 20 when on it.  That is normal to ovulate late when on Clomid.  So consider that in your schedule.  Also I didn't even ovulate my first cycle on Clomid so if you wanted to could chance it and take this cycle to see how your body responds and of course make sure to have as much intercourse as you can just in case.    Best wishes!|`|WjxqhZG9aa	I would just wait until the next cycle.  This way you know what to expect during your ovulation period.  You'll be able to experience it from a more objective point of view which will likely help when the next time comes around.    Best of luck!|`|k0QRfQ00aa	He said it is no big deal he won't go if you don't want him to, so tell him to stay. It is hard enough as is while taking clomid. Who knows you might actually get a bfp on the clomid. So tell him to stay! Have fun and the best of luck to you!!|`|pW3G1onIaa	thiers not much we can say   if ur husband has an option of not going     go for it girl no thinking about     but if its an issue then wait til next mth     best of luck

The problem for you, would be the cost.  Because of their being in the City of Chicago.    Outside the city limits is cheaper but, less spacious.  It ends up being, 'you get what you pay for'.
Ka52nbhNaa	You cannot tell by the heartbeat - I had twins - one boy and one girl.  Their heart rates fluctuated between 140 - 150 during the entire pregnancy and they took turns being the faster one.|`|sBHhnDwaaa	My son's has never been below 145. It got up to 175 in the ER (thought my water had broken so he was being monitered)|`|cSm1zod4aa	I am pregnant with a boy and his heartbeat is currently 149 I am 20 weeks pregnant and It was 160 at 17 weeks. Don't use heartbeat to guess babies gender because its never right. Heartbeat changes constantly and takes a while to adjust to a constant rate.|`|joPJtKemaa	They say for a girl its 140 and up and for a boy its lower than 140.    I think its all a myth.|`|rC6gL7KOaa	I'm 18 weeks with a girl. Heart rate is 144|`|8zdPI8Qsaa	My boy went against the grain and always had a high heart rate (low 160s throughout my pregnancy), so I don't really believe the hype anymore :-)|`|5OsSGCdAaa	when i was pregnant with my baby girl her heartbeat was 140-165...|`|IExPOxpHaa	140 and up is supposed to be a girl.  My baby's heartbeat has been in the 160s the entire time and I'm having a boy.  I guess you can't really go by the heartbeat.
WXExyAlWaa	There is still a chance, yes, just wait until the end of the month to see if you get your period. Try not to stress too much. If it didn't happen this month, there's always next time.|`|HkAK6ZRoaa	i don't really know it's just too much explaination you might be.
44OH7Si6aa	Chicken pox starts usually first break out on the abdomen back and face, not the legs and they aren't just red spots, they are filled with fluid. There are other illnesses it could be, there are also parasites that would cause red itchy spots; take him to a doctor|`|3e354ee85999a7bc21252e59e538dc35aa	Better make an appt with the doctor, do you have any pets, maybe fleas. Bug bites.|`|DKqsFGymaa	Doesn't sound like chicken pox.  Chicken pox do start on the tummy or lower back and start in a small circle and spread from there.  It doesn't take that long for the spreading to start.    It sounds like some sort of insect bite and if he itched it on the first day that would be why there are more spots the second day.  Just keep an eye on the spots, but probably nothing to worry about as long as there is no fever.
aymBTRlyaa	Depends on the kid. My daughter was talking in sentences at less than 2 years. She's so smart. :-))|`|ZDqG0CzWaa	In our health book from our nurse it says by 2 they should be saying at least 20 words and anywhere up to 50. My daughter is 21 months and she says roughly about 20 words but most of them she just says when she hears us say them or we ask her to say it. Our friends have a girl that 6 months younger then our daughter and she is speaking in small sentences. so i think it really just depends on the child and u should stress about it. I have heard that boys language develops later then girls so this might also be something to consider|`|SQmqc6JMaa	There is no normal rating as every child is different!  Some walk at nine months, some walk at 14 months.  Some don't really talk till 2.  I am nannying a 15 month old, and he can say up, and he mumbles the word mom and more...but his vocabulary hasn't exceeded that.  It's nothing to worry about, it will happen eventually when they are ready.  With potty training you can just let them sit on the potty and play and then reward them when they go, but that young is hard...they don't really understand. But making the potty a normal daily thing, having them sit on it every morning or have them sit on it while you do and make it fun, is a good way to introduce it.|`|PYSMK0JBaa	My boys didn't say much at that age...I would say 5-10 words. To me, this is too young to potty train. It is much much easier when they are 2-2 1/2 years old.|`|W8UZebRWaa	I asked something  like this earlier b/c my son is a slow talker. Someone told me her 21 month old is speaking full sentences and holding conversations. That is just rubbish.  You've still got sometime before potty training. Take it one step at a time.   My son is 21 months old and says about 5-7 words. The Ped said he's on track, as long as he's getting what we are saying theres nothing to worry about.|`|3F8f1SoQaa	that is a little behind. I would worry. Children should be saying about 2 dozen words by 18 months and 5 dozen words by age 2. they should also be saying short sentences such as "more milk" "want juice" and "mommy car". My son was only saying 10 words at 2 years old and I was told that he was 12 months behind in his speech.    The best thing that you can do for your son is to contact your local early intervention program. The local WIC office, health department or elementary school can give you the contact information. EI is a program meant to make sure that children do not start school with treatable delays. Here in Ohio where I live they only treat kids under the age of 3. Once the child turns 3 they go to special needs preschool to continue thier therapy. My son has been in therapy for his speech delay for almost a year now and I have not had to pay for any of it.    Just because your child needs a little speech therapy does not mean that your child is slow. My son is very smart and his delay was holding him back. Once he was able to communicate we were able to see how smart he is...
NH2Yg2x3aa	I took a test within the 4 day window, can't remember exactly when but it came out negative. The day I was supposed to have my period. literally less than 4 days later it came out positive, so considering the price of home tests I would wait. I know you're probably anxious but just because it says no doesn't mean it's true.|`|1WRB7RPNaa	Yes, i did, i got a vary faint second line and continued to get that line until it got darker :0|`|DYJOpfvraa	Yes! I used the Clear Blue Digital Test 4 days before my missed period and got a clear "Pregnant"|`|0858c5efb8f0aba55efb484929da352caa	I took one 4 days early and there were definitely 2 lines- a little faint, but definitely there :)|`|c9f4279bebedb22d9e19c5e1bfb2b685aa	i took a test when i was only 2 and a half weeks pregnant and it came up with a strong dark positive

Your ob can prescribe you something that is safe to take to help you keep things down.    As for flying as long as your ob knows you should be fine,  I just would not fly after your 7th month.    I would also find out what your company policy is on pregnancy and flying.|`|5OsSGCdAaa	well for the throwing up part...u should go to a motherhood maternity store and get some preggie drops...they helped me alot...|`|b4d9549d46983fced7e264d76911b93aaa	About the flying question, you should ask your doctor that.   But the morning sickness is normal. I had it soo bad too. I was at the point where I was in total amazement thinking about how many women have more than 1 kid. I would throw up morning, noon, and nite. My doctor gave me some pills that where supposed to help, but they didn't. Just don't worry, it will be over soon. Eat what ever works with you rite now. Crackers, sipping ginger ale, nibble on some cheese.... what ever.     My morning sickness started to go away once I hit 4 months pregnant. And it went from 2-3 times a day of feeling sick, to 1 time a week. But now I'm 2 days into my 6th month, and I feel great.     Just hang in there.|`|xBW4saqgaa	its normal and im sure as days go by you will get used to it. yeah you can fly until you are 6 months after that you need to be very careful. god bless and take good care.|`|eFQgVjTjaa	The severe morning sickness is totally common and normal.  I had it with baby 1 and this one too.  I was in the hospital 2 weeks agao because I was vomiting blood.  I was vomiting sooo much and so violently that I broke blood vessels.  You need to be sure you arent dehydrated.  I didnt think I was but they gave me 2 bags of IV's.  and even though most women on here will disagree with me when I tell you this but I would check with your doc about ZOFRAN. It is the only thing that saved me.  Its an anti vomit pill. AND COMPLETELY SAFE.  If I dont take it I go right back to the exact same place I was in 2 weeks ago.  I have spoken with 2 OBGYN's 2 ER doctors a pharmacist and 2 of my pharmacology professors in college and they ALL agree that it is safe to take for an un-prolonged amount of time.  Its safe to fly up to a certain point in your pregnancy.  after you hit the middle of your 3rd trimester they probably wont let you on the plane anymore because of safetly protocals....seriously get the zofran|`|bfmoMc4Haa	yes sweetie its very normal and strong morning sickness is a good sign of a strong and healthy pregnancy,    mine started at 6 weeks and i was so sick morning, noon and night. it lasted till 20 weeks and i was damn miserable. i tried everything but eventually my doctor perscribed Zofran to help ease nausea and vomiting and it did help alot.    im now 34 weeks pregnant with a healthy baby on the way. try to rest and sip water and small snacks. try sea bands that you wear on your wrist these can help and also dry crackers. try to take a prenatal vitamin to help baby develop.     flying should be ok up until you are 7 months preg but if your nausea is bad you should request a change of position to ground staff because flying will make your condition alot worse!! dont be afraid to explain your situation or seek doctors advice on this, good luck  congrats on your pregnancy!
d5e3g4LEaa	Hi there,  Really could go either way - those symptons also sound like PMS.  I highly suggest going to Rite-Aide or CVS to purchase a First Response pregnancy test which can pick up on the pregnant hormone up to 5 days before your missed period.  They are impressively accurate and moderately priced.  Less than $20.  I would follow that up with getting yourself on the pill or purchasing a secondary form of birth control.    Had a girlfriend in highschool that was so stressed over the exact same thing and she just got her period late.  Had another on who ended up having an abortion which was very tramatic for her.  Don't know your thoughts on whether a pregnancy would be good or bad news, please don't be offended - here is a website that I checked out when I was younger and in a similar situation - www.sisterzeus.com   it has a wealth of alternative and holistic information on it.  Please take care of yourself and make wise decisions.  Your are young and have your whole life ahead of you.  Don't let the heat of the moment lead to a complete change of life, it's great to be in love - I am 30 and pregnant with my first child from my high school sweetheart, but I also finished college, have a master's degree, and a ton a life experience in between our high school days and today.  Best of luck to you!  Vicki V    Also - the day after pill only works THE DAY AFTER, not 3 or 4 weeks|`|1whTwTbDaa	I think you need to take a test hun...you sound pregnant to me. The brown spotting is called implantation bleeding if you are pregnant. I had that with 2 of my kids. I think you should get a test...or go to a free-clinic in your area. If it is positive they can help you make decisions, find a doctor, and give you tips on how to tell your parents and other family without them freaking out. Good luck sweetie, I hope all turns out well.|`|1PGmB4JNaa	did the condom break? i mean if it didn't slip off or anything i dont think you could be, might be stress but go ahead and check or take a morningafter pill|`|8V39PymEaa	hun,you can be pregnant just go to the doctors to take a urine or blood test and see what they say|`|zFQi5U5Naa	take the test that is the only way|`|o2epStcnaa	you should take the pregnancy test|`|SBEAOwdJaa	it sounds like you could be pregnant. go to your doctor and/or get a pregnancy test. getting more then one test would be good because if you just get one, then theres a chance that it would not be accurate...

WgIZUcYfaa	I was on birth control pills and I'm 15 weeks now. You may be pregnant but it also may be your birth control pills. Take a test and see for sure.

I'm on DepoVera shot and I don't get my period for months at a time. Just take a pregnancy test and see.|`|OS8TRe0Uaa	you probably arent pregnant unless the condom broke. is it the stress and ya your birth control can hold it back just go to the doctor to get checked out. dont be scared happened to me before|`|dcNmRPGPaa	birth control can affect the period and neither condom nor birth control on 100%. if you're worried take a test :)|`|WXExyAlWaa	Birth control actually stops your period - the bleeding you get when you take the white pills is sort of like a withdrawal symptom from stopping the chemicals. It is _possible_ that you could be pregnant but it's very unlikely. A home pregnancy test is pretty cheap though, so you might as well invest in one just to soothe your fears.|`|rgu5UZbLaa	it might be the birth control messing with your system but i could also have something to do with what you have been eating and how much you have been sleeping. But still you should get checked just in case.|`|IhehUcmYaa	hmmm..... could be stress.... u may be pregno!!! see a DR!!!|`|363YPQ62aa	It could just be stress but go to the doc just to make sure.

Your doctor should have told you that if you  have any irregularities with the pill and your period not arriving to go back for a check up.    If you're taking birth control correctly, as you say you are, then you do not need to use a condom ... however I would suggest using one to protect against std's ... especially if you and your boyfriend are young, teenagers/young adults are pretty promiscuous now days    I suggest taking an over the counter pregnancy test asap - if it's negative go see your obgyn and explain the problem.    Rapid weight loss can sometimes prevent you from having your period, as well as lots of stress.  To know for sure you should visit the DOCTOR :)    good luck|`|47QQGoelaa	i am pretty sure that u are not but just go to the doctors just in case(:|`|P9WUGMzkaa	birth control?  youre not pregnant|`|ZupHAyNuaa	I think too many birth control pills could be the problem|`|lhg9bqUTaa	sometimes the pills can actually cause an effect on how your monthy cycle goes. but i would see a doctor, one of my friends mothers had them while she was on the pill. and dont be too nervous, talk it over with your doctor. most likely its the pills chanqinq the cycle, and if u also  had a condom theres less a chance your preqnant.  [: hope i helped somewhat.|`|rcEvWB1kaa	chances are you ARENT pregnant.  however, if you've just started a new birth control, or been uber stressed lately, it's just your body reacting.  i would suggest getting one of the cheapy dollar pregnancy tests at dollar general and taking it.  a lot of times if you think you may be taking the test and getting a negative is all you need to set your mind and body right.  it's happened to me before...and trust me, that dollar test sayin no is just the right amount of relief to allow your stress levels to go down enough to start your period.  if you still havent started in a few weeks, try goin to a doctor, or just calling your ob-gyn and asking the nurse for some advice.  they can be very helpful.|`|wpzkgkyLaa	your chances are very low but un like the answer one person left that just simply said "birth control, your not pregnant" I will tell you that many babies are born to mothers who were on birth control when they got pregnant allot of women's bodies don't take to the birth control meds. how ever in less there was something defective with those condoms like wholes were poked in it or it broke then your chances are even lower BUT you should take a pregnancy test!   1. if you are pregnant you need to know, and your going to know, eventually, but its always better to find out as early as you can, regardless your believes or feelings on how you handle it   2. if your not pregnant then oh well you spent $1-$15 on a pregnancy test just to calm your nervous ($1 because yes the dollar store does sell pregnancy tests and i'm sure thier are more exspensive tests then $15 but if you ask any doctor they will tell you they all work the same)|`|gve4T0Ahaa	Thats the same thing that happened to me and guess what, I now have an 11 month old..... anything could happen!

Plus, he only had a slight speech problem that corrected itself by kindergarten. The surgery lasted 15 minutes. No pain afterward. Good luck I know it is a hard decision, but if I had it to do over again, I would get the tubes for my oldest...all the frustration and kids picking on him because of his speech was so hard on him.

5DJcir9saa	Thats perfectly normal.  I don't have a dining room table and I have a house!  We have a large kitchen counter practically like an island but its not free standing) and we have a couple bar stools that we use at it.  As far as eating in the living room goes, who cares?  As far as family time is concerned, there are lots of ways to have family time w/o eating at the table together.  When  your kids are older and everyone is really busy doing there own thing, then you might want to make sure you have a table....that way you can enforce dinner time as family time.|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	Is this a temporary situation?

Be thankful you have food because a lot of people don't, and try to remember what's important in life, as long as it works for your family.  That will transfer down to your kids in a more positive way than having all the "things" does.|`|58b352907ba2def5e2248c3df2e55128aa	I don't see anything wrong with not having a dining table. My husband and I eat on the couch while we watch tv and my son used to sit in his high chair but now he is going through a phase where he wants to walk around and eat. We have a dining table, but it's just for looks. It's mostly just there for when we have company over and for us to throw stuff on when we come in the door.|`|nfzQkvqraa	I couldn't do without a dining room table, because it motivates us to eat as a family.  We also play games and do crafts on our table.  But if your only concern with not having one is what others will think about it,  I wouldn't buy one.  If you know its of no use to you, why bother.|`|AA11895525	Do you really care what people think?  I personally think that you should have your home be comfortable for you and your family - if that means not having a dining table until your child's out of their high chair then that's what's right for you!|`|r5AbT6tmaa	will it look wrong to whom? You don't have to have a dining room table. It sounds like it's not a necessity in your home.|`|92529423230d8afd2de97a390c4c8c8faa	I don't think you need a dining room table. When I was a mother of one we lived in a small apartment and did not have a dining room table. Now I am a mother of four and my family lives in a house and we have a dining room table where we eat our family meals.

IlyS8KGzaa	I'm not married either, and I got to choose who's name went on the birth certificate.  It's completely up to you.    Tapestry::  Why would you even say a shitty thing like that?  I'm not married and I provide an excellent life for my child in my opinion.  I'm all the "Family"  she needs.  Well, me and all her "Aunties" and "Uncles"  (my friends) lol|`|dXVA1wHDaa	Whichever you choose the baby to have.  There's no law about naming your baby with the dad's name.|`|bfc067ab537555ada57edd464a8dfb97aa	The father of the child can sign paternity paperwork that makes him the father of the child on the birth certificate.  You can leave it blank but remember that child is going to ask why its blank eventually.  If you can't make a good family for this child consider adoption.|`|hrMhhB4Saa	whoever's last name you want it to have|`|AA11981363	you can have it as you request it, so If I were you I would just put my last name in it. If the father is not around why should she have his last name?|`|3X0t8JrXaa	Totally up to the mother.|`|3gXQPso5aa	you decide that yourself!|`|AA10424047	Whichever you choose. The baby can have your last name, his last name, both or a different last name altogether. Allow me to explain.    If the baby is born, and the father is not involved, the baby can have the mother's last name. This is true even if the father is involved.    If the baby is born and the father is involved, the baby can have the father's last name. This is true even in the father is not involved, but I do not know of very many cases like that.    The baby can have both your last names, hyphenated. For example, Baby Smith-Jones, or Baby Jones-Smith. Normally it goes alphabetically, although I have know of some cases where it went Mothers-Fathers, regardless of stance in the alphabet.    In the case of a completely different last name, you can only do this if there is native heritage or for religious reasons. Both parents must agree to this and show proof that the different last name is, indeed, for religious or native purposes.    Good luck and congrats!|`|AA10943329	that depends on what you write as the last name. You need to decide which last name you want the child to have|`|4YIUxSlYaa	In the UK you decide the babies name, including surname.|`|olF9Hl6saa	As far as I know, you get to choose!|`|P6WvViFjaa	You decide the name of your baby.|`|AxSX61eoaa	You can have whatever you want put on there. You don't have to put the fathers name on there but there should be a space for it.|`|awRNr2VMaa	if he signs the birth certificate baby gets his last name|`|RmopZbXWaa	You can give the baby your name or your bf's last name. It's up to you.|`|siDcjgJCaa	Its up to the parents to decide. you can put any name you would like.|`|fy69hAeQaa	You get to choose. So, if you want to put your last name you can.|`|Vad64Jjoaa	You fill out the birth certificate so you can put whatever last name you want on there. It doesn't matter if the father signs the birth certificate or not, you could still put the fathers last name on there if you wanted to.|`|5OsSGCdAaa	you can choose...me and my baby girls daddy wasnt marriesd and she has his last name..|`|698b3b0b5ebf7083a923b4bde2eb3921aa	if you are not married as the mother it is your choice. I had one and I gave it dad's name(i regret it now cause he skipped on me) the second one I said no way and it has my name.     I live in central alabama. If the father wants to be on the certificate he has to sigh a paternity affidavit to even be listed as father. try to get that even if you give him your name then when you go for child support he can't deny the kid.|`|eHow24rNaa	You get to choose who's last name she will have. When i had my daughter, i wasnt married either but i did choose the fathers last name since i will soon be married to her dad. You have the chose to put yours or his. My mom wasnt married either when she had me but she chose her last name for me...many women chose their own last names if they arent married so dont feel ashamed or bad if you chose your own name. But if you know your going to marry ur childs father, then chose his. Good luck!!|`|sAAnquoTaa	If you both want him on it and he's there to sign it then yes he will be.|`|13bf9874413959dbd425a6a84c9b9159aa	right now it is your choice  remember if there is any doubt as to the father you better not put the fathers name there  it is costly to change later on  also if you should be still single when the child goes to school its usually easier to have your last name  good luck|`|sqdsIHwAaa	the baby will have your name unless the dad comes with you to register the baby and signs the book as well,|`|my6AKy6Eaa	You decide I wasn't married when I had my son but he still took on his fathers last name.|`|SIrmqu5maa	I live in atlanta ga. Here if your not married the child can have the fathers last  name if he shows his id and signs the birth certificate at the hospital.|`|e82a823b890a1b465c57df534fd4f153aa	Your choice.  If I were you I'd use your last name.|`|SkCnQHceaa	You have the option. My sister just had a baby and she is not married either. She chose for her son to carry her name for now. If she decides to marry the father later they can legally change his name then.|`|mvHs43Ldaa	You definitely get to decide the baby's name even if the Dad signs the birth certificate you decide the last name|`|POSGHgzuaa	You decide.  In some states, if the dad is present at birth, then he can be listed as the father on the birth certificate but if he's not, it's a huge ordeal to have him listed.  You may want to look into this in Alabama.|`|Qfq4lpe7aa	You fill out a piece of paper at the hospital and you put whatever last name you want him/her to have...|`|vmWEm4Jzaa	i used to live right near there in pensacola! anyhow- you can put your last name and i think if you put his last name for the baby he has to be on the birth cert. but that might vary by state. use your own though if you are not married.|`|723QHuicaa	Its something you and the father must come to an agreement over. There are no laws to say the baby must have a certain name. Im not married, but it was our choice to give our daughter her father's surname.|`|vKEYa8aeaa	it will have whatever name you choose =] congrats
RrgQUT5vaa	Okay, I agree that it is sad that the grandparents didn't get to adopt their kids.  But I can't believe that the only reason is age.  Or maybe it is just the difference in countries.      Those kids have been in foster care for 2 years!  They need to be out whatever it takes.  And why is going with a gay couple horrible?  Are you saying that us gay people should be able to adopt only after every straight couple possible has had their chance?  So, if kids are so bad that straight people don't want them, throw them to the gays, huh?      We must deserve eachother...you know, us gays and the worst of the worst foster children.    I am thankful at this moment that they didn't go around "looking" for a straight couple to adopt my kids.  The babies would have been grabbed up and the older children would still be with us because no one else would want them.  And then my kids wouldn't be growing up with their sibling group of 7.  How sad for them that they are stuck with gay parents.|`|AA12349988	Well in the UK - the government gives the council money for adopting out children.  The grandparents needs social workers to visit.  Adoption is cheaper.    Slavery alive and kicking in the UK.    I am disgusted by the antics of Edinburgh Council and saddened that the only reason that homophobic piece of sh1t the Daily Mail picks up on the fact is that it is two men and fails to look at the bigger issue of adoption in the UK.    Murderers and Rapist are freed and allowed to get on with their lives but a 26 year old RECOVERING drug user has a life sentance without her children    Mamma Kate agree with you 100%|`|8Qxb7OZOaa	AGAIN.....what kind of Pap would fight the natural family on this. If they want children so desperately they should just have some themselves or foster children that need to homes. These children already HAVE a home.    Something is seriously wrong with the court systems.    It sounds like its all about POLITICS instead of the best interest of the children.       I guess according to that judge I will be too old to care for my 7 yr. old when I turn 46.  Unbelievable.|`|355b8dca4624a65380892a4d414c9d3faa	That is tragic and wrong. Those grandparents should have been the first choice by social services. Shame on them.    Talk about putting the knife in ....and then twisting it.|`|S5Lsbh0taa	There was no neglect or abuse happening in the grandparents house. so why was social services involved at all once the kids were with them. And if the little girl is hesitant with men then the kids shouldn't have placed them with a male gay couple. If anything the grandparents should have a say in this case where the kids go.     This really had nothing to do with weather a couple was infertile or gay. It was about taking the kids from family who wanted to care for them and placing them in a family that was unsuitable to the kids needs. That could have been a couple who are very fertile- and not suitable to adopt those kids.|`|biqMTkWbaa	This is so sad|`|hzgFAJv0aa	Dear Lady Moon,    This story made me sick when I saw it. I almost posted a question about it myself. My issue with this is not the "gay aspect" of this situation, but rather the fact that these social workers are:     A.) Obviously not interested in what the children think. "Social workers themselves have admitted that the little girl is 'more wary' of men than women. "     and    B.) BLACKMAILING the grandparents into agreeing to the adoption ."'You can either accept it, and there's a chance you'll see the children twice a year, or you can take that stance and never see them again.'"     The reasons that the GPs are being given about not being qualified are ridiculous.    Too old?! They are 46 & 59!! There are people still HAVING babies at that age! Are they going to start taking kids from older parents now?! Is there some magic age between 20 something and 30 something that is the only time people are capable of parenting??!?!?!?    And the so-called health issues?!    The man has angina and the woman has diabetes. Both are highly manageable, non-fatal issues that generally have good prognosis and quality of life when properly treated. People parent with far more "interfering" health issues.    Then I have heard people argue that the GPs are responsible for having raised a heroin addict (bio-mom). This really chaps me. I seriously doubt that this mother was doing heroin while in the care of her parents. I would bet that her problem started AFTER she left home and was an adult (WHEN HER PARENTS WERE NO LONGER RESPONSIBLE FOR HER DECISIONS.) I would bet $$$ on that particular issue being from a poor choice of romantic relationships and/or friends. I bet these poor people have already suffered the loss of their daughter to drugs and now they are literally RAILROADED out of their grandchildren.    These are not babies either. These are OLDER (4 & 5) children who are AWARE of what is going on. Where is the consideration for their bond with their grandparents?!     I couldn't care less that the people adopting are gay. What I DO care about is how these children will feel. They have been victimized by their mother and then the system. Just awful. My heart goes out to them.    I also don't understand how so many people can still think that no one in the agencies that deal with families never abuse their power. I am not saying it happens all the time but it DOES happen. Most people in this line of work are good people who do their difficult and emotionally straining jobs with care and do them well, but I cannot ignore that there are some people who do not. JMHO.|`|r7q8LW7Aaa	what a horrible story, those poor kids.  And they did say that the little girl is more comfortable with women, they could at least send them to a couple which include a woman in order to help the transition!  So much for priority to blood relatives.|`|jrCZ6fadaa	What is a shame it that, they weren't informed that if they are caring for children who are place outside of their biological home and not yet adopted, that they will qualify for Medicaid making their care possible...... And really they aren't that old. There are people their age with kids their grandkids age, should those kids be removed? This is just sad.|`|iVcaB9h7aa	This makes absolutely no sense to me.  Either we're missing something or there was money moving under the table.  No other explanation seems plausible.    It's appalling.|`|Ah6FJHkWaa	When the hell did 49 become too old to keep your grandchild?>????  WTF?>|`|RKcwfrGOaa	I'm almost the same age as the grandmother, and my daughter is 4.  What a bunch of garbage.  And if the little girl is not comfortable around men, how can it be in her best interest to have two men as parents?  I couldn't care less about the gay issue.  Gay people are entitled to their own children.  They're not entitled to the children of others.  Scream discrimination all you want.  This isn't about you.  What an awful story.|`|dqZrq7Zeaa	OHHH I bet there's a lot more to this then an un-respected paper like the DailyMail is reporting.|`|uVbTJw9daa	That's horrible. Kow can those men live with themselves knowing they too the kids from a loving home? And on what planet is 46 considered to old to care for children. I know women who have giving birth in their forties, they are great moms. And 59 is not ancient either. Whats with the kangaroo courts in Scotland|`|VDWzEw3aaa	sickening.|`|AA11987492	This is just so sad, ugh, it just makes me wanna cry. The gay thing doesn't bother me, but why would ANYONE want to adopt these kids when they have loving family willing to raise them?|`|frpCK0utaa	MamaKat , i totally agree. It just seems theres a total disregard here for the childrens well being and feelings. The grandparents are nowhere near old and it does seem they were blackmailed.    Teresa:I see nothing wrong with gay parents adopting, just so you know. Those that do, go take a long walk off a short pier.|`|TTS9cvUmaa	I second everything Serenity said. Whats this got to do with infertile or gay couples. Its a tragedy when the grandparents who wanted to parent did not get that choice and the kids were placed out side the family. But why kick the infertile and gay couples for what social services did wrong?|`|1Xwzf09gaa	If this couple who is adopting those children had any heart at all, they would allow the adoption to finalize and then turn around and give them to the grandparents.    Once the children are adopted, social services shouldn't be able to interfere and stop it.  I would send the kids to the grandparents and then smuggle them out of country.    But that is just me.|`|zJXCbrjyaa	Why does this article make out that the gay couple adopting the children are the ones to blame, when all they're doing is offerring to raise two children?    What about the mother who cares more about her drugs then those poor little kids? Why doesn't she feature in the article?  What about the fact that the system is so flawed - it has to be if they can get away with threatening biological family members!!    If the grandparents wanted to raise the children, they should have been allowed to - at the very most the kids should have been fostered out, not adopted, if Social Services were so worried about their welfare.    Sorry, i'm just so mad at the "gay agenda" slant that was put on that...|`|7aCH91ISaa	When I first saw the heading of the article I was thinking they were in their 70's or 80's. They are not that old. Many people are having their own kids at that age. My mother is in her mid 50's and is raising my 7year old niece. My now adopted son was sent to live with his grandparents when we were fostering. They were in their late 70's.    I have nothing against people that are gay adopting, but in this case, when the little girl is wary of men she should not be adopted by two men.     (((Just a Mom))) Great answer!!|`|in6Iw3BEaa	I don't understand the rationale.  Assuming that the woman is 46 and the man is 59, it's very plausible that the children could be their biological children.  Even if age is a factor, the overriding factor should be that the kids would be staying with their biological famlies.  This should trump a younger couple any day.|`|M3x0quJsaa	It's the daily mail so its probably filled with bullshit  its probably for a different reason|`|OMegfVhoaa	It's disgusting. If they can look after a child well enough, they should be able to keep them. I don't really think that article should be mentioning that they are gay all the time though, there is nothing wrong with that. I was adopted when I was 6, and the woman beat me and made me work for her, until her husband came home from work and she acted nice. I luckily had a good enough social worker to get out after a year, but Social Services are still slipping up with everything, and not noticing the obvious, like Baby P for example.
eya1WDS4aa	Let her cry it out. She has to learn that mommy cant hold her evert second of every day. Just sit her down and let her cry it out.

We have started letting her Cry it out. If we didn't we would have to be holding her all the time. Try not picking her up and maybe playing with her on the floor instead.     If you keep picking her up every time she cries it is just going to get worse.|`|DnyyyGeEaa	I have the same problem with me 8 month old. He hasnt always been like this so I thinks its an anxiety stage where they think that your going to leave them and not come back. Your the mom and only let them cry it out until it breaks your heart. They have alot of life to live and being held right now when they are still so young wont hurt them.

It is true that once you're 35 and older, risks for certain birth defects increase, but I don't think that should stop anyone from having a child after 35.

There's a small chance I am expecting my third right now, but it's very small.    In this day and age, couples should only have as many kids as they can afford. There is no set number. Having so many that you can only afford to give them what you can get by on is unfair. Stopping when you're at a comfortable level where you can afford not only the kids, education, and yourselves is absolutely perfect and completely fair. But since everyone has different mortgages, income levels, etc, a certain number cannot be set.|`|wlgRsZpfaa	um, three? four is alot, and don't try twins!!! big college bills if that happens.

Good Luck & Have fun!!!|`|r7q8LW7Aaa	Semen contains prostagladins which will help to soften the cervix. Also, evening primrose oil contains a natural source of prostaglandins and can help when used both orally and as a pessary (but do this just before you go to bed, it'll disolve before your first wee break!)  That's really the best you can do, other than waiting. I was induced with prostins (the synthetic version of prostaglandins) with both of my babies at 42 weeks and went into labour within hours.  ADD - raspberry leaf tea or capsules will help to tone your uterus, but will not affect your cervix or induce labour. It could make your labour shorter though. I should note that I drank 2-3 cups a day in the last few weeks of my second pregnancy and had a 23 minute labour! Could be the tea, but I wouldn't be taking the chance - if I ever have another, I'll be gulping the stuff down!|`|kdryabU8aa	Raspberry leaf capsule or tea|`|NLoaES0Naa	Evening primrose oil is more commonly used by midwives. Very few obstetricians employ this method for softening the cervix. Most go to the medical methods of stripping the membranes or inducing labor with prostaglandins or pitocin.     The sperm can help to soften and thin the cervix. It can be a bit tricky to actaully do the deed though, as you have probably already found out. I was told the best way to get the sperm close to the cervix is doggy style.    raspberry leaf capsules fro holland and barrett it softens s=cervix ready for labour.

awRNr2VMaa	yes! as long as its not harder than peanut butter (use the diaper to squish it or a baby wipe) than its fine and as long as shes not showing any discomfort pooping shes fine.    EDIT - my son was bottle fed but he had little pellet poop when he was 3 weeks!|`|hi8A43ibaa	My daughter had the probiotic drops and it didn't seem to affect her pooping. I always ask my doctor pooping questions and he said as long as it isn't black or white, the baby is fine. Even a dark brown is ok. My daughter used to fill her diaper like you wouldn't believe (on a daily basis) that I thought there was something wrong with her too. As long as they don't do this every hour, then again, you are fine. The doctor also said anything that is the consistency of oatmeal or peanut butter (or anything in between) is ok. If it is very hard it could mean she is a bit constipated.    Just an FYI the doctors thought she had colic as well until I started to document her symptoms more and then they realized she had acid reflux. Once medicated, this really helped. At 3 months old they should start to grow out of the colic...if they have acid reflux they can grow out of this at any point- even have it until they are a year old+. If she is really fussy when she eats, doesn't sleep well or for long periods of time, etc. I would look into getting an appointment with the doctor on acid reflux.|`|hFoYmSgqaa	colief will work better than gaia drops i tried everything with my little one and my gp prescribed colief which is an enzyme that helps to break the sugars down no more colic and he passes his waste easily. it sounds fairly normal but i am sure that breastfed babies should be going everyday i know formula fed babies go everyday.|`|bql2RJzWaa	This is the newborn section. No need to appologize for talking about poops!  My son never had harder poops until he was eating solids. He was breastfed until 11-12 months & starting eating solids at 3-4 months.  My daughter (1 month), has had a change in her poop because she's been getting 2oz formula every couple days.  But, shouldn't you baby be pooping everyday?|`|476Ysdfaaa	is there a chance you eat a lot of dairy?? if so,follow a diet free of dairy and see if the colic disappears.|`|Fd4lITkvaa	It doesn't sound like anything to worry over. An exclusively breastfed baby shouldn't have formed poop though. The drops may be affecting that. You might try gripe water instead. It's also drops you can find at most drug or health food stores. I tried everything and in the end just had to wait out colic, it should be ending soon. You also might try feeding from one breast only per meal or block feeding. This is the only thing that did make a difference for us.     http://www.kellymom.com/newman/02colic_i...|`|bfc067ab537555ada57edd464a8dfb97aa	At one month that is normal bowel movement,   my baby was colicy for 9 months there was never anything found wrong with her either.  They finally put her on drops, for 10 days, that helped her fall asleep at night so she would be awake in the day time. After that she seemed to be just fine no more colic anyways.
awRNr2VMaa	ive never heard it called extinction... i tried and hes fine he started sleeping through the night at 6 months when i started and at the same time it got him off the pacifier. i think its a great method and it doesnt harm the baby emotionally no matter what anyone else says. my son is a VERY happy baby! i would never reccomend anyone try before 6 months though because before then they cant put themselves to sleep. and they still need the nighttime feedings      EDIT- it does work thank you very much! my parents used it on me i used it on my son my sister on my neice and nephew and just about everyone i know has used it. our kids are just fine.|`|IA1irLy7aa	i did that method but i call it controlled crying my son now knows that im not going to jump up at every cry unless i know he is hungry or needs a change. i leave him to cry for 9minutes (one minute for every month he is) then go in not make eye contact and give him his teddy or blanket and turn his music bear on. it takes a little while but they soon get used to it. but you have to make sure you don't look them in the eyes and do not pick them up do this for about an hour if he still doesn't settle pick him up without taking him from his room give him a cuddle to calm him down then start again and remember have Patience wear earmuffs if you have too lol good luck this has wrked wonders.|`|ac021f49fcd1ea8f56dc6a9389a933e9aa	It's called extinction?  That's horrible!  Just the name extinction would lead me to believe I wouldn't want to do it to my child.    There is a happy medium between letting him cry and being too coddling.  I'd keep researching and see what fits best for you and your baby.|`|476Ysdfaaa	mmm don't have the time to explain much now,but I wouldn't follow it,since I'm a firm believer of attachment parenting-look it up on google.|`|7rkp23uvaa	This does not work for babies under 6 months.  A crying baby is a baby in need, wether it be for food, a change, or hunger.  Allowing them to cry too long when they are young will prevent them from developing a sense of trust that you will care for them.  Once your child is older and you can distinguish desperate cries from whining then the cry it out method is ok.  Personally, I don't like it because crying is stressful for a baby and too much of it can cause them to release stress hormones.  Not only that, but it causes their neurological pathways to develop anxiety as a reaction to stress.  Some crying is good, but the cry it out method is really very strict.|`|hi8A43ibaa	My daughter is 6 months old and we tried that and she literally cried for an hour and a half one night. But each baby is different. It, in my opinion, depends on the baby's temperament more then anything else. Some it works great on and other it will drive them to scream and go hysterical. Our baby did the latter.     I wouldn't recommend it, though, until he is 5-6 months.|`|iH2whFkHaa	I haven't ever tried that, so I can't tell you from experience if it's worth it; but I CAN tell you that rocking my baby to sleep...lying down with him to soothe him ...the time spent trying to figure out what is wrong until I finally find the answer...singing to him, smoothing his forehead with my hand, kissing him to sleep, holding him close to stop his crying...all these things have and always will be WORTH IT!!!!|`|dXVA1wHDaa	I wouldn't do it.  I personally want my son to know that I'm going to be there for him when he needs me.  IMO, a young baby cries because it needs something.  To ignore it is cruel.|`|SGeo7cqYaa	It doesn't work. Don't even waste your time. Seriously. You think the baby will eventually stop crying, but it goes on and on. Trust me, its not worth it. Good luck

If you are unsure it is correct, take another. They design some pregnancy tests (First Response specifically) to be able to tell you if you are pregnant BEFORE you even miss your period.|`|17MZkNpZaa	the best way to know is to go to the doctor and have them take one. theirs are more accurate.|`|JxTpCkizaa	just take another one|`|lZ7zfzLRaa	usually pregnancy tests are pretty accurate, ideally something like 97%. Take a few, and see what you get...|`|sGJ9mohSaa	i don't know, maybe you should take three tests and do a majority count that is what i did for my first child (she was unplanned)|`|Ks8PQxZBaa	There are chances it might give you a false negative.

AA11185897	Most of the time School "accidents" happen because the child is too busy playing that they don't remember that nagging feeling means STOP I HAVE TO PEE.   It may also be an embarrassment for her to use the bathroom while people may watch her head that way and since it is a sudden thing you might just have a quick talk about it to ease her mind just in case that is the issue. If another child followed her in there or accidentally walked in on her, she may not want it to happen again. And if she was embarrassed about it she probably didn't say anything to anyone.|`|44OH7Si6aa	Ask her simply if it hurts when she pees, she's 4 she knows how to say something hurts or feels funny. It's just two days though so don't worry about it sometimes small kids just have off days|`|zlHgIltOaa	Just a possibility: I know this sounds strange, but kids go through brief stages in which they imitate something that another child has done that they normally wouldn't do themselves. She seems to have a normally functioning bladder and normal potty routine (since this has never happened), but she may have just wanted to see what would happen when she pees her pants. My little cousin is perfectly capable of making it to the bathroom on time, but I swear she has accidents for atttention or to see people's reactions.|`|rnTNu6MTaa	Maybe weak bladder or she is just embarrassed to ask to go to the bathroom...or she waits to long until she can't hold it no more.|`|83388aa09b6c75cd53f9c93c06394853aa	My daughter is 5 and had this problem a lot in the beginning of the year. I really never figured out what it was but here is what I did. She was scared of the automatic flush toilets so I told the teacher and they have this "hat" that sits on it so you have to flush it yourself. Also I have a 3 year old that we were potty training and would praise when she went. So when my 5 year old would go with out accidents we would praise her as well. It seemed to help Good luck.|`|8v40KEd0aa	Yes, sounds like a blatter infection or maybe something else is going on in school.
44OH7Si6aa	You need to get him on a set routine. Make a schedule chart for him. For example : 5o'clock dinner, 6 o'clock play time with mommy and daddy, 7 o'clock bath time followed by reading books on the couch and 8 o'clock bed time. Stress the importance of what you are doing and when and stick to it every night. It may take a while but eventually he'll learn bed time comes after reading books and he will start winding down and getting ready for bed. Just make sure you aren't doing any tickle fights or other energy provoking activities within and hour of bed time.|`|Vk4mZi5Yaa	If your stuck, stick to the good old fashioned getting on one knee and begging.|`|wpzkgkyLaa	routine is always best for night time sleep. starting from the min he wakes up to the min he goes down every day needs to be the same. of course the little details change but for the most part everything happens at the same time. Wake at 6- breakfast at 7 snack at 9 lunch at 11 nap at 12 wake at 1 snack at 2 dinner at 6 bath 6:30 read book 6:45 and in bed by 7pm play time and other stuff in between of course.     It takes three days to break a "habbit" I did this with my daughter when she got off schedule and on the third day she was sleeping all night long! Another thing he might be ready to skip nap time they say if a child goes from sleeping all night to not wanting to sleep but the routine doesnt change then its a sign nap time is over in less they have a big day or somthing..    Hope that helps|`|zlHgIltOaa	They really shouldn't let him take such long naps at daycare....    Ok EDIT.....I wasn't really thinking of how long kids spend at daycare sometimes. Well, on a different note, routine is the most important part of any kid's bedtime. But here's a couple ideas for those desperate times when sleep just refuses to come:  -reading  -exercise  -light snack of mainly carbohydrates  -counting exercises (these have been proven to help)  -a little review of abc's and 123's  -soothing bath with sleep-enhancing scents  -massage or cuddle time  -warm milk is supposed to work...|`|6iJ30wugaa	Well I have 2 kids of my own I know what you are talking about tell the people at hes daycare not to let him sleep no longer than 1 hour and try this at home for yourself to and try not let him take A nap no later than 3:00 it help for my kids and they would sleep alot better at night. good luck.|`|Su0O55W8aa	One suggestion with the light situation is to get a ceiling fan with a light that has a remote.  Leave the switch turned on and tape it to where he cannot flip it down, and you can control the light with the remote that YOU keep in your room!  You may have to take all of the toys out of his room too if he tends to get up and play.  He's smart and knows what he's doing!  He obviously isn't getting enough playtime during the day to make him sleepy at the end of the day so try to keep him active when you get home.  Have some quiet time about an hour or 30 minutes before bedtime to start relaxing his mind.  This can be typical in children of his age and you just have to explain and show him that you are serious and when it is bed time that he must go to sleep!  I know it may sound bad but if he has any type of allergies its not as bad, but give him some children's dimetapp about 30 minutes before bedtime!  My parents used to give it to me before we would leave for vacation so I would sleep lol.  Also, don't give him any sugary foods or drinks after 5 or 6pm.

Everything down to being extremely regular with 30 day cycles falling on (or sometimes around depending on the month) the 10th of every month. If I were you, I would find another doctor. Someone who will listen to your concerns and suggestions. I had a doctor and one of the nurses in her office blatantly told me she wouldn't do meds because it was my idea and she is the doctor. So if she would have had the idea first, it wouldn't have been a problem. I love my doctor now. He listens to me and when I said I wanted to give clomid a try (first round 2 years ago) he said lets do some tests and if everything comes back ok, its a go.     So I am not going to say I know what you're going through, but I will say that I understand your frustration. I would ask some people or find a support group and get recommendations on doctors that other people in your situation have been through.

Stand your ground|`|afa52a74ce7b4357a257fad514a51986aa	Well honestly the first thing I thought when I heard the name was that it was from the Bible not from the Children of the Corn. I think most people would think the same way as I did. Well it is your child so you and the dad should decide what its name will be. We had the same kind of issue with ours. We wanted to continue the first name of John for my husbands side (I also have a lot of John's including one grandpa) but everyone in his family kept saying no we have too many johns. (Tyler's grandpa is John Sr., his dad is John Jr. (they didn't have a middle name) and my hubby is John Tyler) and they tried to give us so many names at Christmas and we just nodded and went on our way. We were originally going to name him John Tyler Jr but figured that would be way too confusing so we liked the name John Ryne (pronounced Ryan) and we have told everyone  that John Ryne IS HIS NAME but he will go by Ryne. Once they realized we weren't changing our minds they figured out that they really like his name. I would do what you guys want and if your parents don't like it, kindly point out that they got to name their children what ever they wanted, so it is only right you get to name your children what you want.|`|UVQrNF3daa	honestly the first thing i thought of when i read the name was children of the corn too!!!  but i do like the name!  i think if you like the name then thats all thats matters and no matter what you name the child your parents are going to love them just the same!|`|3aqm1SDbaa	This is your child, choose a name that makes you happy.

Personally I like the name, but am not so crazy about the nickname. Try to think about his stages in life an what he will be called. Example. William. Can be called billy as a baby and kid, then be Bill later in life. The name grows with the person. I dont know how you could make Malachi grow. lol But its your personal preference. And your parents will learn to love your child no matter what you name him. good luck!
ETTEaxVeaa	You have to follow your heart. I too believe life is a precious gift from God-if you snuff out this baby's life you'll never forgive yourself.

He told me he would support me financially but wanted nothing to do with the child. He didn't want kids ever. When my daughter was born, he took one look at her and I saw the terror drain away. He loves that child so much now-we are married and have two kids!!!!!!  I think telling your parents would be a start. Most parents will be supportive and if your boyfriend wont support you they'll be there for you. Talk to HIM tomorrow, tell him you'll never forgive yourself, and subsequently him, if you get rid of your baby. It IS a baby-not just blood. It is an embryo, with all its DNA and characteristics stored and growing.     Hope all works out well for you, and trust me, you can be a fab mum with or without a father. The father made the decision to have unprotected sex, the baby didn't choose to be here.    Cardonaalyssa-how right she is. Often the frightened ones are the best dads. I know my husband is now a brilliant dad who dotes on his kid and she loves him!!|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	If he loves you, then he would not want you to get an abortion. Perhaps he needs time for it to sink in, maybe he will make a great father once the time comes, but you have to be prepared for what might happen should he not change his mind. He can't make you get one, and if you want to keep the baby, that's your choice. If he does break up with you, I'm not sure how child support, etc. would work if he wanted you to terminate - he might still be legally bound to support his child unless he signs away his rights as a parent.     Try and talk to him...and definitely tell your parents, as you will need their support, too. But don't let him talk you into doing this, especially if you want to keep the baby. Single motherhood is hard, but not impossible.     Good luck.|`|1WRB7RPNaa	i have not, But, if i was ever, it would be up to me and me only and that would be a no. The only thing i can say is that my husband did not really want my son in the beginning, he didn't want me to have an abortion or anything but said that he was not ready for children, he now regrets that, couldn't picture life with out him and now we are having our second.so good luck :) hope all gos well|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	You need to accept that you are going to go through it without him.  He obviously does not want a baby.  Tell your parents and hopefully they will support your decision.|`|Xt1LxiWAaa	it's not his choice what you do, its yours. do what you feel is right and do what your heart says.|`|sLERr3aAaa	Just tell him what you want don't have a abortion because it is what he wants he will have to eventually come around .|`|a7b81aec51d8df49e523d067b9b07ea9aa	im proud of you for not wanting an abortion. he will just have to deal with the fact that your pregnant, there is nothing you can do about it. he should be a man and step up. abortion is never the answer if you are truly not ready to be a mother adoption is the best answer. there are millions of family out there that cant have children that would give your child a loving home. there are many support groups out there as well.|`|F73Lyi1kaa	i've never been there, but do stay strong and keep your baby!|`|2ObqoJbKaa	Yea. Thats tough. but if you really want the baby, then don't let anyone talk you out of it. Its your decision. Tell your bf straight up that you want to keep it, and if he can't handle that, then maybe he shouldn't be apart of its life. Hopefully he'll come to understand and support your decision. good luck with everything. Everything will work out, and it won't ruin your life.|`|sGJ9mohSaa	sometimes the guys that are the most scared of having a baby make the best fathers... if he doesn't want  to have the baby and you do maybe adoption would be a good answer for the both of you but you need to make a decision and stick to it.  good luck|`|S5v9I0y2aa	Stay strong, and keep following your heart on this one!    All the best and prayers|`|1whTwTbDaa	Have the baby...somebody has to be responsible. Aborting the baby is not an option...you will regret it for the rest of your life. In fact...did you know that your baby has a heartbeat as this stage in pregnancy? Yeah, it is more than just blood...it is a baby, a human being, a little somebody growing inside your womb. God, knows the embryo in you...why kill God's miracle? Good luck, I hope you do the right thing.|`|lkBjzLuQaa	If you really wont the baby keep it their is allot of support out there for single mums.  Don't let him tell you what to with your body but be ready for him not to be there, and it already seems you are attached to it.  Have you thought about adoption.   also there is a baby inside you and at 4 weeks it has a heart beat im sorry but you have to know.|`|zRc4Swewaa	It's not blood,once you conceived it is considered a baby and has heartbeat.I don't favor abortion because you kill your own child even you haven't seen her/him.Yes you are young and it's natural that you're bf will think that it's over but he must have a responsibility with what the two of you have done,it's already there and you have to do what is best because it's a blessing from God.Haven't you heard on what doctors do when they abort?Better research about abortion and tell him to read it.Good luck.|`|AA11185897	I was hoping you allowed Instant Messages.    I don't know how to change his mind.    Hopefully God will speak to his heart and he will accept that there is NO WAY you will kill your baby. I really hope he is there for you.    Best of Luck and congratulations on your precious gift, you are truly blessed even if you don't realize just how much yet.|`|eFQgVjTjaa	http://www.i-am-pregnant.com/Pregnancy/c...    This is what your baby looks like if you are indeed 4 weeks.  It already has eyes, a liver a heart......    He cannont make you have an abortion.  And I would just tell him your are going to have a life with this baby WITH OR WITH OUT HIM.  he shoulda kept it in his pants.  Hes 19 he knew the risk and if he REALY loved you he would consider your feelings too.  what if either one of your parents had an abortion neither of you would be here....Good luck|`|L0873cdDaa	He obviously doesn't love you or he wouldn't be trying to make you do something you don't believe in. Dump him and keep your baby. And tell your parents.|`|17MZkNpZaa	that's exactly what it is a GIFT. and if you heart is feeling heavy about the decision your bf wants you to make then make the decision that's right for you.    it sounds like you are confused but you want to make the right decision.    i may feel like you are all alone in the beginning but i guarantee if you choose to bring this life into the world it will be the greatest thing you;ve ever done.
0Ei3ePJzaa	I am not sure that you could class it as child cruelty, but it is brief pain for no good reason, unlike injections for health reasons.  However, I do think it is awful.  I hate to see a baby with their ears pierced - I want to go up to the mother and say "Did she ask you for those? Force you to get yourself to the nearest shop and get them done?" "NO? When are you getting her a tattoo done?"    Idiots.|`|Wjdpm4xNaa	no.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	They shouldn't be prosecuted, but there definately should be a minimum age.  I hate seeing babies with pierced ears.  I think its awful that a parent would do that to their children.  Why not just wait until the child is old enough to decide on their own whether they want their ears pierced?|`|C4ibOR7Laa	no they shouldn't, its not cruelty at all, i personally wouldn't allow it until the age of 10 or so, but everyone is different, its not illegal is it?|`|dnG7fhnbaa	Ear piercing on babies should be illegal, but parents who already have it done shouldn't be prosecuted! It really upsets me when I see tiny babies with their ears pierced.|`|01Mu3wUeaa	Although I don't agree with getting a young child's ears pierced (due to it being risky while they play) it is not child cruelty.    Have you even had your ears pierced before? I have low pain tolerance and even I barely felt my ears being pierced.Its no big deal.|`|MPc0kS1vaa	no!!|`|r7q8LW7Aaa	I wouldn't go that far, but I certainly agree that it's tacky and unnecessary.|`|8AQI1welaa	Definatly|`|rTAvnldfaa	i personally dont like babies with their ears peirced, it should be their own decision when theyre older,|`|37PpYx8oaa	No.  It's a good thing you're not the boss of all other parents.  You should worry about your kids, let other parents worry about theirs!|`|LBHQkBnkaa	If Chav's didn't pierce their baby's ears, how would we know that they are chav's. I don't have time to sit around all day watching daytime TV to see what the Wayne and Waynetta's of the world are calling their children.    Seriously, it's cruel and unecessary.|`|dprURFLxaa	No...if that were the case then what would you do to people that circumcise their boys?|`|HUrYSp4oaa	its personal choice as with anything, in some countries its the norm to get babies ears pierced early i was living in one such country and my girls had theirs done at an early age.  i dont like seeing babies with big gold hoop earrings tho.|`|I4uIOp1maa	no  but they need a gd slap  sorry if i offend|`|ZrIl3PwLaa	yes, i think it is mean to hurt your baby that way. Plus who are we as parents to go ahead and put holes in our daughters ears shouldn't that be her decision when she is older???    good luck!!|`|60AjkhZ2aa	I don't think they should get prosecuted..    But I don't think it's right.    After all, the baby might not want piercings when it's older. Either way, it should be given the choice.|`|AA10711210	Yes, of course. It's a clear case of physical abuse and should be prosecuted.|`|0jviPilhaa	Yes. It's so so wrong and looks bloody awful without exception. It should be illegal until the teens.|`|eya1WDS4aa	NO! you must be one of those people that call abuse if you see a parent spank a child. No its not abuse. I wouldn't do it to my child, but its not abuse. Saying it is, is like saying getting a boy circumcised is abuse.|`|f444233a6f8e231f92f0eba538faa033aa	It's a quick pinch and then it's over. It's not a big deal and it doesn't even bleed. I had mine pierced before I was a year old, and I have no problems with it. And you can't do it before 2 months old, anyway, so it's not like you're really fresh out of the womb getting your ears pierced.     To be honest, the kids that come in that are 7 or 8 years old take it a thousand times worse than the little tiny babies that get their ears pierced.|`|Q6uA8t9baa	there is a law that says you have to be over 6 to have your ears pierced but there are many places still do it. I think it is wrong if the child is very young, as they do not have a choice and i can imagine it being quite painfull to them. Children at a more mature age i dont feel it is so cruel, if they have asked for it and are willing.  I think there should be a more solid law come into place.|`|dBYsvXhdaa	Yes, due to the baby's small size, it is probably like an adult getting a pen or pencil pushed through the ear.    There is a lot of unfit parents out there.|`|YJNql5Mgaa	No. Just because YOU think it's wrong doesn't mean it is.    Personally, I feel that is a parent's personal decision.  We're waiting until our daughter is 8 years old to decide for herself.  But if someone else wants to pierce their daughter's ears as a baby, that's up to them.|`|DUgo8Edjaa	YES!!! i hate it when parents do that, especially gold little tacky earrings!!!    you know what else i hate just as much?? when twins are dressed identically from birth (not similar, but identical) i think it robs them of their identity and individuality!!!    sorry just a little rant there.|`|R0Qek0Faaa	Babies have to be 6 months old to have their ears pierced, so if it was wrong then they wouldn't do it. I had my children's ears pierced when they were both 6 months old, so are you telling me that I should be prosecuted. I went to a proper jewellers and paid more money to have it done properly and never had any trouble. So are you saying that kids of 11/12 years old are allowed to have piercings on their face and body is ok. I won't allow my kids to have any other piercings until they are at least 15/16|`|758cDKEFaa	i really think its wrong to.  i girl i know just got her babys ears pierced and he was only like 6 months!  i wouldnt go as far as that, but i do think they should have an age limit on it.|`|PQw92IGHaa	I don't like it personally, but I dont' feel it is punishable by law. Also, if you're going to start prosecuting for child cruelty what would they do about circumcision?|`|RDkZpL2Eaa	its a bit silly, i wouldnt but if they wanted it done then cool.|`|U7Fvw8g7aa	I didn't have my baby girl's ear pierced because I want it to be her decision when she grows up. It didn't bother me at all that people thought  she looked like a boy when she was very little. Now she has nice long hair and no longer mistaken for a boy. Why put a baby through unnecessary pain and suffering right. If anything I think that there should be a law banning this so that even if it's the parent's choice nobody will do since it is against the law. A law that will fall under minor's rights sounds reasonable. It maybe shallow to adults but not to an innocent baby or a young child who is forced to undergo such procedure and extreme pain just because "the parents think it's okay".
PbBWJGsTaa	I know exactly what you mean.  My husband says i'm being too sensitive.      Heres one story.  I was at my mother-in-laws when my little girl was about 2 months old.  My MIL was walking her round the room and bouncing her about trying to stop her crying while i repeatedly said "she needs to nurse, she's hungry" and asked to have her back. About 10 minutes and alot of crying later, she said to me "She's hungry you know, she needs a feed", and handed her back to me.     Oh how my blood boiled.  Little things like that wind me up.|`|tjNJAn75aa	I dont think there's enough hours in the day for me to list them all lol. Most annoying- every time my son gets sick, my uncle tells me to do really obvious things like Im some kind of moron like " you need to book an appointment at the doctors" er duh!!!! Or my mum goes on about how I need to feed him coz he's too thin. I get him measured and weighed by the HV regularly and know he's right in the middle or the "normal" range and I he eats like a pig!! Im naturally slim too so think he's just inherited it. Or when my FIL says he behaves better when Im not there-er thats coz you never tell him no,, hence no need for tantrums and he's acting up coz he knows your here and will try to get me to give in. GGGRRRrrrgghh. When my baby was first born my MIL used to go on about winding him as well. SOd them all-you know your doing a good job and you know what's best for your baby. You'll get used to it and with time time you'll come up with some fun comebacks. lol. xxx|`|cab8f3eed982d7c810bf2e8fc14f2cecaa	I've had many of these types of things happen at my MIL. Few times  I would get " you've been here for 2 hrs..You should feed him" when he wasn't even hungry. He was just fussy with something else. Many times bouncing my son up and down right after hes ate. So obviously hes going to spit up. They'll say he spit up..Get him some baby food he's still hungry. Or comments like I should be giving him more baths. When he was a newborn and skin was still peeling and telling me I needed to give him a bath everyday. There's alot more but we don't have that kinda time.lol.|`|Ug5twRBDaa	Yes, i went to my cousin's house with my baby boy (who was 7 weeks at the time), and her friend was there with her 6 week old girl. The friend's hubby made a joke about my son's head size, on how big it is. (It is in the 80th percentile lol) Their daughter had the smallest head on a baby I've ever seen for that age, but I didn't say a word.      I just laughed it off. Sure, it was annoying, but just ignore it and think of how sweet your baby is, it'll make you feel better.|`|WlU3NFu6aa	Oh totally. I remember when my daughter was about a month or two old and i was saying something about he ear was dirty. and my MIL said "Don't you clean her ears?" like in a tone that implied "shouldnt you know this?" I was like yes i do clean her ears thanks for asking.   I dont remember all of the things she said but I doknow there were a few things that irked me and made me feel as though she thought I didn't know what I was doing.|`|7rCeCVl2aa	Definitely. A lot of the times it's when I ask a question on Y!A and get rude responses from all the mega mommies.|`|4lHJEq5Haa	every time someone tells me how much "smarter" and "advanced" breastfed babies are.     I formula fed my daughter (not by choice) and it annoys me, like they are saying "haha, my kid is better than yours."    no, actually... they aren't. all babies are bright and beautiful.|`|iMULlxdgaa	Its ok they probably eman well but when your a new mom these types of comments are what can piss you off,  I know and I see your point,  try not to let it get to you.  Its a mix of your hormones perceiving them as being assholes when they just really care alot don't worry just calmly respond by saying things like "I think the lint you see is coming from her mittens."  Thats it and then let it go.  You are politely reponding to them and that should be sufficient.|`|NAzAmFDnaa	My in-laws like to comment on how my baby is spoiled because he is exclusively breastfed and doesn't like to drink my milk out of bottles.  They act like I'm doing some bad by breastfeeding him.  So what if he doesn't like rubber nipples....he knows what feels nicer in his mouth.  They act like I'm a bad mom for not forcing him onto bottles or formula so that they can babysit him when they want to.|`|8Qbx8PDnaa	LOL YAH MY STUPID MOTHER IN LAW ALWAYS HAS SOMETHING TO SAY , LIKE WHAT TO FEED MY SON  ANNOYES ME BECAUSE I KNOW WHAT TO GIVE MY SON AND THAT WHY HE CRIES ALOT WHEN WE VISIT HER LOL MAYBE BECAUSE I DONT LIKE TAKING HIM TO HER HOUSE ANYWAY SHES ALWWAYS ****** BUSSY DOESNT EVEN HOLD HIM WHY BOTHER RIGHT               PISSSSESSSS ME OFFF WHEN PPL SAY YOUR LIL GIRL IS CUTE I MEAN SERIOUSLY WTF DO YOU SEE HIM WEARING PINK OR LIL BOWS ON HIS HAIR NOOOOOO      JUST BECAUSE HE HAS A VERY CUTE FACE DOESNT MEAN HES A LIL GIRL  DONT DRESS HIM LIKE ONE DO I WHEN DO YOU SEE A LIL GIRL WEARING BLUE WITH SHORT HAIR|`|YJNql5Mgaa	Maybe not inferior, but pissed. Yes.  I'm the mother- not them and they need to keep their comments to themselves.|`|yNXIxcsYaa	No, and if they have I've tuned it out, lol!  I have too much to worry about without worrying what other people say.|`|qGQCLFinaa	oh yes many times, usually I just brush them off & do it my way anyway, they usually get the point, I know i take good care of my son, just because it's not the way someone else does it doesn't make their way any better!!  It use to bother me a lot, but now i just shake it off & keep on going!! you're doing fine don't let anyone else tell you different!!|`|6lyvhRLsaa	I know what you mean, people think they have a right to tell you you're doing something wrong! My grandmother is trying to get my son to eat solids and every time I say something like, he woke up once last night, she says well if he was on solids he'd sleep better! He's only 4 months old!!!    and the hiccup thing, my father in law used to say that to me too, are you burping him? No, I leave him, what do you think? lol
urrmckQBaa	sounds exciting!! I love pregnancy tests, i was addicted to them! Try taking another first thing with FMU. I doubt an evap line could show within 5 mins. Was is a cb digital? They have something like 50miu unlike the internet tests which are 15-25miu maybe less. Can you post a pic?     Good luck x
AA12085492	We have got the line after 5 min and ma wife was tested positive, check out the link, it has the pictures of the test we took http://ekkhwab.wordpress.com/2008/12/02/...    All the Best|`|tjgWwfxLaa	well if you have taken another test since then i am not for sure maybe try in a couple of days but i have gotten a real light positive line once and a couple of days later got a true positive|`|RLbN2Ujhaa	9dpo is kind of early to get a pos result. But if you got a bunch of tests, try again tomorrow. Typically evap lines show up really late, like after you dig it back out of the trash hours later. Early on in pg, it's best to use first morning urine since it's so concentrated. Test again in the am. I like First Response early. I liked the cheapies, too.|`|1z3C0R2Vaa	no.
d6df9c3bab13d4a609d4641b785de6b0aa	It happens when the fertilized egg implants itself in the fallopian tubes instead of the uterus. Women more at risk are women that have had an ectopic before, damaged or unusually shaped fallopian tubes, Pelvic infection or inflammatory disease, endometriosis, taking fertility drugs or the use of IUD for contraception. Sometimes there is no obvious reason, it just happens. Smoking is also associated with up to a five times greater risk of ectopic pregnancy. This may be due to the nicotine in cigarettes. Nicotine stimulates contractions in the fallopian tubes. This can cause "spasm," resulting in temporary blockage of the tube so the embryo cannot pass through.|`|joPJtKemaa	Has nothing to do with being inherited. It just does not implant in the uterus but the tube.    It happens.|`|eFQgVjTjaa	Its random for the most part, its when the egg fertilizes and implants while it is still in the the tube. AKA tubal pregnancy.  Some women who have had it before are at a higher risk of getting it again but that is only because there is usually a reason behind it like a blocked tube...etc...My cousin has 6 kids and only had one ectopic pregnancy.  shes fertile myrtle.  Hope this helped.|`|sLERr3aAaa	It is when the fertilized egg attaches somewhere other then the uterus it just happens.|`|tbeO3Lataa	Good question. No, in general, it is not inherited. I say in general, because women who had mothers that had trouble in trying to conceive and pregnancy automatically have a higher chance of having trouble themselves. (Wow, that sentence was long, I'm sorry!).     It is random, increased with certain types of fertility problems. Also, like someone above me said, a mother who has had an ectopic pregnancy before has a higher chance of having on again.

I had a healthy daughter!!|`|01vMpHkWaa	same reason ultrasounds are not recommended to do often    it sends some type of ray into the placenta and should not be used so often    be careful|`|dn2UCOkqaa	A fetal doppler isn't harmful and it certainly doesnt send harmful rays it send sound WAVES.      Whether you buy or rent, one of the main things you should look for in your fetal monitor is FDA approval. When you purchase or rent a monitor with FDA approval, you can be assured that your fetal heart monitor is safe to use throughout your pregnancy.|`|AA11456239	so you say in your query that (a) it CAME yesterday, (b) you've used it a few times, and (c) you cant seem to get it into the right place? well sweetheart, that sounds like a personal problem! haha!
AA11763588	You won't even know you are pooping... it will just happen.|`|9hrJfhIIaa	Many women find that their body goes through a natural cleansing of the bowels (aka explosive diarrhea prior to labor). Also, many Docs can prescribe enemas to empty the bowel - this ensures effective pushing.|`|ibWLdXlJaa	You won't even notice. It just happens while you are pushing so it's a good thing. Like I said before I don't even know if I did and I have no intentions of asking!|`|1f440895db82d46ea39724bf6ad660e1aa	It happened to me. I'm not sure what you mean by "does it come out like pee" because it comes out like poop. I had to ask the nurse if I pooped and she said "yes, just a little bit." It wasn't the best thing to have happen but at the time I kind of didn't care because I was focused on pushing to get the baby out.|`|2ObqoJbKaa	Yes. Alot of women end up doing that during the labor. Its just not something people talk about alot.|`|GdSzrtmAaa	I am not sure but I know my aunt pooped while pushing. good Luck!|`|mY19PPlIaa	Yeah, I hope that's never me!!|`|41750b9e94be3f10bf789863a1a3a228aa	Yep, comes out the same way and believe it or not during the pushing process it is VERY normal to poo on the table.  Gross, huh?!  But, you really could care less at that time.

I had sharp labor like pains when i miscarried at 14 weeks.|`|AA11333930	Extreme cramps  and bleeding    If you have a miscarriage  when you use the bathroom you will see bumps of blood coming out|`|9iOHAC41aa	bleeding, cramping, severe abdominal pain.|`|0ciwkHQ3aa	cramping with heavy bleeding|`|3aqm1SDbaa	I had a miscarriage last April and I really didn't have any symptoms other than when I bled it came out tissue and a little darker than usual.|`|SIrmqu5maa	heavy bleeding and cramping|`|ycy0y5Qqaa	i read that you can miscarry and it seem like a normal period.  i'm kindof in the same boat so i'm probably not much help as i don't know whether i'm having one or still prego|`|5f52c5c3d1d0deab80192fb888e39e9aaa	Bleeding and cramping are the obvious ones, but then bleeding can happen in a healthy pregnancy as well. Also, you can have what's called a "missed miscarriage" where the baby dies and your body doesn't realize it.  There are usually no signs of it until the ultrasound.  That's what happened with me. I went in for an ultrasound, saw a heartbeat at six weeks, and then saw a dead baby on my 10 week ultrasound. Just don't think too hard about these things. It's not anything you can really control.
usltkMnwaa	I have dark brown eyes and my ex-wife's are blue. Our baby has brown eyes just like mine. Actually, she has the majority of my traits (curly hair, brown eyes, full lips, wider nose). My wife is mixed with white and mexican and I am mixed with black and white. Our baby is soooo beautiful!!!|`|FQ4nhSiRaa	either brown, green or hazel.   brown is dominant  if you both have a recessive green trait, green could occur  hazel is a cross between brown &green|`|90NzgbSsaa	well there is no way of knowing really. brown eyes are dominant. so there is a higher possibility of having brown.|`|xZWP2mqjaa	Our son's eyes are a beautiful brown shade, not dark /not light. His hair is an auburn shade and people always comment on how his eyes and hair match perfectly.  I have green eyes and hubby has hazely-brown.|`|iMULlxdgaa	yeah brown is the dominant color for the most part...but they could combine and come out hazel...and in some special cases the baby comes out with a toitally diff color. I would say that the baby at first will have gray eyes anyway  then they will change to their true color in about 6 months time.|`|76b2313ad607b0e7b0eb85999b17c136aa	most likely brown, about 90% chance|`|bql2RJzWaa	?

My son's father has brown & his are greyish.|`|TVC3mAP7aa	Eye color is based on a number of genes, including those of your and your wife's parents.  This tool will help you learn the probability of each:     http://museum.thetech.org/ugenetics/eyeC...|`|L2Nde54Haa	chances are...........lol, most probably brown! my daughter has a green-eyed mom and a dark brown-eyed papa, and she has eyes like chocolate velvet!! yummmy, just like papa...
Tf0WM1WMaa	i think what you said was okay. Dont talk about her anymore though, let him know that there are more important things for him to worry about, and that your there for him. Don't let him know how bad his gf is, but how good he can also be without her. Remember to tell him that theres ALWAYS someone better. And that if things were meant to be somewhere along the rode they will get back together. those are the things that helped me |`|kX1PolCUaa	aww he sounds so sweet!  yeh you sound like you were really nice, theres not much you could say tbh  good luck with it =]  x|`|cJ1hizgHaa	You were kind of rough around the edges, but you said the right thing.|`|7Igsjoz7aa	And... no..|`|2U6XXwbVaa	nope... you might of just made him remember her when he was trying to for get about her
Bqtx3CTYaa	you sound very sweet and yes you did fine just make friends with thos boy he sounds really nice. Don't worry about been shy you did fine x  good luck  x|`|Tf0WM1WMaa	yeah u did. because im sure hes using you as a rebound. so dont fall for it. Right now he needs comfort. keep reminding him that ur there for him, but as a friend. That you havent grown to like him in that way.|`|HFA05vDuaa	i think you said "just friends" in a nice way. you make it clear that you wern't interested in a relationship with him but it sounded nice at the same time|`|6gthdHpnaa	You told him the truth in a nice way, and that is always the right thing to say.|`|d5onKaO6aa	tell him that you just want to be friends. or have kids lol|`|cJ1hizgHaa	Just have a one night stand with him|`|89eacaf706726be6ca9f259d599c0f27aa	go at your own pace     don't feel pressured to get a bf just because the door opens|`|MIUzgwsTaa	I hope your not dating over the internetThats kind of lame  so yea u did do the right thing
tfTQ6Cuuaa	She drank KNOWING she was pregnant? I would think as an experienced mother she would know better. Have her go to the doctor just incase its a complication that needs to be monitored and go dump out her booze.|`|TkPJYlaMaa	She's pregant and killing your new sibling by drinking. Tell her to stop and contact a doctor. This is even worse for the baby.|`|3X0t8JrXaa	Have her see a doctor.  I don't understand why she's drinking while she's pregnant.  Sounds like she has an ongoing hangover.|`|KL9RvYQ8aa	It is quite normal to have lower back ache during early pregnancy.  I would get her to see  doctor. It could be that she has a urine infection, that would make you feel awful and give you lower back ache!    The other possibility is a bug.  If she has been vomiting and diarrhoea  this will make you body ache.    Best to get checked soon.|`|mCDopsLEaa	Those are typical pregnancy symptoms. Alcohol consumption during pregnancy can have various side effects. I would suggest that she not drink and go for a check up.|`|nHqhd8TUaa	yea.....your moms baby is acting up cuz all that alcohol is messing up the babys body cuz everything she eats/drinks the bay eats/drinks and that could make the baby retarted or it will make her have a misscarrage
bzkSIJYnaa	Emmeline Katherine is my favorite.

6a0cd0391065cc81ea4518dae3754040aa	Pressing on your stomach alone cannot cause a miscarriage. Doctors will press on your stomach a lot while you're pregnant, with their hands to assess growth and position, and with a wand to hear the baby's heartbeat.    You could be pregnant, but you could also have an infection. You won't know until you test. If you don't test positive, tell your mother right away, so she can get you to a doctor.    An ectopic pregnancy would be a very bad thing. That means the fetus is outside the uterus, usually in the fallopian tubes. There is no physically possible way to carry the pregnancy to term in that case, and an abortion will be necessary to avoid damaging your reproductive system. An ectopic pregnancy can also kill you if allowed to continue.|`|IlSALGKMaa	If you are 15, and are having a pregnancy scare, you need to stop having sex or at LEAST by all means start using protection. If you find out you are pregnant, and do have an ectopic pregnancy, you will have to tell your parents. You'll have to go to the emergency room to get the ectopic taken care of. You definitely shouldn't wait, you should get a pregnancy test ASAP. If you won't talk to your mom, get a friend to take you to get one.    You are obviously not ready to start having sex, you should at least tell your mother you're having sex. I told my mom when I wanted to start having sex and she was very supportive and bought me a 35 pack of condoms. lol (I was in a serious relationship at the time, too.)     Be more careful, you CAN get STDs.|`|jk6ayFUmaa	talk to your mom! and at 15 stop having sex! to young if your worried about getting pregnant|`|2ObqoJbKaa	Hon, if you don't know if your pregnant yet, don't worry about an ectopic pregnancy. You may very well be pregnant if you have been having unprotected sex. Wait to see if you get your next period and take a home pregnancy test to find out for sure. you can get cheap ones at the dollar store. Also, you can always go to the family planning clinics, it is free and they won't tell your parents. Don't worry about the ectopic pregnancy until you at least find out if you are pregnant, and even then your young and healthy I wouldn't worry too much about that. Go to the doctor and find out if you are pregnant and then tell them your concerns. good luck.|`|sLERr3aAaa	If you had a ectopic pregnancy you have extreme cramping that don't go way along with spotting almost like a period that don't just go way usually if you suspect that you are pregnant take a test ASAP and talk to a doctor only they can tell you if you may have a ectopic pregnancy. If it is ectopic it is a very serious situation you're fallopian tube can rupture and cause internal bleeding.|`|Z9uXyb17aa	i have had 3 ectopics, and trust me you will know, the pain is awful. I only spotted brown with my third ectopic so yes you could be prego, or having a miscarriage, i have had one miscarriage since my last ectopic and I knew because of the cramps and brown spottintg. I would def. not wait around, i would go get a test today, and an ectopic prego, does not always show up on a prg. test, but you should get tested, or go to the er. maybe you should tell your mom, granted she will be upset but people can die from a ruputured ectopic. play it safe!!|`|S5v9I0y2aa	You should go back to the doctor.  The doctor can't cause a miscarriage by pressing on your abdomen.    It could still be normal to be spotting and cramping in early pregnancy (I had the worst cramps, but no spotting).  But like me, they will want to get you looked at for an ectopic pregnancy.  (Ectopic means that the baby implants in your fallopian tube instead of your uterus, so you can have pain and spoting with it).  I had to get an ultrasound, and it said that I had a normal pregnancy.     If you have an ectopic, you can end up with a ruptured tube (where it breaks because of the pressure inside), and that can be very dangerous, and make it hard to have a baby in the future.  They have to end a pregnancy if it is an ectopic, the baby will never survive in the tube.  You have to go to a doctor and check it out for your own health and future.    Please stop having sex and talk to your mom.  She loves you and will help you find out what's going on.    At 15, you don't have the tools to deal with the consequences of sex!  You need to give yourself time (like another 5 years atleast!) to grow up and have a childhood ,not a child!  Good luck and all the best.|`|Fx77zYhWaa	A doctor isn't going to cause you to miscarry by pushing around your stomach.   If you're having severe cramps you don't sit and wait.  Go to the mother.  You don't have to tell her the exact reason and you can talk to the doctor privately.
cEgI5ogLaa	I introduced the sippy around 6 months with solids. We had to try several different ones until we finally found one she liked. Over time she would drink anything, but in the beginning finding one she would comprimise with was tough (I think we went through like 8 different ones until finding one she liked!) lol. With the bottle, I wasz persistant about my daughter holding her own bottle and started working with her on it very young. She figured it out and started doing it on her own around 4 1/2 months... Yours should have no problem maybe she is just being stubborn! I've noticed that with my daughter and talking, she just refuses to do it even though she understands everything and will shake her head yes and no... kids.. lol.  Anyway try not to compare yours with anyone elses, because every baby is different, but she shouldn't have a problem holding her bottle just start working with her on it more. If she can sit up and is probly starting to crawl she shouldn't have a problem holding a bottle! She just likes mom doing it ;)  The handles on the sippy was the one my daughter really liked, it was made by NUK.  Good luck,  Toni Lynne =)|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	I don't know what a bubba is, but i introduced a sippy cup when my daughter started solids.  So a little before 6 months old.  I had one that had 2 handles and had the soft tip.  My daughter was holding her own bottle at 8 months.|`|DNygQdmVaa	my son started holding his own bottle at ten months. and he started the sippy cup at 8 months.  gerber is the best.    and even if shes not holding her bottle yet she can still use a sippy cup.|`|LABC73E7aa	playtex has the bottles with the handles which is a good way to help her learn to hold her bottle. it says for ages 0-3 months but they r fine to use. its a good first step. i saw them at the cvs pharmacy.|`|h5Bf33ieaa	try this one but the one with handles my daugther loves it!!    http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp...
xK0wN8Pvaa	Well when I think of the name Annie I think of a girl that either has blonde hair blue eyes and lives in California, A red head that has a lot of freckles, or a brown hair, outgoing personality girl.  Well those are just my opinion:)|`|x24ERLPSaa	It is a lovely name. Much better than those stupid fads: Courtney, Paige, Chelsy or whatever spelt God knows how!|`|EnyhoOmTaa	TOOOOOOOOOOOOMORROW! TOMORROW! I love ya!   haha    I can't help but think of Annie the musical, but I'm sure by the time your daughter grows up that reference won't exist. But, I think naming your daughter something that Annie can be made a nickname of is a good idea. If you call her Annie while she grows up, it can still be her "name," but when she grows up she may want a more professional name depending on her occupation.|`|F44b2np9aa	Lovely - I imagine a very cute little girl with curly blond hair and a lovely smile.

73da564e0c21875b2260a7446ca0bce6aa	Bao Tran is not protected Pearl : Bao means protected and Tran means Valuable and Precious. BTW, Tran is really her name but Bao is just her middle name. In Vietnam, we just call people by the last word in their name.    There are some names that I think are close to the name "Bao Tran" in meanings and pronunciation.    Berit: Bright, Glorious    Bertha, Bertina, Berta: Bright and Shinning    Beryl: (you know what it is)    Birget, Brina, Bronya: related to Protect      Or Beatrice.

iq5uwobOaa	I am going to say that your child will most likely have brown or light reddish brown hair.    I have green eyes,  so I am going for your child having green eyes, since the father has green eyes.    My father had green eyes.    But anyway you look at it, your baby will be beautiful.|`|WaU0hmD5aa	i think your little girl will be a combination of you and the father she will have his green eyes with your color hair and look like the both of you and that will be a beautiful little girl and may God bless you|`|tfTQ6Cuuaa	Blond hair and brown eyes is my vote! Ala Carrie Underwood type.|`|QRHufyHiaa	i would say blonde hair and brown eyes. my sister and her boyfriend are like you and your boyfriend/husband and their little boy has blonde hair and brown eyes. Very cute :) Good luck!|`|2OjLT0VTaa	This makes me think back to high school science when we did the punnet (sp?) square.  I'm going to vote that the recessive red will show up in your little girl and you'll have a beautiful girl with auburn hair and green eyes... of course, she will be beautiful no matter what!      You should get a 3D sonogram.  You won't be able to tell hair color, but they are awesome!  My dr. suggested the best time was around 25-27 weeks before they start to fill out.      Good luck!|`|AsICkz9naa	I reckon that your little girl will have sky blue eyes and strawberry blonde hair. When you are a baby your hair is a lot lighter than when you are older. Hope this helps. Your baby will be cute no matter what colour her eyes or hair.|`|4D1VEKW5aa	Green eyes are rare. I would say probably brown eyes and brown hair.

There is no denying my eyes are green. Hmmm.....if I didn't look so much like my dad I would be worried! Anyway, this chart is fun!    Oh, I like this one too: http://museum.thetech.org/ugenetics/eyeC...|`|9hrJfhIIaa	She'll have brown eyes - dominant trait. Hair color could be brown or red -- I have red hair and neither of my parents do - recessive trait.|`|WwXQCRcgaa	I think she will have brown hair with a slight red tint and hazel eyes.      It's always fun to think about this.  =)|`|jgtfWjE4aa	i'm going to find the eye color widget and i'm going to try it out for you...brb!    it said you have a %50 chance of brown eyes and %37.5 chance of a green eyed baby.    as for the hair...i couldn't tell ya, i have friends that both have blonde hair and their baby has strawberry blonde hair, somewhere down the line someones grandmother has bright red hair...hair color can go either way!|`|ibWLdXlJaa	Red hair is a pretty strong gene but you will know once she comes out as far as that goes. Her hair will probably be light then darken since both of yours were that way. Eye color....Probably green. It might take awhile though. My nephew is almost 7 and his are just now turning green. Congratulations!|`|joPJtKemaa	Dark hair and dark eyes are the most dominant features.    But your baby can take after your great grandparents. Its all about genes.|`|no9N3zjMaa	I found a really fun site makemebabies.com all you do it upload your pic and the dads and it gives you a pic of what you baby could look like!! Have fun and good luck to you|`|GgrNdDxVaa	i think really light brown hair and maybe hazel eyes, or light brown ones.|`|GZn5VNlSaa	I think it could be a lovely mixture of light brown reddish hair - predominately brown though. Normally dark complexions tend to dominate in the gene pool.  So i'm inclined to guess she will have brown eyes like yours.    Congrats!!
g5Dh6MSYaa	Im not going to lie, but your life is pretty wierd. But hey you know what it is okay. You are unique, unlike those pampered rich people. My parents made choices very bad as well. If anything, talk to your brother about your problems in a casual way, give it time though.|`|k6XRVeJxaa	Let me get this straight. You get $130 for pads and / or tampons a month? All you need is like $25 bucks max.!    What is your question?    EDIT:    Lucky! I wish I got money every month for "girls stuff". Doesn't sound weird to me. Sounds like a modern day "different" family. No big deal. I live with my grandma, grandpa, uncle [16 year old, not like hes 30 or anything], cousin, sister and sometimes my mom.|`|muRI850haa	It sounds like he is handling it well.

I don't know what your question is though.|`|1qXLDOiPaa	hhhhmmm.... well i am also 13 and for me its aquard talking to my mom about my "monthly bill"   but if you want him to be more open about it then just talk to him.... be straight up with it like " OK i'm a girl obviously.. so your gonna have to try and deal with it.." ok maybe not so mean but ... u no.   if that doesnt work i mean you cant blame him hes a dude and i dont know one guy that doesnt get grossed out by our "naterly ways" lol   but if you have to go to the store to get some P. or watever then just make up an excuse to go ... and when you do buy alot so you wont have to ask so many times!! :D hope i was some help!!|`|4GtrHkzsaa	There's not really anything that needs to be different than it already is.  Make sure that whatever you use, be it tampons or pads, make sure that you wrap it up in toilet paper, and throw it away.  And make sure that the garbage gets taken out often, because it can start to smell.  Just make sure that you keep yourself clean, when taking a shower, make sure you wash between your legs, and under your arms really good, because body odor can get really bad at that time of the month.  Even though you're homeschooled, there's got to be a group that you guys are a part of, a homeschooling group that meets once a month or so, just so you guys are interacting with other people, is there someone there that you can ask questions to, or talk to?  I'm really sorry that things are the way they are, but, you seem pretty resilient considering the circumstances.  Keep your head up.

ASk some friends who have "it" already.  All you need are some pads or tampons and ur all good.  AND DONT HAVE SEX TILL YOUR LIKE 18 OR OLDER !!!!  Ok your welcome|`|xLJufjGGaa	For the first question: My best friend lives with her Dad and 2 younger brothers, and she's doing fine (despite no female role model), so don't worry about living in "abnormal circumstances"    As for  2: Depends on what you need from him. Do you have questions you need to ask him, or do just want someone to talk to about it?    Sounds like he is more embarrassed than you are, so if you need to ask him anything, I think he'd appreciate you bringing it up. Sounds like he'd be happy to help you out, but just isn't sure how. Talk to him, and it could get easier to ask questions in the future    Good luck!|`|41618380a5e7f153becf6c38b218110caa	You give a whole new meanin to my house got rolled|`|nUdbTUtHaa	that's a lot of money for girl stuff lol    Um, does your brother not have a gf or ever had a close one? I mean...he should understand how to deal with you at 30 >.    but, what's your question, you seem to be lvl headed and know what you're doing.    It is an odd lifestyle and if you can I would suggest public school as soon as that opportunity becomes available to you.  You need to meet some ppl your age, I know home schooled kids and they only have online friends >.|`|WW66AkgJaa	lol awe your poor brother. just tell him that as long as you get that money than he can just forget about it because you can handle it. if you do have any question i suggest looking online and reading about it or post more questions on yahoo answers since it makes your brother uncomfortable.|`|5172f7acc2e1d638cd1863aaf0963b91aa	Do some online research about the menstrual cycle if you have questions.  Just buy your stuff and make sure you keep some extra protection in the RV so that you wont be unpleasantly surprised by getting your period and not having any pads or tampons.|`|XmEjhMvRaa	i know how uncomfortable it is telling a male about what goes on and that's perfectly normal..!! unforuntaley, there's not much i can say to this except..that your brother is going to have to face the fact it's going to happen every month and there's nothing to do about it, so there's no way how your brother can deal with this|`|e7aeb2cff39c63298f29417537101f03aa	He is 30 he needs to grow up its only a period. most guys have had g/f's an been around girls while on their period or had to go buy them some tampons or something. Tell him to grow up an if you have no way to the store he needs to take u every month or he needs to go get them. Rlly i cant understand why a 30 yr old would still be freaked out about a dang period.|`|7Igsjoz7aa	What's your question? Yeah sure he's imbarrased because you're his younger sister...
1z3C0R2Vaa	still young wait three more years.|`|bSZK2tVtaa	I know this is going to sound crazy. But stop trying. Loll not telling you your young but as soon as you stop thinking about it all the time and stop trying you will get pregnant believe me i've done alot of research on it loll.     But also have sex on the days you ovulate.  Good luck    Sara-|`|WxEmrNAOaa	how old are you exactly?|`|FTW82Wumaa	You never said how old you were. Which leads me to believe that you know yourself deep down that you are much too young to be trying to get pregnant and you know that everyone else would think so too.     I mean, what do you think is going to happen? You get pregnant, finish school, get married, land an awesome job and live happily ever after?    Wrong.     Who's gonna watch the baby? What about insurance? Do you think you're going to be able to finish school AND go to college? Do you have any idea of how difficult that would be? Or how much a baby can cost? Do you even know how much childcare can run per week? And if so, how do you plan on affording any of it?     I think you need to think long nd hard about this. It's a life changing decision that I don't know you are mature enough to understand. You seem intelligent so please, at least consider it. You have years to have kids.|`|3l9Dlidiaa	I think it's ridiculous that you are trying to have a baby.  You are still a baby yourself.  Do you even have a job to support the kid?  Grow up and think about it in a few years.|`|RLbN2Ujhaa	I hate to throw in a lecture, too, but having a baby in the hospital costs about $8000, give or take a few bucks. Then there are diapers and clothes and well-baby doctor visits which can easily be another $1000 in the first year, and that's for healthy-baby visits, not sick calls. I'm going to assume you will be breastfeeding the first year because formula costs around $100 a month, unless your baby has allergy problems and needs to be on the prescription stuff that is about $300 a month. Does your boyfriend make enough money to enable you to stay home with your baby full-time, because day care costs between $100-250 a WEEK. In regards to general fertility, a couple in perfect health with perfect timing only has a 20% chance of getting pregnant in any given month, so 4 months is not that long to suspect any problems.|`|rA4F2J6Iaa	raising a child is very hard. you are both very young i hope you realize what you're getting yourselves into. I was 22 when i had my little boy my husband was 27 and life isn't easy. I'm not saying it's not great but not simple anymore. You're very young both of you I'd wait a bit longer....if you're ready for a baby why don't you get married first if you want to raise your child with this man don't you want to get married.........niether of you can legally drink and you can't even legally vote or technically you can't sign anything and make it legal......    life will change do you really feel you have the financial assets and maturity and security to bring another life into this world..........    why do you think the docs are not on your side....they have much more life experience and have probably seen young teens like yourselves you might want to take their advice as they know more than you.
muRI850haa	It sound like your mother is having some anger issues and is taking them out on you. That being said, abuse is never ok. If you feel like you are in any kind of danger, I would suggest calling police or humane society. They will likely place you temporarily in a shelter until your mother can be dealt with.    If do not feel as if you are in danger, then you probably should avoid the above extreme scenario. What you need to do is pull your mother aside in a room with just the two of you. Stay calm and tell her that you have notice that there has been a lot of tension between you lately. When she speaks, listen. Make sure you don't whine or accuse. Try to understand what your mother is going through. Tell her you love her try to come up with an agreement. Perhaps you could agree on what your punishment should be if you get in trouble.     I keep my email open on YA profile if you want more advice about this.|`|HvALvdc7aa	Do you have any other family you can stay with? My dad treated me worse than my brothers growing up. I had a job, like you, and tried to save enough money to move out on my own. I was 17 before I saved enough and got a roommate to split the bills with. It was a sh*thole apartment but it was better than living with all that drama.|`|0PVp8Okoaa	That's abuse!! I think she needs to seek help, it seems like she has some issues...    As for you, I think you should talk to a trusted adult or counsellor to sort out this problem.. good luck.|`|AA11348344	omg, don't say that. I swear this world, is going into havic. I think you just need to ignore her. If she tell's you to do something to it.|`|kh6Qh9Usaa	Ring Childline!     Maybe you should tell her that she shouldn't take things out on you..

This sounds like abuse. This is just wrong
vdIZU4ePaa	CONGRATS! Seriously you can go at any moment. When I was at that stage with one of my children, I had her the very next morning in two hours flat lol. You could go any time tonight or through the weekend. But I am pretty sure you will give birth in the next 48 hours.    congrats on the baby.|`|rmse6Mj8aa	so sorry this is the trying to conceive page, so no idea! you could ask again in the pregnancy page? they will know.|`|Bxvs28oBaa	I don't know but congrats!!!I think soon!!!|`|irGE84Qdaa	u can be dilate more the next day or it can take 2 weeks more ,i m 35 weeks have not dilate a bit baby didn't drop and nothing happened so far m just so frustrated.|`|MsipL0Mzaa	you could go quick or it could take forever.....theres no way to determine but your off to a good start!!.try walking a good bit...or some sex to get things going...goodluck!|`|LABC73E7aa	different for every woman. im 38wks and only 1cm. congrats and good luck!|`|bsge5nZPaa	It could be later tonight or next week, or heck you could even be late!!   I am 39 weeks pregnant, I am just now 2 centimeters, and 50% effaced!! Just depends on your body!!|`|NtcezzKEaa	Wow.. I think you could go before friday.. If you want to help it progress you could get someone to walk with you.. either down the road (if u live in a low traffic area) or just walk around your house.. Good Luck!|`|ke2SGcZDaa	Um...I'm 39 weeks and 3 days. I am due on Monday and I'm dilated to 5 and almost fully effaced and my water hasn't broken and no labor. If the baby doesn't come by the 4th, I might need help by being induced. I was stuck at 3 cm for almost 3 weeks. The more contractions you have, the more you will dilate. I haven't found that walking really helps, but towards the end, sex helps. The period like cramps are pre labor. You really want to look for those diarrheal cramps. Those are the strong contractions that help dilate you the fastest. Or so my doctor says. I found that sex irritated my cervix and I went from 3 to 5 cm in one week. Hope that helps and good luck with your labor and delivery!!
KICQQxLxaa	The "No Cry Sleep Solution" by Elizabeth Pantley.  It will take some work though, but it will be worth it not having Sophie cry herself to sleep!!  http://www.pantley.com/elizabeth/books/0...    Check out her website before you get the book to see if it is something you could do.  She has many ideas, etc on the website.    I see she now has a "No cry Nap solution" book.|`|iH2whFkHaa	Have you tried lying down with her until she is asleep and putting her in her crib later(at least 10 minutes after she's been asleep) ?     Try  wrapping her in a piece of your (worn) clothing(your scent)  putting her to bed with a warm rice sock(mimicking your body heat)  having white noise in the room(fan, ocean sounds etc.)  recording the sound of your breathing and have it playing nearby her  swaddling her  getting an Arm's reach co-sleeper to put at the side of the bed.|`|UNXf7lZZaa	The only thing I could recommend is rocking her to sleep. If there is a rocking chair in her room, you could try to rock her to sleep. It takes a little more time but it gives her that feeling that you are with her and once she is asleep (or half asleep) just place her in her bed and she will sleep. I wish I could recommend another method, but that is all I have.     I sincerely hope I helped :)|`|jHHMSTmEaa	my daughter also had trouble moving to her crib.  So this is what worked for me. Every night she gets rocked to sleep with a full bottle (to help her sleep longer) then before i put her in her crib i use a heating pad to warm it up. I take it out just before i lay her down then wrap the blanket snugly around her. She will not sleep in the crib if its cold. Worked like a charm. good luck!|`|cEgI5ogLaa	All the other methods involve you doing something else that you will have to continue doing every time your daughter needs to go to sleep, if you get in the habit of rocking her to sleep then laying her down, you will have to continue rocking her to sleep to lay her down ect. We used the ferber method which is an altered CIO method where you only let her cry for 1-2 minutes then go in and reassure her and comfort her - without picking her up. Then leave before she falls asleep. Wait 2-3 minutes and do it again, then wait 4-5 minutes and again we built up to 7 minutes and wouldn't go any longer than every 7 minutes until she finally fell asleep. (The CIO method actually says to build up to 10 minutes but I couldn't wait that long). Anyway my daughter has been sleeping through the night 8pm-8:30am) since she was about 7 months old. It took us 3 nights of being consistant with doing this. Now even when she wakes up in the middle of the night, she has learned to sooth her self back to sleep, and in the mornings she plays in her crib until I go in and get her. My pediatrition said that this was a GREAT method and has 100% statistics in working - as long as the parent is consistant within 6-7 days, on average by the 3rd night the baby is sleeping through. I did a lot of readin and tried a lot of different things, but this was the one that worked, and the one that made the most sense.  Good luck.  Toni Lynne|`|vrwFgpNKaa	you about 6 months to late. bad habits from the start means long term  sleeping problems. i had my daughter in her own room from day 1, she has slept thru the night 9 pm to 8 am from 6 weeks. unfortunately no matter what you do she WILL scream the house down|`|fy69hAeQaa	I would try rocking her to sleep. When she is fully asleep put her down in her crib. If she wakes up, rock her again. Keep repeating the process. Do this every night and eventually she will go to sleep in her own bed. Good Luck!
tjNJAn75aa	I used to get like this because we leave feeding ourselves till last and by then we are too tired to eat and too hungry to sleep. I also work in a restaurant so I start work at 5pm and finish at midnight. I'd eat lunch, go to work and then am too tired to eat when I get home. Also its so unhealthy to eat that late. Find things that are really easy to prepare so even when your tired you have the energy to cook them. I like to buy fresh burgers so i can stick them in the george forman for 5 minutes then just pop it in a bun. Or if you know your that bad, when you do have the energy cook some meals like pasta or cottage pie, lasagna and put in the fridge so you can just heat up in the microwave. Or make sandwiches and keep them in the fridge. Its also about getting your meal times in a routine and training your stomach to get used to it. As I said I rarely eat after 5pm so now my body is never hungry after that  as long as I eat lunch late at like 3pm.
X14EmlrXaa	I love Serena because it isn't used that much. Faith gives it a solid touch. Faite is really cool for a girl and a boy. Cooler for a boy though!  Auna is uncommon and it is cute. I am considering Auna Belle if I have a girl because I am pregnant.  Maranda is nice but commen, I am a fan of unique names.  Selena is Beautiful. I have been thinking of wither Selena Auburnlee or Selena Manka  Alana is cute  Sophie is nice but popular  I was thinking of Sophie Bre if I have a baby girl  Madison is very cute, I like it but i would use a unique name if I chose this. I was actually considering Madison Atiya....That makes is new but still a cute name and not made up  Lara is not weird at all, it is better then Clara but i like both names    I hope I helped|`|5sYzlAjPaa	I like Serena, Selena, Alana and Madison|`|DkVqOe8Iaa	Selena is nice.  Alana is nice.  Madison is  nice.|`|4TNavgDuaa	I like Serena Faith!|`|TANToYsnaa	i have never heard of these names except for madison  but there all nice and unique|`|tWKZVDG2aa	I love Lara.  If I have a daughter I am considering naming her Lara.    Good Luck!!|`|U5ZOkDj6aa	i like selena those names are a little too weird for me   srry|`|urmhRHwxaa	I'd go with Serena, Sophie, or Lara.  The rest look like misspellings, and Madison is just too yuppified.|`|WEYA89znaa	I like Madison Faith and Clara Selena.   Both are very classic and pretty names.     Good Luck :]|`|jU80mmJraa	i like alana the best    its sooo cute|`|dnGJ5JLgaa	I like the name Serena Faith it sounds pretty  Faite?  Not sure!  Auna... unique!  Maranda and you can spell it Miranda.  I don't like the name Miranda but it is nice.  Selena !  Love it!  pretty and unique  Alana I like it it is a really pretty name  Sophie  so cute!  Madison  used alot but cute!  Lara-  I don't like Lara but I do like Clara!    hope i helped!|`|2U6XXwbVaa	i like the names  madison  selena  sophie  lara  and alana  their really good names..|`|h3LXI1Wvaa	i definitely really like the name Alana;  Sophie and Madison are also cute, they're kind of common but still a tad unique :)|`|8v40KEd0aa	Sophie  &  Madison|`|1fb5WNl1aa	I like Sophie the best! It's such a sweet name|`|6hDnMQpoaa	I love Clara, it was my grandmothers name, also Madison is adorable!|`|m4uJoEtGaa	lara is pretty nice .... goood luck|`|qMeQAPjmaa	I like Madison sophie maranda and selena|`|OhaosQ14aa	i love the names  sophie  madison  and   lara|`|UNXf7lZZaa	My favorite names from this list are Alana, Sophie, and Madison.     I think all the names on the list have a certain flow and they are all nice names, however I think those are the top three best. Also, I think if you are going to use these names there is no reason to change the spelling. For instance, Maranda, you could just spell this name are Miranda. And Lara, just spell it as Laura.   This is just my opinion and I hope I helped :)|`|6pevwBizaa	I love Serena Faith! That's such a pretty combination of names!   The only other ones I like on your list are Alana, Sophie, Madison, & Selena.   But don't pick just on what ppl say here. If you have a favorite, go for it. Look up their meanings! You might like what one of them means a lot. And warning, if you don't want to pick a name many other kids will have, stay away from Madison, Selena, and Sophie --- Madison & Sophie are already popular & Selena Gomez will probably make that name a popular one.|`|VrbvnJE1aa	Lara  Sophie|`|HH6Z3jQ0aa	i like salena alot, alana, serena too but def. not lara
41750b9e94be3f10bf789863a1a3a228aa	I try to drink really cold water when I get that mid day exhaustion.  It does help a bit.  Also, try to relax at home and go to bed as early as you can to get to get LOTS of rest.  Good Luck!|`|Bxvs28oBaa	Dude you are 7 month pregnant.Maturnity leave people take at 6.Don't do that to yourself.Get your stuff and go home! That's what I did.You need to rest to have a healthy baby!!!!|`|3aqm1SDbaa	I have the same problem, after I eat I usually get up and walk around or clean or something for at least 10 minutes, but this only keeps me awake for about 2 hours then I start to get the fatigues again.|`|zRc4Swewaa	I shouldn't force myself to stay awake if your are pregnant,it will cause you stress to your and to your baby.When the baby comes out you will have to wake up every three hours or less to feed her.So you have to sleep enough while the baby is inside so that you will have enough resistance when she/he comes out.I tell you you can't sleep even though you want to.I'm not telling you this to add stress but it's a fact.You have to sleep a lot,give yourself a little break like asking your partner to help you with the chores at home.So that you can sleep early at night,you have to sleep 8hrs.or more at the most to stay awake in the day.Hope this will help.|`|vmWEm4Jzaa	i worked up until my water broke (at work) with 2 of my boys. i think you just have to power through it! otherwise maybe a little coffee in moderation. sorry! pregnancy just makes you tired at the end!
AA10093245	It probably will, over time.  That fine body hair is called lanugo hair, and it's a holdover from our prehistoric hairier days. Some kids have a lot of it and it falls out later as they get a little older.  It could be a sign of hormonal imbalance, if it's really thick you might want to ask the pediatrician to test her hormone levels.|`|jlZZbdIjaa	she's a werewolf! jk it might drop out take her to a  dermatologist or a plain old doctor|`|C0GeEv7kaa	It's very common for babies to have hairy bodies and it usually falls out. It's also common for a lot of ethnicities to have extra hair on their bodies that others wouldn't. At age 3 the hair could still fall out with age but you have to just wait it out and see. Good luck!|`|bogfZ6Xsaa	It could go either way, but I would let her decide when she's old enough what she'd like to do about it! Don't worry about it though! And try not to tease and let people tease her or her self esteem will suffer! Hope this helps!|`|tAYXUXreaa	I know of a few children who had really hairy arms and it never went away. I guess it has a lot to do on family history. I actually read about a girl who when she was little she modeled and she had too much hair in some places so her mom took her to get waxed. She said that she no longer has to shave anything because after being waxed it made the hair stop growing. Seems a little extreme for a three year old, but is something to look into once she gets older. Children can be really mean. If there is a way to stop our child from being hurt in later years, it might be worth looking into.|`|AA11349925	as she grows the surface of her skin will become larger and the hair less noticable, by the time she is a teenager it will most likley have lightened too.|`|unlQZyfNaa	lets hope so, you dont want your daughter to be veryhairy    get her waxed.|`|HH6Z3jQ0aa	i know twins that are like that and it didnt go away so idk try to ask your doctor it might or it might not|`|wp41KA00aa	you really can't tell. You just gotta hope so. If she is a teenager, and still has a hairy back, I would consider waxing her|`|dh3l99QXaa	that's common in a lot of children and it does go away  my little niece was like that and her dad had a hairy back an hers went away|`|AA10487943	Everyone is different, so it is hard to say.  My daughter's father was Mexican and I am white. She has the same exact thing going on.  I wish I could say otherwise, but she is going to be 5, and the hair is still there.|`|0rpS2b97aa	I doubt it.  It might lighten with sun exposure.  I think the darker the complexion, the more prone to hair.  Maybe it is just more noticeable with darker hair.|`|ade60a82747a7419784d380017a2a656aa	geez. just accept your daughter how she is.  if she's older and she hates her hairy back, then you could let her wax it. but don't do it before SHE has any say in it. if she learns that you waxed her back when she was 3 because you couldn't stand it, that would probably hurt her feelings.    lol =]|`|mbHOvWxKaa	yea it will but later when she is a teen
hkQSqPEwaa	yes.  If you do not tell him you left; what happen if the house was on fire. and he think that you have the baby.|`|HbaxtX44aa	kinda i suppose you could of woke him up|`|fdnbXfvfaa	Yes. I do   What if your house went on fire|`|pS9yoeLuaa	Yes that's considering leaving them alone.  You could have woken him up.. told him you were leaving...   Or you could have gotten a baby monitor, put it next to your husband, and turned up the volume in case the baby woke up and left a note next to it saying "brb!"|`|c55O7jqXaa	This would not be ok in my eyes. You should have told your Husband to keep an ear out for the baby or go in and sleep near the baby.|`|DNygQdmVaa	If he didnt know then yes.    but ill admit ive done that once. I just had to go to store to grab something for dinner.    As long as your not gone long.|`|HpdoXlYdaa	Yes, yes and a million times yes. Don't leave you're child in this situation unless he's 7+, IE, able to wake up the parent if necessary. Even then it's risky; so don't do leave them that way for long.|`|v1IzWlqQaa	Yes I consider that leaving the Child alone...You needed to wake your husband up and let him know...If something were to happen and He was trying to rush out the house He would think you had the baby...|`|SRsFkNBBaa	i consider it stupid & irresponsibile. that is a dangerous senario that could have been easily avoided.  considering the child alone has nothing to do with it. obviously the child isn't alone if the dad was ther. but it was stupid and irresponsibile to leave without making sure he was awake enough to know he has the baby.  just a litle note. -my nephew died in the same type of situation. he was 3 months old. my brother left for work, before leaving he woke his girlfriend up and told her he was leaving and the baby was in a bouncer in the living room. told her to get up. he didn't make sure, and when he came home 3 hours later on break, the baby was in the same position, and she was still asleep down the hall in bed. the baby was pronounced dead hour later at the hospital. he had a cold, and they think he gagged on drainage. very avoidable. an accident completely, but very avoidable. if she would have gotten her butt up, she could have noticed the baby gagging and intervened.|`|hhPIfuiZaa	of course it is leaving the child alone.  what is wrong with you, anything could have happened to your child.|`|b4b38acbe2582b7a823dd09b00982594aa	Yes.     Why can't he hear her? What if something happened to her or she needed something? You should have woken your husband up and told her you were going, put the baby in the same room, or put a baby monitor with him so he could hear her if she started crying.|`|PFO1jxZGaa	:D that has happend to me so many times. I would tell my husband I'm going ( hes sleeping and so are the kids) and when I came back ( about a half  hour later) the kids would be up and he was still sleeping.. And he swears he never heard me telling him I was leaving... But yeah, it is alone because at least in case of my husband, he wont wake up for their crying... so if something happened he wouldnt wake up to help...   Now I've learned my lesson and when I leave I make him move to the couch so at least he is closer but still sometimes his asleep and my daughter ( 18 mos) is elbow deep in his soda class... ( I only go to drop of my son to school or to the corner store for 15 min etc, but still... maybe I shouldnt..)
ie5hk2hKaa	I would wait another 4 days time and take another test.  The spotting may be because you are loosing weight but may also be because you are at the early stages of pregnancy?  Not wanting to get your hopes up but it is possible?|`|OojSd6nxaa	IMy guest is they miss something ,I think u shuold get another test krystal.|`|Bs8sllD9aa	Call the doctor if things just don't seem right but I personally wouldn't be worried some times our body likes to throw curve balls|`|yOFWD0unaa	I'd suggest seeing your doctor. Get a blood test to see if you are preggers you never know. Sometimes those tests don't work for some women. Good luck!|`|N2KNgB93aa	See a doctor or try more tests. Sometimes, one try doesn't cut itl|`|5172f7acc2e1d638cd1863aaf0963b91aa	wait a bit longer and take a few more tests
pXSKSS3daa	I did for the first day because it was urged by the nurses at the hospital. Other than that, I never have.    Unless your baby has/had a problem putting on weight or had allergic reactions to multiple things I don't see a point in keeping a food journal for them.|`|p2Njf5gBaa	I never did this, not ever.     Unless directed to do so by a doctor for a medical reason,  I see no reason as to why this is necessary.      I have heard in some situations parents being told to keep track of what they are eatting in the first few weeks for different reasons.  But at this point, you definetly can stop keeping track.  Its definetly no longer necessary.  I am sure you have enough knowledge and instinct of your child by now to know if he is eating enough.|`|jsdDgIuRaa	A food journal?  I have never heard of that, I never kept anything like that.    As long as the baby is gaining weight and pees and poops they are eating enough.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	I've never heard of such a thing.  I never kept a journal of how much my daughter was drinking.|`|J5V9dvm8aa	I have never kept one.  I'm sure you'll be fine to stop doing it now.
T6nmD3X9aa	its saline. It's fine. Be careful not to spray too much, usually just dripping the solution into the nose is fine.   If it does turn red or has any signs of a reaction, then call your doctor, but it is not real likely because it is just saline solution.|`|lKVQ6OXYaa	just wash with some clean water if it burns or irritates...|`|vJEatJFPaa	He will be fine...Maybe irritated for a little while but fine :)|`|fT7cp20baa	all it is is salt water he'll be fine|`|4TNavgDuaa	Yeah he will be fine. I work at a hospital and sometimes people use it inside their eyes or on their contacts.|`|Y0j4N2x0aa	it's just saline.  i think you will be ok.  i have used little noses saline spray for years.  we have had it in the eye before.  i think your baby is just fine.  if you have any questions, it's ok to call your doc.  i am sure your doc has had many questions like this one.      take care and i'm sure he's ok.  give him a big hug and kiss.  he won't know what it's for but he will love the attention:)|`|bql2RJzWaa	He should be fine. But i've found the drops WAY easier to give;)|`|YqeatZB4aa	It is just saline solution it should be ok. Read the bottle and see what it says to do if it gets in the eyes. But I think that he should be ok and if he wasn't he would have freaked out and started screaming.|`|Z7a9BiCeaa	HARMLESS. Just a bit of salt and water. Won't hurt him a bit. Baby meds are very safe.|`|DPegPYRPaa	No Worries! There are no bad things in it. He will be just fine.|`|ea4WciVvaa	He will be perfectly fine . Its pretty much just water and salt in the saline solution. My doctor tells me how to make it at home for quick fixes for my children. Dont worry :) If its still bothering you call your doc and let them know and they can reassure you.|`|h5Bf33ieaa	dont worry is not gonna hurt the baby just wash his eye and keep an eye closer to see if he has any reaction! saline nasal spray is recommended for doctors!|`|CNlfn5Wraa	Shouldn't be a problem if it is just saline. They use saline to flush eyes when you get something in your eye. If you are still worried check with your pediatrician. Good Luck!|`|irGE84Qdaa	its ok dontworry it wont hurt him.he,ll be fine just on the safe side put all of the medicines reach out of children|`|cvoQ2ZJNaa	I used to use it myself - don't worry, if it was a small amount it should be harmless. Keep note of which eye it was and how long ago it happened in case something comes up, though if about 2 weeks go  by and nothing happens he sould be fine.|`|AA11109657	You should be fine. Saline solution should be neutral to him (assume it is like seawater only purer) Will dilute in the eye flow later. Still, would check with your pediatrician and ensure is an approved saline solution by him
v112chdZaa	Keep reading Fun Books - like Dr. Seuss - to her.  If you keep reading to her, she'll want to soon read to you.  You can also write her little notes and tell her that they are special notes for just her, but only she can read them. Good luck. It's awesome when they start reading and getting it.
hThW3ioKaa	Suck it up and get over it! You are a teenager and you have a little brother that you have to look after... so what? So do a lot of other teens, and a lot of others have it way worse! Be happy for what you have and just be the best big sister you can be. It's part of growing up, and even though it sucks right now and you don't realize it, your brother will look up to you and love you for it in the long run!|`|jTM6Upm5aa	It sound like the both of  you need a caregiver while your parents are at work. Obviously you can`t get along,although you are a great student and get As, it doesn`t mean you`re mature enough to babysit.I think your mom should hire an older teen to watch the both of you, a girl in her late teens, ( 17).It can, actually, be very dangerous for the both of you, fighting all the time without your parents there to help resolve the issue. I`ve seen this happen to my neighbour`s three kids. I had to go over there and resolve most of the fights. The middle child locked the others out of the house.|`|pS9yoeLuaa	You need to be brutally honest with your mother.  You need to sit her down and tell her that you're being a mother to her son instead of her being the mother of you both, and that it's not fair because you want to live your life without having to care for somebody else until YOU, yourself, are ready to be a mother.   Tell her flat out that you're putting your foot down and you're not doing it anymore. It's time for her to start acting like a mother.  If she doesn't listen to you, the next time you're left with your brother simply don't do anything. Don't clean up after him or tell him what to do, and that will teach him AND your mother a lesson.|`|c55O7jqXaa	You are right in you are not his Mother. Yes occasionally with your consent to watch him, but either pay you something or get you something special for helping out past your duties.      Have you talked to your Dad about this? Have you considered living with your Dad to get away from all of this?|`|HbaxtX44aa	well,all families need to make sacrifices,noone said it was fair.my kids do alot of chores,because i say so.your mom needs your help,and that is why you are doing it.but...i think you should sit down with mom,start off with ..mom,i really would like to talk to you about some things that are bugging me...explain how you feel,ask if your brother could begin taking on more chores so you have a little more 'me' time.ask her what she thinks about giving you a day or two during the week to get with some of your friends....i wish you luck|`|9hggEdf1aa	Try talking to your mom about how you feel.  If she does not listen then write a letter and give it to her. Tell you mom about your feelings, try not to blame your mom but let her know you are frustrated and need to enjoy your teenage years.  If your mom still doesn't listen or understand then try talking to your grandmother or your aunt about it.  Good luck with everything and concentrate on ur studies!!|`|ed1fd474ffe907b183e2991c2f9b248daa	Could you sit down with your mum. Tell her that you don't mind sometimes, but you need time off too! Work out a schedule. Also you need a set list of chores that are divided and rotated (so one week you take out the rubbish, the next week your sibling does).  If you handle it maturely you mum will hopefully realise you have thought about it.
1thzSbS8aa	Does your boyfriend have ovaries and a uterus? No, he doesn't.  Does his uncle have ovaries and a uterus? No, he doesn't.  Is your boyfriend's uncle a gynecologist or fertility specialist? Obviously not.    Here's something else that is obvious. Your ovaries don't have eyes or brains, so they can't count to three, and they can't read calendars or dates. They operate according to hormonal signals, which are not set in stone, and can change from month to month especially when you're beginning or ending your childbearing years.     Every girl is different. Unless you are actively charting your ovulation each month, you have no real idea when you ovulate. And if a girl has no real idea, her boyfriend has even less of an idea.    Just so you know, a girl with a short menstrual cycle  can be ovulating RIGHT after her period ends. And sperm cells can live 3-5 days in the reproductive tract.|`|nqINitkmaa	Any time you have sex you can get pregnant... doesnt matter when.... ANYTIME!! So use protection!|`|dd8cb229ee241de8ca385f84ec4b33d7aa	no that is not true    Every person is different    Anytime you have sex you can get pregnant    Sperm lives in the body for a few days    Never have sex with out protection if you do not want to get pregnant|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	Your bf and his uncle are full of it.  You can get pregnant at any time in your cycle so make sure you always use protection.|`|TgU9P6pdaa	No that's not true.  There is ALWAYS  chance of pregnancy, not matter how low or high it is.  Just because he didn't ejaculate doesn't mean anything either, a guy releases "pre-***" during sex which can get you pregnant.  Use protection, god.|`|QP8LdPLeaa	i think anyone who has unprotected sex but doesnt want to get pregnant is an idiotic thing to do no matter what period days youre in.|`|CZIQMIr0aa	You can get pregnant ANYTIME! Don't listen to him! If you've have unprotected sex [it doesn't matter if he ejaculated inside of you, pre-*** does have semen that can inseminate an egg in it] you need to take the morning after pill - if you've had the unprotected sex under 72 hours ago! If it was longer than that then you need to go to your doctor and tell him so and he can do a pregnancy test for you!|`|b02b80202f3e9ef2663844e95c136d09aa	No it's not true.  This is why so many young girls have unplanned pregnancies.  It's so easy to get them to believe stupid mess like this.|`|zFb022Iiaa	There isn't a time that it's impossible to get pregnant.  Just times when it's less likely.|`|175ydQo5aa	not true,  you can get pregnant even on your period because sperm can stay alive in you for up to 3 days. and it only takes 1 of them to do the deed|`|l3eT6IZzaa	you can ALWAYS get pregnant... even a higher chance when you're on your period...|`|cxw5trhlaa	It's unlikely, but it's not *impossible*    http://www.babycenter.com/404_can-you-ge...|`|DkVofG9paa	that is Absolutely untrue.  Sperm can stay in your system for up to three days and if you start to ovulate the prior sperm can get you prego when your egg drops.  It says it right here on www.webmd.com|`|qHAgbuHkaa	No that is not true. Most people ovulate a week after their period ends and typically, the closer you have sex to ovulation, the more likely you can get pregnant, but it can still happen. Some people ovulate earlier and some later. I have 30-32 day cycles and I ovulate about 10 days after my period ends. My friend has 26 day cycles and she ovulates about 6 days after her's ends. However, here's the catch..if you have sex 3 days after your period ends, and you don't ovulate for another 3-4 days (which is normal ovulation time for most people) you can still get pregnant because sperm can live inside you for 3-5 days. If you have sperm in you from sex, and 3-4 days later you ovulate, you may still have sperm inside of you waiting for ovulation.|`|XtbjzpK7aa	no.|`|rgOPYV7naa	no. that's not true.|`|8lwGjvQpaa	i think Christan's do that|`|6pU9T5HMaa	All that sorta thing is rubbish, always be safe rather than sorry.|`|jtlcYqutaa	nooooo take no chances never!!!!!!!!|`|Rnaub4P6aa	that is very true but, you could end up pregenat after the sex and your period if you want to have a baby then go for it|`|sC0NvRzEaa	Your boyfriend is telling you that, because he wants some and he doesn't want to use anything. Any time there is unprotected sex there is a chance, sometimes the chances are lower, but they are still there.  Good Luck|`|GTb4UyCkaa	That might be true of some women but I wouldn't bet on it. Every woman has different fertile days during the month.|`|2uG0QNQyaa	No. NEVER TAKE CHANCES, besides you could get std's and stuff like that. It is safer to always use protection. for everybody's sake!|`|ikzqudHTaa	There is a certain time in your cycle when you are infertile, but it doesn't correspond with an exact amount of time after your period, and in young women it tends to vary, so the only way to be sure that you are infertile at any given time is to regularly measure your fertility. You can buy kits to do this. If you haven't measured it, however, it is NOT advisable to assume that you are incapable of getting pregnant at any time, because you could be wrong. Always use birth control.|`|Yne56Ye0aa	GOD , people get there information from the stuidest sources.     Okay, You can get pregnant when you ovulate which for MOST girls is 14 day's after the FIRST day of your period. BUT sperm can live in the female body for 48-72 hours! so you can get pregnant if you have sex 3 day's BEFORE you ovulate.|`|oQDQSSSDaa	It can happen anytime within the cycle of your period.
nGYa6gMUaa	From all of the stress of not knowing if you are pregnant or not you will most likely be late on your period. You should relax as much as you can and wait a week from when you are late to test. stress can push it off as late a 3 weeks. In the mean time you shouldn't smoke, drink or do anything that could potentialy hurt the baby if you actually are pregnant. Don't stress about it for at least a week. After that you should take a pregnancy test. The cramping is probably from you being due on your priod tomorrow. I know that I get cramps as earily as a week before i get my period. Even though you don't normaly get cramps earily there is a first time for everything. You may be alergic to the material your bra is made out of, or from dry skin. When your pregnant your boobs get tender, not too ichy.|`|54cf275d0238f8dd4d90351c9a055b00aa	It is possible to get a positive by tomorrow but if you dont and still dont get your period then you need to wait a few days and test again.|`|eHow24rNaa	i would wait atleast a week before i would test. you could be stressing out from the possibility of being pregnant. Just give it a few more days and if you dont start in a week, i would get a test.|`|Bxvs28oBaa	I tested 4 days before my period and I came out positive but I felt that when I go pee my bloder is kinda relicing my urine differently.I just had lodded stomach.I am very skinny mayby thats why I felt so early ,and yeah boobs! They felt wired.Didn't hurt yet but were like swallen|`|Fx77zYhWaa	Yeah most test can tell you're pregnant the day you're  due for your period.|`|80c673f290ffd2a76bf4b398c675adbbaa	if you had no idea when your period was due you should test no less than 19 days after you had sex, in this case because you know when your period is due you can test now but use first urine of the day... then repeat after 4weeks that way you wud nearly be a month prego|`|rTAvnldfaa	you can get pregnancy tests these days that can be taken a few days before your period is due, so test now! the test becomes more accurate after your period is due and the best time to test is first thing in the morning. if still comes negative try every couple of days xx|`|NtcezzKEaa	U could test tomorrow.. get an early result test.. if it comes out negative and mother nature still doesnt come by a week later, then test again.. good luck!|`|0xTvvjiYaa	My Dr. told me to wait until I'm two weeks late. If you still don't get it by then you can get a test that will tell you clearly either Pregnant or not.    Although, My friend Maria couldn't get a positive on a test until she was four months prego.    I guess everyone is different.|`|ycy0y5Qqaa	you can take a test up to five days before your last period but it's not guaranteed you will get a definite answer.  the dollar store now sells pregnancy tests try that always use the first morning pee to test and if it turns out positive then buy a more common test from walgreens, walmart if that is positive then call your dr for a test or go somewhere like planned parenthood if you are under 18|`|B2WyO7gjaa	u tomorrow if you can...in the morning preferably
JkcSEzRHaa	Im breastfeeding my 2 month old breast milk only and i notice if i squeeze the nipple like top and bottom part to make it flat he goes right on try not to stress babies can feel how you are feeling just relax and try to feed him before he starts to cry cause its harder to get them latched on when they are fussy  I wouldn't want to give him formula either gurl so keep up the good work and Im so happy you are breastfeeding GOOD LUCK !! O Try laying on the bed on ur side and bring him close on his side and try that|`|Fd4lITkvaa	My guess is that your milk has come in and it will just take some time to readjust. My son did the same thing. I had him latching like a pro by 2wks old though. Just stick with it and be patient. It's hard, it took us a good 30min to get latched at each feeding. Try to start latching before he is screaming hungry. My son's issue was he wouldn't open his mouth far enough for me to get my breast in his mouth. I had to wait for a good cry to start so his mouth would be open enough. Does your hospital have a breastfeeding support group you can attend? How about a local la leche league leader or meeting?    http://www.llli.org/webindex.html|`|TVC3mAP7aa	There are several things you can do to encourage a newborn to latch.      *Try hand expressing a little breast milk onto your nip before offering it.  Once he gets a little taste, you may have more luck.   *There is a device that you can purchase that will pull your nip out before you feed, making it easier to latch.  You can also pump for a short period of time right before a feeding to draw the nipple out.   *Pumping to activate your let down before latching is also helpful.    *As a last resort, you can try nipple shields.  They will assist baby with latching on.  You can slowly phase them out if baby gets too attached to them.     If all that fails, I would recommend contacting your local chapter of La Leche League.  They can provide you with local support and lactation consultants.  Don't give up!|`|muRI850haa	My mother had this problem with my little brother when he was born. The breast milk was kind souring and causing him to colic. She also noticed that she was beginning to develop a milk intolerance. You might try not drinking milk for a while and see if that helps. You may need to switch to formula in the future.|`|7rkp23uvaa	Are you using an lotions or perfumes?  It may also be the taste of your milk due to your diet.  Babies will forget how to latch even if they did it perfectly a few hours before.  This is why breastfeeding can be difficult.  Keep trying, but don't let him go for more than 3 hours without eating.  If he wont take the breast then pump for now until you can find a solution. I also suggest contacting your hospital to speak with a lactation consultant.|`|DsYlikoYaa	Well you should push him to it by holding his head while doing it or the other way.|`|AA10487943	I had a hard time getting my daughter (and only child)to latch on.  I swear, every nurse and doctor in the building handled my breasts to help find a method and she wasn't having it.  After two weeks of failed attempts, I was depressed and stressed. I know how you feel! I wanted the breastfeeding experience so badly.  I finally had to resort to formula when nothing worked.  Once I switched, we were both less stressed and I had a happy baby with a full, warm tummy.
SnVwHG3iaa	Hey    What i would do if i was in your situation would be to pull my dad to the side, maybe go out for a drink or a meal, and sit him down and have a little chat with him about how upsetting it is to hear your step mum bragging about her daughters pregnancy because of what you are going through just now.  Maybe your dad can have a quiet word with your step mum to tell her to stop bragging because your going through so much at this moment in time.    I kind of know how you feel, i lost my baby sadly last month at 34 weeks stillborn, my best mate is pregnant, and i am so jealous because just now all i want is a baby :( Me and my partner are so upset about what happened and are ttc again.  She has PCOS and was taking clomid for it and she fell pregnant on her 2nd cycle of taking it.  I really do hope you get your BFP in 2 weeks time, fingers crossed for you and lots of baby dust.    I hope things get sorted out with your step mum and that she stops hurting your feelings, she should understand why once your dad has a little word with her why you don't want her bragging.    Best of luck hun!!  xXx|`|RLbN2Ujhaa	when I was ttc, it broke my heart that everyone was pregnant except me, and everyone else was pregnant by accident. If this was me, I'd call my dad and ask him to go out to eat with me, alone, and tell him that it's too heartbreaking to hear over and over about your step-sister right now and you just want the QT with him. Soon it will be your turn and you won't be so hurt by your insensitive step-mother and you can hang out at the house again.
Vjz5VeWaaa	FIRST OFF IT IS 100% ILLEGAL FOR HIM TO TELL YOUR MOTHER ANYTHING, AND HE COULD LOSE HIS JOB AND LICENSE IF HE DID.  YOUR GYNO IS THE PERSON YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO TALK TO ABOUT ALL OF THIS.  MY DOCTOR IS A CLOSE FRIEND OF MY MOTHER AS WELL, BUT WHAT HIM AND I TALK ABOUT IS OUR BUSINESS, NO ONE ELSES.  MAYBE YOU SHOULD SWITCH DOCTORS???    SECONDLY, DID YOU GET EJACULATED IN? YOU SAID HE WASN'T ALL THE WAY IN, WHATEVER THAT MEANS.  IF THERE WAS NO SPERM THEN THERE WILL BE NO BABY.  AND IF THERE WAS ANY SPERM - YOU WOULD KNOW!    AND FINALLY, THE WHITE CREAMY MUCUS IS OVULATION.  I THINK YOU MAY JUST BE ABOUT TO GET YOUR PERIOD.    IF YOU DONT GET IT IN 7 DAYS TEST AGAIN, AND THEN 7 DAYS AFTER THAT TEST AGAIN.      MY ADVICE IS TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR OR FIND A NEW ONE YOU CAN TALK TO.|`|tjgWwfxLaa	well i think if it is a miscarriage your test should be positive depending on time just give it time menstral cycles can be very weird and never the same good luck|`|G024yAU3aa	Number one.  I am not a doctor-but I am a mother, You sound like you have a situation that could be potentially serious.  If you have had a miscarriage and do not seek treatment the remaining tissue can turn toxic in your system and it could cause a serious infection. Sometimes not all of the tissue is naturally disposed of during the miscarriage cycle, you really should see a doctor so that they can properly clean you out.  Number two.  You are an adult and your gyno has a doctor patient confidentiality that they by law have to adhere to-meaning whether he knows you or not he cannot tattle on you to your mother.  It is none of your mother's business if you are pregnant or not. Number three. This is your health and it needs to be your number one priority.  Go see a doctor-you do not need to see your regular gyno if you have these concerns-but I would do it quickly if you have concerns.
tapFZBowaa	We have a chocolate lab, so I painted my son's room a light green color and took some black and white pics of my son and our dog (very friendly) and matted them and put them in black frames.  Then I did shades of chocolate and black for bedding, etc. and found a puppy bedding online.  Turned out SO cute and it was all boy.

joPJtKemaa	My doc never mentioned anything about MSG but its definitely not good for you.    But I do have Chinese food once in a while. Just don't over do it and you should be ok.    To deprive yourself of everything you want to eat during pregnancy is not healthy either.    What about those women who crave McDonald's all the time? It might not have MSG but its crap and their babies r fine.    Don't stress over it.|`|rmse6Mj8aa	MSG - i have never heard of anyone being told to avoid it, but it is horrible stuff and you'd be better off without it anyway. i am allergic to it, it gives me the sweats and the shakes so i keep away from it.  it is only in instant pre packaged food or take aways if you cook or eat fresh food you will have no trouble avoiding it.  congrats.   best of luck to you.|`|yB5go5wbaa	No way, my doctor never said anything about that...it's in everything, too, that's for sure!  It's good that you're eating healthy (way healthier than I have been!), but I wouldn't stress out about making sure you're not eating anything with MSG at all.|`|b17cb0e70d1cd57271e4ba763c7fbc30aa	I think if you can avoid it when possible do it. Its just difficult as its in absolutely everything, and in some products its disguised as another name such as "autolyzed yeast extract"   Anyway its nearly impossible to totally avoid it during pregnancy. I ate foods that contained it and also ate chinese food (that i'm sure wasn't msg free) and my daughter turned out healthy & beautiful.|`|R4CiLKuLaa	My doctor never mentioned anything about it.  However, avoiding MSG wouldn't hurt.  Of course, I live off the stuff practically with my cravings and all of my kids are fine!    Then again, I also eat everything in moderation... such as sushi, tuna, shellfish, etc.   I also eat lunch meat.  Not saying you should, but I'm saying anything in moderation!

As far as months go you are 1month pregnant, but not really becuase technically you have only been pregnant about 3 weeks. I know it's confusing but the more you read about it the more sense it makes.

This is so cute as it keeps the more masculine names Aspen and Finley but Lily makes it more feminine! Congrats.|`|7e700825133cf6328b412b5715dc6692aa	Sorry none way to over the top|`|xK0wN8Pvaa	Alaska Daisy is absolutely adorable I now love that name it is so cute and feminine|`|B2WyO7gjaa	alaska daisy|`|AA11895525	I like Aspen Daisy too!|`|jlrJhCMKaa	Daisy    Aspen and Alaska are places you go...not names for children...|`|ouzrDPaSaa	Aspen Finley is a beautiful name :)  Aspen is on my favourite names list!    Personally, I dont like Alaska Daisy at all, sorry!|`|484fd75888bbb282b3da584ad880893aaa	Alaska Daisy is beautiful for a little girl  Aspen Finley is more of a boys name. :-)|`|S2vI4VEXaa	Aspen Daisy.|`|dd8cb229ee241de8ca385f84ec4b33d7aa	If I saw Aspen Finley, I would assume it's a boys name    Alaska I dislike as a first name    Daisy Finley is cute for a girl|`|ZX2so3twaa	aspen finley.  i hate the name daisy.|`|sfn6SpbCaa	Alaska Daisy|`|5sYzlAjPaa	Aspen Finley seems more masculine to me, so i guess i would choose Alaska Daisy.    I would switch it to Daisy Alaska. Daisy is so cute.|`|CuTvFlxTaa	Sorry but I don't like either. That's my opinion. If I had to choose Alaska Daisy. Is Winter'(s mommy )your little girl's name also?? Why not choose the name Summer? This isn't a joke or an insult I honestly thought it would be complimentary.|`|cn2rvsdOaa	Aspen Daisy|`|McRoWQrAaa	Aspen, awww   i like daisy.  soo: Aspen Daisy.  (:|`|AA11049717	I love Aspen Finley, I think it is pretty!|`|2716717868fe21f32f85869cd02f81d8aa	Daisy Alaska|`|26cnysY3aa	neither they are both horrible     sorry for being blunt!|`|BGIsuNMTaa	Aspen Finley, Alaska daisy sounds like I'l ask a daisy.   Good luck :)|`|qHAgbuHkaa	I don't think I would pick either, but if I had to choose, I would say Aspen.|`|X14EmlrXaa	I love Aspen! I have been considering Aspen Jane for my baby, but I do not know the gender of mine yet, but anyway, Aspen Finley is a sophisticated cute name and I like it. Alaska is okay....I like Daisy though|`|jU80mmJraa	Aspen Daisy|`|wwUAUU48aa	alaska daisy|`|DNygQdmVaa	Alaska Daisy.|`|Xk9uXoW4aa	Alaska Daisy|`|3Yfp3QUfaa	sorry but I would suggest changing it to Daisy Finley.....    hope i helped =p    i was almost named Aspen and honestly totally completely HATE the name, my aunt is Astrid and in her high school everyone teased her and called her *** even though she was nice and popular.

YJNql5Mgaa	14lbs does sound on the higher side of the weight scale for a 2 month old but if I were you, I'd still feed on demand.|`|aLAmvX5Naa	I would certainly not suggest denying your child food this young. If he is hungry, feed him. Babies know when they are hungry. If he didn't need more milk he wouldn't cry for it.|`|vcNvEIOwaa	doctors don't know everything hun......feed him on demand.....that the way they were designed to eat.|`|DNygQdmVaa	That is very big for an 8 week old. my niece is 6 months old and weighs 14 pounds.|`|pXSKSS3daa	LOL... his shoes are too cute!    Your son's doctor is crazy. A baby needs to feed on demand and it certainly doesn't sound like you're over feeding him.    Your son's height is between the 50th and 75th percentile and his weight is between the 75th and 90th percentile. He's fine.|`|iMULlxdgaa	aww cute lil guy...I think your right,  your doc is crazy umm if the baby is hungrey you feed it.  the end.  babies can't get fat on the formula or breast milk anyway, because its not empty calories, they are eating nutrious meal everytime they chug one of those bottles down!.|`|Ezkn5azdaa	My baby girl doctor is doing the same thing to me has well. I am breastfeeding my baby girl. She is 8 weeks has well and having weight issues. I feed her on demand. He expects me to feed her every three hours. I can go past three hours. She wants to eat every 2 to 2 1/2 hours. She can't wait to feed every three hours. Sorry I don't so. Your little guy (he a cutie) is healthy. My baby girl is 9 pounds and 6 ounces last time I know. She goes back tomorrow.|`|IA1irLy7aa	do not listen to the dumb doctor your boy looks healthy if you feed a baby too much they will bring it up.|`|jrCZ6fadaa	LOL, he IS a healthy weight......    What you list doesn't seem like too much to me, If it were me, I would feed him every 2 hours in the day and stretch it out at night when possible.|`|NrwJyffxaa	You can train them or they can train you.  If you want to feed your baby every 2 hours then knock yourself out.  If you want to stretch it further then your baby will survive.  I think your doc is trying to normalize his eating habits.  I don't think he is suggesting your hurting you child.  Remember the long term goal is to train you child to fit into normal eating habits.  When you do that is up to you.    I was a very fat baby until 2 years old and now my selfportait is a stick figure.|`|eya1WDS4aa	This is where your mother instincts kicks in. If your baby eats without spitting up alot then he is fine. If he acts like he is still hungry go for two ounces more. Your baby is the only one that knows how much he wants and its better to let him make the choice. my doctor told me the same thing and i ignored her. My son is now 21 months and he weighs 27 lbs. he is normal for a toddler. Just listen to what your baby wants.|`|87f8699fae346ba5d63a2c44b54e0151aa	You should feed him as often as he is hungry, but he may not need a full 4 oz. every two hours.|`|PBI3tCKaaa	haha! he is to cute!! Feed him when he is hungry, babies know what they want.  As long as he doesn't spit up to much then he is fine,|`|aT7HgLJnaa	If he's hungry feed him- try feeding him 6oz bottles and see if that stretches out the time between feedings and keeps him fuller longer.|`|G6h7mjdpaa	When my daughter was born she was hospitalized for 3 weeks because she would not eat. We finally were discharged with a feeding tube that we worked really hard to get rid of. In the end I ended up feeding  my daughter 4 oz every 2 hours. There was no way she could eat 8oz in one sitting. I tried everything to get her to eat more, but she just couldn't. I stuck with feeding her every 2 hours because it is what worked for us and what kept us out of the hospital. She is now 10 months and still can not eat more than 6 oz per feeding. So in my opinion, you have to do what works for you and your baby. If that means feeding every 2 hours or even every hour so be it.
7igxiGrAaa	Wait until you are at least a week late. Things such as stress, lack of exercise (or over exercising), or change in diet can through you're period off. Most at home pregnancy tests say to wait a week after the initial negative. If you still don't have it after a week and still receive a negative you can get blood work done to find out.    I know it's hard but try not to think about it, the more worried you get the more you will be under stress and the longer it will take to come.|`|QB5D0rG4aa	I am in the same boat as you are. I last had my period on dec 29th and I was supposed to get my period on the 26th but didn't. I took two pregnancy tests and they both said negative but I am usually regular. I think the hormone in our bodies isn't strong enough to really determine if you are pregnant or not. I am going to try in a week so maybe you should too. Good luck ! Baby Dust.......|`|FjGeKhY0aa	I personally can't wait that long so I would test again, at least every other day, but then again there is always a fear of disappointment.|`|wDnP5b0Oaa	a negative test just means youre probably not pregnant. Go to the doctor and see or try another test|`|nUdbTUtHaa	sure just take another test, or make a dr's app. (prolly easier to keep taking tests though)    Idk why ppl always ask if they should take another test...the GOOD ones are like 10 dollars at most, if you're ttc just go to costco and get a whole box of them and have your fun peeing on the stick lol. ^^     Best of luck to you, sounds like you're preggers if you're period is late (and you're not stressed or nothing has changed)|`|1z3C0R2Vaa	not pregnant.|`|ymK1hg2Raa	well, if it's negative than no. that's a no brainer.    take it again. if it's still negative, than you are NOT pregnant.    sorry.|`|VBOroQKUaa	the same thing happened to me this month also!!  but after 8 days late my period came!  i would wait a few more days and test again! if still nothing/neg test result i would go to the doctor!  good luck    when i was pregnant it took 4 test and they all said no! i went to the doctor and it said yes! my body wasnt carrying enough HCG to show up on the home test! so all them ppl saying it's no it's no then dont listen to them!!   every person's HCG level is different!!!|`|tjgWwfxLaa	possible i took one 2 days early which was negative and then another 3 days later and it was a positive  try again and dont get frustrated if it is negative you may also talk to your doctor|`|7QuSEwosaa	Sorry, I doubt you are pregnant. You will probably start your period tomorrow. However, if nothing happens for another week, then take another pregnancy test. Good luck.|`|eHow24rNaa	I would take another test because i had the same thing happen to my friend...she had a little show of blood and 2 days later when she didnt have anymore blood showing, she took a test and it was positive. Its VERY possible your pregnant|`|wOyyZjY0aa	Hello.  Four years ago I would say that if you got a negitive...odds are your period is right around the corner.  However with my daughter I did not a get my positive till I was one week late.  I took the first one the day I was late.  And I always took them right away in the morning (they say a HPT can detect the preg horm the best with your first urine of the day).  So aways.....I tested and waited and tested and waited and nothing.  Finally exactly one week after my period was due I got a positive and sure enough.  I now have a wonderful three year old daughter.  So...it's possible.  I would still wait a few more days (I know that's so much easier said then done).  Wait a few more days and see if your period comes or maybe take another test.  You could also contact you doctor.  However if you don't have regular cycles they probably won't see you for alittle bit yet.    Best of luck!!!!|`|Y2VdU4Pyaa	this is a guide... pt or pregnancy test is effective 2-4 weeks and above! one day afeter no mens is very useless... pt detects your urine changes that has hrmne excreted there...|`|RLbN2Ujhaa	A neg. test means EITHER you tested too early or you're not pregnant and your period is just late. You may have ovulated later than you think and now you are actually testing too soon. Buy some dollar store tests and just keep checking with your first morning urine; you'll either get a period or a positive and then it'll be settled.|`|rCw1HP5Eaa	no you are not, only a positive Symbol means pregnant, but take it again and if it still says genitive then you are not pregnant|`|ea4WciVvaa	Wait at least 2 weeks after your missed period see what  your results are . If your still not sure wait another week or so and test again. You can also see your doc and get tested and they can tell you. You may have cramps because you are going to start or it could be implantation bleeding . Just wait and test again|`|mHcmxfEZaa	It is best to wait 7 days after your period is suppose to come to take a test.  Then if you still do not have a period I would take another one in 3 days.  If your periods are not regular then that could be why the test came back negative.|`|EPGsyJNJaa	you might be pregnant but i would check with your doctor but how old are you anyway don't be like 16 or something because the you will be addicted to sex for  your life!!!!!!!!|`|z54nFnzNaa	well im in the same position as you. My LMP was 12/15. I have a 32 day cycle. I had an iui on 12/31. I was due for AF on 1/18. (according to when i ovulated, i counted 18 days forward). My breasts are tender, really tender, im nauseous, headaches, watery mouth, lower back aches, serious tired and moody to mention a few symptoms, still all my HPTs have been neg. I went to the doctor yesterday and  he did blood and im waiting for the result. I have researched this and have found that many women wont have a positive HPT until well into the fourth week of pregnancy. Some I have read were in their 7th week. anything is possible. You could have miscalculated, or you didn't ovulate when you think you did. Nothing is set in stone. The human body does some weird stuff and stranger things have happened. You still have a chance, wait another week and test again. Good luck and lots of baby dust.
3Yfp3QUfaa	GIRLS:    Evelyn Julianne, rate:4, I think it is kind of olden, I would suggest Evelyn Katherine    Elliana Elizabeth, rate: 9, I like the nickname Eli and Elizabeth sounds good with any name it really flows    Olivia Rose, rate:10, Beatiful name flows well and sounds so elegant and pretty    Charlotte Sarah, rate:3, I dont like it, I dont think it flows well, it kind of sounds like 2 very beatiful names just said next to each other not really a name, I like Charlotte Marie, or Sarah Claire    Eloise Harlowe, rate:2, I dont like it, I think Eloise is olden and not pretty it sounds stuck up, I like Harlowe spelled Harlow and think it is cute, I like Harlow Katelyn, Harlow Alexis    Sophie Mae, rate:8, I think it is cute and flows beautifully, but I dont really like the name Mae. I like Sophie Marie, Sophie Leigh, and Sophie June.     Abigail Mackenzie, rate:7, I think it is cute but I dont like the name abigail, i like just plain Abby Mackenzie, Abagail is the full name but its too much! I like Abby Mackenzie, or Mackenzie Katelyn    Boys:    Emphram Frederick, rate:0 , Im sorry I just hate it, but i dont want to insult it because its one of your family names.     Everett Anderson, rate:3, Again, Im sorry, I dont like it, I guess Everett is cute but I think of Anderson as a last name, not middle. I like Everett Andrew, Everett Anthony, Everett Andy.    Kiernan Cole, rate:4, Not like ing the name Kiernan, Coles cute though. I like Cameron Cole, Cody Cole.    Cohen Marcus, rate:5, Cohen is a last name in my mind, I know two people with that last name. I dont like using a last name as a kids (middle or first) name. I like Cody Marcus, Cory Marcus, Cole Marcus.     Kayden Michael, rate:7, CUTE!!!!! I think it is a cute name even though I dont like the name Kayden it sounds adorable..They could always be called Mike as a nickname!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I like Michael Kayden, but I love what you chose.    Logan Daniel, rate:6, Not bad, Logan is uncommon but not weird and I like it....I like Daniel Logan.    Leland Steven, rate:4, Im sorry, again, I dont like Leland, its uncommon and not cute uncommon, made up uncommon. I like Steven Logan, Logan Steven.     hope i helped =p sorry it prob took sooo long to read.|`|iE6Ol2i1aa	Girls-  Evelyn Julianne - Pretty, don't really like how both endings sound the same though.  Elliana Elizabeth - Elliana sounds odd.  Olivia Rose - Love it!  Charlotte Sarah - Eh,. I like Sarah Charlotte better.  Eloise Harlowe - Don't like.  Sophie Mae - Love it :)  Abigail Mackenzie - It's okay.    Boys-  Ephram Frederick(family name) - I know it's family but no.   Everett Anderson - Nope  Kiernan Cole - No, I like Cole though.  Cohen Marcus - It's okay  Kayden Michael - Like it  Logan Daniel - Like this the best so far  Leland Steven - Nope    I love the fact none are the same and it's a good variety!    Edit: I LOVE Audrey Harper!!!|`|j2qrOjo1aa	sophie mae and kayden michael are my favorite!|`|jziCVIGuaa	I like Audrey Logan and Audrey Harper|`|0GN8kkQYaa	I dig Everett and Sophie. Both are very strong, yet not too common, yet not too weird names.|`|EQhccltyaa	Girls-  Evelyn Julianne- i like it alot 8/10  Elliana Elizabeth- hmm not sure. 7/10  Olivia Rose- i dont like the name olivia 3/10  Charlotte Sarah- dont like the combo 4/10  Eloise Harlowe- 3/10  Sophie Mae -cute 6/10  Abigail Mackenzie - nice 6/10    Boys-  Ephram Frederick(family name)-no 3/10  Everett Anderson hmm i think i like it 6/10  Kiernan Cole- 3/10, i think, if i pronounced it right  Cohen Marcus- good 7/10  Kayden Michael- good 6/10  Logan Daniel- not a fan or either 5/10  Leland Steven- i personally like it, i think it could be made fun of tho 6/10|`|AA11895525	Okay - but I am big on what the initials will be so make sure you don't end up like my nephew who is the CDC!!    For girls I love Charlotte Sarah and Abigail MacKenzie    For boys I love Kiernan Cole and Kayden Michael    Another thing you might want to consider that my best friend pointed out when I was pregnant the first time - if you give your child two names (first and middle) that can be changed about and such you give them much less chance of hating their name.  I've hated mine since birth and my mom guilted me into keeping it.  I was really careful my daughter can be Ally, Allyson, Kaitlya, Kaity or Kait and I've told her when she's 18 she can rename herself whatever she wants - my son's are the same with multiple name variations.|`|Bi4B6awAaa	for the girls i like:  Evelyn  Olivia   for the boys i like:  Everett  Kayden  Logan  but the all are pretty names!|`|EnyhoOmTaa	I LOVE Sophie Mae. I think that's absolutely adorable.  And I love the name Audrey (I don't like the name Harper because I had a professor with that name whom I did not like, but that's my issue, not yours).    And I really love Ephram Frederick (Frederick is a family name for me too) and Logan Daniel.|`|LDkZEqqsaa	Girls:  Olivia Rose  Audrey Harper  Sophia Mae    Boys:  Logan Daniel  Everertt Anderson  And May I suggest Gage or Brody?|`|jlrJhCMKaa	Sophie Mae  & Everett Anderson|`|dnGJ5JLgaa	Evelyn Julianne-  Pretty!  Elliana Elizabeth-  I love Elliana!  Very pretty and cute and unique!  Olivia Rose- I like it cute!  common  Charlotte Sarah-  Sounds too common  Eloise Harlow-  I don't like Eloise but Harlow is very pretty and unique!  Sophie Mae-  Love it!  Pretty!  Abigail Mackenzie- Love it!  Very pretty!  Audrey Harper-  10/10  I love it unique and very pretty!      Ephram Frederick- ?  Everett Anderson-  I like it!  cute  Kiernan Cole-  I like it unique!  Cohen Marcus-  Very cute and unique!  Kayden Michael-  Like it!  Logan Daniel-  Like it sounds common  Leland Steven-  I dont like it|`|eZKP9MhJaa	Abigail Mackenzie and Everett Anderson are my favs.|`|hVrfm4eIaa	My favorites:   Elliana Elizabeth & Olivia Rose  (Ellie & Liv are cute nicknames too)  Everett Anderson & Logan Michael|`|5sYzlAjPaa	I really love Audrey Harper - that is my favorite for the girls. I also like Evelyn Julianne and Eloise Harlowe a lot.    for the boys, i like Everett Anderson the most. Also nice - Logan Daniel.|`|xLabGD6Maa	Girls-  Evelyn Julianne - Love it!  Very feminine.  Elliana Elizabeth - Love Elizabeth; don't care for Elliana  Olivia Rose - Very pretty  Charlotte Sarah - Very pretty  Eloise Harlowe - Eloise sounds old; Harlowe sounds slutty  Sophie Mae - Both old, blah names  Abigail Mackenzie - Abigail is sweet; Mackenzie is a surname.  Audrey Harper - I don't get Odd-ree; Harper is a surname.    Boys-  Ephram Frederick(family name) - Frederick is nice; Ephram makes me think of the old tv show "The FBI"  Everett Anderson - Everett is OK; Anderson is a surname  Kiernan Cole - no  Cohen Marcus - Marcus is great; Cohen is a surname  Kayden Michael - Michael is nice; Kayden isn't  Logan Daniel - Daniel is very nice; Logan is a surname  Leland Steven - Love Steven; Leland, not so much|`|bzkSIJYnaa	Evelyn Julianne - This name doesn't have a great flow. Evelyn is pretty, and so is Julianne (I prefer Julienne or Juliet), but they both end in the N sound. Eveyln Juliet or Evelyn Julia would be better. I think the nickname Evie is adorable.    Elliana Elizabeth - I love Elliana, but I prefer it spelled Eliana. Again, this name doesn't have a good flow, because Elliana begins with El and so does Elizabeth. Elizabeth isn't really an interesting middle name.   I like: Eliana Renee, Eliana Pearl, Eliana Juliet, Eliana Jade, and Eliana Jade.    Olivia Rose - Love it. It's my cousin's name :) I love Olivia, but it's very common, so I would choose a unique middle name. You could try:   Olivia Roselle/Rosella  Olivia Rosalyn  Olivia Rosabelle/Rosabella  Olivia Rosaline (pron. rose-uh-line or rose-uh-leen)  Olivia Rosalie  Olivia Eve  Olivia Ruby  Olivia Charlotte    Charlotte Sarah - I love, love Charlotte, but I don't think Sarah goes well with it at all.  suggestions:  Charlotte Victoria  Charlotte Genevieve  Charlotte Avalon  Charlotte Isabel/Isabelle/Isabella  Charlotte Felicity  Charlotte Rosalie/Rosaline  Charlotte Olivia  Charlotte Vivienne  Charlotte Ivy  Charlotte Caroline  Charlotte Camilla  Charlotte Eliza  Charlotte Wren  Charlotte Gwendolen/Gwendolyn    Eloise Harlowe - I love Eloise, but I really dislike Harlowe, it's a boys name. Try something feminine:  Eloise Victoria  Eloise Charlotte  Eloise Jane    Sophie Mae - my favorite name combo you have on this list. Very cute!    Abigail Mackenzie - Love Abigail, Mackenzie is a boys name and masculine.  try:  Abigail Victoria  Abigail Felicity  Abigail Charlotte  Abigail Cecilia  Abigail Rosalie/Rosaline     Audrey Harper - not a fan of either of the names, sorry. But it has a nice flow.    I love Ephram, Everett, Michael, and Kiernan for boys, just not the way you have them paired.|`|5HGDhEjyaa	Girl :    I really like Olivia Rose,     suggestion: Rose Elizabeth    Boy:    Kayden Michael,     suggestion: Joseph Michael    Good luck !|`|jU80mmJraa	i like Olivia Rose  Elliana Elizabeth    Kiernan Cole  Kayden Micheal|`|hn5rnGgxaa	I love all the names!! I also like how you are using a family name! My favorite though is Sophie Mae. I like them all though!|`|Qp79sBF7aa	Wow, lots of great names.  I especially like Evelyn Julianne, Elliana Elizabeth, Olivia Rose for girls.  I like Charlotte Sarah some, and I like Sophie and Abigail.  Love Audrey Harper too!  For the boys' names, I really like Kieran Cole the best.  I also like Everett Anderson and Logan Daniel.|`|F44b2np9aa	Great names!!!    I LOVE - Evelyn Julianne, Elliana Elizabeth (I would use Rose), Olivia Rose, Sophie Mae. For boys I love Ephram Frederick (cool and sophisticated!), Logan Daniel ( LOVE LOVE LOVE!) and Leland Steven.    All the rest are great too ... good choices. Out of interest should Kiernan be Kieran... but it is great either eay!    Faves - Elliana Rose and Logan Daniel!|`|tsPGVVWcaa	Cohen Marcus, And Of coarse Olivia Rose. Olivia is my name too so it's perfect! lol|`|djuRlggeaa	Girls- Charlotte Sarah & Abigail Macenzie    Boys- Kayden Michael    please answer my latest q called-  I need help with putting a podcast onto my iPod...?|`|2TrHH0rkaa	Girls-  Evelyn Julianne-Evelyn and Julianne are both great names but they both end in the same sounds so they don't sound quite right together. Evelyn Rose would sound nice 7/10  Elliana Elizabeth-Elliana Elizabeth is nice but I'm not the biggest fan of alliteration.Sophie Elizabeth would be pretty 6/10  Olivia Rose-Gorgeous combination 10/10  Charlotte Sarah-Charlotte is very classic and pretty but Sarah is a little plain for me. Charlotte Rose would sound great 7.5/10  Eloise Harlowe-Harlowe Eloise would sound better 4/10  Sophie Mae-Sophie Mae is very pretty 9/10  Abigail Mackenzie-I dislike the name Mackenzie a lot. Abigail is alright although not my favourite name 3/10  Audrey Harper-Great combination 9/10    Boys-  Ephram Frederick(family name)-Even though this is a family name I still don't like it 2/10  Everett Anderson-Everett is great but Anderson sounds more like a last name 5/10  Kiernan Cole-I am unsure on the pronounciation of Kiernan. I am presuming it is Kee-Er-Nen. Cole does flow well with it though 6/10  Cohen Marcus-Cohen is nice although I prefer Mark to Marcus 6.5/10  Kayden Michael-I prefer Kayden spelt Caden. It seems less childish spelt this way. Michael is a nice middle name 7/10  Logan Daniel-Logan Daniel sounds good. May I suggest Lucas Daniel? 8/10  Leland Steven-I'm not so keen on this name 2/10    Hope I help :)
94c4f613fc528ba3897114d516beee90aa	Yeah I would not trust that at all. I was told that too and I am going on two years and I have PCOS with my fertility Dr. Fertility can always give you higher chances of mulitpuls because you are usually forceing your body to ovulate and that means more eggs could release. Good lucky sweeetie  baby dust!|`|9a3sNrEqaa	no see here is the thing!!!! when i saw my regular dr for my paps last year when my hubby and I wanted to have a baby the dr did my paps and some blood work and she was like ohh your all set to get pregnant you have nothing to worry about. TURNS OUT SHE WAS WRONG!!!!!!! I don't ovulate on my own and a simple series of blood tests would have found that. So I would pass months with no period so I went back and she ref me to an OBGYN he did some tests and was like you have amenorrhea and anovulatory cycles. I was shocked cuz here i was cycle after cycle thinking that ohhh maybe I am pregnant and just being devistated!  My OBGYN put me on Clomid @ the end of december I got my period. Then I took another cycle of Clomid january and now I am pregnant! So if I were you I would ask your dr as many ?s as u can think of. Make sure that she does all the testing for ovulation (testing LH and FSH levels ect) So hang in there!!!! Tons of baby dust your way!!!
AA11828439	They weren't even in dire straights. I believe the husband had issues. But prepare for more. This type of thing was common during the "Great Depression". There is and was help available.|`|EayLdDkWaa	yeah :( apparently they had planned it for weeks, taking their kids out of school and everything. 5 kids is a lot of mouths to feed... i'd be overwhelmed too. it offers several lessons for all of us... reach out to your neighbors, save for the future, make sure you have only the number of children that you can reasonably afford, and if you hear about a family losing their jobs maybe offer to have their kids over one night or do something to help relieve the family's pressure. my church started a list of people who were laid off and we do a phone tree to check on them. it really helps to know people care!|`|H0fXySX9aa	im in the uk and there have been a few storied recently just like the link i cant understand how some one could do that innocent lives gone  if you want to take your own life even though its wrong but to take your children's lives is awful|`|oXXFo2ATaa	Yes, i read about it.   it was, so, so, sad.     if it's the one in California then, yes.|`|yBt6OoStaa	I saw that story - very heartbreaking.  Not only for the children but for the parent who felt he had no other options.  It said in the story that someone at the fathers place of work made the suggestion:  you shouldn't have come to work, you should have blowed your brains out.....I truly hope this person can't sleep at night and will be haunted for what he said.  regardless if it made a difference, he had no right saying it to a couple who' dlost  both jobs and had 5 kids at home.    TRAGIC!|`|WyQuDaRyaa	Omg. That is just horrible. It seems to be that they were both extremely depressed, but to the point where you feel you have to kill yourself, AND your children? I read that he wrote "Why leave our children with someone else?" Because they are innocent. That's just heartbreaking. I feel so sad that those children had to loose their lives so young. It goes to show that their are some very sad and sick people in our world.
b165361aa3bdfd3dd4401459ad6b7836aa	Sounds like a great idea.  Very creative.  I would include on the invitation that you will be putting a small amount of make up on the girls for their princess make over and when the parents call to RSVP or when they drop their children off make sure they are okay with that.  Some people are very uptight about their children wearing make up and/or nail polish.  If there is a child that cannot participate in the make overs you could have a coloring page of a princess ready and have the child give the princess on the page a make over with crayons.|`|gpBicBEPaa	mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm...|`|W7dO6uoJaa	yepppp!!!|`|5fyGQ0xjaa	sounds fun , i would have loved it when i was that age|`|1iHfOeNiaa	omg  tht is the most amazing bday party ever :)|`|RhXugkTtaa	yaaa...but mite not wana include ballons...take this advice now b4 its 2 late|`|ade60a82747a7419784d380017a2a656aa	that is soooo cute!!! =D i love it|`|VVJyaQdCaa	I really like this idea! i wish i had a party like that when i was 5 years old! :)|`|TqkJQZvzaa	I WANNA GO! See you there! Seriously it sounds awesome :D|`|8SJl74CQaa	yeah! that's a really good idea! but whats with the christmas lights? its january!|`|m8kF5U84aa	that sounds like an asome party. for a 5 year old my sister she is 9 and she would go nuts for a party like that. im 13 and that sound preety nice.|`|6vLrk12Faa	i love everything except the makeup and nails...i think thats something you should ask the mothers if they are comfortable with. Other than that the day sounds like it will be fabulous and all those little princess' are very lucky =]|`|XUwtAWzkaa	I  think its a good idea besides the waving at cars outside, dont risk loosing and kids or  even worse. And the goody bag should have little junk toys in it and candy not a cupcake since they will already be tired of cake and ice cream.. and they decorated their own cupcake already. But overall im sure its going to be a blast. Have fun !|`|CUq935Xgaa	I think that isd awsome best idea|`|Poht8MR9aa	I would stay away from the make-up and nails, our youth is growing up way to fast as it is and this sends a message about needing to look better by applying make-up.(Because your not already beautiful)  I would do a craft, they love stuff like that and its creative. I actually did a princess party for my daughter who is now 18 when she was little. We always did a craft and it got to be that everyone wondered at looked forward to what are we making at _______ house this year. A good one is go to the craft store you can buy little cardboard boxes in all different shapes we did hearts buy rhinestones beads pearls and let them glue them to the outside of there box),I painted the boxes white first) to keep their princess glitter in or ring or necklace, whatever favor you choose to buy.|`|SxoDVgQ3aa	sounds great  but maybe not dressing like a princess and just fancy because not all kids own a princess gown and you shouldnt stress the parents|`|NwTggQ2Baa	One of my friends has a 6 year old and a 4 year old and they are girls and she just recently had a princess party. She invited girls from 2 to 8. My girls are 2 and they had a blast. I think it is a really great idea because all girls love princesses and this is a way for them to get together and do what THEY like to do.    By the way, she did it where the girls dresses up as their favorite princess and then they could wear a crown if they wanted to.|`|qaD2OqY3aa	Aww! Wow! That sounds like a great Princess Party for 5y/o 's!!     Very Creative! Good Job!|`|p4ijP6ojaa	wow i think that is a gr8 idea! :] you are really smart, when i was five i think i would go crazy happy over that no joke :] lol well have fun :D|`|Elaimr9qaa	WOW, what a lucky girl she is! that sounds great, they'll all have a great time (: x|`|hVq3wKoEaa	Wow! Sounds very good. The only thing that I didnt like was waving at people that is kinda weird. But other than that it looks pretty cool.|`|WRbbpRZzaa	If I were five years old, I would LOVE a [princess] fashion show. Make a small runway, have some fun music and have the girls dress up in whatever they want and announce they're name and what they're wearing. Each one of them will feel like the center of attention and have tons of fun.    ... I wish my mom did that for me when I was younger, however, it's still fun at almost twenty!|`|DBKX29lJaa	it sounds sweet! i'm not crazy about the walking down the sidewalk thing, but hey, if you really want to, go for it.   have fun!|`|SR5zlAl8aa	yess|`|n4d7rqr4aa	Perfect!  Sounds like a fun party that wont destroy your budget|`|fusIwst4aa	Well, i think it would be nice but the makeup is a little too much, i mean they are only five...:)  xoxo, skullprincess|`|Eo4P2s3yaa	That is a great idea!!!  You've got a lot lined up! Remember that when something's not going as planned, just let it run its course. The girls having a good time is the top priority. Have fun!|`|h3LXI1Wvaa	i think that sounds adorable :)|`|IxD8aNHTaa	i like it. except for the makeover part.|`|NBf5q2f5aa	aww thats so cute|`|ZoAC9E0faa	Good for a little girl haha :)|`|bWDi964Maa	Amazing idea, your 5 yr old sweetie will love it.|`|c8UxO6Z1aa	That's what every 'princess' dreams of good for you they'll have a blast unless they don't like princesses that would suck. Good Luck!|`|40whdSDYaa	AMAZING FOR A 5 yR OLD PARTY...THEY WILL LOVE IT.....just make sure u have amazing cleaning skills and wont be lazy at the end cuz ur guna have ALOT of cleaning to do bahaha =]
zU56eOCNaa	it could be a phantom pregnancy. where the body thinks its pregnant and does all the pregnancy things, but there isn't actually a baby there. it sounds a little silly but my dog went through the same thing. her stomach expanded, her body showed all the signs that she was expecting, milk and everything, then when she was scanned, there were no babies. the vet said it was called a phantom pregnancy  hope this helped! :) x|`|iwYu32N2aa	well she looks kinda big for only being 12 weeks. But I have no idea why, her doc would have a better answer then any of us.|`|KOdLWJaQaa	Has the dr checked for an ectopic pregnancy?|`|a8c1ec2782f2cbb1944ac1b3fd537fa6aa	I've never heard anything like it!  What did the doctor say?|`|VQCKjEacaa	if shes showing that much at ten weeks pregnant when the baby is the size of a thumb maybe idk thats crazzy maybe gas is making her fat.. but there is no way she could be pregnant  if she is ten weeks and that big.. sorry        it showed i was pregnant in my blood when i was no it will happen .|`|Kp8ijsmOaa	Hmm if I was her I'd go get a private 4D scan done for about 150 .    Maybe her dates are wrong?? God knows. Weird.    Starred as i'd like to keep up with what happens. Keep us posted.|`|sgMno1PRaa	couldnt it be where she didnt pee and visibility was bad? Wee and Poo and Having a full stomach can all effect the visibility on the scan.|`|d1d69552298a20d3a6e2cac725baf7b6aa	I have a friend who is going through this right now, basically her egg implanted, it may or may not have been fertilized.  Because it implants her body goes through the motions of pregnancy even though there is no baby.  Eventually the egg will let go and she will pass it and her symptoms should go away.|`|3KPGLTbRaa	possible phantom pregnancy?|`|VbkJ9Tucaa	It could be a blighted ovum but there should still be a sac. She's gonna have to get more information on that one.

FSY30gbvaa	Even with a IUD you can get pregnant. If you feel you are pregnant, or could be call your dr, get the blood work. I know from experience, I NEVER test positive on urine tests|`|u7kDLuklaa	You cannot feel quickening if you are not pregnant.  Quickening is feeling the baby move.  If there is no baby .. there is obviously no quickening.    Do you know how an IUD works?  An egg could be fertilized every month but cannot attach to the lining of the uterus.  Technically a baby is made .. but shed routinely.  Some people are against this type of birth control and consider it abortion.|`|oojO4WAraa	No.  Quickening is movement from the baby. If your not pregnant yo won't feel that.|`|WuVW9uCAaa	no u cant u have to be pregnant|`|0fe4f3702c5dd1a403524194d3e9fabdaa	"quickening" is the baby moving so if your not pregnant how could you feel a baby move??? And what is "not really pregnant" ? Either your pregnant or your not.

AA11763588	If this is your first, probably not. It would be baby bloat.    All women are different, but most start to show a bump around 20 weeks, some a little earlier, some a little later.    If this is your 2nd, 3rd, ect... then yes, it's possible. This is my 3rd and I started showing around 11 weeks.|`|mY19PPlIaa	I think it would be too early, your probably just bloated. Try to cut back on salty foods and drink plenty of water, if this doesnt make a difference then maybe your showing already.|`|lry4ncIBaa	it is possible. my mum said she was showing at 6 weeks with my brother!!|`|zk3Bp9uNaa	I started to show at 8weeks - so its very possible!!!  Alot of people on here will tell you it impossible and its only bloating - but with me, my Dr was even shocked at how much i was showing!! Its possible.    Enjoy your baby bump - be proud of it, its beautiful!|`|WaU0hmD5aa	it's too early you are just bloated|`|AA11488344	While this is possible there are many factors to consider. First is your height and weight. Second is what pregnancy number this is. Typically taller women will show later as will women who are expecting their first one. More likely than not, you are not showing yet.|`|4D1VEKW5aa	Bloating since its not there in the morning.|`|AsICkz9naa	Yes you could be starting to show. It is around this time that your waist starts to thicken. This is especially the case if you are pregnant with your first child and were slim prior to becoming pregnant.|`|vfq04nc1aa	HI  Its definetly possible because im 14 weeks pregnant at the moment and i definetly look pregnant.  At about 10 weeks i had a slight bump but not as big as now.  Im quite skinny and petitie and i read that if your skinny then you tend to show earlier. I havent gained much weight at all. Only about 2 pounds. My stomach used to be falt in the morning too but now its not and by the end of the day its huge!  But i really think pregnancy is a beautiful thing. A baby bump looks so gorgeous!  Congrats and Take care!!

hKJIDdVqaa	here is an idea, an online baby shower, you could pick the things you need or want at places like babies r us, or amazon.  You create a wish list, they buy and ship it directly to you.  Congratulations|`|iwYu32N2aa	Well has your family offered to help? I think that it would be kinda rude just sending family members a list f things that you need for your baby. But if they have agreed , then a list would work|`|TexOmGk3aa	Generally you only get one baby shower. Sometimes, when there's a huge age difference between babies, about 6 or 8 years or something, they're given another shower but usually you only get one.|`|Cv0bGFiCaa	There really is no tactful way to send out a list of things that you need.  Its rude and presumptous to do so.  Although, I see your point of not having a baby shower it still poor etiquette.      I would suggest registering and then if anyone asks you what you need you can direct them to your registry.|`|vrHeGvy2aa	Why not an online shower?  Have your parents or another close family member pass the word along so you don't feel so uncomfortable with the idea.  I think it would be completely appropriate.|`|7HGKJYenaa	I don't have children but I think it is silly that you only get one baby shower, every baby needs stuff :)  I don't know a tactful way to send a "wish list", but I agree that you could register at a couple of places.  That way if someone were looking they would know what you needed.  If you have a close group of friends maybe you could plan a small get together or lunch before the baby comes and see what happens???  Good luck.|`|e244e3cc9bea9e179101e1572c38086baa	I liked the webcam baby shower idea...but the question would still remain will someone offer to throw you one.Do you have any friends in your area that could throw you a diaper party? Instead of gifts they bring diapers...I believe every child deserves a celebration into this world(totally disagree with the one shower idea)...good luck!

AsICkz9naa	So far you have gained 17 pounds. In the first trimester you should only gain a few pounds say a half stone or less. That sounds a healthy weight gain. Up until 28 weeks ( from about 14 weeks onwards) you should gain half a pound a week  and  from 28 weeks until you reach about 37 weeks you can expect to gain 1 pound in weight per week as your baby grows rapidly in the third trimester. In fact to me your weight gain sounds absolutely textbook perfect. Pregnant mothers are expected to gain 2 to 3 stones during pregnancy. It depends too on your body shape, frame and how much fluids you are carrying around. When you give birth expect to loose about 1 stone immediately.|`|54cf275d0238f8dd4d90351c9a055b00aa	Yes you will still gain more in your third trimester, the last month of pregnancy is when your baby will gain the most weight. I am 33 weeks pregnant and I have gained around 20 pounds so far. Dont worry though as long as your doctor isnt concerned about your weight gain then you shouldnt be.|`|H9AlDTZOaa	im sure all the weight is going straight to your boobs!|`|780ByZVEaa	i gained 50 my friend gained 100.  You have gained nothing yet you are alouwd to gain up to 30 and you where skinny so i even think you alouwd to do 40.  You seem to be on a good schedule|`|eHow24rNaa	some women gain 50 lbs when pregnant....some gain only 10 lbs. It all depends on the woman and child. I was about 125 when i got pregnant and i lost 12 after my surgery when i was 5mths pregnant to cut out a cyst i had that was like 2lbs i believe. I ended up gaining the weight back and ended up at 136 at the end. So its normal to only have gained 17 lbs...you'll gain a little more im sure but its okay....dont starve yourself b/c thats only hurting your baby. Just whenever you have the baby and after your 6 wks recovery, then start working out and eating right to get back to 103|`|9Jnf5jRQaa	I believe  you gain most of your weight in the second trimester.  If your dr. didn't seem concerned, I wouldn't worry about it.  But try your best to keep it down (or at least stable) this next trimester.  It will be harder to get off if you don't.  By the time I gave birth, I gained 27 lbs.  I did a lot of walking by the end of my pregnancy when I was home on maternity leave.|`|52U22fiAaa	Since you were so light at the beginning of your pregnancy, then you're doing fine.  You can gain more since you are thin.  If you were 250 pounds pre pregnancy then you wouldn't be able to gain as much due to health concerns.    In my first pregnancy, I gained 50 pounds, in my second I've gained only a 3 pounds and I'm 22 weeks.     You're doing good!  Just be sure to take a walk everyday and eat well.  Good luck.|`|WaU0hmD5aa	no you are fine at that weight you will gain a little more b/c the baby will get bigger so don't worry you will not gain too much more weight unless you just pig out on the wrong foods|`|YqeatZB4aa	No, you are going to gain a lot of weight, you have the weight of the baby plus the placenta plus the fluid. SO gaining that kind of weight is normal.|`|43942bc50710c4456dc14871795e132baa	I weight 115 when I got pregnant, and I got up to 178 but my doctor told me it was a healthy weight for me because I had a lot of water. Also she told me that with the first baby most women gain quite a bit more. You're definitely not gaining too much weight. You are fine. With all the extra stuff going in there (water, the placenta, and the baby) you should figure you'll gain quite a bit. Plus when women become pregnant our bodies store more fat, in order to sustain the health of ourselves and the baby, and to help get ready for milk production. 17 pounds is not bad, you are fine. Good luck and congratulations.|`|fsHgUrcAaa	I gained 25 lbs during my pregnancy.  During your third trimester, you should be gaining about 1 lb a week and at this point, you seem like you could actually stand to gain a little more.  I was up to 150 at the time I gave birth and miraculously lost it all within the first 6 weeks after my daughter was born.|`|8zNhcdpjaa	My dr told me she wanted me to gain approx 25lbs.  The more you gain, the more you have to take off. Being you were pretty thin, I wouldn't worry too much.  I gained almost 40 with my first, 12 with my second, and 15 with my third.  All three babies were w/in 1/2 ounce of each other.  I exercised through both my second and third pregnancy, and I think that was the difference.  I also ate a lot more healthy with my third since I was 32--only 18 with my first and 20 with my second.  You will definitely gain in the third trimester--I think is is around 1 pound a week for the last month on average.|`|Fx77zYhWaa	I'm guessing you're pretty slim if you started out at 103 unless you're really short.  It's probably fine unless your doctor says something.  You might gain another 17 pounds by the time it's all over.

Jasmine is pretty, Faith is okay.  And why Kelly?  I'd pick something that goes better with Jasmine, maybe do Jasmine Faith.  And then pick another name to go with Kelly, like Peyton Kelly.|`|nW7hMqcVaa	Congrats on Twin Girls, what a blessing!  -personally, im not a big fan of the middle name kelly, idk it reminds me of jelly... lol. idk why..   -as for Faith and Jasmine i like them both.. they arent too twin-ish, which im assuming is why you want to give them matching middle names.. i think that is a really good idea... i dont like giving suggestions and changing other peoples choice names but what about: Faith marie, and Jasmine Marie, Faith Rose and Jasmine Rose, Faith Mae and Jasmine Mae, Faith Ava and Jasmine Ava, Faith Keeley and Jasmine Keeley, Faith Bellarae and Jasmine Bellarae..  idk, iim not even sure i like some of those, but whatever you do choose, im sure you will love, those girls will be your life, no matter what their names are.  Good Luck!|`|ByWRzuuraa	Same as 1st answer.  Faith & Hope are nice.  I hate the name Kelly, Especially for both of the middle names.  & Im not too keen on Jasmine either.  What about..  Kelsey.  Grace.  Amelia.  Chelsea.  Chloe.  Poppy.  Marie.  Esther.  Esmee.    Something like Faith Amelia & Hope Marie would go nice :)  x|`|Org2hdfUaa	Beautiful!     Faith Charlotte Kelly and Jasmine Elizabeth Kelly are adorable!!     =)    X|`|a3uzlOAYaa	love it|`|XKoPyRsAaa	I like it buy maybe you should switch it up like Jasmine Kelly & Kelly Faith. It is just a suggestion but if you dont like that then stick with the names you have ! : )|`|GuFwv7Vzaa	I like...  But I would put Faith Kelly and Hope Kelly... It would be very beautiful =) Good luck and congratulations!
382b69da7c50fc8ccf68048ab522a879aa	I usually do 1 - 2 loads a day. 1 full one of colours and then another of either reds, jeans, delicates or whatever has accumulated the most.  You? Hmmmmm, well, I know I have heaps of washing for 3 boys, so 5??? I'm saying you do 3 loads a day.  Happy washing!!|`|xPgKWIigaa	i do one - sometimes 2 if  i have my sister and her botfriend stay over - which seems to be alot lately - plus i only have a tiny washing machine - God knows what i was thinking when i bought it - not thinking that i was havin twins - thats for sure!!  I'm guessing you at least do as much as me possible 3 loads?|`|5p7gpj36aa	Usually - 1 or 2 loads per day and then big things like blankets and sheets on saturday along with whatever washing is left.   BUT  my dryer just broke and so I go to a friends house 2x a week and do 1 or two loads (whatever there is time for)  and then the rest at the laundry mart on the weekend.    ... I had two extra kids living with me for a while (and occasionally their mother)  and with the extra two it was definitely four loads (one was a baby and spittled all the time!)      As for you -- four maybe five?    Do you reuse your towels more than once?  and PJ's more than once?  what about jeans? (considering they aren't soiled)  Some people do and some would never,  it makes a big difference.|`|XPnCeJ29aa	I do none a day.  And about one a week.    Mine and Brodys'. ANd I wear a uniform everyday to work that was issued, so that cuts down my clothes, and his clothes are miniature.    I'd say you, Miss Charli do......ehh at LEAST 37.  no jk lol  Idk 3?|`|HI0GitEYaa	I do about four a week.    I have no idea how many you do?|`|7e700825133cf6328b412b5715dc6692aa	i do up too three a week ..its drying it here its freezing !|`|U67DfN5naa	I would say about 5-7 a week, I do it all at once and that is for five people. I don't know how many people you have in your family but I might guess around six.|`|TlA2z5XJaa	Today = 0  And tomorrow I will be paying for it as I will have to do about 5|`|ZBc16tOvaa	i have 7 kids plus my sisters 4 and then 3 adults so the machine runs all day we do around 6 loads|`|AA10811784	I save laundry for the weekends. There's no time during the week, unfortunately. (Well, there would be if my husband decided to help once in a while... he gets home before I do.) So, I do about 6-7 loads per week. Ask me again in a few weeks though. lol|`|oP504BtFaa	I love laundry...it's my guilty pleasure. I could probably get by with two loads a day (four thirteen year olds...it's necessary!) but I'll do maybe three. I also only fold clothes when they're warm, so if something's sat in the dryer too long, I'll pop it on again. I know, I know - so bad for the environment, but I can't help it...I love laundry!!    I think you do...maybe 1 a day. Am I right?|`|vKYdV5r2aa	I wash cloths once a month weather i need to or not !!!!!|`|s6emVQleaa	I hate doing laundry so I save it up and do about 10 big loads every couple of weeks.  I don't create a lot of laundry and neither does my husband and Ellie's doesn't require much so I can get away with it.  With your household- I'm going to guess at least two loads a day.|`|s8VgyzE2aa	We are a family of 6 and I do about two loads a day but I am also a freak about certain things. The towels have to be washed separate, darks and whites separate, etc...some things have to be hung to dry like the kids shirts so they don't shrink.     I would guess you do about 4 loads a day assuming you do it daily.|`|471ca0c8552c4633e525815ba702310aaa	I do 1 load every other day. I have a super capacity front loading washer, so I can cram a lot in there.    I think you do 2-3 loads a day, unless you're in a water restricted area. If so then I guess 1 a day.|`|um29wkUPaa	2 a day if I bother to separate whites, colors and delicates.  I save delicates for when I get enough to justify the water.      You're on a farm, work in a vet office and have five boys, two of whom still spit up.  And you're a neat freak (this will come as a surprise to some I'm sure.)    You do four loads easy.  Probably more like 6.|`|cUfOnldzaa	None, ever.  It's my husbands job.|`|3dSCbIcEaa	i do at least 2-3, sometimes 4.  u prob. do about the same?|`|gxL9qeTyaa	I do usually at least one a day..theirs 4 of us plus I babysit for a living...so usually at least 7+ a week!    I am guessing you do 2 a day?!?!|`|61eadcf38f72b14203ed398198796d52aa	I do about 3 loads a week between myself and my daughter.  My husband is an anal freak who folds his socks and underwear and insists on doing his own laundry.  Not that I complain - that's 2 more loads a week that I don't have to do.  In the summer, we do about 3 loads total per week - it's too cold here obviously.  I tend to do all laundry on the weekend, so I am not doing laundry every day.    As for you, I'm betting it's a lot :D  I'll guess 4 a day.
54cf275d0238f8dd4d90351c9a055b00aa	It sounds like your body is just getting ready for labor. I dont think it is anything to be concerned about.|`|h3LXI1Wvaa	maybe you should just put in a call to the doctor, it wouldn't hurt.|`|WuVW9uCAaa	it could be the start of labor|`|3Rr5SAhhaa	its probably braxton hicks, or just your body strecthing, getting ready for delivery.|`|ZTXXdXrdaa	when my sister was pregnant she called my mom with this exact question.  turned out to be the start of her labor.  she had the baby a few hours later|`|AA11284789	I have had that too.....I went to doc yesterday he said its my uterus stretching and baby dropping
9EdJHqKHaa	There is a theory that claims the boy will eventually take on the same attributes, becoming controlling in further relationships (whether they be romantic, friendships, etc). However, there are cases where the boy will eventually become withdrawn and passive in future relationships. It could go either way, depending on the person.|`|XU5SVQZDaa	I think they learn to do the same with their families. Or, they have suffered under that rule-and, vow to never do the same to their families. People can choose to learn from bad behavior and be better..or..bitter, hold grudges and torment others with like treatment. You can't blame your parents for your actions for very long at all. They have to break out of any mental trap the father is trying to put them in for life-that they are not o.k. Thats why my brother moved off to Alaska to become a bush pilot-35yrs ago, to get rid of our parents-our Dad called on the phone and visited him-only once in a great while. Everyone who lives in that state gets an oil dividend check every year-this last year it was over $2000-man, woman and child. If you can stand the cold-move there.|`|o0mwF5kFaa	They get power complexes, and they become angry, and may become controlling themselves, due to their insecurity, and lack of feeling of control in life.    I have a foolish, angry, controling father. The difference is that I'm extremely intelligent and I am VERY good at social anlysis. Not only that, but I' also very good at fighting, so the feelings of being repressed or powerless are much weaker in me, I just choose not to hit my father, although he still play mr MAn for me at 17. It's really annoying, but I'm going to tough it out.    I have nothing to be insecure about: I'm good looking and girls tell me so, I'm strong, I'm black, so I have an 8.12" ruler, and I make friends easily. I also am very intelligent, so I'm doign well inschool, and everything.    I WON'T end up a failure like him. I WON'T be an angry loser who's afraid everyone can see his weakness. Who pushes his family away so he can feel like the fear they feel is his power over them. I won't be distant form my wife and my family. I will LOVE my wife till she can't take it anymor ena dthen love her some more.    I wILL break his influence over me by making sure I have a goo conscience and so his image won't haunt me, and 'll be able to be different.    Wish me luck :)    ==|`|N0VI2D59aa	They end up having a hard time making decisions because they fear that no matter what, it will never be good enough.|`|8AaPQONGaa	they kick the dads ***.  or die  or never get laid|`|338dc31e30bc04bf0dd83a9f7bb71d3eaa	In my brother's case, he has learned to be the same.   He plays mind games, and is very critical and judgmental.   The worst part was, my father was also violent, and thus, my brother is too.     Sometimes they can learn to not be that way, but, in my case, I almost can't see that being possible.|`|WBpVZpb0aa	Usually they grow up feeling like the pressure is on them to succeed, and will end up not only resenting their father, but probably cause depression over the years. You'd be suprised how the human brain deals with events like that in your life.  They tend to do that to their kids as well, [But not always, gross generality]|`|627093e705eb3f94176967dc4bc9cc35aa	Both my boyfriend and my best guy friend have really controlling fathers.  They are both really successful, because of the pressure that their dads have put on them, but at the same time they hate their dads.  I also get the sense that they both try really hard to get others approval, which is not great for their self esteem.. Also, they both swear never to be like their fathers.  However, I do know guys who end up exactly like their controlling fathers.|`|Ug3zSqTQaa	well if you say to a child you cant have chocolate and they never do when they get to an age where they can get it themselves from a shop then they will over do it and buy chocolate all the time   also if  you criticize there decisions they will never feel like they get anything right and might be miserable  you have to have balance  x|`|VwMkiLFPaa	I am a woman and I had a VERY controlling father. He belittled us, screamed at us, would embarrass us in public. He wanted things done a certain way in our home and if they werent done HIS way, youd certainly pay the price of that.     What happened to me because of it?    Well Im still alive and breathing so I obviously didnt kill myself, (MORON). Im very sensitive and despise confrontation, not sure if thats associated with my father being a controlling scumbag. But I never married a man like my father, like most people tend to believe. And I didnt let my fathers evil ways consume me and control my life, now that Im an adult. Because Im an adult, I can choose for myself who to keep in my life and who to turn loose. So when someone mistreats me or does as my father did.theres the door!|`|avVdKiWKaa	They may turn out insecure and not have the requisite confidence to get ahead and manage things in their adult life.  It is impossible to generalize.  There have been some great leaders that had controlling parents, and also some murderers.  Of the latter, some even went so far as to murder their parents.  You can never tell.  The flip side of that coin is the spoiled rotten brats that get their way all the time thanks to permissive parents and grow up unable to cope when things don't go their way.|`|VS8mactUaa	It usually causes them to lash out, due to the feeling of dis respect and failure, well it can anyway, everybody is different. :)|`|fhyYh3Dzaa	They have issues with authority and low self esteem and confidence. The boy could also grow up to be controlling himself thinking that that is the only way to get respect.|`|WwXrTQgaaa	They turn into critical, know-it-all jerks who no one can stand to be around.    Seriously, seen it happen.|`|KA4jmUoMaa	They become afraid of their fathers and develope low self esteem.|`|CI3PEjOTaa	I think it has a different effect on everyone|`|8SKpsVG7aa	they beat up women|`|HQKuzxulaa	they grow up to be the complete opposite.|`|Tv8cuXmtaa	Hey that describes me  Well i am violent, short fused, full of hate  and worst of all I am becoming like him  i am actually afraid to get into a relationship because i might hurt the women i am with.|`|oOfD9HFBaa	one of my friends has an a$$h0le dad and his dad is reallly controlling, and its really effected him. i have a feeling he is going to be the same controlling way towards his kids.. if he decides to have kids|`|60ApQsGOaa	in all sincerity, they become rebellious. I have plenty of friends who aren't really striving for the best goals in life and i kind of made the connection with their father. They've said that they weren't ever good enough for their dad, or their dad kept trying to tell them how to live their lives. If you are the father - loosen up. For real. Let him make mistakes...otherwise he will never learn. If you are the son - talk to your dad and tell him the deal. Either of you - realize it's YOUR life. Not someone else's. You can't live your life and tell someone else how to live theirs either. regardless if they are related or not. Good luck.|`|7EiWSuPLaa	they either get out of his web when the finish school, or as a friend i met in prison said  my father tried to control me about my drinking so i got a gun and shot him dead at the dinner table|`|sVdQSMvJaa	My husband's father was critical and controlling and abusive all of my husband's life.  He grew up trying to please his father by joining the marines (just as his father had) and then becoming a cop (just as his father had).  My husband can be controlling.  He and his father have NO relationship.  We've been together 3 1/2 years and have a 10 month old daughter.  He's not met either one of us.    Too bad for him.|`|XLsnuAqmaa	they kill themselves|`|QYbMxFE0aa	The worst thing that could happen.. They become the same person.|`|qMhLcn8Gaa	They become gay in a rebellious fit of rage, then get AIDS and die.|`|vIeqLcFmaa	Actually, once they break free most of them turn gay. No kidding!|`|9BEg5s2Oaa	i dont like to say it but a lot of suicides are due to young men or teenage boys being pressurized by their fathers.|`|dPi7zMxWaa	They rebel really bad same with girls.|`|sbLqPIyoaa	Sometimes it's different. Some guys, when they leave home, will make sure that they're never like their father and become a better person, some will probably end up being just like that, or some will think that they're not good at anything and that nobody likes them, etc. I guess it all depends!|`|rGip5hMEaa	they try not to do the same thing with thier kids or relationship,but most of the time they fail.|`|HZvo9YFHaa	they usually end up like their fathers but if you try hard and learn to trust then they would be fine.|`|F6iExAKvaa	they can grow up just like their fathers and also with much Insecurity in everything.|`|NxNrZksXaa	these are some possibilities:  *they may grow up always trying to seek their father's aprroval or earn his acknowlegemnt/recognition  *may pick up the same habits and enforce the same thing with their gf, spouse, and/or children  *they may think everyone else thinks that same way about them that their father does (even if someone repeatedly tells them otherwise)  *feel pressured throughout life to prove themselves  *could cause emotional damage and even thoughts of suicide b/c he would feel like he has no worth   *could confuse his gender thoughts|`|TpjGEguEaa	They grow long girlish hair, and move out to Istanbul.

Before you confront anyone, take her to the doctor. Tell him about the behavoir she is showing and tell him your concerns.  I pormise they have dealt with this before and can probably figure out if something illegal has happened.      I wish you the best of luck.|`|UVUYG5jaaa	get one of those secret nanny-cams, somethings fishy|`|4cc767b496173b3227cf5f9f17efd2b5aa	These kinds of suspicions should motivate you to take your daughter to a doctor *immediately.*|`|3X0t8JrXaa	You have to be cautious so I totally understand why you're concerned.  You should never turn your head the other way because its an uncomfortable situation, always continue to put your daughter first.  Personally I may take her to a doctor to be sure that everything is okay.  What if your babysitter starts to feel that you'll notice (if in fact something is going on) and points the finger at you!  Definately stop taking your daughter to this babysitter until you know that everything is okay and have a doctor take a look at her.|`|mAPSl0DZaa	Take her to the Dr and express your concerns.|`|zEYjJ7Xhaa	find a new babysitter and get her some counseling.  it sounds like something has been going on when you are gone.    why would you be sorry you are concerned?|`|3Rr5SAhhaa	definitly talk to the babysitter, and dont leave her there anymore, shes obviously seen or had something happen to have her act like that.|`|9979bb6f0e03a8d3d1be61eab96d087daa	Before you jump to conclusions of sexual abuse - does your little girl get a bath while there?  If so, the sitter may be using a soap that your little girl cannot tolerate - same goes for toilet paper or wipes - they may be scented or have lotion added.   Little girls have sensitive areas and if she is used to the same products while at home, then when she goes somewhere that uses different stuff, irritation of the area can occur.      Ask your sitter what products she uses, explain to her that your little girl seems irritated down there and you wanted to check to make sure she wasn't having a reaction to something. (if  nothing else, this lets the sitter know that you're on to her (incase) something else is going on)    If it persists - see a doctor, she may have an infection.|`|f1c3e4fed0bc8c4bf3636c69cd65cebfaa	Get a new sitter. If the behavior is restricted to a time period after she spends time with them, I'd be concerned.  Talk with her doctor, she what the doctor suggests.  But certainly get a new sitter. She is red and irritated at all?  Talking to the sitter may prove helpful, but most likely, it will just cause you undo problems. Nip it in the bud and keep your daughter out of the situation.|`|HZvo9YFHaa	could be! i take it she doesnt talk!? well you can take her in to the dr. they know what the size of her vagina should be and if it is different( more open) then press charges!! good luck, hun. kick there butts!|`|IA5zVfk0aa	my friend put little cameras in her living room, her daughters bathroom and the nursery. theyre little cameras the size of a thumb tac and wired it to a little screen and they watched from a neighbors house to see if anything would happen. i would take her to the dr. and see if anything is wrong and if saw you could do that if you like and then have it as proof|`|a1uoxczTaa	i would ask the babysitter, and i definitely wouldnt keep using her as a sitter.|`|sJ92L6cjaa	UUUUHHHH I would definitly not use the same babysitter again....Duh!!

I would stop immediately using that babysitter. Take the child to the Dr for an evaluation. The Dr can tell you if she is being abused. Go from there. Don't accuse anyone of anything until you know for sure. Do you actually think your husband could be doing something?   Act on this- your little girl can't speak up for herself, so it's up to you.|`|RmSzWzbsaa	yes be concerned and dont use that sitter again|`|RiGSq1r6aa	I would be concerned too. I can't be sure but it can be something is wrong with her. Maybe you should tell the doctor about it or keep her at home for a while and see if she still does it after a while.

Have you tried talking to your daughter? Ask her easy questions if you feel someone has done something to your daughter.
Ij2rM3H4aa	I think a lot has to do with your temperment normally (ie, when you're not pregnant).  When I was pregnant I was basically a loose cannon during my first trimester, and I consider myself quite even keeled and kind to most people.  Everything settled down around 14-15 weeks, so hang in there, you'll start feeling like yourself again soon.|`|no9N3zjMaa	Everyone is different I haven't had any mood swing till now  and it started in my 3rd trimester! Congrats and good luck to you|`|3X0t8JrXaa	They'll get better.  Its partly the hormones and partly the changes you're going thru...apetite or loss of, fatigue, anxiety and so on.  For me I couldn't stand myself...so I slept a lot.  I'm at 15 weeks now and I'm a little better.  You're hormones are supposed to get better by week 12 but for me I didn't stop the evilness until maybe the last week or so.  I'm still bossy but I was like the Exorcist!|`|qGQCLFinaa	You need to tell him that you can't control yourself & he needs to stick it out with you if he honestly loves you, you both need to give & get space when you start to get upset, my fiance is a "manly man" he's not very emotional & when i cry he it doesn't seem to bother him much,  He would get frustrated with me because i would always say "quit being so mean to me" and he really wasn't being mean I was just over sensitive,  he would go hang out with a friend for a little while, or he would go outside to smoke, I usually go to my room & sit on the bed, and try to calm down, I read a magazine or book, & when i feel better i come out & don't talk to him for a while & it usually works out!   We're trying to get pregnant again & he always jokes with me about whether or not he can handle me again!  But i'm going to try my best to take a break when i need it.  But he also needs to be a little more understanding, especially if this is your first time, you're completely confused with what's going on & you can't control your emotions.  Good Luck!

I totally understand.  I find myself yelling and being rude to some people on here but thats only because I am annoyed with the exact same "AM I PREGNANT" question.  I cried 2 weeks ago because I wanted  taco from taco bell soo badly and my husband said it was too late!!!  Jerk...he felt bad and go it anyway and I later caught him on here looking up pregnancy hormone symptoms.  I get annoyed very easily and have been tending to lose my temper more often.  I realy dont mean too and anyone that knows me knows that I am typically a layed back person.  Oh well I like having an excuse though...lol...|`|3Oiwh3Ivaa	It gets better after the first trimester. I told my husband to just leave me alone to avoid conflict. He says I have a bad attitude and really he don't understand anything about hormones and all that.

Like when I left the Desitin cream on the floor, he crawled over to it and put it in his mouth (it was closed, don't worry). Or when my fiance leaves his magazines on the floor, he eats them. He will crawl past his toys just to get to the "forbidden" items. I don't know how recognizes that it isn't supposed to be there!|`|qdLdcR8Maa	my 9 month old when hes finished his juice in his tippy cup stands up in his cot and bangs on the wall with it shouting dada! made me laugh! ha     He aslso has got 2 teeth and getting the top four so is intrested to see whats in my mouth and shows this by trying to put his hand in there! lol    He THROWS himself backwards and pretend cries when you tell him NO  throws a mini fake fit, when you look at him bcus u no hes pretending he laughs!    Oh and he can do that raising of one eye brow thing to! like the rock. so so so funny!|`|r7q8LW7Aaa	My 3 month old puts her hand in my mouth - pretty much her whole hand.  At least it reminds me to trim her nails!|`|o2YHnKXiaa	Well my son has a habit on grabbing on my ears when he is standing on my lap and trying to hold on while he jumps up and down. He also tries to grab my nose and my lips.|`|oXzHvsBpaa	My son has a few. He gives you the biggest smile right before he spits up. Also lately he has "arguments" with his Fisher Price Aquirum when it won't turn on.

She likes to pull her hair in the back when she is nursing.  I've heard of this before, but it still gets to me when she does it.|`|Xf8Z6rJfaa	lol i don't have any kids but when my brother was a baby he use to bite my mom's nose too!!    haha it's funny to see that he's not the only one who did this =]|`|5EiShLZZaa	My son is a hair twirler when he gets sleepy...he twirls his own, he twirls mine, who's ever hair he can get to!!  Last week at a play date, his little friend Spencer came to me and said "baby Owen won't quit messing my hair up"...I was unsure of the issue, so I watched from the corner and every time Spencer sat down to play, Owen came up behind him, put him in a head lock, and started twirling his hair!  To make it even more silly, he hums while he twirls...that's a real man for you!! My sweet boy!|`|4Bgw5xs8aa	My baby's only 2 1/2 months, so none yet...but when my little cousin was like 1 1/2 he LOVED putting toys in your drink when you weren't looking.

It's almost like she's saying "What?" with her little head. It's too cute. She reminds me of a little puppy when she does it. She just started doing this about 3 weeks ago. She also twirls her hair with her fingers when she's really sleepy.|`|OPloDbxvaa	my 4 month old has starting growling when he wants to be pick up ..grrrrrrrrr , and he does like a dog ..he sniffs fast with is little nose all shruged lmao its funny     congrats on ur baby and enjoy|`|AejHsnupaa	my son sticks anything in his mouth and know even when he has food in it.and i have to clean him up.|`|9QVjNaIPaa	trying to put his fingers in your mouth! and if we lay a blanket out on the floor he always goes to lay down on it and he puts his head down rubs his face on it. he smiles like its one of the best feelings in the world, its so cute how he does it. and he loves to dance...he can be in the other room and if he hears us turn the music on he comes running in and starts clapping his hands and bouncing up and down. then he gets this curious look on his face like 'wheres that coming from' and he goes looking for it. he tries to open cupboards and stuff looking for whats making the noise. he's 10 months...|`|xy0W50Lqaa	Ah where do I start...well, My 11 month old has fazes of biting down on me while I'm feeding her, I say no and she just gives me a cheeky smile.  Here's the one that worries me: she has this habit of forcing herself to cough and goes red in the face or under her eyes go red, I really don't like it when she does this and again doesn't listen to the reply of "No stop that" so I have to distract her with something to play with.|`|p2Njf5gBaa	I don't know if this is unusual but my son loves to stick his fingers in my mouth and feel my teeth.  He just recently discovered my nose and has been trying to stick his fingers up there..... yucky....lol!|`|wMh38OzVaa	Talk to your baby's doc. about this.She maybe able to tell you how to fix that.My youngest kid always tried to pull on my beard and mustache when she was a baby.I finally shaved just to stop her.|`|pXSKSS3daa	Yes, and we have NO idea where it came from. He clinches his little fists up and scrunches his face up if someone new is talking to him or if he's really excited.|`|ivhojwpTaa	My twins (now 2) used to fist-fight when they were 3 months old. I mean they punched the daylight out of each other, then they would fall asleep cuddling like the best of friends!    They're identical twin girls.
e90a8e2ee095e648a3f92f15f7959eb6aa	Sounds like me at 9 weeks.  At 6 weeks and 9 weeks I had ultrasounds because I had bleeding and passed some clots after sex, but both times the baby was ok.  The doctor just said I have an extremely sensitive cervix. The hubby and I just laid off the intercourse (neither one of us could take the scare of bleeding) and so far at 31 weeks I haven't bled since.  It's also normal to not be able to hear the heartbeat yet.    Just stay calm and wait.  I'm sure at your next appointment you'll hear a strong little heartbeat.|`|Bw1h5xAcaa	Relax, and try not to overanalyze every little thing. It's normal to have urinary frequency in the early weeks, but call your doctor and ask them to run a culture to rule out a UTI.     Spotting is also normal, especially after sex.    It's also normal not to hear a heartbeat until usually 11-12 weeks minimum because the baby is too low in the pelvis.     If it was ectopic, your tube would have ruptured several weeks ago, because by now at 9 weeks the baby would be at least a centimeter long and the fallopian tube in no way could stretch to accomodate that.    Unless you are having cramping and bleeding that is more than spotting, there is really nothing to worry about - your perception might be that the ER was rude, but they are right.|`|uuHPneEcaa	its nothing u are okay. Everything is fine. that is normal.. I got a yeast infection after having sex.. and I made sure i was clean and dry always. ur okay I am 27 weeks pregnant.    I eat constantly.. I swear at first I could eat EVERYTHING then it was like I didn't wanna eat anything at all.. Now I am back to eating everything and more. I can't wear my clothes anymore but I have only gained 26 pounds..|`|sBHhnDwaaa	If its not a large amount AND its after sex, don't worry!     If its ever a large amount and bright red, go to the ER lol. I think by 9 weeks if it was ectopic you would have known and had problems by now.|`|iwYu32N2aa	calm down, from what you are saying every thing is fine. No need to stress yourself out for nothing|`|fJ9gJ1ttaa	if it was ectopic or something like that, it would have been more blood for several days.    My doctor told me that it was normal for light spotting......as long as i wasn't hurting so bad that i couldn't stand up straight.    I am sure that you are fine....and congrats..........i am in my 10th week.|`|Xt1LxiWAaa	Don't worry! That is very common in pregnancy, especially after you have sex. I was spotting around that time too, and I called my doctor because I was so worried...they got me in and did an ultrasound (we had to make sure things were okay because I'm having twins)..and everything was fine! They said to call the doctor if the spotting or bleeding lasted more than 24 hours or if you were in pain and cramping. I'm sorry that your experience did not go very well at the ER...that has happened with me too. :( It's very unnerving. As for the heartbeat, you're still pretty early...so most likely you won't be able to hear the heartbeat for a couple more weeks. You can see the heartbeat during your ultrasound though! Definatly bring up that you were spotting with your doctor, but like I said, it's VERY common. Good luck!|`|5f614e2e96b3fb9e9678be9ef96d8967aa	I didn't have the spotting problem, but i didn't gain much weight at first and my clothes stopped fitting also :) I ate so much more while i was pregnant too, but i guess i have fast metabolism. If it only lasted a day, then i would not worry about it too much. if i tcontinues however, i would definately set up an appointment with your OB/GYN.    Good luck!!|`|rwKcZ9ucaa	Okay I am 8 weeks and it seems to me that everything is okay I know your worried and I am too everyday I am always checking everything making sure everything is okay you should be fine relax we pregnant woman tend to worry about our children its okay its our motherly instinct its okay you will be fine good luck|`|yYSWs9Imaa	sometimes sex knocks your cervix around a bit, and can cause a tiny bit of spotting, its nothing to worry about. people who are high risk of miscarriage are warned not to have sex during the first trimester for this reason, but nothing has ever been proven that sex can lead to misscarriage.     this might sound like TMI, but if its brown, its old blood, and red is fresh, brown is never anything to worry about (unless theres loads) and red is worth mentioning to your midwife, but not worth panicking about unless theres lots and with cramping.

QT5ROElraa	This is exactly what happened to me!!! I am past my due date now, and am going to be induced on Sat.     I have tried Everything from week 37 on to make him come out. I tried ras tea, sex, nipple stimulation, walking for 8 hours at a mall and then grocery shopping, squats... and so on. My dr told me Not to try the casor oil as it will make both the baby and I have the runs, and if he gets that in his lungs it would be really bad.    I am terrified of Petocin So I asked my Dr if there is any other way to induce. She is going to have me come in late Friday night and give me cervadil which just softens the cervix, and hopefully I'll go into labor on Sat. morning.     The last three times I have gone to the Dr I have asked her to do a membrane sweep, so far no luck, so I'm just getting ready to go into the hospital Fri night...|`|Bw1h5xAcaa	You can't. There is no method that is proven to work or that is safe. If you need to be induced your doctor will induce you when they feel it's necessary. Otherwise, a spontaneously occuring labor should be the goal. Hang in there.|`|QYYWBrG7aa	walking and sex >:}.good luck and congrats.hope ur baby will come soon.>:}|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I heard nipple stimulation works really well.|`|ZvaFsGvjaa	sex(because the sperm softens the cervix or something)  raspberry leaf tea  nipple stimulation  swimming  walking  LOL - castor oil (although my doctor said it would most likely just make me sick I have heard of people using it)    really though, the baby will come when the baby is ready there isn't any sure fire way to make them come out|`|ttrA4TiRaa	try using a breast pump or manual expression of your b-milk will help bring on labor. you can also try raspbery leaf tea, spicy foods, walking, washing walls or floors on your knees while rocking your pelvic side to side...LOL i know it sounds funny but it will help loosen everything up down there and it works good. also lots of SEX!!!! lol and last resort i could take about a tbsp of castor oil mixed with 1 oz of OJ and drink it like a shot. i would repeet this every hr for 4 hrs and ont he 5th hr you will be heading to the hospital! good luck|`|yDYJH2lNaa	Nipple stimulation releases hormones that induce labor, the same hormones released during breastfeeding or an orgasm (which is why sex is also recommended).|`|oKpwrwb7aa	There is no way u can, I tryed everything from tea's to massages, Its hard to hear but the babe will come when its ready, just hang in there it wont be long
xXnFx6qLaa	My son was pulling up from 8 months as well.  He took off on Christmas Day! :)  He was 14 months old.      My advice - don't rush it.

Now she is 7 and does everything a normal child does.|`|s8VgyzE2aa	all kids are different even within one family. I consider walking being when a child can walk well on their own, not just a few steps.     I have 4 boys.    My oldest are twins, they both walked well at 15 months    my middle son walked well at 10 months    my youngest walked well at 13 months.     give it time, he will walk. It sounds like he is well on his way so I wouldn't worry.|`|nrqWwQBXaa	10 months but she is really advanced. my son did not walk to 18 months?|`|prqrQcd1aa	My oldest child walked at 14 months, my middle child was 18 months, and my youngest is 16 months old now, she is not yet walking on her own.  Each child is different and will walk on their own in their own time, The best thing to do to help, i've found is to just hold their hands and walk around with them. Stand them in the middle of the floor a step away from you, sit on the floor and try to get them to walk to you for a toy. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Just be patient, he will come around soon enough!|`|7WcfzvPvaa	My first daughter walked one week before her first birthday, my second walked at 15 months, and my son walked right around his first birthday, a little after.

I wouldn't worry, I have heard that the average age for a child to start walking is 14 months.|`|t1fx6kXcaa	Children walk anywhere between 9 and 18 months. Your son will soon start walking. My son (now 22 months) started crawling at 6 months and just before 7 months was pulling himself up on furniture. At 7 months he was cruising and at 8 months he was walking. My partner also walked very early. Personally, I would have been much happier and less stressed if he had walked at a later age, lol.|`|ztug2gLjaa	My son didn't walk until he was 13 months.  On his first birthday he was still crawling.  I thought something was wrong with him but they say that boys are slower learner that girls .

He's now 18 months and a happy, bright, talkative and energetic toddler. As long as there aren't any other developmental concerns, I wouldn't worry about it. All babies are different.|`|v065DMvtaa	Don't worry- and don;'t compare him to when other babies walked. He is his own little guy and it sounds like he is doing just fine! He'll walk when is ready. Mine were all three different- firstborn walked at 15 mos. second child was 10months and the last was around a year.   It sounds like he is developing at a very normal speed. If you are that concerned ask your Dr, but really there is no set age for walking. Just love him and enjoy him- he'll be walking soon enough!|`|XPnCeJ29aa	He started walking at 9 1/2 months.  Now at 10 months, he barely even has to sit down. He walks the length of the house. He gets a little wobbly still but he's not settling till he's running.  I never even tried to teach him, to be honest. I never held his hands and walked with him, he just decided he wanted to..and Im sure seeing older babies had a big effect on it.  So I think he will just do it when he is ready.|`|irLnPW4aaa	My daughter was walking by herself across the room at 9 months and two days.  My son was walking independently at 10 months and a week.    All kids are different, and your son is still well within the range of normal.  Don't worry :-)|`|EtCRnDJMaa	my 1st daughter was waling on her own completely at 9 months.  My younger two at 10 months
fqOxtVyBaa	im the same way but what this is is your birth control making your blood thicker its like sorta clotting but thisis normal when i get to th ened of my period its like that its totally normal so dont freak out.|`|AA10015577	I thought there was a recall on the Nuvaring, I guess I heard wrong.    If you have had unprotected sex in the past 2-3 weeks it could be a sign of implantation bleeding.  If your AF doesn't come in a few days, I say take a test!  Good luck!|`|yYSWs9Imaa	well as your posting in pregnancy forum, I'm guessing you think you might be?    It could be an implantation bleed, a small brown bleed as a embryo is implanted into the lining of your womb, or your period could just be late.    Hopeing you get the result you want. If it's not here in a day or two, take a test.

G392tazhaa	I have MTHFR - genetic blood clotting disorder.  From what i understand it can cause blood clots in your uterus preventing fertilized egg from attaching or a blood clot can pass to the fetus....

I have to have blood thinner injections in my abdomen daily as well as take a high dose B vitamin pill... you may want to ask to be tested for it.|`|mx3gFmIKaa	multiple miscarriage is reason to believe that a clotting disorder is the reason.

Have you been checked for bacterial vaginosis? its a LOT LESS scarry than it sounds! Its a common infection that women can get from unprotected sex. Its b/c the flora in your vagina is overgrowing with good bacteria b/c the male sperm aggravates the PH of your vagina. It has been linked with miscarriage so I would check that out hun. Its not a dirty infection at all. Some women can get it from swimming in a dirty pool. THe dr can give you something called Flagyll to fix it. Its really quite common and some people don't even know they have it. GOOD LUCK HUN!!! I am sorry about ur m/cs. I hope that you get a sticky baby bean soon!!!       EDIT: did they tell you that you have a blood disorder? Most disorders can easily be treated so hang in there! 
54cf275d0238f8dd4d90351c9a055b00aa	Probably the same as your last appointment, they dont usually start doing exams and checking you until I think your around 36 weeks. So they will check your weight, the heartbeat, urine sample, and measure your belly and anything else they normally do on your appointments.|`|qmmu6hv5aa	Nothing different then any of your other appointments, they don't change until your 36 weeks. Kind of sucks but its true.|`|fqOxtVyBaa	WHAT YOU SHOULD EXPECT IS HIM TO DO AN ULTRA SOUND AND TELL YOU THE SEX DONT BE SCARED IT WONT HURT YOU OR TH E BABY.|`|5k0FKWTSaa	A routine antenatal check will involve a check of:  - Your Blood Pressure   - Your urine sample - to check for sugar/protein etc - to check for infection, signs of pre-eclampsia, diabetes in pregnancy.  - Your baby's heartbeat (An ultrasound is not routinely done if your pregnancy and your health has been straightforward/troublefree --> unless you go private and pay for it!!)  - measuring or feeling your pregnant tummy to gauge the growth of your baby & plot it on a chart - to make sure your baby's growth is satisfactory  - A quick chat to see if everything has been going okay for you / anything bothering you / unwell; or if your midwife had any worries & referred you to a doctor.    - If you have not had your bloods taken in the past 4 weeks to check for your "iron level" (Haemoglobin level) and Antibodies check , then you might need them done today.  - If you are blood group Rhesus Negative, and have not had anti-D given prophylactically in the past 4 week, you might be given this injection -  this is to reduce the risk of Rhesus isoimmunisation in your subsequent pregnancies, which can be detrimental to the baby's health.    If there are any concerns regarding any of the above, then steps will be taken to address these issues.|`|u7kDLuklaa	LK pretty much covered it.    I am also 32 weeks (im due 2 days before you!) and had a visit yesterday.  She checked my urine, fundal height, blood pressure, and baby's heartbeat.  We talked about birth control options for after delivery and i signed a consent form for a post partum tubal ligation.  Im not completely sure thats what i want .. but if you're thinking about it the form needs to be signed 30 days before delivery for it to be federally paid for.  We also discussed feeding options and she gave me some literature on breastfeeding.    The next couple visits will be the easy ones.  No cervical checks.  YAY!    Good luck!
eTuK9t85aa	Don't give her any more bottles, don't give in!!  Put the milk in  a sippy cup, and when she gets thirsty enough she will drink it, trust me, i had that same problem with my daughter when she was younger. She would get so mad she would throw it across the room, cause she didn't like the sippy cups! just hang in there, and she will use it!!!|`|1XAUxQlDaa	Wow, this is like im reading my concerns. My son is 17 months. He will also just drink juice and water from the sippy cup BUT, only drink formula from his bottle. So, I recently am trying to get him out of drinking the formula and to start drinking regular cows milk from the sippy cup but its been really hard. so i searched and searched for a transition cup. which is in between a bottle and a sippy cup. it had the same feel of a bottle nipple but they have to suck out of it the way they would if they were using the sippy cup. It's got 3 different transition nipples/sippy cup nipples. It's great. So far...its really working    The brand is Nuby...now i checked the Nuby site and they dont have them on there. But they have them at Walmart. It comes with all 3 nipples/spouts. Here's what they look like.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	Don't give her anything but milk. When she's thirsty enough she'll drink it.    I'm assuming she isn't still on the bottle or breast.. If she is, she won't want milk from a cup.  For a lot of kids, it's one or the other.

I used them for 8 months of TTC before giving up, I never once got a posative, but conceived current baby by just having sex every other day for the length of my cycle.    I know lots of people they have worked for, and a few they don't. Make sure you test at the right time to increase your chances (around 3pm) and test every day. If you body releases the right amount of the hormone, then it will give a posative. Check out peeonastick.com for more info on how they work.
AA10196172	There's the calendar and then there's doctor count.     Before ultrasound the only real guide doctors had was "When did your last menstrual period start?" (LMP) So they counted from that date. The assumption is that ovulation and fertilization happened "about" day 14. Once you miss you period, about day 28, you are 4 weeks pregnant on the doctor scale, even though junior has only been growing there for 2 weeks.    Each 4 weeks is 1 month. Typically a pregnancy is 280 days from LMP or 40 weeks or 10 "months". For the last month (last 4 weeks) you are "9 months pregnant" or in the 10th month. For the first 4 weeks, you are in the first month. The next 4 (5-8) you are 1 month, in your second month; etc.    This is easier than arguing about what day it all started, worrying about months with 28 or 29 or 30 or 31 days, etc.     But it's a doctor scale. For normal people who aren't going to the ob-gyn every month, we always use our fingers and the calendar and say " ...July-June- May- April... Hah, when she got married she must have been already pregnant."  280-14=268 days which is about a week shy of 9 calendar months.    Besides, who cares if you're 32 weeks or 34 weeks? The baby's coming sometime when it feels like it, that could be off the due date by more than a month.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	4|`|AA12275027	if you are pregnant then you are 4 weeks.|`|iwYu32N2aa	depends on when you missed your period|`|WuVW9uCAaa	ushould be about 4 weeks|`|GZrR0uxjaa	you would be about 4 weeks pregnant, it depends on your cycle though...|`|596ddaee42df0ec8a6b9d7b4242c6338aa	It really depends on how long your cycle is.  If you have a 28 day cycle, and you are on day 1 of your expected but missed period, you are four weeks.  If you have a 35 day cycle you are five weeks.      If it's a week past your expected period, and you have a 28 day cycle, you are five weeks.     It all depends on your cycle and how many days late you are.|`|3Rr5SAhhaa	http://www.webmd.com/baby/default.htm    scroll to the bottom onthe left hand sid ethere is a due date calculator, put in your info and it will tell you about when you are due.|`|gGor2COOaa	Day one is considered the first day of your previous period.  Even though you haven't been impregnated until about 2 weeks into your cycle, and then another 2 weeks til you miss your next period, you're considered to be 4 weeks pregnant at that point.|`|5k0FKWTSaa	In general, pregnancy gestation is calculated from the first day of your last period. Most women have period cycles that are monthly (approx 28 days-ish.. although most with range 26-35 days... and beyond!)    Presuming your period cycle is monthly, then when your period is due and hasn't arrived, and you find out you are pregnant with a preg kit; ==> you are 4 weeks pregnant. (And your baby was conceived approx 2 weeks prior to this)
2ObqoJbKaa	Hey. Well, since your periods are irregular right now, that probably explains why your period is coming at weird times and eveything. I wouldn't worry about that too much, it may take some time for your cycle to get back on track. Also, implantation bleeding is usually just a light pink or possibly brown trace of blood, like light spotting. If you had a lot of red blood flow that looked like a regular period, it wasn't implantation bleeding then. It was probably your period coming a little early. Your probably not pregnant yet. Keep trying tho. Most women don't get pregnant the first month they try. so don't get discouraged. Alot of the times it can take a while for some people to get pregnant. good luck. Lots of baby dust!|`|iMULlxdgaa	congrats on the wieght loss!  thats fabulous.  try to take a test in a few more days,  have your doctor test you, and just keep having sex!  you cna def. get pregnant but I would have sex EVERYDAY just in case your ovulation dates changes suddenly.|`|AA11488344	It could be implantation bleeding, or it could just be an irregular period. My suggestion is to take another home test. Possibly after you stop bleeding, if possible. See what's what. If your test is negative, it is probably safe to assume that the bleeding you are experiencing is a period.|`|kuOhklDiaa	you could take a pregnacy test, its been so long since i have been through this, i do not remmeber spotting,  check out womens health at medhelp.com  there are alot of obgyn nurses over there, and a seperate forum that a doctor will answer your post  wish you luck, my friend just started infertility treatment, i wish i knew what she was taking, because ot was relativly cheap and an easy process
bzkSIJYnaa	I definitely prefer Stella. It's unique and uncommon. It has a sweet, old fashioned sound. She'll stand out among the Isabella's, Gabriella's, Bella's, and Ella's, but at the same time, she'll blend in nicely. I like that.    Savanna(h) is very popular, and not that attractive, in my opinion.     Stella ranked  244 on the Top 1000 list of 2007, and Savanna ranked  246. However, Savannah ranked  30, and they both sound the same.|`|ZX2so3twaa	i like savanna.   stella just sounds too old for a little girl, but savanna works for all ages.|`|DkVqOe8Iaa	I prefer Savanna.

This might be because my fiance vetoed Savanna, but Stella just seems like a "cooler" name to me than Savanna. I figure if I had to be stuck with one of the names as my own, I'd rather be Stella than Savanna. Simple as that.|`|7adzqyGgaa	STELLA|`|YeZE7Kjcaa	I love Stella, too!  My hubby likes Olivia, but I think it's become too popular.  I don't want my child to be one of several in her class with the same name!        Stella feels very chic, but not too trendy.  I picture her with a funky little hat and big smile.  A little girl that other people would be drawn to.    Savannah is nice as well, but I think too many people are doing "place" names right now.        You could say, "my uterus, my name" or, "since I'll be the one doing all the work its only fair," but your hubby might not like that!    Oh! @Ginger, the play is "A Streetcar Named Desire."

XoBNGIDPaa	It sounds like the baby has dropped and is putting pressure down below. It is normal at this state, but labor could still be a few weeks away. Good luck!|`|AA10405438	Please don't be scared, this is your baby dropping into position.  Labor will begin with a tightening around your belly.  Back pain and pressure could also be signs.  Call your doctor's office and speak with a nurse.  The worry you have is not good for you or your baby.|`|qmmu6hv5aa	i'm 36 weeks to and have the same problem...tons of pressure down there.. i went to the doc yesterday she said not only is it normal but i'm 100% effaced and his head is really low so thats why.     it just means your baby is dropping and getting into position, absolutely nothing to worry about i promise!|`|FSY30gbvaa	Sounds like the baby has dropped into position and is probably head down in preparations for labor. These are your signs of labour/prepping for birth.|`|8dc41485498f18170d31c362140f42aaaa	for the last few weeks i walked like there was a melon between my legs! I had no signs at all just contractions then baby came out,they had to break my waters. Every labour is different, but believe me when i say it-your know when your in labour! All the pushing "down there"is your baby dropping and getting ready. Has your bump dropped? Good luck! x|`|3QJZqEy7aa	This is your baby "dropping" down, this is normal and is just your baby engaging,  for me I started feeling this at about 34 weeks,  and baby has continued to engage until now (am 38 weeks),  so expect to keep feeling this pushing for a few weeks yet.    Apart from your show or waters breaking or the obvious contractions starting any other signs are not necessarily a sign labour is near - ie some people have diarrhea (but I have had that for weeks) some people have increased braxton hicks.
hKJIDdVqaa	my son is rather high strung and impulsive. I have found omega 3 capsules given everyday have improved him significantly.  Omega three helps the brain focus.  I refused to drug my child with ritalin which is actually worse than cocaine.  Try removing artificial ingredients, wheat, or dairy from his diet. ADD and hyperactivity is not a child's or parents fault. Studies show generally it is a deficiency in a child, that when properly supplemented cures the problem.|`|kmRIKbzpaa	First - don't use the word "ADD" around your kid. Be aware that your child has a specific, but very common PERSONALITY TYPE that simply needs to be managed in a certain way. Managing a child who has a hard time paying attention will have a positive impact on their success in school and life in general.    There are a ton of books on the subject, so arm yourself.     Another piece of advice: Please don't medicate your child. It really bugs me that parents sometimes 'dope' their kids just because they are more difficult to manage.    Find ways of helping your child learn and remember that he/she seems to enjoy. Dealing with problems is a very individual issue. What works for your child will be unique - and should be tailored to his/her specific interests or needs.    For example: Maybe, (like my daughter) your child would rather tackle homework in 10 minute chunks instead of 1/2 hour lumps.    Maybe if your child has a hard time absorbing lessons at school - they could use different ways to increase their ability to remember. My daughter is muscial, and loves to come up with silly songs to help her.    Making learning fun is always going to help ANY child (not just one who has a short attention span) enjoy learning, and therefore learn more.    When it comes to discipline: My daughter needs to be told things ten times (like many, many children). I find that consequences need to be immediate so that she will do what she's told. If I repeat myself 10 times, I have failed to apply positive reinforcement.    The main advice I would give you is this: Spend your time developing an educated and HEALTHY attitude about your child. This will arm you to deal with your issues in the best possible way.|`|HQbAzAvVaa	what do you need advice about?|`|f1c3e4fed0bc8c4bf3636c69cd65cebfaa	My oldest was just dianosied with ADD. I wanted to go the therapy route, sadly I'm unable to due to my insurance.  So we have tried him on 2 different meds.  The first, he had a severe reaction to, he acted completely crazy.  The second he says he didn't see any difference, although we did notice he was able to concentrate better.  However, it seemed more like obsession.     We are looking into the ODD. His doc isn't entirely sure if he is ODD or if its just his 13 yr old hormones. Its tough, trying to do the right thing for your kids.  What do you need help with?  I'd be happy to talk to you.|`|HZvo9YFHaa	advice on what? revise your question please.|`|AA11757270	my son is ODD, but the therapist he has started seeing hasn't been giving me any tips on how to deal with him.  I have done my own research, and here is how I am dealing with his ODD:    I always overly praise his good/positive behaviors.  Rewards for getting his stamps in school/at home.    I step outside if I am about to get angry.  Taking 5 minutes to breath, calm down, and evaluate how to handle things makes a difference.  The angrier I get, the more aggrivated he gets.  I also ask him if he needs to be alone to calm down, and when he asks for it, I give him his space to cool.     I use time-outs consistently.  Time starts when he sits in his time out spot, and time isn't added for additional arguing/extra comments.    I used the "Nanny 911" model of having family rules that are always on display in our kitchen.  That way, I am reminded, as well as he is, of how the rules apply to EVERYONE, not just the children.  Mommy and Daddy have equal responsibilities, and codes of conduct.     Have "your time" away from your child.  I use my daycare/grandparents/other relatives to watch my son so that I can go to a salon and get a pedicure or a massage once or twice a month and just breathe away from the kids to focus on me, so that my son is not always the focus of my attention.      I started excercising so that I would feel better about myself, and that helps me to destress and gives me more energy for the more challenging days with my son.|`|f4gR9cIDaa	I'm not a parent, but I'm an adult who grew up with undiagnosed ADD until college.  I spaced out in class, had the classic hyperfocus while reading (my mom literally had to wave her hand between my eyes and the book to get my attention because yelling didn't work), and had trouble paying attention to--and therefore remembering--what I was supposed to be doing.  Has your child been evaluated by a psychologist or psychiatrist?  What kind of problems, specifically, is your child having? How does your child feel about the matter?

zk3Bp9uNaa	It is possible that its twins - or you have picked up the sound of the umbilical cord......ask your Dr|`|VJpdmd0waa	Could be possible, next time you go to the doc ask them to check an see if you can get a ultra sound..  Good Luck!|`|Bw1h5xAcaa	If you're 16 weeks, it would be unlikely that they wouldn't have discovered twins before now. Did you have an early ultrasound?     Sometimes you can hear an echo with dopplers. And it's only going to give you one heart rate on the reading, and babies' pulses vary, it could have easily gone from 160s to 150s.     Talk to your doctor, but don't count on it being twins.|`|JsEd4H0raa	There is a possibility.    The next time you go to the doctor's mention it to her/him.|`|9hrJfhIIaa	There's a possibility!

It should get darker by then if you are pregnant.  It could be that you just don't have enough hcg in your urine yet to make it a dark positive.  Nothing wrong with that, and stop doubting yourself!!!  Maybe, even take one tonight, but make sure that it is like 4 hours since you last went to the bathroom to make it more diluted.  Baby dust to you!|`|rmse6Mj8aa	generally the wisdom on disappearing positives is that they are error tests and should be regarded as negatives.  peeonastick reports this on first response tests.    retest tomorrow with fmu and report the test to the company and ask for a refund!    good luck!  x|`|sUBFp1oIaa	How long after you looked at it did the line disappear? They say after so long (maybe 10 minutes) that the results are no longer accurate. I would think that if you took the test, saw a positive and then looked a while later and it was gone it should still be positive. Retest tomorrow or Wednesday...how ever long you can wait!! Good luck!

They aren't on solids so the liquids go in and come out in come out much the same way.    Formula fed babies will eventually thicken up due to the iron in the formula.|`|ZRNlwu5laa	About a week. After it will turn a yellowish color. If still dark after a week or so call pediatrician because there could be blood in the stool. But at this point it is normal. Congrats!|`|jLNwrVZRaa	That sounds pretty normal but if it continues for a while longer then I would call the pediatrician.

ROJans2Taa	During the first trimester of pregnancy, if the dates estimated by ultrasound study differ by more than one week from estimates based on your last menstrual period (even if you are relatively sure of when it occurred), it may be reasonable to use the ultrasound dates. In the second trimester, ultrasound is less accurate and your doctor probably won't adjust your dates unless the estimates differ by more than two weeks. The third trimester is the least accurate time to date a pregnancy. Estimates based on ultrasound can be off by as much as three weeks. For this reason, doctors rarely adjust dates during the third trimester.     so since yours was done in second trimester, it is possible it could be off by as much as 2-3 weeks, unfortuntly theres no other way to narrow it down|`|ofEvutlzaa	pretty accurate|`|QYYWBrG7aa	the ultrasound tech that done my ultrasound said that the sooner they do it the more accurate it will be.i one one done at 9w0d and its only been 1 to 2 days off..|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	They're pretty accurate!
9979bb6f0e03a8d3d1be61eab96d087daa	Honestly, my husband and I went through the same thing - we'd been married for 10 years and always said we would wait until we were $ stable.  Those days never seem to come, something always came up.   Last December we decided that we weren't getting any younger and if we wanted a family we better start trying because it can take months or years to conceive.   Well I got pregnant and then hubby changed jobs, we had no insurance!  I had to get Medicaid to cover the pregnancy expenses and the expenses to come with delivery.  Although it was odd having to rely on assistance like that, it was for my child and I don't regret getting it.  Hubby has been laid off for 2 months now, during which he's had to rely on unemployment checks which are sad.  (But he starts back tomorrow - YIPPEE)    Point being - things will always happen and you can't plan your life around waiting on the perfect moment.  If you're in a stable relationship - go for it - the rest can be figured out as you go!    I'm 33 and he is 34 and we're expecting a little boy in 14 weeks.    Best of luck!|`|o7E59VYZaa	yes, it's true you never will be financially ready for a baby, but getting pregnant and bringing home baby is the best feeling in the world so why keep putting it off? go for it hun and good luck:)|`|XLsnuAqmaa	i say at least wait until you are done with graduate school.  you are halfway there and why risk not going back.  it sounds liek you and your husband are prepared...you just have to want it!|`|SrXvJq8eaa	If i were you i would get off the pill now. and start trying cause you don't know how long its gonna take you to become pregnant.
a88c35ef9c55d87377ccb9c18365cc44aa	My son was 6 weeks premature but was completely mature at birth, he was just small (4lbs 4.5oz). I got to take him home after 4 days in the hospital.  He is now 8.5 months and does everything a full term baby would do (crawl, pull himself up to stand, babble, ect.). He is still on the small side. I just switched him to 6-9 month clothes last week. I am sure you know you are supposed to use their "corrected age". Like my son was 6 weeks early so his actual age is 8.5 months but his corrected is 7 months. Just use your due date to calculate their corrected age. The Doctors say that by the time they hit 2 years they are supposed to be all caught up. Congrats on your twins!|`|c73QkZ2haa	I dont have a premie but my nephew was born at 27 weeks and spent about 4 months in hosp and he caught up by about 7 or 8 months he was on track with the other kids his age. Hes 8 now and hes a little smaller than other kids his age but otherwise hes fine.  Is the 2 months their adjusted age?  ETA:ok so they was in hosp for 4 weeks and 5.5 weeks? Not months?    Its weird mine were only early by 4 weeks and one of them is perfectly fine the boy and our girl twin is slow to catch up and very tiny but shes normal. Our doctor keeps saying she will catch up. Our doctor said that some babies react to being early more than others but they all catch up eventually.|`|l0KKABJmaa	My nephew was a preemie and he is behind in everything.he was so tiny too..Now he is 4 yrs. and looks like a 3yr old boy.
yYSWs9Imaa	it varies from woman to woman. egg white cervical mucas you can stretch between your fingers is a sign of being fertile, but some women produce this all cycle long.    edited to add a website, it says you can also have stretchy clear discharge when you're pregnant, it is often an early sign for some women of pregnancy.    http://www.thelaboroflove.com/articles/c...    Hope this helps you!|`|o1yy6KABaa	So im told - most women will get the discharge during ovulation, but some women get it all through the month.  im not 100% sure on this theory but for the last 7 months we have been going by charting most fertile days and  have had no luck getting pregnant, this month we have been bd'ing while I had the discharge, so its always worth trying anything!|`|WuVW9uCAaa	yes|`|FSY30gbvaa	stretchy clear discharge that reminds you of eggwhites is the sign of ovulation. So yes to answer your question.|`|vJ0j5rRLaa	I hope so, that's what I am basing my ovulation on.
22aE3SCBaa	It's more likely the negative was a false. False negatives are more common than false positives.|`|67QVKHQ3aa	thats odd, flase positive are very un-common try a digital test you cant go wrong there!|`|54cf275d0238f8dd4d90351c9a055b00aa	It is more likely that your EPT was a false negative, it is more uncommon to get false positives.|`|3Rr5SAhhaa	False positives are very, very, very rare. Take another test, but of a different brand if you want to be sure but chances are your eggo is preggo! Congrats!|`|AA10015577	Consider false positives only when you are taking hormone supplements, experiencing a chemical pregnancy, and/or were pregnant and had a miscarriage (which sometime occurs).  I'd say you are pregnant because a positive is a positive.  Go get a bloodtest or re-test in a week.  Good luck!|`|0fe4f3702c5dd1a403524194d3e9fabdaa	False Positives are VERY rare so I doubt it was a Fasle Positive. False Negatives are more common.|`|WO7WAP19aa	You can get false negatives but NEVER false positives! so i would say your 99% pregnant, go for a hCG blood test it will give you a definite answer then they are so much more sensative & are NEVER wrong.      Good Luck x X x|`|yYSWs9Imaa	it's impossible to get a faulse posative pregnancy test. A line, is a line, is a line. for more info, go to peeonastick.com a really great website that tells you how tests work.|`|UxwjpsKQaa	false prositives are very rare.. go to your doctor and get blood work its more accurate|`|UQ0PoEfAaa	How many weeks down are u? wait a bit longer before retest, its probably a bit too early, if so, then clear blue is a reliable product to pick these up, while some other products arent. Go for a blood test if ur impatient. Are u getting faint positive immediately?? as if u read them after 2-3hrs, it might be the evaporation line.  are u using 1st morning urine?  when i got faint positive at 4 weeks pregnant, it turned out to be an ectopic...so be careful

5c8563e950b55b57b5a84298aab976d8aa	I'll be 32 in a few days and I'm 34 weeks pregnant with my first.  My doctor tells me I'm in excellent condition, the pregnancy is progressing like a dream and the baby is 100% fine.  The only thing the medical staff are concerned about is the amount of worrying I insist on doing!  They've never made me feel that I'm a special case because I'm over 30 and I don't think my worries are based on my age.  I think I'd still have the same concerns if I were a decade younger.  Screening tests are nerve wracking but I would have had them whatever my age.    I think my main problem is simply fear of the unknown, coupled with being a control freak.  I'm making a concerted effort to relax about it all and realise that I've done everything I can, I have the best care possible, and some things in life are beyond my control.  It seems to be working at the moment but who knows how I'll be feeling next week!    One good piece of advice I've had (which I just can't follow) is to not spend too much time looking everything up on the internet.  Everything has gone so smoothly with my pregnancy and I feel great so most of the time I'm 'researching' things that aren't even relevant to me.    Try to relax and enjoy this special time (says me!).|`|n6XYYyoLaa	i had my first at 34 , was a high risk preg, and we are all fine....don't worry, it will work out...|`|mx3gFmIKaa	Yes you need to be concerned.  Ignorance of the statistics is not going to change the situation.  Keep in mind that this is the average.  Everybody's individual fertility is different, if you have super good quality eggs then your risk would be more like a 30 yr old.  If they are poor quality your risks are more like a 40 yr old.    Delivered at 28, 32, and 33.  Years of infertility, poor quality eggs of someone much older.  Failed triple screen twice, soft markers for down's twice, 3 special needs sons with multiple dx.|`|iOSEVRPPaa	I just had my first baby at 38.  He is totally healthy.  I chose not to do any of those tests because I knew I wouldn't choose to terminate the pregnancy no matter what.    No, I would not be so concerned unless you are unhealthy or have a history of genetic problems in your family.|`|iMY2fgYdaa	I was over 30 when i had my son and you should not be worried about all the doctors are telling you..don't forget it is their job to inform you of all the possibilities..like the woman who commented before me...if you are going to love your baby no matter what then don't sweat it...don't even have the tests done, I didn't ..if your child is born with a problem..then discus your options then.....I will tell you that those test can be wrong and doctors are encouring abortions for what may turn out to be a prefectly normal baby...I have a friend who was told her son would have down syndrom and they suggested that she abort her baby.....long story short....she didn't and he was born absolutly perfect. Don't stress its bad for you and your baby...just be thankful for your blessing of soon to be motherhood!!|`|AWqGmJUxaa	no just just 4 your age you will be ok your luck i am 25 and they don't care at all and i have had 4 already workinf on no5
nrqWwQBXaa	yes a reward will make them want to do things. no a punishment would make them not want to listen to you?|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	I think they're best motivated by a sense of doing what they know to be right, by feeling pride in themselves & who they are.      But, if you have to choose between reward or punishment, why not go with reward, with reinforcing that sense of 'you are capable of doing good things'?|`|F6lZHRkVaa	All kids are different. I was never very motivated by punishments, I'm still not motivated at all if I'm told I'm doing badly. I do better with a lot of praise - the more praise I get, the harder I work.    My mother on the other hand - negativity gets her blood flowing. If someone tells her she's doing something wrong, she works harder to do it right.    I know we're not children but "people" are different this way, including children. If a kid works better with praise, they'll work better with praise when they become adults too.|`|YAiKlPkMaa	You get good results from rewarding, but there still has to be discipline when they do wrong, many totally skip that part,it raises children who are ill equipped for the bumps of life.|`|Rk87mqkoaa	Neither. How about some respect, imagine they were actually people with brains and you will be capable of respecting them at least a little...|`|EayLdDkWaa	Instead of a reward, make the ice cream a "thank you" for good behavior every once in awhile. Giving rewards motivates children in the short-term... but long-term they won't behave unless they're promised a reward. It's creating a terrible "entitlement" culture. I work with some Gen Y people in my office and they expect heaps of rewards for every little thing they do. Y'know? Alicia up above had a great answer. Praise works better than rewards.... rewards eventually lose their shiny desirability.|`|taHcR41jaa	if they achieve reward|`|kuOhklDiaa	positive reinforcement ofcoarse, all people work on a reward system  punishment should be for serious issues|`|45nSn7Rcaa	You punish bad behavior and praise good behavior..on a rare occasion you may want to reward good behavior...but rare...most times you just praise, otherwise they think they will get something every time they do even the smallest thing good...for the rest of their lives...thats not the world we live in.|`|s8VgyzE2aa	neither, they are best motivated by consistency, discipline (teaching right from wrong), praise in words or hugs, basically having a good all around parenting style is what motivates children to behave and do well, rewards and punishment are and should be last resorts.|`|zHRWklEWaa	Rewards. with rewards their is a motivation to activly do something right, with punishment you just need to not do anything wrong.|`|veO1RXrCaa	My son is a bit of both.  He loves to work to a reward.  But sometimes he takes it for granted to so we have to take things away rather then give.|`|ztug2gLjaa	there motivated by rewards.  If I tell my son that if he doesn't put that away he will be punished then he will just look at me with his sourpuss face like he didn't hear me. BUT if I tell him to put that away and I'll buy him ice cream he jumps up and it's done.|`|AA12221392	I don't think all kids learn from any style, some things work with some kids and don't work with others. With that being said, rewards can be used in many different ways to help reinforce postive behavior. But punishment for bad behavior is also very much needed as well.     We always did lots of charts, the reward was maybe extra tv time, or get to watch a movie of thier choice that night, or they got to pick what game we played for game night.     My youngest son was struggling in school so we set up a reward system  for when he achied his goal for the week. But he had consquences also if he didn't reach his goal for the week .     My concern with buying them something, then they only do the behavior usually until they get the item so you could have to keep buying them something everytime you want postive behavior. But I would never reward with food. Food then becomes used and they may ended up with a eating problem or associate food with good thoughts or good behavior.|`|RS6TvY2eaa	look at grown ups,,people start a new job and say they will do whatever cus there happy with the pay or just that they have  a job but within a couple months they dont care ,they call in, they say they dont make enuff,,my point is humans get acustom to things and dont care about or get excited about rewards when it comes often,,tell them when they are doing good and that youre proud but let them know when they do something wrong that youre disapointed in there action ,,good luck ,,children need discipline ,

G9ruFZtbaa	Toys are always a good way to go. Children generally pick one single toy they love a ton.I would say go to wal-mart and start checking out the toys there. Typically you could get more for the money than with a babies r us gift card and a lot of the toys have labels stating how age appropriate they are. most children's toys have labels like for 12 months plus or for 18 months plus. I would recommend checking out the labels and going at it yourself.oh and there was this one zebra that the kids ride on and it makes a ton of noise i forget the name of it but a lot of the children i know love it.|`|537fb036f0d7f523891b1281ae7d57d1aa	Some fun music like Jack Johnson, The Sippy Cups, The Imagination Movers, Elizabeth Mitchell, Laurie Berkner.|`|SlBsJ3NRaa	If they haven't already gotten them, outlet covers, baby gates, and cabinet locks were life-savers, literally.

8d3449f38cb7fb6433fd139aaa50a8a0aa	No, not always.  It is the dilation of the cervix which makes it "fall out."   If you don't dilate enough before you go into full blown labor it won't come out.  When I had my son, I didn't lose mine until the morning I went into labor.  I lost mine at about 6 AM, started feeling contractions almost immediately, and was in the hospital that evening (arriving there at 7 cm dilated).  I could have been contracting during the night, but when I got up at 6 to go to the bathroom I noticed blood.|`|b5IKISHBaa	You may lose your mucus plug , your waters may break or you could just have severe frequent and strong contractions.  Don't worry you will definitely know when you are in labor.  Most babies take hours to be delivered specially the first one..  Did you know that the pains after delivery  can be as painful as the original contractions as everything tries to tighten up again.You are usually ok with your first but the more kids you have the more  severe the after pain contractions are.Don't worry    any pain is immediately forgotten about when you hold your baby for the first time.  Good luck !|`|XzbRZCPUaa	i lost my plug then went into labor but my water never broke|`|hWc65sEtaa	With my first one, I never lost my mucus plug or had a bloody show.  I just woke up one morning with light cramping.

I noticed a 4 minute gap on my contraction patterns for a few hours and went into the hospital to have my first child.  My second was a different story, so I can't verify either way with that one.  Each person will go into labor in their own way, just make sure to keep a watch on contractions and other symptoms!  Good luck!|`|7i6qj4OXaa	I had no signs at all on either occasion.|`|jQDeTTVhaa	no you don't and yes it is possible  Lost my plug at 41wks with my first and so far 39wks 6days and still havent had either|`|MqFeJiukaa	Its different for every woman and every pregnancy.  I lost my mucus plug about 2 weeks ago and I am only 35 weeks.  With other babies I have lost it usually a month before.  One of my good friends lost it during labor.  I know some women don't notice a mucus plug at all.  My mom says she always lost it in early labor also.  SO it just depends.|`|aLkCxq5aaa	I never lost my plug with either of mine, just noticed slow contractions at first which gradually got stronger and didn't go away after I had a bath.     Good Luck with your labour and birth, xx|`|LdzTP5VXaa	It was contractions for me. I waited until it was 5 mins apart then I went to the hospital. I was in labor for 18 hours total.|`|MAbqM6aEaa	Yep, totally possible.  Call your ob and see if they think you should come in or just stay put and monitor.  Hope you have your bag packed because you might need it.  Good luck!|`|WGXdfh22aa	with my first i didnt loose my mucus plug until i was in labor. my labor started as just what felt like braxton hicks contractions every 4 1/2 mins. i just thought they were braxton hicks until i suddenly got a period like pain. then they jumped to every 3mins. by the time i got to the hospital they were on top of each other.|`|AA11567932	You can have a 'show' the mucus plug you mentioned a couple of weeks even before labour begins, even sometimes if your waters break labour will not always start immediately like it should, but rest assured, if your waters do break and theres no sign of labour within 24 hours after, they will take you in for obs as you will be open for infection,    They may start labour off by induction(artificial hormone placed inside to get the contractions started) or see how you go.. Labour doesnt always go as planned and babies will come when they are ready|`|XjHXgGU2aa	I was wondering the same thing as well. I'm 38w2d and have had no signs so far that can predict when labor might start. Although my baby's head is all the way down and in position for birth. Just hang on, when it's time, your body will let you know either by breaking your water or starting the contractions.     The problem with contractions is that you have to time them and only if they're 5 minutes or so apart can you only go to the hospital. Whereas, if your water breaks, you can go right away. Also if you lose your mucus plug in the next week or two, do call the hospital as labor can start in a few hours from there and you don't want to keep sitting at home if you live at a distance from the hospital as I do.     I hope this info helps you. I'm also waiting around like an anxious kid to see when it happens :) I also wish you the best of luck with your labor and delivery!|`|4uqj8Nf1aa	Every ones different,personally i lost my mucus plug in the bath after a few hours of mild contractions,whitch at the time i didnt evan know were contractions,i had to have my waters broken for me when i was 10cm dilated and  at the point of pushing.  Good luck with everything,labour hurts but its worth it :D  xxx|`|2gyKORCbaa	you don't have to lose your plug before going into labour|`|uLLQovSyaa	Not always,everyone is different.My friend was pregnant with her 1st child and was in the store and went to the bathroom and her water broke.She didn't even know that was what it was at first.She was early and eventually while she was at the store she knew something wasn't right.Luckily she was in town where her doc was so she went in and was like"I think my water broke".I on the other had with my 1st went for my weekly check up and the doc asked me if I'd been having contractions and I was like I don't know(I still didn't know what they felt like).I was at 4cm.We went home so I could finish stuff at home and make sure on my suitcase stuff.I began losing my mucus plug later around midnight give or take and went to the hospital and I was in labor.If you're not sure you may want to call your doc.I know it's frustrating when you don't know what to expect.Good luck:)|`|N4pomooQaa	no not always..... my first i was induced but w my second i was dialated for wks before i went into actual labor and then the contractions hit hard and they ended up breaking my water when i was like at a 6.
hwRdT156aa	people get abortions because they don't want the responsibility of a child. they like to use it as a birth control when in reality a condom is 10x cheaper. and a fetua is more than just a clump of cells, it is an unborn child that is a life.|`|aLAmvX5Naa	You are just a clump of cells. What's the point of you?|`|AA10186411	Ok you make absolutely no sense..|`|kuO4oypZaa	I get where you're coming from.  If you suggest the lump of cells is human because will grow to be a child, the pro abortion individual might counter with the old "you can't know that for sure" argument.

UNWLaJbKaa	Try again tomorrow.  For some it takes the day after or a few days after their period is due for a positive.  I had all your symptoms above (minus the implantation spotting) and for both months I tested negative, but I swore I was pregnant.   This month I noticed my breasts were really sore on the sides, and I took a nap out the blue, and I have been really irritable with the hubby, and I just found out i'm pregnant.  I got my first positive at 11dpo, but I also tested at 9dpo out of curiosity and it was negative.  So everyone is different, and you may have implanted late. <br>  <br>  You will def know either way once your period arrives, or doesn't :)<br>  and there is nothing wrong with you.  Sometimes when you want something so badly (ahhemm me) you see and feel all the signs wanting it to be true.  I know I did, but this month I stopped paying attention to the signs cause  i was afraid of disappointing myself again, and it just happened to be the month for us.|`|ca03c4dbfbf739cc439141f60d700173aa	Are you absolutely certain of your ovulation date?

cAtWxJG1aa	a handful of people are actually "pro-abortion" in some cases:  that is, they believe that regardless of what the mother thinks, the mother should abort if she is unmarried, or a teen, or suffering from a disability, and so on.    pro-choice to me means that whatever you personally wish the parent would choose, you believe that the decision is ultimately up to that parent and not you.    *eta -- though there's a fair amount of merit to SoCal Bob's answer, as well.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	In my mind - pro abortion means you want people to have abortions.  Pro choice means you want people to have a choice that is best for them.  I don't feel comfortable dictating to other woman what should or shouldn't happen in their uterus.  Therefore I consider myself prochoice.    Choice to do what is best for them and their body.|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	Pro-abortion sounds like you encourage abortion, like you think it's an awesome thing & you would suggest that every pregnant person do it.     Pro-choice means that you support a woman's right to have abortion as a choice, if that is what she, her doctor, her family & her conscience decide is best.|`|Fd4lITkvaa	Pro-choice is saying that women should have the choice. It doesn't mean you feel that abortion is right but some people feel that it should be an option, right or wrong. It doesn't mean you want everyone to run out and get an abortion each time they have an unplanned pregnancy or that you feel like it's the best option which would imply pro-abortion.    The majority of pro-choice people are not pro-abortion. They just feel it should be kept legal for various reasons.|`|lkhCeAdJaa	So CAl Bob explained it precisely right.    Pro Choice=pro abortion (meaning you think one should have the right to choose to abort)  Pro Life = anti choice (meaning you think one should not have the right to make that choice)|`|a3MSSvdcaa	Pro-choice mean letting people choose what they want to do, but since they're not pro-abortion, they would discourage someone from getting the abortion.|`|xoVA08Zaaa	There really is no difference unless, perhaps, a person is pro-choice because they feel it is up to the woman to decide but do not look to abortion as an option.|`|7tyRW6oIaa	prochoice means that you're for having the choice of whether you want to have an abortion or not, and proabortion means that you're for having an abortion.|`|65e0c93e39fac0974cefe1be5c93b58daa	I was too slow getting to this question, because I wanted to answer:    Pulling out!    Pro-choice means the government doesn't restrict a woman from making the decision to abort, since it is her body.  Pro-abortion means they are in favor of abortion as a means of terminating unwanted pregnancy.  You can be pro-choice but not pro-abortion, just because you support a woman's right to choose doesn't necessarily mean that you agree with her choice.|`|QvSwo3X9aa	"Pro-choice" means that you believe everyone should  have the right to make the decision for themselves whether or not to get an abortion. You can be morally opposed to abortion yourself but still respect the other person's right to choose for themselves.  "Pro-abortion" means you believe abortion is a good thing. This is a term mostly used by people who appose abortion  because they think that people who are pro-choice simple like having abortions because they are bad people (nothing is further from the truth).|`|prqrQcd1aa	to me it means that they do not really believe in abortion, but do see why someone would want to have one... like in cases of rape, incest and medical necessity. This is the way i view it as well. I can not call myself pro life, because pro lifers do not believe in abortion for any reason.  Pro choice people believe that a woman has the right to choose to end a pregnancy no matter what..  Pro choice(not pro abortion) means what i said above!|`|weE5FxCfaa	the way i had it explained to me once was from a woman who considered herself pro-choice, but not pro-abortion.  she said she believed that everyone has a freedom of choice, she just believed that abortion was not a viable choice.  i am por-life so i can't say from personal expereince, but i think it is all in interpretation|`|tkSXjqhuaa	I'm PRO a woman can do what she wants with her body,   I'm not for abortion, but I like knowing that I have the choice.  God forbid I was raped and fell pregnant, It'd be a hard decision, but I'd like to know that I have the right to terminate the pregnancy.|`|cjnBs0h6aa	There really is no difference, pro-choice is having the choice to be able to choose to have an abortion or not. Pro-abortion is being for abortion, that you should be able to do it if you want.|`|AA10160596	Prochoice means your to much of a coward to admit that abortion kills unborn babies. Pro abortion means you don't care if unborn babies are killed.|`|C2kOCTVfaa	It is just the connotation of the words use.    As a pro-choice woman, I dislike the term "pro abortion."  To me, pro choice means the willingness to give others the right to choose what is the best for them.  A pro choice person is not for abortion in all situations, we just want it to be available for all.    I think this is how most pro-choice people feel.    It's like me calling someone pro-life "anti-choice."  I think it's more of a respect thing than anything else.|`|uCPC0Jymaa	It's really easy. Usually those who are for abortion rights, the legal right for a woman to choose whether to have an abortion or not, refer to themselves as "pro-choice."    Those who disagree with that position call that "pro-abortion."    So it depends on which side of the debate you're on.    Similarly, those who call themselves "pro-life" can be called "anti-choice," as well.    Does this help?|`|jAhfjLataa	pro abortion is where you are for abortion all together, whatever the situation.   pro choice is where someone does not have to agree with abortion but believes it is the rightful choice of the mother to make that decision.|`|EZzHjm8Vaa	i never looked at it that way. but i guess that is what i am.      it means that you believe abortion should be legal but they don't nessicarily agree with abortion.  like i think people should have a choice, but i don't exactly agree with the abortion itself|`|tQzpb4tMaa	there just about the same thing. just that prochoice means that the person believes that it should be up to the lady. proabortion means that they believe in abortion. prochoice doesnt mean that they like/dislike abortion.    me, personally..i am pro-life(no abortion whatsoever, i believe in putting the child up for adoption. just because its still a fetus, doesnt mean it lives, breathes, has thoughts, loves, blinks, smiles, etc.)|`|rtsfPQqMaa	Pro-choice is the term used when people believe that women and their families have the constitutional right to privacy with their own bodies- therefore should have the right to choose whether or not to terminate a pregnancy.  The cornerstone of Roe v Wade is right to privacy or choice- not the right to abortion.  On this side of the issues a person can be personally anti-abortion but politically pro-choice.    A person who is pro-abortion believes terminating a pregnancy in its early stages is something that they would consider as an option if a reason arose.|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	Interesting question.    If I said I was pro-abortion, it seems that it might imply that I'm open to having one (regardless of the situation).  I'm not.  That said, I am pro-choice.    ETA:  I am LOVING SoCal Bob's answer and agree 100%!

oWAUb6vpaa	Rupture can happen at any time but it's usually in the first several weeks since the fallopian tubes are very small. <br>  <br>  It's unlikely you'd gain weight since the embryo is still so small. The only weight gain would most likely occur from what you're eating and not actually because of the embryo. <br>  <br>  If you feel you may be at risk of an ectopic pregnancy, contact your doctor asap or to the emergency room as soon as possible. <br>  <br>  Below is some information I quickly found - copied directly from the page I listed in the link below "source": <br>  <br>       "An early ectopic pregnancy often feels like a normal pregnancy. A woman with an ectopic pregnancy may experience common signs of early pregnancy, such as:<br>  <br>  A missed menstrual period. <br>  Tender breasts. <br>  Fatigue. <br>  Nausea. <br>  Increased urination. <br>  As an ectopic pregnancy progresses, however, other symptoms develop, including:<br>  <br>  Abdominal or pelvic pain, usually 6 to 8 weeks after a missed period.4 Pain may get worse with movement or straining. It may occur sharply on one side at first and then spread throughout the pelvic region. <br>  Vaginal bleeding that may be light or heavy. <br>  Pain with intercourse or during a pelvic exam. <br>  Dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting (syncope) caused by internal bleeding. <br>  Signs of shock. <br>  Shoulder pain caused by bleeding into the abdomen under the diaphragm. The bleeding irritates the diaphragm and is experienced as shoulder pain. <br>  Symptoms of miscarriage often are similar to symptoms experienced in early ectopic pregnancy. For more information, see the topic Miscarriage." <br>  <br>  <br>  Lots of luck, luv..|`|7SKVCPcSaa	yep.. you're body still sees it as a normal pregnancy.. you gain weight just as you would if the baby was in the uterus....<br>  <br>  rupture can happen anytime in the first 3 months.
SFMwVJojaa	No, don't offer her milk, she has breast milk 'on tap' as it were and is eating calcium rich foods. If she's growing ok then don't worry. Easier said than done i know! If i were you i'd 'experiment' for a few days, give her a little less for breakfast so she's hungrier, try to distract her at snack time but you may need to giver her luch a little earlier. Then try something like cheese on toast, or chopped ham in scrambled egg. just a little on her plate then if she finishes offer something else. as long as her fluid intake is ok then for a few days playing around with her routine won't hurt. maybe pack a small sandwich (a quarter of a sandwich cut into tiny triangles) into her own little box as a novelty.  You can always ask your health visitor for advice.|`|LZfEhqYdaa	I think she is old enough to try cow milk.  However, be watchful that it doesn't upset her digestive system.  My children cannot tolerate cow milk, so they drink soymilk, but eat cheese sauce or cream-based soups (the fattier the milk, the easier on their tummies).  So just watch out for tummy cramps, diarrhea or constipation.  But sure, let her try to cow milk.  Lots of children her age love milk!  Good luck.|`|fjZeVLOQaa	ur child should be eatin more so i wood give her cows milk or cow & gate stage 3 milk|`|Y3DR1EBUaa	Wow dont look like enough to me.. my son is 12 months & eats twice that much|`|eC1dQVcgaa	It won't do any harm to offer cows milk as a drink throughout the day!! <br>  Would be good if you could get her to drink it, as it will be good for her later on.<br>  I don't think it's a question of should you shouldn't you, because it won't do any harm either way!! =]<br>  <br>  EDIT- My friends daughter is the same, doesn't eat much, maybe you should try to give her this..

They are called Pedia-sure here in the US.

Ka52nbhNaa	My boy/girl twins are now 6 months old.<br>  <br>  When pregnant, my doctor told me to not worry about doing a kick count.  She told me to trust my gut and it I felt decreased movements in general, to call her.<br>  <br>  Towards the end of my pregnancy, we did weekly non-stress tests where they put a fetal monitor on each baby and a third to monitor for contractions.  This was a good way to see that both was doing fine . . . we also did more frequent ultrasounds.<br>  <br>  Try not to worry . . . trust your gut and call your doctor if anything does not feel or seem right.|`|vUoEgKxpaa	just ask your doctor.|`|h3IjAuCgaa	Im 18 weeks with my twins now ! and we have one pink ! but couldnt see the other one he had his back turned i belive its a boy ! anyways mine are side by side ones more on a angle really weird but i can feel twin A the girl she moves alot but Twin B he doesnt seem to move as much you will be able to tell  later on i guess its the way they are lying also , Are your twins head down ? mine are head down so it makes it easy to tell what bits are what ! Give it till 25 weeks i have a friend that is 25 weeks with twins and she is being able to tell really well and can even seen a foot ! So just ask your doctor next time your in and they will give you an idea of whats going on in there ! i brought a heart monitor for a little peace of mind its funny you can hear the heart beats as well as them moving and hiccups its neat ! its only a cheap on for like $50 but i just like to hear them moving !|`|8wnvhBQTaa	At 22 weeks I couldn't distinguish between them either I think I was about 28 / 30 weeks before I could tell who was kicking.

q4rG5Dwtaa	uhhh i hated sending them but I had to, and I knew they were in good hands because I investigated them really well. I sent them all at 8 weeks of age and after they got the first set of shots. I brought their blanket that they use from home, of course their bottles and pacifiers, a extra set of clothes in case of accidents, diapers, wipes. I would definitely ask, how they put them to sleep, and make sure they put them on their back not tummy, make sure their blankets are not in their faces,  make sure they don't prop the bottle up to feed them. make sure they are separated from the older kids.<br>  <br>  edit: I also call to check on them and stop by sometimes too just to see how the kids are doing and they are always happy so that helps me get through the day without them|`|G2auAv1Saa	6 weeks. Since it was just the norm for her she does very well. She is 4 1/2 now. I had the same issue, not knowing them personally- so I made sure I got to know them. I would make sure I had extra time to stay there in the morning and evenings (for about 5 minutes) and I would just talk to them and watch how they interacted with the children. Trust your instincts. <br>  When she was a newborn I would pack a bag and leave it there and refill it as necessary. Bring a whole pack of diapers and wipes. They will let you know how they want the bottles brought (already made or not, disposable liners etc.) and just bring enough for every two days. blanket, pacifier. And write their name on everything. <br>  Pop in during the day since it is so close so they know you can be there at any time! <br>  Your baby will do fine, it will be harder on you!|`|qayCggxMaa	My daughter started daycare at 9 weeks old, but I had some real issues with that daycare, so we switched her to a different one after only a week.  When I had my son, I decided to wait until he was almost 6 months old before starting him in daycare.  I really thought with the second one it would be easier, especially since he was so much older, but it still was emotionally very hard for me.  They both have done really well in daycare overall.  My son is almost 2 now and has started having some issues in the past few weeks, but I think those will clear up once he moves to the 2 year old room on his second birthday (it's hard being the oldest kid in the baby room - not enough activities).  <br>  <br>  You need to ask the daycare what you need to bring - every one I've seen to has required different things.  Some provide sheets for the cribs, others do not.  Some provide formula or baby food or diapers and some don't.|`|JT4OSUPeaa	Our son was 6 weeks when he went to daycare (thumbs down if you wish). Its very hard, I won't lie no matter the age.<br>  <br>  It really depends on the center what you need to bring.

I'm a childcare provider and I have a little girl that just started when she was 3 months. Mom pumps and I feed her breastmilk, she naps great, she's always in a good mood, and is a happy little baby. It took me a few days to get to know her and what she needed but it's been fine. I've only ahd her for two weeks and she fits right in. The bigger kids love her and always show her toys. I like to put her in the Bumbo seat or high chair so she can watch the big kids play and eat lunch. <br>  <br>  As long as the 'Tuesday' provider has all the baby gear, has the patience and desire to watch her, she'll be fine. Use your instincts. You'll know if it's the right move. If child care options are limited in your area you may want to jump on the chance to go with a great provider when you come across one. However if there is a lot available, your baby would benefit from the one on one care she's getting now. Six months really is an ideal age for starting daycare and if the church spot opens up I think it would be great. Waiting lists are a gamble though. <br>  <br>  I suggest my parents pack a daily diaper bag with all the necessities. 10 diapers (enough to have extras), wipes, creams, powders, extra clothes, bottles, formula/breastmilk. That way the bag goes home each night for parents to re-stock and you always know the provider has exactly what they need. Some daycares prefer to store all the supplies there so you'll have to ask what their preference is.|`|826c99fcf56ac4219e686a150815183baa	Because my family needs two incomes, I put my daughter in daycare at 8 weeks.

My day care is actually a sitter in her home, about a mile from home and work for us.  Is that like your lady?  He has done great.  He loves his sitter, and he has a social network there.  Because it is small, only about 6 kids, they range from 7 months to almost 3 years.  So he has exposure to lots of things, and I think thats great.  <br>  <br>  I think starting her now is a good idea.  I would  recommend you acclimate her by bringing her (or having your MIL bring her) for half days at first.  Believe me, that will make it easier in the long run. <br>  <br>  Things to ask: <br>  - What are the experience and education levels of the caregivers?<br>  - What are their policies are if you are running late picking her up?<br>  - What is  their protocol for sick babies?<br>  - Ask (delicately, mind you) whether you pay for her days off, and other billing policies.  <br>  - Ask about her payment policies, and make sure she reports her income.  If she does not, you cannot deduct your daycare expenses. <br>  -Find out whether she is registered.  Mine is not, and that might have put me off had she not come so highly recommended by 3 friends who used her for their infants. <br>  - If you nurse, you will want to ask about how she handles breast milk: do you have to make the bottles or does she?  <br>  <br>  My babysitter lets me just bring a bunch of stuff and leave it there so I do not have to pack a back every day.  About every two weeks, I give her a big thing of diapers, wipes, cereal, formula and jarred baby food.  She tells me when she is low.  At my sisters daycare, she had to go in every Friday and change the sheets in their crib.  <br>  <br>  And believe me, I know how you feel.  But if you have a good caregiver, you can go to work every day with a clear head.  That is invaluable.  Good Luck.|`|rDl9XR76aa	My oldest went to daycare at 2 months because we needed the income. He is 5 now and has been to 3 different daycares. The one he is at currently is nationally accredited...rather large, but they cover all age groups and they have separate classrooms (yes classrooms, because they learn stuff there, too) for each agegroup from infants, toddlers, Twos, etc all the way up to Middle School Aged children. I love it. Like I said, Nationally accredited, so they are probably all over. Kindercare.<br>  <br>  My youngest started daycare at 6 weeks. He has been going to the same daycare from day one, and he is 17 months. <br>  <br>  Kindercare is a little on the pricey side... but I work for the government and the government covers daycare expenses. It's nice.

Do you think it might be chicken pox?  Or a heat rash?  I have linked to a slide show of conditions so you might be able to narrow down the cause.|`|aLTW2HO7aa	Take her in. There is something with similar symptoms that needs attention. It has a name like “Band ???” or “Chest band measles or something like that”.
LCHnUuS6aa	It is not really a menstrual period - they follow ovulation, but a postpartum bleed.  It can last for 6 weeks, or longer.  Wear pads the size you need depending on how heavy your flow is - night time pads are good for a heavy bleed, and stores like Mothercare sell maternity pads.|`|pqIm7R8Caa	i had my son nov 4th 08 and i went for 4 wks i quit a wk and then got my period it lasted a week and few days i wore always overnight w/wings|`|o9u4H6m6aa	it can last up till 6 weeks, but i've never heard of anyone where it lasted that long. usually it's heavy for a few days or a week. then it's gets really light. it can get heavy again if you start doing to much strenuous things. so that's a sign to relax.  get the maxiest pads for the first few days, and just regular pads for after.|`|sa0EwdvEaa	mine  lasted 3 whole months, it sucked and i could bleed through a pad in 20 minutes, i hated it.
fa0dd5777a3c1d7f167867babbfebd0baa	1. Not necessarily. It'll be best to be on the mini pill to prevent pregnancy if you don't want to get pregnant again. The mini pill is best while you breast feed as far as a birth control option. I relied on breastfeeding for birth control somewhat and now my babies will be about 12 or 13 months apart.    2. I wouldn't recommend it after birth. You will be sore. I would wait until the 6 week healing period is over and then be sure to ask your doctor at the 6 week appointment.    3. It varies for different women. I think the longest is 6 weeks. For me it was only about 2 weeks.    4. It's just that since you haven't had a period in such a long time then the blood comes out in sometimes huge amounts and plus after giving birth, it's just your bodies way of getting itself back to normal. I would ask my doctor if I had huge clots coming out though. Good luck hon.    Hope I helped =)    *edit-I didn't have period like cramps when I started bleeding again. I did feel the cramping of my uterus going back down to size since I was breastfeeding. My uterus was like contracting and that was a bit uncomfortable. The day I got home from the hospital it hurt so bad like a contraction I felt when I was in labor. That didn't happen again though and it lasted for only about 10-15 minutes. This is normal. But expecting a little cramping if and when your breast feed =)|`|OwK17Qo1aa	No breast feeding not always stops your period. I've had friends breast feed their baby and have their menstrual three months after birth.    No you cannot wear a tampon after giving birth. No sex for six weeks or until your follow up appointment. You are still at risk for infection for about six weeks after delivery.    They don't really consider it a menstrual period after birth and it can last from 3 to 6 weeks.    They say if you have huge clots after giving birth that you need to go back in to your doctor to get them checked out. And try and save some of the pads to show them so they can make sure everything is okay.
ZVqEDvZSaa	It all varys depending where you live.     Rape? Has she told anyone..police..|`|s1utniuvaa	the actual abortion is not painful. After there will be some cramping after and depending on pain tolorance that may be painful. And yes she will be awake. As for the cost, it varies on where you get it done, how far along and where you are. Check planned parenthood.com     My heart goes out to her, rape is never easy and the violation she must feel should be felt by no one. I hope she is getting help. I have been in her shoes and she needs all the support she can get.|`|bnQ7im8Caa	if she goes to planned parenthood they will base it on her income. usually its around (255 to 400 dollars) sometimes they give you medicine so that when they do it, your unconscious. she will feel pressure and a little bit of pain, the pain usually comes after the abortion is done and it last about 2 to 3 days. but the bleeding will continue for a week or so.|`|vZwJyqc6aa	look up "the silent scream" on youtube.

To answer your question, yes it is extremley uncomforatable, and emotionall hard on the person having it. The cost is between 300-500 and they do give you valium usually to knock you out.    Has she considered adaotion? There are many loving couple out there who want a family and would give the baby a good life.|`|Wok0Y6ebaa	The average cost is about $800, and yes it will hurt.  She will be wide awake through the entire procedure.  The pain isn't horrible, but it will hurt.  Not trying to scare anyone, but she should know that it isn't a walk in the park to have done.  My heart goes out to her for what she is going through.  I hope things work out.|`|XKoPyRsAaa	I have heard that they are like $200 and that they are awake and there is some pain  but this is what i have heard so.. sorry i cant give you facts :)

MubTZUKXaa	As the uterus grows it moves the placenta up with it.  The uterus still has a lot of growing to do so it's very likely to move.<br>  I was told at my 20 week scan that my placenta was completely covering my cervix.  I had another scan yesterday (I'm 29weeks) which showed my placenta had moved up and was now considered 'high'.... I was told by the Dr before I had the scan that 97% of low lying placentas move up in time for the birth.  <br>  So don't worry, at 97% chance of moving up, you have a very good chance of a natural birth.<br>  <br>  Since the placenta is implanted in the uterus, it doesn't actually move, but it can end up farther from your cervix as your uterus expands. Also, as the placenta itself grows, it's likely to grow toward the richer blood supply in the upper part of the uterus... <br>  <br>  Just ensure that you are aware of the risks of placenta previa during pregnancy just to be prepared either way.|`|67QVKHQ3aa	i had the same issue they say it has up to 20 weeks to grow and move, mine moved by itself and now im fine. they also told me that in most cases it does move!<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|X6as2nOAaa	I have no idea, maybe you should ask the doc that question im sure you will get a better estimate.|`|uuHPneEcaa	u should ask ur doctor about that.

umdKUxSDaa	it could be implantation cramping. <br>  <br>  <br>  when i got pregnant in october i had cramping about a week after ovulation. and so on but it sadly ended in a miscarriage. a lot of girls i know have had this cramping after ovulation and it ended in a miscarriage so hopefully if you are every things healthy.

She is probably doing it because she gets attention from you. It has probably also become something like a habit. You should should show her some good habits to do.|`|2QyAMsrfaa	she wants attention.. every time she does it.. ignore her.. n she will stop|`|e0CED2EZaa	its the attention.. act like you dont care.   she will eventually stop.  if not. slap her on the hand and be serious like someone else said|`|ox6SXta4aa	There is more than likely a light at the end of the tunnel on the upside~ my daughter did this too starting at a little over two years.  She would actually throw up though.  It was a  huge inconvenience to stop everything and stay home "sick" because I really couldn't take her to daycare when her big sis is Saying "she threw up today".  She stopped doing it after two months but I would watch her to make sure she isn't putting anything besides her hands in her mouth.  Why they do this though ~ is a mystery to me as well!|`|Ua9CZtINaa	I read this in a book - The secret of happy Children by Steve Biddulph (he's a psychologist).  You say she laughs when you take her hand out right? She is probably bored and most of the day has nothing to do. So instead, she wants to catch your attention "Look at me! Look at me!" kind of thing. She wants to be noticed more often. So, I advise you to put 100% full attention to her if she talks to you and have as much time as possible to spend with her full-on. And here's a tip: Try not to say to her Don't put your hand in your mouth. Try saying it without using "Do not" Or "Don't" it encourages her to continue. You should read the book to learn more.  Good Luck! Hope I helped!|`|T9gaHu1kaa	my 15 month old does the same thing. I used to do the same thing as you, take her hand out as soon as I seen her. But then I started pretending I wasnt paying attention to her, and she stopped doing it. Sometimes she will do it once in a while.. but if i dont pay attention she wont do it.|`|ztug2gLjaa	she wants the attention.  I f you ignore her and don't pay attention when she does it then she should stop.|`|NwTggQ2Baa	My daughter started doing this once I had my second baby. I figured that it was because she wanted attention but it was confusing because her twin wasn't doing that. She was 1 year old at the time and only did it for about 2 months. But I think your daughter is wanting attention and she knows if she does something like that she will get your attention, even if it is negative attention.     My advice is try to spend as much time with her. Even know you are busy with work,another baby, or whatever it seems like you are busy with, try your best to give her attention even if it is little bits throughout the day. I hope this helped    Best Of Luck|`|LSYTl1kYaa	my 15 month old son does this, the last couple of months hes been bad about it, but after smacking his hand and telling him in a stern voice "no!"  hes stopped, infact i havnt seen him do it in the last few weeks. just give it time she may just be going through a normal phase!   but i know how upsetting it is, it use to scare me when he did it, like panic-mode kinda deal. he even did it till hes thrown up a few times and still kept doing it. so i think its just a phase:)    good luck|`|PiKHJZ67aa	your feeding her too much. she wants to be skinny.|`|mIkN1ifcaa	Just let her throw up and then see if she likes it after that.|`|1UMBIatVaa	I think it is just a lil' kid thing. I have a cousin who sits on the couch and rocks and rocks and rocks. I would contune to be stern with her in a gentle way and yank it out of her mouth everytime she does that.

It may just be a phase. Just dont let  her shove other things down there to  make her gag. Its best to start teaching  her not to do it as much though, just in case.

(:|`|dd1c8373d258bab9181f891f88ea8dafaa	You can stop her if you're serious about it. you might have to smack her hand and tell her no! and be very serious, even if she cries.    Or you could just let her throw up and see if she still thinks its fun after that.    My son went through it. I just didnt let him do it.|`|AA10390690	my 10mth old started doing that as well. it's quiet frustrating at times. i think she dose it sometimes to get attention or doesn't realize it at other times. hard to tell what runs through their minds though lol =]|`|gdbeVf32aa	stop it it could soon become a very hard to get rid of problem! this is very dangerous and unless you run into a doctor answering on this site id go see one! this is no laughing matter!!!!|`|MhvwRwNKaa	my son used to do the same thing when he was around that age.. he did it for attention too..

Do you think she's doing it on purpose?|`|vwZvxNevaa	Well consider it like sucking her thumb. No it's not funny at all. No don't just let her do it. She is too young to know it is wrong so you need to teach her that it is wrong or she could end up doing it while you're not watching and hurt herself. I know some think it's mean but you should start putting stuff on her hand to make it be gross to put in her mouth. Don't use hot sauce cause she is a little young for that. Just make sure it isn't toxic and can't harm her. After a while of getting a gross taste in her mouth, she will stop.|`|9d60a294b6864b585406ddb61a14d757aa	This is in no way my area of expertise BUT looking at this through the eyes of a child makes me think that what she is laughing about is not her gagging but your reaction to her gagging.  She has found a neat little game where she knows if she does this she can make you cringe, jump, bug your eyes, and basically just center all your attention directly on her.  From her stand point she gets alot of benefits.  She gets to laugh at the faces you make and she gets your total attention.|`|ZrCgkqZ4aa	Well one year old's can be stupid. I babysit, but I think you should let her throw up. She won't like that. Since I babysit I wouldn't do that(To the kidd I'm babysitt) But still, she won't like to throw up...I hope.|`|LlnPkAZxaa	I am the mom of 2 with 1 more coming in less than 2 weeks.  I have also been a daycare teacher for the past 11 years (toddler/potty trainers).  My own kids never did this but I have had students who did.  In my experience the bast thing to do to get it to stop is to ignore it.  I know this is easier said than done but it does work.  As long as she keeps getting attention for it weather positive or negative she will keep doing it.  Toddlers thrive on any kind of attention they can get.  Good luck.|`|tIldpr7vaa	because of the attention u give her for it|`|Grb85RJuaa	You need a young priest and an old priest. The power of Christ compels her!|`|dOnQuOtyaa	Well, yes! Of course!!!

Babies always like their parent's attentions right? =)
Lu09abiDaa	They are blocked sweat glands, very common, my son was born with loads of them and the midwife said it was because he was quite overdue and his skin had dried out.<br>  <br>  They disappear on their own, usually by 12 weeks. Don't be tempted to try and pick at them!|`|e0eb82b689e1db392eb51c89982ed115aa	The are from hormone transfer from mom. They are sebaceous fluid filled pockets. Which is mostly fat. Just a thing that happens. Mom is making so much hormones when she is pregnant that baby is floating in a soup. So when baby is born, its kinda like coming off a drug. The Hormone has to be metabolized by the baby. It can take weeks. Some girl babies even can go through a mini period due to too much estrogen. These little spots will dissipate in a few weeks. WHAT EVER YOU DO... do not pick or pop or put stuff on them. They are not pimples or acne. They will leave scars since the fluid is deep in the derma. My daughter had a few on her nose, and she had a mini period and swollen breasts for 2 weeks after birth due to my high hormone production through pregnancy. Shes two now and not a problem, healthy as a horse<br>  <br>  TOO ADD: for the one that has an 8 year old with them.

I read about eptopic, blighted ovum and missed miscarriage and i go from being convinced something is horribly wrong but i dont know it yet and believing everything is ok. as for eptopic, you're right.. unless you have a structural defect, have had repeat abortions or surgeries in that area you are not at high risk for it, and they usually present with symptoms between 6 and 7 weeks which includes pain and bleeding. Dont worry though, you're not alone.. Im constantly worried that something is wrong and probably wont be at ease until i see the little one happy and healthy on the ultrasound. Im hoping for the best for you. if you need someone to talk to about fears, etc you can write me.. though it's my first pregnancy and i dont know much about what to expect, I do know how it is to feel scared about these possibilities.    Good luck and take care.|`|8N4aPcpaaa	so first off let me tell you when the nurse didnt hear my babys heartbeat with the doppler til i was 15wks so thats not unheard of i also had the spotting and got freaked out turned out it was just a bacterial infection so try not to get nervous or stressed everything is most likely fine and you will know for sure after your sonogram goodluck|`|sGJ9mohSaa	try not to worry too much. get some books and read up. the more information you have the calmer you can be. as far as the spotting, you could have had a little tear. if it is gone then don't worry about it. having to pee every five min is normal, your breasts are most likely sore (not full yet) because of your hormones (they are going crazy right now) your clothes are getting a little snug because you are most likely a little bloated the best book i have come across is "what to expect when you are expecting" it is about $15 soft cover.|`|89nFQ6TVaa	Hey Congrats! I'll be 9 weeks prego on friday so we're just a day apart!  I think you're fine...if something was definitely wrong you would know it..you wouldn't be so iffy about the situation. You still have all the pregnancy symptoms and only had light spotting and that usually happens after intercourse. Just relax and I'm telling you everything is fine!|`|8fmnODsnaa	i have had two children and two miscarriages. you have every right to worry about your baby, but you need to remember to keep calm and try not to stress out the most important thing is lack of stress. do not listen to everything you hear and freak out over it, but DO listen to your doctor. try to have as little rough sex as possible. (smile) all pregnancies are different even in the same mother. wait for your sonogram and do your best to not stress your body out mentally or physically. babies can be very touchy to these things. they feel what you feel without any choice. keep your head up and don't let the staff make you feel that way. take it to the "person in charge" if need be. i had to do this and because of it an entire ER has now has manditory inservice on how to treat people with only positive outcomes so far. good luck
NWEJdpocaa	I've only heard it pronounced Nah-Vay as well...I'm not fond of the name at all though!<br>  I still agree with your break-down to me that is Nah-Vay!|`|c3CVY87caa	nah-VAY-uh...

According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevaeh" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevaeh</a> there are several pronunciations:  "The two most popular are :<br>  neh-VAY-uh and nuh-VAY. A common Australian pronunciation is nuh-VY-uh."<br>  <br>  The wiki gives much detail into other variations of pronunciation as well as details of the believed origins and history and its recent popularity.|`|LoP2CRE2aa	It is commonly Nah-vay-uh. the final uh is from the EH. Nah (NE) Vay (VA) uh (EH).<br>  <br>  I agree it is kind of confusing, but thats what happens when you go spelling words backwards and turning them into some kind of name. I think it is an awful name (sorry to all Nevaeh lovers). I always think to spell it Neveah....it looks more "correct" for the pronunciation...but I would NEVER name a child anything close to the name Nevaeh.|`|b05fe691e5ceb5cc16ca919cd11e5eccaa	We had a neighbor that lived around the corner and they had a little girl with that name and it was pronounced Na Vay Uh.

rjVALevtaa	My body is basically the same. I went back to my pre-pregnancy weight very quickly after both of my boys. The only thing that really bothers me is how saggy my breasts are now. I have also gone done about 1/2 a cup size since quitting breastfeeding.|`|Qfq4lpe7aa	My boobs are worse we plan on taking care of that but my body is more womanly! :) Pregnancy was not that bad to me! :)|`|gx4s68s8aa	After having my first (I am currently pregnant with my second) my body was about the same as before.  After a few months my stomach was as flat if not a little flatter than before.  After breast feeding my breasts were more saggy but I am a very large breasted woman normally (32 D) when compared to my height and normal weight (5'4 106 pounds)  Age and gravity will catch up to all large breasted woman anyway, so I don't know how much pregnancy had to do with it.  But beside my breast I thought I looked just as good.  I have always been rather thin and my hips never widen.  I was actually a pound or to lighter a few months after having my baby.  And I am 35 years old.  I will have to see how a second c-section and second baby does to my body this time.  I hope for basically the same result.|`|AA11348933	No, I'm not unhappy with my body.  After a couple months my belly went back to normal.  I think I look better now than I used to.  I'm 32|`|dqSqlArRaa	I am 26 years old and had my baby 5 months ago. The biggest change for me is the pooch! I had a c-section, so not sure if this is typical even for a vaginal birth, but I have a little pooch over my scar. My sis, who has three and looks tinier than ever, says she even has a little pooch and she delivered all of her babies vaginally.|`|EcsJaYjmaa	I'm 21, had my first at 18 - my tummy is covered in stretchmarks and a little loose skin (kind of looks like a chicken's neck!-lol) and i no longer have a belly button. ): (well i do but it's all misshapen.  My boobs are slightly deflated.  Apart from those 2 things, the rest of my body is the exact same.    Pregnancy certainly wasn't kind to my tummy or boobs, but it has made me feel more womanly. Iam still the exact same weight as i was before.    It depends on luck, genetics, and how big you get (my tummy got huge- people kept asking if it was triplets!!! but the rest of me didn't change) boobs only went up one cup size.

QMWlOSXraa	Hi sweety, I went through a similar thing while at school.<br>  After a year of it I almost moved school but my mum wouldn't allow it so she went to the school and eventually it all got sorted.<br>  Don't let this 'Leah' see she is bothering you, just hold your head up high and try your best to ignore her.<br>  Hunny please speak to a friend, tell them how you are feeling, be completely honest, by the sounds of things you need to talk to someone. <br>  When this happened to me I was lucky, our school had a 'buddy' system, where the seniors helped the juniors out with any problems etc, it was great, my buddy was brilliant and even though she was 5 years older than me we have stayed great friends!<br>  You should possibly suggest this to your school!? It really did work.<br>  I think your mum could probably do more than just 'cheer you up'?<br>  My mum was at the school every week trying to sort this, don't lie to teachers etc, tell them exaclty what is going on!<br>  Good Luck!!<br>  Hope I helped! =)|`|nKSmgjylaa	Tell your teacher, parents and principal and have them sort it!|`|oA8Rtyxuaa	That's horrible! Im so sorry to hear that! She is probably mean to you because she is jealous of something that you hae and she doesn't. She is insecure about herself. i know that doesn't really help you in any way :( I would probably just act like it doesn't bother you. If she sees that it isn't bothering you, she might stop because she isn't getting a rise out of you. I hope this helps a little!

First of all, is there maybe a different route you could use to walk home, I know it's a lame suggestion but it could maybe help. I was bullied a bit when walking home and talked to my friends who agreed to walk the same way as me, I guess you could try that, because that way there is less chance of Leah and her friends being cruel to you because if you are with someone else they may stop a bit on the way home. <br>  <br>  In terms of the staring and glaring at you, just try and ignore it I know it's not as simple as that but it can really help. They're being really cruel to you but if they know that you are getting upset or irritated then I will continue, so try and ignore some of their cruel bitching.<br>  <br>  If you hear them bitching about you stick up for yourself, tell them you heard it and it will shock them, they may even stop bitching about you altogether. <br>  <br>  About the physical abuse-speak in private to your tutor and ask them of they can monitor any cruel behaviour in lessons, that way if these people are caught then they will be punished. <br>  <br>  Finally try and make a new friend who isn't friends with this Leah person who you can confide to and for them to be their as emotional support, maybe not a compleatly new friend but someone else.<br>  <br>  These things have helped me personally and now the people who used to bully me don't. I hope this has helped you, and good luck.<br>  <br>  :)|`|eBqyFgjvaa	Hi<br>  u probably feel alone in all this is it worth telling a teacher if she does anything more serious?

VTB5QpyBaa	My daughter had eczema on her arms and legs. My doctor told me to use Aquaphor, and the Aveeno baby wash. The Aquaphor worked great. I applied it twice a day and used Aveeno baby lotion in between. The best thing to do is keep him moisturized all day. My doctor also told me to keep bathing her everyday but only in lukewarm water and for 5 minutes, and apply the Aquaphor when her skin is still damp. It worked like a charm for my daughter. It took about two weeks for most of the eczema to go away, now its barely there. Good luck I hope this helps!|`|1SGl03Zlaa	My 18 month old has eczema.  The doctor gave us some prescription cream for it and said not to use soap in the bath.  He also recommended the aveeno skin cream and I found one that says on it can be used for eczema.

It really has helped but you have to give it some time it'll take a couple of weeks to clear up.|`|mx3gFmIKaa	Yes, my 2.5 yr old has chronic eczema severely that began at 2 months.<br>  <br>  The dermatologist and allergists recommend the following:<br>  <br>  All free and clear, double rinse<br>  aveeno bodywash, aveeno sunscreen<br>  bath every other or every 3 days<br>  run a humidifier<br>  use cetaphil cream in the tub not the pump 2x daily.  Apply immediately after bathing to seal in moisture.  Alot of docs recommend Eucerin or Aquaphor, we weren't succesful with either.  The dermatologist and allergist said no.  These contain lanolin, a wool derivative and known irritant.<br>  <br>  We began using over the counter cortisone 10 extra strength ointment 1 percent.  Use sparingly 2x/day should clear up within 1 week<br>  If you find yourself using it more days of the month than not, he needs something stronger<br>  <br>  My son has had prescription hydrocortisone 2.5 percent (low potency), hydrocortisone aclovate (medium potency), hydrocortisone valerate (medium potency) and trieminsimilone (high potency), he also has step down cream Elidel, he also has medicated shampoo, Nizoral<br>  <br>  We also use benadryl and atarax for itching, but consult the doc on that, it causes sedation and is used cautiously in toddlers under 1<br>  <br>  Calendula is over the counter and good for any skin irritation, its made from marigold flowers<br>  <br>  It flares up in the winter, and when the baby is ill.<br>  <br>  Suggest being cautious with vaccines.

uMIvRRjoaa	Breastfeeding will help protect your LO. As for meds you can take:<br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/health/meds/cold-remedy.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/health/meds/cold...</a><br>  <br>   Treat your symptoms. Plain sudafed is actually pseudoephedrine- which *can* cause supply problems. Phenylephrine is another, now more common, decongestant (at least in some states where you have to go to the pharmacy to get sudafed due to meth use grr) which is safe to use and isn't linked with supply issues. Anyways, tuck baby in bed with you to nurse, rest, get plenty of fluids, and eat healthy. <br>  <br>  I hope you're all doing better soon.|`|oXIYHsDaaa	Wash your hands lots. If you get sick just make sure to nurse lot to pass on the antibodies to your baby and hopefully she wont get it. (Breast milk is an amazing thing, she probably wont get it if you are nursing exclusively) If you get it, you can take tylenol or advil and some say sudafed is ok but, talk to your pharmacist (pharmacists are drug experts, doctors are illness experts, when it comes to drugs pharmacists usually know better) I'm really sick right now too, my husband brought it home from school and now I have it bad, the kids seem to be ok so I'm keeping my fingers crossed. My almost 5 month old has apnea so I try to avoid taking anything except tylenol just before bed after she is down for the night. I use saline nose spray for my nose and honey to soothe my sore throat. Increasing the humidity is the house helps a lot too, use a cool mist humidifier or a heat exchanger on your clothes dryer, or even just a big pot of boiling water on the stove will help.|`|vue9NOhYaa	There is no cure for a cold.  If you're already showing symptoms, it's too late to prevent it.  <br>  <br>  Your baby may catch it too, but by breatsfeeding you are doing the best thing you can to protect her.  She's been getting antibodies via the milk, so if she DOES catch it, she'll probably have a very mild cold.<br>  <br>  As for you ... most cold meds can affect your supply, so it's best to not take anything. (Advil or tylenol is fine for aches and pains.)   If you feel you really need something, take JUST what you need --- simple remedies that treat just the symptoms you have, not 'shot-gun' meds that treat a million symptoms. (Plain Sudafed or simple cough syrups are best.)|`|0IPxeDJiaa	Basically you can't take anything while nursing.  You need to eat well, drink lots of fluids and get LOTS of rest.   You can talk to your doc.  Some docs say you can take Tylenol....but check with yours.
9580a1e44dd3d2bae7d2f867611ab353aa	? for the 1st question.. Lots of things could go wrong to cause someone to have to have a C-Section. In my case, I went into a regular doc appointment when I was 36 weeks, and my blood pressure got to 160/100 so the doc immediately put me in the hospital, did an emergency c-section (cut from belly button down).. I was even allowed to leave to go get some things from home. He said he did it is so quickly because he was wanting to avoid a life saving situation, because with my BP being so high and out of hand, it could have resulted in the baby not making it, and myself not making it.. He did not want to push it nor wait any longer.|`|joPJtKemaa	A few things could happen to result in a C Section.<br>  <br>  The baby poops inside, or you can get a high fever during delivery, or your blood pressure sky rockets, or drops.|`|7031265d0531963ae96124dd73a8cd85aa	If the baby's head is down but they're looking in either direction I'm pretty sure that it's okay and the baby can still come out vaginally. <br>  <br>  Alot of things can result in an emergency or unexpected C-section...the baby being too tangled in the cord and having the contractions cause the baby to be pulled too tightly (this would cause the baby's heart rate to slow during contractions which is how they would tell that the baby was under stress). Also, a friend of mine had to have her baby sectioned because she was in labor for 24 hours with hard contractions but they just weren't progressing her labor or dilating her cervix any more so they decided that a C-section would be best. <br>  My sister in law had to have a C-section with her first because when they broke her waters they realized that tehre was meconium in the amniotic fluid. <br>  <br>  There are several reasons for C-sections, but most likely, if your doctor hasn't mentioned it yet, you'll be able to safely deliver your baby vaginally (very soon too!). [<br>  <br>  Good luck and congrats on the impending birth!

f1c3e4fed0bc8c4bf3636c69cd65cebfaa	OK, obviously you were trying to be responsible and used a condom. Things happen. If you don't want to wait for the doctor, go get another HPT, preferably a different brand than the first one.      It is her decision what to do if she is pregnant.  However, you have a right to voice your opinion.  Just support her in her choice.  Don't listen to everyone else on here who says abortion is murder and so forth. Early stages of pregnancy the EMBRYO is nothing more than a parasite. I know its an ugly word, but it is true.  If it can't sustain life on its own, that is what it is.     Next time, just consider all the consequences before you have sex.  I agree with the guy who said abortion is not a form of birth control.  It isn't.  It is there for situations like this, where the pair is being responsible, however something beyond their control happens.   Good luck to you both no matter what you choice to do!|`|368008361e77a77ceeb8c70a92a3c2b8aa	if that's the road you both want to follow....then yes - the earlier the abortion the better for your girlfriend's health....physically & mentally.|`|1m9cWAEhaa	you need to take another test  and abortion is not the answer|`|djAyXS9Iaa	take another test|`|w9SW2jXoaa	seems like you kind of dont have a heart the way you have said about the abortion,it is best not to put things like that on here about abortion because there are poor people on here trying to concieve and just cant who i feel for then there are people like you and your girlfriend who can get pregnant just like that and cant wait to book an abortion,i know you couldnt help the condom splitting but next time just go abit gentle,but the answer to your question is that ull just have to wait and see.|`|eGW4X9pgaa	you won't know until the test results get back ...  there are only 3 days out of the month that the average woman can conceive ...    getting sick could just be from worrying about it ...    I know you were trying to be responsible by using a condom, but try multiple forms of birth control from now on ...|`|o8xNTVWTaa	go get a hpt to see if u cant wait... sex can always result in a baby and now what just get rid of it pretend it didn't happen ? hopefully u aren't making this decision for her its her body and as i see it u really don't have a say in her decision|`|UboqOekCaa	i dont know, sorry.  your gonna have to wait   but fingers crossed for you!|`|KNYF1hnhaa	Ummm has anyone told you that abortion is NOT birth control?

Wtf do you think? Do we have phychic powers and can tell you positive if a test didn't even do that?  Do another test.|`|hHN93lwuaa	dude she probably isnt.. she should have been ont he pill anyway|`|FgAPXhVRaa	ugh well slow down there...  you might need to consider the fact that she might not want an abortion. Trust me, it's easy to say that you will have one... and then when you actually find out that you are carrying a baby... and that it is her own flesh and blood she might change her mind... Finding out that you are pregnant is a huge deal... you need to be supportive and instead of asking well when can we book an abortion, you need to ask her what you can do to help her.   But to answer your question, I think that the earliest you can book one is five weeks. They do a sono and show you the sac... and my friend also said they did a mini psych exam on her... to make sure that this is what she really wanted.   I chose not to have an abortion and my ex walked away, I wish that he would have been more supportive. When you have sex... a baby is always a risk no matter what precautions you take... Remember, if she is pregnant... you created life... do you really want to kill it?|`|RR7UX4jkaa	Abortion?  Jeez man.....I want go into my views on that ....but more than likely she is. Now get ready for the emotional toll of an abortion/cost/etc.  Good luck dude! and hey,  maybe she isn't. Don't worry. Everything will work out in the end. Be strong|`|F2LI7zjraa	you have 2 wait and see|`|60factSoaa	o.O    how about adoption instead, if she is pregnant?|`|tIFDvOVBaa	some of u men r idiots, why is it the first sign of any responsibility you run, thats ur kid ur gonna kill and you dongt seem to even care one bit dont f****** have sex if u dont want to face the consequences abortion doesnt have to be the answer     What if ur gf wants to keep it??|`|M4nXH7DTaa	wait till u get the resaults that pretty much it|`|QuokZhuqaa	Well I suggest ask a doctor before anything and there's another option than having an abortion. I mean abortion is cruel. You should just have the baby and go to the adoption agency to drop the baby off.      (:|`|BGsW0wq7aa	It depends on how long after sex you took the test, and how long ago you had sex. As for her feeling sick that could down to stress and worry that making her feel like that. Chances are she isn't i think|`|HZvo9YFHaa	she may or may not be! if so you can do an abortion til she 16 weeks.|`|vd9FzDVhaa	1st off, it's her decision on whether or not she should have an abortion.    2nd: Take an electronic test, but it will only work about 3, 4 days before her first missed period.     3rd: If you went to the doctor, you should take a blood test. They will tell you immediately.    4th: Don't have sex with anyone you wouldn't mind getting pregnant.|`|djFYf3qUaa	you're stupiddddd.  babies are helpless....you're stupid for wanting to have an abortion..|`|fccdcaa6e1aa306a88110de27284c970aa	Please dont get an abortion if you guys cant afford any thing then give it up for adoption please let me know if she is pregnant at katherineajsexy@aol.com please

I hope someone can tell us some good info about it! Thanks for asking it!! Lots of baby dust!!! xxxx|`|ApyrV5J9aa	I like the answer about sinking/floating. I've never heard that before but I think it may work! Anyways, this is TMI as well, but we tried for a long time so I got used to looking at all of this stuff. For me left over sperm looked slimy/watery and my CM looked more like snot...as strange as that sounds. My sister-in-law said the same thing so I don't think I'm crazy :) Anyways, the sperm break down the longer it is inside of you so the next day it should appear to be some moisture with little form. Also, it is correct that if your husband has a normal sperm count, having sex every day is more beneficial than every other day per my doctor, my research and my success. Best of luck to you!|`|373b04f6dbf649a6ef357e85b32df3e4aa	Hey huni!<br>  <br>  I was wondering this myself, I think with CM it's thicker, and I can tell when it's sperm I have to wear a pad as the day after it does smell a bt minging.<br>  <br>  Also sperm will look more liquidy, where as CM looks a bit more... stretchy lol..<br>  <br>  Can't think of a nice way to describe LOL! Here's a star though because I wanted to ask but didn't know how hehe<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK TTC xxxxx

How do teeth affect intelligence?|`|vue9NOhYaa	Old wives tale.<br>  <br>  <br>  Teething is mostly genetic, and has no relationship to intelligence.
vue9NOhYaa	Is he happy and healthy?  Gaining weight appropriately?  Self-feeding most of his solids?  If so, he's eating what he wants and needs.|`|Bww3poJNaa	No you are doing fine! Maybe cut out the snack at 8 p.m. If he just ate at 5 or 6 if he is not hungry don't give him a snack after that give him milk or something to drink.|`|WPI0Z47saa	My son used to eat like a little piggy when he was that age. They go through growth spurts and during those times you may find yourself wondering where they are putting it all. What you are feeding him sounds fine and healthy. Don't worry about how much they eat as long as they aren't becoming overweight. Kids are very active and burn calories very quickly.|`|NbJbZXtGaa	No more than 16 ounces day of formula, and that's fine. If he is taking more than that, you need to cut back on the formula. You could also switch form formula to whole milk, but same thing, limit the milk to about 16-20 ounces a day.|`|w7FSmSTnaa	everything sounds fine except the formula. they dont need it after the age of 12 months he needs reg. vitamin d milk in order to get the proper porteins, fats, and vitamins|`|Q8amh0rUaa	if he is getting fat, then yes|`|eC1dQVcgaa	No, my 12 month old has<br>  <br>  7:30 - Porridge with cooked apple (a BIG bowl) then banana<br>  10:30 - rusk Or cheese sticks<br>  13:00 - 2 Fish fingers, potatoe star carrots, sprouts, parsnips etc.. <br>  15:00 - goodies crisps (you know kid's ones)<br>  17:30 - Some kind of meat with sauce or fish tuna pasta, spag bowl etc that kind of thing.. <br>  <br>  She then has her cows milk for bed, and quite oftern a bottle in the day time, but she hardly ever finishes it.. But drinks 2 bottles if not more of water a day!!! =]<br>  <br>  So no i don't think he eats too much, keep it up.. As long as it is not junk and he is not over weight.. Good Job i say!! lol|`|F4Ks8UsIaa	I have been told that children do not over eat like adults do.  I feed my son until he no longer wants anymore.  If he is 12 months old he should be off of formula, try whole milk.  Some days my son eats me out of house and home.  Other days I can not get him to take a bite of anything.  Children eat when they are hungry!  Besides if it you think it is a lot then he might be going through a little growth spurt.  I am sure he is fine!|`|7XBoIgd6aa	If hes hungery no but I'd watch the sugar and fat intake...talk to your doctor there might be a reason why hes so hungry|`|AA11612508	seems like it alittle bit. my daughter didnt eat that much, probably helf of that.|`|t2X3lBCYaa	Nope!<br>  It's extremely GOOD that he eat's enough his lil body is growing!|`|c4XBHw6laa	it sond like he eat alot lol but na i no lots of ppl who eats more den that lol
Yn6pM2Xyaa	I'm 18 days overdue myself.. my best advice since I know exactly how you feel as far as wanting to know what the heck is going on is this:  if you are going to try to wait out your insurance coming into effect then make sure you are taking folic acid and/or prenatal vitamins.. eat healthy and basically act as if you are pregnant.. that way if you are then you have done your best..  find out how long its going to be for insurance to come into effect specifically.. if you're talking about like 2-3 weeks and you feel comfortable waiting it out then do so.. but perhaps call an office and find out to the best of their knowledge how expensive it would be for you to see doctor and get blood test done.  that way you know what your backup plan is if you suddenly can't wait any longer or find out there is a huge delay in getting insurance covereage.  If you have and pain that is severe see a doctor or hospital immediately as you could have a tubal pregnancy, otherwise if you are pregnant you should be fine.  Definitely sounds like there is a chance you could be one of those 1% that doesnt leech enough HCG into pee to show on tests..  I'm hoping to be one too!  I am going to doctor this afternoon to get results from blood work myself..  if I am not pregnant doctor has already told me to wait until a full missed cycle has passed and then book into office for further investigation..  I wish you all the best in this and if I see you around online later posting again I'll try to let you know what my results were.. like I said, I'm late, no signs of period and all signs of pregnancy but all BFN's.|`|ESAM0U7xaa	save yourself all the heartache of worrying and go to your local health dept for a test! tell them you need a blood test and are REALLY late! and starting to get concerned. i had to use the health dept once when i was younger because i was sick and couldn't afford a doc, plus my insurance at work had not kicked in.<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK! <br>  the more you stress the longer it will take for your period to come, that is if you are NOT preggo.|`|5ci9IZd2aa	It does sound like your pregnant, but it could be other things since the test is negative your cramping is of concern, could be a tubular pregnancy, not trying to scare you, but if you start any type of abnormal bleeding go to the hospital. Many clinics and Planned  Parenthoods offer free or low cost pregnancy tests,since money is a concern, But you should find out, to keep yourself safe.|`|6TQFahm4aa	first of all, don't go crazy :)  You definately sound like you could be preggo, but you also sound like your hormones may just be all out of wack.  If you are trying to conceive, then you may be tricking your body! I know it sounds wierd, but my best friend has been trying too, and it's got her periods all messed up. I found out i was pregnant the first day of my missed period, but that's not to say that you aren't different.  Honestly your best bet it to see some kind of a doc.  Also, if you live in a place where there is a health dept they will see you for free usually and they have nurse practicioners that can help shed some light on your situation. Good luck!

OI3bf4yjaa	No, I don't think that is a good reason at all. If a parent is trying to teach a child right from wrong, "because I said so" isn't going to help. When parents get their kids in trouble for doing something that they shouldn't be doing, they should provide reasons! When the child knows the reasons for him/her being punished, it will be easier for them to understand to not do it again. "Because I said so" is usually used by parents when a child asks to do something. I remember my mother saying that to me ALL the time whenever I asked to go out with some friends. She didn't like the group of friends I hung out with, and she never told me. If she just sat me down and explained to me WHY she didn't want me to hang out with my friends, and WHY she didn't like them..then I would have understood her A LOT more clearly. <br>  <br>  It's all about understanding and communication. Saying "because I said so" is neither of those two things.|`|1tmX7xbRaa	because a parent thinks a child will just accept that reasoning but the truth is kids (or teens) need to understand WHY otherwise they are just going to ignore it (at least i did when i was young).|`|XEGG1l6Raa	they say that because they don't know what else to say|`|0d48efb9bb3ec04d1446c03dc1edcde3aa	It is a latino thing my friend... "I said so" is spanish for "just do it and don't argue"....lol<br>  <br>  Cheers =)|`|AA10953561	Yes, sadly I do think this is an acceptable answer. I have a six year old as well, and while I don't say "because I said so" every time, I do say it. Generally, I use it when I've had the "why?" question thrown at my several times after I tell my daughter to do something. I don't mind explaining the first time, but she's not always satisfied with my explanation so then I go to the "because I said so" defense.<br>  <br>  If it's a simple request like "Put your heavy coat on." and she aks why I say "because I said so" because she argues that it doesn't feel cold to her outside. As parents, we do most of the time know what is in the best interest of the child and the child should just listen. If it were a really off the wall request then I have no problem explaining why.|`|rSWX0CZ7aa	Well, maybe if it's something obvious like you telling them to do their chores, or put their coat on.  They know why you're asking them, but they only ask why because they don't want to do it.  But if it's something they really don't understand then you should explain it to them.  They're a lot more likely to comply with you if they actually know why you're asking them to do/not to do something.|`|PxawVQ7Xaa	When they say that it just shows that they don't have reason, some parents just like to abuse their authority, it's the same as "my house, my rules", it's because they really don't have reason, they probably just don't want to admit that they were wrong.|`|nfzQkvqraa	Because I said so is a horrible reason.<br>  <br>  But every once in a blue moon when I feel like ripping my hair out and my blood pressure is somewhere near the rooftop I say "Because I said so." <br>  <br>  Usually when I calm down a little later I will give the real reason why I said no.|`|lONUiE0raa	its a real bad answer but sometimes thats the only excuse there seems to be..sit down some time and try to write on a piece  of paper all the other excuses or reasons you can use..even make some up if you have to. thats what i do when i have to tell my little cousins something like that or need some reason not to let them do whatever it is that theyre doing that is bothering me|`|45nSn7Rcaa	Oh get over it...the reason you listen when told by your parent is "Because they said so"...obviously they did more than that if you know common sense and why something is wrong to do.|`|8n3NvYQwaa	"because I said so" in a mommy and daddy thingy...  It means...  I said what I said because I am the grown up and you are the kid..   so get used to it....   Grant M|`|TSsT8QGgaa	actually i use the phrase "because im your MOTHER and I said so".  my house my rules|`|tle3AGJraa	I think because I said so is okay in certain situations.  If it's a situation where you should already know the reason's why, then because I said so is good.  But telling a 2 year old not to run across the street after a ball because I said so isn't appropriate.  The two year old needs to be taught why it's dangerous to run across the street after a ball and what can happen if he does so.....many more times than once.<br>  <br>  Now telling a 6 year old not to run across the street because I said so, is a good reason.|`|SRsFkNBBaa	usually when i say that phrase, it is one of 2 things:: they are nagging me and i am extremely busy doing something else. i have already answered them, but the just won't quit.<br>  <br>  #2 reason, i don't think my kids are ready for the answer., or its an answer that is none of their buissness.<br>  my 8 year old: why can't you buy me the xbox for $350.00 dollars?  instead of explaining that dad is laid off, and mommy is at her limit, that phrase is appropriate. my kids don't need to know where our money goes, or how much we have.|`|qtwhZnnVaa	Nopeee.|`|PpWosZsIaa	From Your Parents, yes, that is all that's needed. You need to obey your Parents.|`|sxecXFgraa	For a toddler maybe, but as the kids get older, no.  A parent needs to actually explain why to so the kid will understand why and maybe reduce the chance of the kid doing it behind their parents back.
Bg6txvxqaa	No, it won't affect the baby at all, just remember that you can't take anything other than paracetemol every now and then.<br>  <br>  The best thing I did when I had a bad cold a few weeks ago, was drink warm squash with a spoonful of honey in it.<br>  <br>  Really soothed my throat and seemed to help a lot!<br>  <br>  Hope you feel better soon!|`|EWhPNsnKaa	good advice Kelli|`|PYtJ2GoFaa	No, it won’t hurt your baby at all. Actually, many women get more colds when they are pregnant then when not. It has something to do with the baby lowering your body’s ability to fight colds, etc. (lowered immunity). Not to worry.<br>  <br>  Just drink lots of fluids and take care of  you. Drink some OJ if your heartburn is not too bad. If it gets worse, your doctor can write a Rx that is safe for you and your baby.

Take it with your first urination of the morning as that is when your HCG hormone levels will be highest and the test is more likely to be accurate.|`|ztzEloj5aa	take a test<br>  its the most annoying answer- yes i know<br>  i know your looking for experiences from other women but you will not get that here- all your going to get is the answer- take a test- sorry but its true- people don't want to share their experiences- they only want to tell you take a test- its sad- why ask the question if that is the answer you are going to get?<br>  people on here cant and wont help you out except give you the most obvious answer|`|hoX7hoINaa	If you're able to fill a tampon the chances are that you got your period and you're not pregnant.

hGY08GjRaa	"That's the Pot calling the Kettle Black" is a common expression meaning you are accusing someone of something that you are also guilty of.<br>  <br>  So, in 13 going on 30, Jenna was upset with tom-tom for doing something really bad, but Tom-Tom knew Jenna had done the EXACT SAME THING.. so she sasy "Oh.. which one do you want to be today.. the pot or the kettle? I think I'll be the kettle.. actually it doesn't matter because they're both BLACK"  She meant "Don't pretend to be innocent and get  mad at me, you did the same thing I did.."|`|AA12096847	It comes from the the saying, "That's a pot calling the kettle black."   This refers to accusing a person of something for which you are equally at fault.  Since both the pot and the kettle are equally black.

No need to cause controversy!|`|xEXb96UKaa	i'm seeing exactly what i expected to see. i'm 29 but i remember being 12 and i would have done the exact same stuff those kids are doing if i would have been left without my parents and onlly a bunch of other kids that age. i think a lot of the kids will appreciate their parents a lot more when they get back home for all the things mum and dad do for them.|`|JmD0oq2Naa	i watched it. i found some of the kids really annoying. especially that taisha. and how pathetic was it when that charlie girl started crying because lorna wouldnt wash her dishes|`|dq16ybzgaa	I'm a 16 year old girl. Although yes there was bullying, fighting etc going on I don't think it caused any long term harm to the children. <br>  <br>  I actually think it is a good reflection of the real world- people aren't always nice and you don't have a parent or teacher with you all the time to intervene when people are nasty or to tell you what to do. You have to learn to think independently and think how your actions affect other people too. How would I feel if he/she treated me the way I treat them?<br>  <br>  There is a growing number of parents who mollycoddle their children as long as they can and then when these kids reach their teen years they find the transition from a small primary to secondary very difficult and things like this. The friendly atmosphere you have always known is replaced by a confusing, lonely place. <br>  <br>  I hope it makes everyone aware not just parents that children should know that bullying, fighting, reckless behaviour and violence does go on in the world. Independent thinking should be promoted more, instead of relying on other older influences to fight your battles and make your choices for you.<br>  <br>   I think that although it wouldn't be beneficial to every child neither would it be harmful and that most would learn good skills in self-reliance, how to stand up for themselves and think using their own initiative.|`|xp4mhkqgaa	I enjoyed watching it, and found it quite interesting.  It was good to see how boys and girls differ, and how they coped differently withthe situation.  I thought it was quite funny when, I think it was just the second day, most of the boys were crying for their mums, because they were so hungry and didn't know how to cope.  Whereas the girls were all sitting down at the table to have spaghetti bolognaise.  <br>  <br>  I didn't enjoy watching the bullying between the girls though, and also the boys (to a lesser extent, though).  But, luckily they seemed to calm down and get on alright once they had settled into their new environment.  <br>  <br>  My 11 year old son watched the series with me, too, and he enjoyed it.  He keeps asking me if he can go on it if they do another show.  I'd love to see how he would cope, and hopefully make him realise just how much I do for him, but I wouldn't actually let him.|`|OCf7y5FKaa	I'm 15 and honestly I thought it was hilarious, not entertaining. I did not learn anything from it seeing as the children featured are a lot younger.<br>  I found the group dynamic interesting and found that it mirrored something in primary.<br>  I also agree that it was harsh for these REAL people to have their personal lives on TV when they're bearly preteenagers.<br>  The romance between the two..EIGHT(?) y/o's was INGENUIS! ahahaa i laughed.

But, there's always a 50/50 chance it could be wrong ya know?  I am a healthy young 22, had no problems conceiving and my maternal instinct told me from a few months on he was a boy!  Your body is the best resource for answers and being right ;)|`|1tmX7xbRaa	i didn't have help getting pregnant with either of my (2) girls and the chinese chart said girls for both|`|CJ3XHvIDaa	well mines says im having a BOY! but this is my first pregnancy and I dont know yet what im having, but i'll see soon!!! xD|`|IWinNj2saa	Nope, told me I was having 3 girls, I have 3 boys.

smsUZG4Iaa	its very hard to tell by checking your cervix if your pregnant, you'd have to check it everyday to see if the changes are relevant.. the cramping could be implantation but all i can say is try to relax and not think about it so much.. Best of Luck|`|fWAzJIEkaa	Sweetie..Never loose ur hopes =)<br>  My Af was due on Sunday, and my boobs were sore and had cramping..i thought, it be here anytime soon... and never showed..

I actually was about 8 weeks pg when I found out b/c I kept having AF symptoms and didn't even think about being pg. I just kept waiting for AF to show up! So, to answer your question..I think it could be implanting. From what I've read and experienced the beginning stages of pg are a lot like a period.|`|umdKUxSDaa	i felt that exact same way and i tested 8 days after my period was supposed to be here, and it was positive. sadly it ended as a miscarriage:(<br>  bby dust to you and i both..<br>  <br>  i think i'm pregnant again.|`|ZbnxGIsnaa	Well, we will see if I end up pregnant or not, but at 4 dpo.  I had this odd pinching but cramping feeling that would go from side to side on my abdomen/pubic region and would last for like 4 seconds each.  Are you having that same thing?<br>  <br>  Cramping is normal at this stage dear.  That's actually a very very good thing.  Don't worry JUST yet.  =)|`|eS68lGulaa	wait till u miss a period...then take a test...SIMPLE
pJFb4LRlaa	I got confused on this too. But when my doctor told me i was 8 weeks pregnant, i told her that was impossible because i hadn't had sex 8 weeks ago. it was 6 weeks ago. But, she went to explain that they add two weeks, starting from the last day of your period. Basically they are considering you pregnant from when your eggs drop--before they are fertilized. Which is approximately 14 days before. anyway, i know that's confusing. it confused me too. but the ultrasound probably says 37 because it is calculating from the last day of your period. Your doctor probably told you 35 because she is telling you how long your eggs have been fertilized by the sperm. anyway, best of luck to you!!!|`|cn91FeWcaa	ultrasound|`|7273c2f9619f41237bda5553ffcdd9ddaa	Your uterus may be measuring bigger than the number of weeks you are.  The baby may be bigger, so that is why it is saying 37 weeks and the doctor 35.  I would think the ultrasound is more accurate but I don't know.
G2auAv1Saa	Those numbers aren't horrible, but they want them under 120. It is strange that she jumped up hour 2 from hour 1 that is odd. Usually they do the test around 28-30 weeks, but at least you did it and know now. Don't be too worried, make sure she follows all of the doctors instructions and diets as suggested. I have diabetes when im not pregnant and gestational when im pregnant and as long as she listens and follows the directions her and the baby will be perfectly fine.|`|98WKYtfwaa	It's not that bad, they usually want it to be under 120. <br>  <br>  Too late for what? She will just have to change her diet and possibly be induced a week or 2 before her due date.|`|9580a1e44dd3d2bae7d2f867611ab353aa	? normal is less than 95 mg/dL. According to ADA guidelines, a woman with an abnormal FPG should be retested the next day<br>  <br>  Many women with gestational diabetes can control their blood sugar level by changing the way they eat.<br>  <br>  Treatment for gestational diabetes also includes checking your blood sugar level at home and seeing your doctor regularly.<br>  <br>  You may need to give yourself insulin shots to help control your blood sugar. This man-made insulin adds to the insulin that your body makes.<br>  <br>  ** her doctor should make a plan for her, on what to do, some can just change diet, other have to take meds, not its not to late to get this on track, usually people with this have slight bigger babies, or my have to deliver a little early, but under a doctors care, things should go smoothly...|`|mbvpWNMeaa	Those numbers are certainly in a range to show gestational diabetes.  In that context however, they are not critically bad.  It is not too late for treatment/monitoring to  lead to a healthy outcome and a live birth.  Do what your doctor recommends, and if you are not sure what to do, ask the doctor or his/her nurse what to do.|`|75HzIpSraa	The numbers are high! The doctor should recommend a diet for her to follow to keep her sugar at a desirable range, she hopefully can keep it under control without insulin!

Sooo Cute!!|`|34VXCyvVaa	How do you pronounce your last name?  "UTZ-ler"?  The "-tsler" combination is a mouthful, so a simpler first name might balance it out better.  <br>  <br>  I don't care for any of your girl's names, but Addie, Evie or Caleigh all sound better with the last name than Lilly.  Caleigh Paige Eutsler seems to have the best flow, IMO.  I love the John tradition in your family and think that's worth keeping.  John Aiden sounds better than John Logan, although both names are nice.  Jacob Lee is also a nice combination.  The Connor Eutsler combination doesn't work particularly well because the names sound too repetitive with both names having two syllables and ending in the "-er" sound.|`|SfwLF8j2aa	I love Addison,Michelle is ok<br>  Caleigh is very cute!

se27sAUwaa	Could it be gas?? When my friend was pregnant she had terrible gas pains. She was actually hospitalized about a week after conceiving b/c she still had "gas pockets" that were extremely painful.  <br>  <br>  Or it could just be that baby needs more room so your feeling some stretching. It doesn't hurt to give your OB a call, just in case.|`|sAbah6dTaa	sounds like it could be your uterus expanding making room for the baby! =)|`|jlrfkXj2aa	i'm 34 weeks and have been getting a pain low in the front... kinda where my ovaries are.. if this is the pain your talking about, my dr. just wrote it off when I told him about it. I assume its just your uterus stretching... but it kills, makes it hard for me to get out of bed. :(|`|ACc1skbPaa	Most likely very normal stretching due to a growing healthy baby!  Your ligaments and muscles and joints are all very loose in order to accomodate your changing body and eventual delivery and sometimes even the slightest move can give you a twinge of pain and it can also make it easier to pull a muscle or ligament without really doing much...just move slowly (I know by now that is not difficult to do, trust me) and be careful when exercising or reaching for things that normally would be no big deal...good luck...<br>  PS: If it becomes something more or comes in waves or is really bothering you, always check with the OB! That's what they are there for and they would want to know even if you think it is silly or no big deal!
hlWdFTcjaa	Im not sure about the Discover Plan but my mum lost 11 stone on weight watchers so it is very effective.

PN7ELn3aaa	Buy a few larger shirts. For the skirt, cut the waistband off and sew an elastic band in its place. I know they are expensive and this is not an appealing option, but it will be comfy and you will be able to grow. :) Many women do this with their jeans. You could also buy a "belly band" which is just basically a very thick elastic band that you wear around your midsection that holds your open pants/skirt closed and up around your waist. You can get one from target.com for 20 bucks.|`|4qlNDbNLaa	Perhaps you can find the pieces seperate and "make" your uniform. I would look in maternity stores for white polo shirts and the skirts you may be able to find on line. I would try old navy for the shirts, maybe even the skirt as well.    good luck|`|QMxEjCpiaa	School girl uniforms for when you get pregnant ... I don't think they sell them anywhere. Have you talked with your guidance counsler at school and maybe they can make an exception with you wearing non-uniform clothes. In a few weeks, you'll be showing much more and people will find out if that is what you are trying to prevent.
be5076c0b98b495ffe00aade08f96b65aa	It's a 50/50 chance. Your going to have to fess up to your fiance, because no one on here can tell you the odds and be correct. I mean unprotected sex with both partners, who would know? You can either wait it out, and then see what happens. OR you can do yourself and your fiance a favor by telling him upfront, getting the DNA test, and then making whoever is the father step up. If your fiance wants the baby regardless...good for him. Although, if it is your ex's, you shouldn't keep him from his child, unless he's given you due reason to. I mean you also can't expect your fiance to pay for a kid that's not his, if he doesn't want it. That's selfish. Not criticizing, just giving you some blunt advice.|`|8Cvv86Jeaa	the closest date that you gave to what your due date would be would be the may 25th. But it still doesn't add up.

If this is the estimate they gave you after measuring the baby, (s)he may be larger than normal rather than actually being 29 weeks old.  Have you  been tested for gestational diabetes?  That condition can cause babies to grow very large.  <br>  <br>  I do not see how you could be 6 weeks along with a viable pregnancy (which is where you would have been at the time of the August test if you are really at 29 weeks now) and still get a negative test.  <br>  <br>  It is possible that your hormone levels were too low for the July test and the August test was defective.

I started him on veggies when he was 6 months old, and fruits after he had gotten a taste of several veggies.  <br>  <br>  That's what I did, but this is something you should talk to your baby's doctor about and do your own research on.|`|ay8tXLD2aa	Agree with above response, but would suggest making your own foods. It takes a few minutes to boil some fruits or veggies, mash or puree them and put them in an ice cube tray to freeze.  Pop one out an hour before feeding time and you have nutritious food - much better than jarred food. <br>  <br>  Ideally 6 months is the time to start feeding your baby solids, as long as at 6 months they are ready. babies need nothing more than milk for 6 months. Yes, cereal is solid food.  Go slowly, as for the first year milk is most important; solids are for fun, learning, and getting used to the idea of new tastes and flavours.  Don't pressure your baby, keep it fun and light and think of the new foods as "bonus" nutrition, as s/he is getting all of her nutrition from milk at the moment.|`|AA12174734	my daughter eats two meals of baby food a day plus her bottles <br>  <br>  if you do introduce jarred food do it every 3-5 days to make sure she doesnt have a allergy to the certain food|`|vue9NOhYaa	She's already eating solid foods.  Cereal IS a solid food. <br>  <br>  Her milk intake is fine, so there's no rush.  If she loves her solids, you could offer jarred foods now. (I probalby wouldn't offer more cereal. It's likely to constipate her, and has no useful nutrients or flavors.)  If she's indifferent, you can wait a few weeks, or a month or two to offer other foods. Or you could stop cereal and try jarred foods instead.|`|eXsR8Gx5aa	If she's enjoying the cereal you could try now but if she seems satisfied with what she is having there is no rush.<br>  <br>  My son hated baby rice - he basically had a few tasters (a spoon here & there) of things like, apple, pear, sweet potato, banana etc.)<br>  <br>  When he was 6 months he was having a couple of serves of veggies a day.<br>  <br>  Now he's 7 months he has fruit & porridge at breakfast, lumpy home made foods for lunch and something like a piece of toast with phildelphia for his tea.<br>  <br>  You ca make your own, there is no need to offer a jar.
AA10943329	10 days from date it was made|`|TQW5E6olaa	My rule for rx meds is that if they aren't currently taking it, throw it out. Don't save them.
Q05rrSX4aa	Yes, that is one of the top symptoms of pregnancy.  It's mostly because the amount of blood in your body increases dramatically when you get pregnant, which leads to a lot of extra fluid getting processed through your kidneys and ending up in your bladder. Eventually, you may also feel pressure on your bladder from your growing uterus.|`|h5cFkP35aa	it's beyond normal. i pee all day and 5 times a night when i sleep. it makes you wish you had an adult diaper. haha j/k for all you serious bashers.
5k0FKWTSaa	The human body is made such that individuals are... individual!  For example, your mouth - no two mouths are exactly the same, yet they perform the same function.     The same goes for your cervix. Most cervix are pointed back (or called anteverted), but some can be pointed forward (retroverted), and some pointing straight/neutral (Axial); whilst we're not pregnant.  There;s no right or wrong way to the cervix, just like left and right-handedness...    The position of your cervix should not affect your pregnancy. In the extremely rare case, a severely retroverted uterus in a frozen pelvis (lots of scarring inside causing your pelvic organs to be stuck to one another therefore unable to move around like normal - usually due to infections) may impede the growth of the pregnant uterus,.. but it's rare.    In most cases, when the pregnant uterus grows, the position of the uterus/cervix will "right" itself, whichever way your cervix is pointing.    Usually, the only time the position of your cervix will be of note, is when you're getting your smear and the healthprofessional may find it harder to find your cervix. Otherwise, your heath is not affected at all... only the work of the smear-taker is harder! :)    What happened to your first pregnancy? Did you carry the pregnancy to term? Or did you have a miscarriage?    Miscarriages are more common before 12 weeks. Not that it cannot occur after 12 weeks, but if you make to to 12 weeks, the risks are lower after that. Most of the miscarriages that occur before 12 weeks are usually due to some genetic defects or abnormalities  or even unexplained. It's usually "one of those things" that can happen / God's will. 1/5th of pregnancies miscarries, most of them early on.    Most women, who had a miscarriage will continue to have a normal pregnancy the next time.    If you've had the misfortune of havign 3 miscarriages in a row, then it might be worth you seeing your doctor to see if there is a cause for it - although in most cases, no causes are found.    So the take home message is most will make it, and you'd do yourself a favour if you try to chill out and not stress too much. What will be will be. You should be able to do your normal activities without affecting the outcome of your pregnancy (except drink alcohol/smoke/drugs/ certain medications)... but if you are worried, then take things easy and most importantly, RELAX/ de-stress!    Good luck! :)|`|9hrJfhIIaa	Your doctor will let you know if your cervix is incompetent for pregnancy. A procedure call a cerclage will be done to help keep your cervix closed if there's such a problem.|`|x4uGfC4oaa	Mine points forward, and I've been told it won't affect a pregnancy or birth. You should be fine.|`|OIiwMWEVaa	you'll probably be fine.
Ua9CZtINaa	Don't spank him, it hurts. Also take him to stuff that he likes! Give him attention more often, listen to him 100% of the time when he talks to you or his mum. Make sure you tell your friend to get him to do some activities (Football (sorry, that's soccer for you I think), swimming etc.) go out on weekends to somewhere cheap and easy and also fun. He needs more attention! He is asking for more attention because he was never GIVEN so much attention.|`|1UMBIatVaa	spanking will stop them, and letting them know that the parent is first and foremost an authority, secondary a friend. There are many possibilities for the reasons of his actions, but I would suggest Christian parent counciling or, Go to Focus on the family. They allso have a radio program you can listen too. Their group is specifically for parent counciling.    ~ God Bless and have a gr8 day!
nQ7ZcUI3aa	I think that it is beautiful.|`|2716717868fe21f32f85869cd02f81d8aa	It reminds me of the RnB singer.

If you don't mind that association, go for it. I also think Asha would be pretty and a little less ostentatious.|`|hHmoPqsBaa	It's a very pretty name. It has a nice sound to it.

Didn't learn this until about 20 mins of poking with the cathader so just beware of issues like this. I had to have no pain med. <br>  <br>  As for other complications, I did searches all over but found that they were very uncommon. Best of luck with whatever you choose.|`|9ro8fiKvaa	I think that I would have died without an epidural! If you are going to be induced (like I was) TAKE THE DRUGS!!!!! My daughter had shoulder distotia and she had the vaccuum twice ... I NEEDED the epidural. Why don't you just see how it goes and decide while you're there - in the moment? Good luck.<br>  <br>  BTW - absolutely no negative after effects, whatsoever.|`|IuJjYz6gaa	Nope.  2 epidurals and no serious complications.  Not even a back ache.|`|X6as2nOAaa	I didn't have anything go wrong with my epidural. No back aches nothing.|`|ZusC87WBaa	I've given birth 5 times and have had 5 epidurals.  No real complications after the fact except for a sore spot on my back for a week or so.  With my last baby, though, my blood pressure dropped pretty low after getting the epidural and the nurse thought she was going to have to me some medicine to counteract that.  Fortunately, my little guy was born shortly after that, so it wasn't necessary.|`|98WKYtfwaa	I've not had one, but my mum was leaking spinal fluid after it for 2 days before they realised what was wrong, they thought her spewing up, not being able to sit up or walk, having a constant headache, not being able to eat or face the light and hallucinating were all signs of a 'bad reaction' to the epidural.<br>  <br>  She got taken into surgery and was fixed up there and then, they just saved her life practically, if they didn't realise what it was when they did she would be dead now. <br>  <br>  I suppose that happened because it wasn't done correctly, but still it's enough to put me off.|`|be5076c0b98b495ffe00aade08f96b65aa	This site really breaks down the complications associated with epidurals. It starts out kinda boring, but it does get interesting. I don't think you should use this to deter you from having an epidural. Talk to your doctor about it.|`|ehvzQRkkaa	My back just stopped hurting and my son is 8 months old! My son couldn't nurse, and the epidural may have been a factor<br>  <br>  In my situation the epidural pros far outweighed the cons|`|u4FUeppNaa	i just have bad back pain, but a friend of mind ended up leaking spinal fluid because i'm guessing it wasn't done right.
NbJbZXtGaa	I think she will enjoy preschool and not have any problems at all making friends. She is at the right age for that. I know what you mean about th full day program...when I was little, preschool was like three days a week for three hours a day, and then kindergarten was 1/2 day five days a week. Now in my area they are all full day programs. It seems like a lot to me for little ones, but I guess the school s got so much backlash form parents wanting to use the public school as day care that they made all the programs full-day.|`|ZusC87WBaa	You have to do what you feel is right, but I can tell you this...not being in preschool up until this point has nothing to do with any issues she's having.  I do not at all think young children need to be socially trained or guided by any teacher other than the parent.  Not that preschool doesn't have it's benefits because it does.  2 of my boys went to preschool because they needed speech therapy and 2 of them didn't go to a day of school until they started kindergarten.  They have all done wonderfully and to be honest, I had fewer issues with the 2 that didn't go to preschool.  Again, you have to do what you feel is best, but she may end up being just as bossy at preschool.|`|0IPxeDJiaa	No one can say whether or not she will have social problems - BUT she needs to see other people than just immediate family.  <br>  <br>  You might have to pay for all day care 5x a week and only put her in part-time (half days) and see how things go.  I wouldn't worry about whether you and your DH are Christians, but hopefully you have similar values to the school.  If not, you could be sending her mixed messages.<br>  <br>  If I were you, (and I know I'm not!) I would have started to leave her with others and made sure she played nicely and learned basic rules early on.  Not that younger than this age understands all the social rules, but it lays the groundwork for later on.  If you feel she's well socialized, then your just another mom worrying if you're doing the right thing, which is completely normal :-)
LrXxwtj3aa	You need to, at the very least, be taking folic acid supplements.  Folic acid is so important for the baby, doctors think that birth defects would be reduced by 70% if more women took folic acid.  A bottle of folic acid pills is $2 at Walgreen's and they are much easier on the stomach.<br>  <br>  I know prenatal can be hard on the tummy.  I cut mine in half and take a half after I eat a meal.  This helps tremendously.  You can ask your doctor for a different type as well, that might help.  For me, the prescription pills are easier on the tummy than the ones you buy at the pharmacy.  So if you are taking store bought pills, see if you can't get a prescription for prenatals.<br>  <br>  The short answer is yes, you need to be taking your prenatals.  Your baby needs the folic acid they contain.<br>  <br>  Best of Luck!|`|LhvKTYftaa	nope you dont have to take them.  what you SHOULD take though are 2 children's chewable vitamins (without IRON, that is usually the cause of the sickness) and a folic acid pill.<br>  <br>  I couldnt take them with my son or this pregnancy.  Childrens vitamins are perfect (eat semi healthy at least) and a folic acid is all you need!!  Make sure to do tell your doc though so they can monitor your iron levels!!<br>  <br>  Good luck!!<br>  <br>  eta:  a lot of people are telling you to switch brands.  IF these make you sick, it is the iron levels, nothing will change that without removing the iron.  I highly reccomend you take the children's and a folic acid seperately.  As a plus it is much cheaper, lol...|`|yznZqcznaa	I have not been taking mine because I have been getting sick from them so I got luna bars which have 600-800 mcg of folic acid as well as other nutrients needed during pregnancy.  I would not say its an even swap but its better then nothing.|`|7031265d0531963ae96124dd73a8cd85aa	Some women don't even get a script for their pre-natals until the second trimester, which is when morning sickness should ease up. <br>  Sometimes all it takes is a change of prenatals to not make you sick anymore, but no you're not really harming the baby by not taking them. Prenatal vitamins are more for the mother anyways.. the baby is going to get the nutrients it needs from the foods you eat no matter what, but you will be the one lacking in vitamins as a result of this. <br>  You should be able to take them in your second trimester. In the meantime, you could always try taking them at night instead of in the morning, and take them AFTER dinner. That's what I have to do with mine and it usually works :)|`|joPJtKemaa	Switch to Prima-care<br>  <br>  The big purple pill. I take one pill at night and I am fine. It has this vanilla flavor to it.<br>  <br>  Other ones made me really sick.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!!!<br>  <br>  Vitamins are important to take, for both you and your child.|`|DRb4Qlypaa	Yes, it is harmful to the baby not to have a certain amount of folic acid in your diet. If they make you sick, take them at night, right before you go to bed, or take them during a meal (right in the middle)|`|cn91FeWcaa	yes my doctor told me to take them right before i go to bed because they make some people sick|`|ACc1skbPaa	I couldn't take them either, they were too big for me to swallow and the smell of them made me sicker...I took a Flintstones chewable for all three of my pregnancy and made sure I ate well and drank lots of water---unless you are operating on some type of specific deficiency, the OB will understand and just be glad you are taking something and if you take care of yourself, your baby will be fine...<br>  <br>  PS: I only took children's vitamins because I am horrible at swallowing pills--you can take a regular multivitamin for adults...|`|4GwTDea1aa	you DONT have to take the vitamins.. the purpose of them is to give MOMMY all the iron calcium and everything else they provide.. because the baby take ALLL of that away from you! <br>  But if you stick to them it gets better i promise,<br>  at first i couldnt even keep them down i would throw right back up and i HATE throwing up<br>  try taking them with some milk that helped me and a lil snack just in case b/c w an empty stomach your bound to get sick!<br>  Good Luck and Congrats ?|`|pJFb4LRlaa	I asked this same exact question. I can't take my prenatal vitamins because they make me throw up. and personally, i'd rather keep all my food down and get those nutrients to my babies rather than try and take a prenatal pill and throw that up as well as everything i just ate. <br>  <br>  anyway, many people said that they had the same problem and their doctor told them to take 2 flinestone vitamins instead a day.<br>  <br>  best of luck!|`|7273c2f9619f41237bda5553ffcdd9ddaa	There are many different types of prenatal vitamins.  I would try using a different brand, it may help.  If you aren't going to take vitamins, which isn't recommended, you need to make super sure to get all of the proper vitamins and nutrition through the food you eat, daily.|`|7XSPSy5oaa	It is better for the baby if u take them...try eating a little something before u take them..that's wat I had to do they made me sick too..if that doesn't work try taking the flinstone vitamins for kids the have the same as prenatal vitamins n work just as good better than not taking anything..good luck sweetie|`|RjdrO7DVaa	talk to your doctor .. they can give you different ones to try.  If you can't wait that long, go to cvs and get the natures made ... they are really easy on your stomach.  while your there .. pick up dha .. its good for the baby too<br>  <br>  the prima-care is the ones that made me sick ... but the nature made are good.|`|2LO5UXUTaa	My doctor told me to do 2 flintstone vitamins a day because I can't take the prenatals either|`|CfiMFyGhaa	I took prenatals that made me sick to, but I just stuck with it, because there are a lot of things in those vitamins that help the baby develop.  However, if they make you too sick, and you don't want to take them, You should take a children's vitamin and a separate dosage of folic acid.  A friend of mine took Flintstone vitamins combined with the right dosage of Folic Acid (talk to your doctor about the right dose) and the docs said this was just fine. My doctor told me that it was okay not to take any vitamins if I was getting too sick.  You might find that the vitamins make you sick early in the first trimester and late in the third trimester, but that you can take them with out getting sick the rest of the time.  Overall, you are not hurting yourself or the baby by not taking any vitamins-it is just that there are a lot of things in the vitamins (any vitamin really) that are good for you and good for baby.  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps...Good Luck!|`|8YqVMWBCaa	yes you should take them. I know a very sad story about a friend of mine who didn't take them and the Dr. told her if she would have the baby probably would have lived. They make me sick as well but i take them before bed and then when I'm sleeping if i get nauseated i don't notice it.|`|nkZMhmRnaa	<a href="http://yourinfo.h-o-s-t.name" rel="nofollow">http://yourinfo.h-o-s-t.name</a><br>  A very informative website you can also get much information in website|`|XStkrGx3aa	I am a mother of 6 and i had the same problem talk to your DR. there are some other vitamins you can try like "primacare cap one" it worked for me.|`|0i7BWGNhaa	The same thing happened to me and my midwife said it was fine not to take them (depending on how far along you are) I stopped taking mine when I was about 3months pregnant and took flintstone vitamins instead
c490676d02a8b133e7a6143969ba0116aa	Absolutely! It is called "egg sharing". I have known a few women who have done it. But know that sometimes you don't stimulate well with IVF and may not have many eggs to share. I don't know much about egg sharing but you may find this link helpful <a href="http://www.ivf-infertility.com/donation/egg/egg15.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.ivf-infertility.com/donation/...</a><br>  <br>  Here are some clinics in the USA that do egg sharing <a href="http://www.ihr.com/infertility/provider/donoregg.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ihr.com/infertility/provider/...</a><br>  <br>  I believe you do egg sharing through the clinic you find and get compensation that way.

Depending on where you live is how much you get for donating your eggs... There are 2 places close to me that you can donate to and one is  2 hours away that offers $5,000 and the other is 3 hours away and offers $7,000 so it depends on the area for how much you can get. I didn't realize all this until this past year when my mother in law was trying to get me to do it and then a few months after I heard my aunt talking about it. So no your not the only female who has thought about it... Hope this helps you out..|`|F8iyUqJBaa	You can donate the eggs that they harvest and still produce plenty more in the following months for yourself.  The hormones they put you on will increase the amounts of eggs you produce for a while.

It is quiet possible that it was, but even this wouldn't mean your were def pregnant. Only way to know is wait and see.<br>  <br>  Personally i'd say there was a fairly low chance but no one can no for certain.|`|1BYckfgXaa	Nope if you miss your period on friday you should seek a pregnancy test.<br>  <br>  However give it a weekend maybe as it could just be starting late.|`|MI7Vo2d5aa	Actually, I think that's the worst time to have unprotected sex.

X23hkjIPaa	it is possible if he doesn't completely drain his pipes before he reinserts. I would be more careful if you don't want to get pregnant.<br>  Peace|`|AA10186411	Uh yeah, definitely. If you have to ask this, you seriously have no business having sex.|`|joPJtKemaa	I agree with Red-Tech.<br>  <br>  Please do not have sex you are probably too young.|`|fccdcaa6e1aa306a88110de27284c970aa	yes you can and for everyone who is telling her what to do dont she can do what the hell she wants to do.
o8xNTVWTaa	the wait is a defiantly a killer for any one waiting to find out..lol... it sounds like u could be preg i guess all u can do is wait till u miss ur period and test. the really light bleeding could have been implantation it only happens to a small amount of women but it does happen and its exactly how u described it. this usually happens between 5-12 if u have conceived|`|4d163081b2e7d60145dd97484dd14342aa	You can get pregnant at any time in your cycle if you're having unprotected sex.  You need to do a pregnancy test on the 7th.|`|afrEHRr5aa	Yeah u could be preg, but the only way to find out is to do a test if u miss your period|`|QePbhS8Caa	Get an ept or first response. You can get results with those like a week before your period. It's worked for me in the past. It's less likely that you'll get pregnant right before or after a period, but still possible. You might want to take prenatals just in case.|`|tIFDvOVBaa	Good luck to you too bbe, let me know what happens lots of baby dusst  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
o8xNTVWTaa	i think that's a really good sign.  swollen tender brest is one of the earliest preg symptoms it can occur as early as 1 or 2 day after  conception  GOOD LUCK|`|CuCrGDuRaa	Everyone is different but in both of my pregnancies I didn't have sore breasts or any other symptoms until I was 6 weeks pregnant.  If you are just a few days pregnant your HCG level would be very, very low.  But I suppose it's possible!|`|u7kDLuklaa	I experienced breast tenderness and fatigue 4 days after conception in more than one pregnancy.    I have almost always known i was pregnant before i could test because of it.  The tenderness is unmistakable .. i also felt some tingling.    I hope you get the outcome you're hoping for!
PFO1jxZGaa	I cant imagine ever doing anything like that. It's sad. I know some people who said that to their kids but when the baby was born they came around and now their relationships are ok. So they might work things out or then not.. Its sad that things like that happen. Good luck with everything :)|`|4gZYucHMaa	In the past 10 yrs, since I turned 22 I hadn't talked to my parents aside from a stretch when I thought maybe they'd be better grandparents than parents--I was wrong.    As a parent myself, I can't imagine them doing anything severe enough to cause no contact/no talking with us.    I still wonder what I've done so terribly wrong to my parents but I'm moving on.    Hopefully your family is good with your gf--she needs support especially now.    Good luck to you both|`|AA12221392	Some parents are more about them selves then loving thier children.     They could be upset that they think maybe she wont complete college and so forth. Some families really look down on unwed babies so forth.  But as a parent sometimes you have to forgive your child even when you don't think it is right and let them live their life and make their choices and let them figure out what mistakes they may have made on their own without judjing them.    I mean you say around 20, is she under 20. Her parents proably just wanted her to make something of her life.     But the baby is going to come and they will miss out .|`|kpPbnzwXaa	ITs sick isn't it, pray for these kids,    this petition relates to what you were saying in your question about bad parenting...    http://www.gopetition.com/petitions/no-t...|`|mC4mnvGFaa	Some parents are very religious and see living together before marriage as a sin, and now she is expecting, they no longer want to acknowledge their part in the whole affair.   other parents see her as disobedient because she did something without their permission. and they feel she has embarrassed the whole family by getting pregnant.   I suspect that if you got married, they would welcome her back into the fold with open arms.  However, don't try to push them together, she truly is better off without them and your child definitely is.
mx3gFmIKaa	Yes, call early intervention to have him assessed.  It is free, and they will treat him if he is delayed.<br>  <br>  I have a son who was born with torticollis.  He did get a cerebral palsy diagnosis after he didn't use one side of his body and then he had an MRI that confirmed it.  My son did get PT and was discharged before two.  He was picked back up at 3 but he runs, climbs, and he uses both sides of the body evenly.  He has trouble jumping over consecutive 5" hurdles and bouncing on a hoppity ball both 3yr old skills.  No braces, no special shoes its very mild.  If your son has a problem they diagnose anybody with CP and it sounds like it would be very mild.  Actually before two they call it hypertonia with hemiparesis, or dystonia, both are code for CP which is a catchall dx.  I do not think it will be a long term issue, but do think he would benefit from PT if he qualifies.  These issues do put him at an additional risk for learning disabilities.<br>  <br>  Other things, it could be nothing, or it could be a motor planning issue<br>  <br>  My son crawled dragging one side of his body.<br>  <br>  Torticollis is the sternocleidomastoid muscle of the neck that shortens on one side from prolonged positioning this way, it has nothing to do with the leg.|`|7c9a6ac2b60c434d81159b0728373573aa	My son did this fromt he time he started crawling till he walked and he's fine.He walks fine and had no problems. Still don't know why he crawled this was but didn't seem to have any lasting issues. I wouldn't worry|`|e0eb82b689e1db392eb51c89982ed115aa	HIs coordination is a bit delayed it sounds like. He wasnt that premature to cause that much delay but the Torticollis might be the culprit. I would suggest getting in to see the PT again and start working on the leg. Never hurts and give them something to do.|`|OCMSTxYfaa	don't take the chance..get him into the pediatrician..especially if he suffered from other problems...good luck!

fMilDRgLaa	You sound like me.  I had periods but did not ovulate.  I bought those kits, tracked temps and I NEVER saw when I ovulated.  I had to get a blood test drawn sometime cd 12-15.  It showed I was not ovulating. After 3 rounds of clomid I was preggo. He is now 4 years old.<br>  <br>  Also, the clomid had to be adjusted to 150mg. before I ovulated the second month. I threw that damn ovulation kit away and had sex  from cd10-20 every other day.  IT WORKED! Good luck.|`|SHBpzAIZaa	Just because you are having a period does not mean that you are ovulating. I would suggest going to your doctor and requesting some bloodwork be done. The only way to know for sure if you are ovulating or not is through your hormone levels which will show in the bloodwork. While you are there, you can also discuss your options with the doctor, as to what you can do to become preggers... <br>  <br>  Good Luck to you!  ~Baby Dust~|`|UNWLaJbKaa	Def go to the dr. if the predictor kits are not showing that you are ovulating.  It took us 3 months to conceive so you're not off at all.  I used the clear blue easy monitor, which tracked my ovulation every month, but it's harder to track if your irregular.  I know that I took Vitamin B6 to length my SLP, and it moved up my ovulation day by 5 days, and kept me regular at the standard 14 day ovulation, when I use to be at 19 day ovulation.<br>  <br>  but the Dr. should be able to pin point when your ovulating....|`|yea2hci5aa	I think the best thing for you to do is go to your doctor get their opinion on whether or not you're ovulating and when they think you would be.  Then get an ovulation kit and test around the time your doctor suggests.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  I know how frustrating it can be with an irregular cycle.|`|F3BRG72iaa	well my doctor said that as long as you have a period then that means that you ovulated because your period comes after you ovulated.|`|tdNfQWaAaa	I'm not sure.. I used those ovulation kits and mine never told me I was ovualting either. My doctor said some women just can't use them and to not waste your money on them. He told me to just have sex every other day and keep track of my periods... I know how you feel though, I was so upset when I never got a positive ovulation test. And it is tough to not use them too. Just pay super close attention to your discharge and maybe check your cervix.. When its soft, high, open, and wet (S.H.O.W.) that means your ovulating. So try to relax. But if you are really worried, go see your doctor. Best of luck and tons of baby dust!!! xxxx|`|2fefc2eed72006ed6d644403276d9676aa	i have tried the online ovulation charting <br>  take your temp every morning as your temp rises straight after ovulation <br>  keep an eye on you cervix position and fluid to work out when you ovulate <br>  the kits dont always work 100%<br>  and if you have sex every other day then the sperm can live in your body the two days where your egg will only be there for 2 hours so its better to have sex every two days to get it right<br>  fertilityfriend .com is a good site
WxQFe0GYaa	Most likely, if it's perfectly clear, then it's not BPA free.  BPA free plastic is kind of brown and cloudy looking.  I'll have to look up what number is safe.<br>  <br>  Plastic containing BPA has a 7 on the bottom.  Safe plastic has a 5 on it.|`|pXSKSS3daa	Usually the packaging will state if they are BPA free.<br>  <br>  If it doesn't state that then I'd conclude that they are not BPA free. I believe #7 on plastics is a bad one and that's the most common one I've seen.|`|ySKK7lCyaa	If the bottle is foggy then it is BPA free. I know Dr. Browns has BPA free bottles.|`|e0eb82b689e1db392eb51c89982ed115aa	BPA is usually only a problem if you heat the bottle with the milk in it. It was a problem when people were heating bottles in the microwave and hot water heating devices. The heat let the toxin leech into the milk. If you heat and make the formula in a glass container then, transfer to the bottle you shouldnt have a problem, though I decided with my second (im 37 weeks) Im throwing all bottles away and going with glass, or the vented L shaped ones now. I plan on breastfeeding the most but if I have too I am going to opt for newer bottles.|`|y6g0RnuAaa	Usually bottles with the #7 in the recycling triangle have BPA in them. Look for PP- that is a non-BPA type plastic and is most common in BPA free bottles. #1, #2 and #5 are safe!|`|Z5s5DV6haa	i breastfeed so i know my baby doesnt get any BPA|`|3L7D2TVWaa	well, that pretty much means that they do contain BPA. I bought some bottles about a month before my son was born in October 08, and they contained BPA. I went back to get the next size up last month, and now they have the same bottles BPA free! So I think they only started making them in the last couple years, so i'm sure the bottles you have contain it. they advertize BPA Free like crazy, so it would def say it on the packaging!<br>  I recommend you try Venti-Aire bottle from Playtex, they are AWESOME! thats is the only bottle i use, and now they are BPA free. they have a venting system on the bottom and are slanted, so the air in the bottle stays up top while youre feeding, and he doesnt swallow it! that way my son is a lot less gassy and fussy! I also use nipples that are kinda yellowish rubber because they are a lot softer and more comfortable in his mouth than the clear nipples that come with the bottles.  those are sold seperatly. I get them at Target!<br>  good luck!|`|WtTUNC8Naa	Here is a great site.<br>  <a href="http://zrecs.blogspot.com/2008/02/z-report-on-bpa-in-infant-care-products.html" rel="nofollow">http://zrecs.blogspot.com/2008/02/z-repo...</a><br>  Your best bet is to go with BORN FREE bottles, they are awesome, and are BPA free.|`|mvqfIjEVaa	If they're 3 1/2 years old then they're most likely not BPA free.  The BPA issue only came to light in the US within the last couple years.|`|g6GApb67aa	brestfeeding is easier!
2irmTjQ3aa	Yes you are, you just don't have so much of the pregnancy hormone. But even the faintest line means that you are pregnant, you can't have a false positive.

When I took my first test it was extremely light, but I took another the next day with the first urine of the morning and it was quite a bit darker.

When I click on the photobucket link its says the Picture has been moved or deleted.. so didn't get to see that..<br>  <br>  but a line is a line, even if its faint, it does not have to be as dark as the test line.|`|d5fd9d057a20f9f41b37d39a5288a98faa	I think I saw this question yesterday, and yes its still a positive.|`|ZusC87WBaa	What's the point of posting the link if there is no picture?|`|7XSPSy5oaa	It doesn't matter if the line is faint or not take another test in a few days if u just want to be sure...you hgc level is probaly just not very high yet...it is still a positive though if there is a line...good luck if ur pregnant :)

You can try some non medical techniques to get into labor before you due date, like walking, having sex, getting a prenatal massage and ask them to work on the pressure points that induce labor.|`|F9pAWBG9aa	i asked my doctor for nearly the same reason and his reply was " If you are inducalbe there is no problem" you have the right to ask its your body and your baby and it isn't that far from your due date. don't listen to the people being nasty they probably haven't had to deal with that type of situation.|`|7273c2f9619f41237bda5553ffcdd9ddaa	A lady I go to church with had scheduled herself to be induced about a week before she was even 40 weeks.  I think you should be able to ask and it be ok.  It is your choice really.  <br>  <br>  You could try some of the natural remedies early to try to go into labor before then.|`|7031265d0531963ae96124dd73a8cd85aa	You can ask but they're going to tell you no. Especially because you want the baby out for your own selfish reasons. <br>  <br>  Most doctors will not even CONSIDER an induction until you are 41 weeks along... Some doc's wont' do it until you're 42 weeks. <br>  <br>  So good luck with that.|`|816TYl4eaa	Being induced stop me from dilating and I had to have a c section.|`|BCyg3SMBaa	Sweetheart im gonna assume that this is your first baby. I understand the whole family thing. I was the same way. Unfortunatley, I had high blood pressure throughout most of my pregnancy, and at 37 weeks was induced. <br>  The process of being induced is incredibly long and incredibly tedious.They will give you a drug called Pitocin through an IV that will start your contractions. They may also insert sumthing into your vagina near your cervix called Cerva Dome to get your cervix to eface which will also speed up your contractions. <br>  If they dont get the Pitocin level just right (which I can almost garuntee the first few hours they wont). At one point my contractions were up in the 100's (they will hook you up to a monitor and the lowest is zero/highest is 145)  and were 30 seconds apart. I didnt get a break. At that point my blood pressure shot through the roof. They rushed in. broke my water and put an internal monitor inside of me. <br>  When all was said and done I was in labor for three days. My OBGYN said inducing Labor will always prolong it. Not letting your body do what it is naturally programmed to do before it is ready can not only endanger you, but your baby. My baby was only 3 weeks early and I still did not get to bring her home when I went home because of the stress of the labor, and because her lungs were not yet ready. Even that soon.<br>  My advice to you is to wait until your body decides to go on its own, unless you have a medical emergency. Because you could end up not even being able to hold your own baby yourself if he's in the NICU. Im sure your family would much rather have a safe happy & healthy baby, then one they have to look at through a plastic box while hes hooked up to tubes. When my husband and I are ready for number to I will avoid inducing AT ALL COSTS. Unless like before it's medical. <br>  If you are really set on having your baby sooner rather then later, you can ask your doctor to give you an amniocentisis test. They will stick a long needle into your belly and take a sample. They will then be able to tell you if your babys lungs are ready to go. But as far as I know most doctors avoid this. It is more common to have an elective C-section. Even those in most states are outlawed until a woman reaches 39 weeks.<br>  Choose Wisely. Labor is a beautiful and amazing experience. DOnt rob yourself or your baby of what could have been. <br>  Best Of Luck with new Labor and new little one!|`|PjCKtuU3aa	Like everyone else has said - you can ask, but you'll probably be told no! Induction runs the risk of further complicating your delivery and has a high likelihood of resulting in c-section, and also means that you're removing the baby from the womb before she's ready.<br>  <br>  Frankly, if your doctor is willing to do an early induction based purely on your desire to have your baby at your covenience instead of when she's ready to come, I wouldn't want to go to your doctor!|`|LkXz94ADaa	Most likely they will say no. Why risk the chances of your baby being infected or something if it is not for a medical reason. Your baby knows when he or she is "done" You wouldn't take a cake out of the oven before the timer went off just because you were really hungry, so why do that to your baby? You want him or her to be nice and "ripe" when it makes its appearance so just make everyone wait! You'll be glad you did in the long run... Especially if something goes wrong.|`|PIh8ivz6aa	you do have the right to ask. I would ask him. The only thing he can tell you is no or yes. At least you would know. :) Have a great day.
Ccq8zEcnaa	It may be too early for you to tell with a test if you are pregnant or not. Your irregular period and bleeding may be because you missed a pill, throwing you off a little. It only takes one missed pill to get pregnant, that's what happened to my sister. I suggest you wait a week or two more, then take another test. Or if you want answers now, go see you doctor and ask for a blood test.|`|OSXAPmrcaa	the chances of being pregnant after missing a pill is less than 5%. ue missed period could be cause by stress or as you said the withdrawel bleeding u already had|`|xarKlp0Oaa	It may take a while for it to show up on a pregnancy test. There is always a chance of getting pregnant no matter if you don't miss any pills or not. You are suppose to waite or use a second form of birth control during the first month of taking pills so there is that chance that yes you are pregnant but just not far enough along for it to show up on a pregnancy test.

Make sure he has his familiar toys and familiar routines in place to feel more secure. If he could continue to stay at your house, even better.|`|ZusC87WBaa	Honestly, your child would probably handle things fine.

145RUNQHaa	He's suffering severe frustrations must be a very difficult time for him.let him know he's not alone if he tantrums and can not be distracted then just let him know a hug waits then wait until he's calmed and tell him well done for calming himself down.stay in the same room never walk out of the room and leave him makes things worse.don't punish him. again it makes things worse.try holding him and hugging a lot during the day as this can have a long term soothing effect.have a bath with him to calm him lay him on your chest and try baby massage with baby oil.spend time using relaxation techniques such as this and try to avoid possible frustrating situations for him.praise him over any small achievement and try fitting in some physical activitys such as swimming ,football a run around the park or anything to get his energys out.let him help you with things around the house give him small tasks to do that you can do with him like getting the washing out of the washing machine to help him feel important and build his confidence.it will take a lot of time and patience but it will get better you just need to keep setting a good example with your own behaviour by staying calm and gentle at all times.if you feel his behaviour is becoming worse then seek a second opinion from another doctor.hope this helps in some way.x|`|19QSiNqgaa	these could be early signs of autism. get him tested.|`|niX6gIZHaa	You have to discover the trigger for his behavior.<br>  Is he trying to get your attention?  Is he reacting to you telling him "no" on something he wants?  Discovering the source of his tantrums will help you to appropriately deal with them.<br>  <br>  Whatever the cause, the behavior is disrespectful and he needs to be disciplined.  Behavior of this caliber is unacceptable and should not be tolerated.  If he's behaving this way toward you, he will behave this way toward others.  If he has tantrums at home, he will have tantrums in public.  It is our responsibility as parents to set boundaries and guide their behavior toward what is acceptable and your toddler is testing you to see what he can get away with.<br>  <br>  Whatever your choice of discipline, you must be firm and consistent.  Remember that you are the parent and he is the child. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|WPI0Z47saa	My son used to throw tantrumes. The thing is to let them get it out but to put them in a situation where is can be done safely. I used to put my son on the couch or the middle of our king sized bed. I would stay within reach so that he wouldn't get hurt but wouldn't acknowledge his behavior until he calmed down. He eventually got tired of this since he didn't get the response that he wanted and in about a month he stopped completely. I even put him in his crib sometmes to let him cry it out. Hope this helps.|`|0IPxeDJiaa	I recommend reading "The Happiest Toddler on the Block" by Harvey Karp.  There's something going on here.  He needs lots of love as he cannot control himself when he starts throwing these tantrums.  This book also gives YOU ways to allow him to save face when his emotions get out of control.  <br>  <br>  I also recommend "Raising the Spirited Child".  It has some excellent insight.|`|AA12305234	How about, he is a brat. It happens to the best of kids, even yours|`|KTbo7dWlaa	It does not sound like there is anything wrong with him. Is he and only child? If so that could be it. Does he get to play with other kids, If so how is he with them? Try putting him in time out every-time he throws a temper tantrums.... Don't let him act the way he does. He will do whatever he can get away with. If you let him do this now he wont stop as he gets older! Be strong with him and stay on top of it.... He will grow out of it as long as you take charge of it now. Good Luck|`|txv7TIgiaa	my daughter is 14 months she went through hat head butting thing she still does it a little, but the doctor just said to put her in a soft area where she couldn't hurt herself much and ignore the tantrum...which has worked out pretty good because when she saw that she wasn't getting attention from it she kind of stopped doing it! good luck..
Ccq8zEcnaa	It's morning sickness unfortunately, and for most women it goes away once you get into your second trimester. Mine stopped when I was in my 16th week. I found that eating crackers before getting out of bed helped, and sleeping with two pillows under my head to elevate me helped. I eventually got phernergan from my doc to help with the throwing up, because somedays I couldn't hold anything down. Try to eat light, as if you had the flu.. Drink plenty of fluids so you don't get dehydrated.. sleep on an incline.. call your doc and get some meds... You shouldn't have to fight it alone.|`|ez5BjZdRaa	morning sickness|`|3X0t8JrXaa	Have you tried sleeping with a humidifier?  My nephew has the same problem (poor baby is barely 2) and that seems to help.|`|LqpNve02aa	Seems to me that you might be slightly allergic. Try something over the counter and the humidifier.|`|PseiMJd2aa	Consult a doctor|`|AA11022786	During the winter months we usually keep our houses warmer then normal and that can cause the humidity levels to drop. I get the same problem. You need to invest in a cool mist humidifier and keep it on low-med at night when you sleep (also close the door to the bedroom). If you don't want to get one then you can put a big pan of water to boil for a few hours before you sleep to try to bring the humidity levels up also...but unless there is a lot of water in the air it won't last till morning. But depending on how dry your air is it might help.

My parents trust me and I am always honest, so it's easy for me to be safe. I do try to be home by 2am because that's when all the local bars close.

x8JRkRNkaa	Not very likely that the baby would turn breach from a head down position. They can move around, but flipping like that would be very hard and near impossible due to the lack of room. If he is head down now then you can expect him to stay that way. Good luck.|`|3cLE5L7Saa	My doctor told me it is possible for that to happen, but not likely if he's already in head down position at 38 weeks.|`|ZZzQLjaKaa	if it is your first pregnancy, there is little stretch or give for this to happen, so if he is head down now, I would not worry. I just had this conversation with my OB!
t4HXotwEaa	You need to tell your dr.<br>  Hepatitis B and Tetanus/Diphtheria i believe, are safe during pregnancy.  However, I'm not sure about the others.  I know the mmr and varicella vaccine can be very bad.  That said,  My doctor gave me that vaccine when i was pregnant about 10 years ago because i had not had the chicken pox and had been possibly exposed.  Due to the risk factors he felt its was best to vaccinate.  You really need to tell your dr.  Everything is probably fine.  Good luck.|`|USoqyjaAaa	The risks are theoretical- that is, in studies, they have not actually been shown to cause harm to the fetus.  Inadvertent administration is NOT considered grounds to abort.  So please try not to worry too much.  But you should let the clinic know.  They should let the Immunization people know at the CDC- following pregnant women who were inadvertently immunized is a good way to track outcomes, since they obviously wouldn't do tests on pregnant women.|`|xy5UNiELaa	Call the clinic where you received the vaccinations, or your family doctor.  Tell them your situation and ask for any information on vaccinations and pregnancy.  I'm not sure of the risks, so contact a professional.  Congrats on the baby and good luck!

It seems that congratulations are in order!|`|66bc4129385331039e67c99220c312fcaa	My impression would be that there would have to be something(hormones) present in your urine to cause any sort of positive response. For these hormones to be present you would have to be pregnant, but maybe your hormone levels are too low to get an accurate reading. Again, I am not an expert and would suggest waiting a few days and retest. Your hormone levels increase dramatically in just a few days, so you should be able to get a better reading then. <br>  <br>  ...The hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (better known as hCG) is produced during pregnancy. It is made by cells that form the placenta, which nourishes the egg after it has been fertilized and becomes attached to the uterine wall. Levels can first be detected by a blood test about 11 days after conception and about 12 - 14 days after conception by a urine test. In general the hCG levels will double every 72 hours. The level will reach its peak in the first 8 - 11 weeks of pregnancy and then will decline and level off for the remainder of the pregnancy...<br>  <br>  Hope this helps. Good luck
ZVqEDvZSaa	I know that light spotting during early pregnancy is normal because it happend to me and I have asked my doctor. My bleeding stopped at 7 weeks. But the reason your bleeding might be different as to why i was bleeding. So the best thing to do is go to the doctors.|`|WD6OUUDZaa	i did that too, until 14 weeks, but i never spotted. i think if the blood is brown, it's not cause for concern, since there is sometimes old blood in your cervix. and i would think the irritation to your cervix might cause some spotting. i M/C in February at 9.5 weeks and am now 20 weeks and have been really paranoid the whole time. i hope you have a healthy pregnancy! i know how scary everything can be.
ZbnxGIsnaa	It sounds to me like a period dear.  You would have had to have had sex mid cycle in order to get pregnant. . .|`|ng3A9Pgqaa	Since you had a period on the 4th, unless it was shorter and/or lighter than normal, then it was a regular period and you're most likely not pregnant.

I'm 7 weeks and usually when i dream it's easy to get back to sleep, but with all the peeing, feeling like I'm lying down on the deck of a ship in stormy waters(nausea, dizziness) AND the weird dreams.  Last night I had a dream that after my baby was born (it was a girl), i found out that her father was my uncle (yuk!!! as if i would have an affair with my uncle) and i was extremely paranoid that my partner would find out. The uncle came down to see the baby and his wife(my aunt) and the whole family  knew and she phoned him to say "so did you go and see HER and the baby?" Argh!!!! it was so weird I tell you.    The baby is 1000% my partner's!    I didn't even tell him because i felt soooo guilty even though it was just a dream!

I wouldn't try to read into them much, you'll just drive yourself crazy.|`|AA10953561	Pregnancy can mess with your dreams pretty early on. I don't remember when I had my first one. Several of them scared me or bothered me to the point where I'd have to call my honey at work (he works the night shift). Generally, I get up, go make a hot cup of tea, and watch some sappy movie to help get me relaxed. If that doesn't work, I'll take a bubble bath. It really takes away from my time to sleep, but the dreams do that anyway.     The last one I had was about me. I was walking in the dirt parking lot at my college and this car came skidding towards me and trapped me between it and another car. I was extremely pregnant and all I could do was scream "My baby" over and over. So, yes, scary and weird dreams are extremely common and can start early. They're believed to be triggered by the changes in your hormones messing with the chemicals in your brain.    Good luck, hon! Congratulations on your pregnancy!|`|gYU10xTcaa	the thing about being pregnant is that since your hormones are all crazy everything gets crazy. even dreams. it has been said that while you are pregnant you have the most vivid and sometimes scary dreams of your life just because your hormones make you see things differently. im 38 weeks pregnant and i've had some crazy dreams! some i dont even know how or why, but it happens. its totally normal, dont stress about it, if u have a scary dream try getting up and walking around or watch some tv it should get your mind off it.|`|aFaSMYPFaa	I had seriously scary dreams too.

I dont understand the question.|`|368008361e77a77ceeb8c70a92a3c2b8aa	nobody can answer this until you make it clearer!!|`|o8xNTVWTaa	not really following .... is that a word|`|O5WberWnaa	oh another murder question!!!!!|`|QMxEjCpiaa	paoers? don't think that's a word.
SEzIkGNiaa	I live in Canada, and we charge 35 dollars per day per child.  Or a weekely rate of 175 dollars per child.|`|EcbB1f28aa	I live in NJ and pay $868.00 a month for my six year old. When he was a baby, it was $1100.00 a month.
mgiJVjaKaa	I don't see why you couldn't have 2 days of school in a week if school was canceled due to a snowday. It wouldn't make sense to cancel a full week that you'd then have to make up later on.    But I think this is in the wrong section :)
MLPzeOtOaa	I heard 4 years....but I'm not sure how correct that is.|`|AA10186411	I wouldn't sign it until you know.  Wait until you get the DNA test, and then if its yours (do it through the court) they will automatically put it on the birth certificate.  I know this, because its the very reason I won't give my daughter's father a DNA test lol|`|jBDplldjaa	You should not sign if you have doubts. You can always get your name put on there later.|`|L3lS1LQWaa	You always have the right to challenge a paternity test, Birth Certificate and other attributes of finding out a false paternity claim. Depending on a state/commonwealth(where laws will be stricter), it is sometimes not forgivable to have your name removed. Anyone can sign their name or be named as a father on a birth certificate).  In order to prove there was unlawful use of your name and you are assuming the mother lied, you will have to probably need representation in re of the family court system to help over turn the certificate with the use of your testimony as well as paternity testing ordered directly from the courts.
NkGTSqBdaa	Well you have a few different options, you can wait for a few more days and see if you get your period if not, take another test. You might be pregnant and your hormone levels mightn't be high enough to register a positive test yet. Otherwise if you are really worried go to your gyno or your doc and discuss it with them.    I hope this helps xx|`|afad69e26e3d742b9b035d7dbbbbf716aa	i know you are probably very anxious right now. i would be too but i suggest you wait at least another week. if you dont get your period then take another HPT test, if it's still negative then schedule an appointment with your doc. good luck|`|LNSiLxlBaa	Hmmm...Have you had any signifcant weight gain or loss? More stress than normal? These thing can possibly affect your cycle. Gaining or losing weight drastically can cause a delay in your period. If you've had an ultrasound and pregnancy test and the Dr. says everthing is fine, then it seems you don't have anything to worry about. Did you start or stop birthcontrol recently? That can possibly cause a delay in your menstrual cycle as well. I'd just continue to keep contact with the Dr. if I were you and notify him or her of any changes.
qXq0nmBzaa	MOY-ra  Here's an audio link to the pronunciation:  http://inogolo.com/pronunciation/Moira    MOIRA Gender: Feminine   Usage: Irish, Scottish   Pronounced: MOI-ra   Anglicized form of MIRE (Irish form of MARY)|`|fHxpycJSaa	Moy-ra|`|6DQSkKgWaa	My friend's name is spelled that way and she pronounces it     "Maw ruh"|`|JSo14Jreaa	MOY-ra .... and for the record, i LOVE that name. i also like the name jane for a girl. in case you needed ideas.|`|uuPJ9xmNaa	Moy-Ruh|`|r0BmWIuFaa	MOY-ra|`|175ydQo5aa	I think its `Moe_Eye ra`    Like Shaniqua or something like that|`|4a2b1a81a9c8031e2a999ddf51108881aa	I'd say Moy-rah.

IT JUST DEPENDS ON HOW THE PARENT WHO CHOSE THE NAME WISHED TO PRONOUNCE IT.
rsm0NmNsaa	Yes.  Way too harsh for a five year old.  Time out should not be longer than 1 minute per year until they enter 1st grade.  Depending on how upset the child is, 1 minute per year is too long.  It may not seem like a long time to you, but to them its forever and when upset... it feels even longer.    The fact he fell asleep just proves it is too long.    Tantrums should not be tolerated.  So you are doing good by punishing such behavior.  It may be hard, but be sure to use love when punishing them.  When we have children in our daycare throw tantrums, we hold them (cuddles and hugs) until they stop, then they go to time out for the inappropriate behavior.  I did not use that with my own son, because I didn't know any better.  I can see a huge difference in how well the children in the daycare respond to the kindness shown before the punishment is doled out.  The punishment of time out, still sucks for them, but they seem to get more of a life lesson from the time they spend thinking about what they did wrong.    Once the 5 minutes is up, do feel free to continue to restrict his activities, ie no privileges(such as not being able to play with toys or watch tv) as part of the punishment.      We have do have educationally challenged kids in the preschool and my son is language delayed.|`|3Psi4kBxaa	For a 5 year old yes far too long.   One minute for each year of age up to age 12 then two minutes.|`|f3n2zXG2aa	Sounds like the kid is frustrated and tired.  Proven because he fell to sleep.    Kids get cranky when they are tired, or getting sick.|`|8bf22a7b300866a77ba08f820aaefdcaaa	Yes, the general rule is 1 minute/year of age.    So, if he's five, it should be five minutes.    If you tell him not to do something, he's going to do it. Reverse psychology.    Just give him zero attention for five minutes, with him in his room and his door closed. Hold it shut if you have to.    He's looking for attention by acting out, so show him he's not going to get any.|`|27722e46d7e1a47f6c3e2edef016aa14aa	Nope not at all,  I do the same thing at my house I send my kids up to their beds.  I give my 5th Grader a hour on his bed.|`|bmoCpcdraa	oh no buy a cooking timmer and set it when he needs time out dont let him ruel over you cause he wont stop he will bully you around if you let him by with it let him screem let him wine but make him learn he will do the time|`|31269476570b3829c86de1e8c487e423aa	no thats not okay|`|qGQCLFinaa	I think he needs to cool off & when he's ready to come out & apologize for his behavior he can come out, my son is three, and when we have a huge tantrum of that sort, i make him take a longer timeout & he comes to me & says sorry in a heart felt way......  I don't think it's harsh..  15 minutes is not that long for such a huge tantrum, 1/2 hour, an hour TWO HOURS, that's "HARSH"|`|AA10788612	Janelle is right. When that is over & there is no satisfaction, drop trou and whip that a**!|`|S7VJ1GDdaa	No way, when my son was 5 y o ( he is now 20 y o) I would punish him with stuff like that, and it got to be where he  would ask for a spanking instead of time out. He decided to listen. It is not abuse or torture if someone thinks it is. By the way, my son turned out good. He is in his 4th semester of college ( double majoring in physics and math and a minor in language). You continue on your path. Good Luck|`|hMbVtyCQaa	I think that it should be 2 minute per a year. And another thing don't have time out in his room. Have it on the stairs or some where you can see him. Its not good in the room because you want there room to be a happy place.|`|g5JeSJbNaa	no that is not too harsh we do the same to our 5 year old also we take a favourite thing he likes away from him until he behaves good luck remember to be consistant|`|TK03jZTuaa	15 minutes is too long for this age.   Is there some toy that you can take off him? If he continues to be naughty keep on taking toys off him until he realises that his toys are privileges for good behavior.  try real hard to find something that he is doing well to reward him. somewtimes we can be so focused on the bad that we forget to notice the good.  If all else fails, try the Total Transformation program. It helped me with my kids
Ezkn5azdaa	I am stay home mom has well. I have 7 year old son and 4 year old son. And a new baby girl she 8 week old. I do get bored at home has well. I would be glad to email back and forth. I love to email people.|`|60052eab38f27341cc86e1493496f261aa	Congrats! My daughter was born last year on April 14th via c section! She's getting so big so fast....... Good luck and congrats again|`|8DnIXwnyaa	I'm having my a repeat csection in May.  He hasn't set a date yet.  He said probably a week before my due date, which is May 29th.      I have a 15 month old son also.
3EhoJ42zaa	With my first I was dilated 3cm 60% effaced and at +2 station (+4 means crowning) at 36 weeks.   I even lost my mucous plug.  I stayed that way for two more weeks until I was induced.  Being checked for dilation is pointless.  It doesn't mean anything.  There have been women who are not dilated but then go into labor the next day, then there are women who are 4cm for weeks and end up going over due. Also losing the mucous plug is no indication of labor being near.  It does regrow and you may even experience losing pieces of it or lose it again.    All doctors say "I dont think you'll make it to 40 weeks" to give you some encouragment to know the end is near.  Really she has no idea when you will go into labor.|`|MqFeJiukaa	LOL I hate answering these questions because I feel like I am always the unlucky one that is suppose to be pregnant forever lol.  I have the same things happen to me usually a month before I have my babies.  I am 36 weeks tomorrow and I lost my mucus plug about 3 weeks ago and I went into triage at 31 weeks with bleeding and was already 2cm dilated.  I will prob be pregnant til 41 weeks as usual.  I am sure you don't have long at all.  Best of Luck and congrats!|`|dDVAUA9saa	I delivered on March 23rd.  On March 20th I had some bleeding - i guess it was the mucous plug because until delivery I had no other bleeding or discharge.  I was also a bit dilated on the 21st (can't remember how much, this was 2006) and went into labour the next day.  I delivered at 37 weeks.  I don't think your size has anything to do with labour - I am small framed too and my labour was 17 hours.  The length of your labour depends on the baby's position and many other factors. My baby was posterior.|`|qi6mAsCZaa	I became dilated to a 2 by 6 months. I lost my mucus plug around 36-37 weeks I believe. I went into labor at 38 weeks. Probably just a couple more weeks...    Good luck and congrats!|`|bQTATDTyaa	I lost my mucous plug and stayed at 1-2cm from week 33ish. I had my baby at 38w5d. I didn't dilate any further until 10hrs into labor.|`|LABC73E7aa	i have been 1 cm for a week. my friend was 1cm for 2 weeks. its different for each woman but u can be 1 cm for a very long time or a very short time.|`|Mn1KPh9yaa	I think it all depends on how quickly you are dilating because my friend was dilated 1cm from 36 weeks to 38 weeks and she had to get induced because she was over due.|`|h17G3paiaa	It can take up to 3+ weeks to go into labor after losing your plug, I'm not saying this will happen to you but if this is your first baby you will probably go into labor when you are supposed to 38+ weeks.    My first born didn't want to come out at all and my second born was trying to get out at 36 weeks 5 days, lol.  She didn't make it out because my labor was stopped at the hospital.  I did lose my plug with her after I came home from the hospital and was 1cm- she kept quite until my scheduled c section which was 38 weeks 2 days|`|dfBjPB1laa	At 36 weeks 3 days I was 2 cm dilated.  At 37 weeks 3 days I was 3 cm dilated.  At 38 weeks 3 days (today) I am 4 cm dilated... lol.  I'm telling you my baby is content to stay in until spring time.  I've lost my mucus plug, but still no labor.  My doctor stripped my membranes so hopefully within 24 hours.  If she isn't born by next week my doctor is breaking my water.    It is so frusterating.  Everyone thought I would have my baby sooner, but she just doesn't want to come out.  Oh well.  I guess it's just a waiting game for everyone.  Good luck :)|`|zwctZ812aa	I am very small framed and was 1 cm starting at 34 weeks.  By 37 weeks, I was 2, almost 3 cm and almost completely effaced.  My doctor thought I would go early also, but I went 3 days overdue.  There's just no saying.  I've never heard of small framed women going into labor faster, but it certainly didn't hold true for me.  I know that's probably not what you wanted to hear, but that's my story!|`|7C9Ett7Caa	I dont know but thanks for asking this question. Im 36 weeks and 1 cm dilated too. Im due on Feb 23. When are you due??    Thats so cool that were due on the same day.. I wonder which one of us will have our baby first, lol :-)|`|ly59dQ3gaa	w/ my first, i was dilated to a 2, 75% effaced and she was at a +2 station at week 32.  By week 37ish I was dilated to a 3.  I was induced at week 40.  Those numbers don't mean much.  Sorry!

rHevYhzVaa	Here are the answers to your questions    1.  She liked having a baby brother around.  She actually wanted to play with him like a toy.     2.  My daughter was 2 yrs almost 3 yrs old when I had my first son.    3.  It was difficult at first juggling 2 kids but you get used to it.    Just always include your first child in the care of your second child like getting diapers, lotion, powder etc and they will feel like they're helping you.|`|2ieiGIhTaa	I was only 2, but my folks say I was pretty bent out of shape about it.|`|MhvwRwNKaa	My son took it pretty well...

Especially when my sister was born when I was 8.    Based on what my mother has told me about when my brother was born (2years after me) I tended to be a little bit jealous from time to time but all in all I looked out for him.  My mother has told me that she loved having us around, my dad worked a lot so in a way I guess you could say it gave her a sense of purpose.    My two cents|`|zFbhYl1Baa	children react in response to adults. children need to feel like their involved and in the loop. if the parents are thoughtfully including their child in each step than the child will react positively.

8yTP3jO8aa	That's really funny.  My little boy doesn't like looking at himself in the mirror much, but when he does he always identifies himself as a baby, even though he'll be 2 soon.      He is a big kisser, too, though.  We were with some friends who have a little girl his age and a little 4 month old girl.  They were getting ready to leave and I asked my little boy if he wanted to give the baby a kiss, because, really, it's cute for him to kiss a little baby.  He decided he should kiss his little girlfriend, too, though, so he walked up to her and gave her a big kiss, right on the lips.  Ouch!    Btw, Aaron looks so much like you!|`|yLyMG8Emaa	Babies are so funny! He is so cute with the food on his mouth!|`|UgX5WeGPaa	OMFG!!!! ELLIE JUST MADE ME PISS MYSELF LAUGHING...    i don't know what i'm gonna do when Ayden tries to slip me the tounge!!! ahahahaha|`|AA10811784	Awww... how adorable is that!?     Are they supposed to grow out of it? Because if so, my daughter didn't get that memo. She is almost 4 and still loves to look at herself in the mirror. She no longer "kisses" herself though. But she will stare at herself for a while and sometimes say, "I look like a princess!" (She is VERY much into princesses lately and seems to think she IS one.)|`|723QHuicaa	Awwww, how lovely with food hanging out of his mouth. He and my daughter would be a great match!    She loves the mirror too, frequently kisses it. I cant blame her, I love kissing her too!|`|dLadxEJSaa	Just wait until he starts trying to make out with you. Ben tries to slip me the tongue on a daily basis.|`|58b352907ba2def5e2248c3df2e55128aa	My son does the same thing. When he gets in front of the mirror I tell him kiss the baby and he will kiss his reflection, tongue and all. Cute!|`|xK6wehG7aa	ha! so cute! My son likes to touch his hand to the mirror and then die laughing like it's the funniest thing ever! lol|`|ZlNFOgO7aa	My two year old tries to tongue kiss me all the time. My daughter tries to kiss me on the lips and my 16 week old has found that my chin is an excellent thing to gnaw on. My face is permanently covered in drool (and I have a spit phobia, lol). All of my kids love the mirror, they pose. I can tell you it will only get worse with the mirror....lol|`|XPnCeJ29aa	Awww...Little Aaron!!!!   He's getting so much older looking!!!    Well Aaron still thinks that is another baby in the mirror! lol|`|ibWLdXlJaa	He is too cute!|`|ykgnkTE1aa	First of all, he really doesn't know that is him.  Babies don't recognize themselves until they are around 18 months.  I think he is just probably exploring his surroundings.  I'm sure you know this, but babies all explore things with their mouths...  My 12 month old has a coaster in his mouth as we speak!  So, he probably just wants to see what it feels like, and it probably feels good because it is cold!!      BTW, he is a cutie!!
tfTQ6Cuuaa	She is testing her boundaries and seeing what she can get away with, her little wheels are spinning.    Be firm, stand your ground. Reward positive behavior and ignore her tantrums. Walk away. So long as she is not endangering herself, let her have her fit. When she can't get a reaction out of you she will lose interest.|`|Bs8sllD9aa	i feel bad for you. Just keep in mind that it will end around age 4.|`|X8LNbaKQaa	Yes.  :-)  It is.  I'll bet you were just as much fun at her age.    Try to keep your sense of humor around her.  Don't be afraid to bust out laughing when she does something particularly outrageous. or join in and imitate her while obviously have a great time doing it.        She is enjoying power and humor for the first time.    Keep it light and playful and she will move on to more interesting games, soon.  Bang heads with her, and it will last longer.  If she needs to be somewhere, move her, rather than argue with her.  Distract her mind with something silly and unrelated to keep it from getting too serious.  No point in teaching her to do battle, better.    --   Regards,    John Popelish|`|SR5zlAl8aa	they mean terrible twins or mother dose not look like daughter|`|gmaCvh00aa	Yep, that's exactly what it means.  Don't let them turn you into their little personal slave trying to make them happy!|`|eHow24rNaa	its a stage...lol...my daughter went thru that from about 2 yrs til about 3-31/2 yrs old. She listens very well now and knows when i mean business...shes 4 now so i know how you feel with a smart mouthed toddler..just keep fussing her and taking away things she likes when she gives you lip|`|ENANtueuaa	My daughter did this from about 1 1/2 to 2 1/2, and yes it's the "terrible twos" lol. She's testing you, and she's going try to find a way to get what she wants. That's why you need to be firm and stay consistant!    Don't give into her when she tells you no, tell her your the mom, not her. When she asks "why not," tell her one time why she can't do something or have something, then after that ignore it...if she keeps asking or starts to scream, put her in time out. Tell her to go in her room and sit on her bed (or wherever time out is in your house), that's what i did with my daughter. Usually telling her to go in her room is what caused the tantrums because she knew she wasn't getting what she wanted. I just let her throw them in her room. After she was calm, i'd go in and talk to her...or she's come out on her own when she had finished screaming. I would talk to her and tell her "mommy doesn't like when you act like that, it makes me sad" and "you need to listen to mommy." Then i'd make her say she'd listen. It's a long process, i know! It will work though, and all about showing your kids that YOU are the parent, even if sometimes you feel like you are arguing with a 2 year old lol. Don't give in, that's all i can say, just stay consistant. Trust me, it will get better and better. My daughter is 5 now, and most of the time all i have to do is give her "the look" haha and she changes her behavior. Sometime if she is having a smart mouth i'll say, "i must of heard you wrong, do you want to say that again." Then she'll ask me/tell me the same thing, but in a nice way. I hope this helps :)  I forgot to add...make sure to use positive reinforcement! Praise her when she's talking to you nice, or helping you (etc.). Kids LOVE to please. That way when you tell her your sad because of how's she's acting, she'll be more willing to change her behavior to please you, and make you happy again.|`|844afb426cc1a9cf5ec93ffd1311e2ebaa	sure is.|`|DKqsFGymaa	Welcome to the terrible two's.  And I hate to tell you, but the three's aren't much better.  Just make sure you stay in control and let her know that you are still the parent.|`|tGwIeQRNaa	No one looks forward to the terrible twos, a developmental stage that usually begins sometime in the toddler years.    Although many parents don't expect the terrible twos to start until their toddler is two years old, it is important to note that it can begin anytime during your child's second year, and so anytime after their first birthday, and unfortunately, sometimes even before.    Characterized by toddlers being negative about most things and often saying 'no', the terrible twos may also find your toddler having frequent mood changes and temper tantrums.    To help you cope with this normal stage in your child's development, you should always remember that your child isn't trying to be defiant or rebellious on purpose. He is just trying to express his growing independence and doesn't have the language skills to easily express his needs. This can also be the reason why your toddler frequently gets frustrated and resorts to hitting, biting, and temper tantrums when he doesn't get his way.    By learning more about this normal stage in your child's development, it can make it easier to get through it and make sure that you aren't contributing to more battles than are necessary.    Other tips for helping your toddler during the terrible twos include:        * having a regular routine for meals, naps, bedtime, etc. and try to stick to them each day        * offer limited choices only, like 'would you like apples or oranges for your snack' and not just 'what do you want for your snack.' This helps your toddler feel like he is making some decisions and has power over things, but he isn't able to choose unacceptable alternatives.        * learn to set limits about things and don't be surprised when your toddler tries to test those limits to see what he can get away with        * don't give in to tantrums        * begin to use time-out and taking away privileges as discipline techniques        * provide your toddler with a safe environment that is well childproofed to explore and play in. It really isn't fair that your toddler should get in trouble for playing with something he isn't supposed to if you left it within reach.    Our Terrible Twos Countdown Calculator highlights another important fact about the terrible twos, they eventually end...|`|olF9Hl6saa	That is the Terrible 2's alright! Sorry to break it to you, but 3's are worse.. and 4's are just as bad I'm learning!!
NwTggQ2Baa	Toddlers will do all sorts of crazy random things to get attention. My 2 year old does really crazy things like gag herself, bite herself, and even bang her head on things like your daughter does. She started doing this when My second child was born when she was 1 years old and now I have new born sextuplets that I ALWAYS have to give my time to. But I think your daughter is just trying to get attention whether it being negative or positive attention. So whatever you are busy with, work, another child, etc, try your hardest to give her as much attention as you can throughout out the day. I hope this helps|`|WlU3NFu6aa	my daughter will be 13 mo on friday and she just started doing this too.|`|avx7bLnKaa	yes at that age my son did that as well|`|gAkNPTXGaa	Yes - it's normal. Strangely enough, it's the way some children soothe themselves. As long as she's not developing bruises or lumps on her head from it, don't worry about it. She'll outgrow it!|`|tGwIeQRNaa	information about children who bang their head    What Causes Head Banging?    Children who are emotionally and physically healthy, as well as children with developmental or sensory issues, may head bang. It is thought that head banging is a self-soothing process that children partake in, much like thumb sucking or an attachment to a blanket or toy. Children that bang their heads have at some point found the rocking or rhythmic sensations calming, and an aid to sleep. Alternatively, some children appear to bang their heads in an attempt to stimulate themselves or to bring pleasure. However, head banging may occur in combination with temper tantrums. While this may appear as if the child is trying to hurt himself or herself, it is usually the childs way of trying to relieve stress.    Kids who are under-stimulated (those who are blind, deaf, bored, or lonely) head bang for stimulation. Children who are over stimulated (in an overwhelming environment) find the rhythmic movements of head banging soothing.    Head banging may be a symptom of autism, tourette syndrome and seizure disorders.    When Head Banging Is an Underlying Symptom    You should take your child to the pediatrician immediately if he or she is engaging in head banging for a long period of time and seems unaware of their surroundings. If head banging is the only way a child can be soothed, or if they are unresponsive to attempts by you to interact with them, you should seek out medical attention.    Children who bang their heads excessively and cause themselves harm may have a developmental disability. These children may have to take medication or wear a helmet to protect themselves from injury.    Older children who bang their heads may need the attention of a psychologist. A psychologist can help the child find the source of their stress and teach them ways to cope.    When to See the Pediatrician    Medical attention is usually not necessary in regards to head banging. However, you should make sure your childs pediatrician is aware of the behavior. Unless the head banging is excessive or causing bumps or bruising, most pediatricians will advise parents to leave the child alone and to not interfere with head banging. Most children outgrow this behavior in a few months.    How do you prevent head injury?    Typically, healthy toddlers don't seriously injure themselves while banging their head. Pain prevents them from banging too hard. Also, children under 3 don't generate enough force to cause brain damage or neurological problems. The front or front/side of the head is the most frequently struck. A toddlers head is built to take all of the minor head trauma that is a normal part of learning to walk and climb. Healthy infants and toddlers who are head-bangers usually grow up to be coordinated and completely normal children.|`|KWelUnSOaa	yes this is normal..i dont have any kids but i have been takin care of my nephew every since he was born and he has been banging his head ever since he was like 9  to 10 months..whenever we would tell him do he would hit himself or try to bang his head on the floor. I would try to stop him all the time and now that he is 1 he tries to hit his head on the tv and he will bang it against me when i dont give him what he wants but it is normal dont worry about it.
SnVwHG3iaa	Hey    Your symptoms do certainly sound like pregnancy.  The brown discharge and pink spotting sound like it may of been implantation bleeding.    In my first pregnancy i got very sore breasts and they were fairly heavy.  Implantation occurs around 6-10 days past ovulation, its where the fertilized egg reaches the uterus and attaches itself to the lining of the womb, and this is when some woman experience spotting.  Some woman also experience slight cramps from it also.    It took my body 5 weeks to produce high HCG levels, i had 8 negatives before my BFP.  I would advise maybe going to the doctors and having a blood test done as they are more accurate and detect low levels of HCG.    Best of luck and hope you get the results you want  xx|`|OjYhh4Oxaa	I'm going through the exact same thing. my period is 7 days late & i had 2 negatives.  i know how you feel. go to the dollar store, buy 10 test. they're 1 a pop, and take 1 in the morning the first time you pee, until you get your period, or a positive, eventually one is bound to come.    goodluck.  babydust.
6y29MTyyaa	If only you knew someone, say a friend, who was willing to make himself available to give advice about these sorts of things. . . ;)|`|GZrR0uxjaa	well this sounds like a typical teenage pregnancy situation, the girl gets pregnant and the boy wants nothing to do with it, having a child is such a big deal, i too was a teen mother and no its no picnic, if your friend is truly ready for this huge responsibility she first has to let her parents in on it, if she hasnt already, they are the only ones that can really help her at this point...i.e. doctors appointment, and financial stability..all you can do is be a friend, support her and help her feel comfortable....good luck and i hope all works out!|`|1whTwTbDaa	What kind of help is she asking for? That is a better question. Oh, and the bf will have to pay child support no matter what...it was his fault too that he didn't use protection. But if she is asking for you to hold her hand and to just be there to listen to her when she is having a rough day, I don't think that is too much to ask for...do you? Be the friend you have been, that is good enough support.|`|3293197d640e4637ba8fe6bac61525ffaa	Ok, i think u shud sit her down n talk to her ona reals ( sorry 4 my slang)  Also if she doesnt lisen, put some sense in her head, suck as, how she gunna buy things for her child, feed the child etc.  If her bf isnt gunna be with her all da way, den she aint gunna make it da way she wants to, she might go trough a rough time.  If she doesnt lisen make her watch * teens pregnancy* on youtube, n let her see how hard it is but if she wnts to still keep it, then let her, she can give up for adoption. Its really up to her, and ino ur just tryna help her out cus ur her friend.    Good luck tho    x
AA11048920	Hi Suzie, First of all, I am sorry that you are in this situation.  Trust yourself to make the best decision once you have asked the people you trust most in your personal life. If you are having a hard time making a decision, can you seek professional counseling?  Honey, this site attracts the general public. You do not want them making any decision as personal as this. I know you must feel all alone and I am sorry for that. Other people's judgement do not belong in any of your considerations.|`|98WKYtfwaa	No, i would not get one at all, i would have been more careful if i wasn't able to cope with another child, but since these things happen i would keep it definitely. it might be hard but it's for the best.|`|AA11987492	I felt that I could not take on another child, then yes, I would have an abortion and I would hold my head high.

Is there someone in a professional field that you can talk to? If you are pregnant, are there agencies that can assist in looking after your children / husband to take some of the strain away from you? Do you have family to support you?

I say this with great sadness, for our ignorance is Satan's greatest advantage over us.? I recently read an interesting book by William Guy Carr, titled, PAWNS IN THE GAME (1958).? Here's a quote from page 126 that should concern parents out there...    Lenin had said: "The best revolutionary is a youth devoid of morals."? His word being law in Communist organizations, all members work secretly to make young people of both sexes anti-social and immoral.? Children up to teen-age are taught to rebel against the discipline of the home.? Parents are represented to their children as old-fashioned.? Parental authority is scoffed at.? The subverters argue that parents have lied to their children since they were old enough to listen, regarding Santa Claus and where babies come from.? The subversives claims parents are the victims of reactionary teachings and capitalistic exploitation.? The child is encouraged to educate the parents in regard to modern and progressive ideas.? They are warned that, for their own good, they must refuse to be dominated or disciplined by their parents.? The purpose of this subversive campaign is to destroy the sanctity, and unity, of the home which is the foundation upon which our civilization is founded. (SOURCE: PAWNS IN THE GAME, page 126, by William Guy Carr, 1958).  What a powerful mouthful of truth!? Kids today are being brainwashed by television (i.e., hellivision) and music to have no morals, and to backtalk (sass) their parents.? That's exactly what the Communists want.? It's not uncommon these days to hear children on TV telling their parents to grow up or to be quiet.? The same defiance is found in movies, whether by Walt Disney or Warner Brothers.? Music is without a doubt the biggest offender.? There is nothing more detrimental to the spiritual growth of a teenager than worldly music, which captivates the soul, and preaches a gospel of SELF, SEX, and SATAN.?  There is a sinister agenda at work in television and movies today, which is committed to the corruption of our youth's morals and faith in the Bible.? Take for example, Walt Disney's blasphemous Bridge to Terabithia, which denies the existence of Hell, and teaches youth that open-minded people could never believe in eternal damnation.? Teenagers today are under attack by Satan like never before! ??  Communism Thrives in a Selfish and Complacent Society that Doesn't Care  Communism is the machine of the Illuminati, i.e., the occult group trying to usher in a one-world global police state.? One needs to only read the statements of social sickos like George Brock Chisholm to clearly see what the Communists are trying to achieve--the total eradication of Christianity, family, morality, and the U.S. Constitution.? Communism's goal is nothing less than totalitarianism, i.e., a global police state!? Young people with no morals grow up to be rebellious adults with no concern for truth or justice.? This describes conditions in America today.|`|y8CFGGuvaa	You should try to tell her not to be as grown up but if she ants to wear 'cool clothes' then thats her choice. she is old enugh to make a few decisions of her own but rushing in to mking out with a boyfriend is a bit much.|`|oJTYvgvUaa	Okay, I actually live in Westchester and I go to the school described in Lisi Harrison's books.I too am disgusted by them.

Your saying you took the test at night time,     The first morning urine is the ideal sample for accurate home pregnancy results.  Remember NOT to drink large volumes of water before sleeping or during the night. This will dilute the urine sample that you have to collect in the morning. Also it is advisable to hold your urine for a while before testing for pregnancy.    Be sure to read all the instructions on the home pregnancy tests and follow them to the letter.     Be alert and do not interpret the test results after the allotted test Reaction Time. These are usually incorrect results.     Whether you are using the dip test or the stream test, you must use precision. For best results, allow sufficient urine saturation of the test strip or midstream tip as per test instructions. Also pay attention that the liquid does not touch the test area (where you read results). For test strips, do not dip the strip below the submersion marker or arrow line. For midstream tests, hold the test so the test area (window) is facing away from your stream of urine.    Hope this helps.  baby dust to you!|`|3l9Dlidiaa	Your link does not show me your chart.

VClxXNs3aa	is he breastfed?  my baby was breastfed and sometimes went 5 days without pooping, I was assured it is normal.  if formula fed I dont know.  ETA~ dont know anything about soap, I was told you can use a thermometer and insert to help.....|`|vpL67nETaa	Congrats girl!    Don't worry about the poops just yet.    When you poop, you use the muscles in your bum to push out your excrement (sorry to be graphic) Your baby has never used those muscles, so they're very weak, and they don't know HOW to push out their poops.    It isn't that your son is constipated if he's breastfed, it's just that he can't get those poops out.    My son poops every 4 or 5 days, because he's still little, (8 weeks) and he just can't use those muscles.    Baby suppositores are for constipation. Breastfed babies rarely need suppositories because their stools are soft, and liquidy.  Suppositories are meant for hard stools.  That's odd that your doctor would reccommend putting soap up his butt.... very odd.  I would honestly get a second opinion from another doctor.      To help Landon, when you see he's trying to make a poop, lay him on your lap with your knees elevated (lay in bed with your feet flat on the bed with your knees bent)  Lay him on the slope that your knees create.  Pedal his legs like a bicycle. That helps them utilize those bum muscles that they need to poop.  Everytime he pushes, push firmly on his feet.    When you or I use the bathroom, our feet are planted on the ground, and believe it or not, the pressure of your feet on the floor helps your body go to the bathroom.  The same for babies. You have to create that pressure.    Good for you for breastfeeding!  I'm not going to lie, the first 3 weeks can be VERY challenging, but after that, it's like riding a bike.    Best of luck and congrats!|`|4Bgw5xs8aa	Take a thermometer, and do what you do when taking his rectal temp. Make small little circles with it while in his rectum.

bTlhBX3daa	Yoga would be great. Just make sure you know which positions you can NOT do, you don't want to hurt yourself or the baby.|`|6rl0tQnBaa	yes........it helps u relax to.......|`|Fy9S6hjIaa	When I was pregnant I had high blood pressure from about 20 weeks on.  They put me on bed rest because it was severe.  But, I recently read an article about how some doctors are starting to treat mild to moderate gestational hypertension with exercise rather than bed rest.  So, it sounds like a good thing to try to me.  Not only is it good exercise, it's also relaxing and helps you deal with stress better.|`|h17G3paiaa	Yes Yoga helps but they suggest not doing too many positions after 20 weeks.  I would check with your dr to see if it is okay to do it after 20 weeks|`|r0xNL0ENaa	I don't think exercise/yoga would have much effect.  If you're eating healthy and drinking lots of water, the only thing you can do is keep off your feet and try bedrest as much as possible.
jNErU39iaa	- I went in to labour the day BEFORE my due date, and gave birth the day AFTER my due date!  - Went in to labour naturally, my membranes ruptured at an unknown time and we only discovered they had broken after the doctor tried to break them manually    My birth story goes along something like this-  My daughter was posterior (face UP instead of down) and I couldn't get her out. After 4 hours of pushing (over 48 of labour all up) the 2 midwives and 1 doctor that I had, called in a specialist (at around 11pm!) who finally decided to reach up in to my vagina and turn her the 'right way' up.   I had an episiotomy so they could do this and then she was also suctioned out while I pushed. I had lots of internal stitches as well (from the turning i think.)   I wasn't allowed to have pain relief because my contractions were slowing down instead of speeding up and half the time the sensation to push would disappear. So not only was I denied pain relief, but I was also attached to a hormone drip to try to regulate the contractions.   The placenta was then delivered by 'control cord extraction' which means that they pretty much just pulled it out. I also suffered a primary post partum hemorrhage which meant I lost more blood than usual and had to have a drip in for about 36 hours.  My hospital stay was 3 night.  But my labour and birth was not normal and I think natural childbirth CAN be a very beautiful thing,unfortunately for me it wasn't - but as soon as i met my beautiful little girl the pain went away =]    Every labour and birth is different and I wish you all the best!|`|2HumAy0Jaa	well every pregancy is diffrent. With my first I had to be induced, I was 4 days late. I went in at 6 am and didnt have him untill 6 pm, I pushed for almost 3 hours. It was very painfull for me untill they gave me an epaderial. Than I didn't feel a thing. With my secound I was a week early went to the hospital at 2 am and had him at 10:43 am, with him I only pushed for 4 min. and he was here. I had the epaderial with him to but I still felt the contractions. So you could have your baby early or late or you could have your baby on your due date. My best friend had her first baby on her due date. Sex can help bring on labor the doctor will tell you that. I looked online for hours about bringing on labor but the baby will only come when he/she is ready, Good luck and congrats on your baby|`|w58tUfNOaa	I actually went into labor 2 days early with my first pregnancy, and it turned out to be my second longest pregnancy (I was 1 day late with my younger daughter).    I've found that the best way to induce labor is lots of physical activity, whether it be walking, swimming, cleaning or even sex, even though it is a very appealing idea when you're that late into the pregnancy.|`|ds5MCdS5aa	Congratulations!   I am the Mama of 2, and both of my births were completly natural.  My first child, a son was born on his due date exactly.  It really was a dream birth.

It is what our bodies are meant to do! I'm not against meds...to each her own.  It was just really important to me to experience the|`|vDdHmLk7aa	I just had my son two weeks ago...so it's fresh in my mind, lol.    I was induced at 38 weeks 2 days as they thought he might be IUGR. (Small for gestational age.) On monday morning, they inserted cytotec to help me dilate, and by monday night I was only 3 cm. On tuesday morning they started Pitocin around 7 or so, and at about 9 my Dr. broke my water. By 10 I was in REALLY feeling it...I had intended to do it naturally, and to only consider an epidural if anything, but I wound up getting Stadol first since the anesthesiologist was in surgery and I was seriously hurting. It was awesome...the contractions still hurt, but in between them I was able to relax. The Stadol only lasted about an hour, or less. Then I got the epidural, but it only took on my left side. So I felt everything on the right side, and that was enough. I was at 10 cm by around 12 and pushed for 2 hours and 7 minutes...and then I got an episiotomy, which I watched in the mirror btw. It was pretty surreal. Then my son was born! It was so worth it, which everyone says and is so cliche, but SO true. It's all worth it, and you don't even care about the pain. My experience was not at all what I had planned or expected, but it was GREAT nonetheless. Don't worry, it will all be awesome.   PS bring some donuts for the nurses at the hospital, they'll appreciate it and give you that extra care.|`|GPW6HUZFaa	I was induced at 39 weeks because my daughter had low amniotic fluid.   They started inducing me at 8 pm on a Monday and it wasn't working, so by Tuesday afternoon they put a ball on my cervix to help me dialate.  Then, they stretched me every so often. Then, I had my daughter at almost 5 pm Wednesday.  I had an epidural.  I didn't feel a thing.  I also had an episiotemy and then tore.  It took a couple months to not be sore anymore, but occasionally I still feel achiness in the spot that tore.|`|tbeO3Lataa	Not a mother, but I can answer your questions from a strictly scientific and obstetric standpoint.    Medication free is, in general, safer for the child. This is not to say it is worth it. The chances of having something go wrong with medication are very slim, and you should never feel guilty for wanting to be in less pain than you are.    I am not in anyway an advocate of induction, and I think it is important to find an OB who agrees with your thoughts. Induction makes contractions faster, more intense, and closer together, and is often just not necessary. Many OBs will induce after the due date for worry of the baby getting too big, or the baby going into stress, or even for your comfort.    Many first time babies come after the due date.|`|K6rZmVmAaa	I tried everyhing to bring labour on but it didn't work! I started in slow labour a week late and had my daughter 2 days later.

SGeo7cqYaa	You should be looking for an obstetrician/gynecologist (OB/GYN). They are the ones who deliver your baby and also take care of your prenatal and postnatal needs. They also give you pap smears and breast exams. Basically, its the doctor for "women's needs"|`|zX4nU1Rtaa	u should look for an obgyn they are really easy to find just call around go meet them before u get pregnant so u can decide who is best fit for the job|`|Coc593Ikaa	Well, you should ask yourself a couple of questions and use the answers to narrow it down!    1. Would you prefer an OB/GYN or a midwife? If you are unfamiliar with using a midwife, I suggest you google it. Many are affiliated with doctors at this point, so if you need a C-section for example, the doctor will be called. Also use can use a midwife at a hospital. The advantage is that a midwife will stay with you during labor, while a doctor will be in and out with other obligations.  2. Would you prefer a group practice or a single doctor? With a group, you will want to meet them all as you go through your pregnancy, but you don't know who will be at the birth. The advantage is that you will know whoever shows up to catch the baby. With a single doctor, if he/she is unavailable for whatever reason, you may not recognize the backup doctor.  3. Do you want an all female practice? All male? Does it matter?  4. Which hospital do you want to deliver at. Call that hospital and ask which doctor/practices they work with. Then cross-reference that list with your list from the insurance company.    Good luck!    ADD: I would NOT use a GP or family doctor for this. Their statistics are not ver good compared to OB/GYNs and midwifes.|`|oXCo6VX4aa	You should look for either an ob/gyn or a midwife.

Please remember that, even though you are his mother, it is actually HIS penis, and he should be the one to make that choice when he is willing and able.     Circumcision is on the decline here in the US. More and more parents are deciding against it, as it is a cosmetic procedure with no real proven benefits.    I firmly believe that circumcision is an assault on male sexuality.The part of foreskin that is removed is one of the most sensitive parts of a man's penis. Taking that away from him is unfair and it is no different from female genital mutilation. It has been proven that men who are uncut experience MORE pleasure from sex than men who have been circumcised.    That extra bit of skin is not only there to satisfy the man, it can be felt by the woman during intercourse too. It is my opinion that an uncircumcised penis *feels* better, if you know what I mean.    My husband is uncircumcised. Personally, I find an uncircumcised penis preferable to a circumcised one. Uncircumcised men are much more sensitive down there, they get much more enjoyment out of sex than circumcised men. Before meeting my husband, I had never been with an uncircumcised man before. I had also never been able to reach orgasm during sex before. I am 29 years old, and FINALLY had my first orgasm during sex when I met my husband, at age 27. The foreskin REALLY helps, tremendously!!    There is a GOOD reason that hospitals in Canada are starting to ban routine circumcisions on infants... because circumcision is an unnecessary, cruel, barbaric procedure with no real proven benefits.    Circumcision  http://www.circumcision.org/    Mothers Against Circumcision  http://www.mothersagainstcirc.org/    All of the so called "benefits" of circumcision are bogus. Who do you think pays for these studies? There are certain groups of people that will not allow circumcision to be proven "barbaric and unnecessary" and they tend to have LOTS of money to pump into medical studies about the "benefits" of circumcision. The only real benefit is for the doctor, considering that the doctor performing the operation gets to charge you an extra $300-500, and the hospital bills you out the wazoo for equipment.    Explaining Claims of Medical Benefits:  http://www.circumcision.org/benefits.htm    Recent Medical Studies on Circumcision:  http://www.circumcision.org/studies.htm    It is a myth that the uncircumcised penis is dirty and requires all kinds of special cleaning and retracting the foreskin of baby to *clean* it.    The truth is that uncircumcised penis requires NO special attention. No extra washing. When the child is old enough, the foreskin will retract and then he can wash under while he is showering. Pretty simple if you ask me. Nature designed it that way... Neat, huh? Do you think that Nature made a mistake when designing penises? I don't think so.    I could really go on forever about this. I am vehemently against circumcision because I think it is cruel, barbaric, and unnecessary.    If you are considering circumcision for cosmetic purposes, I urge you to reconsider:    Circumcision to Look Like Others:  http://www.circumcision.org/others.htm    It has been shown that infants suffer from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder following circumcision.    Infant Responses During And Following Circumcision:  http://www.circumcision.org/response.htm    Most countries in Europe do not perform circumcisions because they already KNOW that its a cruel and unnecessary procedure.|`|FidZNMmUaa	You are VERY misinformed. Circumcision is not recommended by the World Health Organization.  There are no benefits to cutting part of your son's penis off.  It is never a good time to circumcise.|`|rFUqIakAaa	It's funny because I just got finished reading a post from a guy wondering how he can get over the resentment he feels from being circumcised. There are a lot of guys who wish that they weren't circumcised so for you to suggest that a boy won't feel this way is rather ignorant. But it's certainly not as ignorant as doing circumcision itself.     Did you even read the link that YOU provided on circumcision...especially the part where the American Academy of Pediatrics says that the benefits are not such that they can recommend circumcision? Or that there is no difference in hygiene? You defied your own argument by providing that link which should tell you that circumcision really makes no since!    It's really a horrible, HORRIBLE thing that some people choose to do to their boys and they really don't even know anything about the penis, the foreskin or why circumcision is even so popular (though not so much anymore) in the US but not in other parts of the world.     You should really check your facts and do a little research into circumcision before you make assumptions like that because the more research ANYBODY does into circumcision, the more they truely turn against it a realize it for what it is, a fraud! Very few guys who are not circumcised ever want to be circumcised (although that option is always up to us at anytime). Far more circumcised boys wish that they weren't but ultimately have to live with what someone else decided they should have.     *Did you know that pediatricians don't recommend circumcision anymore?  *Did you know that removal of the foreskin results in reduced sensitivity and sexual pleasure for men later in life?  *Did you know that they usually don't use anesthesia on newborns during circumcision and the topical agents that some "might" use isn't effective?  *Did you know that it's easier to care for a baby boy with an uncircumcised penis than one with a circumcised one?     I'm sure the answer to all of these is no otherwise you wouldn't have even asked this question. You really should watch a circumcision being done first before you decide to have it done to your kid. See for yourself what they really do and how "painless" it is for the infant. If you can honestly watch a circumcision (and I've included a link to one) and then have your son go through that, then you are a better (sarcastically) person than I am! Do your son a favor a do some research first.|`|d3f01e98de2e5c51674e288f380af4d6aa	Right after birth while you are both in the hospital.|`|rA4F2J6Iaa	my baby was circumcised a couple days after he was born...once he got out of the NICU. the day we were released they did it.

It's not perfect if he doesn't chose it.    Oh are you kidding me?  You are really nieve.    I was circumcised at birth aswell and I can't stand it. It's the worste procedure ever invented.  I don't care if your husband likes it, that doesn't mean your son will.  That's a very poor excuse and actually I grew up around uncircumcised males and my whole life I have wished I had one, so it;s not exactly something to joke about. You are a female and have no idea what it feels like to be missing the most important part of your genitals. don't joke because A LOT of circumcised men feel that way. They want their whole penis, not a cut up one.    And no it's not cleaner to have it done. As long as you are a good parents and teach your child how to shower it's not a big deal.      Sorry but the perfect time to circumcise your child is when he choses it himself.  Only 50% of boys are circumcised now, so your son is going to grow up with uncircumcised boys and he's gonna know that it isn't cleaner or healthier and then you have to exsplain to him why you cut off a part of his body for no reason.    Circumcision actually makes sex less enjoyable too. I am restoring my foreskin and I have felt both sides. believe me, circumcision makes sex A LOT less enjoyable.    It doesn't matter what your husband likes. That's not an excuse to force something like this on your child.  My dad loves popcorn, I can't stand it.

Briana: Some men do decide to get circumcised later in life. It's a personal choice and it's not a traumatic experience. Sure, there's pain, but if the man wants it badly enough he will endure it.    I don't believe in altering the bodies of my children without their permission. They're the ones that are going to have to live in their bodies their entire lives, not me.    Just as a sidenote, don't you find it the slighest bit significant that I'm the only GUY answering this question? Take it from a GUY'S point of view, don't cause harm to your boy. Parents are supposed to protect their children from harm, not cause it.    And if you think circumcision is simply just snipping off some excess skin, read the article below to learn more about it.    "what child is going to look at other penises and say why cant i have tht foreskin?"    Trust me, boys do not hang out in locker rooms comparing penises. And if your son looks different from dad, so be it, it's not going to affect him in any way. He'll just have more skin down there.    "[My husband] had the procedure done as a newborn and he has no regrets towards it."    Of course not, because he has nothing to compare it to. If he had a finger removed at birth, he wouldn't know what it would be like to have that finger since he's lived without it since birth.    "Its actually cleaner to have it done."    This is one of the biggest myths about circumcision. Read that article below, it explains everything.|`|da0bd1389f2c6ba2fe645d6d1c4be705aa	leave him intact! not many women are circumciseing anymore    Give me thumbs down i dont care yall people are cruel to kids and talk all this sh** and dont know the truth!|`|rFtKFp03aa	G - What kind of 21 year old man would say oh wait I do want to be circumcised?? lol Even if he wanted I couldn't see any man going through with it..

The benefits do not outweigh the risks. One analysis found that for every 9 boys who might be spared a UTI by circumcision, another 12 boys at the least (the upper estimate was 40 boys) will experience severe complications from the circumcision. Thats great if your boy is one of the 9, but horrible if he's one of the 12. UTIs can be treated by antibiotics quite effectively. Botched circumcisions are much more difficult to fix. Its also worth noting that 99% of intact boys will never get an infection, compared to 99.9% of cut boys. That means you would have to cut 100 boys to save just one of them from infection. Thats 99 boys cut for no reason at all. Out of every 1000 boys who are cut, one will contract a UTI anyway.    Only 50% of boys nationwide are circumcised. Girls of your son's generation will likely have an entirely different view of circumcision as girls from yours. Just because you think intact is "gross" and "unsanitary" does not mean the women of your son's generation will. after all, think of all the differences between you and your parents. Did you know that when your grandparents were young, circumcision was very uncommon?    Next, it is VERY painful to an infant. Most doctors still don't use any anesthesia, those that do rarely offer adequate anesthesia because the only stuff that works is not safe enough to use in infants for such a "minor" procedure. Further, some of the pain meds offered to infants aren't even recommended for use on babies! Some doctors argue that it has been done "for thousands of years" without anesthetic- what they neglect to tell you is that a medical circumcision can take over 15 minutes to complete. A Jewish ritual circumcision, by contrast, takes under 60 seconds to complete (and the baby is given wine) Here is some info on the pain.....  http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/  http://www.circumcision.org/response.htm  http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/taddio2... (note in this one that even infants offered pain meds for the procedure showed signs of post traumatic stress!)    You should also know that studies have shown that the most sensitive parts of the male anatomy of ON the foreskin- NOT the head of the penis. By cutting off the foreskin, you remove a mans most erogenous genital tissue. Here is a study about that.... (note that other studies found no difference, but they neglected to test the sensitivity of the foreskin- they only tested the glans penis of intact and cut men and didn't pay any attention to the foreskin at all) http://www.nocirc.org/touch-test/touchte...    You should know that infant boys are EASIER to care for when they are intact. The foreskin does not retract until late childhood or even puberty, so you do nothing special, just wipe the outside of his penis clean and leave it alone. Furthermore, to prevent painful and bleeding erections later in life, doctors are now commonly leaving more skin behind- in a cut boy this means you may have to push the left over skin back at every diaper change and clean beneath it to prevent it from adhering or infecting. The very thing that mother's think they avoid by circumcising! In short- Intact = wipe like a finger, NEVER retract Cut= vaseline, clean thoroughly, push back remaining skin to prevent adhesions etc (the last step perhaps for several months or years)    Here is an excellent tutorial on the basics of intact care and circumcision....  http://www.lactivistintactivist.com/?pag...    Another factor in your decision is that circumcised boys experience a 12% increase in their risk of MRSA infection. MRSA is commonly picked up in hospitals (where circumcision is performed in non-sterile conditions) and has been known to kill adults. I wouldn't want to deal with it in an infant. 12% is a BIG risk, the risk of a boy "needing" a circ later in life is WELL below that- under 1%. http://www.nocirc.org/publish/12-Answers...    The so called "benefits" of circumcision are generally trumped up. A big one now is that it "prevents" AIDS. All the studies showing "benefits" like this have been poorly designed and inconclusive. Also, for every study that finds a "benefit" there are more studies that find no benefit. http://www.icgi.org/    It is rather eye-opening to see how circumcision first became popular in the US to begin with. It was virtually unknown in this country until the 20th century. This slide show takes you through the rise of circumcision.... http://youtube.com/watch?v=f4unKTMpBGA    Finally, you should watch a video or two of the procedure so you are fully informed of what your infant will go through. I will warn you that these are graphic. If you can't handle watching them as an adult, why would you expect your infant son to endure them?  Gomco Clamp- http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=...

Good luck hun.|`|aWkp6AJOaa	you could still be pregnant & it may take a couple more days before you have enough hcg to show up.  maybe call your dr & find out if they can do a blood test it will definitely be able to tell you if you are preggers.  it does sound like implantation bleeding.  if you don't call the dr i would test by friday if you can wait that long.  good luck to you.|`|drzN1kkuaa	are you on brith control?  because bc can do that, it shortens and lightens your period.    and no your not prgnant if you had your period
aMZ7IKysaa	Slings are so much easier.  Those carriers are not designed for us, and with the boobs and belly in the way I always felt like I was suffocating my daughter.  There was just no room.  Not to mention it was embarrasing to wear because it was tight and chub stuck out all over from it.  Stick with the sling, its much more comfortable for everyone|`|cY8DgJv5aa	Baby carriers.... Do you mean like the car seat carrier or just the slings and backpacks and such?    I'm plus size as well.  Varied between an 18 and 20 just after my babies were born.  I'm also a DD in the chest.  If you are referring to the slings and backpacks, a normal backpack style carrier worked well for me.  You could carry baby on your back or in the front.  I never had any issues since the straps are so easily adjustable.  My sister got me a sling that was made for different sizes (could get small, medium, etc).  It also worked well.  You could use it for much longer too, so I really enjoyed it.  I can still use it on my 18 month old son.  You can position it so that they can sit on your hip and still be supported by the sling.  Takes the load off my back.  I suggest a sling.  You'll just have to shop around and see which one works best for you.|`|bc29eaf19302ac3e6d0492b8facf1027aa	The moby wrap is a really long piece of stretchy fabric. It works great.    The mei tai carrier is also very versatile.  It has very long straps that fit just about anyone.|`|pTBhq0rHaa	I am a plus size woman 16W, and I used just the regular baby carrier, where the handle is very plush. Sears, Walmart, and even ToysRUs, Just due to it being on my forearm alot, I wanted something that was thick and soft. Good luck.|`|Fd4lITkvaa	I'm not plus size but my husband is and likes the Ergo carrier we have. We got the waist extension for it and it works great.    ETA: I am very heavy chested, H cup, and it's comfortable in that area as well.
fHuvS29laa	If there is no pattern then they are Braxton Hicks... However; if you have more than 4 in a single hour then call your Dr as you may be getting ready to go into pre term labor.    As far as being painful or not... I have been having 4 hour episodes of Braxton Hicks with some painful, some uncomfortable, and some barely noticable... I am 33 weeks and started to dilate as of last week (and before I was told the >4 per hour CALL)...    I'll see if I'm more dilated when I go in for my appointment on Monday... If I am, I am worried they may put me out of work early... I kinda hope not for a few more weeks!!! (Still training my maternity coverage at work)...    Best of luck, love, and health to and your little ones!!!|`|pZCWKlkVaa	Sounds like you are really close but at the moment it doesn't sound like you are actually in labour. If there starts to be a regular patten or  your waters break then you will want to contact your midwife or whoever is helping you through the birth. Until then have a hot bath and distract yourself!  xx|`|TE4au2sDaa	contractions|`|J50nFxXqaa	hi, I had exactly the same for four days and was continously told they were braxton hicks when in fact they were contractions.  It started like you said as bad pains but not all the time - sometimes it was every twenty minutes then i wouldn't feel a thing for a couple of hours.  Everyone, including my doctor and midwife kept saying it was braxton hicks and then on the fourth day they suddenly started coming every 15 minutes and gradually the time in between decreased.  So it is quite possible they are contractions. Also my waters never broke, and the midwife had to break it for me at the hospital so you can't always rely on that either.  Good luck!
MQGFjbVUaa	As long as you are in your room I do not see a problem with it. I think they might be uncomfortable with it because they do not want to walk in on you while you are naked. You could make a privacy sign to hang on your door. I would also suggest putting on clothes when you leave your room not just a towel or robe, it might help them to be more accepting. I really dislike wearing clothes as well, so to stay comfortable I wear loose fitting clothes and mainly night gowns when at home.|`|cgk2yefUaa	I have NEVER allowed my daughter to have a problem being naked !!! she is ALWAYS naked in the house and she is 7 altho she would now put clothes on and cover herself up if she feels someone like my friends are in wereas when she was younger she didint bother !!!!  i dont mind my daughter being naked and have no hang ups with my body either as we always see each other naked !!  the problems are caused by other people thats what you have to make sure you are safe and AWAY from prying eyes !!!!    ALSO i allow my daughter out playing in a swimsuit in the summer !!! just getting that in as thats another MAJOR debate on here somtimes LOL !!!!!!!!!!!    HOPE THAT HELPS HONEY !!!|`|YFMaRxaWaa	i wouldn't care if you were in your room naked.that's your private area.my concern is why don't you like wearing pj's or something.|`|vOMuBuw4aa	If you send me pics, it's fine|`|vIiUsSIDaa	No, but you know if it got around i don't know but people might think its like child mistreatment or some thing dumb like that there probably just over reacting in my opinion.|`|3fQYEnTMaa	They probably think you doing something else, like masturbating ALL the time. That could possibly raise some concerns.|`|kbnyO8a3aa	I believe that you should be able to be naked in your room, but I don't think it's appropriate for you to enter other parts of the house in a towel or robe when you know your parents are opposed to the being naked in the first place. It's a slap in the face to them that you are "being naked " when you walk around with a towel on. See if you can compromise by asking them if they would object to you being naked in your room if you are sure to be fully dressed when you exit it. Until you pay the bills, you really need to respect your parents.|`|G2auAv1Saa	Yes I would care if I were your parent. In a house other than yours it is inappropriate, especially if you have been asked not to do so.   Perhaps they are concerned with peeping toms, there being an emergency and you being naked or that you lack any form of modesty. When you move out of your parents house then you are free to live by your standards while you are there adhere to theirs.|`|FYjf7hkEaa	ok - your weird.|`|kX1PolCUaa	how do they know youre naked in your room o.O?|`|JI7NQ9TNaa	Not at all.    We raised our daughter to be comfortable in her skin.  BUT...she very early on decided she had the right to choose who to be "comfortable" with. Meaning, she acquired modesty on her own.    Today she is nearly 18, and never shows her navel.     In other words...we let her decide for herself!|`|Y0O6971laa	I've heard over five it is a problem.  They're probably uncomfortable with all they're seeing.  What if they walked around in towels?|`|toLCaFc9aa	I wouldn't care if my child does that. I don't have any but when i do I wouldn't mind. If it is comfortable for you no problem. I would do it if it wasn't because I have to be around the house all the time. maybe they don't like it because they think you are maybe doing 'bad' things in your room, or just because. But it is your choice.|`|iNFE3utOaa	not appropriate|`|e76YTRiBaa	If I had kids I'd find it perfectly reasonable for them to be naked in their room.    Although maybe they don't want to accidentally walk in or something. So... meh|`|qpln6o9Yaa	You are in your parents home and they set the rules. When you are on your own, be as naked as you want, anytime you want. It may not make sense to you, but they have their standards in their home and are in charge.|`|4DoXomHZaa	A towel to come out in is inappropriate. A robe is not much better.    It's about decency. It's unnerving for parents to know their older, developed child is naked in their rooms.     You should NOT lock yourself in your room. And you should respect your parents wishes. It is their house, their rules, and you are a minor. When you move out, be naked all you want to be.|`|IGz2wBj5aa	Hell no. I'm the same way. It's extremely comfortable and no one can see me. It's not like they know what's going on behind that door anyways. The birthday suit is best in my opinion when you're in your room.|`|skslxcvPaa	ok, if you were wearing a bra and underwear, That will be ok, but completely NO clothes on, um...That's alttle weird.|`|547Ln6rNaa	Gosh I would have bet money that this would be a landslide victory for nudity - I am stunned to see people who think/say they would care!    You weren't *suppose* to have clothes. Depending on what you believe, God didn't give you clothes and you didn't physically evolve a genital cover - so neither God nor evolution are worried about nudity.    In your own space (your room), in your own time, it's really not any one else's business if you have clothes on or not, however, I think if you are wandering round the house, you should dress. This is their house and they make the rules as long as you live at home.|`|aZoCKGciaa	Most people are uncomfortable with the idea of being naked unless its for a sexual situation. And so I think it is the same situation for your parents, they feel uncomfortable. I think its great that you feel no need to stay clothed all the time. Its free and no big deal when you really think about it. If I was your parent I wouldn't have a problem with it. Its just a body and every one has one. It is their house, but your room is your own space. They aren't in there with you, and so I see absolutely no problem with being naked in your own company.|`|cYsPx9sSaa	are u a naturalist?|`|A6DihblGaa	uhh, as long as nobody sees|`|IcPPQXqQaa	i do not because that leads to porn|`|GIkyDUulaa	I wouldn't, but then again, they are your parents and you have to respect their wishes.    wait until you move out and you can be naked anytime you want :]|`|QaVerTAfaa	i do the same thing after showers. i brush out my hair and stuff and moisterize and then get dressed for bed. so im naked for a good 30 minutes in my room|`|tNvz2JLiaa	Haha weird question, but if you have a lock on your door you should be fine. Plus you shouldnt tell your parents you like to be naked...|`|KjzUDcF8aa	there just lookin out for you   paedophiles from across the street or something ;)|`|zINpyGu2aa	no this is not right your room is your space and you should beable to do what you want, roam around naked if you want to lol!  its nobodys problem unless your naked in front of them, is it?|`|BHYqBizzaa	i wouldn't care!!! can I come over to your house... I would love to see your bedroom!!! lol ;-) I would love pictures too, if you want!!|`|K2fqtkh6aa	yes i care you should just put ur kid in a jail and u can go with him for being a bad mother!!!!stupid queston|`|xSfgrdFJaa	i grew up in a naked house and have no problem with my son being naked round the house now, (he is 3) I think its perfectly normal to feel at ease with no clothes on, and personally I think its the people who think its weird who have the problem, cos like whats gunna happen???? I still get changed in front of both my parents and its not biggie at all, im 26 by the way. You do what feels ok by you.  God its only skin whats the big deal were all the same underneath who cares.....there are a lot of prudes judging by the other answers..funny!|`|Ir4754CNaa	how old are you?  do you have a man?|`|JHqFSmFyaa	Ummm It is creepy... Why can't you just put on sweatpants and a baggy t shirt? I don't know why you would want to be nude what if your dad walked in and saw you? When I saw this I thought you meant like a small child. If youv gone through puberty it's creepy
eeGN977eaa	You are NOT alone! My 7 year old has been going through this stage (at least I hope it is just a stage). Everything is so dramatic. I just remind myself that she is experiencing emotions that she probably doesn't understand and that the things that she is upset about are very important to her even though they may seem silly to me. I just let her blow off steam and when she is calm I giver her a hug and we talk about it.|`|prqrQcd1aa	My 7 year old can be like that sometimes, i put her in the corner as soon as she starts acting this way and tell her that i will not put up with it. It will usually go away at a certain age, then come back full force times 10 once she is a teenager!|`|fdnbXfvfaa	Oh, ive seen that all right.  To make matters worse both myself and her dad, have fiery personalities, so she takes after both of us at the same time.  Make sure she knows, you won't put up with bad behaviour.  I have lots of people saying, "oh she is just a child, leave her be" and blah blah blah. Yeah wait till my 5 year old smack talker is 16 and has turned into a next generation of how I was.  Try nip it in the bud now|`|PFO1jxZGaa	:/   hmm.. mine is only 18 mos and her drama level has reach astronomical heights... drama drama... I'm scared now...  Even right after she was born the dr took one look at her and said, oh yeah, shell be a drama queen. just listen to her... yikes.. I was hoping she was going to grow out of it :(|`|HyknHVV5aa	Do the 3-5 rules. You give her 3 strikes (anything that is violent is an automatic time out), after she reaches strike 3, you put her on a chair facing the corner for 5 mins straight. If she keeps walking around or not sitting for the whole 5 mins, add another 5 to it, etc. It may add up to 45 mins in the end, but stick it out and make her sit there. She will learn that when she hears the "That's 1 Carlie." she will being to listen because she knows if she hears "That's 3 Carlie, 5 mins in time out!" that you mean business and she would rather keep playing then sitting in a chair.     I'd suggesting buying this book, it helped me allot! That's where I got the idea above from! http://www.amazon.com/1-2-3-Magic-Effect...|`|NNcdVfoiaa	I have a six year old daughter too.  She is the biggest smart *** of all time.  It's pretty funny sometimes though and it's hard not to laugh.  Other times it pisses me off.  Your guess is as good as mine.  Maybe it's the age and stuff they're picking up at school.|`|1bf2f9586d3ad537a73d55b79612e926aa	Is it going to get worse OMG YES YES YES!!!!  Wish I had words of encorgement but as the mother of 4 girls ages 22, 14 ,8 and 3 all I can say is it is going to get much much worse before it gets better. Teenage girls are the most frustrating creatures on the face of the earth.|`|4gZYucHMaa	I believe you're talking about my 6 yr old turning 16!    Somewhere along the time she was four and started school to now I don't know where my blue eyed angel is?    I'm scared when she hits the hormonal stage!!    For me, I don't have a relationship whatsoever with my mom so I try to be real patient with my dd, not easy but I put the foot down when I need to but I relax on others--in otherwords, I pick my battles.
SxxXBC4vaa	honey u really need to call your doctor! I've been having contractions on and off for 2 weeks now, and I'm also 34 weeks. and u r right its to early to have the baby now.. don't worry about 'bothering' anyone.. its better to be safe than sorry! def. call ur doctor. good luck.|`|28fNd725aa	I would call your dr just to be safe!!|`|yOFWD0unaa	Dude call now!

I had the same thing(braxton-hicks) with my daughter for almost 2 months before she was born.  Hang in there and good luck!!
aJLx0nhNaa	Weissbluth doesn't really offer a method of sleep training in his book and he allows for parents that are uncomfortable with "cry it out" methods.  Mostly the book is a discussion of the importance of sleep and makes recommendations about the timing and duration of the ideal amount of baby sleep.  He passes on suggestions for solving sleep issues at different ages.    I found the book to be a little dry, but very helpful.  I think he allows for a lot of different situations, which many "sleep training methods" don't.  What I mean is, he discusses situations where only one parent is raising the child, where there are other kids, where the mother needs to return to work soon, etc.  I liked that the book was pretty open to many different parenting, including co-sleeping.    I've found some of the insights in the book very helpful and I think my 7 month old son sleeps better as a result of my reading it.  I would ignore any knee-jerk reactions from people who obviously haven't read the book.  Weissbluth does advocate some form of cry it out, but it's not like that's what the book is about, or that you can't learn a great deal from it if cry it out isn't an option for you.    Edited:  Bracing myself for some thumbs down on this, yes we have let our son do some crying, and yes, it did work.  :)|`|68c6B8dRaa	"Has anyone tried to use Weissbluth's sleep training to help their babies get the right amount of sleep?"    I -- having read the book -- can't believe anybody falls for this. "Sleep training" to "help" babies get the "right amount"...come on, you've swallowed a load and on some level you must know that...    On his "research": http://talaris.org/pdf/research/CIOPoste...
QsbB6vkoaa	i'm sorry but yeah your idea sounds kinda tacky.  and he might feel embarrased. i mean it's great when we girls receive flowers and chocolates but guys are different. i think that the best way it's best if you do it in person (but not with his friends around) or by text. you can say something like " hey, i wanted to ask you if you already have a date to the dance?" that way you wont seem all clingy. and if he says he doesn't, tell him " oh that's cool, because i wanted to ask if you wanted to come with me?" it's far more casual.  i mean what you were planning to do is very sweet but should leave that for when you guys have your first month anniversary.  good luck i hope he says yes|`|Osn1xpu6aa	Ditch that idea, seriously.   You could just ask him face to face without anything cutesy attached.    or...if you INSIST on cuteness, you could slip a note into his locker or something. Just please don't do the hershey kiss thing.|`|UxMugqdraa	To be honest, i'd just ask straight up. I'm the forward person and i think guys don't like the trouble of wanting to know what us girls want or think. So just say "wanna go to the dance with me?" If he says no then act like it didn't hurt u even if it did.|`|14pjwQPLaa	Haha, now you know what guys have to go through whenever they work up the nerve to ask a guy out!      Don't chicken out by writing note -- just go up to him and say, "Would you like to go to the Sadie Hawkins dance with me?"  He'll either say, "Sure", or "uhhhh . . .. ok", or "let me check and see if I'm doing anything that night (i.e., see if another girl is going to ask me)")  It's better than wondering if he got the note.
dd6rgtL7aa	Yes. You SHOULD find another ride. It is messed up. You are being treated unfairly. And no - its not awkward to ask.     I would tell my instructor about the situation and ask him/her to help.|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	Don't give them, any gas money!!  They are using you!!|`|xWfrA3vqaa	Hmm, well, you definitely shouldn't have to pay THAT much for rides to the gym, unless it's really that far away. Maybe it its close, you can bike there? You should definitely try asking others there about a ride though first.|`|QJWn3GWOaa	I wouldn't pay for them. If they're going to mess you around then I wouldn't let them freeload off you. If they're going to the gym anyway then why are they asking for gas money? They're just getting money off you.    Don't pay for them.  Get a different ride.    :)|`|3CKWByxgaa	that sounds like a pretty crappy deal on your part, nearly 300 a month just for a ride, and they have the guts to stand you up, ask you to pay for gas money? What kind of deal is that. Is there maybe cabs in your area. If you's old enough to drive, the money you pay for their membership, you could get  a decent car, and still have money for insurace.|`|bKwQyCEHaa	I would take the bus or walk! YOu are paying to much i wouldn't pay for all of that for them!|`|kK8JAMvUaa	That is crazy.  Membership for carpooling??  I think you should find another ride.|`|eKaGmMzTaa	Paying their membership fees and gas and more is just stupid! That is way to much money. I think you should definitely find a new ride. Is there a bus available that you can take? You can take a monthly pass which is very cheap and affordable. Or If possible, see if your mom can take you or your dad. Any aunts and uncles? If all does not work, see if a friend wants to join. You guys can go together and have fun too. If that doesn't work either, then ask the staff if anyone is available for rides. That's what I would do. So I hope I helped ?|`|yPjw6lzYaa	get a different ride asap! you have been more then nice. or the other option would be to give them gas money but stop paying for the gym membership. i would give them the choice|`|1dd029e8da5e4b3a5424b7f3e050f9f2aa	They are taking advantage of you and you need to stop and find another ride before this ruins your friendship with the person completely.    I know what it is like to be stuck without transportation and have to rely on other people, it sucks. You have paid them a lot of money and they have a lot of moxie to ask for gas money. Cut your losses and find another ride to and from the MMA training. They find it easy to take advantage of you and will continue to do so.    Is there a bulletin board in there where you can post a note asking for a ride? Or if you are friendly with any of the trainees where one might live close enough to you to get a ride? It does suck asking people so if you have no public transportation to get there and a taxi will be too expensive each day, you need to ask someone or these other people will continue to drain you mentally and monetarily.    Good luck!

u12eVaDhaa	Hi, the main thing to remember at this age is that 'Food before 1 is just for fun'.  The major part of a baby's calories right up to beyond 12 months should still come from breastmilk (well done you for continuing the breastfeeding).  Can I suggest you google 'baby-led weaning'?  You might find it really interesting.  I wish I'd found out about it before I did the 'mush' thing with my kids!!!    Best wishes|`|A6DihblGaa	ugh|`|Fd4lITkvaa	Solids are just for practice until 1yr old. You should feed solids then top her off with breast milk or you can give cereal as a between meals snack an hour or so after breastfeeding and let her eat until she is done.|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	top her off at the breast   i do that with my son but he gets the bottle after hes done     and hes eating the jarred foods|`|nKXTjqQWaa	My son is 5 months and he eats 3 tablespoons cereal mixed with one ounce water and 1 ounce jarred baby food mixed in. Your little one could eat at least 2 - 2 1/2 ounces of cereal (after mixed) If she eats say every two hours I would nurse her, then one hour later offer cereal and maybe a drink of breast milk to wash it down the nurse again in an hour.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	i would offer her more...i always topped up my daughter with formula after a solid meal as she wa sthirsty etc. i wouldnt worry about it as shes only starting out. shell soon tell you if she wants more. if shes doing fine at 1 serving a day after a week or so you could always add a second serving and so on then gradully increase the amounts at a serving. breastmilk/formula is the main source in the first year and after that the oppisite so work towards that...she sounds like shes doing great and your doing just fine:)) but i would just leave thatamount and thenm add another serving a day when you feel shes ready:) good luck|`|uKMTYj4haa	my son had farex from 5 months, and he always had a big breast feed after a meal, he has 2 serves of food a day now (he is 8 1/2 months) with no feed immediatly after. what you are doing sounds like what we did! id say that your doing a fantastic job!|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	If you are bottle feeding breastmilk it is just as possible to overfeed the baby as if the bottle contains formula.  The bottle is the problem, not the formula.  A breastfed baby really shouldn't be getting much more than 30oz per day.    Cereal is among the worst foods for breastfed babies (even WIC is planning on replacing it if they can ever get the new package approved).  You really can not replace breastmilk with cereal.    http://www.kellymom.com/bf/pumping/milkc...  The research tells us that exclusively breastfed babies take in an average of 25 oz (750 mL) per day between the ages of 1 month and 6 months. Different babies take in different amounts of milk; a typical range of milk intakes is 19-30 oz per day (570-900 mL per day).     http://kellymom.com/nutrition/solids/sol...  How often and how much?    Introduce your baby gradually to solid foods. Once she accepts them (it might take some time), continue breastfeeding as often as before and add solids as your baby's appetite increases. A few bites once a day is enough in the beginning, but gradually increase. Following are some general guidelines - if baby starts solids later than six months, then proceed in a similar manner, at baby's pace.    [...]    6 - 7 months   Offer solids once a day, at most. Many start out offering solids every few days or even less often.    Why not cereal?    http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9646449/page...  Take rice cereal, for example. Under conventional American wisdom, it's the best first food. But Butte says iron-rich meat  often one of the last foods American parents introduce  would be a better choice.    Dr. David Ludwig of Children's Hospital Boston, a specialist in pediatric nutrition, says some studies suggest rice and other highly processed grain cereals actually could be among the worst foods for infants.    "These foods are in a certain sense no different from adding sugar to formula. They digest very rapidly in the body into sugar, raising blood sugar and insulin levels" and could contribute to later health problems, including obesity, he says.    The lack of variety in the American approach also could be a problem. Exposing infants to more foods may help them adapt to different foods later, which Ludwig says may be key to getting older children to eat healthier.    http://www.kellymom.com/nutrition/solids...  Cereal is not at all necessary, particularly the baby cereals. Regular (whole grain) oatmeal is more nutritious for your baby.    http://www.askdrsears.com/faq/ci2.asp  The truth is, there is nothing special about these foods that makes them better to start out with. Babies don't actually even need rice cereal    http://www.llli.org/llleaderweb/LV/LVDec...  Meat provides additional protein, zinc, B-vitamins, and other nutrients which may be in short supply when the decrease in breast milk occurs. A recent study from Sweden suggests that when infants are given substantial amounts of cereal, it may lead to low concentrations of zinc and reduced calcium absorption (Persson 1998). Dr. Nancy Krebs has shared preliminary results from a large infant growth study suggesting that breastfed infants who received pureed or strained meat as a primary weaning food beginning at four to five months, grow at a slightly faster rate. Dr. Krebs' premise is that inadequate protein or zinc from complementary foods may limit the growth of some breastfed infants during the weaning period. Both protein and zinc levels were consistently higher in the diets of the infants who received meat (Krebs 1998). Thus the custom of providing large amounts of cereal products and excluding meat products before seven months of age may not meet the nutritional needs of all breastfed infants.  Meat has also been recommended as an excellent source of iron in infancy. Heme iron (the form of iron found in meat) is better absorbed than iron from plant sources. In addition, the protein in meat helps the baby more easily absorb the iron from other foods. Two recent studies (Makrides 1998; Engelmann 1998) have examined iron status in breastfed infants who received meat earlier in the weaning period. These studies indicate that while there is not a measurable change in breastfed babies' iron stores when they receive an increased amount of meat (or iron), the levels of hemoglobin circulating in the blood stream do increase when babies receive meat as one of their first foods.      http://www.westonaprice.org/children/nou...  Finally, respect the tiny, still-developing digestive system of your infant. Babies have limited enzyme production, which is necessary for the digestion of foods. In fact, it takes up to 28 months, just around the time when molar teeth are fully developed, for the big-gun carbohydrate enzymes (namely amylase) to fully kick into gear. Foods like cereals, grains and breads are very challenging for little ones to digest. Thus, these foods should be some of the last to be introduced. (One carbohydrate enzyme a ba

4D1VEKW5aa	Welll, everybody and their mother is naming thier sons jacob nowadays.

OR you could name him Ethan Jacob.|`|weckW02caa	Ethan should be his first and let jack be his middle name.|`|jssS7YULaa	Obviously Jake is short for Jacob, still a beautiful name. Play with the name Ethan Jacob (last name), or Jacob Ethan (last name). I have a friend nick-named Jeb after the first letters in his initials, so if your baby's name will make a cute nick name that is an option too. That's always cute and he can later choose what he prefers to go by. Another friend goes by Jake, his middle name, even though his first name is just John.
x6fZXjotaa	seems odd that the Dr ones keep giving you a negative.     Clear blue or discovery tests are the best for detecting very small trace of the pregnancy hormone. did you do a urine sample at the Dr when taking the test? and what time of day was it. As the first morning wee, is usually the best as the hormone is at its highest ( not  diluted by food and drink).   I would suggest getting them to re-test you, and if its still negative insisting on blood tests to know for certain. if she refuses, ask to see another doctor. with my first son i did 2 tests both positive, Dr didn't even bother to make me take another one at the surgery.     Also, there is more chance of getting a false negative result on a pregnancy test , than there is a false positive.  hope that helps.|`|r52rfBkeaa	I was told by a nurse that the tests the doctors use are the same type of tests that are available to us over the counter.  Perhaps your next visit should be earlier in the day?  I know your hcg levels are highest then.  Or maybe the test you took was just a fluke and came back with a false negative.  Crazy they won't do a blood test... I guess you don't have a choice but to go back later in the week!  Bummer!|`|z7w6xyOKaa	Wow I always thought the ones they use at the doctors detected at higher levels than HPTs... Just keep trying I guess. Or maybe have them do a blood test... Good luck

IJ0xybVYaa	With the tubes, there is a vacuum, but if you take the top of the vacuum is gone and therefore the tube cannot be used. As for the holders well everywhere is different, but really it should be used once only because on the holder there is a twirly thing where you put the needle, they become frayed.    I have collected blood for 16 years. Why are you asking these questions?|`|AA10186411	What?  The vacutainer cannot be "opened".  The needle is stuck into the rubber top and thats how the blood gets into it.  And no, you do not reuse them, they are disposed of.|`|BDuKWneiaa	If you pop the top before using the tube, it won't draw, the vacuum is the reason it draws.  The holder technically can be reused, but it should never be standard practice to use it more then once for hygiene reasons and such.  The tubes cannot be reused.  Generally there's some solution in each tube that makes it unique, and you can't replace that, you also can't make it sterile again since the blood goes through the rubber cap, you can't sterilize that.  though why you'd want to reuse a tube I don't know...
QsbB6vkoaa	the best way to gain confidence is by getting ready, the best you think you can do. do your hair, your make-up, your nails, dress in your most comfortable jeans, and go to the mall. when you see a pile of guys just walk by them, and if you are feeling kind of insecure, just say this in your head " the only reason they are staring at you is because you look HOT". and smile and say hi.  also high heels give me confidence and i always feel at my best when i look good.   the best way to feel confident is to know that people like you, so never be mean, always be the person who gives the compliments, and who smiles at everyone even if they are rude.   truthfully i think that people like me because i am really fun to be around with. don't do what other people do, just to fit in. ( i.e if a guy says a joke and everybody acts all annoyed, you should laugh, then that guy will want to be around you because you are fun ) and because he will feel like he can be himself around you.  people think confidence comes by speaking up in front of every body but really that only leaves you feeling awkward, unless you really want to speak up of course.  like i said when you are in a group try to be part of the conversation, ask questions, and have fun.  as for talking to boys, just pass by and smile then he will feel comfortable coming to you.  or if you are sitting in a bench on the mall and you see a cute guy, just look at him, when he turns to look at you, smile, make eye contact and look away. and do it more times and if he doesn't come talk to you, when you leave look at him again, then smile and bite your bottom lip and if smiles wave good bye. I PROMISE YOU this works, i did this a thousand times. and just by doing this often you will begin gaining new confidence, then you wont even have to practice it'll just come naturally (your essential flirtness)|`|i8OlEAHjaa	i felt the same way i learned that its easiest to try and get to know some of ur closest friends, friends and their friends and their friends and sooner than u know it u have a whole bunch of friends.

I'm going through the same thing. I think we should let our personality out little by little everyday. Let's show the world who we are! I get tired of people saying "i can't beleive you get mad" or "you cussed!" or "u actually talk, n u talk a lot" or "you slapped a girl!" Like they know me enough to say what i do n don't do.|`|k59DpeQnaa	I am 15 as well and I used to be extremely shy.  Here is what I have learned in my last two years of high school:  - I will say "hi" to the people that i want to (boys too!) and I will be a generally nice person.  I have no problem with that  -If someone doesn't like me for going up and saying "hi" to them, they can think whatever they want because obviously they're rude and can't accept kindness  -My REAL friends love me for who I am and nothing I can do will change that.  -People will respect you more if you don't care if they like you or not  - Just be yourself.
UUpsa35Daa	I don't think trying to break her in juvi will help anything. The whole experience traumatized her and of course she's scared, anybody would be.    Maybe she can go to a counselor a few times to see if he/she can get her talk about it openly. There she won't have the pressure of the lawyers or the defendant or the judge bearing down on her. From there, all she'll have to overcome is her fear of reliving seeing it all happen, which might take some time. But if the lawyers are dead set on getting this guy, which they should be, they shouldn't mind waiting a week or week and a half.|`|wENdWT5kaa	I understand that it is very very important that she needs to testify, BUT you need to think of what your daughter is going through mentally. She seen some get raped and killed. I can't imagine the damage that can do to someone.     Your daughter was traumatized and probably wants to forget the whole thing.     First, i think you need to get your daughter professional help. Maybe the psychologist will be able to help her with this tough situation.     But i really don't know what to suggest to get  her to testify.|`|ibWLdXlJaa	It sounds like she needs counseling to help her deal with what she saw before she can openly talk about it in court. I'm sorry this happened to her and I hope she can overcome it.    They can send her to juvenile detention if they choose. Regardless of her age if she is subpoenaed to go and she doesn't they can find her in contempt. There isn't anything you can about it it's up to the judge. It's sad they would do that to a 14 yr old but they can.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	Oh god, poor thing. No wonder she doesn't wanna talk about it.  My advice would be to get her a shrink or someone to talk to.  What an awful experience for a child.  She should be getting help, not being pressured|`|prqrQcd1aa	Get her to a therapist to talk about it. Tell her that if she doesn't testify that you and her could both get into trouble.. i'm assuming you can too since she is too young. Why was she allowed to just wonder off with a friend at 12 years old?? Especially when she was supoce to be in court? I wouldn't have her go to juive if i could help it, have you tried to explain to her that if she does not testify that the man could be let go, and then could do the same things to other women???  The best thing i would say to do is get her into some therapy and then go from there! She is proabally in shock still and is very very afraid. She needs some professional help, and then get her to testify. Yes, they can't hold the guy forever, the the statute of limitations on things like this does not end, let her testify when she is ready...after she's gotten some help!|`|ZcsMEmLnaa	I don't think they can hold her in jail considering she hasn't done anything wrong. Maybe tell her that if she doesn't do something that this guy can hurt another innocent person. That next time it could be a friend of her's instead... Or maybe have the police take her back to the interrogation and trick her. It's bad to do but we don't need a man like this on the streets. Have them ask her questions about it while she is being taped. Or maybe she will do it if she talks directly to the judge. It is highly risky having your daughter exposed like that though... I wouldn't want to do it either! I don't see how the only way he will be put in jail is her testifying though. If they had enough evidence to take him to jail they should have enough to convict him. And besides that shouldn't they have already talked to her about the murder and everything else? All that is recorded. They should be able to use that.|`|zHRWklEWaa	Why not try to talk to some kind of tramua conseluer to help with the shock of witnessing a violent crime and see if that will offer any solutions.|`|w3tNq8npaa	You should tell her that if she wants to keep another person from getting hurt she needs to help and tell the court what she saw.Ask her what she would do if it were her best friend that that had happened to.|`|BOCqxUagaa	dont send the girl to juvie because she's scared!

Throwing her in juvie will only make her feel more alone than she already feels! she doesnt belong with criminals, she needs counseling. And if the police cause any more mental damage by threatening her like that i'd sew their a*ses. Thats absolutely ridiculous. Mae sure she gets counseling asap. Be gentle with her and try and tell her to put herself in that family's shoes. And continue to beg her.  but dont be hostile for goodness sake. If she knows that HE knows that she was the only witness, i'd be terrified too. When that jerk gets out (if he does get out) then i'd be terrified he come and get me too. Its not her fault.

Each month when you ovulate, a little "cyst" swells up & "pops" releasing the egg into your fallopian tubes. This happens to every woman. Some women feel it and others don't. Sometimes, it can even cause a light amount of bleeding. Cysts can show up on ultrasounds, but once they pop, they disappear. There is no cure for cysts. Surgery is a last resort; it's only used if it's cancerous or golf ball size or larger. Consider all of this a GOOD sign b/c it means the Clomid is making you ovulate! =)    I can feel my cysts every month-- and it's excruciatingly painful each time. I've gone to numerous doctors, and they've all told me the same thing: it means you just ovulated. It's normal. Nothing they can do, etc.

u12eVaDhaa	Hi, I was so SCARED of labour with my first, but it was so wonderful!  Basically I got to 40 weeks and 4 days.  I was due Xmas day so it was the 29th December!  Anyway I had really bad constipation (TMI!) and I took some laxatives (suitable ones for pregnancy).  Well I woke up at about 3am, needing the loo.  So I went and felt REALLY good for the first time in ages, if you know what I mean.  Anyway I was just going back to bed and I thought, 'oh no, I feel sick now'.  I went back to the bathroom and vomited up everything in my stomach.  I immediately felt better which I thought was wierd.  Anyway I set off back to bed, feeling tired.  I got halfway along the hallway and suddenly was just grabbed by this amazing contraction.  I knew INSTANTLY that it was, there was no doubt at all, it was so powerful.  I was on all fours shouting for my husband (well, when I could speak) and he came and rang the midwife.  She came straight out and said I was already 5 cm so I must've been labouring in my sleep and the vomiting and toilet trip were part of the labour.  Anyway I must say I think my labour was marvellous.  It was fast and furious.  I screamed all the way to hospital - not so much because of the pain but because it felt good to scream!!!!!    When I arrived at Hospital they arranged for me to have a spinal / epidural anaesthetic which was just quite frankly, blissful.  I promptly fell asleep and was prodded repeatedly by the midwife and my husband who were in my opinion just jealous that I was getting to sleep through this!!!!    Anyway around 9.20 am I was told I could push so I did and then they screamed at me to stop because they weren't ready!!!  I think they thought it would take a while and a good few pushes but it was really quick!!! I'm tall with size 8 / 42 feet so I think that helps.  Apparently if you've got big feet then chances are you've got a big pelvis for the baby to come through.  But having said that I have friends with tiny feet who've had babies in MINUTES!    Anyway I remember the midwife telling me the baby had red hair which was just so exciting to know.  We already knew we were having a girl.  She was delivered onto my stomach which was FANTASTIC, so moving and natural and lovely.    With my son, I lost my mucous plug one afternoon.  I shouted my husband to come and look.  He came and was DISGUSTED that I got him to look!!!  Ha ha, it was so funny.  Anyway, I had no other signs and went to bed that night.  At about 12.30 am I woke suddenly and realised it was because I'd felt my waters break.  I got up and waddled to the toilet and tried to clean up a little but then the contractions started coming really thick and fast.  We rushed off to hospital, had another epidural (this time I had a 'pain window' where you feel the pain in just one area - my left buttock!) and gave birth at around 6.25 am.    So, there you go - my two stories.  Both marvellous, wonderful experiences and I'd do it all over again tomorrow!!!  Hope you get a wonderful birth experience too.  Just don't let the pain frighten you - it is the most wonderful natural thing ever - your body is such a powerful thing.  I have such respect for my body and breasts after giving birth and breastfeeding.    Best wishes|`|IsnHXRo4aa	You'll know when you're "really" in labor. The contractions become stronger, more frequent, and more consistent in timing. With my first I didn't have much of the Braxton Hicks my water just broke unexpectedly (looking back I probably was having them but didn't know what they were), but with my second I had contractions for almost 3 months before he was born. When I noticed them more frequently I started timing them. If noticed that I forgot to time them I figured it was because they weren't consistent enough for me to notice. About 2 days after starting to time them I realized they were just a few minutes apart and I went in. Trust your body and your instincts.|`|OJ672jx1aa	This may sound stupid to some, but this is how i could tell if i was going into labor:     The last few weeks of my pregnancy I had braxton hicks like crazy! I was in and out of the hospital because i thought i was in labor. Then one day I decided to go for a walk with my husband. I figured the pain would get more severe if the labor was real. After the walk the braxton hicks became more frequent and the next day my water broke!    My suggestion. Go for a walk.... def take someone with you though... just in case!|`|Jswomud7aa	I had very consistent braxton hicks contractions for three days with both of my kids. Each contraction was a little uncomfortable, but not painful, and lasting about 15-30 seconds every 4-7 minutes for about 4-6 hours.     I didn't realize it but you can actually be in early labor for a number of days before active labor. It is your body's natural way to progress and prepare for the hard work ahead.    In the middle of the night my water broke and about 10 mins after that I got the REAL contractions. Actual labor contractions are like braxton hicks on major steroids! They hurt! ouch!    Both of my labor and deliveries were pretty much identical believe it or not. I was in early labor for about 3 days before my water broke. Both times my water broke around 1:30am and I had my first at 9:45am that same morning and my son was 8:45am!    Some things I did to help stimulate labor were:    - had a "birthing ball." It's basically a sports ball deflated to about 70% so it's really squishy. I would sit on it with my legs really wide apart because that position opens the pelvis allowing the baby's head to come further down which helps to dialate the cervix. I would sway side to side, back and forth and up and down.    - take a warm bath and relax. If you are in labor the hot water and relaxation will make the contractions more consistent. OR if you are not in labor the contractions should go away. I actually thought I was in labor with my first at about 11pm and took a bath. My dang contractions disapeared. I was so disappointed and went to sleep. At 1:30 the same night my water broke!     - walking A LOT. The movement will help bring your baby's head down and put preasure on your cervix.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	the three days before contractions i had really bad and i mean i could walk back pain! really bad heartburn that caused vomiting then it went away and along came the contractions.....i remember teh first one i had i knew it was labour and thought i wish i could catch a break lol|`|qi6mAsCZaa	I just knew that I was in labor. I was having contractions (had contractions starting at 6 months) but I was so used to them I wasn't sure if they were the real thing. I laid in my bathtub and when it didn't help, I laid on my bed. My water broke and the REAL contractions started in. I made it to the hospital a little after 3:30p that day and had my son at 5:47p. I was the talk of the labor and delivery...lol. I felt like my baby was coming already (LOTS of pressure) but didn't have the pain until my water broke. I walked to try and bring the labor on, but I was so tired I didn't get very far...I just knew and you will too.    Good luck and congratulations!|`|b4fYwZeraa	I went into labor the evening before the day I delivered. I felt like I had period cramps all night and knew I was definitely in labor when they didn't stop. By morning they were evenly spaced (3-4) minutes apart.
NxNrZksXaa	it is best to wait at least 5 days to a week after you miss your period to test, because the pregnancy hormone increases each day. also the best time to test is in the morning because that's when the hormone is the highest. there is a chance that it can show up negative now and positive later. that could be because your hormone isn't high enough to show up yet, so i would say to wait until at least saturday or sunday to test again.         good luck!|`|DNygQdmVaa	periods can be late for many reasons not just pregnancy.    If you were pregnant it should read by now...  wait a couplemore days and test again.|`|L6oSDA5Yaa	yes they may be showing up neg because you do not have enough HCG (hormone) in your system for it to show up on the test. i would wait like a week because if you are pregnant your hormone levels will double  possibly tripple in that time.! good luck!
s4LWmcTjaa	Teething can also be another cause for a runny nose, though the cold may also be a part of it.  A decrease in appetite can also come from teething and a cold.    For a runny nose that is clear, save yourself and money and the trip.  A doctor's visit isn't needed, especially since you say there are no other symptoms and she's teething.  At worst she has a bit of a cold and there's nothing the doctors can/will do for that other than say "keep Kleenex on hand and get a humidifier".    Keep tissues in stock, keep her hydrated, if her nose gets raw use some plain Vaseline and thinly coat under her nose, and make sure she gets plenty of rest.|`|9p9DDRSnaa	My daughter is 15 months as well, and sick.  Sounds like a cold virus to me...it is spreading like crazy around here. Sounds like you are all over it actually.  As long as she doesnt have a fever or yellow or green mucas, I think it is just a cold.  The only thing you can do to help her would be to suction it out.  If she gets stuffy, use little noses (a couple drops per nostril, wait a few secs then suction).  I would run the humidifier.  As long as she is getting fluids and rest she should be alright.  Pedialite is my go to when she is feeling yucky.  Keeps her hydrated.  Hang in there, I feel for ya!|`|bf94249d3b1b5cc39b8f8feedf79ad15aa	If you're unsure about anything always call your doctor. Your doctor can tell you over the phone if you need to bring her in or not. Even if you think it's not that serious, you should always check with your dr.
veO1RXrCaa	Honey your gall bladder can burst.  That would kill you and the baby.  Your O.B is nuts.  If its infected you can't wait.  They can remove it and the baby would be fine.  My nieces Mom had liver surgery when she was 5 months along.  The take the gall bladder out in way that would be no where near your uterus.  Find someone to take it out for both your sakes.  My Mom almost had her gall bladder burst.  I had mine out also.  I was in and out of the hospital in the same day.  They take out in the upper part of your abdomen and use cameras at the side of your abdomen to see inside.  Its really not that big of a deal.  Really!  Get it done.  You will be fine.  Think of your other child too.  They need you too.    ETA doctors need to tell you all the bad things.  I think they have to for legal reasons.  From what I have read on the links posted below.  Its better to be done in the first or second trimester.  I know its scary.  Hell I was scared too.  I can imagine its much worse being pregnant but you both will probably pull through like champs.  Good luck!  And you will feel so much better with it out.  Just avoid fatty foods cause they will give you the runs.  No one ever tells you that.  Nuts especially are hard on you afterwards.|`|VFUdAtrHaa	Can they do the surgery while your still pregnant? Can they maybe but you under light anesthia or maybe give you an epidural for the surgery that way your not completely knocked out? MyFriend had Gald stones when she was pregnant but found out right before she gave birth so both were ok. Im so sorry you have to go threw this. Maybe even if you can hold off 3 more weeks and devlier your baby at 25 weeks they will have a great chance of survival and you will live also. GOOD LUCK AND GOD BLESS
AA10186411	No.  Only fertility drugs and AZO can alter results.|`|buoqtZeFaa	I would say no.  I was talking them on and off (for no reason really) before I got pregnant and my test came out true
joPJtKemaa	The symptoms of ectopic pregnancy are shoulder pain and stabbing pain.    Stabbing pain might also be a sign of a normal pregnancy.    See a doctor and once they do the internal ultrasound (its way too early for the external) and if they do see a sac that means your pregnancy is in the right place. But see a specialist right away.  Do not delay because if it is ectopic you want to get treated right away, otherwise it will rupture your tube and cause severe bleeding.|`|0iUxfCMcaa	i had an eptopic that was discovered at 8wks they had to remove my right tube as well. i had on and off stabbing pains in my right lower abdomen. then i had some spotting and i never had spotting while i was pregnant with my last three. they did a regular ultrasound and saw that the baby was not in the uterus they thought at first the baby was in my overy. they did surgery with in hours after that because it was about to rupture and thats when they found out it was really in my right tube. if you are having really bad pains i would call the doctor and inform them about it.|`|RtIGiGrkaa	I just started bleeding and went straight to the ER, they did both kinds of ultra sounds, and ran tons of test on my hcg levels. I was admitted and rushed into emergency surgery the next morning. If one of your tubes ruptures you can bleed to death. It is very important you go straight to your dr. An ectopic is not something you want to mess around with. I didn't have the common symptoms such as back pain, belly, pain etc.|`|PnZigfgHaa	Cramping is common in early pregnancy but if you're at all worried then you should see your GP as a matter of urgency.  The ultrasound is usually external but other tests are also performed if necessary.    It's also common to be worried and anxious in pregnancy so try and take a rational view, despite the posts on here, ectopic preganancy is extremely rare.    Good luck x|`|4cehW3S9aa	I was paranoid about ectopic pregnancy from what I had read.  When I went the the doctor 2 wweks ago, I had a vaginal ultrasound and the babies were definitely where they belonged and there are two in there.    I had shoulder pain from time to time but that could be caused from straining a muscle.  I had cramping and that still comes and goes but it is my ligaments stretching.    While ectopic pregnancies are dangerous, I would relax a little bit.  If you are that worried, it wouldn't hurt to go to the ER just to verify the baby is where it belongs and then you can enjoy your pregnancy a little more.    Good luck!
G2auAv1Saa	Time for tough love!   If he is not willing to go to school he needs to be working. He is at an age where you can require him to pay rent.   Draw up a rental agreement he either pays so much per month or goes to school and makes certain grades for you to continue supporting him.   If he doesn't respond to that, ask him to move out.|`|TJ8fgBpWaa	I will relate to you MY experience; take it for what it's worth.    I'm the oldest of 3 kids, raised by a divorced mother who got very little sympathy or help from HER parents (who were not wealthy but were "extremely comfortable") while we were growing up.    My mother taught me to read at an early age, so I was usually way ahead of contemporaries, in terms of reading ability and comprehension, as well as having read many books years ahead of my grade in school. So I was lazy in terms of homework, often putting it off 'til the last minute and too often having to beg Mom to help me, especially for material like reports that had to be typed instead of handwritten (this was WAY before computers).    The middle child, my brother, got into trouble at any early age. Back then, diagnosis, much less treatment, of dyslexia and ADD were non-existent, or primitive at best. He spent most his time combing his hair with Brylcreem into a D.A. (duck's a*s) and imitating James Dean and Elvis in terms of dress, mannerisms and essentially anti-intellectual, anti-social behavior, no doubt to avoid his terrible school grades and 'lectures' that he got from from my mother, along the lines of "Why can't you do well in school, LIKE YOUR BROTHER AND BABY SISTER"? (That 'comparison' thing was NOT a good thing for her to have done, IMHO; each child is an individual and must be respected as such)     We know now that his self-esteem was in the dumps and that he wasn't dumb, just challenged and not getting the right kind of help. He became a juvenile delinquent, cutting school, stealing anything he saw that he wanted, got into alcohol, later into drugs. Private schools, tutors, counseling didn't help a bit. If he asked my mother for something, no matter what it was, and she couldn't afford it (understandably, to everyone but him) or thought it too off-the-wall, she'd say no. From then on, he would bug her and bug her and bug her until she caved in.    By the time I was half way through high school, I was a real smartass but still a fairly good student and had socially favored, 'acceptable' friends. My mother was very well-educated, but I was always trying to show her how much I knew...she finally said one day "Well, if you're so f-ing smart, move out NOW, while you still 'know it ALL' and support ME for the next 16 years."    That really hit home, so I knuckled down, got better grades and went to a VERY good Jesuit college in the East. My brother was a year behind me in school. he went to a community college and was arrested several times for speeding in a friend's car, buying alcohol while underage, setting fire to the school's chemistry lab and was always caught. A judge told him: either join the Army or go to jail. That was 1965. He joined the Army, learned how to operate a backpack-type radio and was sent to Vietnam in 1966, where he 'humped the boonies' with an Infantry company. In Vietnam, he got 4 extra months added on to his 12-month tour because he was court-martialed for being drunk in a nearby village when his base was attacked. And some men died.    I went into the Army in '67, was sent to school for 6 months to learn about aviation electronics and was stationed on an airbase in Vietnam. Not totally out of danger, but not slogging through rice paddies and jungles, because one of my reading interests was in mechanics, as well as science and things like that.    He became a waiter when he got out of the Army, changing jobs a lot because he would steal food and money wherever he worked, and became known as a liar, a thief, a drunk, a drug user and totally untrustworthy. In the meantime, I opened a food store and had a great life.     20 years after his return from Vietnam, almost to the day, he was diagnosed with Agent Orange disease and died a painful death, 6 months before his 40th birthday, almost 25 years ago. 2 people went to his funeral: me and my mother: he didn't have any friends by then and neither of his ex-wives could have been bothered.    Let your kid chew on THAT for a while. It's Gospel-true. As much of a jerk my as brother was, I miss him (although I stopped trusting him with my house, my car, my girlfriend, etc., much less my money years before), but with the sadness and betrayal and bitterness that he caused in his short life, he's better off where he is... and so is the world. Sad but true. My mother died a few years later; my sister and I believe that it was a combination of fatigue from fighting with him, always bailing him out of jail, paying his debts, giving him money AND from a broken heart. I hope that that is not your son's destiny, but that's up to him, not you. Just don't be an enabler: it won't help either of you.  .|`|AA11065140	Honestly?  You kick him out.    It sounds harsh, but this accomplishes a couple of things.  Hopefully, it will make him recognize that life is not a playground.  Additionally, it ensures that you are living up to your own ethical standards.  When you enable someone, it allows them to continue their inappropriate behavior, and drags you down in the process.    In the long run, he may never change.  But at least you'll know that you did what was right based on your own ethical code.|`|lGKq9NXbaa	Kick him out. Let him try to support himself and see what it's like when everything is not given to him in life. How can you expect him to want to work and move forward when he has everything given to him. No bills, no responsibilities. Show him what he real world's like.

And yes, additional water on the test could mess it up. What you did was dilute the HCG. So you need to try again tomorrow morning.    After the positive test, I got really tired and very sore breasts. But before the test, I had NO symptoms.|`|oXCo6VX4aa	First symptom was sore breasts and feeling a little tired.  Not too unusual before a period but I did feel like it went on for longer.  The thing that made me go out and get a pregnancy test was the night that I got about 20 mosquito bites and my husband (who is usually a mosquito magnet) didn't get one.  I figured something must have changed about my body chemistry to make that happen.  Many people don't get symptoms before they miss their period because the egg is traveling, being fertilized and implanting itself during the time leading up to the missed period.  The most common one I've heard from pregnant friends is sore breasts.  I didn't get a positive until about 5 days after the missed period.  It was a really really really faint line at first.  I don't think that a drop of water could have messed up the test, the urine had probably already soaked into the strip.  Next time you may want to pee in a cup so you can do several tests with the same urine.  Good Luck!|`|phAqOpzZaa	My body felt diffrent! once i had sex after like in 2weeks i had mild cramps,breast sore,sleeping,and peeing...then my period came except it was really light pinkish...now im 8weeks!|`|FsmcCXlvaa	My fist symptom was that I missed my period.

With baby number three I felt really bloated and had a hard time getting my pants to fit. When my period was late I knew I was pregnant again. If you haven't actually missed your period just wait until you do and re-test. You may have messed up the other one but you should wait a while before testing again.|`|mhTr0m1aaa	No period that was my only signs I didn't get sick...and then I went for a exam and she told me I was...|`|vgD95DLCaa	missed period, and pos pregnancy test...

XChiSgDZaa	As me being the mother of a child whos father I am no longer with. And he has a new girl in his life I can personally say maybe she is nervous too as she doesnt want it to look confrontational also.  My ex and my current b/f get along great we have spent holidays and vacations together many of times. My ex has recently stated with a new girl and I also would like to meet her and have a healthy relationship as she will be a big part of my daughters life, but as the same as you I dont want it to look as if i want to be confrontational, or that i am jelouse.  My advice just talk to her and introduce your self, ask her if every now and then if you can call and maybe take the girls to lunch or to vist for the day.|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	If she's OK with things as they are, I wouldn't rock the boat - for the kids' sakes.      I never met my stepdaughter's mom.  She knows I exist & has mentioned me once or twice as a concept ("You have a new family now, why don't you just leave us alone"), but we've never spoken to each other.  That hasn't really affected my relationship with my husband or stepdaughter, although I guess I don't know how it could have been different if I had ever spoken to her.  It's nice that you want to be able to just call & talk to them, or pick them up to go somewhere, but, in my situation, anyway, I'd let dad act as a go-between on those kind of things.|`|AkFag8tNaa	As a mother/stepmother, mother of a child w/a stepmother etc...., I could never stand to not meet the woman that would be my child's stepmother. It has nothing to do with drama or sizing her up, it's simply natural to want to know the person that my child will be around when he's at his father's. She may feel uncomfortable with the idea for several reasons but I think it would be a great idea to introduce yourself. Keep it casual and friendly and I don't see how there could be a problem. Refrain from talking about the kids in a motherly way with her (they are her kids and she probably feels that you might be a threat) and hopefully you can have a good relationship!|`|fdnbXfvfaa	Just do it in a really calm manor.  I met my ex's wife, when I was dropping my daughter off a dads house.  She answered the door, and at first I was a bit like, who the heck is this women, but she was really friendly, and introduced herself, and now we get on really well|`|prqrQcd1aa	I think that this is very stange indeed. Why would she not get out and meet you if she was dropping her kids off at your house, i personally would want to meet the woman that was taking care of my children, be it that i know that she is a good person or not!  I suggest that the next time that she calls you just pick up the phone and talk to her, tell her that you would like the two of you to meet. Tell her that you just wish to meet the mother of the wonderful children that are a part of your life now. If she does not want to for what ever reason then do not push the issue. If she asks why it is necessary, tell her that you would like to be a part of the parenting relationship as well, and would like to do the things you mentioned above!   Doing things this way will not be throwing yourself in her face, nor will it be seen as confrontational. Maybe she is just shy and has not wanted to meet you because she is still sore about the break up between her and the children's father. If it's been this long though, then i would assume that the hurt would not be so bad now, and she would want to meet you. Maybe there is something there that you do not know about, like he was cheating on her with you at some point in time or something, i dont' know but there has to be a reason there somewhere as to why she wouldn't want to meet you!|`|r5AbT6tmaa	That's great that you are taking the first step. I'm not sure why she hasn't done it herself. From my own personal experience, my ex and I have two kids and when he started dating a woman after 6 months of our divorce I decided to meet her as I wanted to see first hand who was helping my ex care for my children when they were with him. I also got to see her interact with her own two daughters and it helped a lot to make me feel relieved. I can see how 3 years of no contact can be more awkward than someone that just walked into the situation. Definitely try to make a move. How would you feel about inviting her and spouse or companion over for dinner one day? I think that would be graceful. Good luck.
nDSLNnguaa	It just depends. Usually around 34-36 weeks but some go back and forth until the due date.  My 2nd child never did turn and my dr said it wouldn't do much good to turn her because she could turn back (plus it is full of risks)    She was born breech at 37 weeks!|`|7C9Ett7Caa	Normally they go into "head-down" position within like 6-10 weeks before labor begins. But, some babies just dont like to be up-side-down, lol. Good luck!!|`|ly59dQ3gaa	I'm 38 weeks w/ a footling breech.  The doc doesn't give us much hope for him turning on his own b/c of his size.  I have  a csection scheduled for next week.  We opted not to have ECV b/c there are risks associated with it.  Fewer risks associated w/ a csection.  Good luck!|`|kcGFK36Waa	I would say around 36 weeks.|`|VT24zOomaa	i'm 35 weeks today, and my baby just now turned to the head down position, hopefully she'll stay that way.
9GuqdXa2aa	yes, she could be pregnant if in the three days she skipped her pills she ovulated. If she did ovulate, taking 3pills after the fact won't prevent pregnancy. The pills will only keep her from ovulating. Hard lesson- don't count on the other person for your birth control. Especially now that you know she's not responsible. WEAR A CONDOM|`|7C9Ett7Caa	Whenever you *** in a women, theres always a chance. Wait a maybe 2 weeks and have her take an at home pregnancy test. Good Luck!!|`|9MjaiYj4aa	She could be pregnant even if she took the pill before they don't always work and if she took the pill after than she could be|`|S9jyc95jaa	If you didn't use protection it's a possibility... 3 days is too long to go without taking the pill.  If you miss one day, you can make up for it, but 3 days is way too many.    EDIT: Plus there's always that chance of getting pregnant on the pill... one of my friends got pregnant with twins on birth control. :/|`|frpCK0utaa	theres always that chance, especialy if she misses pills.|`|kwYxQp0Maa	There is always a chance even when the pill is taken correctly,  each day off it will increase the chance.  I got my girlfriend pregnant the day after she stopped taking the pill, we thought it would be safe...it wasn't.|`|AA11783622	Yup.    God, don't they teach you guys anything in middle school and hs???      Sure, hon.    Even when she takes them exactly as directed, she runs a 4-6% chance.  If she misses three days, she ovulated.  Bet on a pregnancy... the ova was already released.  Three pills all after ovulation do nothing.    Now she has the same three choices any of us have in an unwanted pregnancy.... carry to term and keep, carry to term and adopt out, go for a chemical abortion at Planned Parenthood.... Google them + your city for an appointment.|`|vgD95DLCaa	Yes she could get pregnant.|`|mb9pL423aa	Yes, for birth control to be effective, it needs to be taken without forgetting or else it becomes useless. Instead of taking her forgotten pills, a Plan B pill would be better.|`|PklUNqOWaa	Yes she could get pregnant. She has to take the pill around the same time EVERY day or it is defective. Plus if she went home and took three pills that is not good for her body to take them all at once. If she doesn't want to get pregnant she needs to be more responsible.
e4xovpfUaa	No and I would not be worried.|`|2cf6501c9a3f33cf51f80b825ae1fa82aa	It's a slim chance you are pregnant, but stranger things have happened.    What's the downside of taking a pregnancy test, aside from cost (you can get free ones at a clinic/planned parenthood)??? Why would your boyfriend NOT want you to take one?    I say better to be safe than sorry.|`|gEWt6eoCaa	No!|`|joPJtKemaa	For a peace of mind just take it.
fk9AvB25aa	A woman usually ovulates between day 10 and day 16 of her cycles which is roughly about a week or two before her period. Ovulation can happen a couple of days before or after her period but this is not too common. So don't have sex a week or two before your period or keep track of your cycles to get a better idea of when you ovulate. It's when you ovulate that you can get pregnant not necessarily when you have a period.|`|QSodlfMraa	there is never a good time, there is always a chance, but if your infertile anytime is good.|`|AA10186411	While you are pregnant, or never.  Your choice.

Wow....how do you think she will react when you end up pregnant?  And yes, I got pregnant as a teen myself.    Don't have sex or use TWO methods of contraception.|`|wKuTfLVyaa	While you're pregnant...
tfTQ6Cuuaa	I'm pretty sure they mean sex in which a man ejaculates inside you. If you took the pill, then had protected sex, it shouldn't affect it. There are probably only enough hormones to stop 1 egg from fertilizing I guess.   \  And one would assume that if you are taking that pill after unprotected sex that you are not intending to get pregnant, and would not have unprotected sex again. It is meant as emergency contraception, not birth control.|`|2ZOkyoSJaa	No, it just means that it's not safe to go on having unprotected sex after taking the pill. You are supposed to get on regular birth control after you take the emergency BC.|`|pOrwteQUaa	If you so much as think about pressing that thumbs down button just remember that i know where you sleep.............in a bed XD      ........|...  ........|..........2 Points..........|||"|""\__  ........|__________________|||_|___|)  ........!(@)'(@)""""**!(@)(@)****!(@)|`|FjFAEvzcaa	if anything states 'unprotected sex' it means everything that is included in sex, i.e. ejaculation.|`|efQGWAoMaa	Just the motions of sex but...    You'd be really pushing your luck if you have unprotected sex after just taking an emergency contraceptive as it is not 100% effective and by having a man ejaculate some more into you is obviously lowering your chances of success if marginally.    However having sex PROTECTED sex would in no way stop it from working otherwise.     Levonelle is a very powerful emergency contraceptive which I have had experience of from when I was a teen, take it easy if you;ve taken it because it is known to make girls sick and start off an unscheduled and very heavy period. xxx|`|4DoXomHZaa	Wow. Sperm is what gets you pregnant, not the motion of his part in yours. You knew that, right?    Emergency BC doesn't always work. If it doesn't stop you from ovulating, and you go and have even more unsafe sex, there are more sperm in there trying to get you pregnant. Common sense.    There's lots of great websites that explain human reproduction and all the bc options now...more than ever before....information age....no excuse for unwanted pregnancies anymore, ladies. It's 2009.
VJpdmd0waa	You can if you really really need to   but they say putting some many foreign objects in your body when your pregnant isn't the best.  So only if you really need them out will they take them out while your pregnant.  I actually just asked my dentist this 2 weeks ago..  Good Luck!|`|jn34aSgHaa	absolutly not because of the anes. wait till you give bith. i know that really sucks. good luck|`|f9sL3WgQaa	No. They will make you wait.

vsuXCMqzaa	Wow! He sleeps through the night, that's GREAT!    Around 6-8 weeks my daughter went through the same phase only she didn't sleep through the night. Not wanting to be laid down, wanting mommy snuggles all day long etc. I spent most of my days holding her or carrying her in a baby carrier. Like most phases, it went away and in hind-sight didn't last long although at the time it felt like eternity. But I read that the extra security and attention and holding them that you provide for them now will make them a more independent, secure person later on. And it helped me to hear that it's not possible to "spoil" them at that age either.    It's ok if your house doesn't get cleaned perfectly right now, just try to soak up this baby time as much as you can. It won't be long and he'll be in the phase where he won't want to be held and cuddled and after that he won't even want a mommy kiss!    So for now, to help you endure, just do 1 task per day to keep your sanity. It may take you all day long just to get the bathroom cleaned or all day long to do the dishes but you'll feel like you accomplished something. Also, do try to get a baby carrier as that helped me alot. And if you can manage to get a couple of hours break here and there either from a friend, family member or significant other that always helps too.|`|tapFZBowaa	He is probably about to go through some sort of milestone or is becoming more aware of his surroundings.  For one week before my son rolled over, he would only sleep on me for about 30 minutes at a clip.  Then, he "tank rolled" 5 times and slept through the night for 3 nights in a row.  He still gets up a few times a night, but before they reach a milestone they tend to get a little restless.  I think for my son, he just wanted to get up and practice rolling, he just couldn't get it off his brain!|`|Ezkn5azdaa	I know how that is.. My baby girl was born on December 1 has well. And I can't get any cleaning or anything done has well. She has nothing to do with her crib which I am trying for her to get used to. I try to work fast once I got her sleep some where.|`|hDnX6Vx6aa	Try a baby swaddling blanket. They work miracles. Below is a website that sells them.    http://www.lovingbabyinc.com/|`|DLDweOcYaa	My daughter did the same thing from when she was 2 months old.  She only slept when I held her in my arms and somedays she wouldn't sleep at all.  Although from this time she started sleeping all night.  She didn't start sleeping during the day until she was about 5 months old.  Now she has 2 naps a day ranging from 1 to 2 hours.  You'll just have to stick it out.  Good luck.|`|DmUG33axaa	he is probably just getting spoiled from you holding him all the time, just lay him down and try to deal with the crying, you can't hold him 24-7 obviously. and everytime he cries and you pick him up he is just learning that that is what he has to do to get held. it's hard to listen to them cry sometimes, but if he is clean and fed he just has to "get over it". i hope that doesn't sound bad, but that should be the only reason|`|za9uDaPxaa	Hi,    I know I am going to cause some contraversy here, but here goes:    My baby would not sleep on her own from the very moment she was born. In the hospital, I had to stay for 3 nights after a caeserean, and she would not go anywhere near those see through cots they put babies in, even though she was right next to me. I thought that is what babies did, they slept next to you for a while in a cot and then went into their own rooms. However, when the midwife finally also got so fed up with the crying, she put her in the bed next to me.     When I got home it was exactly the same, so I just gave up and she slept by me and my husband. She slept right through the night from around 9pm- 8am every night for a year and then went into her own bed really happily as she knew (well I think so) that she had nothing to worry about, she had no fear of me not being there.     Humans are the only species who don't sleep with their young, and in third world countries almost everyone sleeps with their children next to them, (obviously not out of choice most of the time). I think we are just conditioned to think it is wrong.     Why don't you try getting him to sleep with you on the sofa at night (be really careful of course) and then just take him up to bed with you when you are ready to go. Yes, you will have to sacrifice your relationship for a while, but your relationship with your child will be amazing.     Hope that helps, sorry if you think I am preaching, and good luck!|`|bfc094c9eeff42837771bc3781e40936aa	Try a baby carrier that way you can get your house work done and not have to put hime down.  He just wants to be close to you, perfectly normal for little human being new to the world, without a clue.|`|Q3Hp2Al6aa	crying baby article http://www.associatedcontent.com/article...|`|Fd4lITkvaa	It's a phase. I held my son in a sling for every nap from 3wks-3months. Nothing got done until my husband got home to take over baby care. It feels like forever but I miss the snuggling now. He just grew out of it and I was able to put him down again. You can try swaddling to see if that helps but know that it does pass on it's own.
Inc78M0Raa	Just stop and think for a minute.  What would happen if you got pregnant?  A 14 year old can't support a baby.  And you don't really want to dump it all on your parents do you?  I'm not going to say 'No! Your wayyy to young! Keep your legs closed!'  But if you do decide you have sex, get on birth control at least a month, if not 2 before you do. And use a condom.|`|3Y2jRkxcaa	You can do whatever the he// you want as long as you are on birth control. Just don't get yourself pregnant.

I know you might think your ready because your "blinded" by love but how do you know your ready if you never had sex before? So you really don't know what your READY for. And just because you been with your boyfriend for two years it doesnt mean he doesnt have a long term goal (you can figure out what that means im sure your pretty smart)
LmgDTXTlaa	I agree, a child should make up their own mind about what additional cosmetics are done to them. you wouldn't book your baby in for a nose job or a nip ad tuck and to me they are the same as piercings, optional adjustments to the way you look which should be decided by and ONLY by the person whos 'look' it is.My mum said I had to wait until 14 before she would allow me to get my ears pierced and well....i did get them done at 15 but it was my choice. I hate to see babies wit pierced ears.|`|cuh4ERU9aa	Well to be honest with you I do. I mean it would be better to get them done at a younger age so they don't even remember the pain. I had mine done at 1 (my mom told me) and when I started wearing a lot of jewelry I was thankful that I already had them pierced so I wouldn't have to go through the pain.|`|28HLij60aa	When I was very very small, (we're going back a good 26 years now) getting your daughter's ears pierced was pretty much widely done and me along with most of my female friends, had our ears pierced by the time we were three.     I didn't ask my mum to do she just took me along. Thats not to say I'm angry at her for it, and I don't think she took me and hurt me for the sake of it.   Thats a bit like saying that I took my son for his needle last week because of a selfish desire for him to not get Meningitis....because innoculation needles are just like ear piercing-they're the parents free choice to make.     From a personal view, I wouldn't take my daughter to get her ears pierced until she was old enough to decide for herself what she wanted and asked to have it done. I'd not hold it against anyone who takes their child to have their ears pierced because it's not for me to say how to parent, nor to judge.   One has to look at it in the way that, if it was THAT brutal, THAT nasty and THAT vicious, it wouldn't be allowed, would it?    moira....my mum was 23 when she took me to get my ears pierced, I was 2. We're NOT chavs...never have been, never will be.   I was fine with it then, I am now. But who are you to judge others? As long as the child is happy and healthy, should it matter too much? What business is it of anyone else's? I would wait til my daughter asked for it to be done but I don't think it's right to verbally bash mums who make that choice for their daughter in anticipation. Besides, if the kid decides they don't want earrings when they grow, they can take them out. Simple.|`|rDnLG0haaa	Well I dont think I'd ever do it.    but then again It would probley be better because  your baby wont remember it. And also you wont   have to go through the pain when you do want them.    I say im partial to the subject.|`|I6w6Nrphaa	MY DAUGHTERS HAVE THEIR EARS DONE.  I MAY EVEN THINK ABOUT GETTING THEIR NOSE PIERCED TOO, AND THEIR BELLY BUTTONS DONE.  I'VE ALREADY GOTTEN THEM THEIR FIRST TATTOO TOO.|`|EtCRnDJMaa	Yes I do.  I had my daughters ears pierced when they were 5, 3, & 1    If I had a boy I would have had him circumcised at birth too.      I also get my children their vaccinations & a flu shot every year.        If it wasn't okay to get the ears pierced, then why can we??  They don't even remember getting them done to begin with.      I also breastfed all 3 girls for over 20 months each & I am NOT a teenage mother...I'm 39.  I am an Atheist though, so this could be the reason for my sin.    In this day & age what girl DOESN'T want them pierced, especially by the time she gets into the 4th grade.|`|M6c0hUefaa	"Sigh".... what a typical debate.

At least you could argue circumcision would be to prevent possible future problems.  Not so with ear piercing - it is purely for chavs to have babies ears pierced|`|MHOxPs8Oaa	It isn't your baby or any of your business. If you don't like that then don't do it to your children so what if they get their ears pierced yes a needle is going into their ear omg it isn't the end of the world. Not to mention do you get your child vaccinated because that's so wrong they are getting a needle pushed into them and are getting immune to a disease they might not want to be immune to. Get over it they aren't your kids.|`|PFO1jxZGaa	do you think its ok to cut off a piece of your sons penis for really no other reason than beauty?|`|hDnX6Vx6aa	yes. Its fine.|`|kwMA5I1iaa	I don't see a problem if someone else wants to go and do it. Personally, I wouldn't. I want to wait until they are able to ask for it to be done. I remember getting mine done and it was an exciting event.|`|UUpsa35Daa	What if they're not just thinking about beauty? What if they're thinking about the fact that their daughters might actually want their ears pierced when they're a little older and it's better to go through pain when they won't remember it in the slightest?    My mom had my ears pierced when i was 2, anticipating that i would want my ears pierced. And i did, i told her that i wanted "pretties" in my ears when i hit 4 years old but i didn't want the pain, that's when she explained to me that my ears were already pieced. I was happier than anything because i had gotten what i wanted without the pain.    Maybe some parents are so vain to do it to show off beauty in their babies but for some, that's not the sole purpose.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	lol    what a way to put it.   golly my mom must be the devil for piercing my ears.  oh the horrors.  i'm still scared to this day, 25 + years later.....|`|rgovWVP4aa	the trouble is that the parent thinks it is the freedom of choice to do thihs , but you know what , it stops that chld from growing up to make that choice themselves , ah wel  they can always take the ring out , yes but it is wrong as they have no choice weather to have ears pierced or not ,|`|EPaYoJaiaa	no, which is why if I ever have a daughter she will not get her ears pierced until she is old enough to take care of them herself. I also don't agree with circumcision so I completely 100% agree with you    EDIT: I'll never understand the whole 'sparing your child the pain' excuse. First of all pain comes with life, you can't avoid it you should teach your child how to deal with it not avoid it. Second, piercing ears isn't all that painful anyway. I have VERY low pain tolerance and yes I made a HUGE deal about the pain of getting my ears pierced and when the time came I flinched...but forgot all about the pain when i saw the studs I had picked out in my ears. It's not traumatizing, if I could deal with so can everyone else.|`|JI7NQ9TNaa	Ah...that one.    I decided to wait until my daughter asked.  She was 12...and thought she was "rebelling".  I got her a lovely pair of gold butterflies to celebrate.|`|AA11349925	No I don't but I can't stop them and they won't stop doing it no matter what any of us say.    And it's more like punch a hole through flesh with great force.|`|jvW3a5GYaa	I waited until my girls asked if they could have their ears pierced - I didn't want to put a hole in their head that they might not have wanted there. Plus it was a big deal to take them to get their ears pierced.|`|3WWHWsHOaa	It is their choice as a parent. I would not do it to my own children but it is not my place to tell parent another not to. It is the exact same concept as circumcision. It is up to each parent to make the choice. Same as bottle versus breast and every other aspect of parenting. It isn't right or wrong.|`|8bf22a7b300866a77ba08f820aaefdcaaa	The kids completely forget about it. It's not mentally damaging or anything close to the sort. Little girls (and some little boys) look very pretty/handsome with earrings. If they grow up and hate the earrings then they can take it out and the holes will close up.     A horrible situation would be if a parent did this to their child and then refused to clean the holes and they got infected, but I'm pretty sure most parents take good care of their kiddies.|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	My sister married a Hindu man and their baby had her ears pierced because of some religious reason.  I don't really understand it, but in other cultures it's completely common. THey wonder why we don't.|`|prqrQcd1aa	The choice is up to the parent. I understand where you are comming from and i think the same way, but.. it is different in many cultures and parents have the right to make that choice!|`|NS5fnxpNaa	No I think the child should ask to have there ears pierced, I know some ladies who don't want them done so why should you take that choice away from your child.|`|IVtExrOYaa	OMFG!!!! i have been debating this with my mother in law since i had my baby girl! she claims that "the sooner u pierce her ears after shes born the less it will hurt" my baby is 4 months old now n i have no intention of piercing her anytime soon, me n her dad have agreed that we r waiting until she can speak for herself n decides shes ready. believe me i have my tounge, upper lip, lower lip, belly button n 9 in both my ears, i know it hurts.|`|BhlGe0A8aa	The amount of children I have seen in my local town with pierced ears is shocking.  You should never do this to a wee thing.Apart from anything else it looks common.  But I suppose to the Sharon and Tracey's of this world it is some type of status symbol.  I did not allow my daughter to get her ears pierced until she was 21.  What on earth is going on today with these teenage mothers?|`|fdnbXfvfaa	I hate that on babies! Its so tacky|`|efbb15bd3b273c3e6801e5fe2b1add09aa	good for you. i disagree. 'nough said.|`|yYOh0DUjaa	Yes, I do. I have seen babies get their ears pierced and then they get distracted with something else and everything is fine. And every girl will eventually want their ears pierced and it is easier done when they are babies.|`|X2eVfKc6aa	I love it when little girls have their ears pierced!   Its better for them to have it done when they are younger they forget about it 2 min later anyway!  I have a friend who did not have it done when she was younger and could never pluck up the courage to have it done, i bet she wishes she had it done when she was younger!|`|iMaTMWMxaa	My mum hates the idea of ear piercing, and would therefore never let me get it done. I realised I actually wanted it done about 6 months ago, and it took me ages to go get it done. I've had them done for 5 weeks now, and I'm 28 with 3 kids of my own!!!!    I will let my daughter get them done when she asks. I asked her if she wanted them done and she said "yes, but not yet, maybe when I'm 10??"|`|4YIUxSlYaa	Nope, I don't agree with it.  The child should make the choice if they want their ears pierced, some people don't!    I also don't agree with circumcision - body mutilation is NOT right.
NaJPIOheaa	vitex is known to help about 90% of women, and you must be the 10% that it dosent help. people rave about it because it works! i've taken it and its helped me loads, i've also had friends and family take it and regulate cycles and even become pregnant. i get what your saying though, when it comes down to ttc people will try anything! :) theres other herbs such as dong quai maybe you could look into? i believe in geritol complete, don't know about the fish oils though. tons of baby dust & good luck! xo|`|z6BtwSE8aa	I have no idea. It didn't work for me either. I decided to try it because I have PCOS and at the time I didn't have insurance, so I was looking for something I could try until I was able to go to the doctor. I read a lot of good things about it so I tried it but it did absolutely nothing. It actually made my hair start to fall out. As soon as I stopped taking it that stopped. I guess everyone is different and it works for some.

pXdZIsgHaa	that brings back a lot of memories for me i had a friend exactly like the second one you mentioned. she had a boyfriend and she always bitched about him to me, they used to brake up every other week and she used to come running to me and only ever wanted me when she wanted something. so i ditched her i told her to leave me alone because she wasnt a good friend.   friends ruined my life they always ***** about you behind your back even if they say you are there best friend, friends gave me a diadnosed mental illness. trust me when i say you are better of without them   you will never find a true friend ever|`|KwJDWvB3aa	the second one is not a good friend at all let alone a best friend..theres nothing you can do about it.|`|rgovWVP4aa	i think you shsould get a boyfreind and start to try and make new freindsa as this is sad for you ,i dont really know what is onn her mind but you know i feel sad for you and tryinmg to sort out things with your mu to have a good disco night or club with your mate , but then whe  you havew a felo see how she feels when you say sorry im out wyth oosits|`|EMKuBql8aa	Because they aren't really your friends, get some new friends and don't call them your "best friend" until you have known eachother and are friends for a few years.

4nleceOEaa	believe it or not.  you might end up gaining some pounds since its such little food.  do what i do...eat all the time but in small proportions.  im actually really thin but still with great curves :]  i also exercise  it doesn't have to be an OD routine  you can take as little as 10-15 minutes a day simply running in place  all your fat will eventually turn to muscle and you'll get nice and toned if you exercise regularly  try dancing or something ;P    ooh and just in case you're wondering..here's a reg. day for me  6:45-bagel with cream cheese and a cup of OJ  8:00-an energy bar and bottle of water  11:35 ish-school lunch [yuck] or a big salad from the teacher's cafee  2:30-a cold turkey sub [no butter,mayo,etc]  5:00-rice beans and chicken  7:00-fruit    p.s-if you chew gum a lot it distracts your tummy and fools your brain since your constantly chewing  :]  good luck!|`|KwJDWvB3aa	wake up in the morning and take a half hour walk to get your metabolism going then eat a banana and oat meal. and for lunch have a sandwich and for dinner have some brown rice and beans. and drink plenty of water.    and make sure you take the walk first thing in the morning before your hungry for anything and if you are hungry eat a banana then go for a walk..if you walk later in the day it wont work.|`|ozATw7s0aa	don't eat that little! that's actually bad- your body will start to cling on to your fat that you have stocked up (not saying your fat, even the skinniest people have it). just watch your portions and go for a jog every night. start making salads and try the point thing with weight watchers.    good luck, i'm starting dieting too! :)|`|K51u0OUUaa	Well, I really think you should take some time to exercise. I have researched this subject and have learned that if you dont exercise, you wont lose weight and youll be unhealthy forever. So please excercise whenever you can!|`|5ba049abc44fd99ab0e13d585c2beddaaa	ok well if youre not over weight i dont think its healthy to diet  what are you doing that takes up ur time when you could be exercising?  because maybe you could give up your wii fit time and get some real exercise... i doubt its doing anything  also, in stead of not eating a lot, maybe you can just eat a normal serving of specific foods that are good for you|`|jwsba3qAaa	Eating that little will not help you lose weight while still being healthy.  You need to put calories into your body in order for it to burn calories.  Try eating cereal for breakfast with a glass of milk.  Salads or sandwiches for lunch.  And finish it all up with a lean cuisine.  Eat fruits and vegetables for snacks.  You actually burn more calories eating celery than celery contains plus its fun to munch on!  And try and exercise more, even if you just go for a walk you're still burning calories.|`|bVsRXAapaa	goodness, it amazes me how losing weight is complete common sense, yet so many ppl swear they dont know how. soooo to reiterate what you've heard many times before, to lose weight, u must diet and exercise!! lol. its as simple as that. i just lost 30 pounds and am back down to what i should be. first of all, ur eating the wrong stuff. 2nd of all, if u claim u only needa lose 10 pounds, u prob need to lose more like 20. 10 pounds will barely make a dent in ur body.     do not waste ur money on stupid stuff like slim fasts, tv dinners, rice cakes, and salads. wrong wrong wrong. we all know what we SHOULD be eating and what we prob SHOULDN'T be eating, right?? start eating NORMAL foods like grilled chicken and vegies, steak, fish, etc. lose the butter and cheese in ur meals. stay away from pretty much most man-made foods, including "diet" drinks. they're LOADED with sodium which will only make ur body retain water. load up on as many fruits and vegies during the day as possible. FYI, fiberous foods fill u up. i eat a fiber one bar for breakfast every morning or their cereal with skim milk. u also need to drink lots of water. when ur dieting, fat turns to liquid, and there's only 2 ways for it to come out if u know what i mean!! cuz out all junk food like desserts, snacks, alcoholic drinks, fattening condiments, salad dressings, etc.    chances are, you probably know you shouldn't be consuming certain things, you just need to do it.|`|vNi14C7uaa	Im not really on a diet, but during the past 2or 3 weeks I have lost 5 pounds at the most. No it wasnt hard to loose them and i dont exercise either. Nor do I eat all that healthy stuff, but I dont even really eat small portions. But If you want to loose atleast 10 pounds, if u have a Wii and Wii Fit like I do, just use that. Thats what I have been doing and I havent even had my Wii for a month yet. But it has helped me loose a few pounds. Im only 102lbs now. I probably shouldnt be loosin anymore weight but I am trying to get down 2 about 95 or 97. You could eat regular food, just not as much. Maybe do a little bit of exercising everyday and there is a possibility you wil loose those 10 lbs, Good luck and I hope I helped!|`|b44WwAMsaa	try starving youself!
DLDweOcYaa	No I wouldn't want my son circumsized.  My husband does but I don't think it's necessary.

ZRNlwu5laa	Soft bristle baby brush and Baby oil. Rub baby oil on the head and in brush the head in circles (softly) with the round brush. If it starts to flake you can wipe with a luke warm wash cloth.|`|vsuXCMqzaa	They make "cradle cap" brushes that help. I put lotion on my babies head and worked the brush until the dry skin was gone. Also a tiny bit of vinegar in the bath water can help too.    But mostly the cradle cap brush, not too many baths and lotion worked the best for us.|`|8kaDm2D8aa	r u talking bout cradle cap, don't wash your his hair that often, it doesn't get dirty it just dries it out.  DO NOT use baby oil, that clogs pores, get a tea tree oil or hair lotion.|`|gP2lgeFHaa	After his bath with shampoo and rubbing with a washcloth, I use baby lotion and rub in on his head... he doesn't have much hair yet so it works.|`|EHY3FnAmaa	we used baby oil|`|wKJrZhj3aa	does your baby have a lot of hair??  mine does, and all of the "oil" suggestions are terrible!!!  lol.   I had used a 'craddle cap" specific product from the store and it just got all stuck in her hair and she looked greasy for days. LOL. What worked best was washing her hair normally and then I'd use a super soft baby toothbrush to rub her scalp while the shampoo was still in. I'd rinse and then repeat the rubbing with the toothbrush again, on any areas that seemed to need more attention. dont do it too hard and not for too long. It may not go away right away, but it helped.
2OYyljWEaa	No, not at all.|`|11d28a719b061143141cbe5fe883288caa	no it would be fine|`|HFA05vDuaa	i don't think so|`|i2yM0T9Paa	I don't think that it would be weird at all.

fdnbXfvfaa	I wouldnt want to find it|`|OzgLRw9Daa	same thing as having a diary,it's documenting things that's only for the person who owns it.So how would you feel if your parent's new things about you when you were young without permission??That's pretty much called invasion of things that are personnel ,The only way I would do something like this is if I suspected something very wrong with my child.But if  you have reason to think somethings going on then you really need to talk to him or her about things,earn there trust,Kids should always be able to talk to there parents,but that doesn't mean they will.They can be very complicated,or maybe it's just something that they might want to keep to remember what happened in their life when they get grown.|`|MS6IzOPLaa	Not at all...journals are private and a great way for teenagers (or anyone for that matter) to vent.  It is also a great way to keep a written record for future generations.|`|EMKuBql8aa	Nope. I think a journal is a place that should be kept private cause everybody needs a way to let out there feelings without fear of a parent snooping. It does no harm, so let it be.|`|kwMA5I1iaa	I think a journal is very personal. I would not look at it if I came across it. There are boundaries that shouldn't be crossed.|`|ZcsMEmLnaa	I keep a journal. And I'd be irate if my parents read it. It's our way to express the things we can't tell our parents or friends. My sister read mine one time and she told my mom and step dad. I was so pissed at her I beat the hell out of her. Its was my own business not her's to tell... Not to mention she lied about what some of it said. That's why I beat the crap out of her. But either way, I would never read it! It's an invasion of privacy.|`|efbb15bd3b273c3e6801e5fe2b1add09aa	truthfully, I am a nosey person and it would drive me bonkers wanting to know, however I would not invade their privacy unless I really felt there was a big problem like drugs, sex, etc...|`|jn34aSgHaa	well i would you have hid it from your parents? this is a way to express her feelings with out being judged therefore i dont think that you should read it in the 1st place if she dosent feel confertable telling you something then you need to work a bit harder to gain her trust but she might also feel emberansed to tell you somethings. just try to talk to her and see whats on her mind. let her know that you found the journal and that you didnt look in it and that you would like her to tell you whats in it when she feel confertable.|`|frpCK0utaa	no i wouldnt want to look at it. Its a very personal thing, would hurt the trust between the teeen and the parent.|`|S7VJ1GDdaa	My son has to the best of my knowledge kept a journal, and if he did, it would be his business and not mine. He is 20 y o and is in his 4th semester at the state college. He always wants me to open his mail, etc..., but I would never look at something if he did not want me too. I feel that is disrespecting the one that he journal/ diary belongs to, and they will then have ( the child/youth) trust issues with the one who looked without permission. My son and I talk about everything and anything, but we respect each other.

Hope this will help the sperm to swim easily..    Best wishes|`|lTkYWiy5aa	The only thing you need is a lot of patience! It could take a few months to conceive and that's normal.

O5WJGTmVaa	My first born was an emergency C, that was not very pleasant, but my doc told me I should have my daughter via a C-section due to me already having one.  The planned C was much easier.  My recoup was very fast and minimal pain.  Yes you can elect to have your baby that way, it is becoming very common.  There are risks you should ask your doctor about though.  And do your own research online.  Best of luck to you and hang in there.....either way is not that bad, I had two C-sections and one natural, both were not all that bad!|`|ggfE4rlvaa	C-sections cause so much damage to your body. It's built to push a baby out of the birth canal, not be sliced open and tugged, and wrenching the baby out. (I seen my sisters C-section, and it was pretty violent, loll). I had a natural birth with my daughter, and very much plan on it again with my second. I don't think c-sections should be allowed to be elected, like previous answers..it's major surgery and women do it for superficial reasons sometimes, and don't think about a huge scar on the outside and inside of your body. Almost every time you get a c-section, that's your only form of birthing after, it's hard to give natural birth after that cause the scar could tear your uterus open. So, in short: natural birth is exactly what it is "natural", c-sections aren't worth the trouble if you can avoid them!|`|PFO1jxZGaa	I think what many women fail to realize is that it is major abdominal surgery with serious possible complications. I think you should talk to your dr about it, she will able to tell you better about pros and cons.   I never had one ( all my babies were over 9 lbs) and I was walking and feeling great within hours of my deliveries. With c-sections the recovery is much longer, they dont want you to lift anything heavier than the baby for weeks etc. The women  I know who had it, some had a very easy recovery, for others it took weeks to resume normal activity.   If there isnt any complications I would recommend going with vaginal birth.|`|EHY3FnAmaa	I did not know you could chose to get a C section.    I dont know why you would except being scared  which I dont think is a big enough reason for one.|`|eN5xA6RKaa	i personally would only get it if it was an emergency.  pros-  faster  less pain    cons-  large scar  major surgury  risky  longer/more painful recovery|`|da8d3fa7a075907fff1a655c9a107079aa	Childbirth is nerve wracking but a c-section isn't the answer...trust me I've had 3.  Recovery is much longer, pain lasts much longer...OK the birth is pretty painless but  after the epidural wears off it is uncomfortable.  Seriously, if I could I would have much preferred a natural birth.|`|PLK1p8cUaa	Personally, I am against it.  I have had a C/S and I have had 3 vaginal births with the longest labor being 17.5 hours.  I would take the labor over the C/S any day.  The C/S comes with many risks including maternal death, post op healing complications and high exposure to your baby to anesthesia.  To anyone who says it is easier to just have them cut the baby out is crazy.  For a vaginal delivery all the hard work is in the beginning and you are just sore after.  You get to enjoy your baby right away.  With surgery you need at least a 6-8 weeks recovery period from this major abdominal surgery.  How can you enjoy your baby and try to take care of yourself?  Yes, there are many superwomen who do but the majority of women don't just jump up and recover.  A C/S HURTS!     Don't be afraid of labor.  Your body knows what to do.  Just think of all the women through out history who have gone through labor.   The nervousness is common but educating yourself on what to expect will help alleviate your apprehension.  I just don't think the pain post C/S is worth not dealing with the labor out of fear.  Good luck.    Many insurances will not cover a C/S unless it is medically necessary.  Your doctor has to have a medical reason to do it and not just because you are afraid.|`|L0873cdDaa	It is a bad idea. C sections are major surgery, you could have many complications, plus you will have a scar. It is much safer for you and the baby to do it naturally.|`|YJNql5Mgaa	Yes, definitely talk to your doctor about it. Some only do emergency c-sections.  Pro: faster birth. Con: Waaay longer recovery.      I had an emergency one.
tfTQ6Cuuaa	I'd pack now...I packed a crossword book, comfy stretchy pants & tank top (I delivered in July though, you may need warm clothes). Bathrobe, disposable/digital camera, conditioner (I have super long hair and their tiny bottles don't cut it). I packed my granny panties because I *swore* I wasn't going to wear those mesh underwear they give you, but I loved them. I even took a pair home. They just offer so much more support and they are disposable so you don't have to worry about leaking on them. I packed super thick absorbancy pads but they sent me home with some. The kind with ice in them are GREAT if they give them to you after wards, especially if you get stitches. I also packed several different baby outfits. Different sizes (I did 0-3 and 3-6 incase I had a chunker) for pictures.    Hmmmm I think that's about it. Don't forget to take any medications you will need. That you may want to do last though cuz it's best to bring them in their original bottles, some places insist you take their medications...I smuggled my own in so I didn't have to pay for them.    I think they say to pack clothes that you would've when you were 5 mos preggo since you will still have a belly. Stretchy is good. And throw a pillow in the car to sit in on your ride home. Cushy is good!|`|jLf2Lbbcaa	http://archshrk.com/2007/10/what-to-pack...    Here's a great list|`|AsICkz9naa	Pack your bag and be ready from 36 weeks. Here's what to pack for baby:  Newborn nappies 1 pack  Baby wipes/cotton wool  3 babygros  3 baby vests  Scratch mitts  Going home clothes for baby  Baby car seat (for discharge from hospital)    For you:  Front opening pyjamas/nightdress (for breastfeeding)  Nursing bras (for breastfeeding)  Breast pads (even if not breastfeeding)  Dark coloured towels   Something to give birth in  Cheap or disposable knickers  Very absorbant sanitary pads  Slippers and dressing gown  Toiletries bag and make up  Clothes for going home  Change for the phone (coins)  Birth plan  Camera|`|VUss5AfAaa	i started packing at 36 weeks.  i packed my bra underware and night gown, slippers. socks,sweat pants to wear to come home to with a loose shirt ..and a waist band to make my stomach flat again lol.    music ipod,book,change.
L6acUNBcaa	Boys.......    lol No, I think he likes you back!|`|Osn1xpu6aa	I think that you need to somehow tell him you like him, just get it off your chest.   Nearly 2 years of this? come on.|`|EMKuBql8aa	Ah, you sound young.    Like, lust and love our three completely different things.  You might lust for 100+ people, but like....I doubt that. It's ok to be attracted to people, but you have to know them, their likes/dislikes, habits and so on to like or love them.     This guy can either like you back, or maybe he is just trying to be friendly cause he knew you for awhile. Ask him on a date if you are old enough.|`|ufTjv25Jaa	Ok lol for starters, stop saying like so much!     You need to confront him, this can't keep going on. All this time you could have had a relationship with him if you had told him! Just ask him straight out if he has any interest in you, and tell him how much you like him, and how he is confusing you with his behaviour.
NS5fnxpNaa	There are a lot of food yo can get. First of all fruits, Apples are great you can eat the as is or you can cut them up and make applesauce, or just bake them a bag of apples will go a long way. another fruit that last a long time are oranges, great for snacks, I hope you are teaching your kids that vegetables are good for them. Broccoli you can eat raw, boil them and you can make soup called broccoli soup, you can add them to your salads. carrots are also great for kids, they last for weeks, and again you can eat them raw, sliced and cooked you can add orange juice and a little brown sugar in them and you have a glazed carrots. Green beans last. The list just goes on and on. The nice thing you can get them fresh or frozen or just in a can. I like fresh myself. Bell peppers are another great veg. You can make stuffed bell peppers and you can also put them in salads. I also do a lot of stir fries with my vegetables. Meats you cant go wrong with 80% ground beef for so many recipes, The stuffed bell peppers, meat loaf, meat ball sandwiches, Peas, ground beef, and mushrooms an toast, and many more. Chicken is another good one, bbq chicken, fried chicken, chicken noodle soup, chicken and rice soup, baked chicken, roasted chicken, there are just to many things to list. Beef, and of course pork. The spices that any pantry need is onion powder, garlic powder, met tenderizer, chicken,beef and vegtable stock, salt and pepper, olive oil, and conola oil, I dont use vegtable or corn oil. But I will tell you if you would like and of these recipes or anything else please contact me I love to cook and I will help you out. Find out if you have a sprouts store where you live. I shop there for my vegtables they are so nice and way cheper than king soopers,kroggers, safeways. But I do also shop at king soopers and wal-marts. I also use coupons, last week I saved 23.00. So any time you need help contact me|`|vsuXCMqzaa	Wow, where to begin? We usually spend $125 a week... but that varies depending on where you live.    Buy in bulk items such as:  Rices  Pastas  Potatoes  Canned foods  Cheese in the brick, will last longer in the fridge    Buy items that freeze well such as  Meats  Veggies  Fruits  Milk  Breads    Overall Seasonings:  Salt/Pepper  All Seasoning  Italian Seasonings  Cilantro or Oregano  A spicy seasoning you like such as Cayenne or Chilli pepper  Garlic  Onion  I also use alot of onion soup mixes in things and cream of mushroom soup in the can      I shop according to sales, whatever meats, veggies, etc. are on sale for the week is what I get.    We usually eat cereals for fiber and hard boiled eggs for protein for breakfast, sometimes toast or english muffins.    For lunch we make sure to eat a fruit such as apples, bananas, or oranges. Also a protein such as tuna or deli meat or left overs from the night before. Breads or tortilla's. My husband also likes crackers or chips or granola with his lunch such as tortilla chips with salsa, cheese nips or granola bars. Sometimes you can get the lean cousine's on sale for less than a $1 each and have a hot lunch.    For dinner we eat a protein such as chicken or beef (either by itself or in a casserole or crockpot). Lots of different salads, we like the salad kits you can get for variety or I just buy a variety of veggies and fruits and make our own unique combos. We also eat a veggie like asparagus (canned) or green beans, corn, carrots, etc. and some kind of fruit (usually canned).    I have it lucky because my husband will eat veggies. But I've heard of some that grind up the veggies and put into main meals without their spouse knowing it. Like ground up carrots into meat loaf. Or ground up broccoli into chicken alfredo.    When shopping for 2 weeks at a time, you may have to have a log for awhile to see how much milk you drink, bread you eat, etc. and then buy that amount and freeze the extra. Also, the fillers such as pastas and rices and potatoes will help you to stretch your meals for longer and cheaper. You can take chicken and pasta and make several meals out it depending on the sauce, seasonings, etc. Anything from italian to spicy to oriental.    I've found it helpful to google things. Such as I'll have potatoes and hamburger but don't know what to make so I google it and get some great new ideas.    Have fun and be creative and it will come to you!|`|vDdHmLk7aa	Well first I would say, stop buying packaged rice/pasta dishes. They have loads of fat and sodium and are also way more expensive than just buying pasta or rice yourself and making dishes that way. 150$ is ALOT unless you're buying alot of meat and produce, that always drives the bill up. I try to stock up on frozen veggies, whichever brand is on sale, and I only buy fruit that is in season. (Like, apples in fall, strawberries right now, etc.) There are a bunch of websites for frugal recipes and shopping lists, just google it. I try and make simple recipes like penne with sauce and broccoli, with sausage or meatballs on the side. I make extra sauce and meat and freeze it, and then next time I only have to boil the pasta and microwave the frozen broccoli. Good luck and remember, the less packaged food you buy the better!|`|JsEd4H0raa	My mom spends about 150 a week.    She makes a menu out.    We eat Chili. She makes it in the crock pot. She puts all the beans and stuff together.    We have chicken. stuffing. and green beans.    Pizza. (Frozen)    we eat out once a week.    pot roast    my parents also make a lot of breads. like apple Cinnamon, blueberry, banana. she makes muffins. those are a lot of our breakfasts and snack. we have eggs and hash browns, bagels, cereal. and such for breakfast. i have frozen dinners for lunch when I go to school. as for the children    casseroles    get a cook book and look through there I am sure there are some simple recipes in there.     Make a 2 week grocery list.    Say   Sunday. Breakfast. Cereal  "            Snack. Muffins.  "            Lunch. Sandwiches  "            Snack. Crackers  "            Dinner. Casserole.

Tuesday  Wednesday  Thursday  Friday  Saturday  Sunday  etc. Just sit down and plan meals for every meal of the day for 2 weeks. It takes time but you need to get in the habit of it.    When it comes to Desserts. Ice Cream. Buy Brownie Mix.    Hope I helped.

AP1MtPN5aa	you can NEVER get a false positive but you can definitly get a false negative..(you either have the hormone in you or you dont) good luck hun, wait til its due.. u may be suprised and get it..|`|SxxXBC4vaa	if you were only on the nuva ring for 2 weeks that's not really enough to do anything. Also, when I gor pregnant a week or so before my period I was having cramping too, I didn't have any spotting either. take another test in a week or so.. and good luck.
D7MIgF96aa	Kinsley is very cute&unique   kallie is a little bit TOO common   but if you are going with K's  Kylie and Kyra are sorta similar to both those name and it is veryy unique|`|bDPqMrb8aa	your right, kallie is common, but there are names more so. personally, i dont like the sound of kinsley, so i would pick kallie.|`|XzV4bUeFaa	I like Kallie, and it isn't common when spelled this way.|`|pbfkYJ2daa	kallie!|`|SVyBjDguaa	:p my name kinda =]    Well, I like Kallie better, Kinsley doesn't sound that great to me.    =]|`|8vEPWEFIaa	kinsley. much cuter!!|`|4fhizRp7aa	Kinsley is more of a last name and theres no nicknames so how bout kallie spelled  Kallee or Kaley or Kalie|`|nsSU9N40aa	i like Kallie.

P37lIBr2aa	I'm 28 weeks as well and have been experiencing this. They mainly come right before I go to bed and last about an hour. They are just braxton hicks according to my midwife. It's mainly your body preparing for the labor that will be coming in the next month or so. Unless they are very strong and become too much to handle I would think you were okay. They aren't too much fun but at least your body is getting ready! :-)  **Edit: I had been experiencing this too and finally was told to get checked out and it turns out I was having contractions! If it feels different to you I would get checked out just in case. I thought it was fine but I had no idea! Good luck!|`|nzGdMWbZaa	Call your Obgyn immediately. I hope everything is Ok.|`|q7sgWqZ3aa	Those can be braxton hicks, because sometimes they can be described like period like cramps. If it is accompanied by bleeding, call your doctor/go to the ER and get everything looked at.|`|jZ6fTOyZaa	The best answer I can give you is to talk to you obgyn. They could also be braxton hicks contractions.|`|AP1MtPN5aa	braxton hicks or the way the baby is laying..|`|AA12345219	I just started experiencing the same thing this week. Felt just like period cramps, and seemed to be fairly constant, not coming and going like everyone says contractions do. Anyway, I had my OB appointment yesterday and I asked her and she said that it's totally normal and a lot of women experience it, just as long as they don't start coming and going at regular intervals that you can time, and have no spotting or abnormal discharge with them. They are a pain though!
CMuL7XpKaa	Yeah it's "Wished-for child"  Here's the link  http://babynamer.com/Marie|`|UJaCObdyaa	My middle name is Maree spelt this way.  It is not as common but is pronounced the same.    Lauren Maree is my name and I love it.|`|qoBlB9nVaa	The beautiful|`|MyUx7Bp0aa	Merie(with this spelling) means happy.|`|JGQsowK9aa	The girl's name Marie \m(a)-rie\ is of French origin. Variant of Mary (Latin) "star of the sea". Earliest English form of the name which was revived in the 19th century.|`|Xkas9BG2aa	I know what you mean.  I have the name Mary...and Catherine as a middle name.   Sometimes when I'm feeling bitter about something, I blame it on my name.  I was born in Poland and my birth certificate says Maria, but my mother had it Anglicized when we arrived in America when I was 5 yrs. old.  I don't really like Mary or Maria, but do like what my Polish relatives would call me....either Marisha or Marila (spelling not sure).  I especially like Marisha...how do you like Kaylee Marisha?|`|tyqN6qBUaa	I only know of "bitter". This is the type of situation where I ignore the meaning, because I love Marie as a first name. I like Jo-Marie by the way, especially if you're not planning on having any more kids. If you are, then I would save Jo or Josephine for another little girl's middle name.|`|ZA3N1wE4aa	Go to www.behindthename.com - I think you'll be happy with what you read there. Be sure to click on the link to Mary, where everything is explained.|`|AA11955868	Looking up everything it looks like they are basing their meaning on it's latin root, regardless if it's an english, french, or hebrew names. babynames says it's a 'sea of bitterness' look at that, you thought you had a little bitterness and here you had a whole sea.    It's my middle name and I never knew it meant bitter, so I wouldn't worry too much about it. I've always thought it was a very pretty name, and feel bad for its reputation as filler. I may name any daughters I have Marie just to get it back on the map.    Congrats!    p.s. I loved the character kaylee on firefly the tv show :D|`|MoaIQPvCaa	Marie (also spelled Maree) comes from the names Maria and Mary. It is a French name with the inherent meaning being bitterness, but the spiritual connotation is Consoled. The scripture verse for this name is Isaiah 2:11.|`|jZ6fTOyZaa	My middle name is marie after my grandmother...and neither one of us are bitter...dont over think it, youll make yourself crazy...isnt marie short for Maria?|`|mQ2gLxj1aa	MarieH  Maryeah|`|XzV4bUeFaa	Why worry about meaning?  The name Kaylee-Jo Marie is beautiful.  I know I sort of changed it...but, I sort of like Kaylee-Jo, as opposed to Jo-Marie.  What do you think?|`|8ca4e1bf1d27b6b183464e694ae56d4baa	Marie is the French form of Maria, coming from the Hebrew name 'Miriam'. Namesakes include Marie Curie, Marie Claire and Mary Antoinette.  Marie     The name Marie is a baby girl name. The name Marie comes from the Hebrew origin. In Hebrew The meaning of the name Marie is: Variant of Mary: Wished-for child; rebellion; bitter.      Similar Names:    Earie ( Scottish )   Arie ( Hebrew )   Marie ( English )   Marie ( French )   Marie ( Hebrew )|`|KwJDWvB3aa	it can mean..    star of the sea    or marie comes from the name mary wich means    sea of sorrow  rebellion  wished-for child  mistress  lady of the sea
hzgFAJv0aa	There are some other regular posters here who can really give you more help (look through Possum or Heather B.'s posts) but some good places to start are:    http://www.isrr.net/  http://registry.adoption.com/  http://www.adoptioncrossroads.org/    Good luck! Maybe he is looking for you all too! :)    PS There are people who will try to talk you out of searching. Ignore them. You are family and he can always say "no" if he doesn't want contact -  IMO, it's better to try than to always wonder "what if". Most adoptees have some level of curiosity so I wouldn't let anybody but him tell you "no". :)|`|JZVVc6Neaa	Other than the registries that have been offered there is not much you can do since you are not a parent, adoptee, lineal descendant of an adoptee nor a sibling.    A lot is going to depend on where he was born and where he was adopted.  If you can get one of his siblings - one of your parents - to sign up with a sibling registry, you'll have a chance to get a match IF the state allows siblings to register.  But YOUR rights to information are going to be limited.|`|vwTyihvvaa	You would have to know the adoption agency that your uncle was adopted through and go from there.
FTRs5w3eaa	Its pretty much when your doctor wants you to ovulate. Obvioulsy if you take it on CD3-7 you will ovulate sooner than CD5-9. If you have normal periods, your doctor could be making sure that he is giving the Clomid on the right days to correspond with your normal cycle. If you have irregular periods, its based on the doctors opinion.|`|mx3gFmIKaa	Two days, lol.  I did clomid 5-9 and my ovulation was day 26.  Clomid tends to lengthen the cycle, and pcos women typically have irregular, long cycles anyway|`|jNPCT96Xaa	If I am not mistaken, a lot of it has to do with how long your cycles are and what hormones are produced at certain times of your cycle. I think that is why the start dates for Clomid are different. I know my first cycle they wanted me to start on day 1 and the next cycle day 3.
ggfE4rlvaa	He will drop very soon! My daughter dropped at 34 weeks and now my Braxton Hicks contractions don't squeeze my lungs anymore. You're not too early either..this is about the time it can happen safely, the last few weeks are uncomfortable enough as it is, add tightness and an inability to breath, and you got yourself a hormonal rampage, lol! Best of luck to you and the baby!|`|vdIZU4ePaa	congrats on the boy, I'm 31 weeks with a girl! I completely agree, I can hardly breath anymore. I am super short (4'9") and even when she drops it really isn't going to help much. There isn't room there anyway. But I sure would like to breath again, sleep soundly without breathing hard enough my husband complains, and be able to walk somewhere with my kids without feeling like I am dieing LOL.    Good luck in the weeks to come! Hang in there, its almost over...|`|OPTDFRuzaa	hey i know its especially hard in the last 10 weeks but baby will drop when he is ready and it wont be long. good luck,|`|ebCzRLw7aa	im only 22 weeks, and im finding it really hard to breath!  its like i lose my breath at the sight of stairs.|`|cSm1zod4aa	Hi, I am 20 weeks pregnant with my first so I am not quite sure. But I think he/she will drop as soon as they are ready. Its funny, in the beginning we are waiting and wondering when they are going to move up and take the pressure off our abdomen and bladder and then later on we can't wait for them to drop lower..lol We women are amazing, men would never be patient enough for the things we go through :-D  Best of luck!!|`|P37lIBr2aa	I'm with ya sister! I'm very small (5"2" 105 pre pregnancy weight) and I've had a hard time breathing for months now. I'm getting a little claustrophic now that he is much bigger! lol. (I'm 28 weeks) Don't worry though, lots of us go through it and in the end it will be so worth it. Sorry it's uncomfortable though, I know that's no fun.     Congrats on the baby!|`|eb3DjxVlaa	My sister was like that last year, she just yelled at us alot,
kGFtUZaiaa	ducolax stool softener pills  - doesnt make you have to go, just makes it easier|`|vrwFgpNKaa	i had this trouble, i was severely constipated right thru my pregnancy. she is best taking to her doctor but DONT listen to people that say eat more veggies, bran etc.. IT DOESNT WORK! she can take stool softeners which helped me. i ended up needing 2 enemas in hospital that's how bad i got. its the hormones in pregnancy and the bowel is squashed from the baby. but she is best speaking with her obstetrician. PS. dont use senna tablets it gave me CHRONIC bowel spasms and pain.|`|lCwjDDcoaa	Over the counter Stool Softeners.|`|gT2P6Ufgaa	She can still eat foods that will loosen her bowl. It differs from person to person. But there's no reason why she can't load up on bran and hope for the best. However, if she's that uncomfortable she should talk to her doctor, there are a lot of stool softeners and older formulas available for constipation. Also, constipation is something that plagues a lot of pregnant woman, and sometimes you just have to wait it out:( Eventually, it will come.
ry42ObN7aa	Ha ha I know how that is...they make up so many lies and those lies cover other lies. Then they look stupid when they run out of wack excuses. XD|`|ELZLPcMwaa	Well... what i'd do is say  "mom, i know your busy and everything, but could you help me out with this? I could be spending time on my 360 but instead i turned it in for a mere cellphone."    Well anyways, thats what i would do too    AZN PRIDE|`|S7VJ1GDdaa	As a mom ( he is now 20 y o), I can feel for you because my mom (I am 40 y o) has told me for the past 6 months she is coming to visit. We only live 3 hours, and that isn't that far. I do hope you get your phone because it is only fair that she give you what you traded for. I would if you were my daughter. Personally, my son was my job as working out of the house has been for my husband. Sometimes parents forget why they have kids in the first place. Good Luck on getting your phone.|`|95rnnytEaa	yeah i hate when parents do that  i just got my learners and ive been "supposed 2 go driving 2moro for the past week and a half"|`|Pwsuhe2vaa	Oh man, that sounds exactly like my mom! ~much love~|`|0wSHIUB2aa	LOl My mom takes my phone away evry time i get a c on my report card!!!|`|nAqD3mb5aa	oooh yeah! My mom is exaaactly like that. And then I ask her all the time, and then shes like : You only wanna talk to me when you want something :P haha|`|t7BXR4gzaa	I think you should tell your dad about the problem. Maybe he will tell your mom about it.  And i do hate it when my parents do that to me, but not about getting a cellphone.I already have one.  Hope this helps you! =)|`|dsGUSg6Daa	You don't have a good defense!!!!!!!!!  Your mom buys your clothes, food, etc. stop being a spoiled brat and buy it yourself!|`|AkFag8tNaa	Awww, your mom won't get you a cell phone. I'm so sick of teen entitlement. Guess what, your mother works hard and she's footing the bill so maybe you should do some chores and appreciate what you've got.|`|HXQ5cVzYaa	And they wonder why WE don't do things on time.|`|ZwW5YlVgaa	maybe she can't afford to get one? Or maybe she doesn't quite trust you with one yet!  Ask her why she said she was going to and now has changed her mind!|`|AA12223669	I don't know your mom the way you do, but cut her some slack. It's not easy being a mom. Before you she only had herself (and possibly her signifigant other) to worry about.     It is frustrating when parents say things like "I'll take care of this on this date" and they don't... but sometimes other stuff comes up and getting you a phone isn't always first priority. She'll probably be able to help you take care of it this weekend.    Maybe ask her if there is a time on Saturday that you two can do this together. She will probably set aside the time, as you requested, or she might say "No need to wait that long, lets go now".    But remember to always show her respect, even if she promised something she hasn't come through with yet.|`|bd2887f2ddb4e37e81ea083f8d7a28e8aa	You can activate the phone by phone so if you already have the phone and it isn't on then get the number from online and get the esn number ready and on paper and when she isn't doing anything ask her to call...if it takes a sim card then idk what to say...if you still need a phone go to the phone company's website and pick our a phone they'd actually buy and call her over to the computer and ask her to order it.. that way they will send it to you and it'll be activated when you get it|`|qLkMSEBwaa	1st of all..be grateful you even have a mom..mine died 3 years after our evil dad was killed in self-defense by my 17 yr old brother in front of me when I was 10..After many years of abuse and torture.      You Sound like a spoiled brat!!!!!!!!!!!!  Did it ever cross your mind, that because times are tough, that she may NOT have the money for it?????????  GROW UP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  There is much more worse than not having your own cell phone as a kid!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Turn on the damn news once in awhile and look at how many people are losing their homes..Parents losing their jobs and deciding that killing their own kids, then themselves is the ONLY way they see out of our messed up economy!!!  People are becoming homeless or have no food or both!!!!!!!  We are in a damn war and people's families are being killed every single damn day!!!!!!!!!!!    Take a walk in Children's hospital and see how many kids either is going to die from a severe beating someone gave them or struck down by some incurable disease and will never live to see the outside of a hospital ever again alive!!!!!!!!!!!!  Or, if you are lucky enough to live a long happy life, some sick@ss punk, beats, rapes, and kills you...That just happened around were I live to several women!!!!!!!!!!      I suggest, if you want the damn cell phone so bad, you find a way to pay for it yourself!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    1st of all missy...How do you plan to make me stfu???????  Type me to death?????????? LMFAO!!!!!!!!!!!!  Who bought you the 360?  Was it you mom????????  Did you pay for it?????????  SPOILED BRAT kids will NEVER see there is way more important things in life than not having a damn cell phone!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  GOT IT!!!!!!!!!!!  NO????????  THEN YOU NEVER WILL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  GROW UP!!!!!!!!!!!!  I'm sure with the money your mom spends on clothes, bills, shelter, and food for you doesn't count for anything does it????????????????????????????|`|MZPuDifYaa	Trueee.|`|PPMMQ9fUaa	yea thats bad, but think on the bright side,  at least your mom didnt take apart your computer and hide the pieces when she felt you were on too long|`|UbYl29xYaa	veryy truee|`|MhZvYb8Baa	awh, i love those things parents do.
7a57235219ee07bdfd4f569a85d2a3e3aa	Just tell him how wonderful, powerful and amazing he is while having sex. He will perform much better and without pressure.  That's what I do to my hubby, it helps him to perform and enjoy well without getting stressed about only 'impregnating' me.|`|ibWLdXlJaa	Quit trying. Just do it for the pure joy of it. ;) It will be easier when neither of you stress out about it. Best of luck to you both!|`|FXPTeTcPaa	When is the wedding? Do you want to be prego for the wedding? Maybe he's anxious because of that too.|`|rgxoDpYWaa	I am in the same situation. I have 3 children from before and now me and my fiance would like just one more as he has no children. I had my mirena out on  the 5th of Jan and have been trying ever since. We`bought an ovulation tester so I could have some idea when i'm ovulating but I dont tell him if I am i just set out determined to bd and usually if you are making the right moves and not making him feel like a baby making machine/ sperm doner it will.   Good luck with everthing.
PLK1p8cUaa	I have seen it happen.  Take a test, call your doctor.  Good luck.
ngo1pmlGaa	well since his sister is your best friend maybe you could hang out at her house when hes there or something...do you know if he still likes you? or does he flirt with you at all? if he does just strut your stuff! lol if he really wants you back he will let you know!|`|0qP8gLpyaa	You'd be better off putting this in ADOLESCENT and NOT in TODDLER & PRESCHOOLER.|`|Ps5rsLyeaa	Why is this in the toddler and preschooler section?  and its not a big deal your only in 8th grade you have your life in high school to be worrying about dating.
fccdcaa6e1aa306a88110de27284c970aa	Yes you can get pregnant at ANYTIME|`|cj7sSPZEaa	Yep.  There is nothing different with your body the first time you have sex and the last time you have sex.|`|hDnX6Vx6aa	yes. sometimes it is easier because you don't know how to use protection properly.|`|XhIYAH6Laa	Yes..if your ovulating and you have sex it doesn't matter if its your first or your twenty first time..you could become pregnant|`|tbeO3Lataa	Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Sorry, I have dealt with far too many women and girls who made the mistake of thinking it is not possible to get pregnant the first time.|`|PLK1p8cUaa	OMG YES!  Hi probability especially if you do not use any form of protection.  Pulling out does not work as well so don't count on that for birth control.|`|UjhWIrJ1aa	First time? Of course not. And if you were on top, you definitaly have NOTHING at all to worry about...|`|3YiZ63OVaa	yes, its no differant|`|GdSzrtmAaa	Yes!|`|hBGZYDKAaa	Yeah of course anything can happen even if it's your first time your on birth control and he uses a condom you could still get pregnant your chances are lower but anything can happen,|`|9hrJfhIIaa	Sure can.|`|zjuMrDmGaa	Yes...just because it's your first time doesn't make you bullet proof.|`|tyqN6qBUaa	Yes, there's nothing special about it being your first time or your one millionth.|`|SxxXBC4vaa	you can get pregnant ANYTIME you have sex, unless of course you are using a reliable form of birth control, which still isn't 100% that you won't get pregnant. what are they teaching in health ed these days??|`|DmUG33axaa	yes most definitely in fact, i know 2 people who did because they thought they couldn't|`|Ctgc429laa	absolutely.  you could get pregnant any time you have sex|`|OWLBqjpfaa	yes|`|lMZQJEsKaa	YES!!|`|wUVUXHZtaa	Regardless of it being the 1st or 100th time, chances don't change|`|YH46aQCtaa	Yes you can! It's no different from any other time. Though I wish it was! lol|`|XiUnT0Pnaa	yeah you can get prego no matter what happens. People just say you don't. Just be careful if your not going to wear a condom.|`|d9WUbMBmaa	YES. You can also get pregnant even if:  - you have a bath straight after  - you do it standing up  - he pulls out first  - the girl is on top    Basically, if you don't use protection!|`|Elaimr9qaa	you can get pregnant anytime when you have sex.
AA11763588	Are you on Birth Control? If not, you could have just missed it. Stress can delay a period.    Either wait till your Febuary period, and if it doesn't show call your DR and have a blood test.|`|a12cbnR4aa	You may have taken the test too soon. Wait a couple of days and take another one. If your period doesn't start and you still get a negative, then you should seek your physician.|`|wUVUXHZtaa	Are you on BC. There is always the chance of a false negative|`|4Sr0ZDtfaa	go to your gynocologist|`|gyIHWagIaa	it depends a lot on your health as well. say if you are very thin, this can effect your period. stress is also a really big factor. as well as sports and strenuous activity. but i would say, if you dont get your period within the next few days, you should see your doctor or go to planned parenthood. best of luck to you.|`|QRHufyHiaa	wait a few days and take a test. good luck :)|`|k74TBgCCaa	well if you haven't been doin the dirty then your fine .  haha .  umm yea periods aren't always normal .  it's happened to me before .  trust me you'll get it within a week .
AA11763588	You ovulate 10 - 14 days from the day you started your period.     I'd just wait till the 31st, if it doesn't show up take a test first thing in the morning, or wait 5 days for a more accurate result.|`|28fNd725aa	wait till you are suppose to start.. if you dont test!|`|a12cbnR4aa	Wait til the first day of your missed period. maybe even wait a couple days past that to get the most accurate reading. Take the test first thing in the morning when you wake up.|`|eN5xA6RKaa	your probably not pregnant. since your cycle is a normal 28 day cycle you ovulated 14 days after your period. so your chances of getting pregnant were around the 13-15 days after you ovulated. if your trying to get pregnant, have sex 13-15 days after your period, that when your most likely to get pregnant, and if your not trying, use protection.|`|AsICkz9naa	The chances of pregnancy are little, but possible. You ovulate about a week to 10 days after your period finishes.Or more accurately you ovulate 14 days before your next period starts. So from the dates you give, you ovulated on day 17. Your egg stays alive in your body for only 24 hours but in the correct conditions sperm can live in your body for up to 7 days. You can do a pregnancy test from the first day of your missed period. Good luck|`|AP1MtPN5aa	most p tests are advanced now adays where you dont have to wait il you miss your period..  also.. its the 10-18th days after your period your the most fertile..but everyones different so maybe your alate ovulator..|`|721WsvZiaa	Why are you asking me !!!!
5f69hQT2aa	I really like the sound of Gabriella Renae. I think Corinna Kate sounds a bit tacky.|`|XzV4bUeFaa	I love Gabriella Renae and I also like Corinna but Kate while nice doesn't go that great w/Corrina.  Why not Corinna Renae?  It sounds just as nice as Gabriella Renae|`|xLabGD6Maa	I like Corinna Louise and Gabrella Kathleen|`|4fhizRp7aa	Gabriella Kate is good,  gabriella pam  Gabriella Sue  Gabriella Tori  Corrina Bree  Corrina Alice  Corrina Alex  Corrina Haley  Corrina Jami|`|w3tNq8npaa	Middle names...  How about Rose or Jean.    Suggestions for first names:  Audrey,Madelyn,Amanda,Briana|`|uj1A73ZGaa	I love:  Gabriella Renae  Gabriella Jade(my favorite)  Gabriella Skye  Gabriella Morgan    Good luck my girls names are Aaliyah-Mae Morgan, Harli-Lyn Makena and Jordyn Isabella|`|MyUx7Bp0aa	I think you should go with Gabriella.    Gabriella Kait  Gabriella Lily  Gabriella Victoria  Gabriella Juliet    I don't really like Renae, a middle name for Gabriella should be more classic in my opinion.|`|c7J6z1pmaa	i like gabriella michelle, or corrina abigale. my middle name is marie so i like more original middle names. Renae seems so common for such cute original first names|`|1dd029e8da5e4b3a5424b7f3e050f9f2aa	Gabriella Renae is a nice name. I am not sure about Corrina Kate. There is something that doesnt sound right. Probably because Kate has a hard sound where Corinna doesn't.     Maybe Corinna Kaye or Corrina Lynne     Corinna Marie?    Corinna Nicole?|`|8a4c030a7a44cd4edebe25c4141c6ddaaa	How about these:    Corrina Lynn  Corrina Bryn  Corrina Shae  Corrina Evette  Corrina Simone    Gabriella Monique  Gabriella Elaine  Gabriella Jace  Gabriella Grace    I do like Gabriella Renae, but not so much Corinna Kate..sorry!|`|QDRGmDIYaa	There is a singer named Gabriella Lucia Cilmi.|`|MoaIQPvCaa	I like Gabriella Renae, but I think Corinna needs a middle name with more than one syllable. How about Corinna Danae?|`|lnZjIhDCaa	Gabriella Renae sounds nice but I'm not loving Corrina Kate. I love Corrina but not Kate, it's so overused and it ruins the flow.  suggestions:  Corrina Giselle  Corrina Lilly  Corrina Bailey  Corrina Kathryn  Corrina Alexandria  Corrina Rae  Corrina Nadine  Corrina Blair  Corrina Roselle  Corrina Michelle  Corrina Rosalie
UgZq1pXjaa	I don't think he is too big for diapers.  If he is not potty trained or having issues, take a break from it and put diapers back on him and try in a couple months.  My son wets the bed at night and I put him in disposable diapers every night.  Hes not too big for them.  Everyone worries so much about older kids in diapers, I never let that bother me, its your child, raise them how you feel necessary.  Since you have a new one on the way, If you went back to diapers now, by April, I would be trying it again, take a break, it wont hurt a thing.  Good luck.|`|FAkkLDxjaa	Maybe you can try to take out artificial colors and flavorings from his diet. It can help with wetting day and night. If that could be the problem. Just a suggestion. I've been researching the Feingold Diet for ADHD/Autism, but have noticed that it can also help with wetting. Take care and hope that you find the answers.|`|J4AyTTZ3aa	There are some great tips here on how to toilet train that maybe you haven't seen before http://www.parentingaustralia.com.au/con...  Make sure you don't get angry at him over it or it will most likely make him even more anxious and have the opposite effect.
YJNql5Mgaa	Well, water breaking doesn't usually happen first.   I had active contractions for about 6 hours before I went in.  But I called about every 3 hours.  My contractions were really irregular but when I got to the hospital, my water broke over the toilet.  So they kept me checked in.|`|M5E3mDBJaa	My sister is on her labor and delivery rotation (she is studying to be a BN) and she says they generally tell you to come in when your contractions are between 5 and 7 minutes apart.|`|yB5go5wbaa	My OBGYN said to always call Labor & Delivery before going in, so that you don't get turned away.  At mine, they won't admit you until you're having contractions every 5 minutes, OR if your water breaks, but I'm not sure if it's exactly that at every hospital.  There's a lot of things that can factor in, so call the nurses there and describe everything, and they'll tell you whether or not to head in or not!|`|ZwW5YlVgaa	Lots of different things play a part in when to go to the hospital! As far as I am concerned its never TOO soon! Especially with your first because you don't know how fast it can come! I had both my babies VERY quickly. If I hadn't been induced with number 2 I never would have made the 30 minute drive to the hospital. If you are scared or in lots of pain or just want reassurance, just go in!!! The worst thats going to happen is they are going to send you home...|`|rHevYhzVaa	whenever you're in doubt call your OB/GYN and make him/her aware of what's going on.  Usually it's when you're having contractions every 5 minutes.|`|DLDweOcYaa	If your waters break then it's time to go to hospital.  Mine broke just before I reached 37 weeks.  If your waters haven't broken and you are having contractions, they need to be 5 minutes apart before you need to go to hospital.|`|POSGHgzuaa	Ask your doctor about her policy.  Mine actually had a handout that you could check.  Their rule was that if your water breaks or were having contractions less than 10 minutes apart, call them to let them know.  Then they'd ask you for more details and figure out what to do from there.      The mucus plug can show more than a week before labor begins, so that is not a reason to call the doctor, let alone rush to the hospital.
4D1VEKW5aa	This is the pregnancy section, not the homework section.|`|J3TRJPIwaa	Are you meaning companies over seas paying kids 5 cents an hour to make shoes in a sweat shop kinda situation? If so, wrong section.|`|UD3Tyf4gaa	Two words: public schools.
