I enjoy olives, too, but am not addicted.  When I was young I had no taste for them, but my father told me to eat seven olives and then you'll like them.  I've no idea why, but he was right.

VdbhuUYBaa	No, humans are not carnivores, we are omnivores.|`|5zNwBQZHaa	Humans evolved as omnivores - we eat both meat and plant matter.  We have the means to eat both and the enzymes to digest both.<br>  <br>  BTW - all mammals produce milk - not just those that you think are "Fat on veg"  Cows are not "fat" cows are just large animals.  Are elephants fat?  Have you ever seen a skinny one?  Silly question - of course they are not fat - they are they way they are supposed to be.  <br>  <br>  Man would not get the vitamins and other nutrients needed for survival if they only ate meat as do true carnivores do.|`|i2GRGLIpaa	Humans are omnivores. They require a balanced diet of protein, vegetables and fruits, grains, and the occasional oils, sugar, and fat. Humans on an all meat diet would lack many of the essential vitamins and minerals and would most likely have serious health problems. <br>  <br>  Vegetarians and vegans are able to cut out meat because they find alternate sources of protein. You are unlikely to find anyone living on only lettuce leaves.|`|xETCO0rUaa	Humans were meant to eat both plants and animals. We have flat teeth in the back so we can chew plants when the supply of meat is low, and we have our sharp canine teeth in the front to rip meat when plants are in low supply. But due to the technology and information we have today it is possable to only eat vegetables because we have found suppliments for meat.

Also read this before asking questions, so you don't sound stupid like some of the trolls who visit YA. <br>  <br>  Vegetarian diet: How to get the best nutrition<br>  <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/vegetarian-diet/HQ01596" rel="nofollow">http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/vegetar...</a>|`|Q4oPyclQaa	People don't understand your choice and, even if you don't talk about it, they feel the need to talk about it and then blame you for being "pushy", when really they're the one that started the conversation.  Happened to me a million times...<br>  <br>  "Why are you a vegetarian?"<br>  "I don't really like talking about it, I find it too controversial. It's just my diet choice and doesn't affect you."<br>  "No no, tell me, I'm interested."<br>  ".... blah blah blah talking about vegetarianism and its benefits....."<br>  "NO WAY, I'd never be a vegetarian, MMMM I love meat, why don't you just eat some bacon, it's delicious.  That's why I hate you vegetarians, you're always trying to change everyone."<br>  "..............."<br>  <br>  That's the major one that I encountered.  People use you as a scapegoat simply because you exist.<br>  <br>  Another struggle can be finding food to eat but I didn't have a problem in residence at college because my residence offered a vegetarian option.  Though, sometimes the vegetarian option sucked, and since there was only one choice, I'd be left with like, salad if I didn't want it, whereas non-vegetarians had several dinner choices as well as the whole rest of the cafeteria to choose from.|`|wtg8vtzBaa	Since you're in college, you should go to lunch with her or something, and try to eat an all-vegetarian meal at the cafeteria.

dD1WAPREaa	If you want melted chocolate to stay soft, mix in a little cream when you are melting it. A bain marie will keep it melted, but if even a little teeny bit of water gets into the chocolate the chocolate will seize up like crazy. A better idea, though it sounds ridiculous, is to put the chocolate in a medium metal bowl set into a large metal bowl with an electric blanket set to medium or low between the two. In any case, be prepared to re-stir it a lot.

ffe5fd93595474e278dc16274aa2a2d4aa	Well essentially your body does not need alcohol, it does just fine without it. It is healthier not to drink any yes, but it is not that harmful if you drink in moderation, and if you only have a little (like 1 glass of something a month) your damage to your body is almost nothing.<br>  <br>  But the fact is, its a product your body has to work to get rid of. It does this via your liver, and every time you eat or drink anything harmful (weather its alcohol, smoking, eating too much sugar....etc etc) your liver suffers somewhat. Its impossible for it to not have any damage, but its about minimising that. Some times your liver can repair minor parts of damage, but the one thing that stops that happening is...you guessed it, alcohol. So as long as your not drinking daily, your liver stands a chance of repairing some of the general daily damage and perhaps, even a little of the damaged caused by alcohol- though no promises, you do need to be eating healthily and drinking enough water for that to happen, and one drink can kill of much of the vitamins and dehydrate you of the water you have taken in. <br>  <br>  So that leaves you with your own gamble. The fact is, everyone is slighly different, and though some may show very tiny amounts of their liver damaged, others may react much worse and develop liver disease after taking in the same amount of alcohol throughout their lives. Its nothing to do with how well you can hold your drink and everything to do with how well your liver copes, which itself is defined by which genes your parents gave you. Gamble away!<br>  <br>  And just a note to anyone who will suggest that red wine is healthy and therefor OK, its OK in moderation, like 1 small 125ml glass per week after eating your healthy moderated diet of green vegetables, wholegrain carbohydrates, oily fish and not touching any sugar except eating fresh apples and fresh blueberrys. Not eating all that every day? well then maybe the one glass of red is best not followed.<br>  <br>  You cannot pick and choose what parts of healthy eating you want to follow and mix it with unhealthy stuff and expect the same result.<br>  <br>  If you are looking from the falvenoids and good stuff that comes from red wine, you do not need to drink red wine, you can get the same thing from black sugarless tea, 80% black chocolate (of which you do not need any more then 10 grams per day) and blueberrys, black berrys and red cabbage eaten raw.|`|lynmeenmaa	am wel yeah but for someone who drinks in moderation, or even binges once or twice a year it dont do any harm. and its fun! so **** ur health and get drunk once in a while!|`|cbp7Gukbaa	I drink a glass every day and nothing is wrong with me|`|Q4oPyclQaa	Alcohol provides nothing for your body.  It's unnecessary and kills brain cells.  The myth that "a little alcohol is good for you" arises from the fact that red wine is good for you due to the tannins and anti-oxidants.  However, a high quality red grape juice would be exactly the same good for you, but even better because it lacks the "poison" of alcohol.<br>  <br>  Don't get me wrong.  I know I'm gonna get votes down because people will go "I drink a glass every day and nothing's wrong with me!"  I'm not saying alcohol is bad.  But it doesn't have any useful effect.  Me, I drink a beer every few days.  I don't hate alcohol.  But these are the facts.|`|sbnUAllfaa	Was it Paul in the Bible who said a little wine is good for your stomach. It maybe he had drunk contaminated water. Also the wine was not that alcoholic maybe then as it is today. I rather think wine was more preferred because of water pollution in the middle east. World wide nothing much has changed, <br>  <br>  As bottled water is sold in those countries for drinking, Main water supplies are for washing only. In this country drinking water was not in use till the 19th century, also for flushing too, which cut down the mortality rate by great degrees.<br>  <br>  So what am I saying, in the past alcohol was the better way to die, though a lot of impurities in water are now cleaned up, drinking intoxicants, along with binge drinking have got worse. though in the<br>  long run the choice is yours.<br>  <br>   Damaging one liver is likened to shooting oneself in the foot.<br>  <br>  <br>  Pee - Wee|`|441GSyaMaa	I only drink water, I'm 19, nearly 20... I have the worst diet probably known to man (although recently I've worked out a fair bit) but I'm so skinny and today I did a 1.5 mile run... so yeah, I'd say that it's healthier not to drink....<br>  <br>  Apparently a glass of wine a day is healthy for you though...<br>  <br>  Lysaa I gave you a thumbs down by mistake.... damn laptops :-(|`|vjijiJT3aa	Of course it's healthier to not drink at all, it'll give you a healthier liver too. But drinking recreational is safe there's no bodily harm in having a good time as long as you keep it under control, it's more unhealthy breathing in fumes and second hand smoke so if you worry about health issues you might want to find a big plastic bubble to live in. Have a good time on the weekends i'm sure you deserve it.|`|xUcjzYPdaa	Yes, probably.<br>  <br>  Studies have shown that an occasional glass of red wine is good for you, but I wouldn't have thought it was as good as a completely teetotal lifestyle.<br>  <br>  That said, drinking in moderation won't make you UNhealthy. It's just that not drinking at all will keep you in tip-top condition.|`|L5tWiYOFaa	I'm sure that it'd be infinitely healthier to exist in sterilised pods listening to Phillip Glass all day but how much fun would that be?|`|qky7gWosaa	Alcohol is unhealthy and should be avoided altogether.|`|73Qzi3vVaa	NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!<br>  <br>  You must drink!|`|HUIo1fQaaa	Sure, its healthier on the liver, but it's boring|`|FR4fzr4Zaa	yes deffinitly -x|`|j6MNHoozaa	well,<br>  yeah it is.<br>  <br>  But one glass of red wine every night is excellent for your heart.<br>  <br>  good luck<br>  -xo|`|wfU5fUYIaa	alcohol has been linked to causing cancer in women<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/health/jan-june09/alcohol_02-25.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/heal...</a><br>  <br>  u can live without it... drink juice|`|QmnFlZuYaa	Iknow guys that have had a drink all their lives with no effect.

You can also pick it up from Barnes and Noble for just $7.95 and on Amazon.com for just $7.95! It's filled with 365 great tactics you can apply to your personal finances, from frugal tips to great ideas for managing your money.<br>  <br>  <br>  My wife and I regularly check out cookbooks from our local library to scavenge for new ideas for our cooking repertoire. While most of the time, the recipes are complex and the ingredients expensive, we occasionally check out an interesting one that really hits a frugal sweet spot.<br>  <br>  This week, we checked out Cook Once, Eat Twice because it promised a pile of recipes that you can make in a slow cooker and then reuse the leftovers in another distinct recipe. Generally, we use recipe collections like this one to learn techniques and things that go well together, so we were hoping to learn more about making reusable foods in the crock pot.<br>  <br>  How does it work? The recipes in the book come in pairs, one on the left page and one on the right page when you open it. The one on the left is a slow cooker recipe; the one on the right takes the leftovers from the slow cooker recipe and applies them to another dish.<br>  <br>  For example, Saturday evening we had chicken succotash (basically, a chicken stew with corn and lima beans), then on Sunday evening, we used the remaining succotash to make a chicken and cheese casserole.

TJOHxhEUaa	Lemon curd is a smooth fruit paste used on bread products or as filling for cookies and cakes.  I make my own from my home-grown lemons and this is a really good recipe:<br>  <br>  3 to 4 tablespoons   lemon zest (rind)*<br>  1/2 cup fresh-squeezed lemon juice (4 to 6 lemons)**<br>  1 1/2 cups granulated sugar<br>  6 tablespoons salted butter, cut into pieces<br>  3 eggs, lightly beaten<br>  <br>  * Cold lemons are much easier to grate. Always grate your lemons first, and then juice them.<br>  <br>  ** Do not use the bottled lemon juice - only use fresh-squeezed lemon juice. Room temperature lemons produce more juice. When choosing lemons, look for ones that are firm, plump, and heavy for their size. Always use fresh lemons when making lemon curd.<br>  <br>  Remove the zest (rind) from the limes using a zester or a peeler (be careful to avoid getting any of the white pith). Juice the lemons after removing the zest.<br>  <br>  In a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, combine lemon zest, lemon juice, and sugar. Bring just to a boil; reduce heat to medium-low and simmer 5 minutes. Add butter and stir until it has melted. Remove from heat and cool to room temperature. NOTE: Use a heavy-based, non-reactive saucepan. Stainless steel, anodized aluminum, and enamel all work well. Aluminum or unlined copper pans will react with the acid in the lemons, discoloring the curd and giving it a metallic flavor.<br>  <br>  Beat eggs into cooled lemon mixture until well blended. Return to heat and cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly, 10 to 15 minutes or until mixture thickens and coats spoon. NOTE: Do not let the lemon curd boil, as it can cause the mixture to curdle. Remove from heat. The lemon curd will continue to thicken as it cools.<br>  <br>  Cover by laying a layer of plastic wrap directly on the surface of the curd (this prevents a skin from forming on the surface).<br>  <br>  Store in refrigerator for up to 4 weeks or store in the freezer for one year.|`|WeF9lEtVaa	ok that first answer is sure to be the best <br>  but...from a personal perspective i really dont like lemond curd<br>  its like this sort of lemony, creamy but not really, sort of stuff they put in pastries. I think depending on the recipe that it either lacks flavour or the lemon is too strong, but what really get me is the undecisive texture.|`|f24a4de342b1375dc37e91955d32d1a1aa	It's sort of like a lemon creme jelly.

wXyoo8mNaa	they salted or smoked their meats.|`|CqAeFbexaa	Your right. Meat didn't stay fresh. That's where Christopher Columbus comes in.

My grandmother grew up in San Francisco, and before they had a fridge, they had a little door to the outside where they would store beverages and things - probably not cold enough for meat storage.<br>  <br>  And yes, salted or smoked meats were staples of anyone's diet. Other than that, you wouldn't store meat. You would kill a chicken the same day you cooked it, or if you happened to live near water, you would cook fish the same day it was caught. In many cultures, they didn't really keep meat fresh, they just added lots of spices to cover up the bad taste.

53giV6PFaa	It's good.  Homemade will always be better, but not easier to make.  If you are not an experienced baker or don't trust your baking skills then the box mix is the way to go.  Same goes with the icing.  If you use the canned icing, I like to whip it with my electric mixer before using it.  It makes it much lighter and better.<br>  <br>  Here is a good recipe for homemade cream cheese frosting that is not hard to make at all:<br>  <br>      * 2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened<br>      * 1/2 cup butter, softened<br>      * 2 cups sifted confectioners' sugar<br>      * 1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br>  <br>  In a medium bowl, cream together the cream cheese and butter until creamy. Mix in the vanilla, then gradually stir in the confectioners' sugar. Store in the refrigerator after use.<br>  <br>  ======================================...<br>  Boxed cake mixes are great starters to awesome cake recipes.  Here is one that is absolutely sinful:<br>  <br>  Kahlua  Devil's Food Cake w/Kahlua Chocolate Frosting<br>  <br>  1 package (18.25 ounces) plain devil's food cake mix<br>  2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder<br>  3/4 cup Kahlua<br>  3/4 cup buttermilk<br>  1/2 cup vegetable oil<br>  3 large eggs<br>  <br>  Fluffy Chocolate Kahlua Frosting:<br>  2/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder<br>  6 tablespoons boiling water<br>  2 tablespoons Kahlua<br>  8 tablespoons (1 stick) butter, softened<br>  4 cups confectioners' sugar, sifted<br>  1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br>  <br>  1. Place a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Grease two 9-inch round cake pans with solid vegetable shortening, then dust with flour. Shake out the excess flour. Set the pans aside.<br>  <br>  2. Place the cake mix, cocoa, Kahlua, buttermilk, oil, and eggs in a large mixing bowl. Blend with an electric mixer on low speed for 30 seconds. Stop the machine and scrape down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula. Increase the mixer speed to medium and beat 2 minutes more, scraping down the sides again if needed. The batter should look well combined. Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans, smoothing it out with the rubber spatula. Place the pans in the oven side by side.<br>  <br>  3. Bake the cakes until they spring back when lightly pressed with your finger, 28 to 30 minutes. Remove the pans from the oven and place them on wire racks to cool for 10 minutes. Run a dinner knife around the edge of each layer and invert each onto a rack, then invert again onto another rack so that the cakes are right side up. Allow to cool completely, 30 minutes more.<br>  <br>  4. Meanwhile, prepare the Fluffy Chocolate Kahlua Frosting. Place the cocoa powder in a large mixing bowl and pour in the boiling water and Kahlua. Stir with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula until the cocoa comes together into a soft mass. Add the butter and blend with an electric mixer on low speed until the mixture is soft and well combined, 30 seconds. Stop the machine. Add the confectioners' sugar and cinnamon and beat with the mixer on low speed until the sugar is incorporated, 1 minute. Increase the mixer speed to medium and beat until the frosting lightens and is fluffy, 2 minutes more.<br>  <br>  5. Place one of the layers right side up on a cake plate or stand. Generously and evenly frost the top of the layer. Place the second layer on top, and generously frost the top of the cake creating decorative swirls with the spatula. With the remaining frosting, frost around the sides of the cake using smooth, clean strokes.<br>  <br>  6. Slice, then serve.|`|DjLFiZEwaa	No mix is as good as made from scratch.The cake mix is OK but canned frosting just isn't good at all.It only takes a few minutes to made cream cheese frosting.Well worth the time.|`|U6C4Bywwaa	The cake is pretty good for a box mix nothing extra special but its good.

Add the orange juice. Stir well and turn heat to high - until juice begins to boil. Then turn down to medium.<br>  <br>  Allow to simmer for 10 minutes, or until star fruit has softened enough to easily cut into with a spoon.<br>  <br>   Now and then you can gently move the slices around and turn them over so they all get cooked more or less equally.<br>   Remove any more brown seeds that may loosen and surface.<br>  <br>  While star fruit is cooking, place the mango fruit in a food processor, mini chopper, or blender.<br>   Process or blend until it is smooth and pureed. <br>  Set aside.<br>  <br>  When star fruit is nearly done cooking, adding the sugar/sweetener and stir to dissolve.<br>   Remove pot from heat.<br>  <br>  Add the mango puree, stirring well to incorporate.<br>   Do a taste-test for sweetness, adding more sugar if needed<br>   (how sweet it is will depend on the ripeness of the fruit/juice you're using). <br>  If it happens to be too sweet for your taste, add a squeeze of fresh lime juice, or a little more orange juice.<br>  <br>  When you're happy with the taste, portion out 3 star fruit slices per bowl with even sauce to surround the fruit<br>   (it should still be warm from the pot).<br>  <br>    Then drizzle over some coconut milk and serve!<br>   This dessert is also excellent when given a final topping of whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.

LlXH8yGcaa	I'm new to non-Whiskey drinks and have been trying a  few different beers a day.  More than a few.<br>  Anyway.<br>  The best thing I've tried is Delirium Tremens, a Belgian strong ale.  It is very creamy and smooth, has a malty taste with a hint of apricot, and is just all around pretty great.  It's the one that convinced me beers don't have to taste like ***.  If it wasn't several times the price of everything else and only available in Canada in kegs, I'd drink it like water (when not drinking bourbon like water).<br>  Iron Duke and Tankhouse Ale take the number two spot.  Both are dark ales I think.  Iron Duke is drinkable cold, but better lukewarm.  Tankhouse is kind of flavourless cold, but great lukewarm.  <br>  Scotch Irish Black Irish Plain Porter is a great dark, bitter, coffeeish beer with a great repetitive name.  It's what i was hoping Guiness was going to be like.  <br>  McEwans Scotch Ale is totally different from the others but also really enjoyable.  It's entirely devoid of bitterness, is a bit sweet, and is just incredibly smooth.|`|vjijiJT3aa	Amstel light, woodchuck, blue moon all great tasting beers.|`|DpvXEd3Naa	Newcastle.  It looks dark but is light and tasty|`|mo8YBvC4aa	carlsberg|`|gmQd5p4maa	I was a skeptic at first but Red Stripe is extremely good,It has no weird after taste as does corona and Samuel Adams (maybe that's just me). Red Stripe goes down easy, yet it's not watered down. It isn't too filling. I'd have to say it's my favorite beer. unless I'm just trying to get smashed and party, then I drink natural light and bud ice (cheap beer).|`|vEg5czx7aa	Blue Moon is a good Wheat Ale, also Victory Celebration is a little darker, but good.  Troegs Mad Elf is a seasonal (winter) and is very high in alcohol content, but still quite good.|`|NLgEu3YMaa	I like:<br>  <br>  Grolsch<br>  Carlsberg<br>  Stella Artois<br>  <br>  All lagers which will be available at any store|`|ad2f1e478b1568a1b6605b8884f6613eaa	screw beer get some jack daniels|`|V8GrFx0jaa	You can't like Sam Adams and those other ones at the same time. It's a contradiction. Sam Adams is a great lager, the other stuff sucks. Personally, I love Smithwicks.|`|CGnL2nS0aa	Any beer other than the beers you listed are good.<br>  <br>  LOL<br>  <br>  <br>  Sam Adams is good.<br>  <br>  As a general rule, when it comes to beer, you get what you pay for.

sqPglTDVaa	Pita pizzas are healthier than an ordinary pizza and using the whole wheat pita means it has more fiber too.  Have 1, not too and if your hungry have a green salad with low fat dressing with it.  I like roasted vegies on my pizza; bell pepper, butternut squash and zucchini is nice...(nicer than it sounds too!).|`|KSK22vHUaa	Pita pizzas are healthy, yes.  The calorie count of a piece of pita bread versus the typical butter-and-grease soaked pizza crust is astonishing.  Have two if you want--you're still ingesting fewer calories.  And don't worry about the cheese.  <br>  <br>  Vegetables--mushrooms, olives, onions, bell peppers are typical.  I tend to get creative with pizza and prefer adding pineapple and goat cheese and mandarine oranges. Whatever tastes good to you will taste good.  Artichoke hearts?  Spinach?  Go for it!|`|AA11145131	A pita is the better way to go - and a whole wheat pita is better then that.  <br>  <br>  Try cutting the pita into more pieces, that way it feels like you have more and may take you longer to eat.  <br>  <br>  I know the hungry feeling and I think the other contributer had a good idea of adding more things to it.  Here are some healthy alternatives!<br>  <br>  1 - carmelized onions - dont go all out with the oil - use a nonfat cooking spray like PAM and spray a med. pan.  Slice some onions, I use white cause they are the easiest, add to the pan, and continue to saute over med. heat.  The onions should pick up some color and flavor.  If you need to cool the pan down, add water, broth, or white wine.  If you are looking to cut the most calories, add the water.  <br>  <br>  2 - Cheeses - mozzarella, ricotta, and parmesean are three of the best cheeses for you based upon fat content (saw on Good Eats on the Food Network).  You can but part skim ricotta and mozzarella at most stores.  Sargentto's makes the best ricotta, though more expensive.  <br>  --You could also do a dessert pizza - my dad is a personal trainer and at his gym, they sweeten the ricotta with some honey.  Spoon over pita, add dark chocolate - good fats and good for the brain  - and strawberries.  Add other berries or low fat/low sugar chocolate syrup.<br>  <br>  3 - Veggies - add broccoli, roasted coliflower (preheat oven to 400.  spray pan with nonstick spray.  add coliflower, spray with nonstick spray.  lightly salt.  cook for 20 minutes, stir.  repeat until carmelized), utilize mushrooms such as portabella, prochini, cremini, or button mixed, roasted red peppers.<br>  --Roasting things or cooking them differently, like the onions, coliflower, and things like peppers, richens their taste, brings out natural flavors, and will also make you feel like you are eating better tasting food!<br>  <br>  4 - Hummus, cucuembers, and cilantro<br>  <br>  5 - Spinach, garlic, and mushrooms<br>  <br>  A pizza can be topped with whatever you want it to be topped with.  Just remember to make it healthy, stay away from the fattening little things, like brushing with oil, sprinkling with oil, adding butter, or cooking the foods you are putting on it in these things.  Olive and Canola oil have both recenlty been found to be very beneficial.  However, remember to use these products in moderation.  <br>  <br>  Good luck and good eats!!
gMgh2ypsaa	so long as you steer clear of fatty toppings like loads of cheese and bacon/salami etc it is reasonably healthy.<br>  <br>  I presume you are talking about the small pita, i can only eat one of those and i only have half a big one.  but then i have a small apatite. what about making one eating it then if you are still hungry make another.|`|de72fa747bd877831a656fc97e91fc1baa	pizza and healthy in the same sentence.  not likely.  however, once in awhile isn't going to give you the big one.  you ain't gonna die if you eat a pizza.  now if you did it everyday, i think it would catch up to you after awhile.  put on lots of onions and peppers and whatever other veggie you like and you wont feel all that guilty about eating it.  everything in moderation.|`|6e74c35f74d4a134e3164f5e3fd6bcb8aa	Any vegetables you like-I like onions, banana peppers, pepperoni or bacon.

I don't know what you guys like or what you usually fix so I'm going to wing it with this one.<br>  <br>  BARLEY AND LAMB STEW<br>  <br>  Ingredients<br>  <br>      * 2 pounds boneless lamb shoulder, trimmed of fat and cut into bite-size pieces<br>      * 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt<br>      * 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper<br>      * 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour<br>      * 1 tablespoon olive oil, divided<br>      * 3 medium carrots, cut into 1/4-inch rounds<br>      * 1 cup barley grits<br>      * 4 cups chicken broth<br>      * 2 teaspoons freshly chopped oregano<br>  <br>  Directions<br>  <br>  In a medium mixing bowl, toss the lamb with the salt, pepper and flour.<br>  <br>  Heat 1/2 tablespoon olive oil in a 4 to 5-quart Dutch oven set over medium-high heat until it shimmers. Add half of the lamb, and brown on all sides, approximately 7 to 8 minutes total. Remove the lamb to a bowl and repeat with the remaining oil and lamb. Remove the second batch of lamb to the bowl and add the carrots to the pot. Saute the carrots for 3 to 4 minutes, stirring occasionally. Return all of the lamb to the pot along with the grits and stir to combine. Add the chicken broth and bring to a boil. Once boiling, decrease the heat to low, cover and simmer for 30 to 45 minutes or until the liquid is absorbed and the lamb and grits are tender. Five minutes before the stew is finished, add the oregano. Taste for seasoning and add salt and pepper as desired.<br>  <br>  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br>  <br>  WHOLE WHEAT IRISH SODA BREAD<br>  <br>  <br>  Ingredients<br>  <br>      * 2 cups whole-wheat flour<br>      * 2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting<br>      * 1 teaspoon baking soda<br>      * 1 teaspoon salt<br>      * 2 1/4 cups buttermilk<br>  <br>  Directions<br>  <br>  Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Coat a baking sheet with cooking spray and sprinkle with a little flour.<br>  <br>  Whisk whole-wheat flour, all-purpose flour, baking soda and salt in a large bowl. Make a well in the center and pour in buttermilk. Using one hand, stir in full circles (starting in the center of the bowl working toward the outside of the bowl) until all the flour is incorporated. The dough should be soft but not too wet and sticky. When it all comes together, in a matter of seconds, turn it out onto a well-floured surface. Clean dough off your hand.<br>  <br>  Pat and roll the dough gently with floury hands, just enough to tidy it up and give it a round shape. Flip over and flatten slightly to about 2 inches. Transfer the loaf to the prepared baking sheet. Mark with a deep cross using a serrated knife and prick each of the four quadrants.<br>  <br>  Bake the bread for 20 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 400¬∞ and continue to bake until the loaf is brown on top and sounds hollow when tapped, 30 to 35 minutes more. Transfer the loaf to a wire rack and let cool for about 30 minutes.<br>  <br>  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br>  <br>  ROASTED ROOT VEGETABLES<br>  <br>  Ingredients<br>  <br>      * 2 sweet potatoes (about 1 pound), scrubbed and cut into wedges<br>      * 1 (1-pound) bag baby carrots<br>      * 1 bunch parsnips, peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces<br>      * 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil<br>      * Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br>  <br>  Directions<br>  <br>  Preheat oven to 425 degrees F and position a rack in the center of the oven.<br>  <br>  On a baking sheet, toss the sweet potatoes, carrots, and parsnips with the olive oil and season with the salt and pepper.

I7Ee17s0aa	I'm not a fan of fat-free anything, especially salad dressings!  They substitute sugar or corn syrup solids for the fat and compromise the flavor!  Light versions are usually decent, but I prefer to simply modify how much of the regular stuff I eat.  Ok, so if you're bent on lowfat, here's some considerations:<br>  <br>  1.  Get the packaged Hidden Valley and mix it up yourself using fat free plain yogurt or light mayo.  You can also find the kind that you can mix with buttermilk and light sour cream.<br>  2.  I like making my own vege dips using light sour cream or IMO sour cream substitute.  I use a combination of green onion and regular onion dips or Knorrs Vege Dip.  I have also mixed them with greek yogurt and the outcome is luscious.<br>  3.  Berensteins is one of my favorite salad dressing makers, as is Annes' and Maries.  Also, consider Ken's light dressings.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AA11786341	Whip up a carton of this delcious, fresh-tasting fat-free Ranch Dip, store in your refrigerator for use with fresh veggies, chips, or chicken, then simply mix half-and-half<br>   (more or less, to desired consistency) <br>  with fat-free buttermilk for creamy Ranch Dressing with fresh homemade flavor.<br>   SO EASY! <br>  <br>  Place half a carton of fat-free cottage cheese in your blender. <br>  <br>  Sprinkle the Hidden Valley Ranch Fat-Free Dressing Mix from packet over the cottage cheese. <br>  <br>  Add the rest of the cottage cheese atop the dressing mix. Give a quick stir with a spoon. Turn on the blender and blend until well mixed, stopping occasionally to scrape down sides. <br>  <br>  Serve chilled. You may store this dip (use the cottage cheese container for storage, if desired) for up to two weeks, depending on the expiration date on the cottage cheese container. But don't expect it last that long! <br>  <br>  To make fresh fat-free Ranch Dressing, simply mix about half a cup of the dip with fat-free buttermilk, pouring in a little at a time until you achieve the desired consistency you want (some like it thick, others like it thin). The buttermilk maintains the dressing's tangy flavor, without diluting its taste.|`|IRqccZQeaa	Hmm, I wonder about fat-free.  Fat-free is typically higher in sugar, carbs & calories so it's actually worse.  I like 2 % milk or low fat yogurts but dressings I'd definitely go regular or low-fat but Not fat-free.  Just use less of the regular.  Hidden Valley Ranch, Kraft or generic store brands are good.  :)<br>  It's not good to take all the fat out of your diet.  Remember that some fat is essential for a diet, that's why it's part of the food pyramid.  :)<br>  <br>  BTW, nice hair, and flower!  ha ha

But waistlines in the U.S. are expanding along with exotic drink choices. Calorie intake is up as much as 15 percent in the last 20 years, and about half of the extra calories comes from sweetened drinks. No wonder: A 24-ounce Starbucks Vanilla Bean Frappuccino (without whipped cream) or a 20-ounce Smoothie King Pina Colada Island contains about as many calories as a McDonald‚Äôs Big Mac.<br>  <br>  Energy drinks, fortified juices, exotic teas, and waters often contain other ‚Äúextras‚Äù you don‚Äôt need: high levels of stimulants, vitamins, and minerals, as well as questionable herbal ingredients. For example, a 16-ounce can of Burn2 energy drink contains almost as much caffeine as two cups of coffee, plus herbal stimulants. Syzmo energy drink packs 600 percent of the recommended daily value of vitamin B6 and 1,000 percent of B12--far more than most people require.<br>  <br>  Here‚Äôs how to avoid the pitfalls and choose drinks that won‚Äôt pile on the pounds.<br>  <br>  <br>  Liquid calories go down easy<br>  <br>  Drinks don‚Äôt fill you up the way solid food does. Suppose you have a small caf√© mocha with breakfast (240 calories), a medium soft drink with lunch (210 calories), an 8-ounce energy drink midafternoon (115 calories), and a beer after work (150 calories). Those add about 700 extra calories to your day, and, by the end of the week, an extra pound of weight.<br>  <br>  The main culprit, sugar, lurks in places that might surprise you, such as flavored waters and ready-to-drink teas. Juice drinks and smoothies are among the worst offenders. A 24-ounce Jamba Juice Banana Berry smoothie, for example, has as much sugar as four-and-a-half chocolate bars.<br>  <br>  You should also check the fat content of lattes, frapp√©s, chai teas, smoothies, and other creamy drinks. A 32-ounce Dunkin‚Äô Donuts Vanilla Bean Coolatta packs more than an entire day‚Äôs ration of saturated fat. You can slash the fat and calories in creamy drinks by skipping the whipped cream and substituting nonfat or soy milk for whole milk.<br>  <br>  Alcohol is double trouble for the calorie conscious, since it can boost your appetite. If you imbibe, opt for wine or light beer over mixed drinks, and limit your intake.<br>  <br>  Finally, be aware of portion sizes. Restaurants often use huge cups or glasses. And check the number of servings in bottles and cans. Arizona‚Äôs Asia Plum green tea initially seems like a reasonable choice, with 70 calories per serving. But if you drink the whole bottle, you‚Äôll actually consume two-and-a-half servings--and 175 calories.|`|A4ugEMJ5aa	energy drinks make my urine turn strange neon colors. anything that turns my urine into unnatural colors can not be good for me.

C2jygs9Raa	Well, you didn't eat enough fruit today.  I usually eat my daily serving of fruits during breakfast/ lunch or as a snack.<br>  <br>  I think three servings of fruit should suffice.  You seem to have vegetables covered (Congratulations... that's the hard part).<br>  <br>  You also seem to be receiving an adaquate amount of protein.<br>  <br>  For me, a bowl of cereal isn't enough to keep my stomach from growling during a test, so I would recommend a larger breakfast.  Preferably something with some protein, fruit, and a glass of orange juice.<br>  <br>  Are you using soy milk in your cereal?  If not, I strongly recommend it!  It's fortified just like regular milk and helps supply your body with Vitamin B12 (primarily found in meat).<br>  <br>  If you find yourself rushing in the morning and barely squeezing breakfast into your schedule, I recommend eat Whole Grain Cheerios (I think that's the name, I forgot). It is packed with vitamins (including B12), it's vegan, and it's healthy!!!<br>  <br>  For lunch, are you eating a salad composed of iceburg lettuce?  Or does it have the good stuff in it?  If you purchased it from school, chances are it is made up of iceburg lettuce, which isn't really a vegetable.<br>  <br>  Your snack is good, but again, I would advise eating fruits as a snack as well (but carrots are GREAT).<br>  <br>  Dinner seems fine, as long as it fills you.<br>  <br>  Second snack looks pretty good as well.  If you don't have Whole-Grain Wheat Bread, I strongly suggest purchasing some.  One slice has about 6 grams of protein and it is a bit healthier (and larger).<br>  <br>  Despite my rigorous critiquing, your meal plan for the day looks perfectly fine.  You're doing a great job, and a lot better than most people when they turn vegetarian.<br>  <br>  Keep up the good work and good luck! :)|`|afaAhlbGaa	You've made a great start but I'd recommend dropping the Special K cerea.It is ful of suger and therefore not very healthy. It is also highly processed. I'd replace it with a low suger muesli, and add some dried or fresh berries / fruit and some nuts too, because of your age you require some extra 'good' fats and oils in your diet, nuts and seeds are full of these. Just don't over do them, same for adults especially ;)<br>  <br>  Perhaps replace the pizza with some pita and hummus, jacket potato or cous cous dish etc. <br>  <br>  But its a great start :D|`|eiPUuw0paa	that sound really healthy but i would also put some fruit in there....but otherwise thats great|`|KzglkZPgaa	thats healthy all right!!|`|wtg8vtzBaa	Sounds good, but you might want to consider a more balanced breakfast...with fruit.|`|AA10032971	It sounds as though you made a healthy choice.

Here's a good article on sugar... from Vegetarian Journal <a href="http://www.vrg.org/journal/vj2007issue4/VJ4_2007-Sugar.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.vrg.org/journal/vj2007issue4/...</a><br>  <br>  Vegans do what is practical or possible to avoid the use of animal materials, but some things are not practical or possible.  It's not practical to try to track down whether the bone char in a product you buy is processed with bone char,  and even if you did, the company may not always use the same source of sugar.   Bone char does not end up in the sugar, so you are not eating it.  It's also used in filtering much city tapwater. You cannot avoid that either.   It's used in making  white petroleum jelly too-- Vaseline.   It's a byproduct of slaughter, and creates no new demand for killing animals.  Sugar does not have to be processed that way, and all sugar is not processed that way.  Some countries have outlawed the use of bone char filters for sugar.  <br>  <br>  I do not concern myself with it unless I'm cooking or baking at home.|`|b73296a75da0c37af734e3ef9c03113baa	FYI There is Vegan Organic Cane Sugar available. So you can dissolve the vegan organic cane sugar in plain soy milk and be just fine. <br>  And just so you know: Sugar that doesn't say Vegan isn't. Sugar that doesn't say Vegan isn't even vegetarian -- Regular Granulated Sugar is put through a refining process using charred bone.|`|c4724825852a4a71b71b6d270a87b2a9aa	Yeah, by that theory it would be really hard to be vegan/<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.veganoutreach.org/guide/qa.html#isrefinedsugarvegan" rel="nofollow">http://www.veganoutreach.org/guide/qa.ht...</a>|`|a5eKMASCaa	Sugar is made from sugarcane. Its a type plant. So yeah, vegans can have soymilk that have sugar. <br>  Try Silk Soymilk it shows more info then other brands too.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.

qV8Vz36Iaa	Just eat what is healthy.  You can eat vegan and still eat bad food:<br>  <br>  + Sugar<br>  + Refined Carbs<br>  + Excess vegetable fats beyond a teaspoon a day (contributes to CHD)<br>  <br>  These will play havoc on your health. It's not enough to be vegan. I'd also cut out the food stuff above.<br>  <br>  If you are attempting to be healthy, then I would avoid egg yokes (fat) and all milk products including cheese. Dairy has unhealthy protein, fats, genetically modified boving growth hormones, and other contaminants.<br>  <br>  The scientific reseach is clear, a low-fat vegan diet is very healthy. Aerobic exercise is also very important. (If you are healthy and fit, you should build up to about an hour of aerobic exercise 5 times per week.)<br>  <br>  My take is health, not animal protection. I'll wear leather, but I will rarely eat meat, drink milk, or consume cheese or other dairy products. I wouldn't give up cow hides, just so that I can call myself a vegan or some other convenient label.|`|R5LuKSUXaa	vegans basically don't consume or wear anything that comes from an animal.<br>  <br>  edit: here are some websites ... <a href="http://www.thisoldhippie.com/vegetarian/index.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.thisoldhippie.com/vegetarian/...</a><br>  <a href="http://brucefriedrich.org/Vegan_Vs_Vegetarian.html" rel="nofollow">http://brucefriedrich.org/Vegan_Vs_Veget...</a>|`|2g5W67Ueaa	You could be a vegan and not consume ANY animal products. that would be any dairy or meat.<br>  <br>  If you are a strict vegan you would also wear no animal products or use them. like wool or leather for example.<br>  <br>  It is up to you where you want to draw the line. i would call myslef vegan if i cut dairy and meat out of my diet.<br>  <br>  hope i helped <3.<br>  <br>  good luck :)|`|lcuxD3qlaa	You are absolutely right that Vegans do not wear anything that is from animals...<br>  I consider myself a Vegan/Vegatrian (read my about me)<br>  I say this because I also do not eat eggs nor do I drink milk. BUT, I will eat goat products-but I haven't had any goat products in a long time and its very very rare for me (This restaurant had goat cheese salad that I wanted to try one night on vday last year w/ my boy toy!)<br>  Anyway, So yeah your like me where we dont eat dairy but like if someone were to like buy us clothes from animal farming-wool leather, we'd definitely wear it w/ no problem. I have tons of leather items in my closet so..I'm no Vegan, SOOO  I think of myself as half Vegan half Vegetrian! :)<br>  If you need to know anything more about Vegan and VeggiePeople visit this site-k?<br>  Also if you need to know like what to eat, like more fun foods for us..let me know-ill be more than happy to help ya out!|`|hqjuw56Faa	If your a vegan you can't eat quorn products and you have to take vitamin tablets, but you can't take certain tablets because they have animal bone in them. You can't use most fine china, paint brushes and you can't wear wool or leather. I'm also a vegetarian thinking of going vegan :]|`|8nigkuTTaa	Good for you for doing the vegetarian thing!!<br>  <br>  I'm a vegan and the difference is that we believe that animals should not be used for profit or personal gain.  They cannot reap the benefits, and don't speak a language (that we understand) so we don't know what they want or think, but it certainly is NOT to be cooped up and treated poorly.  <br>  That's just exploitation.  There are the obvious things, such as meat, leather, wool, and any food product with animal products or by-products in them.  but there are less obvious ones like silk, honey and a lot of soaps.  The goal is not self- purity (so, when I became vegan, I didn't throw out my wool pea-coat, I gave it to a non-vegan, because it would have been wasteful to throw it out), but to protest the mistreatment of animals, to educate people on the subject, and to show marketers that animal products are not needed and wanted.   Being a vegan in itself is strict, and I don't think that anyone who is a consumer/ supporter of animal products can be called vegan.<br>  <br>  Vegetarians still consume many by-products of animals, even if they are strict and eat veganly.  That doesn't mean they are vegan.  They are strict Vegetarians.  Most vegetarians (Even the strict ones) still have wool rugs, silk scarves, and use any soaps (made out of animal fat. . . gross. . . how clean can THAT be?)<br>  <br>  I don't want to be mean, but vegetarianism, although it DOES help the cause a lot, is not done for the same reasons veganism is.  Any reason is a good one, though. Even if it is for the animals, not eating animals is only the tip of the iceberg!   <br>  <br>  Personally, I focus on educating people about it.  If they learn about it, and still choose to eat meat, they usually leave at least a little more thoughtful.  Every pair of leather shoes NOT bought, is another animal NOT killed, and one less consumer!<br>  <br>  Anyway, like I said: good for you, because even the little efforts are big ones and save an animal some harm!  Hope this helped!|`|MWuSbFaFaa	vegans don't eat ANY animal products such as :eggs, milk, cheese, ect...along with all meats, red , white, and aven fish...they pretty much only eat vegatables, fruits, grains....origanic....<br>  <br>  vegetarians don't eat meat, but some eat fish too, and others just don't eat red meat and some dairy products too.<br>  <br>  hope that helps:)

QWY0P98Haa	I would NOT hack at a frozen pack of hamburger with a knife...an old co-worker of mine cut off part of her hand that way. She is now missing her fore finger and her thumb.<br>  <br>   I would, however just thaw the whole thing out, get out the pound you need, brown the rest of it, portion it out into freezer bags, and freeze it for later use in pasta sauce, chili and future hamburger helper dishes. Once it is cooked it can be safely re-frozen and is very convenient for future meals.|`|KSK22vHUaa	Get a big sturdy bread (or otherwise serrated) knife and hack yourself off a fifth of the roll.<br>  <br>  Don't thaw the whole thing.

ttfuh5pKaa	Hi -<br>  <br>  How about making Empanadas?  I have attached the following and I hope it works out for you.  I remember doing this for my daughter too!<br>  <br>  Empanadas are little hand-pies, filled with beef as should every good Argentine meal. There are recipes for vegetable filled empanadas, so if it happens to be around the Lenten season, the pre-dominantly Catholic Argentines can still eat their empanadas.<br>  In Argentina empanadas are such a popular food, you can find the pre-made shells in most markets. You can also find ready-made empanadas in most small food shops. Empanadas can be fried or baked. I prefer to bake them, as they are less greasy.<br>  It may surprise you to know that Argentine foods are made with very few herbs and spices, and it can be somewhat bland. They predominantly use salt, pepper, garlic, oregano, basil, nutmeg, cinnamon and ground pimento. This is where the "a la Yanqui" comes in to play, since I like to spice these little pies up with some chili powder, cumin and crushed red pepper. Not too much, mind you, since I want them to be as close to the original empanada as possible. I have successfully served my version of the empanada to my Argentine friends, and they have all been pleased. So now to the recipe....<br>  <br>  EMPANADAS ARGENTINAS A LA YANQUI<br>  <br>  Dough: <br>  <br>  Use pre-made pie crust, the kind found in the refrigerated case. I prefer the "name brand" over the "store brand" since it has better flavor and is more flaky. Warm the dough to slightly cooler than room temperature and roll it out on a floured surface. Using a small dessert plate as a guide, cut out 12 rounds of 5-6 inches in diameter. Place these rounds in the refrigerator until the filling is prepared.<br>  <br>  Beef Filling:<br>  <br>  1 LB. Lean Ground Beef<br>  1 Lg. Yellow Onion, diced<br>  3 Hard-boiled Eggs, coarsely chopped<br>  20 Pimento-stuffed Green Olives, quartered<br>  1 Lg. Roma type Tomato, chopped <br>  (use Roma as they are a meatier tomato and not so "juicy" wet)<br>  3 Lg. Cloves Garlic, minced<br>  1 Tsp. Each of Salt, Cumin, Chili Powder, and Oregano<br>  1/2 Tsp. Each of Crushed Red Pepper and White Pepper<br>  1 Tsp. of Pimenton Dulce (use Paprika if you cannot find this spice)<br>  <br>  Saute the onion and garlic in a small amount of olive oil, add the ground beef and stir until it is cooked. If it appears to have a lot of watery juice, drain most of it away. Add the tomato and the spices, stirring until the tomato has cooked down to nothing. Remove from the heat and add the olives and hard-boiled eggs. The mixture must be cooled down, but stirred often to distribute the spices and juices. If you feel safer you can refrigerate the mixture and stir it every five minutes until it is just warm to the touch. <br>  <br>  Take a spoonful of the mixture and place it in the middle of one of the rounds. Dampen the edges of the crust with water and pull the edges of the crust together over the meat filling, crimping them together. You may crimp them and twist them with your fingers or use a fork to crimp them together. Do not over fill, as you do not want them to explode while baking. The dough should easily fit around the amount of filling placed inside. Do this until all the rounds are filled. Pre-heat your oven to 400 degrees. Place the empanadas on a cookie sheet. Make an egg-wash by beating an egg with a tsp. of water and brush the tops of the empanadas with this egg-wash. Bake the empanadas approximately 20 minutes, or until golden brown.<br>  <br>  Eat them as soon as you can stand to get them to your mouth.

Sprinkle with black pepper and salt.   Then pour enough milk around the Salmon, like say 1/2 inch. around the fish.   Place a tin foil over the top and bake at 350 degrees for 15 minutes.

wLgGD63raa	1. Nothing really, except, you don't have to cook them yourself, so it takes a lot of time off of your part. Also, they -will- expand during cooking, so don't try to over stuff your pan if you decide to go with the already cooked noodles.<br>  <br>  2. Ricotta and cottage cheese are two completely different flavors. You can definitely substitute one for the other, but it probably won't taste as good if you use cottage cheese. But then again, it's all personal tastes and preferences. <br>  <br>  I recommend using the already cooked noodles, as it saves a lot of time for you. I also recommend using the ricotta cheese, because it tastes better (in my opinion).|`|hKlsJgVSaa	When it comes to the noodles, I don't notice any difference in taste but if you want to do the no-boil then make sure the box says "no-boil". No boil just takes one step out and makes it a bit easier and quicker.<br>  <br>  I like ricotta better out of the 2. I have however used cottage cheese before and it was okay.|`|MhfneF0xaa	There are some "pre-cooked" noodles that don't have to be boiled. Don't confuse these with uncooked *regular* noodles. I tried the pre-cooked noodles once and while the tast was OK, they shrank quite a bit in the pan.<br>  <br>  Ricotta cheese is better here than cottage cheese. Most recipes call for the ricotta to be mixed with one or more other cheeses, usually Parmesan. Be generous with the cheese mixture, make a little more than the recipe calls for.<br>  <br>  I like to use bulk Italian sausage instead of ground beef.<br>  <br>  Be prepared for a little frustration spreading the cheese mixture into an even layer, that's really the toughest part of assembly.|`|F3ppjOwlaa	There are two types of noodles used for lasagna- one can be laid as is in the dish, covered with sauce and toppings, then baked. I don't use this type because it doesn't taste as good as boiled noodles and each sheet is very thin. The other (traditional) lasagna noodle is first boiled, rinsed, placed in a baking dish in layers with sauce, and then baked. I rinse this type of noodle and then lay the individual noodles in cold water to keep them from sticking together. This gives me time to lay out my other ingredients and prepare my dish.<br>    Ricotta cheese is the traditional cheese used in between the noodle layers. It is smoother and has more taste than cottage cheese. However, when ricotta cheese is not available, cottage cheese is acceptable as a substitute.  Bear in mind that the cottage cheese will make the finished dish more watery because it is not as dry as ricotta <br>  cheese.|`|6rJJnRofaa	Already cooked noodles that you have to reheat come out more...........gushy? or dougy<br>  ricotta is mostly used for pasta, cottage cheese is mainly for desserts because its.............desert friendly?|`|s9Uufsr0aa	uncooked noodles take a bit longer to cook & need to have more liquid in the tomato sauce<br>  cottage cheese oozes more (unless you use just the curds), has a more subtle flavour, & comes in low & non fat|`|Nzgp6Wcnaa	put the lasagne sheets in some warm water before you use them, I found they tend to cook better if you do that, also double layer the pasta with cheese sauce in between, it's really yummy.<br>  Don't worry you'll find your own way of making it that will make everyone ask 'what's your secret?'

Unless you are homesteading and growing, raising, or foraging all of your own food, taking water from your own supply (well, stream, lake, cistern, etc.), and otherwise providing your own sustenance - then you have a substantial disconnect from your food and water supply as well.  How do we all look down here from the saddle on your high horse?|`|MbSSIOpSaa	People have been brainwashed into thinking that milk and cheese are nutritious. When people find out I'm vegan they genuinely don't understand where else I can get calcium! I also think it has to do with the disconnect that you describe. If people actually had to milk a cow or knew about the pus, hormones, and bacteria that's found in milk and cheese then most of them wouldn't eat it. Lastly, I think there's actually an addictive property...it's important that the calf keeps coming back for more breast milk or it won't grow and reproduce.

I'm sure you'll see more and better non-dairy cheeses in the future as there's not only a vegan demand for these products, but also many people who cannot eat dairy products for health reasons.   <br>  <br>  Gelatin is not vegetarian or vegan.  It's made by boiling the bones, skin, and connective tissue of animals.|`|mfXDUkRYaa	You get can 100% durum wheat pasta. I find most of the dried pasta is vegan.<br>  <br>  There are cheese substitutes out there - Scheeze, Cheezly, and probably lots more.<br>  <br>  Gelatin is made from cow's or pig's bones/hooves/ligaments, so no.<br>  <br>  Make sure you eat lots of different coloured fruit and veg, including dark green leafy veg.|`|kAfZaLwraa	I don't know what Jewel is. :-)<br>  <br>  Pasta can be vegan. Most fresh pastas are NOT. Read labels and ask in stores.<br>  <br>  Nutritional yeast is said to taste a bit like Parmesan cheese. There are some vegan "cheeses" as well, but I don't think they taste much like cheese, and very few will melt. ALWAYS read labels. Just being made of soy or rice milk rather than dairy milk is NOT an indicator of being vegan. (Many of the faux cheeses use milk proteins for texture.)<br>  <br>  Gelatin is not vegetarian. It's made from animal collagen, which comes from the skin, bones, and hooves. You can get vegetarian "gelatins" that are made from seaweed or make your own using agar. (Note: despite what some people might tell you, Kosher gelatin is not always vegetarian. It can be made of fish bones.)|`|c4058327d20f41accfd1c3c424c72f6faa	> Is pasta vegan?<br>  Read the ingredients.<br>  Some is, some isn't.<br>  Some is, but contains all sorts of other bad stuff for ya.<br>  <br>  > Is there anything that tastes like cheese thats vegan?<br>  A little bit like cheese.

But you can use so many other things such as konyaku, agar, ... even acorn powder all make 'Jello'.<br>  <br>  > Oh I'm also 15 so nutrition is really important<br>  Just a varied whole foods diet will do for starters.<br>  Make sure you get consuming good fats/oils, nutritional yeast, avoid things such as antibiotics, white vinegar, processed salt/sugar/etc.  ... well, read the book Becoming Vegetarian or Becoming Vegan for more tips.|`|FlVLN3Ehaa	The best thing for you to help your mum with the shopping.

Good Luck|`|iDCGgEYxaa	I wish the would have listed the weight of the flour(It's in cups and a cup of something doesn't weight the same as cup of another thing.)   because then it would be easy to just do bakers percentages and reduce the recipe to whatever yield you wanted. But then again I'm not sure if you have a bakers scale.|`|r3ke7uonaa	This is the easiest way I can think of.  I'm hoping you mean you want to half the recipe since the whole makes too much.  Anyway, 4 C plus 1 T...I would just do 2 C and a half T.  I'm pretty sure they have conversion charts online to tell you what half of a tablespoon is, but I'm just answering as if I were making the recipe now.  Half of 3/4 would be a 1/4 and a 1/2 (if that makes sense) which means a 1/4 cup plus 1/8 cup.  A half of a half is a quarter and as for the one beaten egg for the egg wash, I wouldn't worry about halfing that since it's just an egg wash and you can use as much or as little as you want.  I hope this helps!|`|hKlsJgVSaa	No by the way 12 cups of butter is 3 pounds of butter.

Tuna, swordfish, etc. have high levels of mercury (because they eat other fish who eat other fish who eat sea plants that contain mercury).  I'm not sure what the symptoms are from having too much mercury from eating tuna.  Definitely limit it to 2 days a week, to get the omega-3 benefit but not the bad effects of mercury.  Smaller fish have lesser concentration of mercury, fyi.|`|ILpp3ncYaa	Mercury is the only thing you need to worry about.|`|i6tyscumaa	hmm, fish is really good for you, but eating too much of anything isn't healthy.

K4zsztkRaa	The first one 50-75ish.<br>  I actually don't know how much cakes are sapposed to cost but usually the rule of thub when first starting out with something is find out what your compeditors prices are and try to beat that.

Good job by they way.<br>  <br>  Are those moslty with out fondant? I thought I saw some tierd ones with out the fondant. If so then good for you. I hate that stuff and I would never waste my time decorating that stuff just to have people peel it off and put it in the trash. <br>  <br>  It always looks so good, but I would be heartbbroken to see people throw my hard work in the trash.|`|4d80afe3510fcec9f8c8cce72cafd379aa	You're pretty good so you can charge the same amount as most bakeries.  That means anywhere from $2.50-$7.00 per serving, depending on your area.  Call around and find out the average price in your area.  You should be charging per serving, not per cake.  You can look up the proper serving sizes online to make sure you know how many people a given cake will feed.<br>  <br>  One thing you might want to look into is making sure it's legal for you to sell cakes.  In most states you need some sort of approval to sell cakes, whether it's from your home or in a professional kitchen.  If you aren't legal and you get caught you can get in a lot of trouble.|`|EMfLFsXEaa	Oh your cakes are gorgeous. They're so fun and playful, I especially love the castle cake. I think it looks like you put a lot of labour and money into these cakes, so I'm guessing they should cost about $100.00.

Your cakes look great and can be tailored to so many clients!!<br>  <br>  Remember, you could always price by type - fondant vs. buttercream vs. ? and price by layer - maybe someone wants a cake you have listed in a single layer or in three layers - you could have all the prices there so that the person would order it.  If the person has to call or double check it may lessen the chance of a sale.   Having sample numbers or pricing can really allow someone to say - OK I can afford another layer - or - well, I would rather have a smaller, more decorative cake.  <br>  <br>  It is great what you are doing!!|`|9u1Wn7WZaa	Besides the fact that your really good  i would say u could sell large ones for 750 in up medium ones for 500 -750 and 250-500 for smaller ones

QWY0P98Haa	Ivan, I posted an answer to this exact same question in another thread. I am American, and live in Holland. I agree with you about the teenagers here. They are much more responsible about drinking and driving and the rate of alcohol related auto incidents are way lower here. Some think that comparing Holland to USA is like comparing apples and oranges. I say the States could learn a thing from Holland about lessons in responsibility to the younger generation. It won't work in the states...they are just too closed minded. Yes, I think a lower drinking age would be nice, but along with that comes responsibility.<br>  <br>  and yes think it is ridiculous that at 18 you can go straight from boot camp to Irac (seen it happen, some of those boys don't get to go home first after training) and cant be considered responsible enough to buy a beer.<br>  <br>  Groetjes! en bedankt dat je dit op deze manier vroeg.|`|pOufymEJaa	yea|`|IbuW1fT7aa	I feel like it might be a good idea to lower the drinking age in the US because, due to the high age limit, people act like it's a super big deal to start drinking, resulting in getting drunk, acting immature about it, etc. Alcohol shouldn't be such a huge deal. If the law didn't make it seem so exclusive [for the younger public], it wouldn't seem so special, and less people would probably overindulge on it. <br>  I've got a friend who's currently in Italy [has a lower drinking age], and he observes that alcohol is just an everyday occurrence, so people don't abuse it. It's not a shameful or frowned upon drink, and younger people get used to having it around. They tend to get drunk less often, knowing that alcohol is just part of their lives, and they don't make immature decisions to drink too much all of a sudden.|`|98db9265e124fe3bdd587062c20209e2aa	According to statistics 1 in 13 people in the USA are alcoholics, dropping the drinking age won't help things. As you know the culture is different in Holland and that is why they don't have a problem.<br>  <br>  If anything I believe stronger controls should be in place, I may be a bit biased because I was an alcoholic for 25 years, but the media glamorizing alcohol only serves to create young binge drinkers and alcoholic.<br>  <br>  Just my two cents worth. :)|`|XYGmSsOqaa	yea!! <br>  it definitly should be  lowered!|`|QB5muDR2aa	yea cuz if im old enough to go to prison i should be able drink.. just sayin

TJOHxhEUaa	There are lots of "fake meat" products available from Morningstar Farms and Boca if you crave a burger or some buffalo wings.  Also, lots of "cold cuts" like salami and bologna made by Yves and Lightlife.  Quorn products are pretty good if you want a fake chicken or turkey meal.  All of these should be right there in your large supermarket in the frozen section or the product aisle.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|VdbhuUYBaa	The entire produce section, beans and nuts, eggs and dairy. Produce and dry beans are some of the cheapest items in the store and are veger staples. It's best to stay away from already prepared foods if you're interested in your own health, whether a veger or not.<br>  <br>  Soy milk and dairy milk both have their supposed "issues". It's difficult to discern fact from fiction with food industry research because it's based on studies, and studies are inherently flawed. Studies are funded by food industry lobbyists who control the outcomes before the study even begins.|`|KSK22vHUaa	If you're vegetarian but still allow regular milk, I recommend regular milk.  It has more calcium and is easier to digest, but you might prefer vanilla soy milk--it does taste different.<br>  <br>  Get some dry beans and fresh produce.  When I was vegetarian (which ended a couple of years ago, but lasted quite a few years), I ate lots of peanut butter and fruit (pineapple and apple were best with peanut butter) sandwiches, yogurt, cheeses, pastas, lots of beans and rice, lots of vegetable and pineapple pizzas.  I also ate eggs for protein. <br>  <br>  There's really no need to go to health food stores unless you want to go organic or need some specialty items like tahini (it's a sesame seed paste I put in hummus, a chickpea paste good with tortilla chips).  <br>  <br>  Honestly, you can substitute beans for meat in just about every recipe.  Bean tacos are excellent.  So is bean-chili.  So is beans cooked with potatoes and carrots in a big roast pan!  <br>  <br>  There are also plenty of meals that are just as good without meat.  Fettucini alfredo doesn't need shrimp to be excellent!<br>  <br>  Make a menu before you go.  Think of seven dinners you would enjoy.  Then make your list and go shopping.  This will help keep you from getting 123 things that don't go together at all.<br>  <br>  And one of my favorite vegetarian finds that I still love today: spinach nuggets!  Most grocery stores sell them and I've even seen them at Walmart.  They're usually in the produce department, right up there with the lettuces.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|DLD5Z1Chaa	Morningstar products are amazing :D

y2pErbI2aa	If you think you should drink less, then drink less. Don't use the possibility of alcoholism as a crutch. And if you do end up having alcoholism, there are treatments for that as well.<br>  <br>  Also, just because you exhibit one sign of alcoholism doesn't automatically make you an alcoholic. So go ahead, start cutting back|`|rsTB7D1zaa	You either are or are not an alcoholic.  It appears you drink too much.  One doesn't imply the other, they're separate things.  For example, you can drink a 6 pack a night and hold a job, keep a wife and mortgage.  If your life isn't affected by your drinking then you are not an alcoholic.  But at 6 beers a night you drink too much and it isn't healthy.  This is why you cut back -- for your health.  <br>  <br>  So, do that.  Stop drinking so darn much because you are worried about your health, not because you might be an alcoholic.  Then you don't have to worry about this.<br>  <br>  Whatever you do, continuing to drink as much as you have been only proves you are an alcoholic -- since you cannot go without the booze.  Catch 22 avoided.|`|3zxVzPBxaa	what are you talking about?<br>  <br>  if you think you drink too much, stop drinking. If you can't do that, get help.

I7Ee17s0aa	Interesting question and not one I'm thinking is easily answered here in this forum.  If you are looking at a fortified cake mix, wherein the ingrediants have added vitamins, then the Nutritional Information on the side should indicate what, if any, levels of available vitamins are in each serving.  Vitamin C is tricky, though, and my limited under-standing is that it breaks down fairly quickly.  Also, Vitamin C isn't prevalent in baked goods.|`|XHnpraaxaa	Why would you be worrying about the vitamin c in cake?  Cake is garbage food and not something healthy in any way or form.

S08uUTbbaa	Who will serve the liquor?  Does your state require security to be present if you are serving alcohol to more than a certain number of people (many states require this).  <br>  <br>  My suggestion would be to hire a bar-tender (or 2 for so many people) with wedding experience and ask him for suggestions.<br>  <br>  At my wedding we paid $500 US for liquor for about 100 people, 20% didn't drink, and we had a little left over.  I would suggest budgeting at least $800-1000 for alcohol (if you don't get top-shelf) and another $200 at least for a bartender for a few hours (you might could get away w/ less in this economy, considering he will get tips too).

Q4oPyclQaa	You're making bread?  So you take the damp towel and the purpose of it is just to stop drafts from getting to the dough, and the towel is damp so the dough won't dry out and make a crust on top as it rises.  So it doesn't matter if it touches or not - it shouldn't really touch, but if it does, that's fine.<br>  <br>  Fully covered in melted butter means basically pour a little butter in the bottom of the bowl (maybe a tablespoon), then put the ball of dough on top of it, swirl it around, and flip it over.  That will be about the right amount.  You just want to coat it so there's an outer layer of oil.  Again, that helps to stop the dough from drying out while it rises.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps. :)|`|5a1a6abd8392c910af53b5981180c9ecaa	I really wouldn't use a damp towel.  If you do, make sure it is not a terry cloth type towel.

When it rises to just above the bread pan, it will, of course touch the plastic, which is why you don't want a terrycloth.  Plastic wrap works well and throw away when finished.  Use only about a teaspoon of butter or oil in the bowl, swish the dough around and turn it upside down so that the whole dough has been lightly oiled/buttered.  I assume you are talking about the first rising?  Usually after baking the bread, you will lightly butter the tops of the loaves--if you so desire.<br>  <br>  I happen to have my two wonderful loaves in the oven as I type!  Can hardly wait for fresh hot bread tonight!<br>  <br>  Happy Baking!|`|ylJoUuMDaa	Just throw a tea towel over it, damp isn't necessary.  What you want to do is just keep out any drafts.  The butter isn't necessary either but if you want to add it, just melt a bit in a cup and brush it on with a pastry brush, lightly.  Good luck.
AA11786341	it will take longer to cook if you put it in frozen, but,yes you can do it|`|KSK22vHUaa	It would really be better to thaw the bird first.  If you put it in frozen, a majority of the meat will be at what's considered a dangerous temperature for way too long.  You wouldn't want to leave a bird sitting on the counter at room temperature all day?  That's kind of how the meat inside will be before it gets heated up properly.  It'll give bacteria too much time to turn the meat bad.<br>  <br>  I'm not saying that it WILL make you sick, but unless you're just feeding yourself I wouldn't want to risk anyone else's health.
lH6iMg5Jaa	you can use 1/4 C of banana mashed up.|`|zAhBlMQLaa	Actually there's no best substitute for eggs. Eggs perform a various range of usage depending upon the kind of recipe you are cooking and if you were going to substitute, it will affect the overall taste of that dish.  But if there's some instances that calls for you to substitute I would rather suggest that bananas would be better.|`|gtAb94d2aa	Well usually one egg as opposed to two is fine.

gmrYDpPVaa	1.  Fruits.  Easy.  Things that are easy to keep will be best:  Apples, oranges, bananas, etc. -- try to pick a few things that can be kept outside the cooler, to give you plenty of space for chilled things.<br>  <br>  2.  Vegetables.  Also easy.  Celery sticks -- good with peanut butter -- carrots, etc., should keep well and are a staple as snacks and as side dishes.<br>  <br>  3.  Main staples -- this depends on your personal preference.  Staples would be breads, peanut butter, perhaps vegan cheese if you like it.  Crackers, spreads.  Anything you like on sandwiches is a must -- it's easy, and you can eat it while on the road without much hassle.  Also keep in mind veggie warps -- tortillas topped with your favorite salad foods, and perhaps dressing if you like it.  Trail mix is great.  <br>  <br>  4.  Drinks.  You'll need them, clearly.  Varied juicies -- I recommend V8, it really IS good -- are a must.  If you drink sodas, go ahead and bring a few, but I suggest making things as healthy as possible.  Bring a lot of bottled water, or a jug of your own water and a water bottle, because rest stops and gas stations aren't always the best places to drink from.  If you drink soy milk or almond milk, bring some.  <br>  <br>  5.  Sweets.  Bring a few pick-me-ups for when the road gets tiring.  It doesn't have to be dessert-type foods -- anything sweet, such as dried sweetened fruits, or trail mix that you really like.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Take anything you like to eat at home, and make it travel-able.  If you have a favorite dish, make it a little less messy, and package it in travel containers.  Whatever you'd eat as a snack, take along with you.  One thing I'd recommend is popcorn -- easy snack, and you can easily stick a cup of it in the drink holder and snack as you drive without much distraction.  Make it before you leave, and bag it, or buy it pre-popped.  <br>  <br>  Remember things like utinsels, napkins, a couple of towels for spills, etc.  Also, don't forget a bag to put trash in -- with fresh fruits and vegetables that may have peels, you might end up with a decent amount of it.  <br>  <br>  Bring your own salad bar -- plastic containers with salad ingredients, that you can mix and eat whenever you stop to rest.  Do the same with fruits.|`|RxhBUkwSaa	Aside from the obvious assortment of fresh fruit, or a big fruit salad cut up and in the cooler, peanut butter and jam has always been a family staple for road trips.  Get some great bread, and good quality pb & j, and enjoy! <br>  <br>  Another good vegan treat is onigiri, Japanese rice balls.  They keep well, and are easy to make ahead and you eat them at room temperature.  <br>  Youtube has many videos showing how to make them.  You can put Japanese pickled plums inside (sounds weird, but delicious) available in any good Asian market, or just use rice seasoning.  Usually I leave some bare, and wrap some in Nori.  Delicious!|`|DLlSX7qdaa	im not a vegetarian personally but my mommy is she eats<br>  plenty of fruits ~> grapes carrots corn apples oranges<br>  veggies ~> lettuce salad potato salad<br>  <personally i would bring alot of weed><br>  hope it helps<br>  sorry if it doesn't<br>  <br>  p.s. this website has good food<br>  www.veggieorgasm.com/|`|e4ecc6ecde0e449c7b00bc9bd8ce1f8daa	carrot sticks and celery<br>  <br>  Bottled water<br>  <br>  PB and J sandwhiches<br>  <br>  Apples and oranges and bananas...<br>  <br>  consider that it could take a week to go cross country.  you will need to refuel at some point.|`|YvJdkSNaaa	TOFU JERKY!!!!<br>  Marinate tofu strips in 1/4 cup soy sauce, 3/4 cup water, and spices of your choice overnight, then dehydrate it.|`|KRRYMQwLaa	bread, peanut butter, chips. .. just remmeber not to bring anything that can spoil or go bad!|`|kVDGsDuZaa	Coconut water is very healthy, and delicious!!

Trail mix can supply nuts for protein. <br>  <br>  Bring a big bag of apples, a few gallons of water, trail mix, but for the first leg just bring what you normally eat.<br>  <br>  Are you in the U.S.? If you are I don't think you're going to find any farmer's markets considering it's winter. If you're way south you might find some limited variety.|`|aZoCKGciaa	You already have plenty of good, healthy suggestions but I thought I would offer one more tasty item. Hummus! Its good for you and tastes great with so many things. Its good as a spread on crackers, sandwiches, and wraps, and also as a dip for veggies. Its really easy to make your own or you can find it at the store. Its one of my favorite.|`|MpzPfzivaa	Bring lots of nuts and dried fruits. That helps fill your belly and it is easy to cart in a car. I love eating dates and dried apricots on a trip, but that's me. Also the fruit leathers are really good too.|`|nvH62xo5aa	premade salads|`|zJi5Cjpiaa	soy milk and orange juice in a cooler, corn chips, dried fruit.|`|f0423c049434af188b8aae9a68343013aa	If you like nuts, look into Mrs. May's snacks. She makes some awesome items - like cashew crunch, almond crunch and my all-time fave: blueberry/cranberry snacks. They are way filling and don't take up much space. <br>  <br>  Also bring some fruit - oranges, apples, pears. Those don't need refrigeration. Bananas might also work well if you eat them in plenty of time. <br>  <br>  Have you ever had vegan pate? Oh my- it's soooo good. It's almost like hummus, but it comes in a can and doesn't need to be refrigerated. You can pack that and some yummy whole-grain crackers. <br>  <br>  You could also pack some cereal bars (like Kashi) and since you are bringing a cooler, you might also want to bring some milk (whatever kind you drink - rice, hemp, etc.). <br>  <br>  Have fun and be safe!|`|c4058327d20f41accfd1c3c424c72f6faa	Well, I've only been on one road trip and I packed a cooler full of the essentials -- stuff we eat on a daily basis.  Granola and self stable soy milk (or instant add-water soymilk powder) is easy.  I just pack the same way I would for camping and take along my gas stove too.  We found that finding healthy food along the way is SO much easier than it used to be -- it's a huge trend and organic vegan food is pretty much everywhere now.  We also stopped at lots of farms along the way too, so don't worry too much about being able to find more when you run out.|`|nyP3Yk8haa	salads, crackers, chips, sandwiches, lunchables pizza, fruits...|`|AAgX0SDcaa	fruit, crackers, salad, carrot and celery sticks. and some fruit juices|`|i2cZDC81aa	small fruits and cut up veggies are always easy to bag and carry.

6SqxGQsqaa	i honestly think decorations arent that important when it comes to a house party for friends. just a huge banner that says well miss you is enough.  decorations are mainly for theme parties, and i dont think you have a theme. anyways. you guys are 15 and are in high school. if you have a big back yard, then set a section off where ppl can dance! you gotta have music at the party.  make sure someone with a camcorder records this for the memories and just have fun. activities are for kiddies, and now that your freshman you guys just gotta learn how to party.  rent some lights at a party supply store and dance. be sure there are plenty of chairs for ppl to sit down, and make sure there are plenty of snacks and drinks. good luck.

4REeX6lbaa	sleepovers are a blast!!! invite your friends over around 6, have pizza and soda.

Have everyone bring their ipods and have speakers so you can blast music and dance.

CdYgP1pyaa	Botanically, the fruit is the mature ovary of a plant.  The ovary is the female reproductive part of a flower and may or may not be fertilized before growing into a fruit.  Sometimes different specific parts of the flower swell to produce the fruit, and sometimes what we think are fruits are not--the strawberry that we eat is a swollen flower receptacle and the fruit are what we usually call the seeds on the outside. All flowering plants have fruit, and the tomato is the fruit of the tomato plant.<br>  <br>  However, a tomato is both a vegetable and a fruit.  The term vegetable is a culinary/nutritional term and only tells us how the foodstuff is usually eaten or the kind of nutritional value it has.  Usually, we call something a fruit because it is sugary or sweet or can be eaten as a dessert.  This isn't really the case with tomatoes, so we tend to call them veggies.<br>  <br>  Edit: Fruit also may or may not contain seeds.  There are many seedless varieties of fruit, and some plant species that naturally produce sterile fruit (without seeds) because they reproduce asexually through other means.  If something has seeds, it must be a fruit.  But, if something does not contain seeds, it can still be a fruit.<br>  <br>  Seeds are embryo and food for the embryo.  The rest of the fruit is meant for seed dispersal, protection, etc.<br>  <br>  The term "vegetable" is not used to categorize plants or plant parts except nutritionally.  In science, it could refer to any kind of plant, but the term isn't really used.|`|ILpp3ncYaa	seeds are in it|`|114a9e7f24177ba552a0e5c76a745e27aa	because it has seeds but also technically cucumber and green beans are also a fruit for the same reason.|`|Qe2xv3Pbaa	Just like the others are saying, tomatoes have seeds.

True fruits are developed from the ovary in the base of the flower, and contain the seeds of the plant (though cultivated forms may be seedless).|`|7V7iQBZSaa	some people are saying because it has seeds, but many many vegetable have seeds, like pumpkins for example.<br>  it is classified a fruit because of its acidity level and the amount of sugar|`|1ICQ1v1naa	Because it has seeds.Vegis don't have seeds fruit does.They say that fruit have seeds vegetables don't but the supermarket just put as a vegetable|`|JDa1iXGYaa	it has seeds.|`|vH3u5sNWaa	because it has seeds

8abc5b9cab61ed51f5b3b0ffd3f6ca5aaa	Well, I can't add much to everything everyone else said, except that if you intend to eat them, they don't have much flavor on their own.  I like to brown some chopped shallots in a few tablespoons butter in the bottom of a pot, then add about a cup of white wine per person.  When that is boiling, throw the cleaned and "bearded" (that's where you rip off the stringy part during cleaning, also make sure they're alive in that they pinch themselves together) mussels in, at least a pound per person.  Cover and steam.  After 5-6 minutes they should be steamed and open.  Put them in a big bowl and pour the broth/butter/wine mixture into a mug for dipping... you can also dip crusty bread in it or even drink it, it's that delicious.  The shallots and wine impart a fabulous flavor to the mussels too.|`|NCvX4I0baa	They're just a sea creature like clams and oysters and such. Seafood can be healthy for you so no it's not just some little mussel growing in the sea. They're spelt different like "sun" and "son". Not trying to be smart, just reasonable.<br>  <br>  If humans could eat mussels to gain muscles I think those mussels would go extinct just from the body builders attacking them and all.|`|e4320d40393740e3b9148136c56004baaa	They're Shell Fish, quite alive till dead.|`|AA10625089	Actually, any meat that you eat is a muscle from some kind of animal.<br>  Mussels are bi-valves like clams and oysters. Yes, they are living creatures and need to be kept alive before cooking.|`|BM9oGl8maa	mussels are not the type of mussels found in a mammal's body, its kina like the mucsles used by sea creatures only, i think. a mussel uses the flesh part of its body to open and close its shell, i guess. that can tell you cery well that, yes, they were once alive under the water before they ended up on your plate. i don't know much about sea creatures because i think they are more fun to observe then to eat.|`|aMHIA7XMaa	They are not muscles like you'd find in your body. (And even if they were muscles, muscles don't just grow independently out in the ocean -  that's ridiculous!)<br>  <br>  They are sea creatures, they were once living things. <br>  <br>  For further reading, consider <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mussel" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mussel</a>|`|SMIryuWEaa	No, mussels in the ocean are nothing like muscles in our bodies. They are mollusks; basically, the part you eat is there internal bits, and the shell is their protective layer. Technically, they were "alive," but they are not sentient.|`|L2UEI99Baa	yes they actually are|`|UhXTWNKZaa	Is Chicken of the sea tuna or chicken? - Jessica Simpson<br>  This is on the level of the question you just asked.|`|HUIo1fQaaa	they are an animal and were alive.  You eat their whole body.|`|5ZyiHyVhaa	no but ther good 4 u.|`|D9fd7a9Uaa	my god<br>  <br>  gtfo|`|bBa3ajzxaa	Yes, mussels are almost entirely made of muscle. They are animals, they were alive until they were killed and cooked in their shells.|`|NvhPhj1taa	Well,i own a seafood resturuant,and mussels are real.It Just has some meat out of it that's poiseness.So,yes they are real,even tho they don't look like it|`|94Fl8571aa	Of course not. The "muscle" hold the shell shut. A scallop is actually a muscle. A mussel is the name of the shellfish. I'm from New England & we eats lot of 'em!|`|Q4oPyclQaa	It's spelled differently.  That should tell you something right off the bat - it's not the same word.  A mussel is a type of clam (yes, it is! Look it up! Don't vote me down because it sounds silly, I'm telling the truth.) and it's a living organism.  I don't believe it's a "muscle".|`|114a9e7f24177ba552a0e5c76a745e27aa	a mussel is a shell fish in the same family as a clam, scallop or oyster. what you eat is an entire animal. also look at spelling theres, mussel and muscle, doesn't the english language suck sometimes

GY2XPIcZaa	Mama's little baby loves short'n short'n! Mama's little baby loves shortening bread!|`|4HhYhxwjaa	I think you can replace it with an equal part of butter, or vegetable oil, or a combination of both.|`|Nzgp6Wcnaa	Shortening, in its most generic meaning, is any fat or oil that is used to make a short crust or dough (one that has a high ratio of fat to flour, and turns out tender, crumbly, and rich).<br>  It's pretty much butter you don't have to put in the fridge or freezer.|`|Gp9eku54aa	so just replace it with more margarine. it may change the consistency a little, but if you don't have it you don't have it.
iHFZLsDTaa	Cooking is a breeze now days. First you must get acquainted with your local grocery store. Clerks are there to help you, so ask for the manager or a clerk to walk around with you.<br>  <br>  What you will find:<br>  <br>  Frozen dinners already cooked - follow directions on the boxes, warm in microwave. Stick with the big name brands for good taste. Add a can of veggies or frozen veggies as a side dish.  Ask a clerk to show you where to find them.<br>  <br>  Pre-cooked meats in sealed packages found in the cold section, not in the freezer, (just pop into the microwave for a few minutes) such as baked ham, pot roast with gravy, chops, chicken, meatloaf, and so much more. Ask a clerk to show you where to find them.<br>  <br>  Canned vegetables to add as a side dish.<br>  Canned sweet potatoes to add as a side dish.<br>  Canned potatoes to add as a side dish.<br>  <br>  Minute Rice as a side dish-follow directions on box.<br>  Stove Top Stuffing-follow directions on box.<br>  You can now buy these products in small containers that you add water to them, let them sit a few minutes, and then eat.<br>  <br>  Frozen vegetables in large bags or small boxes. Heat in microwave.  Ask a clerk to show you where to find them.<br>  <br>  Fresh salad greens now come already cut up and in large packages. Buy the pre-washed types. All you have to do is add the salad dressing. Be sure to use by the date on the bag. Salads turn black and need to be thrown away if not used by the printed date on the bag.<br>  <br>  Canned soups are delicious. Follow the directions on the cans.<br>  <br>  Canned stews are good too.<br>  <br>  Frozen desserts of all types. Follow directions on the containers.<br>  <br>  Bake shop inside the grocery store has all kinds of desserts.<br>  <br>  The deli has delicious rotisserie/roasted chickens. They also have all types of side dishes for you to choose from.<br>  <br>  But if you would like to cook from scratch, go to:  <a href="http://www.cooks.com/rec/ch/main_dishes.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cooks.com/rec/ch/main_dishes....</a><br>  where there are lots of easy recipes.

These are found on a shelf. Noodles are in packages, follow the directions...most of the time you will need a deep pan for boiling lots of hot water for the noodles. <br>  A clerk can help you find these items.<br>  <br>  You will find many brand named boxed dinners such as Pasta-Roni. There is a seasoned packet in each box. <br>  (My favorite is Garlic & Olive Oil.

Or pick up a Rachael Ray cookbook or look on her web site - her recipes are usually pretty easy. The bottom line is - don't give up - gather some recipes and go shopping for the ingredients, and if a word stumps you, turn to Google!! One really simple thing - you can always bake some chicken (just put a little season all and some butter on top of it and bake at 350 until juices run clear) and get some steam in the bag veggies - it's a pretty easy starter meal. I've gotten to be an expert at quick and simple!! Also, instead of trying to buy a cookbook, do a search online for healthy, simple meals - there are tons of good recipes there!

PhPOLgHGaa	well the craving of alcohol can very well be a sign of alcoholism ( being an alcoholic ) and it does run in the family....<br>  <br>  cant say you are to young because you dont state your age but by the sounds of it you are young and even though you have been through what you have with both of your parents/family--there is MUCH more out there then you have a clue about. i am 43 yrs old and have delt with much in my lifetime where alcoholics are concerned...i know far more then i care to know about it.<br>  <br>  i watched a friend wither away because of it and he started out simple like you...very rarely drank then just because more an more frequent..to the point he craved it as well--started sneaking drinks etc....<br>  <br>  i would just watch myself if i were you, you are here asking this question for a reason...therefore you may even see yourself headed in the wrong direction...just take caution.|`|AA11292270	I think you've been exposed to too much AA, courtesy of your mom.  I am sure she means well, but this notion that there is some magic "line" where on one side you're ok and on the other you've got "the disease" and are doomed to AA for life has no basis in reality.<br>  <br>  That said, if at age 17 you feel you have to be drunk to have fun, this does not bode well for the future.  Obviously, you cannot go through life like that--well, you can, but trust me when I tell you that it's not much fun (the hangovers alone make life pretty miserable).  So...much as you may not want to, you're probably best off making some real changes in your drinking behavior right now.  If you have trouble in this regard, google "smart recovery"...you don't have to go to AA.|`|vjijiJT3aa	well it being around you all your life definitely has something to do with it, but I think it's more so having fun than anything else it sounds like you found a way to unwind and live it up....but as a certified bartender it's my job to say "drink responsibly" have a good time just don't over do it :)|`|v2a220YWaa	right now it seems like you are just having fun, but I am concerned about your family history..alcoholism is genetic, so keep it under check, and stay safe.

And for the fact that you have increased your alcohol intake, and now have physical and mental cravings for it is not a good sign.  I'm not a doctor, so I can't say yes or no to you being an alcoholic.  Is it a concern....yes.  I would go and talk to a therapist, and look online for AA meetings in your area.  Alcoholism is a very bad disease.  The best advice is... if it runs in your family just stay away from it and don't take the chance.  Look into getting some help.  Good luck.|`|NSmp58Lbaa	I know easier said than done tryin to control cravings, cause you have the withdrawl. If you feel like your going to explode and cant take it anymore with the panic attacks n such. See your doctor. I know for a fact they can help you with withdrawl symptoms. Your body is use to the achohol, and its not getting what it wants. <br>  Your not a alcoholic, your realizing there is a problem. And first step is asking what to do. <br>  See your doctor is my suggestion. Anything you tell your doctor is confidental. <br>  And if he might prescribe you something for the attacks, And maybe suggest u also go to couciling. That is what I would do. <br>  I hope I helped And good luck hon. <br>  <br>  x0x Charity|`|6XIDmojtaa	sounds like you have a little bit of a physical need for booze it usually happens from binge drinking . i'm not saying you have a problem but you are looking at a path that could take you right to it. you just need to weigh it out whats important to you ? health, life , a girl ,your parents  you can't party 24/7 trust me your liver and kidneys aren't made of cast iron . moderation is key cause its not fun sitting around drinking just to drink or get drunk.|`|HUIo1fQaaa	I think as long as alcohol doesn't interfere with your day to day life, you are not an alcoholic.

Caffeine is debated among Mormons.  Mountain Dew isn't going to keep you out of the temple.  You won't be asked if you drink caffeine.  I put it in the same category as Twinkies.  One is fine, but if you're eating 30 a day, that's a problem and a very unwise health choice.

It's called Postum, but I hear that it doesn't really taste all that great.  I've never tried it, however, so I could be wrong.  I think you can find it at most grocery stores, though I've never really looked.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry that I can't be of more help, but there really aren't any alternatives to coffee or tea.  Just keep in mind that the Word of Wisdom was given to us as a protection and that you'll be healthier and closer to God if you obey it.  And in the meantime, maybe you could just ask your brother and mother to not drink coffee around you?  Hiding the coffee pot would also help.

0maJCeLCaa	The leaner the cut of meat, the healthier it is. <br>  Generally you shouldn't have so called "red meat" more than a couple of times a week, mainly because it has some "hidden fat" - fat within the meat, which can not be cut off. So called red meats also contain cholesterol.<br>  In comparison, the majority of the fat on chicken is very visible, and you can remove it easily. Skinless chicken is low fat, so you can have a lot of that on a diet. Fish is usually lean, but some types have some fat - f.ex. salmon.

5mCm2XTLaa	When you first start smoking you do get a little buzz from the nicotine but as you body adjusts to it and builds a tolerance the buzz goes away and is replaced a feeling of focused relaxation when you light up. <br>  <br>  Problems start once your body becomes accustomed to the nicotine.  When the nicotine level drops and it's tranquilizing effects wear off people get jittery and start craving for more. Ever hear of someone having a nicotine fit? <br>  <br>  Remember nicotine is both physically and mentally addictive. Nicotine is one of the most addictive substances known to mankind it's as addictive as heroin. Doesn't matter if tobacco is smoked or chewed the addiction is still the same. <br>  <br>  There are tobacco alternatives that are nicotine free, they do provide some mild relaxation but they're nowhere near as potent in their effects as tobacco, but then again they're nowhere as addictive.<br>  <br>  Check out the link. They provide some smoking herbs that taste and burn very well, some of them have been used for centuries. And what I like best about this site is they don't try and pull any of the "legal" highs and buds baloney.|`|NTEuxMVmaa	nicotine,some stores sell flavored cigarettes without nicotine.|`|6XIDmojtaa	it actually only when you start smoking and it because your not getting as much oxygen . if you just started go and hot box a 100 cig as fast as you can then wait a few weeks and try it again you wont get the buzz cause you body has adjusted to less o2 from smoking. I haven't seen tobacco with no nicotine so that would be a new one for me! if you insist on getting that buzz hold you breathe until you see stars that's about the equivalent.|`|BGw4DGd1aa	You get it from the nicotine IN the tobacco, and yes i still get it

ispQWeQmaa	No it won't. Remember that many of the foods we enjoy eating, and keep in the refrigerator, were originally invented as ways of preserving food. Yogurt is one way to preserve milk for short periods; it is a live bacterial culture and will stay unspoiled for many hours if left out of the fridge, and will typically keep for months in the fridge (I have found the best-before dates on yogurts are usually way too conservative). Cheese is an even longer-term way of storing milk; hard cheese can keep for months unrefrigerated if properly stored in a relatively cool place, or at least a week in normal temperatures (I've been on two-week canoe trips where we ate old cheddar on the last day, and it was still good).<br>  <br>  Common sense, of course, should prevail - if there are signs of spoilage, don't eat it. If the plastic lid or the foil on top of the container is bulging a bit, that's probably just the small amount of air in the container expanding due to heat. But if you open a fruit yogurt and there's a small explosion, there's a chance that the fruit may have fermented (probably still safe as it would just have turned to alcohol, but not terribly tasty).|`|8740c9d03300d2d76f91ceaf7a9ffc93aa	Yes!|`|ILpp3ncYaa	probably not.|`|AAgX0SDcaa	Depends on what the temperature is outside the ice box. I've traveled through Morocco, small hanuts sell yogurt unrefrigerated for hours, they get it from a big store and then it sets inside their glass counter until someone buys it.

zawmsUO1aa	Here's what the folks at Claussen say, "Pickles typically come in two varieties: refrigerated and non-refrigerated. Claussen pickles are always made fresh; therefore, they must always be refrigerated. In fact, Claussen is made all year round, by harvesting cucumbers wherever they are in season. Claussen is never cooked and always kept cold, so every bite brings a crisp crunch. Claussen offers a bold, sensory experience through its intense pickle flavor, crunch, cold freshness, and cucumber appearance."<br>  <br>  <a href="http://brands.kraftfoods.com/claussen/bn/c_WhyClaussen/" rel="nofollow">http://brands.kraftfoods.com/claussen/bn...</a>|`|ILpp3ncYaa	They are not sealed in a jar.

Put them in a 6-quart kettle with all the other ingredients. Bring to a boil. Lower the heat, cover the pot and simmer, stirring occasionally to keep the peas from sticking to the bottom of the pan, for 2 to 3 hours. The peas and vegetables should be very soft and begin to fall apart. Fish out the ham bone and let it cool. Pick off the edible meat, chop it finely and return the meat to the pot. Discard the bone. The thicker part of the soup will tend to sink to the bottom of the pan and should be stirred up before serving. <br>  <br>  Fish out the clove if you can find it. <br>  <br>  Yield: 6 to 8 servings<br>  <br>  To freeze: let cool and pack into 2-cup freezer containers. Label and freeze up to 3 months.|`|ILpp3ncYaa	Any casserole or pasta dishes, soups, stews, chili.|`|tqD9xUpYaa	Check out the KraftFoods.com site - especially for their made-over chicken tetrazzini.  I've made that recipe about 6 times - sometimes with chicken and sometimes with turkey.  I use already cooked poultry instead of sauteing it in the first step.  And we add some sauted onions and celery and then a can of sliced water chestnuts for crunch.  It freezes really well.  In fact, I have a quart in my freezer now from when I made it a couple weeks ago.<br>  <br>  Meatloaf is another good choice.  Your grandfather can just bake a couple potatoes and use bagged salad with it if he's not used to cooking.  Otherwise, he can add a steamed veggie.<br>  <br>  Maybe make chili or beef stew for him to reheat.  <br>  <br>  Good luck to all of you with your grandmother's recovery.

Lasagna is good because you can freeze the pieces individually. (don't add salt to anything . Another is beef stew or spaghetti sauce! Good luck!!  (:|`|KSK22vHUaa	A big roast with some potatoes and carrots and onion would be good for quite a few dinners.  Get 2 or 3 pounds of roast, 5 or 6 peeled potatoes cut into 4 or 5 big chunks, 3 or 4 peeled carrots cut in half, and half an onion.  Coat the meat lightly with flour and fry it in hot oil in a skillet, just for a minute to let the flour get kind of brown and stick to the meat really well.  Bake all of this this in a big pan with a cup of water, 1/4 cup worcestershire sauce, some black pepper for about an hour and a half at 375 degrees.<br>  <br>  Another thing to do is buy some drumsticks (they're usually pretty cheap) and arrange them in a baking pan.  In a bowl, mix a can or two of cream-of-chicken soup with a tablespoon paprika, a good shake of black pepper and some salt.  Pour this over the meat.  Bake at 375 about half an hour, then turn the drumsticks over to baste and continue cooking.  You can serve this up with some buttered rice and a vegetable, like some canned green beans or even some fresh asparagus.  You wouldn't even need to cook the asparagus, just let it go frozen and it'll heat itself in the microwave.<br>  <br>  Soups tend to freeze really well.  Make some bean-and-bacon soup:  Get a pound of navy beans and soak them overnight.  Drain and rinse and put them in a big (I use an 11quart pot) pot with enough water to cover them with an extra 3 inches at the top.  Add to this a pound of crisp and crumbled bacon, half a chopped onion, two chopped celery ribs, four chicken bouillon cubes, a grated potato (medium), two teaspoons each of black pepper and paprika, a teaspoon of minced garlic, a can of diced tomatoes and an 8oz can of tomato sauce.  Bring this to a boil and cook this for about an hour and a half.  You can divide it into small tupperware bowls to freeze them separately for each person, or medium ones so they can have one meal.  Just serve it with some loaf bread.<br>  <br>  Another thing to make to freeze would be spaghetti sauce.  A pound of ground beef, browned.  Add to this two teaspoons minced garlic, a crumbled bay leaf, two teaspoons dried oregano, a teaspoon dried basil, a teaspoon black pepper, two cans diced tomatoes, a 12 oz can tomato paste, and three cups of water.  Let this simmer for about half an hour.  If you want it thinner, add a little more water.  If it's too thin, cook it more than half an hour to let it cook down some.  Your grandfather will surely be capable of cooking a pot of noodles to have this with ( :<br>  <br>  A casserole that freezes well is shepherd's pie.  Get one of those aluminum disposable casserole pans from the grocery store or walmart to freeze the whole thing together in.  Shepherd's pie has two pounds of ground beef, browned, with a package of brown gravy mix in it and a good dash or worcestershire sauce.  To the meat you can add a can of english peas and a can of cooked carrots, or any other vegetables your grandparents would prefer (I like green beans in mine).  Pour the meat and vegetable mixture into the casserole pan.  On top, put some mashed potatoes.  Peel 6 or 7 medium potatoes and slice them thin, and boil them for about 20 minutes.  Drain them completely, and add about 3 tablespoons butter.  Add enough milk to mash them.  Layer this over the top of the meat and veggies.  On top, put some shredded cheddar cheese.  This can be frozen whole as is and heated up in the oven--give it an hour at 350 degrees.  Otherwise, bake it fresh until the cheese is melted (about 10 minutes) and divide it into individiual portions.<br>  <br>  Here one!  "Hobo dinners"--put some meat (like a pork chop, or a raw ground beef burger patty, or a chicken breast) on a piece of tin foil.  To this add a small peeled and sliced potato, a carrot peeled and halved, and a quarter of an onion.  Also season with some black pepper or even some A1 (the A1 is good even on chicken).  Wrap this up in tin foil.  One pocket for each person for each meal.  Bake these fresh for an hour at 375, or for two hours if frozen.  <br>  <br>  Crockpot bbq!  Get a ham from the grocery, one of the already smoked ones.  Cut it up into pieces (maybe softball sized pieces) and fit them into your crockpot.  Add to this an onion, quartered, a good dash of liquid smoke, a cup of your favorite bbq sauce and half a cup of vinegar.  Cook this all day (9 hours) on low.  It can be frozen in portions and he can heat them up and all he'd have to worry about is getting a bag of chips and some hamburger buns.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you need some more ideas my blog is at sarahphaedre.blogspot.com (it's fairly new but leave a comment and I'll give you plenty more ideas!).
QJmGo5fFaa	Absolutely not.  Once food thaws and reaches a internal temperature above 40 degrees it goes to whats known as the danger zone.

Maybe try mixing up some cocktails.|`|xYg6Dl4qaa	dont listen to em man.  here's what you do:  eat a little food before hand, then drink a little water between every drink...and burp!|`|4Vojc48Eaa	Tip: Don't drink period.
U3XxUY6Taa	There is a difference between Gumbo, Jambalaya and southern American foods. Real southern food is smothered or fried chicken, coconut cake, collard greens, kale, candied sweet potatoes, cornbread, corn pudding, dressing (as opposed to stuffing for turkey),  almost any pork product, smoked ham, corn on the cob, butter on everything!!, banana pudding, green beans and white potatoes, smothered cabbage, wild rabbit, buttermilk biscuits, pound cake, mac and cheese, deep dish fruit cobblers, blackberries with cream, grits, redeye gravy, country ham - stuff like that. <br>  Check out Paula Dean on Food Network or Down Home with the Neelys for down home southern. <br>  That other stuff is Cajun inspired food with a French accent from the Bayous of Louisiana.|`|ttfuh5pKaa	Hi -<br>  <br>  I am sending you a link as well as recipes for some of the best-known recipes from the South.

Ps0tDYBAaa	ask him if he would prefer a nice fruit salad if his stomach cannot tolerate vegetables or offer him a light soup. or do the third thing if you want, the third option sounds reasonable.|`|yfwY8XGlaa	while you are all eating salad, you can give him some bread instead, or soup.|`|ILpp3ncYaa	1. It is his choice.|`|TJOHxhEUaa	If it's too late to change your menu to accommodate that one person, then offer him some bread to munch on while the rest of you enjoy your salads.  All you have to say to the others is, "Here you go.  Jim's not having a salad tonight".
m1cEbzBcaa	didn't read all your question... but i believe the majority of these "natural" options aren't really any good, but they MAY work as a placebo, in which case, you could be just eating tic-tacs and get the same results.<br>  <br>  what does this have to do with Beer, Wine & Spirits?
m1cEbzBcaa	i can't tell you exactly what the prices are for you, since you didn't mention where you are.  Yahoo! Answers is an international service, and prices of this sort vary in location greatly.   If i told you they cost 43 euros in france, or 2,000 pesos in mexico, or 3432 russian rubles... it doesn't do you much good, dose it?<br>  <br>  near me (upper mid-wed US) Bacardi 151 is about $25-30 for a 1L, they don't sell a 1.75L side. Smirnoff only sells in 750 (for about $15) and 1.75 for about $25
CGnL2nS0aa	WOW!!! I wish the store close to me had such a variety!<br>  <br>  Now, I will select the beers I would have. The reason? They are good beers. <br>  <br>  Here's my choices, no particular order. Also, there are many I haven't had so i can't include them. <br>  <br>  guinness <br>  hoegaarden<br>  stella artois <br>  warsteine<br>  <br>  Basically though, as a rule, stay away from the mass production...Bud, Miller, Coors. Corona is overrated! Someone told me they had one and it tasted like kerosene! LOL<br>  <br>  Have fun!|`|19XMgD2Xaa	Depends on how much you want to spend.  I would really suggest giving a variety.  I would go with 2 to 3, 6-packs of beer (bottles).  Looks like there's a great selection here but..here would be my three choices, in no particular order,<br>  that I would suggest for the varied beer drinker. <br>  <br>  - Stella Artois (Its a little on the expensive side but always a winner in my book, its a smooth solid lager that has deliciously sweet after taste.  Its a great beer for a seasoned and non season beer drinker)<br>  <br>  - Amstel Light (Another lager, best light beer on the block hands down, great taste all around, you'll make you're friends smile when you pull this on out.<br>  <br>  - Hoegaarden (Great wheat beer, that's actually nutritious for you.  Its a little different than the other beers.  But has a solid taste and its respected by many.)<br>  <br>  <br>  Would NOT suggest - Becks, Heineken or Miller anything from that list.|`|WxqUnEKJaa	What I think would be a good idea is to have every person you invite bring a 6 pack of their favorite (or 12, depending on how much you plan on drinking) and everybody gets at least 1 beer out of each of the different types. This way you get a wide variety and you get to find out what type of beer all your friends prefer. It would be kinda like a beer sampling party.|`|67d9963e687ff64ac5d02a2e50fa2b47aa	Do with Duvel great Belgium beer. Well rounded and sharp with taste. But if the people are not hardcore but more social drinkers go with the Stella because its a bit more balanced out and not as overpowering. Some people dont like strong beer.|`|gnom5J8Naa	I haven't heard of most of those but whenever I have a party I get Miller Lite or Corona and lime is also a good one but it costs a lot more.|`|GPgykIJZaa	Just ask them<br>  whatever the majority likes buy it.|`|HGTGf3dpaa	budweiser - inexpensive and descent taste<br>  corona - just good*** tasting beer - don't forget the limes<br>  killigans - is good and inexpensive<br>  landshark - similar to corona<br>  miller highlife - decent taste and inexpensive
ttfuh5pKaa	Hi -<br>  <br>  I believe this is what you are looking for:<br>  <br>  Easter Story Cookies to be made the night before Easter <br>  <br>  You need: <br>  ? 1 cup whole pecans <br>  ? 1 tsp. vinegar <br>  ? 3 egg whites <br>  ? pinch salt <br>  ? 1 cup sugar <br>  ? zipper baggie <br>  ? wooden spoon <br>  ? tape <br>  ? Bible<br>  <br>  Preheat oven to 300 degrees (this is important - don't wait until you are half done with the recipe!) <br>  <br>  Place pecans in zipper baggie and let children beat them with the wooden spoon to break into small pieces.  Explain that after Jesus was arrested, He was beaten by the Roman soldiers. Read John 19:1-3<br>  <br>  Let each child smell the vinegar.  Put 1 tsp. vinegar into mixing bowl.  Explain that when Jesus was thirsty on the cross, He was given vinegar to drink. Read John 19:28-30<br>  <br>  Add egg whites to vinegar. Eggs represent life. Explain that Jesus gave His life to give us life.  Read John 10:10-11<br>  <br>  Sprinkle a little salt into each child's hand.  Let them taste it and brush the rest into the bowl.  Explain that this represents the salty tears shed by Jesus' followers, and the bitterness of our own sin. <br>  Read Luke 23:27<br>  <br>  Add 1 cup sugar.  Explain that the sweetest part of the story is that Jesus died because He loves us.  He wants us to know and belong to Him.  Psalms 34:8 and John 3:16<br>  <br>  Beat with a mixer on high speed for 12 to 15 minutes until stiff peaks are formed.  Explain that the color white represents the purity in God's eyes of those whose sins have been cleansed by Jesus.  Read Isaiah 1:18 and John 3:1-3<br>  <br>  Fold in broken nuts.  Drop by teaspoons onto wax paper covered cookie sheet.  Explain that each mound represents the rocky tomb where Jesus' body was laid.  Read Matthew 27:57-60<br>  <br>  Put the cookie sheet in the oven, close the door and turn the oven OFF. <br>  <br>  Give each child a piece of tape and seal the oven door.  Explain that Jesus' tomb was sealed.  Read Matthew 27:65-66<br>  <br>  GO TO BED!  Explain that they may feel sad to leave the cookies in the oven overnight.  Jesus' followers were in despair when the tomb was sealed.  Read John 16:20 and 22<br>  <br>  On Easter morning, open the oven and give everyone a cookie. Notice the cracked surface and take a bite.  The cookies are hollow!  Explain that on the first Easter, Jesus' followers were amazed to find the tomb open and empty.  Read Matthew 28:1-9|`|FOyNZfeBaa	congratulations
ILpp3ncYaa	Uhm, I would call CPS.|`|AaXl5YYkaa	um that is confusing. could you re-word it?
ozcm5WGfaa	This is what I suggest. Pick a few of your favorite drinks, such as a kamikazi, sex on the beach, red headed slut shots, and then use a drink calculator to find out how much liquor to purchase.<br>  <br>  For example, here is the recipe to a kamikazi and at the bottom of the page it has a drink calculator:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.liquorlive.com/drinks.php?option=com_drinkdetails&DID=676" rel="nofollow">http://www.liquorlive.com/drinks.php?opt...</a><br>  <br>  Then, for "safety" sake purchase a handle of your favorite spirit, and worry about the mixers once you get to your destination.|`|BGw4DGd1aa	Couple 40 pounders.|`|NLgEu3YMaa	Beer and lots of beer of course I would say get Stella Artois(bottles) great beer not to expensive not to cheap nice crispy ,refreshing taste and 5.2% alcohol which will make you happy lol<br>  <br>  And if you want you also can get bottle of whisky Crown Royal would be good but can cost money if it was me i would just buy lots of beer<br>  <br>  Now beer for 10 people for 4 days to get smashed each night i would say you need average is about 6beers per person or tho so i would say you need  20boxes of beer(if each box contains 12 bottles 330ml each)|`|1bf65adf94c521d6e4c53eb8fb9154cfaa	At least a couple hundred beers. figure 10 people will drink 8-12 beers. 4 nights. Thats at least 300 beers. Or just get a couple handles of tequila and then beer. Liquor then beer in the clear.|`|yRkZVwwdaa	make this drink...<br>  <br>  <br>  one frozen lime aid  <br>  one frozen lemon aid<br>  one bottle of vodka<br>  three pitchers of beer<br>  <br>      have fun :]|`|AO44fEv4aa	A Keg|`|psLIs6Spaa	I don`t know but make sure you have enough.
iMj57zxAaa	how do you make the turkish fried rice with pine nuts sounds good|`|qUh0qsXiaa	iskender and mezes|`|AA12096847	Lamb shish kabobs marinated in milk, olive oil, onions and garlic<br>  corban salata (shepard's salad with tomatos, cucumbers, peppers, parsley, lemon, olive oil and salt and pepper)<br>  turkish fried rice (with celery, garlic and pine nuts)<br>  fresh pita bread<br>  feta cheese or yogurt <br>  baklava and coffee for dessert
Quq2Dqxtaa	Well as long as you keep it clean, it should last indefinitely.  The liquor shouldn't eat away the plastic since lots of liquor is sold in plastic bottles.
ILpp3ncYaa	the oil of soybeans.|`|5zNwBQZHaa	Um . . . ya.   <br>  <br>  What exactly is it you want to know -do you want to know it's lipid profile?  (how many grams saturated fat/unsaturated fat, etc) or its molecular structure or what?<br>  <br>  Hit the edit button and add more details - if not, your question is kinda silly.  What is soybean oil made of?  It's made from soybean oil, of course!!!
